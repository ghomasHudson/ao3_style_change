“So they can lie to your face again? So they can twist this to make it seem like they did nothing wrong?” Malfoy asks. “They’ve never loved you, Draco, and no matter what you do, they never will. You’ll never be good enough for them.”
“Oh,” Draco tucks a strand of wavy hair behind his ear. Ginny just cut it, so it’s short in the back and on the sides, but it’s longer at the top, white blond, and shiny, and so fucking
,” more like forced, by the tone she says it in. “That they send Dementors to guard the castle. They’ve no reason to harm you, but do try to stay away from them.”
“Draco won’t tell us anything.” Ron feels proud of his little brother, and he’s sure his face shows it; Malfoy scowls. “But you will.”
And with that, she takes Draco’s arm and leads him out the door, leaving Harry alone with the wolves.
Harry leaves as fast as his legs will carry him, and finally, in the safety of the Gryffindor common room, he collapses on the couch, feeling like he might vomit.
Draco signals at them, and they all steel themselves for when he throws the door of the bedroom open.
They all sit on the floor around the bits of parchment, and Harry reads what he can understand, which, embarrassingly, isn’t much.
As it is, against his better logic, he runs his hand softly through Harry’s hair, smiling lightly at the approving moan he gets in return. Of course he’ll be here when Harry wakes up. He’d never deny him anything.
“We caught him,” Draco says, disbelieving. He straightens and looks at Harry with a smile. “It’s our anniversary soon. What are we going to do to celebrate?”
He’s not sure Harry believes him. “Come on. I’ll walk you to your dorm, and you better get some sleep.”
. His lips are soft, and warm, and Draco has longed for this so bad for so long he’s burning with it.
Bill had taken Draco from his mother shortly because it became evident she was struggling – though it had been an impressive feat to carry him, it quickly became evident that she couldn’t do it for very long – and they’d laid him on their couch, which means that they’re all now sitting either on the dining chairs or the floor around him. Harry’s sitting on the arm of the couch, a hand tightly around Draco’s ankle. He hasn’t let go of him since they arrived.
“SLYTHERIN!” The Hat calls out. The Slytherin table erupts in cheers, and, before McGonagall moves, it speaks to him again.
isn’t used to, being as short and narrow as he is – and they walk closely together, wands gripped tightly on their fists.
“At the beginning of this year. The death eaters escaped and Professor Lupin showed us a picture of them. Slick back his hair, give him a nastier sneer, and roughen him up a bit and Draco looks
to be obliviated, wants all of this not to be happening, wants  to be so fucking far away from all of what’s happening and
He wonders what he’ll do if it works. For all the confidence with which he’d told Harry he’d find a way, he’s not sure. Even if Basilisk venom does work, there’s no way Harry’ll drink it and survive. Draco’s been spending more of his time on Horocrux research than on classes, and he’s getting desperate. There’s very little information on the subject, and he hasn’t found anything about a person being a Horocrux.
"I know who you are." She says. "You're a Malfoy. I know who your father is. You're no better than the rest of them."
“I’m not.” Draco says quickly. “It – we – we don’t have sex. It’s a moaning tape. It was just to convince the boys in his dorm that we were having sex.”
, and we’re happy! It’s perfect, and I love you so much, and I know you love me, too. Why do we have to ruin that?”
She rushes to continue. “He doesn’t know it’s about you! He doesn’t even know why we’re doing it at all.”
“It’s here!” Hermione says, lifting the phial of Basilisk Venom triumphantly. Ron rushes over and fishes the cup out of the bag he’s carrying, unwrapping it from the handkerchief they’d placed around it. He places it on the floor.
“It was expensive,” Mundungus assures them. “And you’re not going to find a lot of it, ever. It’s a one of a time opportunity.”
“That’s not going to work, princess.” The man informs him, and, as he’s dragged outside, Draco freezes in horror.
Ron drops down on the couch and gives half a shrug. He thinks he should feel better than he does; he just got his brother back, and he’s not wondering if he’s dead in a ditch somewhere anymore, it’s just… somehow, he’s still worried that something’s going to happened, that something already
He pulls himself out of the passage, coughing violently, and finds Ginny already waiting there for him.
Draco slips into Harry’s bed, as quietly as he can, and lets himself calm down with the feeling of Harry’s arms wrapped around him, his chest against Draco’s back, their legs tangled together.
Ron is suddenly hit by the terrifying idea that she might come back after the war’s ended. That she might want to take his baby brother away from them. He couldn’t bear it. He wouldn’t let her.
Scorpius looks at her, chewing on his lower lip. “I think I need to talk to Headmistress McGonagall.”
When Draco sees him, his entire demeanor changes almost imperceptibly. He exhales. He looks at Ron and Hermione – held kneeling behind Harry – and Harry can see the almost frantic edge around his eyes disappear.
He catches sight of his wand, lying under rubble and burning pieces of wood, and he tries to get to it. Just as his fingers close around it, a shiny black shoe steps on his wrist. Draco drops it with a pained grunt, looking up at the blurry figure of Bellatrix Lestrange.
“Merlin, you can’t even be bothered to deny it, can you?” he asks. “Have you nothing to say for yourselves?”
“I'm not like them." He says. "And you know how dangerous the Diadem is. You want it gone just as much as I do.”
Slowly, Draco comes into consciousness; Harry can feel his heart pounding through his skin, sees the way he’s taking frantic breaths.
Draco makes a face before he can stop himself, and he sees Lupin smirk discreetly. He probably knew Draco’d find a way to listen in unless someone were with him.
“We’re sorry.” Ginny blurts. Draco looks at her. “For lying to you. It was a decision that affected you, and we shouldn’t have made it for you.”
“I don’t-” Draco begins, sounding pained. He shudders, and something like a sob escapes his mouth. “My head hurts so
He’s thrown into a different room every time he’s dragged out of the dungeons. They leave him there without food or water until he finds what they’re looking for – which he hasn’t, because he doesn’t know
“He didn’t show me the others, after the first one, but he thought they were from a spy, or a prisoner.” He explains. “They just said what the death eaters were up to.”
“This might not be a good time,” He says, but really, he doesn’t think Ron can get any angrier, so it’s as good time as any. “But I think I’m in love with him.”
“Potter,” McGongall is at the end of the hall, looking out the window at the shields she’s put up. “They’re here.”
He’s mostly hiding away in the library, but it feels more like rotting away. The three days he was missing are a blank space in his mind, and he knows they’re terribly important, but he doesn’t know why.
The next four days are spent in a haze of putting out fires (most of them rhetorical except for one), helping Fleur greet family and guests coming from France, making sure everything is ready, and, at night, finally collapsing into bed with Harry.
Since he was the last one awake, everyone else is already ready, so he has to shower and dress quickly. He pulls on muggle denims and a worn green jumper that used to be one of his brother’s, though he doesn’t know which. It fits him four sizes too big, so he suspects it must be Bill’s, but, to be honest, everyone in his family is rather tall but him, so it could be anyone’s.
to rare, black-market venom, but nothing’s worked. They venture into Knockturn Alley thrice a week in the hopes that something might work, but so far, it’s been useless.
Scorpius says. He looks desperately at Pansy, leaning against the counter with a glass of wine in her hand. “I should be a part of this.”
Parkinson and Ginny aren’t here; they stayed in the library, comparing notes and telling each other what their group knew, and Ginny will fill them in later.
“Yeah.” Blaise says. He shakes his head and grabs his own bag. “The professors sent me your school work.”
He looks around him, trying to determine where he is, but his mind comes up blank; he’s never seen this place before.
Draco’s in over his head now, and there’s no way this won’t end with his heart broken. He should find someone he’s attracted to that isn’t the damned
before him, Draco has to look down at his wand. He doesn’t think he fired a killing curse, but there’s no one else who could’ve, and the green light came from his direction.
“Who are you?” Harry doesn’t know when Hermione got her wand back, but she’s pointing it at the woman, and Harry’s grateful, because he couldn’t concentrate on anything but Draco even if he tried.
He takes something tiny out of his pocket, and when he Engorgio’s it, Draco realizes it’s a huge Honeydukes bag full of candy.
“Oh no.” He says. “No! Definitely not!” he throws a beseeching look at Ron. “How are you on board with this?! It would involve me seeing Draco naked! While he’s not aware I’m there! It’s all sorts of creepy!”
“We have to tell the students.” Draco hears McGonagall’s voice faintly – really, they always have their meetings in the abandoned Potions classroom, they should change it up once in a while – and they slow down as they get closer.
This chapter is generally fluffy, but u know misunderstandings like these are just huge setups for angst so ://
They get out of people’s way – Diagon’s completely full with parents buying their children’s things – and stand outside of Flourish and Blott’s, where Draco’s family goes into.
to go back, wants to either live to see the rest of their lives together or die knowing his love is alright, knowing he knows he loves him. Harry feels as though he hasn’t told him he loves him in so long. Draco needs to know it.
“No.” Harry answers immediately. Draco’s heart skips a beat. “No, Draco, it’s too dangerous, please. I need – I need to know you’re safe, I need you here.”
kids, we could adopt! They’ll be ours, and you always say you hate babies, so we don’t have to adopt them as babies! They could be older, six or seven, and they’ll be out of the screaming stage you hate so much.”
Draco cracks a smile against her shoulder, and though she doesn’t see it, she feels it. “Honestly I thought you’d know better by now. No matter how many stupid shit I do, I don’t die.”
Harry finally looks at him. “I’m talking about the fact that we were going out and I thought we were exclusive until I heard you shagging Theodore Nott!”
a choice like that? Stay, fight for what’s right, lose not only yourself, but your loved ones in the process – because no one who’s faught in a war has come out the same and Draco isn’t ready to rebuild himself from nothing – or leave. Spend the rest of your life running, from one bad guy or another, from the past, from yourself. Lose yourself in the process, anyway.
“Yours’ll probably be a dung beetle, because it’s what you are.” Draco shoots back, cheeks burning hotly.
“We’re all lying to him.” She says drily. “And if he finds out, you think it’ll matter to him if we were doing it to his face or not?”
So Hermione watches quietly as she does it with another two magpies – each one giving her one of the horcruxes – and, soon enough, she’s holding all three.
“If you don’t like it learn to be a ‘pure soul’.” Adam says with Sprout’s dreamy tone. Draco knows mainly he’s just surprised Sprout decided Thomas was one and he wasn’t.
Draco doesn’t begin to think about Harry and Blaise in bed together until he gets out of the Slytherin dorms. There’s a tight knot forming at the back of his throat and his eyes are prickling, but it’s not sadness; He’s
Ron and Hermione are sitting by Harry’s side, looking uncomfortable, and Ginny’s sitting between Harry and the frowning Weasley’s, watching all of it with a terribly amused expression.
“You need to leave.” she says. “Find the room. Get the diadem, destroy it. Don’t let Tom back here.”
He’s never had such a hard time finding something to say to Harry. So of course, he does what he does best; he makes a complete fool of himself by opening his big careless mouth.
“Hey.” He smiles. He’s sitting beside Dolohov’s hospital bed, waiting for him to wake up; when he does, they’ll question him, and, hopefully, get him to turn against Riddle after the attempt on his life. Harry can’t wait. “What are you doing here?”
As the night progresses, he’s getting more and more anxious because the only places he’s finding anything about Horocruxes are in books about extremely Dark Magic and Necromancy, and he’s not sure this is something he wants to mess with.
“Can’t leave,” Draco mutters weakly, lips pressed against Harry’s shoulder. “We need to – need to go – nursery – Horcruxes-”
“Albus,” McGonagall nods. She hasn’t told Harry much about him, other than the fact that he’s one of the most powerful wizards in the world. Harry isn’t in anyway inclined to doubt her. “Potter, this is Albus Dumbledore. Albus, this is-”
“I just-” Harry stops and exhales roughly, but he doesn’t look at Draco. “Look, it’s okay. I don’t – you don’t owe me to go out with me or anything-”
Ron scowls, and Harry grins, kissing his boyfriend’s cheek. It makes Draco turn redder, but he hums in appreciation.
“They’re your family,” McGonagall tells him. “And I need you to listen to me when I say that no one regrets the death of Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter like I do. I watched them grow up, I watched them fall in love, and I watched them die long before it was their time to, and that is something I'd never wish upon anyone. But you are a child, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, and I will not let you fight this war.”
Scorpius swallows; their story is legendary, told to children before bed, talked about in the streets. The way they hated each other, the way they fell in love.
Scorpius dies in the Forbidden Forest, and just for a few minutes, he gets to see his parents. He's never seen them before, not like this.
“You know,” Hermione says reluctantly. “There’s literally a complete house of ‘resourceful’ students.”
And the thing is, Scorpius knows he’s been fair with everyone else, too; Rose is half in love with him, and he’s not
The Grey Lady’s in front of him so quickly he nearly jumps backwards, which would’ve had him falling off the stairs of the Astronomy tower.
And well, that statement makes Harry more jealous than he’s been in his life. Part of him says that it’s not
out of the ordinary, you should tell a teacher. The curfew will now be at eight instead of ten. All students,” it seems like she’s looking at Potter especially. “Without exception, must be at their common rooms at that time. Understood?”
The next weeks pass relatively uneventfully. People are avoiding Draco and looking at him oddly since the word spread that he got a letter from an escaped death eater, but thankfully his dormmates merely rolled their eyes and kept trying to figure out who Snape’s godson was.
He’d woken up with this note on his nightstand; he doesn’t know who put it there – his dorm mates say it wasn’t them – and it didn’t take long to realize they’re Horocruxes. They already knew about Hufflepuff’s cup and the diadem, but they hadn’t known about the others.
He tightens his coat around himself as he gets outside. He doesn’t know where he’s going, but he just wants to get somewhere he doesn’t think about Harry and Blaise together in bed.
After we arrived at the new house, Draco was of course sick after the apparation, we got started on the next room in the house. The next room was the dining room. It wasn’t as big as the living room and I imagine we would only be able to fit a table and chairs and a couple of cabinets in, but what else did a dining room need anyway. We would probably only eat in here if we had guests and would put a small table in the kitchen for everyday.
I flick through the TV channels, but deep down I know I’m procrastinating. Burning a bright red hole in the side of my bag is that contract. Do I have the strength and the wherewithal to read it tonight?
“That seems reasonable, I'll owl you.” He turned to get some floo powder but I didn’t want him to go just yet, so I grabbed his hand.
I steal into the bathroom, bewildered by my lack of underwear. I'd steal his but I'm in my room not his. While drying myself after my enjoyable but far too brief shower, I realise he’s done this on purpose. He wants me to be embarrassed and ask for my boxers back, and he’ll either say yes or no. H
The Submissive will eat regularly to maintain his health and well-being from a prescribed list of foods (Appendix 4). The Submissive will not snack between meals, with the exception of fruit.
“You’re right sorry. You and Katie know best, you just worried me a bit. But you are right and this should be together.” He kissed my cheek lightly.
? That’s too much. I’ll never see Pansy or whatever friends I may make at my new job, provided I get one. Perhaps I should have one weekend a month to myself. He’s my master! I’m to be dealt with as he pleases!
“Do you want me to stay or wait in the kitchen?”  Hermione asks. I look at her and open my mouth but I can't speak.
“Oh….baby…..that feels so good.” he murmurs. I suck harder, flicking my tongue across the head of his impressive cock. Wrapping my teeth  behind my lips, I clamp my mouth around him. His breath hisses between his teeth, and he groans.
“The photographer?” His jaw clenches and his eyes burn. I blink at him. “I don't like to share, Mr Malfoy. Remember that.” His quiet, chilling tone is warning, and with one long, cold look at me, he apparates presumably to the bedroom.
“If you call that a proposal then you are more of an oaf than i thought.” He got up and held his hand out. “Come on oaf, we are going back to yours and you are cooking me my favourite dinner, remember.” I grabbed his hand and he hauled me up. I smiled at him and gave his mouth another quick kiss.
“Well you were welcome to join me anytime.” He says with a smirk. He has a towel wrapped around his waist and one in his hair. He has water dripping down him and looks so hot-
“Naughty, sweet boy.” he whispers, and then reaches over to the bedside table for another condom. “Stay still, don't move.” he orders as he releases my hair,
“That’s amazing! Congratulations.” I hug him again and am really happy for him. Pansy gets up then and hugs him too.
The tree in front of the house was flawless, and ideal for hanging a swing. I could picture a basketball hoop and little bicycles. And the backyard looked big enough to teach the kids how to fly. There were no pictures of the inside but Hermione said she had been and seen it in person and that was good enough for me. The deposit was a bit less than what I was expecting for a house so big. It had 5 bedrooms including a converted attic, 3 bathrooms, a pantry and 3 stables. Although Draco had grown up pureblood, I know for a fact that he rode horses as well as brooms. Maybe I’d surprise him with one? That would be a nice surprise right? There was also a pretty big greenhouse and a porch covering the whole front of the house. The porch did look like it needed some work doing but with a bit of magic and a trip to B&Q it would be easily done.
“I’m dropping Draco off now,” Harry says and emphasises my full name. “Are you coming back with me?”
This house just seemed empty and hollow now after imagining a life with Draco and our family. I didn’t even make it to the couch before i started crying again, I really don’t know what I’d do if this was it for us. I love that man so goddamn much! Maybe I have been working too much and spending too much time with friends rather than see him. But then again, he goes to see his friends when we could be spending time together, plus I’m allowed friends! He can't stop me from seeing then. But he hasn’t asked me to stop seeing them either. This is all my fault isn’t it? I need to give that house back and then go to Draco’s and tell him how sorry I am and how wrong I was to buy this house without asking him first. I was so wrapped up crying and arguing in my head that I didn’t realise how tired i was, and lying on the couch didn’t help that either. I was soon asleep in the living room, having not eaten since lunch and not feeling hungry in the slightest. I didn't even know what time it was but I guessed it must have been about 8pm.
“What is it, Draco?” he asks, as we are waiting for Weasley to fetch the car. How does he know I’m chewing something over in my mind? Is he a legilimens? He reaches up and pulls my chin.
“I’m sorry Draco, I really thought you had already told her. I don’t know why we hadn’t spoken of it though.”
As we are walking to the cafe, Nia and Teddy are ahead of us chatting and chasing each other, and me and Draco are strolling behind holding hands. For a second I imagine us older and Nia and Teddy as our children. One of which is still growing inside Draco. Life is good. I smile at Draco and lean over to kiss him sweetly. In this moment life is definitely good and I am very happy.
“No, in fact I don’t think he’s used any. He’s trying not to for chéri’s sake.” She nods and keeps checking him.
“I understand. A couple of letters came for you, and Blaise has been floo calling every hour on the hour. He looks desperate.”
“Hmm.” He tries to get up but I hold him down and shush him. “Harry? What’s… healer Bell?” He starts breathing hard and I shush him more.
“I would like to make a treehouse with the little chéri in this tree. When he’s old enough of course.” She adds after a glare from Draco.
I grab the bottle of firewhiskey off Blaise and head straight for the kitchen to get the shot glasses. I take a shot and turn to offer Blaise and Pans one. Pansy has her eyebrow raised and Blaise is just full on staring at me. I blush again and push their glasses towards them.
“Finally!” I squeeze him and ruffle his hair. “Hello cub. You okay?”  I kiss his head and move him onto my hips.
“What sort of basic training did you have in mind?” I ask, my voice slightly too high, betraying my wish to sound as natural , disinterested, and calm as I can with my hormones wreaking havoc through my body.
He kissed my hand again and places it back in my lap. He climbs out of the car, comes around to my side, and opens the passenger-side door. Why do I feel suddenly bereft? A lump forms in my throat. I must not let him see me like this. Fixing a smile on my face, I clamber out of the car and head up the path to the nearest alleyway, knowing I have to face Pansy, dreading facing Pansy. I turn and gaze at him midway. Chin up, Malfoy. I chide myself.
Following my more thorough examination of your issues, may I bring to your attention the definition of submissive.
15.10: Like loaning me out to someone else would ever be an option. But I’m glad it’s here in black and white.
“Much.”  I wrap my hands around his neck and bring his head forward for a snog. He hums into it and pulls back after a minute.
“Sorry grandma!” He says looking guilty behind him, then he looks at us. “Thank you so much uncle Harry! And thank you so much Uncle Draco!” Then he turns around and runs to Andy to show her his new broom.
I stand at the door a bit longer just watching them chat and smile. Then I click the door shut and leave them to go make the drinks.
“Since I was little, although we didn’t become close until starting at Hogwarts. She’s a really good friend.”
“Oh no you don’t! You are not getting one of those...those things! No way!” I tell him before he can think too much into it and make his mind up.
To the right of the stairs was four doors. The first one was on the left, which was just a big cupboard. The next was on the right. It was a square room and looked like it was a lounge area. The next on the right was another laundry room, smaller than the downstairs one. The last door straight ahead was the master bedroom. It was at the front of the house and was huge. It had a big en-suite with a massive bathtub and separate shower. This room needed quite a lot doing to it.
How can he seduce me solely with his voice? I’m panting already - my heated blood rushing through my veins, my nerves tingling.
“Harry, you need to breath. Take a deep breath and let it out. Follow my lead.” He begins taking deep breaths and after a few minutes I copy. I eventually calm down enough to breath properly and collapse on Draco crying.
The Order of the Phoenix is reinstated, Scorpius knows. He also knows that he is banned from it. He has a long, loud argument about it with Remus and Sirius.
The search for Horcruxes is unbearably slow. The days pass in monotony, slowly driving him insane with worry. He knows the rest of his family is okay – or he wants to think so, because he hasn’t ben able to talk to any of them since this bloody stupid fucking unbearable search started.
Draco rubs at his eyes furiously with the edge of his sleeve; he thought he’d be able to hold it together longer, but not with Ginny, not with his sister. It feels impossible to lie to her.
“Potter,” McGonagall says, placing a hand on his shoulder. “What Dumbledore said… you’re not going to have to die for this. I won’t allow it.”
He manages to shake his head. Her and Ron manage to get him up to the dorms to have more privacy, and Ron sits next to him.
“Mr. Weasley,” Lupin calls him after class one day. “I gather you’re having trouble with your Patronus?”
Scorpius survives Voldemort a second time, against all odds. Hugo nearly dies, but he and Rose pull him out of the chamber, and, afterwards, Madam Pomfrey says he’s going to make a full recovery.
The light is bright, and Draco squeezes his eyes shut with a flinch. He hears the cell door unlocking and opening, and he opens his eyes, even though they hurt, trying to get a good look at whoever it is that’s there. The relief he’d felt when seeing the light – he’s spent however long he’s been here wondering if he’d gone blind – is short-lived.
The kiss drags on for a few more seconds before Draco feels Harry’s tongue against his, and all he can think of is ‘oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck’.
Draco wants to stomp his foot. Of fucking course it bothers him! It makes him want to hex the professor, and the only reason Draco hasn’t done it is because he respects him a little bit too much to do that.
“What?” Harry says. He hasn’t stopped looking at Draco since they arrived, and though Ginny can pity the anxious state he’s evidently in, she doesn’t give a fuck; this is her
that she was perfect. She’d love you, no matter who you were, no matter where you came from and I knew that was my chance. I had to do it, otherwise I’d never let you go, and I couldn’t take you away from the Wizarding World, not when I loved it so much. I couldn’t make you live a life that wasn’t yours. So – so I asked her to hold you while I went to the bathroom and I left.” She swallows thickly. “It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I’ve been living in different parts of the world and I always kept up with you, darling, even if it would’ve been safer not to. I needed to know what was going on with you.”
At midnight, Ron and him go down to the common room, where Hermione’s already waiting for them, curled next to the fireplace. They sit quietly until Harry gets the nerve to speak.
In the dark, he finds her hand – burning in comparison to his, so cold he might be mistaken for a corpse – and they link their fingers together gently.
“You did more than anyone could’ve reasonably asked,” Draco tells him. He grabs his cheeks and kisses the top of his head, and then Harry kisses his temple. “You did more than you should’ve been responsible for.”
Harry looks up at him briefly before he looks away, towards the windows. They’re walking towards Herbology, and Ron can’t help bringing it up. “Yeah.”
“I’m… not sure.” He admits. “I thought I was, but he might’ve thought I was just being friendly? I don’t know.”
“We don’t know, either.” Ron says. “But Malfoy seems convinced that you’ll know. He’ll try to get you.”
He’s getting more and more worried that his feelings for her aren’t going away; instead, they’re increasing, and he doesn’t know how he didn’t realize it before. She’s a know-it-all and pestering at times, but she cares about everything she gets involved in, she’s passionate about her beliefs, she’s everything he’s ever going to want.
“And you’re just making it harder on yourself when the answer is much, much easier.” Zabini says with raised eyebrows.
“It’ll cause panic.” Snape is saying. Draco can’t see him, but he doesn’t really need to see much as long as he can hear them.
She evidently sees Draco’s and Harry’s confused faces, because she pets the pink thing in her arms and waves a hand.
“Now, Mr. Weasley.” McGonagall cocks an eyebrow in that way of hers that makes students back down as soon as she says so, but Draco frowns.
“Alright,” Mrs. Thomas nods, amicably enough. “But you two get on that, dear, it’s best to begin having kids as soon as possible.”
“No.” Draco shakes his head, and Harry’s stomach sinks. “No. While you were in there, I was thinking, and - I want to have children with you. I do, Harry. Whether we adopt them or if I get pregnant, I don’t care. I want it with you, all of it. The rest of our lives.”
“Shut the fuck up, Potter.” He says, voice shaking, lower lip quivering. “You’re the worst of them all. I told you – I
“I saw you once, actually.” She says. “We met in France. Molly took you to meet me, with your siblings.” And he thinks that may sound familiar. His mum had introduced him to her once, he thinks, said she was his aunt, where he got his blond hair from. “We stayed for a few days in a hotel, and you told me you loved Puffskeins.”
“Draco…” I swim up to him and hold him up. He looks like he is either going to faint or be sick. He puts his arms around my neck and I grab under his legs and carry him out of the pool. I lay him on one of the beds and knee down next to him.
My eyes widen slightly and I glance up. He gives me an encouraging but wry smile. “It gives me a clue as to what you are thinking.” He breathes. “You’re a mystery Mr Malfoy.”
“Nothing.” I smiled at her. Then looked down and realised I was still in bed in only my boxers and my best mates girlfriend was on top of me hugging me. I blushed and asked, “hey, where’s Ron.”
“Don’t tell me, you’ve managed to not get kicked out for another week.” I joke and he scowls playfully at me.
“Okay, I’ll clean this up and then come get you.” I change the bed again and spell the mess away, then head back to the bathroom. Draco has stopped being sick and is learning on the bathroom sink. Then he grabs it with white knuckles and starts breathing heavily. “Ahhhh.” He cries and leans forward. I go over and rub his back gently, while shushing him and kissing his neck.
“Right that’s it! You are telling me everything right now. What is going on? Are you ill? Have you been to the doctors?...are you dying?” I have to ask that last bit because it’s just like Draco to know he’s dying and not tell me. My eyes start watering and all I can think is ‘what am i going to do without him.’ Draco looks gobsmacked and has stopped eating holding a sausage on his fork. But then I realise it's not me that’s made him stop, it's the sausage. He throws his covers back and runs to the bathroom again, this time locking the door to prevent me from entering.
“Yes I know, but it’s got Malfoy blood.” She holds a box out to Draco and he unwraps it. I look at him but he just shrugs to say he doesn’t know either. Then he opens it and smiles at his mother.
He leans down to kiss me but pauses before his lips touch mine, his eyes searching mine, wanting, asking permission. I raise my lips to his, and he kisses me, and because I don't know if I’ll ever kiss him again, I let go - my hands moving of their own accord and twisting into his hair, pulling him to me, my mouth opening, my tongue stroking his. His hand grasps the nape of my neck as he deepens the kiss, responding to my ardor. His other hand slides down my back and flattens at the base of my spine as he pushes me against his body.
I go into our bedroom and close the door softly. Draco is just putting Leo down to sleep. I go over and kiss his head too.
What does he mean by that? Our negotiations? Our, er…...relationship…..whatever that is? He’s still so cryptic. I grab my wand out of my bag and serve up the breakfast. see, I can use magic too.  I hunt in the fridge and find some syrup.
He frowns. “You’d think I’d coerce you into something you don't want to do, and then pretend that I have a legal hold over you?”
“Come on, Draco, again.” he growls through clenched teeth, and unbelievably, my body responds, squeezing him tight as I cum again, calling his name. I shatter again into tiny fragments, and Harry stills, finally letting go, silently finding his release. He collapses on top of me, breathing hard.
Hermione opens the door and gives me a strange look as if to say ‘what the hell are you doing here looking so gloomy when you should be celebrating with Draco’. I guess me and Hermione could read each other too.
“I don’t really know Nia.” I tell her and look at Draco. “I think it’s time to get back in touch with McGonagall.” He groans but I know he knows I’m right.
Me and Nia start sorting the bigger things and the food. Then George and Angelina and baby Fred arrive to set up the fireworks.
“No, Draco. No Xbox. No PlayStation. Come.” He stands up and holds his hand out for me. He pulls me up and holds me close. Then he apparates us.
“Oh….please.” I whisper. I try to stiffen my legs as my body goes rigid. I am in a sexual thrall to this man, and he doesn't let me move.
“So at 11 weeks you might feel a bit hungrier. You will start showing, which I see you already have.” He really has started to show properly now, it’s quite noticeable. I don’t know how longs he’s going to be able to hide this. “You will still be tired, probably through the pregnancy. But your sickness should at least reduce in the next couple of weeks, which is good news. Do you have any questions?”
“Well, I’m sure Dobby will get them out.” He swishes his hand and the sheets fly into the wash basket and new ones are put on. Does he ever use a wand?
“I mean, not right now because it's a mess.” He chuckles and carries on, “ But eventually yes, of course. And I’m even a bit excited to restore it ourselves.”
“It doesn’t matter now Hermione. I’m here and you need to push. You can do this,you are Hermione Jean Granger!” She nods with me and starts pushing.
“You’re back! Where’s Harry? How are you?” Her voice is fevered, anxious, and she bounds up to me, grabbing my shoulders, minutely analysing my face before I’ve even said hello.
An hour later, I was back at grimmauld place. I had sent Draco a patronus back at Hagrids because I couldn’t make him wait.
“Harry!? Where are you!?” Draco shouts from around the corner. I head out of the greenhouse and shout back.
That Saturday it was finally time to hear Ron and Hermione’s news. I was very excited to find out what it was, George had gone around us all placing bets between a baby, an engagement, and a new house. I put my money on engagement but Draco said baby, which surprised me.  Draco had agreed to come but said he’d meet me there. So after I had had a shower and gotten ready into a casual shirt and a clean pair or black jeans, I went over to the fireplace and shouted the leaky cauldron. With a flash of green I was in the pub. I didn’t have to look long before I could see a flash of red heads. I went over to the table and was greeted by everyone. Luna and Ginny were there, Neville and Hannah, George and Angelina, Dean, and Ron. Luna and Ginny had gotten together about 6 months ago adn when asked about it Ginny ha just said “If you can be gay, why can’t I?” And walked off, to which Luna apologised and went after her.
We get to the elevator and wait for it. I look up at him and he looks at me through the corner of his eyes. This makes me smile and his lips twitch.
silver-grey woven tie that leaves small impressions of its weave on my skin. He moves so quickly, sitting astride me as he fastens my wrists together, but this time, he ties the other end of the tie to the headboard of my bed. He pulls at my binding, checking it’s secure. I’m not going anywhere. I’m tied, literally, to my bed, and I’m so aroused.
“Can you just bare with me tonight?” He asks gently then, having calmed down. I nod my head. “Let’s just get through tonight please, I’m really sorry.” He genuinely sounds it and so I forget it all and we go back to the party.
“Yeah I do, I’m on leave at the minute. But I don’t think I’m going back. It’s a lot of stress for Draco as well as me. So from now until you graduate, teaching you is my job.”
“Yeah, I should see where Hermione is. Congratulations by the way.” He slaps my back and goes off to find Hermione.
“Okay..okay.” He says quietly and looks down. “I...I don’t believe I deserve to be a part of your family Harry.”
“... So now they all know he’s pregnant and Ron just walked off and Draco’s locked me out.” I tell her, she is awfully quiet so I look up and she looks pale. “Are you okay Narcissa?”
He inhales sharply and I cringe so hard. Shit! How can I tell him that I’m just reading the questions? Damn Pansy and her curiosity!
“You are shitting me! The richest, most elusive, most enigmatic bachelor in the UK gave you his number and floo?!”
“I’m going to take you from behind, Draco.” he murmurs, and with his other hand, he grasps my hair in a fist and pulls gently, holding me in place. I cannot move my head. I am pinioned beneath him, helpless.
“Oh right yeah, sun cream.” Hermione passes him soon and he lathers himself in it and lies back down.
“Yeah mate, calm down. It’s only Malfoy, why’re you getting yourself so worked up?” Ron raised an eyebrow at me very suspiciously.
Until very recently. My brain supplies very unhelpfully. NO! I banish the thought and remember the mortifying interview. Are you gay, Mr Potter? I cringe at the memory and shake my head. I know I’ve dreamt about him since but it’s just my subconscious trying to give me nightmares, surely.
When I had eventually calmed Draco down enough to get up, I helped him through to the bedroom and got him back in bed. After moving the sausages away from him. He said he wasn’t hungry anymore anyway so I told him to just drink the fresh orange juice to which he happily agreed. I went downstairs and straight over to the floo. I chucked some powder in and shouted st mungos. The receptionist answered almost immediately in a small bored voice.
“But that’s the whole point of family Draco. They are there to support you and help you when life goes wrong.” He looks at me and gives a small smile.
I can’t bring myself to even consider the food list. I swallow hard, my mouth dry, and read it again.
“Okay, now we can go.” I grab the bag off her and help her back downstairs. Then we take the floo to st mungos.
Then there is another finger trying to gain access. I cry out and he squeezes my cock to distract me. He takes it slow and soon he has both fingers in and scissoring them to stretch me out. After a while I realise that there are three fingers in me and try to remember when that happened.
“Oh, Draco, what I could do to you.” he whispers. He removes my other shoe and sock, then stands and removes my jeans completely. I’m lying on his bed dressed only in my boxers, and he’s staring down at me.
“Stop with the bullshit Hermione. Draco is over there nearly in tears, refusing to come near the house and thinking you hate him!” That last bit got a reaction out of her. Finally. I don’t like shouting at Hermione but i am not in the mood for this right now. Her eyebrows shot up and she opened her mouth to mimic an o.
“You feel so good.” he groans, and my legs start to shake with need. He pulls back and waits. “Oh no, baby, not yet.” he murmurs, and as the shaking stops, he starts the whole delicious process again.
“Keep still.” he orders, his voice soft but urgent, and strokes up once more and releases. Before I can complain, he has inserted two fingers into me and has instantly found my prostate. He rubs his fingers around and around it and the effect is mind blowing. All my energy concentrating on this one small space inside my body. I moan.
want to feed the world. I desperately rack my brains to remember what Pansy had written in her article. Adopted at age four, I think. I can’t imagine that Lily starved him, so it must have been before then, as a little boy. I swallow, my heart constricting at the thought of a hungry, green-eyed toddler.
Other names for Hermione and Ron are : Amelia, Isabelle, Emily, Monica after Hermione's mother, and rose after her grandmother.
There’s a knock on the door and then, without giving time to answer, Harry walks in. I can’t seem to find my voice and one look at him gets my heart pounding. Oh merlin...he’s all sweaty.
I want to touch him. I move my hands and rather awkwardly, given I’m restrained, feel his hair. He stops kissing me and glares up at me, shaking his head from side to side, tutting as he does. He reaches for my hands and places them above my head again.

“Well I’m just finishing this lesson up and then how about I show you and grandma around?” I ask Teddy. He nods quickly and I chuckle.
“I think my water broke…” he says, sounding tired. Then he gasps and leans forward while holding his back. “Contraction!” He groans out. I grab his hand and rub his back until it passes.
“My room? You’re expecting me to move in?” I can’t hide the horror in my voice. Is he fucking serious?!
“Can we all say a cheers for Nia - she is finally an honorary witch, having finally passed all her exams.” Everyone claps and cheers and Nia takes a bow. “I believe you have been knighted by the sorting hat?” I ask her, a bit slurry after a few drinks.
I laughed and shook my head. “I know no such thing.”  I winked at him jokingly, he was gonna get a telling off tonight, but he deserved it for calling Draco ferret.
“Well I like flying and it allowed me to think before and after the interview. Besides, the interview ran over so I made good time considering.” I drop my bag on the coffee table and take out the recorder for her. She grabs it out of my hand and beams a smile at me.
“Well she should have stopped going on about her perfect pregnancy then!” He turns and shouts at me.
“You invest in manufacturing with muggles. Why, specifically?” I ask and glance back at him. Why is he making me so uncomfortable and what's with the staring.
“Stop biting your lip, or I will take you back in and fuck you, whether Weasley comes looking or not.”
“I never knew.” Is all he says through his shaky voice. I look at Hermione and give her the nod that I’m okay and I'll handle this. She puts a hand on my cheek and gives me a small smile and then leaves back through the floo. I sit down next to Draco on the sofa and put my head on his shoulder and curl up on him.
He eventually gets in the bath and I sit on the toilet seat next to him, stroking his protruding belly. After I’ve helped him wash and made him feel relaxed, I sit back down for a while. Then I grab the small box off the table. “I know you're going to see your arse, but…. I got you something.” He frowns at me and stops playing with my hair.
“He’s doing a lot better thanks. Katie said the baby is perfect and as long as Draco keeps up with the potions and relaxing, then everything will be fine. How’s Hermione.” I tell him and he smiles.
I am still panting, trying to slow my breathing, my thumping heart, and my thoughts are in riotous disarray. Wow…...that was astounding. I open my eyes, and he has his forehead pressed against mine, his eyes closed, his breathing ragged. Harry’s eyes flicker open and gaze down at me, dark but soft. He is still inside of me. Leaning down, he gently presses a kiss against my forehead then slowly pulls out of me.
“Oh I’m Hermione and I hardly ever get morning sickness, and my bump will always be small so I won’t get big and fat like you, oh and we have baby names picked out already, and we are just perfect.” He says in a voice mimicking Hermione.“Meanwhile I was practically dying and I’m pretty sure I can see a bump already!” He says and pulls his top up. He’s right, there it is. The tiniest bump, unrecognisable if I hadn’t been up close and personal with his stomach a thousand times. I drop to my knees in front of him then and place my hands on either side of his stomach while staring wide eyed.

Learning down, he kisses me, his lips tender against mine, and his weight shifts off the bed. I hear the quiet creak of the bedroom door. Get a drink.
“She seems nice.” I say to Draco. He just hmms to that and stares out the window. I open my mouth to say something but he interrupts.
I couldn’t have been asleep long when I felt a warm body curl up next to me and a blanket placed on top of me. I squinted my eyes open as much as I could with how tired I was. And there he was, my Draco. This must be a dream.
We eventually finish painting and the room looks great. We are stood at the door with our arms around each other, imagining the dinners we will have in here. I kiss the top of Draco’s head and turn us around to head to the next room. But we both stop because Nia is stood at the door.
“Wow - Ethan! How lovely to see you. Severus, this is Ethan, Pansy’s brother. Ethan, this is my godfather, Severus Snape.” They shake hands, Severus coolly assessing Ethan.
“I’m sure I can….erm, lend you one. Get your things, we’ll drive back to Scotland and grab some lunch on the way. I need to dress.”
“Yeah it will be fine, Katie said you can go in. Where did Draco go?” He points down the hall and goes into the office.
“The ownership thing, that’s just terminology and goes back to the principle of obeying. It’s to get you into the right frame of mind, to understand where I’m coming from.

“Speaking of Leo, you really need to make a birth plan. Like right now. In fact that's what we are going to do right now.” I pull him to the kitchen table and sit him down.
One of the professors rises, and we begin the long, tedious process of collecting our degrees. It takes over an hour before I hear my name. I make my way up to the stage between the two giggling girls. Harry gazes down at me, his look warm but guarded.
We were there for another 2 hours, chatting and eating and laughing. Then we floo back to grimmauld.
“You’ll call me if you want to do the photo shoot?” Once again he’s all business. I nod and hand him his change back and he puts it all in my tip jar.
I shake my head and roll my eyes at myself. Get a grip, Malfoy. I look around and try to figure out how old this guy is. The building is clinical and modern so I’m guessing Potter is in his forties and that he’s fit, tanned, and fair haired, like most of his employees.
“It was, wasn’t it?” She beams. “Are you coming? He can be very insistent.” She rolls her eyes, and I grin.
When I finally come to a stop I open my eyes and find frantic green ones staring back at me. Harry Potter is on top of me, with his chest against mine, while we are both breathing heavily. I distinctly notice he smells of laundered lining and expensive body wash. It is intoxicating and I breathe in deeply.
“Harry james potter, I swear to merlin. You never listen to me!”  Before he can say anything else, I shove the box at him.
“I’m a very private person, Mr Malfoy. I go a long way to protect my privacy. I don’t often give wizarding interviews….”
“I guess you didn’t get to sleep?” I ask him. He shakes his head and huffs, burying himself further into the pillows.
“Come on then. But shush, uncle Dracos asleep.” I lie back down and Draco rolls back over to cuddle me. Then Teddy cuddles up to me on the other side and I fall back to sleep quickly.

“That was my dad's broom. He was magic. But he sent me away with it and an old chest and never came back.” She was crying now. “Please don’t hurt me.”
“Okay.” Is all I say and he smiles at me because he knows that he doesn’t need to make an argument. He knows I want to know just as much as him.
We go into the first room, which isn’t as bad as some of the house but will absolutely take all day to just clean. So we get started with some spells around the place. When they hardly do anything, we turn to good old fashioned elbow grease. I start with scraping the mouldy wallpaper off the walls and Draco starts with cleaning the windows. We did a couple of spells on them and they don’t need replacing but do need a damn good scrub.
“Has he used any strenuous magic today?” She sounds a bit less worried now and Harry calms even more.
“Hey! Who said we didn’t sleep together!” I smirked as both of them blushed. “He might have left for work or something.” I played on it but then I saw Hermione's brain working.
I've also been thinking about everything Harry said. He mentions some kind of written paperwork, and I don’t know if he was joking or he is actually going to make me sign something. It's so frustrating trying to guess. But on top of all the angst, I can barely contain my excitement or my nerves. Tonight is the night! Am I ready for this? Of course I’m ready! I am ready for anything with Harry Potter, but I still don’t know what he sees in me….plain Draco Malfoy, it makes no sense.
“Hello Harry. I’m good thank you, not as bad as Draco with his morning sickness but it comes and goes. I was just telling Draco that I haven’t told a soul yet, not even Ron. I know not to tell anyone yet and i wouldn’t want to tell everyone your secret anyway. That’s for the two of you to share when you're ready.”
“No. I haven't signed anything yet, so I think I’ll hang on to my free will for a bit longer, if that’s okay with you.”
“Yeah. He screamed at me, Hermione. He was so angry, like we were back in Hogwarts. He just never wants to take the next step with us and I don’t think I can carry on like this. We never see each other and it's so shit!” Great now I’m tearing up thinking of losing Draco. I wipe my eyes and look at her. “Maybe this whole house thing was a mistake.”
The power of speech has deserted me. I want the ground to swallow me up. Harry puts his arm around me, his thumb skimming up under my untucked shirt and caressing my hip, before his hand clasps my shoulder.
I can barely contain myself, lying helpless, watching him move gracefully around my room. It’s a heady aphrodisiac. Slowly, almost leisurely, he removes his shoes and socks, undoes his pants, and lifts his shirt over his head.
“It was good, Pans. very good, I think.” I say quietly, trying to hide my embarrassed tell-all smile.
I see her pants are wet too now and I unfreeze and run to the floo. There is no answer at his office and then I remember that Hermione said he had been called out. I call head auror Robards and tell him what’s happened. He tells me he will try to get hold of Ron but it may take a while. So I tell him to send Ron straight to st mungos. Hermione wants her baby born in the hospital, whereas Draco still hasn’t decided.
“Nothing!” Me and Teddy said at the same time. We chuckle at each other and I put him down so we can go into the house.
“Mrs Robinson!” He laughs loudly, freely, and he looks so young and carefree, his head thrown back, his laughter infectious.
“Let’s see if we can make you come like this.” he whispers, continuing his slow, sensual assault. My nipples bear the delicious brunt of his deft fingers and lips, setting alight every single nerve ending so that my whole body sings with sweet agony. He just doesn't stop.
Today was going to be another hard day. We still had to finish the dining room and talk to Nia, if she would let us, and get started on the next room. Draco’s feeling quite tired still, so has promised to take it easy today and no heavy magic.
Draco’s sitting with his friends in the Hufflepuff table, and he looks distracted. Harry tears his eyes away and finds Hermione looking at him thoughtfully.
“Not as - a date or anything.” He stumbles both over his words and over his feet, and he’d fall on his face if it weren’t the fact that Rose grabs the back of his jumper to stop him. “Thanks. As friends. I don’t feel anything for you that way.”
Lupin seems more relaxed. “Okay. Now come on. Since we’re going to have so many dementors flying around, you’ll need to learn the Patronus charm a bit earlier than I had planned. We’ll need more space.”
Narcissa smiles gently, and she runs a gentle hand through Draco’s hair. He lets out a pained sound.
“You don’t have to choose now, Draco.” Malfoy says. He extends a hand and gives Draco a Floo address. “Call when you’ve made up your mind.
he thought they would feel, but he doesn’t think anything could’ve prepared him for the pain of it. “Greyback keeps threatening to bite me, but he never does. I think he’s not allowed. Voldemort keeps him like a dog.”
“One year!” She exclaims. “Good! Making it through the first year is the hardest I tell you, I wanted to
“Draco, Draco, shush,” Harry says soothingly, pulling Draco into him, wrapping his arms around him and feeling how frantic Draco’s breathing’s turned. “It’s alright. You don’t have to get pregnant. We could always just – adopt, you know? Or
McGonagall’s eyes flash angrily in the same way Draco’s did this morning, and Harry almost feels like laughing. The pounding pain running across his scar stops him though. It hasn’t stopped hurting since it flashed while they were in the middle of their visit to Dumbledore.
Draco hands him the letter. He’s been carrying it around in his pocket for weeks now, too scared that someone will go through his things and find it.
“And he was talking about Malfoy’s son and how he was raised by blood-traitors, and I realized it was Draco and they were talking about taking him somewhere-” she looks a bit ashamed. “And when he went to sleep I placed a tracking charm on his wand.”
“They can be happy!” Ron says. “I just don’t like my best mate snogging my baby brother when I’m eating!”
“But he didn’t!” Parkinson screams. “The Dark Lord didn’t until you told him you unbelievable piece of-”
“Alright.” Hermione nods. “And Hufflepuff’s cup might be here, too, but we’re not certain. We’re trying to track down the rest of the Horocruxes, and McGonagall’s found most of them, except for Riddle’s diary, Slytherin’s Locket, and Marvolo Gaunt’s ring. We think they might be hidden in Malfoy Manor.”
“Eight for a wish, nine for a kiss, ten a surprise you should not miss,” she’s sounding more and more panicked by the moment, and her grip on his arm is tightening, but he doesn’t know what’s going on, how to help. “Eleven for health, twelve for wealth, thirteen beware it’s the devil himself.”
“I can’t tell.” Draco says, tone resigned. Harry doesn’t know if he’s telling the truth. For a single, terrifying moment, he thinks,
Potter smiles back, frowning lightly, and as soon as he goes back in, Draco hits his head against the wall repeatedly.
“Tomorrow afternoon, against Ravenclaw.” Ginny says. “But all of his teammates would be there, someone’s bound to notice us!”

“Stop that.” Harry hisses with difficulty. He’s trying to concentrate, but it’s not helping; he can’t stop Snape.
Aaaaaaaaaahhh okay, so after all this time, this is the end! Honestly, for the last few chapters I've had a love-hate relationship with this fic, but I'm honestly incredibly sad to see it end :(
It’s too quiet, but everyone hears it anyway. They all hug at the same time, and though still uncomfortable, Draco looks somewhat relieved. Then he sees Harry.
Though Mrs. Zabini has always kept herself carefully neutral in most political situations, Draco thinks it might be different during a war, even to a woman like her, who’s always liked to keep everything very private.
“You both love Draco,” She says. “And we’re all worried about him. You think either of you are marching towards whatever place he’s in heroically? You’re
“I know you are,” he says, pride swelling in his chest. Then, he teases, “Must’ve had a great teacher.”
“Have you gotten into Potter’s pants yet?” Is the first thing Blaise asks when he comes into the train compartment.
“No!” He says immediately. Everyone looks at him, and his face goes even redder. “I mean, no, we’re not sleeping together! We’re just sleeping together!”
“A little over ten months.” Pansy says. “And there’re records,” she takes out medical records with the official St. Mungo’s stamp. “That show-”
Harry doesn’t see Voldemort between his death eaters; he expected it. The bastard’s too much of a coward to show up. He’s eager to see Draco, because he hasn’t seen him since the beginning. He assumes Hermione and Ron are still struggling with the cup, and the rest of the students are blending together in his mind.
all along?” his mind is reeling. “You were talking about Horocruxes, weren’t you?” Snape goes gray, and that’s as much confirmation as Harry needs. “You’ve lost them. You don’t know where they are, do you-”
today and - I hate you, Potter, but Draco’s going to have my head the moment I die if I let anything happens to you. That’s why. I know you’ve been wondering.”
“It’s fine,” Ginny soothes after he fails, yet again. “It’s very complicated. There are plenty of people who haven’t been able to do it.”
“Draco!” Blaise Zabini’s a Slytherin his year, and though they’re not in the same house, him and Pansy Parkinson are Draco’s best friends.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Their mother says softly, but Ginny’s having none of it. She’s been furious ever since she lost Draco on their visit to Hogsmeade, and Ron knows she’ll relax – they all will – the moment Draco’s alright, but as of right then, they’ve been in St. Mungo’s for over four hours, and he still hasn’t woken up.
Because Narcissa Malfoy died and Lucius Malfoy was in Azkaban, the manor has sat untouched for years, and everything is still in place. Things are covered in thick layers of dust and spiderwebs – Draco
They sneak out of the dorm – not an easy thing to do with Hannah Abbott and Ernie MacMillan right in the common room reading books to the first years to calm them down – but they manage anyway.
"Draco Malfoy, I swear to God-” Hermione snaps under her breath, causing Draco to laugh lowly as he ducks under a hanging plant pot.
Pansy shrugs. “You can call me hopeless all you like, but if you cook for me I’ll literally cry of joy.”
Hermione seems to hesitate. “No, it’s fine. There’re a few things I wanted to talk to you about. Can we talk Friday afternoon?”
They’re all here. Hermione, Pansy, Blaise, Gin, Ron, Harry. They keep giving him cautious looks like he might run away.
“What do you have for us, Fletcher?” Ginny asks impatiently. She doesn’t like being here with Draco; he’s her baby brother, and she doesn’t feel quite certain on her ability to protect him here, so she always tries to get them out as soon as possible.
“Well, we won’t speak of Potter anymore, then.” Pansy says. She pulls her feet up on Blaise’s lap, and he pulls his feet onto Draco’s lap on the seat in front, and Draco rests his feet on the seat. “Are you guys hungry? I’m famished.”
I love them. But if you’re not sure – look, it’s a big change, alright? I’m constantly sick, my home office has been turned into a fort I can’t take down because they’ll cry, they wake me at five in the morning by poking me in the eye, and I haven’t watched grown up TV for
Potter’s mouth tightens for a split second, and Draco thinks he’s going to tell him where to shove it.
, not here, not in the middle of a war. Nothing short of stopping it is enough, because Draco’s seen the horrors that the death eaters do, first hand, and nothing that he’s done has stopped them; it feels like nothing he
The streets are empty, and in hindsight, Draco really could’ve waited until tomorrow to get comfort candy.
want it, it’s just – at home, everyone is used to him; they know he’s a huge nerd, that he’s shy, that he needs glasses but forgets them more often than not, that he’s allergic to nuts and cacao and that he has dragon slippers that roar when he walks. Here, people either ignore him – which he’s fine with – or stare at him like he’s some all-powerful wizard because of what happened when he was a baby.
for revenge. He never wants to stop this, never wants  Greyback  to stop feeling like this, to feel even a
“Do you want to stand in the dance floor and pretend to dance just so I can hold you very close to me without having your mum smack me with a spoon?” Harry rectifies, and, despite himself, Draco smiles lightly.
“Parkinson!” Harry snaps, and Ron realizes Parkinson and Zabini are standing there, looking worriedly. “What the bloody hell is going on?”
Draco’s steadying himself for whatever torture they’ve come up with today, but, instead of being taken to the dining room – the only room he’s been allowed to see apart from the dungeons – he’s walked past that.
“Hey Har’!” And really, Harry loves Ron, but something inside him definitely doesn’t appreciate the interruption. “Hey Draco!”
“Don’t,” Harry’s eye snap up at the unknown voice, and there’s a blonde woman by the doorway. She looks a lot like Draco. “There’s no time. Get the girl from the dungeons. You need to get out of here.”
with him. And then proceeded to run away and avoid Harry for the life of him. Merlin, but Harry hates him.
Blaise’s is a sleek black panther that prowls around proudly, knocking Draco on his arse more than once.
Okay, so he stress eats. So sue him. It doesn’t happen often, and even if it did, he’s fine. He can eat whatever the bloody hell he wants. His mom’s sweaters are big enough that no one would ever notice even if he gained weight, which he never does, and it’s not like anybody’s ever going to see him naked.
a date. He's not going to just have sex with Theo, not with Harry in the picture. Or at least Harry wants to believe.
He cuts the envelope open, and takes the letter out carefully. It’s multiple pages long, and Draco frowns as he begins reading.
It’s said with as much impertinence as he can get away with. He doesn’t know if Lupin is amused, or angry, or worried, but he merely sighs and nods, and so Draco turns on his heel.
Draco’s squeezing at his finger under the table – it’s wrapped hastily in a napkin because the blasted owl bit him, and it’s still bleeding – and straightens instinctively when every adult in the room turns to him.
“I’m serious!” she says. “It’s the perfect opportunity! He’s your brother’s best friend, he’s staying at your house! Just wear something slutty around the house.”
“Really?” Blaise asks, disbelieving. “You thought you’d bake him something and he’d magically understand you like him?!”
Draco nods jerkily. There’s a few seconds of silence in which Ron takes in Draco’s face fully. His nose is still bleeding, and his lower lip is split. There’s a cut across his right eyebrow, and there’s a quickly darkening bruise around his right eye. There are bruises on his jaw, and a small cut across one of his cheekbones.
“Ron, I figured it wasn’t my place.” She says, looking away and brushing her hair away from her face. “I didn’t-”
She gives no explanation, but the prefects do as she tells them. They respect her enough to do what she says without further question. She’s earned it.
“And have him be unhappy for the rest of his life?” he asks. “That’s its own kind of death, and if Draco was going to die I was not going to be the one to do it.” Scorpius swallows. “And now I look at you, and – it's like I'm seeing a ghost, every day. And then you almost
, and Harry wants so badly to stay there. He thinks of Sirius and Remus, thinks of Ron, and Hermione, and Ginny, and knows he can’t, even if he wants to.
“A thirty inch essay?” she scoffs, giving him a look, dusting dirt and filth off her robes. She’s wearing dark, plain robes, with a hood that allows her to hide her face. He’s wearing a similar attire. Their resemblance to death eaters isn’t accidental; fear really motivates people to give them what they want. “That was your excuse?”
“Mum and dad are going to be here soon,” Ron tells her, oblivious to Ginny’s mental turmoil. It’s alright; he loves both Draco and Ginny – they all do – but none of them understand them like they do each other. “Fred, George, Bill, Charlie, Fleur. The Order of the Phoenix. This isn’t your responsibility.”
to know. He doesn’t know what could’ve been with his birth parents; it couldn’t have possibly been any better than what he has right now; His family loves him, and Draco loves them back, and he knows with unwavering certainty that he’ll die for them before he does a god damned thing for Lucius Malfoy.
“You did?” Draco asks, surprised. His parents had been furious, along with practically every teacher, except Flitwick. He’d mostly been impressed at Draco’s, Pansy’s, and Blaise’s charm work. He’d given them House points for it, in secret.
He sees him throw concerned glances at him once in a while, but Draco resolutely ignores them and tightens his jaw every time it happens. By the time the wedding comes, Draco’s jaw is painfully tight.
“Oh.” Draco’s heart flutters. “Well, what I mean is that it’s okay if you’re not. Fine. It’d be… understandable.”
“Well…” She hesitates, but finally takes a deep breath and begins talking. “Muggles have done studies on genetics. It’s science, and – well, it helps when you’re going to have a baby. You can calculate odds of them having a certain eye color, or hair color, or other traits. I saw it in school, before Hogwarts, and then we met, and, uh… it’d be impossible for him to be blond if he was born from two red-headed parents who also had two red-headed parents.”
They push through the crowd of students, and when he catches sight of white-blond hair, he knows his gut feeling was right.
The sheets are still warm, but the bed’s empty, and Harry sits up, halfway panicked. He scrambles to put his glasses on, and then he pulls his drapes open.
Harry doesn’t know exactly what had changed. Maybe it had been one too many late nights for both of them, or how much time they spent together after they’d been paired up as dueling partners, both the top of their class. Harry had thought he’d greatly enjoy the chance to knock Draco on his arse – and he had, thoroughly – but he’d also been grudgingly respecting of the fact that Draco had been the only person to last more than two minutes dueling Harry. They’d dueled nearly an hour before Draco had slipped up.
There’s a creak on the stairs, and everyone turns to look. Blonde hair. Grey eyes. The love of Harry’s life.
“Why do you still call me Potter?” His voice has already taken to a more sleepy and far-away tone. He’s placed his glasses beside his head on the pillow, and Draco moves them so they won’t get crushed if he moves around.
“I’m telling him, I didn’t think I wanted kids, either,” Mrs. Thomas says excitedly. “But then you have them inside you, and you love them! I mean, I cried every day of my pregnancy, and I couldn’t move and had to be on bedrest for two months, and I got a horrible infection while giving birth, but in the end I got my own little Sophie!”
“It’s alright,” he says again. He hadn’t been sleeping – Draco had fallen asleep in the middle of their muggle telly marathon – so he’d caught the nightmare early. “It’s alright. It was just a nightmare.”
“Maybe.” Malfoy says, cocking his head. “Tell me, Draco, does it mean something that all of your friends know?”
"Good morning and Welcome to Florean Fortescue's," Says Florean Fortescue with a smile. Draco appreciates that he's always cheery. "What can I get you?"
“Granger put a tracking spell on your wand, before you went missing.” Blaise continues. “That’s what we were doing, when you saw me and Potter in my bed together. We weren’t going to – I would never – I wouldn’t, Draco.”
That’s all they do the whole day, all other classes are cancelled. Ginny achieves hers – a stallion – and so do several other people, like the Patil twins, all of Draco’s roommates, and Pansy and Blaise.
“I doubt it,” Draco says, and he begins to stand up, but Smith grabs his wrist and pulls him down roughly, very nearly making Draco fall. “Merlin, what the fuck?!”
When he encounters Greyback – leaning over Lavender Brown, whose face is scratched badly, but she’s alive – Greyback flashes bloodied teeth at him. He’d been drawn to the empty hall by the screams.
Ron, Potter, and Granger stand close together, and Draco sees Potter’s holding a piece of parchment in one hand and some sort of silver cloak on the other. Before he can ask about either, someone speaks.
“He’s a Weasley.” Molly says fiercely. “He’s ours, and he’ll always be, no matter what he was born as.”
He looks around to try to find the alley where he came from, and he steels, heart beating in his ears, as he sees someone staring at him from across the street. The woman is tall, and she’s looking at Draco like it hurts her to do so.
“It’s not your business!” Draco stands angrily; he’s shorter than Ron, but when he stands he can at least not be properly looked down on. “You don’t even care!”
They’re walking past a narrow alley when a house elf runs between them, pressing a small coin to Draco’s hand. Everything spins around him, and the next thing he knows he’s rolling down the steps of an alley, landing flat on his arse.
There are old home movies, soundless; his favorite one is the video of his first time in a ferry, in his dad’s arms while his father filmed. He's watched it enough times he could recreate it in his sleep, the way his dad grinned, the kiss his father pressed to his forehead before sitting next to him and waving at the camera, so he recognizes them in the mirror before he recognizes himself.
He tries to stay close to him, at first, but there are too many people screaming, too many bodies on the floor –
Adam rolls his eyes. “Well, yeah. But I mean, who cares about Potter that could cause the feast to be dismissed and the aurors to be worried?”
Draco doesn’t really know what to say. He’d introduce himself, but the woman seems to already know his name, so he doesn’t.
Harry nods as he ushers her out of the room, closing the door after she’s gone. He sighs, turning back to look at Draco.
“What?” Scorpius asks, frantically trying to remember where he put his wand; he doesn’t think the professor will hurt him, not really, but at the same time, it’s more than a little disquieting to wake and find him staring at him in his dorm while everyone else is asleep.
The woman’s pale blonde hair is pulled back in a low pony tail, hair long and wavy like Draco’s is, and her face is covered in freckles. Draco’s freckles only come out when he’s been in the sun for a long time, and since he lives in Britain that doesn’t happen often.
He yelps, and Ginny’s laugh echoes even as she runs out of the room. He grabs his wand from under his pillow and chases after her. They run down the stairs, past their parents’ room, then past the dining room – the table’s full, but Draco doesn’t bother to stop – and finally Draco corners her in the kitchen, pointing his wand at her menacingly.
Draco shrugs. “A few. I’m getting better at reading the abysmal handwriting. I’ve tried to trace magical signature, but whoever’s writing them isn’t using magic. At least I don’t think they are, but it’s hard doing it when I only learned how to three weeks ago.”
“We were in Malfoy Manor.” Luna says. Narcissa pulls back from her, having healed her, and sits on her heels. She moves towards the couch uncertainly, putting a hand on Draco’s calf. Molly’s eyes flash with something akin to possessiveness, but she says nothing. Narcissa doesn’t remove her hand. “They were trying to find something, and they thought Draco knew where it was.”
It’s quick, and it’s brutal. Draco thinks Harry’s already left until he catches sight of green eyes, looking straight at him, shouting something that Draco doesn’t understand. It’s only a second of distraction, but it’s also his downfall.
Draco was thinking of the same Christmas Potter just mentioned. Him and Ginny were the only ones not at Hogwarts yet, and Charlie and Bill came home for it, so that Christmas was the first time they saw their whole family together in a long time.
Draco sees Hermione’s eyes widen, and he gives her a questioning look. She shakes her head very quickly.
are the best ones – and one of the jumpers his mum’s knit him, and tries not to pace around too much in the living room.
When Luna and Hermione emerge from the dungeons, Narcissa Malfoy is standing in the doorway of the dining room of Malfoy Manor. Draco isn’t entirely awake yet; Harry’s carrying him, and his head is hanging over his shoulder, face discouragingly blank. Ron is looking towards Draco worriedly every few seconds.
It’s Draco who makes a small noise now, a sort of sigh of relief, and Hermione covers his mouth the way he is covering hers.
Harry cups his cheek, softly presses his lips against his forehead and takes a shaky breath. “Merlin, Draco you don’t know how badly I want that.”
“I’m here.” Luna’s voice is much closer now, and he can feel the heat of her body beside his. He shudders. He’s been so cold for so long. “I’m not your family, and I’m not Harry, but I can hold your hand if you want.”
“We’ll get through this.” Draco tells her. It’s the same thing he’s been repeating to himself tirelessly, every second he’s awake. “We will.”
Draco thinks the image would’ve amused him, at some point; Greyback in a red leash that Voldemort is holding, sitting like a good crup at his side. Right now, it doesn’t even make him smile, but knowing that it – at some point – would’ve, is comforting.
When Headmistress McGonagall places the Sorting Hat on his head, Scorpius ignores the whispers; he’s been doing so all his life.
They’d made a deal; after every Quidditch game, Draco goes to his bed, they shed a shirt or two, occasionally their wands, put up a silencing charm and play a moaning tape over and over – really, how no one has noticed is beyond him, they are always literally the exact same moans – and they stay in his bed for a few hours, watching a movie, reading a book, doing homework, or whatever it is they have to do.
“You’re so cute!” An old witch wearing a St. Mungo’s patient’s robe, is standing in the doorway, a pink ball of fur in her arms. It has bright yellow eyes, and is staring at them unblinkingly. Harry isn’t sure
“I know,” Draco rubs at his forehead. “I just – I don’t know. I feel like they’re hiding it from me specifically.”
“There’s no way.” The wizard says. They’re both kind of old, and they’re wearing dark dress robes. “He’s dead. That Potter kid killed him.”
“Voldemort split his soul into Horocruxes.” Hermione explains. “Pieces of his soul. The list you left for Harry, we think it has all of them.” She doesn’t mention that Harry’s in that list, and neither does Draco. There are some things that are best kept private. “The diadem's here in the castle, we think.”
Still, when Harry grips his waist, Draco finds himself relaxing into it, not a thought in the world except for how good it feels when Harry touches him.
Potter chuckles. “Well, yeah. It wasn’t the twins, and it was a lot of magic. It’d take someone very smart and very powerful.” He smiles fondly. “And well, you’re a hellion.”
“We’re going to Diagon today.” Their mother informs them. “Are Sirius and Remus joining us, Harry dear?”
“Theo’s deaf, so he never remembers, and Draco forgets we exist.” Zabini answers, looking all too used to this for Harry’s liking.
Draco shakes his head lightly, blinking quickly, vision blurry because of the pain or because of tears maybe, Draco can’t tell.
“I don’t know what to say.” Draco hasn’t had a conversation since the wedding. He’s barely said a word that wasn’t ‘stop’, ‘please’, or ‘no’. Or, of course, screaming when he’s in pain, but those aren’t words.
“Or with Fred,” George grins, and Draco shoots them a grateful look, because they tease him a lot about Harry, but they’d never make him stay in a situation where he’s uncomfortable.
he’s in perfect view of the Potions Classroom, but what’s Snape going to do, drag him kicking and screaming? – and begins reading a book.
“He’s your best friend, Harry.” Hermione says, frowning lightly. “He’d stick with you through anything. We both would.”
“Right,” Harry says, a little overwhelmed. “Yes, we’ll begin trying soon, Mrs. Thomas, don’t worry. We actually need to be alone with Mr. Dolohov here, because he might wake up at any moment, and we need to speak to him.”
“Merlin, Draco, if you want to play dumb bloody forget it.” Harry mutters as he begins walking away.
He stands on his tiptoes, and reaches up towards it. He can feel a faint hint of a magical signature, but he doesn’t recognize it. It’s not any of the death eaters’.
Plus, in the past week that Draco’s been in the hospital, his siblings have visited every day, and it’s painfully obvious there’s something they’re hiding.
“I have to have the information from his wand.” She says. “And he’s always carrying it around with him.”
“Does something hurt?” She asks worriedly. “Is everything alright? Charlie healed you, but if there’s something wrong-”
And Harry’s half hard now. He quickly changes his line of thought and thinks of the time he was stuck listening to Seamus and Dean all night when they first got together because they forgot silencing charms.
Mrs. Thomas looks more and more uncertain, and, when Harry puts his hand on the bomb to take it from her, she doesn’t protest.
“Also, from the questions he managed to answer and a few diagnostic spells I ran, there’s a strong memory charm in place.” The healer continues.
“I was so worried.” She keeps murmuring, whether to herself or to Draco she’s not sure. “So worried. I thought you were dead.”
Harry looks at him, and Draco allows himself to look at his impossibly green eyes, shining and so fucking gorgeous, staring only at him.
Ginny scoffs and rolls her eyes. “Yes, because he won’t notice if we sneak into the bathroom while he’s showering…”
“Are we going into that subject?” Harry asks lightly. “Because then we also need to talk about why you’ve been venturing into Knockturn Alley.”
“Well, what were we going to say?” Fred asks. “He’s our brother anyhow. It doesn’t change anything.”
They all shake their heads. From what Ron knows, to be able to do it they must run in the family, and they’re abilities that the Weasleys don’t have. The Malfoy’s, on the other hand…
Harry exhales shakily, feeling both a million times better at having Draco in his arms and a thousand times more uncertain. He can feel the tension of it, the way Draco curls himself around him differently, and though he thinks he should’ve expected – he did, sort of – it doesn’t make it any less painful to watch.
“I know but I don’t have pockets, plus I was coming to ask how the scan was.” She smiles at me but I take it further. Draco knows where this is going so takes a seat on the stairs. He won’t be able to get up from there without my help. His belly is huge now.
“Yeah me to mate, me to.” And he’s most probably looking at Hermione. Though knowing Ron he could also be looking at the food.
“I wanna see the scan!” Teddy shouts while jumping up and down. We all laugh and Draco pulls the picture out his pocket. Teddy goes to snatch it but Andy takes it first.
Draco has stopped being sick going through the floo now, so when we land back at grimmauld I don’t expect him to go running. But he does. I follow him up the stairs and to the bathroom.
“Hello. How have you been my baby? Has Harry been looking after you?” She says to the cat in a baby voice. The second question was clearly aimed at me though.
“Oh you don’t know?” Nia seems surprised and looks from Hermione to me and Draco. “Well...they give me the loft. They decorated it and did the whole thing out so that I could move in there.” Everyone goes silent at this and Ron starts choking.
“That’s if you want to stay.” he adds. I glance up at him, trying to recover my equilibrium. His expression is unreadable. It’s so frustrating.
“I’ll floo Katie and tell her it’s started. But she said she won’t come until they are 5 minutes apart lasting a minute each for over an hour. So I’ll come back up and get you comfy. Do you want me to tell anyone else?”
“Thanks Teddy! I’m 19 today. Wow, you're 6!” He nods his hair and then comes over to me and Draco while Andy goes over to Nia.

“It’s shrewd business.” I don’t understand, it doesn’t make sense to me - feeding the world’s poor? I can't see the financial benefit of this for him, only the virtue of the idea.
“Luna wanted to check Draco’s wrackspurts. She says they will tell her when he is going to go into labour.” Ginny smiles and rolls her eyes.
I step out and grab a towel. I quickly dry my body and then rub my hair. I don’t rub it hard enough and it’s still dripping but I don’t care. I put the towel around my waist and head for the bag of clothes.
“Just because we know he isn’t very well behaved for you Harry. And we didn’t really want to put the responsibility on you either. We knew you and Draco had your anniversary coming up, and didn’t want to stress you out.” She looks at me with big eyes, and I could tell she wasn’t lying. They really did this in my best interest. I give her a quick hug then.
“I am.” He smiles again but it doesn’t reach his eyes. I can’t but feel like we are talking about something else, but I haven’t a clue what. I swallow hard and feel hot. Is the temperature rising, or is it just me. I just want this interview to be over one. I look at the next question.
“Three months?” I’m feeling railroaded. I take another large sip of wine and treat myself to another oyster. I could learn to like these.
“Merlin, I want you.” Something flies over to him and he catches it. Then his finger is back at my entrance but it’s cold and wet. He pushes in the tiniest bit and I whimper. He pushes it in and out slowly until his whole finger is in and I groan. With his other hand, he reached for my cock and starts stroking it back to life.
I shower, shave, wash my hair, and then spend a good half hour drying it so that it falls in soft waves over each side of my head. I put a bit of Pansy’s powder, mascara, and eyeliner on, only enough for subtle enhancements. I slip on some plum-coloured dress shoes, Pansy obviously transfigured them this colour to match the shirt, and then I’m ready.
“H-Harry, you’re here. Been a while since you made it to-“ before he could finish i had rushed over and enveloped him a skin tight hug.
A few years before we started at Hogwarts, the ministry decided to add extra years for students wanting college and university degrees. This worked out great for me and Pansy as we both wanted English literature degrees, me to go into publishing and Pansy to be a journalist, and I also wanted to do a potions degree because it’s my passion (I also think my godfather, Severus, would kill me if I didn't). So here we are nearly at the end of our Hogwarts life and ready to enter the real world, and for us the real world is the muggle world. Muggle books intrigue me and take me away from my life for a few hours.
“Keep your hands up here, don’t move them. Understand?” His eyes burn into mine, and I’m breathless from the intensity. This is not a man I want to cross….ever.
“We start by going inside.” I take his hand and quickly pull him along. He tries to hold back and dig his heels in but with all my auror training I am far stronger and he knows this by now so gives up quickly and lets me drag him through our front door.
I go to get them and lead them upstairs, showing Molly things on the way up. She hasn’t seen the house complete yet.
“Hey cub, how are you doing today?” I ask him while running my fingers through his hair, which is currently changing from light brown to black to match mine.
“Of course you didn’t know! Because you and your Gryffindor brain never think! I should have known something like this would happen.” He sounded so broken in that last sentence that I just had to take his hand to try and comfort him in any way I could. “I thought you said Hermione had looked at this place?” He asked. Ahh yes Hermione, well now Draco will blame her too, ha! Serves her right. Does she think this is a prank or something. Is this because of the so-called pregnancy brain George was telling us about, or wrackspurts according to Luna. Maybe they really did affect her brain and now she’s gone crazy and thinks words mean the opposite to what they do. But she’s so clever, she must have a reason for this.
“Bed.” he orders again. I climb back into bed. He clambers in beside me and pulls me into his embrace, wrapping his arms around me so that I’m facing away from him. He kisses my hair gently, and he inhales deeply.
Pansy has picked out, and maybe altered, my clothes for tonight and for graduation tomorrow. I wish I could feel more enthused about clothes and make an extra effort, but clothes are just not that important to me. I mean, I know what looks good and what doesn’t, but I couldn’t really care less about fashion. And besides, I usually have a robe on for school, and don’t go to many other places.
“I’m here to see my aunt and cousin. What are you doing here?” He sneers at me, still stood at the door.
“Pleaseee Harry. He doesn’t hate you, he just likes acting up for you specifically. You’re the only person I trust to look after crookshanks. Besides, Draco loves him, so just let him stay over and help.”
This chapter carries on from chapter 2. Ive put it up early because I’m flying through these chapters and thought it would be a nice surprise. I promise the chapter get longer by the way. Hope you like it. X
I’m like a small, giddy child. And all the contract angst fades. As I wash my hair, I try to think of what I could possibly ask him via email. Surely it’s better to talk these things through. Suppose someone hacked into his account? I blush at the thought. I dress quickly, shout a hasty good-bye to Pans, and I’m off to work my last week at The Hogs Head.
“What the hell was he doing in Hogsmeade?” I can hear her brain ticking and her curiosity taking over. I lean against the wall outside The Hogs Head, taking my break.
“Merlin yes! I’m starving.” He says against my shoulder, which makes me chuckle. I take his hand and we make our way to the dining area. Teddy and Andy are already there waiting for us.
“Thank you guys!” She lets go and I hand her the card. She looks even more excited than Teddy at his birthday party. She opens the card and reads it and then looks up to where Draco is holding a key in his hand.
“Shit, Draco!” Potter shouts from behind me and I can hear the fear in his voice and instantly know where I have fallen. I look up and see, in slow motion, the whomping willow coming straight at me. I tuck my arms over my hair and say goodbye to the world.
I stare down at my hands, as I knot my fingers together. Suddenly I feel emotional. He’s leaving. Reaching over, he takes one of my hands and slowly pulls it to his mouth, tenderly kissing the back of my hand, such an old-fashioned, sweet gesture. My heart leaps into my mouth.
“Thank you for this weekend, Draco. It’s been….the best. Wednesday? I’ll pick you up from work, from wherever?” he says softly.
“Four years.” I mutter. “Would you like anything else?” My voice comes out husky and breathy and his eyes widen slightly.
My heart is pounding. I can feel that pull, that delicious electricity between us charging, filling the space with static, the magic. He’s sitting so close to me, his eyes dark green, his elbows resting on his knees, his legs apart. Leaning forward, he slowly undoes my bun, his fingers freeing my hair. My breathing is shallow, and I cannot move. I watch hypnotised as his hand above my head, running his long, skilled fingers through my hair.
“Okay Hermione, no problem. Love you too. And bring Ron tomorrow.” I shout as she’s swirling through the green flames. It would be nice to say goodbye to him before he went away for 2 weeks and left me with all the casework and his girlfriend's cat.
“Oh, Pans, we talked about lots of things. You know - how fussy he is about food. Incidentally, he liked my clothes. So thanks.” The kettle has boiled, so I make myself some tea. “Do you want tea? Would you like me to hear your speech for today?”
I keep an eye on Draco for the rest of the day. He seems fine with Fred, playing and laughing with him, but when he speaks to an adult it’s like he can't be bothered or something.
“Thanks! Ginny and Luna came to visit this morning and helped me decide on a colour.” As he’s saying that, his hair is turning to black as it usually does when he sees me. “Shit.” He says then, noticing his hair.
It was half past 5 now and getting dark outside, but I couldn’t be bothered to even turn a light on. This was awful. I’d never been stood up before, but then again I hadn’t done a lot of dating before. But being stood up sucks and I vow to never stand anyone up, if i ever date again that is. I summoned over a glass and the fire whiskey and poured myself a generous helping. If I wasn’t going out to have a drink tonight, then I was staying in and drinking. I loosened my tie and took my shoes off. After my third glass I had nearly forgotten about being stood up. I poured myself another glass and put the wireless on as loud as I could stand it. I stood up and started dancing around after a bit, I even took my pants off.
“Owww fuck Draco.” I screech in a very unmanly voice. I can feel my cheeks burning (and not just the ones on my face) and can hear him snickering, so I get some boxers on and head downstairs to make breakfast cursing my boyfriend for being a slytherin along the way.
He puts everything back down and I swallow and try to stop the blush from spreading again. It doesn’t work and so I look down instead.
“Harry Potter! Don’t you dare ever say that to me again! I am not going to leave you here to… well I’m not going to leave you here. Now get up and get in that shower, you stink. Then get something to eat because you look skinnier than when you started at Hogwarts. Then you are coming downstairs and you are going to speak to the nice lady I brought with me.” She declares and gets up.
What is that supposed to mean? I start thinking of all the possible reasons why he would say that and my mind goes into overdrive. Could it possibly be that bad?
The beef is delicious and served with roasted sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, and green beans. It is even more palatable since Harry managed to retain his good humour for the rest of the meal. I suspect that it’s because I’m eating so heartily. The conversation flows freely among the Potters, warm and caring, gently teasing one another. Over our dessert of lemon syllabub, Luna regales us with her exploits of finding creatures all over France, lapsing into fluent french. We all stare at her, and she stares back puzzled, until Harry tells her in equally fluent French what she’s done, whereupon she bursts into a fit of giggles. She has a very infectious laugh, and soon we’re all in stitches.
“Shite!” I say out loud down the phone. “See Hermione, I’m no good at this whole friend thing. I've just woke you and Ron up- ON HIS BIRTHDAY!” I then start singing happy birthday down the phone and I’m crying by the end and drinking from the bottle of whiskey. “Why am I such a terrible person Hermione.” I sob to her. I drop the phone and curl up by the arm of the sofa and sob into my arms.
“Sorry Andromeda’s, is everything okay?” I ask her and look over to Teddy. He’s still asleep in his basket.
He takes my hand and leads me back through the pub. I feel exhausted, and weak, definitely drunk, embarrassed, mortified, and possibly a little bit thrilled.
As we stroll through Hogsmeade to the coffee shop, I slip my arm through Blaise’s. I’m so grateful for him….. Normality. Someone I know and understand.
“I know I’m sorry-“ then Teddy starts crying but he’s right behind us. Me and Andy turn to see Draco standing there looking pale.
We are getting lower and lower and my anxiety is getting bigger and bigger. Merlin, I hope I don’t let him down. I can see the street we are heading for now and I squeeze hold of Harry. I hope this death trap doesn’t collapse and kill us both just as we get there. I can do this. I can do this. I keep chanting in my head and take a deep breath. Then we are landing. It’s slightly bumpy but we soon come to a stop and I release the breath I was holding. My heart is in my mouth and I can't decide if it’s from nervous anticipation, relief that we’ve arrived alive, or fear that I will fail in some way.
“Because, Draco, I’m not going to touch you. Not until I have your written consent at least.” He smirks.
“What shall I wear?” He asks me after going through all his clothes, that he keeps at grimmauld, about 10 times. “How about this? What are you wearing?”
I open my mouth and then close it again, twice. The joke is on me. Never in this or any alternative universe did I expect him to drop everything and turn up here.
“Congrats guys! I’m so happy for you.” I say over the loudness of the table. She places her hand over mine and smiles with tears in her eyes.
“My lips are sealed! I won't tell anyone.” Nia says and smiles wide, showing a lot of white beautiful teeth. Nia was a very beautiful girl and didn’t really belong in a small country town like this. I wonder where she grew up?
The following day Hermione shows up at exactly 2 o clock, she is always very punctual. Ron is with her and he’s carrying a pet carrier in his right and a bag in his left and with a cat litter tray tucked under his left arm. I can tell as soon as crookshanks knows where he is because he starts jumping around in his carrier. Hermione shushes him and comes over to me with some paper in her hands.
“I look forward to it, Mr Malfoy.” I can picture the wicked gleam in his eyes. How can he reduce me to such a mess with so little words? I put my phone down and realise Pansy is standing right there staring at me wide eyed. My smile drops off my face and I turn around and pretend to be busy.
“Well we were trying to be quiet for the new baby, well done mum. Made him cry already.” George says coming in with Freddie on his shoulders again.
“No! It’s more likely to happen to me, you know, with all this muscle.” I joked and winked at him. I could tell he was trying not to laugh and so he turned round and crossed his arms.
“Please. This will only take a minute.” He insists. She nods and takes a seat next to me and opposite Draco.
“Me to.” He says. It's so simple and strange because Draco’s usually the one for words but that just says it all.
“He’s never done this before.” I tell her and stare at the baby. “I missed you too, little cub.” And I kiss his head.
“Now we have.” Seamus says while not taking his eyes off Dean. Hermione sits down at the end of the table next to Ron and turns to me. Everyone has again taken up their conversations but I look back at Hermione.
“Hello Mr Malfoy, Mr potter. What seems to be the issue today?” She says to us, very professionally. It seems to work though because Draco has relaxed a bit. Although he doesn’t seem to be able to speak.
“Everyone back in there. There’s more room and then everyone can see him.” She announces and everyone goes back from where they came. We follow and see that the whole family is here.
“He’s understanding. Part of me doesn't want to go, but it’s tempting to lie in the sun for a couple of weeks. Besides, mum is hanging in there, thinking this will be our last family holiday before Ethan and I head off into the world of paid employment.”
I look back at Pansy, all curled up in blankets on our couch and she smiles at me. I give her a genuine Draco Malfoy smile back and grab the broom. I love Pansy and she is my dearest friend. We’ve known each other our whole lives but only became close once we started in Hogwarts. We moved into the same room together once we started our degrees in Hogwarts and she knows everything about me because of her reporter skills. She’s going to make a fantastic journalist. She’s articulate, strong, persuasive, argumentative, and very beautiful. We tried dating back in third year but then we both realised that I was gay. Sometimes I feel it’s a shame I don’t like women as I’m sure we would make beautiful babies, but then I remember how hot men are and I get over it.
“I know nothing about wine, Harry. I’m sure it will be fine.” My voice is soft and hesitant. My heart is beating wildly and I want to run. This is seriously rich and I have no clue what I’m doing here. Oh yes, I want to be in Harry Potter's bed.
“We need to make sure you are simply irresistible for this evening.” She says, sounding more like the slytherin girl I know.
I apparate to the gates of the manor and they open to welcome me in. So far so good. I walk up the drive and to the front door, but then I start freaking out a bit and breathing hard. ‘I’m okay, this is for Draco. I love him.’ I keep repeating this to myself and it gives me a bit of confidence to knock on the door. A house elf answers the door and tells me to come in and wait when i tell him I’m here to see draco. The little elf directs me to a sitting area and I take a seat on the couch. I’m a little uneasy and I’m tugging at the sleeves of my jumper when I hear running. Draco skids around the corner with wide eyes.
Pansy wanders back into the living room, grinning from ear to ear. Perhaps she’s in love. I gape at her. She’s never behaved like this.
“You were warm, don’t move.” He says and cuddles up to me, still a bit flushed. He always says he only gets close to me because I’m warm but Draco Malfoy is a cuddler. But I don’t mind, I like being close to him.
At 2 o’clock we floo to the burrow. Draco hasn’t worn his ring around anyone yet or told anyone. His mother and Ron and Hermione and Nia know but that’s it. Until now. He has put it on and said he’s ready to tell people but only if they notice.
“There’s more.” He says and Andy waves her wand. Next thing there is a pram to match the changing bag.
He’s just looking for a new toy - a convenient new toy that he can bed and do unspeakable things to. My heart tightens painfully. This is the reality.
“Very well, Mr Potter.” He mutters as he turns and quickly exits. Potter turns his attention back to me.
“Well this muggle woman asked if the kids were adopted or surrogate. And I said surrogate. I couldn’t tell her you had them, but I didn’t want to say they weren’t ours at all with adoption.” He shuts me up with another kiss and then chuckles.
“Draco, please stop biting your lip. It's very distracting.” I blush and his lip twitches. “Would you excuse me for a moment?” He gets up and disappears once more. He’s gone for a couple of minutes and then returns with a document.
Other names for us included: Sirius, Scorpios, Jamie, Oliver, Orion, and Perseus. Ginny was just trying for weird constellation names so therefore lucked out.
“I felt the baby moving a few weeks ago.” He whispers and Teddy sucks in a breath and puts both his hands on Draco’s belly.
“Yes, most definitely.” I giggle. I love Pansy; she’s so loyal and supportive, sort of like a Gryffindor, but I love it.
I nod uncertainly. He’s resumed his distant, polite, uptight persona, his mask back up and on show. He’s carrying a leather messenger bag. Why does he need that? Perhaps he’s staying in Scotland, and then I remember graduation. Oh yeah….he’ll be there on Thursday. He’s wearing a black leather jacket. He certainly doesn't look like a multi-millionaire, billionaire, whatever-aire, in these clothes. He looks like a boy from the wrong side of the tracks, maybe a badly behaved rock star or a rebellious quidditch star or a catwalk model. I sigh inwardly, wishing I had a tenth of his poise. He’s so calm and controlled. I frown, recalling his outburst about Blaise….well he seems to be.
“I do mate! Honestly!” He said while winking at Hermione. She giggled and he smirked at her. They were like this all the time and I was happy for them, they really are perfect for each other.
We all finish our drink and I ask Nia more questions. Then I tell Nia we are starting on the next room and she is welcome to stay. She says she wants to help clean and so we all get started on the office room.
“I think he said no.” A voice says darkly from behind. Holy shit! Harry Potter is here. How? Blaise lets me go suddenly and I fall to the wall. I glance at Potter and he is furious. That’s all the motion I need, and in that moment my stomach heaves and I throw up on the wall and ground.
He starts crying again and I hush him. Then he goes back to sleep and I place him in his Moses basket next to the chair. I put my head in my hands and try breathing more slowly. Why is Malfoy here?! What if he harms Teddy or Andromeda? Or tries to kill me again?
“Yes okay I promise, i'll tell my boss and then i'll come with you.” Draco lets her up and she goes behind the counter. A minute later she is back with her bag in hand.
“I can’t do this Luna! I can’t leave this house and have a baby and get married! Sirius never did it! He stayed in this house!” I shout to her from where I’m sat against the door, panting hard.
“So you remember the nursery is closest to our room?” I ask Teddy and he nods. “Well we have put you furthest away from the nursery, so that the baby’s crying doesn’t wake you up.”
“How’s the baby shower planning coming?” I ask him. He has his head on my shoulder facing my neck. He chuckles at that and smiles.
We carry on down the road, passed a beautiful church and towards the edge of the village. The houses get fewer and bigger. Then we pull into a driveway of a colonial-style mansion. It’s breathtaking, even down to the roses around the door. Picture-book perfect.
“Cool hair Teddy!” I say picking him up to hold on my hip. He’s getting a bit big for this now but I can't resist.
All of a sudden, Luna sits on Draco’s legs. She puts one hand on his belly and one hand on his head. He stares at her like she just escaped a looney bin.
“Come on Harry, I think the floors clean enough. Let’s go and relax at mine. Dinners ready and I can grab another bottle of wine.” He says trying to sooth me. He doesn’t know that he’s making it worse. I don’t want to go there.
“No, Draco, I’m not gay…. More like bisexual.” He smirks and I blush again. I can’t believe I just said that out loud!
I nod, as if in agreement. Inwardly, I pine. Oh, Pansy….I wish I could tell you everything, everything about this strange, sad, kinky guy, and you could tell me to forget about him. Stop me from being a fool.
When I get to his door, it’s shut but unlocked. I open it slowly and look around but Draco isn’t there. I go to his bedroom door and this ones locked, he must be in there. I unlock it with an easy alohomora and slowly step inside.
“Bye Teddy, I’ll come around real soon okay? Bye aunt andromeda.” We all shout bye and I pull Draco through the floo to grimmauld place.
We all settle with our plates and eventually Molly joins us. We chat and laugh until tea time, then they head off home.
“Uncle Harry! Draco! I’m so glad you're here. Grandma’s been sad today. You can cheer her up though.” We look at each other with sad eyes.
“That’s great! Can we take the baby to the park with us? Is it a boy or a girl? When’s it going to be born? Are you going to get fat Draco, like Fleur was?” He says rather quickly and then puffs up his cheeks and puts his arms out around his belly pretending to be fat. “Like this?” He says and walks around the room woddleing. I chuckle at that and Draco wacks my arm.
“He’s very driven, controlling, arrogant - scary, but very charismatic. I can understand the fascination.”  I say the last bit truthfully without meaning to.
“You made this?! You can cook?” I ask him totally gobsmacked. He dabs his mouth with a napkin while trying not to laugh.
We arrived at mine after not too long and I opened the door for him to go inside. I walked in after him and put down the umbrella which was dripping all over the floor. Note to self -don’t forget to clean that before I fall over it in the morning. As I was putting that down, Draco must have mumbled a spell because suddenly I was dry. Turning around to inspect Draco, so was he.
“I do. Everything I did during the war. It’s coming back for me.” He sobs some more and I brush the tears away gently with my thumb.
“Besides, immense power is acquired by assuring yourself in your secret reveries that you were born to control things.” He continues in a soft voice.
“I...I thought he had told you.” She just shakes her head at that. I put my head in my hands and cursed myself. I’ve really screwed up this time.
“Good! Now, at 16 weeks the baby isn’t the size of a cherry anymore.” She giggles. “More like the size of an avocado, and growing faster everyday. The baby is more likely to hear voices at this stage and may even start to recognise songs sung to it. The baby can also make a fist and start sucking its thumb at this stage.” She smiles at us.
“A week Harry! Not a few days! A whole sodding week overdue!” Draco shouts from where he’s been stuck in bed for 3 weeks.
“I did catch on to that. It was cute. Maybe this whole baby thing has made him realise you are sticking around.” I lift his chin and give him a kiss. He smiles at me and we head towards Teddy and Andy.
“So...considering the baby shower is tomorrow, I’m going to ask you something.” I say to Draco and turn to face him.
“Just eat what’s on your plate, Draco.” He smirks and then his face turns serious again and his mouth sets in a grim line. “If you had eaten yesterday, we wouldn’t be here, and I wouldn’t be showing my hand so soon.” He looks angry now. I frown and return to my breakfast. It's cold now but dig in anyway. I look back up through my lashes and he looks like a little boy who’s sulking. I think it’s amusing and try to stop myself from laughing at him.
“Fine, I’ll take it off shall I?” He threatens. I grab his hand quickly and place a kiss on the ring.
“Thank you, did your anniversary go as planned?” Me and Draco look at each other and try not to remember. It wasn’t awful, shall we say but it did not go as planned. While looking at each other we sort of agree to not tell anyone what happened.
I enter the castle with ease and get some odd stares. Either they think I’m a weird stranger, or they know exactly who I am. As I’m walking towards the stairs, I hear steps approaching.
“Dray? Are you okay?” I just look at him and walk forward slightly. He shakes his head and falls into me.
“Look!” He pointed to just beside the barn type building and there it was. An apple tree. It looked quite young and only had a few apples growing on it but it was still an apple tree.
“I see.” My voice is tight. “So you have someone you can discuss your alternative lifestyle with, but I’m not allowed.”
“You better get over here now.” I tell her and put the phone down. I hear a distinct POP of apparation then. I turned around to see Hermione stood by the front door.
It’s past midnight now and Draco is clean and dry and fast asleep in bed. I’m next to him with Leo sleeping in my arms. Katie checked Draco over again before she left and said she would be back in the morning.
“Mr Potter will see you now. Please go through, Mr Malfoy.” Blonde number two says. I stand up on shaky legs, my nerves showing themselves once more, and abandon my glass of water.
“How do you know if you never tell him how you feel?” She kind of had a point there but I wasn’t going to tell her that.
I’m seized by my sense of raw outrage. Poor, fucked-up, kinky, philanthropic Harry - though I’m sure he wouldn't see himself this way and would repel any thoughts of sympathy or pity.
“Good luck!” Pansy shouts through the door as it shuts behind me. Ouch, that’s gonna hurt her throat.
Soon enough we were back at the house and as promised we took a walk around the fields to see if we could find any apple trees left standing. The first field we looked in was the one with the stables in. It was just a bare field with overgrown grass and four shaky looking stables. The next field was a lot bigger and had a few trees here and there but no apple trees.
Greg is back again before he sets off back to America. His brother's party was the other day and Greg had spent the whole party following me around. Now he’s been sat at the bar since my shift started, asking me for a date. It’s annoying.
“Don’t worry about it Draco. It happens more than you think. Being pregnant is very stressful and worrying, but just try to relax. You don’t need to worry unless I tell you to, okay?” He nods and gets up. “Here are your pictures, I got you one each and an extra one just in case you decide to tell someone.”
“Not everyone has a beautiful soul like yours Teddy. Not everyone can see love like you. But as long as the people I love don’t care, then that’s all that matters to me. I don’t care what other people think because I have you.” I give him a big hug and kiss his head, while Tears drip down my face. “You are a sweet boy Ted, you make sure you always stay that way!” I wipe my face and give him a wicked grin. “You hear me? Eh?” Then start tickling him. He starts shrieking with laughter then and yelling ‘stop!’.
I put my head in my hands. Blaise and Harry, they both want something from me. Blaise is easy to deal with. But Harry…. Harry takes a whole different league of handling, of understanding. Part of me wants to run and hide. What am I going to do? His burning green eyes and that intense smouldering stare come into my mind’s eye, and my body tightens at the thought. I gasp. He’s not even here and I’m half hard. It just can’t be about sex, can it? I recall his gentle banter this morning at breakfast, his joy at my delight with the motorbike ride, him playing the piano -  the sweet, soulful, oh-so-sad music.
I blink up at him as he holds it open, and as I hold my arms out behind me, I’m reminded of the time in his office when he slipped my jacket onto my shoulders - the first time I met him - and the effect he had on me then. Nothing’s changed; in fact, it’s more intense. His jacket is warm, far too big, and it smells of him….. Delicious. I don’t say to him that I could just use a warming charm; Harry seems to prefer to do things the muggle way, and I’m enjoying it if I’m honest.
Okay - I like him. Happy now, I’ve admitted it to myself. I cannot hide from my feelings anymore. I have never felt like this before. He is very, very attractive, but it’s a lost cause. I sigh with bittersweet regret, because him being here was just a coincidence. So, I’ll just admire him from afar, no harm done. And if tomorrow goes ahead, if I can find a photographer, then I can admire him in person. I bite my lip just thinking about it and then find myself grinning. I need to phone Pansy and Blaise and organise this photoshoot ASAP.
I moan once more into his mouth. I can hardly contain the riotous feelings that rampage through my body. I want him so badly. Gripping his upper arms, I feel his biceps. He’s surprisingly strong…..muscular. Tentatively, I move my hands up to his face and into his hair. It’s so soft. I tug gently, and he groans. He eases me towards the bed, until I feel it behind my knees. I think he’s going to push me down on it, but he doesn't. Releasing me, he suddenly drops to his knees. He grabs my hips with both hands and runs his tongue around my navel, then gently nips his way to my hipbone, then across my belly to my other hipbone.
Draco was fast asleep in bed after having stuffed himself silly with his favourite meal of confit of salmon with new potato and crab crush. He loves when I cook it for him and always eats more than he should. He loves salmon but likes any type of fish really. While he’s sleeping I’m wide awake thinking about the house. Of everything we need for it and how long it's going to take, especially if it keeps ending with both of us in tears like today. I still don’t know what’s wrong with him but as soon as morning comes I’m going to sit him down and have a talk with him about it. I’m worried and it’s clearly stressing both of us out. A lot of things are stressing me out at the moment actually. The house, my job, Draco, not seeing Teddy enough. I hadn’t even realised I was so stressed until my panic attack at the house. I don’t even know what to stress about first these days. Right now though i think i need to concentrate on Draco, I’m sure Ron is concentrating on the case at work, and the house can wait. As for Teddy I’m sure I can nip and see him tomorrow. I turn to look at Draco and he looks troubled even in his sleep. What am i going to do? I lie back down and cuddle up to him. For now I’ll sleep and we can sort this in the morning.
Pansy, of course, already has an internship set up at a big newspaper company. Her father knows someone who knows someone.
“I’ve been flying it since I was eleven years old. I’m sorry you were worried. Why didn't you firecall?” Merlin, he’s completely overreacting.
“So you decided on some exercise.” he breathes, his voice soft and melodious. His fingers gently tuck my hair behind my ear. “Why, Draco?” His fingers circle my ear, and very softly, rhythmically, he tugs my earlobe. It’s so sexual.
“Don’t tell either of us. George is outside, so when you have finished the examination we will go outside and he will come in. Then tell him and hopefully he won’t tell us.” Me and Draco chuckle at that and then Katie joins in.
“Okay, let's have a look shall we? If you can lie down on your back and spread your legs please.” He does as told without so much as a blush. He must really be tired and in pain.
“That tree has always been a hazard. I’m glad I was here. I don’t want to think what could have happened to you. Do you want me to take you back to your room?” He finally releases me and now I’m just standing in front of him looking like a fool.
“Merlin, sorry Harry, Draco. I didn’t even think. Of course, I’ll get something sorted.” We say our goodbye and off we go.
“Well, when uncle Draco was saying those things, it didn’t seem right. It made me upset because I love you both and so should everyone else. And you guys gave me the best birthday ever, so I wanted to do something for you. Just because you’re two men, doesn’t mean you can’t love each other. And just because you both have different pasts, doesn’t mean you can’t have a future. Right? Why can’t everyone see that?” He’s so young and innocent at this moment, that it brings tears to my eyes.
“I LOVE THIS SONG!” I shouted to nobody. I had finished that last glass and was getting a bit unsteady on my feet so I turned around to sit down and that’s when I saw him. He looked a bit ruffled and red in the cheeks as if he’d run here. I dropped my glass and it shattered everywhere. This was so embarrassing, I was pissed as a fart with no pants on and dancing around my living room. I instantly turned the wireless off and the silence was eerie.
“If you were mine, Draco, you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday. You didn’t eat, you got overly drunk, and you put yourself at risk.” I swallow. He closes his eyes and shudders with dread passing briefly over his face. When he opens them again, he glares at me. “I hate thinking of what could have happened to you.”
After about an hour of everyone chatting and drinking George stands up on the table and gets everyone’s attention.
“You cheeky slytherin!” I say and put him down. Just as he’s about to talk though, I kiss him hard. “I fucking love you!” I say and laugh.
Holy shit. Harry’s mother. This is so much more than I bargained for. Perhaps meeting her will help put a little part of the jigsaw in place. Might help me understand why Harry is the way he is….Suddenly, I want to meet her. I pick up my shirt off the floor, and I’m pleased to discover that it has survived the night well with hardly any creases. I dress quickly, but if there's one thing I hate, it’s not having clean underwear. I rifle through Harry’s chest of drawers and come across his boxers. After pulling on a pair of tight grey Calvin Kleins, I tug on my jeans, after a quick cleaning spell, and my Converse.
We chat for a bit in that same position, neither of us wanting to move. Also I don’t think either of us want to start the conversation we’re about to have. So we just won’t, not yet anyway.
“Where’s she going?” He asks innocently. I look at Draco and he looks hurt. Why is everyone taking this baby thing so hard?
“She wouldn’t do that, and I wouldn’t tell you anything she tells me about Theo - if she were to tell me anything.” I add quickly.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy! You like him! I have never seen you like this, so….so…. affected by a guy. You’re blushing!”
He rips the foil and grabs the lube while I’m breathing hard, my blood singing in my veins. The anticipation is exhilarating. He leans down, his weight on me again, and he grabs my hair, holding me head immobile. I cannot move. I’m enticingly ensnared by him, and he’s poised and ready to take me once more.
This is what it will be like if I sign, him ordering me around. I frown. Do I want this? Reaching for my knife and fork, I tentatively cut into the venison. It’s very tasty.
I push his drink towards him and he grabs it. Our fingers graze and there's that current zapping through me again. It goes straight to my dick and I gasp and let go.
“Harry be careful please.” He sounded sincere. “Can you do this another time, there’s probably nothing up there anyway.”
“Oh right sorry Harry. Well I just came to see how your date went?” She asked having recovered from the scene before.
“Wow, you’re not late for once. Makes a change.” He smirked at me and finished lighting a couple of candles on the dinner table. The lighting is low and the place looks romantic as hell. He is definitely in a good mood.
