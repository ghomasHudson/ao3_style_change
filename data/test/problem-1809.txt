Harry could tell that Draco was in the midst of a panic attack and needed to be given space.
He ran towards the front door with a strangled cry, knocking loudly. “MALFOY! ”
"Ready…"
"Set…"
He had no words. Every bone in his body was telling him this was Draco, but his eyes didn’t believe it.
Several hours later, Harry walked out of the salon with a full stomach, Draco’s Floo address for dinner, and a curly bubblegum pink mohawk. He couldn’t have been happier.
“One-offs don’t count. I meant an actual romantic date, not one-night stands or a quickie in the bathroom stall of a club.”
On the other side of London, two bodies slid together with abandon; muscle memory fueling exploration of their most intimate parts. The grip on Harry's hips, the angle Draco slammed into him...it had all been done before.
Harry smirked. "How about right now?"
“What happened?”
was my payment.” He waved over his shoulder and slid away into the night. Harry’s happiness overruled the impromptu kiss so he let out a whoop and ran for home.
“Sorry Malfoy, I’m taken. Besides, pale and pointy isn’t my type. Harry on the other hand…”
“Noooo. Don’t go. Stay here. Or run away. Don’t go to the Dark Load, he plans to kill you and go back on his word.”
“Color, pet. Now.”
"Master Draco, Kreacher has made you your favourite desserts. Kreacher knows what you like more than any other does."
“I’m angry.”
“Stray curse, allegedly—, but I know it was meant for me—right after your article came out about being gay and supporting LGBTQ rights.”
"I think that beats a Hollywood Handshake any day," he heard Mel say as the door closed behind them. And Merlin, wasn't that the truth?
“I know, but I have a plan. Will you wait for me? Even if you see me die, will you wait?”
Harry thinks things changed about a year ago with the appearance of Daisy, no last name of course, but it didn’t matter. She was the prettiest thing he’d ever seen; long blonde hair, sparkling eyes, he had to have her. Only problem was, she was everyone's girl. Harry would have loved to say that didn’t make him jealous, that he was letting her earn her own keep, but he couldn't. Every man she brought to her room, every time she walked up the stairs with another client, his insides would twist and he’d get nauseous. Thinking about all those hands on her body, not giving it the proper respect and admiration it deserved. He wanted to beat every last man, and he did threaten the first few, but he was scolded rather harshly by the Madam, Bellatrix Lestrange. Apparently Daisy was her best paid girl who only serviced high ranking officials and important people; too rich for his taste. But Harry wasn’t having it.
Draco examined them, tears rolling down his cheeks as he chuckled weakly.
Draco let out a whimper as Harry’s words and magic swirled around him, leaving him naked and breathless. Silk ropes danced beautifully in the air before wrapping around Draco’s body, effectively restraining him in the chair; spread eagle and waiting.
“Oh for fuck’s sake, the love part. Who are you talking about?”
"Kreacher! Where are my cinnamon buns?"
"And finally," Mel announced, "they must each make three desserts that they think will be Draco's favourites. Any three sweets will qualify, as long as they fall into the parameters set above. Draco will be the final judge with Professor McGonagall's input, and whoever bakes his number one favourite will be the winner."
"Ooh, sneaky," she said, grabbing a piece of the orange pulp on the counter and popping it into her mouth. "Oh, Merlin, those are divine."
Harry scowled. “Nothing Ron! Malfoy’s just being a git.” Ron appeared in his office door and narrowed his eyes.
Harry closed his eyes and shook his head in dismay.
“Now that’s something you will only dream about Weaslebee.” Draco winked at Ron who promptly gagged.
One night, after the town had gone quiet and Sheriff Dumbledore had wandered home, Harry decided he’d had enough. He had barely gotten to speak to Daisy and his patience was wearing thin. He waited for her outside the Inn, hidden in the shadows, until he heard the back door squeak and a dark figure emerged. He grabbed a thin wrist and pulled, but to his surprise it wasn’t Daisy at all. It was Malfoy.
"You're jealous that I liked Kreacher's buns more than yours."
But Harry didn't have time to watch his competition. He needed to concentrate on his own tasks. Mix the dry ingredients, whisk the eggs, measure the sugar…
Harry leapt from his seat and shoved Ron, who stumbled out the door. “Thank you Ron! You can leave now! See you at supper. Bye!” He shot a glare at his laughing no-longer-best-friend and slammed the door behind him. He turned around and immediately paled. Draco was sitting in his desk chair with the laptop open. Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hair as he read what was on the screen.
The trainer rolled his eyes, but a small quirk of his lips told Harry it would be ok.
Harry's lopsided smile did not appease Draco at all as he leans in for one last kiss. “Promise me.”
Harry’s stomach rolled as the Dementor got closer. Terrible thoughts of losing his partner, his friends, his family, swirled through his mind. Screams of pain and terror invaded his senses, but he stood fast and repeated the mantra
"I'm not. I'm irritated."
Thank Merlin for silencing spells because Draco could not contain his pleas, “YELLOW! Fuck! Daddy, please!”
The last thing Harry hears as he walks towards his fate is a soft sob and the shattering of a vase. He pulls out the Malfoy signet ring he stole from Draco’s vanity and kisses it before replacing it in his breast pocket. Hopefully keeping this little piece of Draco close will bring him good luck.
Harry knew number three on his list may take a while, but he was determined to stick to his plan. He still woke up sweating or screaming from nightmares most nights. On the worst nights, Hermione and Ron would crawl into bed with him, and they would pass out, wrapped around each other. He started seeing a Mind Healer hoping they could help him, but it was hard at first. Many sessions brought back long buried memories and fears, which triggered more elaborate nightmares. But as the months passed, it got easier, and he started sleeping through more nights undisturbed.
They eventually moved over to the couch to try out different positions. Now Harry was dick in hand and preparing to penetrate Draco when he stopped. “Color, Draco?”
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!” Harry roared. The dementors immediately disappeared as a giant silver stag charged them at full speed. Harry ran to Draco.
Harry groaned and dropped the bowl of icing on the table. This was getting out of hand.
Harry let go of his lengthy cock with an obscene pop that made Draco groan. His voice was hoarse from the repeated spearing of his throat. “What’s wrong pet? You can answer.”
“Do you trust me Draco?”
Harry gave Daisy a lopsided smile and agreed. He reluctantly let go of her arms and began to walk away.
Taking a bite of a Jaffa Cake, Draco moaned.
“Well, that’s alright, then. Want a cuppa? It's cold outside and I owe you an apology as well.” Harry widened the door and gestured for Draco to enter.
Draco, whose eyes closed halfway in that way he did when Harry truly brought him pleasure. "Oh, Harry," he murmured, and Minerva cleared her throat.
“No, no you don’t. They were talking about things I have never heard of and I’ve known Harry was into men since Hogwarts.”
Draco dropped a quick peck on Harry’s lips and slipped off to his side and down the alley. “If you want to see Daisy, come to the back door a week from tomorrow at eleven p.m. Don’t be late Potter, she doesn’t like to be kept waiting. And
Harry narrowed his eyes. "No magical ingredients and no tricks."
Harry turned towards Draco, handing him the paper as he got closer.
“What good is being The Chosen One?”
“Yeah, ok, yeah, let's do that.”
"The rules are as follows," Sue continued when everyone was settled, tucking her blonde hair behind her ear.
“That was
“It hurt to stay away any longer and Scorpius was asking A LOT of questions. Threatened to run away to England to find his Papa,” Draco smirked.
“Harry!”
For the next six months Harry kept meeting Daisy, falling even deeper in love, but not able to sneak in anything more than a few kisses, and only when they were left alone. Harry knew Daisy’s secret, knew that she was really a he, wasn’t actually a whore, and was sent as a distraction, but he didn’t care. She was everything he wanted, man or woman, didn’t matter. Harry had knows for a long time he was attracted to both men and women, he guessed this could just be the best of both worlds for him. She was lovely and kind as a woman, had a tinkling laugh that anyone would love, and a wicked sense of humor. She was clever and witty, beating you at a game of darts in one breath and then stroking your ego as she cleaned out your wallet in the next. He could see everything she had been hiding as a man and it just made him want her more. But his life was not this lucky, there was always a catch.
"Fine," Hermione shrugged before she tossed the liquid back. She gulped it down in seconds and came back up to the sound of her two best friends' cheers.
"To break people out of prison," Bellatrix said.
"Trapped?"
In her agonizing wait, she heard the woman's high-pitch laugh and the sound of footfalls coming towards her but whereas she expected the woman with the high-heeled boots instead found a chalk-white snake-faced creature in ash-black robes standing over her.
Voldemort gave her an endeared smile. He must have told her once, in passing, decades ago, yet she still remembered.
"Oh." He started but then stopped himself. He told her smiling, "That? That would be easier to just show you."
All his attempts to kill Dumbledore without having to look the old wizard in the face were one spectacular failure after another. Worse, everyone knew it was him. He felt everyone's eyes. They knew. Potter knew. So did his friends. His teachers. Dumbledore. The Dark Lord. They all watched him try and fail and it was absurd how well everyone knew yet no one came for him. No teacher, no judge or executioner. The only one who talked to him about it was Uncle Sev but he merely screamed at him for not letting him to the task himself.
The woman held out a waiting hand which irked him greatly. He wanted to be defiant. To tell her to fuck off and run off with his newly acquired riches but he felt his free will leave his arm as it rose up, against his wishes, to give back what he stole. When the coin fell from his fingers, he felt the control return to his arm and it was at that moment he recognized the power in this creature before him.
"You're not going to share?" teased Aquatta when he made another trip for a drink.
"I summoned her and everything."
He smiled. He remembered a time when he asked himself was there a way for him to get Potter to love him without having to talk (or be nice) to him and felt a kinship for the young lovestruck Ariel. "Did you win?"
"My Lord! We've lost five men today."
Voldemort frowned hard. He looked like he was going to burst from a boiling rage. Abruptly, he snapped his head at Draco and ordered the young man to scatter. He did without hesitation though inwardly he wished was braver and could have stood up to the Dark Lord on Ariel's behalf. But he couldn't and he left that poor woman alone and defenseless with that deranged wizard.
Then she looked down and saw a legion of rotted corpses standing upright and staring directly at her.
"She made a man…rip his penis off? Just by telling him to?"
Physically, he was alone in that dark cave off the coast of an icy beach but mentally he was in a dark cave with two of the most annoying ghosts to ever exist.
Lucius rested the clothes on his lap and leaned forward to give, what he believed in his bones to be, the last hug he and his beloved would ever engage in.
"I feel so special."
Timid Draco led a quiet Ariel down a lavish, emerald green-carpeted corridor past galleon-encrusted chandeliers and wall-sized oiling family portraits until, in the end, stood the bathroom door.
He punctuated the speech with a small plea because he found himself unhinged under her warm smile and her big blue eyes which he feared would undo him entirely if he were to spend another second being looked at by her.
"I am," Narcissa said with small but genuine joy. She went quiet for a second then explained, "Draco wanted me to drop an invitation to you two." She handed the envelope bearing her and Severus' names.
She blinked at him, stupefied. Was she shitfaced or did he really call her 'mom'?
He found it two minutes after Narcissa took Draco to Platform 9 3/4s tucked into an old shoebox and hadn't found the time to actually sit down and finish it. So today was going to be that day. He butchered an elf first thing for Nagini and left the kitchen for his bedroom (aka Lucius and Narcissa's old master bedroom) with his reading material in hand ready to indulge in some long-awaited reading time.
"No it grieves me to report that there have been no changes since I last spoke with you, my Lord. Albus is still dying—" (Voldemort laughed) "and still desperately searching for the location of your Horcruxes." ("Good luck.") "He and Potter remains as ignorant as ever of your true plans. And, from what I know, Draco hasn't made any more attempts on the old man's life."
Ariel silenced him by quietly wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head against his chest and whispering, "I'm so proud of you."
Pain exploded within her like a grenade as her tail uncurled and stiffened. A yellowish glow surrounded her as the sound of something being ripped tore through the air. She gnashed her teeth while agony sluiced through her bones. Wind from the Forbidden Forest roared as Snape continued to mutter out the words he needed for the spell, his unblinking eyes never leaving the tail which slowly split down her middle and eventually—with a horrible RIP—separated into two.
Chapter Five: How Tom Met Ariel
"Ha, pay up," Adella said to Attina who grudgingly handed over a silver dollar.
"Where was your friend sentenced?" Bellatrix asked, almost breathlessly.
Within minutes, she felt it. That rapturous climb. She arched her back, squeezed her thighs against his head, and yelled, "YES! SEVERUS! YES! I'M COMING!" He unhinged his jaw to gobble as much of her as he could while she finally burst. It was magnificent. Her first orgasms in literal decades and it was just as wonderful as she remembered.
Her nose crinkled and another smile unfurled out for him. Their lips were so close. His groin ached at the thought of her kisses. Her salty kisses trailing his body. Their bodies colliding. Her luscious voice saying his name over and over while he—
“Leave the boy alone,” Ariel said, listlessly. “You know, I had a marble statue of my crush in my treasure room when I was his age.”
"Heyy, perfect timing!" Ariel remarked as she brandished her newly-won wine bottle with a deep-purple-stained smile. "Look what I got." She stepped towards him adding mischievously, "Figured we could poet-up our tea time."
He sighed heavily once the warmth flooded over him dropped his head back into his comfy office chair, and told Snape, "Send that poor unfortunate soul my deepest thanks."
"Which book?"
"Please…no…" She croaked, misty-eyed, and petrified.
He was going over the mental checklist of things he had to do for the day but a malaise had started in his chest that forced him out of focus. He thought it was heartburn at first, which confused him because he didn't eat anything out of the ordinary (and he gave up coffee after midnight years ago). He punched himself in the chest but the warm tingling sensation didn't go away and soon, the malaise morphed into discomfort. Now, it wasn't just his chest. A balmy fluttering entered his stomach he never felt before and immediately assumed doom.
"Attina did have the best one," agreed Aquatta. "But it's a relief to hear you're not another one of that monster's followers."
After Voldemort dropped Draco off to Malfoy Manor (literally too; poor Draco fell ten feet from thin air just to land in a pile of mud and peacock shit), he did what he normally did when he was upset: slaughtering muggles.
Ariel let out a dejected sigh then told him, her voice rife with emotion, "I can't stand looking at it." She punctuated her sentence by punching her tail. "Every day, it mocks me. Every day, I beg and plea and pray that one day I'll wake up and it'll be gone. Just so I can go out and make my limb regeneration potion, get some legs, live on land, be apart of this magical world at last. And every day, I wake up heartbroken because it's still there. And I'm still…"
"She's not joking," Voldemort reiterated with glee. "Ask Bellatrix." He turned to Ariel and asked brightly, "Did you want to demonstrate?"
"Ariel?"
"No, because then she's going to think I said all those nice things about her to manipulate her."
Voldemort started to laugh. “‘Shrine boy’. Merlin’s Beard,” He leaned in and told her conspiratorially, “You know, until you came, I thought about hiding the shrine while he was away at school. That way I could watch his face as he tried to find it without asking anybody if they seen it because how was he going to go around asking people if they’d seen his…” His sentence ended in a fit of snickers.
"Can you move?" Draco snarled after several moments of intense, hateful silence.
"So, what should I do?" She rasped. "I mean…I still love the guy. Which scares the living shit out of me, because I know the longer I stay on the land, eventually he's going to ask me to do something that I won't be able to do."
She nodded. "To this day, he gets upset whenever I bring up Sebastian around him. Or call him crabby."
"All he cares about is if the task is complete. Whoever—"
Draco hung his head in shame.
"Yes, I remember that potion!" Snape said as a rare smile loosened from his thin lips. "Well, this is a treat. I've never met a fan of that publication in person before."
"I agree even more," Ron said.
Something in his face changed. She felt her throat tighten and the air thin from her lungs as images of her torture, her drawn-out murder, flooded her mind.
She tossed the floo powder at the ground, crying out, "Diagon Alley." With a loud blast of green flame, she was gone and Snape stood there, staring at the spot she last stood wistfully, before he remembered Draco.
"You want...her to help you kill Harry Potter?"
"Aw, you're still embarrassed by my praise?" She asked teasingly as he ascended the stairs.
They continued hugging even as the Polyjuice Potion began to wear off. When they eventually broke apart, and Ariel discovered Voldemort's nightmarish face smiling down on her, she beheld it with the same loving scrutiny as if it were Tom's.
“Farewell, Ariel.”
"Well, I—"
Ariel watched with a dazed expression on her face as Bellatrix air-mopped the floors clean and Narcissa washed the blood stains from the carpet with a flick of her wrist like they were simply two sisters tackling chores together rather than abating a murder scene. She almost didn’t hear Voldemort’s voice when he said to her, “I thought you’d be searching for housing right now.”
At first, he was charmed by her words. But then he watched the smile fade from her mouth and a hint of sadness settle onto her eyes. "Hell, that's the only reason my ex married me."
"Yes, excellent work, as usual, Severus." Voldemort praised. "Once again, you've proven yourself to be one of the most talented wizards of your time."
Bellatrix snatched the bag and started rummaging around. "Ha, nerd." She laughed, pulling out a copy of Potions Head Monthly to deride her. But then her hand touched the crown and her eyes bulged out of her head as she held it in her hand, looking equal parts mesmerized and baffled.
"Obviously, no, because I'm never going to actually die, asshole!"
"And…Severus?"
"Bellatrix dropped me off."
(Nagini: "Shouldn't have touched me, four-legged peasant.")
"Yes."
"Why would it mother me?" He asked, looking at her like she was crazy.
"How old are you?" Tom inquired.
Voldemort's face was impassive, though his ice blue eyes poured over her which caused a cold sweat to run down her back as she felt the furious grip of death descend over her.
But his crackly, dried out foot barely made it past the fourth step when the unmistakably annoying voice of Bellatrix LeStrange rang up from behind him, saying, "My Lord! My Lord! Where are you, My Lord?"
Draco frowned as acrimony filled his fractured heart.
They sat in silence for a moment.
Ariel nodded, doing her best to keep her face neutral as cold disgust coagulated in her bloodstream.
After a few minutes of blinking and trying to remember where she was, it occurred to her that she was still at Malfoy Manor. She looked down at the black silk blankets then over her shoulder to find, to her immense relief, that the bed she laid in was empty. She tried to look around the room but was impeded by the painful pulse in her forehead. She fell back into the pillows, with a groan.
Ariel might have kept on shamelessly whispering her love to the cauldron had Bellatrix's comment not piqued her vanity. Flattered, Ariel stood up and curtsied at the witch, saying, "Thank you! I couldn't tell you how many times I submitted to the magazine before they finally accepted something from me."
"Well, I didn't fuck a mermaid," Snape replied with slow deliberation. "I fucked a potions geek named Ariel No Last Name."
Dumbledore's smile faltered slightly when he said, with great disdain, "I hope that...boy of hers doesn't torture you too much."
"Ah," Bellatrix said, giving her sister a knowing smile before she turned her attention to Ariel and said, "You know, Ariel, I almost forgot to congratulate you on your potion maker's publication."
Dumbledore frowned hard. "She might not." He said with the glum sadness of a man well acquainted with resentments and shame. Then in a brighter tone, he said, "That's why you should marry this creature. So you can spend the rest of your life telling her she has nothing to feel guilty about."
"It's very nice to meet you, Tom Riddle." She said. "Were the two kids who ran off your brother and sister?"
He hadn't slept more than two hours continuously since he got back to Hogwarts. Every time he managed to fall asleep the Dark Lord's voice would slither into his dreams, reminding him with flashes of his father's misery, what would happen to his entire family should he fail.
"I didn't say that." But he has already turned away from her as if trying to avoid an assault. "Tom. Please. Look at me." He wouldn't turn his head. "Look at me!"
Stepping through those giant self-opening double doors for the first-time gobsmacked everyone but when Ariel took those first steps down the dimly light halls, her jaw hit the floor.
When they apparated to Hogwarts' Gates, Snape and Draco landed on their feet. Ariel landed on her knees. Concerned, Snape rushed to her aid but she pushed him away so she could hunch over the ground pull her red hair by her nape and vomit in the dirt road.
"But you look so tired…" She observed with concern.
"I don't know how you want to handle this," Voldemort began after an awkward pause floated between them. "But if you turn her down, I highly recommend doing it away from a body of water—"
Prepubescent Tom took it the hardest.
Dread exploded within as a terrible truth dawned on him.
Reflexively, everyone in the room attempted to appease the Dark Lord by dissuading him of his blame.
Draco did as asked and watched in amazement as the Dark Lord beheaded the fish with one loud heavy-handed CHOP then methodically began to debone, gut and cube the meat.
a clan of mountain trolls to join him as allies in the noble cause, he screamed and kept his arms out to his sides like he was an airplane the entire time.
"I don't know. He seems pretty fond of that…" She snapped her fingers, trying to jog her memory. "Shrine boy."
"I miss that beast. She was a fine pet. Much better behaved than Nagini anyway."
"Maybe you don't," Ariel remarked with a shrug. "But you know, I've lived a long life, and the one thing I've noticed is: things are a lot easier when you're not doing everything on your own."
Unsurprisingly, that night of his meeting with Dumbledore, Snape was summoned by the Dark Lord.
Ron snickered. "Yeah, you're just mean in general." Hermione's retort came as a smack to the upper arm. "Ow!" He addressed Ruth, saying, "Do you see this abuse?"
Draco upped the ante by reaching straight for Harry's groin, which tensed and stiffened under his touch.
Chapter Eleven: Always
Bellatrix pushed her wandless hand against the air while her wand emitted a white translucent light which pushed the rivers of deep red out of the dining room, through the kitchen, out the open glass door, dumping the red waste onto the luscious back yard; Narcissa dowsed the blood soaked carpets with blood-be-gone potion, her eyes glazed over with a monotony, for it seemed that once a week her house was dripping with blood and with every passing week her apathy towards her decadent house grew deeper and deeper; and Voldemort hummed as he hacked the limbs off of a giant’s corpse, froze the bloody appendage with a quick flick of his wand, and tossed the frozen meat over his shoulder into a rancid smelling pile in the corner for Nagini to enjoy at her leisure.
The timing of Ruth's bleat sent the Golden Trio into a fit of giggles.
"You've read of us?" asked Attina.
"I kept some hair for when I need to look…well…human." He explained, taking delight in her involuntary stares. "Better?"
"Because?" She repeated, coaxingly.
He looked so withered and pitiful like a deer during the food-barren winter months. All his dignities, his pride, were gone.
"Fascinating," replied the shopkeep drily. She touched a few Galleons and told Ariel, "Best I can do with this is a cheap dress."
Ariel's heart seized and burned for him so profoundly after that if he had asked her to ruin her life for him, she would've without hesitation.
"I was promoted."
Chapter Seven: What Kind of Bullshit Is This?
"November."
“What made you change your mind?”
He gnashed his teeth, eyes flared. "Must be so easy for you to judge. I forgot, mom, how many deaths did you cause during the 1840s? Hmm? Last time I checked you decimated a third of the Scottish sailing community."
children."
"You broke your friend out of Azkaban?" Narcissa asked.
"Wait, that was illegal?" Harry asked. Then he asked, more emotionally, "Is that Hagrid never adopted me? Is that why I'm still at the Dursleys?!"
Chapter Fifteen: The Prisoner of Azkaban
She punctuated her observation by pressing her foot directly into Ariel's diaphragm, crushing the very limited amount of air Ariel could take in. She giggled deliriously when she noticed Ariel's struggle. The woman might have stomped on her lungs, for fun, had she not noticed the contents of her bag as they were strewn across the ground.
They both nodded.
"You don't have to stand there. You can sit down with me if you want." She offered.
"Wow," she breathed, unable to pry her eyes away from the dingy gray slabs. "So, the dead are…just buried here?"
"Did you hear?" "Hear what?" "No?" "There was…" "No!" "Yes!" "We lost…" "Merlin's Beard." "For fuck's sake!" "How?" "Who?!"
Dumbledore frowned. "Do you think she'd..."
Ariel gave him a sardonic smile. "I wouldn't know."
Ariel scoffed. "You better stick a fresh one in some ice then. Because I'm going to have that guy back home for you in thirty minutes or less."
"Feed them false leads?"
Then it dawned on him. The laboratory.
He jolted awake drenched in enough sweat to fill a sink thinking with a scream in his ears that he assumed was his own but to his relief Ariel slept-hummed away. By the time his heart rate settled, he successfully pushed away Draco's decapitated head from his mind and fought the rest of the night for a few more dreamless hours of sleep before work.
"I'd rather die," Ariel said vehemently.
"I did," she replied.
But then his mind reminded him of his work. Since his duel with Albus, he had become obsessed with getting everything ready for war. In his last six weeks, he had spent every last hour of his time in a sunless cave trying to figuring out a way to spare the inferi from decomposition. And here he finally found the book that held the curse that would solve his decaying army problem. "Oh, I wouldn't want to intrude…"
Greyback nodded vigorously with tears in his beady eyes, looking so utterly frightened it brought a smile to Voldemort's face.
He pondered this question for an uncomfortably long time. "I've lost count. But if I had to guess...personally...in the tens of thousands."
Ariel turned her nose at him. “But I am scared of him.”
"I'll be a hundred and forty years old soon," she replied.
"Defense Against the Dark Arts."
But Voldemort asked, "Do you regret not drowning me when you had the chance?"
"Good. I'm making trout." She turned her head to the pile of onions then looked at him again and said, "Sweetheart you don't have to stand there. Take a seat if you want."
It was then, under a half-moon's light, that he found the source of the singing. There, on the edge of the lake, sat a siren with her tail still in the water as it gently swished back and forth against the surface. She had her back to him so all he saw, in the brief seconds before she turned around to acknowledge him, was the long drape of red hair flowing from her head. She played with a lock of it, twisting it between her fingers, as she serenaded the moon which gleamed down on her appreciatively.
"No, he has ice blue eyes like his aunt," Adriana argued, gesturing from his eyes to her big blue eyes with pride. "Ariel's eyes are more of an ocean blue."
Tom smiled at her tenderly before he said, "I got a job offer."
"Well, I was telling Narcissa and Bellatrix about my potion recipe that got published and then that lead to me telling them the story about how I broke my friend Jack out of Azkaban last year and these naysayers—" Ariel turned her head at Bellatrix and Narcissa who was secretly holding each other's hand under the table. "Tried saying I was bullshitting about being able to break someone out of Azkaban without setting off the alarms." She turned her head back to Voldemort and said with a scoff, "Like it's that hard to get past a bunch of floating smoke clouds in dishrags, anyway. Pfft."
Then what the hell is going on?
"You truly admire her so?"
"No!" Argued the dozens of voices each desperate to be heard groveling the loudest.
"I did," Ariel said, pensively as the boy's phantom appeared in the kitchen and climbed onto an untaken chair to join them. Ghostly scenes of their time in the cave together passed by her eyelids. Him, nine and full of baby fat. He, a few years older, showing off his school uniform. Him, a preteen, handing her a drawing, explaining to her, his prepubescent voice soaked with haughty pride, the difficulty of pulling off an animation spell on a drawing for his age. She still remembered him telling her when she tried to give the sketch back to him, 'No, I made it for you'. She remembered being so touched by his thoughtfulness she had to wait until he left for Wool's to cry. But those sweet memories crumbled to dust as her thoughts turned back to the headlines from the last decades of his murders, his bloodshed, his cruelty. "Meanwhile…I've heard about He-Must-Not-Be-Named every day for the last forty years and I had no idea the two were the same person."
"Would it be inappropriate to ask you," he said after he took his first sip, "If you slept well last night?"
Snape let out a heavy exhale which Draco knew was a sign of relent. He smiled at Snape as he retreated back into his office. "So, what's her name?" He said teasingly. He couldn't help himself. Teasing Uncle Sev was one of his favorite pastimes, besides goading Potter and writing hilarious diss tracks about his enemies.
Ariel's overjoyed screams, her cheers, her yelps of triumph filled the air and landed on his ears like beautiful notes he wished he could play on loop for the rest of his life.
"I'll be thirty-seven in January."
"They've already met Severus?" Tom asked teasingly. "I didn't realize you two were getting so serious."
She gave him a pointed look. "No murders. Or tortures."
Ariel smirked into her pile of onions. "He wrote it to help me win a bet against a sea witch."
Narcissa gave her sister a look asking her to confirm this fact.
Chapter Sixteen: Mama's Boy
"Fuck off," Ariel replied without stopping which only served to make the janky wizard's friends cackle.
"Yes."
She came to in a cold room swathed in the navy blues of dusk, vaguely aware that someone was touching her head. She opened her eyes, expecting Voldemort, and was relieved to find her beloved Severus, sitting on the edge of the bed she laid in, stroking her cowlick. When he noticed her awake, they kissed and embraced, grateful to have another day in this horrible world together.
“So, Bellatrix wouldn’t walk in, see us and try to kill you in a jealous rage,” He replied. Then with a laugh, he said, “She truly hates you.”
Ariel squinted at him. “Really?”
"Oh, sweetheart, you don't have to call me that. Ariel is just fine." His chest tightened under Voldemort's smoldering stare, which told him, try and I'll throw you out the first window I see.
Ariel laughed, tears in her eyes. Happy tears. Endeared tears. Relieved tears. "I love you so much, T—" She amended herself. He wasn't Tom. He hadn't been for years. "Lord Voldemort."
Perhaps, he thought as they marched closer to the front of the line. Ariel remained in her seat, looking regal in her wooden throne as she accepted the ass-kissing of the masses. When Dolohov moved aside, allowing his group to move to the front, he tried to guard himself. But then he saw the way her bored blue eyes brightened at the sight of him and he was quickly powerless to stop his heart from melting all over the floor.
Nagini swerved her massive body around her ankles, swishing the blood and staining the hem of her dress as it circled her, threateningly. She could almost hear the snake warn her, I wouldn’t try anything if I were you. Ariel snapped out of it long enough to tell him, “I wanted to see you.”
"Oh Ariel," he moaned watching her slid his penis back into her vagina without an instance of discomfort. "God, you're so wet."
But he held it for a time without speaking as long-forgotten memories flooded over him. He felt a laugh build in his chest and after a few moments of grotesque smiling, a crow-like cackle broke out of his chest.
"Don't shame me," Ariel said half-heartedly then she tore her gaze away from Snape long enough to ask him, her expression changed to that of inviting evocation, "This doesn't bother you?"
"I don't know," Narcissa admitted, nearly speechless. She wouldn't have believed it if she weren't seeing it for herself. At first, when she came back from her daily four-hour excursion to the liquor market and had a distressed Bellatrix explain the situation, she thought her sister was exaggerating. Bellatrix was hatefully jealous of any person who seemed to curry the Dark Lord's favor. It didn't matter the Dark Lord had the mood swings of a dictator or that being his "favorite" often meant inevitably getting pushed off of a higher pedestal. "This is weird."
"Well," Bellatrix said as she slowly rose to her feet looking uncertain and thwarted. "Thank you…for not killing me."
Nagini was close enough for the mouse to recognize its own reflection within the pair of shiny black eyes when it made the desperate decision to run for its life instead of waiting to die.
It was the biggest bald-faced lie he'd ever made in his short life. But Draco would have said anything to keep the Dark Lord's wand from turning onto him or, worse, his parents.
Little Tom almost blushed, proud, and thrilled to receive some praise (praise was nonexistent back at Wool's. Any and all good acts were met with apathy while any and all mistakes were met with swift and severe punishment). "Nothing scares me," he replied confidently.
"But that's such a sad song." Ariel protested, half-heartedly, as her finger began to trace the conch-shaped outline of his ear, knowing it would the last time she would get to do so.
"G-good morning Lady Ariel," Draco said.
Even if she could talk then she would've still been speechless.
"I can't believe you did that for me."
"He's dead, My Lord."
Ariel gave him a small, slightly sad smile as she took her hand from his face and began to turn on her side. "Goodnight, Professor Severus."
"So, what are your big plans for your first day on land?" Snape inquired.
Nagini's heavy body rolled against the wall like a steamroller. No matter how fast the mouse ran, the beast chased after it, matching its speed with sickening ease.
"Tom. Tom Riddle."
Of course, no matter how many families he decimated; no matter how many lives he stomped out with a wave of his wand; no matter how much rage he poured into those killing curses; none of that assuaged the stabbing pain in his head or the implosive fear in his heart that told him he had lost Ariel for good.
She tore it open hoping to find a letter, but found instead a golden badge with his former name on it, saying for special achievement, and a single photo. An animated drawing of a mermaid doing a swan dive.
Ariel's favorite quality about herself, besides her voice, would always be her hair. Not because it was long or lovely or it held a perfect bounce but because of the color. Those long fluttery vibrant blood-red locks that draped her back. That could be seen from miles away and drew predators and prey in better than any bait.
He hadn't slept in days. His decaying hand wouldn't let him. Every day, that rotting hand grew blacker, sicker, bonier. Some days he would wake up to the smell of Death choking him out of a sound sleep and he would look down at his hand and find it laughing at him. You arrogant old man, it would sneer at him. Sometimes it would be in Tom's voice. More often, it sounded like Aberforth's. His father's.
Ariel smiled at him then read the tale of "the Wizard and the Hopping Pot" which he listened to in captivated silence.
"Some things never change," he snickered and for a heartbeat, they were giggles. Until Voldemort said, with all seriousness, "So tonight then?"
Draco shrugged, though he knew exactly why he was there. He was there because he needed to disappear and Potter wasn't letting him. He got up and took his drink to the far end of the establishment where he took the first least messy table he could find.
He turned his attention back to the garbage and a piece of paper being used for a bookmark caught his eye. He knelt down and pinched his long, dried out fingers around the page, pulling it out from its place. Just as he suspected, it was nothing but a moving sketch of a mermaid diving into water rendered on torn parchment paper.
"Fuck your entire fucking life, Malfoy!" Harry howled but his words were met with the sound of the establishment's door slamming Draco inside. He turned to his best friends, nettled and shaking. He could feel his wand sitting in the pocket of his coat, begging to be used.
"You seem like you'd be a terrible flirt," Arista said.
"Ariel."
Ariel sighed softly. She had hoped for too much.
"Good girl," Voldemort hissed in parseltongue.
"She's on the hunt," said Voldemort with pride.
"I bet we could find buried treasure in here," Tom told them tantalizingly. Even back then, he knew the best form of persuasion involved riches.
It took two weeks but she proved herself right. One morning during another thrilling round of sex she blurted out, mid-climax, "I love you." Snape ceased thrusting long enough to stop and ask, "What did you say?" But Ariel lied and said it was a heat of the moment act, nothing more. They continued fucking but Snape, who felt what Ariel was too cowardly to admit, exerted every last ounce of passion he could into their sex so that when they both came undone, he could plunge forward into an open mouth kiss look her in the eye and say, "I love you too."
Harry left a trail of dark marks down Draco’s body. He propped Draco’s legs over his shoulders and swallowed Draco’s dick to the hilt. He brushed a thumb over Draco’s entrance, teasing and stroking him. With a quick spell, Harry’s fingers were slick enough to slip two fingers inside without resistance. Draco’s cries of ecstasy grew until he couldn't take it anymore.
“I didn’t know you couldn't produce a Patronus. We could have practiced it before starting Auror training.”
“Whatchu want Malfoy?”
Harry growled and shoved Draco’s arms back against the wall, pinning him there by his wrists. He stepped back to take a look at Draco’s face, but didn’t relinquish his grip. Harry spotted a mark on Draco’s cheek and another dark spot on his collar that looked suspiciously like lipstick. “Dammit Malfoy, you too? Why has everyone else had her, but I can't get near her? What good is being the Chosen One if I can’t even be with the one I love?”
“That’s his problem, not mine.” Harry took a sip of his coffee and raised an eyebrow at the group a few tables away. “You know, I think I may have to go over there, Blaise is saying something about sneaking off to the Prefect's bath…”
Draco's eyes lit up and Harry knew he had him.
Draco throws his hands up in frustration. “Alright, I promise!”
Harry’s house had become a safe place for most of his friends, and eventually, others began to show up. Even the Slytherins popped by once in a while. The day he saw Draco Malfoy on his front step, Harry almost slammed the door in his face out of surprise.
Harry drops a quick peck on Draco’s forehead and begins to back away. “I love you.”
“Scorpius. You must be Harry Potter. Come in, Mum’s waiting for you.”  Harry hastily followed him inside, wondering if Draco had a secret sister. He froze in the doorway of the garden sitting room. Long blonde hair, silver eyes sparkling with tears, and the most beautiful person he’d ever seen stared at him with regret and pain.
She shook her finger at him as she walked away laughing, and he got back to work.
messages."
“It is.” His heart clenched at the deep melodic voice that greeted him. “I’m sorry…”
Sue continued. "No magic can go into the preparation or cooking, and that includes ingredients."
Harry had had several long sessions with his Mind Healer discussing his feelings towards Draco. Discovering they may have had more in common than he initially thought had given Harry a new perspective on their past relationship. He dealt with his anger and wanted to try again. It seemed like the perfect opportunity for a second chance.
Ron shrugged, “Harry is.” Pansy and Blaise stared at him.
“Oh, and what kind of case requires someone to spank you and call them daddy?”
Hermione was the first to notice the absence of their two charges. As she was drying tears of laughter, she glanced over at the table, now cleared of its contents by staff.
“But we hate each other.”
“I asked ‘you too?’”
Harry laughed. “You think they’d have figured that out after our 7 years together.” He wrapped his arms around Draco. “I’ve missed you. Are you home for good?”
Draco's hand was outstretched, waiting to shake Harry's. "That's all I get?" Harry cried, his body aching for more. "A bloody handshake?"
“But I still love you.” Harry pulled out his necklace with the two rings on it.
Draco perked up. “Ring?” His voice was tight, but rough from all the moaning and shouting.
“I wouldn’t have you any other way.” Harry kissed Draco and their pledging words of forever were lost in passionate moans until early morning.
Harry was rubbish at picking out clothes for himself, considering he’d never done it before, so he recruited anyone who would help him. He discovered a few things along the way: Ron was good at finding the best cafes, Dean and Luna had the best fashion sense, and he positively hated skinny jeans.
"Well, it'll be a competition to see who can make my favourite puddings. You know, who knows me best and who's a better baker?"
And so began his annual tradition. The first visit, he dropped off Draco’s things, cursing him. Prit grabbed the trunk and retreated frightenedly, which had him sinking to the ground and tearfully apologizing. Prit reappeared, patting his shoulder and dropping something in his hand.
“Hermione, you ok?” Ron peered at her through tears of his own.
Ron threw his hands up defensively, placating Harry. “Alright alright, don’t get your knickers in a twist. Just making sure you two don’t kill each other. It’s not often Malfoy yells my name.”
Draco’s blush spread down to his chest. He hiked up his collar to hide his reddening ears.
“Bastards!”
Slowly drawing his fingers out of Draco, Harry whispered a few spells in succession to speed up the process. He wanted Draco inside him
He startled at a hand on his hip before he was pulled back into a hard twitching member. "Good morning love. Have a good dream?"
Draco blushed. “Alright Harry, but I want it to be as Draco, not Daisy.”
All too soon, Harry was in Draco’s chair, gripping its arms like he was afraid of falling off.
Harry dresses slowly, taking his time to spend every last moment he can with the sleeping man. When he’s done, he stands over Draco and brushes his hair away from his face, which in turn wakes him.
“As long as you don’t mind it being just the two of us. Everyone else is out.”
The next day things went terribly wrong. At high noon there was a showdown between Sheriff Dumbledore and Voldemort’s posse, the Death Eaters. The betrayal of the apothecarist Snape became apparent when he turned on Dumbledore and shot at close range. He was carried away to the doc’s office on a stretcher and passed an hour later. The town was in a panic, but Harry knew this was his chance. Now that the town sheriff was gone, Voldemort would take over and finally be within Harry’s grasp. His deputies were none other than Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape. His leading lady, Madam Bellatrix Lestrange, was as dangerous as she was beautiful, if dark and crazy was your type. This brought Daisy to the forefront of Harry’s mind and he knew he had to make his move. He needed to rescue her from the despicable and deplorable tastes of the Death Eaters. There’d only been rumors of their treatment of whores, but they were enough to have Harry shudder in fear.
Upon apparating back to the flat, Harry had vanished their clothes. Draco had moaned and dug his nails into Harry’s shoulders, bracing himself for the inevitable assault on his neck. Harry lifted Draco and deposited him on the bed, peppering his body with kisses and bites.
Draco cut two pieces of each, and the sounds they made while trying each proved that Kreacher did, in fact, know what he was doing. But they hadn't tried Harry's yet.
Shock permeated Draco’s face until anger and embarrassment took over. “Wh, wha, WHAT?! You knew the whole time?!”
, Floo messages asking when and where the competition was going to be. Not to mention a mini-lecture from Hermione about house-elves and a very peculiar message from Minerva. This wasn't exactly what he had in mind when Draco suggested the competition.
Ron produced the Weasley product with a grin and began to set them up. Once the ear was as close to Draco and Harry's table as possible, he began to listen. Ron grew paler by the second and suddenly he gagged, took out his earpiece and threw it. Everyone stared.
"Indeed. Well, Draco, will you do the honours?"
Draco was staring, his eyes wide and his lips twitching. And then he burst out laughing. "You're jealous!"
“Well, isn’t that interesting.”
“Do you have something to share with the class Mr. Potter? Mr. Malfoy?”
“After the war I wasn’t quite settled and wanted a fresh start, so I wrote a list of things I wanted to change. I didn't expect a relationship to be part of it, but I’m not complaining.”
“No, the last part.”
“Stop! Harry, stop.”
The chatter stopped at the table. Hermione swearing was a rare occasion.
“Didn’t think you’d want me now that I was female. I panicked.”
“Fine.”
Harry eventually carried on with life , but never got over it. He didn’t care how many blind dates his friends set him up with, about fans sending proposal (and sometimes threatening) letters or people approaching him at clubs; he had his forever even if it didn’t last.
Draco wasn’t sure how to handle this Harry. It was something out of his favorite wet dream and yet, he could barely move or acknowledge what was going on. He jumped as well as he could when he felt a sharp smack on his leg.
Draco gasped, and counted.
“Harry, please, and yes, I am. The last haircut I got was before Hogwarts, and it grew back overnight.”
Harry released his grip and started to back away, but Draco grabbed his wrists and pushed Harry back towards the opposite wall. “What did you just say?” Harry struggled a bit, but eventually sagged against the wall in defeat.
"What are you planning?"
“Are you sure?” Draco asked tentatively.
Harry sighed happily and relaxed into Draco’s arms. “Best first date ever.”
“I wanted to know what they were talking about.”
kiss, I knew. And I knew you had reasons for presenting yourself this way, but I don’t care. I still want you, woman or man, doesn’t matter.”
"Minerva, Draco, today I've made a Tiramisu, a Hazelnut Dacquoise, and in case you want something a bit lighter, Jaffa Cakes."
"Tell me what you made," Draco said, a little smile teasing the corners of his mouth.
Draco chuckled. "Fair or not, they were amazing."
“Pans, be nice. It’s Draco’s first real date since... oh fuck, how long has it been?”
“I’m fine!”
“I have no idea, something different I guess.”
“Are you sure? You do look a bit red.”
“Oh nothing, so who’s up for a drink at the Leaky? I’m sure we won’t hear neither hide nor hair of those two until tomorrow.”
"I'm still mad at you for locking me out of the Floo. You will have to make it up to me later." Draco flicked his wand and steam returned to the room.
-————
Harry pulled out slowly just to slam back in. Draco screamed then sobbed out Harry’s name.
Draco turned his head and kissed Harry’s palm. “I’d like that.” Harry kissed his forehead in reply. Draco jumped at the feel of something warm and slick encircle his penis. He looked down to see a cock ring and he knew the sweet moment was over.
One morning, Ron pointed out how long Harry’s hair was getting, sending Hermione off on a rant about professionalism. She also said his new look needed to match his new wardrobe. That was the one thing Harry was not looking forward to. The last person to cut his hair had been his Aunt Petunia and that had not turned out well. Harry scowled at Ron, who mouthed “I’m sorry” back at Harry.
Upon arriving home later that evening, Harry was greeted by no less than ten, yes
“Describing all the things I want you to do to me once we get back to your place? In great detail, I might add?
“What's wrong?”
“Of course they did, darling. That's why they violated Ronald’s ears so thoroughly. Draco isn’t normally one to talk about such naughty things in public.”
.” Harry pouted at Draco in the mirror.
“And I, you.”
“I’m definitely ready for a drink.”
Harry began to walk Draco back towards his bed. “I don’t and I know you don’t either. You said it yourself, you love me. Now, can we please forget about tomorrow, just for tonight?”
“Potter, are you nervous?”
“Sorry, Master Harry. Know Master Draco loves you even ifs they can’t see you anymore.” And she was gone. He looked down to see a gold ring identical to his except for the lion's tail etched around it and green opal on the top. He chuckled through his tears, deciding that Draco was it for him even if he left. Maybe one day he’d find him again.
Ron wandered after Blaise, Pansy and Hermione took up the rear, chatting about which parties they thought the boys had been naughty at.
Kreacher scowled. "Chocolate is Master Draco's favourite."
Harry grinned at the crowd. He could do this. He'd trained for this. He'd spent years getting to know his boyfriend. He knew all of Draco's weaknesses, and he was prepared to bake his way to a win.
“What the fuck was that all about Malfoy?” Harry stalked across the alley to Draco who smirked up at him.
"Master Draco likes mine better."
He was down to his last three choices: pediatric medical school for St Mungo’s, Muggle Studies Professor at Hogwarts, and finally, the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects with Arthur Weasley.
Harry barely had time to slam his laptop shut before Draco caught him mid-research. “What is it this time Malfoy?” He tried to keep his tone as even as he could, but it still came out high-pitched and slightly breathless.
“I can produce a mist and I thought that it would suffice, but I could barely draw my wand this time. I do not have fond memories of Dementors from the Manor.”
They talked long into the night. Hermione and Ron must have come home at some point because as soon as Draco left, they were at his side bombarding him with questions.
Pany’s eyes lit up as she reached for the fallen earpiece. Ron was quicker and vanished the whole thing before she could grab it. She pouted.
“I know.”
"OY, SCARHEAD! How dare you shut the Floo on me!"
“This is supposed to be their first date! How have they leapt into bed already?” Ron exclaimed.
“What in the bloody fuck was that?” Blaise stage whispered.
“I think so, but we need to talk first. It’s been five years, I need time to get to know you again, and Scorpius. Can you stay?”
“Please don’t stop, daddy. Fuck me hard.”
Draco smirked. “I’d like that.”
The parchment was clearly enchanted, glowing red and tying itself in a knot once Harry read it. He determined it was a complicated notice-me-not spell: if Harry read the letter, he wouldn’t be able to locate Draco.
Ron slapped a hand over his mouth. “Nope, don’t want to know about your extracurricular activities in the Slytherin dorms, thank you.”
Hermione cleared her throat.
“Why’d you leave?”
engraved inside.
Harry smiled. “Hey.”
Harry shook his head and approached Draco.
sneer.
Harry ducked in for a deeper kiss. “Please stay away from the Death Eaters and keep yourself safe. When this is all over, I will take you away and marry you.”
He glared at Draco as his boyfriend took the seat of honour, front and centre of the spectators. He'd even dug up Dumbledore's old throne from somewhere in the castle and moved it into place. Minerva, the traitor, sat next to him, her lips twitching at the corner as she caught Harry's gaze.
Harry smiled. “Not at first, but after our second, technically
Harry’s tiny smile of indulgence did not put Draco at ease. “That is not my name right now.” Harry held up a finger to stall Draco when he opened his mouth to answer. “Since this is our first session I’ll give you a second chance to be my good boy. Now, what color?”
Draco watched all his happy memories curl away like a stack of photos set alight, the figures on them attempting to cower away from the flames, bat them away, put them out, but the flames consumed them one by one, until none remained untainted.
He cleared his throat. “Hello. What’s your name?”
coffee shop talk. I need to bleach my ears or something.” Ron took a gulp of water to calm himself.

"I, nor the rest of us, will stand for you not taking care of yourself. Is that understood, Harry? We will help you get back your appetite, and I have a feeling Professor Snape will help as well. It's okay to need help, Harry."
Only a few moments later a furious head of house entered, pausing at his student's shocked faces.
"I'm proud of you, you did so good. You made all of us proud, little one."
Dragons
"Potter, would you like to explain to me why your clothes and robes are multiple sizes too big?"
"I'm so sorry 'Mione! Please don't hex me, I'll be good, I promise.."
He said, his silky voice turned soft when he mentioned the boy, much to everyone's surprise. They were even more surprised he said please. Harry tried to get up but Ron's harsh grip on his right arm stopped him. Everyone noticed their scuffle quickly.
The trio plopped down in the Pansy's room, exhausted after the long day. They had a few hours before dinner, so Harry could sleep just a bit more. Draco lightly caressed the the boys cheek before turning back to his smirking friends, causing him to blush and look away.
He said in a strong yet tender voice. Smiling softly at the look of joy the boy had, knowing he was doing a good job. Draco stroked his cheek gently, making the boy turn even more red as he closed his eyes in bliss. Harry couldn't understand why Draco's touch felt so good, but he would be damned if it didn't feel heavenly. The two reluctantly let go of each other, remembering where they were.
"Iss that the sspeaker? The famouss one?"
He hissed softly, cuddling against them softly. He turned to his friends, taking in their soft looks and smiled.
The hall went silent, except for Salazars ranting. Had they heard that correctly? The "golden boy" was supposed to be in Slytherin?
"Y-Yes Dray?"

Pansy said, fuming as Draco helped her off the ground. The Gryffindors snickered before glaring at Harry.
Bonding is the courtship, or beginning phase of mates. It means that the bonding mates will be excused from whatever duties they may have according to Veela/Creature Law. When bonding, the mates parent(s) become legal guardians if one or more of the mates do not have parents, or if the present parent(s) are insufficient.
He recognized it as Ron's voice, he hadn't noticed the boy was out of bed. He had no earthly idea who his best friend was referring to but the utter hate in his voice shocked him. He had never heard him sound so unhappy.
He trailed off, not making eye-contact with the trio. Afraid of what their expressions might hold. The trio all had soft, interested looks on their faces.
☽☾ Point Of View - Third Person
The silver trio and Harry made it to their head of house's office, quietly laughing and talking together, the trio hoped to distract Harry from his pain. They didn't realize the smaller boy could barely feel it. His pain tolerance was something to be reckoned with, from unfortunate circumstances. Severus walked in quarter of an hour later.
Sincerely, Harry Potter
"I'm not sure Ms. Parkinson, but I intend to find out. Perhaps we should keep an eye out for him? From his gesture I would say he is safe, so if you all agree on that, you may spread the word that Mr. Potter is not a threat to your housemates."
He laughed, using Pansy's nickname causing her to laugh as well. The wolf just huffed and nodded, before laying his head down. After he finished, he let the trio choose their seats, Draco carefully laid the sleeping boy in the seat next to him.
"P-Professor Snape? Is it possible for me to have a snake familiar since Hedwig ... passed away this summer?"
Snape said dangerously, very aware of the pained look on the young boys face. The Slytherins were itching to help their possible new friend, seeing him in pain was pissing them off majorly. Ronald scoffed and pushed Harry, who almost fell. Why had none of them noticed the physical aggression the ginger showed on Harry?
☽☾ Warnings - Animal D3ath, Mentions of ab-se, soft Silver Trio and Snape
"Yes sir, we'll tell them at breakfast. I have a feeling something big will happen this morning. I'm sure you don't want to miss it."
Pansy said comfortingly while Blaise hummed in agreement. Blaise let go after a moment, chuckling as Harry relaxed into Pansy's friendly embrace. The other two trio members cooed, while Snape hid a smile. Harry dozed off, and the others decided to let him sleep since their first class didn't start for an hour. The staff left schedules up to the head of houses so thankfully, the four shared all the same classes. The trio decided to study in the mean time, seeing as O.W.L.s where this year, the potions master began making nutrition potions for the small boy as a head start.
"I see, it's alright to cry, little speaker. I want you to sit beside Draco Malfoy, alright? His little group is quite fond of you. They will help calm you down. After breakfast, you will go with Severus to fix your arm. Is that alright, little speaker ?"
He said, raising an eyebrow at the boy's nervousness. It was a simple question, he didn't remember this boy ever being so timid, but he also only caught him at bad times so he couldn't assume much.
The boy murmured, the group still heard him, unfortunately. Pansy gasped, the other three males breath hitched. Their concern quickly growing.
He said, bowing respectfully before smiling softly at him. He nervously shuffled towards Blaise, Draco, and Pansy. Harry gripped onto his left sleeve slightly before looking at the silver trio.
Draco said, what was in it for him? He figured the newly Slytherin boy hated him and his friends. The trio saw his blush brighten and watched him fidget for a few moments before he spoke up again.
Harry had always thought Draco was beautiful, he knew that much, but Draco's inheritance? He was a whole new level beautiful to the small boy. His skin was a ethereal pale, his icy-blue eyes glowed slightly, his slender frame grew at least six inches taller. Harry's embarrassing thoughts ended when Pansy was shoved to the side by Hermione. Draco's wings bristled and Blaise growled, his fangs poking out defensively.
The blonde quickly nodded, he loved when they would brush his wings. To him, it felt the same as someone playing with your hair or rubbing your back. The two chuckled at how fast he nodded, before conjuring soft-bristled brushes and getting to work, noticing how happily he took the affection. The grooming lasted until dinnertime, the three had done face masks and all showered beforehand, so they didn't have to wait in line. Harry had woken up and quickly showered as well, figuring it was better to be safe than sorry. The shy boy had thanked them at least fifty times, after which he checked them all for injuries and hugged Pansy because she was hurt. Professor Snape eventually came to fetch his house for dinner, only stopping when the small boy tugged his sleeve lightly. He raised an eyebrow at the boy, who immediately let go and apologized before he looked back up at his Professor.
"Okay?"
Without turning his head, Voldemort pulled out his wand, pointed it directly at his young adult self, and hollered, "Crucio!"
His wand exploded with blue light but Dumbledore blocked it and the curse ricocheted into the ceiling, leaving behind a massive hole. Voldemort struck again, whipping his arm across his chest furiously as he launched another curse which Dumbledore, effortlessly, repelled, sending the beam of light into a wall where it shook the house to its core.
Harry snapped his neck to glare at Draco only to find that Draco's face was inches from his own. They were so close he could smell the Butterbeer and toothpaste on his breath. Harry felt his throat go dry the longer he stared at Draco's thin mouth which was open slightly from grinning, almost expectantly. Like he knew this would undo him.
"Just open your gift."
"I disagree. I think it's better to be loved."
"Nope."
"I would've done more but by the seventh one I lost my nose, all my hair, I was afraid the eighth one would've costed my penis." When Ariel gave him a flummoxed look, he added, "Hey you wanted honesty. This is why I always tried to give you half-truths. At least it wasn't as disgusting as the real truth and less offensive as a bald-faced lie."
Mom, I'm seventy-one-fucking-years-old and you give me a children's book? He thought but he feigned enthusiasm for her sake. "Aww, a book. You know me so well."
"So weird!" Bellatrix screeched her hooded eyes flared as they were unable to tear themselves away from the pair.
Every time she called him sweetheart it felt like a comforting breeze against exposed sweaty skin. He felt himself ease a little bit with water sloshing in his belly.
"You're not?"
"These aren't for teaching. These are for me." He replied as he slowly stepped towards her.
Embarrassed beyond recognition, it was all he could do to allow his mother to drag him away from the line and scold him under her breath, "I told you to get rid of that thing before you left…"
"Yes, but I still did just get you flowers because I love you and I thought that's what people do when they love their moms."
"Obviously." She whispered back absentmindedly as her hands rifled through her long bright red hair with new nervous energy. "Sorry. I didn't mean. I can be a sarcastic asshole sometimes."
She wanted more.
Chapter Thirteen Part Two: That's My Mother, You Colossal Idiot
"Très intelligent," chuckled Tom.
"Is that it?"
"How is constantly solving my problems for me supposed to be good for me?" (Snape balked) "I don't know how many times I need to tell you this but: No one asked for your help."
Her excited scream was heard by Bellatrix who was two doors down, taking her jealous rage out on a room full of red-wigged mannequins. She apparated herself to the laboratory to investigate, asking her sister when she arrived, "What happened? Are you okay?" Narcissa nodded at Ariel, who had crouched down to her knees to embrace the base of the cauldron, resting her face against the fat golden belly, whispering, "I love you."
Moments later, Voldemort crossed over into the light like a ghost sliding out of one realm and into the next. He had his wand out and he wore an unreadable expression.
"Which subject?"
Chapter Ten: Ruth The Goat's Bar Incident
"I can do this!"
She cut him an uncertain glance, but when she saw he was smiling, she said, "I did sleep well."
"Yes. Also, we should go to that bar that has the goat!" Harry cried.
He never felt more loved or cherished in that moment than he ever had in his entire life. He couldn't physically handle it. He started to convulse. His face turned a dark blue as his breath went ragged. Soon he was hyperventilating and, to Ariel's horror, the corners of his eyes misted. Before she could react, he threw his arms around her waist and sobbed into her abdomen for ten minutes straight, telling her in croaky wails, how much he loved her, and how he would never hurt her and how she had to promise to never, ever, leave him.
"Draco is right, Potter. I'll be giving you a nutrition potion at every meal until you've caught up."
"What is wrong little speaker?"
Hermione spat, pretending not to be scared at Draco and Blaise's glares. Harry sighed irritably, stepping forward and ignoring his friends tensing up.
"O-Of course, I don't think P-Professor Snape likes me very much so it's a win win!"
"The sspeaker iss sso cute!"
"Alright, Mr. Potter. Let's get your arm healed."
Harry wiped at his eyes, biting his lip harshly to stop the sobs that threatened to escape his throat. He shakily sat up in his bed, peeking through his bed's curtains to make sure he didn't wake the other boys. It was far too dark to tell but he assumed he didn't, because Seamus and Dean were still snoring. The small boy decided to walk around the castle to clear the images of Cedric's body from his head. He hummed slightly are his bare feet touched the castle floor, before he made his was out of the tower. He internally thanked the painting, who didn't wake up.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Ron dropped his head to the table with a thud, causing everyone to laugh.
While looking through his bedside stand for his glasses, Harry came upon an old crumpled list, repeated crease marks and notations making the old writing barely readable.
“Oh fuck Draco, right there, fuck yes!”
"All right, everyone, take your seats!" A woman's voice echoed through the kitchens.
regular cinnamon buns."
With a small click the door opened and he saw…nothing.
“I know, I was just hoping I could convince you. I want to keep you safe.”
Harry chuckled. “Busted.” he whispered. He caressed Draco’s cheek once more and stood up. He reached for Draco to help him up and then tried to pull Draco to his chest. Once standing, Draco resisted the hug, but eventually gave up and sank into Harry's arms.
Draco pulled him close and captured his lips. He tasted of hazelnut and espresso and orange, and Harry practically melted. "You're my favourite dessert," Draco muttered into Harry's lips. "Now grab those Jaffa Cakes and meet me at home. I have plans for you."
Sated and sweaty, they discussed the true reason for Harry’s research: a case. He needed someone to go undercover with him at a kink club. They filed the new partner paperwork the next day.
Draco petted Harry’s head and Harry hummed with content. Draco giggled and spoke softly, hoping his tone would help Harry relax.
Draco purred while rubbing against Harry's arse. "Not that I remember, but I do know those were
"Guess we'll have to figure it out now that the news is out, yeah?"
Harry needed something different after the war, he needed to start over, so he started a list.
"Jaffa Cakes? Truly?" Minerva asked. "How clever."
As the days went by, the state of living in town deteriorated and people began to disappear. Harry knew his life was on the line, that Voldemort was just waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Finally the day came.
He turned just in time to catch an armful of Daisy, who had leapt from the stairs. She grabbed the back of Harry’s head and pulled him into a hard kiss, all sticky lips and hot breaths. They were startled apart by a shriek from somewhere inside the Inn, harsh breaths clouding the air around them.
Harry thought. He heard a whimper and thought it came from the swirl of emotions in him, but when he turned his head to the side he saw a shivering lump, a tuft of blonde hair sticking out.
"No! Ugh! You know sex is disgusting, right?"
"Sounds splendid," he replied his voice so uncharacteristically airy and warm it sent a chill down Lucius's spine. He looked up at Bellatrix and told the stony-faced witch, "Come along and join us, Bellatrix. We should give the husband and wife some precious alone time." Bellatrix compiled without hesitation, following Ariel into the hallway. Voldemort lingered in the doorway and said, without breaking eye contact with Lucius, "Welcome back home, Lucius. I can't wait to hear the details of your daring escape."
"And Severus," Voldemort remarked with a coy smile as Snape straightened his back. "Ariel, you are already acquainted with Severus."
Suddenly, it all became too much. And Draco, without thinking, pushed his weight into his black leather shoes and ran off in the opposite direction of the gates, ignoring his godfather's voice calling for him to turn back as he bolted into the 2 am night.
"Mer-o-pee." He corrected, gently.
"I know, lucky bastard."
"How do you know?" He demanded, his chest rising and falling rapidly.
"That surprises me. For as long as I've known that brat he was never one to share or play well with others."
Ariel was sobbing quietly in front of a roaring fireplace in an extravagant gold and scarlet themed office while Snape clued in Dumbledore on the events that transpired.
He was a considerate guide, letting her use him for balance, helping her over the boulders and down into the cove.
“I know…” She slurred with hooded eyes.
Snape glowered at him. "What was so urgent, Mr. Malfoy?"
She dropped her gaze to her tail, which twitched mindlessly in the mud, then raised it back to Snape who had slipped into a silence she couldn't read.
"…A childhood hero of yours truly."
When Scrimgeour opened the door to find them, his heart broke instantly for the pair. It was too easy for Voldemort, with Ariel's magical voice and his talents for manipulating others, to make the minister of magic believe a hundred or so lies: how they were twins that were kidnapped during a sister's day shopping spree at Diagonalley ("there was just this explosion... then I looked up it was just You Know Who and five dead bodies...") how for the last few months they'd been kept in a room with no windows and kept as sex objects; how eventually He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named started confiding in them about future plans (the scheme to blow up Stonehenge, recruiting gnomes and invading Iceland) and how, after a daring miraculous escape, they came to that cottage in the middle of nowhere with the earnest hope to be apart of the team "to thwart his diabolical plans"
It was enough to send him there even though he had scoured every inch of that ramshackle shack over the years.
His obvious flattery garnered a real smile out of Voldemort. He patted Snape on the shoulder winked at him and said, "'Almost'. Good answer." After a pause, his face turned somber and his hand returned to his side. "There's a second reason I called you here tonight." He dug into the pockets of his robe and took out four vials. He handed two to Snape then downed his lot like shots of copper and puke flavored liquor. Snape watched his master's bald head start to sprout red hair and his tall slightly doughy stature shorten and slender. Within seconds Ariel stood in Voldemort's robes, held his wand, and bore his broad bastard's grin. When Snape's stares lingered he told the wizard, in Ariel's melic mezzo, "Any day now. We only have so many hours to kill."
A split second later, the mirth in Voldemort's face died, replaced by a rage that contorted and scrunched his face. Fenrir's face paled instantly as he felt his body being bound by invisible forces, reducing his muscular body into a rigid heap. The air in his lungs slowly started to seep out of him, both from fear and from the Dark Lord's will, and he felt his throat constrict the little oxygen he had left. He gasped for air, his face reddening as he slowly and painfully began to suffocate. He could only watch as Voldemort drew closer to him and told him, to his everlasting horror, "That red-head is my mother, you colossal fucking idiot."
Even as he laid there and watch the woman of his dreams bounce on top of his cock until her eyes rolled in the back of her eyes and her melodic voice cried out his name, Snape couldn't believe this was real.
A few moments of silence past before one of the iron doors cracked open. A dementor came out to greet her, its cold faceless visage peering down at her like it wanted nothing more than to gobble her soul whole.
He barely had time to apologize to the person when he lifted his head and discovered he had run into, who else, but Draco Malfoy.
She rushed out the bathroom, hairbrush still in hand, and peered down the hallway banister which gave a full view of the living room. Voldemort was crouched before one of the wall length bookcases but his face was drained of the rage she heard earlier replaced by the glee of a small child who had spotted their parent after a short but agonizing separation.
He tried to remember when he first arrived to visit. It had to have been no later than noon. Did he really sleep twelve hours? That was more than six times what he normally slept.
"Not for a few hours." He whispered back. "Though we should probably go to bed. I'm sure you have a lot of things you want to do with your new life."
"Why do you want to control people so badly?" She asked after she took a seat on the water-logged sand, leaving her tail in the waters.
"He would skip school all day to go drink alone," Ron seethed. "Fucking loser."
Harry scoffed. "Coming from you? That's rich."
Draco looked up to see Ariel using her knife to slide the diced onions into a simmering cauldron.
"Mom."
Ariel didn't hesitate. She looked him in the eye and said, "We both know that I can't help you kill a child."
Ariel nodded. She turned to leave, telling Bellatrix as she headed for the door, "Grab that other bottle. And we'll go find—" Her sentence was cut short when she discovered Voldemort was standing on the threshold, silently observing the four of them.
The room was small, smaller than she expected. His walls were lined with books and jars filled with slimy things while a giant bed dressed in black satin blankets sat, almost expectedly, in the middle of the room while a cauldron simmered quietly in the corner beside a dark wooden desk and a dark gray curtained windowed silhouetted the half-moon which appeared to stand in the window for their pleasure alone.
"Oh yeah, I forgot you were in the dead mother club."
Chapter Fourteen: Prison Break
Ariel squirmed in her seat, unsure of what to make of this conversation. It didn't feel like a win. But then again, he wasn't reaching for his wand, which laid idly against his saucer plate, and she wasn't struck dead either like she had expected.
He gave Snape's face a quick tap with his palm telling him to "treat her well" before he veered towards the door.
"It's mine." She replied. When Snape gave her a disbelieving look, she reiterated. "It is! Look I can prove it." She took the crown back and set it on her head where the moment it rested against her forehead a Jamaican accented voice projected from the center-most sapphire.
"Don't do it," young adult Tom hissed. "What if this is a trick?"
Ariel studied Draco's face for a moment as if waiting for his façade to crack. But when it didn't, she asked him, "Would you like some tea before you start?"
"You know I don't know what that means!"
"Some sharks found...a few of the corpses and told the rest of the ocean."
It wasn't until they were gone did Lucius cry out, "Okay. What the hell was all that?" He turned to his wife and sister-in-law and demanded, "Since when does the Dark Lord have a friend? And who the hell was that woman? Why does she treat him like their equals? And why the hell haven't either of you—?"
"Let Ariel do the talking."
"My Lord." Narcissa blurted out breathlessly. Then she remembered her place and took a nervous bow before picking herself up and asking, with some calm, "What do I owe the pleasure?"
"I love you too, son."
He had to think. He barely knew himself anymore. If someone had asked him last year he's dietary preferences he would've given them a whole litany of foods his refined taste buds couldn't bear. Wasn't he the same child that demanded a personal chef for his 8th birthday because Narcissa's family elf's cooking wasn't up to standard? But now, he felt as feral as an abused dog, happy with whatever he could get his mouth on so long as it wasn't a foot or a fist.
Her head turned sideways at him as she regarded him quietly. Her tail rippled the waters behind her and Tom followed the ever-expanding rings until they vanished into nothing. Finally, she told him, "I'm sorry. I can't. It's just something I can do as a siren."
Ariel froze with the cloth held against her face, looking guiltier than a dog with frosting all over its face.
"This is my task! He assigned it to me. Which means if I fail…"
"Uncle Sev." He called his woozy head pressed against the coolness of the wooden door. No sound signaled life. He knocked again, harder. "Uncle Sev! Open up before I pass out."
The mouse watched from its little hole in the wall as the beast with no arms headed towards its hiding spot. Fear coursed through the small animal's body, making it jittery, drawing more unwanted attention.
It was the morning of New Year's Eve and Narcissa was the first one to rise. She was so high from well rest she actually woke up that morning humming. Her moods, and her sleep schedule, always improved once Draco returned from school but since both her son and her husband were home (and more importantly, the Dark Lord had moved out permanently) she hadn't been depressed (or woken up hungover as hell) in weeks.
Chapter Twelve: House of Giant Corpses
"I thought, 'wow. What a gorgeous voice. He could drown a lot of people with that voice'."
"Please let me have this," she begged her voice so soft and cracked with emotion he had to relent and she continued, "I know you hate goodbyes, but I just wanted to say," (she grabbed his hand and gave the first four fingers a loving squeeze) "That I am so proud of you and that I love you so much and that I wish you nothing but the best of luck with whatever path you choose in life."
He growled. "Ugggh! I'm in the kitchen." He stood where he was while Bellatrix skittered into the kitchen, looking more crazy-eyed than usual.
Author's Note: Okay so 6 years ago I wrote an Ariel/ Snape fanfic that was so bad that when I reread it this year I vowed to not only delete that shit out of existence but rewrite the whole thing because frankly Movie Snape and Post-The-Little-Mermaid Ariel are my OTP and they deserve a better story.
Ariel began hyperventilating immediately. "Oh, Cod. Oh, Cod. Oh, Cod..."
One moment, they were sinking into the cool floorboards. The next thing he knew, he was scrunching his white toes in a batch of warm, bluish sand and they were outdoors underneath a balmy sun. Tom craned his pale neck towards a twinkling, clear, sunny sky and smiled with his eyes closed. The sunlight felt magnificent against his skin and what little modesty he possessed fell away from him as he slid off his black robes. He stood there, allowing a perfect breeze and a glorious sun to caress his bare body and he took a giant breath so he could drink in the pure ocean air. He opened his eyes with lazy happiness and turned his head to the horizon where aquamarine waves undulated as if to greet him and him alone.
"Too weak to fight back, old man?" Voldemort snarled as he snapped his wrist and sent a blinding force of white at Dumbledore's chest which the wizard managed to block with a shield of blue. "Or is dying making you soft?" Dumbledore didn't respond and, infuriated, Voldemort bellowed, conjuring his hate into a blinding bolt of lightning.
"I was never a murderous queen! I was a pissed-off princess at most for a couple of decades but I've grown since then."
"Yes. We're both potions geeks. We're both for the criminalization of the Amoretia and the legalization of the abortion potion." Ariel said. "It makes no sense why the ministry is okay with teaching witches how to make a date-rape potion but throws a conniption any time you try to teach young people how to create their birth control."
"Good."
"Rutabaga isn't a sexy word," argued Aquatta whose voice had a welcoming, soothing, but cool tone. Like Aloe lotion on a sunburn.
"What the…?"
Arista smushed his cheeks between her hands and cried, "Such a handsome boy!" She released him and slung her shoulder around his as she whispered, "I bet you fend off admirers with a sword."
A fresh ray of light crossed over her toes and she lifted her head to find Voldemort had opened a side door. He held it open for her. "C'mon, drunky." He said with good-natured humor. "I want to show you something." He stood beside a grime-covered window. She peered out of it to discover he had opened a door to a backyard where a bunch of white stones stood a waist-height like they were teeth plucked out of the mouths of giants and stabbed into the ground.
Ariel's body eased as a relieved breath escaped her lips. "Wow…I don't know what to say." She paused for a few heartbeats then added, "You know, it's funny. I often wondered what happened to that little boy in the cave…"
"Yeah but if you ever get sick of men..." She punctuated her sentence with a click of her tongue and a wink.
Ariel got onto her feet and slowly began to approach him.
Fair point…I just hoped…
Ariel crinkled her nose at him with mirth then glanced around the room. Half the Death Eaters were already gone and others were in mid-goodbyes. "Is that why everyone keeps leaving?"
Snape's lips twitched upward before he held out both hands, hovered them above her tail as his mind locked and eyes locked onto the task in hand and began to recite words from a dead language.
"We're going to go pay the Ministry of Magic a visit, Severus," Voldemort replied as he began the process of shredding his clothes into that of a tattered dress. "You're going to sit there and pretend to be catatonic while I am going to feed them sob stories about how I," he straightened and started sobbing on cue, and in a mask of anguish and suffering, said, "'He-Who-M-Must-Not-Be-Named kept me as a sex slave and—and—and he used to brag about how he's going to blow the Croatian Sea Organ on May 2nd'."
She hesitated. There was so much she wanted to ask and now that she had the chance she didn't know where to begin. She started with the one question she always wanted to know. "How many creatures have you killed?"
"Can you teach me?"
"How old are you?"
"Of course." He said.
"You're putting too much blame on yourself," Dumbledore insisted. "You're not the man's mother."
Ariel didn't say anything right away. Instead, she continued to scan over his lovely face with widened eyes for a heartbeat. Then she took a step forward and slowly lifted her hand to his hairline. He didn't move his head when she ran her fingers through his dark-brown waves.
"I can't help it. You know I'm a hopeless busybody."
"You know," Voldemort said to her upon her return seat, "You don't have to stay."
"Oh I don't mean to stay long I have so many errands to run—" With Lucius back in prison and her sister dead she was constantly filling her days with errands. "But there was another thing I wanted to drop off to you."
She found, of all people, Bellatrix awake in the living room. To her stunned horror, the curly-headed witch was bent over a blood-drawn ruin, wherein the center of that symbol, sat a doll made of straw wrapped up in a frayed ash black fabric that she couldn't help but noticed matched the same color of Voldemort's robes reading from a book titled, "De Amore Libri."
He was wrapped up in his own thoughts when a voice startled him out of his reverie. "Draco?"
For a moment, neither of them moved. Their breathing turned shallow as their eyes searched, hesitantly, for the other. Once they found each other's gaze and discovered neither of them was disturbed by what was going on, that's when the fondling began.
"Shut up! You don't know anything!" Little Tom screeched, eyes brimming with hot tears.
She waited for alarms to go off. For the angry voices of guards to break the air. But none of that happened. And Bellatrix unleashed a wicked laugh as Ariel and Lucius walked over to her.
“Not long.” He replied, his chin sitting on top of his white fist, studying her.
"So, you don't?"
Snape kept his head low the entire time but every once and a while he'd steal a sideways glance towards Voldemort and catch him smirking behind Ariel's beautiful hands.
He almost gasped. So, there was more to this dull world than what the adults at Wool's led him to believe. Mermaids and magic did exist.
At some point, a tipsy Draco looked up into Snape’s face to discover the man was sobbing quietly with a face that looked like it had lived a thousand years of misery. Heartbroken, Draco got up from his end of the table, walked over and curled his arms around the man’s neck like he used to do when he was a small child. He didn’t say a word as Snape sobbed all his grief into that hug. Even as he realized, with crystal shattering clarity, that he was done with this life. He was done giving loyalty to a heartless wizard. And he resolved, then and there, to never follow another one of Voldemort’s orders for as long as he should live.
"I'll be right back," she vowed as she bent over him to plant a kiss on his forehead. He tried to ask more questions but she cut him off with a soft whisper, "Go back to bed angelfish." The wizard fell back asleep instantly. Ariel smiled at her snoring lover, went to her messenger bag pulled out an empty vial, filled it with sink water then rushed downstairs towards the fireplace.
Ariel was the only one who didn't freeze under his impenetrable gaze. Bellatrix didn't dare breathe, let alone move. Narcissa and Lucius clung to another, refusing to let go, but didn't dare stand as the Dark Lord's eyes scanned over them with an unreadable expression.
"Flowers?"
Voldemort waited until Draco's frightened footfalls disappeared into the second floor before he asked with an exasperated sigh, "Must you undermine me in front of my servants?"
Lucius waited for her to explain but she never did. Instead, she got up, retrieved a set of clean clothes that she hid inside the Deluxe Circe Self-Stirrer 5000, handed them to him and told him, her fingers brushed against his pale backhand, "We should go. You know how much he hates waiting."
Ariel waited for him to read her letter to the editor and from him to realize why she swam all this way to see someone like him. His head lifted to find her hopeful eyes pinned to him.
Something shattered behind him. Next thing he knew he was being run down by the Dark Lord. He watched as the Dark Lord rushed to Ariel's side, furiously patting over his robes' pockets in desperate, almost frantic, search for something.
Snape watched her leap, dash, sprint, twirl, run in circles, attempt a cartwheel, fall to the ground laughing, get back up, and dance badly. He couldn't help but take pride in her unbridled joy.
"Did you find anything?" Amanda's voice cried out, nervously.
"You're just saying that..."
"Yes, and as much as I would love to be the one to kill Harry Potter, he has turned out to be an...impossbily hard child to kill. So, if I can't kill him, I'd be happy to just... watch him be forced to rip his own dick off and...slowly bleed to death on the cold hard ground, begging to be euthanized."
"Sorry, mom. I can't change who I am."
She glanced over her shoulder at him. "I thought you didn't teach potions anymore."
"I love you too, mom."
A few days passed. Within that time, Ariel's affections for Snape doubled. Their first date together was populated entirely by animated conversations on a variety of subjects (with the one glaring exception being their relations with Tom/ Voldemort). In their discussions, they found they were held identical positions on numerous subjects including but not limited to: potions, politics, culture, mythical beings rights, marriage, and parenting (to other's relief neither of them wanted children preferring rather being childless adults who did as they pleased for as long as they pleased). Severus managed to tell her his life story in 5 minutes and happily spent the majority of the evening listening to Ariel tell stories of herself, of her former life in the sea, of old adventures and of course, of her family.
"It means I," He said with a flourish of his arm, like he was an artist showing off their latest project, "Have an army of undead bodies. Who do as I command. Who attack without pain."
"Was a perfect gentleman."
A floating tea tray had zoomed around him in order to land on the coffee table that appeared out of thin air before the couch. Draco sidestepped in order to give the approaching Dark Lord room to take his position beside Ariel.
Ariel giggled. "I agree."
“Really?” He asked, somewhat surprised. “Hm, I didn’t expect him to tell you so soon. He usually dragggggs these things out for as long as he could.” He glanced at Troubled Ariel and said, “We don’t have to talk about this now.”
"AND no intimidation, no kidnappings or slaughtering creatures for fun."
Bellatrix was refilling her teacup when she asked, "So tell me about this creation of yours. What does it do? And what inspired you to make it?"
"Ugh, all these rules. I feel like I'm back in school." Ariel opened her mouth to scold him when Voldemort cut her off, "I was only teasing, mother. You know I'd do anything for you."
"I can't tomorrow. I have a date." She said without thinking.
"Wow," he breathed out in amazement eyes locked on her tail.
She frowned. What am I getting myself into? She wondered. “Is that how he got you?”
"You lie every time you open your fucking mouth!" She lifted her head in time for him to pour the copper-tasting liquid down her open mouth. She stalled. They all did.
"Must you be so mean to the kid? He's obviously scared shitless of you."
She waited for him in the garden. She sat at a round little patio table, watching two albino peacocks wander through the manicured backyard freely until eventually one of them got tired of being followed and attacked their companion for no discernible reason. Shrieks were made; talons were drawn. The squabble ended as soon as it started with one victorious and the other cut up, missing tufts of feathers, red streaking the immaculate white body.
"I'm disgusted with you." She said. With that, she turned on her heel and disappeared.
He loved ice fishing. Or his version of it anyway. He loved the cold and the wait and feel of ice crystallizing against his bare feet, melting then hardening then freezing against his flesh. He couldn't wait to peel his feet from the ice, yanking off a huge chunk of his flesh along the way nor more than he could wait for an unlucky fish to swim his way.
It was Tom's sixteenth beach day with Wool's but come New Year's Eve he would turn seventeen thus ending all legal obligation to stay in the muggle world. Free to live his life in the magical world, untethered by the past.
After which Ariel would repeat everything said during their conversations to Severus and he would relay any messages sent by Dumbledore.
"Start from the beginning." Voldemort interrupted encouragingly. "Whose idea was it to start day drinking?"
"Nor did I," Lucius croaked out with a convulsive sob as he squeezed Narcissa until his weak arms shook. He buried his head in her hair and whispered, "I missed you so…"
“What’s there to understand?” He asked, blankly.
Voldemort scoffed. "Bout time that boy did something useful." He muttered as he slowly settled into his chair.
"That's the most disgusting thing you've ever said to me," he said facetiously.
A momentary silence passed before he added, somewhat hesitantly, "Well, if you ever want to visit…you know where I'm staying." His head dipped down and she saw his wandless hand twitch. She feared for a second, he was going to reach for one of her hands but he never did. Instead, lifted his head and said with a chuckle, "Let's try to do this again before the next sixty years are up."
"Without the news finding out?" Bellatrix asked, nearly dumbfounded.
"Wouldn't know."
"Be quiet, you. Children should be seen not heard." Young Adult Tom sneered as he got from his imaginary feet to glide over his current self. "C'mon Voldemort. Chin up. Look at all you've done on your own. You're a half-blood. The bastard spawn of a silly witch and muggle scum. Yet you have purebloods worshipping your every move. You're so powerful your very name strikes fear into the hearts of millions. And in less than a year, you're going to be so powerful not even Death will be able to stop you. You've done more than most wizards will do in a thousand lifetimes. So why are you wasting time wallowing over whether or not some walking fish loves you?" Young Adult Tom punctuated his speech by shooting the child who was trying hard to rub away his tears a look of pure disgust.
"I sincerely hope not," said Tom with a shark-like grin. To Arista, he said, "Some of my favorite stories growing up were about the Blonde Bane of Belize."
"Ariel," Snape said with the sadness of someone bitterly familiar with regret. "You mustn't blame yourself."
Pause. "Mom?"
Look who's talking. How many confirmed deaths do you have on your conscious, Severus?
"You two can go back," Harry insisted, his feet turned sideways, towards the bar. "I'll be there soon."
From there, the conversation changed. Tom floated quietly while he lost himself in their various conversations, giving half-truths to questions when they were thrown his way, smiling often, occasionally darting out of the lagoon to sip from his collection of Polyjuice brew.
His free hand hovered over against his thigh, stiff with paranoia. But then he glanced down and saw his younger self clinging to her dress, pressing himself into her leg like she would fly away at any second if he didn't anchor her down. He took the vial and downed the rest of the contents in a single gulp. When he opened his eyes, the first thing he noticed was the shocked look in her face.
Tom listened quietly, his eyes averted to the ground, suddenly inexplicably embarrassed by her praise. The two of them lapsed into an awkward silence until Ariel broke it by saying,
There was a small silence then Ariel uttered the worst phrase in the English language, "Can we talk?"
"First: I want to say right away, I only killed those five people today out of self-defense so, you know, if you don't try to kill me, I won't try to kill you. It's just that simple." Ariel explained, her voice so airy and light it belonged better for conversations about the weather. But her voice was harsh and her blue eyes were narrowed as they moved across the room, saying, "And second, if any of you says something creepy, demeaning or sexual to me, I will not hesitate to make you rip your own genitals off and sing an old sailor's song while you bleed to death."
"No, unfortunately for all of you, we are still together."
"Perfect."
He slapped his breast pocket and felt the tiny vial. He then quickly uncorked it and reached forward to pour the contents down her throat.
Chapter Eight: Lady Ariel
"I...guessed that," Ariel replied, still in shock. "Um...uhhhhhh...I'm going to... ignore all of this if you do me a small favor."
"I'll be two hundred years old on the spring equinox." Ariel gave him a sparkling grin. "Why? You're only into young girls, professor?"
She smiled, deciding to believe him. "Mother?" She repeated with a mock-offense.
“And…Severus?”
He chuckled briefly then went quiet for a few seconds and asked, "Did you tell Draco Malfoy the Sebastian story?"
Ariel squirmed in her seat, unsure of what to make of this conversation. It didn’t feel like a win. But then again, he wasn’t reaching for his wand, which laid idly against his saucer plate, and she wasn’t struck dead either like she had expected.
“Yeah, and look where that got you,” he remarked.
Draco's face dropped. "You did?"
Nothing happened.
He turned his head and saw her stares. "What?" He glanced backward then laughed as he had just remembered something. "Thanks for reminding me." He said as he bent down to retrieve a small sack from his robes. He stuck his entire arm into the ridiculously small cloth bag and rummaged around until he finally pulled out a few articles of muggle clothes which he quickly threw on. As he dressed, he spotted Ariel's stares and told her, "Ma, it's just a tattoo. I got it 30 years ago."
"You can't keep using the dying card to keep being a wanker."
"I thought—" Fenrir choked out but Voldemort interrupted him with a Cruciatus Curse, sending an electric current of agony into the werewolf's body, unlike anything he had ever felt before.
But he didn't continue, instead choosing to look away from her as if suddenly shy.
Inverto Homonous, he thought fondly. One of his finest inventions. "I don't want to brag but... yes. How did you hear about that?"
"Yeah. Wow." She said sarcastically as she let her tail rest in the patch of unclaimed earth. Her eyes were narrowed and her posture was hunched as she continued, "I hate that tail more than I hate my enemies combined. And I have a lot of those."
"What the actual fuck are they?!"
"I love you too, Tommy."
Narcissa studied the pseudo-siren. "She seems…nervous."
She pressed the note into her chest, touched.
"Where are we going?"
"Thank you."
"Just the way she looks at you," Voldemort replied off-handedly. "Also, she told me earlier that she thinks your voice sounds like sex on a velvet rug during a thunderstorm."
They shared a devious smile as they continued to hurriedly dress themselves.
He smiled, bringing the cup to his lipless mouth. “Good.” He sounded like he meant it. “You know, I never would have pictured you two together.” With a snicker, he added, “He hates children.”
Eventually, Ariel remembered her plans and she prepared their leave by placing seashells in a circle on the ground, which Tom watched with a vague smile on his handsome face. He was filled with a joy he never knew or never expected to know. Everything was coming together for him: Albus was dying, no doubt the old man would be dead before the end of next year; he had more followers now than he did forty years ago; and soon, when he obtained the Elder Wand, his powers will be stronger than they ever were, even before his quasi-death; and now, on top of all that, he was apart of a family.
“Alright.” He said, setting his cup down and lifting his head to give her his undivided attention.
"And…you didn't?"
"I'm afraid not."
"I always knew Tom loved me..." Ariel began. "But Lord Voldemort's a different story."
Ariel stuck out her wet hand and Tom eyed it like a venomous snake before he took it and gave it a shake.
"Oh yeah, they know. Once a meeting's done, it's 'you don't gotta go home but you need to get the hell out'."
He jumped to his feet, threw off his pants, then the rest of his clothes, watching her hungrily as she fondled herself until, at last, he was as naked as she and slid into space beside her. They kissed, their bodies thumping against the other while their hands trailed underneath the blankets. Ariel grabbed him and gently brushed the tip of his penis against her vagina, holding his aching stares while she rubbed against his member and moaned at the ecstasy. Snape, unable to stand his desires, pushed himself into her hot, wet, velvety splendor with ease.
They stepped towards another to kiss but another heavy-handed knock interrupted them.
Narcissa, fearing if she didn't at least try to comfort him he would torture her for it later, pulled the blankets off of her, and bravely approached the fetal-positioned Dark Lord.
"Yeah, and look where that got you," he remarked.
Voldemort gave her a broad smile. "I've been saying that for years."
"Grab me a boning knife," he ordered as he began rolling up his sleeves. He must have remembered about Ariel because he added, "Please."
"Know this," He said, hanging his head above Greyback's terrified eye line, his face dark with guaranteed violence. "From this day forth, you will serve me. With nothing less than absolute devotion."
Ariel looked at him, her eyes moving slowly over his impassive face before she settled on a reply, "More than anything."
Ariel felt delirious standing before such a creation, who captured her wheezing reflection in its smooth golden base. "Oh, my cod…" She ran her hand against the cauldron's rim. She couldn't help but let out a high-pitched squeal at the soft feel. "Ahhh!"
“Got any tips, secret agent man?” Ariel whispered half-teasingly.
Ariel didn't say a word. Her mouth screwed tight, nose hooked upward, her blue eyes running.
She used a play from Narcissa handbook to ensure Dumbledore and Potter could explore that cave wouldn't running into her son.
Narcissa took Ariel's teacup full of wine from her then lightly grabbed her by the wrist, transporting them from the garden to inside the mansion. As the witch expected, Ariel hadn't acquired the leg muscles yet for apparition and crash-landed on the wooden floorboards. She helped her up then handed her back her cup which hadn't spilled a drop.
Voldemort inhaled deeply then smiled at the ceiling. The air smelled faintly of lemon drops and mothballs. "Ah, Albus." He said with a malicious smile as he slowly walked out of the doorway. "You just don't learn old man, do you?"
Ariel went quiet for a second then asked, "Is it true about you split your soul seven times?"
"Oh, professor." She gasped happily. Pleasure and bliss swam over her and she wanted him to know that he was doing great. "Oh, Severus."
It was a fair question. Nothing about the place, from its sticky hay-covered floors to its rampant zoo-like smells to its unwashed bathrooms to its cobwebbed ceilings and decidedly strange decor, screamed 'come for the cleanliness and ambiance'. It was one of those bars that locals loved because it was gross, it's old, it's without pretense, and you could disappear in the corners with your troubles and a pint of beer without having to pretend to be anything you're not.
Ariel rushed to the sandy bank, saying, "I'm just glad you made it." When she plopped herself beside teenaged Tom, she traced over his changing face with longing eyes. "Oh, Tom…You look so different every time I see you," She breathed, her hand reaching up to caress his beautiful, pale, sharp cheek. "When did you get so handsome?"
No one laughed until Voldemort laughed then everyone laughed.
It took everything in Draco to not run up and hug his mother when he found her. He wasn't ashamed to admit he missed her, and his aunt. But when he tried to catch their eyes as he took his seat at the dining room tablet all his mother did was squeeze his hand underneath the table before turning her solemn face downward, as if suddenly fascinated with the black wooden table she and her husband had owned for generations. He couldn't help but notice the manic glee in his aunt's eyes were gone. Something was wrong, he knew and when he looked across the table to find Snape with his hands folded out in front of him, nose pointed down like he was waiting for the worst, Draco felt his heart drop to his feet.
"What was the bet?"
"No problem, sweetheart." She replied as she went back to the onions.
Voldemort didn't watch him leave, his head was turned to the garden, wondering with small worry, did she leave?
Ariel smiled but said nothing. Her silence tempted Tom to search through her thoughts, to see what troubled her, but then Adella addressed him. "So, Tom, tell us about yourself."
He held the meeting in a rundown castle on the outskirts of Brasov. When Snape found him, the Dark Lord was standing before a dark almond-shaped window watching the midnight sky.
"What," Snape said, clearing his throat after a half-minute of intense deliberation over his next choice of words. "Makes you think that, My Lord?"
"It's almost midnight."
"This is too fucking weird." Bellatrix spat, folding her arms across her chest, frowning and glaring.
Snape frowned. "Nothing is ever easy when it comes to…"
He frowned, hard. "You're disowning me." He said it with the finality of someone who knew this day was coming for a long time.
"Don't tell me that," he snickered misty-eyed. "You'll never get rid of me."
I don't care, said a second voice as he combed through the tall reeds, his feet treading on squishy mud as he pulled himself closer to the body of water. Let it be the last thing I ever hear.
"Uh, irritating."
But Ariel's spit-covered bottom lip quivered. "That wasn't from motion sickness."
Voldemort rolled his eyes then pushed himself from the couch, announcing, "I'm going to get the boy before he assumes the worst."
"You have a beautiful home," Ariel said, wanting so badly to comfort this woman who carried sadness with her like a piece of jewelry she never took off and to distract herself from the growing dread in her stomach.
"My Lord... I have no idea what to say."
You wouldn't have guessed this couple didn't believe in public displays of affection the way they rushed to another with arms opened wide. Ariel awed loudly as the spouses shamelessly showered the other's face with a thousand kisses. Even Bellatrix, who never cared for Lucius, couldn't help by be endeared by the utter happiness in her little sister's face as she cried tears of joy and clutched her husband close, whispering, "I never thought I'd see you again."
"You could take everything from me and I wouldn't care in the slightest." He replied with a breathless quality that made her heart melt.
Ariel reached over and took the book from him. Then she got up, took him by the hand, and lead him to the couch. He took one end and she took the other. With the book propped up on her bended knees, she explained, "I figured we could read some of the stories together." She glanced over the top of the book and caught his stunned stare. "I mean if you're not too old to be read to."
She nodded; her pinkened face bowed into her hands as a rush of tears came over her. Snape dropped his gaze, wanting to comfort her but too awkward to do anything. Thankfully Ariel regained her composure within seconds and was able to squeegee her tears with her fingers before she continued, in-between sniffles, "That's why I came here. I was hoping you could surgically remove my tail and feed me limb regeneration potion." She went into her bag again and pulled out, to his dismay, a sparkling pearl-and-sapphire encrusted tiara from her modest bag and extended the treasure to him. "I'm willing to pay you handsomely."
Narcissa nearly burst out crying right then and there. Draco was half inclined to beg the Dark Lord to just kill him now. But before either could respond the Dark Lord had clamped a hand onto Draco's shoulder. A split second later Narcissa was alone in her luxuriate kitchen.
"Imagine you broke every bone in your body at once, got set on fire and someone cuts your heart out of your chest all at the same time."
"No, I sent her," Narcissa admitted, tearfully, as his fear became her own.
"My name's Ariel by the way. What's yours?"
Moments later, they were on Azkaban grounds being pelted at by strong winds and freezing ocean spray. Ariel managed to lock her knees in time and landed on dead, frosted grass upright. Before she was the massive, black towering pit of despair otherwise known as Azkaban. Ariel craned her head to look for the top of the prison but it disappeared in the stormy clouds above. She then glanced at Bellatrix who had her arms folded across her chest, smirking. An hourglass dangled out of her robe's pocket swinging violently in the blustery air.
"I'm Ariel no last name because mermaids don't have last names." She said, her eyebrow quirked with suspicion even as she slid her hand into his and gave it a cursory shake. "I thought you said you taught defense against the whatever arts."
"Where are you going, darling?" He asked, drowsily.
Pause. "Well…I…." Snape faltered then made another, longer pause. "He really cleaned the whole house without magic?"
Snape couldn't blame the wizard. He had just informed him of Ariel's discovery that on top of having 7 Horcruxes, they now knew for certain the rumors of Voldemort having an army of ravenous, undead, unfeeling beasts at his disposal was in fact not bullshit as they hoped.
"Um." Narcissa did not know how to answer that question without getting killed or maimed so she circumvented the question with another question. "My Lord, have you ever heard of the word association game?"
Draco secretly believed the dark mark sucked the ability to sleep out of you. Since he joined the Dark Lord's ranks, sleep eluded him.
The Malfoys eventually made it to the kitchen where they overheard the last bit of a story Ariel was telling:
"What kind of bullshit is this?" Bellatrix exclaimed, half-dismayed and half-seething with jealousy as she stood against the glass door that separated the kitchen to the giant, well-manicured, and albino infested garden with her sister. They were watching the Dark Lord hold an animated conversation with the red-headed land siren.
She started towards the house, already in tears, when she felt Voldemort’s hand reach down and grab her by the arm. Next thing she knew, he was pulling her into his body to embrace her. She didn’t pull away, merely buried her face into his chest as he rested his chin on her crown, patting her on the back as she wept and wept and wept.
One would think that after successfully getting away with murder and escaping to a luxurious log cabin in the middle of the picturesque mountains of Brasov Bellatrix would be happy but she wasn't.
Ariel blinked, stricken.
"Oh, well, they seem like real scaredy-cats," Ariel remarked. "Not like you. You're fearless."
"It's mind-numbingly asinine." He agreed.
"Six sisters?"
The Dark Lord was in a fantastic mood lately. His capricious temperament of before had tempered slightly since Ariel's arrival. While his bloodlust didn't disappear entirely, that would be deranged, he was slower to punish his followers and his cruelty was redirected to where it belonged: muggles, sub-creatures and blood traitors. And the Malfoys were grateful to be in his somewhat good graces again.
A sound broke her from her daydreaming and she snapped her neck from her hourglass to find Ariel calmly walking out of the prison entrance dragging her skittish-looking brother-in-law by the elbow.
"It was exceedingly nice to meet you, Miss. Ariel."
Silence was his only reply.
"What time is it?"
"Did you make me give the coin back to you?" Tom asked, modulating his voice so that it was less of a demand and more of a question.
"Just kidding. I actually don't give a shit." Voldemort laughed as he began to twirl his gnarly wand in-between his fingers. "I heard about the cursed necklace though. What a spectacular failure that turned out to be, right?" He laughed again while Draco and Narcissa withered in silence. "Oh, it's a hard lesson to learn, Draco, I'm sure. I know it's hard for a lot of people their first time. I mean, not for me, of course. By the time I was your age I already successfully gotten away with five murders but I understand everyone's different." With that, he stood up and walked from around the kitchen table. Draco and Narcissa's spines straightened instinctively as he ventured towards them with a terrible smile curled along his lipless mouth. "Which is why I thought of the perfect punishment. It's harsh but fair and I think it'll drive home a very important lesson that I think all Death Eaters should learn." He reached forward and grabbed Draco by the jawbone. He was so close Draco could smell the fresh blood on Nagini's breath. "You can't be afraid to get your hands dirty."
"Rutabaga," chimed in Arista her voice reminding Tom instantly of a red summer dawn.
"Uh, forgive me, My Lord, but aren't you...always...going on about how 'i have to be the one to kill Harry Potter'?"
He took her by the hand and breathed, "Yes."
"I had fun," Voldemort said with a small surprised laugh as if shocked he could still feel such trivial emotions.
The look on her face one would have thought he had admitted to cannibalism. "Don't say things like that Draco."
Voldemort wilted in his seat, looking mildly disappointed but unsurprised. "I know." He said. He lifted his lips and forced out a smile. "And I respect your… (sigh) moral objections."
"I got bad news Severus," Voldemort said once they were in the kitchen and the sound of Nagini tearing through sacrificial elven flesh like scraps of paper filled the back corner. "I think Ariel wants to fuck you."
He laughed, took another sip, placed his cup on the table, and said, "You're kidding right?" When the look of incomprehension didn't change in her face, he explained, "Do you know how long it took me to learn how to make another wizard rip his own dick off against his will? I'll tell you. Twelve years. It took me twelve years of practicing and studying and that was with the use of my wand. You did it with nothing more than your voice and then you killed four other people afterward like it was nothing! Do you have any idea how stupendous that is to me? Hell, I'm terrified of you!"
"Mom, no! It's not a sea sponge!" Voldemort cried over the sound of running water.
"No thank you, Lady Ariel," Draco said as he headed for the stairs, eager to get as far away from the Dark Lord and his oblivious mother as he could.
Draco fled to the soundproof master bedroom's bathroom to avoid hearing the familiar sounds that follow defying the Dark Lord: the pleas for mercy, the killing curse, and a loud, heart-stopping thud.
“I know this is difficult for you,” Voldemort said after another stretch of silence. “I know I am not at all what you hoped I would be.”
"Oh, Severus." She cried before their mouths reconnected and they rolled on the ground together until the desire was too strong for her and she broke apart, her voice husky voice begged, "Where the hell's this office?"
Ariel gave him a pained look. "I want to believe you."
Voldemort listened to her with the brightest, widest-smile on his disfigured face. "The fact that you know of my accomplishments means the world to me." He said. "I am…so thrilled that you are alive to see what I have become. When we met, I was nothing. A little nobody with nothing. No family, no skills, no focus, no purpose. But then you—you came into my life and you inspired me! You made me into the person I am today. Ariel, you're my origin story."
Ariel bent down to collect her seashells and carefully placed them back in her messenger bag. When she stood back up, she was stalled by what she saw. While his nakedness didn't startle her in the slightest, what she saw on his back made her stomach knot with alarm: A symbol she knew to be the Deathly Hallows took up the entire canvas that was his back. At first, she thought, this is simply a tattoo, done by some heavy-handed scratcher of an artist, but the longer she traced over his back with her eyes did what she saw made her blood run cold. The symbol looked as if it had been carved into his back. The lines were thick, raised and mangled-looking like an old scar of a brutal attack.
"Ha. Losers."
But this double-sided life was weighing her down. She didn't know how Severus did it for so long. The constant inner ethical turmoil, the perpetual fear of being caught, the endless shame... It was enough to drive her insane and she had only done this for a few months! How could she continue going on like this? She asked herself. Ariel's mind raced until the wee hours of dawn searching for the right answers, the right plan of action.
"Aw, thank you for asking. It's called the Voice Disguiser Potion. And, basically, it'll change your voice into any speaking creature so long as you have their spit." Ariel laughed a little too loudly when she explained, "See, I got the idea because…You see, a hundred years—wait, no a hundred and fifty years ago? Whatever. Back in the day, I used to hang out with pirates quite a lot. And you know pirates. Fun as hell but damned if those drunk bastards don't know how to behave. So anyway, one of my friends, Jack, got arrested for piracy—which is a bum rap in my opinion. I mean, how come its imperialism when politicians pillage and plunder countries for their sugar and rum but it's piracy when a bunch of drunks on their own boat does the same thing?"
He was still sending goodbyes when he and Ariel made their leave for the shoreline, waving and shouting as he walked backward, drunk on love, "Goodbye Auntie Adella. Farewell Auntie Adriana. Arrivederci, Auntie Arista. Adieu, Auntie Alana. Adios Auntie Aquatta. Au revoir Auntie Attina!"
"Goodnight, Miss. Ariel."
"Do you still think it's possible, Professor Severus?"
“But I hope,” he said his voice getting more distant and softer as her eyes got heavier, “You know, that I meant what I said back in the cave when I said that I would always love you.”
When her feet touched the ground, she was unnerved to find herself speechless underneath this hideous, smiling face. Adrenaline coursed through her lungs as she demanded, "Who are you? And how do you know me?"
Nagini tried cramming herself inside the chewed-out opening but found her head was too big. When that plan failed, she merely followed the sounds of the mouse's claws scratching up the wall.
"That went better than I hoped," Voldemort remarked with glee as he, back in his regular body, toed the stiffening corpse of Hippagibble Jukkas, an Auror who Snape knew was two days away from retirement. The poor man died where he stood which sadly was the barren, unlit living room of the Old Gaunt Place. "Ugh. I always hated that guy. Glad he's dead finally."
He smiled, bringing the cup to his lipless mouth. "Good." He sounded like he meant it. "You know, I never would have pictured you two together." With a snicker, he added, "He
"I can give you one now if you want," Narcissa offered calmly though inwardly she was eager to finally get a chance at some alone time with this creature.
"That's alcohol abuse, you know." Hermione pointed out, referring to his untouched Butterbeer.
"Yes." He sighed, rolling his eyes, looking more disappointed with himself than with her. He glanced at her and upon noticing her baffled expression, he said, "I would never force you to do anything you didn't want to do, Ariel." With another roll of his eyes, he muttered, "God, I'm going soft."
"You have a beautiful reading voice," Ariel said, proud, as soon as he closed the book. Voldemort made a disparaging noise. "I mean it! Your voice is soft like a spring breeze when you read."
The two sisters exchanged another set of bewildered glances. How could this be? They asked another silently. Is it really too good to be true?
"You're a teacher here?" She asked, lifting herself then turning her body to face him so that only the tip of her tail remained in the lake.
He let out an exasperated sigh. "Trust me, I'm aware." He paused, looking her over. "How does your hand feel?"
His voice was warm but he had that look in his face. Like he was desperate for depravity.
Insomnia came yet again and he did what he usually did to combat that terrible beast: masturbated, and when that failed, he went on a long stroll.
He read the headline and felt a wave of pride he hadn't felt in a long-time wave over him. Written however many months ago, when he was back at Spinner's End and he was thinking of his mother and how her depression had robbed her of life and how she spent all those years chugging elixirs, hoping it would undo what years of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his father and grandfather when she needed much more. He wrote it in a night and submitted it when he was day-tipsy and had nearly forgotten about its existence until now.
"Good morning Fenrir," Voldemort greeted with business-like politeness.
"Ariel." It came out of him like a summer breeze. She gave him a small smile when it passed his lips and he had to avert his gaze to the top of her head, so that he wouldn't get tongue-tied looking into her eyes, to tell her, "But you are on Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry property. And as a teacher here, I must inform you that for the safety of our students, anybody that isn't authorized to be on school property, must leave. So…please leave."
"Draco," The Dark Lord's tepid voice called for him when he was halfway up the stairs. Draco looked past the mop and broom his struggled to carry and saw Voldemort's cruel smile. "You forgot your sponge."
"I do think however that a powerful enough Glamour Charm would suffice in giving you legs."
"Tom?" She called out. "Tom are you here?"
"I am," Ariel confessed with a nervous laugh. She saw no point in lying. Everyone knew the wizard could sniff out a lie the way sharks could sniff blood from miles away. She continued laughing as she said, "No offense but you're a terrifying individual."
"Absolutely." Voldemort insisted.
"Is it true you had a basilisk for a pet?"
The air in the spacious room thinned. Nobody dared make a sign of mourning for the dead. When you're a Death Eater, death wasn't seen as a tragedy. It was seen as a mark of weakness not only for the individual and group but on the Dark Lord too. And the Dark Lord loathed failure.
"Albus thinks he has found another Horcrux."
He felt his autonomy slip away from his body as his head turned towards her against his will. He tried to be vindictive and refuse her gaze, but his eyeballs betrayed him and focused on her.
"I was almost worried if we stayed any longer, the effects would've worn off right in front of them," said Tom as he pulled off his muggle clothes and got back into his robes. "Could you imagine?"
"We only asked because we made a list of words we wanted him to say," insisted Adriana with her cheerful lisp pointing to an area of sand where words were had been written with a finger.
"Fuck," Harry and Ron groaned.
Ariel looked down at her hands, the steam from her cup wafting against her forehead as she searched through the words she wanted to say next.
"Like elf shit? I'm aware." Draco said, lifting his head to reveal a haggard, shallow face and a pair of empurpled, puffy eyes. He rubbed his temples and asked, "Who were you talking to?"
His mouth quirked like he was struggling not to cry. "Neither Tom nor Voldemort would ever hurt you."
"Twenty-five," she sighed, letting her hand drop to her side. "I don't even remember my twenties."
He left the frozen lake once he caught enough fish for the three of them. His bloodied footprints trailed the frozen lake and disappeared into the back door of the old house.
He reconsidered her advice. She wasn't telling him he had to make friends like all the teachers and social workers told him to, but she did make a good point. Things were easier whenever he had someone else there to take the fall for his plans.
A beleaguered sigh from behind announced Voldemort's presence. "I should have known by now nothing scares you."
Eventually, the dementor halted and angled itself at a cell. Ariel peered inside. A man with scraggly white-blonde hair laid in a heap against the concrete floor on his bed which was nothing more than a thin, uncomfortable-looking mattress and a small threadbare blanket, too little or thin to bring any real warmth, especially in such a chilling place. He didn't even lift his head when she stuck her face in-between the metal bars to get a closer look at him. His face was obscured by the shadowy cell.
“Good. Use that. Better to be scared of him than to let him trick you into a false sense of security.”
To her surprise, a black iron tea kettle came down from the sky followed by two porcelain teacups. The steamy teakettle poured out a generous serving into each cup, using its spout to nudge one in front of her and the second to the other side of the table before settling down in the center, hopping down on a black doily like a frog returning to its Lilypad.
"Well yeah... not like I need them." He affirmed, trying to sound like his usual arrogant self. "I can still take over the world on my own."
Hermione lifted her head with intrigue. "Really?"
"Because I won't let him."
Ariel pointed at her crown which shot out little balls of confetti and light while steel drums rang out a cheerful tune. "See?"
"You don't even know what the job is," he retorted.
Then they locked eyes and for a moment neither of them moved. They merely stood there, staring at the other as if frozen by their incredulity. They were breathless with nerve-rattling fear, insurmountable joy, tremendous agony, and heart-pounding relief.
"Fine. Don't tell me. I'll just ask her when I meet her."
They both cringed, audibly. He was listing the names of her sisters, proving that he had read all the books he swore he read about her.
But he was snickering and grinning broadly at her. "Why do you have such a soft spot for pathetic boys?"
"Dear husband," she said passionately as they kissed. "I'm so glad you're back."
"Thank you," Narcissa replied. "We inherited it from my husband's parents. It had been in his family for over fifteen generations."
"You're not part siren by any chance? Like, maybe on your mom's side or something?"
It was the first time she had ever called him her son aloud.
She came to in frozen weightlessness with a closed-mouth gasp. Every inch of her body was tied up with invisible ropes. Even her open eyes weren't spared. The magical ropes pressed hard against her eyeballs, rewarding every twitch she made with a painful throb.
"Young?" Lucius blurted out, unhinged by the surrealness of the scene: this red-headed woman, who looked young enough to date his son, talking to the Dark Lord like she knew him for years, sharing a drink and a laugh with the man like he wasn't the most dangerous apex predator to walk the face of the Earth, and most bizarrely, all the while Bellatrix sat by without so much as a hint of jealousy in her eyes, like all of this was normal.
His face contorted instantly. Color grew within his cheeks, hair produced at remarkable speed and, to her heart-stopping surprise, a face she once knew returned. In less than a minute's time, a twenty-something Tom Riddle stood in Voldemort's robes wearing the widest smile.
"Severus," he said amicably turning his attention to the witch. "How was your winter break?"
His friends laughed away.
“It is,” Ariel admitted, her thoughts once again drifting back to that boy in the cave whom she used to dream about, often in this very scenario, just the two of them in bed together, him resting his adorable little head into her chest while her fingers ran through his thick, black hair. Only now when her fingers reached for his head all she found was the cold touch of bare skull. She felt another crying fit come over her but she was too exhausted to produce anymore tears. Not for this man.
"It was my pleasure," Snape said, making sure his lips barely parted so the words came out in a soft rumble turning Ariel's sweet smile into a lusty lopsided grin.
"Boil for an hour, stir regularly until it turns blue and add a pinch of cinnamon for taste!" They recounted simultaneously before they burst into laughter.
With that, the Dark Lord left but Lucius and Narcissa waited, holding absolutely still, until the familiar sounds of apparition winds told them they were alone and, temporarily, safe from his wrath.
"I think this is the wettest I've ever been, out of the ocean." She breathed before she straddled his hips and started riding him.
"I am." She lifted her head to unleash a dozen kisses onto his cheek and side of his face, squeezing him tight, telling him, over and over, "I'm so proud of you!"
He hugged her for what felt like an entire hour in silence. She planted her ear against his chest while he rested his chin on her crown. For a while, they stood there, in the middle of that old house, listening to each other's pulses, breathing in each other's scent. To her, he smelled like sand and seaweed. To him, she smelled like coconut oil and the Earth before a thunderstorm.
Dumbledore took a swig of the liquor bottle and rasped loudly. He despised the stuff. The smell, the taste, it was all vile, but he was tired of the pain that coursed from his fingers to his core and sometimes traveled down his nerves, making his hands gnarly shaky and weak. And worse, his body was constantly cold and clammy. Drinking warmed his cheeks and gave him the fire he needed to remember what he was staying alive for: to take Tom cockface Riddle down once and for all.
"You would hope so," Bellatrix said with bitter disappointment. She thought of all the times (19 since she got out of prison to be precise) she had thrown herself at the Dark Lord only for him to rebuke her, again and again, and again. She unfolded then refolded her arms, too agitated to stand still but too stubborn to move from her spot. This was torture. Only this worse, because she actually liked being tortured. T
"That's the only one I'm afraid," Ariel said. "For now. If I get any more embarrassing stories, I'll be sure to share."
Tom? Draco thought. He didn't even know the Dark Lord had a first name.
She hadn't been in that old house for more than a few minutes, having Floo Powdered from the warmth of the Hogwarts bed to brush her hair and teeth before she would dart off to meet her all six of her sisters off the coast of some nameless beach when she was jolted out of mindless contentment by the sound of an angry voice hissing, "If I don't find that fucking book I'm going to slaughter every single fucking person in this deadbeat town."
Snape said nothing while the Dark Lord sawed off the wizards head with his wand and after enough blood poured out the wizard to fill a bathtub, picked up the severed head, studied it for a moment with a vague smile, then kicked it into an empty corner where it bounced off the cobwebbed wall and landed, upright, with a loud squishy like thud that would haunt his dreams for the rest of his life.
"I know you hate goodbyes…"
Ariel went to Malfoy manor first, thinking he would be there either torturing the Malfoys or torturing someone else at the illustrious manor.
"I'm afraid there are few options," Snape informed her, holding her close to him afraid that this was going to be one of his last chances to feel her body pressed against him or to be the focus of her crystal blue's eyes. "You can either reverse the glamor charm and go back to the ocean…"
"Dray, let Blaise check it for you okay? Professor Snape isn't a threat."
"Can we walk with you when you get your arm checked out, Potter?"
Harry soon realized he wasn't as completely helpless with school as he thought. Before, when he was in Gryffindor, Ron and Hermione were constantly worrying him or distracting him from school. Ironically enough, Hermione spent so much time nagging him to do his schoolwork he never had the time. He and the silver trio had went to Charms and Divination either the Ravenclaws already, he found it immeasurably easier with a quieter group. His friends internally cheered realizing he wasn't brainless like they had thought before. The smaller boy was a bit worried though because next they had Potions with the Gryffindors. When the trio caught on to his worries, they made sure to keep close to him in the halls. It made him smile, the "golden trio" had never been like that. He shivered slightly when Draco's wings brushed against his shoulder, his face flushed a light pink as he continued to walk.
The crying boy looked up at the painting with big, hopeful eyes. The founder cooed at the boy, and smiled softly. The sniffling boy nodded his has hesitantly, a bit confused to wear he would sleep. The founder, as if reading his mind, chuckled and spoke up once again.
"I'm sorry Pansy, I didn't realize I was keeping you against us."
She yelled at him, the other Gryffindors gasped. They had never seen her act like this, but Harry had a few times. Before Hermione had time to react, Pansy had hexed her five different ways. Draco had wrapped his arms around Harry protectively, while Blaise snuck into the classroom to tell the potions master what Hermione had done. The Veela was seeing red, no one hurts his friends and gets away with it. His wings instinctually wrapped around the shaking boy, before he made a throaty noise at Pansy. She looked up at him and realized his Veela side was in control, so she stepped into his open wings embrace to make him relax a bit. She had to admit, it did feel safer than out there with all the Gryffindors out there, though she noticed a majority give her thankful looks. She heard little sobs, as she looked up at Draco panicking slightly he coped at her softly before tightening his arms around the crying boy. The two of them could hear him repeating concerning things.
"Hey Dray? Can Pansy and I brush your wings? You're still pretty tense and it'll help."
When mates officially accept each other. It can be referred to when/if they make love as well. As3xual mates, since they never make love physically, usually do other intimate affections but both are valid. Once they have officially mated a mark appears on their neck signifying their lover(s).
"Well, well, well, I think our 'pup' deserves his treat huh?"
"M-May I sit here? Mr. Salazar said I should but I don't want to intrude..."
Draco said, his voice showing his amusement. His head of house nodded before sending the silver trio off. He looked at the table to find something was left for him as well. A single white lily. His face almost betrayed him to show his smile. He grabbed the flower softly, putting it in a soft black vase on his desk before he headed for the Great Hall. Salazar was missing from his painting which was quite curious, but he was sure there was an equally curious reason. Once he arrived he saw the Slytherins whispering among themselves, the trio seemed to have started spreading the news already. He sat down at his seat, next to the Librarian and the Headmaster. He saw the Potter boy walk in, his two friends beside him, although it seemed like they were chewing him out for something. Curious. He then noticed that Salazar was standing in a large Landscape painting on the wall behind Slytherin. He saw the founder's eyes light up when he saw the boy and sighed. This was going to be a long morning.
Blaise said with a smirk, chuckling as the boy was flushing red. The smaller boy sat down next to Draco, appreciating their kindness.

Creature Inheritance is when magic users get the powers from their nonhuman blood on their 16th birthday. Not everyone has creature blood of course, but it's common too. The process is painful but it only lasts about a week before it is fully completed.
Harry said, disappointed in himself. He had managed to eat almost half, which was impressive. He looked down, not wanting to see if they were upset at his failure. Draco grabbed his chin, soft but firm. The touch made Harry unconsciously lean into it, causing some fellow housemates to smirk lightly.
"You can sit with us, Potter. Welcome home."
"The headmaster is glaring at him, that old fool."
"Oh shut up, I'm not here for you. I'm here for my friend, so back off you slimy snakes."
He all but cooed at the boy, his tone oozed comfort, even if the others could not understand what he said, it was obvious the founder had a soft spot for the timid boy, which was quite heartwarming too watch.
I deeply apologize for my intrusion. I was quite upset last night and stumbled upon Mr. Slytherin's portrait and we talked for a bit, maybe because he hasn't had any other parselmouth to talk to in ages. He offered to let me stay here for the night since it was well into the morning hours when we finished talking. I promise I cleaned everything I used just in case, I completely understand if you tell Professor Snape or think I deserve a punishment. Thank you all again for having me, even if you weren't aware I was here.
"Why did you shove me, Granger?"
"Little speaker, could you go to where you were sorted in first year, please?"
He trailed off, grinning sheepishly and rubbing the back of his neck nervously. The trio suddenly grabbed his left hand, which rested on the table.
"I am Nox, I am also a girl."
"N-No sir, I am afraid I might to cry Mr. Salazar."

"I can talk to them, remember? I think I may be able to find a familiar if I'm lucky."
He said, sternly. Unsure why he was being so soft towards his former rival, but he supposed he would find out soon. His friends agreed loudly, a fire burning in their eyes. He watched as the smaller boys eyes widened, before he smiled, pink dusting his cheeks at the eye contact.
Harry said, gently squeezing Draco's hand. He wasn't sure why but Draco had insisted on holding his hand. Harry was secretly very happy, he never would have dreamed he would be able to hold his crush's hand but here he was. Blaise and Pansy had laughed and called Draco clever, but he chose to ignore them with a huff. Snape had just rolled his eyes, but he has a fond look in his eyes.
Snape let out a deep sigh and shook his head. "I'm worried about her."
"So, you wouldn't have a problem if she and I started an…intimate relationship?"
Four plain tombstones awaited them in a single row with the exception of one lonely and noticeably smaller slab which hung in the back of the lot by a craggily oak tree in a grassless plot of land that couldn't be reached by the sun, like an outcast. The ones closest to the house were hidden by patches of tall grass, their names and their years on Earth defaced by rain and cruel passage of time.
"Yes. Although, admittedly, I only recently did so."
"So soon?" Adriana asked sadly.
"You're not going to die," Voldemort shouted, his voice rising out of frustration that he couldn't find the anti-venom fast enough (but, also, because panic crying grated his ears).
"On the contrary, I prefer grown women," Snape replied with a lecherous smile. "Although I am relieved to know I'm not robbing any cradles."
"You are in the rare presence of royalty," the Dark Lord announced as Ariel made slow deliberate steps to the head of the chair and took her place while he stood. "Everyone, joining us today is former princess Ariel. Daughter of Triton, granddaughter of Neptune but more impressively, you are looking at the leading cause of death amongst muggles from 1813 to 1865, second only to war and disease. You may remember her from your old Care of Magical Creatures textbooks as the Great Viper of the Seven Seas but lucky for us she had made the permanent move to land and graciously accepted my invitation to tonight's meeting."
“Keep reminding him of your usefulness,” Snape offered. Then he took a step back and suggested, half-seriously, “Play scared if you can. He loves being feared.”
"I've changed Tom. I got better."
Bellatrix and the Malfoys waited with bated breath as Voldemort digested her story. Though all of it was true, it wasn't a matter of getting him to believe in you as much as it was about the truth pleasing him. Sometimes, it was just as bad to lie to the Dark Lord as it was to be the bearer of bad news.
"Of October?"
"Who's that?" Ariel asked as she swung her legs over the edge of the bed and picked his cloak from the ground.
Ariel smiled then shot a look towards Snape who orbited to the side as Draco and Narcissa shared a goodbye. Her mind drifted to the other night and a carnal fire was reignited in her.
"Not at all, no," Snape admitted readily.
"Wow…" She gaped as her head swirled around to observe it all the beauty from the glorious architecture to the luscious tapestries to the moving staircases to the hidden passageways that Snape lead them through to the ghosts passed by them with disinterest to the paintings who yelled at Snape for the light emanating from his wand 'ruining their beauty sleep'. "This place is beautiful. Almost makes Atlantis look like a crackhouse."
"It's an honor to be able to shelter you," Narcissa said with another quick bow.
She had tons more. "Is it true you put a tracker on your name?"
"But what about the Great Viper of the Seas? You used to be the living nightmare for sailors and the British armada! Now, you're so...ugh, kind, and, ugh, compassionate. It's sickening."
"But you don't?"
Voldemort, knowing her thoughts, said, "It's such an awful club."
"Really?"
She pulled a book from the pockets of her robe and handed it to her. It was a copy of an old book, "The Seven Sirens of the Great Seas".
Ariel didn’t say anything. Enervation was taking over her and she felt like she was slipping back into another dreamless sleep.
"I hate you!" The eight-year-old boy screamed, punching and kicking the Dark Lord who took the abuse without resistance. "This is all your fault!"
"Well, hello to you." Ariel cooed.
"Actually, he doesn't bother me at all. He and Ariel only visit each other, at most, once a week, and every time I enter the room he makes an excuse to leave."
Pain drives sane men to do desperate things. And Dumbledore didn't consider himself anything close to sane.
Snape said nothing as he turned his head and looked everywhere besides the slain body of the wizard he just murdered. Thomas Fiddlebicker, newly retired. A longtime friend of Scrimgeour. Imaging the old lion-faced wizard's reaction from finding out a close friend had been murdered combined with the guilt of being that murderer, pained him like a repeated stab to the chest.
They landed on a cold blustery deserted beach at the opening of a cave. In a rare moment of tact, Bellatrix left as quickly as she appeared leaving Ariel to be pelted by gelid piercing winter winds and sending her flying for the cover into the opening of the cave.
She landed in an ankle-high pile of ashes, which shot back up into the narrow chimney and stung her mouth and eyes, causing her to cough. She was waving away tendrils of smoke when she stepped out of the fireplace to find Bellatrix, Narcissa and Voldemort dripping from head to toe in blood, each pointing a wand directly at her.
She looked down at herself, having forgotten she had tugged on her swimsuit mere minutes beforehand. "I am. I'm going to go to visit my sisters."
Voldemort let out a heavy sigh tilting his head to the ceiling. "I guess..."
Voldemort went to touch her back but retracted his hand once he touched cold sweat.
She rushed to the gate, trailed by Snape. By the time he reached her side, she had her head bent into her hands, shoulders shaking as she let out a tiny, peep of a cry.
"Oh?"
Ariel didn’t say anything. Instead, she propped herself against the ultra-plush pillows, then turned her head all the way towards him, giving him a weak but heartfelt smile. Then, she pushed herself into the middle of the giant bed and gestured at him to join her.
"Yes," Narcissa informed with a closed-lipped smile as Ariel dashed over to the cauldron, with the zeal of a child who spotted a coveted toy.
Ariel was singing to herself with her back to the opening when Draco emerged into the modest kitchen. The sound of her melodic voice mixed with the loud cacophony of her loudly chopping onions.
His outburst caused the three seated adults to turn their attention to him and Narcissa who was quietly conjoining seats for them.
So what?
“I love you too, mom.” He whispered, holding her head in his hands until the light slowly faded from her eyes and her body slumped backwards into the sea of softness.
"So, where's lover boy?" He heard the Dark Lord ask, referring to Snape.
Tom beamed at her, eyes stinging, lips shaking from smiling too hard. She held out her hand for him and he propelled himself into the waters to reach for it.
For a while, they merely held each other. Until Tom pulled himself out of her embrace and asked, somewhat sheepishly, "Will you sing to me?"
He looked her over, unconvinced she got away without at least a bruise or a mark. But when Ariel caught his wandering eye, she gave him an unharmed wink.
Chapter Two: Sleepless Night Part One
From there, they started fucking. Snape made powerful, intense thrusts while Ariel clung to him like a horny tree frog, her legs wrapped around his waist tight, and her hands clasped around his neck her face slack from pleasure.
"May I ask, why?"
"I wanted the freedom, mate. I wanted to get off of class at noon tomorrow and know that I'll have sixty hours of not having to do anything to look forward to."
She felt…fine.
As he and his two-ton fire breathing death machine soared through the troposphere, intent on
"Severus Snape." He corrected with a charmed smile of a man who experienced serendipity for the first time in his life.
Voldemort's deformed mouth widened and curled into a broad grin. "Anything else?"
"Spare me from what?! He's aching for a reason to cut my head off. If I don't do this—"
"What's more important?" The young man asked, leaning closer, his eyes still narrowed on the emotional child. "Being the greatest wizard who ever lived, becoming a literal God, or being mediocre and happy?"
"It looked like a scar."
It was then that Ariel caught a whiff of something sweet and pungent. Something she'd never smelled before.
"Trust me."
"You must think I'm the clingiest witch..." Voldemort joked, his head resting against her thigh, ashamed of the tear marks he left on her dress.
"The black one. The one you were looking for when we visited my sisters."
But Voldemort didn't respond. His eyes were still set on the blackness above with unfocus.
“I don’t know. He seems pretty fond of that…” She snapped her fingers, trying to jog her memory. “Shrine boy.”
But he was desperate. And that's what sent him there. To the old Gaunt place.
"Are you sure?" Snape asked, cautiously. "Because…there's no shame in admitting you…desire her…"
He was relieved to heard movement on the other side of the door. He was so sleep-deprived he barely stirred when he heard a distinctly feminine voice ask, "Who's that?"
"Superfluous."
AUTHOR'S NOTE: GET READY DRARRY FANS THIS CHAPTER'S FOR YOU
"You know what? I agree, Ron. It is a good day." Harry said, closing his textbook. "We should do something to celebrate this good day."
"They might be. People die every day. I'm not responsible for all the deaths in the world."
Each time the sound of a knife connected with a cutting board jutted Draco's racing heart. He looked around for the Dark Lord but it was only them.
"We should give the married couple some privacy," Bellatrix said to Ariel, feigning annoyance at their affections.
"It's a damn shame he didn't stay dead," stated Alana.
Worse, she could feel Death was nearby, standing before her. She felt their presence like a panic attack.
Ariel hesitated. "Do you really want to know?"
“Thank you,” she rasped after she chugged the entire glass and set the empty cup on a nearby nightstand. She raised herself up and asked, “How long was I out for?”
A deadly silence penetrated Diagon Alley as a stand-off ensued between the lone woman and the remaining Death Eaters. Ariel unhinged her jaw and bellowed out an ear-shattering roar that rattled the buildings, blowing brick and mortar asunder. Debris fell onto more death eaters and squished them out of existence in a second. When the dust settled, Ariel stood there, defiant and glaring at the rest of the witnesses, daring them to try again. None of them did. They scattered like ants. Ariel went to turn but before she could a high-pitched woman's voice yelled out, "Petificus Totalus." Her body planked and crashed into the stone ground, unable to hold her own hands out to break her fall. She landed hard. When she tried to get up, she was horrified to discover her body and her mouth were bound still.
"You don't have to fail. Let me do this for you!"
Bellatrix and Narcissa exchanged befuddled glances before Narcissa said to Ariel, "Have you…used it?"
Fenrir wagged his furry chin to the backyard bearing a razor-sharp-tooth grin. "Don't be bashful, my lord." He said with a wink. "We all have weaknesses. But I'll tell you right now. Give me a couple of days alone with the red-head and I'll swear my allegiance to you right now."
"It must have been constant chaos."
"Ariel, you already know Narcissa." Voldemort introduced lazily. "This is Narcissa's son, Draco. One of our newest recruits. He's also the owner of the room you'll be staying in tonight."
"Good. Probably for the better." He agreed. Then, with his elbow pressed into his armrest, he leaned towards her and explained in a hushed tone, "I have a meeting with the Full-Blooded Giant Mafia in the morning that's best have clandestine."
She knew, the way most people who spoke with Voldemort knew, he was probably lying but she ignored it in order to appraise him. It had been nearly two months since they last saw each other and he looked terrible even for him. The white in his eyes was streaked with red and he bore the haggard, shallow-faced expression of a man who hadn't seen sunlight in many weeks. Purple and green veins glistened against his bald head like fresh claw marks.
At first, he didn't mind. It was summer anyway when it started. And he enjoyed the long nights alone to enjoy the silence of his house. He found them tranquil. Besides, nobody cared when he slept the mornings away. His mother had too much on her mind anyway. He supposed he'd be a wreck too if the love of his life was wallowing away in a blackhole while she lived with the worry that he'll die before she'll ever see him again. In her defense, she did try to keep a brave face for him while he was home. But that wasn't to say she didn't try to talk to him about what was going on. Though, she couldn't offer him assurances. To her credit, she was never a mother who sugarcoated things for him. She told him things he already knew. Like how they had to be extra careful now. How things were going to be bad, for a while, before they'll ever start to look good.
"It's not that hard," Ariel replied. "The dementors at that place are dumber than jellyfish. Plus, most of the guards there aren't paid enough to check on the prisoners every hour like they're supposed to."
"Two presents? I barely deserve one."
Pandemonium ensued as the six sisters dissipated into an excited frenzy. Adella, Adriana, and Arista pushed Ariel aside so they could group tackle hug Tom off his feet and proceed to lavish the young man with soft pinches, sloppy kisses, intrusive questions, and adoring praise.
"Oh Tommy," she said, feeling cherished and ready to dote the hell out him when a thought crossed her mind and her face changed. "Wait. Why did you get me flowers? Is someone dead?"
True…
Ariel said nothing.
"I've always been kind and compassionate. If I wasn't, we never would have met."
Her mouth fluttered open but no sound came out. He waited, watching her struggle to find the right words, but then the sound of footfalls approaching made him lift his eyes. It was Narcissa. "My Lord, Fenrir is here to see you."
"Yes," Ariel said confidently.
Bellatrix hummed patiently while she watched the sand pass through her hourglass. The siren still had ten minutes to lose the bet.
The searing pain was replaced with a burning pain which was replaced by a dull pain and eventually was replaced by the relieving absence of pain. She picked up her woozy, sweat-covered head to find Snape staring at her lower half, looking mesmerized. She lifted herself onto her elbows and when she looked down to see the dreadful tail was gone, replaced by two bare legs, she sobbed from joy.
Handsome Tom gave her an odd smile then he took a step towards her and wrapped his arms around her. "Yes, I do."
"I forgot about this article." He said, his voice barely louder than a whisper as emotion bubbled up from within. He lifted his head and found her eyes on him. The mere flicker of her eyelashes sent his butterflies into his stomach and blood to his dick and he had to push away thoughts of her moaning his name as he cleared his throat and said, in his normal voice, "I'm glad my words positively resonated with you."
"Yeah, I bet you don't. So, where were you all day? Pretty weird that you're out of school all day the same day five Death Eaters are murdered."
"Adella, Alana, Aquata, Arista, Attina, and Adrina."
"I'm going to go too," said Ariel as she wrapped an arm around Attina who happened to be nearest.
"It was in the August issue. It was the 'Voice Disgusting Potion'."
"Well, I stand corrected," Bellatrix replied with a cat-like grin as their fingers intertwined, readying themselves for departure. "I got to admit I
"Well, unless you get assigned more homework by your other two classes," Hermione replied.
"Aww…"
Ariel's face twisted into an involuntary grin. Then she slid her hand into his and gave it a tight squeeze. "I'm glad too. Let's get out of here."
Harry's eyes narrowed but then he rolled them, as if suddenly too mature for bickering and petty insults. "It's a figure of speech, pervert."
"Thank you, Lady Ariel."
The Dark Lord and the fake-siren shared a laugh. She ground her teeth so hard her molars they nearly turned to dust. "This is bullshit."
Voldemort laughed. "You're kidding, right? The woman's a literal god. Or she might as well be one. Her grandparents were gods, her father was a demigod. The woman can make a person rip their own genitals off just by telling them to. I've wanted to do that since I was 8. Hell, that power alone is half the reason I want to achieve immortality so badly so I could spend the next however many years learning how to do that with just my mind. I want to be just like that woman. Also," He paused to look around the room to make sure they were alone. Then with his piercing blue eyes boring into Snape's soul, he added, "I'm only going to tell you this because you two are going to be intimate soon and it'll probably come up anyway but," His face softened slightly. "Some of my few good childhood memories were with Ariel." Snape didn't dare speak while Voldemort's eyes went dreamy and distant. "I remember…when I first got the news that I was a wizard. I snuck out to tell her. I suspected she knew I was magic but she pretended to be surprised when I told her. Then she spent the whole night asking me about what I wanted to be, the classes I would take. She even found an old tie from her collection and showed me how to do a Windsor knot."
The Malfoys were foolishly hopeful.
Voldemort dropped his head. He didn't know which Death Eaters she meant specifically but any loss to the organization was at best an inconvenience and at worst a shitshow coming in slow motion. "Fucking fuck." He growled, lifted his head, and asked, "Who did this? Did you get them?"
Mid-Day Thursday (5 hours after the Diagon Alley Incident)
Stunned, she snapped her neck back at Voldemort to see him tuck his wand into his pocket looking pissed but not as angry as before.
Draco had to will himself not to flinch at the sound of the Dark Lord's name. A cold chill came over him as the images of previous nights' events replayed in his head. "I have no idea what you're talking about, Potter." He replied coolly, taking a swig from his glass. "I don't work for the Dark Lord."
Ariel let out a panicked yelp then bolted out of her chair, pushing Nagini onto the floor as she darted for the sponge that fell to the floor then hightailed it for the kitchen. "Sponges can't be out of the water that long!"
Dumbledore waited until he heard the footfalls disappear from the living room to apparate, camouflaging himself to blend into the walls. He pointed his invisible wand at the window, his aim set on the back of Voldemort's head.
"Oh, that Wiley Bastard got out fine without my help," Ariel assured. "But it did make me ask myself if only there was a way for me to lend my non-mermaid friend my magical voice so he could talk his way out of getting wrongfully executed. Or you know, prank each other. And that's when it hit me. So, to make a long story short, I spent the last…oh…century perfecting the formula? Finally figured out the ratio last year. And bam! You are looking at a published potions maker."
"I loved it. I was the baby so I always had someone to play with or someone to annoy."
"I'm sorry. Forgive a dying man's crude attempt at gallows humor."
"Merope." Even with her lovely voice, she couldn't improve such an ugly name. Tough break, she thought sadly. But then again, what's an ugly name in compared to forever being known as the woman who gave birth to the darkest wizard who ever lived?
Hermione charged towards him, mouth opened, ready to lecture him into coming with them but then a horrible wrenching noise came out of her. To Harry and Ron's disgust, she was doubled-over, puking up the four Butterbeers and plate of fried pixie fingers she consumed that night.
At some point, he remembered himself and pulled himself out of the reverie to find dutiful Snape quietly waiting for him to return to the present.
The walk from Draco's bedroom to the kitchen felt like an endless death march. It was all she could do not to sob the entire way, least her cries encourage the Dark Lord's callousness. Draco made no pretenses to hide his fears either which is when Narcissa took to the Dark Lord he squeezed her hand the entire way.
"Who?" Snape asked confused.
You hoped her love would turn you into a better person. Well, lucky for you she's a piece of shit too. It's probably better for you now. At least you know she's not too good for you.
"Lucius Malfoy."
"Yes—yes, my lord." Greyback stuttered in a croaky voice of someone who just had their throat stomped on. "I swear—I swear."
"I don't know why," Bellatrix said acrimoniously. "I spent twelve years in Azkaban for that man. I barely got a thank you. This fishy bitch is here for two hours and he thanked her forty times for being "a spectacular influence on him"." Then, Bellatrix gasped. "You don't think he wants to fuck her, do you?"
This garnered a collective "aww".
Ariel played with a lock of his black wavy hair and began to sing,
"Azkaban."
All conversation died the moment the Dark Lord stepped into the room.
His face was that of such pure loathing, burning, eyes narrowed with that terrible glint in his eyes that she saw all those months ago, when she was just a kidnapped enemy, before she was special to him. His mouth was a tight line. Then a horrible second later, his lips parted wide when he threw his arm above his head.
Ariel looked down at her hands, the steam from her cup wafting against her forehead as she searched through the words she wanted to say next.
"Look what the catfish dragged in," observed Adella with her honeysuckle lilt as they swam to the edge of the waters to greet the pair. "Where's Severus, baby sister? Don't tell me you've already traded in one human for another."
"Sorry I'm late," he announced, as he climbed down from the rocks to find Ariel swimming patiently in the same area he first met her. "Someone syphoned the gas from the bus again so we had to walk the rest of the way."
"I had to make sure." He said as he wordlessly conjured a handkerchief with his wand and handed it to her. "For some reason, I have a hard time believing people aren't always trying to kill me."
"I don't think we should…" Dennis began fearfully, taking timid glances over his shoulder to the mouth of the cave.
"No."
The mouse waited for a few minutes, listening for the snake's movements but when none came, the little mouse took a chance. It scurried as fast as it could out of the opening and into the living room. It was heading towards a second, secret opening in the fireplace that the mouse knew would mean home-free.
Just when she thought her heart could take the wait no longer—a small tornado appeared in the center of the room. And from that small cyclone appeared Ariel, Bellatrix and, to her heart-pounding wonder, Lucius.
"You two suck," Hermione said with a pout, stuffing her wand back with mild disappointment.
Lunch came and it was terrible (Ariel used way too many onions and he forgot how much he detested trout) but Draco scarfed every bit of it down underneath the Dark Lord's watchful eye.
“What do you mean if I still want to? You’re the one that got the unfortunate luck of starting an affair with Lord Voldemort’s adopted mother.” Ariel argued, self-deprecatingly. She gave him an appraising side glance and remarked, “A saner man would run while he had the chance.”
"Your students call you Uncle Sev?" She asked with amusement.
Voldemort touched his hand to his clavicle, charmed. He had a look on his face like she had given him the highest compliment he had ever received in his life. "That means a lot coming from you."
"I'm glad we did this. Honestly."
But then he blinked and he gave her the oddest, closed-lipped grin. "Oh," His voice rumbled with mock scandalization. "Gross."
Her voice was snuffed out like a candle flame. She stood stricken, mouth hanging open uselessly, underneath Voldemort's rueful smile. He laughed in her face. "Catfish got your tongue?"
"You know why we met ma?" Voldemort told her in a cold unfeeling voice that Snape and the rest of his followers most associated with him. He leaned forward and said, "Remember those two kids from the orphanage? The ones who came into the cave with me? I lead them in there. I was going to kill them. I planned on bashing their heads in. That's why we met. Not because you were kind but because I was what I am now—I am a god of death. And soon, no one will be able to stop me."
Ariel held the treasures to her chest and wept not out of guilt or shame or regret but out of love. Love for the boy in the cave nobody loved. Love for the young man in the cave who had to destroy himself to prove his self-worth. Love for the evil wizard who surprised her, time and time again, with his capacity to love.
"Yeah, I'm great." Ariel replied sarcastically as she lifted herself up from her couchant position. She turned and shot a piercing look at the elderly wizard as she added, "Tried being nice to a kid in a cave and look what happens? The kid grows up and commits mass fucking genocide."
"Sick of me already?" She said with a teasing smile.
He made the plan the moment he saw the cave. He was going to lure Dennis and Amanda into the cave and he was going to see what the insides of their skulls looked like. Convincing them to sneak away was easy. For some reason, the other kids always listened to him even if it was obvious, they were terrified of him. He couldn't explain it himself. He had such a small, childish voice, it grated against his own ears, but he knew what to say to get people to like him. To do what he wanted.
He climbed over a set of rocks and leaned forward to discover, just beyond the rocks laid a cove were in the cove beheld an assortment of wonders: Books, paintings, tea kettles, jewels, gold chalices, pots, pans, utensils, great treasures mixed with everyday items like a ramshackle museum.
She laughed a little but then she got visibly sad as her thoughts inevitably drifted to her mother, who she never knew and only knew through the stories she heard, for Athena died when she was very young, and, who she realized then and there for the first time with heart-shattering horror, she'll have outlived for nearly two centuries, more years than her mother ever lived.
Snape let out a breathy, slightly embarrassed but deeply flattered laugh. He felt his infatuation for her double in that instant. "Tomorrow? After six? We can get dinner at the Bearded Unicorn."
“I am,” she confessed. She lifted her head and said, “Severus told me what you…wanted to ask me.”
"Can you fuck off?" Draco snapped.
"These are what muggles use to clean with," Voldemort informed gleefully. "And you, little Draco, are going to use them to clean your godfather's house. From top to bottom."
“If you still wanted to,” Snape said from the other side of the bed as he tied his shoe.
She had no idea that this creature's name was Lord Voldemort or that they were in the basement of one of his followers or that the name of the woman who delivered her to him was Bellatrix Lestrange. However, she did see the delirious glint in the snake-face man's eye and notice how he reeked of blood.
"Is something wrong?" He asked, his voice soft with concern.
That whisper—her lips—the look in her eyes. He flung himself into her and buried his mouth into her while they tore at each other's clothes. He unknotted his own cloak while she unhooked his belt and unzipped his erection free, which hovered straight out. Hard as diamond and as long as a loaf of bread.
Slowly, they rubbed at each other, squirming with delight at other's touch. Their mouths hung open like draw bridges as their breathing went ragged from enflamed desire. It was wonderfully naughty, trying to keep their passions low as they fondled another underneath this grimy booth. There was no one in the bar catch them. The bartender was out on a smoke break and Ruth was napping in a pile of hay. And for a few glorious minutes, they were no longer Harry Potter the boy who lived or Draco Malfoy the boy without options. They were simply two horny teenagers shuddering and gasping, and stealing kisses, in a smelly, dimly lit old wizard's bar.
"Can you incapacitate him all day the next time you meet?" Snape asked one day in June.
"Good."
"No shit," Ariel replied, barely listening for a nauseating numbness had begun to erode her insides.
Voldemort's face twitched into a shadow of a smile. To her immense relief, he got from the floor, stood up, and turned partway towards the door. "Thank you, Narcissa." He turned to leave when he stopped halfway and told her, "Once again, if you tell anybody—"
"Last time I got it appraised they told me it is priceless but you could easily sell it to the Museum of Magical History and get two hundred million for it."
Snape knelt there in silence barely able to conceal his shock. "You're a princess?"
"One of my students." Snape replied. When he buckled his belt, he took his wand out and performed a silencing spell over the room to spare himself from his godson's nosy tendencies.
With that, he reached forward, tapped Ariel on the hand, and said, his voice soaked with sincerity, "I can't thank you enough for what you've done for me." Then he paused and she noticed a realization cross over his eyes. "Hm. I just realized…I think you were the first person to actually give a shit about me. Hm." Then he let out a dismissive laugh as he took another sip of tea.
He sad, looking over at the oblivious headmaster when he said the final sentence. Severus quickly got the hint and nodded. He only had a small portion left anyways. He suppressed his laugh when Draco raced off to catch up to his friends.
"I don't see why not, I suppose we could go after dinner since I'll be going with."
"Y-Yes Mr. Salazar, t-thank you!"
"T-Thank you Draco, and everyone. No one has offered to help before, it means a lot."
Draco said, his voice felt like silk touching Harry's ears. He looked up nervously, his eyes widened slighted seeing Draco's passionate look.
"Excuse me?"
Pansy said, a curious look in her eyes.
"I am a founder, I may go wherever I please. I have the right to have any student(s) I wish re-evaluated by the sorting hat. Am I clear, Albus?"
He repeated quietly, his brain slipped out of reality as soon as his episode had started. Draco cooed at him and rubbed his cheek against the smaller boy's head, trying to ground him. The rest just watched in horror as a furious Snape walked out with a very angry werewolf snapping at the Gryffindors. It was only then that they noticed he had left. Snape had a look of realization when he saw Draco's blown pupils and protective grip on the obviously crying boy. He slowly walked up to the Veela, letting him see who he was and relax before he ushered the silver trio into his office. He would deal with the responsible Gryffindor in a moment. He chuckled as he watched the Veela unconsciously push his friends onto the couch as he cooed at the shaken up Pansy and crying boy. He smiled when he saw Blaise run up to them and rubbed against all of them comfortingly before sitting on the floor in front of them protectively. It seemed all of their instincts were in full force minus Pansy and Potter.
He said boldly. Glaring directly at the Headmaster, daring him to say something against his wishes. Smirking at the poorly hidden turmoil on the mama face.
Severus said, before handing the bone-mending potion to him. The boy drank it, not having a reaction to his bone reconnecting, which was concerning. He then shrank the boy's clothes to fit him, showing how wiry his frame truly was. The trio and Professor winced at the sight. The boy noticed and looked away from Draco, who was still standing in front of him. Blaise and Pansy saw and hugged the boy from both sides, chuckling lightly when his face flushed red.
