He felt as though the world was clicking back into place, as though it was getting a little easier to breathe.
It was dark and cold when Harry popped back into existence, and the air was damp and thick with salt. There was a cover of thin, scraggly trees, and Harry quickly realised he’d been lucky not to end up in one of them, or ankle deep in the marshland that lay just beyond. As it was, both feet were planted firmly on the boardwalk, and there was a building, barely more than a shack, just beyond the trees and outlined by a waxing moon. He held the bird to his chest and reach for his wand to cast a Lumos.
Of course I chose the attic. I’ve wanted nothing more than to wake up there again, with him at my side.
His shirt is wet in your fist. Damp and cool, the cloth is thin and it’s in your hand and you can pull or you can shove and it’s the same as it was, it’s there, he’s there and he’s
“You have the date of and notes from every medical appointment, every treatment plan we considered, the names of his doctors, surgical records, multiple accounts of the beginning and progression of the problem—”
Then there’s the drawing room. He thinks it’s turned out pretty well. He’s had everything refinished, so it’s just as formal but a little lighter. A lot lighter. Warmer, he likes to think.
“I’m at Malfoy’s, and I found this drawing of—they’re crime scene drawings, from the case, but Malfoy wasn’t at the scene, and—”
“You aren’t!” Draco exploded out of his seat. “Do you hear yourself? You aren’t. You haven’t done anything wrong. The Unspeakables got overconfident about a highly experimental procedure that they never should’ve done in the first place.”
Suddenly, Malfoy looked more tired than anything, and when he told Harry it was time to go, Harry went.
“Aside from antiquing and, I don’t know, crocheting doilies and feeding street urchins, what do you and your boyfriends generally do?”
That seemed to throw him, the thought that I might be nervous, too. It wasn’t a question of physical capacity, or any worry that he might have injured me, as he later confessed to having suspected. Just a bit of anxiety at the thought of it. The possibility that, after all of this, he might somehow find this part of things to be lacking.
Draco took a deep breath. For all the one-night stands, the short-lived relationships, the friends with benefits, the boyfriend here or there, he’d never had to say it. He had said versions of it. Plenty of times, in plenty of ways. But not this. This way, that wasn’t, “I want your tight arse,” or, “I want you on your knees,” or the words, unqualified, but slurred drunkenly against the coarse brick of an alley wall. It was neither a command nor a request, but a statement of fact, and one that would leave him feeling far more naked than any of the others had.
“We couldn’t be seen together,” Potter rambles on, “the damage to your family would be too great, the public accusations, it would be best for me not to get in touch, all the best for my future endeavours.”
“They’re looking for kids?” On the one hand, a brilliant diversion. On the other, best not to look too pleased at the prospect of falsely accused teenagers in Potter’s vicinity.
If he agreed, the Head Auror would tell the wizarding press that they owed their safety and peace of mind to his sacrifice. He could be known, again, in all the right ways. No longer relegated to an open-plan office in the far reaches of the Department of Mysteries. The spotlight would warm his face, as it once had, and so would the praise of grateful witches and wizards across Britain. He would be their saviour, for once. The power he’d been promised, the access… Circe. It was everything he’d been working for, hoping for when he fought so hard to get his lowly underassistantship. It was everything he thought he would have to spend decades more trying to attain.
Ron missed the silent exchange entirely, and plowed ahead. “Should say not. It’s a full house, right ‘Mione?”
“I’m very glad to hear it.” Silence threatened to reign again and Draco pressed forward, grabbing the first topic that came to hand. “And have you been able to talk more about the other things you mentioned?”
Pansy reached out to give Greg’s arm a reassuring rub. She offered Draco a sympathetic look before she spoke, and her voice was carefully kind, but she didn’t offer any more quarter than Greg had. “I don’t like it any more than you do. But they were.”
He’d never imagined—given a thousand years, given the infinite time of a philosopher’s stone—that he’d see Potter like this. He wasn’t even sure it had ever occurred to him, truly occurred to him, that Potter really did sleep, that he wasn’t in constant heroic motion at all hours of the day, rescuing Kneazles from trees while the wizarding world slumbered peacefully under his watch, and then (he might have thought, in his younger days) calling the
When he entered the conservatory he was met with a sight that did, at last, succeed at knocking thoughts of Harry out of the forefront of his mind: Greg, on the floor, doing press-ups with a litter of half-Kneazle kittens on his back. Harry, grinning ear to ear, was counting for him.
“I’m less certain of that,” Draco answered. “Probably not straightaway. And actually, Pans, maybe I’ve spoken too soon. Having the option of the void might continue to be advisable.”
Draco is on the verge of agreeing when Harry leans up and grabs his face, turning him so they’re eye to eye.
“Mm.” Draco decided against pointing out that she had, in fact, seemed to mind. “And you no longer think that what he says is what’s in his best interest?”
Without moving his hands, Harry looked over. Scepticism was written all over his face. “Really? Was there any ambiguity?”
“You did say you didn’t mind people knowing,” Draco huffs, a sudden edge of defensiveness creeping into his voice.
Harry licked his bottom lip and nodded. He kept his eyes pinned to Draco’s as he leaned forward and lowered his head.
His own drink still in hand, Harry is completely unsure of what to do with himself. There’s an armchair on the other side of Draco that’s closest to him, but then they’re not sitting next to each other, which Harry would like them to be. But he doesn't want to crowd Draco, so he'd take the other end of the settee and sitting that far away from each other on the same piece of furniture is ridiculous.
“It’s all charmed.” Potter’s tone was defensive. A good thing, in Draco’s book. Men on the defensive gave in easily.
"No," Malfoy answered, his voice thick with stubbornness. Harry was certain he was lying, but wasn't going to argue the point. "Don't want to give you too much of a good thing," Malfoy went on.
“Fair enough.” She sounded convinced but kept watching him. “I suppose. But to give up his case would leave him even worse off.”
Harry could make out a green wax seal at the edge of it and channelled every last remaining bit of calm he could muster into not running to take it from her. “Yeah? Let’s have it, then.”
Potter’s eyebrows shot up so abruptly Draco half-imagined them launching themselves onto the ceiling and sticking there.
Next to him, Potter began a languid stretch. From the corner of his eye, he retraced his path—Potter’s neck, his nipples, the line trailing down his stomach.
If Harry’s clichéd sense of humour is getting to me already, I don’t know what I’ll do. Except go down for breakfast, I suppose, and be glad he’ll let me kiss him over his morning tea.
“But none of that is possible without your support, and that’s what brings us here tonight. There are envelopes on your tables, which I or Hermione Granger, our Director of Operations, will be
Draco found himself feeling a certain nostalgia for the days when Potter would have gone for a good old-fashioned punch to the jaw. It would’ve hurt less.
I remember his silent entreaties to turn over. How he slowed once I did. He traced my back with such excruciatingly attentive care I might have screamed if I could’ve mustered the will to move beyond my most automatic reactions. I know now that he used every colour he could reach, that my back is an advertisement for rainbows and house unity, save the long, blank strip he reserved for his tongue.
Potter’s skills weren’t always matched with virtues, particularly where patience was concerned. Perhaps Draco shouldn’t have been as surprised as he was to feel the wet warmth of Potter’s mouth take him in all at once. Perhaps he’d never be able to stop being surprised by it. Maybe it didn’t matter. Potter was all tongue and lips and the perfect hint of teeth and, even better, naked enthusiasm for the task at hand. He sucked Draco down like he was starving for it, and his mouth was wet and sloppy and loud, and he moaned beautifully, as though he was—as though it was remotely possible for him to be—enjoying this half as much as Draco was.
Potter makes a noise in the back of his throat as though he can’t decide what he wants to say. He clearly wants to keep apologising, but even Harry “denser than a Spanish oak cupboard door” Potter must realise that Draco is not interested. He sighs. “Yeah. There should be a couple of them.”
He said, bold as brass – but he always has been, I shouldn’t be surprised – “Yeah right, Malfoy. Muggles or not, there’s no way you loved doing chores on a Sunday.”
“Okay.” Potter sets the knife back on the shelf, its label dangling over the edge. “I shouldn’t have said what I did. About it being easy. Just, people have said that to me a lot, you know, ‘move on, do something else,’ and I didn’t think you would, you know, with everything – I was just surprised that you’d say that. But I didn’t say what I said because I think it’s easy or that this is easy for you, being here. Except it seems like you’re good at it, like you maybe even like it, you know, being in charge and being the only one who can sort out people’s stuff, so I thought, when you said that, that maybe it is easy for you, that maybe you’d moved on like everybody else has and I just…I made a few assumptions and I’m sorry.”
He shifts again, sliding down the sheets, ignoring his robes bunching around him, to lie flat between Harry’s thighs.
“I thought—” Draco said. It was an instinct to cut Potter off, but it didn’t feel like it had before. It didn’t feel like he didn’t want to hear Potter speak. It was more that he didn’t want him to say anything that would…he wasn’t sure. Didn’t want to argue, maybe. Didn’t want to see Potter slide further into misery. “I thought you were going to sleep.”
He crossed the Pont Royal, skirted the Jardin des Tuileries, and ducked under the covered pavement across the street. He walked past arch after identical arch, so focused on what might happen once he arrived that he almost missed his destination. He supposed he could consider it an advantage of Muggle porters over elves; they were tall enough to notice while distracted.
“In short, Potter has the most powerful wand in the world implanted next to a conduit he’s not trained to use. It’s the power of the Elder Wand and Potter’s own ability crossed with the magical control of an untrained child. Under those circumstances it acts less like a wand than an amplifier. A Sonorous for his magic, if you will. Add in the Wand’s destructive tendencies and I do believe we have an answer.”
“Percy Weasley, that is absolute rubbish! ” Her face was almost the colour of the Hogwarts Express and she looked so close to exploding that Draco began to wonder if he was about to see more accidental magic. “You know as well as anyone that we owe Harry more than we could ever,
Walking behind Harry had the odd effect of obscuring the intent behind people's stares. He couldn't tell at first if people were gawking at him or at Harry. Or, for that matter, Harry Potter the war hero or Harry Potter who looked like he could take out half of Hogsmeade with a glance. But as they moved through the atrium, he became fairly certain when the stares came into focus, recognised the colour of his hair and the sharp line of his jaw as Malfoy and turned into sneers and threats… those were for him alone. He wished he could revert to his wartime autopilot, but it had been too long. He was too used to meeting stranger's eyes in greeting, even though there wasn't any sign of welcome in the ones he saw now. The few that didn't seem to notice who he was provided some relief, but those few who gave him smiles—dripping with obsequious, vulgar greed—were worst of all. He'd rather be cut openly than drooled over, and the whispers in the lift were nothing to the presumptuously knowing smirk Marcus Flint gave Draco as he came down the corridor outside the courtroom to hear his older brother speak.
I asked her which winnings she meant. She clarified – Potter had slunk back in to the common room late last night looking miserable and gone straight to his room, and he’d left first thing this morning. So it was obvious what had happened.
Potter’s good behaviour won’t lure him in to that trap. They forge onwards. He thinks Potter must be feeling it too when a butter dish shaped like, and possibly made of, a human femur goes unremarked upon. But perhaps it’s the weather, or the day of the week, and a quiet Potter is the best he can hope for.
He doesn’t expect the sweetness of Potter’s saliva, or the plumpness of his lips. Doesn’t expect to feel the heat of it radiate through his chest. Doesn’t expect Potter to be the kind of kisser who moves with it, who rolls his hips and arches his back in time with the pressure of his lips. Doesn’t expect the firm pressure of Potter’s fingertips at his neck and on his arm, or the insistent tugging at his collar, or the way Potter bucks his hips to throw Draco off guard, to make sure Draco falls into him so that their bodies are pressed together. He doesn’t expect to mirror Potter’s gasps and moans.
Reluctantly, Potter turned back to Finnigan and asked about the case in question. Draco didn’t miss him looking back to the spot every so often. Or, with increasing frequency, scanning the crowd until he met Draco’s eye.
“In the late 1970s?” Harry tangles his fingers in the laces, searching under the tongue to find a size. They’re a ten.
They’ve got off together recently enough, but it’s still been a decade since Draco’s seen Harry, really seen any of him. Or since Harry’s seen anything other than his cock and thighs. A cloakroom blowjob isn’t the same as undressing for one’s former lover.
Draco leaned forward, bracing his hand above Potter’s on the glass. His other hand came to his cock. “And fuck you.”
“Absolutely not,” Draco interrupts. He’s often furious with his staff, but the impertinence of this particular request is on another, blood-rushing, pulse-pounding level still. “Out of the question.”
Draco sneers. “Well enough not to let them in here.” It’s all coming back like second nature. “Well enough to be perfectly aware of what happened to the last Ministry department they tried to search.”
“Oh.” Harry’s shoulders relaxed. Draco hadn’t even realised he’d been holding them together. “I’d still like to… Well. It’s—there are two things, and I’m not sure if, together, they make things more or less complicated. But I’d like to say both, if that’s all right.”
“Fine then.” With a flick of his wand, Draco pulled the paperwork into a tidy pile. He tapped his wand against the edge of the table. Three place settings and a heaping plate of breakfast pastries appeared. “Granger, can we trust you with the cutlery?”
Fortunately, they’re all deluded enough to believe going back to Hogwarts will have the desired effects. Reintegration, adjustment to post-war society, blah, blah, blah. It’s so much Hippogriff shit, of course.
“We? Who is this ‘we’ you’re always talking about? It’s you, Draco. You do this. You do all of this, and it’s brilliant.” He reaches for Draco’s jaw.
And it was a sense he just couldn’t shake. He was grateful that his friends were there, that they’d given up their Fridays to keep him company while he was stuck on an unwanted assignment, but even their presence couldn’t entirely assuage his sense that Malfoy was up to something. It ate at him, buzzing under his skin, making his usual restlessness all the more pressing. It wasn’t any one thing, but all of them combined. And as combinations of factors went, he couldn’t help feeling—as Malfoy swanned about the room, drinking wine and laughing—like his ire was unusually well-justified.
The air rushed out of Harry’s chest in an instant. He was speechless. He shook his head and tried to lift a shoulder.
He’s torn between disappointment and desire when I take his cock in my mouth. It’s the perfect excuse to drop a hand to the base of his shaft, then lower, cupping his balls, rolling them in my palm as I suck him down.
—” Harry wiggled his arse backwards, still trying to direct Malfoy’s half-buried hand, “—of your master?” The snake on the box had stopped moving. “Mister snake, I seek your contents.”
His mouth is hot against Harry’s neck, the suction bruising, and this mark is one Harry wants to keep – no Glamours, no concealment of any sort. He tilts his head, giving Draco better access, but Draco has moved on to his jaw and then his lips, nipping at them, pressing into them, kissing him so thoroughly that Harry is left gasping and boneless against the quilt.
“Magical spoonbills are exceedingly rare. The whole species is on the verge of extinction and to find a successfully fledged adult, let alone a magical one, is of extraordinary import. You see, their feathers can be used—”
“Yeah.” Harry pulls up to his full height, trying to match Draco’s perfect posture, to look him properly in the eye.
“Well,” Harry drew out the syllables, imitating Malfoy’s drawl, “if it’s to save the world, I suppose I’ll have to make do."
“Now, Blaise, you’re her agent. Surely it would be useful to know what the readers like. Especially such important ones”
,” with a wink saucy enough to almost convince Harry that he meant it — and then take him to the nearest alley, and press him up against the wall, and kiss him while the squeeze of Apparition pulled them together.
A cluster of clouds pass overhead, and after the heat of these last few weeks Harry almost feels cold. He thinks Draco must too; he presses closer to Harry and lets out a little shiver.
He tears his gaze away from Potter’s. Clears his throat. “I’m sorry to hear that.” He turns to the shelf and picks up the next knife. “One bread knife, full tang –”
Fair enough. But the Ministry types weren’t meant, and hadn’t wanted, to be seen. He sighed. “The music room, you said?”
Harry can feel the heat creep into his cheeks. His skin burns with the embarrassment of it, and he wishes, suddenly, that Draco had come up with a time turner instead of a cloak.
The front office is empty. His stomach flips. Draco’s not there. He’d started to be, most of the time, like he was waiting for Harry. Not that he
Behind Harry, Malfoy was starting to chant as he fucked Harry. “Fuck, Potter, yeah, you want it, open up for me, let me fuck you.”
Draco’s stomach plummeted. His heart froze. Hope rose along his spine. There were too many contradictory feelings for him to have any chance of understanding them, let alone saying them.
Draco catches his eye and holds it then. It’s a look full of provocation. Harry’s certain, all of a sudden, that if he takes that step forward, Draco will follow through on what he’s saying. Not saying. Whatever. That they’ll kiss, that he’ll be pinned under the weight of Draco’s body, gasping and moaning and opening himself for Draco’s tongue, that it will be sleepless nights and wet dreams and confusion. His stomach twists.
“Ron’s coming? Here?” Potter interrupted, looking hopeful, and as though he could no longer hold the words in.
“I.” Draco pauses. He does. Or, did. But this room, devoid of Harry…that’s not what it had been about.
“Given the particulars of my job, it got a bit hard to ensure he never heard anything.” She grinned. “So we reached a compromise, involving very large, very unfortunately placed boils, should he ever repeat anything.”
Of course, it’s happened before. Panicked home gardeners who assume their produce will still be in perfect condition two weeks after Vanishing. Amateur chefs who can’t believe their spouse accidentally Vanished those leftovers. Tearful lovers who Vanish flowers in the heat of an argument.
“Bloody bird.” Draco grabs it round the middle and yanks it inside, wrestling with surprisingly strong wings in the process.
Potter shakes his head, hair falling forward to hide his eyes. Draco pushes it back. Hiding is not the sort of thing he’ll allow.
Two of the owls have started sharing a nest. Looked like a new addition to the Owlery at first, huddled so closely their feathers are indistinguishable.
“Anyway. The stories stopped,” he continued, “and I saw that there was mercy where I’d expected violence. If you weren’t what I’d been taught, what else had I been wrong about?
“Auror Potter, we must impress the seriousness of these proceedings upon you. You have been one of the primary investigators at several of the crime scenes related to this case. In your opinion, is it possible that the accused has committed the murders in question?”
It was well into the wee hours by the time Harry got home. Far too late to Floo anyone, and he had work in the morning besides.
Malfoy pulls him up by his hair. His nascent whine doesn't makes it past his lips when he sees what he’s done. The trail of red rings that mark Malfoy’s skin. Evidence, incontrovertible, that Harry's been there.
“‘Pass the cream, please.’” She rolled her eyes at his expression. “And very little other than that, about you or anything else.”
Potter’s face is flushed and his eyes are red. His hair’s pulled up in even more directions than usual and his jumper’s pulled to one side so his collarbone’s poking out. Draco looks away. It’s a far better alternative than staring, which is proving a hard urge to resist. He’s not used to seeing Potter look so – well, not rumpled. He’s used to that, and Potter doesn’t look any more dishevelled than usual. But he looks anxious. He looks smaller. He looks vulnerable, all pale neck and bowed head.
“This information came to light in part because Potter reacted especially strongly in a moment when he happened to see me interacting sexually with another man, and has also had strong reactions in moments when he and I are touching.” Granger’s eyes widened comically. “In a professional capacity,” Draco corrected. “Or, last night, when he went to deck me and grabbed my robes.”
Again. He jumps, trains his sight on a nearby fence, and tries to steer himself towards it. He ends up doubled over a rail. At least, being alone, he doesn’t have to conceal his pained groan.
This, this nameless thing, was what he’d been looking for. He hadn’t known it. Had never expected to find it here. But something had fallen away, had fallen off his shoulders, over the hours they’d passed together. Some weight he’d been carrying around. Something like a shadow of the bitterness Malfoy had been so quick to name. Something about Malfoy himself had loosened something in Harry’s chest. The monster that had so often raged there, fed by suspicion and injustice, was quelled by it. By…forgiveness, Harry supposed it was. By letting go. By Malfoy showing him that he could perhaps, in this way, in this instance, let go.
Harry wiped his palms on the knees of his jeans. “It’s not very polite, and I really did only mean to ask about your meeting. Not to drink your Scotch and unburden my… whatever.” He made to stand.
His stomach flipped when the doors slid open. It was perfectly normal, he reminded himself, to be on guard going into a negotiation. The adrenaline was an asset.
He had the distinct suspicion that Potter would start talking if he didn’t, and that nothing good could come of it.
His mouth watered, and he dropped to flick his tongue over one. Harry’s attempts to undo his buttons became clumsier as he laved it, and stopped altogether when he sucked it into his mouth. “Fuck,” Harry muttered, breath shallow and quick. He pushed Draco back and kissed him hard as he moved them back towards the bed, one step, then another, until Draco’s calves were pinned to the bed frame.
I asked if he was sure, if he wouldn’t rather it the other way round. He shook his head, said no, but yes, he was sure.
She laughed. “A small army of elves with multiple high-quality fabrics to choose from? You’d be a force to reckon with. More than you already are.”
Once upright, his head spun. He tried to focus on pulling his cuffs straight and raking his hair into place before he stepped out from behind the tree.
He cleared his throat and rolled his eyes at it. “My schedule is booked today and I am overseeing a surgery on Wednesday. Is the Minister available Thursday at half noon?”
“That’s not exactly the ritual Granger and I had researched. The sign bit, yes, but having you there, not having the plans in advance…”
“For fuck’s sake.” Draco closed the distance between them, grabbed Potter by the collar, and pulled him into a kiss. He felt as much as he heard the start, and almost immediate end, of a muffled objection. Potter’s mouth was warm against his, but Potter was stiff with surprise, his lips unyielding. Draco stepped back, half prepared to send him packing. He’d specified that Potter would be an active participant. If he’d just wanted to get off, he was blessed with two good hands. Or a high cash withdrawal limit and the cards for several fetching rent boys, if needs must.
He sighs and turns to Harry. “The shape of the toe cap and the height of the collar suggest that these are from the late 1970s. The double tongues are technically a safety mechanism but it was fashionable among a certain set to wear one up and one down. The stitching marks them as having come from Belby’s Boots.”
Still, he stands there and espouses the idea as though he actually thinks he stands a chance of convincing me, as though if he opens his eyes just a bit wider and leans in just a bit closer, the sheer force of his own desire to believe will prove catching.
He starts by bending forward. Touching his toes. Feels the stretch in his hamstrings, but he doesn’t go tumbling. Tries pulling his knees towards his chest. They go easily, and stay there until he lowers them again.
None of the toilets were made to act as back-up transport. Harry didn’t know why. Probably Malfoy was too stuck-up to be willing to entertain the thought in his hoity-toity gallery.
“Think. Where would you go if you needed something? Anything, anything you could think of – where would you go that could produce anything you wanted?”
“Well.” Malfoy paused for a moment, and Harry felt a hint of nagging guilt. Mutually agreed-upon benefits aside, Harry had begun to think of his relationship with Malfoy as something verging on friendship. Friendly acquaintanceship, maybe? And he felt as though he shouldn’t leave Malfoy to pick up quite as many awkward silences as he inevitably did, even if Malfoy was adept at the kind of small talk that left Harry feeling like a troll in a china shop.
He gathered everything he could find on magical education and wandlore, and almost lost himself in reading. Then, every time he heard the clock tick, he’d find himself distracted again. He hadn’t felt so unfocused since his first days at university, wondering if he’d ever be able to figure out Muggle science. Or even since Binns’ lectures during his last, horrible year at Hogwarts.
“Yes,” Draco said in his driest voice. “I’ve just reminded you that you have the ability to refuse to consent to medical procedures so that I can make you do whatever I want.” He didn’t try to hide his eyeroll. “Because I think I’m so clever, probably.”
“I’d like you to have a drink with me outside of the workplace. I’d like – I’m trying to ask you out. On a date.”
When the clock chimed one, Draco almost jumped out of his seat. He’d managed to stay in it through sheer force of will at first, and then by letting his mind wander, and then he’d considered, though disregarded, some of the more dubious spells that members of his doctoral cohort had used at exam times. But he’d never entirely settled in, and he was eager to get to the conservatory. To see Harry, if he was honest with himself.
Draco is impassive. Too impassive for it to be unintentional. The more Harry looks at him, the more he wants to see something, anything, else. “It’s my stuff and I want to help. I want to be here, I want to – I want to help. I insist.”
This will be a hard shove to the wall and brick at your back and a tug at your wrist. This is going to be your hand pressed to his groin. This is going to be the heat of his cock and the cold at your back, your spine tensed and arched towards him like it wants him and fuck what you think. You’re not here to think.
“Your shoes. They’re covered in mud and leaves. You’ll leave tracks all over the department and I don’t fancy cleaning them up. Shoes off.”
Draco knew his younger self would’ve hated that it came out as a question. His older self didn’t care as long as it was answered.
Draco ignored them all, poured himself a cup of tea, and sat at the head of the table. “I see we’re all off to a good morning, then.”
He’d bought pieces of canvas in the Muggle world and insisted we lay them out and surround ourselves with every colour we had to hand. He wanted something grand, unmissable. That Harry can’t draw worth two sickles was a minor complication, made major by his absolute inability to sit still. We agreed that he could trace; my lines first, in charcoal, quick and sketchy, his slower and more lasting.
“Master Draco.” He bowed, panting. “Mistress Pansy, we is still working, but we has elf magic, we is fixing everything now.”
It was half past three on a Wednesday and Harry was failing in every attempt to lose himself in paperwork when Padma knocked on his doorframe. “Oi, Harry, looks like an owl got turned around.” She held a thin scroll in her hand.
me? Just tells me to shut up and piss off or acts like I’m not even there, when I— when I—” He let out a frustrated growl and tugged at his hair. “When everyone’s tiptoeing around it like there’s some big fucking secret and no one will even tell me
The desire for more became pressing, I think for us both. I rocked back to kneel above him. The desire in his eyes was unmistakable. There was so much he had never felt. So much I wanted him to feel, wanted to give him.
It was just that nothing else would satisfy. London felt claustrophobic and dirty. The Burrow was too full of people who looked at him with concern. He’d tried the Lake District, but it was too quiet, and Brighton, which felt all wrong with pebbles underfoot instead of sand. And he couldn’t stay in the house. Not when, even after he had someone out to inspect the foundations, he woke up more often than not to visions of it falling in on him.
It’s one thing to want this – which he doesn’t – and to think about wanting this at home, alone, in the middle of the night. It’s another thing to take this step. It’s too much of a thing. It’s not the kind of person he is. The kind of person he is stays over here. The kind of person he is leaves. The kind of person he is is about to vomit on Draco’s pristine robes.
Thinks back to the day he’d done it. Lying naked in Harry’s bed two autumns after the war, with Harry running his fingers through the fine hair on Draco’s chest and talking about next summer, next year, shopping in Diagon come Christmas, trips to places Draco had always wanted to see. And his father’s voice—and his mother’s, and his own, with all those little misgivings that hung on like a horde of angry Pixies—still overtook Harry’s. And then Harry had looked up at him, eyes wide, and said, “I love you, you know.” Draco had pulled Harry to his chest and hoped Harry couldn’t hear his heart icing over. He waited there, an hour, maybe, his hands carding Harry’s hair as he tried to find the words, but when Harry's breath slowed and they didn’t come he left—slipped out of Harry’s bed and into his trousers and carried his shoes as he snuck down to the Floo, and never opened any of the notes that arrived every day for a month after.
“All feedback on the performance of The Vanishing Department should be directed to the Wizengamot.” Draco steps aside. “The next item is a teak writing desk, mid-twentieth century. This design is influenced by Muggle trends, making it an unlikely candidate unless it’s a recent acquisition.”
“It’s done now.” Potter stood too, though without any of Draco’s urgency. “If I’m the most dangerous thing to them now… If this will protect them, then that’s what I’ll do.”
“As for why he fell when he did, it’s either the case that he was drawn to your magic or that it was pure chance.” She shrugged. “Either way, it’s good you found him and good you called. Draco’s surgery was a success.”
He turns his attention to his jeans. Maybe he can cuff them? Or roll the waistband to get them off the floor? Or a quick severing spell to the hem, if he can stand still long enough? But then Malfoy will definitely see the hole in the heel of his left sock, which he would’ve taken care of if he’d known he’d be walking around shoeless.
“100 miles?” Harry tries to estimate their proximity to Malfoy Manor. Wishes he’d paid better attention in…well, primary school, so the knowledge would probably be lost by now anyway.
“Yeah,” Ron said. “And then it just sort of… stopped. You went to Amsterdam all of a sudden. We couldn’t figure out if he went with you, if you went together, because we didn’t see him at any of the usual spots. You were gone, think it was a month? When you got back, that was it. Neither of us saw him again until ‘Mione ran into him through work.”
But Bailey had stood there, waiting and watching, until Draco pulled the mug forward and took a small sip.
Draco ran his hands through the water and watched the ripples from his movement eat up the bubbles. They sat and Harry watched him until all the bubbles were nearly gone and the bathwater was lukewarm.
"Right, of course," Wilson said. He rubbed a hand over his robes. "Is it overstepping to ask what it is?"
It didn’t take long for Harry to get to the real reason he’d sought Draco out. “Look, Draco, I’m so sorry aboutー”
Draco rolled his eyes, but he was smiling and holding onto Harry’s hands so tightly he was starting to lose circulation, so he took that as a good sign.
Harry squeezed Draco's hip and then turned to Mrs. Weasley with a broad grin. "Hullo, Mrs. Weasley. You look lovely tonight."
"Wait." Draco held up a hand. "I'm not done." Draco let his hand fall back into the water, and it splashed dissipated soap up into Harry's face. "I apologize. I am, unfortunately, too selfish to let you go now." He looked at Harry, who was staring at him with red eyes and his mouth fallen open. "I want you to be with me when I go. I love you so much, and一Well. I want someone to hold my hand when it ends. I'm sorry."
For November in London, it was a fairly nice morning. Gray skies, no wind, a dusting of rain. Chilly enough for a cloak, but not cold enough for the fur lined one that Harry had bought for him last December. Draco smiled at the homeless man on the corner, handed him a biscuit from his lunch box (made by Harry, of course. Draco never knew what to pack for lunch). He went on his way, took the phone booth down to the Ministry, and smiled at the woman at the guest counter who looked as if three separate finches had flown through her hair. By the time he reached the elevator to take him down to the Department of Mysteries, there was a pounding behind his skull.
Harry knows it. He laughs because every second of Draco’s life has been spent talking. His mouth goes on, his hands swirl in emphasis, the words never cease. Draco is self conscious about it, even though he can’t stop. Harry adores it, listening to Draco with his hand settled over Draco’s knee and no obligation to do anything but listen.
He took the paper from Harry, crumpled it up, and threw it across the room. It landed less than two feet away from where they were sitting together on the couch. Harry, in good spirit, levitated the letter into the fire.
Harry slowed and stared at Draco, caught off guard by the way the warm glow of the candles hovering over the table reflected over Draco’s cheekbones and the bridge of his nose. Caught off guard in the way that he often was, simply by how beautiful Draco was. Draco glanced up at him and smiled, unaware of the heat opening up in Harry’s stomach.
If Harry had thought much about what his life would’ve looked like five years ago, this was not what he would’ve imagined. He would’ve imagined being alone, probably depressed, traveling the world looking for something he would never find.
to Harry, which was all he felt like he really needed to say anyways. The rest was something Draco payed attention to because it made Harry's eyes bright when Draco would sign something to him, and Harry would be able to respond, and they could feel like they were close.
"Draco," Harry said. Draco almost lifted his head at the twinge in Harry's voice, but it was so hard to do so because his neck really was too sore to make any movement. "Draco," Harry said again, blind panic clear in his voice. "You're hot. Really hot."
"It's not," Harry said. He threw a package of toilet paper at the cashier. "We need to talk about it more."
No one else knew sign language, or bothered to learn it. But, frankly, Draco didn't care much to communicate with anyone else. Harry was enough.
Draco nods desperately, his breathing still going hard, and tears streaming down his face. “I hit somebody,” he croaks.
Draco smiled up at him from where he was curled up in the armchair by the fire. He did not mention to Harry that he could no longer bend his knees further than a 45 degree angle, or that the fire looked more gray than orange. "That's wonderful, Harry. Are you happy?"
The sheets lifted abruptly off Draco's torso. Draco didn't bother scrambling after them. It felt nice, the cool air swiping over his skin. He smiled into his pillow and burrowed further down into the mattress.
Despite the heat, the lemon trove was as wonderful as the first time Draco had come. The fruits hung from the trees, and glinted cheerfully in dappled sunlight when Draco skimmed his hands over the leaves, careful to avoid the vicious thorns protruding from the branches. He pulled them off as he went, stuffing them into his pockets, and then trying to hold too many in his hands when the seams of his trousers started to pop from holding one too many lemons.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Draco said softly, angling his gaze out to the gentle waving of the lake. “I was acting silly.”
Draco nodded out to the sunshine and flowers. “Lemon trees symbolize adoration and commitment. Lemon blossoms are the symbol of discretion.”
"The next time you tell the Aurors about our Mortem case, I'm going to..." The voice faded off down into another corridor.
On the day they went to the Burrow to tell the Weasleys they were pregnant, Mrs. Weasley had opened the door and nodded sideways to Draco before hugging Harry tightly, as she always did.
Sorry it took me so incredibly long to finish writing this chapter, and thank you so much to all the people who commented on the last one! It helped me bucket loads in finding the motivation to finish this chapter <3
Harry noticed everything. If he brushed his fingers over Draco's arm to get his attention and Draco didn't notice right away, Harry would grab at his hand and hold on until Draco's fingers turned purple at the tips. If Draco touched a hot plate for a little too long, Harry would yank him away and take him away to bed to press his skin so hard onto Draco's that Draco would never be able to let it fade away.
“Yes,” Harry said, and started smiling again. He couldn’t wait to see it, gold and shiny, on Draco’s hand. “Do you?”
They are both fully, mostly, dressed. But every one of Draco’s nerves is alight where Harry’s body leans up into him, everywhere Harry grips tighter onto his hair, his arms, the folds of his clothes.
Harry rolled his eyes and grumbled something unintelligible into Draco's neck before standing up straight and unloading their groceries onto the conveyor belt. Draco smiled and rocked gently back and forth with his arms still cradled around Molly in her baby carrier.
Draco lined up the lemons one by one around his room. A line on the windowsill, a line on the dresser, a line on the tea table, a line in front of the balcony, a line around the bathtub. He had enough lemons to decorate his whole room with them if he spread them out a bit and was careful not to squish any.
Harry blinked at him for a long moment before settling a hand on Draco’s head. His fingertips rubbed idly through Draco’s hair. “I suppose so.”
"Well," Harry said, dropping a cereal box a little too hard in front of the cashier. "We still haven't decided whose name we're taking tomorrow."
Draco sits halfway up to reach Harry and wastes no time in pulling Harry’s shirt over his head and tossing it to the side. The buckle of his belt comes next, then the button of his trousers.
"Headaches, sore throat, aching joints, some numbness," Draco said. Harry dropped his head into his hands.
Scorpius shifted in Draco's arms and turned his head to the other side. Draco longed to hold him closer and stroke his hair back from his forehead, whisper to him that Daddy would be alright, he'd be able to play tomorrow. Scorpius didn't understand yet. All he could understand was that every Sunday, him and Daddy and Papa went to visit his Grandmum and Grandpa, and that Grandmum and Grandpa were not able to speak back to him when he told them about his new friends in reception.
and loped out to the front porch. As soon as he’d settled into one of the rocking chairs, it occurred to him that Harry would be able to approach him very easily from here, so he got up, and moved to the next place. The lemon trove seemed too far a trek for today, so Draco went back inside the house and up to his rooms.
He couldn't get his eyes open. All he could see was the swarming darkness of the inside of his eyes and mind. He could hear though. That was something.
Harry set the plate down on Draco's lap and settled himself on top of Draco's feet. "Feeling alright?"
But then, Harry Potter was probably just as handsome with no hair at all as he was with a full mop of it. And now Draco was thinking of Harry with a buzzed head, and the whole notion was altogether ridiculous.
“I want to trail my fingers down your stomach, and bury my face in your neck, and hold onto your hips. I want to kiss your thighs, the small of your back, the inside of your arm, the palms of your hands. I want to do those things to you, and I want you to do them to me.” Harry pauses. He’s never said anything like this, so blatant, so loud, so clear.
Draco nods, but he doesn’t take any more breaths. He’s shaking so hard, his whole body is jerking back and forth and the zipper on his jacket is clinking against his belt.
aware,” said Draco. He refrained from rolling his eyes. “It is a constant bother. Nevertheless, if you are concerned about the interns, I would advise you to speak with Sullivan, our department head, rather than me.”
Scorpius set his head back on Draco's shoulder and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck as Draco made his way to Harry. He held out the flowers for Harry to take, and stood by in silence while Harry set them down on the graves.
"What do you mean?" Harry bit at the soft skin under Draco's ear. "And then you're dead. Dead, dead, dead. I'll never see you again, or touch you again, or kiss you, or lick you, or一" Harry let out a strangled cough. "And it's been in your body for
There was no harried agitation about Draco's last day. He lay in their bed. Harry lay next to him, his body lined up beside Draco's, and very, very close.
Harry looked down, at Draco's lap. Draco looked down too. There was nothing particularly interesting. Just the coarse gray threads of the standard issue Mungo's blanket, and Draco's hand, braceleted by a charmed ring that displayed Draco's vitals.
Harry smiles. He’d felt the same way when he’d first learned of it. “Well it’s more than that. The best part about it is the connection. It is difficult to explain, even for those who have experienced it. It is a joining of skin, two souls being one, a linking of magic. It is being melded with another person, body, soul, and mind. It is having them with you, always.”
Draco looked back down at Molly and her puckered lips, her pink cheeks, the tangle of Harry's curls over her ears. "Molly Malfoy-Potter."
Harry bolted up straight and stood immediately, staring openly at the Healer. He whirled to grab Draco's hands and beg with his eyes.
Harry nodded and hesitated before taking the parchment back from Draco and writing something else down. Draco pulled it towards him.
"Bailey only has to oversee the paperwork, which means he knows about every case going in and out of the DMLE and Department of Mysteries. The two departments are so closely linked that whatever goes to the Aurors has definitely touched the Department of Mysteries, and vice versa." Draco paused. "Bailey came into my office once to ask about the Mortem case."
From there, everything had changed. Draco's mother was in a mental ward in France still. She hadn't wanted to come back to England for anything, not for the baby, nor even Draco's wedding, although the ward insisted they would allow her a brief chaperoned trip. Draco had Harry, of course, but Harry was just as new at being pregnant as Draco was, and Harry wasn't even pregnant. They were teenagers, barely in love, one of them orphaned, and the other left behind, and both of them were virtually alone in the world. Except Harry had the Weasleys. And after Mrs. Weasley found out they were going to have a baby, Draco had the Weasleys too. Mrs. Weasley, first, but all of them eventually.
When he had come to rest facing Draco, Harry leaned his face close into Draco's on the one pillow. He was so close that Draco could hardly make out the features of his eyelashes, the straight of his nose, full lips. The only thing filling Draco's vision was vivid, golden, brilliant green.
Draco smiled up at him, took a sip of his tea, stood to put his robes on, and then walked out the door.
It wasn't until Harry and him were lying in their bed, tangled over and in between the sheets, that Draco finally understood.
When Harry tapped his shoulder, hard so Draco could feel it, and signed to him that he was going out, Draco would reach out to hold his hand and squeeze tightly to say,
Draco held on and stroked his thumb across the dimples in Scorpius' knuckles. "No magic, of course."
Draco stared at Harry hard. "Harry. We've been together for ten years. I've been in love with you for almost double that amount of time. There should be no doubt that I would've told you. Of course一of
Harry laughed and Draco let himself bask in the sound, dazed and happy. Harry sat back in his chair, relaxed, his robes unbuttoned, and his shirt loosely tucked into his trousers. Molly leaned back with his movements, smiling and chewing on the hand that wasn't holding Draco's. Warm fairy lights glittered off the both of them, casting them in honey warmed gold light. The air clinked with champagne glasses and cake forks, heels and the swish of dress robes on the dance floor, the chatter of voices too loud and happy with alcohol and the giddiness of a wedding.
Oh, well. Draco decided this was as good a time as any to go down to the lemon trove. Now that Harry was back, his flowered clearing and the library were both limited hiding options, as Harry knew to find Draco there. As far as Draco knew, no one but him was aware of the lemon trove, and if they were, they didn’t know Draco had taken it up as his most recent hiding place.
With three weeks to go before Draco's expected departure, he began to wish he'd accepted Harry's proposal. Draco, of course, stood by what he'd said. And yet, he wished for a ring on his finger, and to fall asleep next to his husband.
The Healer set his hand over Draco's blanket. "Well, you know now. Very exciting. Very exciting, my boy." He turned, the bundle of blankets and baby in his arm, and finally left Draco alone.
Harry let out a loud bellowing laugh and pressed sloppy kisses into Draco's face. Draco smiled into it, tilting his head to the side a little and letting Harry nose into his hair.
. And now you're running about after some crazy case? You need to rest. And Wilson needs to rest too. His eyes are bugging out of his head. I think he only asked to use the loo so he could take a forty second nap before he has to come back and try and keep up with your brain."
“I’m curious to know what is the purpose of the spell.” She folds her hands on Harry’s desk and leans forward.
A kid who can’t be more than sixteen or seventeen, and she’s looking around with wide eyes and a trembling bottom lip. Harry doesn’t see any blood on her, but he doesn’t know if she hit her head on anything. A few of the police and paramedics break off from the group once the girl is out of the car, and come to talk to Harry.
Draco tried to smile and nod. His headache and his throat were worse, but he didn't want to say. "Much better," he said.
But then the symptoms began to come on slowly, almost without notice. First it was the numbness in his toes that Harry couldn't rub away, and then his inability to feel hunger. Losing his ability to feel his eyelashes brushing across his cheek, and then the weird pinching in his rib cage that eventually faded away.
Draco sighed and pushed himself out of the bed, careful not to shift the mattress and wake Harry. Another cry rose up and Draco reached over to grab his wand off the bedside table and cast a silencing charm around Harry so he wouldn't hear. Even with Draco's grumbled annoyance, he couldn't bring himself to shake Harry awake.
Draco kissed Harry’s shoulder. His skin was warm, so warm, and nice and smooth, and Draco wanted to cover all of it, again. “So when do you go back?”
“An excellent question,” Harry says. “An easily answered one if you do your reading.” He holds his hand out to the classroom, and she gives him one last glare before turning on her heel and taking a seat with Mildred Daney.
The food was nice, Draco supposed. It tasted faintly of salt, and nothing else. Harry pointed a wine out to him on the menu, and Draco smiled and agreed because it was, indeed, a nice wine, and it was, indeed, very nice that Harry knew which wine to pick out for Draco. But when the wine came out, Draco took a sip, felt blank liquid on his tongue, and nearly threw it all back up.
He couldn’t think about it right now. It had already ruined his pleasant mood from tea and the lemons he’d picked the day before, and now his head and stomach were aching with worry. A walk would be of some assistance.
They dressed, kissing and holding on to each other, nearly falling over with laughter. Okay, Harry kept saying over and over. Okay, okay. Draco had his hands on either side of Harry’s face, and wouldn’t let go. Harry buttoned Draco’s coat up over his stomach, still kissing and letting Draco hold onto him.
Draco pressed his fingers into his temples. It was all very exhausting to think about. All of Lucius’ letters seemed to have this effect on him. Draco folded the parchment up and tucked it back into the envelope before tossing it onto a side table.
Draco inclined his head. The ceaseless questions about pointless inquiries were a regular part of his work life. As earnest and level-headed Wilson was about his job, he was not precisely known for his detective skills. Actually, practically none of the Unspeakables were investigative geniuses. The detective work was usually given to the Aurors before the Unspeakables were even made aware that the case existed. Draco privately thought that the Ministry would be far more effective if the Unspeakables were tasked with more than trailing after the Aurors, cleaning up their messes.
Harry’s face relaxed around the edges, and his eyes flicked between Draco’s, too close to look at both at once. “You’re not?” His voice was soft. Sweet and vulnerable.
Later, when they were sat on opposite ends of the bath with their legs twined together and a mountains of bubbles between them, Draco apologized.
Draco found it amusing how fickle his father’s interest in him were. For months on end, he would have no interest in having to do anything with Draco. But then suddenly, on a whim, he cared enough to send Draco across the country and go rummaging through his belongings and discipline him with essay writing. It was all very confusing, being cared for only when it was interesting or convenient.
And then it was later, much later, with Draco on his back with his eyes closed and Harry curled around him, a hand on his stomach and his head under Draco’s chin.
“Once.” Harry exhaled. The lake lapped gently a couple feet away from their shoes. “I don't mean this as offense to you, but he doesn't care. Not about anything, except for maybe how much money his horses will make.”
She twirls a curl of hair around her finger and smiles up at him. “I had a question for you. About the assignment.”
Harry kicked off his boots and sat down in front of the armchair. He leaned his head against Draco's calf. "Yes, I'm glad I did it."
Harry shook his head from the couch before standing and coming over to stand behind Draco at his desk. "He wants to see you, too."
The friendly voice let out a garbled groan. "Merlin! He's brilliant, but a blunt-headed idiot sometimes!"
Harry twists and rolls over to face Draco, his face smiling and bright. “You know,” Harry says, touching their noses together. “I think you may be right.”
At first, Draco ignored it. He spoke to Harry constantly without being able to hear his own words, unsure of his volume, tone, or sounds. But he spoke, and Harry traced words into his skin for him to interpret, and the burning grew worse and worse.
Harry sets his head down on Draco's back, the place just above where his shoulder blades come to the center. His nose is just close enough to Draco's hairline to gently nestle into the scent of blond curls, lemon shampoo, and anxiety driven sweat. He wraps his arms under Draco's and presses his palms to Draco's chest to feel the rise and fall of his skin and the steady thump of his heart.
“But I don’t want sex.” Harry breathes slowly, in and out. “Genitalia makes me feel gross. It makes me uncomfortable. I don’t want it. I don’t want anything to do with it. And-” Harry takes another slow breath. “It took me a long time to figure that out. I didn’t know anyone who felt like that, the way I did. People either wanted to have sex, or they didn’t. No one felt desire for someone... but didn’t want to have sex with them.”
Harry brushed a hand over the top of Draco's head. "Darling, I really think he'd like to see us both this week."
“Good money.” Harry shrugged. “Endless grounds to discover. It’s not like he comes here, so I wasn’t particularly bothered.”
Draco rolled up into a seating position and glared blearily at Harry, tangled in the sheets and curled up facing Draco, still very asleep.
Draco marveled at this, the fact that Harry wouldn’t be bothered. Draco was the type of person to be bothered by someone lacing their left shoe before the right one.
“It better,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s cheek as he passed behind his seat. “I’m off to work. Don't sign the card as Draco Potter, don't forget your tie, and don't worry about the laundry. I’m coming home at six, and I expect to know why in Morgana’s long tresses you were targeted by this Adam Hornby by the end of today.”
"Draco's assigned Healers didn't know what it was," Harry said, his eyes flicking between them. "Hermione figured it out. She works in the children's ward normally, but she was the one that told me it was
Harry untangled one of his hands from Molly's grip and set it over Draco's. "Draco, love, don't look so worried. She can stay with us tonight, if you'd like." Harry shrugged and pulled Draco's fingers tighter in his. "It's not like we have some elaborate wedding night planned. We're just going home." Harry lifted both their hands and tilted Draco's chin up. When Draco looked at him, Harry was grinning. "Obviously, we've already done the deed." He looked pointedly at their baby in his arms. "There's no pressure to do anything special."
It turned out that only one of his shirts needed adjustments, and one of the jackets was a little too long, but all of the other items Daisy had bought fit Draco well.
Harry sighed, and Draco relished in the noise. It still hadn’t quite sunk in to him that this was all his again. Harry’s irritated puffing, the smell of his skin, the feeling of his collar bone under Draco’s ear. It felt new all over, like how it had felt when they first got together ten years ago. Exciting, and confusing, and precious.
, Draco had no intentions of acting on them, nor did he think he would end up in a position where it would be appropriate for himself to get involved with Harry. Or any men. Acknowledging Draco was attracted to men was one thing. Behaving according to that attraction was quite another.
were linked. What did he not understand about that?" Draco placed the voice as Wilson's. Fair man, coming to Draco's deathbed, although apparently it was to shout about Draco's incompetency.
"Quite." Draco waved his hand through the air. "So. Adam Hornby一ugh, it’s still ridiculous一mastermind of the Mortem smuggling ring took over Robards' position in order to get us off his case. We can dig into how he got in there later."
The Healer held a sympathetic hand out for Draco to take, but neither Harry nor Draco moved toward it. The Healer dropped it, and began to write in the air again.
Scorpius relaxed and Draco reached into the pocket of his robes to pull out a little handkerchief he carried especially for Scorpius. He wiped it over his palms and in between his small fingers.
Daisy laughed again before taking another sip of her tea. “Yes, I’m sure.” She set her cup down, and straightened the folds of her trousers neatly. “Daisy mentioned to me that you might have some interest in going out to town.”
She shrugged. “I don't know. It’s interesting that you know these things, I suppose. Interesting that you bring it up now.”
The caking heat of the day had already settled into the ground, and radiated from above and below as Draco trekked out to the lemon trove. He tugged at the edges of his buttoned collar, and hoped that Daisy would get a chance to go into town for new clothing soon. Each day he spent sweating through his uptight collared clothes that he wore in the smog of London was another set of clothing ruined, and another slight raise in Draco’s irritation.
Draco crossed the room and pressed a quick kiss to Harry’s cheek before taking his wand. “Thank you,” Draco murmured. “Don’t know what I’d do without you.”
Looking at her was like looking at a very fragile little sun. Something so very large and momentous and delicate that it completely changed the trajectory of everything around it, and pulled it into its own orbit, its own galaxy. The knot in his chest from before was nothing like this. Draco smiled down at the girl, rubbed his finger over her peach soft cheek, and cried. Harry held him tight and whispered in his ear, and the Healer eventually left. Draco was lost inside his daughter's little galaxy, spinning around her, her, her. She was everything now. She was all he saw. Draco wanted to look at her forever.
“No one can agree on it,” Draco said. “Some people believe it is longevity, others believe it is love or friendship. Still others think that it revolves around bitterness and disappointment.”
Draco sat, cradling his and Harry's plates of spaghetti in his hands, staring down at it blankly while the murmurs of Harry's voice rose in the other room, muffled by the crackling of the fireplace. Draco was thirsty. It was the stupid scratch in his throat, scraping up and down and up and down. He needed water.
Some Sundays, Harry cried and muttered the whole walk to the other cemetery. Other times, he said nothing for days leading up to Sunday, and nothing for days following it. Other Sundays, like today, Harry lost himself in his own mind, and could barely move without Draco prompting him.
He shook his head. He had to think about this like an equation: one part at a time that could be solved with a sharp process.
They turned around and walked back towards the entrance to the cemetery. Draco felt Scorpius lift his head, and knew he was staring at James and Lily's grave behind him. Draco had to put conscious effort into not squeezing Scorpius too hard.
Draco patted his pocket and pointed at Harry to take the bags the cashier was holding out. "Well, that's very nice. Personally, I was thinking, 'I hope I get to be a Potter someday.' So I think - grab the bags, Harry - that we should be Potters."
Draco shook his head and scolded himself furiously. This whole pattern was becoming slightly frightening, what with the leaning out over the balcony every time Harry trotted by like a swooning maiden. Draco prided himself on
Draco looked up from his books, stuck his finger between the pages to mark his place, and then set it down on his lap. "Told anyone about what?"
If someone were to ask Draco, he would say that Harry is quiet. He doesn’t speak when he reads, cooks, pretends to knit, kisses, watches the telly. He watches and he listens and he lets Draco do the talking.
When they brought the baby, in a tiny rolling bed, Draco felt nothing. There was Harry's hand, and Harry's crying, and Harry's muted gasps, but Draco felt nothing. He felt like lying limp again and letting someone else take the baby from him.
"Draco," Harry said. He tapped his fingers over Draco's knuckles lightly. "You don't get coffee from the interns."
A warm mouth pressed in at the back of Draco's neck. Breath fluttered over the hair at the nape of Draco's neck, but he didn't hear the words that came along with it.
It’s another two hours of watching them clean up Draco’s and the girl’s smashed cars, of talking to the police and watching the ambulances drive away, talking to the girl’s parents when they get there. She starts crying as soon as her mum’s car pulls over to the side of the road. They tow the cars and the police put together insurance papers. Harry talks to everyone, buys water bottles for the girl and Draco from a nearby petrol station, holds Draco close to his side, and tells the girl who won’t let go of her mother that it’s all okay.
Draco looks up at him with swollen eyes. “Me too,” he says, hoarse. “I’m so glad. And she’s okay too, the girl. One of the police said.”
"Yes," Draco said, and smiled at him. "But I promise I'll bring cut ones next time, so we don't have to conjure any."
Feeling lighter and happier with himself than he had since he’d arrived at the estate, Draco made his way down to the library. He only wished to stop in quickly and pick up a new book. He’d finished his first reads of all the books he could find on the language of flowers, and although he intended to study them further, he was in need of something fresh to focus on. He found something relatively new in
Harry hugged Draco, too tight to breathe. Carried him around the house so Draco didn't have to sit rigidly in the wheelchair. Tried to feed Draco, although Draco closed his mouth firm against it. Kissed Draco all the time. Draco liked that. These were the few things he was aware of outside of the abiding pain.
Draco looked up from his desk to see Wilson standing in the doorway of his office with his arms folded over his chest and his eyebrows drawn up in the middle.
Draco disappears to spit out his toothpaste, and then returns, smelling of mint and citrus shampoo. He climbs up the bed and drops down beside Harry, curling an arm around his waist and pressing his nose in the back of his neck.
It was things like that, but it was also things like the Healer check ups he now had to go to. It was also the lying about where he was when he began to have to go to those Healer appointments during work hours. It was promising Harry that he wouldn't take any field missions.
“What?” Draco lifted his head from where he’d had it propped on his desk as he traced the rim of his mug.
”Okay,” Draco said to himself. He turned sharply to face the stack of files, and raised his arms out in front of him, wand gripped tightly in his right.
“I didn’t know you were married,” Jane begins immediately as they’re leaving the greenhouse. “Especially not to a man.”
“Okay,” Draco says. There’s a long beat before there’s a horrible scraping noise on the other end of the line, and Harry flinches before realizing it’s the sound of Draco sobbing.
Draco said quietly, “You’ve got it wrong.” Harry looked at him. “I don't share. It was a slip, telling you those things.”
“Like I’m stabbing you repeatedly with a blunt knife.” Draco smiles a little. “I’m not leaving. I don’t think you’re wrong.” His thumb rubs the back of Harry’s hand, like a soft breeze soothing down the waves of the twisting rivers of Harry’s blood thundering through his veins. “I’m here. Right here.”
Harry’s stomach twists around and drops, and his heart thuds, and the rivers of blood winding over his knuckles are pounding, pounding, pounding.
"Okay, fine," Harry said. "I think the name Malfoy is stupid. But it's yours. I want something of you in my name."
Harry smiled, his eyes glassy and ringed with red and heavy dark circles. There was a slight choking sound, and then Harry lurched forward on top of Draco.
pamphlets. The desk was in their living room, crammed into one corner by a tiny window, because Harry had insisted on leaving the spare room free for their friends to crash if needed.
“I’m coming,” Harry says, sprinting out of their apartment without bothering to lock it behind him. “I’m coming, Draco. Give me fifteen minutes.”
Harry turned his head to the side to kiss Draco, and Draco tasted sweet tomato juice, earl grey, mint, and a pinch of parsley.
It was around this time that Draco recalled a moment from quite a few months back, when Bailey had first taken over for Robards. Bailey had brought Draco coffee. Draco thought about the bitter bite of coffee, and was sad because he’d never taste it again.
Draco didn't feel anything wrong yet. Yes, his throat hurt, and his bones felt as if an erumpment had been sitting on them for several hours, and possibly his head was still pounding. But he didn't feel like he was dying. Draco wasn't ready to die.
Night air blows over the back of Draco’s neck, coming in through the window of Draco’s apartment. Harry’s hands come up, and then the cool of the night is replaced with the warm cradle of Harry’s palms.
Just as Draco was leaving the library, a body stepped in front of him. Draco instantly knew it to be Harry’s without looking up. Kit and Daisy didn’t have his height, and Roy never withdrew from his cooking.
“I used to think that I would want sex,” Harry begins. It’s easier to stare down at his own knees as he says this, so he does. “I’m attracted to men and women, their bodies. I like their arms, their shoulders, their hands. I want their stomachs, and their chests, and their legs. Their thighs and their heels and the underside of their jaw.” Harry shakes himself a little. “That’s too general. What I want to say, is I want those things from you. I’m attracted to those things about you.”
Draco didn't follow, not for a long time. He knew, after years of life with Harry, when to follow and when to give him space.
Draco ditched the Manor clothes he’d been wearing earlier that day and put on some of the new clothes Daisy brought. Cream shirt, tapered trousers, suspenders, his treasured Oxfords he’d worn on the train.
With a month and a half left to go, the Healers put him in a wheelchair. Draco tried to protest, raising his voice without knowing and flapping his arms wildly, but then he fell off the examination table, and the Healers got their way.
Draco sighs and Harry blinks. “Can you explain it?” Draco asks. “I want to understand. I’ve always known I wanted to... with someone. Have sex, that is. I suppose there’s no reason to skirt around it.” Draco isn’t looking at Harry, he’s looking down at the olive green pillow tassels, but his feet are still folded up under his bum and his shoulders face Harry, so Harry isn’t worried. Not yet. “You don’t want sex?” he asks, to confirm what Harry’s already said twice.
Harry sets a hand on his back and lets Draco rock back and forth. He hushes into his ear, but he knows Draco isn’t going to consoled, and it’s probably best to let him get this all out of his system. He’s scared, and shaken, as well as anyone would be, and Harry telling him to calm down isn’t going to do any good. So he rubs Draco’s back and tells him that he loves him.
“Well,” she said. “It is certainly a fascinating subject. One I haven’t delved into myself, but I am interested to hear about it.”
Mrs. Weasley gave Molly one last pat before giving her to Harry. "Well, not for you to worry, dear. Arthur and I will be taking her tonight, so the newlyweds can enjoy themselves," Mrs. Weasley said with a wink. Draco blanched. Mrs. Weasley didn't seem to notice though, bending over to kiss all their cheeks before ambling off, her bright purple robes swaying behind her.
“I’m sorry,” Harry mumbled. His hands dropped, but quickly began twisting through the dandelions like Draco’s were. Draco noted the movement, but tried to ignore the implications of Harry’s mirrored actions.
"But," Draco said, "I cannot in good conscience marry you, even though it's what I want most in the world, knowing that I'll be leaving you behind before we've even had enough time to plan a wedding."
Draco swallowed down air and stared at Harry, the frantic jerks of his movement, the skittering pattern of his mouth. He tried not to cry, tried to keep his breathing even. He had no idea what sounds he was making, if any. All he knew was that he was standing in his kitchen with burning liquid dripping down his legs and Harry talking at him, and he couldn't feel anything.
”That would be lovely,” Draco said, leaning in to kiss Harry one more time before turning back to their cramped desk.
Harry is still choking on his breath. “Er. Yes. Miss Wimblefon, can we resume this conversation at a later time?”
"You dolt," Harry said, still looking shocked and afraid. "I don't want to do that with anyone else. I want to do it with you."
Draco hesitated. “I want to be a bit conservative about your active use of magic, and it looked as though you were feeling some effects. Is that the case?”
Draco tried—without much success, or all that much effort—to school his features. “There’s no coconut in my flat.”
The silence that follows is so complete that Draco suspects he could hear a quill drop. He can’t resist the urge to fill it. “We are prepared to make a retraction—also in blind form, so as not to name names, as I assume you would prefer—which I will oversee myself.”
Draco takes a pinch of Floo Powder and holds it between his fingers. He can barely breathe. If he does this, there may be one more thing he can’t take back, and is he sure? Can he be sure? Can he be ready, could he ever be ready, for this thing that he’s about to do?
Robards leaves them standing in front of the door, Harry with his heart in his throat and Phillips behind him.
Draco straightens his back. He may be on his knees, but it’s strictly a matter of necessity; there’s no need to attach any sort of symbolism to it. “Yes.”
Harry’s cock, already objecting to the confines of his jeans, throbs when Draco takes his wrist and trails his fingers over the outline of Draco’s cotton-covered erection. “Like that?”
Draco couldn’t help looking at him like he’d gone a bit mad, but he took it and let Harry push it in.
“No. How long do you think it will stay that way? Hmm? How long do you think it will be before new members of the same old families start making their way back in? And when they do, what is it that you want them to come in believing? That Muggles are animals and playthings? That it’s kill or be killed? Or that having Muggle art on their walls, that having Muggle social contacts, is completely de rigeur? Tell me, Golden Boy, which of those scenarios ends well?”
“To remind him that he needs his magic. To convince him of my theory. To try and develop a treatment plan that won’t require surgery.”
He was very careful to prepare me. Overly careful, to be candid. He used quite a bit of lubricant, which made his fingers a bit chilly on entrance, and he was easily startled out of his rhythm at first. Until he realised the noises I was making weren’t in pain. Not in the least. Until I asked him to add another, to go harder.
It’s no use. He tilts his head and starts to walk, twelve steps towards you, a sharp right, and he’s out the side door, with just one last glance your way.
“It’s one of a set,” Draco repeats. “Three ceremonial knives, passed down through the Black family. Ownership of them was last transferred to,” his voice cracks and he hates himself for it, “three sisters. Each received one of them on her seventeenth birthday.”
They managed to halfway fall through that door, too, Draco toeing off his shoes and socks after stumbling over them, and pinning Harry to the wall beside the open door. “Want you,” he said into Harry’s clavicle. “Want to touch you.”
He’s done what he can with it. There’s plenty of furniture to choose from, of course, though none of it matches. Still, he’s always had an eye for these sorts of things. At least, he knows what a nice room ought to look like. The headboards of two king sleigh beds serve as something of a wall. He’s got a sectional and a chaise and a set of side tables and an Aubusson that he’s always half-expecting someone to claim. He’s also got a few bottles of good whisky, pilfered months ago after someone Vanished a particularly outrageous weekend.
Harry gasps at the sudden contact and moves his fingers from the sheets to Draco’s hair. It’s a hard tug at first, but that’s real too, and that’s what Draco wants most of all.
“I don’t need to hear about your boyfriend’s objections.” Draco looks down to shuffle through his diary. “Shall I send Twilfit, or do you have something appropriate?”
. Flipped past Quidditch results and was happy enough to notice that the Falcons were still performing well, though even that didn’t elicit more than a mildly pleased hum. He considered a request for World Cup tickets; he still had a few of the old Slyths around on occasion, and it might be nice to throw something of meaning their way. But Quidditch tickets were the sort of thing one threw in as an extra. They were far too trifling for the main event.
He wasn’t sure it mattered. Malfoy’s eyes were blank. His chest rose and fell evenly. When he crossed his hands on the table, the chains clattered against the wood, and Harry had to restrain himself from jumping at the sound of it. He tried to think of something to say, something to ask. But he’d been doing that for what felt like hours, and there was nothing that didn’t feel too stupid, too facile, to be worth asking.
Draco took himself in hand and guided the head of his cock to Potter’s hole. Potter was so tight around him, his hole already clenching, trying to take in more. And while Draco prided himself on his control, this was hardly the time.
“No?” Draco leans back and cocks his head, making absolutely certain that Potter feels the promise in his gaze. “Prove it.”
A vein in Potter’s forehead pulsed. “And you can’t imagine someone choosing to put other people first without it being an order!”
As if Draco’s dismay wasn’t bad enough, the rest of their group is looking, to varying degrees, shocked and appalled.
“Exactly. He wouldn’t do that. Draco, if he didn’t like your terms, he would’ve had you arrested. If he went on a date with you, it’s because he wanted to.”
Before Potter can respond, the Junior Undersecretary looks to his pocket watch and gasps. “Oh, goodness! We’ve got a babysitter to relieve. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Malfoy.”
He loves this about Harry. His expressiveness. Knowing exactly how, and how much, he likes it. Knowing what it means when he starts to roll his hips like this.
Draco forestalled them with an extended hand. “He will be perfectly fine, but needs his rest. I will pass on your good wishes. Please, take your time to enjoy the food and tea, with compliments, and thanks very much for coming.”
Draco doesn’t resist. He lets Potter turn his face so that they’re looking at each other, really looking, and just that—just the five points of Potter’s fingertips against his skin—is enough to leave him speechless and sad.
“Well, Parseltongue isn’t so much a reading language, usually. Snakes... not really big writers. So whatever’s in there, the snake will most likely have to read it to me.”
Draco froze, resisting the urge to edge closer. He’d suspected that Harry’s insistence that the Unspeakables’ surgical team had been caring was a gross exaggeration, but he didn’t find any comfort in having been right. He very much wished he hadn’t been.
Potter startles at that. Their proximity? Draco’s posture? Draco’s unsure, and even less sure that he cares as long as Potter’s on the defensive
“And what’s to say you won’t tell me to go enjoy the lifestyle to which I’ve grown accustomed in Siberia?”
Potter frowned, but the line of his shoulders seemed to relax. “I suppose I’d better go along with it, then, hadn’t I?”
It’s almost peaceful. Peaceful in a way Draco’s job hasn’t been since week 158, since before Potter’s pile of Hippogriff droppings made their appearance, since his days became consumed with helping Potter, or waiting for Potter, or trying to get twice as much done so he’s free on Potter days.
Draco thought Potter looked like he had a few other questions on the tip of his tongue, but Granger turned back and continued on before Draco could get at them. “He’ll be fine, I’m sure. He’s not as stuffy as he seems.”
“Is that common?” Draco asked, and looked past him to get another glimpse of Potter, still focused on his plate.
Draco froze and slowly set the quill down again. He turned around to face Harry, but stayed in his seat. "How long have you been feeling this way?"
It was slow and saccharine, riddled with adoration. Harry tugged Draco closer to him and wrapped his arms around his waist, to be close to him and to carry some of the weight of pregnancy off his feet. Draco sighed happily into his mouth before tipping away to place kisses on Harry’s neck and cheek. Harry smiled. He couldn’t stop smiling.
“Well,” Draco said, rubbing his forehead with the heel of his hand. “Yes. I won’t go into the details, but it can be fairly said that I didn’t have much of a choice.”
“Because I love you,” Draco says happily before sending a stinging jinx in the direction of Harry’s backside. “Very, very much.”
Harry noticed when Draco choked on it, and looked at him questioningly. Draco shook his head and smiled. Coughed a little, and tried to indicate that it had gone down the wrong tube. Harry kept staring at him with concern etched into lines by his mouth that Draco hadn't ever noticed before. Draco took a large gulp of the wine and swallowed it smoothly to ease the expression on Harry's face. Finally, Harry looked away. Draco didn't see his mouth move much for the rest of the dinner.
Harry nodded and blinked furiously. "Right, of course. I know. I just一four months. How did we not realize something was going wrong inside of you for four months?"
Draco set his tea cup down on its plate with a clatter. “I can’t believe you’d read it, and didn’t tell me the whole time I was ranting on about the wiles of Mr. Darcy’s character!”
Jane glances over at Draco briefly and narrows her eyes. She opens her mouth to speak again, but Draco looks up from his hash and stares at her with wide grey eyes. Too wide to really be attractive, people have said before. Harry likes them.
Wilson followed close behind him, his clambering footsteps distracting Draco from the thoughts fusing together in his mind.
in school, but he’d never actually read the book. His stance on the paper was to analyze a notorious story from an outsider’s perspective. The truth was that Draco hadn’t had the time to read the book before the assignment was due. The professor had told him, privately, that his argument was excellent, but he hadn’t fulfilled the prompt. Draco didn’t mind the slight dip in his grades; the compliment from the professor was reward enough.
"And also," Harry said, his voice quieter. "I would like to tell Ron. I will completely understand if you refuse, but I need someone to talk to about this."
And then Draco remembered that he couldn't feel anything below the middle of his shins or the tips of his fingers, and so he agreed. Harry said he would help transcribe his work in the evenings while Draco did all the thinking, and that was even better.
Harry leaned further back into the couch and began to circle the tips of his fingers over the bunched seam of Draco's trousers at the joint of his knee. He looked at Draco, his gaze slow and careful. "I'm not going to leave you here. I'll just firecall Ron and reschedule. Then I can stay here and take care of you."
"Yes, you are. You're thinking, what if we had realized sooner? What did we miss? If we knew something was wrong earlier, then we could've stopped it."
Draco narrowed his eyes. Thought about yelling at Harry and cursing him out. Decided he was tired. Then relaxed his face and held his arms out. In the end, Draco could forgive Harry for this one very large thing that, in the end, likely wouldn't matter very much. They had worked through worse.
Draco shrugged. "Why do you think? Because you'd just had seven firewhiskeys, and - little did I know at the time - I was about to get pregnant in my eighth year of school. It never quite seemed the time to say, 'oh, Harry. I understand we've only been dating for two months, and the drunken-shag-baby is really putting a damper on our plans, but I've wanted to marry you since we were fourteen years old.'" Draco smiled at the cashier and waved genially at her as they left the market.
Draco held up a hand. “Don't.” He dropped his hand. “Have a nice rest of your day.” With that, Draco picked up the speed of his footsteps and sped ahead of Harry. Harry was smart enough not to try to keep up with him.
“Ah, yes,” Bailey said jovially, tucking his thumbs into his pockets. Draco wrinkled his nose at the sight. “Well, I heard that you were working on the Mortem case.”
Draco watched Harry's mouth as he turned to the Healer and spoke. He couldn't do more than guess at the words, but he could almost hear Harry's voice, cracking and sore.
Draco glanced to Harry, who was still staring vaguely out the window, and smiled. "Just a minute, darling, thank you."
Draco fell asleep that night with his fingers gripped in between Harry's, and the night sparkling beyond their gray, empty ceiling.
When he padded back into the kitchen, Draco was already seated, patiently waiting for Harry with his hands folded on the table and a serene expression on his face.
He looks around frantically. Blond hair - where is he? It takes only a moment before he sees a shock of white hair and skin, and he’s off, running to Draco. There are paramedics, police, and firemen crowded around, but only one holds an arm to stop Harry before he's crashing straight through to Draco. Draco's standing on the curb, his hands clutched onto his jacket and his eyes wide. His face is splotchy and red, and his breathing is irregular and frantic.
Harry heard the bang, cancelled the firecall, and ran to the living room. He found Draco, face down, sprawled, and covered in broken porcelain and spaghetti sauce. And so the call was interrupted, and the third part of Draco's impending illness was complete.
Draco holds on tight, and Harry holds on tight, words still tumbling out of his mouth, and the world blows itself out into something not quite tangible.
Draco closed the file he'd been working on, and smiled. "Hello, Wilson. How are you doing this afternoon?"
Harry laughed and held out his arms to take Molly. "I think you've all gotten her too excited. She won't go down at all tonight, I'm sure."
Draco's head snapped up to see Harry already looking at him. Draco didn't particularly want to learn sign language. Based on the time the Healer had given to him the last time they were there, Draco only had about two months left. It seemed a little pointless to waste his and Harry's time on something that would only be needed for another month一until his eyes gave out. But then, Harry was staring at him, his fingers twitching helplessly against the table, and his lips pursed tightly. Draco thought that it might be nice to be able to communicate with Harry in some way before all means of conveyance were stolen from him.
Scorpius grunted, but patted Draco's neck. "It's okay, Papa. Daddy needs them for Grandmum and Grandpa."
"Me too," Harry says, feeling it so much in that moment. That tightness and the exhale of knowing Draco's safe in the next room all at once.
"Right," Wilson said. A pair of loud footsteps aggressively approached where Draco was lying before something slapped him hard across the face.
Harry finally looked away from Draco, shifting to stare up at the ceiling. “I don't know. I didn’t think I was going to go back.”
"I think he believes that if he purifies himself, using the magic cores of the young witches, then he will be absolved of everything he did to get them there. Their purity will grant him the title of一the report says "Jesus." What is that?" Wilson pulled one of the paper's held up by Draco's magic a little closer.
Very little time passed before Draco was reminded of why he had been avoiding this clearing in the first place.
Draco hadn't wanted to be pregnant, hadn't wanted a baby, when he first found out months ago. He hadn't really wanted it until the baby started kicking at his stomach from the inside, if he were being excruciatingly honest. But then, slowly, like threads tangling in a breeze, something had risen and grown from the inside. A tangle and tie of thought and feeling that had gathered and gathered until it was a lump in his chest. He wanted his baby... and he still couldn't look at her.
"Alright then," Harry says. He runs his fingers through Draco's hair. "Have a sit on the couch for a moment, honey. I'll have everything ready in just a minute."
"Don't call me baby. You only call me baby when you have to go on long distance missions," Draco huffed. He folded his arms over his chest. "And I went to Mungo's before and they said I had a cold."
"That Molly wasn't staying with us tonight," Draco said. He stared down at his hand on Harry's knee. "I just - I haven't been away from her for longer than an hour before," Draco said, trying to keep the anxiety out of his voice. "And that was only once so I could go pick up new bottles for her at the store." Draco swallowed hard. "And she was with you."
He would tell her more about it some other time. As Draco had learned from experience, trying to absorb it all at once jumbled up the colors and meanings in one’s brain to the point that they were indecipherable. It was better to focus on one flower at a time. Lemons were the best place to start, the most delightful and intriguing. Draco still had no plans to tell Kit of the lemon trove on the estate, whether or not she was already aware of it.
A paramedic with thin brown hair pulled back in a ponytail nods at him. "Good to know." She watches Draco as she speaks to Harry. "This is quite normal for anyone in a serious accident. Is this his first accident?"
Draco stared at the wall as Harry sobbed beside him, his ribs expanding desperately against Draco's side.
Harry stopped, froze right in the middle of the living room. "Draco," his voice broke. "It's always going to be too soon."
In fact, nothing felt real anymore. Draco simply floated in the abyss of nothing and waited for the hand of beyond nothing that would drag him through the last barrier.
"I don't need you to do that, darling," Draco said when Harry first came home with a briefcase full of Draco's paperwork. "I can go into the Ministry just fine."
Draco’s head swiveled around to see Harry Potter standing at the edge of the cove, wringing his hands together.
Draco obeyed and his vision slowly cleared. He didn't dare lift his head again and risk another epic collapse.
But he never said anything, and Harry never seemed to see down to that pit in his stomach. Or, if he did, he didn't have a way to ask Draco about it that wouldn't end in frustrated tears and ripped up parchment paper. So they didn't talk about it.
“Because,” Harry said, “I didn’t expect you to… care. Not about flowers per se, but about anything. I expected you to be like your father.”
Harry glances up from his knees. Draco is nodding, his eyebrows drawn together in the middle, and his hands still holding firm to Harry’s.
Draco bit down on the lemon. He wasn’t sure why; it was odd. And it was bitter, so bitter. Draco spit it out and let it dribble down his chin before dunking his face in the water in disgust.
They did not pass the old Potter house. They never did on the way to the cemetery, always on Sundays. Harry insisted they only go to the house on their way home to their own cottage, returning from the graveyard.
Wilson glared down at him with his hands on his hips and his cheeks ruddy with frustration. "What is wrong with you?"
Harry nods and folds his arms. “Precisely. Which is why you are only working on the theoretical application of this spell, and not trying to use it on your classmates.”
Harry withdraws one of his hands from Draco's chest to run it over his shoulder and down the length of his ribs to just above the dimples in his back, under the water. "Draco, honey. This is hard now, but you'll get back behind the wheel. All of this fear will fade with time, and-"
"We could be Malfoy-Potters," Harry said, looking hopeful and wide open. "Harry and Draco Malfoy-Potter."
“Oh, no. Not at all,” Harry says. He lifts his head up and grins at Draco. “In fact, it may be a bit late if McGonagall has anything to do with it.”
Draco had not, at the time, intended to drink the coffee. Draco did not, actually, like coffee. Draco drank earl grey tea exclusively, nearly always made by Harry. On the rare occasion that Harry didn’t make the tea, then Draco made it himself. No one else.
Harry lets out a breath and holds out his hand for Draco to take. “I think you’re right, love. They really are getting dimmer.”
Harry can’t hear Draco’s words over the gasps of his exhalations. “I... an accident... I was in.... I thought... oh god. I can’t breathe.”
Draco, in all of the new sweet goodness that Harry has found in him, lifts one of Harry’s hands to his mouth and kisses it.
Harry sighed. “Oh, you know. Turning in work late left and right, but what I can do? I can’t resist their pleading faces.”
It felt nice. The weight of Harry's body over his, moving around him and lifting Draco's legs, then bending his knees, rubbing his hands down his arms, all with gentle, watchful care. Draco smiled, dizzy and saccharine. Smiled, and smiled, and smiled. When Harry nudged his thighs further apart and pressed inside, Draco's mouth fell open in a small noiseless gasp, and Harry nestled his head into the bend of Draco's shoulder.
“I assume not,” Draco said drily. He set the shirt back down. It appeared to be very一there was no other word for it一country. Draco tried not to mind. After all, hadn’t the past three weeks shown him that the countryside wasn’t all bad?
Draco lifted Harry’s hand in his from over the pan of cooking meat and turned it back and forth, admiring the dull glint of gold on his ring finger. “Me too.”
Draco hadn't even had time to recoil back on the couch before Mrs. Weasley was lifting him and hugging him close, patting his hair, and asking for his favorite dinners.
"I love you," Draco whispered down to her, smiling. He smoothed down the front of her sleep swaddle, pale green with tiny daisies that Luna had given to them at their engagement party. "Molly Potter."
Draco pulls away for a split second, and Harry says, “You’re wonderful.” His voice is hoarse, at a loss for the wonder that is Draco Malfoy.
Draco shook his head. Wet hair, blonde, a little too long, stuck to his cheeks and his forearms where his head was resting. "No. I simply feel a little off. I'll be alright after a good night's sleep."
He rolled to face Harry and leaned into him without pause. This part was easy, had always been easy. The slip and glide of their mouths, the roll of their limbs, the tumbling into each other.
Draco tried to put his robes on and go to work, but Harry held on to his arm and begged Draco to stay home until Draco finally relinquished and let Harry lay him down on the couch.
Draco blew out a breath and folded the letter back up. He stared up at the arching ceilings of his room before unfolding the letter and reading it over again.
With her gone, Draco took the time to run his fingers over all the clothes again, rubbing the material between his fingers and refolding all the shirts. He wouldn’t admit it to anyone, but he liked these clothes a significant amount. Apart from being practical, they held a certain casual fashion that Draco rather fancied.
“I’m so glad you’re okay,” Harry says, his voice breaking. He leans his face close to Draco’s and sets his chin down on Draco’s shoulder. “So glad.”
Draco rolls over Harry and settles between Harry’s legs. Draco pushes in close, as close as he can, and Harry’s knees fall open.
The Healer glanced around the waiting room carefully before turning back to Draco. "Not even your mum or dad?"
The trousers were much the same. Tailored, breathable, and a perfect cut to accentuate the slimness of his waist next to the length of his legs. Daisy had also bought him suspenders, a few sturdy jackets, several sweaters for cool evenings, socks, and a leather bag.
Draco looked to Harry, who was staring straight ahead and now holding onto Draco with both of his hands. Harry's face was thin and wan, and his eyes glassed over.
Harry nods. His eyes are glassy, full, turned up toward Draco. He’s breathing, over and over again, “I love you, I love you.”
Draco lay there, caked in drying sweat, blood drying between his thighs, and no baby in his arms. He wanted to see the baby, he did. Only, he was nineteen, and he was here
The three of them talked, and occasionally looked to Draco as if expecting him to make some comment or jibe, and then quickly looked away again when they realized he had no idea what they were talking about.
Draco turned to see Harry standing in the door. His hair stuck out around his ears and his t-shirt - Draco thought it might have been one of his from school - hung off his left shoulder. Draco held out his hand, and Harry walked to him without hesitation, dropping his head onto Draco's shoulder next to Molly's immediately.
“Okay.” They sat in silence for a long while before Draco said anything else. “Can I ask you something?”
“I’m not like that,” Harry said. “I’m friendly enough with people, but I don't much fancy sharing the things I love with people I don't know.”
"Oh." Harry moved away from when he'd been heading to the cloak rack. "That sounds nice. I wouldn't have woken you so early if I'd known."
He didn't mind. He was too focused on the senses in his body that had been deprived of him for months, finally trickling back in steady ribbons of awareness. Smell, taste, hearing, sight, touch. All his again.
His hands rose up the outsides of Draco’s thighs, bunching up the fabric of his pajama pants. Up his sides, bumping over his ribs, and then smoothing down his arms. Gathered adoringly over his stomach and the baby somewhere in there.
“Morning, Malfoy,” Bailey said, and sat down beside Draco. Draco shifted uncomfortably, but didn’t move away. “Got you a coffee.”
The windows, or doors rather, in Draco’s rooms led out to a small balcony. There was nothing on the balcony except for the sheer curtains blown in by the wind, and a grumpy Draco Malfoy, who had half a mind to drop a book on Harry Potter’s head from over the white painted railing.
Scorpius turned his face up to Draco from where he was sat in the front lawn. "But Papa. Daddy said I could play outside."
Kit laughed and rolled her eyes, setting her cup down more gently than Draco had. “I didn’t want to interrupt your speech. It was clearly well thought out.”
Draco sobs the whole way home in deep gasps and torrents of tears down the swollen red of his cheeks. Harry keeps a hand on his leg but lets him cry.
Harry stood abruptly, so fast he almost slipped and fell head first out of the tub. Draco grabbed onto his hips to steady him. "That's not fair," Harry said loudly. He was buck naked. "I want to marry you. I'm asking you. If that's what you want, and it's what I want, then we should get married."
So he held Scorpius tight to his chest and ran his fingers through the hair at the back of his head. He sang quietly in his ear and rocked gently from hip to hip. Scorpius murmured into Draco's neck in what Draco supposed was an attempt to sing along.
When the phone rings, Harry stares at the name for half a second before picking up, something heavy already in his stomach. Draco shouldn’t be calling him. Draco should be driving to Pansy’s just now.
Draco set his hand over Harry's on the fence and twined their fingers together. "Come along," he said gently, and took Harry by the hand to lead him forward into the street.
A cool hand lifted up to brush along the line of Draco's shoulder in the dark. Draco shrugged it off and groaned into his pillow. "'M hot. Lemme alone," Draco muttered.
Harry didn’t ask why, a small relief. “I’m sorry,” he said instead. “For making you spill scalding tea all over yourself, and for the pans. And for whatever else I did.”
Harry smiled and dropped his head down into the crook of Draco's neck. "I know, love. I'm just saying that it's Muggle tradition."
They sat, in the Weasley's garden, in the center of their wedding, with Molly wriggling across their laps, and their eyes on the party.
, Harry said again. Draco nodded and nodded, and kept nodding when Harry fell against him and sobbed, inaudibly, into Draco's cheek.
Draco smiled a little. "Darling, you don't have to ask for that." Draco carefully scooted himself to one side of the bed, ignoring the throbbing ache in his joints as he did so.
"Me?" Draco almost laughed, but his lungs hurt too much to get the sound out. "I'm not the one who leaves for month long missions. What do you have to be scared about me for?"
"Fat?" Harry let out a small laugh. "Draco. Honestly, I've never seen anything more beautiful than you in this moment."
Kit nodded and shifted her eyes away. Draco got the sense that she wished to continue looking at him, but knew that it made him uncomfortable.
Jane shakes her head hard. “What does it benefit though? Why engage in such complicated and dangerous magic? What does it do?”
"Robards went on leave in March," Draco said, waving his hand to draw forth an official work record with the attendance of all employees in the DMLE. "And Bailey stepped in immediately after Robards left."
"Thank you," said Harry. He didn't open his eyes or cry anymore. He simply lied down, his head in Draco's lap, and wrapped his arms tight around Draco's legs.
Out of the corner of Draco’s eye, he remarked Harry turning his head to stare out over the water in a mimickry of Draco.
Harry's grip on Draco's elbow tightened hard. It might've hurt under different circumstances, but Draco hardly noticed now.
Draco’s fingers twisted in the grasses underneath him. There was no point denying it. Even Draco was aware that his avoidance had been obvious. “Yes.”
Draco whirled around once he reached the desk Harry and he shared with the case files stacked up on it under a haphazard pile of
"Please," Draco replied, holding his hand out as Harry passed by to trail his fingers over the edge of his waistband. "Thank you."
"I'm so sorry," Harry said frantically, stumbling forward into the room and letting the door fall shut behind him. "I'm so sorry. I missed it."
Harry left his hand on Draco's thigh the whole night. He looked at Draco the most, always with a broad smile on his face that snagged and caught when Draco shook his head mutely.
The lines around Harry's face had spread from the corners of his mouth to his eyes, in between his eyebrows, his forehead. Draco wanted to press his fingers into all their creases and smooth them away. Instead, he let Harry tug him close, push down the collar of his sweater with his chin, and bite teeth and mouth into Draco's flesh.
It takes another four days after Jane faints in Harry’s office before she comes to confront him again.
Draco huffs and flicks his hair off his cheekbones. “So I share a last name with Harry Potter. Who do you think I am?”
Harry kissed the place Draco's thumb met his wrist before handing him his plate, nearly tipping over with the weight of pasta, and going to the next room to reschedule pub night with Ron.
This was a mistake. Draco’s stomach flipped in every direction, his heart beat too fast, the back of his neck was surely brick red. But Harry was sitting in front of him, looking at him, his knee almost touching Draco’s. There wasn’t a bone in Draco’s body that had enough willpower to turn away from this.
Draco looked away from Harry's red face, the part of his lips, the wide green of his eyes. "It means that I don't want to shackle you down to me four months before I die. Then, when I do die, you not only have to grieve for a partner, but a husband too. Then you'll be a widower, and you'll be a widower for your entire life. And when you eventually go off to marry someone else, it will be your second marriage." Draco took a deep breath. Harry's hands dropped off his knees. "I don't want to be your
Draco waited a long while, breathing in the scent of Harry's cologne, before he said anything else. When he did speak, he spoke slowly, haltingly. "You gave her to me," Draco began, looking down at Molly draped across their laps, her toes in the air and her fingers in her mouth. Harry had a hand over her leg, holding onto her, making sure she didn't roll away from them. Draco smiled, and let Harry's hand, protecting their daughter, give him the courage to continue. "And you gave me you." Harry's shoulder shifted under Draco's head. "And there is nothing I love you for more than that. Having you and having her, it's all I could ever want. It's what I love most."
Draco sighed and brushed a hand through his hair before settling it over Harry's hand. "Why don't you go? I'll stay home and rest, and you can go see Ronald."
Harry trips and nearly stumbles over into a collection of finger eating bushes before Draco grabs his sleeve and hauls him up.
"It's going to be okay," Harry whispers to him. It is okay. Everyone was safe. Harry keeps telling himself that over and over. Safe, safe. Everyone was safe. Draco is safe.
Harry looked as if he regretted saying anything as soon as the words left his mouth. He clapped his hands over his mouth and whirled around so his shoulder blades glared at Draco.
"Anyway," said Draco. "The point is, neither part of the phrase can exist without the other. So when Adam Hornby tagged his smuggling ring
Draco rubbed one of his fingers in a small circle over Molly's head. "I already told you. I want to be a Potter."
"And is she beautiful?" Harry asked eagerly, clutching onto Draco's hand and leaning in close. "Does she have your eyes?"
"Let me ask you something," Draco said, tilting his head to the side. "When you fucked me for the first time after we'd only been dating for two months, back in eighth year after seven firewhiskeys - yes, seven, I saw you drink them - were you thinking, 'Merlin, I can't wait to be a
Harry finally looked up from his feet and let his eyes wander across the names on headstones that they passed. Draco watched out of the corner of his eye as Harry's footsteps stuttered when they passed the statue of James and Lily and baby Harry. Draco did not look at it. He had seen the statue countless times, and he did not like to think about Harry as a tiny, tiny baby with no family. He also did not like to think about how familiar the shape of the trio was wrapped around each other, too similar to the family photos they had up on the mantle in their home. Draco and Harry leaned together with a little baby Scorpius in between them. James and Lily with their arms wrapped around each other and a little baby Harry in between them. It was close, so terrifying. Draco couldn't imagine what it would be like to lose his family, Harry and Scorpius. What it would be like if him and Harry died, and Scorpius was left alone in the world.
Draco swallows hard and shifts his gaze from Harry to the smashed cars sprawled across the intersection. “I was going straight,” he says. “The light turned yellow. A car pulled out to turn, but I couldn’t... I couldn’t stop in time.”
All the same, Draco made sure to pack lunches for Harry when he left to work on weekends, kissed him a little softer than was strictly necessary in the mornings, and tried not to wake him when Molly rose several times a night.
It didn’t matter what he would’ve imagined. This was what he wanted, more than anything else in the world, for the rest of his life.
Sorry it took me so long to upload this next chapter! I've had a ton going on, and it took me awhile to finish this one. I'm hoping I'll be able to start posting on a schedule again, but we'll see...
Draco took a heavy breath and tugged Harry along with him until they were standing in front of the gates to the cemetery. He dropped Harry's hand to open the gate, but then took it right back up again, and walked them through into the green meadow of stone and decaying cut flowers.
Harry sits absolutely still and watches him, waits for him to say something longer than a couple words at a time. The heater is humming and clicking the same way it’s been doing all autumn, and the wireless taps out an indecipherable rhythm from the far corner.
The paramedic nods and pats his arm. “Everyone’s okay. The police are getting statements right now, alright? We’ll figure out what happened. But everyone’s safe.”
Draco pushes his nose into the side of Harry’s neck and pulls the belt out of Harry’s belt loops. He tucks his fingers under Harry’s waistband, and Harry lifts his arms to circle around Draco’s neck and shoves his hands into Draco’s hair.
Harry's back rose heavily with his breath, and Draco paused, his hand hovering over Harry's skin. When Harry's breath settled back in again, Draco continued lettering words into Harry's skin. Just one word.
Draco didn't know what to do after that, so he hugged Hermione and Ronald back, and took Harry's hand to apparate them home.
Draco scoffed. The words were oddly familiar, as Draco had heard them coming from Kit’s mouth barely an hour earlier. He wondered if everyone he met thought him to be so quiet.
. Years! Merlin knows why I didn't ask ten years ago when I should have! But一" Harry's lip trembled. Draco did not point out that they were only just getting together ten years ago. "I've lost a decade that I could've been married to you, and I do not want一in six months一to look back and regret that I never took the chance. That I never just asked you. That I was never married to you. I won't be able to stand it."
Harry can hardly breathe. He’s staying calm for Draco’s sake, but his stomach is churning and there’s something dark and gaping open up in his chest. If anything’s happened...
"Yes, of course," the Healer said quietly, before taking the handles of the chair and wheeling Draco into a private room. "The head Healer will be right in."
Draco hummed before reaching over to turn the stove off and giving the sauce a few more stirs. “I don't mind.” He half turned around to peck Harry on the lips. “It means he’s alive.”
Except that they were nineteen - Draco could not get over this fact - and Draco had no money, and Harry had donated all his money to various organizations after the war because he hadn't imagined he'd ever need to use that much money. Draco had shouted at him when he found out, said he should have saved at least a little, had no one ever taught him anything at all about finances. Harry said no, in a very small voice, no one had ever taught him about finances. So they sat down, had a long talk, and decided that Harry would work so they could buy diapers and food for the baby.
"Poor baby," Draco murmured to her, bouncing her as he walked over to the window in her nursery. Draco glanced out at the night, the lights of London glittering quietly back at him. Draco cradled Molly close to his chest and hummed to her. It didn't take long for her crying to quiet. Draco popped a passie into her mouth, rubbed his thumb over her head, and rocked his weight back and forth until her wails turned into whimpers, then little murmurs of idle sound as she fell back to sleep.
Someone coughed nearby. Draco looked up and saw the supermarket cashier glaring pointedly at them. "Next."
Harry shifted again and his hair rubbed static into the pillow his head lay on. Draco pushed himself closer, set his head down on Harry's pillow, so close to the back of his head that he could almost imagine the sweet heady scent of Harry's hair. Draco set his hand, palm flat, on the center of Harry's back, and tried to feel Harry's breath and the murmurs of sleep through his hand.
Harry looks over to one of his students, a slight teenage girl with her hair tied up into three ponytails. “Yes, Miss Wimblefon?”
Smell disappeared slowly. One day Draco could vividly experience the crooks and crannies of London at lunch hour, and the next day the burnt coffee on the counter wasn't quite as strong, and then the next the morning paper didn't give off quite the same aroma. Again, Draco only truly realized when he was with Harry.
The students go into a frenzy, jumping up and running from table to table, expressions of shock painted over their faces.
Draco drank more tea first, then took a Calming Potion. He figured it might be from stress, so he took a walk around Muggle London before coming back to his desk. The itch grew to a scrape, then a grind, and then a blindingly painful grating that flayed Draco's throat every time he so much as swallowed or breathed.
What else was there to say? It was one thing to know that you were dying, to know that you would lose all autonomy and sense in a matter of months. It was quite another thing to lean down to a body you knew better than your own, press your mouth to it, expecting the same taste that had always existed there. The drip of salt and sugar, the bitter tang of flesh, sweet in the aftertaste, the familiar give of muscle under teeth. And instead, taste only the absence.
Harry went home with him, clutching his hand and stinking like he hadn't bathed for a week (he hadn't).
"You haven't been in to work for almost two months now," Wilson said, avoiding Draco's eyes by looking around at the walls, the floor, the bookcase. "Harry keeps coming in to get your work. Nice bloke, 'course. But I wanted to make sure everything was okay with you."
Draco politely excused himself from afternoon tea soon after that in order to read his father’s letter privately.
Harry grinned at him and sat down at the kitchen stool next to him. "Well, who is it this morning? Wait, no. Let me guess. The Unspeakable interns."
"Thank you, Mrs. Weasley," Draco had said when she first made him onion soup. By then, Draco had a turnip sized baby inside of him, and it wasn't noticeable that he was pregnant unless you already knew.
alone means "the loss is slow." But when you put them together, it means "the loss of a slow death," which is, effectually, what he is performing on those witches in order to christen himself. He’s using it to drain them of their senses, their lives, vitality, and magic." Wilson pushed himself off the couch and walked between Draco's webs of levitating case information. "Neither acts as a curse on its own," Wilson said. "They must be together. The illness you had," Wilson looked pointedly at Draco, "Was
"Oh," Draco said. Draco considered lying to Wilson, telling him he was fine, that everything was okay. But then, Draco would be on his way to dead in four months. There didn't seem to be much point in lying to his closest colleague. "Actually," Draco said. "I've been ill."
"Draco?" Harry began to sit up, but Draco set a hand over his chest and gently pushed him back down.
Harry nodded and looked around at the early sun glinting off windowpanes and crooked door handles, but Draco was sure he hadn't understood anything Draco had said or anything that was passing around him. Draco didn't mind. He held Harry's hand tightly in one hand, and held Scorpius' weight in the other arm, carrying the three of them along the stone pathways through Godric's Hollow. They passed the church, where Mrs. Hughes was toting her five children with her out the front door. She waved at them, and Draco nodded in return.
“Hello, Miss Wimblefon,” Draco says coolly. “May I ask you what you’re doing out of bed at this hour?”
When it was over, the Healer tried to place the baby in his arms. Draco sat limply and did not look at it. Something tight knotted in between his ribs, and Draco longed to hold out his arms and take the baby and hold it tight. He wanted to love it - he already loved it - but he couldn't look at it.
“Fuck,” Draco murmured. He stroked Potter’s cock just once, and a thin line of white fluid spilled over the head of it. Draco ran the tip of his finger through it, adding it to the slick liquid in his hand. Potter bucked at that, seeking more pressure from his fist, and Draco was tempted to give it to him.
“No,” Draco insisted. “You couldn’t. You haven’t. You haven’t hurt the animals. You haven’t hurt me, much as you might want to.”
He takes a step back, his heart pounding. Of all the possibilities, to be found… to be found is among the worst.
Harry forced himself to unclench his fist again; he didn’t even know when it had re-formed. He tried to make himself breathe, to relax his jaw, to loosen his shoulders, to run through every subtle calming technique they’d learned in training, and a few of the more unusual ones he’d learned from Luna and Hermione. He had to remember that not every little bump in the road was a dark lord. Not every obstacle was a potentially deadly one. Not everything was trying to kill him. The war was over. There was no reason to think he was unsafe.
“Apologies would be more effective, and even those would be quite a stretch. I will not risk my career for you.”
"The way this works is, we got to the contacts on our phone, scroll through at random, and whoever it lands on we call and play a little prank or, if you don't want to call them, just delete them, right out of your life."
Harry turns to look then swivels back around when he realises that he won’t be able to see anything, and is probably making a bit of an arse of himself.
Draco exhaled. He leaned against the side of the stables, straining to hear Potter with the kittens, and breathed deeply until his heart rate settled and he was ready to make for the Manor.
Pansy and Blaise share a puzzled look and Draco suppresses a sigh. Pans is one of the best gossips in wizarding England, knows most everything about everyone. If she can’t figure it out, there’s little hope that anyone will.
Potter’s usually casual demeanour has been wholly replaced. He’s straightened his posture to match Draco’s. He looks taller, chest broad and waist trim, his shoulders solid and straight. Draco is too surprised to object when he offers an elbow.
Because it turns out Draco likes sleeping with Harry—actually sleeping, next to him and on him and occasionally under him—even more than he’d remembered.
“That’s not what I’m saying. I’m just saying that he’s made the choice and it’s his to make. It’s not what I would choose, but I’m not him. Why are you—” she shook her head and started over. “It’s an upsetting thing, but I don’t quite understand why you’re this upset about it.”
“Will we be eating Potter’s records?” Millie leaned back and crossed her legs. “Or will you be clearing the table?”
He walked its borders, trying to get his head around it. It was the size of a normal room, and it didn’t feel any smaller for being set within one of
“Really? All those years you walked around with a stick up your arse, you’d think a hand would slide right in.”
Draco doesn’t respond, but Harry can see his gaze drop to Harry’s hem. He can see the absolute focus, the hint of interest. “Please, Draco. Another button.”
"Your word, not mine," Harry answered, and reached out with the rest of his hand, brushing his knuckles over the front of Malfoy's thigh.
Draco was not interested in the hint of disappointment in Potter’s voice. So much the better if it was inconvenient for him. “Problem?”
“We’re not seventeen.” Harry knew Malfoy was insulting him. At least it sat like an insult, like Malfoy found him lacking. He didn’t want to care any more than it sounded like Malfoy did. But the feeling of Malfoy’s disappointment squirmed uncomfortably in his stomach.
“Hermione.” He reached up to, as far as Draco could tell, remove her hand, though he tempered the gesture with a squeeze. “Is it time?”
“Oh,” Harry exhaled. Had he been holding his breath, Draco wondered? “No, thank you. Bit tired. Afraid it might put me to sleep.”
While I was already fairly certain, Pansy and Blaise – both connoisseurs - have confirmed that my cock’s really quite nice. Pale and full, the head a bit darker than the shaft, just the right size to get the job done without become intimidating, and I’d timed it all so my foreskin was halfway withdrawn.
Draco lifted the bottle and began to pour. “It wasn’t bad, actually.” He held out the glass. “I think you have as much time as you need.”
Phillips pipes up in his most helpful tones. “We’re in Wiltshire, Mr Potter, due southwest of the Ministry by approximately 100 miles.”
“You should’ve been in touch sooner.” Draco stood and began to pace. “We have work on this under review. The implants improve magical ability, as you know. A patient compared them to vision correction—the ability to see, so to speak, was there, but lacked clarity and focus.”
With a shaky breath, Harry slid his hands up Draco’s torso, parting the halves of Draco’s shirt in the process and pushing it off him and onto the floor. Harry’s hands were so warm; Draco felt like he should’ve shivered at the touch, but he was melting into it instead. Draco caught Harry’s mouth again. He wanted to kiss Harry for its own sake and, in equal measure, to have more reason to feel their skin pressed together.
“Another,” I confirm. “I want to see you full of me.” I pull my hand away and slick two fingers. “Just push out when I do it.”
It’s the last of these that inspires him to make for the cabinet, but he pauses with his hand on the door.
“I’ve heard it all before, you know. I’ve thought it all before, far more frequently. I know it every second of every day.”
Potter stops chewing on his bottom lip. “Proud might be a bit strong, but, uh, yeah. Those are mine.”
“The hospital is mixed, too. It’s primarily magical, but wizards are allowed to have Muggle visitors. It’s behind a shop front, like St Mungo’s, but there’s a Muggle-friendly entrance in what looks like a loading dock.”
The candles dimmed again and their crackling faded, and Slytherin’s mark had disappeared, so that Draco and Harry were left, once again, with only the rain to fill the space between them.
“And I’ll have you know, Potter, that while you’ve been hiding from cupboards, I’ve managed to make a functional department. The Vanishing Department
“The Vanishing Department makes every effort to maintain the confidentiality of client requests. In the interest of serving the next client, we ask people who have received their items to leave the premises as soon is possible.”
Malfoy turned with more grace than he had any right to, and Harry might've remarked on the cosmic unfairness of that, if he wasn't completely occupied with taking in the swell of Malfoy's arse under the bottom of his coat. He ran his hands back and over it, feeling the firm muscle and watching, fascinated, as Malfoy tightened and then relaxed into his touch.
“Potter is an influential figure. He’s good with the Wizengamot. Persuasive. They’ll stay awake through his speech even if not through the reading and, frankly, a good number of them will do whatever he says. The MLE has said that his absence is the result of an ongoing mission to find and capture the remaining members of the Diagon Alley Yakuza. There aren’t any—all moved on to the whisky business. But if he’s not back—well, ‘back’—in time to speak at the hearing…” Millie trailed off, shrugging at Draco.
“Hmm.” Draco glances over his shoulder, eying Harry before he continues on. “We will be retrieving books today. They are alphabetical by subject and author. I will start with one end of the alphabet; you will start with the other. Acceptable?”
The office was a logical next step. He stepped over the threshold, cast one last cleaning spell at the washroom, and closed the panel.
He’s left breathless, pulling back only out of necessity, resting his forehead against Draco’s. The exhalation comes, unbidden. “Fuck, I missed you.”
He shot her a look, half expecting Galder to recount a tantrum. Would be out of character for Greg, but Pansy could put the fear of Salazar in anyone. “What kind of troubles?”
"A series of Muggle femoral locking plates, arranged around the knots of the Wand and permanently charmed with micro-scale wizard space so there wouldn't be any visible ridge or other sign of alteration if he were ever captured."
“If there was any of that, any at all, if the outbursts were already there in some form, driven by whatever he’s keeping bottled up, and the Elder Wand amplified them—” He stopped short. “It’s a bit mad-sounding, isn’t it? Reaching?”
He sits back on his heels and strokes Potter, twisting his wrist at the end just as he does for himself.
I’ve just sent off my registration form for the Ministry’s “Weekend of Commemorative Service.” Vomit. But it’s one way to get around this on-campus probation requirement, and Potter’s sure to be there. In addition to posting signs in the common room, he’s been touting it in this week’s
Draco screwed his eyes shut and pushed himself to standing. He tucked himself away. It was as good an excuse as any to look away. The air was cold. His hand was sticky.
“When I let you fuck me, did you think I was being magnanimous? Some sort of arse-first charity project?”
Malfoy threw his hands up in obvious exasperation and turned his back. Harry tried to ignore him completely, even as he started to restlessly tap his finger against his arm. Shutting his eyes, Harry dropped his hand to his jeans and gave himself a cursory sort of palming, trying to fill his mind with pictures of cocks and arses and muscular backs and long, lean legs.
“No!” Harry interrupted. “Fuck. No, that’s—I can see why you thought that, but it’s not what I meant at all.”
He pokes his head up just far enough for his mouth – his flushed, plump mouth – to pull clear of his arm. “Just tell me, okay?”
Draco keeps him at forearm’s length. “Is it pushing it to mention that there are dozens of brooms in need of re-sorting and that that is entirely your fault?”
Safe in the Floo, she rolled her eyes, though her voice stayed entirely professional. “However, Ministry personnel need to speak with you at your earliest possible convenience, and I have been asked to make contact with you as quickly as possible. When are you free to meet?”
“Pansy and Greg’s rooms were completely frozen. Unless Babbity Rabbity hopped through the wards and did it herself, I’d say so.”
“We do.” Draco lifted his apple towards his mouth, but opened his eyes before he took a bite. His Roundway sat in his hands, as mottled and soft as it had been when he picked it up.
