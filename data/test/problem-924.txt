“No way. Really? I thought you went on to be an Auror?”
“It’s hard not to read about you when it seems you are responsible for at least 1/3 of their content.”
“See you.”
He watched as Draco crawled between his legs, kissing every inch of his inner thigh, clearly knowing what he was doing. Draco looked straight into his eyes when he positioned himself and a loud gasp left Harry’s throat when Draco’s mouth wrapped around him.
so probably safe to assume he doesn’t know. And if he doesn’t, how will he learn about it? The prison staff should’ve notified him before it leaked into the papers but Harry wasn’t stupid enough to trust the system. He can’t let him learn from a random paper.
“Oh, I stole that from Hermione. Just don’t tell her.” Harry raised an eyebrow in a silent question. “You know how she was always prepared during potions with those vials and jars and all? I heard her using a spell,
“Alright, I’m just…” he whispered, backing away towards the door. Just as he was shutting it behind him he heard a faint “Goodnight, Harry,” and he felt his heart flutter. What the hell was wrong with him…
“And you went to Azkaban and refuse to say a bad word about anything that happened to you.”
“No. Oh god, no. She doesn’t take lightly to anyone giving her orders. I’ll go. You just… wait here, alright? We’ll have breakfast together.” He reached towards Draco as if to grab his shoulder but he really couldn’t with that hand. Instead, he lightly touched his face, sending him a small smile. “I’ll be right back.”
The room was bigger than it should be possible. Huge floor-length windows were looking out onto the back garden. A king-sized bed, covered in soft-looking throws and pillows was taking up most of the left wall. There was a lit fireplace opposite of the bed with a matching set of armchairs with pillows and thick knitted blankets in front of it.
“What happened?”
“Do you want another one of those?” asked Harry, looking at the empty beer glass in Draco’s hand.
“Oh, no thank you, Tommley. I think we’ll be alright,” he answered and pat his pants for the cloakroom number and handed it to Tommley. “But would you be a dear, go to the Black Snitch and grab my coat from the cloakroom? And my friend’s coat, too,” Harry turned around and at the man who stood silently behind him, looking around the place. “Do you have the number on you?”
And they shook hands.
“Oh god.”
Mad at Ron for leaving the Auror division after the Greyback fiasco. Mad at Hermione for getting involved in the politics. Mad at Ginny for her career. Even mad at Luna for leaving England to look for her creatures. And especially mad at Dumbledore for choosing every aspect of his life for him.
“Incredibly well. How’s your hand?”
“Well… it’s been a day,” admitted Harry, sitting down in the small chair nest to the small table.
Harry shut himself in his bedroom, trying to focus on the lesson plans for the next week but all he could hear were the muffled angry conversations coming from behind the wall and all he could think of was Draco.
“Was I really that bad about the rules?” asked Harry standing next to the sink and drying up the dishes and cutlery. Draco rolled up the sleeves of his shirt and was actually washing the dishes by hand. He really did not want to go home yet and so he postponed the inevitable.
The house was warm and quiet. Yellow light from the lamp sitting on the table next to the door made everything feel like a cosy, autumn evening.
“Tommley!” Harry called out and a second later he heard the snap of the Elf’s magic behind him. “Be a dear and clean up the study. I need to get ready for that lunch with Draco.”
“I could stay and help,” proposed Draco, placing two teacups next to the huge plate of sandwiches and sitting in the other armchair across Harry. “Get you dressed and fed and whatnot.”
“Right. I’ll go ask Tommley to go and bring a healer.”
“Alright. I’ll wait outside, then,” Harry’s lips touched the top of Draco’s head, his hand holding his face gently.
“I like your attitude,” said Draco matter-of-factly when another knock came from the door.
“To the papzz,” chimed Harry and they clinked their glasses. Another silent pause fell over them and was interrupted by a loud snap of apparition. Tommley walked into the living room, bowed low and screeched:
“Sure. I’ll be right back. Enjoy your drinks, boys.”
?” asked Draco, trailing circles and playing with the hair on Harry’s chest. “Cleaning charms, warm blankets and cold drinks?”
“What?”
“Yeah. We’re meeting after work. He’s definitely not dead.”
Draco finished his drink, left some cash for the barman hoping it was enough and followed Harry. When he walked through the awning to the room where everyone danced he noticed Harry dancing in the middle with people swaying around him. He looked happy. Jumping to the beat of the music, not caring about a thing Harry Potter looked free.
“Talk to me about something. Tell me how did you get to work for the Aurors.”
“Oh… Right.“ Harry muttered.
“I thinks it looks great,” she chirped.
“Alright, my turn. He was my friend first, you know?” said Ron, pushing through the group.
To Harry’s surprise, Draco took the bottle under his arm without a question and marched out of the room behind him. They climbed the stairs as quietly as two drunk men could possibly be, walked through the corridor and to Harry’s bedroom door.
Wednesday, March 8
“Actually, I do,” he said, trying to overpower the sound of the music. He didn’t need to. Draco heard him loud and clear. “Can you do my sleeve? It’s so fucking hot in here.”
“Well… yes and no. His
“I really screwed you over, didn’t I?” asked Draco, holding up Harry’s wand and placing it his palm.
“Don’t faint on me, Harry. Talk to me,” said Draco, trying to get it over with as quickly as possible but his fingers were fumbling.
“Please do.”
Draco thought about the sweater again. Does Harry really not want it back or he just doesn’t want to see him again? Or maybe Harry is just being polite and he should give it back? He is going to overthink the shit out of it as he always does.
The doorbell chimed and the smell of herbs hit him hard once he entered the room. Draco’s head instinctively moved towards the sound, the look of surprise painted on his face quickly changing into a shy smile. Harry waved at him uncertain.
“No, I’ll actually go with some shots. I don’t know why I ordered a beer. It’s so nasty.”
“Harry Potter playing by the rules? No way,” laughed Draco.
Reality.
“It’s fine, Harry. I’ll see you another time,” he answered with a sad smile, backing away quietly.
He finally had a moment to just
“Sorry?” replied Harry.
“Yeah, you know what they say. Don’t apply logic to magic.”
“I forgave you a long time ago, Draco,” he whispered, closing his eyes. A pressure lifted from his chest. He did forgive Draco years ago but saying it out loud to the man in question felt like the weight that has been strapped to his heart disappeared. He kissed the top of the man’s head, breathing in his smell, feeling the sleep taking hold of his body. “Goodnight, Draco.”
“You killed fucking Voldemort with it. I can’t take it.”
“That we’re not gonna sleep with each other? Pretty sure,” snorted Draco, fixing the sleeve of his shirt.
Harry was wondering if it’s a date when another message buzzed his phone awake.
Draco got up, feeling like something was stolen from him. He grabbed Harry’s glasses, placing them back in their rightful place again. And he again got lost in those green eyes.
“Bullshit. It’s yours. And you can feel it is yours, can’t you? Come on, try it.” Harry encouraged him.
Now he only had to make Ron and Hermione come over for dinner too.
He touched her hands, sending her a small smile when she looked at him.
“So what happened to it?” asked Draco, looking straight into his stew as if it had the answer to his question.
“Indeed. Sorry about that. They somehow always find me.”
“Um… well, actually… Sure. Thank you.”
“Oh Harry…” he said, helping him reach the landing of the first floor. At this point Harry was basically hanging over Draco’s shoulders. Draco was not complaining but this was not how he imagined this evening going. He looked at the state of Harry’s clothing. The blood was everywhere. “We’ll need to take those clothes off.”
“I mean, I’m not complaining either. She just reminds me of Umbridge.”
“Thanks for your help,” said Harry when Draco turned around, now facing him, the shy light of the fireplace dancing on his face.
Draco shook his head, chuckling under his breath.
“I’d like that,” admitted Draco, and in a rare spark of confidence placed a small kiss on Harry’s unshaved cheek. “See you soon then.”
It took hours to arrange Narcissa’s travel through the Floo network. The British side was not sure about letting an ex-convict back into country after they’ve let her leave all those years ago. Finally, just after 10pm, after countless calls and using his full name way too many times she stood in Harry’s Floo fireplace on the first floor of his house, all in black with only a small clutch bag in her hand. Draco helped her get out of the fireplace.
“Yes?”
“You were saying.”
“Yeah, what the hell actually happened in there?” asked Draco, getting into a more comfortable position in the armchair and nursing his glass of rum.
Harry and Draco looked at each other funnily.
“So, Mr. Potter, why are you in my shop?” she asked, placing the cup of tea in front of him. Her eyes were warm and motherly but her face could have been described as stern.
They sat in silence, actively trying to avoid each other’s gazes. Draco was stirring the leftover stew in his bowl, clinking the spoon over the ceramic as he went in circles.
“I don’t know, Potter. I don’t know. Are you good? After everything” asked Malfoy, looking now straight at Harry but his gaze was soft, kind of defeated. Sad.
“Harry?” Draco’s voice was quiet, as if he wasn’t sure if Harry was still up.
“If you’re alright with it. I promise to forget that,” said Harry with his eyes closed, his face still three tones too white for him. He tried to cover his eyes with his hand which ended up with a painful gasp and a careful move of the arm down to his chest. “Well, that bloody hurt.”
“We should probably change the bandages,” he said, quietly, trying not to touch the touchy subject.
It was after midnight when Harry heard a knock to his bedroom door. He got up from the desk where the untouched lesson plans laid and almost run through the room, opening the door to Draco looking exhausted and dishevelled.
“Ah yes, I read all about you in the newspapers.”
“But apparently tonight the papzz were after you. How is that?”
“So…” started Harry. “How was Azkaban?”
“Well… yeah,” answered Draco. “Can you let me leave now?”
“So are you, Harry. That ass of yours makes me dizzy,” he laughed, turning on his back. “For real though, you were great. It was great.”
bad,” Harry let out a sad laugh. “And yet he is considered a hero.”
“Language, Harry,” he said but handed him the newspaper.
“We sure do,” she said, scribbling the order on the paper. “Black or with milk?”
They’ve known each other since Astoria started working in his division 4 years ago. He quickly picked up on her smarts and instinct and she climbed the steps of career even faster than him which was impressive enough. She was the one to actually capture Greyback the year before, after Harry was hospitalised and he has never been prouder of one of his subordinates.
Harry’s hand reached out to touch Draco’s shoulder before he even thought about it.
“You are alright,” he whispered, running his thumb over the nape of Draco’s neck.
“So… would you like to join me for a drink?” asked Harry not sure of the proper way to deal with a situation like this. Usually, his one night stands are not this complicated. The man looked at the door and raised an eyebrow.
“I mean, sure,” said the man, smirking and joining Harry at the door. He held the door for Harry and motioned for him to go first. “After you.”
“No, it’s lovely. Thanks,” said Harry as he helped Draco get off his coat.
“Want to grab some food tomorrow?” asked Draco, turning to his side and cuddling into Harry’s pillow, face flushed pink.
“Relax, Harry,” Draco said, buttoning up his shirt back. “I was literally trying to kill you back then. Fair game.”
Downstairs, Tommley was preparing a mountain of pancakes and Pipps was setting the dining room table when Harry walked through the kitchen door yawning and stretching.
“How’s your hand?”
“Find you? I was pretty sure they were after me,” he whispered, trailing his finger up Harry’s arm and to his neck, leaving a hot trace of his touch behind.
“The healer will come by in the afternoon. Until then I’ll just have to survive,” said Harry looking behind his shoulder at the tall lean figure.
“HA! I’ve got it!” shouted Harry, throwing Draco out of the sweet tranquillity only a drunk person on the verge of being asleep can experience. Maybe it was time to cut himself off.
Behind Ron and Hermione stood Ginny. Beautiful as always. Her fiery hair sliding over the cream winter coat and her hand entangled with Luna’s who just looked beaming, with her almost white hair put up in a high knot.
While he was filling the glass at the bar, Harry could feel the grey eyes on his back, scanning his body and honestly, it felt rather nice. He assumed they dropped the double House Elf topic for now.
. I was so mad she came up with that. Probably because that was ingenious and I was a jealous little brat.”
“Come on, I’ll get you to bed,” proposed Draco, slowly getting up. His legs were cramped from the uncomfortable position they’ve been in.
“Of course I’m still up for it,” said Harry, matching his stride to Draco’s. “I’ll cast a water resistant spell after we’re out of sight, no worries,” he whispered into Draco’s ear and winked as they started to walk down the street.
“Thanks.” He tried to take his wand but that was just as useless.
They fell silent again. Harry suddenly didn’t feel like eating and he put down his fork. He remembered all the fucked up things that happened between the two of them. From the very first time they’ve met they couldn’t be more opposite. They were raised with two very different set of believes, in two very different families. And as the years progressed the things they’ve done to each other progressed from harmless childish banter to
“Today?”
“No, Potter. Thanks. I know my way. I’ll get a cab,” he reached for the doorknob but Harry quickly stood between him and the door. “You are being really weird right now, Potter.”
“They usually don’t work, George, just to manage your expectations.”
“No way!” gasped Harry, his mouth ajar in surprise.
The thing was Draco didn’t really want to leave. He wanted to stay there, in the warm room, with Harry. He didn’t want to go back. He didn’t like his apartment, especially at night when it truly felt empty. And he liked the quiet of this room. He liked the calm light and sound of the fireplace. And he liked Harry’s presence.
“Even Goyle.”
“I think it’s the magic,” he answered with a shadow of a laugh. “How strong is that spell, man?”
Draco looked down. The black shirt that Harry was wearing began to stick to him in the most obscene way. He nodded and started rolling up Harry’s sleave revealing a strong, tan arm.
“Draco…” sighed Harry, closing his palm around Draco’s and making him look up. His teary eyes were filled with sadness and anger.
“You can bullshit yourself, captain, but not me. What is going on?” she asked in a sharp whisper that made Greggs turn his head around to send them side-eyed look of disapproval.
“Well, as long as he’s not in trouble.”
“I just assumed that you’ve changed and you’re not the snarky little bitch you were back in school.”
He sighed happily into a pillow when he heard the door opening. Harry, wearing a robe that was dangerously close to coming undone was floating a tray with a glass jug full of tea with slices of lemons bobbing around on the top. The tray landed in the middle of the bed and Draco propped himself on an elbow, reaching for a glass to pour some for Harry. He looked at the other man sliding the robe off his bare shoulders and then hanging in on a hook on the door, naked again. Draco could feel his fase blushing as Harry slipped under the covers, his boyish smile permanently plastered on his face as he took the glass from Draco’s hand.
“Alright.”
“You are full of surprises,” said Harry, genuinely impressed sipping on the drink. “It’s delicious. Thank you.”
“No, thank you. Tea if I may ask,” said Draco to which Tommley snapped her thin fingers and a cup of steaming tea appeared on the table. “Thank you, Tommley.”
“Yes?”
“Yeah?” asked Harry, taking up the challenge like the good Gryffindor that he is and placing a kiss under the man’s ear. “Try me.”
He tried not to look at Harry’s body. It felt like breaking the crumbs of trust they somehow managed to create. Instead, he looked around the room in search a blanket of some sorts. He found one hung over one of the armchairs. It was a thick, green, woollen thing with small yellow leaves woven into it. He took it quietly along with one of the pillows from the chair and went back to the bed where Harry looked like he was already sleeping. Draco placed the fabric over him and tucked in the sides.
He finally took out his wand and pointed it at Harry’s hand. He whispered
The morning came sooner than he’d have liked. The windows let in way too much light and he covered his eyes with his arm. His mouth left like somebody poured half of the Sahara desert into it.
“What? No! He’s been out for like a month already. What the hell are you talking about, Neville?” The confusion that Neville was emanating apparently spread to Harry and he did not like it.
“Yeah.”
“I’ll do my best. Thanks.”
“Still alive,” he said quietly, raising his hand a bit.
Draco rolled onto his stomach, his legs still shaking from the ferocity of the night. Harry actually went downstairs to get them something to drink and Draco couldn’t stop smiling to himself. It didn’t feel like a one night stand. His previous encounters were widely different. More of a touch and go kind of deal. He usually wouldn’t be laying in bed, waiting for a glass of chilled beverage and pillow talk. But here he was.
“I can’t take it, Potter,” said Draco, rolling the want between his thumbs and pointers.
“Can you get me my robe? I wouldn’t want to flash you before breakfast.”
“I said I’m sorry,” he said and held out his hand to help the stranger get up, which was risky considering how much alcohol was swooshing in his brain right now, but the man took his hand and stood up. He fixed his dark hair that was falling over his face and shook his trousers off in a futile attempt at cleaning them.
“So… shall we move to the living room for that drink I promised?” asked Harry awkwardly messing up his damp hair and smiling at the stranger. Tommley was always tense when he brough home anyone. “What would you like?”
“Whatever you feel like.”
“Alright. Wasn’t that hard, was it?”
“Oh fuck. Oh shi- I’m sorry,” gasped Draco in panic after he grasped what had just happened. He looked at the hand Harry was holding up, a stream of red running down the forearm and into the cuff of the white sleeve.
“Huh?” Harry was surprised at the sudden change of the subject. “Oh, yeah. Everything is back to normal. Thank you for asking.”
He closed his eyes and let Draco undress him completely, feeling the small wet kisses all over his abdomen. He gasped lightly and let his head fall back, when Draco cupped his erection and started trailing his tongue on the side of it. He looked down at Draco’s pale face illuminated only by the light of the fire. His thoughts were a mess.
am ridiculous?” laughed definitely-not-Malfoy. “You don’t look even remotely like him. He was all tan and broody and… you know, had that scar.”
“It’s about your father. He’s… um…” Harry took out the newspaper of his jacket. Draco’s face went still and the colour drained from it when he read the title and looked at the picture. Even the colour from his lips disappeared. He glanced at Harry in shock. “You didn’t seem to be aware of it… I’m so sorry, Draco.”
The club was crowded, as was expected. They all walked straight to the cloakroom and while the other’s were fine with leaving their wands with their coats Harry quickly put it in the wandholder on his thigh.
He sighed, picked a barstool and ordered a beer looking out of the window. The weather outside was atrocious. What started out as a little drizzle turned into full on storm making the streets empty if not for the occasional car slicing the darkness in half with its lights. He could barely see through the heavy waves of rain smashing against the window but the sound soothed him. It mixed nicely with the beat of the music seeping through the speakers in the next room and the murmur of conversations of people around him.
And that’s why he has to use this cheeky little charmed door.
I should have gone for the Chihuahua,” he muttered to himself. Unfortunately, not only did William hear that offensive remark, he also most certainly didn’t appreciate it. He growled and stamped up the hill with renewed vigour. Draco was so busy trying not to get his arm torn off that he didn’t register the blur of gold careening down the hill and right in his direction. William however, did. He yelped in delight and bolted forward.
Harry. Never. You’re our son and we
Harry laughed again and kissed his forehead. “I grabbed it when I was all mad at you and storming out. I just had this feeling I’d need it.”
“Salazar help us, he’s worse than Granger,” Blaise whispered to Pansy.
“You know,” he whispered in Draco ear and making him shiver. “I’m really glad I ran into you today.”
“I can’t,” Granger said, sounding firmer now. “But Harry can.” She shook her head and sighed. “Malfoy, I realise you’ve been dealing with a lot this year, but surely you’ve noticed that Harry likes you? He likes you enough to want to
want me to make a meal out of whatever poor bastard got in your way?” the vampire asked with exaggerated innocence. He grinned sharply, clearly enjoying every bit of Father’s disgust. “You’ll have to excuse my uncouth deportment,
Godric nuzzled affectionately at Salazar before bounding over and licking Draco’s hand. He rolled his eyes and indulged the mutt with a petting. “Oh, sure,” he drawled. “I get you a girlfriend and suddenly I’m the best thing since old chewed up slippers, yeah?”
It’s important.”
Understandably, this didn’t do much to reassure James. “So he’s a Slytherin, he’s Lucius Malfoy’s son and he hexed my kid,” he listed off dryly. “Remind me, why are we letting this boy in the house again?”
Well, that was that. He had been thwarted again. Draco retreated to the fireplace in shameful defeat. But just before he flooed off, he noticed the smug, victorious look in Godric’s eyes. Draco pursed his lips. Oh, he would be back alright. But this time, he would be prepared.
Potter reached out for his hand. His fingers wrapped around Draco’s wrist, pulling him closer. Draco followed without protest— momentarily distracted by the flash of anticipation in Potter’s green eyes— and then he remembered why he was still so upset and promptly pushed Potter away.
Granger sighed heavily and put the stirrer down. “You know what.”
“By Merlin, it might work,” Draco murmured.

milked that incident with the hippogriff for all it was worth.
“Draco, stop it!” Harry snapped. He looked frustrated and upset and it was all Draco could do not to Disapparate on the spot, wards be damned. “I just want to figure this out, okay? Please just talk to me.”
Draco grumbled and groused as he hoisted Hugo in his arms, bouncing him a bit like he’d seen Harry do. Hugo calmed down eventually. He sniffed and hid in Draco’s shoulder, holding on to him with chubby fists. Draco swallowed and patted his back gently. He was just such a

so I can…”
Christ, I can’t say that enough. You watch the show then?”
“You don’t know what you’re asking for.” Strong hands haul him up until he’s staring into hard, green eyes. “Did you think I chose this, Draco? That I would condemn...” Harry’s lips pull into a tight line. “I didn’t ‘change’. I was Turned against my will.”
“Draco.”
“I had a book on Mythical Creatures when I was younger. Before I came here,” he explained. “It had pictures of mermaids. But you’re prettier than all of them put together.”
“Well, that was your first mistake,” Granger retorted. “I always connect the dots. And as for Harry, he never listens to a word I say when it’s about studying. I’m pretty sure he and Ron learned to tune me out in Second Year.” She grinned ruefully and handed him a steaming cup of tea — yet another thing the Room had seen fit to provide. “Not one of your best plans, Malfoy.”
“Harry...oh Merlin...please, just...
“Camera!” Draco blurted out. Harry raised an amused eyebrow at his outburst and Draco suppressed a groan. Really, he wished he could kick himself. “I mean, I see you have a camera,” he amended quickly.
James looked like a little boy just then, with his messy hair and his eyes glistening with unshed tears— just like that time when he was six and had tripped and scraped his knee, when he hadn’t thought twice about running to Draco, wanting him to make it better. He managed a hitched sob and dropped his gaze, apparently unable to look Draco in the eye anymore.
come home. Can you do that? Can you remember that for me?”
“Not until you hear me out,” Draco replied firmly.
Gifts that would assuredly result in an awkward conversation with the Aurors, should they ever have reason to visit Malfoy Manor. Of course, Father was careful to
“For you or Teddy?” Potter asked innocently.
“Harry,” Draco replied softly. He turned around to face the man, taking in the familiar sight of his messy hair and warm, green eyes. Harry’s robes were askew and his Firebolt was propped against a nearby tree. He had obviously been flying when Draco arrived.
Thank Merlin...
The good news is there's all of eternity to make up for lost time.
“Oh, I don’t know!” Granger hissed back. “
“Not really, no.” Harry dropped his fork with a clatter and turned to glare accusingly at him. “I rather think you said it all this morning, don’t you?”
“As I was saying,” Theo continued firmly. “Distraction was a far more effective method. All they had to do was send in the Honey Trap— usually, a beautiful, seductive woman. When the guards were adequately distracted, they would sneak in and launch an offensive.”
The Friar seemed less than impressed. “My word, not the fifty-seventh one, surely?” he muttered. But then he relented with a sigh. “Very well, be a good chap and check the corridor then. I’ll take a look in the...”
Granger removed her face from her hands. “Potion,” she reminded him unhappily. Then she went back to hiding.
him stay here with him, he probably would have. Perhaps it was a good thing the fireplace wasn’t primed for travel; he’d embarrassed himself enough for one night. Besides, he did want to see Dad. Really bad. So James nodded grudgingly and settled back to wait as Father disappeared from his green-tinted view.
Being in the Room of Requirement again brought about a lot of mixed feelings. On one hand, this was the safest place he could be right now. The Room wouldn’t let anyone in so long as it was in use. On the other hand, it was the one place in this castle where his memories of Harry were the most...poignant. So many nights, so many stolen moments...all gone now. Being here with Granger was a headspin all on its own and if that wasn’t enough, the Room had chosen to equip them with a few things that were clearly meant for children — a selection of books from his childhood, a toy broomstick, a rocking horse.
Marina sighed and nodded. It was kind of him to notice.
“It’s not a date!” Harry exclaimed impatiently. “We’re just two friends catching up. Besides, this is Draco’s first time watching a movie and I want it to be fun for him. Friends do that, you know.”
“Well, you’ll be happy to know you didn’t,” Draco replied coolly. “When you fell off your broom— a good twenty feet, by the way— Albus dove and tried to catch you. Of course by the time he made it to your side, you were in a hole in the ground with shattered ribs and a dislocated shoulder, but that’s hardly important. Rest assured, he didn’t catch the snitch so really, there’s
“Mm hm,” Harry replied noncommittally. He leaned in again and brushed their lips together, eliciting a soft hum from Draco. “Do you want to play now?”
Oh. Oh, good. James held his breath, praying they would move on soon. Another inch to the right and the Friar would surely spot him.
“Oh, yes he is!” Potter countered. “I invited him and
“I can’t,” Harry said firmly. “I...I can’t do this anymore, Draco. It’s bloody awful and it hurts and somehow, I’m always left wondering what I did wrong. So, no. I’m sorry but this is what you wanted, right?”
“I can’t!” Draco burst out. Why didn’t she understand? “I’ve tried, Granger. Everytime I get close I either freeze up or say something completely ridiculous! I
Harry grinned and wrapped an arm around him. “Still,” he said softly. “It could be worse.”
“Mr. Potter?”
Draco swallowed, feeling off-kilter all over again. “I hope you do,” he murmured quietly. “But...but you might change your mind, you know.”
“You want your toys?” Draco repeated meaningfully. He did his best to enunciate and speak full sentences around Teddy. Of course, he was too young just yet, but all the books said children were like sponges at this age. He wondered if Potter had read any child-rearing books before taking this up. Draco snorted at the thought. Far more likely, he was going on instinct, like he did with everything else.
The dark haired boy looked around the bathroom, clearly taken aback by the sheer size of it. The mermaid sniffed in disdain. Her blond was
“I’m sorry.” Draco sighed softly and pulled James into his arms again. “I know it’s hard Jamie, but actions have consequences and unfortunately Dad and I have let yours slide for too long. This needs to happen and you know it.”
“I would imagine not. And you wouldn’t mention the jar of Floo Powder right behind the gargoyle statue either, would you?” the Friar added, nodding along. “That would be most irresponsible. Now perhaps we should head to the fifth floor? I do believe that’s Peeves playing dominoes with the suits of armour again.”
Hiding? This time, Draco blinked. What on earth was Albus hiding from?
It was Theo who raised a tentative hand. “I thought we agreed on a name change at the last meeting?”
“I…” His throat was closing up. Panic crept up on him, blurring the edges of his vision. “Harry, I-I’m…”
in Herbology?”
It took the bloke a second to figure out he was being glared daggers at. Eventually he extricated himself from his book and blinked at Draco. His brow furrowed and vivid green eyes narrowed in confusion. “Can I help you?”
“Well,” Potter began, sounding rather uncomfortable. “I hadn’t really planned for a big party. I mean, there’s not a lot of food or...”
talk with him?
“I’m keeping you, aren’t I?”
“Just not enough to admit that this was a date,” Draco contributed.

practiced smile on Lily. Her eyes lit up, and so did Harry’s. “If it’s not too forward, I brought a little something for your table.” James bit back on a scoff as Malfoy produced a massive bouquet of Madonna Lilies and offered them to…oh right, lilies for Lily.
Right, none of that.
Potter rolled his eyes but obliged without protest. “Thank you. Cocoa?”
“Oh, Draco.” Harry pulled him closer, carding a careful hand through his hair and pressing a kiss to his head. “Please tell me you know different now. Please tell me you know that I would never, ever leave you. Both of you.”
A hand wrapped around his, jerking him out of his thoughts. Draco started and looked up. Harry smiled reassuringly and pressed a gentle kiss to his fingers.
And he knew that because this time, he wasn’t relying on
Sirius made a wibbly-wobbly gesture with his hands before succumbing to a disinterested shrug. “Meh.”
mattered now except for the baby growing inside him. But it didn’t make him feel any less weary. He was facing an uphill battle on all fronts, and it started today. Pomfrey hadn’t minced words with him.
“Potter,” Draco replied, just as uneasily.
“Sasha,
Lucius goes limp in his grasp.
doing up so late, little mermaid?”
“Jamie. What’s wrong? Are you...”
“Draco?” Harry came forward, looking justifiably alarmed as Draco doubled over. “What the...what’s wrong?!”
Bloody vultures.
Potter smiled back and his fingers brushed against Draco’s. “At least,” he replied, looking endearingly bashful after all his bravado. “And...now I have time to get to know you better.”
implied.
“It’s just for a few hours, Draco,” Harry implored, hoisting Hugo Weasley on his shoulder. “I’ll be back in two hours, tops. You
The thought was depressing enough to take the wind out of his sails. It was one thing for Potter to be upset but the idea of him
“Father?”
“I’ve got it,” Draco muttered, raising his wand to perform a Slicing Spell. His wand sputtered and flickered in his grasp, and then suddenly their table was covered in mounds of bitter root. Draco winced and several students cast puzzled glances in their direction.

Now though, faced with the possibility of
would I have done if something had happened to you?”
“Like we would have it any other way,” Father said with a smile.
“Potter, I need to talk to you. Right now.”
Draco’s answering glare could very well have burned her to ashes. She seemed to reach some kind of private consensus and she turned to Slughorn. “We do, Professor. Please, it’s very urgent.”
have those scones.”
Draco deserves better. His life will never truly be his with
Pomfrey’s delicate cough brought him back to the present. Oh good, it was almost over. Draco sat up, wincing a bit as his stomach spasmed again. It was nothing he couldn’t handle but the discomfort was persistent enough to concern him at this point. It had started a couple weeks ago. He’d hoped that it would subside on its own but when it didn’t...well, he didn’t want to sound paranoid but the possibility of someone tampering with his meals couldn’t be ruled out. His return to Hogwarts for the Eighth Year had been greeted with a marked lack of hostility so far — thanks in large part to a strongly worded speech by Headmistress McGonagall (and Merlin, didn’t that still sound strange) — but that didn’t mean all was forgiven.
“No!” he scolded disapprovingly.
And it doesn’t matter. All of a sudden, Harry has a whole other list of priorities and he’s eager to get to them.
Draco gathered him up at once, holding him close. James held on with a death grip, anchoring himself to Draco as the tears flowed on and on.
Potter chuckled and shook his head. “I’m not surprised. He’s always asking for you when he’s here.”
Lily was practically doubled over with laughter by this point. It took her a good two minutes to compose herself, and by the time she did, two brooms were easily spotted in the sky, swooping and sailing towards a golden ball glinting in the moonlight.
“Your petty politics mean nothing to me,” the vampire drawled, studying the dregs of wine with a bored expression. “Regardless, consider it done. Same terms as always.”
Amusingly enough, it seemed he was the prey this time.
His eyes fluttered shut. The exhaustion took him over and he curled into the covers. Tomorrow, he reflected tiredly, was going to be...eventful. Pomfrey would be expecting him and he could only hope she meant what she said about helping him. He-
“I wasn’t
How could it be ‘finished’ if half of it didn’t work right?
Granger’s fists hit the table, surprising everyone including herself. “Sorry,” she muttered, flushing furiously as the table stared. Harry blinked at her in confusion but she gathered herself and leaned over a perplexed Weasley to hiss at him. “Listen to him,” she ordered. “This is important!”
Potter’s invitation hadn’t exactly been specific but for Draco to assume that the man had asked him out on a date! Of course Potter had meant an evening with a friend! Why in the world would he even consider someone like Draco when he could have anyone he wanted?
“Right,” Ron agreed, nodding along. “Say, Harry, if this is just a friendly get together kind of thing, can Hermione and I come?”
for these things...”
Too much. It was just too much. He couldn’t compartmentalise anymore, not when everything was coming at him at once. First Potter, now this! Draco made a snap decision and honestly, at this point, he didn’t even care what the consequences were. He shook her off and raised his hand.
Draco suppressed a smirk and stayed put, waiting until James was fast asleep. Then he disentangled himself, pressed a kiss to the child’s forehead and took his leave.
He was aware of Albus watching his every move, but Draco just kept at it. Still, when he heard little feet pattering towards him and a small, gloved hand reached for the carrot, he smiled.
Draco barely suppressed a flinch. To hear his Father being addressed in a manner so flagrantly disrespectful... he should be outraged. Instead, the thrill of anticipation flared deep inside him. He had to dig his nails into his forearm to ground himself.
Potter, to his credit, did seem disappointed by his refusal. But he nodded and gave Draco another soft smile. “Alright. Talk later, then?”
“Nothing.”
“I’ll be back tomorrow,” he mumbled, turning away before she could say anything else. And with that, he fled the Hospital Wing, not daring to look back.
was what he needed right now. At this rate, the entire castle would be shunning him by the end of the week.
“You do it,” Theo grumbled, trudging off in the other direction. “I’m late for my SPEW meeting.”
But right now? Creeping through a dark corridor in the middle of the night, all he wanted was to go
“I have something for you.”
He needed to hear what was going on in there.
...and knocked the alarm clock over.
“Does this wine look right to you?” Lily asked, cocking her head and frowning at the bubbling, frothy mess on the stove-top. “Alice said to…you know, never mind. I’ll just throw in some more star anise, I’m sure it’ll be fine.”
It was a board, that much he was certain off. Wooden, stuck to a wall, placed at about Teddy’s height. So it was definitely meant for him. But what really caught Draco’s eye was the strange collection of bits and pieces attached to the board. They were mostly Muggle odds and ends. Some of them were just metal bolts and latches for doors. Just...stuck to the board, seemingly without purpose. Draco pulled one to test it. The latch opened as he slid it and then shut when he slid it back. It didn’t open or close anything, so it was utterly devoid of function. And that wasn’t even half of it.
“But I remember...”
Potter’s brow drew down in a thoughtful frown. “Is that so?” he contested, crossing his paws—
…well, you know.”
Draco nods. He understands. “Because you’re not him, Harry. You never were.” He cups Harry’s face in his hands, presses another kiss to his lips and tries not to let his heart soar too high when Harry responds. “I want you to know that I choose this. I want an eternity with
“Get out,” he sneers. “Both of you. Tell the boy he’s no son of mine.”
Harry just favoured him with another infuriating, reassuring smile. “I’ll be back in no time,” he promised. “You’ll be just fine, I promise.”
It hurt to hear it. Somehow, knowing that Harry wanted this, some version of this — it just made it worse. “Not with me,” Draco murmured. He drew his knees up to his chest. He wasn’t angry anymore, just sad. Sad for himself, and the baby. “You can’t tell me he wants
Draco alighted, still flush and thrumming with energy. His legs felt wobbly under him and he yelped as he nearly stumbled. Harry reached out and caught him before he could hit the ground.
But Harry was already snoring again, deep in sleep.
It was only a few moments later that he heard dual footsteps returning to the fireplace. Then Dad was crouching to peer at him, worried and confused and running an agitated hand through his messy, black hair.
be your whore! I’ll kill the boy before I let him defile my House like...”
Draco smirked and released his grip. The Snitch snapped up its bid for freedom and was gone in the blink of an eye. “Oops,” he drawled. “Clumsy me.”
He reminded himself that it didn’t matter.
Wait. Wait...what?
Vampirism has only heightened Draco’s flair for the dramatic.
“They’re beautiful,” Lily exclaimed in delight. “Oh Draco, you shouldn’t have!”
That…wasn’t the worst idea, actually. Didn’t Padfoot’s fright of a cousin end up with Lucius Malfoy? That meant Draco was probably his second cousin. Or nephew. Or something. If the boy
“Good. And I’ll get back to my recipe.”
Yes, a Kneazle,” he nodded hastily, nearly displacing his head again. “Quite right, Friar. Clearly nothing worth bothering the Prefects with.”
He looked up. Granger hovered anxiously around him, arms crossed and expression uncertain. She didn’t look like she knew what to do, which was probably a first for her.
James had a...way with Harry. Perhaps it was because he was their first born. Perhaps it was because he was a Gryffindor and they were, in some ways almost the same person. Perhaps they had bonded over their shared love for those abysmal Cannons; Draco didn’t know and he didn’t care. The fact remained that Harry had a bit of a blind spot where their eldest was concerned.
“Oh hello,” he said, smiling at her. “I didn’t realize someone was here.”
“Slytherin’s Historic Annual Gag-fest, of course,” Draco elaborated with a put upon sigh. Theo dissolved in a heap of muttering in his chair. Draco ignored him. “Honestly, am I the only one who reads the notices on the meeting board?”
Draco’s world tilted on its axis. The room swam before his eyes. He was only vaguely aware of a firm hand on his shoulder and a soothing voice telling him to breathe. Then a vial was being pressed into his hands and he downed it without thinking twice. The grassy taste of Calming Draught hit his throat and his vision cleared immediately.
“Mhm.” James sniffed, even as a reluctant smile broke out on his face. “I’ll try.”
When he spoke again, his voice was a low, livid hiss. “You mean to tell me that you put your family through four hours of sheer hell because of a bet with a
“Potter, you’re not listening.” Draco groaned inwardly, even though something in his chest tumbled with newfound excitement. “That sounds nice but I really,
“No problem,” Harry replied. “Like I said, you
“I. Am.
Harry turned to him slowly. There was real, genuine fear in his eyes. “Draco,
Draco scoffed. “I told you several times. It’s not my fault you’re obtuse.”
“Jamie,” Father spoke up softly when he still couldn’t bring himself to say anything. “You’re really starting to worry me.”
All over Harry Potter’s shoes.
James did know. Sirius’s younger brother was notoriously anti-social. Their eventual reconciliation hadn’t done much to soften him up. Allegedly, Teddy was the only one who could get a half-smile out of the dour man. If even
Draco nodded. He wasn’t sure he could do anything else, really.
Potter wasn’t having any of it. “Malfoy!” he snapped, shaking Draco frantically. “Are you okay? Malfoy, talk to me! Say something!”
He just needed to get to the Owlery.
Longbottom’s look was stern and reproachful. “Harry seems to think differently. Really, Seamus, there are boundaries.”

) and joined Theo as he made a harried beeline for the exit.
“How do you feel?” Harry asked, taking his hand again.
“Oh Godric!” Thomas shrieked again. “It’s happening! She’s a goner!”
“Hello, little Malfoy. My, how you’ve
Draco cleared his throat, smoothed down his robes and took an authoritative stand at the podium. He cast a discreet
The bloke however, just looked amused. “Even though I paid for them?” he prodded. He was smiling now, his eyes sparkling with amusement.
Was it?
Al heaved a sigh of relief and settled in again. Draco smiled and bussed a kiss to his head, before turning out the lights and shutting the door with a soft click.
“I’m Harry,” the bloke said, holding out his hand. “Harry Potter.”
“I am
“So what are you waiting for, an engraved invitation? Get over here, son!”
“Oh believe me, I can guess,” Draco snapped. “This hasn’t been a picnic for me either, Granger. For your information, it’s been a right mess. I feel like I’m constantly on the verge of a panic attack. I’m stressed, I can’t cast properly, I’m always hungry or tired or both! And between telling him and not telling him and not being
“Granger and I need to visit the library,” Draco lied, trying to keep his voice steady. He only partially succeeded. “Right now.”
pregnant
“Tomorrow,” he murmured, as he drifted off. “We’ll tell Potter tomorrow.”
All things considered, it was a nice night. James sat on the porch of Godric’s Hollow, alone with his thoughts. The small wireless he’d pilfered from the living room crackled cheerfully beside him. The Semi-Finals were tonight and he had his money on Puddlemere.
“Shh! Draco, shh! They’ve spotted the Snitch!”
Draco flushed, a little embarrassed by his evidently obvious fretting. Maybe the hormones were finally catching up to him.
Harry smiled and stroked his hair back. “It’s time for Hugo to go home,” he said softly.
“Potter, stop it!” Draco held a forbidding finger up, just daring the prat to say one more word. “Focus. I have something to tell you and it can’t wait. So shut up and let me do it!”
“Can’t, got a thing,” Harry replied distractedly. He was busy carting armloads of those movie disc things over to the telly-vision set. Ron cocked his head and squinted at some of the titles—
now. James’s mouth twisted. This was starting to get out of hand. Clearly, he had work to do if he wanted to contain this situation. So, he nodded to himself and stole a kiss from his beautiful wife. “I’ll leave right now.”
Harry glared sullenly as the plates floated into the kitchen and set themselves neatly in the sink.
“Mr Mal...Draco.” The switch to his first name just made it worse. It was another Healer thing, another useless platitude for Merlin-only-knows-what. His grip on the sheet tightened. He braced himself, preparing for the absolute worst because at this point, what else could it be?
There were reasons,
His parents smiled.
immune to that eventuality.
“I’m serious,” the tosser said, pushing the plate over. “You don’t plan to eat them standing over there, do you?”
“What is it, Malfoy?”
Harry nodded tersely and stabbed a potato with his fork. This was going to be harder than he thought.
“Gravy,” he read out in a flat, deadpan voice. "It says you’re having...gravy."
Harry slumped on his couch, feeling utterly dejected. How had he messed up so much? He’d been struggling with his feelings for Draco for so long. When Ron had brought up the date thing, he’d denied everything out of pure habit. Now Draco was angry with him and any chance Harry could have had was gone forever.
"Your welcome, by the way" Potter grinned. "Does this mean we're ok?"
"Mum, stop it. I am perfectly capable of flooing to the station." Draco complained as his mother fretted over him.
"Want  anything mate?"
Room 8 - Megan Jones and Milllicent Bulstrode
Room 6 - Lisa Turpin and Hannah Abbott
"Actually," Potter interrupted. "I told people that in the end, you saved me from a fire so a lot less people hate you now." Draco stared stupidly.
"Who has a crush on Neville?" Harry asked. Immediately he was met with hostile glares. Draco was the first one to speak.
"Draco dear, stop drooling." Pansy said while looking straight at Draco. He scowled as Blaise laughed.
"Hi."
"Now that we are all fed, you all need your beauty sleep ready for your first day. Prefects please take lead and 8th years stay here. I need to talk to all of you. Go on then, everyone get going. Goodnight."
"No need to be rude calm down. My fault for asking I guess but still. Are you looking forward to this year Draco?" That's when Draco started playing with his hands nervously.
Room 4 - Ronald Weasley and Terry Boot
"I'm not sure that I want to be back. It was hard enough being at the ministry where people looked and gossiped about me but at Hogwarts it's going to be ten times worse." Both pansy and Blaise nodded sympathetically. They were left alone to their thoughts and half an hour later the snack trolley came.
The piece of paper read as follows :
After everyone had eaten as much as they could, McGonagall called for silence one more time.
"On this piece of paper are your sleeping arrangements. All your things are already there and no, no one will be swapping rooms." She set the piece of paper down and looked at the small group of 8th years rush towards it.
"Most of us have lost someone in the war so now, more than ever we need to be joint as a school. Make friends from people with other house and you can also sit with friend from other houses from now on. I want us to move forward together, even if you made bad choices in the past." Her gaze seemed to linger at the Slytherin table.
"Now lets eat." As soon as she finished talking, food appeared in front of them and everybody immediately began to eat and talk. A few students moved to sit with their friends at other tables and the sound of voices filled the hall.
"What." She snatched the paper and read. Sure enough, it was on the list.
"Ok bye love." She hugged him.
"The catch, is that I personally picked the sleeping arrangements." That statement was met with groans.
"What!" Harry exclaimed. "No, this must be a mistake." He looked at Ron and Hermione for help.
"I just wanted to say I don't blame you for what  happened in the war. It wasn't your fault." Why was Potter starting this conversation and why didn't he hate Draco?
Harry was floored with how strict and proactive Professor McGonagall was being.  He didn’t doubt that without this ward there would be retribution seekers attacking in the halls and abandoned classrooms.  He was curious about the new dorms she mentioned since he trusted Hermione to take care of their shopping list and hadn’t seen the note about black robes instead of house robes.  He hadn’t even noticed the robes he was currently wearing did not denote a house.  He just put them on when handed them by Hermione.  He glanced around the few remaining in the Great Hall.  There weren’t that many of them.  Hermione and him were joined by Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Pavati from Gryffindor.  Slytherin had the next highest return rate with Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Millicent Bulstrode, and Theodore Nott. Next came Hufflepuff with Justin Finch-Feltchley, Ernie Macmillan, Susan Bones, and Hannah Abbott.  Ravenclaw was only met with Padma Patil, Morag MacDougal, and Stephen Cornfoot.  He nodded in acknowledgement to a few and stood to step closer to Professor McGonagall when she indicated for them to come closer.
“Non-magical studies. It’s no longer an elective either. They don’t pay too well but I don’t have time to complain. Before that I was Captain of the detective division in London.”
Thursday, March 20th
“I’ll do just that, Draco,” whispered Harry hanging up the phone and putting it on his chest.
“Shhh,” he murmured, his nose running circles on Draco’s forehead. “I’m enjoying my morning.”
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for everything I’ve put you through.”
“I know a spell that could help. It’s an old one but it works. Do you want me to try?”
“From time to time. I don’t really keep track, you know. But I’m usually not left with a stab wound.”
“Good morning everyone,” said Harry, grabbing a piece of an orange already set on a plate, ready to be taken to the table.
“Yeah, and I defended him for so long. He was a shit headmaster.”
“Goddamn it. You’re so beautiful, Draco,” he said quietly, surprising even himself. Draco’s eyes popped open and a cocky smile turned his lips.
“Can we go back to the post-sex bliss?”
“You’re so gorgeous, Draco,” he whispered, when leaning down to kiss him, deciding to enjoying every second of it. Draco smiled at him, his face blushed pink when he shifted Harry to his back, taking his trousers of, throwing them somewhere to the bedroom floor, kneeling between his legs and running his hands down.
Draco shook his head helplessly. “I still don’t get it.”
in his throat and his ears and he could sense the vampire’s interest. He could see it in the twitch of his smile, the way those jade eyes trailed downwards...
His new adventure was just beginning.
The train of thought made him chuckle a bit — which no doubt concerned Draco judging by his discrete side-eye.
and all the complications that came with them. Instead, he was going to ease Potter into the truth with a carefully constructed visual metaphor. And then, after Potter had his freakout and Draco rediscovered the fine art of speaking coherently, they could discuss co-parenting and what not.
“I...”
you clung to when you were scared.
Granger shuffled uneasily. “Last night. Harry told me about what happened. Between you two. That’s when I figured...but I didn’t tell him!” she added hastily.
“What about you?” Draco demanded, even as he curled up with a grateful sigh.
It’s not a shock. He’s always known the truth, even if it remains unspoken. He was seven when he first came upon one of Father’s ‘business associates’. He was racing through the Manor, playing a game of hide-and-seek with the portraits, when a huge, brutish man with pointed yellow teeth blocked his path. The man, whom he would later come to know as the notorious werewolf Fenrir Greyback, grinned at him and purred, “Aren’t you a cute little morsel?”
lucky, you might even have an arch-rival.”
“Besides, he likes you,” Harry went on.
Gaps like
Draco started and upset the inkwell as the howls ascended to a whole new level. Cursing a blue streak, he made a run for the tiny playroom he had set up for Baby Weasel.
Harry was asleep.
James crept through the corridor as quickly and quietly as he could, trying to recall all he could from the little he’d seen of the castle. At least the Great Hall was gigantic and not too hard to find. He made short work of heading down the Grand Staircase and...
good dog. Who’s a good boy? Who’s a good boy, Godric? You are! Yes, you...”
“Look,” Potter cut in gently. “I know you’re used to being good at everything. You get Os and Es in all your classes, right?” Little Ravenclaw scrubbed her face and nodded, looking just a tad mollified. Potter grinned and pressed the wand in her fingers. “Sometimes, you just don’t get it right on your first try. I know I didn’t. That’s why we practice. Now take a breather and try again, okay? Just relax.”
Harry didn’t though. With point blank concentration, he pursued the golden orb’s trajectory, swerved against the beating wind and reached out.
Draco left quickly and without another look back. And if it felt like his heart was breaking with every footstep, then that’s just the way it was.
“We only…” Draco shook his head and struggled for words. “It was just a few times.”
Draco glanced at his torn sleeve and suppressed a sigh. “It’s okay,” he replied. “These things happen.”
The black lab— who had inexplicably passed obedience school with flying colours, by the way— rudely ignored him and stalked his way up the hill, evidently following some sort of trail.
“Yes well, don’t get used to it,” Malfoy grumbled. Nevertheless, he was extra cautious as he handed the sleeping baby over to Hermione. “Careful,” he warned as she settled Hugo on her shoulder. “Don’t jostle him.”
Oh Merlin, he was
Granger seemed to think so too. “You do,” she agreed. “And you should do it before you lose your nerve.”
“Potter…”
When Draco thought about what might have happened today...he didn’t even want to say it. Just thinking about it made his heart hammer in his chest again, well on the way to another panic attack. No, he was done with that spiel. His son was in
but you can never pinpoint how old they are,
The next day they sat together on the ferry, shoulder to shoulder, wind and rain fighting each other behind the thick windows. The slow rocking of the boat lulled them, providing them with a fake calmness before they dock to the island. It was just the three of them in the boat even though there was a line of people witing for their turn to travel to the island.
he thought as he started walking briskly towards his flat.
“I want to do so many things to you,” whispered Draco, kissing the inside of Harry’s muscular thigh.
“Ok. Harry, deep breaths, alright?” he said slapping Harry lightly on the face when his eyes started to fall back. Harry nodded or at least that’s how it looked like. “Look away. Imma bandage it. It’s going to be fine.”
“You feeling any better?” asked Draco, relief washing over him after hearing Harry’s laugh.
“Come in.”
“Last night… did you stay here because you wanted to or because you felt guilty?”
“You panicked?”
He showed his hand to Draco. The thinnest pink line was still visible across the palm and Draco trailed his thumb over it.
“Would you like some coffee, sir?” Tommley asked Draco in her screeching voice.
But Harry’s life never went back to normal since it never was “normal”. His “normal” was figuring out who is trying to kill him year after year and trying to stay alive. When that was gone Harry was left emptyhanded. With nothing else to do he threw himself into work. Catching leftover Deatheaters that somehow evaded capture filled his days and drinking filled his nights. He didn’t remember most of his days after the Year of Trials. All he knew was that he was so incredibly mad.
Harry took the Prophet and started flipping through it, more just to have something to do than to actually read it when he heard Draco entering the kitchen and greeting Tommley and Pipps. Harry thought that his voice sounded apprehensive.
“Yeah.”
“Good morning, Draco,” he said from behind the newspaper as the blond man walked in. He was wearing one of Harry’s heavy, thick sweaters in a maroon colour that brought out his post-shower rosy cheeks. “I see Peeps chose the clothes well.”
,” murmured Draco as he followed Harry into his bedroom.
Draco woke to the sun promising the first spring morning of the season hitting the wall in front of him and a warm weight draped over him. He was covered in a thick green blanket with an arm wrapped around him tight, a warm breath touching his neck and strong body right behind him.
Harry looked at him from above his glasses. That was blunt and straight to the point and he liked it.
“Only family and friends allowed beyond this point,” Greggs said, holding his hand up to stop them from passing.
Draco’s previously tall, straight posture slumped a bit.
“Are you alright?” Harry whispered, his lips almost touching Draco’s ear.
“As I said, it’s a pleasure. Why did you want to meet?”
Draco stopped, his hand already on the handle. Harry could see the hesitation on his face while he tried to decide whether the prospect of seeing Harry again is worth spending an evening with the other two. But then he smiled. One of those wide, hopeful smiles that took over his whole face.
“One would think that after you killed off Voldemort all the evil would die with him.”
Harry loved breakfasts. Especially when someone prepared it for him. The whole ritual of the first meal of the day was lost to him while living with the Dursley’s where he was the one cooking breakfast for everyone since he turned nine.
“I’m not sure what you are talking about, sir,” she answered in her high-pitched, curious voice. “Like what?”
“I…” Harry thought for a while. “I am not,” he admitted, honestly, touching the remnants of his right arm. “I’m definitely not good. But I’m working on it. I was really angry for a while. Mad at the public for moving past the war so quickly. Mad at Ron for leaving the Auror division. Mad at myself. Mad at Dumbledore.”
“Do you want the short version or the long one?” Harry said, leaning back into his chair, feeling all warmed up by the food.
“Come back to bed, Draco,” Harry murmured, pulling him even closer.
“It’s a muggle café so the papzz shouldn’t be bothering us. They might be dicks but they really don’t like breaking the Statue of Secrecy, you know.”
Why was Harry so adamant about forgiving him. They were never close, they hated each other for most of their lives so what has changed. Harry did say that it was because he “grew up” but you don’t just forgive seven years of bullying.
“Go for it.”
“Yeah… We haven’t really talked since we almost died in that cursed fire. Whi-”
The small monitor above the front of the ship read “Azkaban, 10 minutes” and Draco could feel the anxiety forming in his stomach. He looked out through the window but he couldn’t see the distinctive shape of the prison. It reminded him of the last time he was on a similar boat, making his way towards the prison with a 10 year sentence awaiting him there. And he got scared. And it dawned on him. This is why he didn’t visit his father after he left.
“I told you he’s not gonna get it, girls,” said Hermione from behind him. “It’s Harry after all.”
“Want me to take your glasses off?” Harry nodded so Draco took the shiny frames and folded them on the table. He then turned towards the hand in question. “Ok, don’t look,” he warned. Almost immediately Harry’s head landed on his shoulder, his face buried in Draco’s neck. Draco felt his face warming up with a blush again. “Or you could do that, that’s fine.”
“Would you like a smoothie?” Draco picked up the spoon and placed it on the plate of Harry’s teacup. He charmed a big glass jar onto the table and put the rest of the yogurt in with the blueberries and raspberries. He cut one of the bananas and put it into the mix. The Elves decorated the fruit plate with some mint which he also added to the cup. He topped all that with milk and covered with a plate. “Ok, let’s see if it’s going to work.”
“I don’t know? It just… happened?”
“You’re right. Remember Lockhart? What the actual fuck was that?” Draco laughed.
“What?”
“I don’t think so. I think it’s just how she is. And I rather enjoy it,” said Harry, taking a spoonful of the steamed milk from his coffee and licking the spoon clean. The smell of cinnamon made him feel warm and safe.
And it felt nice.
“You smuggled a fucking dragon through the school, Harry!” said Draco, holding out a chef’s knife towards Harry for him to dry.
“Thank you. I appreciate your input.”
Harry passed the time going through the paper but not really reading anything. Since Reeta got fired couple of years ago for fabricating stories and slander that almost cost them Greyback the Prophet started to resemble an actual newspaper instead of a toilet paper backup. He was halfway through an article on the new Minister of Magic when he heard a group of people walking in.
His door took him a bit further away from the café than he’d liked but he was still first to get there.
“Who said anything about respecting the authorities?” Draco asked, his voice low and his hand closing on Harry’s lapel, pulling him closer. Harry’s sly smile was wiped off by Draco’s warm lips as he leaned in, deepening the kiss putting his hand in Draco’s hair and feeling the excitement buzzing in his blood. He pushed him back onto the bed, kneeling above him, pinning his slender hands above his head, kissing him harder, trying to remember the taste of Draco’s lips.
“Dude, if I only knew,” answered Harry covering his face with his arm, trying hard not to spill the drink. “It’s messed me up. I mean… I’ve been fighting this man basically every year since I was eleven. And then it just… stopped? And my biggest problem became the papzz wanting to snap a pic of me in a compromising situation, some leftover Deatheaters and sloppy twelve year olds.”
“No, no, it’s alright. I’ll do it.”
“Thank you, Agnes,” said Draco, sending her a friendly look.
He risked it and moved the arm away opening his eyes a little bit. And there it was. A glass of cool water on his bedside table. Thank fucking god for the House Elves. He drank the whole damn thing, cursing out last night’s Harry for acting like a teenager. He was too old for that.
“Do you want me to get the trousers too?” he asked as if there was another choice.
“When did you get so…” gasped Draco made a circling motion with his hands. “Do you enjoy making people uncomfortable?”
“It was about Mrs. Weasley. She might’ve punched a camera person.”
“Not much, young man. How can I help you?” he answered, handing him a glass of whiskey.
“The Merchant in Mayfair is fairly good and has a decent lunch menu,” Harry said, finishing the muffin and brushing his fingers off on a napkin. “They have some desserts too if you like that kind of things. And it’s not as expensive as one would expect.”
“Honestly, my team is moving towards a drunken bender. Nothing really points to kidnapping. But Horace swears that Robert was never a drinker. I don’t know. I seams like something a sheltered guy would’ve done the moment his leash got cut. I could’ve used some time with the guy but you know, I’m just a civilian now. The law is the law.”
“Evening Tom,” said Harry sitting on the bar stool. “Anything new?”
“Can I at least know your name?”
Harry was laying down already with his arm under his head and an inviting look on his face, staring straight into his eyes.
The quiet
“Evening, Draco. Sorry to make wait,” said a voice to his right and he felt Harry’s hand on the small of his back. His long, dark coat covering his broad shoulders and as he met eyes with Draco a smile brightened his face.
“Please, Mother,” he whispered, shaking his head lightly. “Not now.”
“I’m here if you need me.”
He sat up at the edge of the bed ignoring the loud and painful protests of his head. There was a glass of water waiting for him on the bedside table with a slice of lemon in it. It tasted amazing and he wondered weather it was put here by one of the House Elves or Harry. Probably the House Elves. Harry must be just as drunk as he is.
. And it was
“Potter, I’m not going with you to your bedroom. We almost fucked an hour ago. Shit is not happening,” whispered Draco with a little laugh.
“Yeah, a baby. Can you believe it?” she said, her right hand automatically sliding over her rounding up belly.
over?”
“At mine then.”
“That’s ridiculous. I’ve known him for years and you are definitely not him, mate. I think you’ve had enough of that gin,” Harry said, taking the glass out of the stunned stranger’s hand and drinking the contents in one, quick gulp. He took out his wand from behind his belt and filled the glass back with a quick
“Good morning, sir. Was the guest bedroom set properly?” she asked, clutching a napkin in her long, skinny hands.
“Yes?”
How his silver eyes went from happy and cheerful to sad, dull. How his tall, straight posture slumped as if under a great weight. Harry had hoped that Narcissa would be of help to Draco, a motherly shoulder to cry on or at least to console each other but it didn’t look like that would be the case. He wasn’t the best at consoling either but he had to try his damn hardest. He wanted Draco to feel better.
“May I help you?” she asked in a slow, high-pitched voice, looking curiously at him.
“Hermione punched a pap?” asked Draco.
“I learnt to deal with it. It’s really fine.”
Draco responded by kissing Harry’s chest and slipping out of the bed. The room was almost completely dark and chilly since nobody cared enough to keep the fire going. He could feel Harry’s eyes all over his body and he truly enjoyed the attention.
Pipps disappeared behind the door and Harry got back to getting ready. It was raining outside so there was no real reason to do his hair in any way since the moisture is going to make it into a messy bird nest anyway. He just shuffled them back a bit with his hand, not having high hopes that it’ll stay that way.
“Slughorn? Didn’t know Horace had a kid,” said Draco after Harry summarized the last case.
Harry sat up, propped his elbow on his knee with the almost empty glass of rum in his hand and looked at Draco’s face hidden behind a curtain of soft, golden hair. The fire was doing crazy things with his complexion.
He jumped off the bed, straightening his shirt and robes.
“And you have no leads on who kidnapped him?” asked Draco while moving the dishes to the sink. He enchanted the sponge to wash them while he collected the leftovers. Harry stood propped on the kitchen table under the window, trailing his eyes after Draco.
“Fuck… he was really something, wasn’t he?”
“Of course,” assured Harry, folding the paper and putting it away. “And you don’t need to give it back. Molly makes them every year, I have more than enough to last me till I die,” added Harry.
“Alright,” whispered Draco, walking back to the bed. He took his clothes off, laid down under the soft covers and started to question every little twitch of his muscles.
“Don’t some of them are also convicted war criminals?”
“Good evening, Narcissa. Welcome to London,” he said, bowing to her and kissing her small, dainty hand covered in suds. A glimmer of shock ran through her face. “Please, make yourself at home.”
“It’s over,” he said, quietly from behind the newspaper. His eyes started burning with tears pulling in them. “It’s finally over.”
“Thanks, mate,” Harry jumped when he heard a voice behind him and rose his wand straight into the strangers face.
Draco didn’t answer. He just gently patted Harry’s hair, smoothing the curls, listening to his shallow breathing and continuing to clean up the mess he’d made as best as he could from their position on the floor.
“No. He was my husband.” Her voice cracked a little on the word “was” and she tightened her grip on the wand. He let it go. There was no convincing his mother once she made a decision.
“She doesn’t like any of my…
“I teach at Hogwarts.”
When he was done he slid his hand over Harry’s hip and up, until it stopped on his chest. Harry’s arm slid down to the small of Draco’s back. And they danced to the beat of the music, always touching the other one, being free, being together. They lost the sense of time but they both knew it was time to go home when Harry turned Draco around and placed a small kiss on the nape of his neck.
Harry nodded, giving his hand a little squeeze. He wanted to embrace him, let him rest his head on his shoulder. Harry was painfully aware of what Draco’s last night looked like, his body shaking with the silent cries, and he was sure it didn’t include a lot of sleep.
“What about him?” Harry asked, suddenly self conscious about his new relation.
“Potter…” stuttered Draco but he held his wand properly and cast
Harry didn’t answer. Instead he found Draco’s hand still holding onto his belt and they started to push through the crowd, towards the cloakroom, towards the exit, towards the cold rain rushing from the sky as if there was no tomorrow.
In a sudden surge of confidence Draco walked up to him from behind, touching his arm and leaning over his ear.
“What are you doing here so early?” he asked, happily walking towards him, kissing him lightly on the cheek and giving him a quick hug. He did it in such a casual way as if they had done that a million times before. It stunned Harry for a second, the conflict of emotions short-circuiting his mind.
“I was thinking about brunch tomorrow.”
“See, it works. So it’s yours. And you didn’t buy it so you’re clean. And I don’t have to keep it in my desk anymo-”
“Thanks,” whispered Harry, weakly.
“Good morning,” answered Draco, sliding his hand over to Harry’s waist. He was pretty sure he felt another scar under his touch.
“I hope she’s doing alright there.”
“I would love to,” said Harry, fixing his hair in the mirror. “What would you say about dinner tonight?”
“You read about me? I feel so honoured.”
“Glad you like it.”
"You might not blame me but I bet a lot of people do."
"As you are now the oldest students in the castle and you are legally adults you don't have a curfew. If you go to classes tired, that's on you. You will also be able to visit Hogsmade freely and whenever you want." She looked around to see smiling faces.
"Fine, do what you want." Blaise sat down with his food ignoring Draco. Since he had been his friend since first year, he knew that Draco was moody and liked to strop. The rest of they way Pansy read a magazine and Blaise ate while Draco sulked.
"First years this way. Come here. First years." The massive half-giant Hagrid yelled.
After Potter had left, Blaise turned to Draco and asked, "What was that about? Since when does Potter care?" Draco didn't really know how to reply so instead he stared at Potter. What was up with him. First the weird look now pretending to care about Draco's preferences. What a weirdo. Once again, Draco noted, Potter wasn't joining in the conversation the weasel and Granger were having. He was just looking at the wall. What was up with him? Not that Draco cared of course. He was caught staring and it took him a few seconds to understand what Pansy had said.
"Does someone have a crush on LongBottom" Pansy laughed.
After the war, life was hard for Draco and his father hadn't made anything easier. Lucius Malfoy was sent to Azkaban and he was probably going to spend the rest of his life there whereas Narssica and Draco had had trials because of their involvement with Potter and because at the end of the battle they actually tried to help. It was determined that Narcissa would be placed in house arrest and Draco would be able to attend Hogwarts for his 8th year. Most of their riches were taken away but a decent amount still remained so Draco was still able to live a comfortable life.
"Yes, of course but I need to go now or I won't make it on time."
"Ok. Bye I guess." Draco did not return the goodbye.
Room 2 - Anthony Goldstein and Justin Finch-Fletchley
Draco stepped out at platform 9 and 3/4. He was greeted by the loud noises of owls and little kids running around the station. Most people were there with their families but Draco didn't have that luxury. He stood away from the crowd and as soon as he could, he went inside to get himself a compartment; none of his friends, except Pansy and Blaise, were going to come back to Hogwarts because they all fully supported the dark lord unlike Draco. He hissed at younger years and gave them death glares so that by the time the train started to move he was still alone and had the compartment to himself. A couple minutes later, Pansy and Blaise arrived laughing.
Room 7 - Michael Corner and Seamus Finnigan
"I know dear, I'm just worried about you." She looked at him sadly. "Promise to be good and write letters to me. Draco rolled his eyes.
"Blaise, you're awfully quiet." Pansy questioned.
"The one closer to the door."
"Whatever you say darling." It was starting to get late and Draco wanted to be well rested for his first day, so he excused himself and went to his room. Luckily for him, Potter was still in the common room. Draco got himself ready before changing into his pyjamas and getting into bed. He started reading a book and it was not long before Potter came in.
"Come on you have to eat."
"He's sharing with LongBottom who has gotten incredibly fit over the summer." Draco teased while Blaise blushed.
"I went to our room and I wanted to ask which bed did you want?  Left or right side of the window?"
The piece of paper was handed around and when everyone had read it, it was handed back to the front. Some people went to enjoy their freedom while others went to see the common room. Draco, Pansy and Blaise went to the common room.
"Bye, love you mum." She waved as he stepped into the green fire.
"I was not drooling." Before he could continue arguing, Headmaster McGonagall called all the attention to the front of the hall ready for the sorting to begin.
"Ouch my bones. You'd think that they would make the seats comfy since we're meant so sit there so long but no." Draco complained.
"I want inner house unity and I want everyone to try. Now on a less serious not I have some notices," McGonagall continued.
By the time they got to the school, everyone was starving.
"You will have a joint common room but rooms will be handed out in pairs. You will be on the third floor." Everyone started to look towards their friends. Pansy was looking slightly distressed however, because as the only girl Slytherin she would have to be separated from Draco and Blaise.
"But because you are also the oldest you will be setting an example of house unity." This lessened the smiles.
Room 5 - Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy
Draco was one of the first people to reach the list and once he read it, he was no happy at all. He was furious.
"Come on Draco," Pansy waved him and Blaise over to a carriage. Draco stared at the Thestral and it looked back with its big eyes. The Thestrals had never gotten this much attention but after last years war it seemed inevitable that so may people would have seen death. As they climbed into the carriage, Draco saw Harry Potter for the first time since his trial. He hadn't changed much but he seemed more adult-like. More isolated. The wind blew, blowing his hair into his face. He moved to push it away but stopped when he saw Draco staring. They looked at each other until Hermione Granger pulled Harry after her. Stupid Granger Draco thought but he didn't really know what had just happened. Maybe Potter didn't hate him after all. Why should he care?
"I'm sorry darling were you expecting us?" Pansy grinned widely and sat down.
"So... how was your holiday?"Blaise asked.
"Yes."
Stupid McGonagall. Stupid Gryffindor's. Should've gone to Durmstrang like father said  Draco thought angrily. Pansy and Blaise were both looking at him to see if he would react but Draco knew better. He had too much to lose if he acted irrationally so he just sat down at the 8th year table quietly. The other 8th years didn't seem to care that much and most of them didn't even want to look at the Slytherin trio. Potter and his little group sat at the other end of the table. Draco observed them while Blaise and Pansy talked, he noticed that, like him, Potter was not joining the conversations. Instead, he was staring at the empty plate in front of him. Weird, Draco thought. Did perfect Potter fall out with his friends?
"Potter." He growled.
"None of your business Potter. What do you want?" He questioned.
"Hey pansy."
"What Malfoy?"
The whole school rushed at once to get to the doors. When only the 8th years were left, Pansy wondered out loud. "I wonder where we'll be sleeping?" Blaise looked at her thoughtfully before declaring "I have no idea." Draco sighed.
"I'll think about it. And thanks."
"Early as always guys," Draco smiled at them. It was a relief to have at least two people who didn't hate you at school.
"I do not have a crush on Potter." he hissed.
"As you all know, because of last years war, we have lost many individuals and we will have a moments silence." Nobody even breathed. Most people had lost family members and friends and this just reminded Draco how out of place he was. These people were grieving because of his poor choices. He helped kill people.
"Oh, you mean except me not being allowed to leave the house and mother being stuck at home with me and complaining about everything. Yeah, it was amazing."
Room 3 - Neville LongBottom and Blaise Zabini
"Millie's name is on here."
They found seats by the fire and Pansy and Draco continue teasing Blaise.
Room 1 - Hermione Granger and Pansy Parkinson
"Hello, can I help you with anything?" Draco asked with a fake smile.
All of summer, Draco was dreading returning to Hogwarts where people would look at him as if he was on display and he couldn't do anything to stop it because the ministry had been very clear that too much trouble would not be welcome. People would ask about the dark mark some would even call him a coward. Draco agreed. He thought of himself as the biggest coward ever. Why didn't he speak up? Why didn't he let Dumbledore help him and his mother? Why did he let Potter die? Potter, Potter, Potter. It was like an obsession again. Again. Because of his mothers house arrest, Draco couldn't go anywhere and he was fine with it. He spent most of the time reading from the large library in the manor (that they were allowed to keep after they promised to co-operate and give the ministry all of the dark things) and before he knew it, it was time to go to Hogwarts.
