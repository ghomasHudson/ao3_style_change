The note simply read, "Those were not my intentions, but do expect it to get harder to resist. " Harry didn't quite understand, but he knew that he just broke a dam and would soon be flooded with problems. He flushed the note and left the bathroom to return to his friends. He sat down and opened his book back up. It was harder to work after reading the note than it was before. Malfoy wouldn't attempt to make him do something in class, would he? He was already dreading the next Potions class.
Hermione had to go to the library; Harry followed along, as Ron was forced to go with George and Fred to sneak into the kitchens. If he hadn't been dragged away, he would have definitely joined them to make sure that Harry wasn't trying to get with Hermione. He struggled with the number of books in his arms as he helped carry half of them, following behind Hermione to check them out. Once they were seated in the very back of the library, Harry opened up to Hermione. "That day when Malfoy was getting in my face, do you remember that? You pulled me away from him." When Hermione nodded, he continued, "Well, I'm convinced he's part Veela."
"Haven't you noticed the way that everyone looks at him? Girls and boys are drooling over him, Hermione. Don't tell me you haven't noticed..."
"I don't know, Hermione. I mean, I've been thinking about a date to the Yule Ball, and they've all been girls. I've noticed guys, too, but..."
She stared at him as she waited for him to elaborate. He was thankful that Ron wasn’t around so he could be honest with her; he felt bad that he was excluding Ron, but he had to figure out a way for him to tell his friend.
"For how often you do that to me, one would think that you are the one pining for me rather than it being the other way around. What do you want from me, huh? Want me to give in so you can tell Rita how Harry Potter kissed you? How disgusted you were that you pushed him away and ran to tell everyone how terrible he is?" Harry rolled his eyes and crossed his arms over his chest. "I'm not that easy to manipulate." Before Draco had the chance to say anything, Harry was out of the room.
“I have no control of it. I’d make it stop if I could,” Draco said honestly, minutes after the original question was posed.
When the portrait swung open, Harry was immediately relieved to see Ron and Hermione sitting together on the couch. Harry sat on the ground in front of the couch, next to Hermione’s legs. Straight ahead of him, Dean sat, studying, with a couple Gryffindors he, himself, had never really spoken to. Dean gave him a worried look, as he had left quite some time after Harry had, yet Harry got to the common room quite some time after Dean had. Harry just smiled and shrugged, and Dean returned to his work. “What happened to you, Harry? I thought you were right behind us,” Hermione asked, nudging him with her knee softly.
Telling Ron was much easier than he’d expected, but his reaction still wasn’t what Harry had hoped for. Disbelief he expected, but it was obvious that Ron genuinely thought that he had gone insane.
"I suspected it, you know. Then you acted like we had something, so I thought- well, hoped- that I was wrong. " It was completely silent at the Gryffindor table as Ginny stomped away.
"I asked him if he could write down something from a book for me," Harry lied. He didn't really know what it was, but based on the interaction, he guessed that it was from Draco. Maybe after he read it, he would share. He tried to ignore the note, tried to focus on work, but couldn't. He excused himself to go to the bathroom, needing to know what it said to be able to do his work.
"Then why doesn't it bother us?" Ron didn't think it made sense. That was okay. Hermione, on the other hand, looked at Harry like she finally understood. They weren't attracted to him, therefore he didn't bother them. The look of pity returned.
"But I've never really thought about it. I've always pushed those thoughts aside." When Dudley was younger, Aunt Petunia would call her son a lady's man. While being quite untrue because there was no way Dudley had ever dated anyone (or would ever land a decent woman), it imprinted on him that boys being with girls was the only option. Whenever the television talked about being gay, Uncle Vernon would call it a disease. He'd say they needed to be put down because they were sick. Him being with a man hadn't really seemed like an option.
Harry's attention went to Draco as Pansy crossed her arms and sat back down with a huff. He pushed the Prophet in Draco's face. "Why don't you tell everyone what you are? I do not like you. I have never felt anything but hatred towards you." Draco smirked and was about to speak when Harry stopped him. "Have fun with your 'girlfriend,'" he muttered, rolling his eyes. He spun on his heels and left the Hall, hating the explosion of chatter that followed his exit. For a school of magic, with real problems like the inevitable return of Voldemort, Hogwarts was no different than the primary school he had gone to. Everyone acted like children when the hot new gossip came out.
Harry took to the library as the common room was too busy to focus and he didn’t want to be secluded in his room. He had only just opened his Potions book when a shadow moved over him. He didn't have to look up to know who it was, the aggravation was coming off of him in waves; Harry could feel himself becoming angry. Lucky for him, Pansy chose that moment to loudly whisper at Draco to come see what she had found. She wouldn’t admit it, but she was overwhelmingly jealous of Harry. His own emotion suddenly turned from anger, to annoyance, then to grief. As Draco walked away, Harry suddenly understood that the things he felt whenever Draco was near was a reflection of his own feelings. Before, all of the things he felt were directly connected to the Veela; he believed those thoughts were forced upon him. Now, though, he felt emotions. They had never been a part of Draco’s inflicted charm. The ache in his chest as they had passed days prior was not an attempt to hurt Harry, it was just the opposite. It was Draco’s own pain that bounced onto Harry as though he was a mirror.
Harry made up some bullshit excuse about studying up for the next task, which made Hermione incredibly proud to think that Harry was actually trying to be prepared. When he got to the lavatory, his first thought was a joking ‘how romantic.’ Draco had been sitting against the empty wall, but stood as Harry entered, hesitating before pulling him into a tight hug, mumbling, “I didn’t know she’d do that,” as though it wasn’t apparent by his change in demeanor towards Parkinson. Draco’s feeling of guilt surrounded him, but there was something more there, too. Hope. Harry sat next to the spot Draco had been sitting, which he occupied once again.
A shiver went through Harry, knowing that he was that close to being seriously injured, or even killed—by a girl his age who was much too obsessed with Draco for her own good. He hoped that she was bluffing.
“Thanks, Dean,” Harry hesitated, “I appreciate that.” Dean nodded before doing what he’d come up to the dorms to do. He waved before disappearing out the door, and Harry found himself unable to handle the silence. There were still a couple hours until curfew, so Harry decided to take a walk to cool off, physically and emotionally.
“Sure,” she sighed, picking around at her food, somehow feeling worse knowing that Harry wasn’t hurting like she was. Sure, that was selfish, but she felt like he had led her on. She wanted him to know that same awful feeling.
Harry dreaded Potions class. The last four years had been him dreading Potions class. Perhaps if they cycled through Potions professors as they had Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, he would actually have a chance at being good at with potions. Instead, he was stuck with a professor who hated him and his father, and who take every chance he could to make Harry look like a fool. Harry and Draco were partnered up once again, probably because Snape thought that it would ruin Harry’s day. The two got to work, working silently until the room was too loud and confusing with so many discussions that it was safe for them to talk.
They were both smiling, and Harry felt exactly as Ron did. There was no way that their friendship wasn’t written in the stars, or whatever Trelawney would call it. It was no accident that the only empty seat Harry could find was with Ron. “Thanks, Ron.”
Harry frowned, seeing how serious she was. "You're right, I guess..." She wasn't right, but he didn't want to argue or admit something he wasn't sure of yet. The books were pushed away into Hermione's bag and the two walked back to the Gryffindor common rooms, meeting Ron along the way. You could tell just by looking at him that he was jealous, but neither Hermione nor Harry said anything to reassure him. They'd tried too many times; it would only fall on deaf ears. The three of them entered the portrait together.
"What was that about?" Harry was shocked and confused. Never once did he 'act like they had something.' Sure, he'd liked her, but she was his best friend's sister. He shook the thoughts from his head and looked to his friends for help.
"I doubt that," Harry mumbled, closing the book he was trying to read. Even Quidditch couldn't take his mind off the situation. He knew that Ron hated that Rita insisted Harry and Hermione were a couple. Ron would never admit it, but it was obvious he had feelings for her. He was jealous of the attention the 'relationship' got; it was putting a serious strain on their friendship, but there wasn't much Harry could do about it. Whenever Harry and Hermione were together, Ron was usually there. If there was a relationship between them, Ron would know. It wasn't enough to console him, though.
“We’ll prove them wrong. Pans had no right, and I think Rita knew it wasn’t me; she had to have, honestly. This will make them both look like fools.”
The next morning, Harry was exhausted as his friends were getting ready for breakfast. He pushed his glasses onto his face and took a deep breath before getting out of bed. Ron, who was already dressed, sat on the edge of his bed to put on his shoes.
The next day, Hedwig dropped off a small note, while everyone else got yet another Daily Prophet with his face on the front. The source cited for the article was none other than Draco Malfoy.
“So now you’re worried that Ron will freak out because he hates the Malfoys more than most,” she said, knowing Ron’s thoughts on Draco and Lucius more than anyone, and he nodded before she continued, “I can’t help you, but you have to tell him before it becomes public. He’ll be hurt if you don’t tell him.”
"You could have told me, you know... I would- I would have gotten over it," Ginny mumbled, her eyes and nose red like she'd been crying.
As though they didn't have the same cauldron... To make things even better, the professor asked him to stay behind to clean up a bad spill that was burning on the floor. The person responsible didn't have to do it because she was a Slytherin and all Slytherins are exempt from duties they'd otherwise have. He had to do it because his work was "distracted and irresponsibly done." He told his friends that he'd catch up with them at the Great Hall. By the time his Professor was happy with his cleaning, dinner was already started. Snape was working on grading the last of their assignments on Wolfsbane, so he stayed at his desk when Harry was finally allowed to leave. While pushing his potions book into his bag, not really paying attention to where he was walking, he was pulled into a dark closet he had never known was there before. His eyes were wide with panic, but before he could shout or curse his assailant, a warm hand was pressed over his mouth.
“I took a walk. Thought it might help me clear my head,” Ron admitted, removing his scarf from his neck now that they were indoors.
"Snape sat down a couple minutes ago. Where were you?" Ron asked, taking a bite from his dessert, as Harry had been forced to arrive so late. Hurrying so that he'd be able to eat, Harry piled food onto his plate and started shoveling food into his mouth. He waved off the question, hungrier than he'd been since he came to Hogwarts, leaving behind the abusive Dursleys. Before, he was used to only eating enough to survive. With daily feasts, he was never truly hungry anymore. His friends sent him food via owl during the summers now, too, so he was hardly hungry at, what he was forced to call, home. It was a better life, after knowing Hogwarts. Everything was better, really. Nightmares of the closet under the stairs still haunted him, but he was no longer forced under there. What if he hadn't been accepted to Hogwarts? Where would he be now? Harry forced himself to focus on the conversations around him instead of thinking about the Dursley's and the hell they put him through.
“Ron was muttering to himself as I walked by.” Dean laughed and shrugged, continuing, “I mean, go for it, man. If you think that it’s possible that your feelings aren’t directed related to him being a Veela, I don’t see why it’s a bad idea. I mean, I do, because everyone knows that you two are like rival enemies or something, but if that’s why you want, don’t let anyone stop you.”
The two got a lot of suspicious looks, acting so chummy as though the last partner project hadn’t been full of sarcasm and annoyance. They even left for dinner together, laughing about Merlin knows what. As they entered the Great Hall together, every single eye from the Slytherin and Gryffindor table was on them. They parted to go to their designated table, Harry rejoining Ron and Hermione. Ron looked as though he could be sick, but still faked a smile for Harry’s sake, but Hermione looked genuinely happy for him, less because of Draco and more because of the smile that hadn’t gone away since they’d parted. Yeah, rumors were bound to spread, but neither of them cared.
“It wasn’t him, Ron. Look at what it says. The last time I spoke to Pansy, I told her that I doubted Draco would date her because he had standards that she could never meet. It was Pansy, Ron.” Ron put his hand on Hermione’s, frowning. He wanted to defend her honor, but he wasn’t about to hex a girl, especially not one with so many friends. The last time he tried to hex someone for calling Hermione the M-word, he ended up puking slugs for hours. Hermione smiled at Ron and covered their hands with her other hand, hoping it’d calm him down. She didn’t care what the paper says. She was not ashamed of who she was or who she was going to the Ball with. She would have been worried about Harry, about the blatant lie that Pansy had posted, but he seemed completely unbothered. People were staring at the three of them, and at Draco, but Harry didn’t care. Pansy was being immature, and he wasn’t going to give her the satisfaction. Though, he smirked as he noticed she had tried to hold Draco’s hand, but he pulled away from her and moved down a seat. He did feel bad for Malfoy at the same time, as his best friend was unintentionally hurting him.
"Try to focus on what you feel towards everyone you see. Don't push it down anymore," Hermione replied just before they were dismissed. The three of them left together, and Harry did as Hermione suggested. As they walked, he paid special attention to anyone who caught his eye. Luna, with her bright pink headband with some sort of creature on top, was just too difficult not to notice. Then his eyes found Ernie Macmillan. He wasn't unattractive, they were sort of friends. Ernie smiled at him before ducking into his next class. Did he feel any way towards Ernie besides friendly? Harry didn't think so, but then it seemed quite hard not to think of all the nice things about his friend that he might be attracted towards. He had soft-looking hair, a sweet smile, kind eyes. Then he saw Cho and, as usual, he's heart sped up. She waved at him as they passed, and he tried to figure out why she made him feel the way he did. She was pretty, no doubt about that. She made him feel appreciated. She was graceful in the way she waved her wand, and the way she carried herself. But was there more than that? He didn't know much about her, on a personal level. They hadn't had many conversations; he didn't even know if she had siblings. Maybe it was that she was obviously into him as well? The idea of it being possible for them to end up together was what made him so nervous. With other crushes, it was always one sided. Sure, Ginny was majorly in love with him, and maybe he liked her a bit as well, but the idea of them together was laughable. The Weasleys were his family, Ron was his best friend. There was no way the two could ever date.
“The Yule Ball? You?” The questions made Draco regret opening his mouth, they sounded so disbelieving.
Harry knew as soon as Draco walked into the Great Hall, he could feel the anticipation and worry. Worry about whether Harry would want to meet up and if he was upset over the article. The Gryffindor watched him as Draco sat next to Crabbe and some girl neither of them had ever spoken to, going right past Pansy who called out, “Draco, honey, I saved you a seat.” Once seated, he finally looked across the hall at Harry, who gave him an incredibly subtle thumbs up as confirmation to their meeting. So subtle, in fact, that both Ginny and Ron asked him what the hell he was doing.
“I know you think this is a bad decision, but… I don’t know what happened, Hermione. You’re going to think I’m crazy, but I can feel what he feels. Something… changed. I can’t justify any of his past actions, but honestly, Hermione, I think he’s just been looking for attention that is for him, as a person, instead of from him being part Veela.”
"It's Rita Skeeter--her latest article, Harry; It's about you. " Neville handed him the Daily Prophet, trembling slightly. Harry snatched the paper, needing to know what was going on. Right on the first page, Rita's article glared at him. Famous Harry Potter is Taken with a New Student at Hogwarts.
, but now it’s a sensory assault he deals with several times a day. A warm body moves behind him, and he smells grass and spearmint, fresh and familiar.
Draco, that they are still breathless and sweaty and locked together. Then Draco smiles, a real smile, broad and bright and wonderful. He pushes back Harry’s hair, lets his finger trace over the lightning scar.
Draco drops his hands. ‘Harry?’ he murmurs, taking a tentative step forward. The wolf looks at him, and Draco sees the familiar bright green of his eyes. ‘Harry, it’s me. It’s Draco,’ he soothes as he slowly walks forward, the wolf watching him and sniffing the air cautiously.
It takes Draco the best part of the week he has to perfect it. Every spare moment he has, he hides himself away in his Potions room, several cauldrons bubbling at once as he tries several variations. There are piles of boxes and bags from Slug and Jiggers scattered around the room - Draco refuses to consider how much he’s spent on different ingredients, and why he’s been willing to do so. It’s not as if he can’t afford it, after all - even after the Ministry had taken a chunk of the Malfoy fortune in wartime reparations, there was plenty left over that meant that, really, Draco didn’t have to work a day in his life if he didn’t want.
Draco can’t help but laugh at that, even though Harry flashes him a hurt look. ‘Sorry, Potter,’ he apologises, taking a sip of his beer. It’s dark and hoppy, some kind of ale by the taste of it. ‘It’s just, back at Hogwarts, could you ever have imagined
He wanted to taste Draco there, and to feel the cold bite of metal against his tongue. He ran his tongue along the smooth ring, and curled the tip through the metal, pulling on it just a little, just enough for Draco to reach down and grab his hair, grinding into his mouth. He wrapped one of those gorgeous long legs around Harry’s back, and let the sharp heel dig into his back. Harry moaned as the heel scratched him when he moved, the pain making his pleasure all the greater.
,’ Draco groans, his hands scratching Harry’s head, his hips grinding into him, forcing Harry to take him deeper. Harry’s wolf growls possessively: now he’s had the taste of Draco’s cock on his tongue, Harry knows he’s never going to want anything -
Harry lowered his head, flicking his tongue against the ball that held one of the bars in place. He was rewarded with a low groan from Draco, who arched into his touch and curled a fist into Hairy’s messy hair.
Hermione’s breath caught at the sight of him, his lean, Quidditch-honed body tempting and tight, his cock already half-hard. Draco reached down and ran his fingers through Harry’s messy hair, making Harry press up against him, his eyes fluttering shut.
Now, Harry sat at a table, glass of Firewhisky forgotten in his hand, his jaw practically dragging on the floor as he ignored his friends and stared across the bar.
Once again, a snarl from Harry, this time making Robards stumble to a stop. ‘Well, your fucking plan was a failure, wasn’t it? Everyone in the entire wizarding world knows I’m a werewolf now, and Draco? He was tortured, he could have been
Harry shook his head like a wet dog, cursing himself for not staying focused. Ron, across the bullpen at his desk, gave Harry a bemused look of concern. Harry kept his eyes trained down to the paperwork on his desk, refusing to look directly at his friend.
It’s all Harry can do not to come on the spot. His wolf is ecstatic, revelling in the possession of the one he calls
There has always been one Auror whose face never fails to settle into a scowl when he sees Draco, however, and that person is—
the wave of pleasure that flowed off Malfoy at his words. ‘But how did you manage it? The Wolfsbane potion’s been around for years, how come it’s never been improved upon?’
By Monday morning, Harry’s feelings have coalesced into a raging maelstrom of aggravation. He glowers at Malfoy as he storms in, ignoring the twinge of guilt as the warm smile falters on Malfoy’s face. Too late he notices his partner offering him some tea, in a paper Brewmsticks cup, that he must have picked up especially for him on the way into work. Harry snatches it, mutters a reluctant thanks, and collapses into his chair.
Harry is stony-faced for just a moment, then a smile tugs on his lips. ‘You’re right,’ he concedes, lifting his glass in salutation. ‘To new beginnings?’
‘Potter, Weasley has things under control—’ Robards tries one last time, and Harry howls with the effort of not grabbing the Head Auror by the scruff of the neck and shaking some sense into him.
Draco doesn’t look up at Potter’s hissed words. He stands in front of Draco’s desk, his broad, bulky body blocking the light.
Beside him, Malfoy leaned closer, letting one of his booted ankles curl around Harry’s leg, the point of his heel digging ever-so-slightly into Harry’s calf.
‘Together?’ he offers, and Draco only hesitates for half a heartbeat before stepping forward and laying a tentative hand on Harry’s forearm.
Draco worked hard to keep his grumpy expression in place, knowing full-well that Harry’s grooming charms lacked the finesse they really needed to work. Harry squeezed his thigh again and moved closer to kiss him, this time on the lips. Nothing too scandalous, just a soft, gentle touch of Harry’s lips to Draco’s, a connection and a claiming. Draco let his reluctant smile break through as Harry broke away, and let himself be pulled back into his hold, leaning against Harry’s chest in the squashy sofa, the comforting, familiar sound of half a dozen Weasley family voices surrounding them.
Only then would Blaise tuck him back away, crawl back out from under the covers, and collapse back onto the pillows, finally able to fall into a deep, restful sleep.
Draco tries not to let it bother him, the way the Aurors are a tight-knit group with their in-jokes and their camaraderie and their ‘no wixen left behind’ ideals. Because while all that was true, it was only true as far as every Auror
‘Good,’ he says, shortly. He hears Draco stand behind him, the warmth of his body a whisper at his back. ‘We’re taking the rest of the day off. We’ll be back to work tomorrow.’
An actual holiday, this time. They drank hot chocolate and walked through the snow and made slow, languorous love beside the fire. Draco held Harry in his arms, snuggled beneath thick blankets, and kissed his hair and first whispered those three wonderful words.
‘Do you mind?’ Hermione said, putting on her swottiest voice and peering over the top of her book. ‘The library is for
Draco hides a grin later that evening, and just curls closer Charlie, tightening his arms around him.
Harry looks up in surprise as Gawain Robards, head of the DMLE, calls out for him. ‘Potter, get in here.’ Robards’ voice, no-nonsense as always, carried across the bullpen from his office. With a sigh, Harry pushes himself to his feet, running a hand hopelessly through his messy hair. He caught Ron’s grimace of sympathy from across the room. A trip to Robards’ office rarely ended with good news.
Unaware of Draco’s thoughts, Harry makes his way over to their table, glasses in his hands. When he passes Draco’s over, Draco makes a point of letting his fingers brush Harry’s: a sign of solidarity, of sorts.
‘I’m sorry,’ she whispered, contrite. ‘I tried to say no, but…’ she trailed off and looked back at Draco, leaning forward to nuzzle into his neck. ‘Please, sir,’ she whispered, wanting to make it up to him. ‘Please, don’t be mad.’
They spend the day together, lazy and unhurried as they shower, eat breakfast, read the papers, take tea in the garden, all interspersed with kissing and touching and whispering sweet words to each other in the ghost of a gap between their lips.
Harry shrugs, finding it hard to care about magical technicalities when Draco is in his arms, their clothing still a barrier between them.
Molly gave an excited exclamation, and hurried off down the hall. Draco followed more slowly, taking the time to remove his apron and spell his hands clean first. Harry and the others had emerged from the living room at the commotion, and the hallway was a crowded chaos of mainly red hair: Arthur Weasley, Ron and Hermione, Bill and Fleur with their baby swaddled and safe in Bill’s arms, Fred and Ginny, Percy and Audrey: the only person who had been missing was now standing in the doorway as Molly hugged him close.
Lunch was quick, takeaway sandwiches at their desk, Harry trying to ignore Draco’s greasy fingers, the way his tongue darts out to lick away a spot of mayonnaise. Harry and Draco were on Diagon Alley patrol rotation for four hours that afternoon, and then Harry would be free for the evening. Free to grab hold of Draco’s forearm, whisk him away to Grimmauld Place, and finally claim him, as his wolf wanted, as
. Trying to pay attention to the suspicious figures while desperately trying to keep his cock from hardening against Draco’s delectable backside, while the tempting scent of his arousal curled around them, was practically impossible.
Draco lowers his eyes again, knowing full well the wolf in Potter will take it as a sign of submission. Sure enough, Potter growls quietly, a pleased kind of sound, and Draco holds his breath as he waits to see what Potter will do next.
Now, Harry sat at a table, glass of Firewhisky forgotten in his hand, his jaw practically dragging on the floor as he ignored his friends and stared across the bar.
The door to Peaseblossom Cottage swings open, and Hermione’s familiar, comforting scent sweeps over him.
. The green spell bounces harmlessly off the door, and Harry drops it with a clatter and reaches Pettigrew. He bats away the raised wand with a snarl, and punches the mousy man in the face.
‘Diagon Alley,’ Draco replied, looking up and casting an appreciative eye over Harry’s body, just like Hermione had done moments before.
Draco knows he should be humiliated, but as he shifts in his chair, feels the plastic dig in, his cock tries its best to stiffen in excitement and he knows it’s hopeless.
, wrap his thighs around that body and just bury his nose against Potter’s neck and breathe him in until he’s dizzy with the scent of him.
Draco shook his head, a slow smirk curling on his lips. ‘No. I’ll only be about an hour. But I do want you both to do something for me when I’m out.’
‘Let’s get started on this case, shall we?’ Potter says coldly, and Draco obediently picks up the first file and starts to read. They manage a full twenty minutes of silence, as their tea cups slowly empty and the DMLE gradually fills with Aurors and noise and chaos. Then Harry throws down the file he’s been reading and huffs in exasperation.
For a second Draco’s flashing silver eyes lit up as if he’d been offered the whole of Honeyduke’s in one go, then he schooled his face into that familiar, yet now unconvincing, look of boredom.
No. The Saviour of the Wizarding World, and the fallen ex-Death Eater? Harry couldn’t help the shudder that ripples through his body at the thought of the
Potter is huffing and puffing and sighing over his messy desk and his messy paperwork, his green eyes narrowing as he reads through the parchment forms and scrawls his untidy signature across them. Draco holds in his own sigh, working quietly alongside him.
Every joint in his body aches, like an old broken bone on a bleak winter’s morning. He tries to raise his hand to his throbbing head, but when he feels the bite of cold metal at his wrist, his eyes fly open in alarm and surprise.
As if it hadn’t been bad enough back when he was merely a repentant Death Eater, trying to survive after the war.
‘Potter,’ he pants, desperately, as Potter grinds against Draco’s stomach, his cock enormous and hard through his Auror uniform. ‘Harry,
He doesn’t need to be in here this morning, not really, but Potter has been sitting next to him, ignoring him - again - and being dark and brooding, and it’s all a bit too much. So, as soon as he had a big enough stack of files, Draco escapes to the quiet confines of his old sanctuary.
‘I’m sorry, Potter,’ he says, so quiet only Harry’s advanced senses pick up his words. ‘I’m used to this grunt work, at least, but you’re only having to do it because you’re working with me. As soon as you’ve proved to Robards you can work with anyone, you’ll be partnered up with a proper Auror and back on a real case before you know it.’
put our lives in danger over. We’re the two best bloody Aurors on this force, and together we will be unstoppable.’ Robards skin had turned ashy and pale, but he nods again, eyes wide, still as silent as if Harry had cursed him. ‘And finally, every Potions-related case comes straight to us. Did you know Draco was a master Potioneer? And yet you never told us, never let on we had a Potions expert in our midst. Not even when we were working that Squib-trafficking case. We could have solved that twice as fast with Draco on board, saved more of them.’ Harry could smell Robards’ guilt and regret now, sharp and stale on the air. Harry slowly got out of his seat. Draco’s hand fell from his arm, and Harry braced his palms against Robards’ desk, leaning forward and letting his wolf break free, just a little - just enough to force a tiny, panicked whimper from Robards throat. ‘And if you ever,
.’ Draco whined at his words, a tremulous, desperate sound, and together with the feel of Draco inside him, and Harry’s own hand on his cock, it pushed him over the edge. He closed his eyes, clenching around Draco’s slowly softening cock, and gasped as he exploded over them both. Stars burst behind his eyes, and his veins fizzed with his release.
Draco starts to feel like he’s gone ten rounds with a hippogriff when it comes to Potter’s mood swings. From the pub the other night, where Draco had thought they’d been burying the hatchet, maybe forging a new friendship, Potter had sunk into a familiar pattern of irritation, anger and occasional indifference towards him.
Harry was on his feet and halfway to the Floo before he was conscious of even moving. He grabs a handful of powder, meeting Hermione’s worried gaze as he calls out for the Ministry. He storms through the Atrium, taking the stairs instead of waiting for an elevator, his thighs barely burning as he takes them two at a time. He bursts into the DMLE, and straight into Ron’s arms.
Draco walked over to Hermione, his long fingers gently stroking along her jawline, forcing her head up to look at him. ‘Hermione, my good little girl,’ he purred, and Hermione melted inside. ‘All I need from you is to be naked and waiting when I get home. Can you do that for me, sweetheart?’ He trailed his thumb against her lips, and she licked it as she nodded eagerly, already feeling herself get wet at his words.
flares from his wand-tip, enveloping Potter in a protective bubble. Potter doesn’t seem to notice, and opens his mouth, speaking that strange, sibilant language instead. The Short-snout pauses, looks down, and slowly lowers its front legs to the ground.
‘We’ve been put on afternoon patrol of Diagon and Knockturn,’ Malfoy says, and Harry has to swallow down his groan. This was Robards’ doing, then - a chance to show off his pet guard dog, trotting along obediently by the reformed Death Eater’s side. Nevertheless, he pulls on his robes, runs a hand through his messy hair, and jerks his head towards the elevator.
A moment later Harry is back in control. He closes his eyes, summons all of his magic, and focuses. He brushes his fingers against Draco’s, letting the magic rush to meet him. His fingertips warm, and Draco gasps lightly as Harry’s magic flows through him.
‘Fuck, Harry.’ Draco moans, throwing his head back so Harry can scrape his teeth along that pale expanse of throat. He breathes in, relishing Draco’s scent, and for a moment the enormity of what they were doing, what they had become to each other, struck him. As the thought hits him, Draco curses and whispers Harry’s name again, desperately pushing back to take Harry even deeper into him. Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s cock as fire races through his veins and he feels a tension deep within him that meant he was seconds away from coming.
Harry snorts a laugh, not caring how inelegant Malfoy might find him. ‘I’m not irritable, Malfoy,’ he snipes, but he picks up the mug and takes a sip, ignoring Draco’s pleased smile as he drops the
,’ Harry snarls, anger flooding his veins. The Head Auror has kept Malfoy’s expertise a secret from all of them, then. He feels himself bristle, his wolf - earlier placated by the improved Wolfsbane - awake and aggressive once more. Harry’s magic flares at his fingertips, and he considers Apparating straight back to the DMLE, to charge into Robards’ office and demand to know why Malfoy has been overlooked and under-used time and time again.
Malfoy sits delicately back in his, sipping his own tea. Harry can feel him watching, and although he wants to be indignant, something about Malfoy providing for him, and watching him in concern, warms the wolf’s heart within. He decides the best thing he can do is ignore it, and pulls the new papers from his in-tray towards him.
Harry thrusts into Draco, burying himself right up to the hilt with one smooth, firm move. Draco’s eyes fall shut and Harry curses and drops his head into Draco’s neck, breathing in the tempting, faint scent of blood from his jugular, waiting for the starburst behind his eyes to fade away as Draco grips his cock, hot and tight.
Harry pushes away, panting. ‘I can’t wait any longer,’ Harry growls, his lips swollen and wet from eating Draco out. Draco gasps, and Harry sees the tears trickling from his eyes, the flush to his cheeks, the glistening leak of pre-come on his cock, and knows Draco is as desperate for Harry as Harry is for him.
Hermione takes time off work to be with Harry, while Ron goes in for a few hours the next morning, returning with a furrowed brow and dark circles beneath his eyes. When Harry asks what’s wrong, Ron smiles weakly and shakes his head for Harry not to worry. Harry sees him and Hermione share what they clearly think is a surreptitious glance at each other, but he doesn’t have the energy to care. Instead he slumps lower into the comfy, battered sofa in their living room, cold hands clasped around another cup of tea. The tea is laced with Wolfsbane Potion: the same one Draco had brought to him, made with his own hands, to ease Harry’s next full moon.
‘Seriously, Draco,’ Charlie murmurs in bed that night. ‘I’ve never seen anything like it. Harry is—’
Potioneer. This isn’t an ordinary Wolfsbane, I’ve added a few ingredients of my own. You should find it eases the irritability you’re feeling, as well as tasting a lot better than the usual stuff.’
Harry pulled away from Hermione, throwing a dirty look over his shoulder to Draco. Hermione was fairly sure he was about to mouth off, to bite out a bratty retort, but Draco just raised a commanding eyebrow and thrust himself deep into Harry.
‘Harry, don’t you da—’ Hermione’s words were cut off by a gasp of shock as her clothes disappeared, leaving her naked on the chair. She spun to look at Harry, his face split in a grin as he slowly thrust his hand over his cock again. He shrugged easily, his pecs flexing as he did, the picture of innocence.
Draco had been first in the office again this morning, and even though it was now well past ten and the rest of the Aurors were in, Potter was nowhere to be seen. Draco eventually gave up waiting for him, pulling his new paperwork towards him with a sigh.
It was only after he’s disappeared through the door that Harry realises he hadn’t scented any fear from Malfoy.
She shook her head, eyes stubbornly averted. She could hear him, hear the wet, lewd sounds of Harry’s fist working his dick. A whimper escaped her lips, and Harry groaned.
Harry reached down to take himself in hand, pumping up and down his shaft a few times, and Draco parted his legs further and leaned back on his elbows, his body open and inviting. The red lace was bright against the paleness of his skin, the heels of his boots digging into the bedclothes as he bent his knees slightly. Harry wanted nothing more than to climb between those luscious thighs and drench himself in the scent and the taste and the heat of Draco.
‘As soon as our shift is over,’ Potter whispers, his lips ghosting across Draco’s ear. ‘I’m taking you home and making you mine.’
to improve it. There is a formula that does the job, and in most people’s minds, that’s enough. You know better than me the prejudice the werewolf community faces. In all honesty, I doubt any potioneer has ever questioned the side effects, let alone thought about improving upon it.’
Harry slices one hand through the air, his curse wordless, and the witch crumples to the floor before she can take a step forward. With another careless flick of his hand, Harry easily sends the other wizard down as well. The magic needed to drop them, to fell them where they stood, was barely a drop from the pool of power Harry currently had at his fingertips.
‘Great,’ Draco mutters under his breath as he leaves the office, so quietly only Harry’s werewolf ears could pick it up.
It’s a standard test, and Draco and Charlie both have protective charms on the tip of their wands, ready to go.
He doesn’t expect him to turn on his heel and storm away from Draco’s desk, leaving behind only his the lingering scent of oak moss and anger. Draco watches with a frown, only turning back to his paperwork when he notices Weasley giving him a puzzled look from across the bullpen.
Draco shakes his head in despair, averting his eyes from the chaos to take another calming sip of his tea. He likes the DMLE early in the morning, when it’s just him and - usually - Robards in the office. Sure enough, when he looks over, he sees the Head Auror pacing back and forth in his office, seemingly talking to himself. Draco knows, from the tell-tale greenish glow in the room, that he’s more likely taking a Floo call.
Harry sobs, his whole body aflame. The lightest brush of Draco’s fingertip along his cock makes him shudder.
Harry manages to stifle his groan by biting his lip, tamping down the snarl of the wolf within. Malfoy doesn’t have the same compunction. He makes a disgruntled noise and leans forward in his chair, fixing his narrowed silver eyes on their boss.
Long, and lean, and wrapped in tight black trousers, tapering to his ankle where he wore a pair of black leather ankle boots with a high, thin heel.
‘Fuck, Harry…’ Charlie pants as he comes, and Harry breaks away from Draco’s lips long enough to grin cheekily at him. They’ve dragged him to their bed, after the Horntail incident. Charlie looks up, his eyes glassy and dazed, and Draco wants to cry with love for him and lust for Potter. ‘You’re… you’re…’ Charlie breaks off as Harry pulls him in for a long, burning kiss.
, and Harry is delirious with the intimacy, the trust, the way Draco’s thighs clench helplessly around his neck, the way his fingers pull his hair, the way he digs one heel into Harry’s back as if anchoring himself in place around Harry’s mouth.
Robards pulls a face, a flash of frustration betraying him. ‘We had this all under control!’ Robards snaps, a crack of magic whipping from him as he spoke. ‘There was no need for Malfoy to—’ As if realising he’s said too much, Robards stops speaking, his worried eyes snapping up to meet Harry’s.
By the time the evening rolls around, Harry is pacing the floor in Buckbeak’s old room, shirtless and sweating, as the wolf roils and growls within. He looks out of the window at the sunset, the soft, innocent shimmer of Auror-strength wards keyed to his wolf form glowing just inside the glass. He physically
Draco’s lips parted and his eyes fluttered shut as Harry’s finger reached his cock, slowly trailing down the shaft to the base. Harry took the opportunity to slide his body up along Draco’s, claiming his mouth with his own. He kissed him deeply, before breaking away and allowing Draco the chance to reply.
Hermione squirmed, not wanting to reply, and Draco tightened his grip on her waist to stop her moving.
Uniform kink, Hogwarts roleplay, roleplay, triad, established relationship, married life, Hermione x Draco x Theo
The farthest cauldron to his left bubbles ominously, and Draco turns to it, summoning his parchment and a quick-quotes quill. The liquid was iridescent, and the tell-tale blue steam was curling from the surface. Draco made a note of its appearance and waved his wand over the cauldron, casting a few more spells before letting a triumphant smile break through.
It had been all Draco could do to hold onto his magic and his cool, and not just come on the spot from the feel of Harry, broad and hard, pinning him in place. Their inspection at the Society had been carried out in awkward silence, Potter holding himself stiffly and carefully apart. He hadn’t offered to Side-Along back to the Ministry.
‘Might as well come over here,’ he said, tensing his stomach so his abs popped. Hermione couldn’t tear her eyes away, much as she tried. ‘Please, Hermione. Just — come and ride my face. Let me taste you. Draco doesn’t need to know…’
‘It turns out Malfoy was looking into you, Potter,’ Robards said, and Harry froze in place, looking at his boss. Malfoy was looking into
The three of them, Potter, Draco and Charlie, are trying to prep the Short-snout for transport, as it roars and rages angrily in response.
‘As for how I managed to improve it, tell me: did you never wonder what I did between Hogwarts and joining the DMLE?’
Harry just curls his lip in a snarl, and falls heavily into his chair as Draco chuckles. He pulls his wand from his holster and flicks it, and a cup of tea floated over and settled on Harry’s desk.
Harry looks over to him, intrigued. Draco is looking straight ahead, his white-blond hair brushed back, his dark blue Auror robes illuminating the paleness of his skin. He looks, just for a moment, like a wizard of old, Merlin or Salazar: powerful and irresistible. Harry’s wolf aches to rub his face against that sharp cheekbone, to nuzzle into the crook of that long, elegant neck.
Things do not improve when he realises he’s wearing a blindfold. He groans again, struggling feebly against the manacles at his wrists. They were chained behind his back, wrenching his shoulders into an uncomfortably awkward position. He was sitting on a cold, hard floor, smelling of dust and decay and abandonment. He couldn’t feel his wand anywhere on his body, and curses silently that he’d never practiced more wandless magic.
‘Potter.’ Malfoy answers the door, dishevelled and flushed with pride. The party rages on in the dungeon behind him. ’You aren’t exactly on the guest list.’
‘Draco!’ Charlie swept forward, pushing the others aside, and enveloped Draco into a bear hug, his broadness easily engulfing Draco’s slight frame. He smelled of fire and woodsmoke and the earthy scent that came with working outdoors.
‘Now,’ he gasped, and Draco froze in place, hips and hand and breathing stopped, as Harry sobbed and Hermione felt the warm wetness of his come pooling against the inside of her calf on the sofa cushions. Tears leaked from Harry’s eyes and he shuddered, his fingers releasing their grip on Hermione’s thighs.
"This trainee --" Draco reached past him to secure the paper chain to the headboard -- "just how fond of her are you?"
"No, but a day or two." Harry sighed. "Or maybe he's learned something and will apologize for dragging her into a fight with me."
"We'll need to be more circumspect this year," Draco confided, as they headed up the stairs. "I suggest we don't use them in Transfiguration at all, and probably not in Potions, either. Charms should be safe, if we're not disruptive."
He looked genuinely puzzled for a moment, and then a bit taken aback. "Muggle-born? You are, aren't you?"
"Not a dare," Sophia said. "Here's my example. Everyone needs to say something they admire about a member of the house that you have most disparaged. The best answers should demonstrate a trait of that house in some way."
"Oh, lovely! There's a marvelous new place down Fortune Row called the Grand Game -- you'd love the rabbit confit."
Draco looked around, and Harry did too, at the bright green moss, and dark green leaves, and creamy white blossoms. There was a bench under the arbor. A fairy thumbed her nose at them and dove under glossy foliage.
"I think you're an idiot," Ron said finally, but the statement was more blunt than cutting. "He loves you, and even I can see you love him. You'll be miserable, and for what?  Someone's approval, that's all."
"Yeah." Harry stood.  "Voldemort killed her dad, because he didn't manage to kidnap me. He does that sort of thing." Still clutching his other letter, he fled, going back to Gryffindor, and all the way up the tower to his own dormitory, where Sajid and Helen wouldn't follow. He didn't like Pansy in the slightest, but her grief
"All right." Sighing, Harry looked around. Hermione didn't seem to be present, and it wasn't quite too late to go out again. He turned around, and in tense silence, walked down to the Uncommon Room with Ron.
The next week continued nearly as awkwardly. Snape brewed most days -- for as much of the day as he could, Harry thought, emerging only when it was time for dinner or his bath. Harry didn't think he used anything but water, but if his hair was still greasy, at least he didn't smell. After two incidences of ruined potions, Harry and Draco began to plan for when dinner would be served, something they had previously done only when one or both of them had evening plans. With four hours' notice, Snape could time things effectively.
"Maybe." Ron leaned back, stretching his upper body back across the bed. His feet remained on the floor. Sometimes, Harry was startled to realize just how tall Ron was. "I know I overreacted," he said to the ceiling, "but I'm still sort of annoyed at you."
"The problem is," Harry said slowly, "that my friends can't deny the drinking, or the staying out late, or the sneaking out of school...."
"Well, it's.... He even pointed out it was a bit dodgy, but Draco's very good at Potions, you know, and he thought that we might be able to brew something protective from Red Cap parts--"
"A point," he said, walking towards Harry. "And don't think it hasn't occurred to me, after you came to me so readily during the trial. But I've thought about You-Know-Who, and the state of people like Malfoy and Nott, and I've decided I can do without that sort of favor." A few yards from Harry, he threw himself down on a wide cushioned seat that looked like a giant's footstool. It could have held half a dozen people if they all faced outward. Blaise leaned back, holding in one knee to balance. "So.  That parley. Did you track me here?"
Harry repressed a snort only out of a sense of the dignity of occasion. He looked towards Draco, expecting to share a moment of amusement -- surely no one would believe such tripe -- but Draco sat stiffly, lips pressed in a tight line.
"I know." Harry curled his legs in protectively. "I've been feeling guilty about it ever since, and I want to lift it, but I don't know what's likely to happen, or how to handle it, and I wanted advice on keeping her from telling."
Energy pooled in his bollocks, drew in, and shot out, as air shot out of his lungs, a shout he could no more have held in then he could have not come. He sucked a breath in and let it out, Draco sliding a hand up his stomach to keep him upright through the sudden drain.
"Oh, that." He wasn't sure what to say. Sometime in the last two years, Ginny had become very good at looking unimpressed.
"Hm. Well, consider this my vengeance for last spring.  I won't tease you nearly as thoroughly as you did me, I promise."
They slid the cylinder back in the wall and rejoined it with a repair charm, and moved further down. There was room for only one of them behind the bed.
"No grate," he answered, with a shrug. "But it's better when there are more people. Stand up for a moment, and I'll throw a Warming charm on the sofa."
Kissing was good, but very soon, it wasn't enough. Harry worked a hand between them to undo Draco's robes, and Draco immediately responded by sliding his hands up under Harry's jumper. Unease fell away in a surge of lust, and having opened Draco's robes, Harry went straight for the front of his trousers, and when he couldn't get them open, started working his hand under the waistband.
"Yes, but I think it's beside the point. With a disguised Death Eater teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, all the Muggleborns were in more danger than they realized, and with me as one of your research helpers--"
But then, the post owls arrived. Cornelia sat back, probably to wait out the chaos and resume, but a long-eared owl among the crowd swooped down to Harry.
It was still early, relatively speaking, when they entered the Gryffindor Common Room. Harry was pleased to see Hermione sitting by the fire with Ron. He went over to join them. Hermione didn't look up from the notes she was frantically scribbling, but Ron frowned as he approached.
Standing, Draco stretched again, lengthening his lean body. He wasn't as bulky as Sirius Black, but he was young, and quick, and a werewolf.  "Having made your plea," he said, "
After clearing his throat, Cartwright launched into a totally unnecessary review of what a Jobberknoll was, and listed wing feathers, feet, and beaks, seemingly about to continue with describing their use in memory potions.
Harry nodded into a shrug.  "Yeah. We're friends again, though. She says at least I didn't cheat on her."
Tonks frowned. Even her hair darkened slightly, streaks shading to maroon. "Do you think that's unbelievable for an Auror?"
Snape smiled thinly. "It is the only one that kills without a cause. There are many spells to do things that will cause death."
not one who would take offense, Granger," Gilbert retorted. "But even at this year's ball, I saw more than a few strident 'pureblood means pure' types at Malfoy Manor, and at least three people that I suspect are active Voldemort supporters."
, he decided, in one of those "Rumors" sections that Lavender sometimes read aloud in the common room. And maybe it had been; without Lavender around, he wouldn't know.
Harry considered that. "Anonymous testimony might work, if other things fall into place." He reached out. "Now, come and lie down again. I have an hour before--"
Malfoy nodded tightly and lifted his face. Harry stretched forward and kissed him. His lips were soft. Harry kept kissing him. From the soft moan that trembled around his lips, Malfoy didn't seem to mind. On the other hand, maybe he was just making his payment good. Harry pulled him closer, so their bodies touched as well. Malfoy gasped, and for a moment Harry was terrified he'd gone too far and given Malfoy too much of an advantage -- certainly the Slytherin must be able to feel the hard length of his erection -- but Malfoy, rather than taunting him about his arousal, began to grind against him. Harry doubted that was just fulfilling his end of the bargain.
Bending down, he breathed along the soft skin beside Draco's navel, and then below it. Draco's cock was half filled out -- swelled, but neither hard nor as long as it would become. Harry set his lips to it and dragged them down the length, feeling it rise beneath the touch.
"Predicting the future is unreliable from anyone, but seeing that which is present and hidden is another matter. I could guide you to someone of more skill."
"Actually, he did, although rudely." Linnet lifted one shoulder in a slight shrug. She had taken off her school robes, as she often did at gatherings, and now crossed her legs neatly at the knee, under the soft drape of a fawn velvet riding skirt. "I say we allow it, but next week he must say --
"Oh." Harry swallowed hard. He couldn't object to this. His self here wouldn't object. There wasn't any reason to, was there?  "Um...."
Harry found it unnerving to be suddenly in the role of the protected -- and he couldn't help but think of it that way -- but they were almost of a height, and it worked as well as the reverse position. It wasn't at all like being a girl, he decided, but it did make him worry that people would think Draco was in charge. Still, it was a relief to be claimed, and he could understand if Draco
"The boy has left," it said, in a harsh, but very human voice. "Reply immediately, whatever foolishness you may be engaged in, to tell me if he is with you or not. I cannot stay alone for long."
"Yes, of course. We discussed it frequently over the last year. Lucius feared the boy was too soft, and felt he should be brought in as soon as possible. I hoped to delay the matter until Draco had acquired more political independence, so I argued for after he left school, saying it would be awkward if Draco and I often vanished at the same time. I had believed I had persuaded him to at least wait until Draco was of age."
He gestured at the things on Harry's bed and then at the trunk. Books settled at the bottom, clothes folded themselves neatly and formed piles on top, and miscellanea clustered on top of the clothes.
"I must not tell lies," Snape read. "In something close to your horrific first-year penmanship. Tell me, Mr. Potter -- how did you get this?"
"You don't need anything here. Your skin is perfect." Eugene sat down in a second chair and leaned back.  "Let me see your legs."
Nodding, Dumbledore drew his wand and walked to the window, opening it to the cold January wind. He drew his wand, and in a few seconds, a short branch, freshly broken on one end, sailed in and landed on the floor.
"Yeah." Harry had to lean against him again, to breathe in his scent. "You died when I was fifteen. I barely knew you."
For a moment, Harry couldn't understand what she was talking about. He had been expecting her to ask about Millicent. She
"Oh?" Harry asked, interested. If there was a second spell that would enable them to control ghosts, he could--
"Any mention of Peter will damage our credibility, Harry. You must remember, he is known to be dead. Such a maneuver would increase our chances of losing the case without much hope of helping Sirius."
"Good night, everyone," he said as he got to his feet. To his surprise, most people stopped talking. Seamus looked over, his forehead creasing in a frown.
"Now...." Draco looked around. After a moment, he began to walk toward one of the windows. Harry followed, and watched Draco reach just behind the heavy white and gold drapes of one window and set the tiger deep into shadow. "There!" he said. "We can do a zebra on the other side. I'll show you how."
Whispers turned to mutters as he retreated to the boys' staircase. He was surprised to hear a few scattered people clapping, and looked over his shoulder to see if it was sincere or sarcastic. Cornelia gave him a respectful nod, and Parvati a beaming smile, and Seamus a grim-faced thumbs up, so at least some of them meant it. Harry smiled weakly and continued upstairs.  He had a Slytherin to apologize to, and he should do it now, so she could enjoy the rest of her party.
Hermione was coming in. Her eyes were clear, but her nose pink, as if she had just blown it. She looked accusingly at Harry and went and sat by the wall.
Harry yelped. It felt like he had jumped into a river. His jeans, shirt, tie, socks, and shoes turned to a thick liquid that poured down his body and away across the floor. He caught his wand out of reflexive panic at losing it. Before he could protest, the clothes resumed their original form, laid out like a police outline on the stone.
Severus wailed and spasmed, going rigid under Harry's body and Draco choked and recovered. Desperate to use his teeth, Harry twisted to bite his own arm.  As soon as his teeth closed, his brain and body flooded with white fire, and he hauled Severus in tight.
The cat shuddered all down its body, as if it had been picked up against its will and had just escaped. Madam Langston crumpled down in her chair moaning. Severus scowled. With a sigh, Harry leaned back, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Of course. I'm the girl, aren't I?" Malfoy shimmied out of the trousers and winked at Harry. "Now tell me how lovely I am."
?" Snape snarled back, and for a moment, Harry was able to glimpse Draco in fury -- beautiful, blood-flushed, turning so quickly that his hair floated out -- and then, in an instant, he was once again the Malfoy, self-possessed and light of tongue.
He stared. Then, unbelievably, his eyes closed, and stayed closed for several seconds, as if she could not be a danger.
didn't actually interview me, but it's the gist of what I told other people. Sirius was good to me. He didn't hurt any of us when he could have. I believe that he didn't do it, like he said."
"You're welcome," Harry said, accepting the vetted purse from Bulstrode and handing two coins back to Zabini. "And thank you for checking it, Bulstrode."
"Come on in, Harry," he said, stepping outside.  "Dumbledore jus' called for yeh -- he's waitin' inside. Mill, we'll be prunin' the apple trees, includin' some wi' bowtruckles in residence."
"Well, of course not! The entire idea is absurd.  You'd have no idea how to go about such a thing." Draco waved the matter off. "Anyway, I said no, of course, and he asked what else I could do, and I said I would tell the truth -- that got a laugh." His lips compressed for a moment. "I meant it," he said petulantly. "He doesn't understand. Father has a temper, and it sometimes overrides his discretion. It doesn't always, but I believe that arousing his anger is my best play, and the truth -- properly approached -- will do that. With luck, he'll
"That's a good point," Draco said. "Though he might think I should be able to handle it." He brightened. "I know! I could ask him to supervise my work. He would keep me from any fatal mistakes, I'm sure, and might even give me credit for the attempt."
Snape certainly looked annoyed, but not distraught -- or rather, in the sort of spitting fury that Harry imagined would cover for distraught in his case.
Indeed, as soon as everyone settled down, Professor McGonagall called Draco to testify. Harry was apprehensive, but at first, Draco hardly mentioned him. He talked about his father's expectations for him, and how he knew he was supposed to swear fealty to Lord Voldemort, and about the unusual summons home and the list of Dark curses that he was to study. Only then did he mention speaking to Harry, and Harry's insistence that he could get out of it.
Harry looked between them. Were they going to each talk readily to him and ignore each other? That would be horrible.  "Worse than that," he said. "I was just walking back with Remus when they were getting it down."
"Consider," Draco confided, leaning forward. "He signed up to serve Voldemort. Even if he didn't realize the man's madness, he did this
"Hold for a moment, sir," Draco said, coming to his feet, and motioning for Snape to stay back. "I don't believe this is the same Harry we were dealing with before." As Snape swept his robes around him and raised his nose, Draco took a step towards Harry's chair. "Stand up."
Draco shifted back, leaving Harry to answer. He supposed Draco might find the Gryffindor head of house intimidating.
They shook hands, and Blaise headed off down the street.  Harry watched him go with curious reluctance. How much of Blaise's association with him was due to owing him a favor? Would things be different now? On the other hand, Blaise had expressed a preference for Voldemort's defeat, and he was planning to come on Friday, so possibly not. Actually, Harry realized, brightening, Blaise had been anxious to be included, so probably things would not change all that much.
Harry twisted to look back. Snape was standing in the open doorway to the cavern. Harry grabbed one of his boots and tried to throw it at him, but the angle was bad. Snape coughed. Harry's back was suddenly cold as a hex pulled him forward and away from Draco. He rolled onto his back, unconcerned to be displaying himself.
Angrily, he started with Finch-Fletchley. He remembered Justin's open robes, and how he folded them over the possibly undressed girl.  He'd commented to Millicent that Finch-Fletchley needed to find better places to snog, and she had laughed and fallen silent until they were away. He went over it twice, concentrating on her laugh as the end, and then extracted the memory into the waiting vessel.
"I am glad to hear it." Dumbledore gestured at the Pensieve. "I suggest retrieving your memories. Thank you for sharing them with me, Harry; I am more reassured than I expected."
Snape sighed. "As the mistletoe is parasitic on oak, apple, and other trees of malleable bark, the Skyberry vine is symbiotic with -- visibly parasitic on, but also nourishing to -- mistletoe, but only on the tallest of trees. It grows out of the root juncture of the mistletoe in autumn, and rapidly rises through the host, in thin, translucent vines. When it reaches the top of the tree, the Skyberry vine bears clusters of blue berries that clarify with exposure to frost. As the days grow longer, it will die back, returning magical energy -- more than the physical sustenance it took -- to its host. And yes, in most of Scotland, mistletoe is not present. In the Forbidden Forest, however, it is fairly common. No one knows why, although theories include the influences of Bowtruckles, Centaurs, and past Potions professors." Snape smirked.
She nodded briskly.  "You'll tell us more in private, I expect. Tomorrow, after classes and before dinner?"
When they were safely out of trafficked areas, he stopped. "All right," he said, "I want to take you somewhere to talk. It's a secret, though; you need to promise you won't tell."
Harry lingered lower than usual, listening intently, but the Slytherins' uniforms stayed the same (slightly too bright) green. For the first ten or fifteen minutes, both teams played straight Quidditch, and Harry had risen a little higher by the first goal, which went to Gryffindor. Crabbe slammed a punishing Bludger at Ginny, who managed to evade it, but was forced out of formation. Harry went a little higher, waiting for play to move back toward the Slytherin goals.
"Well, let's keep that between ourselves, shall we?"  Harry suggested. The surreality of lunching with Snape was catching up with him. Snape had a flash of that young, sly look that Harry had seen during their lessons.
"Hm." Ron frowned up at the canopy. "Now I feel like I shouldn't be. Not if I'm going to be agreeing with Malfoy."
"Hm." Harry shrugged. "Not exactly inviting, but I suppose it will do." He led the way to his bedroom.
Draco snorted. Harry shrugged. "Let's make this explicit," he said. "You are required to stay with us for another day and night. That requirement does not include participating -- that's your choice, if we offer.  Furthermore, I forgive you for being an utter bastard to me when I was a child and had done nothing to deserve it. You've been treated like crap since the war, and I consider us even."
His eyes closing for a moment, Draco took a long breath. "Terribly Gryffindor of you," he said dryly, his face turning bland again, "but that, I believe, is a more important secret to keep. The chances of her reporting such an incident are far higher, although it would be done with your welfare in mind."
"Yes, yes," Dumbledore murmured, stumbling back and sinking into one of the chairs usually used by visitors. The paper was still in his hand. "How disheartening."
"Ah, that."  Dumbledore waved a hand. "I will let Professor Hecksban know that you may be allowed a localized armoring charm -- you have learned those, correct?"  At Harry's node, he produced a dark purple potion which he handed to Harry.  "Take a sip of this -- exact quantity does not matter, but it must go down in a single swallow -- at 4:00 every day. If you experience any difficulties -- for example, nausea or pain -- see me or Madam Pomfrey immediately."
"Understood." Draco peered into the basket.  "Before we start in on that, should we move downstairs? Or is there a reason to be here?"
Despite herself, she found that she liked this Harry.  "Really? I thought it was bold and Gryffindorish."
Zabini shook his head. "Care of Magical Creatures.  We can duck behind a rhododendron and no one should notice."
"And Draco Malfoy? Was that why you had his file out? I saw the HA. You were starting to write up an HD?"
"As far as that goes, yes," Susan said bravely. "Animal testing is appropriate for some things. Draco, had you expected…?" Even with the potion, she couldn’t continue. Draco shook his head.
Harry sighed and rolled his eyes, but he couldn't stop a glance at the clock. He wouldn't mind getting hormonal with his Slytherin right now, but it was far too late to meet, even if he could get Draco a message.
"Mrs. Weasley is in the area, you know. She worked at Beatrice's Bits and Bobs during the school year, and Beatrice wanted some extra help this week. She was hoping to speak to you."
Harry wondered if there was anyone he could stay with whom Voldemort wouldn't suspect. An older friend, perhaps? The problem was that he hadn't known most of the older students well enough to trust them with his life. Oliver, for example, was only his former Quidditch captain; Harry didn't even know if he was a pureblood or not, much less his thoughts on blood purity off the pitch. The only ones he could count on -- mostly -- were the twins. His thoughts spiraled down through a cataloguing of prospective hosts. It was only when he heard Percy's voice that he realized that they had reached the end of the morning session.
Draco frowned, but thoughtfully. "Yes, that would do.  It might even reassure some people. It's often said that you're too untouched by your past."
Harry escaped back up to the castle with his heart still pounding. It was impossible to sort out the last hour -- being caught, being bound (which, years after that incident with Voldemort, still held a menace that he could never have explained), almost being kissed, and then Snape's untimely entrance, and then Snape's cool threats and sudden reprieve. Harry was glad the professor hadn't thought to ask about Thornton, because he surely would have said that Harry's premeditated treatment of the boy was less excusable than Draco's binding of him.
"Which doesn't mean the consequences cannot still move against you if you invalidate the pact. No. Spend it on presents, if you must, but the silver itself should leave your possession only in a transaction from which you gain."
, when he's gone and I should be out of his reach. No, I do not feel I have failed or that your actions were inappropriate. However, I would like to move on to a soothing academic discussion, if we might?"
"Ah." That made sense, Harry realized. They would have needed to talk that out at some point. Still, it had probably renewed Hermione's anxiety to discuss his use of Dark Arts when he wasn't there to be reassuringly normal. "Well, when I confessed to Dumbledore, he pointed out that I'd learned two control spells--"
“Is this seat free, Susan?” Justin had stopped on the other side of her. His look was piercing, and Harry thought he and Susan might have seemed unusually intimate, in that moment. He leaned back.
Dobby reappeared at that moment, with a stack of neatly folded clothing, tied together with a wide red ribbon.
"I'll let the others grow more slowly," Draco decided. "They're more likely to last that way. Help me with the next one?"
Harry looked at her. For the first time, he wished Ginny wasn't there. "You remember last year," he said cryptically. "What I did."
After practice, Ginny started to ask him about something, but then, catching herself, turned to Cornelia instead. With a nod for them both, Harry left the pitch and cut across the brown grass toward Greenhouse Four.
"But..." Harry stared at them in turn. He'd known they were close, of course; that had been obvious from the start.
"Look." Ron's voice was steady, but his fingers twisted in the front of his jumper. "About Malfoy. You-- That wasn't what I agreed to help with."
"No need for regret." Draco set his head flirtatiously to the side. "Such things are created to be ephemeral. Though do wait until a few more people arrive."
Harry relented and let Draco pull the garment off of him, but as soon as it was clear, he brought his mouth down to where his hand had been, drawing his tongue along the subtle curve of one pectoral muscle, over nearly invisible fine hairs, and up to the sharp line of a collarbone, sucking at the skin there. Draco gasped and twisted under him. One hand gripped Harry's shoulder, but the other explored his broader chest.
Hecksban opened a package of colored chalk. Doodling a little house on the board, he continued. "Okay, let's say you've been sent out to a cottage that everyone says is cursed." He added jagged green grass in a line under the yellow house. It was a typical child's representation, with a peaked roof, a centered door, and two windows. "You check out the front door, and don't find anything. You open it and check out the door jamb, and something seems odd, but you can't pin it down and aren't entirely sure it's malevolent. What do you do?"
Harry would get himself killed approaching people whom he would regard as allies. He decided that if I'd been sent by a nymph, sex-magic would be the best way to reverse it...."
She nodded, looking close to tears. "I staked out his mooring at the marina, and I saw some crates moved onto shore. Usually, it's crates going on, and not much coming off. I followed them to an old warehouse on the Thames, but when I got inside, I didn't know which crates they were, so I started casting History charms on each stack. One in the third exploded. The mediwitch thinks the History charm combined with the reversive nature of the Jabberknoll to de-age me."
"Draco and I--" Harry realized his voice had risen and brought it down again. "I think our issues are more external. If it was just us...."
When he and Draco left, they went to see the Quiris. Harry couldn't quite approach them, but they didn't mind his presence, at a distance. He watched wistfully while Draco ran his fingers up the tufts of Tuktuk's ears.
, and you're a mongrel." As the word left her lips, she raised her hands defensively. "I'm not saying he doesn't love you; anyone can see it when he looks at you. But breeding is breeding."
"It's all right," Harry soothed, awkwardly aware of Snape's unsympathetic presence. "It's okay now."
Ron. Harry was just explaining to me that he didn't mind people laughing. I hadn't realized that you were one of those who had, but he is sincere, I can assure you."
"We certainly want to hire some of them! Malfoy, I was working with a trainee who was supposed to be Robed Saturday. She's great.  Intuitive, deductive, adaptable -- and she got hit by a freak interaction of half-dead Jabberknolls and a History trace on Friday night, and is currently ten years old. I'm furious! Zabini is dead; do you recall?"
It was over far too fast. Harry had to bite hard to hold in the noises his body wanted to make, and the world went black at the edges, narrowing to a section of skin and hair. Slowly, it widened again, and he realized he was lying limply on the ground, with quite a lot of mess in and over his robes.
"Crap!" she exclaimed. "Harry, that's horrible!" She spread the paper down to read with Neville. "Well, at least they didn't...."
"Not much," Draco agreed. "Still, it's idiotic of him to think that you will learn anything that way."
Ron laughed. "It's a damn good thing Pettigrew owed you a life debt. That would have been a nightmare."
"Harry." Draco's voice was mild, but chiding. "If he is to live with us, perhaps you might call him Severus?"
"I don't know." Draco gestured to a curl of parchment on the floor beside him. "I'd planned to take notes, but I could barely sit up."
"Not entirely." Harry bit his lip, remembering how frightening it was to discover that in the light of day. "It seemed to be a combination. I was taller there, and not as skinny, but...." He held his hand out. "This scar. I saw it the next morning, although it was fainter.  I cast a glamour while Draco was in the loo. I doubt a Slytherin would have that."
He couldn't make it clearer than that -- not without more thought -- but he raised his chin to Draco's glare. Eventually, Draco half-laughed, with a mild huff, and then shrugged the matter off.
"Can you not be more specific, Weasley?" Draco asked, uncurling enough to speak past Harry's back. He had attempted a mocking drawl, but it shook.
At another time, he might have been amused by Draco's play-acting. He sounded on the verge of hysteria when he first spoke. "Did you know this would happen?" he demanded, his voice rising.
"I don't know whether or not Dumbledore wants to control you. History has shown that he likes to have me loosely, but decidedly, in hand."
When they tried, the rock clattered from the rim of the Pensieve and thudded onto the leather pad, unharmed and uncursed. An uneasy silence followed.
Belatedly, he realized that Leroy was indicating the older man, and redirected his attention. The photo had been taken from one side and slightly behind him, so his face only showed when he turned. His features were bland and jowly, and the sleeve of his robes dark grey.
"Eh, I asked her to take a message to Hermione for me.  She bargained for it, or-- Oh. I suppose it was more that she demurred until I made an offer."
The entire class was silent. Harry thought they had probably all forgotten how intimidating Snape could be.
Caught in mid-step, Parkinson toppled. Dark orange curselight passed over him as he fell. Harry scooped up his own wand, training it where the spell had come from, but it was Snape who darted out of the shadows.
"Oh." She got what he meant, suddenly. Now that she thought about it, Cho had been rather flat.  "I expect she'll, um, grow more."
"Harry!" she exclaimed, setting her chin on one hand and batting her eyelashes at him. "Did you come to see me?"
. He knew he'd be everyone's whipping boy, whether he admitted it to himself or not. He was not only putting himself below the Dark Lord, but below people like my father."
the only woman that you seem to have a private understanding with, and I can't rely on you to evaluate social considerations on your own."
"Exactly!" Hecksban cheered. "As you, Draco -- and Ron there -- might find that you set off a 'purebloods only' curse in Senegal or China, or the Patil twins might here."
Harry struggled to hold back his release, determined that Malfoy would come first, that he would feel with his cock that fierce clench he had felt on his fingers. He didn't have long wait. Malfoy curled into his thrust, taking him deep, and then wailed, the sound rising high and spurring Harry on.
Harry smiled. Dumbledore was currently wearing purple and silver robes with silver embroidered stars all over them, and long tassels on the sleeves and collars. More sedate was a given. "I'll keep that in mind, sir."
"Ah -- as a cover, really. It's the other thing I'd definitely need if I was actually making healing potions."
Harry immediately pictured Seamus peering suspiciously into a glass of white wine. "Almost certainly."
The rest of the evening went smoothly. Harry found Draco's mother more amusing than he had expected, although some of her humor showed calculation behind it. He doubted he would have liked her before learning to get along with Blaise. At other points, though, she seemed entirely moved by whimsy. When the House Elf finally brought dark chocolate mouse, he accepted a small glass of sweet wine with it, as it had been hours since the first. Dinner was apparently all there was to the evening; it was difficult not to yawn as Narcissa led the way to another wing, and then upstairs. Draco pointed out the door to his room as they passed, and Narcissa pointed out that she had set alarms against nocturnal visits. She could have been lying, Harry thought, as he climbed into the downy warmth of the waiting bed, but before he could plan an investigation, sleep had stolen the choice.
"Hey." Ron slipped into the seat next to Harry.  It was Wednesday after dinner, which Professor Hecksban declared would be the time for the Pensieve study. The professor had arranged the chairs on a temporary dais in a half circle around the cursed object, and Draco was pacing at the back of the space he was sharing with the Cursebreaker. "Think it will be exciting?"
"Really? I thought you said the Coltsfoot would be 'odoriferous' in use." Harry had found the word hilarious, but also rather endearingly Draco.
The corner of her mouth quirked, and then settled. "Yes. Soft metals are much easier to work."  Her piercing gaze fixed him to the spot. "If it is
When Draco finally emerged, he was so quiet about it that Harry didn't notice until he was quite close.
than the Imperius curse, because he made her speak Parseltongue, and that would be like making a Squib do magic. Really, she didn't open the door --
"Lily wasn't willing to risk it too far into the pregnancy, actually," Remus volunteered. "The source spell we built on advised casting before the seventh month, and she insisted it be by the fifth."
was even more disconcerting, but there wasn't blood -- which he had apparently been afraid of, as he had looked for it -- and he felt more normal afterwards, as he continued up to Gryffindor.
"What's that like?" asked a younger kid eagerly, leaning on the back of the couch behind the fifth years. After a moment, Harry placed him as one of the kids he hadn't turned into a frog in Horsyr's classroom. Seldon? No, Seymour. He'd be a fourth-year now. "It sounds creepy."
Harry wondered if this place by the fire was to be for that. "There's an organized group of people -- ones who might show up to defend against Death Eater attacks, or to investigate their plans."
"Agreed," Draco said. "We have a considerable volume of the substance to experiment on, and I can get use of one of the potions labs, although not a key to the supply cupboard." His sour mood lifted into mischief. "Who's up for some investigative potions work on a Saturday morning?"
Harry backed off a fraction, but not enough to tease. He set up a rhythm of even blows, letting Draco adapt to it, watching for the muscles in front of him to relax in acceptance. There he paused for a moment, stroking Draco's hot skin and kissing the back of his neck. He remembered Snape and snuck a glance in that direction, finding the man wide eyed and shifting slightly in his seat. He kissed Draco again. "Harder?"
Draco twisted to face Blaise. The three of them were sharing a sofa, which now felt extremely awkward, roomy as it was. Draco pressed back into Harry, and Blaise was pressed back against the arm.
"Why? We were friends in June. I haven't done anything since then." Draco's voice grew sharp. "Did she expect letters?"
"Lie down, Harry," Malfoy said softly. Even through his enhanced lust, Harry was surprised to hear his name.
In the afternoon, they went back to the Slytherin dormitory, where a wave of Malfoy's hand sent the other seventh-year students scattering to suddenly remembered study sessions. Malfoy put a mild hex on the door and turned back to Harry.
"Here," he said, lifting it up from what appeared to be a fuzzy copy and handing the original back to Harry. "Draco may look on with you, and I will make any necessary notes on the duplicate."
They walked back to Gryffindor together -- with a detour to the kitchens, where the house elves happily gave them extra cake from dinner.
Harry nodded. He supposed he cared in some way, because he felt a background dread lifting at the news.
Back at the common room, Harry was greeted only by Hermione, who sat by the fire, working on her seventh page of an essay that was only required four pages. “Ron’s been dragged off to test some of Fred and George’s newest creations. And I mean dragged.” Harry could already imagine the torture Ron was enduring at that very moment. “Are you okay, Harry?” She asked, noticing how off his normal attitude seemed off in a way that she couldn’t put words to.
The next day, on their way to Charms class, the trio passed Malfoy and his gang. Besides an angry glare and a quick thought to get on his knees and beg Draco for forgiveness, the effects of his passing were minor. Pansy, who was carrying Draco's things, stuck out a tongue at them before grinning and getting closer to her 'boyfriend.' In Charms, as Flitwick watched them do their summoning charms, Harry and Hermione chatted. "So... Malfoy? You're into," she leaned closer and whispered, "guys?" Harry just shrugged. He still wasn't completely sure. He was into a guy, but also multiple girls had caught his eye. He brought the quill across the room to him, getting words of approval from the Professor.
The Yule Ball arrived faster than anyone was prepared for. Harry had no idea what to expect, he’d never been to a ball before. On the walk to the Great Hall, he ran into his date. Harry had barely even processed that Draco was there before their mouths were connected, Draco’s hands holding his hip, pulling his close. He wasn’t sure if anyone else had been around and seen, but he couldn’t find it within himself to care. Neither could Draco, although he was the one with powerful, hateful parents, the one who should be worried about them even being seen together. There was no question that Lucius Malfoy loathed him, probably as much as Pansy did, but for very different reason. Harry felt a bit dazed at the sudden, and unexpected, kiss.
‘I told you not to come,’ Harry growls into Draco’s neck, his hands wrapped in his his hair, his body pressed close to him.
Robards and Shacklebolt are the only people who know about Harry’s condition, outside of the Weasley clan, after all. And Harry knows he should be grateful - being bitten hadn’t lost him his job, the way it would have for probably anyone other than the Saviour of the Wizarding world. But still, the implicit suggestion that Robards doesn’t
‘That was close. Wonder what they were looking for me for?’ Potter falls quiet, a frown creasing his forehead, then looks at Draco and scratches the back of his head. ‘Back to the office to report it?’ he murmurs awkwardly.
Draco smirked, reaching down to cup the bulge hidden beneath the knickers. ‘I thought you were unkillable, Chosen One,’ he taunted, with a little bit of the old, familiar bite to his tone. Harry grinned darkly in response, a thrill shivering through him at that ghost of old antagonism rising to the surface.
can be used to great effect, before she cancels the charm and instead locks him up in a Muggle contraption, like a renaissance princess the night before her wedding.
‘How did it happen?’ are the words that push themselves out of Draco’s mouth, without his express permission. He winces internally as Harry’s eyes darken and he gets a feral look to him. A split second later he’s composed himself again, and throws a rueful glance at the permanent
Harry tried not to stare, as Draco took a deep drag on the gillyweed joint, blowing out a slow curl of blue smoke from his delectable mouth. He caught Harry looking at him, raised a lazy eyebrow, held out the joint.
And with that Potter was gone, storming out of the DMLE with Weasley trotting after him like a worried lap-crup, leaving Draco alone at their paired desks with nothing but a stack of case files to occupy him.
. Pansy melted away, and Malfoy turned his insolent gaze on Harry, a flash of silver in the subdued dark of the bar.
For a fleeting moment, he could only feel horror, settling on him like a dead weight. How — Who —? A second later the world sped up again and his wolf pushed forward in anger, and Harry knew instantly.
‘How is my little caged prince?’ she whispers against his ear, standing up on her tiptoes so she can reach him.
Pansy sniggers from the drinks trolley, where Draco is mollified to see she’s at least serving up a healthy helping of Firewhisky. With a lazy flick of her wand, the tumbler floats through the air into Draco’s waiting hand.
Draco is still watching him, until Harry sees him look away from the corner of his eye. He bows his head, white-blond hair falling into his eyes.
Draco’s eyes are closed, his forehead sweaty. Harry reaches down and takes his cock in his hand, and Draco groans and writhes helplessly beneath him, unable to move too much while impaled on Harry’s dick.
The murmuring stopped, and a scurry of feet towards him made Draco cower back against the wall. A rough hand pulled away the blindfold, and Draco blinked uncomfortably in the sudden brightness.
‘I love that you love the Burrow,’ Harry mumbled against Draco’s cheek, his voice already tinged with tiredness.
Instead Draco shrugs, easily, as if he doesn’t care either way. ‘Suit yourself, Potter,’ he says, bringing his own, unlaced cup of tea towards himself. ‘But I happen to be an
. She ached to look over at him, to watch him, but it would be too much. Instead she stared blankly at the parchments, as she slowly got hotter and wetter and had to press her thighs together against the desire to touch herself.
. Draco tears his eyes away before Potter notices him staring, looking blankly down at his own paperwork. Another half an hour and he could leave, able to hurry back to his flat and wallow in his loneliness.
He could hear low murmurs around him, and knew it was the dark wizards he’d faced off to earlier. He remembered being hit by a Stunner - like an idiot, he hadn’t raised his
Harry’s wolf didn’t understand, driven simply by instinct and pure, animal want, and surely it was just that side of him that felt this…
‘Bedroom,’ Harry gasped, and Draco hummed in agreement and let himself be led up the stairs. They stood chest to chest in Harry’s bedroom, the detritus of his life scattered around them, and Harry moved forward just enough to feel Draco’s breath on his skin. He ached to taste him, wanting to know whether he was going to taste the Firewhisky they’d been drinking, if his lips were as soft as they looked, if the tongue stud, that he’d seen flashing silver as they talked at the bar, would be cool against his own tongue.
‘Can’t have that, can we, Malfoy?’ Theo replied, walking forward more slowly, loosening his own tie as he did. Hermione bit her lip as she looked at them both, already feeling the lust curl through her body. ‘How about we help you with your
‘You’re going to tell me when, Potter,’ Draco said firmly, and - not for the first time - Hermione admired the level of control he held, even as he was fucking Harry, even as his eyes travelled over Hermione’s naked body sprawled before him.
Draco’s lips press desperately against Harry’s chest. ‘Yes, Harry,’ he gasps. ‘Yours. I’m yours. However you want me.’
The letters come twice a day. Thick, expensive parchment, elegant emerald ink, a familiar seal in green wax. At first, hurt and angry and heartbroken, he sends the owls back, or snatches the envelopes and engulfs them with a blazing
‘Robards wants us to carry out an inspection today.’ Draco finally speaks, not looking at Harry as he does. He sets his paper cup carefully on the coaster on his desk, his own in-tray pristinely organised. Harry grunts in response as he reads over the memo in Robards’ neat handwriting.
Pansy’s dark eyes are sparkling wickedly as she looks at him over the rim of her glass. Her lips are as red as her drink. ‘Might as well make the most of it, Draco,’ she smiles. ‘Imagine the possibilities: late nights together, bonding over case work, the adrenaline of catching bad guys together leading to incredible sexual tension…’
dinner!’ Molly’s attention snapped to Harry, whose innocent green eyes did nothing to belie his bulging cheeks and the smear of pink icing on his lips. He held his hands up in mock surrender, his eyes alight with laughter, and swallowed the pilfered cake.
Harry is so caught up in his maelstrom of thoughts and feelings, he doesn’t see the hooded figures until it’s almost too late.
The dark possessiveness, the golden tint to Harry’s eyes, the way his canine teeth were just a little
Harry laughs and gently grips Draco’s chin, pulling his face up for a long, languorous kiss. ‘Coming right up, my lord,’ he replies sarcastically, secretly pleased to hear Draco laugh as Harry reluctantly climbs out of bed.
Harry grimaces, and steps into the kitchen where Ron pushes a bottle of Hogsmeade Brewery Ale into his hands.
After dinner, everyone slowly bundled from the scarred wooden table in the dining room to the mismatched, squashy sofas in the living room. Harry fell into the battered blue two-seater, pulling Draco down easily after him so they tumbled together in a sprawl of limbs, the broken springs of the sofa tipping them into the middle. Ginny reached out and ruffled Draco’s hair as she passed, skipping out of reach with a laugh as he grouched at her and lifted his hand to his head.
Almost instantly he goes dizzy with desire, closes his eyes and lets his head fall back beneath the pounding stream of hot water. His thoughts fly to Malfoy, to his sharp jawline and long neck, his hard body and his scathing eyes. In Harry’s mind Malfoy watches him, his eyes narrowed and that familiar, infuriating smirk on his lips. Harry’s wolf growls, with a combination of lust and fury, and Harry pulls harder at himself, the sounds of his actions echoing under the splash of the water. Imagination-Malfoy walks closer, his eyes darkening, and a moment later he’s naked in Harry’s mind, all marble-white skin and lean muscles and insouciant arrogance. Harry groans and comes, embarrassingly fast, over the tiled wall before imagination-Malfoy even gets to run a single finger down Harry’s chest. He disappears into the steam with a knowing grin, and Harry growls and turns away, grabbing the shampoo and ignoring the sight of his seed disappearing down the drain.
‘You stay right there, Potter,’ Draco warned, and Harry whimpered. ‘I’m going to make you come now,’ Draco added, and Hermione watched as a slow, wicked smile curled on his luscious lips. ‘But you’re not going to enjoy it.’
Potter turns his head to watch them pass, and Draco feels Potter’s nose nudge the back of his neck. His fingers at Draco’s waist contract slightly, and stroke across the expanse of Draco’s stomach. Draco’s heart stutters uncomfortably as he shivers beneath Potter’s touch.
It’s Potter’s second month at the reserve, and by now his green leathers are beaten and burned, just adding to his rakish good looks.
Harry sighs happily as he walks into Hermione and Ron’s house, instantly feeling the tension melt away. Hermione was the other member of his pack, her presence grounding her almost as much as Ron, and Peaseblossom Cottage was as much his home as Grimmauld Place. Harry has a tiny bed in the tiny spare room at the cottage so he can sleep over every so often. He often struggled at Grimmauld Place, as he was usually by himself in the cavernous old house. He slept much easier when he was enveloped in the scents of safety, could hear the steady breathing of his pack mates in the house.
Malfoy just arches his eyebrow at him and makes a show of brushing down his Auror uniform. ‘You really are an animal, aren’t you, Potter?’ Malfoy drawls, before walking past him, knocking him in the shoulder as he does.
Draco just raises his eyebrow at Potter over the edge of his own file. ‘Of course not, Potter,’ he says as gently as he can, as if he was explaining something to his young cousin, Teddy. ‘Robards isn’t going to trust us with anything important while we’re an untested partnership.’ He gives Harry a hard look, and Harry seems to physical expand, as if he were a dog putting up his hackles. He snarls silently in Draco’s direction. Draco’s skin prickles uncomfortably, but he doesn’t look away from Potter.
Harry and Hermione sit together in the little front room of Peaseblossom Cottage, a magical fire burning merrily in the grate. Hermione is curled up in her favourite armchair, with Crookshanks in her lap and a well-worn book in her hand. Harry lies sprawled on the sofa, cradling a long-cold cup of tea and staring miserably out of the window.
‘I want you a bit better behaved than normal by the time I get back,’ Draco said, and Hermione bit her lip to hide a grin. Harry was certainly a brat around their dom, always pushing Draco’s control as far as he could. ‘So, Potter. An hour of edging should do, I think. You’ll be desperate and begging and an obedient little slut by the time I’m home, don’t you think?’
‘Eyes on me, Granger,’ Draco insisted, cradling her jaw and pulling her back to his silver gaze. ‘Not on that reprobate over there.’ Harry groaned from the sofa and Draco smirked. ‘Now, you wanted to come so badly you couldn’t wait. So: make yourself come.’
Draco gives him a bemused look, raising an eyebrow as he takes an elegant sip of his own tea. ‘How long ago were you bitten?’ he repeats, slowly and carefully, as if speaking to a dullard.
As if his words are enough, Draco groans and pushes into Harry’s fist, as hot ropes of come burst from him, covering both their stomachs.
A flurry of movement, and Hermione was in Draco’s arms as he carried her to the sofa. He held her cradled in one arm, waving his wand to release Harry’s
Draco gulps and nods hastily. ‘Okay,’ he agrees, billywigs starting to flutter madly in his stomach. He’s been to Muggle London before, of course, with Pansy, but Potter is giving him a skeptical look nonetheless.
‘Do you like to be fucked?’ Harry asked, trailing one finger slowly down Draco’s stomach, relishing the soft groan his touch elicited. ‘Or do you prefer to do the fucking?’
‘Come here,’ Draco said to Hermione, and she followed him to the table. He sat in her seat, legs spread, and patted one long, lean thigh in encouragement. ‘You want to come, sweetheart? On me.’ Hermione hesitated, looking down at the pristine blue material.
He looked gorgeous, and Hermione squirmed in her seat at the table, work forgotten in front of her, as she ached to run her fingers over him.
He steps into the Floo, idly wondering if Robards’ would let him get away with booking a week’s leave, but when he steps out into his house at the other end, he has an even better idea.
Harry rubs his nose carefully against Draco’s ear. ‘Where does it hurt?’ he asks quietly, his fingertips already tingling with healing magic, ready to be let loose.
‘It’s not okay, Malfoy,’ Harry says, feeling upset now, his wolf whining unhappily at the thought of Malfoy -
Lean and hard, with lily-white skin criss-crossed with silvery scars that made Harry’s heart clench with guilt. The guilt was momentarily wiped away as Harry’s eyes were drawn to Draco’s nipples, pink and tempting, and the glint of silver at each from the bars that ran through them.
She turned to the stacks behind her, smiling as she pulled a book free. She didn’t think she’d ever get used to the fact that the Manor library was
‘See, Potter,’ Draco murmured, reaching back around to grasp hold of him, Harry gasping against Hermione’s cunt. ‘You
, Malfoy?’ Harry snarls. He manages to tear his eyes away from Draco’s succulent forearms just in time to see the hurt that flashes across his partner’s face. He feels an uncomfortable twinge of regret but pushes it back down as Draco pushes the emotion back off his face.
Ron’s worried look didn’t fade. ‘Still, mate, that’s not good,’ he said, finishing his cup of tea. ‘D’ya want me to get an Auror team to patrol the street? Keep an eye on things?’
First the drinking of it, then the spinning of the empty bottle, with the whisperings of the other eighth years echoing around.
They walk into the second floor girls’ bathroom. Beneath a banner reading ‘Happy Deathday Myrtle!’ a sobbing ghost hiccoughs with joy when she sees them.
He turns on his heel again, stalking across his self-imposed prison, and freezes in place when he hears the slightest creak of a floorboard down the corridor. A second later he smells it - Draco’s delicious, familiar scent. His wolf whines in anticipation and relief, and Harry is in Draco’s arms before the door to Buckbeak’s room even closes back behind him.
‘Where are you off to?’ Harry spoke up from the sofa. He was sprawled on his back reading Seeker Weekly, wearing his old Gryffindor Quidditch joggers and a grey t-shirt pulled tight across his muscled chest and stomach.
He falls back to Draco’s mouth, kissing him with all the fire and fury that races through his veins. They kiss until they are breathless, drinking in each other’s air to breathe. Draco is pliant and warm beneath Harry, his body hard and eager. With a growl of impatience, Harry waves his hand and a heartbeat later, they are both naked, Draco’s skin soft and smooth and tempting. Draco’s eyes flutter open and he looks up at Harry with a mixture of adoration and exasperation in his gaze.
‘Some people know,’ he says, quietly, defensively. ‘Just not that many,’ he admits, dropping his hand from his shoulder and sighing. ‘How did you guess?’
She whimpered helplessly, her legs unfolding for her, carrying her body over to the sofa, to where Harry’s body, sticky with sweat and hot with desire, lay waiting for her.
Draco, licking him, letting his tongue curl into him, opening him and preparing him until he’s sure Draco is more than ready for him.
The parchment smells like Draco: heat and spice and longing. Harry is instantly transported back to the archives, the helplessness he’d felt in Draco’s presence. The hard, warm, pliancy of Draco’s body, his
Harry looked up from his chest, and Draco raised a challenging eyebrow. ‘I’d like that,’ Harry agreed, and Draco’s expression softened. ‘In fact, let’s start tomorrow. Brunch on Diagon? My treat?’
‘Always,’ Harry murmured, and he pushed them into the Floo, throwing down the powder and whisking them away.
For a moment Draco is sure Potter is going to retaliate, and he braces himself for the deluge of his anger. But Potter just sighs, aggressively. ‘Fine,’ he snaps, snatching up his travel mug from the detritus of his desk. ‘Let’s make this as easy as possible. I’m going for another tea. You stay here.’
Draco marvels to himself how they had got to this point, where Draco gets to see Harry in the form no-one but his closest friends and family knew about, and Harry feeling comfortable enough with Draco to fall asleep by his side.
And really, just because Draco was clever and funny and kind, in his own way, and incredibly good-looking and utterly
Horror trickles over Harry like a Disillusionment charm gone wrong. He looks up at Hermione, knowing her ashen face and wide eyes were reflected by his own. For a moment neither of them move, suspended in the sticky flow of panic, then Hermione gasps: ‘Harry,
Harry looks at the ground, his shoulders hunched. He tries not to do that anymore, knowing it makes him look even bigger and more hulking and intimidating than usual, but Malfoy’s words have hit a nerve. He tries to harden his mind to werewolf discrimination, and focuses back on Malfoy when he speaks again, breathing in deeply the familiar scent of spice that lingers around him.
Draco listened to the whole tale with a serious expression and thoughtful silver eyes that darkened at all the right moments. Harry found himself opening up about more than he planned, down to describing how irritable the Wolfsbane Potion made him.
Draco’s heart stops in his chest, but a fearless figure jumps in front of Charlie, arms raised, and challenges the dragon with an angry hiss.
- being so ill-treated. ‘When we get back, I’m going to talk to Robards. We’ll get you set up properly, consulting on any of the Potions cases, leading on the big ones. And you need a proper partner! You’re wasted on patrols and paperwork, you should be in the field. You’re a good Auror, Malfoy,’ he continues, a little desperately. He can’t stop thinking about Malfoy getting a partner, a real partner, after Robards’ little experiment with them is done, and the thought is doing funny things to Harry’s heart. Making it weigh more, and beat a little heavily, and causing his wolf to howl mournfully, as if losing something dear to him.
‘Look, Potter,’ he sighs, throwing the file onto the table. ‘We have to work together on this, and do a good job, to get what we both want and be moved back onto real cases. So let’s stop this posturing, shall we, and be professional about this.’
Pettigrew whimpers, his eyes wide, and stumbles backwards further. ‘We didn’t — he wasn’t part of the —
It stretches across his chest, dark and possessive, from his sternum to his shoulder, tilted as if the axis of the world is askew.
‘What’s this?’ Harry says shortly, eyeing it suspiciously. A familiar, faint blue smoke emanated from the surface, and when he breathes in he catches the familiar scent of Wolfsbane. He gives Draco a sharp look. ‘I already take this,’ Harry reminds him, not wanting to utter the words out loud in the bullpen. Draco waves his wand again, and a low buzzing of a
, fuck,’ Draco muttered weakly above him, and Harry smiled around his dick and slid his mouth deeper onto him. Draco’s cock pushed against the back of his throat, but he breathed deeply through his nose and focused. He bobbed his head up and down a few times, Draco gasping each time the flared head of him breached Harry’s throat, before pulling up so his lips were just around the tip.
Draco is almost dizzy with lust, and whimpers helplessly as Potter claims his mouth once more, with an urgent, passionate fury.
Harry became aware of an uncomfortable silence in the room. Ron sighed, looked up, frowned. ‘Harry. Malfoy never came back.’
‘And no touching, Granger. Yourself, or him.’ Hermione tore her eyes away from Harry’s wanton form, gulping and nodding.
Harry pushed up against Draco’s body, capturing his mouth in a searing kiss as he wrapped his hand around Draco’s cock, already starting to get hard again. ‘Good,’ he growled against Draco’s sweet, smirking lips. ‘Because now I’ve had you, I’m never letting you go.’
‘Nothing,’ Malfoy replies, shortly. ‘I know there’s some bad blood in our past, Potter, but I thought we’d both outgrown that by now. You’re my partner, in case you haven’t noticed, and I want us to do well on this case together. I didn’t realise your…
Draco shifts, his chest brushing against Harry’s. He flexes his arms, his eyes flitting down to look at his body before snapping up to Harry’s bright with wonder.
: empty Firewhisky bottles lie discarded in the empty eighth year common room. A cigar stub smoulders in a crystal-cut ashtray.
‘Something on your mind, Potter?’ he asks idly, his gaze already back out on the to-ing and fro-ing around them.
‘Couldn’t wait?’ he manages to say with a modicum of condescension, making Harry grin. He reaches down and kisses the tip of Draco’s nose.
‘I’ve been watching you all night, Potter,’ Malfoy said, as he looked at Harry’s lips and reached up to stroke a long, elegant finger down his cheek. ‘About time you came over.’
Not even bothering to take off his cloak, Draco makes his way to the library, the Manor echoing quietly behind him. His mother is in her wing, somewhere, rattling around like she’s already a ghost. His father is in Azkaban, never to be released. Other than the pair of employed house-elves who live-in, the once-grand Manor stands empty. The library is still as impressive as always, clean and quiet. The books themselves are all protected by preservation charms that keeps them dust-free, and it doesn’t take very long for the elves to clean and tidy the room itself once a week.
Potter gazes at him, something battling in his face, and for the first time when facing him, Draco truly feels like prey.
His own parents had died after the war. Lucius was sentenced to the Dementor’s Kiss following his war crimes, and Narcissa died from a broken heart soon afterwards.
As Draco looks up at Harry in wonder, his last thought, before he faints, is that maybe he’s already dead, and an avenging angel has come to redeem his meagre life.
‘You’re insufferable sometimes,’ Harry grumbled into the space between their lips, although his arms held him close and firm, and his nose nuzzled gently against Draco’s cheek. ‘But I love you.’
‘Not here, Malfoy,’ he says in a low voice, then shakes his head as if he can’t believe what he’s going to say next. ‘You want to — I dunno, grab a beer after work? Somewhere Muggle - then you can ask all the questions you want.’
Harry took the joint and tossed it onto the table, pushing Draco back against the wall, hard beneath his palms. Harry’s lips hovered a breath away from Draco’s, so close he could practically lick the traces of gillyweed from his mouth.
They kiss, wildly, angrily, a snarl rising in Potter’s throat even as he engulfs Draco. Potter’s body presses against Draco, his hands clenching in his shirt, his mouth hot and eager, and Draco claims him in return, running his hands over the muscled torso, reaching up and wrapping one in Potter’s messy, wild hair.
He honestly hadn’t expected, when casually bringing up Harry being a werewolf outside Flourish and Blotts, that is was a
In frustration, it seems, Harry takes a determined step forward, a lone figure facing a rearing beast.
‘You coming, sweetheart?’ Harry said, already turning his body in the direction of the living room, where the cheerful raised voices of assorted Weasley family members could be heard. Draco shook his head, already lifting one of Molly’s spare aprons down from a hook. ‘I’ll be through later, okay?’
Marble-white skin, silvery criss-crossing scars, ridges of muscles rippling over his flat stomach. And the crowning glory: Draco’s cock, long and hard, blush pink and beautiful, a pearly drop glistening at the tip. It rises above his stomach, begging for Harry to lick it, to suck it, to finally taste Draco properly.
Draco has gone oddly quiet, and Harry can see the faint pink flush to his cheeks. He remembers thinking that Malfoy was too arrogant to take a partner, but now wonders whether anyone had even ever offered. Harry’s wolf whines unhappily, and Harry has to fight not to lay a comforting hand on Draco’s arm. Instead he stands up, abruptly, making Draco look at him in surprise.
‘Coming, darling!’ he called out, purposefully light and cheerful, breaking into a chuckle when he heard Harry’s rumbling of discontent in response.
It wasn’t the first time Draco had forced him into a ruined orgasm, and Hermione was certain it wasn’t going to be the last.
‘Don’t try to talk,’ he commands gruffly, but his voice is gentle. ‘I’m going to Apparate us, okay?’
Harry feels himself flush, not wanting Draco to think him stupid. ‘Malfoy, I’m not—’ Harry pauses, choking on the would-be lie. No one has ever just
Malfoy had been an Auror for several years now, and was proving to be an excellent field agent, but it didn’t stop Harry’s hackles rising every time he caught sight of him. Luckily they’d never had to work together, and managed to keep their distance from each other on a day-to-day basis.
them, you’re always rota’d for days off over the full moon and I keep smelling Wolfsbane in your tea. Seriously, are you telling me no one else at the DMLE has ever worked this out?’
. He can barely think straight when Harry pulls away slightly, lifting Draco against the cabinets so their chests press together, nuzzling against Draco’s neck and licking a stripe along the skin covering his pulse. Potter’s magic crackles and his hold on Draco tightens, and for a moment Draco is afraid he is going to try and Apparate them away, and them both being Splinched - or even killed - by the Ministry Anti-Apparition wards.
Robards calm facade crumbles away completely, and he flashes Harry a look of terror, as if battling with himself whether to give up the information. ‘Potter, listen to me,’ he pleads. ‘Weasley has a team of Aurors ready to go and extract Malfoy. I need you to stay here with me, okay? I believe your…
, what he’s thinking of doing, but it’s certainly going to be challenging enough to keep him busy for a while.
But Malfoy only smelled as he always did, warm and spicy, like the finest vintage Firewhisky left to breathe by a roaring fire. The only hint of emotion Harry picked up from him was something tempting and distinct, and Harry found himself frowning, alone, watching the now-empty doorway of the Society, silently beckoning Harry inside.
‘Yes, sir,’ Draco murmurs, and Harry goes hot and looks away hastily. He marches off to the Ministry Apparition spot, holding out his arm to Draco when he gets there.
With a blaze of heat, he realised he could do exactly that. He climbed onto the bed between Draco’s legs, and went to grab hold of the red lace keeping him hidden.
Hermione gives him a small smile and closes her book. ‘It’s going to be okay, Harry,’ she said. ‘Your friends, your colleagues, you know we’re all by your side. And everyone else? Sure, it’s a surprise, but they’ll get over it, once the next new scandal hits the stands.’
‘You’re a proper Auror too, Malfoy,’ Harry manages eventually, even as Malfoy snorts in cold amusement. ‘Wait…are they still getting you to do entry-level jobs?’ Harry thinks over the last few weeks with Draco. The Diagon patrols, the paperwork, the menial cases they’d been assigned, and now this: permit-wrangling. These were all jobs Harry did in his first year, until he got partnered up and cleared for field duty.
? He braces one hand against the cool, wet tiles, and wraps the other around his aching, straining cock.
‘Look at you, Potter.’ Harry opens his eyes. Draco Malfoy looks down at him, hair dishevelled, his silver-scarred chest bare. ‘Begging me as if you don’t
Pettigrew’s eyes roll back in his skull and he collapses, unconscious, on the dirty ground. From behind Harry, outside the room, he hears scuffles and noise, and the smashed door flings open. Aurors spill through into the room, smudges of blue against the dull, dirty manor, wands raised.
‘I’ll be home in an hour,’ Draco said, straightening his cloak and flashing his silver eyes over them both. ‘Be good.’ And then he was gone, in a flash of green flames through the Floo.
‘Want to talk about it?’ his best friend finally ventures, and Harry shakes his head, warming his hands on his mug. What was there to say that hadn’t been covered last night, deep into his seventh glass of ale, at Peaseblossom Cottage? He’d stayed over in the end, sleeping in his comfortable little bed in the spare room, but Ron and Hermione’s presence hadn’t eased him the way it usually did. Instead of talking about his unwelcome work partner, Harry focuses on the other thing that’s been worrying him.
Draco spent a lot of time here, in the early days, and not just because more often than not he was on paperwork duty. He knew each of the filing cabinets like the back of his hand, which ones stuck as they opened, which one had a faulty Undetectable Extension Charm, which one just seemed to hate him and spat out hundreds of files every time he opened it.
Ron mouths, and Harry, jaw tight, nods. Ron nods in response, and gives a sharp jerk of his head. His meaning is clear:
Pansy’s heart fluttered at Percy’s commanding call of her name. She put the last book back in place, smoothed down her pencil skirt, and walked around the bookcases.
Only then would Blaise slide beneath the covers, running his hands down Draco’s flat, scarred stomach, his velvety soft skin. Blaise would hook his fingers into the waistband of Draco’s briefs, carefully pulling them down to expose Draco’s dick. Blaise would always pause here, listening for any change in Draco’s breathing, before gently reaching forward to nuzzle against his soft cock.
‘Yes, sir,’ she murmured, and Draco’s eyes darkened with delight. He leaned down to kiss her, gentle and reverent.
Instead, this is more gentle, teasing almost, comfortingly familiar in a way Harry hasn’t felt with anyone outside of the Weasley family since he was bitten.
‘It’s good to see you,’ she breathes happily, not releasing her hold on him, and Harry smiles against her curls.
Harry’s heart would beat fitfully, his cock twitching desperately, and he’d eagerly do what he knew Draco wanted from him.
‘Look at me,’ Harry growls, gently working Draco’s cock in his hand, thrusting shallowly into him at the same time. ‘I want to see you come.’
reporter was so excited his voice was practically quivering. Harry could scent danger on the air, the pack mentality of the media closing in for a kill. He instinctively bristled and curled his lip. The reporter pushed on, either unaware or uncaring of the danger he was currently in. ‘Are you really a werewolf?’
Draco has never seen Harry like this: there is only one night between his wolf and the full moon, and it shows. He’s wearing dark jeans and a tight red t-shirt stretched over his muscles, his hair tied messily back. His arms are tense all the way down to his fists, sinews standing taut on his brown forearms. His eyes are almost golden rather than green, and his sharp canines are long and white, clearly visible beneath his curled lip. His wand is nowhere to be seen - Draco suspects wherever he came from, he hadn’t even bothered to pick it up - but magic literally sparks off him, fiery and threatening.
‘And who the fuck are you?’ Harry spits. His gaze slides again to Draco, running up and down his lifeless body as if assuring himself he’s okay, before turning back to the wizard who captured him.
It’s been two years, and yet he still struggles with that unsavoury smell when he first walks in. The stale sweat, the cheap coffee, the still, heavy air. He can’t remember ever noticing it,
‘Come on,’ Harry says, and is pleased to see Draco battling a grin at Harry’s bossy tone. ‘We’re going to go and get this permit inspection done, show Robards we’re the best damn Auror team he’s ever had, and make sure we both get put onto cases that accurately reflect our skill levels and seniority.’
For a brief moment Harry’s wolf tries to surge to the surface, anger rushing through his veins, wanting to Apparate back to the DMLE and lay his hands back on the ones who did this, who made his mate suffer in this terrible way.
, what are you going to do with this information, Malfoy,’ Harry hisses, and something in Draco’s eyes darkens dangerously, making Harry’s wolf purr in approval.
Harry Potter’s not-so-dulcet tones danced merrily down the hallway, drifting into the bedroom, where Draco Malfoy sat at the dressing table, an indulgent smile on his face.
‘What — I — what are you on about, Malfoy?’ he manages to spit out, waving a hasty hand to banish the spilled beverage from his Auror uniform.
, Malfoy,’ Robards responds, his voice tight. He finally looks up, his quill poised over his parchment. ‘Look, you want to be promoted to full Auror sooner rather than later, right?’ Malfoy scowls but nods reluctantly, crossing his arms over his chest. Robards gave him a stern look. ‘You’ve done well as a junior, Malfoy, but you need a little more respect from the others before making full Auror. Working with Potter - effectively - will help you gain that.’ Robards turns his steely gaze onto Harry, and Harry pushes down the urge to curl his lip at him. It wasn’t that he disliked Robards, but ever since being bitten he found it hard to be dominated by anyone. ‘Potter, if you want to sit in this chair one day, you need to show you can work with any partner. Pairing up with Malfoy will put you on the fast track for next head Auror.’
Draco groans in delight, stretching his body out, catlike, in the cage of Harry’s embrace. ‘I can think of nothing better,’ Draco purrs, but he pushes his arse back against Harry’s groin as he speaks. Harry lets out a low growl, rolling his hips insistently into Draco, all thoughts of tea forgotten.
She only enjoyed a few moments of post-orgasmic bliss before she came to her senses and regret began to set in. She placed her palms against Draco’s shirt, pushing herself back so she could look at him. He was still fully dressed, minus his cloak, and raised an eyebrow at her.
Harry ignores Draco’s comment, crossing his arms and trying his best to look unbothered. ‘So, now what?’ he asks, and Draco looks up in confusion.
Harry shakes his head before Ron’s even finished speaking. ‘No special treatment, Ron. It’s not as if I need protecting,’ he adds darkly, and is relieved to see a glimmer of a smile ghost across Ron’s lips. Harry reaches out, his irritability from earlier almost faded, and lays his hand over Ron’s. ‘I promise to let you know if it happens again, though, okay?’
And none of it had actually been as bad as Harry had expected. Sure, Malfoy still wound him up something rotten, and they often ended up bickering at their desks, but it was… different. Wildly different from when they’d been at Hogwarts, and the antagonism was cruel, bitter, poisonous.
Harry is the saviour, the golden boy, an Auror: a protector of the innocent. For a man like him - a man like no other - to be afflicted with a disease that makes even Muggles uneasy around him is an absolute tragedy.
‘Better?’ he asked, his voice dangerously quiet. ‘Now, want to tell me why you disobeyed me?’ His eyes flickered back over to Harry, still restrained on the sofa. ‘Was it Potter’s fault?’
Draco lets out a low, affectionate laugh. ‘I have to say, you’re giving me pretty mixed signals, Harry.’ Harry just huffs and breathes in the scent at Draco’s neck, feeling the pulse of his artery against his lips.
With a huff and a scowl, Draco thumped back into the sofa, but Harry could tell from the set of his eyes that he was thinking hard.
"Face it, Malfoy, you like vulgar, lower-class boys." Harry smirked. "You're probably longing for me to push you into a threesome with Ron."
"I'll pull it out, if you'd like," Draco said, stepping up and reaching into the bag. He drew out a square of parchment and unfolded it. "Start Charms essay-- Sorry, wrong one. Ah, here! 'Mr. Potter, I wish to talk to you in private. You may choose the place, and have Draco and two other friends present, if I may bring Cassandra Vere and Daphne Greengrass. Only Draco may be within the privacy charm whilst we speak. Please reply with discretion. Sincerely, Miss Pansy Parkinson.'"
"It didn't fail," she said defensively. "I just wanted to see who I was now." She bit her lip. "And I needed to see if I could do it from nothing."
His voice was low, but not so low that the others couldn't hear. Pansy tittered, and Harry felt his face heat.
There was a moment in which everyone sat frozen by his words. "Parvati should, I think," Padma said finally. Harry wasn't sure if it was sisterly loyalty, or that Parvati was sitting to her left. No one objected though, and Harry raised his glass in an approving salute, and Parvati started.
Narcissa gestured to the sideboard, where a bottle of wine was waiting in an ice bucket. "Draco, would you pour, please, darling?"
"I might be able to rent a place in Muggle London, if you'd do the Confundus charms and such for me."
"On second thought, not quite yet. I have something I want to try. Will you take it a little bit later?"
The cupboard turned out to be along a perpendicular corridor, but still backed up against the left wall.
So he scouted out the far door of the Leaky Cauldron, questioned the twins (who had not, to his surprise, dealt with Muggle alarm systems, but were impressed that he had), and made a quick trip to the book shop to look for information. It occurred to him, as he settled down with a copy of
They followed his former self through closing ranks of Slytherins -- sometimes literally through -- until they reached Draco, Millicent, and Blaise. Blaise gave Harry a quick nod that he hadn't appreciated at the time. Blaise had bet Draco that Harry would make up with Mill quickly. He had been showing confidence, and Harry had missed that in his dismay over Draco's lack of it. Millicent looked as hurt as he remembered. Her arms were locked tight across her substantial chest.
He led Draco to the bed as if they were walking on eggshells. Draco sat down and tugged his hand, so Harry sat, half-facing him.  For a long moment, they just stared at each other, and then both of them laughed tensely.
"Dare?" Harry repeated incredulously, but Draco, Millicent, and Blaise were sniggering, as were several people he didn't know.
Neither of them had sat. Now Snape leaned back against the narrow table by the door, his hands resting at edge beside his hips. "What do
"And it does serve as a way to learn more about each other," Blaise observed. "Conversational familiarity compressed, in a way."
"Quite. Recall that he intervened as soon as he returned." Harry placed the deep voice as well. It was Shacklebolt. He decided to try opening his eyes.
?" Harry said scornfully, finally managing to put the implication he could bugger Dennis into context. "Honestly, you never noticed me staring at Cedric because I didn't want some
"And not really what he said," Draco contributed. "I didn't get a chance to break all the protections on Father's Pensieve when I was home, but I'm quite sure the end was 'change allows death.'" That doesn't necessarily mean the death of the changer.  Prophesy is notoriously misleading, which was why we were
"Yeah, but only certain people are influenced." At this, Harry's full attention went to Dean, wanting-- no, needing-- to know what he meant.
"Harry, the only people who are pulled towards Draco are the ones who aren't, I mean... We're all, uh... into guys..."
"Some of us have noticed... urges, as well. Things we wouldn't normally do, but we want to when Draco's around." Dean looked nervous at admitting it.
As he stood much too close, Draco's sneer turned into a smirk, as though he could tell what Harry was thinking. He probably caught the quick glance Harry cast towards his lips. He was able to push away the thought, not knowing if it was his own conscious thought or Draco's will. He had maybe considered what it would be like kissing the blond before, but never while under his charm, though he would deny any allegations. He couldn't tell if the look on Draco's face was shock from him being able to resist or just his normal irritating look of pride, like he was too good for Harry to even be in his presence. Hermione grabbed his sleeve and dragged him away. "What was that about?" She asked. Of course, she wouldn't know about Draco, she couldn't feel his powers radiate through her when they were close. She probably didn't even notice the dreamy gazes others gave him.
The next Potions class proved it difficult to keep away from Malfoy. Professor Snape assigned them to work on their anti-poison potion together. Hermione gave him a sympathetic look as she moved tables to work with Dante, a less out-spoken Slytherin. Draco took her place after getting their supplies for them. Not out of kindness, but because he was certain Harry wouldn't get the best pick of the ingredients. It was a lot harder than Dean made it out to be to focus on other things, not when he could feel Malfoy so close to him. Snapping fingers in front of his face made him return to reality. "Are you going to cut them, or do I need to do everything?" Draco asked, looking both annoyed and pleased. His partner watched him until he was satisfied with his cutting. While Draco cleaned up the scraps of their ingredients, Harry was put to stir the potion counterclockwise, the last step. His heart nearly leaped out of his chest when Draco grabbed his wrist.
“I’m sorry that Draco said no,” she said sadly, like she knew the feeling of rejection all too well.
“Flawless as usual, Mr. Malfoy,” Snape complimented as he peered into their cauldron. His smile turned to a grimace as he faced Harry. “Good job, Mr. Potter.”
It occurred again, after the first of the Triwizard Tournament task. Draco baited Harry once more after he passed the first task, pushing him hard as he tried to leave the forest. They were in each other's faces, throwing insults as usual, when Harry got that urge to kiss his opponent. For a second, Draco thought it was going to happen. Harry pushed him back against a tree, something between hatred and lust seemed to hang between them. Harry's face was inches from the Slytherin's, but instead of kissing him, he just rolled his eyes and turned away from the blond. Harry swore he heard a whisper saying, "What a tease."
“No, I’d like that… I just can’t believe you’d be willing to. Especially after you got quoted turning me down.”
"You all right, mate?" Ron asked as he scribbled down some more nonsense for Divination. Hermione flashed him a quick look of pity, thinking that he was still stuck on the Veela thing. Harry nodded, but then decided to tell them the truth. He leaned forward to avoid any curious ears.
Harry remember Hedwig’s note, after the chaos had died down. Ron and Hermione were too focused on each other to notice Harry rip open the envelope. Scrawled on it in neat handwriting are the words, “Sixth floor disused boy’s lavatory, after dinner?” Harry tucked the note in his robe pocket, looking forward to their next meeting.
As Snape went to the next table, Harry laughed. “Thanks,” he said, using his foot to nudge Draco’s foot.
“Resist him, Harry,” Dean encouraged, giving him an easy smile before turning his full attention back to his boyfriend. It wasn’t that easy, though. Feeling what Draco felt made it impossible to resist him. Harry couldn’t stop how completely in tune he seemed to be with the Slytherin.
“That’s great, Hermione! You said ‘yes,’ right?” He teased, nudging her knee back. She nodded enthusiastically and leaned closer to Ron. Harry was glad for his friends, but the thought of Ron and Hermione both having dates for the Yule Ball, while he didn’t, made him panic a bit. The obvious choice was Draco, but he knew that was unimaginable. He wouldn’t even let himself think about dancing with Draco, swaying to the music as they hold each other closer than they’ve ever been.  No one would be accepting of that plan. He was sure Draco would ask Pansy, which meant that Harry absolutely had to find a date. There were girls constantly asking him, only because he was “famous.” Perhaps he’d take one of them, both of them using each other in their own ways.
"Ten rotations, Potter. Trying to ruin our potion or are you just daft?" Malfoy sneered, taking the spoon from Harry. Where the thin fingers had been seemed to burn. He rubbed at the spot, a frown on his face.
"Wonder what Malfoy was up to," Neville whispered, nodding towards the blond who was only now sitting down. "Nothing good, I bet." Harry kept his mouth shut, for the time being, not wanting anyone other than his closest friends to know what Malfoy was really doing. He was glad he got out of that room before anything really happened. He didn't know Malfoy's true intentions, but he didn't figure he wanted to find out.
In an attempt at humor, Harry offered another question, “If you hate Pansy so much, why do you keep her around? Every time you’re with her, all I can feel is your irritation.”
“I heard about what Pansy did. She told me her father taught her an unforgivable curse… and she planned on testing it on you. I’ve tried talking to her, telling her that out friendship has nothing to do with yours and my,” Draco hesitated, trying to find an appropriate word that wouldn’t imply anything Harry might not be ready for, “situation.”
When Harry laid down that night, nothing seemed to be fixed. In fact, his head felt like an unsolvable puzzle. The more he thought, the more scrambled things became. The only thing he was sure of was that completely straight people didn't have to reassure themselves that they were straight. He wished this was like another class, with information he could get from a book. There were no books to tell him how to feel or what to do. He'd experiment, but he just wasn't that type of person. He didn't want to risk more rumors or the possibility of hurting someone who actually liked him.
“Why are you making me feel your emotions?” Harry asked, getting straight to the point. When he didn’t get a response, his gaze moved from the floor to Draco’s face, which was etched with confusion.
The Gryffindor common room exploded in cheers when Harry walked through the portrait hole, and the party didn't die down until nearly one in the morning. A few remained spread out on the couches and chairs, not ready to sleep yet. Harry and Dean Thomas were among the who had yet to retire.
"What are you talking about, Gin? What's wrong?" She got up from the table, tearing up at the questions.
“Are you listening to yourself? Why don’t we see what Hermione thinks?” Ron was under the impression that Hermione would fully agree with him. Harry hesitated before setting him straight.
Harry stood up quickly, clenching the paper in his fists. Hermione grabbed his arm in an attempt to stop him from whatever he was planning, but he pulled away and made his way to the Slytherin table. This time, the entire Great Hall was silent as Harry approached Draco's usual group. Pansy stood up, hands on her hips. "You can't have him!" The table erupted with laughter and jeers towards Harry.
Harry went to bed first, telling them that he needed to spend some time thinking about the next task. It was true, he did need to; the only thing he thought about, though, was Draco. He still had on a dorky smile when Dean entered the room, holding hand with Seamus, who dropped his hand as soon as he saw that they weren’t alone. Harry pretended he hadn’t noticed, but felt bad for Dean, having to hide his love. Seamus sat on his own bed, and Harry made a mental note to himself to distract Ron and Neville so that the two could have some privacy for a while. Dean, however, came to Harry’s bed, sitting on the edge. “I left right after you, Harry. You gave in, didn’t you?” He asked, nervous for his friend, not wanting him to get hurt by Slytherin with the worst reputation of anyone currently at Hogwarts. When Harry didn’t respond, Dean just nodded. “I’m not going to say anything, because you look happy, happier than I’ve seen you lately, but be careful. “
“Go to the Yule Ball with me,” Draco said suddenly, looking at Harry’s face for some indication of how the comment made him feel. Harry was completely taken aback.
Once the library’s lights started to bother his eyes, Harry finished his studying outside of the doors to the Great Hall as he waited for his friends to go inside to eat. He tried to be in a good mood, but even from across the Hall, tables away, Harry could feel Draco’s every emotion; happiness was never one of them.
"Whatever it is he does. When Fleur gets close, you get this feeling, right? She makes you want her. Malfoy does the same thing, guys." How much was Harry going to explain?
"Draco Malfoy is a Veela. I know it doesn't make sense to you, Hermione, but he is. He even hints at it. I think I screwed up, though. He cornered me earlier, after Potions, tried to get me to make a move. The thing Dean gave me was a note from Malfoy. He said he's going to make it harder for me to ignore."
Harry had a lot to think about while lying in his bed. He tried to think about every person he'd ever had a crush on. He really liked Cho, but why? She made him feel good about himself, sure. So, were the feelings actually romantic or just because of her kindness? It was the same with Ginny, too. Was he only into girls who fueled his ego?
"Hermione's probably waiting to walk with us," he said as Harry worked on getting dressed. He didn't reply as he buttoned his shirt, pushing his shoes on at the same time. Ron looked uncomfortable, to say the least. Once Harry was ready, the two of them walked down the staircase. Hermione jumped from where she'd been sitting, smiling wider than necessary. "Morning, boys!"
“So, what you said in the Great Hall, when the Prophet came out…” Draco started, not sure how he wanted to end the sentence.
"Mr. Malfoy! Perfect job," Snape praised, before looking at Harry. "Can't say the same for you, though, Mr. Potter. Work more diligently next time."
Hermione wasn't the only one who couldn't forget about their face-to-face. Whispers went through the hall about the way Harry Potter was looking at Draco Malfoy, not with contempt but something that could be seen as positive-- admiration, maybe. Draco enjoyed the teasing Harry got, feeling better about the rejection.
Classes were very difficult to pay attention to. People were not-so-secretly laughing at him and his failed attempt to get Draco to go to the Ball with him. They’d believe anything in the Prophet, sadly. The laughter sucked, but nothing bothered him as much as it would’ve if it hadn’t been Pansy making up stories. Ron was still on edge but was no longer ready to throw curses at the next person to piss him off, so that was an improvement. It seemed to take forever, and he noticed more ‘Potter Stinks’ pins than ever, but dinner finally came. For the first time since she had blown up on him, Ginny sat down across from Harry. He said a soft greeting, not wanting to say too much in case she wasn’t over Rita’s article yet.
Harry took the time to eat another dinner roll, slowly, pulling it apart with his thin fingers before popping the pieces into his mouth. He could feel a new emotion—awe. Harry’s head turned from listening to Seamus talk about the broom he grew up with to look at Draco, their eyes meeting. The Slytherin didn’t even look away to pretend he wasn’t staring, but he did look surprised that Harry seemed to sense that he had been staring. To Draco’s right, Pansy was fuming over the fact that her “boyfriend” wasn’t paying any attention to her. Her head turned to Harry, too, but she simply stuck up her middle finger before pulling on Draco’s robe sleeve, whispering something in his ear. Once again, the feeling of aggravation was strong, so strong that Harry had to look away. Once the feeling was gone and his gaze returned to Draco, Pansy was storming out the doors. He jumped at the feeling of a hand on his bicep, turning quickly to see who had touched him.
“Wait,” he said, pulling Harry in for another quick kiss, hardly anything more than their lips lightly brushing together, but as Harry walked back towards the common room, he couldn’t shake off that warm feeling (not that he wanted to).
His eyes adjusted to the dark quickly and he wasn't sure whether to calm down or panic more when he recognized the dark face in front of him. Draco radiated calmness, though, allowing Harry to relax. When the Slytherin was certain Harry wouldn't yell out, he removed his hand. "What the hell?" Harry hissed, keeping quiet in case Snape were to walk by and hear him. He'd be the one to get in trouble.
“Don’t go out alone. If she gets the chance again, you know she’ll take it,” Draco finished as he added their final ingredients. As he stirred, Harry looked behind him to look at Pansy, who was giving him the most disturbing smirk, as though she was imagining killing him. The programs Dudley watched on the television taught him that girls were uncontrollable when they were upset, but he thought that was an exaggeration because he’d never experienced that fear until his eyes met Pansy’s.
“Obviously. It’s not because I’d like to dance with you or be close to you, and it’s definitely not because the idea of you being with some girl bothers me, especially because you have every right to go with some girl because you don’t owe me anything.” The sarcastic snark made Harry laugh, shifting just enough so that their arms were pressed together.
Since the first time Harry laid eyes on Draco in the robe shop, he hadn’t been able to shake the feeling of immediate affection. Even when they’d actually been introduced and their attitudes towards each other became unpleasant, to say the least, Harry still felt enchanted. It wasn’t until his fourth year, at the Quidditch World Cup, that he understood. The pale hair, the sharp but elegant facial features, and the look some of the boys got when he passed led Harry to believe that Draco was part Veela. As with Fleur, boys and girls stared and wanted to do Draco’s bidding. Only certain boys were attracted, Harry noticed. Some, like Ron, were utterly disgusted when in the presence of the Malfoy boy. It was no wonder the hall was filled with the glowing ‘Potter Stinks’ badges, as Draco had convinced those under his will to wear them. Every time Harry got near the part-Veela, he had to fight the urge to become submissive to Draco. It was like the unforgivable curse that forced the person to do as their controller wished. He was washed with warmth, as though he was bathing in the sun, whenever Draco got too near. In the warm haze, he felt compelled to kiss Draco as he stood too near.
“It’s fine. I mean, I hate the jeers and laughter, but I grew up with that, so it doesn’t bother me as much as it should,” he said, in reference to the way that Dudley treated him.
"That doesn't mean he's a Veela! I mean, you must admit, he isn't unattractive, Harry. It's natural for girls, and some guys, to be interested in him. "
"Harry, Hedwig was looking for you. I promised her I'd give it to you. I didn't want it to fall into the wrong hands," Dean slipped a folded piece of parchment into Harry's hand as he passed by. Harry nodded in thanks, tucking it into his trouser pocket. Dean was a good friend, there was no denying that. The two had gotten closer since they became aware of the whole Malfoy ordeal. Dean was the only one who believed him and felt the same way.
“I don’t hate you. I had a lot of feelings towards you, but hate wasn’t one of them. I do hate your stupid Veela magic, though,” Harry said, after realizing what moment Draco had been referring to. He didn’t realize that he’d come to love that stupid Veela magic, feeling Draco’s emotions course through him and intensifying every interaction between them. The blond just laughed and shrugged, nudging Harry’s shoulder with his own. Harry panicked when he realized that he was supposed to rejoin Ron and Hermione. What if something happened that left them upset, and Harry was here kissing the guy he assumed was his enemy (until now)? Harry touched Draco’s knee, smiling apologetically. “I have to make sure Ron isn’t heartbroken.” Unlike Ron, Hermione was difficult to read. He could never really tell if she held romantic feelings for the ginger. He stood, offering a hand to help Draco up. Once they were both standing, Harry turned to leave, but Draco didn’t let go of his hand.
“I have a date to the Yule Ball, but I don’t know how to tell Ron… I’m kind of nervous how everyone is going to react, honestly,” Harry confided, sitting down next to her as focus left her assignment.
They walked into the Great Hall, hand in hand. For the first time in his life, Harry didn’t care about the staring. He squeezed Draco’s hand, appreciating the warm wave of affection he felt come off of his date.
Normally, the Golden Trio would’ve left the Hall together and walk back to the Gryffindor common room together, but Ron leaned over to Harry to whisper to him, “I need to talk to Hermione. Alone. Mind hanging back for a bit before coming to the common room?” Harry was offended at the idea of Ron and Hermione sharing secrets, potentially about him, until Ron broke out in a smile. “I’m going to ask her to go to the Yule Ball with me.” He didn’t say it, but Harry could feel that there was more to that sentence; as Ron tensed up after the confession, he could almost hear the implied, “If that’s all right with you.” Harry returned the smile and nodded, giving him an encouragement of, “Good luck!”
“You’ll tell me I’m insane just like he did.” Harry knew Dean wouldn’t understand either. He was fully aware that Draco was part Veela.
“No,” Harry replied in honesty. He was much too excited to dance with his date to care about what anyone thought. Draco let Harry go, taking his hand instead.
Harry could feel pain in his chest, but it wasn’t his own pain. His eyes met Draco’s as he looked up, the blond shaking his head quickly, trying to tell Harry that Draco did not say any of that. But Harry already knew, and he weakly smiled at the worried boy. Ron was seething, pissed off that Malfoy was calling his girlfriend (though it wasn’t official, Ron was waiting until he was allowed to call her that) a mudblood, pissed that that bitch Rita would publish that, even with the poor excuse of censoring. He nearly leapt out of his chair to fight Malfoy when Harry grabbed his arm.
Harry pulled his coat tighter against him as he walked against the wind. It was early December, there were only a few weeks until the Yule Ball. He hadn’t even gotten to the lake when he was hit with a jinx, falling back on his ass as he wildly looked for the source, and who should he see but Pansy Parkinson. As he tried to stand, he heard another bang and was pushed back into the snow. She made her way in front of him, hands on her hips, her wand still in her right fist. “I am getting so fucking tired of you, Potter,” She yelled, her voice not nearly as loud in the wind as it was coming out. He went to reach for his own wand, but her foot stomped on it as he went for his pocket. He could kick her, easily, but then he could see the tears leaving streaks along her frozen cheeks. “Why couldn’t you just leave him alone?”
"I had to get you alone without your faithful companions ruining everything." Draco wiped his hand on his robe, keeping up the appearance of being disgusted by Harry. He used, what Harry called, his charm on the angry Gryffindor. He glared at Draco, shaking his head as though to clear the thoughts.
“I don’t hate her. She’s my best friend, even if it doesn’t seem like it. Whenever you’re around, she paws at me like I’m a toy she refuses to share. I hate that, not her,” he answered, and they sink into silence. It would probably feel uncomfortable to Harry, if not for Draco’s relaxation. If someone had told him a month ago that he would be sitting in an abandoned corridor with Draco Malfoy for any reason other than to hex him, he’d laugh and tell them that’s impossible. Then, suddenly, Harry could feel the thought of kissing Malfoy crawl into his mind. When he turned to look at the Slytherin, who was already looking at him, Harry rolled his eyes and couldn’t help but laugh at the hopeful look Draco wears. “You know… Instead of making me want to kiss you, you could just kiss me.” And that’s all it took for Draco to eliminate the space between them, the pale fingers an extreme contrast to the dark jaw that they skimmed as their lips tentatively met. Even as it was Harry’s first kiss, he knew that the way it felt wasn’t normal; that feeling of being washed in warmth had returned, more intense than ever. It took them quite a bit of spending time together before Harry would realize that the warm feeling was Draco’s own happiness. Draco wouldn’t admit it for a long time, but that feeling Harry had, of wanting to kiss him, had nothing to do with his magic.
Draco wasn't sure what about the question bothered him, but something did. He frowned. "You doubt my reasoning now?" he challenged.
"It's not--" Harry began, but fell silent at the look Draco shared with the nearer twin. "Fine!" he snarled, and marched back to the table.
Dean twitched away, but walked away beside him. Harry caught Hermione's arm and headed in the other direction. Ernie was gone by now.  "Let's go," he said.
"I believe," said Draco's voice from the door to the right of the fireplace, "that he expected you to be
The liquid was cold, but the easy slide afterwards wonderful. Even better, Draco brought his hand around to spread the excess onto Harry's cock.
Draco rolled his eyes. "You were planning to do this on verbal agreement and a handshake?" He sighed. "Oh dear. You were."
Everyone considered that. For the first time, it occurred to Harry that Ginny and Cornelia probably knew Linnet and Gilbert better than he did. They had no doubt been in lessons together, along with the Ravenclaw they were talking about. He wondered if that made it worth adding a fifth-year or two.
Harry grinned at the cold humor. "I don't much care if it's bad for his heart, Professor. I'd just rather he didn't take it out on me when you leave. And you
"Oh, don't worry about that! They need to be invited again, that's all. But the group was too small, so the awkwardness was too visible. We need more areas of interaction. I'd like to add Linnet and Gilbert, if you have no objections."
Uncle Vernon's bellow brought Harry out of his reverie, and he darted to the top of the stairs to look though the railing supports to the front door. Professor Lupin was standing there, dressed quite competently as a Muggle, with Snuffles on a lead. The dog surged forward as he spotted Harry.
Harry tried to finish his Charms essay. He really needed to. But having made Hermione believe that he was writing to Remus and Sirius, he felt a strange obligation to make it true. After several non-productive minutes of staring at the same page, he pushed away his schoolbooks and got out a fresh piece of parchment.
Harry looked around the room. It wasn't as gloomy as he had thought it as a second year, but it didn't seem right for Christmas morning. "Gryffindor is more festive," he admitted. "And if I come down here, that leaves just Sajid and Helen."
"We hadn't asked for that," Harry said honestly. "The first time, all we were asking was if he could tell me from Voldemort in a blood divination."
"I think they have medical texts. And if people can get injured internally there, then there must be Healers' spells to clean it."
“You’re one of us, you idiot!” Caradog exclaimed. “I mean, not that this is some Quidditch thing, but we vouched for you, you know.”
Draco smiled at him uncertainly, and then, to Harry's surprise, settled an arm around Harry's shoulders and tugged him close. "Cuddle," he said, in quiet command.
Draco caught his breath. "Oh," he said weakly. "It sounded like -- like you were saying you'd had sex with me then -- and I'm sure I'd remember that."
"God, no." Harry relaxed back into his seat. If that was what Dumbledore was worried about, he would be fine. "Waiting through last term was enough."
Now that he had got out of thinking of Potions classes the answers weren't so hard. He needed Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures.
"Of course, dear." Narcissa nodded regally.  Harry felt a flash of indignation at the way she acted as if the Auror's name meant nothing to her.
"Right. He's as stubborn as I am. No, I'll let him know it would make me happy. He'd like a way to do that, I think."
Despite all that was going on, school days felt normal -- lessons were easy, or difficult, or boring, and assignments took a lot of time.  Except for Cursebreaking and Symbology, each class now had at least one lesson a week focused on a checklist of past points that might be on the N.E.W.T.s. On Tuesday, when Snape approached their table at the end of Potions, Harry was hoping it might be about his aunt, but it was Draco that Snape wanted to speak to. ("Come by my rooms after dinner to retrieve your Pensieve. Despite what your mother apparently believes, I am
"No problem," Harry laughed, and returned to the bed, lying down a bit clumsily. "I don't know how you handle the size change so gracefully."
Millicent practically glowed with pride. "There are two ways," she said. "The easiest is a Withering hex, but you can also use an enchanted ax or machete. In the past, witches and wizards have sometimes given those to Muggles when they couldn't attack the Thorny Hedge themselves."
When the last shudders cleared, he looked groggily forward to see Draco lifting his head with a smirk.  Grinning, Harry rolled him over to return the pleasure, drinking in his scent and the softness of his skin, and the silky liquid at his tip under Harry's touch.
Harry ended up running up to Gryffindor for the Moonherd set, and Draco went off to get Gilbert's, and his own lightning cloud, which he declared would make a fine obstacle. By the time he got back, other people had come and left again to fetch other things. They ended up with three sets of the balls, which meant six people could control a horse, and in the resulting chaos, Harry was never quite certain what the rules were, but he had accumulated a decent clutch of the balls before Linnet figured out how to lure the lightning cloud toward specific opponents and swept the field.
The room was now just short of crowded, with the festively attired guests adding to the beauty of the already stunning ballroom.  The wizards -- or most of them -- wore as much color as the witches, and in addition to robes, came garbed in styles that suggested elements of the last several centuries of Muggle attire, weighting older. The women, with a very few exceptions, wore gowns, which Harry suspected were better for dancing than robes.  Indeed, the exceptions were mostly elderly women who looked unlikely to dance.  One was even in a floating chair.
Draco did not look in his basket. Glumbumble treacle was a perfectly legitimate purchase. "Auror Potter."
Harry shrugged. He couldn't blame Draco for not trusting Dumbledore. The Leaving Feast of his first year, such a wonderful surprise when he was eleven, now disturbed him when he remembered it. "At least it was a Gryffindor," he said. "That means something, I think."
"Oh, I'm more worried about avoiding blows in defense class, to be honest." The group of them, and Blaise, were the only people still by the sideboard now. Harry swept his arm towards the empty white sofa and matching chair beside it. "Pick a spot."
Harry hadn't realized Blaise knew so much about Potions. He sounded almost as knowledgeable as Draco.
Back in the corridor, he found himself in no mood to return to the Quiris. He went up to the Owlery instead, stopping at a window seat to dash off a quick note to Draco, saying only that there was too much to talk about in a letter.
He met her eyes steadily, following Draco's advice on not looking guilty. She knew he had secrets about Sirius, he was sure, and she'd been sympathetic at the trial. It would probably make sense to her that he wasn't thrilled with the idea. "Depends on what people ask, doesn't it?"  he returned. "And I can think lots of things I wouldn't want to tell a stranger, even though they're not...." He shrugged, and to his relief, she grinned at him.
Harry and Draco looked at each other. "That sounds brilliant, actually," Harry said, even though he knew they could not include Hermione.
An unfamiliar man in Auror's robes stepped forward, raising his hand in a demand for silence. "If you don't mind, sir,
"People can come here at any time. We have one group meeting a week, though, and nearly everyone shows up for that."
"It was clever," his memory self said boldly.  "I'm sorry I lost my temper." Around him, eyes widened further, and jaws went slack. Dumbledore said "Ah," with an air of satisfaction, and past-Harry moved forward, his pace steady as he passed through the enemy throng.
"It can." Harry considered positions that Draco One had introduced him to. On their sides might be even easier than having Draco up on his knees, but.... "Do you want to be facing me?" he asked, "or just to not be face down?"
With a little sniff, Gilbert stood. "And with that," he said, "I find it time to take my leave. I told Gloria that I'd help her with Transfiguration." He looked down at Draco, and then at Harry. "Have the two of you rested for long enough to tackle the stairs?"
Draco raised his eyebrows in a scornful look that Harry thought came more from his spellfather than his father. "What was your end of the deal, Potter?"
With an annoyed huff, Harry turned away. There was obviously something he was supposed to come up with here. So far, they had agreed that she shouldn't tell, which was a relief, and that punishment had no effect on him, which he supposed meant she wouldn't drag him in here to write lines.  What was she actually trying to accomplish, then? It sounded like she had given up on retribution. He glanced back over his shoulder.
"In any case...." Draco said loudly, apparently wanting the attention of the others before making the beads. Sophia had already passed over a knitting needle, and Harry lengthened it with slow strokes as Draco spun a cluster of glass shards into a long cylinder. Their audience faded from his awareness as Draco took the lengthened knitting needle. While he pushed it into the glass, Harry passed his wand and a hand down the length of it, an inch or two above the molten substance, draining the color from it.
He looked up at the staff table, and found Snape watching him. Eyes narrowing, the man gave him a curt nod before turning his attention to his eggs. Harry thought back frantically to the last time he had heard the clock strike. He thought it had been the half-hour, which would give him time to run upstairs and check the
It didn't take long, at least. It couldn't have been more than a minute before Malfoy started to hammer into him, fast and hard, and then it was seconds until he cried out and shook his hair back. Harry watched his eyes close and his mouth open, neck stretched out, as he came. As soon as he collapsed down, Harry edged up off of his prick.
react if you said you were helping Susan Bones with Charms, and I said, 'Oh, does she want to do something about that hair?'"
The meeting was less than comfortable, but at least it was short. Harry suspected that most of Draco's business had been concluded before he arrived, and he had been invited in only for display. Afterwards, he and Draco were summoned down to the parlor where he and Dumbledore had eaten breakfast. This meeting was not just with the headmaster, but included Severus Snape; a black Auror whom Harry vaguely remembered from the investigation after Mr. Weasley's death; a Wizengamot member named Amelia Bones; a pleasant Indian gentleman named Ravi Yallapragada; and other, quieter people. They used the full table, spreading out papers between empty plates, and most of the discussion went over Harry's head. He wasn't entirely sure whether Yallapragada was a barrister or another Wizengamot member, but he got the impression that Bones was the leader of a faction of the Wizengamot and keenly wanted to cement an alliance with Dumbledore. They all seemed to know the minutiae of applicable laws, though Harry couldn't imagine why they were bothering with trespassing and coercion when they had treason and attempted murder to work with.
Draco snorted. "Oh, that! No, a Slytherin wouldn't get into that situation." Draco smirked. "But if we were really lovers, I think I would notice more subtle differences." He straightened from where he had leaned back against the sofa cushions. "That is, I expect my counterpart -- Draco One? -- would."
"Ah." She steepled her hands for a moment. "Well," she said, inclining her head.  "If what you want is to do something together, I have a suggestion that should suit nicely, but stretch you both a bit more." Afraid she was going to tell them to go do their homework, Harry managed only a slight nod, but she smiled thinly and continued.
Harry was in the middle of banging out an explanation of why using transfigured materials in constructs was risky -- while privately thinking how often the risk was worth it, at least in his life, though he supposed that wasn't typical -- when the typograph stopped short. The E key creaked slowly back into place.
"See that you do," Snape returned, not looking up. "And I expect you on time and prepared, this afternoon."
Looking down, Harry thought he might see the appeal of doing oral sex. He at least wanted to trace the lines with his tongue, just as he had with Draco's throat. Instead, he brushed his fingers over a wide collar of foreskin to touch the pink head that pushed through them.
Draco was next. He took a swallow of wine and leaned back against the sofa cushions. "I," he said, with his eyes dancing over Harry, "have never stolen from a Muggle girl."
Harry shook his head. "I can resist that." His mouth twisted as he thought. "On the other hand, my scar gives Voldemort a certain amount of access to me. We could exaggerate that and say he took over my mind for several days."
Draco laughed. "Millicent hardly counts," he said, and Harry wondered what he would say if he knew how true that was.
"I thought you were quite graceful," she said politely. "Not an extensive repertoire, but showing definite potential."
"Well, yes," Luna said, looking dreamily off at the ivy. "I really can't devise any way that porridge would help with cross-transfiguration, so I suppose I was just hungry, this morning." She smiled brightly at Sophia. "But I was right about color-tracing superposition in runic overlays."
The contract as Draco had drawn it up wasn't too bad, until he got to the item that gave him sole ownership of the property, and laid out a high rent -- optionally payable in increased shares -- for any month that shop profits dropped below 15%. While his finger rested under that item, Draco's nails pressed significantly into his back.
Ruefully, Draco nodded. "For now, yes." His face twisted as if he had bitten into a lime. "But as Hermione for Harry, she holds a long-standing place in my affections."
With a snarl, Snape pulled off his robes and rolled up his left sleeve, and cast something that made the air crackle. Harry grabbed it and shoved it into his Lumos, flaring the light before realizing what Snape had done; covering the low ceiling was a distorted Dark Mark.
He ate ravenously, but briefly, and ended up leaving the Great Hall after only two bites of an éclair. Arriving to the empty Uncommon Room without Draco felt odd. He caught himself hoping that Mill would show up first, before remembering that she -- a Slytherin -- hadn't been invited.
"Exactly. You have only one term left here, Harry, and your short excursion showed the dangers of departure. However, you are not yet mature enough for the role of professor, and I will not offer you even the Defense Against the Dark Arts post."
"Hey, love," he said brightly, dropping the fine fabric in a silvery heap on the snow and pulling out an already open pack of cigarettes. "Sorry I took so long. We weren't quite where I expected."
Harry stopped around the corner from Snape's office to write in the Liber Geminus that he was available after all. He thought he might be better off stopping by Slytherin, but he knew he was in too much of a temper to deal with the house at large. Instead, he went up to the Uncommon Room, intending to check for a reply when he got there. Instead, he found Draco levitating a midnight blue velveteen sofa to one side of the room. Draco turned to him in surprise.
Harry laughed. "This is why Draco usually schedules Sunday away from me. He puts the finishing touches on things, and I get my work done."
"Try not to look," Madam Langston said soothingly. "It will not spoil the divination, but you will find it unpleasant." She cleared her throat. "Now I must anoint myself. Once I have done that, you may ask me one question, and one question only. Do you understand?"
Suddenly dry-mouthed, Harry nodded. Draco moved into his arms like a girl. "You need to lead," he whispered. "I don't want to confuse an inexperienced pupil before the ball."
He rolled his eyes. "I needed to get Ron and Draco together for a talk on short notice. Draco insisted on the cushions when I told him what state the place was in. It wasn't opening night for the Uncommon Room."
Sirius laughed, but Remus did not look amused. "I do not consider Dumbledore your enemy, Harry. Do you?"
"No!" he said, and she looked up, surprised. "No restraint," he explained. "You can steady my arm, but don't hold it."
"Just this balky machine," Harry fumed, rummaging through his school bag in search of erumpet powder. "There's got to be some way to run it off of dragon's blood."
Which was true for one occasion, Harry thought, but implied that he, not Draco, had led. He shivered, remembering the ghost, and the strange elation that had followed commanding it.
"I know." Harry kissed him again. Gently, he tugged at the ring they had attached to the end of the plug, making it shift inside Severus, who gasped. "But you're afraid. And if you panicked and ran, you'd be too proud to come back, and you
Malfoy let out his breath with a hiss.  "Circe, Gene! You have no idea how sensitive my nipples are anyway."
"Oh, no," Harry replied blithely. His stories might as well match. "I got up very early, and decided to invite Draco for a sunrise walk around the lake."
"He didn't know then," Draco said at a soothing near-whisper. Harry summoned Dobby, and released the restored mouse. After a few seconds of panicked immobility, it shot away into the ivy-covered pile of rubble, vanishing just as Dobby returned with a bowl full of sunflower seeds.  "Thanks," Harry said cheerily, pretending not to notice Hermione's glare, and after taking a handful of the seeds, put the bowl on the couch behind him, next to Ginny. Quickly, he cracked four of them and held the hull halves to Ron. "Do you want to add them, or shall I?
Harry did his best not to show his growing rage. "Professor Snape's too, I expect," he said, almost lightly.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Everyone cares about something, I'll give you that." He sighed. "I want someone who agrees with me on a few basic goals, and otherwise cares nothing about my life."
"No need!" Kingsley said jovially, smiling like he was in a photograph. Harry supposed it was rather like that, talking to the screen. "I'll stop by in the morning, and you can update me then. It can't hurt to make it clear how thoroughly fucked he will be if he harms you."
Snape glanced heavenward. "And you must, of course, be the Gryffindor. Now do something genuinely courageous – write."
"Hardly," Draco drawled. "No, Apparation lessons start for those seventeen year old students who did not learn from their parents -- or at least not enough to pass Saturday's morning's preliminary test."
might, I suppose. I think if he's up for divination tonight, it might finally be time to take him to our clubhouse."
"Look, I have Neville as a roommate, right?"  When she rolled her eyes, he let go to punch her arm -- hard.
He felt her shift to fulfill her task, even as he continued on at an unconcerned walk. She reported no cause for alarm, so he did not need to turn. He wasn't surprised when the group slowed as they reached him.
Draco's eyes widened. "Of course! They haven't met you before! There are people who visit without me -- Hermione, for example, and the headmaster -- but I wouldn't send a stranger there unattended." He collected himself, his shoulders rising and settling back. "If Harry wishes time alone with you after introductions, I will not impose, of course."
He saw comprehension flash across Draco's face, and was sorry he had said anything. They couldn't have Snape probing about that. As Millicent's head of house, he would need to put a stop to it.
They stopped briefly at Snape's rooms to tell him they would be leaving early and would be careful, and then left the castle and headed down the path towards the village.
Harry had never heard this story from Snape, and it filled in gaps between his vision and Draco's arrival. He could imagine it: Draco bent low to his broom, fair hair white under his own silver light, black robes flapping behind him as he strove for yet more speed.
Harry blinked. He vaguely remembered that, in the manner of a blurry photograph, from the night before Draco had left for Easter. "Maybe?"  he hazarded. "Okay, so that's a point for her, but I also wouldn't want to drink that much again. Ever."
‘What time do you call this, Potter?’ Draco mumbles sleepily, and Harry hides a grin at Draco’s grouchiness. It comes as no surprise to him that Draco isn’t a morning person.
A number of people laughed.  Harry thought he even heard a snort from Snape, who had tilted his head up just enough to watch. That set him to appraising the others. Rob still looked thoughtful, but Yolanda was eagerly curious. Sammy had stepped back from the group, probably lost by the conversation, and was watching the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw brothers, who were sitting at the next sofa. They had a slightly familiar-looking board game set on the coffee table in front of them, but rather than playing, they were watching Harry and his group.
"Yeah, I expect I am," Harry admitted. "After all, I've never wanted him in prison -- or dead -- and he'll be safer with Wolfsbane than without."
"There you are!"  Parvati called to him when she arrived with her sister and Sophia. She waved a large envelope back and forth. "I brought clippings! Everything I found on you at the Malfoy Ball." She smiled over at Draco, who was just dusting the fruit with glittering sugar. "Draco, did you know your mother was seen at Casa Byron with Andromeda Tonks?"
It was slipped in quite casually. Harry smirked. "Let's just say I'm making progress on that project we discussed."
"Oh here -- let me push your robes up." In a few seconds, Draco was fumbling with Harry's zip, his knuckles brushing haphazardly over Harry's cock. "In an emergency, just do the button and drop your robes into place."
"I don't want to be stopped," Draco answered fiercely. "Cloak, Harry. Be a bold Gryffindor in the morning."
"Harry?" Blaise said, looking out groggily from his bed. "What are you doing in-- Never mind.  Don't answer that. Stupid question."
"Huhn. We should get someone from Artifacts in to trace it." The Auror looked over at them. "Potter, Malfoy -- are you all right?"
Draco followed Harry into his room and watched while Harry changed back into his jeans, and then gathered things from chairs and the floor and threw them hodge-podge into his trunk.
He expected Hermione to speak up, but she sat back. It was Gilbert who responded. "Before I agree," he said, "may I know why this is a dispute between you?"
Before Harry had finished unpacking, a knock came at his door. Anxiously wondering if it would be Draco or Dumbledore, he opened it, only to find Tom had returned.
"I'm bored," Millicent declared, when they were just about half-way done with the first wall. "Discover something else."
"Not really, just...." Draco shrugged. "I have three young ladies to talk to in private, and more to dance with. I'm not sure inviting you was a good idea."
that he understand -- both you and our relationship. And in the end, he may be easier to influence as a new wolf than as a man set in bad ways."
Malfoy dragged his toes across Eugene's black school robes, causing them to gap open over grey trousers.  "Sure." He smiled dazzlingly at Eugene as he laid a second flawless leg across that lap. "Thank you for your help."
"A good distraction then." Millicent shrugged. "Anyway, Granger was okay with me. She did go on about witches' rights some, but only to make sure I knew I had other options, and liked this one best. I think we understand each other better now -- although maybe not, if she's angry at you."
"Oh, no, you don't!" Vernon roared, his face growing red with anger. "I don't allow your sort in my home. This is a decent house, you know, and I won't have my wife and son exposed to more abnormal freaks from That School. Bad enough that we have to house the boy --"
They looked around at the cramped space around them and both decided it wouldn't do. Harry could see it when he met Draco's eyes.
"No. She was here from the Sirius Black investigation -- no repeating this, you realize -- to ask me for a memory and limited Veritaserum testimony. But after that, she invited Draco and me to lunch, and since the headmaster had approved it, it would've looked strange if I hadn't gone." He took a breath. "Sorry I couldn't get word to you earlier."
"All right." Draco sat back on his heels and Harry's knees. "Well, you know I did have a tendency to, um, listen at doors...."
