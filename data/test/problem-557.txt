Potter’s hands snaked up his body and rested at the base of his neck before long, cruel fingers tangled in his hair and yanked, jerking his head back. His body bucked with a jolt of searing electricity, zipping along his nerves, making them sizzle. Draco whimpered as he felt the heated rush in his body and he was consumed with the image of his blood flowing out into Potter’s mouth, pulsing through his veins, coursing with heat and
Malfoy's got that wand trained on him, but it's not Malfoy's wand, Harry knows, because Harry's still got it in a box under his bed at Grimmauld. This is one of those throwaway Ministry affairs given to parolees, a weak stick that doesn't do shit except for basic household spells. But Malfoy's face is set, holding that useless piece of wood like he would AK someone with it if he could, his body set into a defensive stance, with one hand reaching back behind him as if to shield another body. His mother's.
“Sane?” Potter finished.
Harry's stare holds the weight of his conviction. "Because you haven't earned it."
Draco's head jerks back and he howls, and Harry can see the drops of moisture that have leaked from his cock onto the floor. His balls are drawn up tight against his body, and Harry dips his head to snake his tongue out to dart over them. The rattling chains grow louder, because now Draco's trembling at every point of restraint. The line of his body is taut, defining the outline of long, lean muscle.
When he advanced, it was so quick that for a second he thought Potter was about bend him over and do exactly that. The sudden arousal that spiked let him know that his body didn’t seem averse to the idea. Especially when Potter stared at him with clear and blatant interest. Draco opened his mouth to head off any such rash decision with a snarky retort, but Potter’s eyes went soft and drifted to his neck.
From here Harry takes his time, drawing out every pass of his mouth, every flick of his tongue. He bites his way up over Draco's torso, nipping at the ridges of his abdominals. Draco's panting so much his upper body is working like a bellows, in and out, over and over again.
Then there's the Manor, pushing Harry into a place he, quite honestly, is more entitled to than Draco. And he thinks that maybe the Manor didn't bring Harry here for Harry's sake. Maybe the Manor brought Harry here for his own.
Draco’s eyelashes fluttered and images from the past flickered in his brain. Through the fog, he lamented that this would be how it all ended, with so much left undone between them, and the sad realization that there could have been more. This was Potter’s madness, Potter’s insanity, and if was Potter wanted to damn Draco along with him, he would go, but fuck if he would do it without at least letting Potter know what he was throwing away.
The repudiation in Harry's tone hits it mark. Zabini's face is blank for a moment, and then his lips curve into a cruel smile. "Attention?" he laughs derisively. "Yes, Draco's always been high maintenance. He's like a fat, spoiled housecat," he says with mocking spite. "Sooner bite you than look at you, but if you offer him a saucer of cream, he'll twine around your ankles and stick his arse in the air."
, you son of a bitch."
Draco breathed out, low and heavy. "You perfect bastard."
Harry feels his body shift to master control of his want, to project it outward, clearly, and with decisive intent. His voice drops low into a tone that he knows will brook no argument; it hasn't ever, not even with the most difficult of subs.
,” he sneered. “As if I’m not already intimately acquainted with the notion. And what the hell is a Consort?”
." He grinds out the last three words just to see Ron shrink. It always takes beating him over the head with the obvious to make a point. It's Ron's way, and Harry knows it, but he doesn't have to be happy about it. "You could have owled, or firecalled, or I don't know," Harry's voice drips with sarcasm, "knocked on the fucking door like a normal person."
“Potter.”
"So beautiful," Potter murmured against his neck. "You're so beautiful, Draco. Do it for me." Fangs grazed against the mark at his neck and Draco shuddered. "Come, baby. Come for me."
Harry smiled. "You could try."
Bill’s eyes shifted, but he didn’t move from in front of Draco. “Harry.”
"What is it, baby?" Harry asks, easing back to drink in the sight of him. "Tell me what you want, Draco."
Ron flops down onto the sofa Draco insisted upon adding to the room for his own comfort and groans. He tips back his head and slings an arm over his face. "I take back everything negative thing I ever said about your kind of relationships."
He can feel sweat blossoming on Draco's skin, and he can feel Draco's arse cheek warming with the rush of blood at the striking point. He turns his face and scrapes his teeth along the afflicted spot, biting down on the pink right cheek as his left delivers a punishing blow to the other side.
Silvestri snarled and his hand flexed to curl around Draco's neck, but Harry was faster, reaching out to wandlessly hurl Draco from his grasp and fling him to the ground several feet away into a bush. Instantly, the leaves morphed into rose petals and the branches went soft, cocooning Draco in a protective ball. Black thorns bloomed on the outside, razor sharp and twice as deadly, covering the makeshift nest in a tangle of pointed ends.
When Neville turns around again, his mouth falls open before transforming into a wide smile.
Sweet Salazar Slytherin, he's fucked.
"Idiots who can't see past the Mark." Her eyes hardened. "They roughed him up a bit, but he managed to escape serious injury. He said he was fine. I believed him."
The slow drag of skin on skin has to be rough, but it seems to be good enough for Draco. Harry doesn't feel the same way. A quick snap of his fingers has Draco's hand coated in conjured lube, and now his hand slips over his cock with a wet, slick slide. Draco cries out sharply at the increased sensation and his head jerks up to stare at Harry with wide, aroused eyes. Harry merely smirks in response as Draco snorts a harsh breath through his nose. The reduced friction has his hand moving faster now, and bless Merlin, he slows, obviously wanting to keep to the original pace Harry set for him.
"Did I hear Hermione?"
"People died," he said, voice rough and broken. "People I cared about."
Really...we're getting closer. I promise. Really.
The sad sentiment was breathed out with heart-breaking empathy, and in that moment, Molly Weasley resembled Narcissa Malfoy in spades. And because she looked so much like his own mother, Draco did exactly the same thing he would have done if Narcissa had indeed been standing there.
Harry smiles at him, genuinely pleased at Malfoy's shift in demeanor. Even if Malfoy himself doesn't recognize it, Harry does. All the more reason to stay and unlock more of Malfoy's secrets.
"No!" he hissed, shoving Potter back.
He grabs his coat. "I appreciate your concern, but honestly, it isn't necessary. I'll figure out something. I just need some space to do that."
"That's good."
Instantly, the piercing shards of agony that sliced through him muddled, morphing to a slow burn as Potter drank. The pull on his flesh was tugging and beckoning, and to his horror, his body was responding. This was nothing like the first bite. It was only a taste of what was to come.
"I am," he smirked. "Does that bother you?"
Draco had pulled Potter hard against him, and their bodies collided as he wedged his face into Draco's bared neck. Potter's hands reached out to clasp his hips, fingers brushing under the edge of his t-shirt to rest on the skin above the waistband of his jeans. Draco expected the rough curl of Potter's fingers to anchor them together, but instead, Potter kept his touch light, stroking in feathery caresses.
“If you’re worried about blood loss, I’m not about to faint on you, Potter.”
"Arse."
"Merlin," Hermione whispered. "If he's gone back there—" Her voice broke on a sharp breath. "You don't think—?"
She steps back and runs her fingers over his face once more with a sigh. "Draco, there is nothing I want more in this world than your happiness. Don't let your fear keep you from it."
Snape harrumphed and crossed his arms over his chest. "I was going to say 'just like I remember', you arrogant brat. I do believe that I have managed to separate the father from the son at last. But now that you mention it, no, this special brand of obstinacy has to be a Harry Potter original. Your father was an arse, but he was never this stupid."
Harry's eyes flick down to Draco's chest and he inhales sharply before meeting Draco's gaze again. "Think about what I said. I mean it, I won't chase you. The choice has always been yours." He steps back and retrieves the dressing gown from the floor. "And Draco, when I mark you again, it will be because you want me to."
"It's been quite troubling," Narcissa says. "They've bloomed perfectly like last year, but they just won't trill." She shakes her head with a soft sigh. "Perhaps I'm losing my touch."
"I was going to knock. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I didn't want to interrupt you, either."
For the first time in ages, the trademark Malfoy smirk felt right on his lips. “Well, then. Lucky you.”
Ron nods.
He complies, though he knows he couldn't move if he wanted to. Harry's a powerful wizard, but he's fairly certain the Manor could wipe with floor with him if it were so inclined. The smile on Narcissa's face is reassuring, and he can't detect any hint of malice in the magic. Yes, it's strong, but it's insistent, almost entreating in a way.
“Well, what do you think?”
His feet are lighter as he heads to the bathroom.
Potter.
"What's changed, then? Why are you here now?" Draco swallowed, knowing where Potter was going with his confession, but unsure of whether or not he wanted the answer.
Potter's eyes held a world of untold emotion. "Because you were right. You've given me back my life, at least one part of it, anyway. This is me, trying to give you back yours."
"I've changed my mind." He doesn't get to finish the statement, because Draco's face absolutely
Harry rises from the chaise with a whisper of satin as the dressing gown drags on the upholstery. Draco tracks every move as Harry crosses to stand in front of him. His face morphs into a shell of disdain.
"Yes. It's an easy question." His head nods, punctuating, "Are. You. Happy?"
Ron shoves him back. "Oi! I've had the good graciousness to apologize for my idiocy where your love life is concerned, and even gone so far as to, as much as it galls me,
with Malfoy. The least you can do is be happy and supportive of the sudden and apparent change to my sex life."
Draco moved to rise from the bed when Potter’s quicksilver reflexes kicked in. A hand shot out to grab him by the wrist, fingers digging into the tendons with enough pressure to halt his movement, but not hurt.
Molly sipped from her cup and set it down with a delicate clink. “I have something for you. From your mother.”
"Utter shite," Draco said flatly.
Harry puts his hands in his pockets and rocks back on his heels. "Come with me."
"I'm going to retire for the evening. Perhaps Draco can show you the studio this evening?"
Hypocrites.
"Sure thing, Harry," Neville chuckles.
"Severus was concerned."
Which is totally fine with Harry.
"It isn't—I don't—" Potter stammered.
He's going to be doing a lot of that from now on.
Harry says make it good.
Draco is silent for a moment, his brows are furrowed, and Harry can almost see the words tumbling around in his head.
The void on Potter’s face shifted, morphing into several emotions too quick for Draco to reconcile, before settling to a strange, eerie calm. The fingers continued their tapping.
She holds out a flip-flop covered foot. "I did."
Hermione tilted her head to the side, thinking. “Possibly, provided that you and he are cohabitating and fulfilling the requirements of the Consort bond. But, he would have to find a Ministry-approved brewer willing to sell to him once he was back on the list. And given how the media has touted his every crime, it’s not likely. It’s terrible, but that’s how it is.”
“Alright there, Malfoy?”
She smiles, nodding. "Blinky has our coats waiting." They turn and head for the hallway, and Narcissa calls over her shoulder, "Have a lovely day, boys."
The muscles in Potter's arms bunched and flexed as Draco fucked into his throat, and at that moment, Potter was the most gorgeous thing he'd ever seen. He took each stroke beautifully, and Draco panted, feeling that throat close around and him and suck. The orgasm started at the base of his spine, sizzling through his nerves and setting every part of him on fire. The sensation burst in short, sharp spikes, pulsing out through his cock and into Potter's waiting mouth.
First, his wandless magic is effortless. Not to mention wordless as well. It’s so unbelievably hot Draco could scream. Potter holds a hand out and a bottle of high-end lubricant flies into his outstretched fingers. Before he knows it, Potter’s teasing around the edge of his hole with a well-slicked finger. One finger slides in carefully, gentle but focused, and Draco’s breath stutters in pleasure. One becomes two, two becomes three, and then the head of Potter’s magnificent cock is breaching him, filling him up beautifully. Potter eases the rest of the way in, bottoming out on a harsh breath. His hips undulate, giving Draco three slow, maddening slides before he hitches Draco’s hips higher, leans over and proceeds to fuck Draco into the mattress.
"What? As gorgeous as Heinrich was, he was as thick as a post. There's something to be said for actual conversation, you know. One can only hear, "Fuck me harder" so many times before it gets tedious. In German, no less."
"He wants everything." The words fall heavy from his mouth, and Draco's a little amazed he didn't hear them thunk onto the rug.
"Who knows?" Draco shrugs. "You've been gallivanting across the globe for the better part of a year now. It's been hell trying to get an owl to you."
Draco nodded, not in agreement, but distractedly as she spoke. If Potter’s behavior was atrocious as he was led to believe, then there was little chance that any Potions Master worth his salt wanted to be responsible for providing The-Boy-Who-Lived-To-Be-A-Fanged-Menace with a license to wreak havoc in daylight hours as well as dark. There had to be a solution. Giving Potter back the ability to go out in sunlight might alter his perceptions of his situation. Possibly a way for him to feel more normal. It was something Draco needed to look into. And soon.
He doesn't know where the strength comes from, but he hauls Draco up and rolls him over to cover him with his body and kiss him breathless. The taste of himself is bitter on Draco's tongue, and he relishes in it, pulling back to rasp, "You're mine, Draco. Mine."
She pushed the scroll across to him and allowed him to read. His eyes scanned the parchment before he shoved it back without ceremony.
“Hermione’s in the Floo,” Potter replied, not shifting his gaze.
The sneer was growing more and more comfortable on his face. "Well, aren't you Little Miss Informed?"
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Ron said quietly. “I’ve been in on several conversations regarding Draco and a number of other high-ranking Death Eaters. Brought in to help ‘solve the problem’, as it were.”
Jealousy. Possession.
OOOOO
Draco's head jerks in a quick nod. "Yes—I'm sorry, Sir."
He pulled out one of the chairs and sat. “Tea would be lovely, thank you.”
“Blimey, mate,” Ron said after a moment. He sat back and blew out a breath. “Are you sure? I mean, just…okay, then.”
"I knocked, but there was no answer."
“Wouldn’t be the first time.” The words slipped out before he could call them back, and Potter recoiled as if Draco had slapped him. He knew the damage was done by the way Potter’s eyes shot to his chest and went hard as he noticed the scars from another bathroom in another time. Draco wasn’t sure if it was the steam from the shower or the blistering burn in Potter’s gaze, but the temperature rose between them as if the gates of Hell had just been thrown wide open. He was placing his bet on Hell, because Potter’s smile went deadly and his whole demeanor changed as he shoved Draco hard against the shower wall.
Harry grips the armrests of the chair tighter, preparing to see just how much the house is willing to accommodate him. "Fine," he says loudly into the air, "I'll accept the head. But I prefer to take my meals in a more intimate setting." That's the truth; he really doesn't want to spend the rest of his meals here down at the arse-other end of the table. The rectangular monstrosity seats sixteen, which given that it's only the three of them, is ridiculous. Harry waits, curious to see what happens next.
If he marveled at Draco's beauty before, it's nothing compared to what he looks like when he comes.
"You're a menace," he laughs. "Adorable and precious, but a menace all the same."
Draco brought his head down to stare directly into Potter's turbulent eyes, stopping him in place. "I can, Potter. And I will." Draco sucked in a deep breath and felt the resignation slip over him like a second skin. "Because I don't know how to love you and live with you. But I do know how to love you and live without you."
"Yes," Draco said, shutting the door. He sat down in front of the portrait. Dark shadows smudged underneath Draco's eyes, casting a pallor over his pale skin. He bore a look Snape hadn't seen cross his face in years: the anguish of an interminable situation.
"I want you in my bed, Draco."
"I'll let Cook know to expect one more for meals for the time being. The house-elves are at your disposal if there are things you wish to retrieve from your flat."
"Relax, Potter, we're here," Malfoy says, stopping at the end of the hall, and Harry can hear the eye roll in the haughty drawl. "This is your room." He flips a hand at the door. "I'm across from you. You'll find everything you need inside. Call for a house-elf if not." Malfoy sighs heavily and turns. "I'll see you at dinner."
at dinner, if not my son," she says smiling.
"Look, the pool of friends I have to share this with is painfully shallow. If anybody would understand, it would be you."
Lucius stands, unfurling himself from the chair, no doubt to tower above her. As if the portrait isn't already high enough on the wall. No pedestal is ever too high for Lucius Malfoy.
The item in question that's making Draco lose the last of his comportment is a large, rectangular metal frame. It's bolted through to the floor, fastened down by metal plates and rivets as big as Harry's thumbs. Two sets of restraints dangle from the top and near the floor: wide, thick leather with large, shiny buckles and lined with soft fleece. It's a rack designed for flogging, or any other number of intense activities, and even though they're not headed in that direction yet, Harry thinks what's about to happen will be just as intense. His chest aches with the thought.
Harry doesn't move, keeping the handle very still. "Do you know what that means?"
“Oh, well, problem solved, then,” Hermione chirped. “Also, I wanted to extend an invitation on behalf of Molly and Arthur. They would like it if you and Harry could come to a late supper at the Burrow tomorrow evening, and-”
"Absolutely," she replies. "I got tired of waking up in strange places with even stranger people. I've discovered if I'm going to have a good time, I'd like to remember it later. This way, I don't make the same mistake twice."
She nodded thoughtfully. “Yes. Those particular potions are under strict control from the Vampire Council and the Ministry. You have to be approved to just to get on the list for permission to obtain them.”
The point of a pearl-white fang peeked out as Potter's bottom lip rolled between his teeth. A tiny drop of blood welled there and he licked it away without thought. Draco's hard cock twitched under Potter's unwavering gaze, and the thought that Potter liked what he saw was a satisfying stroke to his ego. Potter's hand curled at his side and his eyes snapped up to Draco's face.
She shifted in her seat, and opened her mouth carefully, as if to measure her words. “Harry has had trouble…adjusting.”
"I do believe it."
"Green."
He came to a stop, eyeing the stone door with trepidation. Potter was a shadow behind him. "Go on, what are you waiting for?" he asked.
Harry stiffened, his hands curling into fists. "Where?" he snarled.
The blond head cranes around slowly. Silk-covered eyes turn Harry's way, and open-mouthed, Draco pants, "Shall I count, sir?"
"Malfoy," he says, drawing in a deep breath to stifle the laughter, "I honestly have no idea."
Ron gives him a half-hearted smile, "Shit if I know."
possible, Mr. Potter," she goes on. "The Manor is quite old, and the very land on which it sits is imbued with the most ancient of magics. For it to have heard your call and responded in this manner is indeed strange, but
"You're a lech," Draco laughs.
"He's going to help you pass your NEWTs. And then he's going to apprentice you."
“Do you actually eat?” Draco asked between delicate bites, silently blessing the house-elf for having above average cooking skills. “Or are you on a strictly liquid Malfoy diet?”
Dabbing at the corner of his mouth, he says, "You don't have to stay for me. I'm quite capable of finishing a meal by myself."
Draco’s head snapped up at Weasley’s shout, and he swiped the back of his hand across his face, wiping away the wetness that remained. He scrabbled to his feet and shoved the letter into his trouser pocket, walking out to meet Ron across the yard. Potter followed behind Weasley, and Draco was shocked to see the narrow, angry set of his eyes.
His arse is, quite literally, a sopping mess. Harry's spit is smeared all over the crack of Draco's arse, over his hole, dripping down over his balls. He rubs the bridge of his nose in hard, tilting his head to nip and suckle until Draco's high-pitched whine turns into a lust-filled moan.
“I’m afraid of the things you’ve done, yes,” she admitted. “But deep down, I’m not afraid of you.”
"I don't know," Harry says softly. "But I'm here, and this isn't going away. Not until we confront it."
He said it with a casual nonchalance that Draco could only stare at him in wonder. As if there was nothing at all strange about The Chosen One attending the funerals of notorious Death Eaters.
Silvestri kept his eyes on Draco's, not bothering to acknowledge Harry with a glance. "And so you join us. Isn't that nice, Draco?" Draco whimpered pitifully as Silvestri's fingers slid across the marks on his neck. Instant rage blazed in Harry's eyes, but he kept a tight lid on his temper. If the other vampire sensed even a brief loss of control, he would strike. Maybe at Harry, maybe at Draco. It was a chance he wasn't willing to take. Not yet, anyway.
"I'm not going to throw you into the deep end of the pool and watch drown, Draco. There is an order to be observed, and we will observe it. If you can trust me, there is nothing we can't do. I want this relationship, and I want you. It's your choice."
"If you're trying for subtle," Harry says, addressing the room at large, "you're failing miserably."
"Not directly, no. You were looking for something. Something that had been missing since he first spurned your hand. It colored a great deal of your relationships after that."
Potter lay on his cot, cool as you please, arms tucked behind his head with his feet crossed at the ankles. He raised his head and let his eyes trail down Draco’s body, over the faded blue t-shirt and jeans. Granger had been adamant he have something other than prison attire when he went to Potter. The thought that these clothes probably draped themselves on Ron Weasley at one point was horrifying, but he had to admit the muggle wear was indeed comfortable, and a far sight better than the ratty grey shift he’d lived in for the past two years.
"Go on, then. Tell me how it is."
Harry can tell Ron is on the verge of a heavy confession, and knowing the man like he does, he knows that heartfelt expressions don't come easy for his friend. Harry relaxes and waits him out to see if Ron finally opens up.
“Then he takes a Consort and lives.”
"I—I'm sorry, Harry," Draco whispers.
It was rough and fierce, and Potter was on fire, heat pouring off him in waves with an intensity unthinkable even for a mortal body. Draco’s cock throbbed against the constraints of Weasley’s jeans, and if that thought couldn’t squelch the need his body craved, well, he was damned anyway.
He laughs, and it's still the same throaty chuckle that tears at her heart and makes her gorge rise. The same condescending chuckle he always gives whether he's killing muggles or fucking Death Eaters in their bed. "Does guilt rob you of your sleep these days? Can your traitorous soul not find rest?"
“I see.”
There's a sob welling from somewhere deep in his soul, inching slowly upward like the spread of poison through his veins. He wants to scream. He wants to howl. He wants to not need this so badly. To not need Harry's direction and calm control to find that quiet place inside where he's
Hermione Granger-Weasley’s gasp caught in her throat as her husband shot up from his chair. “No! There’s got to be another way. We can’t force Harry into this,” Ron growled.
His eyes widen in shock and fear, and Draco's mouth falls open, equally dumbstruck.
“What do you mean?” Potter’s brow furrowed as if the meaning somehow eluded him.
Draco snorts. "I think discussing whether or not we find my mother and Longbottom
Draco's eyes open and they're liquid and shining, his full lips quivering. "Touch me," he whispers. "Just
“I won’t be where I’m not welcome.” He hated that his voice sounded suspiciously like a pout.
“Potter said you wanted to see me. I’m presuming this isn’t about tea.”
"Wonderful." She glides forward to Harry and presses her hands to his forearms, sliding them slowly upward over his shirtsleeves. Misinterpreted, it would be a lover's caress, but her under hands all Harry feels is gentle strength and reassurance. It's a mother's touch through and through, as old and eternal as time itself. Her hands rest at his shoulders and she assesses him with that same motherly gaze, like she's taking stock of his health. She pulls him softly toward her and Harry goes without hesitation. He eases into her embrace and winds his arms around her slight frame.
"No," he replies with a smile. "I'm saying that if you want these flowers to thrive, then you need to find what makes you happy. Or else you'll be resorting to digging in the dirt with the rest of us."
"What? To get back at you?" Harry snarls. "Jesus, Ron—"
"What aren't you telling me?" He stepped closer to the Floo, the acrid scent of her fear drawing him closer. "What don't I know?"
"Other than that?" Harry prompts.
Harry sips his coffee, and decides now that he's admitted to himself, there's no point in trying to hide it from Narcissa. "You're right, but I won't deny that I find him very attractive. In many ways."
"It doesn't really matter if it's about Owen or not," Harry says. "I've made my decision." He takes a long gulp from the glass, draining it and slamming it onto the table. "And apparently, the Ministry has made theirs. It's done. I'm not going back."
OOOOO
"Fine, fine," Harry chuckles. He clears his throat and says soberly, "You're the luckiest man I know."
The soft cotton shirt was indeed one of Potter's, left over from the things Potter had let him borrow. Somehow the shirt never made back across the hall. The fact that even after the wonders of house-elf laundering it still smelled like Potter was of no import.
Harry came downstairs to find Draco at the kitchen table, his profile backlit by the washed out overhead lights. He traced a long, aristocratic finger over the letter while the other hand lifted a half-full glass of red wine to his lips. He didn't look up as Harry approached the table.
"Relax," Harry murmurs beside him. "I think a bit of communication is in order."
"For fuck's sake, Potter, I'm not made of glass," he said, running soothing hands over Potter's arms, pulling him back. Tension coiled underneath Potter's skin, Draco felt it vibrating beneath the surface.
"Silvestri who?"
Hermione laughed alongside him. "Yes, well, there were several witnesses present, and it was all preserved by Pensieve. The vial will go into the archive along with the signed paperwork once it's filed." She patted his hand. "It was his suggestion that I be his proxy." Her eyes twinkled. "I think swotty Miss Granger has moved up in his estimation."
Two audible gasps catch his attention, and Harry forces his gaze to focus on his surroundings.
Potter was alive above him, marking patches of skin, dragging his tongue through blood and sweat, licking and teasing as his hands moved to grab at Draco with vise-like pressure. He was caught in the undertow of Potter's desire, his own hands scrabbling for purchase on Potter's body. Draco yelped at a particularly enthusiastic bite, his body shaking and trembling.
"I'm glad to be rid of you. You always were a cold and hateful bitch, Narcissa."
Draco's face screws into a bunchy little frown. "Kissing. I was promised kissing."
"Well," she breathes into the air. "That certainly is telling."
Ron shifts his arm and opens one eye to glare at him. "You don't know the half of it."
"I do. Dying in the course of duty is noble. The one thing your friends feared, but secretly expected." Draco's voice dropped. "But it went wrong, didn't it? Smugglers weren't prepared for the Great Harry Potter, and out of fear, they let you go. You didn't escape," Draco accused, eyes flashing. "They left the fucking door open, and you ran."
Draco looks at Neville's hand with trepidation for a split second, before he grasps it and shakes it with confidence. "Longbottom. Yes, it has. And I am well, thank you for asking."
"You speak so casually of souls, husband. One would think you had one for comparison."
Harry shakes his head with resignation. "No. I'm finished with the Aurors. They've made it clear where they stand, and I won't budge over a personal issue that has no bearing on how I do my job." He smears a finger across the condensation on his pint glass and sighs. "And even if they came back around, I don't think I can go back. It's about principle now."
Draco makes a grab for his clothes and Harry's hands flex at his sides, mind reeling with the implications all this has brought to light.
Harry watches her glide from the room, silk skirts swishing as she goes, before turning his attention to Malfoy. His mouth is indeed hanging open on a slight gape, and his expression is one of complete bewilderment. His eyes settle on Harry as he blows out a soft breath.
Isn't it?
Draco scoffed. “There’s potions for that, you know. You don’t have to hole up here-”
Potter’s head swiveled to glare at him while the others stifled bright chirps of laughter. Molly took the bottle and Draco’s coat, holding out a hand for Potter’s as well. The frown on his face dissipated somewhat as he handed it over.
“A sight better than Azkaban, at any rate.”
"May be he's just wanting to make a fashionable entrance. You know how dramatic he is," Harry scoffed.
Harry's hands reach up to grab the frame just below Draco's. He holds his body back to keep from touching, but close enough to feel the heat radiating from Draco's skin. His lips graze beneath Draco's ear, right at the dip behind his earlobe. It's a soft, reverent kiss, and Harry has to close his eyes as he breathes in Draco's scent. He kisses his way down to where Draco's neck meets his shoulder, trading in the chaste press of lips for a wet, open-mouthed perusal.
Weasley stepped forward and offered him his hand. Draco took it and smiled as they shook hands. “I’m still going to call you ‘Ferret’, you know. Old habits.”
"I think you'd like that. My hand on your cock. Stroking you. Maybe running my thumb over your slit. Would you be wet for me?" Draco sucks in a gasping breath as his chest heaves. "I think you would. I think you'd be absolutely dripping for me." Harry's eyebrow raises. "Are you wet for me now?"
"What is it?" Draco's voice is soft and breathy.
"I dare," Draco challenged. "I dare because it's the truth and you and I both know it."
Harry chuckles. "Of course. You don't think you're the only one affected by all of this? That you're the only one who might become overwhelmed?" He looks at Draco and feels the blood coursing through his veins. It's a heady rush. "I could very easily lose myself in you."
"Harry didn't mention that he and Draco are dating," Neville says casually.
"And you would?" Harry knows Draco means to sound combative, like the 'Scared, Potter?' of their boyhood taunts, but it comes out colored with genuine confusion.
Heat, searing and affirming, shot through him, radiating through his undead body. A gift of affection, possibly something deeper, made Harry want to come alive. Because Draco was life. His eyes were bright stars. His pale blond hair shone like the rays of the sun. His laugh caused the heavens to awaken and spill its light across the horizon. But daybreak was forbidden to creatures of the night.
The sound of his given name must have sparked something, because Potter flipped him over in a heartbeat and pressed the tip of his cock to Draco's entrance. He braced the backs of Draco's thighs with his hands, and pushed in, panting, "Say it again. Fucking say it again, Draco."
"I don't know why you feign otherwise, I know you know what's in here," Draco said, looking up from the envelope as he opened it. "Granger tells me that you and she have been deep in meetings the past few days. Why else would you be plotting with her if I hadn't passed?"
I love you.
His jaw locks as the rest of his face seethes with anger. "Bring me my son."
Potter's eyes narrowed on Draco's sharp and cogent protest. He clapped his palms on Draco's cheeks, yanking him forward to look into his eyes. "Fine?" Green eyes blinked incredulously into his. "How can you be—wait, you're not—?"
And it was Draco’s turn to splutter as Potter’s smile slid across his face when he replied with a cheery, “Yes.”
"Master Harry is to be eating. Blinky is be telling Miss Cissa and Master Dragon that Master Harry is being drawing. Miss Cissa is being pleased and sends Blinky with dinner."
Harry slips his hand to rest at the small of Draco's back and urges him to the door. "So you were. Shall we?"
"No, but the pain I would have caused you if I had finished that would have been just as great. To you. It would have destroyed everything, wouldn't it?"
Ron gives him a long, searching look before stepping back. "Okay. I'll deal with this. I don't have to like it, but I can deal with it. I can handle Malfoy." Ron sticks out his hand. "No hard feelings?"
Draco continues on his aimless journey, but never gets really far. He's not more than five feet away from Harry at any given point.
"Oh?" Harry cuts in. "Are you alright?"
Harry slips his hand from the table. "Good night, Draco."
“Of course he doesn’t,” Draco smirked. He reached out patted Potter’s hand. “Don’t run off, now.”
The word was a whisper between them.
!" Ron whines, as if the statement explains everything.
“Anyway,” Ron said, sucking in a determined breath to rise to his feet, “I have a bone to pick with His Pointiness.”
. You are
He was scruffy, from head to toe, more of a general rumpled appearance rather than lack of hygiene. Because if that had been the case, Draco would have refused to speak to him until he was scrubbed clean.
The vampire moaned, throwing his head back in rapture. "Fuck, you're so tight. So perfect. So perfect for me."
"It's not that simple, Mother." Draco shakes his head and leans forward, casting his eyes to the floor.
Draco stood and did up his fly, casting one more glance at Potter on the floor. His eyes were screwed shut, and he braced himself on one arm, panting into the open air. Draco swung a leg over Potter's head, stepped over him and walked up the stairs, never looking back. Not even when he heard the soft thump of Potter's body hitting the floor and the sound of muffled tears.
"It's the Ministry he doesn't trust," Potter said. "He thought that they would back out at the last minute and ruin this for you. So he suggested I attach my name. Even though they're all afraid of me, apparently my name still carries some weight. I came in at ten percent, just enough to look legit, and it all sailed through." Potter's hands clenched at his side. "Jesus, Draco, if you're that set against it, wait until it's all filed and legal and then fucking buy me out. I have no interest in having a say in your potions business. I was just trying to help."
Harry notes the subtle swallow of Malfoy's throat, mesmerized by the gesture. He can't help himself, he really can't, not with the sudden choppiness of Malfoy's breathing, or the bead of sweat that is glistening on his brow. "Yes," Harry murmurs, "but banked fires can burn slower and hotter than ones that flare and then flicker out. Maybe you haven't discovered the right kind of kindling."
"Day before yesterday, I think." Draco's face pinched. "It's not the letter. Potter needs to eat." The statement crossed Draco's lips as a matter of fact, yet Snape heard the underlying tone.
Narcissa lets out a hoot of laughter, and the unexpected sound is warm the air. "Darling, it's not your virtue I'm concerned with. If you're not careful, Harry here will steal your heart."
Draco laughed in spite of himself, imagining his godfather's face at Potter's outburst.
Something suddenly occurs to Harry, and his arms fall to his sides. "She doesn't know you're here, does she?"
“You said this was Walburga’s study?” Draco asked, determined to steer the conversation to less serious subjects.
Draco whimpers at the tingle of magic on his skin, and Harry knows he's overstimulated. His heavy-lidded eyes are barely cracked, his mouth open as his breathing struggles to level out, but his face is slack and sated. Harry kneels down next to him, wrapping the towel around his shoulders, careful not touch him directly. He's a bit of dead weight, and while Harry can handle him no problem, he casts a Lightening charm just to get Draco to his feet without any undue jostling. Harry walks him to the bathroom, murmuring soft noises of encouragement in his ear.
“Then keep it,” Potter said. “It should be yours.” He turned and went to the box over the mantle, opening it to retrieve something. “Along with this.” Potter faced him and Draco thought his knees might buckle. “Ten inches. Hawthorn. Unicorn hair core. Right?”
"I hope you enjoyed that," Draco whispered against Potter's lips, "because this is the last time we do this. You may need me, but you no longer get to use me. I don't care if you have to wank yourself raw and your hand falls off at the wrist. This is the last time."
It's there in the shadows from one blink to the next, and Harry can read the subtext. Malfoy's suffering from nightmares. Harry lets the sympathetic smile grace his lips.
"With your approval, sir."
"I sleep just fine, Renault," Draco replies with a drawl.
He feels Draco pull in a long breath and waits for the fond, yet slightly scathing critique of his ability he knows is bound to come forth. Draco's never been above taking the piss when it comes to Harry.
"Fine. But not to your face," he conceded.
Draco scoffed, his anger ramping at Potter's churlishness. "Spare me your fucking ego. You think you're the only one who's dangerous? I wasn't exactly a saint, myself."
A thing of worth.
"Fine, fine," Harry laughs. "But you know if it goes any further, at some point, there will be much discussing." He shoots Draco a knowing look. "In detail."
Draco is beautiful like this, perched on the edge of orgasm. Submitting, but at the same time unwilling to cross that line and give into oblivion.
"I don't give a shit who the fuck it is," Harry spits back, getting in Ron's face. "What the hell do you think you were doing, pointing your wand at Draco? You're an Auror, for fuck's sake!"
He could feel Potter’s distress returning, and knew that the comfort of his blood wouldn’t be enough to drive out the vampire’s demons so easily. And while he wanted, because Merlin, yes, he wanted, it was Potter’s pleasure he sought. Draco’s hand journeyed around Potter’s torso, sliding across the hard planes of his stomach, and Potter sucked in a harsh breath, no doubt realizing his destination. Draco let his fingers trail slowly, teasing with the pads of his fingers as they slid across sweat-slick skin that was tense with anticipation.
Silvestri chuckled before turning to Draco and offering a formal bow. He said nothing, and disappeared out the front door with a whisper of his black cloak.
Draco turned, feeling the release of emotions long tethered to his heart break free. It was all he could say, because with those words, he had nothing left for his father. Drops of crimson trailed after him as he approached his mother's tomb, and if he heard Potter's swift intake of breath, it didn't register as his eyes rested on the carving of his mother's name. This time, his right hand held nothing back, and he caressed the stone lovingly, as her own hand would have stroked through his hair when he was a child.
Draco's breath is coming in short, small pants now, and his eyes are glittering. "Praise, Sir."
He reached for the parchment and scanned the text before his jaw dropped in surprise.
Draco held his breath as Potter offered his in return and shook Arthur’s hand with a measure of familiarity. And he was just as surprised as Potter when Arthur pulled him and wrapped an arm around Potter’s back and clapped him hard.
Draco's newly-ringed finger glinted as his left hand hauled Potter in for a kiss. Potter sighed against his mouth, and Draco let everything he'd been holding back bleed out between them in a slick press of lips. Of its own volition, Draco's right hand pressed to Potter's chest and tapped.
“Good. Now, get dressed. And bring a coat. We’re going out, and it’s cold. I’ll be ready to leave whenever you are.”
The backs of his knees hit the bed and he grunted, smiling into Potter's kiss.
Harry smiles down at her. "It's been a lovely evening, Blinky, and I fancy a stroll back to my room. Care to join me?" He stretches out a hand and offers it.
In the next second, Potter apparates them to what he assumes is Potter’s bedroom, but he can’t look around to confirm. Not while Potter is pressing his hands against Draco’s chest and is doing a magnificent job of peeling Draco out of his suit, piece by piece. His only assist is to kick off his shoes because Potter has Draco otherwise occupied with panting roughly into his shoulder. Soon the five-thousand pound Huntsman is scattered across Potter’s floor and Draco can’t be arsed to care.
It's Draco.
Harry shakes his head. "So, you're saying that you had fabulous, and I'm assuming it was fabulous, sex with two women, everybody left happy, and there was no weirdness at all? Is that what you're saying?"
"Thank you, Harry."
"Go back to Heinrich, Renault. I'll send these along when I've looked them over."
"Not there," Draco whispers. "Not—just you, or proper toys. Not
He shifts helplessly in the ornate chair, a little disgruntled that he's being subdued. A quick glance down the table has him watching Narcissa as wonder flits over her face like the flicker of a candle. It pauses, leaving behind a receptive smile. She's apparently more in tune with what's going on, which isn't surprising.
His fingers curl around Malfoy's forearm, and Malfoy hisses at the contact, his eyes jerking downward. Harry's fingers are securely wrapped around the Dark Mark, and Malfoy snatches his arm away, rolling down the cuff of his sleeve. He supposes his own gasp is involuntary, and knows that Malfoy sees it as disgust. The horrified embarrassment on his face says as much. Malfoy opens his mouth on something that Harry instinctively knows is going to be an apology, because he figures Malfoy's been apologizing for the damn tattoo for ages.
Snape held his breath for two beats before casually casting his gaze over the rest of the room. In the silence, he offered, "Did you try his room? You told me he naps intermittently."
“Shut it.”
"Get dressed and get out."
He kisses his way up Draco's legs—over his shins and knees in turn—in a long, protracted sweep of lips and tongue. The scent of Draco's arousal is thick in the air, bittersweet and salty, and it makes Harry's mouth water. He's careful not to let any part of him brush against the straining of Draco's cock, and Draco whimpers as Harry bypasses it for the junction of where groin meets thigh. Harry closes his eyes and inhales deeply at this narrow strip of sensitized skin, committing Draco's scent and taste to memory.
Potter was doing this for himself, not just for Draco. His heart pounded.
"I want to fuck you, there's no doubt. I want to put my hands and mouth on you and make you beg for it. I want to tie down and spread you open with my tongue. I want to slide my cock into your body and fuck you so hard you forget your own name." Draco pales at the blatant declaration, but then Harry watches as the blood slowly creeps back, flushing high on his cheeks. His pupils dilate until only a ring of gray is visible, and there's a growing bulge at the front of his trousers. "I want all of that and more. I want to talk to you, laugh with you, spend time with you. In bed and out. It's true I don't know why I'm here, but it's pretty clear that you're a part of it. And if it didn't feel right, I'd know, because there's no way my magic or my conscience would allow me to stay if it wasn't." Harry shoulders out of the dressing gown, dropping it to the floor with a swish. "I'm not perfect," he says, running his hands over the circular-shaped scar on his chest, "but I'm a good man. And this is what I have to give you. A scarred body and a reshaped soul that is as demanding as you think it is. I know what I want, what I need. But if you aren't the least bit interested, tell me, and that's the end of it."
"I was thinking of spending some time in the library this evening." Harry places his napkin on the table, he lets out a groan of contentment. "My luck I'll probably fall asleep in there. I ate far too much. Please forward my appreciation to Cook."
The vampire's breath ghosted over his tailbone as hands kneaded the globes his arse. Draco shut his eyes and whimpered as Potter kissed the small of his back, punctuating the soft gesture with a rough bite. He licked over the mark, moving that damned tongue in heavenly circles, drifting lower and lower until he found his prize. Potter prised his cheeks apart, swiping his tongue over the crack of Draco's arse.
“How did it happen? Potter?” he muttered.
. He's never had a sub receive like this, never had one who has so much to let go, and been so willing to let it happen. It's a tipping point on the scales, and Harry's brain can't comprehend the magnitude of what is happening. Because Draco is so good for him, so blessedly
Zabini makes a strangled noise. "You—you can't—that's—that's not possible—"
She stepped inside with a brisk smile and shut the door behind her.
Potter's hold on his arm tightened. "I-well, Hermione thought you might like to see your parents. Your mother, specifically."
Her exclamation cuts off as Harry hears from the hallway, "Harry! Harry! Where the hell are you, mate?" Seconds after Ron's booming shout, he tumbles into the room. Before Harry can utter a word, Ron's got his wand out, trained on Draco, whose eyebrows shoot into his hairline. "Stand back, Malfoy!" Ron shouts. "Just get away from him!"
“I don’t think there’s much we have to say to one another anymore, is there?” he replied.
He mouths underneath Draco's chin, and Draco's head falls back on a moan that vibrates onto Harry's lips. Harry smiles at the wanton sound.
The door closed behind him with a soft click.
"To my knowledge, they aren't," she replies. "At least not yet," she adds with a smile.
And that starts right here, right now.
Draco swallowed, bringing much needed moisture to his mouth. "This is one hell of an apology."
The looming four-poster with its wide and downy-soft mattress is still inviting even though it's no longer fastidiously made. A pleasant hum vibrates through Harry as he stares at the bed sheets. They're a rich blue, swirling and inky as twilight, and the hum of magic strengthens as he imagines them outlining the shape of another body. Pale, creamy limbs contrast with the dark, buttery silk as they drape over the curves and angles of a lithe male form.
She returned the embrace and pulled back. "So you see why you can't kill him yet?"
The breath left Harry’s lungs and he leaned forward on his knees. “Fuck.”
Draco hissed at the lance of fire that ripped through his blood, biting back a terrible whine. Potter's hand snaked around the back of his neck, pulling him upright with one hand as if it were nothing. The vampire crouched back to a half-sit, supporting Draco's weight with his other arm, fucking up into him at breakneck speed. Draco crooned and wailed, wrapping his arms around Potter like a lifeline.
Her speech is formal, her gestures even more so, but there's something so comforting about her presence that sticks in his throat, leaving him unable to croak out anything more than, "Ha-Harry. Call me Harry."
"If I'd known it was going to be a two-day trek, I would have grabbed another one of those sandwiches for the trip."
It touches him, deep down, to see Malfoy standing there, all front and bravado, ready to defend his mother from wayward ex-Aurors who have suddenly lost the ability to not spontaneously Apparate. Malfoy, the ex-Death Eater, with his perfect feet, worn trousers, and no-good wand. Malfoy, looking delectably pink and flustered. Malfoy, who, in this moment, is the most gorgeous thing Harry thinks he's ever seen. It's absolutely ludicrous. And of course, because Malfoy is the git that he is, he has to ruin it by opening his spiteful mouth to snarl, "What the bloody fuck, Potter?'
"But everything was willed to you, wasn't it? That should mean something," Harry entreats.
Something cold skittered down his spine and Draco swallowed hard against it to reply, “I’ll just get dressed then, shall I?”
Harry turns off the taps and leads Draco out of the shower, toweling him dry with slow motions, conscious of Draco's every breath and sigh. Harry's soaking wet but he doesn't care, only managing a half-hearted Drying charm on his own clothes. It's Draco's comfort he's concerned with.
She sets her book to the side and pats the cushion next to her. "Tell me."
“I suppose.”
Snape regarded Draco's drawn face as he entered the lab, envelope clutched in his hand. "I see your results have arrived."
He turns and sits cross-legged on the grass, facing her. "Do you transplant your cuttings from here to the garden by magic or by hand?"
It's so simple, and yet so complicated. He wants to show Draco what it's like to give in to pleasure, rather than having it taken from him. He knows it's also the hardest for Draco to reconcile. Submission under force comes easy for the Slytherin, especially when he feels that's all he's worth. This kind of pleasure, slow and syrupy-sweet, burgeoning with honeyed emotion is something Harry knows Draco will have to learn to take.
"Enough." He doesn't need to shout over Malfoy, because the moment his mouth opened, Malfoy's eyes latched onto his face.
That gets his attention, and Draco shakes off the fog, backing away. "I'm going, but please, can I say one more thing?"
Harry takes a breath and puts his napkin in his lap as Blinky pops in with plates for Draco and himself. He finds Narcissa's gaze over the table. "I suppose this means you and Neville are headed back to the greenhouse today?"
“Of course,” Ron replied, not missing a beat. “Everyone’s on board, well…maybe not Percy, but nobody cares what he thinks anyway. Arse.”
Harry leans in, letting his body weight come down on the hand around Draco's throat, forcing gray eyes to meet him own. Draco will give in. Draco needs to trust.
“That’s not what I meant,” Potter snapped, following Draco into the room.
His head turns to catch her gaze and his eyes glint, even though the sky is overcast.
Draco glared at him in response. "Yes, it must be
“Fine,” Potter replied through clenched teeth. “We can leave?”
Potter waited, staring at the door until the wards rippled, and then he turned back to Draco and waved his hand, dispelling the charm. Before Draco could open his mouth to speak, Potter was in his face.
They've almost reached the clearing where the greenhouse stands alone, wide and high among the grounds, and yes, Neville's gait has most certainly faltered. The slow pace gives her more time to realize how solid he is next to her. Solid. Strong. Unyielding.
Draco nuzzles close to his ear. "Was I good?"
At his stiffening, she let Potter go and turned her eyes on Draco, sniffing delicately. “And you, Draco, how good of you to come.”
“Yes, the house is under Ministry control, but the grounds are still protected by blood wards. They’ll open for him.” She cut her eyes at him. “And for you as well.”
"Marry me, Draco. You wanted me to take a risk and allow myself to love you. So I jumped in with both feet. It took losing you to do it, and I don't ever want to make that mistake again. It's your turn to jump."
Shame.
Damn the woman for smiling with all the smugness of a Slytherin.
Alluring.
He comes like a herd of Thestrals. Thick, white ropes of it over his hand and the tile, mouth groaning out Harry's name. Draco feels the last of his anguish spurt out with the last pulse of his cock.
"I told you not to worry about him."
The creak of the stairs gives Harry away as he walks into the kitchen. He smells like damp lemon and lavender and he knows Harry’s been pilfering his favorite body wash…again. He’s got to keep stirring so the sauce won’t scorch, so he doesn’t turn when Harry sidles up behind him and wraps strong arms around his chest.
am no masochist." Draco takes in a deep breath, and his gaze flickers across Harry's face. "He wanted something without bounds, someone he could debase and degrade to no end. No limits. And I couldn't stomach that, not with his intentions."
He pants, open mouthed, practically choking on the spray. He spits and snorts and shakes his head, slumping forward to brace one forearm on the tile wall. Draco lets his forehead press against his arm, taking his weight as he continues fisting his dripping cock. He feels heat coiling at the base of his spine, and he gasps. Out of the corner of his eye, he catches a glimpse of black on his skin and his blood turns to ice.
The half-barked croak makes Harry chuckle. He pulls back and settles the blindfold over Draco's eyes. After it's in place, he runs his hands along the length of Draco's torso, feeling him tremble and quake at Harry's touch. They stop at Draco's hips, and Harry pushes forward, urging him to meet the edge of the table.
He writhed and bucked, wanting to shove Potter to the side. It was no use. Potter was unbelievably strong, and Draco’s efforts were for naught. The vampire pressed down on him with the weight of darkness and the pressure of a thousand stones, his punishing grip cutting off Draco’s air supply.
Hours later, the sunlight is high overhead, streaming down into the greenhouse, and even with cooling charms, the heat is noticeable.
Potter moved forward now, advancing on Draco, emanating danger and icy wrath. He stopped, barely a breath in front of Draco, waiting for Draco to continue.
Potter stretches out along his back, rubbing against him like an overly affectionate kneazle, except this kneazle moves a hand down to let two fingers lightly stroke across his puffy rim. Draco sucks in a breath as those two fingers slide through the mess of Potter’s come only to push it back inside. Potter growls and bites down on Draco’s earlobe as he shallowly finger fucks him, thumb rubbing in playful circles for added stimulation.
Draco’s eyes slid shut as the echo pounded softly in his ears, moving through his body to vibrate at a steady rhythm. Potter’s chest grew warmer and warmer beneath his hand, and he could feel the reverberations spread out from underneath his fingers and into Potter, as if he were willing Potter’s dead heart to beat by touch alone. Magic tingled along the edges of his skin, sparking tiny fires that rippled out, and he gasped at the unexpected, yet arousing sensation. Potter tensed, and Draco’s eyes flew open.
"Oh, I saw it," Harry replies with a chuckle.
“She was alright for a while, and we had sort of a truce going. But then I was Turned, and she became downright nasty.” He crossed his arms over his chest. “Should’ve known better I guess. But she pissed me off one too many times, so I shut her up for good.”
Potter reached out and tentatively grasped Draco's hand on the back of the sofa. "Wherever you are, getting better, taking it one day at a time. Together." Potter's touch was cool and familiar, his thumb idly stroking the back of Draco's hand. "I can do this without you, Draco. I think we've both proven that we can love each other and live apart. But," Potter's eyes flicked upward to meet his, "I don't want to. The question is—do you?"
He hasn't moved to look at her. His focus is still on the flowers.
The question is a pleading whine, and Malfoy's face winces at his own words. He's floundering still; Harry can see it in swirling in his eyes. He's got nothing to cling to. So Harry makes the decision for him. He'll be the anchor. It's up to Malfoy to reach for it. Manipulation has never been Harry's style, because manipulation is fraught with deceit. Harry will steer him back, but Malfoy's got to choose the path.
Severus' mouth pulled into a tight line. "Less than a minute and you're giving me lip. I think that's a record." Draco opened his mouth to snark back, but Severus continued, "Have you forgiven him?"
"Ah, well, I'm sure he'll turn up. Were you planning on waiting for Potter, or are you going to keep me in suspense as to the fruits of my tutoring efforts? It wouldn't surprise me if you were." The tone was as dry as he could make it, and the sound hit its mark as Draco's lips curled into a fond smile.
"What are you talking about?" Potter growled.
Potter's eyes glistened as they welled with moisture, but he neither spoke nor moved. And that said more than any of the fighting or the fucking between them.
He stands up and faces her. "If you're sure. This can't be appropriate. I wouldn't want to offend."
Draco licks dry lips and manages, “We’d really all be dead if it wasn’t for you, wouldn’t we?”
Draco leans over. "Well done, Harry. You made the barmiest of the lot cry. I'd double check everything before I put it in my mouth from now on."
And if she feels like she's lost something when he does, she pushes it to the back of her mind.
He wants to reconcile everything that's happened, but there's too much emotion thrumming through his blood at the moment. Draco is something to behold. Something Harry knows he's been missing. He's unable to take his eyes off Draco, and he lies there like that, just watching, for several hours before sleep claims him as well.
Harry frowns in question.
He straightened his papers on the coffee table and stood. "Of course not, do come in."
That admission hit him like a Bludger to the chest and Draco rolled, setting his feet on the floor and placing his head in his hands. It was a dream he knew well, after all, he’d had it often enough over the years. Somehow he didn’t think it meant the same thing to Potter. “You should sleep. I’ll let you rest in peace,” he murmured from between his fingers.
Draco rises slowly and turns, kneeling on the cushions and placing his hands as directed. His head falls forward and his eyes close again. His breathing is rapid, but he's breathing in heavily through his nose to calm himself. To trust Harry. It's a pleasing sight.
His fingers curled into the hem of his t-shirt as he balled it up, shoved it into his mouth, and screamed.
Because Harry says.
you inside that fucking frame," Potter interrupted.
Pain.
There's no magical tweak; this time the fantasy is all Harry. He smiles as he palms his half-hard cock. Harry puts some serious consideration into having one off right now. Merlin knows he's good for it. Draco, wet and wanton, makes for excellent wanking material. Harry's no slave to his desires. He knows if he waits, all the better. He finishes his shower and steps out, wrapping a fluffy towel around his waist. He wraps up his ablutions with the toothbrush and paste in the cabinet and a drying charm on his hair.
"Yes, Blinky, tea would be lovely. Thank you."
Draco stiffened. "I didn't think you were going to kill me, Potter."
Potter licked him clean with the reverence of a saint for his deity, then slid back up Draco’s body to mouth at his lips. Draco returned the kiss half-heartedly, panting through the blissful fog that enshrouded his brain.
Potter was silent for a moment, then blew out a breath as his features relaxed. “Things were complicated after the end of the war, and we realized that neither of us were the people we thought we were. So we broke it off. But not before she came to the conclusion that I’m gay,” he added with a hint of scorn. “Which isn’t the case. She couldn’t accept that it was more the fact that we were unsuitable.” He shrugged. “I never identified as gay. Never really thought about it.”
Draco's eyes grew in surprise. "Severus allowed you to sign legally binding paperwork for him?" He stuttered a breath. "That's—that's…I can't believe that." Draco shook his head. "I have no words," he chuckled.
"I'm going to be opening a shop here in Wizarding Britain. Ready to wear for the everyday witch and wizard. I'm quite excited. It'll be a lot more work, but I think it will be worth it." She gives him a thorough once over. "You'll have to let me dress you, Potter. I know for certain that isn't something you picked out on your own."
“Well, now you do,” Draco replied, stepping closer, getting his first good look at the Savior in two years. Potter had changed, that much was true, but there were still traces of the Boy-Who-Lived, and it made him understand why Granger was so adamant that the old Potter still existed. He was still there, in a certain slant of light, from the mop of unruly black hair to the square of his jaw (which Draco had to admit he’d grown into), down to the faint flicker of innocence lost in the sparkle of his green eyes. But it was the overpowering sense of danger and the intriguing aura of darkness that made those old vestiges so disarming. Draco’s heart slammed in his chest with the knowledge that this Potter knew how to make those familiar traits work to his seductive advantage. No wonder he’d been biting half of Wizarding Britain. They were probably queuing for him in droves with a look like that. And now that look belonged to Draco.
It was on the tip of his tongue to remind him that not more than twelve hours ago Potter had been knuckles-deep inside Draco’s arse with his mouth wrapped around his cock, and if that didn’t make one gay, well, what did? But the resigned expression and strained tension on Potter’s face made him decide on the better part of valor and keep his opinion to himself for the moment. However, there had already been two clear (and very, very gay) occasions in which Draco would have bet good Galleons on Potter riding the proverbial broomstick, so he formulated his interrogation accordingly.
Draco felt himself smile before he could contain it. He took her hand and shook it warmly. “Draco Malfoy, chew toy to one Harry Potter.” And strangely enough, it didn’t sound so bad. Then again, he had yet to see how much Potter had actually changed.
between them."
"And that's—that's Neville Longbottom."
The door opened and with a glimpse of soft, brown hair, Draco was transported.
Harry shakes his head. "Nope. This is the first I'm hearing about it."
Harry uncrosses his legs, his bare foot falling to rest on the other side of Draco's knees. He's framing Draco now, and he eases forward, letting his forearms come to rest on his thighs. The position puts his face level with Draco's. He casts a quick glance downward.
OOOOO
It's all a lie, and Harry knows it.
He turns, and her hand falls away. She can feel the heat in her cheeks, and she knows she must be flushed. They're so close, almost touching, and if he takes a deep breath, they will collide. Her head tilts back automatically in order to look properly at his face.
It wasn’t even the promise of the orgasm that was building that had him reeling. This was it. This was
She's in his arms in an instant, enfolding him in sweet jasmine and crinkly silk. Her hand is pressed to the top of his back, right between his shoulder blades. It's so comforting, so warm, this different fire that she incites to burn inside him.
He's still enough when Harry buckles his ankles into the restraints, but the faint clink of the chain makes Draco's breath catch. Harry lets his fingers linger on the divot behind the joint, stroking softly to ground him. He wants to bend down and kiss him right there, run his tongue along that indented patch of skin, and find out if that will make Draco shiver.
Harry's cock jumps in his trousers as Draco's eyes widen and he swallows.
Too eager. That should have been his first clue. A true sub would have made Harry work for his submission, to prove himself worthy of such a gift. He snapped his fingers and Owen jumped. Too easy.
," Draco growled, affronted that he had to brew the shit in the first place. Snape was mocking him, he was sure of it. "I don't know what else you want me to say about it." Draco threw up his hands in frustration. "It smells exactly the same as when I brewed it at Hogwarts. Perfectly."
“I would ask you to sit, but you won’t be here that long, will you, ‘Mione?”
"I see."
He expected resistance, a protest, a harder pull at his vein even, but Potter’s mouth went slack the instant he spoke, lifting to swipe a pointed tongue across the punctures to seal them. Then Potter’s lips were on his, gently prying for entrance, which Draco granted on a breathy sigh.
The good-natured chuckling from the rest of the table was encouraging. Potter, however, wasn’t amused.
It's not particularly attractive, not like the carved wooden cabinet, but the table is low, cushioned with a thin bit of leather-covered padding. When they used this room before, the rack stood here, but the Manor has seemingly scuttled it away to a magical unknown and left this piece in its wake per Harry's mental request. Given Draco's expression and eagerness, Harry wonders if the Manor read his mind as well.
"Well," he adds, "I did sort of have a destination. The meeting with my friends didn't go well, and I was in a rotten state of mind. Then the reporters started shouting from the end of the street, and I knew they would follow if I ran. I was thinking that I just needed some space, some time to deal with…certain difficulties in my life right now. I wanted some peace. I think I called 'sanctuary', and the next thing I know, I'm here."
"Good," Harry purrs, and he can see the ripple in Draco's shoulders at the low praise. "Like that—slowly."
Potter's hands clenched at his sides, and the glare in his eyes promised untold violence. Snape let his gaze flick over the vampire in disdain and continued, "As usual, you don't have any idea what you're doing, or you do and you don't care. I'm not certain which is worse."
Fear.
Silvestri’s eyes met hers and the vampire nodded. “Listen to your wife, Auror Weasley. Let her cooler head prevail, and you may save your friend yet.”
"I have seen a shirtless man before."
Harry swallows a mouthful of fluffy omelet. "We did. I think Draco and I have come to an agreement to put the past behind us."
Malfoy slings an ankle over his knee, letting his bare foot just hang out there between them. He's settled into a light slouch since his mother left the room, and the change in position has left the collar of his shirt to spread wide, revealing the hollow in his collarbone. Not to mention the looseness of his shoulders, a smattering of platinum fringe over one eye, and the splay of his hips at the slight scrunch of his spine. The pose is lazy, indolent, and altogether magnetic. If a herd of rampaging Thestrals entered the room, Harry knows his eyes would still be on Malfoy.
Harry's hand falls away instantly. "Acknowledged. Do you want to go on?"
“I couldn’t sleep. I keep hearing you,” Potter said, shaking his head. “It’s getting louder and louder. It’s all I can hear.” The vampire’s voice was strained beyond measure and his hand crept from Draco’s cheek to cradle his jaw. “You’re everywhere in this house now. I’ll be able to go anywhere and hear you.” The hand tightened. “I don’t want to hear you.”
Harry nods and Draco continues.
“Potter!”
And of course, standing to the left of the desk, is fucking Potter. Stilted pleasantries are exchanged, Potter looks indescribably smug, and Draco sits at Robards’ direction. From there, it’s all shot to hell when Robards opens his mouth and reveals the real reason for calling Draco back from France. This case has little to do with potions, and absolutely everything to do with rogue Death Eater terrorist cells. Even worse, they expect him to liaise with, of all people in the known universe, his fucking father. From Azkaban. Before Robards can say anymore, Draco bursts from the chair and tells them no in an exceedingly colorful series of expletives that makes Robards stand and splutter and Potter roll his eyes and chuckle.
"Miss Cissa is needing tea for her guest?" The house-elf curtsies with a flair. The frothy ruffles on her equally yellow dress bob with her movement. Harry tamps down the urge to smile at the ridiculous sight she presents.
Harry sucks in a breath and barks out a laugh. "Oh no, I'm afraid I knew the exact moment you set foot on British soil. You've tried three times to access your seized vaults at Gringotts, been denied entry to La Cave twice, and consulted with no less than six Ministry lawyers in an attempt to do Merlin knows what—" Harry flicks a dismissive hand in the air, "I got bored with it and moved on." He looks to Draco and smiles warmly. "There are more important things that require my attention."
00000
Snape drew back into the chair and let the professor take over. "When is the last time you saw Potter?"
Potter’s eyes sparkled with interest. “But what if you could? Find a Master to apprentice you, I mean? What would you do? Open your own shop?”
“Six months ago. He and Ron went on a raid to Yorkshire. Whisperings of a Death Eater enclave or some such nonsense. It turned out to be a smuggling ring, and they were separated. Harry was captured, but fought his way out. They had taken his Portkey, and before he was coherent enough to Apparate, he was taken down by a rogue vampire. Completely unrelated to the case. Wrong place, wrong time. For once, luck wasn’t with him.” She told the story with perfunctory distance, as if she’d had to repeat it frequently, but to Draco’s ears, she couldn’t disguise the heartache it left behind.
“If you would take a moment to look at this from all sides, Harry—”
The thought is simultaneously terrifying and arousing, and the blood rushes to his cock in a painful surge, making sweat break out across his hairline and blurring his vision like he's been knocked in the head by a Thestral. He snorts against Potter's absurdly arrogant declaration, but there's a thrum within him that shaking its head and forcing him to look closer. No, it's not arrogance that Potter's throwing around, it's a deep-rooted confidence. One that bleeds capability. One that's got Draco's cock pulsing to beat the band, eight to the bar, a four on the floor jive of
If Potter wanted to deprive himself, who was he to argue? He certainly wasn’t going to bed, and he most definitely wasn’t going to push the issue, lest he find himself on the angry end of those sharp fangs.
The orgasm takes him completely by surprise, and he cries out as the rush blazes through him, igniting like wildfire. Potter’s whispers don’t let up, not at all—Draco takes his cock so well, Draco is hot and tight and perfect, and Draco is beautiful when he comes. Potter’s breath goes sharp as he groans out his release, spilling inside Draco with his name on his lips.
"No doubt."
"Draco," she warned.
“No. It’s fine, really.”
"I asked you a question, Draco. Will you let me care for you?" It's an admonishment, but it holds no heat.
Her heart clenched as Ron stared back at her, tears welling in the corner of his eyes. “I just want my friend back.”
Potter thought about it for a moment, then shrugged. “Not really.”
Draco grabbed Potter by the wrists and wrenched his face free. He sneered at the vampire, "You're not the only one who can throw off a thrall, you know. Despite my failings, I'm still an above-average wizard."
Draco nodded as Ron turned and headed back inside. The tall Auror spared a fond smile for Potter as he passed. Potter’s hands unclenched and he came forward with purpose. He was about to open mouth and offer a platitude of some sort, but Potter reached out with both hands to cradle Draco’s face and draw him into a soft kiss. It was a firm, but yielding press of lips, and Draco’s breath twisted in his lungs. Potter pulled back and dropped his hands to his sides, his face furrowed in consternation.
“You can come out now, Malfoy. She’s gone.”
“What’s this?” she asked.
"Yes, Harry."
"Well, that was certainly eloquent," Severus drawled. "For Potter."
Rage coated in shame rushed through his veins. “Enough!” he snarled. “Don’t talk to me about Ron.”
Harry chuckles with him. "Yeah, I've never envied you that."
"This isn't about Owen," Hermione snaps before Harry has a chance to. She glares at him, and Harry knows full well she doesn't believe it. This is
Draco turns to look at him with apprehensive eyes, and it makes Harry want to drag Blaise Zabini back to England by his bollocks.
"Well, I don't know. But apparently I'm going to find it here. And I'm not leaving until I do."
"Oh, God, Draco. I'm—Fuck, we should stop. I can't—I don't want to hurt—"
A quiet conversation in a public setting generally avoids any unpleasantness, but of course, Gilles is determined to be difficult. When Draco tells him firmly (Draco is cold, yes, but never intentionally cruel) that their acquaintance has come to its inevitable end, Gilles takes the opportunity to deliver a performance worthy of a BAFTA.
There was a brief pause as they locked eyes, Draco’s wrist stuffed into Potter’s mouth, and for a second, he thought Potter was going to kill him. The danger in Potter’s eyes never dissipated, even as his fangs sunk deep into Draco’s flesh.
"How is Blinky to be helping Master Harry Potter?"
The shower took up one entire wall and was tiled with an intricate and gorgeous dragon mosaic, the scales glittering from every angle. Multiple showerheads sprang from the walls, and at the back of the room, an enormous sunken tub spread out like a pool. He turned on the tap, and the shower came to life. Soon, steam was billowing out into the bathroom. Draco lifted his face and inhaled, the warm, moist air already feeling refreshing. He stripped out of his borrowed clothing and rummaged through one of the cabinets to find some halfway-decent shampoo and a body wash that reminded him of his own homemade concoctions. Clearly, some of Granger’s influence had stuck with Potter.
. His body is lax and half-twisted among the sheets, and there's enough skin peeking out to make Harry's pupils dilate, widening to soak in as much of the sight as possible. He sleeps with the heavy repose of the sated and utterly satisfied, spent for all the best reasons, like Harry's completely fucked him out.
Potter rolled his eyes. “Yes. It means-” he paused, then sighed. “I’ll get you a phrasebook or something.”
"A number of reasons. All of them personal, thank you very much." Draco's frosty tone isn't steady.
She laughs, a full-throated chuckle that booms out into the room. Her arm snakes into Harry's and she tugs at him. "We'll owl you an invitation to the bonding. Come, Potter. It's time you properly introduced me to your Weasleys. Ronald looks like he's got the bristle end of a broom up his arse, and Granger's shoes are exquisite. I feel like mingling."
Draco pushed his shoulders back. "If you're finished."
They've stopped, and the entrance to the greenhouse is not but inches away.
The smile slides from his lips and he looks her over with a hungry, roving gaze. A pregnant second passes before he whips the shirt off over his head, tossing it to the ground with little ceremony. She registers the wide expanse of muscled chest and the tangy scent of salt and earth before he turns to give her full view of what she asked for.
Potter bit at his lips, nipping the swollen flesh, as he pulled harder, pressing them ever closer until every point of contact was a harsh drag of sweat-dampened skin. It was all rub and fire and possession and Draco cried out with a whimper as Potter's fingers tightened painfully on his hips. They ground together, the coarse hairs on Potter's legs and groin skating across his skin with a sandpapery rasp. Potter kissed down the side of his neck, never loosening his grip, until lips and teeth rested over his heart.
“Thank you.” If he felt at all odd about thanking a house-elf, it didn’t register, and he waved the thought away as he ascended the stairs, choosing instead to focus on a hot shower and a bed that waited. As he passed down the hallway, he noticed the absence of lamplight coming from beneath Potter’s door. He briefly entertained the notion of nudging open the door to see if Potter slept in a coffin or some such rot, but thought better of it.
Harry slides into wakefulness with a half-smile on his face and a comfortable lethargy in his bones. He stretches his arms over his head, relishing the tender pull of muscles and tendons as they unfurl, burning off the heavy fog of sleep. His eyes flutter open to take in the draped fabrics of the overhead canopy. He has to admit, this sort of luxury is something he can get used to. There's no alarm, nothing pressing, nothing that requires his immediate attention. No Ministry to rush off to, no Ron or Hermione calling from the Floo, demanding to know why he's still in bed at—he casts a quick Tempus—ten a.m. on a Thursday.
Narcissa pulls him in tight for a hug, wrapping her arms around him in comfort. He sags in the embrace, knowing she's always been strong enough to hold him up at his worst. It is one of her most defining qualities.
. I don't see this as a game. And if I were ever fortunate enough to have you in my bed, beautifully tied, wanton and begging for my touch, I wouldn't mock you for it." Harry lets his voice pitch lower to drip over Draco like honey. "I would
“Probably. We’ve never done anything by halves, have we?”
“And what is that?”
“Listen to me, because I’m only going to say this once. Draco is mine. And there’s not a fucking thing the Council or the Ministry can do to change that. And if you go against me, I can guarantee you won’t like the repercussions.”
There's a definite pause in the air, but the spell is broken as he tugs on his gloves and grins. "I should get to work. See what's really at the root of the problem."
Draco nods again, mouth working, but no sound emerges.
It doesn't surprise him that Pansy knows about Draco's predilections, or that she feels comfortable enough to remark as such. He doesn't ever remember her having a particularly stringent verbal filter. He opens his mouth to respond when Draco appears.
Three weeks later, his stomach was still in the same queasy condition, with his days filled with the sharp tongue of Snape's instruction, and his nights strangely bereft of Potter's company. He came to feed, but no more was said about the passionate encounter they had shared. It was like it never even happened. Potter never came closer than he had to, never lingered, and never spoke except to murmur soft thanks. With the workload of studying Snape had piled on him, he hadn't really stopped to think about the persistent emotion in his gut. As he poured the liquid into the potions vial, it hit him. He
“Yes,” Potter sniffed in remembrance. “It was an extremely gratifying evening.” He shot the portrait a hard glance. “In more ways than one.”
Eighteen months later, Draco is bopping around Grimmauld’s kitchen in one of Harry’s (he’s only Potter now when Draco’s cross) t-shirts and a pair of well-worn jeans. He’s barefoot, got a kitchen towel slung over one shoulder, and is currently elbows deep in making Harry’s favorite dinner. Harry loves a good spag bol. It’s an ordinary evening, like so many they’ve shared since Draco moved in. No plans for this Friday night except for a nice dinner, a nice bottle of wine, and maybe some classic Who on the telly. In other words, perfect.
Unfinished business lies on the other side of the ornately carved mahogany. Business she's resigned herself to ignore. But stubborn Black blood flows through her veins, proud and defiant, and if she's learned anything from her wayward cousin, it's that unfinished business eats at the soul. Narcissa spares a glance over her shoulder for Neville, sleeping so peacefully between her sheets, and she knows that if they are to have any sort of future together, then some doors must open before they can close.
Harry's glance peeks over the book in his hands. Draco's braced his hands on the table and is staring up at the painting on the wall. It's an image of the Manor in winter, coldly regal in all its glory, with the swirl of magical snow dancing about the landscape. Draco's mouth opens and then shuts on a snap. He does it twice more before the words finally come, as icy and frigid as the painting's subject.
“Potter?” The name rolled off his tongue with ease, even though it hadn’t come out of his mouth for nigh on two years.
shameful. Shamefully pulling on his prick and loving it. Every filthy second. He doesn't understand how Harry can see him as anything more than he is, anything more than a weak-willed freak who follows Dark Lords and needs Harry's command to come.
He was starting to get to the point of feeling like this was to be his life. Barely civil interaction with a man he was all but married to, time alone with nothing but his thoughts and the company of a fawning house-elf, and sporadic moments of happiness to break up the mind-numbing monotony. He was a second away from leaving his breakfast on the table to brave that damnable door and force Potter into a half-hearted apology just to have something interesting to do, when Potter appeared in front of him.
Harry smirks as the interior lights up, illuminating the trove of objects inside. Yes, the Manor has given him everything and more. Against the back, displayed high at the top, hangs a varied array of floggers, crops, and whips. Below them are two velvet-lined shelves with an assortment of toys, plugs, restraints, and blindfolds. The last shelf is more of a shallow tray, containing a selection of paddles. Leather-wrapped, sueded, some studded, each more decadent and wicked than the last. The gamut of darkness of Harry's desires. The Manor knows him far too well.
"And couldn't give two shits about either, I might add."
Draco chuckled. “And, he’s not very good at it. Yet.” He sat back on the sofa and crossed his legs. “It’s too early to predict the eventualities. I mean, I know we have to find some way to make it work, but the why is certainly easier than the how.”
Draco nodded, a bit dazed by it all, and went to the kitchen. Potter followed on his heels and sat down across from him, his stare never wavering. It was obvious Potter wasn’t going to relent until he ate something, as if Draco’s nourishment was suddenly Potter’s most important task in the world. Tea and toast was all he could manage under Potter’s scrutiny, and he slugged back the last of his tea—bless Kreacher for a decent cup of Earl Grey—and pushed his plate forward.
“That cat’s out of the bag,” Potter murmured.
"You look good in my sheets."
The jibe is delivered in Draco's signature drawl with such affront that Harry doubles over in laughter. Two hours and four games of chess later, he's still soaking in every moment in Draco's presence.
He is absolutely breathtaking.
Harry wants to punch him in the face on general principle.
"And what is that?" Potter shot back.
He's still panting, still blinded, with the blissed out tingle of stars behind his eyes and the half-formed plea of the word "Harry" on his tongue. He hasn't come that hard in ages. It's with a slow and growing horror that he realizes Potter didn't even have to lay a fucking finger on him to do it.
Harry strips down to his black boxer briefs, taking his time to carefully put his clothes away. These few minutes are for Draco—the waiting, the anticipation.
This time, he laughed. “Oh, the irony.” Harry eased from the cot, and she noted the stiffness to his gait as he shuffled to sit down across from her. “Tell me, then, what does the Ministry have to offer the condemned?”
Draco yanked his arm from Potter's steely grip, snapping, "I wasn't worried about him." He let the
"You—you've talked to her?" Ron's glaring turns suspicious.
“Do it and I’ll come for you with Hell on my heels. There won’t be enough ash left for your darklings to scrape together. Now get the fuck out of my house before I forget my manners.”
Draco takes her arm. "Let me walk to you to the Floo, then."
What gets to him the most is the slow and poignant nature of Narcissa's simple hug. It's not rushed, but savored, and carries more meaning that any hug ever given by Molly Weasley. Not that Harry doubts Molly's love, but her hugs are frantic and fierce, altogether short because she's moved on to another body to accost. There's a time limit, a rationing if you will, because Molly has so many to mother, so many to love. Narcissa just has Malfoy, but she makes Harry feel like she has him too.
"I can't go back to the way things were," Draco said, closing his eyes. "I—I can't be a survival technique for you." He opened his eyes to see Potter's face, understanding yet withdrawn. "I want more. I'm worth more."
"Correct." Snape's long-fingered hand waved at the pile of cauldrons tucked into one corner. "I suggest you get started."
"Hermione and I, despite our differences, have always worked well as a couple. I mean, at heart, we are two totally fundamental people, right? But, we balance each other out. Even though there's so much we have in common, there are things about us that keep us separate. Individual. That's not a bad thing," he rushes to say, "It keeps us on our toes, you know? And for all that we are one unit, there's always been this tiny space that, I dunno, divides us somehow." He rubs a resigned hand over his face. "But Pansy—I mean, she just came over and stepped right into it and filled it. Like it was nothing. We came together, the three of us, and there was no awkwardness, no 'where should I put my hands' or 'am I getting this right'. She came in and we just…clicked. We clicked. A lot. There was a lot of clicking. I think we traumatized Crookshanks and ruined the good rug. My mother gave us that rug. I shudder to think what would happen if she knew what we did on it." Harry laughs with him as he continues, "She just takes up those parts that Hermione and I can't come together on. I mean, there we are, all three of us, naked on that fucking couch, her sprawled out between us. She's got her head in 'Mione's lap, and they're kissing and stroking each other's hair, talking about Shakespeare, and kitten heels, and quarterly fiscal earnings. Just all cozied up together, gorgeous and happy. And the next second, Pansy's poking me with a toe, giving me shit about the Cannons, and demanding a foot rub."
is the reason tempers that calm with an unsettling clarity.
The Weasel was even worse. Affable and easygoing, he was nothing like the Ronald Weasley he remembered from school. Then again, neither of them were the same people they had been before. This time, Ron made no bones about clattering around Grimmauld, shouting to tear the roof off. Potter had shouted for Weasley to 'fuck off since vampires were trying to sleep', but even he could hear the protest held no heat. Maybe whatever transpired between them had been resolved, or Potter was too worn out from his secretive exploits to effectively posture a threat. Again with the clothes-throwing, but with more man-handling (he hadn't been thrust into a shower that hard since his Quidditch days). Draco should have suspected something along those lines, because he found himself side by side with Ron in the stands cheering for the cringe-worthy Chudley Cannons.
Draco laughs, really laughs, and Harry marvels at the true ring of sound. He's glimpsed it before, and it trills sweetly in his ears. Draco needs to laugh more often.
Gone over the too-large charcoal grey t-shirt that matches the depth of color in Draco's eyes. Gone over the way said shirt gapes enticingly over the hollow of his collarbones. Gone over the way those jeans sling low on his hips and drag the floor at his heels. Gone over the sparkle in his eyes and the patch of color on his cheeks, and the way that even clean and damp around the edges, Draco looks bright and fresh, and Merlin's balls…shagged. Gone like he's been pulled into another dimension, another universe where Draco is the center, shining radiant and beautiful like the sun and Harry has no choice but to orbit his presence. To do nothing but draw life from his light.
"There, it's finished. It's perfect. "
She beamed and nodded, continuing her meal.
"Nothing," Harry shrugs. "But I wanted something a bit more intimate for further use."
"Someone to help me cope with all of this. A mind healer. Of sorts, anyway. A psychiatrist."
That one sentence contained more words than they'd spoken to each other in the past three weeks, and Draco didn't know if it was the soft-spoken quality to his words, or the 'please', or the silent hope that was banked far back in the depths of Potter's eyes, but he dropped his spoon into his oatmeal and he stood up.
A dark eyebrow rose. “And if I decide to ‘snack around’?”
Snape snorted in disgust from the portrait. "Comfort has no place in the classroom. Is that—are you wearing Potter's shirt?"
“Harry, that—that’s wonderful,” she said, a little breathless. “Of course if you need anything, I’ll be glad to help.”
Harry grins over his glass. "Get some."
“No!” she barked. “No. He’s changed, yes, but he’s still Harry. Somewhere. He’s lost himself, and he can’t find a way to reconcile the man he was with the creature he’s become. But if you-”
“Well, seeing as how he didn’t kill you, I think you’d be willing to give this a go,” she shot back. “You get to leave here, go back to Grimmauld, or wherever you choose, and neither the Ministry nor the Council can say two whits about it. All other charges against you will be dropped, there will be no parole, no Aurors checking up on you. You will be free to live with your Consort as you choose, provided you stay within the confines of magical and vampire law like every other citizen.”
This time Draco's eyes are for Harry alone. "I feel almost new."
I forgive you.
"About what? Was this a one-off, or is it happening again?"
Harry frowns, grabs Ron by the arm, and shoves him into the adjacent sitting room, pushing him toward the sofa. "Get in here, you idiot." Ron falls into the cushions and levels Harry with a stare. "Don't look at me like that. You came barging into someone's home and started waving your wand about. You're in the wrong here."
As soon their feet touch the ground in Harry's chamber, Draco is on him like a Niffler on gold, tugging and pulling, pushing Harry back toward the sofa. He's having a hell of a time attempting to undress himself. He's trying to kick off his shoes, shed his clothes, and kiss Harry all at once. Harry's chuckling against his lips while avoiding getting knocked in the face by the flurry of Draco's limbs. He's all knees and flying elbows, stumbling and hopping, backing Harry across the room. Breathless and desperate, Draco is flailing about, not making any real progress.
Draco listens with impressively faked interest as Narcissa goes on about Neville's impending arrival. Harry knows Nev's extremely low on Draco's list of people to ever see again, but the smile at her words isn't false. Draco may not want Neville in his home, but he's pleased to see his mother so animated.
Snape snorted. "Of course you did. You are my pupil."
The change in Draco is instantaneous, and it burns through Harry with satisfaction.
It's enough.
"It's alright, Draco." Narcissa puts a hand on her son's arm. "Blinky wouldn't have directed him there if—"
"Good." Harry lets the praise rumble out of his mouth like a purr. "Thank you." He breathes deeply and rocks back on his heels. "That wasn't so difficult, was it, Malfoy?"
She shuffled over to the small table he was allowed in the cell and sat down, plunking the satchel on the floor. Her brown hair tumbled over a face that had grown into the picture of womanly beauty as she bent over and retrieved a rolled parchment and quill. She placed them on the table and made a silent motion with her hand for him to come and sit. When he didn’t move, she let out a soft sigh and gestured again.
Draco howled at Potter bit down with a sharp, stinging bite, sucking at Draco's pectoral with a greedy groan. He bucked beneath the weight of Potter's muscled body, arching to meet each touch as Potter bit and sucked his way down Draco's chest, leaving bite marks in his wake. Potter's lust was palpable, a sentient, living thing between them, and the rush it sent coursing through him was overwhelming. There was pain, but behind it came the dizzying euphoria of pleasure, a dark tide of fiery sensation that Draco wanted to last forever.
Molly patted his hand and went inside, leaving him alone at the table. He turned the envelope over in his hands, running a finger across the raised wax seal he could draw from memory. In the distance, the tiny spots of light hung in the air like low-lying stars. With a dread that bubbled up from his toes, he walked toward them.
"Very well, Narcissa. I'll remember that. Thank you." Neville turns and offers Draco his hand without reservation. That's the one thing Harry loves about Neville. What's in the past is in the past. He's here on a clean slate, to see Harry and the greenhouse, nothing more. Neville's animosity is like his own: reconciled and forgotten. "Malfoy. It's been a while, hasn't it? I trust you are well?"
Draco shakes his head and turns a bewildered and slightly nauseous face to Harry. "I don't think you saw what I just saw," he says, not without a touch of childish disdain.
Narcissa chuckles and rises from her chair. Harry and Malfoy follow. "If you can get Mr. Longbottom here to look at my roses, I would certainly welcome his insight."
"You'd have done the same," Potter shot back.
“I take it Potter wasn’t approved?” Draco said silkily.
Harry leans in, inches from Draco's lips. "Soon, I'm going to taste you. I'll rub your dripping cock all over my lips and fuck you with my mouth."
The defeat in Malfoy's gaze urges Harry to touch now, and he grabs at Malfoy's arm. "Don't give up on me yet. Stranger things have happened. I ended up here, didn't I?"
Something in Potter's tone had him unwinding the fabric and letting it hang from his hand. Potter's gaze lingered on his neck. Draco frowned as he realized how much of his neck was still exposed, even under the collar of his shirt. "Do you want me to freeze, Potter?"
OOOOO
Narcissa drops into a sweeping curtsy, as elegant as ever. "Mr. Longbottom, you honor us with your presence."
The surrender was not lost on Potter, who snarled against his skin and renewed the force of his bite. Potter still drank, in a tantalizing pull of lips, teeth, and tongue that had him dizzy and light-headed.
“The answer is still no, with a heftier helping of ‘no fucking way’.”
“Merlin, help me, yes.” Ron’s brow scrunched. “I didn’t even know Mum knew that word. The fact that she does is strangely disturbing to me.” He sighed and waved a hand at Harry. “Anyway, don’t worry about her. She’ll come back in a few days with her tail between her legs and apologize when she needs Mum to do her laundry or something. And I don’t see why she’s making such a fuss. She dating Oliver Wood now, isn’t she? Shouldn’t make a difference to her who you decide to take up with.”
Potter eyed the movement with disapproval. “You should eat more.”
"How the fuck is it okay, you guess? You cheated on Hermione, you git!"
“You’re Narcissa’s boy, aren’t you?” she asked.
. Not Malfoy. Not the Death Eater. Not Lucius' son.
"Narcissa?"
Draco cups his cheek and leans in to rest his forehead on Harry's. "That's so Slytherin." He rubs his mouth across Harry's lips. "And still so fucking hot." Draco's breath is warm and moist on Harry's skin, and his body is wound so tight Harry can feel each twitch of muscle of under his hands.
Narcissa rubs a hand over Draco's arm. "Of course not."
Draco pushed him away lightly and waved a dismissive hand. “Don’t worry about it. It’s in the past. I’d forgiven you a long time ago.” He breathed out a heavy, put-upon sigh. “Consider it yet another tangible reminder of my predilection for extremely poor decision-making.”
"You wanted it all. Take it," Potter growled, slamming into him over and over. "Take it all. Take my cock."
"How flattering."
Three more alternating slaps to Draco's arse and Harry's pushing his face back to lap at the now twitching pucker. The taste of him has Harry salivating, and he abandons any pretense of finesse, slurping and sucking at Draco's hole as he attempts to push the tip of his tongue inside.
Draco shrugged. “Honestly? I don’t know. It’s been surreal, to say the least.”
He’s off-kilter, caught on the back foot, fumbling like it’s his first heavy grope in a dark Hogwarts corridor. And here’s Potter, directing it all with natural ability. Potter’s effortless command has him rattled and aroused at the same time. He returns Potter’s kisses, presses back into Potter’s body, but for some reason, he has no idea what to do with his hands. He pats up and down the sides of Potter’s body, unsure which part he wants to touch first. Potter smiles into his mouth, grabs his wrists, and wraps Draco’s arms around his neck.
Potter cocked his head to the side, and penetrating green eyes stared at him with a focus that Draco was rapidly considering to be unnerving. "I don't know, is it?"
"Not that it's any of your business, but no, no I'm not."
"Alright, alright," Potter said, raising his hand. He shook his head with one last smile before his features grew serious. "After you left, I was a wreck. A total mess. I'm sure Hermione filled you in. Merlin knows she ripped me a new one." Another soft laugh. "And thank you for the owls, by the way. Perfectly timed, and always the perfect temperature. I appreciate you not letting me starve to death because of my own stupidity."
Somewhere in the dark of his mind he hears another voice, faint at first, and then loud as thunder.
“It doesn’t mean anything. This changes nothing.”
Harry swivels in his chair to keep his eyes on Draco's face. "Unhealthy?"
She taps the side of her nose with a manicured finger. "Got it in one."
00000
He holds up a hand. "Please let me finish. If I don't say this now, I don't think I'll have the courage again."
"So am I."
"Excellent. Lessons will begin tomorrow at noon sharp." Snape rose from the chair and craned his head to peer at the curtained-covered windows, paying no attention to his ruffled apprentice. "See that you're properly attired this time."
Draco flung his arms around Hermione without thought, hugging her to his chest. "Merlin, that's wonderful!"
"Charmed." Malfoy speaks again in the same irritated tone. "The windows. You change the lighting to suit your needs." He points to a side door in the far corner. "Closet's through there. Easels, supplies, whatnot. You'll have to go through it, as I have no idea what's in there. So don't ask."
"Bollocks." Potter's eyebrow rose at the expletive. "An absolute crock of utter shite if ever I heard one."
Because Harry says.
Her lips curl and her lashes lower demurely. "Possibly. Or maybe it's that I know my son as well as you know Harry. They've danced around in one way or another since the moment they met. Perhaps it's time they finally came together."
Potter leaned forward, and fixed Draco with a stare he felt down to his soul. "I haven't changed," he said. "I'm still me. Fucked up, faults, and all. I still feel the way I did before. The difference is that I'm learning how to deal with those feelings and make different choices because of them. I didn't come earlier because I knew you really didn't want to see me, and also because I wasn't ready."
Potter couldn't have jerked back any harder if Draco had punched him in the face, and he took every scrap of pleasure he could at seeing Potter falter.
Ron sits up as Harry plonks down beside him, not shrinking from Harry's disapproving frown. "It's not like that," he starts. "I mean, it's okay, I guess, but—"
Draco’s fork fell from his hand and clattered to the plate, causing Potter to swear and jump to his feet. The blood rushed from his face and he felt his heart drop into his stomach. He glanced down and picked up the fork. “Sorry. It-it slipped.”
“I don’t know about that, Ron.” Harry’s hand curled reflexively to ease the sudden tension that crept into his fingers.
? To give him that kind of dominion over me? To hand a man like that this kind of power?"
"In all fairness, Ron did a great deal of the strategizing, as it were. I was really just the hired muscle."
When Draco's eyes open, he doesn't see the fuzzy, unfocused gaze he expects. Draco's eyes are bright, clear, and backlit by a fire that makes Harry's cock throb in his jeans. He also doesn't expect Draco to rise up and tumble him to the floor, but that's what he does, and before Harry can make sense of it, his jeans are around his knees and his cock is halfway down Draco's throat.
Recognition dawned and he suddenly felt like an idiot. “Oh.”
“Why can I feel this?” Potter rasped, pain and confusion written across his brow. “I don’t want to feel this. I don’t want to feel you.”
This time it was Potter that swallowed hard as his eyes trailed over the map of veins that lay underneath Draco’s ghostly-white skin, as if he could track the course of his blood simply by watching. Potter’s eyelashes fluttered, and then he turned abruptly and returned to the cot, staring out at Draco with a blank mask.
"What?" Harry shakes his head and turns his eyes on Draco.
"Harry," Ron says, and the deep undercurrent of warning rubs Harry the wrong way. "You're making a mistake."
Harry can feel the muscles in his face tense, and the unconscious clench of his teeth tell him he's close to saying something he'll regret. He takes a deep breath and slides out of the booth to stare them both down.
Narcissa pulls back and smoothes the line of his shirt with a steady hand. She turns and heads toward the door, stopping next to Malfoy before she leaves.
Snape stared at him, open-mouthed, as Draco stood, clutching the letter in his hands.
He sniffed at the insult. “Of course. She asked for privacy, and I gave it to her. I didn’t go out of my way to listen. That would be rude, Potter.”
"And you should know by now that I can take care of myself. My letter was specific on the point that
"Isn't it?" Harry says flippantly. He smiles into Zabini's face, like they're mates, like Harry's giving him the latest Quidditch scores over chips at the pub. The friendliness makes his tone all the more terrifying. "I defeated a Dark Lord. I came back from the dead. I am probably the greatest wizard of any recorded age. Do you really want to call my bluff?"
George let go and they stumbled back, Potter’s hand reaching out to steady his elbow. Her eyes were bright and full of nothing but Potter as she came forward, stopping in front of him with her hands clasped tightly in front of her. The smile that graced her face was apprehensive, yet warm and full of love.
"Yes."
“And who is the other willing party in this farce? Or have you got them lined up out the door?” he snarled.
"—you can't live with me, I know," Potter finished. "But I'm hoping you might change your mind. Are you open to a discussion, at least?"
Draco turned to find Granger staring at Potter with trepidation. He stood straight, mouth pinched in a tight line. They stood that way for a moment before she sighed, “Oh, Harry!” and flung her arms around his neck. Potter didn’t move, but then his eyes closed and his arms slid around her in return. Weasley let out a small gasp of surprise. Granger’s body shook in Potter’s arms and the unmistakable sound of muffled tears filtered from their embrace.
A blond eyebrow rose. "Are you sure about that? Really sure?"
seat," Draco hisses at her.
"What?" Harry leaps from his stool and stalks over to rip Ron's arm off his face. "What the hell were you thinking?"
"How can you say that?" Draco hisses, jumping to his feet and turning to glower down at her. "How can you advocate for this?" He hears his voice strangling higher, but he doesn't care. Narcissa's face goes from calm to shocked to glaring in the space of a second. "How can you tell me to give everything I am to
"Completely?"
The low timbre of Potter’s voice skated over him and suddenly he was assaulted with visions of all the things Potter could do to him in that bedroom. Oddly enough, getting dressed didn’t even make the list. He tried for light, hoping to diffuse his brain’s musings.
And damned if that isn't the million-Galleon question. What's worse is that he knows the answer. He turns his head to the side to look at her.
He stepped under the spray and groaned. This was nothing like the cursory hose down he’d been given before he went to Potter’s cell. This was pure, unadulterated bliss. And now it was his. Well, his and Potter’s. He stood there for several minutes, allowing the water to cascade over him with the perfect amount of pressure of relieve some of the tension he’d been carrying. Feeling better, he got on with the business of washing the last traces of Azkaban from his body, satisfied that the remaining dregs of the awful place were headed down the drain where they belonged.
"Yes, Harry."
"Yes."
"Blaise wanted more than I could provide, and he wanted something completely different. He is a sadist, through and through. While I—
"And Cook? Er…Tinky?"
"You keep saying 'kettle', but all I'm seeing is 'pot'."
"Very well," Draco says. The tone is low, but steady.
Draco was incapable of speech, his body too wrecked and sated to form a reply. He eased back into Potter's hold and closed his eyes, chasing the lingering thrum of Potter's touch in his blood.
Silvestri smiled and raised his head, but not before the point of his tongue darted out to drag across the marks on Draco's skin. Draco whined and shivered again, his hands flexing at his sides. As always, Harry's eye drew toward Draco's long fingers, and he could see the point of Draco's wand barely peeking out from underneath the cuff of his sleeve.
Harry opens his arms. "Would you mind?"
“No.” Potter’s voice was firm, and Hermione’s head craned around Draco to frown at Potter.
A point in Draco's favor.
Her hand tugged at the sleeve of his Auror jacket. “Sit down, Ron! It’s upsetting, but we have to think clearly.”
"Draco?"
Potter was silent, his face guarded.
Valeria chuckled and stepped further into the room on high-heeled black boots and a swishing black and silver robe, keeping her focus on Harry at all times. "You know where he is. Why I am here." She inclined her head and tutted, "Silvestri's none too pleased with you. He's offered us all a taste of your pretty blond boy." Her pink tongue darted out to swipe over her lips. Harry saw the points of her fangs gleaming. "I'm surprised he's willing to share. It doesn't happen often. I might have to take him up on the offer. The others are practically gagging for it."
Draco held his left hand, palm up, for Potter. "The crypt has more complex warding. It requires fresh blood." He wiggled his fingers. "If you could, please?"
Draco's seeing red and he spits, "Yes, and as soon as I realized it would never make me happy, I left. I didn't care for him. Blaise is nothing compared to Harry! Harry—Harry could
"Alright, alright!" she said furiously, putting a hand on her lips. She drew a deep breath to steady herself. "I promised Draco I wouldn't say anything, but a couple of days ago, he went to Knockturn to set up an account for potions supplies and such. While he was there, there was," she paused, "an altercation."
"Draco—"
“As manly as this is, Ronald, I think Potter would prefer it if you let go of me,” Draco said loud enough for Potter to hear, keeping his gaze all the while.
Narcissa has a moment where she doesn't quite know what to do with her hands, so she settles for resting them on her hips. Neville's gaze is like a ray of warm sunshine, and it bathes her from head to toe.
But only when Harry allows it.
He waits for Draco to turn and return his smile before loftily shifting his attention to Draco's conversant. Harry doesn't bother to incline his head in greeting.
Potter's face gave nothing away as he moved closer, coming to stand uncomfortably close. His green eyes flicked down to Draco's neck and he replied in a low, sultry tone, "Maybe I just like looking at it."
Malfoy tuts from his chair. "'Interesting' is a mild way of putting it, Mother."
“It’s a dream, Potter. The reality is that I’ll be here, doing nothing with my time except reading your old magazines, and doing my best to make sure what’s left of my wealth can sustain me until either you or I finally expire.” Draco laid his head back and closed his eyes. “And what about you? How do you plan to spend the rest of this existence we have together? Since terrorizing people at large is no longer an option, what will you do with your time?”
"So what did you do?"
“If I offer him a sustainable and constant food source, you’re hoping he’ll come around?”
Now he's thinking about it. Imagining it. Fantasizing about what exactly Potter might do, because if he's shown Draco anything at all since he's been here, it's that Potter is nothing like he imagined. It's overwhelming now, this physical reaction, and Draco sinks to his knees, slips his hand in his trousers, and pulls one off right there on the goddamned rug.
"Same thing I'm going to do, I suppose."
What started off so terribly tender erupted into something more fierce as Potter bucked, becoming more aggressive with his mouth and hands, taking control. Draco's eyes flew open at the sharp denial in his blood.
Somehow, he supposed it was fitting. He and Ginny had been over a long time ago, but she still acted as though she continued to have a claim on him. “What happened?”
"You're fine where you are," Harry replies, moving toward him.
"If you like." That's as close to an endorsement as he's going to get for the moment, but it blossoms in his heart all the same.
He sits as instructed. The soles of his feet are planted on the floor, knees open wide, displaying himself confidently without shame. He's trembling slightly, but it's all anticipation. Harry thinks maybe this is a good time to reinforce some trust. Or maybe he just wants another good look at Draco's arse.
Draco stumbles forward once the door shuts behind Potter, bracing himself with one hand on the table. The gasp that escapes him is entirely involuntary. He's panting like he's run from here to Hogwarts and back, double time, with a hippogriff strapped to his back the entire way. He blinks twice, unable to see or think of anything beyond two crystal clear factors. One, Draco can still feel Potter's body heat, hovering over his skin like that first tingle of magic you get when you hold a wand for the first time. Nervous, exciting, and an altogether visceral rush that strangles out all other feeling. And two, Potter said 'when', not 'if'.
The smile that crosses his face is sly, almost predatory. "What else do you like, Draco?"
Potter’s eyes glittered in the darkness, his lips ruby red and slick. His chest rose and fell in a stuttered rhythm. “I think I can.”
Potter let out a soft snort, but didn’t look up. “I can eat. Small portions, though. I find that most foods don’t smell good enough to interest me, and generally, if it doesn’t smell like something I want, it tastes like nothing. So, I’ve rather gotten out of the habit.”
?" Draco folds his arms over his chest and shakes his head. "Not a chance."
"Very good. Now, what is the first rule of potions, Mr. Malfoy?" Snape drawled, ever the professor.
Draco held up a hand, having anticipated this reaction from the moment he accepted the invitation. “It’s all right.”
Nev's right of course, so Harry wishes him well and ends the call, knowing he'll see him soon. He's finishing tying the laces on his trainers when Blinky pops in.
He guides Draco into the shower and directs him to brace his hands on the tile. Harry steps in behind him, clothes and all, and grabs a couple of flannels and proceeds to wash Draco with careful, gentle movements. The cloth prevents skin to skin contact as Harry soaps him up all over. Harry lets his cloth-covered hand roam freely over Draco's body and he feels a level of contentment he's never felt before. Taking care of Draco is nothing like taking care of any of the other subs he's been with. He's never felt such a personal duty of care to someone before.
"Master Harry's Weasley is being to see you."
The high color in Narcissa's cheeks softens her features. "I look forward to it."
Three months after the Final Battle (or whatever the fuck they’re calling it, Draco really doesn’t know or care), Potter rocks up to the Manor’s front stoop looking sheepish and subdued and far more relaxed than Draco’s ever seen. This ‘at ease’ look only serves to irritate Draco even more, but he reminds himself that if anyone deserves to breathe easy now, it’s definitely Harry fucking Potter. So, he bites back the snark and spite that lives forever at the point of his tongue where Potter’s concerned and greets him with a warm sincerity his mother would be proud of.
"Don't get cheeky, boy."
Ron nods. "You're right. The little shit will make it worse than it is." He grimaces. "Bastard."
Well, I daresay if you're here, you've probably waited for this. I hope you find it adequate.
Draco stiffened. "Oh, yes, His Saviorness and his Boundless Magical Talents. How easily one forgets such things."
"I trust you—Harry."
“Then you should be used to it.”
"It was time, Draco." Potter replied. "I want to sort this out. I miss you."
“Bullshit. You don’t get to do this,” she warned. “You don’t get to push us away, and then when we leave you in peace, get pissy because we don’t come begging for your attention. You didn’t want to be part of this family anymore, so we let you go. And it nearly broke us all. But Draco needs family now, and Molly has things that he needs to hear. The fact that you’re along for the ride is par for the course.”
Hermione gasped. "Knockturn? Oh, no."
"And you're still just as stubborn, just like—"
The anger swirling in his body seeped out into his limbs and over his skin, lighting up every nerve in a deadly burn. Sweat beaded at his temples as he grew hotter and hotter, a feat only before accomplished by the sweet fire of Draco's touch.
"What?"
"And how do you feel now?"
"I'll expect to see you at dinner this evening," Harry says with finality. "Your mother may be used to dealing with your petulance, but I'll not tolerate it. She enjoys sharing meals with you. It disappoints me that you would deprive her of that for your own childish whims. Understood?"
Potter rolled his eyes and snorted. Draco shooed him with his hand. “There. You’ve been duly chastised. Off with you.”
Hermione quieted and, against better judgment, leaned forward to reach across and lay a hand on his arm. When he didn’t flinch from her touch, she pressed on. “You’re right, I can’t. But that doesn’t mean I don’t want to understand. Or that I don’t want to help you.”
"It's all right," Harry says smoothly, hoping to deflect some of Malfoy's discomfort. "I'll give him fair warning before I take anything." He shrugs with amused self-deprecation. "Can't help it," he grins. "Gryffindor."
“Yeah, we’ll see. Good night.” She left and shut the door behind her. He turned back to Ron, who was grinning like there was no tomorrow.
Harry shrugs. "I just don't understand why you've not taken things over from your father. It's your birthright, isn't it? This is your proper place in the grand scheme, right?"
"Your owl—she's gorgeous, you know—and Ajax. I think they're—" Potter made a crude gesture with his hand.
"She didn't tell you?" Draco's voice is filled to the brim with sarcastic astonishment. "Can't imagine why."
Harry's smile goes from playful to heated in a second. "I thought I already did that."
Harry pushes open the door and strides into the room, unashamed at being caught.
The second the soles of Draco’s shoes hit Grimmauld’s hardwoods, Potter is on him like a crup just let off the lead. The kiss isn’t frantic, but it is frenetic in its focused intensity. Potter is a man on a mission, intent on claiming his mouth, and Draco is helpless to stop him. Neither does he want to. Strong hands grab Draco’s hips, fingers splayed wide to control his movement. Potter surges forward with purpose, licking hotly into Draco’s mouth, all the while steering him backward. Draco goes without hesitation.
that you did something. I didn't imagine that."
Potter opened his mouth to retort, but closed it, running a hand over his face. “Sure. Whatever. When Kreacher’s done, your room is up the stairs, last door on the left. Mine is across the hall, but there’s a shared ensuite bath between us. Feel free to take a shower. There’s clean towels in the bathroom cupboard, and there’s probably something suitable for sleeping in your dresser.” He started up the stairs. “We’ll sort out everything tomorrow.” Potter stumbled and grabbed for the rail. “Goodnight, Malfoy.”
Draco's hands fidgeted against the old wallpaper, before coming up to tangle in the glorious nest of Potter's hair. At the clench of his fingers in the silky strands, Potter moaned again, a low-pitched rumble that shook them both.
There's something rattling around the cavern of his belly, and when it seeps out into his bones to take root, recognition dawns. It's the hollow echo of the house-elf's words.
The suck and slide of Potter's mouth was fierce and aggressive, and it mimicked perfectly the swirl of emotion that raged inside Draco. His head fell back against the wall, fingers still clutched in Potter's hair, hanging on and applying pressure.
Draco shook his head. "This isn't about me and what I do or do not know. This is about you. It took me a little while, but I think I've figured it out. Frankly, it's far simpler than I expected."
“Look at me!” he cried, throwing his arms wide. “This is what I have become. Nothing.” He plucked at the dingy gray shift he wore. “A filthy nothing. You must all be rolling with how the tables have turned. And now you want my help?” He rubbed a grimy hand over his face. “Look at me,” he said again, this time hating the pleading quality his voice adopted. “You want me to help the Savior, and I’m not even in a position to help myself.”
"Draco is being a good Consort."
She looked at him plainly. “True. But you and I both know that even when your sentence is up, the Ministry will do whatever it can to keep you here. Indefinitely. This,” her finger traced the edge of the parchment, “is ironclad. You do this, and they can’t touch you anymore than they already have. They can’t take anything else away from you.”
Draco. Merlin help us. We're gonna need it."
Relief shone through the tears. “Yes,” she nodded. “Exactly.”
"Has he cursed you? Hexed you?" Ron shakes his head. "Never mind, we'll get you to St. Mungo's, just come on."
"Stand up and open the cabinet."
He bucks back into Potter’s fingers with a sated smile. “You’ve ruined me, Potter.”
He works his tongue across the rim, and brings the flat of his right hand down with a loud slap.
"Well, I'll take this into my study and see if a reply is necessary." She places her napkin on the table and rises slowly. "Blinky, would take the owl, please?" Harry follows in deference as Blinky hops out of the room.
"So you're saying this is my fault?" Her voice sounds defensive and petulant, and she mentally chastises herself for letting it show.
"Oh, come on. You know we all hated Owen. Even Seamus hated him, and Seamus likes everybody." Ron sighs. "You're staying, aren't you?"
When Harry opens the door to his room the oxygen is sucked from his lungs, and he almost braces himself on the door jamb for support.
It's not exactly a run, but Draco's arse bounces just the same. It's a pleasure to watch him go.
"Yes, Draco."
Draco rushed past him on a burst of nervous energy and turned on his heel as Potter shut the door.
"I slept with Parkinson."
“You don’t get it, do you?” he said, serving Harry with a solid stare. “I know it’s been a couple of months since you’ve been around the Ministry, but you were an Auror, Harry. You know they had it in for Malfoy.”
Harry nods. "Yes, I can imagine she was quite distressed."
Potter’s gaze is intense, powerful, and utterly unsettling. But there is no ego in his voice when he says, “Probably.”
Ron stopped short in front of him, and before Draco could open his mouth to head Weasley off at the pass with a sharp reply, the ginger-haired Auror grabbed the front of his shirt and hauled him into a fierce hug. It knocked the breath from Draco’s lungs, and his arms came up to grab at Ron to steady himself.
"Darling, your mother has always been one of my favorite people, but I must say I've never been so proud." She ticks off her fingers. "Gorgeous. Intelligent. War hero. She's bagged herself a right catch." Pansy turns to Harry. "You know muggles, Potter. What's the phrase I'm looking for?"
It’s Potter.
"Where would you like me, Harry?"
"In theory."
Potter's head snapped up to meet Draco's gaze, his face tight. "Give her my regrets."
He snuffled and pulled the bed sheet close, suddenly realizing he was naked beneath it. “Then why are you in here?”
Before he could reply, she'd kissed him on the cheek and disappeared through the Floo.
Relief bled from the line of Potter's shoulders to his scuffed trainers. "Draco," he said, breathless.
Harry chuckles at the thought of a house-elf insisting on anything from Malfoy. "And how did this come about?"
"Draco? Draco?" Ron coughs. "It's fucking Malfoy, and I'll point my—" Ron's eyes go wide like saucers, like he's just discovered something monumentally important. "Merlin's left nut, you're shagging him, aren't you?"
Malfoy waves a hand in the air in a broad, sweeping gesture. "The Fall of the House of Malfoy, er, the Ministry version anyway. After the war, Father and I were sent to Azkaban, as I'm sure you remember, and Mother was on house arrest. The Ministry took custody of the Manor and freed all the house-elves. They, however, were outraged, and refused to leave my mother shut up all alone. Apparently, there was a big to-do about it, and the Ministry and the elves came to an agreement. They would be freed, but the Ministry would agree to pay their employment wages out of what little was left in our vaults. Since they didn't actually want to be paid, those sums went into a trust which only the Ministry had access to. Frankly, I'm surprised you didn't already know about it, I thought Granger was on one of those committees."
“So?” Ron asked. “Other than the obvious addition of a pointy git into your life, how’s things?”
Draco bent over and placed a hand over his stomach, groaning, causing Potter to take a step back and look him over.
It's as if everything just falls away in the wake of the calm that thrums through his body. The crowd, the light, the noise—everything—dissipates, and Harry glides forward like a shark seamlessly cutting its way through the ocean. The bodies part for him as he walks, because nothing can stand in his way.
Potter snorts with derision. "Then he's an idiot."
When Harry turns and sets his eyes on Draco's, something unfurls in Harry's chest and bottoms out in his toes. Draco's eyes are soft and silver and the slight purse of his lips in thought sends a shiver of want throughout Harry's body. Draco is breathtakingly beautiful. In any light, at any time of day, no matter the situation or context. And he belongs to Harry. The warmth that curls through him has a dark edge, one that trips the light fantastic between possession and
Draco closed his eyes and turned his face away. "Get out. I can't stomach the sight of you right now. And you don't deserve to be in the same room with her."
"It's
"Let's call it...
"This isn't a striptease, Draco," Harry says. "You already have my attention."
The gravel crunched beneath their feet as they walked along in silence. Moonlight hung from overhead, lighting the pathway toward the Manor, and their steps fell in sync as they continued on. Several yards ahead, the path forked and Draco pointed.
Harry's eyes widen. Blaise Zabini?
She leaned into his side and sighed. "They love each other. They need each other. That outweighs all the bad. "
Harry stopped short at the edge of the table, frozen by the chilled venom in Draco's voice. He placed his palm on the table for support. "I was in my room."
Draco inhales sharply and huffs out through his nose. "Then I choose yes. I choose to commit myself into your hands."
Draco's moan isn't fully coherent. He's looking at Harry though shower-soaked lashes, and Harry can see that he's deep in the hazy, blissed-out fog of subspace. It warms Harry through because Merlin knows Draco needed it. He has no idea how long it's been for Draco to get this deep, or to get into subspace at all, given what Blaise had subjected him to.
"I know you want me." The statement is gritted out through Draco's clenched teeth like it pains him to put voice to it. "Do you deny it? That you want to get me into your bed?"
"Already have. She's coming by again at the weekend."
Potter turned, keeping his body mostly in front of Draco. “Hermione.”
There’s a bit of small talk, none of it about what recently transpired, thank Merlin, general pleasantries they never managed when working together a year ago, but that low fire in Potter’s eyes is growing and Draco finds himself responding to it without question. He is used to all sorts of pretext and innuendo which precedes a sexual liaison. Depending on his mood, he either finds it stimulating or tedious. But the longer Potter sips his drink, the longer his eyes linger over Draco’s body, it becomes clear that witty banter is completely unnecessary. They’ve done the cat and mouse, albeit under startlingly different circumstances. They’ve played this game. There’s already been a winner.
Draco walked in and ran his hand across the large desk against the wall, taking a look at the bookshelves that lined the room. A plush velvet settee sat toward the middle of the room on top of a large, well-worn rug. In the corner, a curtained portrait sat on an easel, surrounded by glass-fronted curio cabinets. A fireplace banked the far wall, with a great oak mantle over the top, flanked by picture frames and an intricately carved wooden box.
Draco’s mouth fell open, but he hastily snapped it shut, hoping his recovery looked quicker than it felt. “Of course it does. I may be a little thinner than I used to be, but I’m still stunning. Honestly, Potter, I’m gorgeous. Who wouldn’t want to fuck me?”
He's spent so long feeling dirty and unclean, like he can never wash away the slick taint of evil that coats his skin in a swirl of ink. The taint that covers him in shame, because he
The walk out to the greenhouse is punctuated by crisp gusts of frosty winter wind and a sporadic flurry of snowflakes. Neville's emanating a comfortable warmth from where their arms are entwined in a proper escorting fashion. Narcissa wonders briefly if a wandless Warming charm is at work. But the heat she feels is natural and organic in nature. And that is a curious thought on its own.
“Besides, I’m afraid there won’t be much sunlight in my future.” Draco’s gaze sharpened on her. How much did she really know about Potter that she hadn’t given up? He picked at the knee of his trousers, banishing a piece of invisible lint. “Were you aware that he doesn’t go out in sunlight? When I mention potions for that, he became downright intractable.” Draco paused. “Frighteningly so.”
Ron bursts out laughing. "You suck at this. That is all." He claps Harry on the back and grasps his shoulder. "I know this is different from the kind of relationship you have with Malfoy, but I can see where you're coming from. And Malfoy's not so bad, I know. If he was, you wouldn't still be here. I talked to him the other night at dinner. We've made our peace. I'm happy for you. And him, the pointy git."
“Good, good.”
The remainder of the day is spent sketching and researching, until his fingers are nearly black with charcoal. He misses the formal lunch, but Blinky (sweet Blinky) brings him a sandwich and watches him with narrowed eyes to make sure he eats.
Draco’s mouth went dry. Fuck, Potter was powerful.
“Master Draco is staying?” Kreacher asked. He paused for a moment, as if feeling something in the air. His eyes widened and he began nodding frantically. “Yes, yes, right away, Master Harry. Kreacher will make things perfect for Master Harry’s Consort.” He disappeared with another pop.
Neville shakes his head, and the back of his hand comes up to brush against her cheek. Her breath catches as he says, "No, you're no relic. Those are nothing but dead history, frozen in time, recorded in memory. You're still vibrant and alive, and your history is still being written."
Something snaps inside Harry at the noise. It's high-pitched and full of want and frustration, and it tugs at the corners of Harry's soul. The sound threatens Harry's self-control, and he wants to shuck his trousers, bury himself balls deep in Draco's arse and fuck that noise out of him until his voice is raw and ragged. In a frenzy, he attacks the globes of Draco's arse—kissing, licking, biting, sucking—over and over until Draco begins to shake uncontrollably. He bites down hard where the curve of buttock meets the inside of his thigh, where the skin is paper thin and dotted with nerve endings.
“My point is that you should take him to see his mother,” Hermione replied. “The tombs are considered part of the grounds and not the house, so you shouldn’t have any problem taking him there.”
"Well," he drawls, and it sends a familiar twinge of icy fingers down her spine, "I wondered how long it would take before you came to me."
And it's with a clear and pointed honesty that Harry looks Narcissa right in the eye and replies, "Because of the man he's become."
Draco opens his mouth, and Harry waits to hear the kiss-off, because Draco's made it plain that he's unwilling to recognize or admit to his own needs.
Harry sucks in a breath and his groin tightens. Draco's absolutely coquettish, and instead of it being simpering and annoying, it's incredibly arousing. Partly because Draco is gorgeous, and partly because Harry thinks he actually means it. He's not above a bit of flirting, not when he knows he's going to have Draco naked and panting in a few hours. Harry leans in and whispers huskily in his ear, "Draco Malfoy, are you trying to seduce your Master?"
impossible."
"So, go on, spit it out."
Draco assures them they are doing well despite their circumstances, but thanks him for thinking about her. Potter nods in acceptance, a small flush staining his cheeks as he shoves his hands in his front pockets and rocks back on the heels of the rattiest trainers Draco’s ever laid eyes on. He asks if Draco will be coming back for the newly implemented eighth-year program, because most everybody is, he says. It’s a testament to moving on, he says, and it wouldn’t be the same without him.
"If this is where you say 'your father', I will
It's pointless now to be surprised by anything else that happens, Harry realizes. He can't control the house, or its magic, but the one thing he can control is his reaction to it. Nothing sinister has happened so far, and Blinky is beside herself with happiness. Narcissa seems resigned, and Draco—well, Draco's going to be the only foreseeable obstacle. Barring that, there's nothing he can do except follow the lead. He smiles at Blinky.
"What does Harry want?"
Her well-schooled expression makes him shiver beneath his skin, and he's reminded that sitting across from him is a woman who is most likely the greatest Occlumens of any recorded age. A woman by virtue of her own cunning skill managed to elude taking the Mark, kept her true feelings hidden from both her husband and the Dark Lord, harbored said Dark Lord under her roof, and lied to his face without breaking a sweat. Killing Harry in his sleep has got to be a parlor trick.
"They'll be back this way. The oldest of the Malfoys are at the front."
“Silvestri is right,” Kingsley Shacklebolt replied from his seat across the table. “The Ministry and the Vampire Council have come to an agreement. Either Harry does this, or we turn him back over to the Council for punishment. As he is one of theirs, their rights trump ours.” The Minister let out a heavy sigh. “And even if they didn’t, I can’t see Harry’s fate turning out better with the Ministry.”
and keeps on giving, because he knows Draco will give him
"Which is?" Draco is incensed.
The meddlesome house irritates him to no end. First, it's the silk-draped fantasy of Draco Malfoy in his bed, and now it's the high-handed show of power that's got him glued to this seat. But Harry knows that on some level he
arse instead."
But from the look of things, Potter didn't need any help at all. The vampires had moved together, eschewing the distance of a magical fight for the satisfaction of a good, old-fashioned brawl. They were grunting and snarling, flinging each other into trees, scrabbling and rolling on the ground, fists flying and teeth snapping all around. If Silvestri was strength and power personified, then Potter was speed and grace made physical. He danced around, throwing elbows and punches like it was a ballet, weaving and darting, using his feet and legs to throw off the other vampire's movement.
"What—what is this?"
Harry raises an eyebrow and nods in response. "Once she knows you barreled in here like a bat out of hell, flinging your wand in someone's home, someone she apparently knows rather well, I'd say yeah, you're in the shit."
Potter cocked his head to the side, like the thought had just occurred to him. "I know." The hand over Silvestri's heart shot out to the side, toward Draco, and Draco's wand flew from his shirt sleeve to Potter's reaching grasp like a master calling forth his disciple. Potter regarded the wand in his hand for a moment, before flipping it end over end.
Draco stepped back and his hand fell from Potter's startled face, even paler now under the harsh truth of Draco's words. He raised it again, this time to wipe the mess on his shirt, leaving a stain on the rumpled white fabric. His snort of disgust echoed through the living room as he turned on his heel and went upstairs.
"Let's go home."
He takes a quick breath and stares deeply into Draco's eyes, willing him to listen. "You have to trust me. When I ask you if you have a safeword, it's because I intend to honor it, should you ever need it. I won't ignore it or disregard it. I can't. That's not the kind of man I am. And that's not the kind of relationship we will have. You will be able to trust me with this."
been up to. Because Neville is as honest as the day is long, and Harry thinks that particular truth just might send Ron round the twist. At the thought, Harry throws back his head and dissolves into furious snickers.
Potter’s throat closed and rippled around him, and his tongue circled the length of his cock, while those agile fingers pressed up and up and up, going after that one spot that hurled him over the precipice. Draco groaned as he came, his body pulsing in waves down that silken vise, shivering while stars danced behind his eyes.
Potter snorted. "Of course. I've come a long way, but I'm nowhere near where I want to be."
Millie sounds remarkably like Pansy, only less-polished and with a bit more spite. Harry sips his pumpkin juice and smiles warmly at her.
Narcissa's hands curl into fists at her side. "I am no Malfoy. You knew my nature when you bought my Black blood, like you bought my lineage and my fortune. It's too late for either of us to regret our choices."
"Look at me, Draco. Show me that pretty face. I want to see how much you want it."
Potter froze and jerked back, horror clashing with want on his flushed face.
Draco shucked off his clothes with a minimum of awkwardness in his haste. If he looked ungainly in his efforts, Potter either didn't notice or didn't care. He watched Draco with a focused intensity that stole his breath, his gaze caressing each new part to be revealed. Potter's breathing came in slow, deep rolls as his eyes trailed over the point of an elbow, the hollow of a hip, and the long line of a pale thigh.
Harry's lips purse. "Aftercare is not an option. You have put yourself in my hands, and I am responsible for you. I have a duty of care toward to you that I take very seriously. It is an honorable obligation and an essential part of this relationship for me. I want to take care of you. In all the ways that I can. Aftercare is necessary because it gives me a way to assess your physical and mental health after a scene. It lets me know what I've done right, and what I need to work on. If I'm pushing you too hard, or—" Harry's tongue flicks out over his lips, "not hard enough. It creates closeness and cements the bond that will form between us." He steps closer, entreating Draco with a soft look. "Will you let me care for you?"
"This way. The family mortuary is in a clearing off to the left of the Manor."
Harry nods. "I'll firecall him tomorrow."
Silvestri's eyes were wide and terror-stricken, and high-pitched keening noises erupted from his throat.
Draco's strangled whimper is his only response.
He returned his gaze to his own paperwork on the table, picking up the sheet of letterhead with the logo he'd decided on. Severus had left the details up to him, specifying only that his share of the profits be donated to a revolving list of charities he had chosen. At the top center of the parchment, a raven with a set of spectacles perched atop the edge of a black cauldron, dangling a dark green serpent from its beak. 'D.S & CO.' was whited out on the face of the cauldron, with the tag 'Quality Potions for Discerning Tastes' written in Slytherin green below. It was simple, elegant, with a mysterious edge that Draco found comforting. Not to mention that one would be hard pressed to connect it to the name 'Malfoy'.
Without a word, Harry turns from him and goes to the sofa, sitting down. He places his right hand on the arm and lets his left arm rest across the back. He swings one leg across the other at the ankle, the very picture of confidence and control.
Draco's face scrunched up in horror. "I thought it was her bringing the dead mice back here. I tried to dispose of one, and the brat nearly took off my finger. I guess I know where the violent streak is coming from—your bloody owl."
Harry shifted backward, sliding his arse onto the table, pulling Draco into the vee of his thighs. His cock pressed against the fly of his jeans, uncomfortably wet and impossibly needy. He bucked up, seeking friction as he sucked at Draco's neck, needing to complete the circuit of feeling from mouth to groin for optimal satisfaction. Draco's hands came down hard on his hips, pinning him place, preventing him from rocking further. Harry grunted his protest against Draco's skin, slinging his legs around Draco's waist to trap him. There was pleasure here to be taken, open and raw, like the gape of an old wound, and Harry wasn't going to let either one of them escape it.
