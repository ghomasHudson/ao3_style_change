He was pleasantly surprised to actually be able to see into the living room. Of course, he could only see the empty sofa, but still. "Ron? Hermione? Are you up yet?" he called.
"Yeah? I'm not complaining."
"Sunflower — tends to symbolise loyalty, adoration, and longevity," Jamie read aloud for the students that couldn't see. "Okay, has anyone found honeysuckle yet?"
He wasn't sure quite where he was going, but he figured it didn't really matter — he just wanted to walk. Avoiding the upper floors, which had not been fixed so splendidly after the battle as the Great Hall and lower floors had been, Harry decided that wandering the dungeons might be a safe bet. They were creepy and drafty, but they were unlikely to remind him of much besides Snape.
, Draco was nervous all over again. This was going to end badly.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair, their mouths still brushing occasionally but not quite kissing.
“Has to be part of the draw then, because you certainly didn’t go in blind.”
"Ha ha," Harry deadpanned.
"Lover's quarrel?" Ron asked, and Hermione stepped on his foot.
There were cries of “Cheers!” from around all the tables, and some applause.
"It's a good job you had him with you, then. Who knows what might have happened otherwise."
look over the notes. They were much more interested in what on earth had just happened. What had Professor Potter been talking about?
"Students," he warned Draco and Harry, who both looked up as if they had forgotten that the rest of the world existed.
"Well, always nice to know I'm the last option."
"Go fix your classroom so you can come back and get some sleep before breakfast."

began to play. All three of them groaned as she laughed.
They both looked up to see Molly looking at them with her hand over her heart.
"Wait, no, it's
Draco leaned down and kissed him chastely. "You're ridiculous, you know."
, but he didn't seem constantly tired and weighed down anymore. It was a strangely beautiful thing for Molly to watch: her last child finally growing up. It didn't matter that he wasn't the youngest, he was still the baby of the family.

you don't want it sized for yourself? Or a bit...smaller for someone in the future?"
He looked down at where the quill had scratched his arm, and saw a thin line of blood there. Some of the ink began to drip into his eyes, and he wiped it away in annoyance, but when he pulled his hand away it was covered in red. More blood dripped from his hand onto the small cut on his arm, and Harry watched as the blood in his hand thickened and congealed into red wax, which continued to drip onto his arm. More wax began to pour from the laceration, burning as it came out of his skin. The wax splashed onto the floor, and began to flood the floor with scarlet, which began to cling to the skin of his bare feet and climb up his legs.

When they arrived back at Hogwarts for dinner, they couldn't stop beaming at each other. Both of their left ring fingers now proudly displayed two shining rings.
really handle!"
Draco hugged him.
, it had just sort of happened. "So?" he asked.
Harry let go of the hinged pillar, but it stayed somewhat ajar. As they heard him walking away, the three students crowded closer to listen.
Draco sat back, efficiently undid the top clasp and yanked his robes over his head, tossing them to the floor, and looking at Harry expectantly. Harry had not gotten very far at all with removing his own robes, as he found himself taking in Draco's form. There was so much skin — he was completely bare besides his boxers, and he was breathtaking. He traced a hand down Draco's chest and looked up to meet his eyes.
"I think I'll be fine for one night."
"Six!"
Harry cut Lavinia off. "Whatever. You know what, do your stupid tests; I don't even care. I'm not under any sort of influence, and maybe if you see that with your own two eyes, everyone will stop pretending it's so
" Harry cut himself off as Ron's face disappeared from the flames.
"Never understood why you don't make the potions yourself, you're plenty capable."
." Harry's voice allowed for no compromise, but Ron and Hermione deftly ignored it.
Harry's hand on his shoulder broke his concentration, and he jumped slightly; however, his face quickly eased into a smile once he saw it was Harry.
"What can you
The class perked up, excited. A Slytherin raised his hand.
"Well, no. I mean he's...Draco," he finished lamely, unable to find the words to describe what he meant. Actually, he wasn't even quite sure what he meant.
"I love you," Harry sighed, and wriggled over so that the length of their bodies touched, grabbing Draco's hand to intertwine it with his own. "I don't think I could ever get tired of you."
"Draco." Harry said, in much the same way as the first time, placing a warning hand on his arm, and fiercely attempting to hold back his laughter.
"Not at all."
He was doing a lesson with his Second Year Ravenclaws on identifying the differences between similar herbs. As he stirred the cauldron with his right hand, he gestured to the herbs with his left. The light caught something quickly, and one of the boys gasped loudly.
"So Malfoy," she finally said.
Harry smiled. "Of course."
Draco grinned, and leaned in to shout back.
He stalled on the staircase, debating whether to just go up to his dormitory and stick it out or go to the kitchens and risk being late for curfew. The staircase made a deep rumbling sound and began to move. Well that settled it. Harry began heading back down the stairs to the kitchens; he hadn't made it far anyway.

that he was dead, but he certainly hadn't been broken up about it when he'd heard that Lucius had died in Azkaban.
" Draco challenged sharply.

Harry eyed his goblet warily.
"I know, I know. I just wish...that things had been different. I mean that was kinda my life plan. Get married to Ginny, become an Auror, have a big family. I guess I didn't really think about..."
"Would you like another dance before we go?" Harry asked.
"You're

"Oh, I'm sorry, were we already fucking at that point? No, you had plenty of time to decide that maybe this wasn't the most brilliant idea you've come up with."
They all nodded eagerly.
"Great Hecate, Harry, what did you
"You think they'll be okay with it?"
"Hey Ron," he yawned. "What's up?"
Harry laughed.
, despite his earlier fretting.
“Red Hot Chili Peppers?” Harry asked, following him into the bedroom.
Harry's distress was palpable, and all at once Draco felt the guarded, biting snark drain from him, and he was left feeling wrung out and exhausted.
Breathe. He didn't need to do this. Breathe. He was safe. Breathe. Harry wouldn't hurt him. Breathe.
He sat up to see a frantic Draco Malfoy pulling on his clothes from around the room.

"Today, we will talk about the Draught of Living
"You alright?" Harry asked, amused.
," he scoffed to himself.
"That does
"Probably?" Harry asked.
Harry gave an experimental lick to the edge of the water, and Draco let out a muffled groan, tightening his hand in Harry's hair and baring his neck. Harry huffed out a small laugh, but obligingly lavished attention over his neck until Draco became coherent again.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Whatever, I need to go make dinner if we're to eat anytime soon."
Harry laughed. "For courage." And kissed him.
. Harry hadn't been expecting him to be so eager, but he was not
Draco persisted. "But there are two of us. How could we both get to it?"
"I try my best." Harry held his hand out, and Draco took it, pulling him close.
He got to his feet and held out a hand to help Draco up. "Night all. I'm going to head to bed."
, if I can manage to pass the muster, I
Fuck, this was probably a horrible idea — what if it ruined everything afterwards? How could things
Draco's hands paused in their flurry of sorting. "Ah. Whoops."
Harry could practically feel her smiling that ridiculously goofy excited smile as she told him all about Luna deciding to try adding a sports section to the Quibbler and the two of them getting closer as Ginny tried to help her out, and then being confused about whether they loved each other as close friends or as something romantic. They'd decided to try and see where that went, but it had felt a bit off, like they were still walking the line between friends and girlfriends.
"Really?" Draco asked as his hand slipped into Harry's boxers and gave him a long slow stroke, before running his thumb over the head.
He's really angry, you can't just barge in and start talking to him!"
"Bollocks," Harry swore under his breath.
Neville finally stepped forward and herded the Fifth Years off, and Harry turned to Draco.
"This okay?" he asked, and Draco felt his hot breath spill over his cock. He could only make a small noise of assent and nod.
without his consent or direction.
"You weren't complaining a minute ago. Come on, let's get back to the castle before we get hypothermia. And maybe we can even catch some sleep."
Draco had a feeling he was going to get fucked against this tree.
Later on in the evening, after most of the guests had left, Harry and Draco were left chatting with the bride and groom off to the side of the dancefloor.
Harry was excited. It would be nice to have another friend around. Maybe he and Neville and Draco could all hang out together. He thought they would get along well, especially if those two wanted to talk about plant properties, or something equally academic that Harry didn’t have much to contribute to.
Professor Potter sat back down at his desk. Luckily for Jamie the flowers were still there, although they had been moved off to the side.
"Sorry? What was that?"
Harry complied, and Draco kissed him deeply, rolling them so that they faced each other on their sides.
Harry just glared.
"One more kiss? For courage?"
Harry shivered, although the room was actually quite warm.
Whispers broke out all over the Great Hall.
Harry frowned, but kissed him again. "Fine, but we're talking more about this later."
"Harry?" Ron was looking at him with a panicky sort of worry that he was clearly trying to conceal from his friend.
Harry nodded sleepily as Draco's face disappeared from the flames, and slowly dozed back off.
Harry could hear Draco and Zylphia chatting in the front of the shop as he finished cleaning up for the day — a sound that had become increasingly familiar as Draco had started coming to pick him up from work on days he wasn't working as well. Harry had gotten in the habit of doing the same on weekends, and had built up a bit of a rapport with Draco's coworkers.
They had found a small bench next to the windows inside the bustling ice cream parlour. Draco had gotten chocolate fudge and sprinkles on his cone, as promised, and was looking incredibly pleased about the whole thing. On the other side of the glass, reporters were watching and pictures were being taken, but Harry and Draco were pretending to ignore them (despite the whole thing actually being for their benefit).
a whole lot, Ronald."
being serious." He eyed Draco's tattooed arms pointedly.
The baby looked to be not even a year old, and she babbled nonsense noises briefly before:
His first reaction was to be furious. The completely brazen lack of respect for any sort of privacy, and unashamed obvious eavesdropping was disgusting. Of course, him getting angry had only ever resulted in bad press and the questioning of his sanity — which, of course, would get ultimately blamed on
"Oh, is that a
"Yeah."
It was true they were hardly seen outside Hogwarts or their own home, but it was still funny to them that after so long, nobody else knew. And the students had picked up on it so quickly. Harry shook his head, thinking that some of the students he'd had would've been great reporters, for all the snooping they'd done.
"Don't feel like you need to—"
Ginny had introduced Luna and Cho as her girlfriends to Molly and Arthur a few weeks ago. They had already been familiar with Luna, and had gladly accepted her into the fold; and Cho charmed them both near-instantaneously.
"Some
What if they really didn't like Draco, even as much as he'd changed? He couldn't really blame Hermione for that — he wasn't sure how he'd feel about it if he were her. Obviously Draco didn't
A moment after he'd pulled his head out of the fire, Ron's head appeared. "I can't talk for long, so I'm not gonna step through, but pass me the toast, would you?"
"Why is it that you're more comfortable on my furniture than I am? I don't even like you. And please remove yourself from my papers."
Harry rolled his eyes, "Don't say it like that. I know what you're thinking, but it really isn't like that." He looped his scarf around his neck, and pulled on his gloves. "Now can I go home, or do you want to meddle in my personal affairs a bit more?"
Draco pushed back against him again and his moans suddenly went up an octave.
. I knew our relationship wouldn't be easy, and I'm not surprised you avoided the issue like you always do — and I'm not blaming you," she added quickly, before he could protest. "I don't expect for us to just get back together and both of us to spontaneously be okay, that's not what I'm looking for.
"We just wanted to check in with you," Lavinia said gently. "How have you been feeling lately?"
Draco turned his head. "Mmm? You finally want me to fuck you? Maybe I'm not so tired."
Ron winked before disappearing in a swirl of green flames.
"And I'm pretty sure I would remember if we were
"She said she's got plenty, otherwise I'd have...gotten some for her."
"Longer, I think," she laughed. "I'm pretty sure the last time we actually had a proper chat was...last spring? I barely got to see you on your birthday, so that hardly counts."
"Bed?" Harry asked.
Draco looked briefly taken aback by the thought and care behind the words.
"Hey! I'm trying to be civil. I don't know what you want from me!"
Draco grinned as he straightened his robes. "And I love
"Well that's a
He did so, and looked expectantly at Draco, who hitched one of Harry's legs over his shoulder whilst he trailed a wet finger along the inside of the other leg until he got where he wanted. He trailed a finger over Harry's hole and lightly pressed.
"I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about, but I'm sure that, whatever it is,
Harry didn’t roll his eyes, but it was a near thing. “Everybody’s been yelled at by Harry Potter — it’s not scary at all, judging by how willing people continue to be to violate any and all personal boundaries.”
"You can eat it at my place, I'd just like to go now."
If there was any chance of fooling Hermione, they really had to be convincing. Or, that was Harry's rationale for this anyway.
"Ooh is that chicken parmesan?" Hermione asked. "It smells delicious! We brought some white wine that should go well with it."
"If you would be so kind," he replied curtly.
Harry didn't bother to try and respond. Apparently no matter who he pretended to be, he'd always piss Draco off. Perhaps it was a special talent. He led Draco backward to the couch and Draco straddled him, grinding down on his lap and gasping slightly at the feeling as Harry pulled on his hair to get better access to where he was kissing and sucking at his neck. He dug his nails into Harry's back and Harry groaned.
Draco stopped short, however, when he reached the room, and saw a Prophet delivery owl in the window, waiting for payment.
"Hey," he finally responded, a bit awkwardly.
"Yeah, interesting thing, distraction."
He hummed a Christmas song as he made his way up, as he was in unusually good spirits. When he got to the fourth floor, though, he could hear intermittent shouts. They must have been coming from Harry's classroom.
True to the healers' predictions, it had been quite a few months, and still every morning he woke up with it aching. He thought a bit ruefully, that it was funny how short-lived his Auror career had been, considering that it had apparently been the only fathomable career option for him as far as everyone else was concerned. Himself as well, he supposed, but mostly because he hadn't ever had the faintest idea of what he'd
Draco walked right up against Harry and spoke in his ear. "It wasn't really sarcasm, though, was it?"
He made his way to the kitchen and picked up yesterday's Daily Prophet to continue skimming through the Help Wanted and Classifieds sections. Really, it was the only reason he bought the paper anymore — it had become quite a bit more like Witch Weekly than a reputable and relevant news source. Even after four years, they still tracked Harry, and anything, absolutely
"You're gonna make it that bad?" Draco quipped back, pulling his shirt over his head, and Harry snogged him rather than responding. Draco moaned when Harry sucked and bit at his lower lip, so apparently he'd managed to make his point nonetheless.
." Comprehension dawned on Beth's face.
"What?"
"Harry, did you never consider that this might be some sort of hex put on you? Or a side effect from too much Dreamless Sleep potion?"
Harry sat silently waiting for him to finish. Really, Draco massively overestimated Harry's cunning.
Draco allowed himself to stare at Harry, taking him in as much as possible whilst he still could; it would only look like he was as lovesick as he was meant to be in the pictures. Harry would simply think he was acting well.
"Yeah, except I was in
well! But I don't want to jinx it, and, well, with mum already up in arms about you and Malfoy, I didn't want to add fuel to the fire. Plus, I don't really know if they're as serious about it as I am…" She trailed off, and Harry waited for a moment, before flicking the back of her head.
"Hm. Okay," Rodya said again, and reached over to pat his hand. "Bring him over for dinner some time, yes? I would like to meet him properly."
Harry brought his hands down to squeeze Draco's arse and spread him open. He swiped his tongue over the area and Draco moaned. Well that was a good sign. He circled his tongue around and dipped it inside. Although he'd been stretched, it was more difficult than Harry had anticipated.
Work the next day was anxiety-inducing for a different reason than Draco had expected. His coworkers were indeed having hushed conversations about him, but less about the boyfriend/queer thing, and more about the fact that Missy and Rob had apparently overheard much of his and Harry's argument.
"There's nothing wrong with my shoulder," Harry protested.
He could feel his Snitch tattoo beating, telltale, over the pulse point in his throat though, and on the inside, he was shaking just as the boxes had been only moments before. Rationally, he knew — or at least he
A Hufflepuff boy raised his hand hesitantly.
"Hard." Harry demanded. After all, what was the point of a sensation you couldn't understand? Eventually, with enough of it, it will have to go one way or the other.

," Harry warned him before turning back to the students. "Madam Pomfrey looks after Luna in her office when we're in classes, otherwise she's with us in our room."
Draco was not going to be happy about this. Harry turned back inside the room and went to wake him up.
Almost before he could process it, he was thrusting into Draco, amidst moans of encouragement. The next thing he knew, Draco was face down on the mattress, apparently unable to hold himself up as Harry thrusted down into him.
He didn't even notice that he'd already completely forgotten about his frustration from everything that had happened earlier in the day.
"Thank you, Harry. I love you too. So much."
"Okay, let's go."
. It was difficult to describe. He was just as sharp with his tone, but he seemed to have switched from outright antagonism to joking barbs.
"I believe you've done the same thing, Harry. Multiple times," Hermione responded (in a notably unsympathetic fashion).
"Wow. I wonder if they're getting married?"
settled down with someone they were expected to — until Harry and Ginny had split up, that is. Harry didn't know if this was the way the rest of the wizarding world was, but he'd never recalled knowing of any queer couples that weren't between school-age people, and even those were kept a little hush-hush.
Harry smiled at the initials — he just
Harry blushed.
"No. If they can't even tell us they're together, then there's no way they're already getting married," someone decided.
Personally, Harry was getting quite sick of everybody's opinions on which relationships were allowed to be

But firstly, Draco wasn't supposed to
The boy stepped back and beamed at them.
"Hmm, this makes me rethink a lot of things."
"Hmm. Well, if you don't mind, please ask Draco if he's planning to come over for New Years as usual. We didn't know if you two had plans or something, and he's ignoring Rodya's owls still. Tell him to stop being rude whilst you're at it, too — they're beginning to get hurt, and I'm
Once out of sight, Harry sighed and relaxed his shoulders. "Thanks."
"Okay, but what happened?"
"Oh. Hey Harry."
would still know," he argued. "And whenever anyone is in here—"
"We talk plenty! There's— it isn't like that. He doesn't see it that way."
There was
“But seriously, the two of you complement each other in such a beautiful way.” He looked to Hermione. “And with your logic, and Ron’s strategic mind, I’ve absolutely no doubt the two of you could take over the whole world if you had a mind to. I guess we’re all lucky you’ve set your sights a bit smaller,” he winked, and the audience laughed again.
"Sorry," he choked out, still laughing. "Perhaps we should relocate to the room, where there is a significantly lower chance of being injured."
When he arrived at the Great Hall, he discovered he was a few minutes late. Oh well. It was worth it to not have to go back to his office after dinner. He headed for the only empty seat left between Draco and Pomona. It was time to test that truce, he guessed.
He had tried not to worry too much earlier about Hermione's perceptiveness and the possibility of her seeing through the lie of their 'relationship', but he was starting to get a little uneasy. Hermione could just be so hard to read when she wanted to be, and he had no idea whether she was onto them or not.

"Oh come on, we aren't
"Thank you headmistress, it's nice to see you as well. I remember where the room is." Harry spoke stiffly and politely out of nervousness.
Draco bit his lip, restraining himself from making a crack about Ron's reading ability. Might come across a bit mean, even if he didn't really mean it.

As if on cue, they heard the fireplace splutter to life in the living room, and Ron's voice rang out. "Harry?"
Her older sister laughed.
Harry refocused his attention as Professor Flitwick (
"Whatever, Draco. You're just mad because you know they all actually think my class is better than yours."
"Oh." Draco said quietly, looking put out. So he was going to go back to being alone for Christmas. Great. At least
"I'm just saying," he muttered.

Neville gave him a look.
Harry summoned it wordlessly and handed it over. Draco murmured a spell and his hand was suddenly coated in some sort of oil.
Draco was not dealing well. He seemed personally offended by how willfully oblivious the papers were. Harry had now come to expect the daily hysterically exasperated firecalls from Draco.
"I'm going to fuck you right here like an animal. You don't deserve to lay down like a person. You don't deserve a bed," He panted before kissing Draco again, biting his lip and swiping his tongue over Draco's.
As it turned out, the papers

Besides Slughorn himself, Harry could have sworn that both Ron and Hermione had been sending him concerned glances nearly without stop throughout the entire lesson. He couldn't be certain, however, because he had refused to look at either of them, not wanting either of them to try and start up a discreet conversation.
Pages were being flipped frantically.

Draco put a bit of the spinach (or, at least he was
But he quickly pulled back again, abruptly serious. "Wait; I'm sorry."
Harry woke to brisk knocking on the pillar that guarded his quarters. Classes had just started up again, and he was exhausted.
Draco hesitantly gripped the outline of his cock through the thin material of his pyjamas and stroked. Harry eagerly pushed into his hand, kissing his neck and moaning lowly.
Flopping back down, Harry listened to see if any of the other boys was awake yet. Only hearing even breathing and snores, he resigned himself to staring at the curtains as always. Strangely though, Harry felt antsy and unable to just lie and stare as he had gotten so used to doing.
Harry murmured something unintelligible and turned over, and Draco checked the time. Half seven. He should probably get up, because he hadn't a clue when the Weasleys usually started their festivities, but he could surely let Harry sleep a little longer. He looked so peaceful, and really, he deserved it after the nightmare he'd had.
"Er, yeah. Okay."
"Fuck, Draco."
Harry wondered sarcastically when Neville had become an expert on feelings.
"Just let me know when you feel like spilling whatever's got you smiling like a loon," she said as she left the room.
"Oh no, he knows you're

"Harry Potter! Harry Potter, do you have any comments on your new, erm...roommate, Draco Malfoy? How can you live with someone who followed You Know Who?" a reporter asked, a Quick Quotes Quill hovering at the ready over a piece of parchment by their shoulder.
"Xenophilius knows and is supportive — more than, actually. He was 'overjoyed that Luna had found such wondrous partners,' I think he said." She briefly smiled, recalling his words, but it quickly dropped again. "But I know Cho hasn't told her parents. I don't know if that actually
) at the Burrow yesterday, but it already rolled off his tongue easily. It was as if after the first time, the floodgates were open and there was no closing them back.
Harry snorted. He had perhaps gone a bit overboard laughing when he had first seen that particular tattoo. It was a small stick-and-poke broom — no more than an inch — that hovered around the inside of Draco's hip bone, occasionally bucking an invisible rider. That on its own wouldn't have prompted questioning, but the inscription under it, along with the suggestive placement had had Harry in stitches.

Draco laughed, the corners of his eyes crinkling. "They're not entirely wrong, when
Draco stood, and Rodya hugged him again. "I will see you
Harry had decided against doing anything festive for his classes this year, and was simply continuing to work with his Fourth Years on shield charms.
They laid there in content silence for several minutes, before Harry forced himself up to sitting and groaned.
"No," Draco interrupted himself to press a languorous kiss to Harry's mouth. "It's just that it's really late and I should probably be going back to my room," he said with obvious regret.
"Harry, you have to— the way you look at him sometimes, it's like you used to look at Ginny when you first started dating. And the way you two act around each other...it's strange. You two are probably some of the most guarded people I know, and yet you're so comfortable with each other. You don't find that strange?"
Harry, took a swift step around Draco, as he held him, and Apparated them straight to his place before he even had a chance to properly think about what he was doing. Draco gasped.
He went into work defeated, after half an hour of trying their Floo.
Draco tipped his head back and laughed.
"It's an improved healing draught I've been working on, and I think I've finally made sure the nausea side effect is gone."
entertaining, and that something was brag to Draco.
He groaned aloud because he knew he didn't really think that, and decided to push all issues away for now into the back of his head. He would do work. Opening his bag, he looked through for the piece of parchment on which he had written his assignments for the week. Deciding any assignment was as good as another, he chose at random. Transfiguration essay, then — two and a half feet on the differences between transfiguration of inanimate and animate subjects.
"Hold on, where is my wand?"
"'S'okay. 'S nice," Harry murmured, eyes sliding shut again as Draco planted a few more kisses over his shoulder and the top of his arm.
"I got your wedding invitation too — awfully cheeky."
. To the one-bedroom flat with Draco."
"You had some ice cream on your face," he explained, and then slowly sucked the ice cream off of his thumb whilst continuing to look Harry in the eyes.
"Maybe this'll make you feel better. Molly gave it to me for you."
"I'm not the only one either." She turned and saw Harry holding the book.
"What, dear? Did you call?"
Draco wavered. "I suppose...you don't think it'll be a problem?"

"Such. A fucking. Smartarse," Harry slid his hands under Draco's bum, and stood.
Ron yawned loudly. "Morning. Merlin I'm tired. Did Harry wake you up earlier too?"

The discussion would be complicated and messy, because he had promised that he and Ginny would get back together after everything was over, and he still loved her but he didn't know how to have a relationship anymore. It seemed like so much effort, and he never wanted to be around
Draco blinked as a bright flash momentarily dazed him. Well then. The reporters had certainly arrived.
"Yes," she replied, giving him an inquisitive once-over. She looked away, ostensibly deciding it could wait until later, or perhaps speculating quietly in her head. The silence filled the space between them awkwardly as several students passed and they waited.
"Molly...?"
Harry was frozen, his mind a jumble of thoughts.
"Harry?" There was a light knock on the wooden doorframe.
"Well more power to ya," she said, taking a swig of her eggnog. "He's not exactly known for being sweet, so you must be doing something right."
He'd really enjoyed visiting with Teddy and Andromeda. She was a very nice woman, and Teddy was hilarious. Plus, Harry had given him a book when he visited! He loved it. He visited Andromeda's four more times, each time with Harry, before it was time for him to go back to Hogwarts.
After the fourth time Draco entered class late, quickly cleaning his robes of what looked like vomit with a spell, one of the students got up enough guts to ask.
"Hello?" he called, as he stepped out of the swirling green flames. He had to stoop a bit for their fireplace, but at least he'd learnt to avoid knocking his head after the first time.
, they would let it go. Unfortunately, with Valentine's Day coming up, he was afraid they might be paying closer attention.
By the end of October, they'd started occasionally showing up in each other's offices before dinner to try to one-up each other. Harry wasn't quite sure how it had started, but it was pretty much the norm nowadays.
, hm? You mean to that one-bedroom flat with Draco?"
This chapter is NOT COMPLETE, it is only 2/3 the way done.
Harry sighed and put down the knife he was chopping carrots with, turning to look at her. "I told you when we talked over the Floo about this that I'm not expecting any miracles. I
The healers looked at each other again, and Lavinia sighed.
Indeed, only a few minutes passed before the need for a distraction was no more.
Draco gave him a disbelieving look. "Well
and people were hard for Harry to deal with. On top of that, Harry didn't want to disappoint them by pretending things were okay and then acting differently when he tried to spend time with them. Because as much as he could try, he knew there was no way he could truly act like he used to.
"But...wasn't Dean dating Ginny Sixth Year?"
"Yes headmistress."
"Of course I'm serious! Why
The conversations got progressively more ridiculous, but luckily the students would have a long break to forget. Or not to.
He had cooked dinner because he'd seen that Draco was tired, he always made sure that Draco ate and got plenty of sleep, and he never woke him up harshly, even when Draco was going to be late. He'd always stroke his arm or his neck, or pet his hair until Draco slowly woke up, instead of jolting awake. Draco didn't know how Harry knew — or maybe he didn't and was just that nice — but whenever he was woken up suddenly he would always be flooded with adrenalin and start to panic before realising it was just a regular morning. He'd smashed the ridiculous Muggle alarm clock he'd gotten years ago. He hadn't even had it for a week.
"Sir, what happened last night?"
"Professor Potter?" a Hufflepuff raised his hand.
"For now the password is 'bowtruckle'; you may change it whenever you like. I trust that you would like to get settled in now?"
"What?"
"What?" Harry asked.
"Don't worry Golden Boy, I'm not up to any nefarious plots — you don't have to keep an eye on me."
Harry stared at the book, dumbfounded. They weren't serious, were they? He flipped through the book (over a hundred pages!), and saw page after page of varying handwriting with signatures at the bottom of each anecdote. Some were titled, and some had small doodles. It was terribly embarrassing that they'd managed to do this, but it was also terrifyingly impressive.
"There's nothing stopping you from being as loud as you want. We don't need any spells, we'll just be put down to more wild animals in the forest," Harry gasped hotly in his ear, and Draco moaned as Harry ground against him.
Eyeliner smudged to his satisfaction, he added a nifty little temporary vision spell he'd found so he could do without his glasses for a few hours. Whilst he was at it, he charmed his eyes brown and his hair a bit lighter and longer. He knew charms wouldn't do a thing about the state of it, so he didn't even bother. Looking in the mirror, he tapped his wand on his chin (something he'd been repeatedly not to do by Hermione — honestly it was quite dangerous) and frowned. He made some minute adjustments to the way his facial features sat and...
"Yes, thanks. Ron and Draco have both already felt the need to tell me that."
"Jeremy?"
"You look ridiculous. Get up and get dressed."
"I wasn't sure at first, but it was what Professor Malfoy
"You haven't changed in a bad way, no, and you're still definitely Harry, you're just, well...I'm not sure how to put it. I guess I didn't even know you could smile that big. Even at the Quidditch World Cup you didn't look like this. I'm not exactly concerned, but I'm wondering if I maybe should be."
The competition was a bit ridiculous, but it was really all they had. When he wasn't swamped in essays, he had to do
"That isn't the point!
Harry squeezed Draco tighter. "No. I'm comfortable."
All of the students heard, and remained silent for the remainder of class as their teacher slumped in his chair, his head hung.
He wrinkled his nose. "The only ones I really have are secondhand and don't fit too well. Don't even know why I keep them, honestly."
last night, and I of course looked like
Gently, he placed slow, careful kisses down Harry's jaw and neck, and Harry's eyes fluttered open.
Harry crawled into bed and shook his head. "You'll just be that much grumpier tomorrow morning."
"Neither are you, because he's a
"Aubergine," Draco corrected. "Thank you."
"You're too good at this." He mumbled. "Quit your job and become my full time masseuse."
As Draco got nearer, he saw the man was dancing on a woman. No matter, it didn't seem like they'd come together, it shouldn't be to hard to break in. He danced closer and lightly placed his hands on the guy's hips from behind, making him turn around in surprise. He leaned forward to speak in Draco's ear.
When Neville announced he'd better head off, somewhat late on a Friday, Harry and Draco had continued talking for a few more hours quietly in the dim light of the fire. They had been sitting quite close with Neville there — even with Draco's arm around Harry's shoulders — but now he was practically curled in Draco's lap.
"He's going to go completely barmy, and he thinks it's his teaching.
"What an honour to meet you! I must say, I never really expected
Harry rolled up his sleeves and started to scrub, as she started to talk and ask him questions about seemingly any and everything
"Predictable." She said, finally swallowing properly, and brushing crumbs off of her front. Presumably she was talking about the Quidditch, but perhaps also about Harry's complaining. "Anyway, I've missed you!"
"Er, yeah. I've got that next— first, whatever."
McGonagall announced that Ravenclaw was the winner of this year's house cup, and the Great Hall was suddenly decorated in blue and bronze. Loud cheers rose from the Ravenclaw table in front of Harry.
Harry lowered his head and licked a long stripe from base to tip and Draco groaned. Looking back up to Draco, he circled the head with his tongue and then closed his mouth over it entirely, sliding down a couple of inches and sucking.
Perhaps there was a way to get rid of the guilt without being a terrible person. Maybe if he talked to Ginny... it couldn't hurt to talk to
"Minerva? What is it?"
For such casual language, Harry thought it sounded like Draco had put quite a bit of thought into this. However, he decided not to comment. He looked at the bird to make sure it was still occupied picking pieces of whatever it liked out of the curry, and returned to his room to reply.
"Shut
Her eyes darted up to his, and back to the orb. She waved her wand, making it disappear, and quickly performed another spell, which made a green ring appear around his chest.

"We really ought to find more excuses to get you dressed up," Draco murmured, as another song began. "Not that you aren't always handsome, but…" his eyes trailed over Harry appreciatively, "the dress robes are certainly doing you favours."
When Harry and Draco got back from the winter holidays, they wore matching rings on their right hand middle fingers. They were silver and gold braided bands with three small emeralds set in them.

them? For him? And she was expecting Harry to bring him back next year?
"Goodnight," Draco repeated back distantly, as Harry settled back in with his head on Draco's shoulder and arm securely around his waist.
It had just been so

"You know, you can say something if you want to," Ginny spoke, making Harry swallow guiltily. She was just too observant. He still didn't want to burden her with the things going on in his head; she had enough to deal with on her own.
Draco's hand tightened in Harry's hair — he didn't even know when his hand had
"Hello. Fancy seeing you here."
move. Fucking hell."
He slid carefully out of bed, shoved his glasses onto his face, and gave an almighty stretch, which produced several rather alarming popping sounds from his joints.
"Pure spite. If it weren't for all the little bastards who think they're detectives around here, I would've just been straightforward when we first started dating."
They had done excellently when paired up, so he told them they could leave early after he handed back their essays. He opened the door to his office, and stopped in surprise.
to find a way to murder him."
Harry smiled. "I'll ask him. I think you'll like him, despite what a prat he was in school."
He was barely able to keep from rolling his eyes at the man, and refused to grant that with an answer; merely reaching into his pocket for his coin purse, and asking flatly, "How much?"
"You're more than welcome to stay! We have plenty of food to go around."
"I'm not being mean!" Draco protested, flicking him in the side. "I was about to make dinner, and
Harry set his face, trusting Draco not to lie about actually wanting him to stop. He grabbed Draco's hair tightly, yanking his head forward so that his lips were right against Draco's ear, and Draco gasped. "Don't fucking lie to me," he whispered harshly. "You want this, you want to be used, you want to be owned. You want it so bloody badly, don't you? You know exactly what you're doing when you flaunt yourself in front of me like that." Draco shivered.
"You wouldn't mess it up. And it's clearly fine now, so I don't know what you're whingeing about. What I want to know is what's got you humming back here like a drunk lark."

Draco sighed. "You're the one who said we ought to eat. Move your arse."
quite cute  in Draco's opinion. He looked down at the petals and raised an eyebrow, blushing slightly. "Red and salmon? I should have known that would be the extent of your knowledge."
"Ouch." Harry laughed, and traced his fingers idly along Draco's torso.
"I didn't want to wake you, but it's getting late and I thought you should eat something."
"Okay, yeah, I can see that. As long as I can tell Ron and Hermione. And Neville."
"What happened?" Several students asked in alarm.
"Yes, it's definitely that."
He leaned down to hug Zylphia, and then took his leave.
"Draco." He acknowledged.
Harry laughed and shoved at his shoulder. "Okay, okay I
"Erm…" Harry looked about, wondering why the man was suddenly unresponsive. "So...can you resize it? Is that an option?"

She nodded briskly, and swept away down the corridor.

"Nobody
thinking!" he agreed, tugging an anxious hand through his hair. "This isn't like in the regular world, they're—" his voice dropped to a whisper to hiss out, "
Draco smiled slightly against his will.
"A wizard? Praying? I'm flattered," he joked.
A couple of students halfheartedly laughed at what was apparently supposed to be a joke.
of plot here lol.
They stood there swaying silently, cheek to cheek for some time.
without your glamour."
"So," Harry asked, after he turned off the fan. He handed Draco his plate with a quick kiss, and Draco nearly dropped it. Harry didn't appear to notice, sitting down at the table, and continuing to make conversation. "How's Zylphia?"
"It can heal more serious injuries and some hexes, and it heals small things faster."
"Why what?"
Harry rubbed his shoulder tiredly and wished the damned thing would stop hurting already. There was hardly a chance of that, though; the healers at St. Mungo's had assured him he was likely to have chronic pain for the rest of his life. There wasn't anything physically wrong with it anymore, but since he had been dealing with the pain for so long (thinking it would heal on its own), his brain had decided that that was just how the shoulder was. He supposed that was what he got for being so reckless in the field and then passing off the injury as minor, but when had he ever been anything but reckless?
He reached up to kiss him, and this time when their lips met, it was sweeter, more gentle.
Acting out of habit, Harry grabbed a slice of buttered toast and commenced staring at the table. Robotically, he began pulling it to pieces and occasionally nibbling on one or the other. He hadn't eaten much at dinner the night before, and his stomach growled, but he ignored it. It wasn't only hunger — he felt quite queasy as well, but was well used to it. At Grimmauld Place he had kept to the same ritual every morning, and it was working fine so far. His stomach had felt off ever since their irregular year traveling. The past few months hadn't really done anything to fix that.
Draco snorted, but nodded his permission.
"Minerva? What is it?" he pushed the pillar that served as the entrance to his rooms open, only to find three Seventh Year prefects standing there.
to think was commiseration, but was more likely the result of his internal stomach flutter not being deemed sufficiently torturous. How rude.
"Erm. It— it'll do."
The other advantage of not taking the train was that he had a few hours to put away his things and set up his office and classroom. And maybe discuss a truce with Draco Malfoy. If he wasn't being a prick.
"An illustrated flower identification book. I thought we might need it," she said proudly.
"Try them on," Draco urged. "If you can see your willy they're too tight, but otherwise they're fine."
"I've got a free period in the morning. I was just going to stay here," Harry responded, still holding onto his aggressive tone.
“That was just such a lovely speech, Harry,” Arthur said, for probably the third time.
He reached over to pick up Harry's goblet and took a sip of the pumpkin juice. He smiled and handed it to Harry.
"This is it. I've actually taught at Hogwarts for an entire school year. That's amazing."
He ran back down, waving the parchment to dry, and folding it too quickly, knowing it would likely smudge. That bird did not want to be kept waiting though, and Harry knew better than to cross a strong-minded owl. He quickly tied the parchment to its leg and stepped back. It cocked its head expectantly.
"The story in the paper. Me and Draco. I just thought I'd tell you, since it didn't seem fair to lie to you too, since you're friends with both of us. It's not like you're likely to go running to the press with it."
"My reasoning was a bit lowered—"
"Can I have a kiss first?"
The Gryffindors only looked at him expectantly.
"Yes, actually. I think my toes are gluttons for punishment."
. You were a kid too, and I'm not confident others wouldn't have done the same things if put in your place."
"What did I say about lying to me?" Harry interrupted casually, dragging his tongue over Draco's neck. "You know I'm going to have to punish you for that. Was that what you wanted? I bet it was, filthy and desperate as you are," Harry continued calmly.
"Ugh." Draco hauled himself up and pulled on one of Harry's pairs of ridiculous Muggle sweatpants. He swore this was the only occasion Harry's habit of leaving random articles of clothing all over the floor would ever be helpful.
come time for the wedding, and that he would still want to go — nevermind still wanting to go
Draco snorted, "I'll keep that in mind, and you know I'll be the first to buy a copy when it hits the shelves." He pushed the box over the table to Zylphia. "Harry told me you were having a rough pain day yesterday — any better today?"
full of dancing and drunkenness, well that would just be a bonus.
tone.
"Get back in," Harry held up the covers for him.
. The words pushed against his lips, and he pressed them shut.
Harry shrugged. "Why not?"
Harry pushed his plate to the side, reaching with his free hand to push back some of the hair that had fallen into Draco's face. "Kiss me," he whispered, and Draco smiled.
The night Peeves wrecks the potions classroom and the following Valentine's Day from a different perspective, and then gratuitous smut.
insinuate anything...unkind about you. Comes with the territory of being the saviour of the wizarding world, if you hadn't noticed. You get free passes.

"Alright. I'll play your game."
parents are dead too,
Harry and Draco appeared not to notice.
"You're a sneaky little bastard," George grinned. "Some Slytherin must be rubbing off on you, eh?"
Yes, he'd spend a few hours at St. Mungo's, grab some takeaway on the way back, and call it an early night. Perfect.
"How's that?" Harry asked.
"Why? What does salmon mean?" Beth asked her older sister.
Chapter contains explicit sexual content. Starts after the 3rd break (◇◇◇), if you want to skip.
"Ugh, I still wish I knew what the card said though," Beth whined.
Perhaps Harry should have predicted that Ron and Hermione would be suspiciously hard to get ahold of the next day.
Harry narrowed his eyes and thought back over the last couple minutes, making a sound of annoyance. "You sneaking Slytherin, you know that's not what I meant."
"He'll be back shortly, he's talking to Uncle Neville. They're doing weird things with plants to find something to fix you permanently, and I certainly don't trust that around you."
. Harry genuinely wondered what could be going through any of their heads that they thought Harry was any sort of entrepreneur, or that any of that was normal behaviour for business partners.
As the weeks went by, the students became increasingly frustrated. They were
In the laziness of coming back after a holiday, Draco had thrown on a Weasley Jumper under his cloak, not thinking anyone would see it. Of course that was the day Scotland chose to have a warm spell. The castle was...well not exactly
That got laughs, and Hermione blushed. “No regrets,” she said, squeezing Ron’s hand, and Harry smiled.
"Mate...was that supposed to be
There were a few giggles, and several students looked over at Lydia, Beth's older sister. She shrugged.
"I got chocolate, though. Honeydukes. Do you think that's just pity?"
"Mmn." Harry groaned, and rolled over, patting around behind himself until he found Draco's arm, and pulling it over his waist. "Can we have dinner in bed this time? I'm too tired to be bothered."
Figuring out how to make some Muggle appliances work with magic was truly life-changing; it took much less work to fill and turn on a coffee maker than to deal with magicking on a stove and dealing with a kettle and press and all that nonsense. For that, he would need to actually get up and do it by hand or use a wand, and a wand meant going back to his room, because he inevitably left it there every morning. He had encountered this problem every morning for

"Why didn't you go to Madam Pomfrey? What happened?" another student joined in.
"I think I'll be fine for one night."
"And you're not?" Draco countered, standing as well, and dragging him to the door by the arm.
He continued working his fingers, scissoring and twisting them to open him up. By the time he added a third finger, Draco was rocking back onto them and little moans were slipping past his lips despite his attempts to contain them.
Perhaps if he'd said something earlier on, back when he'd first noticed, Draco likely could've accepted that. But he
It was only several hours later that he realised.
, I do remember I really enjoyed it, so I hope you guys enjoy it even half as much!
"What, not absolutely thrilled to see me?" Draco asked wryly, arranging himself comfortably on Harry's messy desk, as per usual.
Hermione snorted and shrugged. "Do what you like, Harry. You're a big boy. I'm just saying maybe you should talk about this, and I wouldn't expect it to just go away."
"Oh Michael up and left a month ago — which you'd
She insisted that she cared about his opinions on what was helpful for him, but that she and Ron had already given him a chance over summer to do things his way. His way was clearly not working, as he seemed no better and quite possibly
The other two nodded.
"Hmm. Well I'd mainly need you to sort the wares and package them. My last assistant left with hardly a warning, and I haven't got the steady hands for it." Her left hand spasmed slightly, as if to emphasise the point. "I'd be handling the front and you'd be doing the chopping and such."
"I just wanted to tell you that we're sorry. We're going to start acting normally, I swear. And it's not you in the sense that you're a bad teacher or anything — really, you're an awesome teacher, I'm pretty sure you're everyone's favourite."
He frowned. Merlin, he hoped photo-him wasn't being quite so saucy on everyone else's front page; they all already hated him quite enough.
Dinner was finally finished, and things had gone pretty smoothly so far, if Harry did say so himself.
"Me and Ginny aren't ever getting back together. Regardless of anything to do with Draco," he said gently. "She's like a sister to me, and we just work so much better as friends. And I know
"Good to know, I guess," Draco said, faintly. "And how many flights of stairs do we have to go up?"
Draco gave him a look.
Draco's hand paused its petting Harry's hair, and he set the paper back down on his lap. "Well that's a bit of a heavy start."
Why was he even friends with those two? Right. Because they forgave him for doing stupid shite like getting himself into a fake relationship and lying to them about it.

supposed to be just
"What?"
Harry swallowed his food, and cleared his throat nervously. He wasn't sure if Draco would just try to brush it off. They hadn't exactly ever talked about what they
"It's fine, I just hope he gets himself together soon," Ron sighed.
"Shite," Harry swore, but didn't explain further, merely shaking his head at Ron. He braced himself for what he knew was about to come as he heard the water turn off, followed by a very deep, dramatic sigh.
They fell into silence once more.
the were bantering about at this point, as his brain felt a bit foggy, but Harry would understand the spirit of— of....whatever the fuck it was he meant.
Draco felt himself flush a brilliant red. "Your family is right here," he hissed. He swore he could feel Molly's eyes on him, and he seriously doubted she would approve of this discussion.
"Prat." Harry kissed his neck. "Okay, you're also heavy, time to get down."
"Desire."
The day looked to be fairly productive and Harry was proud of himself, even though he felt a bit silly for it. He was doing something (which was nice, despite not having done it yet), and even if it had somewhat recently been part of his daily routine to do much more, still it was something.
Draco glanced over at him, and he scooted up the bed, and then froze for a split second as he realised he had been intending to give Draco a kiss. He quickly recovered, and scooted up to sitting, wordlessly summoning his glasses and clearing his throat.
"Same here, although I've been trying to hang out with Teddy some more."
"But— I don't— Okay I think I actually am gonna throw up, hold on."
, now move so I can actually put it on plates."
"Probably. I love you."
"About how we should go to
'Probably,’ his brain told him, 'when he became part of a loving, successful marriage.'
"I'm not sure I have the answers anyway. Fuck do I still hate that Smith bloke, though. Absolute bellend."
Harry held his hands up for support, and Draco grabbed them, intertwining their fingers as he rose back up and sank down.
"See, aren't you glad we took the leap of faith and invited Draco as your plus one for you?" Hermione teased Harry, and he rolled his eyes.
and all Ron has to say is that Malfoy looks a bit too pointy to be a good time, so I'm not quite sure who exactly I should be talking to."
"It's not real, you know."

Harry did, in fact, have something to do with it. After a few minutes of watching the two play chess, he had gotten bored and wandered over to talk to George.
this was a problem in the first place?"
"It's Friday night. No classes tomorrow."
"Hey Angelina! I can take over helping if you like. They're starting a Quidditch game out back and Ron told me to send you."
Harry shrugged, unbothered.
He stood quickly, putting his wand into his robe pocket, and stripping the whole thing off carelessly onto the floor whilst he toed off his shoes (shoes of a kind that really were not meant to ever be
"Actually, I think I forgot something in the back room," Draco's voice came out noticeably strained and higher than usual. "Harry?"
"Hmm? Did I hurt you?"
Harry grinned and leaned over to whisper to Neville.
Also HEED THE WARNING in the summary: they are not drunk when they have sex, but DUBCON for Draco not knowing Harry is Harry (he's in disguise) when they have sex in this chapter.
"Oof. Hi Ginny." He tried in vain to turn his head to keep her long hair from getting in his mouth. "They're out back. Quidditch." He explained, gasping for breath. "Going to let me breathe anytime soon? Budge up!" He found himself grinning though, even as he complained.
Draco gave a tired laugh. "Well. That's... That's that, I guess. I won't be experimenting with it then — which is probably for the best, actually, considering everything that just happened from a few minutes of exposure."
"And you came
"But in the end you were too Gryffindor." Draco finished.
"This is not conducive to dinner activities," Harry finally said after a few minutes.
"Oh god, please."
Harry quickly opened the door and motioned the bird in. It turned its head away. He sighed and went inside, depositing the curry on the coffee table and opening the window for the picky owl. It stuck out its leg resentfully and sank its sharp talons into Harry's skin as he tried to untie the parchment.
Harry groaned and picked up his quill, trying to focus his attention back on the essay he'd been in the middle of marking.
’ Harry squeezed his knee under the table, and Draco turned his attention back to Luna.
Draco took a last drag of his cigarette and crushed it under his boot. He was pretty sure that the guy across the street was checking him out — he'd been just standing there for like a minute. Draco winked at him and turned down the street. He doubted the guy was shocked by his rather, er,

Harry's mouth dropped open and he raised his eyebrows. "I was

"Yeah, well we'll see if you sing the same tune the morning after." Harry doubted there would be a morning after. He was never one to stay, and Draco didn't seem the type either.
the day for...whatever this was.
"Harry?" Hermione asked, coming around the corner.
"Harry.
"What happened in the Great Hall?"
Draco gave him a questioning look, but complied without comment. Harry continued prepping him and added a couple lovebites to his back, which it became quite clear Draco was enjoying.
"Which direction?" Sophie asked, once they finally got to the sixth floor.
didn't think he could handle the stress of that.
"No, not that I was aware of."
It seemed like he would only be intentionally blinding himself to the way the world really was and the fact that he would never be able to be left content. To that side of Harry, it seemed just silly of him to wish for that when he knew he could never have it. He'd just hate himself more because he'd be faking it the whole time. Or maybe he would eventually get close, but then something was bound to come along and send him spiraling right back down like it always did. There was no point in stringing his friends along only to disappoint them more later — this way they could just go ahead and get used to him this way and move on like that.
Harry grabbed Draco's hand as they entered the narrow alleyway, and Draco raised an eyebrow. Harry shrugged. "Figured we should side-along."
"You have awful taste though," Draco muttered.
The hand in his hair slowed a bit and started to massage his scalp. Harry made an appreciative noise, and then there was another hand stroking slowly up his arm, backtracking occasionally, but ultimately heading upward. Both off the hands moved to his chest to stroke over his torso up and down and back up. He felt a shift beneath him and then both hands on his jaw and a kiss on his forehead.
During the spring holidays, they had left Hogwarts for the flat near Diagon Alley that they had been sharing for four years now. The last day of the break, they decided to go to the Leaky Cauldron for celebratory drinks.
After a moment, Draco slowly pulled out, and Harry straightened up and made a face as he turned around. Draco kissed him.
They had finally settled on a date for their wedding, and he assured them of his excitement and told them about his new job and how it was going. Ron told him about how odd it still felt in the Auror department without Harry. It was a nice conversation, and he was glad to talk to them, as it had been a while, but he had found it very hard to concentrate. Everything still felt like it wasn't real.
She paused.
"You really think you're up to the task?" Draco smirked, running a hand up Harry's stomach and over his waist.
It seemed to Harry that his actual personality didn't change so much as his close-mindedness and general practise of being a royal prick — and Harry found that Draco's personality itself was quite agreeable.
"Don't look at me. I'm the one who dragged Sophie over."
Charlie and Mrs. Weasley were the only ones to hug Draco, the former telling him he was "Not such a bad guy," and the latter insisting that they should take more food back with them.
Draco gave him a hard look. "Please, as if you would know what my classes are like. They actually involve

anything."
"I'll have you know she is already quite intelligent. Clearly nothing like you, isn't that right, Loons?"
Harry stood in front of the mirror wondering how much was too much, as he put on eyeliner. It had apparently worked in Sirius' youth so why not.
Harry had just curled back under the blankets, feeling a little bad that he was sleeping whilst Draco had to clean up the dungeons of the surely extensive havoc Peeves had wreaked, when he heard a slam and Draco stomped back into the room.
so. What was so strange about being happy when one was going to hang out with a new friend?
and still had not learnt to just pick it up when he got out of bed. In any case, he was quite lucky to have Arthur Weasley and his obsession with Muggle contraptions in his life.
"You know...I really like you, Draco. And I, er, I guess I sort of wanted to do that for a few weeks now. So, it's fine, I guess. I mean... did you— did you, er, like it?" Harry stumbled over his words, nervous that even still Draco might reject him.
." He leaned further toward Harry and hooked their ankles together under the table.
Harry stuck his tongue out and Draco raised a brow. "Better put that away before I get any more ideas."
He sighed. He should probably get started on marking all of the quizzes he'd assigned to see where the students were at. He wasn't quite sure why his past self had thought those were a good idea.
"Neither are you," Draco murmured, kissing over the spot.
"Fine. Merlin's beard, you are difficult."
Harry sat up and complied, watching Draco out of the corner of his eye.
Harry just shrugged. "If it was really important, they'd have sent another."
"Yeah, okay."
"What?" Draco groaned.
everything else that needs to be done. I'm knackered."
"You can keep going— Stop!" His own voice interrupted him without his consent when Harry had only moved about an inch. Merlin's saggy balls, it hurt, but he reminded himself he'd felt worse. The Dark Mark, for instance, or the cruciatus curse— hell, he was pretty sure he shouldn't be thinking about the war in bed.
Well. That wasn't how he'd planned on his morning going. He glanced at the clock and swore, rushing back to his bedroom.
"Alright," she brushed some ashes off of her lap and stood, addressing Dennis. "I'll see you later then?"
The last day of the school year was a little emotional for them. It was almost like the end of the first year all over again, but
After a bit, once Harry stopped treating him like glass, it got good. Really good. Harry made a particularly hard thrust, and Draco felt like he'd been electrocuted — if being electrocuted was inexpressibly pleasurable rather than painful.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. It had been quite a day. He went inside his house and slumped on the sofa. Yes, perhaps he'd better just stay here for a few hours.
"Of course. You asked Neville about them?"
Draco had been doing some Thinking™ over the summer holidays. He liked to believe he was usually a very sharp person, but he was starting the think Harry's obliviousness was catching. The fact that he was catching anything from Harry at all was the disturbing part.
Harry's lips twitched at a Malfoy saying something at all akin to a prayer. Draco had certainly picked up some things living amongst Muggles.
"You—" Harry cut himself off again and took another deep breath. "Don't go out alone anymore. Unless it's here."
"I'll owl you."
"I suppose that's true. I think it's good for you to be around people again. Getting used to being around your best friends more often again is a good step."
"I do what I can."
They got to the stairs and looked up.
"Oh yeah? You think I don't know that I'm not in a good place? Brilliant, you are! Thanks for pointing that out, Ron," he spat, still taking care to keep his voice low. He didn't want any more attention attracted to himself.
to be more sympathetic. You're the one who's punched him in the face!"
Sighing, he wrapped another sandwich in a napkin and tucked it in his bag, then took a last bite of the one he'd been working on. He'd be up to it later, and he knew he would certainly want something later. Muttering a vague excuse to Ron and Hermione, he got up and left before they could respond. Quiet and solitude was all that he wanted, and he didn't really know where to go, but some sort of alcove or something would be nice.
"Yeah, okay, but your eyes still work!"
A couple of students let out nervous giggles, and Harry walked quickly into his office and shut the door before he completely lost it. He may have felt they deserved it right now, but he couldn't take his anger out on the children.
"Do you...think it would be beneficial to your reputation to attend?" Harry rephrased.
"Okay
because of their thorns, or how
"Do you want to go on a date?" He blurted, mouth still full of eggs.
"In me?"
"But, where has she
. Ha, appropriate."
I saw through the floo."
Harry was in the middle of having his Fifth Years practise a revealing spell one by one on a journal he had hexed, when a student called out.
"Talking about me?" Draco asked, from behind him, and Harry turned.
He sat down and slumped forward onto the desk with his face in his hands. These kids were driving him absolutely up the bloody wall. He wondered briefly if they were all on some sort of drugs.
Draco briefly glanced back to glare at him.
Draco bit him sharply.
. He had failed to account for just how very charming Harry could be, and dammit, he couldn't pretend he wasn't affected.
It hadn't been so bad, he supposed. Ginny had been incredibly understanding, but he still couldn't help but wish that she had been angry. That would have made it much easier to just push her away with everyone else.
not to understand it.
"And the last day before the holidays Clara said she went into Professor Potter's office, and Professor Malfoy was sitting on the desk saying something about 'What's mine is yours', and you were holding hands!"
"I hate you," Draco muttered under his breath, and then louder, "So, any plans tonight?"
"Whenever. All the time. I can't think of anything in particular that could cause it if it's happening pretty much constantly."
Firstly, letting Harry further and further into his life? Horrible, foolish, the worst. Letting him move in was possibly the most ill-advised decision he'd ever made — not because he didn't enjoy living with Harry and spending so much time with him, but because he
Harry frowned. "You okay?"
He unclasped his cloak whilst his students were busy brewing, hoping to cool off a bit even if the jumper
Draco swallowed hard. "Okay," he said quietly. "Okay."
"It's your own fault, you know. I've been slow going because I've been a bit distracted — which I'm
"Hi Gin," he sighed.
"Fine, whatever."
Even as Draco consciously squashed the comparison to being in the Dark Lord's presence when he was angry, he couldn't deny Harry's uncontrolled magic had set him further on edge, and his hackles were up.
Harry and Draco had agreed to meet up in Hogsmeade so they could walk up to the castle together. As they walked, they began talking about Teddy's newest habit. The boy had taken an instant liking to Draco, and his hair often became white blonde when they were having a conversation. But every time Harry joined in, it would snap to black, like it often did when Harry visited. His hair had turned into a flashing checkerboard the first day, but had eventually settled on black with a white blonde streak in the front when Harry and Draco visited. Harry also swore that the boy's chin and nose were pointier, but he might have been imagining things.
— that Harry would never hurt anyone, even through a lapse of control; but the raw power coming off of him was
Draco blinked, looking over to the window and then back at him curiously.
Once the food was on the table, Draco picked up his bread and tore a piece off, unsure how to eat the food. Was he supposed to put it on the bread? Was he supposed to eat it with a fork and have the bread separately? Was he supposed to try and dip it?
He limped quickly over to his desk, figuring it was best if he didn't draw any more attention to his abnormal gait. He tried to sit and hissed in pain.
Draco's mouth twitched again. "Something like that. Or I ran out of powdered asphodel. But you know, deflating a fragile ego is just cruel."
Six months ago, Harry would have wanted to startle him and mess up his brew (admittedly, a small part of him still did), but now he realised that not only was it not worth it, but it also wouldn't make him feel better in any way. He was starting to realise how pointless most of the time and energy he'd spent antagonising Draco had been.
"Just sleep in the bed."
That's new—
Harry snorted.
Draco stroked a hand over the soft scarf, and was suddenly overcome with how much he missed his mother. Maybe it was Missy's text earlier that had brought it to the front of his mind, or maybe it was just being cared for by a mother again after several years, but whatever the reason, it hurt.
Harry kept his head low throughout the Welcoming Feast, just as he had since the final battle. Just as he had on the Hogwarts Express too, and during the First Years' sorting.
sleep in the bed."
Harry had noticed the Seventh Years had become extremely giggly in his class — the littlest things would set them off, it was ridiculous. And his Fourth Year Gryffindor/Hufflepuff class was even
"You won't, come on," he wrapped her in a hug and pressed a kiss to the side of her head. "I'm sure everything will turn out just fine, and you'll all end up old biddies, still together and talking about Quidditch and nargles and whatever else. It sounds like it's been going really well so far, and I'm so, so happy for you. It's bound to work out, I can feel it."
"You sound half fucked out already and we've barely started."
of the classes were draining. It was all so new, and he really had no idea what he was doing. Keeping the students' attention could sometimes seem nearly impossible. The Sixth Year Gryffindor and Slytherin joint class had, in particular, had been relentless.
"One day should do, I think. We needn't bother with all three, we just need to be seen rubbing shoulders with the
He checked the time — just past two, fantastic — and slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb Draco. He looked down at himself, and quickly grabbed his robe. Greeting the headmistress clad in only underwear somehow did not seem advisable.
"I know," Harry sighed, relinquishing his hold on the waistband of Draco's boxers.

"I suppose it's okay."

Then Hermione had casually mentioned that 'we have plenty of tips on wedding planning if you need any,' which had caused Draco to flush scarlet and stutter, wide-eyed, that 'I don't think that will be necessary.' Harry had tried very hard not to laugh at that, knowing full well that she had only said it to watch Draco squirm.
"Harry!" Hermione called. She was holding his bag out for him.
"So, did you actually want to talk, or did you just want some quiet with company?"
Draco gave him a patronising look. "I'm not going to make you sleep on the sofa with your shoulder."

"Jesus Chr— of course it's not a
, and it was looking like he might actually be forced to interact with her again. Wonderful.
Harry looked closer at the invitation. "
Harry laughed. "Unconventional, yet tempting. But I'll go quietly, no bribery necessary." He slid himself up slightly to kiss Draco softly on the mouth. "Goodnight."
Harry kissed him deeply. This kind of thing was just so
It didn't matter. Soon enough the papers would be publishing all about it. There would certainly be some sort of uproar in tomorrow morning's Prophet. It was likely to be wildly over-sensationalised, and it would only snowball from there in the days after. With all that, the Weasleys and everyone else would give Harry the reaction he wanted, and they'd be able to break it off, since Harry would have finally gotten his message across. Then Draco would be free to distance himself. He needed to get a breath of fresh air and remove himself from these horrid feelings, and hopefully never think about Harry again.
"That's...good?" Harry said cautiously, looking up at Draco from where he still lay sprawled on the floor.
"Hey Harry," she said gently.
"I shouldn't have shouted earlier. I'm...still kind of upset, and I do wish you'd thought it through before saying anything, but I know it was an accident, and I shouldn't have taken it out on you."
," Draco said under his breath, but turned and went back to sorting.
“Mm, he should be.
. They didn't giggle or interrupt, but they barely looked him in the eye.
"Malfoy, nice? When do I meet him again and see this miracle for myself?"
"Thought you said you preferred bottoming."
"Yes, Hea— Minerva. Thank you."
"Guess I shouldn't put my hopes on getting much more sleep tonight," Harry mumbled, sliding back into bed and resting his head on his hand to look up at Draco.
“Gonna lay back down, or am I sleeping cold whilst you stare at the bed stand all night?”
His wings smacked loudly against the sides of his open cage as he resettled himself, and Harry waved his hand halfheartedly at the bird, hoping it would shut up already. He already
"Please, Draco. What if something happens? I can't have you die, please, everyone dies. I can't—"
"Fine. I'll see you tonight," Draco acquiesced. He glanced over the masses of parchment on the desk and floor. "Possibly. I may already be asleep by the time you come in by the looks of your desk."
Draco turned over so he could face Harry, and set a hand on his shoulder. "You love me, right?" he asked, seriously. "You wouldn't say that if you didn't care, yeah?"
He shook out a black shirt with a snap, and held it up. "How do you think this will look on the front page tomorrow?"
"Oh, thanks for knocking, Hermione," He said sarcastically.
"Harry, this isn't just one small change. It's more than just your mood, I feel like your entire being had a weight taken off it at some point in the last two years. It's not that I don't want to see you happy, it's just that it's strange after so long. You're not going off the deep end are you? Or doing fairy dust?"
Harry was, for perhaps the first time in his life, pleased to have woken up terribly early. A glance at the pocket watch on Draco's chest (and Herbert the dragon adorably fast asleep and snoring beneath it) told him it was only just past six, which would give him plenty of time to firecall Ron and Hermione (
Harry grabbed another hors d'oeuvre and sat back. So far, New Years Eve had been pretty chill. Rodya was welcoming and not at all starstruck, as promised. Much of the time had been spent with the four of them just eating and chatting aimlessly — and, of course, paying attention to Bartholomew.

"So I was out Christmas shopping earlier after St. Mungo's, and it got me thinking about what you had said a few days ago about not really having anybody. And I just thought...maybe you'd like to come with me to the Weasley's for Christmas on Wednesday?"

as much.
"What's, er, what's up with you?"
He tilted the paper so that Harry could see the front page.
Harry sighed, pushing his hand under the collar of Draco's robes to trace lazy circles on his back with his fingers.
Draco nodded and Harry squeezed his hand, pulling him closer and turning on the spot.
"Will you drop the act Harry? There's no way you're that angry all the time — I get it, you want us to leave you alone, we

"Yes?"

"Yeah, I don't plan on dying," he finally said softly, "but I'm still not staying locked in the fucking flat if I don't have an
Ron rolled his eyes. "I dunno mate, like I said before, he seems pretty into you. I really don't think you'll be ruining any holidays."
"Not if I can help it." Harry took the book and tossed it behind him onto the couch. He placed his hands gently on Draco's hips, and stepped forward so they stood cheek to cheek.
"Alright at the top of the stairs come gather 'round," the prefect shouted to the First Years still climbing the stairs below.
"Plus, when have you ever cared about what other people said about you? People always have something to say and you just ignore it. I mean, half the school thought you had opened the Chamber of Secrets and you got through that. The Prophet tried to convince the wizarding world that you were insane during Fifth Year and you got through that too. It doesn't matter if they understand.
Harry laughed. "You sound so concerned, just eat."
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Tell that to my poor toes which spent yesterday evening getting repeatedly crushed."
," Draco said, and snorted when Harry wrinkled his nose in distaste.
want to. He was conflicted over pretty much everything involving other people. Which meant the easiest answer was still avoiding everyone.
, and now that we're out of school, we're meant to be, you know, taking things seriously. You can't marry a bloke, so..."
. Now that you mention it..."
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’ll go save Ange, I need to talk to Molly anyway.”
Once they sat back down, they got into a rather pleasant conversation about Malfoy's job and the Muggles he'd encountered and why Harry was working at Zylphia's apothecary. They ended up talking for much longer than either of them had intended, and the conversation branched out into all sorts of odd areas.
"Well
Harry gave him a funny look, but let it go, choosing to continue kissing again.
And now Draco was screaming and moaning underneath him, as Harry came inside him. He saw white and collapsed beside Draco. After several long moments of panting and reveling in the aftershocks, Harry became conscious of the stickiness drying on his chest, and looked over at Draco, who was probably quite a bit more uncomfortable as his chest and stomach were covered in his own come, and Harry's was slowly leaking onto the sheets.
If the reporter had really wanted to write an article about Harry being mentally unwell, they could surely dig up
"He's gorgeous," Harry said, tracing a hand over its back. He looked back up at Draco. "Does he have a name?"
Draco sighed. "I don't have much of a choice if we want them to ever catch on, do I?"
; and Ginny was back in the swing of the Quidditch season, and bound to be spending every spare moment with her girlfriends. And he really didn't think this was a conversation to be had by
"Good." Draco paused as he sipped his tea. "I'm really glad that we finally got Luna. I love having a family with you."
Draco rubbed a hand across him through his boxers, mouthing at his waistband, then slowly slipped his underwear down, careful to keep it from catching on Harry's cock. He backed off slightly and stroked a careful hand over the silky skin, making Harry groan and close his eyes.
her some more...pain medicine."
Harry brushed past the reporters and ducked into the nearest shop.
With that cheerful thought in mind, he set about looking through the cabinets and fridge for something that remotely resembled dinner.
"How did things go with your coworkers?" he asked, stroking his thumb soothingly over Herbert the dragon tattoo, who was waving his tail lazily over Draco's thigh, basking in the attention.
"Your
Harry got up and ran a hand through his hair, trying to think of how to find Ginny. He quickly washed his face and got dressed, deciding that the common room was at least a place to start. As he headed toward the dormitory door, however, Neville walked into the room.
Actually, he wasn't quite sure
"Draco, please fucking kiss me properly," Harry said desperately, and Draco finally complied. He felt lightheaded, as if there wasn't enough air, but instead of seeing it as a reason to pull back and breathe deeply, he ignored it and kissed Harry more fervently. Harry's hips began bucking up erratically into Draco's hand and his own hips increased their speed rolling against Harry's thigh. With a final few emphatic bucks, Harry moaned into Draco's mouth and came. Draco slowly stroked him through it and ceased the movement of his hips on Harry's thigh.
Harry looked up as the door to his office opened and closed softly.
"Fuck," Draco panted.
"Says
Ron scoffed. "Not before threatening to punch him in the throat— you think mum's going to put up a fuss if I don't wear last year's jumper? She's bound to be giving me another one in a few hours anyway."
As he walked back to the Great Hall, he remembered that he had no idea what classes he had today. Students leaving for their first classes began to pass him and he quickened his pace.
Harry kicked him in the ankle under the table.
"You're one of my best friends, and they'd have to meet you at some point, because I really like you and I don't plan on going anywhere. And anyway, they don't
"Maybe you could start with what kinds of thoughts they are exactly?"
"Is it really ten already?" he asked Malfoy, interrupting him mid-sentence.
"All of you stay here and look over the notes or something," he said quickly before grabbing Harry's arm and rushing down the hall.
Draco looked up at the clock on the wall and sighed. "Got fourteen minutes left on my break. Think we've got enough time for a chip shop run?"
"You heathen."
"You can — I'd say it's doing you good — but I know when someone's holding something back from me."
"He's like eighty. I mean,
the question was how to sort out his thoughts, because strangely, she had changed some of them.
Draco stumbled slightly.

Harry had only been able to see ends and pieces of most of the tattoos as they stuck out of Draco's shirt, but he wished he could see them completely — the moving ones especially. The only completely visible wizarding one was a Snitch, and that had only been visible intermittently, as it seemed to flit about wherever it pleased. The Dark Mark, however had been plainly visible. Although it was faded and resembled an old, faintly reddened scar, it was clearly visible through the tattooed flowers that surrounded and intertwined with it. The piece altogether made a hauntingly pretty picture, in Harry's opinion.
"And stop fucking using my given name like we're buddies or you've ever fucking used it before last night, or like you even know jack shit about who I am!" Draco yelled, finally finishing lacing his boots and standing.
"It was automatic, it just came out— I wasn't thinking! I'm

. He wouldn't do that with an orange or a pink rose petal."
"I'm reasonably sure I didn't have all this stuff just lying around my kitchen?" he finally said, trying to steer the conversation away from all the things Harry never got to experience because everybody around him had died too soon.
"No." Harry scuffed his foot against the floor in front of the counter, and twisted the ends of his scarf in his hands. "Just…I'm just stupid and I'm gonna mess everything up and—"
"Second Year! I thought you were the heir of Slytherin."

When they first arrived at the Burrow on Christmas Eve, things were a little awkward. Most of them didn't know how to act around Draco. Honestly, when he'd first written Molly, she had been hesitant, but he had patiently explained the situation. Eventually, she had said that she would be more than happy to have Draco if it would make Harry happy, and that she would talk to the others for him.
"Hm. Chocolates count for a lot, but not everything."
Draco snorted quietly, unable to stop himself from making an inappropriate joke twice in a row. "Yeah you do. Like a goddamn pony," Draco said reverently in Harry's ear, and Harry choked on his hot chocolate as Ron obliviously chattered on.
grown, and he really did make Harry happier than he'd ever been. And if it could only be temporary, or strictly as friends, then so be it.
"Harry!" She did a full-body flop straight onto the sofa on top of him. "Where is everybody?" She asked, mouth still full of crumbs. Although she hated being told it, sometimes Harry thought she was so much like Ron.
"Shite." Well now he felt kind of bad for threatening violence. But he really wasn't responsible for things he said when half-asleep.
"You know, Christmas is coming up," he said idly, as he lightly tugged on a lock of Harry's hair. He let it spring back, and watched in amusement as it went straight back to a ridiculous half-curl that had the end pointing straight up from his head.
The words beat at Harry's lips, but he swallowed them back. Two more days. Two more days, and then he could tell him without ruining New Years.
Draco — and it was so
"You could come back down and join me."
Harry just nudged his hand again with his face, and he was closing his eyes in contentment as the petting resumed, when something about Draco's expression changed. His eyes lit up with a trademark mischievous grin that Harry had learnt to be wary of. He closed his eyes regardless; he'd also learnt there was nothing he could do to weasel out what was going through that mind or to stop whatever plan was forming.
"I can't feel my body," Harry whispered.
"I love you," Harry sighed against his lips.
I've been doing."

Ron wrinkled his nose. "He always seemed a bit...pointy."
Draco swiped a finger through the cream cheese frosting on his red velvet cake. "Oh dear, I'm so clumsy," he said sarcastically. "Help me clean this off, will you?" He tilted his hand toward Harry's face, elbow resting on the table.
"I'm sorry," Draco whispered, staring at the ground. "I'm sorry, Harry."
"Time for class."
. I wonder what lovely witch he's secretly been dating?' Honestly."
"No. Shall we just...walk around Diagon Alley or something?"
Harry shrugged, sitting down cross-legged on the floor. "Yeah, just excited to finally be moving in."
"Erm...hi."

Draco sighed and opened his eyes, sitting up slightly to make more clear grabby hands, and Harry looked at him questioningly.

Harry took a drink and set it down on the table, smiling as well.
Well, at second glance, he could see that Harry was in control. But still.

Harry saw Charlie visibly relax at being left out of the relationship conversation, and he tipped his glass at him. Charlie smiled and tipped his glass back.
Draco sighed deeply. It was going to be a

"Harry?" Draco walked out of the back room and stopped short. "What are you doing here?"
, he was just very tired of fantasy games suddenly.
Draco shook his head. "Go get dressed so we can go make out on some old person's lawn. That'd make things clear I bet."
"Oh dear, I hope I didn't hear that correctly," Hermione responded drily.
True to his theory, it didn't take long for Harry's body to tip over to being submerged in pleasure. And hard and pleasurable things stayed, right through the end. Harry couldn't quite tell whether he was still somehow riding his orgasm, or whether everything was just so good he hadn't felt it fade, then Draco thrust in hard and Harry felt him come.
"Yeah." He smoothed a hand over Harry's hair.  "Yeah, we're fine. I was just thinking."
"You know, I had a student tell me today that he was staying over winter hols because I had inspired him to practise more potions."
"No darling, you never do. You worry too much — I didn't say the word, did I?"
"But—"
He yanked the covers up over his lap, and snatched the paper out of the air, staring down at the front page for a few moments. Harry idly noticed Herbert snapping playfully at the starlings swooping over Draco's stomach, but looked up quickly when Draco turned the paper around to him with a snap.
"Wear Muggle clothes," Draco suggested with a grin. "You want to cause a ruckus, right?"
Ginny elbowed him lightly in the ribs, and leant her head back on his good shoulder. "Fuck off! Now tell me about this whole thing with Malfoy. How in the hell did
“Enjoy your weekend,” she waved, and Harry and Draco headed out onto the street.

"Good. Good, just keep moving."
Draco had yet to realise that a Daily Prophet reporter had just been given the biggest break of her life by stopping by the Leaky after work. She was sitting at a table near the bar when she heard the bartender speak, and had whipped out a Quick Quotes Quill, which was now scribbling furiously. Draco
Draco knew it was ridiculous to feel jealous. He and Harry weren't even really together, so it certainly wasn't his place; and it wasn't really his business whether Harry and Ginevra were just close friends or still interested in each other.
"Well, what did you discover?"
Nearly-Headless Nick in particular had always seemed to be lingering around in the corridors whenever Harry and Draco were having a conversation during the winter holidays that year, and he'd scarcely let up since. Much to Draco's chagrin, the Fat Friar had seemed to join in more often than not this year — although Harry insisted there was nothing strange at all about it.
"Wait, Harry!"
Harry merely stroked Draco's back soothingly with one hand, and ran his fingers through his hair with the other, knowing they would fall asleep soon regardless. Draco pressed a kiss to Harry's chest, and was snoring lightly within minutes.
He looked over at Ginny, who was idly flicking her bottom lip as she stared vacantly at the back of the tapestry. Thinking that she seemed pretty absorbed in her own thoughts, Harry decided against asking her about the whole situation. Bothering her would be unkind after she had gone out of her way to be so nice to him.
Draco nodded and toyed with his croissant, ripping it slowly apart. "I do, but I miss it. I don't really have any friends to go back to, but it's just...

It would at least be something for Draco to remember when this was over soon. This may very well be their last date; he may as well try to make it worth it.
Harry sighed and loosened his arms. He felt Draco drop a kiss on top of his head and slip out of the bed. Harry rolled over onto his back and thought how strange it was how quickly things could come to seem normal. At some point over the months this had just become the norm. Harry wasn't actually even sure if Draco had been to his own flat in over a month.
"I love her to bits, but—" she burst into giggles again, and wiped her watering eyes. "Whew."
Harry was at a bit of a loss. Everything felt surreal suddenly.
"Um. Sorry. Use a warming charm?"
"Shh," Draco whispered, and half-assedly covered Harry's face with his hand. "Sleep."
The war was over. It had been for seven years, and people needed to learn to put these things behind them. The people who deserved to be punished had been, and everyone else should just be allowed to live their lives. Weren't there enough things to for people to worry about without adding more resentment to their plates?
"Oh come on, don't get mad," Harry said, still laughing, as Draco leaned back in a huff. He reached up to pull Draco's head back down, and pressed a kiss to his jaw. "I'm just taking the piss. I love you."
"How suggestive?" Harry murmured back.

When Christmas Day arrived, he awoke to a giant package from Mrs. Weasley at the foot of his bed. She had, true to form, included a hand-knitted jumper and an array of sweets, including several mince pies. Harry decided it was worth it to make himself sick by eating four for breakfast.
"Thanks, dad," he said yet again.

what Harry wanted to do. And then Slughorn had shot Harry a simpering consolatory smile every time he didn't know the answer or got it wrong.

"No, no it's fine really. I didn't mean you, I'm just still a bit nervous is all."
"Okay. Goodnight then."

Draco backed up a bit and broke away slightly to mutter, "Should probably get more in front of the window," before Harry was kissing him again. And then suddenly the crowd of reporters outside was the last thing Draco was thinking about, caught up in the feeling of Harry against him — focusing on the feel of his lips and how he felt under Draco's hands as he slid a hand down his chest and over his back.

"Fancy a look 'round Flourish and Blotts?" Harry asked, not letting go of Draco's hand.
He took another bite and tried to pay attention to the flavours and think about them to make sure he was chewing for a while, but there just wasn't much to think of in the way of sandwich flavours. Harry thought his body should really have been used to this, what with the way the Dursleys had kept him from meals and had subjected them to Dudley's diet and such. Although, he
"Nice. I have a feeling this isn't even the beginning, but be sure not to leave out the fact that neither of them were fully clothed. Professor Potter was clutching that robe way too tightly to have been wearing much under it."
"Great. I'm gonna write an anonymous letter to the Prophet that I have 'inside info' that the famous Harry Potter is moving house." He rolled out of bed and stretched.
. Ridiculous.
George hugged him tightly.
"It's different, and you know that Harry. Just...do some thinking. Come and talk to me when you have."

Harry was taken-aback by the level of suspicion, but he supposed it might be a good thing that the man cared enough to be wary of anyone asking for Draco, considering he probably knew Draco was undocumented. "Oh, erm, my name's Harry. I just—"
Harry grinned.
I did some horrible things, but I lost
Harry gave a choked laugh. "Oh Merlin, let's stick with jeans."
"Let's just Apparate."

want to have to obliviate his coworkers. Or at least, that was the concern he was trying to keep his brain focused on. He tried to ignore his heart hammering in his chest.
"Perhaps you need some more time subject to me rather than this set up," he gestured to Draco on top of him.
Ugh. They were here to
He lay there thinking it all through, making estimations for those he wasn't sure of, and deciding how to pay: pain, of course. He decided he could pay for one life a day, depending on who they were; some lives may take more than one. Harry welcomed the wax as it began to drip down from the top of his bed curtains. Basking in the deserved misery, his brain flooded him with the scathing voices of several of those close to him who had been murdered, of Voldemort, and of several Death Eaters all accusing him of being careless and callous, and only thinking of saving himself.
stop making digs at each other, and asking about Harry's personal life and the war; it was an absolute nightmare. He'd had to resort to taking ten points for every time someone talked out of turn just to get them to shut up.

Neville spotted the three Fifth Years lurking down the hall and cleared his throat.
"Fine," he said aloud exasperatedly, as he pulled the shrunken object from his coat pocket and restored it to its normal size. He had had Hermione put an undetectable extension charm on it, and had proceeded to throw everything haphazardly in. Unfortunately, he was now realising that might not have been the best idea, as he had to now get everything out and put them in their proper places.

Harry had succumbed almost completely to sensation because, well, it had been a
"You're going up to bed?"
Draco’s expression hadn’t outwardly changed, but his eyes were gleaming. “Harry,” he said, trying to keep the laughter from his voice. “
"Yes, well Draco exaggerates when he's angry," Harry said curtly. "Now if I could begin my lesson, today we’ll be talking about Boggarts."
"That wasn't confetti, it was rose petals, and they were different colours. Different colours mean different things, but I'm not sure exactly what. There was definitely some red, which I think is just love. And then Professor Potter was only using his left hand, so I think they were holding hands or something—"
good." Draco began to kiss over his jaw, down his throat. He twisted his fingers in Harry's hair, pulling his head back, and Harry gave a breathy sigh, digging his fingers into Draco's thighs.
Maybe he could just walk into the back along the wall without them noticing. He took a tentative step. He'd read somewhere that part of being unnoticed was confidence that nobody could see you—
surprised for once.
"Potter? Are you okay?" asked a hesitant voice. Harry had a sinking feeling he knew who that voice belonged to.
He got up, and opened the door a bit apprehensively, unsure as to who would be knocking at his door. The only people who knew where he lived would surely firecall.
"Okay, now we just have to find these in our notes. I already looked up sunflower, since we knew that one. Then I looked it up in a book too to see if it was more specific. Professor Longbottom just said loyalty, but look at what this says." A Hufflepuff boy held out a book and pointed to the bottom of the page.

"Real early too," Dean chimed in, rubbing his face as he finally rolled out of bed.
"Yeah?"
“Always wanted to do that,” he said with a grin. “Now let’s hear the Best Man speech! Harry?”
"Thanks Nev," Ron grinned tiredly.
"Any particular reason why you're here?"

He was met with more silence, and eyes looking everywhere but at him.
"Stop flattering me," Harry complained. "I just did what I had to. I was trying to channel

"Yeah," Harry laughed.
any of the other personas he'd taken on. But, whatever he said, he had to appear casual in front of Draco.
"Just what? What can I do?"
Still, it made something inside his chest glow a little warmer to have Harry paying close attention to him and caring about his comfort.
“I’m no expert, but I’m sensing an
Harry awoke to the realisation that sleeping in his robes was not a good idea. He quickly showered, rubbing at the lines his robes and pillow had left on his face. He couldn't be late on his first day, and he
forgive him, it would probably take some time. And, of course, their relationship would never be the same again.
Draco looked doubtful. “How am I supposed to do that?”
Harry looked as if he'd just gotten a scolding from Mrs. Weasley. Which, he realised, he had in a sense — Mrs.
," Harry said frustratedly. "And—" he cut himself off, turning back to look toward the bedroom as he heard the door open. "Oh, crap, I think he's awake now."
There was a moment of silence as they continued to eat their ice cream, and Harry watched as Draco's Snitch tattoo fluttered around the top of his neck. He cleared his throat.
He couldn't wait until the first of September.

breakfast," he said, shoving a forkful of eggs into his own mouth. "And I'm not going to go find the tongs."
Harry hummed contentedly and obediently dropped back off into unconsciousness. Draco shut his eyes too, but he quickly realised his brain was wide awake and there was no chance of him getting back to sleep now.
The Fourth Year Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs in both Professor Potter and Professor Longbottom's class filled in those who hadn't taken Herbology during lunch. The only problem now was that somebody had to go in and identify what the flowers were. There had definitely been sunflowers, but there had also been others. Eventually a Gryffindor volunteered.
He turned and picked up his trunk, cradling it to his body as he walked toward his classroom. The poor thing probably had about ten broken items in it now.

By Sunday morning, all of Draco's peace with the idea that things couldn't get any worse seemed to have flown out the window. Harry thought he probably should have seen that coming.
Harry was sorely tempted to take the Hogwarts Express.
"I'm not going to tell anyone—"
"Why?" Harry demanded.
"You're still a twat," Draco grumbled. "But I love you too." There. He'd said it. When Harry was awake and everything.
"Should the Minister for Magic really be swearing in front of her employees?"
After a few minutes however, there was a bit of a problem. Draco pulled back.
"What are you making faces for?"

oblivious. You may have heard stories but, contrary to popular belief, we knew
Harry handed him the money without comment, and glanced warily out the window at the reporters again. "Any chance you have a Floo I could use?"
"Eloquent," Draco commented.
"Could be. It's nerve-wracking is what it is. I've no idea what they're thinking or planning," he grumbled as he went into the kitchen. He stared into the fridge for a minute, and then pushed it shut. The ink dragon flapped its wings insistently, thrashing its tail and snorting smoke, and Draco poked at it. "Stop that, you."
Even the Weasleys — as much as he loved them — were part of the problem. Sure, they knew he'd fancied boys, but they'd treated it much the same as when Fred and Lee Jordan had had a thing for a while in their younger years at Hogwarts, or Ron's obsession with Viktor Krum. They didn't think anything of it happening, but it wasn't expected to be anything
Professor Ludgor began the lesson and Harry tried to focus his attention on the information rather than his wandering thoughts and oppressive boredom.
"Bartholomew flew back in at some point, and he's just sitting there staring at me. Gonna give me a heart attack someday." He felt an odd need to cover up under the owl's intense stare.
, in fact, wearing Harry's jumper. He regretfully put his cloak back on and fastened it firmly. He guessed he would just have to suffer the heat.
Harry smiled and thought it was maybe possible he could become a morning person. He put his hand over the newspaper to steal Draco's attention.
Well, clearly all of Draco's posh upbringing hadn't disappeared, Harry thought as he listened to Draco's stiffly formal and long winded proposal.
Draco woke up some time in the wee hours of the morning to a kick in the shin.
"You're joking. Please tell me you woke me up in the middle of the night to play a joke so I can castrate
"Doesn't really matter," Harry replied between kisses. Draco squeezed his hand, and Harry moaned.
This continued on, with Harry half wanting to defend himself but also knowing that he deserved it, until Ron jerked open Harry's bed curtains.

"Okay, what if I
"Yes, actually. Minerva found this object in one of the store cupboards in the dungeons.” He held up an oddly shaped glass figure, wrapped in cloth to keep Draco’s skin from coming in contact. “Don't ask me why she was there, but it's radiating dark magic, and she figured you would be the best person for the job. I'm afraid I couldn't remember all of the necessary identification and nullification charms."
He huffed and got off the sofa, hoping to turn his mind elsewhere. Perhaps he could do a little potions work.
He carefully pulled out and set Draco down, cleaning them both off with a wave of his hand.

"I can't."

to it. He felt Harry still fucking up into him, and he could feel his own hand still on his cock, stroking out the last of his orgasm. Through his haze, he felt Harry finally spill his release inside him, and moaned again, leaning back limply against the tree trunk.
He paused in the doorway when he arrived. Draco was concentrating hard on a cauldron, which he was stirring very precisely.
Draco turned onto his hands and knees, and shivered when he felt Harry's protection spells wash over him. "It should be easier this way. Go slow."
"Not professionally, but I did rather well on my O.W.L.s"
"Yes. Soon, I promise."

"I don't wanna go in," Harry groaned. "Let's just stay in bed and never leave."

Later, when Harry was continuing to fulfill his Neville-prescribed pondering requirement, he realised something. That heart flutter. That was not good.
She made a hasty retreat back to the living room, and Harry and Draco stared at each other.
"Nnnh, you
tell you talking to reporters would only end in misery."
"Hmm?"
Draco squirmed out of his robes and collapsed onto the small bed on the right side of the room, and Harry got in beside him, settling the quilt over them.
"Harry, it's the most logical explanation."
"Sunday it is, then. Probably best to avoid the hoopla of the final night and such — although the opening probably won't be much better. Have you got any formal robes?"
As soon as he walked into his office, he was confronted with Ron sitting on his desk.
He stopped to give her a look usually reserved for those who are absolutely, irredeemably raving mad.
to go back in to the shop today anyway, but
Confused by the light, drawling voice, the bartender looked up to see Draco staring at him. He then saw that Harry's seat was empty. He spoke hesitantly, suddenly unsure of himself.
"Were you taking notes?" Draco asked drily.
"Don't mock me, I could
"Yeah, I think my students would be thrilled with that. Me constantly cross, looking like an inferi, barely coherent just because I stayed up every night to shag."
"What." It was supposed to be a question, but it came out more like a statement.
"Professor Malfoy, what happened?"
"Hm. I don't think you were listening though."
He felt his Snitch tattoo darting over his stomach in what Draco would

"Hey, I wasn't expecting to see you lot here today," Draco greeted. "Glad to see everyone around Baule Row has gotten used to Harry forgetting his glamours, too," he couldn't help adding. Really, Harry was just so brazenly careless sometimes.
It wasn't, though. There
Harry snorted. "Not nearly. I went grocery shopping once I got home and saw you were asleep, so obviously not going to cook."
"I see."
"Fuck." Harry looked down at him, and slowly laid back down. "Sorry," he said. And then again, "Fuck."

There were still a few whispers, but Draco was mostly satisfied that he had terrified them enough to keep quiet.

"None that I know of."
"How're you doing? You seem a little...off."
"More importantly, I'm not going to waste this delicious cake," Draco said, moving back to hold Harry's hand, giving it a squeeze.
Tell me, Harry, have you ever tried to take a shower using warming charms? It's just freezing your arse off with the occasional spot of warmth, so no, I'm not going to use a bloody
Harry sighed. "Yeah, did you want some?"
"Oi, Harry! I thought I heard you come in,” Ron shouted, coming in from the back yard, and making his way across the room to hug him. “Malfoy,” he nodded at Draco, before turning back to Harry. “Me, Bill, and Charlie were setting up to play some Quidditch in the back, want in? ‘Mione and Fleur are out there too.”
"Good." Draco pushed out the back door, without checking that Harry was behind him, and Harry followed behind feeling slightly lost.
"Oh that is very lovely ring! Where did you get that?" Draco unconsciously tensed when he realised Rodya was talking to him and staring at the jade ring on his index finger.

"Indeed, Zylphia," a low drawling voice replied. "It's nice to see you. I'll admit I'm a bit starved for kind eyes at the moment."
There was no way around it. He was going to have to tell Ron and Hermione.
"Do you really want to sit here and talk about this instead of doing more, I don't know, pleasurable things with the time?"
Nearly a year later, one Saturday in November, they used the floo in the Headmistress's office and left to get married between lunch and dinner. It was as simple as that. It was very small, with only the Weasleys (all thirteen of them, now that Ron and Hermione had had two children), Hagrid, Neville and Hannah, Andromeda, and Teddy in attendance. It had been outdoors and the weather was absolutely lovely. Harry didn't think he'd ever experienced a happier moment.
Harry felt Draco squeeze his hand. “Hmm?”
Harry didn't appear to notice, sending his dishes into the kitchen with a flick of his hand, and following Ron and Hermione into the sitting room.
When the desserts started appearing, Draco picked up one of the salmon coloured petals and held it up, raising one eyebrow again at Harry.
She paid him absolutely no mind — settling back in behind the counter, and directing her attention to what seemed to be accounting books. Harry wasn't sure how she was reading the tiny, cramped writing that filled every spare millimetre of the page, as she traced her knotted brown fingers across the lines, but it was clear that he was no longer of any concern.

"No. I guess I just assumed you would be going home."
"On the floor?" Draco asked, his distaste obvious.
"Oh good! I thought you went ahead without me too," Ron bounded up to Hermione, then noticed Harry and gave him an uncertain smile.
