Malfoy raised the cup to his lips and stared at the dark liquid for a moment before taking a sip. “His name is Sawyer, Sawyer Green.” He took another sip and then put the cup down on the table.
“She seemed pretty sure,” Harry said. “Maybe Malfoy came out here during his downtime.” He pretended to be very interested in eating his sandwich while Atkison crinkled his cup in his hands.
When Harry came back downstairs, dressed in comfortable denims and a faded shirt, Teddy and Draco were seated at the table. Teddy was kicking his legs while Draco asked him about the alphabet. Harry took his seat on the other side and gave them both a smile. Draco swallowed and looked down.
Harry watched them disappear, stomach sinking and just knowing he had royal fucked everything up. And he hadn’t even gotten to see Draco.
“For Christsake.” Draco dragged his hands through his hair and thought of Harry, still sleeping on his bed, the way it had felt to wake up next to another warm body. “I don’t need this.” He turned to Andromeda. “I’m going back to the flat.”
McKenna pulled out vials and scraped bits of the remains inside a set, then started on the ground around them, looking for any trace of the perpetrator.
But the concept is not so. It's rousing, stirring, and thrilling. The idea of doing it with an older man is giving him sensations his body's beginning to love. It's much more mature, more experienced and hopefully, Draco would be breathtakingly fucked once he gets him to his bed.
Harry raised an eyebrow and he continued, "The witch that comes for the weekly massage sometimes finishes late so I may not able to call her, Harry" he faked a pout and Harry had to restrain himself.
He pulled his fingers out and deftly unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans and when Draco looked down, he was right, Harry have gone commando. If he was still as confident as probably centuries ago, he would’ve smirk at him but he was just so desperate to be filled to the brim, to be fucked in a way they haven’t before.
One decent person cannot surely handle a lot of riotous bunch of witches and wizards. They are just the whole new definition of wildness.
When they arrived, Harry immediately let go of him and opened the door. Draco pouted a little and walk inside. He kind of enjoyed his arm around him and lean on his body. Why is apparition so fast? They should last long as an hour or more.
“How’s my baby girl?” he asked and stood inches away from her. Before she could even answer, he dipped his head low and gave her a kiss on the lips,
Harry raised a hand, contemplating for a second because he never lay a hand without consent but when Draco’s lips parted and how his eyes dilated for a moment. He knows he will win soon.
He stopped when he encountered another door when he rounded the right wing of the huge house. So the apartment he’s staying in must be a cover then. Of course with all those payments he saw from the drive, that man is living lavishly in secret.
She didn’t feel like this ever. She had a kiss back then with her friend, Blaise Zabini, but it felt nothing like it did with Harry’s. Her right hand unclasped from his hair to rest at Harry’s chest, the hard muscles pushing in the sleeves he was wearing and almost as if they were roaring as Dracy’s palms landed on them.
“You’re so fucking hot, baby. Always so hot for daddy. Wanna fuck you so bad. Show everyone how easily I can bare you in my hands. So desperate and slut for daddy and daddy only”
“Got you, sweetheart” Harry pushed the panties aside before his tongue lick a wet swipe up to his perineum to his cute little balls.
From one side, he’s bright and the other, dark. He has his sun but he’s also his moon. She’s not sure if she’s using the right words to describe the man who alone made his name across Wizarding World but she’s using her words like how she’s seeing him.
“You think people want to talk about their Werewolf relatives? Even if they hadn’t cut them out? And then you’re forgetting all the muggles that were turned. You have to count them too.” He finished off his bacon. “When I say you don’t know Pack, I’m not exaggerating. There’s so much about it you don’t know.”
Harry scowled, but there wasn’t much else he could do. He slipped, mostly intentionally, from the stool and only stumbled twice on his way to the door. After that, he made a very poor attempt to find the internet cafe and got lost twice before taking out his wand and casting a not at all discreet Point Me.
Draco was sitting on his bed and trying not to laugh. “Of course! You’d be the most popular at the club. Everyone would want to dance with you.”
They found a table in the corner, and Ron got a round of drinks while Luna poked Neville until he grudgingly got up to dance. Harry sat at the table by himself and tried not to see the girl in the alley.
Draco recognized her I-have-had-enough-of-your-nonsense expression, scowled at the floor, and said darkly, “Nope, damage already done.”
“It’s not him,” Harry growled, suddenly and fiercely angry. The very idea that she would say that boiled in his stomach and his fingers itched for his wand. “He wouldn’t do that.”
“That sounds lovely.” She gave him a big smile. “I’ll send you a memo when I know what time I might be available.”
“Someone has taken money out of my son’s account.” She folded her hands over the edge of the table and didn’t touch the tea service Harry had set out for her before her arrival.
Malfoy shook his head, eyes still locked on her. “I only met her once, and never when she was shifted.” He paused. “She asked about my Mark, asked if I carried it with me into the shift. Daisy had a birthmark on her back,” his hands found the circles, “of a flower. Her parents named her Daisy after it.”
This felt like a raid, an undercover op where Draco was meeting with the suspect trying to get information, and Harry was the backup waiting for the wands to come out. He was nervous and anxious to get inside and see what was happening. Eventually, the minutes counted down, and Harry opened the door.
“These look very interesting?” Luis leaned over the vials. “But we certainly won’t be needing that feather,” he tutted and Draco heard the mocking in his tone.
Malfoy gave him a grin, wild and fierce and just the littlest bit alluring. Suddenly, Harry could see what he must have looked like to Sawyer, young and free and ready to live. And Harry wondered what it would be like to run the streets of West End with Malfoy instead of Val, what would it be like to ride the tube and dash in and out of little alcoves and alleys, hands never still, hearts pounding. Would Malfoy know all the little secret places, the best place for chips, the out of the way pubs? What would it be like to dance with him in the clubs, to have his hand draped possessively over Harry’s shoulder?
And then Harry thought about what he wanted. He wanted to put Sirius’s motorcycle back together, and he wanted to finish fixing up Grimmauld Place. He wanted to go to the Port on weekends and listen to Sophie complain about childcare, and watch Evan watch Tilly, and drink Fire Whiskeys with Ron. He wanted to hang around until closing time and follow Draco back to his flat, wanted to push Draco up against his door fast and then kiss him slow.
So he marched down the pavement, this time with purpose until he reached the shop, with its jingling bell and it’s busy customers and
Hughes reached out to study the picture. “She’s quite a pretty little thing, isn’t she?” And then he did something with the picture that Harry couldn’t see over the hutch on the reception desk. “I’ll get this sent out. In the meantime, let me find you some addresses. Any idea where in London she might have gone?”
Harry looked at Draco and considered the options. There was a bit of panic in Malfoy’s expression, in his flushed cheeks and heaving chest. He must have run all this way. And that was that decision made, Harry got out his own portkey. “Well, are you coming with?”
Malfoy growled again, not angry, but low and heady. “There it is,” he said, face pressed so tightly to his shoulder that Malfoy’s nose was practically in Harry’s armpit. He ran his hands down the length of Harry’s arms, pushed them up over his head and ground himself fiercely against Harry.
Malfoy threw away the last of the vegetables. “Thank you.” And then he stood awkwardly in the kitchen as if he didn’t know what else to do.
It was still early, not much after 10pm, and so they made their way slowly towards Thirst. The bar was brightly lit when they arrived, and no line to get in. Harry paid the cover this time, made a mental note to add it to his expense report. The room was reasonably full, but not packed like Harry had come to expect from these places on a Friday night. It was also brightly lit with a moderate noise level. It looked more like a place for professional outings or sophisticated events then a wild night out on the town.
“No, sir. Just him.” Harry’s tongue felt slow and stupid in his mouth, and Harry was pretty sure he should be saying something about the girl who had escaped out the door. But then Savage levered a shoulder under his arm and hauled him upright causing his stomach to roll threateningly again and all Harry could think about was trying not to vomit on her boots.
“I shared my ambitions with you last week.” Astoria led him down the hall. “This is the ballroom, and across the hall you’ve seen the drawing room. I think you’ve always been very ambitious, and I think your experiences have not lessened that, but perhaps they have made you more cautious.”
“Uh,” Draco laughed hesitantly. “About two years ago, I guess. We were at this party at the University, and she was hiding from Greyback in the loo.”
Harry jerked straight up in his chair, eyes squinting against the sudden brightness of the room. “What?”
Astoria gave him a critical look over her glass, and Blaise grinned. “At least it was short,” Wilkinson defended it.
“Yeah.” Ron clapped Harry on the shoulder. “She insisted we leave forty-five minutes early just in case we got lost.”
Harry reached a hand across the counter and rubbed his fingers across Draco’s knuckles. “That’s a good thing.”
Malfoy didn’t look at Harry, but Harry saw his throat move as he swallowed hard. “Ask me no questions, and I will tell you no lies,” he repeated, pushing the eggs onto a plate.”
Andromeda shrugged and pulled the shepherd's pie from the oven. “They were supposed to come by at 3pm, but claimed the Fidelius charm prevented them from coming inside.”
Harry wiped his hands on his trousers, certain he couldn’t look nearly as good sucking on his own fingers as Draco had. Although, based on the way Malfoy was looking at him, eyes half lidded and panting, he really didn’t need to worry about how he looked.
It wasn’t terribly late, just after seven, so he turned on the TV and sat down on the sofa with his files. After all week of Malfoy being everywhere in the apartment and all day being surrounded by loving Weasleys, it was nice to be alone at home.
“Aren’t you a greedy thing,” Draco said, not changing the pace at all. “Couldn’t stand that guy’s hands on you. Wanted everyone to know your mine.” He moaned loudly, circling his hips.
Standing brought all the blood rushing back to Harry’s legs, and they threatened to buckle underneath him. “Oh shit. I think I sat too long.”
So, I probably should have put this in the first chapter notes, but I totally forgot. This story is finished. It has nine chapters and an epilogue, and I will be posting one to two chapters per week. I will post chapter 9 and the epilogue at the same time.
They went through the food quick, the way those with a high metabolism do, and Jude settled himself more comfortably and dug the phone out of his pocket and began fiddling with it. Harry was pretty sure Jude was going to need another one before too long, if last summer had been anything to go by. The residual magic took a bit to get through the tough case and screen protector, but it would eventually find its way inside and destroy the circuitry.
“It’s going to be fine,” he said, mostly into her curly hair, and she snuffled against him. “I’ll sort out the closet tomorrow, and it’ll be great. Yeah?”
Draco hit the bed hard, no longer stretched tight, but arms a loose halo around his head, hands close enough to the pillow to touch. And Harry put a knee on the bed, rocked it up to watch Draco buck and flail. He put his hands back on that shirt slowly working it up, baring that beautiful, tight stomach that quivered and trembled under Harry’s gentle touch. He pulled the shirt up higher, revealing pecs and nipples already tight and demanding to be put in Harry’s mouth. But other than a brush with his thumb, Harry ignored them in favor of getting that shirt up higher, tangled around Draco’s arms above his head.
Tilly leaned against him, rested her head on his shoulder. “You aren’t that person any more.” She held out the pint of double fudge.
They both stood there for a moment, Draco too shocked to sneer and Harry--well, Harry couldn’t stop looking, looking at the way his robes hung loosely from his thin shoulders, at his narrow, determined gaze, the tight clench of his hands. And Harry realized that Ron was absolutely right to worry about what Harry would do. Because Malfoy was definitely up to something.
And Hermione sighed loudly and rolled her eyes up at the ceiling. “I do know how to do this. Better than you I might add.”
“Alright.” Harry turned around and made his way back down to the kitchen, making note of the dust in the corners and the worn look of the wooden floors. But Harry didn’t know how to fix any of that, who to call or how to maintain it once it had been repaired.
Malfoy put his cup down, crossed his legs, draped his arm along the back of the booth. He looked away as he spoke, “I thought they should hear about Sawyer from someone who loved him.”
“You must have a boyfriend, or girlfriend, to lend you a helping hand.” Malfoy sat up and rubbed his head.
“Really?” Ron demanded. “How is it that you walk into one store and find the ring with no fuss, no muss
“Cut them some slack, Malfoy.” Harry plopped into the chair next to him. “They just haven’t seen this many good looking people at one table in a while.”
Harry looked down at the form, at the strange letters that formed even stranger sentences giving one man near complete control over another. Some time in the last year and a half, Atkinson had stolen Draco’s magic. And really, wasn’t that motivation for theft? Revenge? One item taken as recompense for another? Harry fell into his chair. How had he not seen it before?
It was why Harry wanted to take him to the Burrow. He wanted to show Draco what it was like to be part of a big family, to interact with the chaos, to get sucked into it and whirl around and around until it spat you back out all covered in smiles. He just knew that Draco would love the experience.
“Well, thank you.” Harry paused, feeling a bit awkward. He and Sarah really didn’t have much in common, other than the mint chocolate chip.
And back around again. It would mean leaving New York, possibly giving up his experiments and Roxi and the progress that he had made. It would mean giving up the life he had created for himself completely by himself. It would mean facing years of scorn and derision. And while people in New York hated him, it was because they were New Yorkers and Draco was an asshole, it wasn’t because of horrible life changing mistakes he had made as a child. It wasn’t because of horrible life changing decisions his parents made. It was because Draco was Draco and New York was New York.
“That’s not a very flattering description of your friend.” Harry felt a little badly they hadn’t mounted a defense.
Draco looked at the coded page, ran his fingers over the ink. This was a page he’d written in code (After he’d discovered Armand reading the journal on the couch, it had taken Draco several weeks to develop it).  Harry’s wedding day. He ran his hand lovingly across the page, mildly overcome with emotion. “Do you remember the first time you made love to your wife, Weasley? Not the first time you had sex, but the first time you made love?”
And then Harry heard the muffled shuffling that came from somewhere to the right. He ducked down slightly, and waited and listened carefully for another hint. He almost missed the slight huff from behind him, and then the smoke lit up in a bright yellow. Harry hit the floor fast as the smoke burned up, he squeezed his eyes tight against the bright light.
Dr. Conners shook his head no, and Harry wrapped a hand around his arm, sidealong him to an interrogation room in the Auror department. Later Robards congratulated Harry on
He slipped it from his pocket and answered very quietly. “Hello.” And then released a large sigh of relief. “Good. That’s good.”
“I guess.” Harry shrugged. “Shacklebolt had his speech writer make something for me. It’s all about coming together and tolerance and healing the old wounds.
“The boy at the end, isn’t alone,” Alice said softly. “He has friends, advisors, people who remember his parents and can tell him stories.”
“You know, most witches and wizards consider the daisy a weed--they only use the roots in their potion making. But, they are incredibly resilient and able to thrive in inhospitable conditions.” She patted his chest gently and then said rather brightly, “Like you.”
Only Ajax was quiet. “And what will we do when we find them? Hand them over to the Ministry who makes our lives so difficult? Who also treats us like mangy dogs only slightly too human to be put down. We cannot be sure they will give us justice.”
Ron met them at reception, and clapped Harry firmly on the shoulder. “Let’s get something from the canteen, I’m starved.”
Life was just not fair, he thought as he curled onto his left side. He had one last thought to hope he didn’t sick-up all over the bed again, and then he fell asleep until it was time to see Teddy.
“Ooh,” sighed the sales clerk. “That is one of my favorites, very subtle with the Ceylon sapphire and the platinum setting. There are diamonds laid into the side, 1.7 carats in total.”
Auror Potter tells me this is the best way to contact you, that if I send an owl I will be in violation of the Statute of Secrecy, and so I suppose I must place my faith in these truly rudimentary mechanisms. You must write to me immediately so that I may know you have received my letter.
And then Potter was at the gate and things were moving at normal pace again. “What the fuck, Malfoy? I let you into my home and you think that gives you an open invitation?!” he shouted.
“You could have just handed me over to Atkinson and closed the case.” Malfoy wrung the shirt in his hands.
He didn’t hear the door chime, but Draco looked up from the soapy water in time to see Harry walk through the front door, hands nervously in his pockets. And Draco smiled, brightly, because that was what he did now when he saw Harry. Several regulars at the bartop twittered.
“Quiet you,” she shushed. “Let me see your chest.” Her hands were quick and light as she undid the buttons of his shirt.
But now his hands went cold and his stomach tight, and he would have drawn back from Neil if he had been able to make his body do anything at all. “You shouldn’t do that.”
Which was how Harry found himself at the Port at 2 in the afternoon, lurking nervously in the doorway and trying to look nonthreatening. Tilly was behind the counter cutting up garnishes; she looked up at the sound on the door and the two of them stared at each other for a moment. Harry was both glad and sad that it wasn’t Draco behind the counter.
“Who could that be?” Andromeda wiped her hands on the dish towel and disappeared down the hall. She left the parlour door open, and Draco could hear her murmuring low into the floo. “I really don’t think this is the time.”
Draco held the door open, and Harry stepped inside. A bored looking blonde girl sat on a high stool behind a counter flicking through a graphic novel. She gave Harry a disinterested look but gave Draco a smile over his shoulder. “Back again?”
Roxi shook her head as if he could see her on the other end of the line. “Nothing, I didn’t find anything. But he was--I think he was afraid of Luis.”
Draco nodded. “It’s so strange to be back here, for things to be so forcefully divided. I’m not used to only being around wizards or only around muggles. It feels wrong.” Draco gave a brief shiver.
“Brill.” Florence wrapped her arms around his, pressing her voluptuous breasts against him. “It’s about that scuffle last week.” And then they were walking out the door.
She startled, narrowed her eyes, and then smiled. “He’s helping. Look.” She pointed through the door at where Draco was leaning next to a young woman trying to sleep in a terribly uncomfortable chair.
“Absolutely,” Molly shooed Harry out. “Go on now, don’t leave them waiting.” She practically shoved him through the door. “Now, you lot leave him alone about this boy. It’s his business, and he’ll tell us about it when he’s ready to and not a minute sooner.” Harry could hear her giving them a dressing down through the door. He didn’t think he had felt this grateful towards Molly in a long time.
Narcissa smiled at her reflection again. “Not yet, but I’ve been writing a letter. And I thought--well, I thought if I could tell her about your Lila, that perhaps she might-might have tea with me. Like you do.”
“And I will remind you, again, not to use that language around him.” She flicked a glance at Hermione. “I’m going to finish cooking that breakfast. Come into the kitchen when you’re ready to eat.” And then she turned with an impressive flutter of her robes that made Draco long for Snape for a single moment. It had been a long time since he had felt that particular pang.
Harry stared the man in the eye, didn’t let Thompson or Aziz distract him from the staring contest he was having. “Get out Thompson. I got this.”
Harry watched him type into the boxes, not at all interested in the things he was looking up but deeply interested in the way he pushed his face just a little bit closer to the screen when he read. At the way he stared so intensely at the words, trying to parse out meanings and clicking on links to understand new words. At the surprisingly deft way his fingers moved over the keyboard.
“I mean, it seems like the two of you get along. And I saw how you looked at him, with that little half smile tucking him into bed. You two might tease each other, but you care about him.” Which was an even weirder thing to hear.
He let that cold feeling fill him up, force out the anger and leave behind a calm logic. “You won’t win this, Atkinson!” Harry cast an incarcerous which hit the table loudly, dropping vials and beakers on the floor. In the chaos he released the Creepy Crawlies.
“Yes, but you are usually in Wizarding London. There isn’t really a Wizarding New York. Wands make it much harder to keep things secret. On the other hand, potions can be disguised in a coffee cup or a bottle of aspirin, much less conspicuous.”
“Yes,” Draco gave her a small smile. “For the Department of Mysteries. I’m afraid I can’t really speak to the particulars of the project at this time though. I believe they are planning some sort of announcement at its completion.”
While Harry was gone, Faye asked several questions about the process. “Will I be able to see the memories too? I missed all the excitement.”
This time Draco careened his head to watch Andromeda and Potter leave the room, he listened carefully as they argued in quiet tones over what to do with him. All the while Teddy crept closer and closer, laying his head on the sofa and looking at Draco with big, curious eyes.
“Are you sure?” Ron asked, because he wasn’t an idiot, and he could see just how Hermione had watched Malfoy and Harry when they were in the same room. His eyes worked just as well as anyone else’s.
Malfoy turned and looked at him, eyes bright and mouth pressed into a thin line, as if he could just tell what Harry had been thinking about. “Go to your party. I’ll still be here when you get home.”
He gave her what he hoped was an apologetic shrug and stepped back towards Melanie to help her at the till.
“No joke.” She poked him in the ribs. “Who doesn’t know how to do laundry? Have you never lived away from home? Do you just go out and buy new clothes every week?”
She didn’t move from the fireplace, “I brought coffee.” Hermione held out the drink carrier, and Jude took a deep breath.
But Draco was pushing against him and wiggling and whining. “Please, please, please!” Breathless with want.
“And you wonder why Weres don’t want to come in and be registered, with such faith that crimes against them will be taken seriously.” Harry stood up.
“What’s going on at work?” Harry asked, because he was concerned and not at all because he was thinking about other events with Unspeakables.
In the middle of the conversation, Draco dropped his hands to his lap, and Tilly reached over to put hers on top. “Mother,” he said, eyes fixed firmly on his now cold cup of tea. “I am very sorry to hear about Greg.”
The entire fight lasted less than 8 minutes, ending when Sarah took three stunners to the torso, and hitting a suddenly still floor with a dull thud.
“To thank you. I’d thought that was obvious.” So, definitely ulterior motives. “Perhaps you’d like to have coffee in my office some time, being as you aren’t a tea person.”
Evan flipped off the open light, and Draco counted down the till. They split the closing duties until Jude raised his voice.
Because he was on the other side of the door, watching Teddy in the back garden, he couldn’t hear what was exchanged between the two of them as they cleared and washed the dishes. But the tone was low, and they talked for a long time. Eventually, Andromeda called Teddy in for his bath, and Malfoy took him upstairs. She stood in the doorway and watched the sun set, while Harry tried to think of something to say.
“Just a minute.” Tilly gave Jude a tight smile and latched onto Draco with an unshakable grip. She said in a heated whisper, “I thought we agreed I would do the hiring from here on out.”
Harry put his hand on Draco’s arm. “In my experience, most people are wrong a lot of the time, and it’s only when you show them, over and over and over until they can’t deny it any longer that they accept the truth.”
But Sarah was important, not just to Jude but to Robards too. She was a lead on Greyback who was still at large. He really ought to put in more time calling homeless shelters and catch up on those reports from the Improper Use of Magic Office. His head hurt a little thinking about the overwhelming pile that was sure to be.
Malfoy trailed behind him out of the room, down the hall and into the large room with all the Auror cubicles. Harry and Val shared a cubicle in the back, near Robards and Jenkins offices. The path led right by the conference room, where Draco paused at the window in the door.
And Harry stared. He didn’t speak with all that worry and concern like Hermione always did, and he didn’t say it sarcastically like he probably would have in school. “I don’t know.” Harry admitted.
Harry watched her stomp back down the alley, not bothering to avoid the filth with her dragon leather boots before she disappeared around the corner. This was his first actual crime scene since joining the Aurors, and Harry had thought it would be--well, honestly less gross. He hadn’t thought it would be bodies and rubbish in grimy alleys. He’d thought it would have been cauldron thefts and illegal potions. He’d been frankly terrified at having to identify potion ingredients by the smell or something, but now he just tried to remember to breathe.
Roxi sighed to herself. “And it was too much to ask for you to let us know before yesterday, so we could have searched them when they arrived.” She scowled.
Draco licked his lips and looked up. “But they are going to find out. The bank will tell my mother, and we know Potter’s looking for me.” Draco bit his lip and looked at Sophie to explain. “I wasn’t a good person the last time I went there. People won’t be happy to see me.”
It was late when he returned to the flat, and Malfoy was asleep on the sofa.  He looked so at peace, innocent even, in sleep. And Harry stood there for several long moments and thought about innocence and abuse and how easy it would be for Harry to fall off that slope and murder Malfoy in his sleep.
No one says no to him. No one. Not even seduction itself. He is good and he will prove to his father he can do this.
Cockybee chuckled before waving a hand and gesturing for them to sit down. Star smiled at Harry and well, she’s pretty so he winked at her in return.
He pulled his hand away from his cock as he slid it down to his perineum, teasing and tickling as Draco’s body jerked with the sensation, his hips beginning to roll but Harry held him back and stared at him sternly.
“Why don’t we take this in the bedroom, baby?” Harry asked and before she could even answer, he bent down and carried her towards his room.
Harry smiled at the sight before closing the book and carefully tossing it on the table. He raked his hands around her frame and pulled her close. Kissing her on her forehead and hummed. He laid his head above hers and closed his eyes to rest for a bit but not to sleep.
Dracy teared some more. She wasn’t able to answer immediately when she felt a sharp pain shooting through her stomach. She grimaced and bent down.
Strong with his control. That's thrilling but he knows, even the strongest and the coldest of soldier melts. An ice melts in the sun. And Draco knows he's hot enough to match its power.
She wanted to whine. She wanted to complain. She wanted to cum as many times as she was (maybe twice the amount her past lovers managed to pull from her) but she knew Harry’s in control because she gave him the chance to when she made the decision to come here.
“I like you, you know that?” Harry started to reveal. A little bit to stir him as well as how the young boy stirred him these past few days. It’s only fair to drive him insane, right?
Those eyes that looked with respect but never the same or similar with the way she does and she’s scared of what would she have to endure for this.
"I'm sorry, what?" Harry asked in disbelief, his endless supply of documents that are needed to be signed, approved, and read long forgotten.
“Nothing, Senator. I’m just getting bored from all of this” he gestured around them. The silence, being alone and covered from prying eyes but it still did not stop the risk.
Harry smirked, “You look so fucking delectable this way. Moaning like a bitch in heat, desperate for my cock” he slid a finger up and down her cunt.
“More, daddy” he moaned out. Harry gave him what he wanted and inserted another finger all the while sucking him off. He missed to see the way Harry’s cheeks hollowed because his eyes remained closed, his hands not knowing where to exactly hold onto.
He relished watching her this way. Fucking her fire out as her legs threatened to give up. He chuckled and gripped her waist tight, using her as a leverage to pull her closer. Her ass bumping against his v-line and his balls slapping in her thighs, wet from her juices.
He leaned his back in Harry chest as he took him roughly from behind. The two of them were kneeling by the couch, skin to skin and flesh against flesh. For many times, Draco had wished it to be his heart with Harry’s own but useless hope is what's working.
“Shall we get going?” Sirius asked, pouting a bit because he just have to notice every attraction of couples out there.
In a surprising spurt of renewed annoyance, Draco smacked the hell out of him because damn him for making him do this, “Wake up, you cocksucker!”
The right side of his mind told him. This is the kind of darkness he shouldn’t let himself be swallowed into but Draco is this person who have been challenging him and his controls.
She was only wearing a simple white dress with small flower designs, the sleeveless strap on her shoulders are tied criss crossed to her nape and she’s only wearing a simple pumps and have decided to tie her hair up to really show the design on the dress.
Dracy stood in front of the mirror as she watched him close the door before returning to stand behind her. Hands immediately finding their way in as he hike her blouse and pulled it off of her. And the slow movements are definitely stirring anticipation inside her, her chest heaved as she stared straight on their reflection, turned on by the idea of watching herself be sensually touched by one gentle but strong hands. Fingers caressing wherever it could reach, hard cock poking at her back and her panties that’s definitely beginning to soak.
But this, well, he had the rights to but he also stated from the beginning that her obligations occur when he needs them and not when she wants them. He didn’t realize about the heat. He knows how painful it can get especially with an unmated omega.
Draco stopped and gaped. He screamed and ran to his room where he immediately took a face mask and wore it over his face. Love is in the air! No! He must look out!
Her hands moved and slowly went around his nape without breaking eye contact. She nibbled on her lips. She instantly noticed the way Harry’s eyes glazed with darkened desire, mesmerizing flame, and ravishing look.
Harry alternated between sucking and licking, his tongue darting out to make sure nothing gets past his mouth and relishing the quiet moans and gasps coming from his girl.
Wily nodded and did just that. She sat there stiffly. She contemplated whether to open the door but she dreaded of who she is going to see there. Especially when Harry did not warn her that somebody’s going to visit today.
“But don’t take too long. Kids can throw a tantrum like no other” Remus eyed Sirius who stared back in disbelief and immediately got on defensive mode.
"Mother, father, I don't need an Auror!" He whined and stomped his feet. He doesn't need an auror! He's as fine as he is!
"We'll do this nice and good, darlin'. We're not starting too hard on 'ya. Wanna hear you be noisy for me"
He threw the pillow on his side and tried to wipe the tears away from his eyes. Now, he knows how it feels to be rejected. He feared of what come with this.
He pouted and nibbled on his bottom lips. He wants to lay on Harry’s chest and sleep peacefully but how can he sleep serenely when he’s nothing but a set of anxious nerves?
Fred and George was helping out around the counter and Harry was sitting on the stool, obviously waiting for him.
He danced like how a medieval witch on fire would. He looked away when he smirked, he closed his eyes when he laughed. He tried to avoid, tried to run, tried to keep things casual.
Harry chuckled before crashing their lips together, “I promise you, baby, one day we’ll have the answers we want”
Her moans resonated all throughout the living room, able to bother Wily but he must be used to it by now. She cannot stop keening as she began to feel Harry play with her clitoris, tugging and softly rolling it in circles. Her body jolted at the action as sparks pool down her own body.
“I hate bars” he pouted and stomped. He was about to pull Pansy away to go somewhere, probably hire a firing squad to shoot him but the audacity of his bestfriend to leave him alone?!
One look on his eyes, he saw a flicker of light amidst the coldness of his gaze. Draco saw what lies there. It’s a cacophony of evilness that tells who he is. The person that went against what the badge on his gun holster says but there was something soft inside. As Draco reach out, not minding his actions, he brushed the tip of his fingers on the apple of his captor’s cheeks.
Draco whimpered, hands feeling Harry’s rippled biceps. The strong ones that never failed not to show weakness when they are together, holding him up as if he was no heavier than a sack of rice and the ones that held him down when it came too overwhelming.
He expects Sirius’ recommendation is of any help. They cannot be having their names out there in the muggle public if it’s not for good intention.
, Harry, please, fuck” he cussed as Harry gripped his cock in his palm, rough hand tugging at his erection, thumb swiping at the slit to messily scatter his precum.
“You’ll see, baby” Harry murmured before dropping the powder and stating a place Dracy did not quite catch.
Harry pushed him off. He glared at Sirius, afraid that his father would overhear them. They can’t know for fuck’s sake!
He coughed and tried to pry their hands off, “I can’t breath. What are you guys doing?” he asked as he looked at who these people are.
“So tight” he spoke, biting down on her shoulder, “Come on, baby girl. Need you to come on my fingers” he urged.
He bid his goodbye one by one. Hugged them and a little minute longer to James because he's father is even more childish than him.
“I don’t do cuddles, sweetheart” Harry murmured before dipping down and kissing him on his forehead and the next thing Draco knew, he disappeared in smoke.
Dracy didn’t answer to that as she lowered her eyes, seeking more comfort from her Alpha. She contemplated on her own thoughts, weighed what to say—if there’s nothing to say at all.
He found himself imagining at the confines of his room. Whenever Draco is near and would touch him in any way that reflected his goal, get Harry Potter in his bed and be his little boy. Harry nearly explode at the sight of him, changing his clothes with his bedroom door open. The body hairless and fucking tasty. Tasty.
Her palms glided up and down Harry’s chest, the way the muscles felt like contorting at her touch and the arousal that’s dripping on air, she knew he can smell her.
He blinked and sighed deeply. Is this the end of what he called as his selfish moment? Would he rob fate if he asks for more? Would he ruin the chances if he demands for something else but still more?
He took a few calming breaths. Mind scurrying to think of something, grasp what’s happening. Everyone walked out of the common room not long after and trekking to their assigned bedrooms.
He’s still freaking out. From the way he had been so fucking blind and so fucking enthralled that he didn’t have the strength to walk away. He’s sure his grandfather would stare at him with contempt.
He moaned when a thumb prodded at his bottom lip, running across the smooth skin before dipping the finger inside, resting above his tongue as he was overhauled by sensations on his neck. Harry’s lips biting a shameless mark on his skin, tongue laving at the slight burn that came with it.
Curious as to the sudden change of the design, he turned his attention to it and began to read the article.
She nodded in response. Thighs brushing with one another to relieve herself which Harry definitely noticed.
The two Aurors nodded and moved while Harry turned back to the others, “The rest of you in the conference and wait for me”
He shook his head to try to wipe the distractions away and focus on writing what he has to tell Sirius. He knows he can rely on him and he wouldn't judge or criticize but would offer sincere suggestions unlike Ron who had warned him not to do anything his mind tells him to.
“If I touch you now, will you feel rushed?” his fingers slid up to the back of her head, feeling the silky strands and Dracy panted and shook her head adorably.
"Daddy, can't sleep when you're not in bed." Draco whined when he pulled back, his fingers continuously played with Harry's chest, his smooth palm contrasted with Harry's rough chest.
Who startled away from him. “What the fuck is wrong with you?! It’s my life Potter. I get to live it the way I want to and I don’t have to answer to anyone else! Certainly not you.” He scowled and picked up the hamper.
Oh, fucking hell. She can feel herself drowning in anticipation. Of what he can do to make her pay, of what she can get from him. She felt her pussy clenched and she stared at him with bated breath.
He’s dealing with the cases he didn’t assign to Ron. The dinner an hour ago went fine. They were silent and Harry didn’t bother to break it.
“Hey! I need a drink over here!” he exclaimed and tried to catch the attention of the obviously busy man. He glared at his broad back and what looked like to be a cinched waist.
She nodded and gazing at herself for one last time, she walked away from the mirror and stood in front of Harry. She took his hand and they walked towards the living room where she would meet his friends. Hopefully they will all get along and they wouldn’t ask about her status now that her father is nowhere to be found.
Harry’s eyes glanced at Malfoy who was fixing some ingredients on their brewing station silently, head bowed a little. He sighed and decided to approach him, “Guess we’re partners”
Remus’ eyes immediately darkened, his hands sliding down to grip his husband in his waist, “Do you know what you’re suggesting, kitten?” he asked lowly, voice between dangerous but so fucking turned on as his cock gave a twitch, not seeing the way Sirius smirked playfully.
In the end, he hid with his fear inside his house. Didn’t heed to Pansy’s request to go see the man of his life he’s not sure he can still call his boyfriend.
Their little beanie inside her, still just as small as a pea. She smiled and put a palm in her tummy, she’s excited for the day her bump will show. She will take care of the life inside her, talk to it and sing lullabies.
Harry can say he’s lucky because he managed to get her without any preamble. His alpha wanted her omega but the question remains, does Harry want Dracy?
He settled himself on the living room and waited for who knows how long. He sat crossed legged at the long couch and sip on the coffee he made. All the while he kept on weighing and practicing what to say once Draco arrives.
Dracy let out a small smile at the action before turning her head back to Scorpius, “Baby, daddy’s gonna get home soon. Don’t you wanna be clean when daddy arrives?”
Taking a deep breath and a step, he followed where Draco had gone to. He found him in their bedroom, sitting just at the foot of the bed, head bowed, hands calmly laid at his lap. He looked so lost and it broke his heart to see such view to one of the most amazing human Harry had ever known.
“If I were you, I’d look away” Harry suddenly spoke coldly, startling Dracy in her own worries. He didn’t have to speak and yet he did. The tone held no grave warning but she felt the dangerous threat that came from them and it ought to scare her. But it didn’t.
The next morning, Harry jogged around the Malfoy grounds. He ran around with thoughts swirling inside his mind.
He sighed and fidgeted with his fingers. Other than thinking Harry got an emergency to deal with, his overthinking skills are overwhelming him. Did he leave because of what had happened? He left the same way he did back when he massaged him.
He raised an eyebrow. He shook his head as his eyes watched a smile blossomed in Draco’s face. He was showing the bracelet on his wrist to Luna who beamed at the action, fingers dancing along the beads and string.
“What the fuck?” he turned to glare at the person who had the audacity to do this and saw an omega he was pretty sure he bedded weeks ago.
Two days after the fuck, Draco was busy working on his desk when a newspaper landed on his desk. Turning his head to thanked one of his co-employees who’s tasked in handing him the The Daily Prophet.
“yes, daddy” he murmured and his thighs trembling as he began to push in and out, one of his hands played with his nipples, stimulating him even more. Feeling how wet his panties are and the way his cock throbbed desperately.
She keened at the sensation of his teeth biting and lips sucking. She knew there’d be a mark, a huge one for that matter. A symbol of his claim.
“You bought them?” Draco began to cry again at the sight of the present Harry had given him in the cottage last year. After all, Draco didn’t buy any of the dream presents he gave to Harry.
“You tried to Crucio me!” Harry shouted back, wrapping his hands in the cotton and yanking him around.
Very slowly, Malfoy turned his head, his eyes were dilated and he moved so slowly, that Harry wondered just how long he had been perched there. Even slower still, as if his body had forgotten how to move, Malfoy unfolded himself to stand on the floor. But he had a wild look about his eyes.
Draco let him haul him in closer, so that only the stone wall was between them, jabbing painfully into thighs and knees. “Why the fuck would I lie?” he snarled back. Head and shoulders twitching to fight.
Monday morning rolled around again. It was the third Monday Harry had woken up with Malfoy in his apartment and it was starting to feel normal to make two servings of eggs and to have orange juice and coffee, to trade time in the shower and to see the hamper fill up twice as fast. Not just normal, but nice to have a warm body in the bed next to him, and to see Draco leaning on the rail of the balcony as he sipped the juice. And if Harry sometimes wanted to run his fingers through his hair or drop a kiss on his shoulder or just sit next to him on the sofa, well, that was nice too.
What if Tilly and Sophie and Evan couldn’t handle the stupid amounts of money he had. What if they started asking him for money all the time? What if Draco couldn’t actually get into Gringotts or exchange the money to pounds? What if he was getting everyone all excited about something he couldn’t actually do? What if they were terrible business people and the bar went under and Draco had just bought this bar to make sure that everyone had a place to go?
Aurors care to protect all of its citizens. You claim jurisdiction over the Werewolf population and yet you allowed a murderer to run unchecked through your streets, killing our people, brought down only by
“Yeah.” Draco began to type in some user name and password to log into the computer. He stared intently at the screen. “It reminds me that there’s a whole world out there
And Harry wasn’t sure whether it was the alcohol or Malfoy in his ear, but he actually said, “You've got 206 bones in your body, want one more?”
“Where do you wanna go?” Harry asked him, pulling him close to avoid bumping to strangers, “We can explore around the Winter booths? Or?”
His tongue skimmed through Draco’s bottom lip, licking and playfully nibbling on it. They both reveled in each other’s taste.
“Fine, fine. Let’s both be sirius here. So what’s the issue? You fucked the boy and what? Obviously fuck him more”
Harry laid the food tray at the bedside table before sitting down at the edge of the bed. He looked at the peaceful beauty, eyes still closed and hair mussed from sleep. She looks so serene, more so like the muggle princess Sleeping Beauty.
She stepped to the side, swaying her hips because if she cannot pull away from his hold, she’ll do anything in her power to try to instill her control. Even though they knew she wouldn’t really.
There’s really nothing wrong with him. He just have someone in life he can call endearments with, kiss, cuddle with, and basically, someone beside him (add the bonus of being inside him) That makes him happy. More so because it’s Draco Malfoy.
He sighed and stopped on his run when he heard an owl’s noise. He looked around and saw Ron’s owl, Pigwidgeon carrying a letter.
The next day, Draco wake up with red brimmed eyes. Being alone in the house, he had a time with his thoughts. He felt guilty for running off like that.
“You are amazing, Draco but there are just things I shouldn’t do because my name dictates me not to” he finally explained.
"He will be arriving at any moment to meet you formally, Draco. Be nice" Narcissa warned and Draco sighed, slumping his back to the chair annoyed.
“Harry, please” she arched her back carefully, for as long as her tummy can let her and Harry brushed his thumb to her cheeks fist before sliding her bra up and immediately latching his mouth on her pebbled nipples while he pinched the other between his fingers.
“So perfect around me” he dipped down, sliding inch by inch, filling Draco up with his girthy and sheer size.
“Oh, fuck” he cussed, looking at himself under the blankets and sighed dramatically when he saw he still had his own clothes on from last night. He held his head when it throbbed in pain and he groaned.
Draco bit his lips, moaning at the sound of Harry’s cold and husky voice. It turned him on, how sexy Harry can be when he’s all riled up like this. Jealous, possessive, and all stingy to share. The eyes watching him, silently restricting him of doing anything other than to stand and listen. His hands choking him in a way Draco did not expect he’ll find so hot. So absolutely hot.
He smirked deviously, swaying his hips as he pretended to be surprised, “Senator Potter? Wow, it’s good to see you”
He pushed the door open and was greeted by a room lit by moonlight. It was quiet, only the sound of their breathing being heard. And there, the cause of his worries, sleeping soundly on his bed.
Not because he have prejudices against the man but because he knows how Lucius works. Too many inside jobs, betrayals, and dishonest works have been reported to Harry when he investigated.
Harry took hold of his hand once again and raised it to his mouth, planting a soft kiss against his knuckles, “Strip for me, kitten. While I’ll go grab some things, yeah?”
He shook his head and cleaned him up by summoning a small towel and wiped him with it, “I’m spoiling you, baby” Harry winked, “I’m still sorry for running away”
The woman he was talking to noticed him first and pointed at him. He rolled his eyes and propped his chin over his palm. Flirting in the workplace should be strictly banned  even if it’s a bar. It’s damaging to his eyes.
Harry stared at her face, taking in the expression of the pleasure she is feeling and the beads of sweat forming on her forehead. As his gaze slid down to her parted lips, soft pants coming out from the way she was all muddled up from his cock dragging at the spongy walls, the tight hug of her pussy to his shaft. He loved the way her breasts bounced up and down, they were like illusions and Harry have yet to notice how fast his orgasm was approaching.
Sobbing. Sobbing like a kid. Looking so traumatized and eyes reflected as if he had saw all the wars of before and the wars for the future.
Her father’s eyes lingered to her stomach and upon noticing the action, she hugged her tummy and scooted closer to Harry’s side. Lucius smiled sadly before turning to look at her in the eyes,
"Shall I punish you for disobeying me?" Harry pretended to ponder, "Spank you until your ass is red? Edge you until your crying?"
Draco cheered alongside Pansy, Hannah and Susan as they watched the others have a quidditch match against the seventh year Ravenclaw team. It was tense but challenging.
Draco bit his lips as he stood up to watch Harry on the windows. He watched the older man whip his wand out and began to say incantations. Putting up shielding charms for precautions and Draco gulped once again as he noticed the way Harry's sleeves rode up and his muscles flexed. The serious expression written in his face is bewitching as he took in the concentration that amuses him.
“Why are you looking at me like that?! Hey! It’s the puppy inside me, Moony!” Sirius stomped and walked away dramatically.
He saw his empty luggage at the corner and when he went to his en suite to look, he saw bottles of shampoo and body soap that defined Harry's great scent. There are the usual toiletries and followed by a container of shaving cream. Draco had the urge to avada kedavra a lifeless object because Draco wouldn't want Harry to shave. He wants it as it is. It's hotter that way.
“Hey, kitten. How are you doing?” he asked gently, hand cupping his cheek while the other removed the handcuffs.
He arched his back more, eyes rolling and losing his ground to the present. His thoughts twirling at the gorgeous man behind him, having his way with him, making him feel so good, pushing him into that floating headspace.
“First timers usually fall to me because I know just how to handle them” his smile morphed into a devious smirk, “I know what to do to them. Maybe it was the reason your friend Pansy recommended you to me. She was rather very demanding and precise with her requests”
“But don’t play with it too long and too intense, sweetheart. You might pay for it in the end” he peck a kiss on her cheeks and stared at her for seconds to gauge her reaction, as if waiting for something. When seconds turned into a minute, he winked and turned around to walk away.
She looked around the room. The style wasn’t at all that elegant but it was nice and simple. There’s a circle table in the center, a bouquet of tulips and a waiter who smiled and bowed his head as a greeting upon their arrival.
Harry shook his head, looking straight at Draco's innocent eyes. The dragon buried deep inside, the dragon who was able to tame Harry's control. The one who seduced him into giving in. The one who pushed him to let go every ounce of decency two years ago and pounce on him like a desperate predator.
He kissed him on his shoulder, the hand that was hugging him by the waist, held Draco by the side of his head and gently urged his boyfriend to turn his head and look at him.
“Fuck! Yes, yes. I’m cumming, sweetheart. Filling you so fucking good” he pulled back only to push back in and stilling, pumping ropes of his cum inside her, some of it spilling out of her hole.
Harry shook his head, closing the laptop and Draco’s eyes hovered at it. Maybe the files are there? His eyebrows twitch as he leaned closer, making sure to show his chest before standing back up and transferring to stand behind his chair,
They exchanged greetings before all attention shifted to him and had to fight the urge from rolling his eyes. Straightening his back, he offered them a small smile, obviously too forced.
He just finished changing into some pajamas when the door opened and Harry walked in, strutting with casual expression as he threw his hoodie on his bed, leaving him with his white shirt and some sweatpants.
Harry was sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing new set of clothes and hair damp and absolutely messy. She was about to ask what’s this weird thing early in the morning when she noticed what he was holding.
“Potter! This is your fault!” he complained, fumbling with his wand. He coughed as though the scent reached his soul.
“Yes.” Harry thrust the paper forward, and the Goblin wasted several seconds glaring irritation at Harry.
Harry put down his fork. It wasn’t the same though--yeah, they had kissed that once, but not since then, it was all just talking and being in the Port really. It wasn’t like Harry had something to hide, not exactly. “It’s Malfoy.” He finally admitted
This was why he hadn’t told her, because he didn’t know how to explain. Didn’t have the words to say why it was so awful to sit in that office, the clenching horrible feeling in his stomach, how he couldn’t stop vomiting during a bad case. He didn’t know how to tell her he’d been demoted after that disastrous night at the University, didn’t know how to explain how he felt around Draco. And he didn’t know how to separate all those things out, they were all tangled together in his mind, and his mouth got dry and his throat closed up.
But Malfoy didn’t look at him, eyes still wild, hand now scratching at his left arm through the robes. “Three meals. There’s always breakfast, but never lunch. Too much work for lunch. Have to do the work. Have to be good. Follow the rules, do the research. Don’t question. Don’t answer. Need to find-need to find.” Harry’s stomach started to clench up.
“I’m Sophie.” She said, pouring one handed while Baby Abe wiggled on her hip and tried to grab a lemon from on top of the bar. “And you’re the idiot who seems to have attracted everyone’s attention.”
Draco ran the tap again, patted his face and neck with the towel and breathed in deep through his mouth.
“No, no, of course.” Narcissa admired the mirror on the wall, it’s lovely gilt frame and lack of smudges. “You should ask the girl’s mother. I wouldn’t want to impose,” she cut herself off suddenly.
Dean snatched the phone and, because Harry didn’t have a lock on it, quickly rang Roxi on speaker phone..
“So, you saw the kitchen, and the living room.” Harry walked them forward a little so they could see the whole of the outside of the house. “Up there are all the bedrooms.” He gestured upwards. “The outside is pretty nice. Bill and Fleur had their wedding here.” They began to walk around the yard, avoiding the happy squeals to the best of their abilities.
Ron narrowed his eyes suspiciously, and Harry explained. “It’s all Muggle liquor, he’s recreated these drinks for a muggle audience. The Fire Whiskey is pretty good.”
He dropped his keys in the little bowl to the left of the door, and toed off his shoes, feeling tired and immensely grown and wanting to curl up in Hermione’s lap.
Draco gasped loudly and held open his hands now full of sparks that flowed out to the beakers. And then he collapsed down against the barrier, coughing and clawing at the floor.
Draco woke up in his childhood bedroom and tried, unsuccessfully, not to vomit over the side of the bed.
Draco turned and faced her. “Potion. I am sorry that I am late, but if you don’t mind, I’d like to shower and change for dinner quickly.” And he turned back around and hurried up the stairs. He didn’t think about Harry or the club or work, much. Draco tried to keep his attention on the upcoming meal. He had spoken with Healer Calloway about Astoria, but she had little advice on the matter, simply listening to Draco and asking about his thoughts on the future. In truth, Draco wanted what Astoria could offer him, he did. He just wasn’t so certain he wanted to be in England, and transatlantic travel, while far easier with magical means then muggle, was still not really viable.
“What?” Harry didn’t let go, but instead started undoing the button of Draco’s cuff. He rolled it up in careful folds revealing the bandage, with its now green tinged oval surrounding that pristine white middle. “What did you do?” He cried, fingers scrambling to pull the gauze off.
And Harry had once been a busy part of all of that. He’d been angry when Robards had reassigned him, his coworkers had seen it as a demotion to be on the night shift, a street crawler or brawler depending on the night. There were several shouts of “Harry!” as he made his way to Robards’s office, lots of quick claps on the shoulder, and a few asked, “Back with us?”
Dr. Connor gestured for Harry to enter the cluttered office. “She was a bright enough girl, interested in the subject, but nothing extraordinary. I tried to help her as best I could, but, well, you know how those girls can be.”
The door to the memory room tore open loudly, and a third goblin appeared, hauling the large pensieve. He too glared at Harry, and Harry briefly wondered just how many years would need to pass before the Goblins would actually forgive his theft. He thunked the pensieve on the floor near the door; there wasn’t a table in the small room.
Teddy looked away from Draco’s still body. “That’s not why it’s sad.” He had Harry’s attention, and Andromeda, and Alice. They were all looking at him intently. “It’s sad because he’s alone.”
Which wouldn’t do. This was Draco’s space, and it wouldn’t do for strange and volatile persons to be inside at this moment. Harry thrust Rose into her arms and quickly steered her back out the door with a firm push. She went without complaint, head bent low over Rosie, hand smoothing her curls over and over and over as she hurried out.
“Angel” he murmured, opening his arms and Draco sighed when he was engulfed with the tight hug. Fuck. He misses this.
As he stepped inside his pub, he was filled by noises. Harry’s gang were at the two pool tables and betting on a game they were having. Ginny was currently playing with her peculiar girlfriend, Luna.
Harry blinked, mind flying at the news Luna decided to drop on her as if it was just a weightless bag of rice, “Okay?”
He watched him closed his eyes, too mellow with him. He cannot believe to be in Harry’s arms is just as freeing as his warmth. When he noticed Harry’s breathing evened out was the time he only let himself go in slumber,
Draco looked around his house. Taking in its appearance as he put on the backpack Harry gave him. He was memorizing every detail of the house he’d never thought of leaving and yet, here he is.
“H-harry” she started, “Ahm, can w-we, uh, can we instead…” she paused when she cannot seem to finish what she has to say.
“Hmm” Harry hummed, bouncing him on his hardening member and as Draco sort any kind of friction, his head fell back with a thud, eyes rolling at the back of his head, dizzy with sensations, driving himself crazy with desire.
want to feel you. Want to see you cum” he said filthily, every word dripping of the desire and obvious of how turned on he was staring at the sight before him.
“But as your amazing godfather, I shall provide help!” Sirius raised his bottle in the air, “Let’s go talk to Re instead!”
“Come” Harry whispered back. Hugging her tight to her waist as she let go. Her while body going rigid and lips parted.
Dracy’s eyes widened even more, her eyes alternated between Harry’s hand to his eyes. She gulped before she move away on her spot to stand in front of Harry.
"I know how to play the piano, the violin, and the flute. If you want to hear it, I can play it for you"
Remus’ smirked at him, nearly sending Sirius to topple to the floor, his legs quivering as his cock woke up from its slumber. Immediately leaking a copious amount of precum as he gulped, the sight of Remus’ own undeterred erection made his toes curl, his mind swaying.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “The witch that does the massage cannot come and so you’re going to massage me”
Draco squealed when he felt an arm wrapped around his waist and pulled him closer to a hard body. His eyes widened for a moment before they flickered with mischief.
She looked up at him and put a hand around his cock, her small fingers not being able to fully wrapped around the thickness. The tip was red and leaking as it bobbed upon her touch, she bit her lips as she gave a few tentative pumps.
“Wanting me to touch you back, grope you and fucking have you” he sucked a hickey on the column of his throat, “Right, sweetheart?”
Draco is rejoicing inside him as he let the cold air hit his thighs and his arms as Harry drove into the night.
But she knows how Alphas and Omegas differ in their psychological, physical, intellectual functions. Alphas are born naturally confident and Omegas are born introduced to such things. And she was taught how to be dashingly confident which slowly diminished over time.
He focused on his work for the next few hours, making sure he finishes all the things that needed to be finished before he dived into the ones with deadlines still far away. Making sure he has to finish the job before the clock strikes six in the evening, he didn’t eat his lunch and just had a cup of coffee to sate his stomach.
"I am" Harry stated honestly. There's no use in hiding things to Ron because he can read people very well. It's one of his defining qualities as the second-in-command Auror, right after Harry. He's the one assigned to look and handle the cases Harry cannot able to at the moment.
But then, Harry had taken a liking to him. The man literally dragged him to the dark side of the pub and confessed with no pressure and oozing confidence. The man who had laid a claim on him.
“yes, that’s it. Harder, harry, please” he sobbed into the bed as he moaned at the slap Harry gave into his ass as he railed him from behind.
Dracy was loosing her mind. Fuck, she’s loosing her mind, flying away as her mouth began to work before she could even have time to process everything that’s being done to her. Her thighs flex weakly as she felt the coiling inside her.
He kept his distance when it comes to sleeping, only opting to go when he was sure Malfoy’s asleep and they haven’t really talked to each other yet. He wasn’t even sure if Malfoy talked to anyone about it but no one’s bothering and asking him questions so guess not.
He's beginning to lose his patience. If they agree to direct them to the Auror Guards then it's done but why must they insist that he guard someone's kid?
Harry smiled and nodded before leaning his head down and began to nibble on Draco’s earlobe, “Daddy loves you” he began, his hand massaging his inner thighs.
He knows that’s enough for everyone to gossip about. Draco wanted him to clean this mess and that’s the only way he knows how.
Dracy blinked confused and before it could even register to her what is happening, Harry had immediately grabbed the camera away from the person’s hands and glared with all his might.
Dracy immediately encircled her arms around his nape, opening her mouth and letting the man take control. She’s loving this.
He never expected giving births in the natural way was this intense. The room was nothing but echoes of Dracy’s screams. He was in utter distress, even when he tried to soothe her and comfort her, encourage her and praise her, it didn’t work.
She looked away as she tilted her head and rested it on top of Harry’s shoulder. She felt him give her a kiss on her head.
Harry groaned as he looked at the blonde beauty kneeling on the bed as his lips parted to lick at the head of Harry’s hard cock.
He immediately turned to her and smiled as he raked his eyes from head to toe before folding the book and extending his arms.
Tom turned to them. Eyes inspecting them for a second before it settled on the rings on their fingers, “Newly weds?”
He pulled something out from his pocket and discreetly slid it in her palm, “That’s the key card to my suite. I have a drill for you, sweetheart. Listen, yeah?”
She carded her fingers through his hair and smiled at the view. She loves the way Harry is always talking to their little beanie, sometimes bunny, and other times their buddy.
“Leo” Tom called a little louder and Draco tensed for a bit, relaxing when he felt Harry rubbing his sides gently.
“Have to fix you up, darling” harry whispered, letting the smaller one lean on him as he fixed his lace panties, pulled his jeans up and tucked his own softening cock after.
Harry grinned and changed their positions, rolling Draco beneath him as he leaned his face down, lips brushing against his as they smile to one another, “Should I show it to you then?”
He stared at the redness on Draco’s cheeks caused by the anger he’s feeling and the way his hands are clenched on his sides. He looked like he’s holding himself back from slapping him on his face.
, this is her moment to think she’s winning. The both of them knows he’s already the winner before all of these things started.
Dracy’s moan got louder. Harry groaned at the way she was suddenly clenching around him, squeezing his fingers so tight he wished it was his cock up in the hilt. When she began to spasm around him, he felt her juices coating his fingers as she uselessly tried to buck her hips.
, please, harder please” she begged, her thighs began to feel cramp and her body unable to push her up as seconds pass by. Harry who noticed the lack of energy to lift herself up, took hold of her legs and began to pound, fucking her from the bottom, eyes watching as her face contorted in pleasure and her mouth shaped into an O.
True, they communicated but where do they stand? Are her services still required? Are her chores still stand as her duties? How would she begin her loving?
“Daddy will take care of you, little one” he added, voice hoarse from all the phrases he had to say last night. Phrases that had Draco squirming, writhing, and begging to be fucked over and over again. Bend on the knees, face first, and on his back. In all ways Harry knew would bring most of the pleasure in him and he was utterly left drooling, unable to mutter a coherent sentence.
Their moment was disrupted when an unfamiliar owl came knocking by the window. Harry sighed. Is that work calling?
When Dracy opened her eyes with a smile, she was already dressed in one of Harry’s shirt and there was a breakfast on the bedside table and a note.
He wasn’t able to properly register it as Harry pulled away and pulled his fingers out. He vaguely heard his actions as Harry took his own cock out, giving it few languid strokes and groaning at the sight before him.
“Relaxation will help you be at ease” he whispered lowly, bending down and stretching his hand across Harry’s clavicle, fingers digging into the skin to feel more of him, touch more of him now that he had felt how hot he can be, “I can help you, Harry”
“I love you. You know that right? Don’t cry, love.” he whispered, pulling away, his thumb caressing his soft cheek.
“So hot. Merlin, I love you” Remus murmured, increasing his thrusts as he bent down to give a kiss on Sirius lips, practically bending him in two. Because Sirius is wrong, not only the Malfoys are bendy but Blacks are fucking flexible too.
He was focused on his work that he had forgotten what time it was until his secretary knocked on his door and said her goodbyes. Looking at his watch, he was surprised to see it was already fifteen minutes before six so coming to a decision that these are enough job well done before his vacation, he gathered his things.
He choked on his saliva. The confidence in Harry is absolutely astounding. Well, he’s not lying because he knew that but seriously? He had to say that?
When he rode out his orgasm, Harry began to chase his own, “Fuck. So tight for me, angel. Fuck, I love you so much. ‘m gonna fill you up until you’re dripping of me”
He bit his lips when Harry’s hand returned to his throat, his hold loose as Harry lost himself from the way he was pounding like a beast in rut. He groaned and unconsciously tightened his hand as he let himself near his climax.
The gossips intensified and Harry had to resist himself from lashing out. Don’t they have lives to mind at all?
Maybe what they really need was communication and glad they were able to settle the issue Harry have been avoiding for days. Draco has been such a challenge for him that he questioned his own morals and his ability to follow them and now, he finally had accepted that maybe this is what he really wanted.
“You saved me because you told me. I know you love me because you spoke and acted. We’re married because you asked me the question and we recited our vows to each other. Aside from those events of the past, we’re here because of the words that led you and I to be us. We’re here because of the words we told each other”
His vision blacked out from the sheer intensity of it all and came inside Harry’s mouth, feeling the way he drip more slick to coat Harry’s wrist.
He sent a patronus to Sirius as to get at least a perspective from someone who could truly understand his position. He doubt his father and mother would see his point. He just prays whether or not Sirius decides to bring Remus with him, they won’t tell a thing.
Harry settled beside her as he pulled her close and wiping her sweat, “What does my baby girl needs, hmm?”
Draco was so smooth, so pale and so cute down here. His little cock throbbed with precome steadily leaking out of him with his slick out of  his ass, proving Harry a knowledge of how turned on Draco is right now as he tried to push his hips to Harry.
After Harry paid all things, he shrunk the paper bags and have them fit in only one bag before they walked out and entered a shoe shop.
When the doors were opened, they were greeted by a woman and a man, a wide smile plastered in their faces. Even when Draco is in a foul mood, he cannot deny the graceful beauty the two possess. They have this airy ambience but entirely welcoming as they shook hands with his father and the woman gave his mother a friendly hug.
“I want you to scream my name, yell, be noisy as much as you want to be. Let everyone know who’s making you feel this way” Harry whispered behind his ear, his teeth grazing his helix, “I want to hear you beg for me”
"So, what do yo think of him?" Narcissa asked his son as he turned around and sat down at one of the cushions, his hands grabbing a pillow and putting it to his lap.
Harry took on in following the man to wherever he goes, spying on his businesses and trying to interrogate some people while Draco had gotten to study the schedules Harry got and tracing the bank transfer he’s getting.
“Miss me?” he asked and chuckling when Draco jumped on his seat again. How lovely to see Draco jumping on him soon.
“Don’t stay up too late at night. Rest well, omega” then he walked away, leaving her with conflicting thoughts.
Lucius and Narcissa stood in silence. Their eyes hovering over the two figures, one reading a newspaper while the other is drinking a cup of coffee at her hand. Normally, Lucius wouldn’t like this kind of situation. Almost as if they were in some desperate need for protection but he had no choice but to drop his pureblood ego and stomp on it for a while.
They walked towards the dining where they saw Sirius and Remus sitting there. He gulped. He had not talked to them again after his stay on their place.
“Daddy” he whined bravely and Harry turned his head and Draco shivered when he felt lips nibbled on his lobe. His knees buckled and he leaned on Harry where he busied himself kissing Draco's lobe. Both of them have their eyes closed on the process and savored the moment.
Dracy stood there, feeling her heart thumping like crazy as she seemed to suddenly lose her voice. Harry was gazing at her as if he was observing her and studying her. He began to brush a thumb over her cheekbones and finally, opened his mouth.
His eyes fluttered close as their combined noises filled his room. His back flexed when he pushed in harshly, nails digging at her supple skin.
He watched the man wiped his foot, fighting the urge to wince in pain. His actions were void of any softness, no gentle feathery touches. He was a rough man with a sweet look. Dangerous. Utterly dangerous.
But Harry beside her was showing a level of confidence, exuding a presence that challenges and as they stepped inside the elevator where a few people are also in, Harry pulled his hand away from hers and gripped her by the waist.
He laughed cheekily for one more time before walking towards his office but before he went inside, he looked back and clicked his tongue, “Aurors”
Harry blinked in confusion before he spoke, “That would be very disrespectful on my hospitality, doll. I should give you at least a blissful stay”
And she’s always left sated. The way Harry takes her in the mornings before going to the Ministry, tasting her before and after they eat dinner then letting himself in whenever she’s taking a bath and one time, proceeded to have his wicked way with her in the library while she’s busy reading a book.
Harry did not waste any more time as he held himself up with one hand while the other guided himself inside her. Once he was fully in, his hand went to hold her gently on the hip before trying to move in and out slowly to give her time to adjust and making sure they weren’t harming the life inside her.
He sighed, relenting to let go of the topic for now, “Maybe” he admitted causing Harry to grin before he pulled Draco to him.
Draco smiled at his friends. These two needs to get together already. After two or more minutes, they pulled away like it was nothing and Blaise flick the bottle with his wand and it began rotating again.
How nice to see one Draco Malfoy on his knees. Hmm. Maybe with a mouth wide open, eyes blown with desire and the need of an Alpha to take over.
Draco looked around, smiling gently at the bikers who waved back as a greeting. His eyes scanned the whole area. He saw Cedric has a bandage over his biceps when he took his jacket off, Seamus has a bruise at the corner of his lips Dean is busy treating on. The Parvati twins have reddened cheeks and Goyle and Crabbe looked so worn out more than the others.
If that line is said by someone other than Draco, he would be annoyed. But damn, he loves this kind of savagery.
Just walking aimlessly but memorizing every corner and looking for possible exits lest anything goes haywire. It’ll do him no good to be careless. He cannot risk the bet because there’s no way in hell Tom asshole Riddle will win this.
“Harry” Draco began to speak, now managing to smile slightly. His hand came up to hold one of Harry’s and played with his fingers, “They aren’t” he softly whispered while shaking his head.
She stood in the middle of the living room agitated. Fingers cannot seem to stop fiddling with each other as she waited Harry to come. At least when she went out with him to the Diagon Alley before he casted glamour on the both of them. Now, she isn’t so sure whether Harry would agree to that.
“This, this, this and this” Harry didn’t even look. He just grabbed anything his eyes found decent and beautiful and handed them to the staff that follows them around. Dracy is just walking beside him with their fingers intertwined. Something that Harry did when they just arrived in Diagon Alley.
“You sure you’re in the right place? Shouldn’t you be lounging in the common room or Quidditch pitch?” he crossed his arms.
She sighed and continued to examine herself. She has to look good so Harry wouldn’t be disappointed. She turned her head at the door when she heard a knock, “Dracy?”
They went upstairs. Harry behind him in the stairs and he wouldn't deny how he stared at the young boy's ass as it swayed and lightly bounces as he climbed the stairs.
“Don’t change. You’ve been booked” she mumbled and for some reason, Draco’s chest soared but what he doesn’t know was if it’s a good thing or a bad thing.
“Where are we going, ‘arry?” she asked, leaning close to him as they fixed themselves over to the fireplace.
“Harry, please, let me cum. Let me cum—fuck!” she sobbed when Harry inserted another finger and curled them just right.
He rolled his eyes. Only this man have the decency to think of resting when they have a mission to do.
She hates how weird her cravings are. There was this one time she literally craved for ketchup with vinegar. Could you honestly believe that? Her pregnancy is very comical and peculiar. She hates it.
I think this turned a little bit more emotional than I intended it to be but as promised, no angst ;)
The start was blurry and something they’ve brushed to the side as years of pent-up energy from being the Wizarding World’s most famous cat and mouse have been restricted for fear of risking safety.
In the world of politics and business, seduction is one hell of a key. It’s a tactic for espionage, for corruption, for things illegal and for sins to blow over like hurricanes.
Maybe it isn’t just a round two calling. But round three, four, five, six, to ten. Everyone knows, mostly Marlene, how Remus can have the strength and stamina that can never be matched by anyone and Sirius is very eager to comply.
He stayed at Remus and Sirius’ house and talked to them while Sirius would not stop asking questions about his experience. He was quite thankful they didn’t judge and even though Remus didn’t scold him for it, he knew there was a hint of domineering look on those eyes.
Harry winked at him before looking away. Draco gripped his fork, feeling the quick rise of his chest and how fidgety his feet have become under the table. What was his thoughts again a while ago?
"How do you plan to get him then? I can see how strong he is with his control" she stated and leaned in the back of the chair, crossing her arms in the process.
“We’re leaving” said a rough voice behind him then he felt Harry standing up, his height coming in full and towering Draco’s smaller one.
Harry took a gulp before starting to speak, “He was drunk last night and begged me and I exploded and fucked him and then I freaked out and now, we’re here” he explained all in one try.
He just wants to spoil the omega rotten. The thought of marking her have not crossed their minds again for now. Satisfied with what they have. Relishing every second with each other, treating one another as their equal. Not an alpha who should dominate and not an omega who should just follow.
She can feel how soak she is down there and for the seconds passing waiting for the man, she was growing impatient. Her body gnawing to act bratty and was wondering what’ll happen if she goes against his drill.
A mad Draco is very sexy too. Makes him want to rut on him but well, he knows how Draco goes with his ‘horny’ ways. What could he tell? He’s just a simple Alpha with a simple principle in life.
. Well, that kind of sounds nice. More so if it wasn’t Harry calling him that. But still better than Mark, sure.
Draco’s lips parted and his ears begin to ring. He began to hear this static noise that buggered him off. It was wrong. Harry treats what happened as something that’s wrong.
He sighed. It felt as if he was controlled again, by something harmless but still, bothering enough. Like that night he dreamt Mr. Weasley getting attacked by the snake but a lot less scary.
Lily sighed, rolling her eyes right after as she stepped closer. She stood in front of him and offered a hand, “We just need to show them who’s the boss then, shouldn’t we?”
He gulped. Letting himself get pulled as his mind began to float away to another dimension wherein he wouldn’t get these strange thoughts because there’s just no fucking way.
Dracy had vented out and believe it or not, Harry actually realized some things. One of which is that Dracy had a point. He has been ignoring him and mainly because Harry cannot find what else to do.
“Parents” she murmured, looking up at Harry to see his eyes already boring to hers, “Parents” he murmured back, raising a hand and tucking her hair behind her ears before he cupped her jaw, thumb brushing at her cheeks.
Harry grabbed his leather jacket and true to his words, headed out. He drove past streets, turning around the corners and stopped just below the bridge to unwind. He took a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it up.
Harry grabbed the blindfold and showing it to Draco, “Remember your safeword, kitten. If anything makes you uncomfortable or scares you, we stop immediately and I won’t be holding that against you. Okay?”
Draco took a sip of his wine and decided to up his game, tilting his head to the side, he stretched his foot and twirled the tip of his foot on Harry’s. He winked as Harry stopped and stared at him, emerald eyes all innocent as he looked around.
He furrowed his forehead in confusion. His bewilderment evident enough he didn’t need to speak the question aloud. Harry's teeth caught his earlobe, “I call this game
“Relax, bunny. This is fun, don’t you think?” he toyed with him, lips touching his ear, not really kissing but teasing.
“You are engaged?!” Pansy asked deliriously, as if the news was nothing but the biggest and dumbest joke ever to the Wizarding World.
Deciding to go back isn’t exactly a walk in the park especially when Harry notices everyone around him seems to settle down. Joining the lives of the workforce and/or building family with their love ones.
He looks so fuckable in that dress. How many times had he seen her wearing a dress? Two? Three? Fuck.
Carefully settling the flower down, she run her fingers in his hair and lightly scratch his scalp, “Little beanie wasn’t” she responded softly.
Relief washed over Draco’s painful erection as he let himself go. Body shaking as he let out spurts of cum to his stomach, Harry’s abdomen, to the sheets below them. His mind rang with nonsense as his frame sagged from exhaustion.
However, he pulled back before the knot could form and pulled him up to sit. Harry buried his face on his neck, arms hugging him by the neck as they basked on the aftersex.
And besides, what is there to talk about? The past? How could they settle that when she and her father obviously have different kind of past? True, they still have one more thing in common. They suffered.
It didn’t take long for them to arrive at a restaurant Dracy was quite familiar with. She’d been in the place many times in the past but fought the urge not to dwell on it.
He clenched his jaw after realizing he's been ogling at the cupboard he's looking in. Gripping a vial of hangover potion, he turned around with a dark expression and looked at Draco who had a ghost smile in his lips before it was replaced with mildly surprise one.
Harry walked and laid him on the couch. He sucked on Draco’s bottom lip and afterwards, played with it.
He let him ravage him in any parts of his apartment but not once in his bed. He took no offense but he took every pain in his hands. What he needed was assurance but that exactly is too much to ask for when it was obvious of what kind Harry wanted.
He knows he’s in no way dominating. He literally doesn’t have authorative bone in his body. What he got is this charming appeal, sex drive, and ultimate motive to eventually be sated by this angelic omega.
Ron nodded once again before furrowing his eyebrows together. He opened his mouth but closed it again immediately afterwards. Harry waited for what he has to say but it looked like he was having a hard time releasing the words out.
Harry shrugged, “I am but I also thought I was still a kid. How can a twenty two year old man be a Minister? Alphas can be strong and they are but sometimes, they aren’t. And that’s when they need omegas beside them”
He tasted like jelly bean tarts and firewhiskey. Harry deepened the kiss, parting his lips and his tongue delve inside. He gasped when Harry’s teeth nipped on his bottom lip playfully and chuckling when Draco moaned.
He panted and lightly yelped in surprise when he was turned around and gently pushed him forward. Following Harry’s lead, he walked until he stood in front of a wall, feeling the heat of the mass behind him, covering his frame easily and hiding it for his own view.
Bewilderment ate his being as he tried to weigh the news brought upon him. He is engaged. He is engaged! He. Is. Engaged!
My family received a heartbreaking call. My aunt died of a heart attack and I really don't know what to say. It's too sudden because everything was okay and then, we got the call and then...i'm sorry.
His actions were captivating and sultry as Harry thrusted into that wet heat and gripped Draco’s head tight to still his movements allowing Harry to face fuck the  bewitching little boy who cracked his binds.
Until Draco got his hands up between them and shoved Harry back against the opposite wall. It wasn’t far, but it was far enough that he could breath, the two of them leaning against the walls and gasping for air.
For weeks, Draco and Evan spent pretty much every single one of Draco’s spare moments perfecting his firewhiskey recipe. They settled it on a rye whiskey infused with cinnamon, vanilla, and smoke. Tilly put her foot down on the smoke gun which was disappointing to Draco as the idea of the kitchen blow torch was closer to actual fire than he wanted to get.
It was then that the Fwooper seemed to realize it was getting left behind and shook itself hard enough to rattle the cage. Draco panicked and fled to the hallway. “Don’t touch it! Don’t let it sing!”
Malfoy covered the space between the door and the desk in several long strides, and Harry was caught in watching his long legs. “Hermione?” He asked as Malfoy sat down, “Can I get you anything?” He was, of course, asking if she needed him to stay.
I was going to wish you a Happy Halloween, but I’ve been reading that book, and it no longer seems appropriate. How are you, Potter? DM
Carefully, Harry cleared away all his papers, he summoned pillows and blankets from the closet, and gave Malfoy one last look. Maybe he would get lucky and by tomorrow, Malfoy would be gone. Harry looked down at the new mark around his thumb. If he closed his eyes, he could still see Malfoy standing on the balcony.
“You need some new clothes.” Harry hadn’t meant to say that out loud, and it was, apparently, the wrong thing to say because Jude’s face went pinched and closed. “Do you want to take the floo or apparate?”
“I don’t want you to call me anything!” He growled and leaned across the table. “That’s an interesting smell.”
Harry could feel a tick on his face, the one next to his eye that only seemed to come out when he was dealing with Robards or other stupid people. He opened his mouth to argue and then just as quickly snapped it shut. No wonder Weres hated Aurors, if this was how they were always being treated. No, Harry would have to save Draco himself. He shoved off the desk, threw the door open, and stormed the apparition point so forcefully he got several papercuts from memos that couldn’t get out of his way fast enough.
