His friends barely got the time to shout their goodbyes before he had slammed out the door, hands shaking.
Deciding to look out of his door to catch a glimpse of Potter’s mysterious hookup wasn’t a good idea either way. It was invasive, and rude, and he shouldn’t have done it.
And god, that was just a punch to the gut. It almost made Draco fall apart, but he wouldn’t let himself. Not again. Not yet. And so he forced himself to shift off of Charlie’s chest and keep walking forward, blinking back the tears threatening to fall from his eyes.
He stumbled downstairs to see Charlie eating a piece of toast at the dining room table, Prophet in hand. He looked up and smiled. “Morning!”
The man frowned slightly. “Well, I didn’t really know them. All I got told about Sirius was that he was in prison for defending our honor, then he was a horrible blood traitor. And nobody really talked about Regulus since he died so young.”
Malfoy seemed to be processing for several seconds before stuttering out a reply. “Wow. I mean. Wow. That’s- wow. Well that explains some things.”
Charlie held his hand up in surrender and turned back to his food. “Do you have your speech all worked out for Friday?”
That was strange. Potter almost always used the bathroom closer to his bedroom, and there was an en suite in Draco and Charlie’s room. That bathroom never really got used.
The man sat up, steadying himself on his elbows. There were tears in his eyes. Harry couldn’t tell if they were angry, or hurt. Maybe both.
Or even worse, Justin would want to take it farther than one night, and Harry would have to suffer through rejecting him.
Hermione picked up a book and hit the back of her friend’s head. “You didn’t even ask Charlie his name, Harry?”
“You know, Harry always says that the world isn’t split into good people and Death Eaters. We’ve all got light and dark inside us. I think your cousin told him that; his godfather. Did you know him?”
He had stopped answering their letters over two years ago. Eventually they had stopped writing them.
Afterwards, Draco was panting, head draped across Charlie’s stomach, blonde hair slick with sweat, satisfied and comfortable.
One of the reasons his slumber had been so unsatisfying was the quite loud sounds of Potter in his room, fucking someone or other. Maybe it was payback for the couple of times he and Charlie had forgotten to silence themselves, but it was annoying.
First, the Minister handed out medals, to some of the living war heroes. Draco caught a couple of familiar faces amongst the group, Luna Lovegood; that kind of weird girl in the year below him, the Weaslette clutching her left hand. Another redhead; likely a Weasley stood next to a tall and slender woman, white blonde hair cascading down her back. Part Veela, perhaps. The Thomas and the Finnigan boy exchanged a quick kiss on the lips, and smiled warmly at each other. Good for them, Draco thought. A woman who looked too much like a Black not to be his Aunt Andromeda observed the crowd, gaze soft. The remaining Weasley twin and McGonagall stood on the edges of the group.
Malfoy looked up at Charlie and hummed through a small smile. “That sounds nice. Have anywhere in mind?”
Draco stuck close by Charlie’s side, pure terror in his eyes. He really shouldn’t have agreed to this. Charlie was irritatingly confident, walking out of the Ministry like he did it every day, guiding Draco through the streets of London.
He grabbed handfuls of Charlie’s sweater and pushed him up against the brick wall, opening his mouth a bit further to slide against Charlie’s.
It was a split second decision to ask. Just something to do, considering he and Malfoy had simply been sitting there silently since Harry had come back from the memorial with the knowledge that Charlie wouldn’t be coming home to keep Malfoy company.
And now he was bound to not only two weeks of living with Malfoy, but also two weeks of celibacy. Unless he managed to get to someone else’s house, though he didn’t want the endless gaggle of Weasleys to worry if Malfoy let it slip that he didn’t come back home one night.
Malfoy put down his fork, but Charlie placed his hand onto Malfoy’s, and he took another bite before pushing his plate away.
Harry stepped offstage and let out a heavy sigh, letting his mask drop a little, even though the voices were still booming and the cameras were still flashing around him.
“You do realize you should be hexing me inside out right now? Not offering me shelter? I’ve lied to you for years. You understand that, right?”
“Now his house is Fideliused, so you won’t be able to see it until I tell you where it is. So you should know that the address of the house is number 12 Grimmauld Place.”
He set out the food and sat across from Justin, and the two ate silently until Harry cleared his throat to break the silence.
They never referred to each other as anything more than friends around strangers, and there was an unspoken agreement of general exclusivity, though they didn’t really mind if the other slept around a bit, as long as it wasn’t too often and they kept it to themselves. While the feelings they had for each other were definitely not platonic, neither of them were ready to settle down any time soon, and they loved each other, but they knew they weren’t soulmates or anything. They weren’t meant to be together like some cheesy romance novel, and they knew they weren’t in it for the long run. What they had wasn’t perfect, or really very special, but Draco was fine with that, and it seemed Charlie was, too.
He reached his hand out and wandlessly mumbled some numbing and cooling charms, and some pain relief, letting his magic seep through his hands into the ropy scars. He felt Charlie relax under his touch, then roll over to kiss him slowly.
Draco opened his eyes the way he did many mornings nowadays, soft rays of sun hitting the dragon scales on the walls, the iridescent pieces glowing and sending small rainbows across the room. And of course, on the soft white sheets was a mess of red hair on the other side of the bed. He sighed softly. He knew there weren’t many people who would exactly approve of his life choices, but he was happy, and that was what mattered. After everything, he thought a break was well deserved, and while he knew running from his past wasn’t the best solution, he couldn’t deny the pure joy he got out of being able to escape it all here.
He thought back to the first time he had fallen into bed with that incredible man. He wondered if he regretted it. He probably should have. He didn’t. Not really.
He really, really, didn’t want to be the brooding, sulking “nobody understands me” type, especially during his adult life; because that kind of behavior wasn’t really acceptable past 20 or so, but it was especially hard when he was quite literally the only one who had ever been through what he did.
“It didn’t make up for it, Potter. It didn’t make up for the beatings, or the curses. It didn’t make up for the days I was left alone without food or water, or the fire pokers on my back. It didn’t make up for when I was forced into getting that mark on my arm, it didn’t make up for the times I was thrown in a locked room with Greyback and he-“ his voice cracked then. “-he did what he wanted with me.”
“I think you are. It’s where you planned to stay and it’s where you’re staying. You don’t even have to talk to Harry tonight. You can just stay with me. But I don’t want you freezing to death out here in Merlin-knows-where, Islington. So let’s get back to the warm bed that’s waiting for you, and see about the rest in the morning, yeah?”
Charlie rubbed a hand over his temples. “Have you ever considered that maybe he’s actually changed, Harry? That you don’t know the whole story?”
“Are you out of your mind, Charlie? I mean have you actually lost it? I am certainly not staying in Harry Potter’s house.”
It was dinner time, and he had asked Kreacher to let Malfoy know it was time to eat, but the man hadn’t emerged from his room. Harry had tried to go up himself, but the door was locked, and he got no reply from within the room when he yelled.
It wasn’t like he liked his schoolboy rival as a person, or enjoyed his company, but how could anyone ever let a child go through that? It wasn’t like Harry hadn’t had his fair share of verbal and physical abuse throughout his life, but seeing it through someone else’s eyes really put it into perspective.
“Yes. You know Sirius was my godfather, right? He left me this house, along with several others, and the Black inheritance.”
And Merlin, Draco had forgotten about that in all the drama of the evening. He really shouldn’t have been doing this. Like, really shouldn’t have been doing this.
“Anyway, my foster brother is speaking at the Ministry on the 2nd, so we’ll go to that. We have a memorial for my brother the next day, which you’re welcome to come to, but you don’t have to, my family can be a lot. I’m settling in at home tomorrow, but I’ll come and see you plenty, and we can just hang out for a couple of days until the actual anniversary.”
Draco was sprawled out across, tired and satisfied. Charlie came sauntering out of the bathroom with a wet flannel and tossed it haphazardly to the other end of the room.
He grabbed a second bottle of hangover potion and walked back into his bedroom where Justin was halfway sat up on his elbows.
It was a bad idea to accept the olive branch Charlie was holding out. It would be so easy for him to yank it back when the other foot dropped. When it got to be too much. But it was tempting. It was so tempting to go back and be comforted by Charlie, and to be told it was ok, even if it wasn’t.
Draco had been 19 years old, wide eyed and scared. The first week of his apprenticeship with young Romanian wandmaker; Anastasia Cristea, recommended by Ollivander himself, was quite frankly, not going well. It wasn’t that she was unkind, Draco was just terrified, and it was affecting his magic. He couldn’t contain it, and if he couldn’t even go a day without accidentally sending crates of wands flying across the room, he certainly couldn’t hone his magic precisely enough for wandmaking. Cristea was patient with him, but he was not as patient with himself, and it put quite a damper on his mood.
He reached his hand out towards the other man, and didn’t miss the small wince Charlie gave, though he tried to hide it. Draco never understood why he always tried to hide his nerve pain that accompanied the rough burn scars that covered his body. There was no shame in them, and no point in trying to ‘tough through it.’
He has a huge house, and he never leaves it either. And if you don’t want to be overwhelmed by my parents, you can just visit my brother’s grave with me. I’m sure he’d love to meet you.”
“You’ve been working on it for weeks, I’m sure it could wait one more day,” he whispered into the younger man’s collarbone.
“Of course, Harry. Be our guest, we were just about to ask you. We were going to do tea with Luna, Ginny, Neville, Dean and Seamus if that’s ok?”
He thought about the room that he had spent so long making up just a few hours prior, for this mysterious guest, who must be pretty great for Charlie to bring him home. He wished he had gotten it ready with a little less care, now. But he wouldn’t go back and mess it up on purpose. That would just be rude.
Wow, I’m really fucking sorry y’all. I know it’s been awhile but I’m severely mentally ill, but I promise that this fic will not get abandoned, it’s just going to take a while. I was going to try to get to 20,000 words with this chapter but I decided y’all would rather I get a chapter out than wait longer so I can agonize over getting 500 more words in. Enjoy!
Harry felt strange, like he was intruding on a private moment. But it was over as soon as it began, and Malfoy started to walk up the stairs.
Ok, maybe he was a little jealous. But it was less the fact that Ginny had broken up with him and gotten with Luna, and more the fact that they were just...happy.
“Believe it or not Potter, not coming down to dinner was a bit of a signal that I don’t want to talk to you.”
But he was. He completely was. He was the type of guy Harry would stop to take a second look at on the street if he weren’t...Malfoy.
“Bloody right it will. Honestly, Charlie was being pretty smart having his boyfriend stay here instead of in the lion’s den.”
Draco shuddered, but pulled Charlie up again, and pressed their lips together gently before pulling away and cupping his cheek.
Draco nodded, and Charlie took his hand, dragging him to a small building with a red and white overhang, a glass storefront, and two small iron tables with chairs outside the doors.
Fuck, nobody but his friends even knew about his sexuality, though he didn’t really think it was the Prophet’s business who he slept with. Skeeter might think so, but he didn’t.
The bench he was sitting on was wet, and continuing to get wetter as the rain drizzled on, but Draco just let it. He could have easily cast a drying charm, but there was something comforting about sitting in the rain. He knew it was just a little melodramatic, but it shifted his mood.
Soon, shirts were on the floor, and the two men were breathing hard against each other, bodies slick with sweat, and Draco was riding the high of it, milking every last drop of pleasure he could get out of this because the day was really, truly an awful one.
Draco vaguely remembered thinking that when he first moved to Romania, though he had gotten used to the stuff there over time. He thought, though; that he might never want to drink it again after this.
Draco froze. Suddenly the world felt like it was spinning a little, memories flashing through his mind a thousand miles a second.
“An emergency came up with one of the dragons at work. She’s very ill, I need to be back there right away. The reservation got me an emergency international portkey, but your trip back isn’t for another week. Have a good time, you’ll be ok, I promise. I’ll write. I love you, I’ll see you in a week.”
There was poise in everything Malfoy did, every step he took was positively dripping with confidence and class. Even though, apparently, in recent years he held himself with a little less arrogance; looking unsure, or vulnerable, simply didn’t happen to Draco Malfoy.
Let me know your thoughts and I may try to actually stick to a posting schedule, though I will probably get one or two more chapters out today, just for the sake of y’all who come across it this early.
Malfoy seemed to give Charlie a look that expressed a “the fuck?” and Charlie smiled, quirking an eyebrow at his brother before leaning up to give his boyfriend a quick kiss. “He’s just admiring the view, babe.”
He knew that Charlie was curious. Was worried, and wanted to know what had happened to make him stop answering the letters. To never talk about them. He probably wanted to know what woke Draco up gasping for air, face contorted in silent screams in the middle of the night. But Draco didn’t talk about it. Wouldn’t talk about it. He had forced himself to move on a long time ago. He had pushed forward without stopping to stitch himself back together, and it had hurt. But the wounds had scarred over so thick that he couldn’t let anyone in enough to hurt him.
“Oh frog bollocks, he does get off his shift soon. I have to go, but you’re still an idiot, Harry!” she yelled as she rushed out of the room. “Have a good evening, send all my love to Charlie and his mystery man!”
The afternoon before, once they had returned to Grimmauld Place, he had run upstairs, locked Charlie out of their bedroom, and cried. Long and hard.
And so they settled into casual conversation. He and Theo hadn’t exchanged more than a couple of semi-friendly exchanges during school, but it was nice to see someone who was familiar, but didn’t know him inside and out. Who hadn’t seen him break down in their arms. He hadn’t known it, but it was just what he had needed.
“Hey, Justin. Sorry about that, my brother called. Do you want breakfast? I’ve got a hangover potion, too.”
Harry had taken down an entire wall to get Walburga’s portrait out years ago, but he left the rest of the portraits alone, because they usually stayed quiet.
Harry glared coldly at the house elf, who was far too old, and really should have been dead by now. “Please, Kreacher. Just shut up, will you?”
Draco hadn’t gotten horribly drunk that night. He had only had about 3 drinks before Charlie had asked him if he would go back home with him. Draco had agreed.
Hi guys! It’s been over a month since I updated this fic, I know. My mental health is shit, but I promise I haven’t abandoned it. I also might be writing a bit of a longer wolfstar fic soon so look out for that if you’re interested!
They had been together for 2 years now, Luna had moved into Ginny’s flat several months ago, and they were the epitome of a picture perfect couple. Harry knew he was technically actively avoiding that by refusing to have any ‘romantic’ endeavors past one night stands, but he had to admit it was something he longed for.
“God, I knew I shouldn’t have gotten involved with anyone. I should have warned you not to do this with me. It was bound to end up like this.”
“This is someone who knows you. Who has actual connections to you. And once I meet him, there’s just so much pressure to live up to it.”
He tried not to let himself think about the memorial Charlie was attending right now. For his little brother, who had died in the same battle Draco had fought in. For which side he had fought he wasn’t completely sure, but he had been there throwing curses alongside everyone else.
His eating disorder had been one of the things that had driven Draco out of the country. At eighteen years old he hadn’t only tried to kill himself, but he hadn’t been eating before that either.
“I just…get heated around the topic of my childhood. I blow up at people, more than I should, and I just end up hurting them and why am I telling you this? Point is, I’m sorry.”
But he had just seen the bastard for the first time in five years, and he was going to live with him.
In fact, those kinds of things about her were what Harry loved most about being her friend. A lot of people back in school had assumed she was crazy, but she was one of the most intelligent people that Harry had ever met. And if you were looking for a straight up answer, Luna was the person to go to. She was refreshingly honest, and while her lack of a filter was off putting for some, Harry absolutely adored her.
“Not now, mo ghràdh. Have patience,” he whispered across Draco’s lips, holding the back of his neck, foreheads pressed together.
Charlie looked over at him, the crease in his brow relaxing a bit. He gave his boyfriend a weary smile. “That sounds great.”
He had a scar on his neck from a bit of rubble that had hit him and a burn scar on his wrist from the Fiendfyre. The only thing he had to show for that devastating spell, that had cost a life and nearly cost several more.
Charlie let out a barking laugh, pulling away. “Gross, Harry! I don’t want that image in your mind!”
He had said his name was Charlie, and he liked to keep his family life away from Romania, so he didn’t give out his last name. Draco had chuckled, given his own first name, and said that he would love to leave his family life behind whilst out of the country, and didn’t say his last name either. Charlie didn’t mind, but his face did light up when Draco gave his first name.
I’m being nice, so you get slightly more than crumbs of drarry today. But it’s not romantic yet, because you’ll have to be patient.
Tears welled up in his eyes, but he didn’t let them fall. Every fiber of his being was screaming at him to run, to get away, it took every bit of strength he had to stay seated.
A while later, Harry stood in front of his floo awkwardly, trying to figure out what he was supposed to do in this situation.
He ducked into an alley, pulled out his wand and shrunk their luggage, dropping it carefully into his coat pocket.
As the night wore on, and he and Theo got a few more drinks in, Harry couldn’t help but start to wonder. Theo was leaning into casual touches, making or smiling at the occasional flirty comment, offering to buy drinks for Harry.
“And now I have to keep a stranger in my house for two weeks! How am I supposed to do that, Luna? I’m not put together enough for that!”
“I really am sorry, Draco. I know this isn’t how this trip was supposed to go. I’m sure all of this stuff coming out wasnt how you wanted to relax.
Draco was folding a shirt when a gentle knock came from the bedroom door, and he heard it creak open.
He had no idea how Potter came to be in possession of such a house. It was obviously a magical one, very large and quite heavily warded. It probably came from an old and respected pureblood family, but who? And why did he have it now?
Draco stopped walking, turned around, and hugged Charlie tight, burying his face into his chest. “Thank you. I love you, you know that?”
Charlie quirked an eyebrow at Harry for a moment and sighed. “Look, Harry. That’d be pretty terrible on its own, though I can assure you he’s grown from that nowadays. He’s been nothing but kind since I met him, even a passionate activist for inequality within the wizarding community. But that’s not all there is to it. You wouldn’t react like that to someone who was a prat during school. And based on both of your reactions, I’m guessing you know where he got all of those scars.”
Harry sighed and shook his head, dropping it into his hands. “No Charlie, it’s fine. You- you’re right. I might hate the guy, but I’m not going to throw him out on the street, and I don’t want you wasting your money on a hotel or anything. This is where he was supposed to stay, and we can stick with the plan. This is a big house, I don’t have to be best mates with Malfoy for him to stay here.”
I am so sorry y’all, it turns out depressive episode+writer’s block= not good, this is pretty short, but the plot picks up a little soon, and we’ve got some nice twists ahead! Again, thank you so so much for reading, and I appreciate your kudos and comments more than you could know.
Harry had never wondered what Malfoy looked like when he was alone, relaxed, more raw and comfortable. For a while he probably would have told you that Draco Malfoy didn’t exist in such a state. He was always perfect. Clothes always crisp and ironed, buttoned up, shoes shined and tied tight, hair gathered perfectly. At least he had grown out of the gel phase around sixth year, that was pretty horrendous.
The public thought he lived a much better life than he did, but that was ok. In fact, it was what he wanted. He let them see what they wanted to see and shut out the rest, claiming he was “just a private person” and letting them jump to their own conclusions.
Hermione smiled warmly. “Makes sense. Ron and I are apparating over after he’s done with work, but the Weasley family reunion will be pretty...loud.”
Before Malfoy had arrived, he had been wondering whether or not he would be able to pull off getting laid with Charlie’s boyfriend in the house. He thought he might be able to do it, the guy might not mind, or he’d be able to sneak someone in and out, but as soon as the blonde showed up on his doorstep, those dreams went out the window. Not with Draco Malfoy in the house.
Still, it would’ve been nice to have something to do with his time, but there just wasn’t anything he wanted to do, or even could.
He was annoyed with Malfoy, for starting an argument, he was shocked at the words he was hearing from him, there was a twisting in his gut, because he knew he’d intruded, poked his way into something far too personal, too vulnerable. And most inexplicably of all, he was so angry at Lucius Malfoy.
He turned on his heel and scrubbed angrily at his eyes, trying to wipe away the tears that wouldn’t stop falling.
It wasn’t just his sworn enemies either, he had blown up at those close to him too many times when they were just trying to help, or relate to him.
He laid his hand on Draco’s shoulder gently. It was warm, and somehow comforting, even though Draco was almost definitely about to be threatened.
“I grew up privileged. I know that. I know that even better than you do. My childhood was filled with things that most people don’t even dream of having, but it didn’t make up for it.”
“I don’t think anyone is truly horrible. And I don’t think horrible people are immune to change. I’ve seen you grow into the man you are up close and personal, and I’m proud of you. That can’t have been easy.”
And god, he could do this forever. If he had to spend the rest of his life hung against the familiar planes of Charlie’s body, taking in his soft warmth, he wouldn’t mind. He might like nothing more, in fact.
Hi loves! I know my posting schedule is a little erratic at the moment, but I am a full time student, so I have less time to write during the week than I do on weekends. Though I will be bored out of my mind on a road trip for Memorial Day weekend, so expect one or two chapters out! I love you all, thank you all much for the support! <3
He wondered if his father would yell. If his mother would cry. If he would get hurt. He wondered if-
Sure, there were things he had done during those few years that he regretted. But the kind of shit Malfoy did? He didn’t understand how Charlie could go looking for him after hearing that. But Charlie was his big brother, and he understood enough to know that this was out of his hands. It didn’t mean he liked it.
Kreacher raised his hands in surrender and scurried away grumbling about how disappointed Mistress would be. Harry didn’t care. He just wanted this hell of a nightmare to be over already.
Charlie yawned and nuzzled deeper into Draco’s embrace. “No, but you’re so bloody pensive I won’t get back to sleep. What’s wrong?”
He thought Charlie might push him off, but instead he moved to pull Draco closer, stroke his hair and kiss the top of his head.
He was too busy staring at the man at the door, and listening to his heart beat so loud he was sure they could hear it. He couldn’t control the words coming out of his mouth, but without his consent he was choking out a name.
“Your name is literally dragon?” he had asked, and Draco had smiled and listened to him launch into a conversation about his career working with dragons up close, which was really quite interesting. Draco had talked a little bit about his apprenticeship and wandmaking, and Charlie had listened intently.
“-Look guys, I really appreciate your concern but I don’t want to talk about it. I’m gonna go home for the night. I love you all.”
“Well…have a good time. Wait. No, that was insensitive. Don’t have a good time. But I hope you enjoy seeing your family? But not your brother’s memorial. I really don’t-“
“Well, today we’re walking over to my foster brother’s house in Islington, since you’ll be staying there. We’ll get your stuff in and I can help you get settled and get to know each other. I’m staying there tonight too since the rest of my family’s settling in at home right now.”
“Maybe,” Charlie muttered, but then his lips were on Draco’s neck, and his fingers were dancing across his waist and Draco’s breath hitched, lost in the feeling, almost forgetting how completely fucked up this was. But not entirely.
They gave an awkward side hug, and soon Justin was speaking the coordinates of his flat into the fireplace and disappeared in a puff of green smoke.
As soon as he was thrust back into a world where people knew, where there were other people that hadn’t forgiven him, it knocked the wind out of him. He hadn’t been prepared for that.
They walked down the street for a whole longer, until Charlie paused in front of number 11. Draco noticed the house numbers skipped straight to 13.
At that, a choked sob ripped its way through Malfoy’s throat. It sounded like he had tried to bite it back, but he couldn’t.
Hermione had suggested he help charities and good causes with all the money he had when they were eighteen, but he had been shell shocked and severely depressed at the time, so she had handled his finances for the last four years, and while a good amount of his money went towards charitable causes, he still had ridiculous amounts of expendable income, and he already owned Grimmauld Place, and countless other Black family properties.
Charlie understood this, knew when Draco needed to be brought back to earth and when he just needed time, so he left him alone.
“I do this and that, you know.” He was aware that was pretty obvious code for unemployment, but he wasn’t going to outright say it, and Malfoy made no comment.
It was an odd dynamic. Awkward, and still, with Charlie acting as a buffer, making sure they didn’t go at each other’s throats. Not that Harry was even sure he wanted to.
“No, it was a part of our agreement. Neither of us wanted to talk about our families, so we agreed that we wouldn’t.”
He probably looked awful. People were probably crossing the street to avoid him, in all his soaking wet and blotchy tear-stained glory. He didn’t care.
“I’m not going to the memorial, Charlie. Do you know what an uproar I’d cause at the Weasley household?”
“Draco, you’re getting ahead of yourself. This situation isn’t ideal, but I think it’s better if we work it out. I'm not planning on kicking you out of my life, and I definitely can’t make you leave your own flat. Look, you can’t stay in this park, so why don’t we just go back to the house for tonight?”
Charlie relaxed on the sofa, taking his lager and putting Draco back into a formal kneel after Harry’d gotten his too.
Harry bit his lip but dropped to his knees and sucked Draco in without another word. He worked Draco’s cock ruthlessly, stripping away every sticky trace with pleasure. The taste was just fine, evidently.
"Can’t," Harry said. "Got a ticket to that charity ball Charlie’s speaking at tonight. Benefit for British Dragons."
The floo crackled green. Excitement twisted in Draco’s stomach, along with a curdle of anxiety. Charlie was offering him to a friend tonight. Someone Charlie was going to teach how to top, with all their lessons played out on Draco’s flesh. A stranger who was going to fondle Draco’s bollocks and fuck his face and plow his arse, all while Charlie patiently explained how to use a slave like him.
Malfoy was rigid next to him, radiating irritation, or possibly the desire to strangle Harry with his chain. Harry grinned to himself in the darkness anyway as he waited for Charlie’s breaths to ease into the rhythm of sleep. Somehow he’d managed it. A week of being cold-shouldered, insulted, and ruthlessly paperworked and here he was, in bed beside the twat with a chance to set things straight.
Harry was hard again too but he ignored it. Each time he had Draco the ache inside himself only seemed to worsen. He should have known a taste or two would never be enough. So what if you discover exactly what you want, he thought—what does it matter if someone else already owns it?
Charlie almost snorted. That was all it was? "Yeah, he’s used to that. Didn’t bother to put it in the contract. I like to start out that way with a slave, probably would have advised you to as well. Think it’s good for building trust and submission. Make him work for his dinner, at least until he’s reliably following your commands."
Malfoy gave him a withering look and pushed off the wall. "It’s not what? Something you can deny? I was up for a hot fuck, Potter, not a hate fuck. Charlie would never have allowed that. That’s what makes him a good top—" Malfoy’s finger came up and poked him right back, "and you a sick bastard."
Harry tucked himself in behind Draco, kneeling too, legs pressed to legs, chest to back. He reached around and took Draco in his hand, loving the heavy weight, the heat, the swell of him.
He could feel himself giving over to Harry’s curious touch. Submitting, letting him have his way, taking whatever sensation Harry wanted him to have.  His cock throbbed and he could feel it bobbing in empty air, desperate for a touch, even a cruel one.
"Okay, that’s enough," Potter said, after the string of drool had just about reached the floor and the taste of trainer had sunk deep into his tongue. "Lick all that up and you’re done."
"It’s too much," he whimpered out finally, as Potter kept pushing in. It felt enormous, it was huge, it was so hard, he’d never had such a big cock in him. "Please, no, I need you to stop or wait just a moment, please."
"I can’t." Harry smiled. "I have to go to a ball. Shacklebolt’s always telling me to go to more of those. Good for public relations."
Charlie sighed as Draco took him deep and worked his cock just the way he liked. Damn, he’d put so much work into the boy. It really would give him a pang to give Draco up, even if he did take on Remus and Sirius’s little project.
He threw the powder into the Ministry floo and called out his home address. He’d shower and change, twenty minutes tops. He hit the bathroom and ripped off his robes, all the while indulging in a fantasy of Malfoy on his knees, being fed his own forms one strip at a time, his belly slowly filling with the case file. Harry’s cock was hard before he even touched the soap.
"Next, the contract stipulates that nothing happens which would interfere with either of our jobs. No requiring anything—on either of our parts—which would negatively impact work. Also, no revealing details to people who aren’t both trustworthy and equally deep into this. Etcetera."
"He’s trained for it," Charlie assured him. "He’ll whimper and whine that whole first stroke—and make it slow, please, I want him to feel the burn—but he can take it."
"In this scenario." George frowned. "But what about you? Is our dear, dashing brother going to be left all alone if he gets the Welsh Green properly set up?"
He raised his eyes again to Draco, almost shyly this time. Draco met his gaze with the same emotion welling up inside them, held back from spilling over only by the pure-blooded, overly starched skin of his well-bred teeth.
Panic gripped him again, just as it had when Potter had first arrived. He knew what Charlie could do to him. He’d done it before, time and again, methodically reducing Draco to a sniveling, shivering slave, pathetically eager to please. Willing to say anything, do anything to make Charlie happy. Not broken—revealed. That was what he couldn’t stand for Potter to see. Not that Charlie could force him to act the slave, but that Draco wouldn’t be able to hide that he loved it.
At least he’d made it with enough time to track Malfoy down and ask him what the hell was up. He’d never written so fast, not even at his NEWTs. His right hand ached and for all the wrong reasons. It should be sore from bringing it down on that pure-bred, overly mannered, supposedly well-trained—
Charlie shrugged. "Just being a good host. What’s mine is yours and all that. While you’re here, that is."
Charlie’s hand moved and Potter must have stepped up behind him because all of a sudden he felt cold lube smeared on his arsehole. A stingy little dollop. Then there was pressure on his arsehole, steadily increasing, and he sucked in an excited gasp—
He didn’t have much time to pout about that though—Charlie was already tapping Draco’s waist, signaling him to take the proper floor position again. He snapped into it blushingly fast--arms back, knees wide, bollocks ready for handling--revealing more training than he could bear for Potter to see. He couldn’t help it though. Charlie had drilled him hard and long on his positions, absolutely merciless when it came to hesitation or mistake. Hell,
Harry picked up the first clamp and, feeling carefully, found a nipple. He rolled it between his fingers until it stiffened, then let the clamp bite in. Draco whimpered but stayed in place. Harry took the other one and, after stiffening up the other nipple, let that one bite in too.
Malfoy poked at a scorch mark on Harry’s sleeve. "Or wait, this has to do with dragons, right? You’re Exhibit A in the importance of wearing proper protective gear?"
At a snap of Charlie’s fingers, Draco eased into the space between his legs, as trained, then looked up, waiting for the nod. When he got it, he undid Charlie’s jeans and pulled his pants down, setting his hard cock free.
Draco shivered. That first order was always hard for him if Charlie had company over. He stood and if that was a break in training—for such a short distance he should have crawled—Charlie was willing to forgive it. Especially given how gracefully he sank to his knees in front of Harry.
Then Harry had finished but he didn’t take his cock out, not immediately. He ruffled Draco’s hair instead and watched as Draco sucked in panting breaths through his aching nose.
A ring with a thin chain attached lay in the middle of the hosing area, right beneath Draco’s bollocks. Harry, having a feel now for how Charlie liked to run things, had an idea for where that was supposed to attach. He brought the ring up and snicked it around Draco’s cock and bollocks and sure enough it fit perfectly, holding him in place. The thin chain grew taut when Harry took his hand away, pulling down just enough to make Draco grunt and spread his legs a little wider, getting a little lower to ease the pull.
"Fine. Do what you want." Draco turned his back. "Talk yourself blue in the face. Say whatever you need to make yourself feel better. Wasn’t that always your way? Show your teeth then pretend you were just smiling so you didn’t have to face the fact you were every bit as dangerous as the other side?"
"Charlie doesn’t spoil me," Malfoy whispered back furiously. "He makes me wait all the time. Bloody hell, he’s put me in chastity for a whole month before."
Harry stood up, eyes crinkling. "Don’t think I don’t know what you’re doing. You know how hard it’s going to be to bargain when I’m balls-deep in him."
"No, you said it would shock you if you came." Harry punctuated each word with a quick suck. "Maybe I want to see that."
Potter wrapped the blanket around the two of them. Even more interestingly, he scooted in behind, pulling Draco tight to his chest. "No," he muttered finally. Draco looked back at him—was that anger on Potter’s face?
"Hell, you feel so fucking good," Harry said as he slid in. "You can’t resist at all, can you? Is it the silk or is it your training, or is it just that you want it so much?"
Draco bucked, realizing what was about to happen. It didn’t help. Harry had his cock on target already and Draco’s hole opened as trained. He screwed in deeper, pushing the silk in with his cock, fucking Draco with his shift as well.
"I’ll do everything I can to meet that need," Harry said finally. "But if I really, truly can’t, then I’ll let him go. As long as I know he’s going to a good home."
Draco’s face was agonized and Charlie could almost taste the moment when his control broke. He didn’t even bother to ask permission. He knew he’d never get it. He knew he was meant to be pushed over the edge no matter how hard he tried.
Charlie doubled it up as a little smile played across his lips. He held it out to Draco, nonchalantly accepting the required kiss, then moved behind him, out of sight. Draco tensed.
That earned him a smoldering silence, but Malfoy obediently followed him to the spot he’d indicated.
He seized Draco’s cock and stripped it ruthlessly, while working his softening cock in Draco’s hole, stimulating him, letting him feel the come dripping shamefully out.
Harry’s desk hadn’t been this clean since his first day on the job. He rubbed his hands across its polished wood, looking with satisfaction at the fresh quill and the new bottle of ink he’d laid out. The most important paperwork of his entire life was about to arrive. He meant to sign it in style.
"You don’t need a towel, you’ve got a slave." Charlie was bending over, searching through the implements that had been swept onto the floor. "Go on, he’s trained to clean you up."
Harry grinned. "Only to the first knuckle." He rolled closer, pressing himself to Draco’s back and wrapping an arm around him. A thrill went through him at the touch, running from his spine all the way down to his toes, which curled.
"Sounds fun." Charlie mimed a squeeze to the back of the neck, showing Harry the signal. "If I was willing to sell."
"Do you want me to do that?’ Harry moved even closer, still holding the lead carefully, but close enough now to just barely touch.
Harry grinned, grabbed the quill, and scribed his name with a flourish on the final line just beneath the other two signatures. "There," he said, handing it back to Draco. "I trust that’s all you need from me tonight?"
He hauled Draco back, impaling him, yanking him taut against his chest. "You’re mine now, you hear? I fucking
Then he fucking started on the inside of Draco’s cheeks, more fucking soap, overwhelming his senses, taste and smell both, making him feel like he’d fallen mouth-first into some strange lavender-foam world. When the bubbles grew too thick, Harry made him open his mouth and drool them out, soapy ropes that twisted down his chin and dripped to his chest and stomach. Then the palate at the top, another fine layer that clung in such a way that very little went down his throat, thank goodness, but made his mouth feel alien and thick.
"Let you what?" Comprehension hit him a moment later. "You mean you’ve been an arse to me all week because I wouldn’t let you come?" Miffedness poured into him. He’d had to do hours of paperwork tonight because Malfoy hadn’t gotten his knob off?
"What about the relationship? Not just the sex, all the rest of it? I won’t let Draco go to someone who keeps him as a dirty secret." This was the real question as far as Charlie was concerned, and where it might all grind to a stop. "Not the slave part, of course, that’s private. But that you’re together."
Harry finished the paperwork with a flourish and charmed it to the barrister’s branch of the Ministry. Then he was off to the floo as fast as he could while still maintaining a modicum of dignity. Or at least not so fast he’d spook the janitors. Of all the nights to be kept late, he griped to himself—he’d been looking forward to this for, well,
Charlie felt Draco hum with pleasure. Dragging off and tying up—never bad subjects as far as Draco was concerned. He tapped, pulling Draco off his cock. On to a more serious subject and he didn’t want to be distracted.
That had been the good part of breaking up with Ginny. He’d managed to eek out to her a tiny fraction of an admission about the things he really wanted. She’d been great in the end, really the best ex he could have hoped for. After all, she’d told him exactly who he needed to talk to about this. Someone who already had what Harry wanted. Someone experienced, who was relaxed and willing to show Harry the ropes, even share his sub for the night.
He’d barely gotten his mouth open to start apologizing, explaining, all those things that civilized people did, before Malfoy had rolled over and was practically spitting in his face.
"Good questions." Charlie dropped to the other end of the sofa and snapped his fingers. "To me, pet."
"Why would you think that?" Harry wanted to raise a hand to Malfoy’s face, stroke fingers across his cheek. He couldn’t, not here in public, or at least not yet, but oh he wanted it.
"I like it too," Potter admitted, with a smile that went right past Draco and straight to Charlie. They were fucking bonding over making him suck on Potter’s shoe. Arseholes, both of them.
Good. Draco wanted this. This was a delicate matter, and it was his responsibility to make sure Draco was well cared for.
Harry licked his lips and went on. "Wanked myself raw fantasizing about all the different ways I’d catch you that year and what I’d do to make you confess. How I’d punish you." He mouthed along Draco’s shoulder. "How I’d save you. And, er, there might have been a fair number of fantasies about keeping you locked up in Grimmauld Place."
Draco trembled. He could do this last little bit, he told himself. He’d even like it later when he was floating on a wave of post-scene euphoria but right now fear had seized him. He hated the cane. What was Charlie playing at, to bring it out now?
At least he didn’t have to worry about his own breath, Draco thought. His mouth would smell of soap and lavender forever.
, calling the contract in from the drawer where it was stored. He snatched it from the air, stuck his glasses back on, and quietly, not waking anyone, began to read.
He’d tried not to worry about it when he was younger. He’d clung to the fact that he also had fantasies about girls, ordinary thoughts about breasts and pussies and how generally nice it would be to get his dick in for a bit of the thrust-o action. Pure vanilla.
He cringed inside but he licked. He swiped the rubber clean and sucked the drool back in and told himself he wasn’t being obedient so much as he was hiding the evidence. He couldn’t stand to see his spit on Potter’s shoe all night.
"Charlie’s bed, you mean." Harry reached out a hand and plucked at the white shift Malfoy had on. It looked like something a monk would wear, all pristine and severe, but it moved like silk. "What’s this, anyway? Thought he’d have you sleeping naked."
Draco let out a pleased-sounding sigh as he was pulled up. He’d be feeling it all day tomorrow, Harry knew, feeling the burn, the memory of fullness and he’d squirm every time he sat.  The thought warmed Harry in a way that was surely very, very wrong but made him smile anyway. The guilt about what he liked was fading, replaced by the memory of Draco’s post-fuck face: sleepy and satisfied.
"It’s not for you." Oh, the pleasures the kid was going to experience. "It’s for Draco. Think about it: you’re in the tub, your boy’s head is underwater, he doesn’t need to breathe--your cock can be down his throat for a whole hour if you like."
Finally, he stopped. Draco was so hard he could have cried. His cock ached with the need to come and his bollocks felt huge and swollen and badly-used. Potter’s cock softened and he pulled out with a happy sigh, then fingered the hole, pushing it open so even more come could leak out and trickle down Draco’s leg.
If Charlie noticed, he didn’t say anything. He rubbed the tip of his cock on Draco’s lips, casually and wordlessly getting Draco’s tongue out, mouth wide. Charlie didn’t thrust in though, just kept himself right outside, wanking hard. He came fast with a heavy grunt and pearly come shot out across Draco’s tongue and deep into the back of his throat.
"Good then. We’ll save the fucking for later, with Charlie, but I needed a truthful answer to that while we were alone." Potter leaned forward and pressed a little kiss on Draco’s mouth—shockingly innocent, startlingly hot—and smartly tapped him on the shoulder.
"It’s for oral training, you see. You get full use of the tongue even if they won’t cooperate." Charlie pulled him down and rubbed his cock back and forth across Draco’s clipped tongue, grunting with pleasure as he did. "They quickly learn it’s easier to give an eager suck, work the tongue themselves than wear something like this. Top gets the pleasure either way."
His arsehole rippled further open and he gave a strangled cry.  Bollocks nudged against his arse, warm even against the heat of his abused flesh.
When he finished, he sat back up and almost groaned. Draco was kneeling face down to the ground, graceful even with his legs forced cruelly far apart, thighs stretched almost until they shook. The genital ring compelled him to strain just that little bit more or else have his bollocks stretched instead. His chest was held to the floor with the two wicked nipple clamps and his back was forced into an arch, arms high and tight below his shoulder blades.
Charlie groaned and shoved his cock in Draco’s mouth, pulling him down until his face was deep in Charlie’s curls. Draco’s nose tickled but he didn’t ease back even a fraction. He kept his tongue working against the cock inside his mouth the whole time.
Charlie took pity on him when it appeared that was all Harry could stutter out for the moment. "A business transaction, you said?" A little pity, maybe. He couldn’t help going on with, "if it’s a pet you’re after, it’s true that miniature Welsh greens have been approved for private ownership. Loyal and loving, they are. Are you wanting me to set you up with a reputable breeder?"
Charlie gave a lazy hand wave. "Of course. Wouldn’t be much of a slave if I didn’t have the right to sell him on. Doesn’t mean I’m interested, though. Had him a long time. Put a lot of training into him."
He’d spent so much time denying what he wanted. He’d always had fantasies of a man kneeling before him, servicing him, taking his cock deep, gagging a little but loving it. Of fucking a man rough, hearing him cry out as Harry forced his way in, of a ball’s deep relentless pounding while the poor sod begged to be allowed to come. Sometimes Harry said yes, in the fantasy. Sometimes he said no.
He turned to see Remus standing together with Tonks. Of course, Remus had a particular interest in the well-being of creatures often classified as Dark.
"Can’t come in it," Draco said in a low voice, embarrassment creeping in. "I can get hard but if come gets on it, it shocks me. Hard. It’s to keep me from, you know, wanking. After Charlie goes to sleep."
No way could Harry sleep. Each minute that ticked away was one less that he had with Draco Malfoy. It was no real consolation to know his sixteen-year-old self had been right: the git was absolutely worth obsessing over.
Harry felt extremely awkward. Which, okay, was probably to be expected when getting into bed with two other blokes. Even if it was only to go to sleep, not to fuck.
Green eyes. Glasses. Dark messy hair. Jeans and ratty trainers and a painfully orange Chudley Cannons T shirt. It couldn’t be—
"Good question," Charlie said, though really it was getting a little hard to talk right now, given the heat coiling at the base of his spine. "He’s a pretty accommodating pet. Competitive too—you bring in another sub to do something for you and you can bet he’ll match it if he can. If he can’t, of course, then it’s the same as for him. You can find someone else to do it or you can let it go. You’ll have to negotiate on that as it comes up." A marvelously perfect lick went up from balls to tip, making him grunt out loud. Draco, reminding him that he was perfectly sure he could meet Harry’s needs.
"I wasn’t aware I needed permission of any kind from you." Harry snapped back. "And all I really want is enough time to get out two, maybe three whole sentences without you biting my head off and running away."
He moved into Draco’s space and Draco willed himself not to step back. He really, really hated this little thing. Charlie knew it too—he wrapped a thick hand around the back of Draco’s neck and lifted the clip so fast Draco couldn’t have reacted if he wanted to. It went up into his nose before he could so much as protest and his eyes watered hard at the sudden pain in such a sensitive place. Then the clip snapped in, pinching the tender septum. The ring hung down, swaying just above his upper lip, and Charlie clicked his lead onto it and moved back. Crap, crap, crap. This was bad.
The tips of Draco’s ears went pink. Harry oh-so-slightly licked his lips out of Ron’s line of sight.
The table transfigured under him—before he could even register the wood beneath his cheek, it had reformed itself into Charlie’s favorite whipping block. It was low to the ground and firm beneath his belly and chest. It forced his legs apart so he was straddling it and ropes whipped out, binding his legs to the block, leaving his arse and bollocks dreadfully exposed. Ties snaked up from the front too, seizing his wrists and pulling him tight across the block, leaving him just enough slack to struggle and heave without having the faintest chance of avoiding a single blow.
"You know what, Ron?" Harry jumped up and came around the desk to stand beside Draco, mischief catching fire within him. "I think we should get that pint tonight. I feel like celebrating."
Harry gaped. "What am I, Cinderella? Do you want me to scrub the floors and clean the floo and sew my own clothes too before I can go to the ball?"
Harry snorted. "Like they haven’t been poking into my private life incessantly already. ‘The Choosy One’—did you see that awful series trying to analyze what I wanted in a girl? I’m past ready to be out."
"Sure," Charlie said. "They’ve got a new potion wants testing. Want to see what he’d look like as a girl?"
Of course the Chosen One was good with wandless magic, Draco thought sullenly. Wasn’t the Chosen One good at everything? And now the Chosen One had Draco’s bollocks quite literally in a clamp and was going to spend the rest of the evening teaching him to obey. His life officially sucked he assured his cock, which defiantly refused to agree. It was loving this, sick little organ that it was.
That wouldn’t do at all. Draco came back and rested said bum on the edge of the desk. "Is there a special someone you’ll be disappointing with your tardiness tonight? It can’t be the She-Weasel. I know you aren’t together anymore."
It was too big, he couldn’t do it, not without more lube. A whine escaped his throat but he wasn’t going to beg. He pushed his arse back, trying to open, trying to be good. Potter’s hand stroked down his side, reassuring him but not stopping that infinitesimally slow slide in. That had to be as big around as it came, but no, Potter’s cock opened him a little wider yet. He panted as it slid deeper, roughly tugging at his hole as more and more length entered him.
Charlie snickered. "They might have objected to my addendum to Form CP-10 (Justification of Requests For Protective Charms). I might have included a small working model of a Hungarian Hornback."
They came down slowly, holding each other. Finally, Harry’s eyes focused and he stared with glee at the evidence of Draco’s loss of control.
Indignation flared through Draco. He’d hated every minute of it. It wasn’t his fault his insane cock disagreed. And now there they were, laughing at him, and Harry would always be able to picture him teary-eyed and spitting soap. And Merlin, they weren’t even done. He could barely look Harry in the eye now. He couldn’t imagine what it would be like by morning, when they’d really put him through his paces.
"Fine, yes," Harry babbled. "I know what you’re doing and I don’t care. You’ve got a deal. I’m buying him."
The floo crackled. Harry stepped out, shaking off soot, but Charlie’s eyes were fixed on Draco, watching his reaction. Stiffened spine, crackle of magic, forward lean as if Harry exerted a magnetic pull—
"Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, get out before the shocks—" Draco’s arse spasmed. The first little tingling shocks must be starting there too. "I figured out what you want to be called. So stop."
"It wasn’t?" Malfoy looked uncertain. It moved his face in unfamiliar ways. "That’s certainly the impression you left me with."
It tasted—well, not quite as vile as he would have expected. "If I die from some shoe-borne illness, I’m going to come back and haunt you, Potter," he muttered.
He bucked and shuddered. His cock felt flaming hot in contrast to the flannel. It was stimulating for a moment and then gut-tugging fingers of ice seized his cock. He tried to get away, because fuck, Potter obviously cared nothing for his submission, but the arm around him was rock-steady, holding him firmly in place. Potter moved the cloth down to his bollocks, giving them the same stinging, freezing treatment. Then he cooled the towel and did it again, gently, thoroughly.
Harry tapped Draco’s head before his face could shade from red to purple. Draco moved immediately into bobbing up and down, giving a nice smooth ride to a cock made shiny with his spit.
He finished, turned the water off, and carefully released the nipple clamps. Draco cried out as each one sprang free but stayed head to the floor until Harry tapped his shoulder, and he sat. His face was more relaxed than ever and his body swayed slightly to some internal rhythm but his cock was hard and bobbing.
"You heard Charlie," Potter said, taking hold of Draco’s hips. "You can take me and you will. Cry all you want but you’ll take my whole cock with one thrust."
Harry laughed and reached a hand around, giving Draco a solid tug, feeling the pre-come wetness spreading on the silk. "Nope, none of those were the right names. Keep trying or I’ll keep pumping."
He sighed and took the glass of champagne the waiter offered. He didn’t even like champagne. It got up his nose and upset his stomach. Why couldn’t they ever bring around pints of lager? And maybe some cheese toasties, instead of those unidentifiable little clumps perched on fancy crackers?
Draco shuffled back and kneeled where they could both see him, putting his hands behind his neck so nothing could be hidden. His face was red—embarrassment this time—but his cock couldn’t have been stiffer.
Draco shuddered. His cock was harder than ever, twitching in the oil. He was scared, actually scared of this fucking, but he also wanted it so much he could scream. A whimper escaped him and he wasn’t sure what it was for—did he want that thick cock out or did he want to have it rammed in again and again until Potter yelled with release?
No such luck. Harry took the top off the liquid soap dispenser and poured a little in a tiny cup. Then he pulled a swab out of a container marked Q-tips—another ridiculous Muggle name as there was nothing Q-ish about them. He dipped the Q-tip in the soap and before Draco could even realize what was going to happen, Harry had dragged it across the tip of his tongue.
It was utterly humiliating, which meant he was rock-hard already. Charlie had even shown the bloke their contract—names redacted, of course. He’d let this stranger see all the things Draco had to do for Charlie, all the ways he’d agreed to please him, all the punishments he received when he failed.
There it was. Draco’s contract. A wave of emotion swept through him, relief and joy and intense anticipation and maybe more than anything, a feeling of rightness.
From this position he could see Charlie, who had banished all the toys back to the drawer and turned the whipping block back into the far-more-socially-acceptable shape of a coffee table. He ignored Draco’s pleading what-about-my-cock looks and lounged on the sofa, beer in hand. "Not bad, having a second top around. Don’t have to do anything but kick back afterwards."
Draco visibly pouted, which was an impressive thing to be able to convey while your mouth was being comprehensively fucked. Not back to that damn kibble again, his posture said.
"Of course," Draco said, showing he could play at butter-won’t-melt-in-my-mouth too. "Wouldn’t want to keep you here late tonight. I was hoping to get to bed early as well, if you must know."
"You’re inviting me out with you?" Draco sneered in his classic, inimitably snooty way until Ron turned away. Then it disappeared, replaced by a tremulous happiness. Harry was taking him out? Making it real outside the bedroom as well as in just as he had promised?
"None of your business," Potter said, still scribbling without looking up. "I have no idea how you know these things anyway. Is it some branch of divination I missed out on? Does it come to you in dreams, who’s shagging who, and why, and how?"
"Oh," comprehension dawned. A true win for higher brain functions. "Shouldn’t we, er, clean him up a little first?"
Fuck. He couldn’t. Potter’s feet? Potter’s ratty trainers? Panic surged inside him. He really actually couldn’t do this. It was too much. This was humiliation times a thousand, every teenage fear—and fantasy, let’s face it—come to life. He could barely stand Charlie knowing what he craved, let alone Potter.
Draco whimpered—a wretched sound he’d often wished he couldn’t make—but his tongue was already moving before he could try to stop it. There was a white front part of the shoe, rubbery in texture, and he turned his head and laid his tongue flat on it, like it was ice cream just waiting for a lick.
"Give him tits and make him shake them? Can’t imagine what he’d do to get his cock back. Bet he’d do about anything for that."
"Mind now, he’s a high maintenance little beast. He’ll probably revolt if he doesn’t get his fair share of cabernet and caviar." Charlie shrugged. "Just so you know. If you want a cheap pet, he’s not the one."
Remus raised an eyebrow. "The sight of formal robes has a moon-like effect on him. It forces him to transform, he claims, and he can’t change back until the robes are gone."
"Fucking Auror," Draco managed, slurring a little with his newly thick tongue. "You didn’t have to be this thorough."
Draco’s face flamed, partly from the way they were talking about him and partly from what he knew was coming next. Sure enough, it was the gossamer net bag that he’d worn for months straight in training and Charlie still used, except when Draco was in position or actively being fucked. And sometimes even then.
And he was going to meet one of them tonight. He squeezed his bollocks through his jeans, willing some self-control, threw powder in the floo and called out the address.
"Unggghhh," Potter said, in the most artless, heartfelt agreement. "Yeah, I want to fuck him." He stood up, not bothering to stuff himself back in his pants. It looked large but Draco couldn’t quite see—
Crap, he couldn’t see it—Potter’s tongue was relentless, and Merlin, it was fantastic, but he couldn’t see past their twisting tongues to get a look at the goods on offer. Potter’s hand was stuffed down his pants, though, Draco could see that. He was wanking fast and hard, grunting with pleasure with every pained moan Draco made.
Charlie reached back and grabbed the head attached to the tongue that was talking in his ear. "Fred. So glad you could make it."
Draco nodded his bent head. "You’re going to come in me, aren’t you? I’ll get shocked, it’s going to hurt—please--"
"Sorry," Harry said, rubbing Draco’s back and not even trying not to smile. "You’re still so fucking tight, even with all the pounding you get. I can’t help leaking, not when I’ve got you to ride."
Harry shifted nervously. Charlie projected his best air of mild curiosity, thoroughly enjoying this. It wasn’t often he had the chance to make a fellow top sweat.
He pulled out all the way, enjoying the sight of the silk still obscenely fucked up Draco’s hole. He played there a while, teasing the rim, dropping down to lick and suck him there until the wail turned into a sob.
"It’s for control. Of course. It’s charmed. I can’t take it off or even pull it up over my cock and arse." Draco sighed, clearly knowing what Harry wanted next. He pulled the shift up and sure enough, as it rose it tangled around Draco’s cock, outlining it in silky white. On his backside it was the same, clinging to his arse, not rising higher than the crease of his bum.
Charlie tapped Draco’s shoulder with the release signal and Draco stepped forward with a shiver. His every nerve was attuned to the next signal from the leash, determined to avoid that pain again. Which was, of course, why it worked so well.
Draco shrugged to himself, slid off the desk, and sauntered away. Potter’s idea of a secret was probably one pint too many followed by a tit grope. An outside-the-jumper tit grope at that. How the other half lived—if you called that living—it was a mystery to him.
Harry pushed back his chair. If he had to fill out one more form, he’d stab himself in the eyeball with a quill. Vigilante justice was starting to look better and better as a career option. Superheroes never had to file in triplicate.
Harry got them both back to bed, though Draco practically had to be carried. He was nearly asleep before he even made the bedroom and he now he was curled peacefully against Harry, hand fisted in Harry’s PJ bottoms. As if Harry was the one who might get away, rather than the reverse.
"Oh, he’s good at it all right." Charlie bit back a groan at a particularly good tongue motion. "Doesn’t favor it, but he can give any kind of fucking you like. What if he did favor it, is what I’m asking? What if he needs something you don’t like?"
"Well, if you’re not going to reward him," Charlie said finally, "you need to ice his cock down. His prick’s been up for a good long time now and it needs to rest." A flick of the wand and flannels soared their way, followed by a basin which filled itself with cold water.
Abbott grabbed her cloak and waved good night, still laughing, as Charlie took the message and gave the owl a generous treat.
Harry eyed the white shift, now quite plastered to Draco’s form. Might as well clean that too. He reached for the nozzle and tested the water until it was warm enough to redden. He wanted to see that, to watch Draco’s skin change color, lose its pallor as he scrubbed. He moved in behind Draco, kneeling too, taking the same position they’d fucked in.
Draco stared at him, taking in the guilt on Potter’s face. That admission had cost him. Charlie had said earlier that their guest tonight was new to this, was struggling with shame over his desires. Draco leaned forward, stretching himself a little further across the block and pressed his lips to Potter’s.
"And the natural world thanks you for your generosity." Charlie ruffled their heads. "I saw the check. This whole benefit would have been a success even if no one else gave a sickle."
"You like to get fucked?" Charlie asked, settling into the pleasant rhythm on his cock. He raised an eyebrow at Harry.
"The gesture’s this." Charlie flicked his hand in a simple sign, ending in a loose fist. "The more you close your fist, the smaller the harness gets. Like this."
Green eyes stared into his, mouth gaping unattractively. "But he’s, you know, so competent. In control. I see him at work all the time."
Git. Stupid, well-trained, ball-twistingly desirable slave git. Finally Charlie hopped into bed, right in the middle, and patted the bed beside him. Malfoy crawled in beside him with a beautiful submission only slightly marred by the triumphant glance he threw Harry.
"That’s something you’d have to learn too. What to use, when to use it, how long, how hard. If I was going to sell." Charlie beckoned Draco over. Watching that suck had gotten him up too. He could use a little of that.
Interesting, he thought as he unrolled the parchment and read. It wasn’t paperwork at all. Well, not official paperwork anyway. It was a formal request from Harry to meet to discuss a potential business transaction. Charlie grinned. Finally. He’d almost started to think Harry had lost his nerve. Good for him for taking a week to think about it, though.
"Buy Draco?’ Charlie stretched an arm across the back of the sofa. "Hadn’t planned on putting him up for sale."
"I’m terrible at communication. That was always Hermione’s role. If she were here, I bet I wouldn’t be doing half so badly."
He pulled on his jeans and threw on the nearest clean shirt he could find. After all, it didn’t matter what he wore, he realized with a ferocious grin. It wasn’t like the bloke he was going to fuck tonight could say no. Harry didn’t have to wine and dine him and wonder if he’d put out. He’d get fucked exactly the way Harry wanted to fuck him and he’d say thank you for it afterwards.
ticket order. But Shacklebolt said these files need to be done right away." Malfoy smiled back, all blond and gleamy, looking like the angel he wasn’t. "I spoke to him myself and he agreed on the urgency of this."
"You haven’t used one of these before, right?" Charlie asked, probably letting Potter take a good look at the implement that was going to make his old school rival weep.
Malfoy flicked him a glance. "I’m not surprised you get mistaken for Cinderella in those rags of yours. Have you tried asking Kreacher for fashion advice? He might take pity on you and give you something nice to wear."
Harry grabbed him, a little rough in his eagerness, rolling his cock across Draco’s tongue, back and forth fast, hard again and leaking pre-come. "Enough," he said with a final grunt, pulling Draco up by the hair and tugging the clip off. "I think I like that a little too much."
To be precise, Father had raised him to fear being humiliated by other men, to never permit Draco to lose face or be controlled. So of course, this was what he ended up craving. It was just the subconscious taking a real fear and taming it by turning it into fantasy. Honestly. Didn’t they have any training in psychology in Auror school?
"Of course," Harry said eagerly. "The howler crowd has the attention span of gnats anyway. They get whipped up by some other non-issue and before you know it they’re sending their howlers to the Cannons’s chasers or the sub-minister for floos or whoever."
"Oh, too bad," Charlie said, meeting Harry’s gaze with equal pleasure. He came over and scooped up a thick dollop of Draco’s come. He pushed two thick fingers into Draco’s mouth. Draco went shame-faced but he licked them quite clean. "Poor boy’s earned a punishment."
The first stroke fell. It was a line of fire, it was pure concentrated pain, and he shrieked, embarrassingly high, right into Potter’s mouth. Potter’s tongue met his and tangled them together as if he could suck the pain away. Draco caught his breath, knowing Charlie was waiting for that and then the next stroke fell. He spasmed, his whole body trying to get away from the pain, and tears started from his eyes. Potter licked his way down each cheek taking the tears away with his tongue, and by the time the last stroke fell, Potter’s eyes were shimmering with tears of his own.
"Yeah, I do actually," Potter said. "Such as, how does work figure into it? He obviously doesn’t act like a slave there. And what if you want something he doesn’t? Or the other way around? What if one of you wants to end it?"
Draco had time for one more groan—this one from the heart instead of the groin—before Charlie was passing Harry the chastity cage, letting Harry do the honours. It snapped on with a wicked click, locking Draco’s cock away.
"So what then?" Harry asked, pushing that image away with difficulty. "If you’re so experienced at denial why are you kicking up a fuss at me?"
Harry let his head fall back. His mouth fell open and a helpless groan emerged. He grabbed Draco’s hair and pulled him off. "Fecking hell, better stop. It’s too good."
Well, he guessed he’d measure it out the other way. Inch by inch as it reamed his arse. Hands pulled his arsecheeks even farther apart as Charlie appeared to be giving Potter a guided tour of the Malfoy bum.
George and Fred’s eyes were fixed on poor Harry, still slouched against the wall, looking gut-punched.
Draco leaned into him, his body opening for Harry’s exploration. "Charlie decides. One week if he knows I didn’t mean to. One month if I did."
"Push into it," Potter whispered in his ear. "Go on, help me bring you down. I know it’s cold but it’ll take the ache away. First your cock then your bollocks."
"Oh fuck yeah." Potter had collapsed on floor beside him, looking completely shagged out.  "Brilliant."
you." He sank his teeth into Draco’s shoulder and closed his eyes with bliss then went absolutely rigid. He came with an animal sound, desperate and long and needy.
Ahhh, fuck. Those words, that tone. Draco’s hips snapped forward involuntarily, rubbing his cock into the floor. He wanted to—no he didn’t, he couldn’t—
"In other words, he’s lounging on the rug snarfing dog biscuits and listening to the punk show on the radio." Tonks overbalanced against Remus’s shoulder, barely stopping her champagne from spilling.
Oh, fuck. Draco sucked in a sudden hitching breath. Not a stranger.  His bollocks shrank and tightened all at the same time, not sure if they wanted to get away or get right to it.
Just as well, though. The quiet ones could be harder in the end. They’d take what you gave them and never give a whisper back that they weren’t getting what they needed until it all ended in a massive row. No chance of that with Draco. If he needed a good rough face-fuck, he’d snap his own handcuffs on and have your cock down his throat practically before you got through the door.
"I’ll bring in some sub who does like it," Harry said promptly. "Making him top some other boy? Putting him in charge of someone else’s slave? I’d love to see that."
Charlie flopped back to the sofa and got himself off with a couple of fast pulls as he watched Draco collapse forward into Harry’s arms. Pleasure rushed through him, a relief both physical—fuck, it was so good—and mental. There was nothing like seeing a pet go to a good home.
He’d fought his desires, he’d really tried, even getting back together with Ginny during Auror training. Which was fine, except for the fact it was only manageable because training kept him away for long stretches, then when he was in town he could reasonably claim to be too tired to do anything in bed. Then training was over and he was forced—at the pointy end of an angry red-head’s finger—to admit that he really, absolutely, didn’t want to have sex with her. Or any girl.
Charlie put his beer down, came over and casually grabbed Draco’s hair. "Yes, he’s a slave. My slave."  He roughly yanked Draco’s head up to meet Potter’s eyes. "You’ll have plenty of time to see how much he likes it. Don’t worry about that."
Potter nodded, his gaze fixed on Draco’s knees, which he knew for a fact weren’t that interesting. Not bad, of course, but not one of his top ten features. Perhaps—just perhaps--a trifle knobbly, if he had to say. And speaking of knobs…
That would only make Charlie roar with laughter, though, and probably double the number of slapper smacks. Which, he’d also like to point out, he didn’t really like. It hurt. The fact that the sensation also went straight to his cock and made him beg and plead to come was neither here nor there.
Draco pressed his lips to Charlie’s bollocks in the required waiting position and wondered idly which Father would hate more—the amount of time Draco spent sucking Weasley cock or the amount of time he spent with his face pressed to Muggle denim. Though both probably paled before bowing and scraping to Harry Fucking Potter, so he’d probably hit a new aneurysm-inducing low tonight, if Father ever found out.
Harry repeated that to himself three times then gestured to a quiet corner where they could talk. "I trust you know how to follow?"
Not the fucking tongue again, he thought, though he supposed they might as well make good use of it now that he was literally squeaky clean.
Harry groaned quietly. He’d seen pictures of chastity devices. Wicked little lock-boxes that kept the cock from getting hard. No matter how much Malfoy wanted, needed, craved a climax, he wouldn’t be able to get it up and come. What he’d give to put one of those on Malfoy before he fucked him raw…
Harry rewarded him with a quick kiss to the back of the neck. "Good boy," he said, staying there, draped across Draco’s body. "That’s right, that’s what I always want you to call me. Now open up your legs. I’m going to fuck you."
Assuming Charlie liked Harry’s offer. He’d had Draco since Romania. The brat’d been sent out to work in the dragon sanctuary as part of his probation deal, with Charlie as his overseer. There he’d tossed his blond hair and waggled his arse and dragged his feet and kicked up a fuss at everything he was asked to do until Charlie had been forced—forced!—to put him over his knee and deliver a sound spanking. After which, said brat had demanded a fingering, then a fucking, then crawled smiling into his bed and stayed and stayed. Charlie’d had no choice but to train up the little beast.
"First you’re mad because you don’t get to come, now you’re whinging because you do?" Harry fucked back in with a brutal stroke. "Really, Draco, will nothing ever please you?"
Draco’s eyes were still half-closed but he was looking down to where the shift was still tangled around his cock. His cheeks were turning pink. "I’m supposed to—it’s a rule--"
Charlie nodded. Good answer. "By the way, I’d insist on a right of first refusal if you planned to sell to anyone else. There’s a responsibility there that keeps going on." He let Draco do his marvelous tongue-flick to the slit, followed by a twisting suck. His balls tightened with pleasure.
"And my arse, Potter? You won’t leave that alone--is that your point? Want to prove what a cock-slut I am, see how much you can make me leak by fingering my hole?"
"Oh that’s easy. Fuck with his dignity and fuck his arse and you’ll meet ninety-nine percent of this sweetie’s needs." Charlie laughed even as Draco’s face burned hot. "As for finding out what a slave really wants, I’ve found it’s best to be absolutely sure. I use Veritaserum."
Charlie seemed amused. His fingers twisted in Draco’s hair, hard enough to hurt, just the way he liked. "Wanting to submit sexually doesn’t mean you’re a pushover in the rest of your life. Draco is a fine barrister and he’s
"You’re hard as a rock, you know that right?" Harry said with a little smile as he pushed the swab all the way back, waiting for the gag, holding Draco’s head tight through it. "Good boy, by the way. You’re doing wonderfully. Nearly done with the tongue."
"Of course." Potter let out a shaky sigh. "You deserve honesty. I do want it. I want to see your face when the cane hits and I want to kiss you while you twist and cry. I’m sorry but I do."
Draco trembled inside. There were some things in the drawer that he loved and some things that he hated. He wasn’t sure which he’d rather Potter found out about. It was so raw, having his dirty little needs laid out on a table and talked about, over his head no less. Protesting would only make it worse, though, so he crawled as fast as he could to the drawer and started bringing everything over. Clamps and clips and tight-bundled ropes he carried in his hands, as taught, awkwardly crabwalking on his knees. Paddles and canes and whips he brought one at a time in his mouth, as required, careful to keep his teeth from marking them, laying them out on the table as instructed.
Draco rolled his eyes and found his voice. "What? Are you going to take House points, Potter? Ten points from Slytherin for not being a top?"
Actually, Draco knew because Charlie had told him, and Charlie knew because it was his sister the four-eyed git had been boffing. Still, if Potter wanted to think Draco was a god of gossip, he didn’t mind. Kept people on their toes if they thought you knew everything.
Still, you had to push them out of the nest sometime. Or out of the frying pan into the fire, as the case may be: Harry was no pushover when it came to tops. Draco’s arse would stay nicely reddened and his hole well-plowed with Harry in charge.
Potter snickered. "If they were going to kill anyone, I’m sure I’d be dead by now." His tone stayed light but the firmness was back as he said, "now do it again. Put your tongue on it and keep it there until I say you can take it off."
Draco grimaced. "It stops me from getting that far usually. Pre-come makes the shocks start, just little ones, tingling, then stronger and stronger if I keep leaking. Wakes me up before I can come."
Draco’s hands sunk into his hair, clutching wildly as his cock was tongued. Then he pushed Harry back, scrabbling, trying to fend him off.
"Jump to it and get everything from the top drawer over there. Bring it all over and lay them out on the table for us." Charlie turned to Potter. "I’ll just show you some of his favorite toys, let you try a few out."
Charlie laughed and kissed him. "So a good time was had by all, I see. Glad to hear it. You’re not done, of course, not close to it. We’re going to ride your arse harder than you’ve ever had it and if you don’t satisfy, I’ll put you outside the door with a sign telling the neighbors to fuck you too. How does that sound for a plan?" he asked, turning to Harry.
A hard blow caught Draco right across the back of his thighs, dragging him back into the moment. The next one cracked before he could catch his breath and he cried out, head jerking back. The pace was picking up, Charlie expertly driving him into a frenzy, knowing the precise speed to turn his world into nothing but pain and reaction. Another blow, this one licking around the curve of one leg, nearly enough to catch the bottom of his bollocks. He clawed forward, crying out and a mouth met his. A hot tongue pushed past his lips.
"Any way you like," Draco answered, "and anywhere. I’m sure Charlie told you that." There were contractual limits of course, bans on ridiculously extreme things like mutilation, non-negotiated permanent marks—Draco had a particular sensitivity to that, no need to ask why—and various other things, but that wasn’t what Harry was checking on. "If you mean, can you throw me over the counter and arse fuck me dry, then of course."
Potter soaked the flannel, wrung it dry, then brought it under the blanket. Draco braced himself. Potter wrapped a soothing arm around him—insult to injury, damn it—and twisted the ice-cold cloth around Draco’s cock.
Speaking of which, here was said git in person, blowing into the department in a flutter of nicely tailored grey robes. A stack of case files floated behind him, trailing along like sad little puppies.
, but his heart was already dropping at the thought that he’d be on the other side of Charlie all night. That wasn’t what he’d hoped for.
Draco dropped his head and sobbed. How fucking long was nine inches? It had to all be in already but Potter just kept fucking forward, pulling Draco’s hips back to meet him, stopping him from squirming away. It felt like a fucking iron rod was being shoved up his arse, Potter was that hard.
"How do you feel about someone else touching what you’ve bought while you’re learning the ropes? I’ll be honest, the other night you looked a might possessive." Of something you didn’t own, no less, he added to himself.
. "That is, I mean, thanks for inviting me. You didn’t have to and I’m sure you would have had fun just the two of you—"
"You know," Charlie said as he hauled the two of them in front of him and saw what they had on. "Many people would consider it in poor taste to wear dragonhide to a benefit like this."
"Here you go," Charlie said, handing the end of the long leather strap to Potter. "He’ll be nice and docile with his leash on."
"Done with that?" Charlie asked. "He’s a good boy but caning does tend to make him scream. Might not want your cock in there." The sound of wood swishing through the air came from behind him.
Or maybe it was worse than that. Was it his past? Did Potter think he was good enough for an unfeeling screw but didn’t deserve a caring hand in return? Had it been a hate fuck, a long time in the making?
Charlie looked concerned. If Draco wasn’t a good boy—and he was, damn it—he would have pulled away, tottered over, and collapsed at Charlie’s feet. Put his head on Charlie’s knee and let that rough hand soothe the sting away.
"Yeah, well, spill on the romance then, if you want to pay us back," George said. "What’s the problem?"
"Why? He just likes the way it looks? Doesn’t want you stripping in the middle of the night?" Harry couldn’t quite figure it out.
That was Potter’s voice and that must be Potter’s fingers, now easing underneath him and moving Draco’s cock into a more comfortable position. A tingle of transfiguration followed and the block beneath his cock became a little plusher and a little slick with oil, perfect for rubbing against.
"Oh," said Potter as he took in the hosing area as well as the more normal shower etcetera. His eyes lingered on the rings set into the walls at a variety of convenient heights and locations. "Those are for hitching, I suppose?"
He got a cock in the face instead. Draco opened his mouth just as he’d been taught, taking Potter in and gently laving him, cleaning off the spunk. This was the opposite of a blow-job in many ways—he had to take care not to stimulate the already over-sensitive flesh. He looked up, Potter’s softened cock in his mouth, and found green eyes staring down at him.
"You play Quidditch what, once a week?" Charlie pointed at Draco. "Him you’ll ride every night. Whatever you want, when you want it. What’s that worth?"
Charlie snorted. "I had a Welsh Green once, you know. Raised him from an egg. Lovely specimen, great flyer, and desperate to mate too, but the poor bugger couldn’t close the deal. Kept mucking up the mating dance. Finally I had to put a collar on him, disillusion myself, and lead him through the steps myself. Personal triumph, that: I got two tons of dragon flesh happily laid."
Harry kicked Draco’s legs a little farther apart, relishing the tiny extra fraction he could sink in. Then he rubbed a soothing hand on Draco’s lower back. "You’re pleasing me already. There’s nothing you can do so stop trying to control things. You’re not getting a ring and I think you know what I’m going to do."
Where would a Malfoy be? There. Harry spotted a knot of well-dressed people and eager waiters and the flash of photographers. He strode in that direction.
Charlie wasn’t much for fancy flats but this was his indulgence. He needed more than just a little shower after all. He needed space to--as Draco oh so wished he hadn’t let slip—hose his slave down. It was a dragon tamer thing, he supposed. Teach a man to clean things with a powered nozzle and he just couldn’t resist applying it to everything.
The trainer moved toward him. Potter’s foot nudged his face. Prat. Draco would have guessed Potter would back off. Run away at the first hint of real domination. Instead he was moving into the scene.
Malfoy was being the perfect slave. Ostentatiously, aggressively perfect. Bringing Charlie his slippers, kissing his feet before easing them on. Offering oral pleasure with a gracefully bent head on Charlie’s thigh. Turning back into a perfectly postured kneeling statue every time Harry came near.
The frantic girl looked down at her clipboard and then back at the boy, "Maggie will be back next week, but she told me to remind you about the two concerts this weekend and your board meeting is all set up for next week, so she said to be prepared."
Draco chuckled. "You're lucky you're cute and I'm hard-headed, Léon. That wasn't very nice what you did."
Letting out a deep breath, he let all his thoughts slip away. Instead, he focused on his steps, looking around at the beautiful surroundings. He smiled as he felt the heat of the morning sun and the soft breeze that seemed to be permanently blowing on the island on his skin.
Every potion, every ingredient in anything you create is there for a purpose. Without every ingredient or if you alter an ingredient to something that isn’t substantial, the substance won't work out the way you need it to. That goes with potions, poisons, antidotes, cooking, baking. Pretty much anything you create needs every ingredient listed or a good substitute in place of it. Golpalott's Third Law is the law of which states that an antidote cannot simply be created by finding the antidotes to each separate poison in the blended whole and mixing them together. With the use of ingredient knowledge and trial and error, you can find an ingredient or multiple ingredients that work perfectly together to combat the poison."
He chatted away with his old friends, catching up about life after the war. Every now and then he would look towards his blue-haired roommate. When the boy wasn't doing anything suspicious, which was pretty much all of breakfast but Harry had to keep looking just to make sure, Harry would look around the room. No matter how many times he searched, he never saw the familiar face of Fleur.
Harry looked at him confused. He searched for a scowl or anything resembling the coldness of the Malfoy he used to know, but nothing showed. When Harry refused to answer, Malfoy put the shirt he was folding into the drawer with a sigh and softly closed the dresser. He walked over to his trunk and sat down, looking over at the other students who were still unpacking their own bags. Malfoy smiled as he saw them all joking around with each other like old friends do. He turned towards Harry.
He picked up the phone as he put his things away. "Merlin, Pans. Wait till I tell you what.. no, no,
Harry nodded, turning towards his essay, slightly leaning to the side to avoid touching Malfoy. "If the ingredients in the blended poison are the same of the separate poisons, why wouldn't you be able to use the separate antidotes from each poison? The ingredients didn't change so shouldn't it work the same?"
Harry leaned his head against the cold window, speaking softly, "The fact that I'm in love Draco Malfoy."
Harry looked around himself at the smiling faces of his former-classmates (which, technically they aren't exactly
It's been exactly two weeks since the start of school. Two weeks since Harry saw Fleur in their dormitory, and Harry still has a vault full of unanswered questions. Every day that passes has Harry's mind and body itching for any form of answers.
"8 o'clock." Harry smiled and thanked her for her help, payed for the pie and coffee, and headed out. He decided he didn't get enough walking down earlier, so he started walking along the shore line, until he checked his phone, realizing it was already ten to 7, and he turned back around, heading for his hotel.
Draco opened his mouth to speak when another bolt of lightening struck, closer this time. Looking at each other with worried eyes, they made their way back to the shore.
He amazingly made it just in time to the potions classroom. He fell into the first open chair he could find, dropping his bag to the floor and his head to the arm he had laid out on the table.
Harry let out a sigh, squeezing the hand that still held Draco's. "I thought I did. I thought I knew exactly where my life would go after, well." He looked out at the dark water. "The future is so weird." He mused.
Harry chuckled lightly as he leaned over the table even more so, suddenly getting a brilliant idea, "What are you doing today?"
Harry fished out his money and handed it to the man, "Wow that's pretty cool being one of the first families. I bet this place is very special to have stayed so long."
The last thing Draco noticed before the darkness over came him, was a hard chest and tightly wound arms around him.
The elevator doors opened revealing a just as nervous looking Draco. When their eyes met, all thoughts of anxiety flew away.
Whatever Harry had been expecting when he was told that the function Draco was performing at was a family reunion, it defiantly wasn't this.
"When I came to the boardwalk the first time, he was my taxi driver. He tried to do some small talk about the land, but before the conversation could go elsewhere Hermione called me and we talked the rest of the way there."
Draco's grey eyes suddenly felt very wet, and not just from the ocean. He quickly looked down at the water so Harry wouldn't see the tears that had begun collecting.
staring at him that way made his whole body feel like it was thrown into freezing cold water, yet it also made him feel as though the sun collided with his chest somehow. When he sang that last line, catching Harry's eyes, the felt completely, totally bewitched.
"You know," Draco started, sitting up straighter, "One of these days I am going to get you to like me." Léon's ear twitched slightly. "Don't deny it, you are already getting use to me."
As soon as he arrived back at his flat, he quickly showered, and fell into his bed, hoping against everything that sleep would give him some form of answers.
Draco looked at them confused, saving it to question later, he leaned back into the seat, "It has been really good, Forest. I'm actually happy to have caught you. I kind of have more questions about the island, if you wouldn't mind."
Harry's breath hitched as time seemed to stop. The voices of the crowd slowly disappeared until all Harry could hear was his own blood pumping through his veins. Harry has seen Malfoy's eyes many times before. Stared into them so intently while in a fight that he could make out the dark blue colors that flowed through the grey.
Draco looked up at Harry, fingers still rubbing Harry's skin, "Not much. Being attacked nearly everyday with a wand that didn't chose you, there fore barely could do a simple
They had moved positions so they were laying flat on their backs looking up at the stars, their shoulders touching with every little move. Noise sounded down the beach where many teenager seem to partying.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t see why not. Not sure how much you will get out of him. He has basically shunned all humans.”
"Hermione, it's not suicide. I'm just going down to a little village, in a little island, just to get away."
Daphne groaned, "She had to work late. I swear the Ministry thinks it's their bloody job to keep their employees away from their families."
Harry turned to him, grabbing his chin and bringing his face closer, "What can I say? I don't like to share. Whether you like it or not, Draco Malfoy, you are stuck with me."
As the final song came to a close, the audience erupted into the biggest cheer he has heard to date. He gave them a big smile and waved as he exited the stage. He was starting to walk towards his dressing room when a hand on his wrist stopped him.
and can also apparently do an amazing amount of magic, if the magical atmosphere was any indication.
Malfoy was sitting on a comfy looking leather couch with multiple books stacked beside him, one of the bigger books sitting in his lap. Watching Malfoy sitting in a library with shiny blue hair, with his eyebrows furled and lips pressed into a thin line from concentration, had a different kind of warmth fill up Harry's belly. He thought for a moment about going over to him, talking to him, maybe even questioning about Fleur or the tingles, something he has been wanting to do but has been too afraid to ask, but couldn't bring himself to do so. The boy that was sitting in front of him looked so serious and concentrated, he felt he couldn't break that. So, Harry stood behind a shelf, watching the boy open the heavy tome in his lap for a second longer than turned away.
George turned, heading back to the counter, "Or something. Many of the women who have lived here were witches but there isn't many of them left, you see."
Draco's eyes flew open; he knew that voice anywheres. Looking up at the person trying to untangle their legs from his, he caught bright green eyes.
"No, I don’t see how that could be possible. Even if he was a muggle that pissed a witch or wizard off, I don’t believe he would possess the amount of power he has. Granger, that cat is lousy with power."
Harry leaned into Hampton to whisper that it was alright with him. They slowly made their way to the table, saying excuse me and I'm sorry at least thirty-two times. Once they finally got the tables they realized the show had already began.
He began drinking, to get his mind off of things. He was never a big drinker, he still really isn't unless he is under a lot of stress, but the weeks leading up to this 'vacation' he began drinking more heavily. He didn't tell any one about his drinking, he didn't want to worry them. Hermione and the Weasleys' are constantly in a fuss about him; if they knew of the drinking, he was sure he would never hear the end of it. They would do anything they could to make sure his alcohol intake was measured. The night he decided to come to this island, he felt himself slipping deeper into his hole he was already laying in. He felt stuck, like there was no way out besides mentally being somewhere else. He couldn't go into town, there was too many people, he couldn't bare the thought of going to his friends' houses, all they did was constantly worry and nag on him. He couldn't go any wheres in the magical world, the place he loved so dearly. He felt trapped and broken, and the walls were closing in on him quickly.
They didn't do a very good job at hiding their disappointment when Slughorn pressed his lips together, muttering
He sat up slowly, Léon walking around him till he was sat in the front of Draco. The panther's eyes, which had lighten just a little bit again, ran over Draco's body before settling on Draco's eyes.
"If you need a deeper reasoning, I can go get Headmistress McGonagal, Professor." Malfoy's voice, while he spoke quietly, was forceful enough to quiet any whispers that they other students were saying.
It was strange seeing the room in such a mess. Even though Draco is used to these kinds of messes, it still made his skin crawl and he felt a desire to clean.
Harry looked thoughtful as he answered, "Honestly, I am not really sure. I was extremely wasted the night I decided to travel somewhere's. I somewhat remember being at a bar at some restaurant and someone telling me about an Island of Dreams. All I really know is that I had woken up the next morning with a plane ticket booked here and decided hey, the ticket was already booked so why not go."
God, Severus Snape, at a very young age. Due to this gift, he finds himself often times slipping into other's minds without meaning too. Draco usually catches himself before he slips too far into the persons' psyche, but he still always catches a few words before he slips out.
But this Malfoy's eyes seemed so different from that Malfoy's. This Malfoy's eyes where bright and seemed kind and genuine. Harry couldn't look away. He opened his mouth as if to say something to the boy.
Harry and Malfoy, while not exactly becoming friends, speak more often -mainly in small gestures, points, and little noises- but still communicating to some sort none the less. It wasn't the hugest step to most, but for the two boys it was a leap.
He whispered over and over again against his lips. Suddenly, right when Harry was moving to put his head against Draco’s shoulder, Draco’s chest rose high as he took in a shuddered and strained breath.
Growing up, he was constantly told what to do, what to wear, how to act. To rebel from this without angering anyone, Draco began climbing. The higher he was the less people that could tell him what to do. If he was already the best, no one can possibly hound him to do better.. right? Another reason for this obsession, he came to learn, came from the idea that when you are high up, you are harder to spot. When you climb a tree, you can see the people below but often times those people don't notice you.
Ginny and Harry stood to follow, Harry pausing when Hermione stayed on the couch. She had a far look on her face as she rubbed at her forearm, the same forearm that had the offensive word
They spoke softly as they made small talk on the way down to breakfast, both of them too afraid that if they spoke any louder this spell that has been wrapped around them would be broken.
"It would be very rare that they both would hear it. If that was the case, we simply would choose who ever seems the strongest to do the spell, leaving the other to sacrifice. If neither hear it, than all hope of a beautiful future will be forgotten."
Thank you for all the support and love!! If you want to read more from me I also have a finished one shot called “The Color Blue”!
Draco sighed as he leaned against the bar. He took one last look around, not seeing Potter for once, he decided to start heading towards the exit. Pushing the door open, he nearly hit someone square in the face.
They shared a glance as Slughorn began speaking, "Today, we will be brewing Girding Potion. You will work together with your table partner, with no complaints. At the end of class, if the potion is presentable and safe - which it should be, this is Advanced Potions; both of you will take it." He flicked his wand and all the instructions flew onto the blackboard, "Begin."
written across a wooden panel. With the rebuilding, they had taken away all the secret doorways and passwords instead adding double doors with magical sensors that only allowed the students that lived in the rooms to open the doors. Harry took a deep breath and walked in.
"Well, since we will be seeing you often, the least we can do to show Draco we approve is call each other by our given names? Eh,
Stilling his breath, Draco quieted, listening in for any noises, but finding only the noise of soft water flowing and crickets chirping.
Draco nodded, pushing open the door. Three men stood at the entrance watching the pair walk in with somber faces.
It seemed as if every student was in the common room when Harry and Malfoy arrived. Even Hermione, who is rooming in their old houses rooms, was there, chatting happily with Luna Lovegood and Ginny Weasley.
Pansy took a deep breath. "Look, darling, it's getting late so why don't we try and catch some sleep and regroup in the morning. Hopefully by the time we all get off tomorrow evening Blaise will have something for us?"
Harry nodded, not knowing what to say. He was never good at this sort of thing, really. When people get emotional, Harry tends to freeze and his brain often stops working. It had made the months after the war ended extremely tense and awkward as he jumped from funeral to funeral to ceremony to funeral. The best Harry can ever come up with is an "I'm sorry." and an awkward hug. Even here, with his best friend, the person he has risked his life for for years, and she has risked hers for him, he can't think of anything to say, anything to do, besides hold her hand and let her know that he is here for her. Hopefully it's enough.
Malfoy smiled down at his book, his blue hair falling over his eyes slightly, his cheeks turning a slight rose color. The sight did strange warm and tingly things to Harry's body.
"Who was the guy you were with last night?" By accident, his voiced laced with jealousy. If Harry heard it, he didn't say anything about it.
only to find that it was no wheres in the store. Seeing as it hasn't left that shop in the past few centuries and you are the only one who can get in and allow access to it, there was only one conclusion I could come to. What in hell possessed you to give the only protection against the tree, to the boy who has to finish the spell?!"
said it was either him or her. The women who raised me, took care of me even when darkness over took our home, or a man I only knew from word of mouth and hollow speeches. It wasn't exactly the hardest decision I've ever made. It wasn't until I got to the top of those stairs. Till I saw him. I could tell he was weak.." Malfoy audible gulped. "I could see it in his eyes. He was already basically dead. Even knowing that.. that this man was most likely going to die whether from my hand or not.. I-" His voice broke off.
and got to travel the muggle world. He was very proud of the life he has made for himself. He loves what he does, he has made some new friends from all around, and best of all, he doesn't have to deal with the drama that the war had. He got away from all the pointing, the stares, the prejudice. He rarely thought about the war these days. He still has his scars and nightmares, but he chooses to see them as reminders of what he has survived, not a reminders of where he comes from, literally and metaphorically.
He quickly got rid of their potion and grabbed his and Malfoy's things. Hermione was standing next to the exit door with a curious look on her face.
Sitting next to the stage so close Draco could reach a foot out and kick his stupid face, was one Harry Potter. To the regular viewer it would seem that Draco was perfectly fine and performing like he was born to do it, which anyone who has heard him sing knew he was. But today not even the familiar, usually calming feeling of his guitar in his hands could cause the panic that is slowly rising to the surface. Luckily, his set was almost up with only two more songs to go. He can do this. Two more songs.
. I like you Draco. Not just as a friend. If you wouldn't have pushed me away all those times, you would have seen that."
Harry snuck a glance towards Malfoy, who looked to be explaining something to the girl he walked in with, and quickly looked back towards Luna, "Not sure. I kind of want to work on my studies and relax for this last year."
"You don't have to thank me. Please, don't thank me. I don't deserve it. I was a royal screw up- no, I was worse. I helped them get there, I allowed them to hurt people. To hurt children. You wanna know something that truly makes me sick? I actually believed in what the Dark Lord was saying. I wanted to be able to help my family get our power. To help families like mine who were dying off because of muggles and muggle-borns. Until the end of fifth year, I truly wanted to be one of them. A Death Eater." Draco let out a hollow laugh, "I didn't even know what that word meant. In the middle summer between fifth and sixth, the Dark Lord called me in. When he tasked me to.. when he gave me those orders everything inside me shut down. I knew if I didn't do it.. That entire year it felt like I was under imperio. I wish I was, at least than I would have an excuse for my actions. Giving you that wand.. I know it wasn't much but.. it was something I could do. Something I could do to try and help fix the ginormous mess I created."
She rolled her eyes as she fully stepped into the room, shutting the door behind herself. "Why are you like this?" She asked, exasperated.
robes he wore today? Absolutely dreadful. The color does nothing for his eyes.'" Parkinson mocked, with a smirk.
He glanced behind the two Slytherins, noticing how everyone was watching them, even the professors. "Look, I was just going on a walk. Would you like to join me and I can explain? At least, explain what little I know?"
Draco looked around at the view before them. They had chosen to sit outside on the hotel's patio to eat. The weather, like normal, was breath taking. It was a little warm with a light breeze, the sky was a bright blue with a few clouds floating a head. The only flaw you could find, was the dark clouds that sat along the north and part of the west side of the island.
Keeping his eyes on the sky, Draco flashed back to that moment in the war. That one life altering moment.
He drew out Draco's name in a way that almost had Draco's knees shaking. Draco nodded numbly and shut his dressing rooms door, leaning against trying to even out his breath.
The Great Hall was still as magnificent as Harry remembers, with the floating candles, the ceiling that reflected the starlight sky outside, the four long tables still set up in the exact places Harry remembers. From another's view, the room looks like nothing had ever happened to it, it looks the same way it has looked for a multitude of years, but for the older students and the teachers who have been through the horrors of war, the room was very different.
in most languages, and not only does it perfectly match the stubborn and unrelenting attitude of the large cat, but it also serves as a great way for Draco to irritate the thing. Which is slowly becoming Draco's favorite pass time.
Draco ran his hand through his already disheveled hair, leaning further onto his elbows. He jumped slightly as a hand came to rest on his arm.
Sliding to the side to let a family through, he walked through the exit of the small airport. As per usual, he planned this trip solely on a whim without thinking about where he would stay once he got here. He looked down at the map that he had printed out before leaving. The only hotel was roughly about seven miles down the road.
As Harry walked over to where the man was, Draco stayed behind and began looking through the jars. There were many items he recognized- warts, snake venom, bile, talons, basilisk scales; there was also a few items he didn’t quite recognize.
Harry shook his head, for some reason he felt like he needed to stick up for the eccentric old man. Looking at George sadly, he whispered, "No I don't believe he is."
Harry kept walking, pushing himself against the Veela. "No. I won't. Believe me this past week I have had lots of time to think since the person I wanted to talk to the most was ignoring my very existence. I don't care if you are a Veela. Draco, I want to be here for you. I want to be around you. I.. I really like you, Draco. A lot. So much that this past week has been a living hell seeing you hurting and not being able to do a damn thing about it.. and then seeing you laying on that table.. with blood coming out of your mouth.. Draco, I don't care if you are a Veela, a wizard, a werewolf, a muggle.. I don't care. I just want you. I want you. All of you. Every good, every bad and everything in-between."
- Corporation of Dangerous and Endangered Creatures; where he gets to save and protect a variety of different creatures who the Ministry deem unworthy. At least that's who he treated at first, through the years the corporation grew nearly as large as the Ministry's of Magical Creatures Department. Nowadays, the ministry would send the too dangerous or hard to crack cases to the
Fleur nodded, "Yes, Draco's situation is extremely rare. Not only him being male, but also him being the first nearly full-blooded Veela to surface in many years."
Mrs. Mellow spoke up, "Because Hampton, some of us may harbor gifts but not at the level that our ancestors did. With centuries without proper practice, we simply aren't strong enough. Not even if we used all of our strength and worked together. It just isn't possible."
When the door shut behind him, Harry thought for a moment about calling Hermione. Maybe she could help some how.
When they walked into the small store, it was vacant once again. The door that the old man had went through when he left was no longer there.
For the passed two years Draco and his friends have eaten dinner together once every first Friday of the month; on more than one occasion a Friday night dinner resulted in a Saturday afternoon breakfast. Today the three sat in a very rustic, country-style muggle restaurant named
Two hours after breakfast, Harry found himself strolling around the island. He had stopped at a few of the mom-and-pop shops that were placed around the town, but he mainly just enjoyed the quiet, peaceful nature of the town. This is exactly what he hoped for when he randomly decided on taking a vacation three days ago on a depressed, drunk Tuesday night. No one expecting anything from him. No stares as he walked around the town. No one stopping him for a picture or an autograph or to question him about his victory. He always assumed that after a few years the stopping and staring at him would lessen but if anything it's gotten worse over the past two years. People became more brave, stopping him while he is out to eat with friends or shopping for groceries to ask
Their arrangement was simple. Sex; and quite a lot of it honestly, drinks, and the occasional day spent with each other, know what topics are on and off limits. It was a bit strange he supposed, they were more distant than most couples, not as tightly woven as you’re supposed to be when you’ve been together for that long.
He pushed Theo against his bedroom wall with a thump, kissing him hard and trying not to think about the fact that this was his godfather's bedroom, as always.
“You don’t even have to meet my family or anything like that, ok? My foster brother has a house in London that I’m sure you’d be welcome to stay in. Merlin knows I spend half my time there when I’m back home, if only to get away from my mother.”
“Former Death Eater. And I can tell you that you are deserving. Just please, come back to the house. We can debate this in the morning, but I think we all need some time to rest and cool off right now.” He held out his hand, and Draco hesitated to take it, but he did.
“Shit happened in this whole house, Hermione. It’s fine. Regulus’ ghost isn’t going to haunt him or anything. This is one of the only rooms in the house I’m pretty sure incest hasn’t  occurred in recently. So, good guest room.”
Harry didn’t know what on earth possessed him to cross to the other side of the bed. He wasn't sure what spirit enticed him to reach out for Malfoy’s shoulder, and there didn’t seem to be anyone around to blame when he hugged him.
Draco walked back over to the bed and burrowed under the comforter, then reached out a hand to brush Charlie’s hair back gently.
He had been eighteen years old, ashamed and afraid when he gained that scar, and he had slashed at the mark until he faded into unconsciousness, intending not to wake up. But his mother had found him bleeding out in the bathtub at the manor. She had saved his life. He had barely survived, edging on the cusp between life and death for days on end at St. Mungos while healers worked on him around the clock. But it had made his mark unrecognizable, so that was something.
Charlie was wrapped around him, warm, heavy and comfortable. Charlie always ran warmer than Draco did, but that was fine. It was nice.
“It really isn’t so bad. We mostly stay out of each other’s way, and he hasn’t tried anything. Though I wish he and Charlie would remember to cast a silencing charm every once in a while.”
Harry woke abruptly to his phone ringing on his bedside table. His headache was piercing and he felt as though he was about to throw up. He probably shouldn’t have drank as much as he did the night before, but there was nothing to be done now. He clumsily pushed his glasses onto his face and wondered who was calling him at this time in the morning when he heard a groan next to him and felt the bed shift.
“Sure. You’ve been nothing but kind to everyone you’ve met in Romania. Most people I know haven’t even achieved that, but you just seem to get along with everyone.”
But he figured, though Malfoy’s words might have been incorrect, or misinformed, they were probably not from a place of malice.
But then Charlie’s hand was pressed against the crotch of his pajama pants, and he lost control completely, pulling Charlie into a desperate and messy kiss, lips sliding together. He straddled Charlie and looked at him with hungry eyes before dipping back down to kiss him again, slow and deep.
“You know, the gifts, and the money and such were probably my father’s twisted way of apologizing. Not because he felt bad, no. To win back my favour. So I’d keep following him blindly, like a dog.”
“Maybe not. But it doesn’t mean you don’t deserve to be loved. Moving on isn’t impossible. It doesn’t mean it didn’t happen, it means you’re getting past it. You seem to have done a good job of that so far. I get this is throwing you for a loop, but you’ve proved that you’re capable of change.”
He chuckled. “No.” He didn’t think he could if he wanted to. It might not have been the healthiest way to face this, but it was a way. “Think you can get back to sleep now?”
He hadn’t given a proper apology in awhile, though there were probably several he owed. He knew that.
“I’m sure she could wait a day,” he mumbled, pressing open mouthed kisses down Draco’s neck. “Just phone her for an extension.”
“Charlie, you’re seriously telling me that in the three years you’ve been together, you haven’t told each other your last names?”
Harry swallowed thickly, picking at his nails. "I don't-" He paused unsure on if he should be spilling his secretes to two snakes that he has never once held a conversation with. Knowing they feel for Draco the way he feels for Hermione and Ron, has him continuing, "I've never been in love before. I've never even felt love until-" His closed eye tightly, refusing to let his emotions best him. "I don't exactly know what love is. I can't tell you I love him because I don't know. All I can give you is I would give myself up for him. I would take a bullet for him."
Granger stared at him blankly for a moment. She closed her eyes, taking a shallow breath. "So. The panther. I've read the reports you sent, also read the books as well as did my own research, which I'm not a hundred percent finished with yet, and I understand where the frustration is coming from. I have found no animals with the powers you have written on the reports nor have I found anything remotely similar to the magic and the physicality of said panther."
When Draco began to backpedal, Harry felt frustration jump at him. He grabbed Draco's wrist roughly, pulling him completely out of the common room entrance. He pulled him behind a tapestry he knew was an entrance to an abandoned hallway before turning back to him.
"Another grand performance Mister Malfoy." Malfoy rolled his eyes as he walked towards the dressing room, "I've told you, Mitch, quit calling me 'Mister'."
Hampton laughed softly, "I was just saying how he is performing tomorrow night as well. I was curious if you would want to maybe come with me?" Hampton looked down at his hands as a blush began its way onto his face.
The panther was no longer growling at him, instead he was staring at Draco like he was the dumbest creature alive. Which, frankly, wouldn't be too far from the truth seeing as he stood making jokes while being trapped in an enchanted room that currently housed a mysteriously magical large black panther who may or may not have killed two employee of the
He walked back towards the castle. Harry stared down at where Malfoy had touched him, relishing in the fire that even that small touch provided, before he realized what Malfoy had said.
Everyday he has spent at least four hours in the cat's presence, not including Saturdays and Sundays unless it was his weekend shift, he finds himself questioning the mentality of the cat every day. The more time he spends with the cat, the more his gut is screaming at him that this animal isn't just an animal.
They ran down the hall to the panther's room, employees throwing themselves against the walls to avoid being ran into. Upon arrival Draco found Alice Goodmen, a practice Mediwitch, along with George Fall and Beck Thompson, both from the Restraint Division standing in front of the panther's entry door.
Walking to the elevator, his nerves, that he had hadn’t even noticed until now, hit him full force. He was so caught up in the moment all day yesterday he never realized just how many nerves seemed to run through his body. In every relationship he has been in, he has never felt as high strung as he does when with Draco. Not to say him and Draco were in a relationship, mind you. But they were in something in-between friends and a little more than friends, and Harry found that he didn't mind being in-between as long he got to spend more time with the sarcastic, too-sexual-for-his-own-good boy.
etched into it forever. Harry sat down, taking Hermione's hand away from her arm. She sat rigid, her face fell cold.
"Potter?" Strong harms grabbed his shoulders, holding him in a sitting position, "Potter? What's going on?"
He didn't sleep much the rest of the night but the little sleep he did have, it was filled with blue hair, steel eyes, and lots of blood and anguish.
Stepping in, he had to take a moment before his eyes fully adjusted from the bright, sunny day to the dim lights in the store. It was much bigger on the inside than it looked on the out. There was a pine wood circular desk right at the entrance, and a tall lady that reminded him of a much older Madame Pomfrey sat behind what looked like a muggle computer and a younger girl stood beside her scanning books with her wand. Pass the desk, were at least twenty rows of shelves, with what looked like even more shelves the further you went into the store. There was also small rooms on the left hand side, most of them left open but two with closed doors with an "
Draco groaned extracting himself from Harry, but kept his hand clutched tightly in his own, "We have got to go see a doctor about this. It's sounds very serious."
Harry's jaw clenched, he looked down at his hands that lay on the table, his left hand kneading hard at his right knuckle, not even noticing the foot steps or Hampton's suddenly movements, "What ritual?"
Beck spoke up first, "We cannot get the door open. We have tried everything we can think of magical and non."
When it was clear that George had no intention on continuing the conversation, Draco began to look around again as Harry walked to the counter.
"Yeah, ha-ha, so funny." Draco responded to the look. He glanced behind the cat and froze at the sight that laid before him.
Pansy rolled her eyes, leaning back against Neville's chest, "You wouldn't know a thing about fighting, Draco."
Harry looked towards Draco's door, suddenly not wanting this day to end, "What are you doing tomorrow?"
"I miss you guys." He whispered into the phone, finally turning away from his reflection and out the door.
"I thought Veela were just women? I read about them occasionally having men but it's extremely rare, isn't it?"
At first glance the cage looked completely vacant. It wasn't until Draco stepped closer and heard a low growl coming from the far corner that he noticed the large black creature strapped down by shimmering chains. It's ears laid flat against his head, his claws menacingly scratching the floor with razor sharp talons, his tail swung aggravatingly behind him, sending dirt and dust around the cage. The creature's dark green eyes were in slits, daring the two men to come closer.
The end of what Narcissa said to Draco was taken from a quote: “Allow failure to teach you a supreme lesson: Each sunset is the beginning of a very, very bright and powerful sunrise.” – Sri Chinmoy. Source of quote: inspirationfeed.com/sunset-quotes/
Harry was surprised to hear a light chuckle escape Malfoy. A quiet silence fell upon them. Harry, looking out over the lake, Malfoy, sitting up on a branch staring down at his book, not collecting any of the information it was providing, both deep in their minds.
"Yes, Harry, you are correct. Don't worry I'm a friend not a foe." He stopped next to the table in the middle of the room, "I am curious about you two, though. My uncle doesn't get much business these days. Ever actually. See people often have a..
"Well, if you need someone to show you around or just have a good time with, you can always call me." He smirked at Draco as he walked away, purposely swaying his hips.
Harry thought for a moment, "I think.. I think I should be the one to tell him. I'll Floo him tonight or tomorrow, depending on how this is about to go."
Draco groaned, buttoning the last button, "Pans, don't even start on that. I have a performance in an hour. I have to focus."
Harry shook his head, "You didn't have to do anything. You had a choice to follow him or come to us and you made your choice."
When Draco walked out the front door of the hotel clutching his guitar case, he felt his heart swell so big it felt like it was going to pop. Standing in the middle of the driveway, looking up towards the sky with his eyes closed, was the boy who has held Draco's heart for as long as he could remember. His eyes began to water, not because he was scared like before, but because the sheer
Draco shrugged, "None of us that's for sure. What about you? Do you ever miss your family? From the muggle world?"
Harry took a deep breath, "Look," he spoke quickly, "We are both here and this island isn't very big and there is like one bar to chose from and one hotel and like three things to do and only one beach, it's a big beach but still, and-"
A little sob wrenched from Draco’s throat. He couldn’t say no to that voice, to those commands. He pushed his cock into the frigid water and let Potter take his erection away, stroke by stroke. Not the hot way, because Potter apparently didn’t think he had earned that, but the cold cruel way.
Harry fucked in and out, over and over again to the sound of Draco’s pleas. Pleasure shot up his spine with every thrust, coiling inside him, building to climax. His mouth was dry and his bollocks were pulling up but when he reached underneath, Draco’s were just as high and tight. He didn’t touch Draco’s cock—he’d promised—but he was just as close as Harry and sounding ever more desperate by the thrust. He’d never be able to control himself.
"There’s no way Malfoy is into this." Harry gestured toward him, taking Draco in from his submissively bowed head to his bare-assed bum. "Him? A slave? No way."
Harry, who was kicked back on the sofa, looking utterly comfortable, grinned. "Look at him. He’s still hard and dripping, just like he was the whole way through. Better be careful he doesn’t run off with your detergent—I think he’s got a taste for it now."
"There’s a ring there, do you see it?" Charlie must be pointing. "Can you snap that onto his harness, secure his bollocks for me? Don’t want them flopping in the way when I’m blistering his arse."
At Charlie’s nod, Potter reached out and stroked his bollocks. The gossamer didn’t diminish sensation—if anything, it heightened it. Pain and pleasure both.
No. Harry had more soap and he started rubbing a new blasted swab all along the bottom row of his teeth, left to right, going back for more whenever the layer even slightly thinned. Gums too, then the top, left to right, and the inside as well as the outside, top and bottom.
will have a field day with it." Charlie felt Draco jerk and when he looked down Draco’s eyes had gotten possibly a little teary. Harry wanted him and he wanted the world to know it. That had to mean the world to Draco. "You ready to come out?"
Harry pulled off. Draco cried out and couldn’t hold back a sudden thrust forward but he didn’t come.  Harry licked his lips.
"Of course you were." Harry let his eyes flash down to Draco’s groin, grazing the spot where his cock must be so sadly confined.
Draco’s head fell back on Harry’s shoulder.  His lips were working, his tongue flickering out, wordless pleas falling from his mouth. Harry stroked Draco’s neck with one hand and worked his cock with the other, slow and steady strokes, each with a twist at the top.
Harry ran a hand through his hair but he looked pleased. "He doesn’t lack for reasons to get his backside tanned, does he?"
"What if there’s something he needs that you can’t manage and can’t bring in anyone else for? What if he needs to move on?"
Harry jerked and bit his lip as Draco sucked him down again. His voice stayed relatively steady though. "There was, well, something I might have thought about for a while. Didn’t see it in your contract."
Harry rubbed a finger across the slit, watched Draco bite his lip, then pumped faster, harder. Draco’s body tensed beneath him and his eyes flew open at last.
"First, though," Charlie said, heading back to the sofa and picking up his beer. "Let’s talk about slaves and contracts and all of that. You’ve got to have some questions."
Finally, the last shock tingled away and nothing remained but Draco’s slow whimpers. Harry pulled out carefully, leaving the silk behind. So sue him. He liked the way it looked. He rolled Draco over and pulled him into his arms, smoothing his hair back from his exhausted face.
Except—well, except the better he got at occlumency, the more the girl-related fantasies went away. Back in sixth year he’d told Ginny they had to break up because it wasn’t fair to her he had to go hunt Horcruxes. He hadn’t mentioned the fact that he was finding it harder and harder to want her soft mouth and her cushy breasts, let alone what was down below. It was fine, though—there was a war on and he was dedicated to fighting it. He didn’t want sex with her because he was a soldier, a man who lived to fulfill his destiny!
Oh bloody hell, no. Draco dearly wanted to shift in position, stamp his foot, something. Charlie headed back to the drawer with the pleasure of a man who’d found someone who could really appreciate the tools of the trade. Draco knew what was coming and he hated this one.
The first pulse shot straight down his throat and Harry cried out, hands holding Draco’s head so tight it hurt, making sure he controlled the angle to perfection. He pulled back with the second spurt, making sure he came all over Draco’s tongue, making sure the taste of Harry would mingle with the soap, and drip together down his throat. Then another thick spurt as Harry rubbed himself shamelessly on Draco’s tongue, shuddering out the end of his pleasure, helpless now that orgasm was on him.
"You handled him well. Better than I expected for a novice," Charlie said, continuing the mutual admiration club in which Draco apparently had a starring role as the pet, or maybe the inanimate object.
Thank Merlin Charlie’d come over at the ball to clink a glass. Before Harry could stop himself, he’d been babbling out,
"Not much. Maybe every now and then." Harry went back to palming his cock, watching Draco’s suck skills with lip-licking intensity. "Is he no good at it, then? Might be worth a discount."
Charlie nodded. "Nice, eh? It’s all that good breeding, I expect. Their blood might not be any better but they sure taste sweet."
She’d been spending a lot of time lately with Remus and Sirius, Harry realized. That was nice. Good to see Sirius socializing with the branch of the Black family that hadn’t cut him off. Of course, you know what they said about Blacks and their cousins—
Harry palmed his cock, stroking it idly while watching Draco suck. "I’m fine with it. I’d like it, actually, if he was mine. It was more the knowing that he wasn’t mine, that I might never have him again, that made me want to drag him off and tie him up and keep him."
Potter’s mouth, Potter’s tongue. His hand wrapped the back of Draco’s head, keeping him in place as Potter raped his mouth.  The blows never eased for a moment and he was crying now and babbling
Harry’s gut-felt groan was almost louder than Draco’s wail. They were both tensing, they were both so very, very close—
Harry willed his cock to stop twitching. Ever since last week, the scent of lavender had done terrible things to him.
Draco shuddered as a hard shock hit him. Harry could feel his bollocks tensing involuntarily, could feel the twitches in his thighs.
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s shoulder. "It was the best sex of my entire life. That’s why I was mad at you."
Finally Harry stopped, surveyed his work, and announced that he had cleaned every surface. His grip was still firm on Draco’s chin, mercifully preventing the nose pulls he would otherwise have suffered.
"What’s this for?" Harry smoothed a hand down Draco’s front, fingering the shift. "You haven’t told me yet."
"I believe you were in the process of explaining, possibly through grunts, exactly what was going through your mind last week?"
"Here," said Charlie, coming back holding up a small metal clip with an attached ring. "This is really nice for training as well as other situations where you want to maintain strict control."
"I want something more from you." Harry stood up and unzipped his jeans, pushing them down along with his pants. "Sorry, but you’re just too delicious with that soap-coated mouth. I keep thinking how smooth it’ll feel—"
"Who’s coming?" Draco asked after he’d been kneeling for a (not particularly long) while. His pose managed to convey irritated hauteur while still maintaining the most perfectly correct submissive posture.
"Yeah, he likes that one." Charlie reached out and grabbed it, then hauled Draco over his knee, arse up, legs wide and braced. He scooted along, moving them both until there was room for Draco to bury his face in the sofa cushions. "Really makes him wiggle, this one."
The redness of Draco’s face deepened. "Yes, I like it. All right? Yes, I’m attracted to him. Not that he’s perfect or anything—honestly, his hair could be a registered sanctuary for migrating birds—"
"Good," Draco agreed, looking absolutely boneless. Thoroughly debauched, really, in that pale, tousled way that only the natural aristocrat can manage.
"One more," Potter said. His hand ran through Draco’s hair, sending sparks all the way down to his groin. Draco fucking loved hands in his hair. "Come on, give it another kiss and add a little lick this time."
"Don’t worry, you can make it hurt, but it won’t compress enough to damage. You try it now," Charlie said. "Though it’s spelled to me, so you might need your wand—"
Draco’s hips began to thrust up. Not far—his bollocks were clamped too low for that. Each thrust ended with a hiss and but his head was tipping further back now, rocking in time with Harry’s strokes, and his eyes were closed in bliss.
"Well that’s all right then," Harry said. "I plan on being thorough—you should know that—but we’ll do it at a pace you can manage. Would it help if I held your head still?"
"Come on now, let’s get you down," Charlie said. The cane dropped from his hand. "You’ve been so good."
Harry slung an arm over Draco’s shoulder and gave him a squeeze, reassuring and warm. "And you’re coming with us, Malfoy. That’s an order."
Harry held Draco’s head still and thrust up into it, one, two, three times fast. Draco on his knees, eating out of Harry’s hand—as images went, that clearly worked for him.
There were two little silver clamps attached to rings on the floor. Harry eyed them with interest, measuring out what they might be meant for. Nipples, certainly, by the look of them. Harry pushed Draco forward and sure enough, they lined up exactly with those pale nubs. Draco’s eyes had fluttered closed and he was pliable, bending forward, forehead to the ground, clearly knowing this position well.
"Oi! Here’s Malfoy with your Friday night paperwork," Ron said, rolling his eyes at Harry. "Honestly mate, you’ve got no one to blame but yourself. You should’ve been firm with him right from the beginning. Give a git like that an inch and he’ll take a mile."
Fuck, fuck, fuck. Harry wanted him all over again. It would be easy to lube Draco up in this position, with his arsehole so exposed. To open up his hole and ream him without mercy.
Draco scrambled onto the table like the good boy he was. His hair was tousled and his mouth swollen. He looked utterly, thoroughly fuckable.
He led the way to the loo as slowly, then opened the door and brought Draco inside, settling him into the hosing area and clipping the leash to a handy ring. Low rails kept Draco’s kneeling legs apart, wide enough to make to pull his cheeks apart too.  Harry caught a sight of the silk still stuffed inside his hole, and almost blushed. Part of him still wanted to apologize, no matter how satisfied Draco looked. The other part just wanted to do it again.
If Harry’s cock hadn’t already been stiffening, that alone would have brought it to attention.  He mouthed at Draco’s shoulder with increasing need. "What about wet dreams? Seems a little unfair. That wouldn’t be your fault."
Assuming Harry was here to discuss what he thought. Charlie stood up, waving him over to the sofa, and sending Draco off to bring in drinks.  Harry took the armchair instead, settling into it a little stiffly. He was dressed formally too, Charlie noted, in dark tailored robes and dragonhide boots polished to a shine.
Potter intercepted them, making them swerve and come to him, landing in his arms in a snowy pile. Show-off. A wave of the wand and Draco was wrapped and mobilicorpsed across the room. Potter landed him so softly his arse didn’t even protest—well no more than it already was—and set things up next to the armchair.
It had been Charlie’s decision, in the end, to send Draco back to England when his probation ended and hell, that’d been a doozy of a fight. Hadn’t wanted him gone of course but Draco needed work that was right for him, and that would never be dragon-keeping.
Harry shrugged. "I get howlers whenever they link me with anyone. Way too many little old ladies living in little wizarding towns have very strong opinions on who I should be with. Mostly their granddaughters. So who cares if I get ten times the normal number of howlers? Hermione’s set a charm that
"Of course," Charlie said. "It’s one of the things I love about him." His fist turned to iron in Draco’s hair and all of a sudden he was dragging Draco down by the hair, his body following until he lay sprawled in front of Harry. "He just has to pay the price for it."
"Well we know you like it," Charlie said, throwing back another swallow of lager, "but let’s see what effect it had on him. Turn around then, pet, and give us a show."
Charlie felt a pang. He loved it when Draco played the petulant aristocrat. It made his hand itch and his cock swell and it invariably ended with that lovely bare arse over Charlie’s knee. Followed by a nice sound fuck. He’d miss that.
--and their favorite werewolves? No. Couldn’t be. Harry recalled himself to his task—pinning Malfoy to the wall (figuratively) and finding out why his knickers were in such a twist. He nodded himself pleasantly away from Remus and Tonks and began to circle the ballroom.
"It would," Draco admitted, feeling that he should be able to hold still himself—he was well-trained, dammit, but knowing he needed it. He couldn’t take another jolt to the nose.
"No, of course not," Charlie said. "I make mistakes—everyone does—and I let him know I’m sorry. There’s no sense pretending to be perfect. It’s a lie and lies kill the trust that’s crucial for this. It’s good instinct to apologize, admit it, and then try not to do it again."
"First of all, the contract ends anytime either of us wants it to. I won’t keep an unconsenting slave and even if he wants to stay, if I find the perfect match for him, I’ll try to get it for him."
Potter sank down, steadying himself with a hand in Draco’s hair, taking the place of Charlie’s. He leaned forward and whispered in Draco’s ear. "Come on. You can do it. It would please me so much if you did."
Harry eyed the bed and bit his lip. Probably not good manners to return your host’s slave covered in sweat and come. There was only so much a cleaning charm could do, too. He reached up and touched the chain where it met the bedpost. "Come on. I need to wash you up."
And god, oh, now Potter was opening his arse-crack, rubbing him down there too. The cloth kissed across his hole and it was all he could do not to moan out loud. Potter was moving on, though, down his legs, though Draco noticed a conspicuous omission to the cleaning: Potter had left his own come where it had trickled out the arse and down the inside of his leg.
