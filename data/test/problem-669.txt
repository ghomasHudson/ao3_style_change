He lies about his ability to bring the Death Eaters into the school… until that awful moment when he isn’t lying anymore, and he turns a werewolf loose among his classmates. When he lets Death Eaters into his school to torture and maim. That ends with Dumbledore dead and Draco running for his life.

But… the Weasleys are the only family he has.
The woman behind the counter is saggy in all the wrong places, her greying hair sporting two light blue stripes that frame her face. She has an eyebrow ring, two nose rings, and three rings piercing her lower lip. “What can I get you, love?” she asks.
Oddly… even worryingly… Potter stops trying to reclaim his hand. He just watches Draco with wary eyes.
Draco was trembling, and Harry caught his arm. “He won’t do that again,” he said, almost harshly. “I won’t let him.”
“It doesn’t have to, Harry. You’re
what you did… and I know why you did it…. I love you, Draco. I think I always have.”
He screamed for his father to let him out of the cell… hunger ripped at his belly and he screamed. He screamed for his mother to do something…
. Harry, it hurt
slowly, Draco moves his mouth toward Harry’s. Harry is still. He doesn’t move and he doesn’t blink, and when their lips meet, the kiss is sweet and chaste.
“I’ll go get you another cup of tea,” Ron says.
“Breathe. Relax, Harry, please. For me.”
He looks up, his eyes still replaying the nightmare that woke him as the firelight shadows dance across his face. He doesn’t say anything. Maybe he can’t.
welling in his chest. He is only ever happy on Sundays. Today is Tuesday.
Malfoy snaps down the lid of his travel mug. “I know,” he says, giving Harry a tired smile. “Thanks.”
The next thing he knows he’s burst through Malfoy’s door. It bounces against the wall… and Malfoy, who had been curled up on the bed reading, looks up, startled and wary.
“Shhhh…,” Harry wraps his arms around him and presses his lips to his shoulder. “It’s okay.”
She smiles. Somewhat impishly. “A Welsh Green. My mother fought one once, you know.”

Draco can’t read Harry’s expression: on the one hand, the heated look he is giving Draco is making his own blood warm and his cock perk up expectantly, but on the other… Harry looks as if he fears Draco is going to start shouting and cursing things at any moment.
“Look,” she says, and he has to take a step back, covering his nose with his hand; her perfume suddenly seems to be assaulting him, “why don’t you go sit down for a bit? Rest a little. We’re not busy, and I’d rather have you not faint—or vomit!—behind my counter.”

people, healing hurts, seen and unseen, with whispered words. Gentle fingers wash his hair, pulling free the tangles as they do. There is nothing sexual about Harry’s touch… and it is the most intimate thing that has happened to Draco in years.
happening.
Nothing.
Harry is collapsed, more on him than next to him, and his beautiful eyes, laced with tears, are watching him. When Draco meets them, they hold his eyes… and Draco holds Harry’s back.
Draco believes him. “Don’t,” he says. “Really.” Draco’s head falls forward into his hands. “I don’t want you to. I just want to put it all behind me and never think about it again.”
Malfoy watches. Silently.
“Just tired. Late night, you know. Exams are coming soon.”

Draco is bolder in the theoretically public space that is the common room. He finds himself rubbing against Harry, the friction perfection. He reaches down, grasping Harry through his jeans, and Harry moans, low in his throat.

“So you can fuck me out of the cold? I don’t think so, Potter. I said I’d take you if you came back… I doubt I’ll be in a position to say no. But you’re going to have do it on a dirty fucking street corner like everyone else.”
He can separate the sensations… his cheek against the rough floor, scraping minutely back and forth, burning… something warm and wet trickling down his leg that a more detached part of his brain identifies as blood… and the rhythm, terrible and insistent, each thrust sending red and yellow starbursts to smash into the backs of his closed eyelids.
“Okay… okay.”
When Draco opens his eyes, Harry is looking up at him… his mouth wet and red and in a shape that could be a smile. Or a look of pure awe. “I love you,” Harry says.
“Harry, love, I don’t know. She’s right, though. You have

“I want you naked. Lying down. On this bed.”
“Yes, thank you.” Draco breathed. “What… how did you do that?”
. There is too much noise.
“Now, Severus, I understand that you are fluent in both German and French?”
Of course, Harry Potter
Draco shakes his head and Harry’s mouth descends… slowly, carefully. So gentle… so much longing. It is a first kiss.
“You know, those lattes you like are crap. Cloying.”
Severus watched the magical lash fall against the boy’s bare back…
“I know a good cleaning charm.” Draco can hear the smile in Harry’s words. “Please. I want you to come for me.”

He sits down on the piano bench and drops his face into his hands.

The woman behind the counter has abandoned her blue stripes and dyed all her hair a vivid pink. “Cappuccino, love?” she asks him.
“Madam Pomfrey gave me some books,” he says quietly. “Professor McGonagall wrote a letter of recommendation for me… for St. Mungo’s. When they rejected me she even went down in person… but… Well, there wasn’t anything she could do… I think she asked Madam Pomfrey to send the books. I think she asked Hermione to help me get into the Muggle course.”

Harry’s arms come around Draco as Draco holds him close, rubbing his back, making shushing noises, and kissing Harry’s forehead over and over.

“Is that Healer Mitchell in spell damage, or Healer Mitchell in obstetrics?”
“You were in the graveyard… lying in the grass. Bleeding. That was when these happened, right?”
“That’s true.”
“All right, Mr. Potter,” she says. “Nothing’s really jumping out at me as being the cause of your symptoms. You get dressed while I take a peek at these samples. Then we’ll chat.”
Harry Potter had saved him from Azkaban, but he couldn’t give him back his wand, couldn’t get him a job anywhere within the magical community, and couldn’t change the fact that he still had to pay 10,000 galleons in war reparations.
Draco can’t help himself.
She’s smiling at him. “Now, I have something I want to say, and I do apologize if I’m speaking out of turn, but I’ve been watching you these past few weeks… and, well…  dear, is there any chance you could be pregnant?”
“Potter…” Draco isn’t sure what to say. “Why would you want that?”
Draco picks up the top one… and stares. It’s one of mine, speckled grey clay fired with real hawthorn leaves still pressed into the clay. The ghosts of the leaves, perfect shadows, are left behind.
The days turn hot and they sit their N.E.W.T.S.
“I have to tell you, Potter, you look like shit this morning.”
The mental image Draco has of himself is his head tilted suggestively, one eyebrow raised elegantly, peering at Potter through lowered eyelashes. But he knows damn well that both eyebrows have just shot up in surprise; he’ll be lucky if his mouth isn’t hanging open.

Draco lets himself be held a moment longer. If he said he wasn’t crying, just a little, he would be lying.

It’s true, Draco realizes. It is absolutely true.
I roll back over and close my eyes and tell myself that Potter is an eighteen-year-old wizard, more than capable of fighting through his own nightmares. It’s not true though and a moment later, I’m flinging back my own blankets and padding into the common room.
But he couldn’t bring himself to
Sometimes he tells himself that it’s because he loves his job—and he does!—but really it’s because he wants to be seen as someone other than
“Ah, that’s right,” Professor Hastings says. “Excellent school. We were very lucky to get Mr. Malfoy, here. Were you on the rugby team, also, Mr. Potter?”
Healer Mitchell makes no such promises. In fact, it rather seems he is promising Harry’s painful demise.
He sits down.
“And how are you?” I ask. “How are your parents…?”
She says it firmly. Almost matter-of-factly. As if it’s
“You’ll be fine,” he whispers into Harry’s hair. “I promise.”

“Is this what you want?” he whispers.
He’s exhausted, but not sleepy… and feels gritty and knows he smells less than fresh. He never changed into pajamas last night… and has now been wearing the same clothes for almost thirty-six hours straight.
Harry is afraid he will say no.
Harry’s made a fiddly sort of dinner, the kind he excels at, but genuinely hates to cook: Fish with an artichoke-tomato vinaigrette beside grilled vegetables, and potatoes, roasted to perfection with fresh herbs and asiago cheese. There is crusty bread and flavored oil to dip it in, and a pile of greens… because Draco loves them.

Ron pushed open the door to the bedroom Harry and Malfoy were sharing and felt the silencing spell shatter around him.

It didn’t burn. At least not in the way scalding dishwater burned.
Harry is crying now, tears running down his cheeks.
Harry crosses the street.

He arrives back in his flat with a tiny “pop.”
“I’m starving,” I say, perhaps rudely, cutting Draco off.
“She is. She’s home now. But… I said I’d… pick up Victoire… anyway…”
“Stairs. Oh, fuck!”
“Yeah.”
My invisibility cloak stays hanging in my closet.
“This isn’t a room big enough for all four of us,” he said, ignoring Harry’s furious look. He directed his gaze to Malfoy instead. “And Hermione’s afraid to sleep in this house alone. It’s nothing personal… it’s just a precaution, yeah?”
“Will I?”
“Yeah…” Harry frowns. “Might need a shower, really. And probably to toss these pants into the laundry. Do you want to go first?”

Harry clamps a hand over his mouth, determined not to sick-up in the waiting room of St. Mungo’s. The subtle, yet cooling, scent of mint washes over him… masking the cologne… settling his stomach.
Half an hour later the Granger-Weasley family has gone home and Draco is alone in the bookshop. He walks through it one last time. Everything is in order, of course. The children’s section is immaculate, not that he ever doubted Rose.
Draco expected lessons in torture and murder and other unbearable things… instead Macnair led him up to the guest wing and to the room he had claimed for his own.

“Come on, then. I refuse to die of hypothermia on this floor with my pajamas slowly gluing themselves to my leg.” He tries for a drawl, but thinks he’s failed. “Also, I was promised a cleaning charm.”
It was decided that Draco, with his moonbeam hair, alabaster skin, and eyes like molten silver should spend his time working as a high-end prostitute.

Charlie doesn’t release him, but he blinks… and one tear falls, trickling into his beard, as all the tension drains from his hands. He takes a breath that is at least part sob, but Harry can’t tell how much is relief and how much is regret. Charlie’s next kiss is gentle. Barely more than the brushing of lips.
For the time being, I have one more bit to share with you.
But Draco is lightning fast… he’s almost the best Seeker in the school. He’s only ever lost a Quidditch match to Harry Potter. And, right now, Potter looks like he couldn’t even fly a broom, much less play Quidditch. Much less beat Draco at anything.
His dark shirt and trousers… his robes… they will hide the telltale bruises that have blossomed on his arm… on his hip.

Harry is surprised to find himself waiting for Malfoy to come into the coffee shop… something he does most days, often twice a day. Malfoy the nursing student is soft-spoken and kind—he always holds the door for people, never places an order without a “please” and “thank you”, and once Harry watched him chase a woman half-way down the block, holding the pink stuffed bunny that had fallen from her child’s pram.
The children of the Death Eaters and their sympathizers were remanded to the custody of the newly formed Reparations Company, Incorporated… for a period of time to be determined by the crimes of their parents. They were stripped of all legal rights—stripped of their very

She’s thrilled. She adores him. He’s changed so much since the war, she insists.
“Ginny’s hoping to get signed by the Harpies,” Harry tells him.
Draco is enthralled. It doesn’t take him long to understand why this film is one of Potter’s favorites.
He was trying to open a carton of… something… and the knife slipped, cutting his hand rather badly. Which is how he’s found himself, seated on a bench in the park around the corner from the coffee shop, his hand being cradled between Malfoy’s.

O’Brien’s eyebrows rise… she has a ring in one of them that Harry hadn’t noticed before.

Draco’s wondering, too. Over the years he’s learned to work magic with his mouth… but to kiss like a lover? If he ever knew, he’s long forgotten how.

Harry climbs into the chair, under the horrible blanket, and Draco thinks Weasley enlarges the chair a bit more. As soon as Draco feels Harry’s arms around him, he falls asleep.
“Not too bad. Yourself?”
It was like being hit with a bucket of very cold water.
“You’re back,” Draco whispered.
“You should go to bed,” he says, tracing Harry’s cheek. “You look exhausted.”
“It’s Draco,” Harry says helplessly. “Maybe it always has been.”
“I thought you’d be back for this,” he says, his voice is gravely and pleasant. “You’ve read the first two, I take it?”
“Yes!”
“Harry… I…”

He smiles. He graciously accepts their thanks and praise. He doesn’t shrink into Draco’s side as a flashbulb goes off around them.
Harry is sitting on the floor in front of the fire, legs pulled up in front of him, staring at the flames.
“Trust me, Harry.”
He laughs, nodding at the rumpled bed Harry is still sitting in.
“But… my mom was Muggle…so maybe…”

Draco’s heart is pounding, but the frantic rhythm seems to be the exact opposite of terror. “Yes?” Draco hears himself say.
Draco draws himself up. And tries to make his next words come out with some authority. He is a prefect, after all. And a Malfoy. Someday he’ll be one of the leading figures of the Wizarding World.
It had been over a week since he had seen him bleeding in the graveyard. What had happened to him? Was he even still alive? Harry wanted…

“They’re treating you well?” he asks.
Had they been waiting for him to leave the drawing room alone and slightly sickened by the antics of the Dark Lord? Had the attack been motivated by lust… or retaliation? Draco can’t recall anyone he has, personally, slighted but there are a great many people angry with Lucius Malfoy at the moment.
I turn out the light. Draco pulls the door shut.
“It’s going to be okay.” He is cupping Draco’s cheek, ever so gently… his fingers tracing his jaw. And Draco finds that he doesn’t mind the touch. He leans into it. “I promise.”

At first Charlie leads the way, with Harry following, mutely, behind… then shoulder-to-shoulder, and finally holding hands. Words become a part of Harry’s life again. He doesn’t talk about the War… about England… about the people he left behind, but he will call out, drawing Charlie’s attention to a particularly brilliant leaf or a stone that sparkles in the creek bed. Harry begins to sleep at night, and when his nightmares get the better of him, he lets Charlie hold him close, smoothing his hair, whispering words he doesn’t understand, words said with rhythm, but no melody; they could be Cornish, they could be Romanian… Harry can’t tell, and doesn’t ask. He just snuggles closer. Even at night, Charlie smells like sunshine… and leather and singed fabric.
“Shhh…” Harry presses a finger to Draco’s lips. “I knew you would run late. And I knew how much you wanted to wear those tonight.”
“You remembered.”

Draco stares at him. It’s not that he doesn’t already know these things. But he doesn’t

Draco pulls Harry even closer, right into his lap, wrapping his arms around him, and letting him bury his face into Draco’s neck. The fire is warm, orange and yellow flames dancing, with an occasional flicker of blue. He presses a kiss to Harry’s temple. “I love you.”
“But…”
Ron frowns. “What are you even doing here, Kreacher? I thought Harry told you to stay at Hogwarts?”

She smiles up at him. If she knows he is lying, she gives no indication. Narcissa Malfoy sits at the head of the table, looking every inch the gracious hostess… not like her husband is in Azkaban… not like her home is overrun with Death Eaters… not like she is terrified.

“But no one can get near her! She’s scheduled to be put down.”

to refuse a client—and if a client is refusing him… it amounts to the same thing. If Potter does what Draco thinks he’s about to do… Draco will pay for it.
Not a lie. But, perhaps, not the truth either.
He would have been quite invisible to anyone who wasn’t looking for him.
“You want a real relationship, so your friends buy you a whore? Nice.”
Gratefully, Draco slips off the pinching shoes and sets his foot firmly on the floor. And, feeling utterly ridiculous in his ribbons and fishnets, but somehow unwilling to put the coat back on either, he pads after Potter.
Draco hears himself sigh as he pulls his fingers gently across Potter’s cheek… and away. “My time isn’t my own.”
They are standing only a few feet apart… separated by cold iron bars and seven years of animosity… hexes… cruel words… by hands not shaken….

I can’t see him; he’s behind me. But I can
O’Brien looks at him. Questioning. Harry wonders just how high those eyebrows can go.
“Oh, Cuthbert,” Draco says in a voice that is a practiced combination of throaty and breathy.
“What is it then?”
The boy was breathing. And making ragged little noises that might have been stifled sobs… or a death rattle. Severus wasn’t sure.

. He enjoys the first one, but he feels that parts of the second book hit too close to home; he does not read the third.
“Hi,” he says.
He lets Harry, somewhat belligerently, work out the technicalities of the adoption papers.
“Harry, I can’t. You
Draco opens his mouth to say something, but stops as Mr. Ainsworth holds up an age-spotted hand.
“Come along, imp,” he says. “Let’s take you to your mother. Apparently Harry and I have some happily ever after to be getting to.”
“Eloquent, as always, Potter. But, maybe you could let me in now? It’s colder than a witch’s britches out here… and I am wearing rather substantially

know, but he nods intelligently. He’s of the opinion that the shiny red one that Harry’s gaze lingers over would suit him perfectly.
He’s gone in a puff of green and sooty smoke.
“I… erm… Thanks.”

“Yes… please,” Draco whispers, sounding a little strangled.
you, Harry Potter. I wouldn’t have done it.”
“It’s hard to imagine the Savior of the Wizarding World having trouble finding a partner,” Draco says, a barb in his voice that he doesn’t bother trying to hide.
“I love you. Okay? I’m not going to stop.”
With an unhurried slip of tongue and teeth, Harry releases the finger. “Then you’ll add another finger, and it might burn just a tiny little bit, but it will feel
Harry opens his mouth, and then shuts it again.
The first thing he sees is a pair of dark chocolate eyes, looking intently at him.
Because, while he can easily imagine a life without Voldemort, he
The sound Draco makes sounds wounded, and Harry stops… stops moving his tongue in the way that he bloody well
He suspects the clothes are a not-so-subtle hint that he should actually go out of the house… further than the garden.
“Okay. Draco…”
My hands are shaking. My breath is coming short. My heart is quivering in my chest. Maybe he doesn’t really want anything to do with me. Maybe he only came over yesterday because he thought I wouldn’t be able to take proper care of Victoire.
We did both.
“He can’t have,” Weasley said. “Moody put a tongue-tying curse on him. He can’t have told anyone.”
The cool air hits Draco as he steps inside. Coffee, chocolate, and the rosy perfume of the older woman sitting by the door reach his nose and he breathes in deeply. Pleasurably. She glances up, sees their joined hands, and gives them a small smile before returning to her book.
He presses his face into Harry’s shoulder, holds on tightly, and breathes.
“Y-yeah, I do,” Draco breathes.
“I heard everything you said.”
Every day people fuck him, use him, hurt him if they want… and Draco lets them because it is his job. Because he has no choice. But just for today, Draco is going to cherish every touch, every moment… because this is
“Will you tell me about the time you, Uncle Ron and Auntie ‘Mione rode that dragon? Please? For my bedtime story?”
I ran into Draco Malfoy in an uninteresting little Muggle pub. It was early in the evening and he was sitting at the bar nursing—of all things—a Carlsberg.

“They loved you. And I love you. And I’m not going to leave you. I promise.”

The table is clean at any rate and I watch as he opens the sack, pulling out cartons of rice and curried lamb, chicken masallah, beef vindaloo.
“Hey… come here.” Harry sits on a large rock, pulling Draco down beside him. The rock isn’t wet… but it isn’t dry either. Harry presses a long kiss onto Draco’s forehead… then kisses the corner of his eye… then kisses down the trail of tears that Draco hadn’t know he was crying… and finds his lips.
Harry palms the tears off his face. “I actually have something for you, too.”
With a final, farewell hoot, the owl takes off. Carrying a note containing only three words.
Weasley releases him, and Draco turns, heading for his bedroom. For the chair by the window. For safety.
“Yes.” It might have sounded a touch defensive. I
Draco can’t say the words.
“Harry, you’re supposed to be
“I am.” He’s starving actually—though it feels odd, unnatural, maybe, to say it out loud.

Draco stretches up again for one more kiss. “Now, let me get back to this,” he says.
“Than wearing my jeans?” Weasley said, striding into the room, followed closely by Potter.
Potter’s three hours are just about up.
He imagines kneeling before Harry, taking him into his mouth, watching him come undone before him. For him.
Screams tore from his throat as he fell.

“You still think pretty highly of yourself, don’t you Malfoy? Well, come here. Let’s see if you’re worth it.”
Malfoy’s eyes raise to meet Harry’s.
Severus had learned long ago that it was pointless to try to anticipate Voldemort—and there was precisely nothing he could do to spare the boy in any case—but Severus found that his heart ached for the pale, trembling boy who was about to learn, for the first time, what it
Potter wants him. Potter wants
He swallows, and swallows again, and does.

And Harry’s lips are for kissing… and Draco can’t quite get enough.
But when has he ever had even half a chance with Potter?
What if she

“I don’t want to be an Auror.” Harry says it quickly, and his words are sharp, as if he is throwing away something he has long held on to.
Safety.
Draco hands him a tall glass full of cool water.
In the post-Voldemort world, it isn’t enough that the Dark Lord is dead… and that the worst of his Death Eaters will die in Azkaban. It doesn’t matter that the term “Death Eater” is thrown around so casually as to have caught an alarming number of Slytherin House alumni and pureblood families in its snare… sometimes with no evidence of ever having associated with the Dark Lord or any of his followers.

He Floos into their flat with only moments, really, to get ready for yet another Ministry gala, which is just part of dating Harry Potter.
“Er…,” Harry turns back to the woman behind the counter. “So the chocolate cake… and… erm… a slice of cherry cheesecake, too, please.”
There was no light. And Draco hadn’t made a sound.
Draco’s hand drops.
And Potter knows it.
A solid dome of noise hangs over the schoolyard.
Draco feels hot tears spilling out of his eyes. “I want to make you happy,” he whispers, not looking at Harry.
The store is always quiet, but with a steady trickle of customers.
true.
He moves his thumb and replaces it with his lips. He teases Harry’s mouth open, letting his tongue do what his body can’t and Harry moans, arching up again.
Draco wanted to just keep lying on the stone floor, maybe allow a few of the threatening tears to leak out, to keep Potter’s hand on his shoulder… but he knew he had to move. Without giving voice to any of the painful sounds that wanted so badly to escape him, he forced himself to sit up.
The fire is all around me. Hot. It hurts to breathe. And Harry Potter is flying towards me… reaching out for me… his hand closing around mine.
All Draco can do is nod.
“You saw the paper, then?”
~*~*~*~
Either that, or thinking about flinging Draco onto the bed and undoing all the work he’s just done.
No one is watching him closely… no one is acting oddly at all. But, then, he isn’t either.
Still, the last time Draco had come face-to-face with him, Potter had literally sliced him open.
And if suddenly Harry’s clothes all lose their rumpled look… well, both he and Harry pretend not to notice.
Marching might be overstating the matter a little.
Draco put his head down on the flags. It was just too much trouble to hold it up at the moment. He wasted a few moments trying to find a way to lie that wasn’t pressing on one bruise or another… before giving it up as a bad job and just let the pressure build.
“Sir should be taking these to Miss Hermione. Miss is studying too hard… Miss is not eating enough.”
“I’m looking for you, you know,” Harry says quietly. “Even if it’s only so you can slam the door in my face… I have to know.
“I… yeah. That’d be great. Thanks.”
“And…

—and placed in settings that would be most lucrative to the Company.
“What do you want, Harry?”
He goes to the market and returns with piles of fresh vegetables. The kitchen always smells like spices.
Better silk, Draco tells himself, than stained and scratchy cotton. He even believes it—sort of. But sold is sold.
Harry awakes in stages… a strange sensation is moving through him… he feels
“Why would I mind?” He is using his professional voice now. “That was very kind of you. I’m sure she’s exhausted.”
“You don’t know… It

it, Hermione!” Harry cried, pressing his forehead down on Draco’s head and clutching him tighter.
It’s an uncomplicated dinner—just chicken, roast potatoes, mushy peas… and an apple crumble with real whipped cream.
Harry is offering absolute, wordless proof that every endearment, every touch, has been the truth.
Draco nods, glancing at the door, though no one is coming through it.
Draco slips a finger down the waistband of Harry’s pajamas, and brings it back out, glistening with milky fluid. He tastes it and it is musky and bitter and brilliant.
Draco sits, wishes he hadn’t, and then stays put because standing isn’t really an option for him at the moment.
Harry wonders just how old
believe that he had been tortured… starved. Malfoy had always been thin, but now he was damn near emaciated, all bone and haunted eyes.
“You have to please me?” There’s a thread of anticipation running through Potter’s voice. “You have to do whatever I want?”
“More?” His voice sounds raw. Not professional at all.
“I… I’m not… oh… oh

“That is the general idea, Potter.”
Harry whose eyes are the brightest green… though the darkness is absolute and Draco cannot see them… Draco knows they are shining at him. For him.
Her name was Elladora, she’d said, and she was offering him a position in what she called a house of pleasure. He hadn’t expected it to be pleasurable for
Another drink. Maybe two.
There he was, Harry thought. He was alive and whole.
Harry is kissing him.  His mouth presses against his shoulder again and again before moving along his back… to his other shoulder… soft and gentle, with an occasional touch of tongue.
“Lucius, find a cell for the boy and leave him there. You will have no contact with him after that.” The Dark Lord fixed his gaze on Narcissa, who flinched. “Is that understood?”

Draco’s wineglass is empty. So is mine.

“I… thank you.”
“Good morning, Harry,” Weasley says brightly. “And how did
It fits comfortably in the palm of his hand, slightly fuzzy, and warm. Incongruously warm; it might be the only warm thing in the whole prison. And it’s like holding his own little bit of sunshine.

Without waiting to be dismissed, Kreacher sketches out a barely respectful bow and disappears.
“I wouldn’t have hidden it from you. If it was yours I would have told you as soon as I found out. I would have come back.”
The boy didn’t seem to know where to place his eyes and they flicked from the ground before his feet to the Dark Lord and, on occasion, to where his parents were standing—Lucius, passive; Narcissa, her legendary composure failing her, her arm tightly in her husband’s grasp—with the waiting Death Eaters.
“Now, you do have a
I think I make a small noise, but if I do, Harry doesn’t notice.

“I love you, Harry Potter.”
A rich, flourless cake, drizzled with ganache and topped with fresh raspberries sits on the sideboard.
The sunrise is terrifying in its beauty.
Draco is torn between endless warm water and rudeness… but settles for soaping himself twice—to catch the last of the glitter, he tells himself, rather than indulgence—and scrubbing his hair. Potter’s shampoo is surprisingly high-quality and smells of citrus and lavender. The towels are soft, and the clothes he’s left out are… comfortable, a pair of too-short joggers and another Harpies t-shirt… that seems to have the smells of sunshine, pine forest, and a deep, musky scent woven into its very fibers.
The words hang unsaid between them.
Thank you to everyone who left comments on Chapter One! I love questions, comments, and constructive criticism!!!

Draco cradles Harry, who doesn’t even feel like he has the strength to
Hermione is still holding the market bag, looking stunned. The man seems to be contemplating bananas. The other shoppers are simply… shopping.
“No,” I say. “I don’t suppose she would.”
“Kreacher is not sorry. Kreacher lives to serve Harry Potter and the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black. Master Harry and Master Draco is needing each other.”
Before Draco decided not to show up for their normal after-curfew meeting, before Harry followed him into the bathroom, before Draco pointed his wand at Harry and shouted,
“And…?”
It’s a gentle kind of kiss… made up of hearts, not fire.
remember.
Harry snuggles even closer into Draco’s chest and doesn’t say anything else.
Draco drops his mouth to Harry’s kissing him almost roughly. “I will always come back to you. I love you.”
Draco looks up into the face of Ronald Weasley. The voice. The softness fades a little; Draco isn’t ready to deal with edges.
He’s not making a judgment… both of them avoided Azkaban. But he is here, holding Harry’s hand as tightly as Harry is holding his.
“You don’t know how much I wanted to use my mouth,” he whispers, almost afraid to say it out loud. It’s the truth, though. “How much I wanted to taste all of you.”
owl, she’s Draco’s, so that helps. She’s a smallish Tawney who doesn’t like to be petted and often stares down her beak at him. In a way, she reminds Harry of a thirteen-year-old Draco Malfoy… and he finds that oddly comforting.
“But…” He stops, looking crestfallen, and nods slowly.
Draco can do nothing but climb into the bed. He allows Harry to take his hand… to interlace their fingers. He doesn’t know how long they sit there, Harry’s thumb making small movements across the back of his own hand. Silent. Except for the rain that is falling in a steady dripping sound off the roof and past their window.

He is passing the bookshop when he hears a familiar voice.

Draco doesn’t move or turn his head, but he knows Harry is watching. He feels the tingle of magic and the dry dog biscuits become something squishier and smellier and probably a lot more enticing to a hungry dog.

It must be morning.
For a moment they say nothing. Harry takes another sip of water before carefully setting it down.

“I didn’t kill you!” the rags gasped.
“How do you…? In the hospital, I mean, knowing you could save someone with a wave of your wand… how do you
Draco doesn’t want to let it go… Harry can tell. He’s almost vibrating with the need to ask more questions. Instead Draco takes a deep breath.
Harry likes him, admires him, maybe, and he can’t help but wonder if this Malfoy is even new at all… was he always there, and without Voldemort insuring that they were born enemies would he have seen it right away? Would they have been friends?
Draco’s mouth catches Harry’s and he nips lightly at Harry’s lower lip until Harry opens his mouth to him. Sneaky fingers slide up under the shirt, his hands ghosting Harry’s ribs and chest, barely touching. He gently thumbs a nipple. “Oh yes. Take it off. The pants too.”
Draco dropped the glass, which shattered on the floor, as black spots swam before his eyes. He clutched the Dark Mark, biting back screams.

Antonie drops his napkin on the table and rises. His plate disappears in the magic of the house elves. “See you later, Draco,” he says, striding from the dining room.
Harry doesn’t sleep, but stays… watching the fire… his fingers wrapped around whatever earthenware vessel he has most recently been handed. The cabin is dark, its windows tiny, but sunlight streams in when Charlie opens the door.

He leans over to kiss Harry. Harry doesn’t try to touch him… with anything other than his tongue, which strokes Draco’s own tongue, licks gently at his lips… almost, but not quite, making Draco forget what he is doing.

Draco’s guards release his bindings. And he slowly makes his way over to where Harry Potter is standing.

It was her hair the Dark Lord sent him… to remind him that he was failing in his mission to kill Dumbledore. If it hadn’t been for that lock of hair… would he have joined the side of Light and fought alongside Harry? Would his mother be dead right now? Would he? Would he and Harry have run away to New Zealand and left the British Wizarding World to deal with the Dark Lord on their own?
I adore kudos and comments!!! <3

A crush like Elladora’s silencing curse closes around his throat. He blinks at the man.

And he was telling the truth when he promised Draco that everything would be all right. Draco is cleared of most charges and pardoned of the rest. He is to spend the summer with his mother and return to Hogwarts for Eighth Year.

“I know,” Draco says. He knows he’s lost his mind—and apparently the owl knows, too.
With a swish of Harry’s wand, Draco conjures the papers and stacks them as neatly as possible on the desk. Beside his own books. They sit there, together, crumpled papers and immaculate textbooks… a perfect sort of balance. Or things that have no business sharing the same space.

Possibly even epically late.
As always, thank you for reading! Remember, writers are fed with comments and kudos!
The fire is electric, but still gives out warmth and a friendly crackling sound, and when his shift is over, he likes to take a cup of chai tea and curl up before it on one of the ratty armchairs to read one of the tattered books.

for spices these days. He’s eaten more naan that any one person should be able to eat… ever.
“An orphanage?”
Draco uses his fingertips, and a bit of nail, to trace patterns on Harry’s back and chest and Harry shivers under his touch. Draco can feel the gooseflesh and pulls one hand out of the shirt to run his fingers down the inside of Harry’s arm… and is rewarded with a sharp gasp of pleasure. “Self-preservation, self-discovery, self-indulgence, maybe, because this is something I have been wanting to do for a very,
Draco doesn’t know how many times he endured the man’s touch… but the last time…

Hermione laughs, a sound that reminds Draco of both bells and bubbles. She doesn’t do it very often, at least not around Draco, but the sound can never keep him from smiling in return.
“Your boyfriend, then.”
“I… I’ll think about it.”
Harry looks down… away. Is he happy? Has he ever been, truly, happy? Would he even recognize happiness if he felt it?
“The Horcruxes were real then?” Malfoy’s voice waivers slightly.
It’s more than.
Harry’s fingertips rest lightly on the tops of Draco’s bare feet. One finger is making gentle, sneaky circles on his leg, just above the hem of his pajamas… but he is otherwise completely motionless.
is, but it had better not be one of those new-fangled terms used to insult or intimidate people these days.”
Part of Harry wanted to prepare for the attack that he knew was imminent; if Malfoy was here, that meant other Death Eaters would be arriving at any moment… but part of him could not tear his eyes away from the boy on the floor.
“Would he have been the same if he’s been raised by people who understood him… or by parents who loved him anyway?”
A man’s mouth on his cock…
Shit.
For a moment Malfoy just looks at him,
He’s had his moment of weakness; it must be over now.

Harry leads him to the bathroom and starts the shower. He helps Draco take off the robes and step into the streaming water.

Draco has adopted what Harry would consider a “lecture” tone. He sounds like Hermione.

“Are you sure you’re up for the trip?”
Draco is there, at the coffee shop, studying. His exams are coming up with the speed, and apparently the force, of a freight train… making him testy. The dark circles under his eyes rival Harry’s. He has his notes (color coded!) spread out on the table before him, and he is nibbling at the end of his pen, looking like they very opposite of the Draco Malfoy he knew and hated from his Hogwarts days.
“Of course I can tell… You’re not

“No!”
“How much for your arse, then?”
The second time Draco sees one of his clients, he is at the market with Granger, debating with her the merits of oranges versus grapefruits as a breakfast fruit. The man is across the way, his cart piled high with the sorts of boxes and packages that are no longer allowed in the Grimmauld Place kitchen.

Like they did when they were sixteen. They were arguing. Harry shoved Draco. Or did Draco shove Harry? It hardly matters. One moment they were on the verge of fighting, the next they were grinding against each other. Then there was a kiss that was all teeth and tongues… and then they were coming all over each other’s fingers.
He isn’t. The healing and nourishing potions have been working miracles… but Draco is far, far from healed.

The day he scorched one of Uncle Vernon’s shirts, Aunt Petunia held the hot iron to his palm and then locked him in his cupboard for three days straight. When she let him out to use the bathroom, he was able to gulp some water from the tap. There was no food.
“Thanks.”

“I’m sure it’s out of tune.”
Draco’s words came out sounding almost matter-of-fact, but his hands are shaking violently as he brings the mug to his mouth.
She makes the drink and hands it to him with a smile that’s a bit too knowing.
“He just wasn’t in a place where he could really be
“I suppose.” Malfoy looked as though he might want to ask Harry to leave again, but in the end he just turned back to the mirror and began to undo the buttons of his shirt.
Malfoy is still holding his hand… pressed between his own. His fingers haven’t completely stopped moving, but almost. The two girls are still on the merry-go-round, giggling as they spin.

The Death Eater’s hand was disarmingly gentle as it passed over his collarbone, up his neck, and along his jaw. Suddenly, and without warning, Draco found a pair of fingers thrust roughly into his mouth.

“I want… to do something to help. I want to make a place for Muggleborns who don’t have their parents to take care of them… or if they can’t. Wizarding children, too, if they need a home.”
Draco’s playing something soft… something light… and his hands move up and down the keyboard teasing out a melody that reminds Harry of a friendly creek tumbling over stones… of the way the sunlight would dance on that water… of early fall leaves drifting down, becoming little boats…

He really has chosen all my favorites. The wine is light and white, and with a practiced wand movement, Draco has added just the right amount of chill.
Draco doesn’t know his name… and studiously avoids reading the photo’s caption or any of the text.

The passion in Harry’s eyes crashes over Draco like a wave and Draco turns into it, embracing it. Harry’s mouth is hungry… his tongue both demanding and teasing.
Generations of etiquette lessons abandon Draco and all he can manage is a shy “Hi,” in return.

Draco can never quite suppress the wary look that crosses his face whenever the bell above the door rings… though he does not usually find it difficult to assist the occasional customer.  While Mr. Ainsworth seems to be on a first name basis with all of the long-dead authors, his grasp on most of the contents of his store is shaky. Draco often finds himself filling in the gaps.
“But…”
Abraxas Malfoy had been an arse. He had also been one of the Dark Lord’s earliest supporters, and Severus began to feel a very real fear that Draco was going to die right there at his gravesite.

Weasley and Granger seem to live in the house with Harry, but he doesn’t see much of them. Weasley, he gathers, is an Auror; Granger works in the Department of Magical Legal Affairs.

With a twinge of guilt, Ron muttered,
He feels it burst. He feels it tearing through him like shards of broken glass. He hears the sound he makes… half roar, half scream… like a wounded animal.
“No,” Potter says again, softly this time. “That’s not what I’m asking.” He twists so that he and Draco are nearly face to face, and twists his hand in Draco’s until they’re palm to palm, fingers still intertwined. “I’m asking if

Draco nods.
He nods slowly. “I’ll take you to the Headmaster. You’ll have to sign Victoire out there anyway.”

Draco feels his eyebrows climb.
Her name is Lisbeth. He knows it like he knows his own name. Like he knows she is coming home with them.
He is also wearing Gryffindor flannel pants and a horribly clashing sweatshirt that appears to say “West Ham”… though, while he is pleased to have formed the letters into two identifiable words, they
With nimble fingers, Potter undid the buttons, pushed both the trousers and the pants to the floor, and continued his trail of kisses.
“Are you all right, love?” The woman at the counter is looking at him with concern. She’s not exactly a regular, but he knows her. “You look a little peaky.”
He watches Potter bustle around the kitchen: putting on the kettle… using soap and a cloth, rather than his wand, to scrub out a pan and wash a few plates and forks… fumbling through the icebox in the corner of the room. He sets the pan on the stove and places sausages in it. Draco finds himself almost
For the briefest second the smirk that Harry knew and loved and hated lit Malfoy’s face. “She was very kind,” he says. “She didn’t have to be.”
Harry stares at her.

“You know,” Harry says, “I wasn’t even sure I liked blokes until… I guess I don’t know when. But it seems like it should be something I’ve just always known… you know? But I didn’t.”
“How the mighty have fallen,” Potter says as he toes over Draco’s cup. A few coins tumble out onto the pavement.
Moisture gathers at the corners of Harry’s eyes. Draco’s heart aches.

“Good morning, darling,” his mother says, as he enters the dining room. He leans in to kiss her cheek. “Did you sleep well?”
It turns out rather wonderful… for Shepherd’s Pie. Which means that Draco will consent to actually eating some of it. He stubbornly serves it beside a huge pile of greens.
The rug in the library, once a grand Persian rug, is now worn and moth-eaten in places and Draco runs his finger over the rough threads.
Solitude is better. Solitude is safety.
The dark-haired woman collects an equally dark-haired child—younger (or at least
They are wet, soaked with sweat, and sticky… and Draco begins to shiver. With a little maneuvering, made more complicated by the fact that Draco can’t… won’t…
Draco moaned.
Thankfully.
“Probably.” Potter doesn’t move either. If anything, his fingers tighten slightly on Draco’s. “This was nice,” he says.
He didn’t know how to feel.
“Yes…,” Draco hesitates. “Your friends are… kind. But… sometimes they are a little… much.”
Draco feels his stomach flip. Or maybe his stomach stays put and the rest of the world flips. “Ron… don’t…”
Harry lives by that line.
He watches him a long time, maybe falls asleep again, and then sees eyes, the swirling grey of the fog at sea, blinking slowly at him.
He regrets many,
There must have been a time…
When he thanks her, she blushes.
If he learns the truth.
“We could have grown up friends, maybe… practically cousins…,” Potter said, somehow landing on the most irrelevant thing Draco had just said.
… I just wanted to be in my room… away from the Dark… Vol-…
Draco makes a small noise. He is completely unsure if it is due to Harry’s tongue hitting the particularly sensitive spot just under his jaw… or the mental image of Harry in tight leather pants that his imagination threw, almost violently, forth.
He refuses to use magic, but instead pours over a Muggle repair book, sometimes with the less-than-helpful aid of Mr. Weasley. Then he moves things and twists things and then stands back to admire the results.
“I… Thank you, sir. But I have my dog with me today.” He gestures to Lisbeth, who is peering around his knee.
“Oh.” Harry Potter is bright red. “It’s okay… I mean, I thought you might want to… but it’s not a big deal… if you don’t… want to, I mean. I was just wondering.”
He gestures wildly, and Draco wonders how a movement so violent could also look so heartbreakingly helpless.
There isn’t a single wrinkle that shouldn’t be there, or crease that should be there that isn’t.
Because great fortunes were confiscated.

“But…” Harry is almost afraid to ask. “What happened to the companion?”

After a few long moments, Harry squeezes gently. “Did he—or she, I suppose—did they…”
For the longest moment Ron says nothing.
Again, he said it like it was important, and Harry squeezed his hands. Reassuring.
“Thanks, mate. Do you… want to get that one, too?”
Harry’s hand reaches out, so slowly, and brushes away his tears.  “We’re going to get through this, Draco. Together. I promise.”
But Draco cannot go with him. He doesn’t even really wish he could; he is done with things that hurt… and holding a sick child… a child that might die… that’s not a pain he’s willing to accept. Not even for Harry. Not even for the child.

to… I just couldn’t stop myself.”
As soon as they got back to Harry’s flat, Draco cast the diagnostic spell. He had barely said the incantation when the spell flared a bright, glowing pink. Pink for pregnant.
The thought makes his hands shake. He tries not to see snakes in the flames, hissing in Parseltongue, hissing in Voldemort’s voice. He tries not to see the faces of the dead… Dumbledore… Snape…
Harry is a mess—his jeans and sweatshirt have stains all over them… grease and other unnamable bits of grit, he has dirt in his hair after having spent a considerable amount of time on the floor trying to unstick the bike’s stopping mechanism, and his hands, the side of his nose, a bit of his forehead, and his left cheekbone, are all black.
Finally Draco can’t take it anymore. “Everything is wonderful, Harry,” he says at last. “Thank you.”
But still.
“Is that your idea of selfish?” Harry asks at last.
There is no sign of it. There never was.
“Potter? Are you okay?”
Draco could only shake his head no as he clung to Harry.
The man.
“Do you need to go to the bathroom, or get a drink first?” Draco asks.
Fog smells crystal clear… and the smell doesn’t mix with anything else that might be there—always at least two separate smells. At Charlie’s cabin, he could smell fog… and the hopeful smell of freshly turned earth.
! Will you do that again?”
“Harry… are you okay?”
Peaky. He’s exhausted. It’s not yet nine, and he’s scheduled ‘til three. He’ll never make it. He went to bed early last night, too.
The rain that had been holding off all afternoon gives up… throws out a few warning drops… before beginning to fall in earnest.
“I’ll owl you,” I said, kissing him like a lover on my front stoop.
“Hey…,” Harry pulls him close, obviously willing to ignore the mess in favor of holding Draco. “Hey… I’ve got you… that was so amazing. So perfect. Do you want me to…?”
He’s thin now. Draco’s not much thinner, and
“You really will crash.”
“It’s not your job to protect me. Surely you know that?” He traces his thumb along Harry’s cheekbone before kissing him gently. “And it’s a bookshop, Harry. It’s a bookshop five
He lines his cock up along Harry’s and works them both.
His clients adore him. Or delight in him, which isn’t quite the same thing.
Victoire chatters throughout the meal, disguising any awkwardness with chirpings about her classes, classmates, and of course, dragons.
Draco allows himself to be led up the basement steps and up two more flights of stairs, past dark and dusty rooms. By the time Potter stops, Draco is trying desperately to hide the fact that he is winded and in pain. There are black spots dancing before his eyes.
Potter notes him staring. “My aunt used to read them… there’s a whole series… when she thought no one was looking,” he says. “I… I read them one summer. That girl, Heaven, she grew up in a family where nobody wanted her either. I saw them on a used book rack a couple of months ago.” He looks uncomfortable. “I shouldn’t have bought them… I don’t know why I did.”

“No, ma’am,” Draco stutters. “I… wouldn’t.”
“This means something, doesn’t it?” Harry asks, not entirely sure he wants an answer… not entirely sure he knows what he wants the answer to be. “I feel… naked.”
There were a few dark books from the Manor library that suggested to Severus that Narcissa knew
“Shhh… hold still. I can have this better than new in two seconds.”
His eyes register shock, hurt, maybe even hope before they resolve into a sort of professional calm.
Draco doesn’t believe him. Not for one second.

Something stirs in Draco’s stomach… butterflies… or fire-breathing dragons? Or fire-breathing dragons devouring butterflies?
The thought that must have written itself right across my face, judging by Draco’s suddenly dancing eyes.

“Ah, yes, Mr. Potter. Mrs. Weasley telephoned earlier,” he says with perfect Received Pronunciation. “Please, sit down.”
“Harry, go dry off. You’re making a mess,” the voice says.
I won’t be able to move without thinking about you?”
Harry lifts one hand to Draco’s, where it is still entangled in Harry’s own curls, and threads his fingers through Draco’s… and squeezes gently.
“You’re excellent at Potions, and your hands move so perfectly, like a dance when you’re brewing… but you like Transfiguration more, and you like Charms even more, but you would never tell anyone because making a teacup waltz with a spoon is just too damn whimsical.... You turn up your nose at “pub food” and you won’t eat meat unless you absolutely have to and you love sweets. You know that treacle tart is my favorite, even though I never told you, and you used to bring it for us to share and then let me eat your piece too, which is how I knew, for the first time, that you loved me.”
There is nothing else.
“That first day… the first day you were here… I asked Hermione to do three things. I asked her to verify that your reparations were paid in full; they were. I asked her to have your wand cleared so you could use it again. And I asked her to transfer the money from my Order of Merlin into your vault at Gringotts.”
Draco takes a sip of tea, forcing it down past eggs and toast that are suggesting they might make a reappearance.
“No! Just… just…”
Draco flips through the marked pages… Meatloaf… Shepherd’s Pie… Steak and Kidney Pudding…
Draco knows the right thing to do… knows what he

He isn’t being poorly treated. He could be… there isn’t anyone who would care. But he is in one of the holding cells on the ground floor, not in the bowels of the prison, surrounded by the damp and dark, nor yet in the towers with dementors endlessly moving past him in their slow, menacing circles.
Harry winds up seeing the nurse practitioner… a woman called O’Brien. She’s probably not more than a dozen years older than he is, and she has silvery blue hair, a nose ring, and an intricate tattoo sleeve on one arm that seems to center around a goldfish with flowing fins. She has a warm smile and very cold hands.
Potter doesn’t say anything else, he just goes back to the stove. Draco sips his tea, feeling fractionally better with each sip, and watches Potter cook. His movements are practiced and efficient, and within minutes he is returning with small plates piled high with scrambled eggs, the sausages, and a few fried tomatoes.
“No… Pour the wine. I’m being… I don’t know…”
“I need to go,” he says. He touches her hand for the smallest fraction of a second. “Will you tell Harry?”
Harry freezes. He has forgotten how to breathe.
Draco can’t join in. His feet have stopped moving, he realizes, and he’s standing holding Harry’s hand like it’s the most important thing in the world. The lake is flat and bluish-grey at their feet.

Hanging above the upright piano is a screen that Draco is fairly sure is the telly—he might be wrong, though, because he thinks he remembers something about televisions being boxes, so it might be the small box is sitting on the piano, under the screen. A tray on the small box slides out and Potter puts something round, flat, and shiny onto it. Then the box slurps up the tray and disk alike and begins to whirr gently.

Victoire gives him a slight scowl and hops out of bed and crosses the hall.
Potter is leading him up slightly uneven stairs, the polished wood of the banister warm and smooth under his hand, to a landing. Two doors are shut, another door leads to the bath, and the last to a room with a large bed made up with a white comforter. A huge brownish cat is curled on one of the pillows.

The boy relaxed again, and Severus was glad he had not followed his last—quite inappropriate—train of thought.

Narcissa had turned guileless blue eyes up for the Dark Lord’s probing and he received nothing for his efforts.
The idea of touching the Dark Mark twists uncomfortably in Harry’s stomach; the idea of kissing it, nauseates him.
Harry is crying now, too. Their foreheads are pressed together, and Draco can feel Harry’s tears, mixing with his own, and running together down his cheeks and over his chest.  “And you’re stubborn. Too stubborn to die, too stubborn to spend the rest of your life in Azkaban, too stubborn to let them beat you. You did what you had to do and you

“I’ve wanted that for a really long time,” Harry says at last, his voice a caress.
Draco feels a wave of grief at the mention of his former Head of House. How he respected—maybe even loved—that man! He remembers how hard Severus had worked to protect him. Draco’s life would have been very,
Draco managed to eat the soup, and even a little of the fish, but, hungry as he was, the heavier courses were beyond him and he merely pushed the food around on his plate.

“I… I landed wrong when I got here… and… it’s been a really rough… Potter, what day is this?”
“I’m sorry for your loss,” he says, turning away.
But he and Padma get on quite well, and they spent the evening having a lively discussion about the correct interpretation of the rune “eihwas”, which ultimately ended with Padma agreeing that Draco was probably right. They came across a pair of First Year Hufflepuffs (lost on their way back from the library—and escorted them safely to their common room door) and a trio of third-year Gryffindors (apparently on their way to the Astronomy to smoke some of those Muggle Ciga Rettes—and docked them ten points each, before summoning Professor McGonagall to arrange their detentions.)

“Do you really think so?” The moment is over and Draco is lost again, his voice is trembling.
His back hadn’t stopped hurting, but it had begun to itch. He couldn’t reach to scratch and, indeed, couldn’t have borne his own touch if he could.
Something angry surges through Draco. “Listen to me, Hermione. From the

“I… I…” Draco is trembling. “I’m sorry.”
Malfoy still doesn’t say anything and Harry begins to unbutton his shirt. He slips it off and it puddles, unheeded, on the tile.
Malfoy’s mouth tightened, but he didn’t respond.
Harry glances at him. “Not something sweet?”
Hand flat, he works it down… feeling the slight ridges of Harry’s ribs… slipping his fingers into Harry’s pajamas and resting his hand on the hardness of his hip.
“God, I wish we had more time,” Lance says, releasing him. “But give me your numbers and I’ll hit you up next time my partner’s out of town.”
Harry caught him before he fell to the floor.
Harry is gentle and almost disturbingly respectful of Draco’s boundaries. They can kiss, touch, and even taste… but now that Draco’s body belongs to Draco again, its contours must remain inviolate.
“How’ve you been?”
“I can,” he says, sounding almost defeated. “You know I can.”
She brings him a cup of ginger tea, but he’s asleep before it finishes steeping.
Draco has gone with Weasley to the coffee shop. Lately Weasley’s schedule has been changing with a regularity that irritates Draco… and he’s not even the one who has to live it. Still, he tries to accompany Weasley for his morning coffee. Whenever Weasley’s “morning” happens to be.
“I… know… This one needed to be arrested, though.” Weasley’s voice holds an agony that causes Draco to open his eyes. “He didn’t always pay for it, Malfoy. There were a couple of rentboys, Muggles, one of them died… you know Muggles aren’t as strong as we are. And there was this model—he’s only seventeen fucking years old—with
He learned how to move his fingers at the very last second—how to avoid burns.
Not even enough to buy a cup of coffee at the café across the street.
—but lately she’s been perching herself on the back of one of Harry’s kitchen chairs. Harry’s surprised to find that he doesn’t mind—after Hedwig, he thought he’d never get another owl—but he likes having her there.
Harry leans forward, cupping Draco’s chin with his free hand. “I’m glad,” he whispers before lowering his mouth to Draco’s. The kiss is long and slow and Draco lets out a little whimper when Harry deepens it.
Clothes slide away as Draco’s fingers and lips brush every inch of Harry… every muscle, every scar. Some of his scars are new.
sorry… for all of it. I’ll do whatever you want. But do we really have to… to… fuck? What if I really did just want a quiet night in, watching the telly… and wanted you to join me? Would that be enough?”
“Or… erm…?” Harry’s voice drops off. He’s too polite to ask if Draco’s former lover is a Death Eater now serving a life sentence in Azkaban.

forgotten. If he had remembered, he probably wouldn’t have arrived in the kitchen barely dressed, limping slightly, and sporting at least two obvious love bites.
Draco tries to pull it away when Harry lowers his mouth to it. Harry doesn’t let him.
Adelle is smirking when Harry returns to the counter.
Even if a client
—and never was—good enough to make up for this.” He nods at his arm. At least it doesn’t burn anymore. It just rests quietly and hideously against his skin. “No one would hire me.”
Severus found Draco curled up on the window seat of an oddly placed window that gave light to an alcove that was part of a largely unused staircase that led to the upper floors of the Manor. It was too large to be a landing and too small to be an actual room… and it was the perfect place for the Malfoy heir, abused and afraid, to hide.

into Charlie’s touch. He presses his forehead into Charlie’s and breathes in the feeling of feeling safe and cared for… sunshine, leather, singed fabric. Nutmeg and sage.
“I know what I look like,” Malfoy says, with almost no bite at all. “In the past forty-eight hours, I’ve had three midterms and two twelve-hour placements, the last of which was more like fourteen because one of the

and be fed chicken soup.”
And he cannot seem to remember that Draco doesn’t like to be touched.
He feels his words being pulled from his throat and silenced.
Slowly Potter brought his head, his lips, to Draco’s neck and gently kissed the topmost point of the scar. He pulled back slightly, his eyes flicking to Draco’s, and when Draco didn’t respond with anger or horror or anything really, Potter brought his lips back to his neck, just a little lower and kissed again. Potter’s lips slid down the scar… down Draco’s neck, across his chest, over his stomach… inch by inch, Potter used his lips and tongue to kiss… caress… almost
Malfoy let out a soft sigh. “I hadn’t realized how much they still hurt,” he said. “Thank you.”
Draco feels a strong Disillusionment charm wash over him, creating a bubble of absolute privacy. He shivers—if anything the air behind the charm is even colder… and it is certainly doing nothing to block the wind.
“What do you want me to say?” Draco asks, his voice trembling.
Without actually meaning to, Draco finds himself
“It’s a bit gloomy, don’t you think?” Weasley says. “I bet you can take out this wall and that one. Then this whole area will both morning and afternoon sun. Might make a nice playroom. If you want, I mean.”

Harry’s hand is still safe between Malfoy’s. Malfoy’s head bends a little, his lips brushing Harry’s knuckles.

“Potter… Harry… please. I
“I know. You weren’t the only one.”
Granger blushed a little. “It’s called a pizza. I’m afraid it’s a Muggle thing.”
Draco felt himself blush and glanced quickly at Potter.
The garden is overrun, but the heady smell of blooming flowers is thick in the sultry nighttime air. It’s not really dark, and the sky is rich velvet blue, speckled with stars.
Yes, he had a stomach bug… he got sick at work… it was embarrassing… but that was almost two weeks ago. And he’s still not feeling right. The exhaustion lingers and the nausea hasn’t really cleared up—a couple mornings he’s even vomited again, though, thankfully not at work.
“Whatever you want,” he says softly. “Yes.”
“It’s true that there aren’t exactly a

It doesn’t take long before Harry is shuddering and coming, gripping Draco’s hips with bruising fingers. Draco doesn’t mind;
He tries a curry recipe which turns out rather well, and a few pasta dishes. He thinks he will have to remember to ask Granger to find him some more cookbooks, ones with lighter dishes, ones with less meat and more spices.
Harry is not afraid. But,
Harry remembers being happy—this small connection between him, his aunt, and his unknown grandmother—who was also the mother of
Not a lie.
The boy was, indeed, looking up at him… not with lust, but with absolute trust, and Severus gratefully allowed the world to right itself.
But he would have missed valediction.
He takes the mug Weasley hands him. Cappuccino. Perfectly brewed, perfectly bitter, perfect foam. In his favorite rainbow mug. He takes a sip. Perfect temperature. “Thank you,” he says.
Malfoy meets his eyes, stubborn for a moment, and then Harry watches his resolve crumble. “All right.”
Not fast enough. Never fast enough.

Draco doesn’t move, except to keep placing treats into his hand for the dog to take. After the last treat is gone, she simply rests her head on his knee, waiting for him to do something.
“Okay! When You-Know-Who tried to kill me, I responded with a fucking

“Thank goodness! We were starting to worry,” the face attached to them says. Adelle. “You’ve been asleep for almost three hours.”
Tragically late.
“There’s an oath, do you know?  That Muggle healers take. I know you know it,” Malfoy says. “
She smiled. “I… Thank you… Draco.”
From what Draco gathered, the man from last night had discovered his wife was cheating on him. He wanted to exact revenge on her and found Draco, wearing his soon-to-be ex-wife’s body, to be a reasonable substitute. Draco’s throat is raw from screaming and, though the vagina the man tore into doesn’t even
Barefoot, and mostly glitter-free, Draco walks down the stairs… to find Potter sitting on the couch in the living room. Potter’s made a huge bowl of popcorn and set out a bottle of wine and two glasses. He’s leafing through a Quidditch magazine and nibbling at the popcorn with a slightly guilty set to his shoulders… as if he feels like he should be waiting for Draco but can’t quite resist the buttery kernels.
The eyes are glittering now, with unshed tears. Harry blinks and two solitary tears trace his cheeks. “If I kiss you, will I hurt you?”

He found that, while he certainly did not wish to celebrate, neither did he want to stay in his flat, alone, mourning his parents, mourning the life he might have led. He found himself in Muggle bar, ordering a fruity sort of cocktail. He found himself on the dancefloor in the strong arms of a tall, muscular man. Blond… but with so many pale freckles.
O’Brien smiles, her eyebrows coming back down.

Charlie leads the way along the creek and up into the mountains, the trees are beautiful, all dressed up for fall. Harry simply follows, the dry leaves rustling under his feet, the sun warm where it brushes his face.
“No, it’s not wrong,” Draco says softly. And then just holds him… letting him cry, letting him scream, even letting him stretch the jumper out, probably beyond hope of repair.

a good book, if somewhat difficult to place in any specific category. “Trust me, she’ll love it.”
Harry hates them. Granger and Weasley hate them. Even Kingsley Shacklebolt hates them, Draco suspects. And yet everyone dresses in his or her finest and trots out to this function, or that charity event, with alarming regularity.
“I didn’t ask for this,” Harry whispers.
Weasley eyes him suspiciously. “Cross Stitch? Isn’t that a kind of sewing? I mean, Hermione knits sometimes, but…”

So he wishes, briefly, for a house-elf and then quietly asks Granger if she can give him a lesson in Muggle ironing—because, unless you’re a house elf, smoothing a hot iron across fabric is really the way to go.
Ron disappears in a swirl of green, not seeing the elf bow.

“It’s three o’clock in the morning. Andy wouldn’t thank me for that.” There’s a slight sardonic edge to his voice. I think, maybe, his nightmares are releasing him. Slowly.
Draco strains to hear frustration, even irritation, in Harry’s voice.
“I took your money and let you fuck me. I don’t see a lot of room for interpretation in that.”
Draco sheds his coat before reaching for Harry. He cups his head gently, leaning down for a gentle kiss. Harry’s lips are soft, tasting of bread, butter, and a fruity red wine. Draco closes his eyes and deepens the kiss, kissing Harry like he’s been gone for days, not hours.
With a final, vicious thrust, Macnair grunted out his release. “I used to dream of making you scream and beg,” he said, the words rasping against Draco’s neck, “But this… this might be even better.”
“Then you can’t.” Harry says it calmly, as if Draco hasn’t confessed his darkest secret, his most terrifying fear. “It’s okay.”
Draco finds that he can no longer stand. He drops to the floor, heedless of the slippery dampness coating his pajama pants. Heedless of the cold and the hard floor. Heedless of everything, really, because he

Draco helps with the washing up. He takes up the cloth and plunges his hands into hot soapy water—like a Muggle. He washes because this isn’t his kitchen and he doesn’t know where anything goes… and with the cloth because, though he can feel his magic returning to him, he doesn’t want to risk straining it on dishes.
He says it like it’s a guilty secret… which it is. Or was.

Draco turned around.
He kisses the tender skin, nuzzling gently, moving softly, tenderly, down Draco’s arm… trailing kisses… to his wrist. He places one final kiss on the palm of his hand.
Draco opens the note again, sprinkles a little silver-gold glitter into it, and refolds the parchment. The owl watches him, carefully, with wide amber eyes.

“Wait… Draco…” Harry waves his wand, vanishing the papers. “Come here. Come here and sit with me. Please.”
She dragged him back to the ironing board, to the hot iron.
Draco takes them without comment, trying to hide his wince.
“In fact, you have more right to live in this house, I think, than I do. If you want to stay… if you want me to move out… I will.”
“Stand up, Draco, and turn around.”

It’s less of a shock and more of a slowly dawning realization that he, too, is naked. Which makes sense, of course. But he finds the idea of striding… naked… across the room to receive a cup of coffee from a man he doesn’t know… disconcerting.

There, hanging on the door, are his new dress robes.

“Are you okay?” Draco asks, his eyes pale grey and worried.
“Y-yes. Please.” He is fairly sure Harry is crying.
“Harry failed history at school,” Draco says. “I find his choice of majors hysterical.”
Potter rolled his eyes. “You think?” he said, picking it up anyway.
Grimmauld Place is grand, if you like macabre Victorian as a decorating style, but Draco is unable to tell if the neighborhood surrounding it ever matched. In any case, most of the neighboring houses are broken into small flats, and the street hovers right on the border between quaint and slummy.
“Braiding?”
“How are things?” she asks.
Draco can feel himself shaking. “I got this a week later. No one ever touched me again.”
Draco pets him gently.
A loud crack snapped him out of his musings. The front door burst open with a crash and an unmistakable cry of pain.
“Yes… so much… But what if I just
Harry moves down Draco’s chest, kissing and licking and sucking. “Maybe not even here,” Harry says around teeth clamped gently on Draco’s nipple.
“I was so scared,” Harry whispers. “When we heard about Theo… and I couldn’t find you… I didn’t think you had the money for your reparations payments either…. And I knew you weren’t in Azkaban. I almost couldn’t look for you, afraid that I would find you swinging in an attic somewhere…” Harry is gasping for breath, and Draco fists his hand into his hair and clenches their joined hands together so tightly it hurts.
Harry meets him in the front hall. “You’re back,” he says.
"I know." Gently Draco twists his hand free and brings it up to cup Harry’s cheek. “I love you, Harry.”

Harry’s snort is not mirthful, and he palms the tears off his face. “I know you would have. Stopping only to make crude gestures at everyone you saw on your way out.”
Draco hears voices on the other side of the door.
It comes out in a whisper.
Harry’s eyes are closed.

Still, another month goes by before Draco will consent to leave the house—and then only with Harry.

The door opens and Charlie Weasley, literally and figuratively, blows into the coffee shop, bringing with him the smell of fresh mountain air and a pocket of cold. Charlie is dressed for the Romanian winter—all fur and leather—and he has a full beard now. He looks wild and untamed and maybe a little frightening.
“I got it cleared this morning,” she says. “You paid your reparations. It’s yours again.”
“Is this from Buckbeak?” he asks.
Malfoy turns over Harry’s hand, moving gentle fingers across his palm, where the cut had been. There’s no trace of it now.
Draco takes it. And lets the tears fall freely into the checkered cloth. He takes a deep breath, and wipes his eyes. “Thank you.” He refolds the handkerchief and offers it back.

Without Macnair’s bruising fingers, Draco feared he would fall. He renewed his grip on the bed.

“Oh… you know…”
Weasley nods. “Something like that.”
Weasley pops in once or twice a day, staying at the edge of the fog, asking if there is anything that Draco needs.
He is sliding now.
Strong hands gripped him. “It’s okay. It’s okay, I’ve got you! Let it out… I’ve got you.”
If he could, he would never move again.
Draco watches the flames and listens to Harry breathing. Either or both of them might have fallen asleep. Draco loses feeling in both legs… still he doesn’t move. He just holds Harry close.

He shuts his eyes against the remembered violations… Hands on a body that was never his… the sharp crack as flesh that wasn’t his blossomed and stung… The body that he had no right to simply waiting as strangers forced their way inside it.
Ignoring Ron’s warning, Harry took a cautious step closer… and the rags shifted a little, revealing themselves to be a wrinkled and rather filthy traveling cloak covering a skeletal figure… with platinum blond hair and the grey eyes Harry had been searching for.
“You’re not ill, are you?”

Waiting. Draco was always waiting. Waiting, waiting, waiting.
Draco drops his hands to the bottommost button, slipping it free, and with a slight swish and a readjustment of his balance, reveals a fishnet-covered leg and a high heel. He trails his fingers up his body, slipping buttons free as he goes, until he is slithering out of the coat and standing before Potter wearing so much less than nothing.
The bell above the door jangles as they enter the shop. Draco breathes in, smelling new books and wood polish, and taking in the rows upon rows of colored book covers. The bookshop is narrow with an ornately carved staircase leading to a second floor. The man behind the counter is elderly, with greying hair and wire-rim glasses perched on his nose. It is everything a bookshop should be.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“I don’t know how to do this….” He sort of collapses on the bed, turning away from Harry, his eyes firmly downcast again. “Harry, I fuck people. I think that’s all I remember… People I never wanted, people who never wanted

“Drive north, then. There’s something I want to show you.”
“Malfoy, when Vol—”

He rose shakily to his feet, his face stark white in the dim light of the graveyard.

Harry held Draco’s hands against his chest… over his heart and let the other boy rest his forehead against his own. He couldn’t even guess how long they stood like that.
Draco is never sure if he made the right decision.
“Thank you.”
“The appointment is for three o’clock tomorrow afternoon,” Draco says.
“I’m fine,” he says. The bookshop returns to normal. Draco looks down to find that he is holding

All eyes landed back on Kreacher. Draco swallowed hard and continued his story.
Dearly.
Malfoy’s hand is still on his arm, his expression unsure and maybe a little confused, as if he’s not sure how to release it. Harry doesn’t want him to—and he would very much welcome a kiss… on the cheek, the lips would be better… and a proper hug.
~*~*~*~
“Yes. I will. Thank you,” I say.
He wears tee-shirts and jumpers when he can get away with it… and when he can’t, he buys shirts and dress robes charmed to be wrinkle-free. The charms barely function, but who, really, is going to care if the Savior of the Wizarding World’s clothes look a bit rumpled.
The man saw Draco… and just for a moment hard flinty eyes lit into foggy grey ones. The average man on the street might not have known what that look means, but Draco knows.
“Anywhere…
Draco knows—maybe better than anyone else—that Harry Potter is
I feel Draco’s hand back on my shoulder. I feel a gentle squeeze.
The household settles into a routine: Weasley and Granger go to work, Harry goes wherever he goes, Draco works in the garden, drinks those god-awful nutrition potions, and takes a lot of naps.
Harry takes him to the cinema where the pictures move without magic.
Weasley nods.
“So?” Her eyes are narrow. “Are you trying to excuse—because if you are—”
“I… hurt you.”
“The Wizarding World can go fuck itself.” Harry’s words are harsh, but the hand that reaches out… that pulls him back… that cups his cheek… is gentle. “You aren’t a Death Eater… you never were. Not really. And I don’t want to be with without you. Ever.”
“I really think you need to eat

He accepts Harry’s invitation to the pet shelter instead.
Draco raises his eyebrows. He can’t possibly be expected to respond to
“Draco…”
“I… thank you, Harry.”
The kitchen is immaculate. But more than that, the kitchen is in the process of making a very elaborate breakfast. A plate, piled high with cinnamon rolls, sits in the middle of the kitchen table beside a huge bowl of fruit. Sausages are frying themselves by the stove. Even as Ron watches, eggs are marching out of their carton, cracking themselves, and falling gracefully into a bowl.
“Thank you, Potter.”
“Yes. I’d tell him anyway… but I’d probably jumble it, you know?”
“Hey,” Harry says, standing, “you’re awake.” He pushes a cup of tea into Draco’s hands.
“Fuck, yeah. The color’s perfect for your skin… your hair… it brings out the grey in your eyes… so beautiful. Almost like silver, but stronger… like iron. But that thread of green… you almost can’t see it, but it’s

“Bloody hell…” Ron’s eyes narrowed. “How do you know that?”
“They left me in the dungeons… for weeks, I think,” Draco said, his voice ragged.
He is with Weasley the first time he sees one of his clients. By now he can nearly always make passersby on the street stay who they really are… and not morph into someone he knows. Intimately. But there is no mistaking this man—the ruddy face, the broad shoulders and blunt fingers, the layer of fat overlaying an even thicker layer of muscle. He was
exactly did you bring me here?”
There is no room here for Harry Potter… the teenager… the (pretend) university student… the boy who works in the coffee shop and drinks chai tea and reads romance novels and has a newfound love for Indian food. There is no room for the Harry Potter who is terrified and slightly nauseated.
~*~*~*~
Three hours later, he left the dirty street corner with Elladora.
“My mother loved Regulus Black.”
“Of course I will.” For a moment she’s quiet, thinking probably. Already planning. “Are you thinking of using Malfoy Manor?” she asks.
He might even sigh out loud.
Suddenly Draco can’t breathe. At all.
“Do you?”

“Sometimes it was just a punishment. But sometimes…” He shrugs. “Usually I had to stay in my room when there were guests. When Dudley had a friend over or something. My aunt wouldn’t always remember to bring something up for me.”

Malfoy gives him a rare smile. “Hermione helped me get all the papers I needed to enroll in the course.”
Harry doesn’t say anything. He just picks up Draco’s arm, his thumbs sliding over the Mark… almost as if he is brushing it away, erasing it.
“Can I… would it be all right if I kissed you?”
Then.
Especially not one as fearless and charismatic as Victoire.

The waistband of Harry’s pajamas is cutting into his wrist and his heart is doing something funny, its rhythm uneven, caught between excitement and terror.

Potter’s asked a question… and now he’s watching… waiting. For Draco’s answer. He’s wondering if he will feel the brush of Draco’s lips on his own.

He stands.
Besides the coffee and the (slightly burned) sausages, there are eggs and fried mushrooms and tomatoes.
Draco frowned. “What am I going to do? He has my wand.”

One of the things he’s noticed is that Malfoy’s eyes change color… dark to light to dark again… Harry’s not sure how or why. They’re dark now, like a black you can see through.

And yet he was trapped in a nightmare…
Harry is careful and thorough and not at all hesitant. And Draco sees stars.
His shoulder aches a little, his arm is at a funny angle… his hand is holding something. Another hand. He moves his thumb, a soft, sweeping motion against the hand, and several long blinks later, it squeezes back, reassuring.
A word floats through his consciousness, one last thought before sleep claims him:
Perhaps he will try to get a job in a book shop when this is all over—he feels that he has read at least

It means a backhand across the face. It means choking on the man’s cock. It means bruises on his hips and being taken without enough preparation, each stroke burning. It means being forced into his own orgasm, a mockery of pleasure, cold sneaking through his belly like the touch of a Dementor. It means being tossed aside, something easily discarded, as the man dresses slowly above him.

Harry nods, looking scared.

“There is nothing in the world that I want more.”
… and finds a scrap of paper and a pen with ink.
Draco threads his fingers through that oh-so-familiar hair and kisses him back. He nips Harry’s lower lip in the way that he knows he likes and is rewarded with an almost desperate cry. Draco throws his head back, giving Harry access to his neck and Harry gently worries the skin in the way that always could—always would—make him moan.
He steps out of the ensuite trying, unsuccessfully, to fish his heart out the bottom of the very deep well it’s fallen into. It’s stupid, he tells himself, they’re just robes. No one cares what
If only he had taken Malfoy’s hand, that first day on the train….
But the idea of him being tortured… The anguish in Harry’s eyes told him this was torture, true and sadistic, and
“That must be…” Malfoy stopped, as though words failed him. “What… what did you see… when you saw me?”
“Yes!”
Harry’s hands stop sliding over Draco’s perfect body… the body that was his when he was playing Quidditch almost every day, the body that had enough to eat, the body that didn’t have a scar slicing across his heart. The body that Harry remembers making love to.
Harry inhaled deeply and said, in a voice that was very nearly matter-of-fact, “A few drops of dittany in the bath, do you think?”
It will be next Saturday. It always is.
dittany.”
he is… he forgets everything but Harry.
“A living hell? Come on, Draco. Don’t you think you’re being a little melodramatic?” The corners of Hermione’s mouth turn up a bit. “I mean I know his aunt and uncle didn’t understand magic… and that they were very strict. But it’s not like they beat him… or… or starved him!”
“I put in an extra shot of expresso,” Harry says. “You work too hard, Malfoy.”
He’s hardly in the best neighborhood now—beggars shelter in doorways and the whores, male and female, gather on the corners. Even they don’t make eye contact with him. No one does anymore.
“My aunt used to make me do all the ironing,” Harry says. “I hated it.”
“No, I mean… I don’t know the date,” Draco said softly.
The room is full of shadows.
harbor no blood prejudices. A number of the old families from the Continent will be in attendance—Draco’s French is flawless, of course, and he can affect fluency in both Italian and German—and even a few people from America. But a lot of the real wealth comes from the Muggle side of the Wizarding World.
Draco is not ready. Sometimes he stands by the windows in the dining room, watching people pass… sometimes two people go past, sometimes twenty, but eventually he sees someone who reminds him of a client. Or of himself, wearing someone else’s face. Draco’s hands start to shake. Sometimes tears fall. And always—always—he lets the curtain fall shut, returning the dining room to its accustomed gloom.
“He would have found you,” Harry said with certainty, not letting go of Draco’s hands. “He would have brought you back…”
Harry pulls back. “Draco…”
This time when Draco kisses Harry, it is Draco’s tongue that swipes across Harry’s lips… and, just for the briefest moment, slips inside.
Malfoy is silent.
. It’s not an unreasonable request. Somehow it makes him want to cry.
Draco takes a hasty sip of tea. It’s sweeter than he normally likes it, but the sugar coats the bitterness of remembered taste and pulls the fragrant Assam to the forefront. He takes another sip, slower this time. Then another.

Except for the occasional spark of rage that goes as quickly as it comes and usually leaves a tragedy behind it… he feels nothing.

The soap is gritty, smells strongly of oranges, and almost magically scrubs away most of the grease. When Harry casts a second cleaning charm over both their hands, Draco can find only the barest traces of black remaining, outlining the swirls of his fingerprints and the lines on his palms. He thinks he likes it. It makes him feel that he has done something
that it was his magic, starved for nourishment, fading away. He knew it, felt it, with Ron and Hermione during those horrible months on the run, hunting Horcruxes. But, even then, Hermione always found them something to eat; his magic never abandoned him completely.
Harry’s won’t be a problem. They’re simple enough… Harry won’t wear anything more eye-catching than simple (though extremely well-made) robes. Actually, he would buy something off the rack if Draco would let him; Draco doesn’t. Harry's dress robes resemble nothing more flashy than the simplest Muggle tuxedo—black robes, black tie, with a plain-front shirt, a simple collar—not a speck of color anywhere, save for his eyes, glowing like green jewels from behind his glasses. The shirt can be ironed in moments, the trousers and vest will be fine, Draco took great care when he hung them up after their last gala, the robe may need the smallest touch-up.
Draco rings the front door bell at exactly six minutes to six. He is carrying a sack full of the warm, mouth-watering smells of Indian spices. He has a bottle of wine tucked under his arm.
“And, who, exactly, should I tell?”

The mug is far beyond a

For a moment he just stands there. The cottage was too loud… too crowded; the house is too quiet… too empty. Part of him wants to go back.
“Is Ron next door?” Hermione asks.
Once he became a child and Draco prayed to any god who would listen that he was adequate… that the child whose body he wore was—and would remain—untouched. Because Draco could handle what a child could not.

compared to what he feels now. But even through his rage, a small part of him recognizes that this is in no way Draco’s fault… and Harry hates that part, too. He means to push away, but instead finds his face buried in Draco’s jumper, his fingers fisting the wool, unable to let go.
“I want…”
we will find you.”
“Harry? Harry! Come on! It’s been over a week—”
“I don’t care! I didn’t ask for this!”
Harry’s eyes really are beautiful, but they are closed now as he leans into Draco’s kisses. Draco tries to find his rhythm as he moves his lips against Harry’s, as their tongues dance… but he can’t quite. The movements aren’t natural, they feel
She’s right, in a way. Except when has he ever
“I’m not surprised,” Draco answered. “I had rather a rough arrival here, you recall.” He had aimed for the snarky tone that he had once commanded so easily… and he didn’t think he had done too terrible of a job, either, given that Potter was kneeling before him with Draco’s own blood on his fingertips.
What’s going on, is that Harry is pregnant.
They are quiet for a while, the typical city sounds, distant, the hum of the bees in the roses, gentle.
“I can’t,” he admits. “I could never. You’ve been hurt too much… by too many people… People who were supposed to love you… protect you… Harry, I can’t be one of them.”
Harry Potter the War Hero. And he doesn’t know how to refuse them. He never has.
In those dark days after Voldemort—when everyone else was celebrating and getting on with life… creating life, in the case of Bill and Fleur… I saw nothing but Death’s shadow, felt nothing but his hand constantly on my shoulder.
“Excellent. Turn around.”
“Mr. Potter…”
“Malfoy!”
“He hasn’t been hurt,” Weasley says quickly. “He never touched him…”
… not minding the rough flannel on his tongue, not minding that the floor is cold, not minding that Draco probably will not be able to return the favor.
“No, of course not.”
Harry drops to his knees, pushing aside the flimsy robe that is all the clothing Draco really has, and takes him into his mouth.
He is in the library, reading, and sipping chamomile tea out of his rainbow mug when Harry walks in.

When the light was at its brightest, a small bowl of gruel appeared. It was tepid and tasteless, and Draco, trembling with the effort, ate every last bite.
“It’s my turn to make dinner tonight.”
“Yes,” Draco gasps. “Harry!”
“The others?” Draco asks. He never saw anyone else… but there must have been other people who worked there.
“Mrs. Weasley… I…” It takes everything Draco has not to burst into tears. “Thank you.”
“Can I touch you?”
Something inside Harry’s heart swells.
“Can I move now?” Harry asks, his voice ragged. “Because I really, really want to kiss you right now.”
“I’m already late. I just wanted to make sure you got home okay. Wait. Are

The last bit is unfortunately true. What is also true is that when Blaise… kind, gentle Blaise… reached out to touch him, he flinched away, his breath coming short. Draco can’t let Blaise—or anyone—touch him now.

Standing was an effort.

Draco makes a soft noise… drawing Potter’s attention—not that it could possibly be anywhere else—to him.

He spreads the fabric slightly to reveal milky skin, collarbones that he

Draco’s palm aches to touch flesh, and he has just about resolved to do it when a snake of dread crawls up from his belly and his hand jerks back, quite without his permission.
A speck of color tinges Potter’s cheeks. “Thanks. I did all the cooking when I lived with my aunt and uncle.”
to see me again.”
It says so… in silvery scars of messy handwriting etched onto the back of his fucking hand. Draco can see it clearly—the hand has wrapped itself around the bars of his cell.
Draco’s relationship with Harry was inevitable. His relationship with Hermione is something he’s worked on. His relationship with Weasley… well he’s just going to leave it as one of the mysteries of life.
The tears that are tracing down Harry’s cheeks have to be Draco’s tears too.

The words are ancient, the sentiment archaic… and the whole thing, Draco thinks, is just really fucking unfair.

There is a window. The draperies are dark and heavy but they are pulled back and sunlight streams in… onto a chair. And Draco sits in it because his legs won’t hold him up anymore.
Bars and people peering in at him were, at least, one indignity he did not have to suffer.
Except Harry.
She allows them to pass through the door into the hospital.
“My mother used that spell…,” Harry said, sounding awed. “I remember… when I was little and I cried, she used that spell… I thought I couldn’t remember her at all… but I do.”
Draco takes a bite of sandwich. Ground meat and melted cheese combine with the bite of ketchup on toasted bread. If a hug were a sandwich, he thinks, it would taste like this.
The noise Draco makes is soft… disbelief and awe, horror and pleasure tangled into one tiny sound.
If it’s just a blond, Harry promises himself, he’ll drop a few coins into his cup and move on.

Draco leans over him, relacing their fingers, his other hand running over the other boy’s brow, jawline… searching his eyes. “I love you,” he whispers, before dropping his mouth to Harry’s. He kisses him… probing… sucking… caressing… making Harry moan… before moving down his jaw… his neck… Draco trails kisses and tiny nips across his chest, down his ribs, and Harry lies there, shivering a little and whimpering and arching into Draco’s touch.
Draco picks up Harry’s hand and interlaces their fingers. “You don’t have to do this alone. Whatever

“The part where you said you’d wanted this… to kiss me, to… what?... to make love to me… for so long… Did you… mean that, too?”
His shirt was open at the throat, but the sleeves were rolled down and buttoned tight, the Dark Mark hidden. In the dark of the pub, his eyes were the color of an unsettled nighttime sea, his hair glowing like light from a beacon. The kind of beacon you would use to find your way home if you were lost at sea.
“Will you sleep in my bed… and hold my hand when we’re out… and brew my Pepperup Potion so I don’t poison myself?”
Draco sits down on the bed that smells like Potter. He opens the book… and falls asleep.

Hermione is making pancakes. Weasley is minding the bacon. They look up when he enters, then meet each other’s eyes in a way that makes Draco want very much to glance down to make sure that he actually

“No!” It’s Draco’s turn to be shocked. “Gods, no. It… it was a long time ago.”
“No,” the elf says, and evil grin lighting his face. “No, they is sleeping now.”
Draco silences Harry with another kiss. He nibbles gently for a moment before pulling back. “There’s a difference between being afraid and letting your fear control you. Surely I shouldn’t have to explain that to a Gryffindor?” he says, a thread of a smile running through his words.
A bell chimes briefly.
He works in his garden.
“That’s what Hermione says, but—”
“I should have
At first Harry objected, concerned that Draco would catch a cold, or actually freeze. The look on Weasley’s face was priceless. “You’re a Wizard, Harry. Cast a bloody warming charm!” he said.
Malfoy.
Potter opens a cupboard, rummages around a moment and pulls out a couple of worn, but soft-looking towels. He snags a pair of red and gold flannel pants out of a plastic laundry bin and reaches in again for a battered burgundy sweatshirt with seven white, blocky letters on it. Draco cannot resolve the letters into anything sensible. “They’re clean,” he says.
“Responsible?”
“Yeah. That’s something,” Ron said, feeling a bit like he was lying. “’Course, walking into Malfoy Manor… that’d be just as bad as going to knock on the door of You-Know-Who’s hideout.”
Draco has learned to breathe through the change, to bear it and to hope that the Polyjuice is the worst part of the encounter.
The question takes Draco by surprise. Did he?
But you? You I try to disembowel!”
Draco freezes. His fingers refuse to release the grapefruit he is holding, refuse to let it fall into his market bag.
“Only for you,” Harry says. “I’m
“Draco, it
“Her mother is something like one-quarter Japanese.” Draco has the vague impression that Harry is stalling. “And Theo?”
Potter’s fingers tighten, his other hand twisting in his hair, holding his head still as he ruts forward, once… twice… Draco doesn’t quite choke, but he feels his eyes swim.
Tears lace Harry’s eyelashes, but Draco is almost certain they are not tears of pain. Physical pain, at least. Harry traces Draco’s eyebrows, cheekbones… as if committing to memory every bit of his face… “I’ve missed you so much,” Harry whispers, running his thumb over Draco’s lips.

When he stops the notes hang, briefly, in the air, before slowly dissolving into the silence. Draco turns towards Harry then, his eyes liquid grey. He closes the piano.

Draco knows how to kiss Harry. Draco
Suddenly I realize that Victoire is standing beside me. “Uncle Harry? I think you should kiss him now.”
Kreacher is giving him a hard look.
At Draco’s soft encouragement, Lisbeth obligingly sniffs Harry’s hand; he doesn’t try to touch her, and she doesn’t try to bite him. “I agree. Completely,” Harry says.

At some point Harry’s smile has turned to tears.
Three days later, Draco closets himself in the library and reads the book.

Emotions, pure and raw, fill the room… love and hate and lust and longing swirl… reverently,

Harry runs his own calculations… and comes up with something unpleasant. “You’re not a whore, are you?”
Draco laughs out loud. “Victoire’s a handful. No doubt about that. But you’re good with her.”
, but oh…
“Yeah.”
Draco only really laughs when he’s with Harry. But he smiles; it is almost like a laugh… but quieter.
… maybe even
“But… we don’t normally encourage our volunteers to adopt…”
“Oh?” Draco arches his eyebrows.
“And I know that
Draco shrugs. “That wouldn’t be right. I made a contract. They made a contract. Everyone knew what they were getting, what they were giving.”
Who would have thought it? Certainty not sixteen-year-old Draco.
… And I didn’t mean… any of it…. The things I said… I am so,
Of all the chores Aunt Petunia used to make him do, Harry hated ironing the most.
He likes the old man. Mr. Ainsworth, a Muggle, obviously, grew up working in the bookshop… before inheriting it from his father. He has no children—only a nephew, studying marine biology, who comes in occasionally to help.  Mr. Ainsworth is soft-spoken, refers to Draco as “my boy” as if he means it, and plies him with tea. He doesn’t talk much.

Draco eats the toast and sips the tea, his hands shaking: It is the fourth day, and he has decided to go downstairs.
It must be visible on his face, or in the fact that he can’t help but lean towards the door.
Draco thinks that speeding along country roads, holding tightly to Harry’s waist, is better than flying. Better than anything, really.
at his job. It would seem that the skills he honed as a child—to observe and then exploit his classmates’ weaknesses, the skills that made him such a loathed schoolyard bully, translate rather spectacularly into the ability to assess and then grant his clients’ desires… often before they are even aware of them themselves.
This year he ignored it.
“My mother always said ninety percent of ironing was done with the fingers,” Aunt Petunia said.
“Yeah. I think I’d better.”
He was still lying where he had fallen…
Something inside Draco bursts. Harry pulls him tight and doesn’t say anything.
Draco finds that he can’t lie to Harry Potter. But neither can he tell him the truth. He pulls Harry’s hands away. He loses track of one, but the other he brings to his lips, pressing a kiss into his palm… trailing tongue and teeth up his fingers, until he sucks one of Harry’s fingers into his mouth, then another, tongue swirling.

Draco’s hands are shaking and Harry squeezes them.
“I want you to be safe,” Harry says, running his hand across Draco’s cheek. “And I
“I need to shower,” Draco says, bending quickly for one more kiss. “I’ll be fast.”
“Come on, Potter, let me take you home.”
Draco’s hands are moving on his back. “Breathe, Harry. I just need you to keep breathing.”
“Harry, I need you to hear me right now…”
He insists in a loud, clear voice, his eyes blazing, that Draco Malfoy doesn’t deserve Azkaban.
He loves them too. It feels wrong… missing Lucius, loving him still. It feels wrong to
He leans forward… Potter’s lips are soft and full and a little fruity and a little salty under his.
“I was
Draco is remembering to breathe.
“It’s not supposed to hurt, Harry.” Softly. Gently. “It’s supposed to feel good… Maybe we should just…”
“Oh, I think he minds a little. But he always comes back to me, so I guess he doesn’t mind too much.” A wink. “Besides. It’s just a hook-up, right? It doesn’t mean anything.”

, but still the same.
Malfoy takes two unsteady steps into the bathroom, toes off his trainers and, turning a bit sideways, slips off his trousers.
He had forgotten.
“It’s all right. I’ve got you.” Harry just holds him and repeats those words, over and over.
Draco swallowed and swallowed, willing himself not to throw up. “I know… Just not that, okay?”
Draco usually falls asleep in Harry’s arms… but tonight he holds Harry close, letting him snuggle into his chest. Draco strokes his hair and kisses his forehead, watching him drift, slowly, towards sleep.
“You’ve been looking into his mind again, haven’t you?” Luckily they were still whispering; Ron didn’t think messing about in You-Know-Who’s head was exactly a brilliant idea, but Hermione was rabidly opposed to it.
Harry’s hand strokes his hair. Soothing. “You won’t,” he says.

At some point Draco finds himself tucked up under Potter’s arm. At some point their fingers become intertwined.
But he doesn’t have a reply. So he kisses him instead.
Harry sucks Draco’s first finger into his mouth, up to the knuckle. He swirls his tongue around it, and sparks of pleasure dance up Draco’s whole arm. He sucks the finger all the way in, and Draco moans.
Except he had. He crossed the street with the express purpose of hurting Malfoy.
At least not anywhere where Pansy could hear.
“Harry…” Draco has no idea what he’s going to say.
When the days begin to shorten again, he knows it’s time to go home. He finds a tiny flat in London and the job at the coffee shop. Almost no one knows he’s back.
“I meant everything I said.”

Draco clears his throat. “I have art club right after school,” he says, “and then I have to meet with an English Language Learner at the library… so about six?”
A year… a lifetime… of emotion crashes down on Harry. Wave after wave… he can’t catch his breath… he’s drowning…
“I’ll find you. I promise,” Harry say, kissing him gently as the chime, signaling the end of his hour, rings.
“Do you remember when Dean locked himself in his room for a week. Or when Parvati used to wake us all up screaming in… what was that Hindi?”

Harry is looking down at their joined hands. With his other hand, he traces Draco’s fingers… Draco shivers a bit… and up his arm. Harry’s fingers stop when they reach three silver lines running across the back of Draco’s forearm.
“Lovely. For the moment, why don’t you come along with me, too, Victoire?” she continues. “You can help me keep track of everyone.”
Harry’s scar was hurting enough to roil his stomach, and the nausea that witnessing this scene caused… that was all his.
“No,” Draco whispers. “I want to see you.” Draco touches his cheek, tracing gently with his thumb, brushing his fingers along Harry’s jaw. There’s a bit of stubble there.
“Snape told me,” Draco said, closing his eyes.
Draco looks up in time to see that Mr. Ainsworth is holding the door, and tipping his hat to a sea of bouncing red curls.
“Miss… Harding? I’m Harry Potter. I’m here to…”
“Yes.”

“How did you get here?” another voice asked. Weasley’s; it had to be, though Draco couldn’t bring himself to look. That meant Granger was here somewhere, too.
“Luckily, it’s

Harry’s quiet a moment, his smile slipping off his face. “I almost wish I hadn’t joined the Gryffindor team.” His voice is almost too soft to hear. “I mean I

Grimmauld Place seems strange without them—empty and echoing—but Draco would be lying if he said he wasn’t also enjoying long evenings in the library curled up with Harry.

“I told you. I’m on my way back from detention. With Umbridge.”
“It felt like it.”
Draco is not going to argue; the day didn’t start out cold, but a chill has settled into his bones and an eerie mist has settled over the moors. He casts a cleaning charm on his hands which is almost completely ineffective… and he finds himself staring at his own hands, black and grimy.
Draco snorts. “No. I’m fucking terrified.”
“I should have warned you.”

“She’s right, you know,” his boss says. “You do kind of look like crap.”
He hasn’t seen Draco in two days.
He is fucked in the most luxurious hotels by the highest-ranking members of the Ministry… the most illustrious of businessmen… the most impressive dignitaries. Once, even by a foreign prince.

Harry laughs. “I have bits of fuzz in my mouth.”
As his orgasm tears through him, painting them both in sticky ropes, it leaves him sobbing and choking on the word he can’t say:
“Fuck you, Potter.”
I have an idea for a dragon mug I would like to try.
. I work from home, my schedule is my own, and I have a reasonable amount of mental stability.
Draco pulls his hand free, turning his arm over. The Dark Mark hasn’t faded. Obvious black lines, a symbol of hate, are etched forever into his arm. Draco drags a finger across it.
He listened to Harry’s breathing, smooth and rhythmic, and tried to mimic it. The bed was surprisingly comfortable and he

“Harry’s going to be okay, right?”
“Have some tea,” the voice says, somewhere between an order and a question.
An odd, soft look crosses Harry’s face. Two tears fall. He leans his face into Draco’s hand, and more tears fall.
“So bring her along. She’s a pretty thing.”
So not he’s running late.

He’s quiet for a long while, then: “I dream… about the people I didn’t save.”
His name may be as old as England, but the man himself has ancestors that hail from the Indian subcontinent—he’s short, slightly round, and his skin is the color of melted chocolate.
“I know.”
A chime rings in the distance and Harry Potter looks over his shoulder, his hand falling away. “Here,” he says, and something drops into Draco’s palm. “I have to go… I’m only allowed five minutes. I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”
The day

Severus thought, running his fingers gently over the cover.

Weasley colors. “I want to get something for Hermione.”
“The world won’t end, Draco, if we’re a couple of minutes late to this stupid thing. What is it, the tenth one this month?”
“Really, Victoire?” Draco asks. “Why is that?”

“I mean… she can’t have… they’re not even
Harry brings his hand to Draco’s cheek, and gently… so gently cups it. “Are you okay?”
Not surprisingly, Potter ignores that, hitching a smile back onto his face. “I’ve picked out a film. Come sit down?”
It would be so much easier if Potter would change his mind and simply bend him over the couch.
“Not so much them. I know they’re not really leaving…. But my parents. Sirius. Remus. Dumbledore. Even Snape! They all left me!”
Or because Harry had let him.

“I’ve seen your mother,” he says. “She saved my life in the forest… did you know that? Anyway, I gave evidence and she was pardoned. Completely. She didn’t want to go back to the Manor, though, so she’s in a little cottage out in Cornwall. Right by the sea. She sends her love.”
It was broken by the appearance of a house-elf who shouted, “Master Draco!” and rushed to prostrate itself at his feet. “Kreacher is honored to serve a member of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black!”
“I… all right. But then you have to go right to sleep.”
He moans his name.
