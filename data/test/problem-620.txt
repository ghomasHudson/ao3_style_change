“Excuse me?” said Draco, raising his eyebrows.
to light his way, as his eyes have adjusted to the dark; and the moonlight still flows in from tall windowpanes at intervals along the corridor.
“Really, though.” Potter had a curious look on his face.
Harry scribbled down his homework before joining the flood of people leaving Charms class and spilling out into the hallway. Now he could go to lunch, and then he had Potions.
“Nice to meet you, Maya.” said Amelie smoothly. “How about you?”
“Er, yeah, but he did fall like two hundred feet from his broom. Someone cursed it and it broke while we were playing Quidditch,” explained Harry, somewhat nervously. He hadn’t forgotten Pansy’s promise to have ‘words’ with him if Draco got hurt. “And I’d like your help trying to find out who it is. If you think it’s possible. Also Draco has this absurd idea that he has to atone for every single bad thing that’s a product of the war and he doesn’t even blame the person who tried to kill him and he won’t talk about it.”
With a small pop, Andromeda appeared, arms cradled around Teddy, who was crying from the Apparation. She gave Harry an exasperated look. “Well, now I know he doesn’t like Apparating.” Harry chuckled half-heartedly, mind still on Lupin and Tonks.
“Thanks, Pansy,” Draco muttered wryly, waiting until all of the eighth years around them lost interest in the trio of Slytherins.
“Me too,” Malfoy says quietly, before walking away and out of the library. Harry stares after him until he disappeared from view. He slumps back in his seat with a sigh. Well, that hadn’t gone
He’d finished what he called a Healing Pendant, a small golden chain with a tiny stag pendant that he’d imbued with a Calming Spell, commonly used for patients with panic attacks or trauma. The spell simply helped them breath slower, and kept them, well, calm. He’d put it in a small white box, and wrapped that as well as the jumper and chocolates he’d bought. They might not measure up to what Harry had done for a Christmas present, but Draco thought he’d done a decent job.
“I’m fine being alone.” he muttered, fidgeting with his wand, fingers moving over the well-worn wood. It was true. He’d shut himself up in his bedroom most of the summer, or wandered the grounds by himself, which had worried his mother.
“Can we truce? I think both of us are tired of the rivalry. I’d rather not have it.”
“It was fine. She’s pretty nice, actually. Not like Parkinson.”
“Harry!” she exclaimed, giving him a quick hug. “And you must be Draco.” She hugged him too, and Harry stifled a chuckle at Draco’s surprised face. Physical affection probably wasn’t the most prominent thing in the Malfoy family. “Come in,” Andromeda said, standing back and letting them enter.
“Yeah, I’d love to go to Beauxbatons.” Harry sighed. “Maybe there I could be more inconspicuous.” Hermione shot him a sympathetic look.
“Alright you two, clear out while we do Simon.” commanded Camille, and Draco walked out of the bathroom, feeling like he was in a dream. Floating, but plummeting at the same time. He sat down on his bed, and Harry sat down next to him. Draco could hear his heartbeat pounding in his ears.
“Well,” began Harry. “We-that is to say, me and Ron and Hermione- thought you might be the Heir of Slytherin, so Hermione brewed Polyjuice Potion and Ron and I turned into Crabbe and Goyle for a night. Hermione accidentally used the hair of Millicent’s cat, that’s why she couldn’t join us.” Harry snorted, shaking his head. Draco stared at him, mouth slightly agape.
“It’s not so bad,” Harry replied, moving easily over the ice, away from Draco and then back, his black hair scruffy.
“Yes, I fucking did, because he’s a bloody Death Eater, Ron! He shouldn’t be here! He should be in Azkaban!” Seamus burst out loudly.
Draco sighed, clutching the edge of his blanket between his fingers. He’d been going back and forth like this for the past week and a half, and it was starting to wear on him. He so desperately wanted it to mean what he thought it might, but he knew it probably wasn’t. He was just getting his hopes up and acting like a dumb character in one of those romance novels Pansy read.
“Hey!”
“Could we cast it correctly?” asked Professor McGonagall anxiously.
He sat down wearily at the empty table they’d been at and put his head on his hands, sighing.
“Please tell me it’s not more dancing.” he remarked wryly, and Draco chuckled.
“We’re back,” said Harry, a note of wonder in his voice.
“Thanks Hermione.”
“Sounds like him,” she said with a grin. “Well, this is me. G’night.” She waved merrily and slipped into her dorm, and Harry went over to his, noticing the door was ajar from Draco entering ahead of him. He rolled his eyes, closing it behind him as he walked into the dimly lit room.
“Also French boys.” agreed Draco as they reached the common room. “Mother was delighted that I’ll get to practice my French, she made me take lessons as a child but I stopped a long time ago. Bit rusty.”
“If you make any loud noise when I tell you I will throw you off the Astronomy Tower.” Draco warned, and she nodded impatiently, waiting eagerly. Blaise also had a look of thinly veiled curiosity on his face and he leaned forward to catch Draco’s next words.
“Yeah, yeah.” said Harry, shaking his head. “Can you help me with the Transfiguration essay?”
“Oh, Merlin,” he said, covering his face.
Harry spent his Saturday finishing up some Charms homework with Ron, and playing a few rounds of wizard chess, which Harry lost spectacularly at. Around mid-afternoon, Hermione joined them and they pick their way down the rough path to Hagrid’s hut.
Harry can’t stop himself from yawning as he walked over to his bed.
It wouldn’t be prudent to insult the Boy Who Lived, but sometimes Draco really wanted to. It was almost too easy.
But Potter solved the whole issue for both of them. “It’s alright.” he said, looking at Draco oddly. Like Draco wasn’t like he’d thought. Then he turned back around.
The girl with him was watching Harry with concern, but Harry smiled dryly at the two.
“I’ll miss you too. And I will write.” he replied. “Don’t cry, you’ll make me cry,” he teased gently, and she laughed. Harry was then seized by Camille and promised the same to her, that he would write. Over Camille’s shoulder he saw Draco and Daphne saying goodbye to Simon, Daphne with watery eyes. Harry walked over and said a quick farewell to Simon before Draco grabbed his hand tightly.
the war, and Harry hated that he felt that way, because it was nowhere near true.
Another thing that piqued his interest was the sight of a
Don’t fight him, don’t get baited, chanted Draco’s mind as he stared coldly at the other boy, struggling to clamp down on his anger. He knew this would happen eventually, he’d expected it. Draco whipped around without another word and headed towards the boy’s dormitory.
His thoughts were interrupted when the smoke cleared abruptantly. Professor Athme was standing in the middle of the room, wand raised, and as the haze cleared Harry felt cool, clean air wash over him and he inhaled gratefully. With another flick of her wand, the room reorganized itself and people struggle to their feet.
Harry laughed again. "The pain is making you delusional. You know that you're the Prince of Badgers. Come on."
A date in muggle London.
Harry, face still crumpled into a frown, slid down further in his chair, bringing his elbows to rest on the table. "So first off you meant to tell me that we've been cursed without our knowledge and you're not freaking out in the slightest and secondly it was only used by academics? For what, sharing research?"
"Yeah Mione that's great and all, but I need to go now. I'll catch you later?" He cut her off. What was that about Malfoys mum? Ugh didn't matter time to grace the ferret with his company.
Draco scrunched up his nose.
sharp this morning. Much more witty than he normally did at this ridiculous time. After a few minutes of silence Harry decided to probe again.
"Fuck!" Harry cried. "Thank you, but I...I have to-"
think Malfoy is up to something." Hermione chimed in, mimicking Ron's open mouthed gape. She'd pushed her book to the side and was now trying to crane her neck to get a look at the Slytherins too.
"I wasn't following him. I just bumped into him s'all. I was minding my own business." Harry complained.
He was cut off as Hermione nodded enthusiastically. "He's gone back to Wiltshire Harry, back to the manor.
So Draco is soft. That's all u need to know.
Harry grinned. I love cake, you'll have to take me sometime." He elbowed Malfoy lightly who gently pushed him back.
Malfoy just laughed. "I comforted you last time so it's you're turn, prat." He patted the bed. It was one thing to do this in the dead of night where no one could see but anyone could walk into the hospital wing and see him cuddling up with his...his ex-rival-turned-friend-crush-and-occasional-bed-and-dancing-companion?
Harry blushed bright crimson. "Oh I. Uh. Right. Ok. Sex. Yeah. Ok." He stuttered avoiding Malfoys gaze. Sex had been an strange topic for him. He enjoyed the frequent solo activity as much as the next guy but something about sex with girls was morbidly off putting. He remembered Ginny saying something about him not having an attraction to her on their last date where she broke up with him, he couldn't remember exactly what she was saying as he was too busy watching the bartender (It was just interesting to watch him moving as he mixed the drinks.)
Harry, Ron and Hermione all walked down together with Harry shooting a '
"Madame Pomfrey?" Harry called after her. "Can I stay here? With him I mean. I just don't want to leave him. I know I'm supposed to have classes and all but-"
change when the megolomaniac who killed your parents is vanquished after all. Malfoy had already stalked off downstairs amidst Harry's internal battle but his voice still echoed around in his head. He followed Malfoy to the eighth year common room. It was still relatively dark downstairs with the floor to ceiling windows half covered with thick aubergine curtains. Most of the light came from the violet fire still crackling in the grate. Malfoy had already positioned himself on one of the brown leather sofas cramped around the fireplace and had pulled a purple fur blanket into his lap. He furrowed his brow at Harry and lightly patted the sofa next to him.
"Mr Malfoy why were you prepared to give your life in order to save Mr Potter?" The man said again, growing impatient.
"Right I don't stalk him. Ok maybe I did stalk him but only because he was up to something in case you don't remember. And no I'm not dating him Mione for fucks sake. I'm not gay am I."
"Yeah go mate."
It took a few shallow breaths for him to steady himself in an attempt to stop his heart trying to
"I'm a seer. Of sorts." Malfoy sniffed and wiped his face against his shoulder, smudging dirt across his cheek.
Pansy made a satisfied grunt and left the room leaving Blaise to loosen the ties. She really was a lunatic.
He stalked up to Potter's room leaving her and the Weasel downstairs.
"Ron!" Hermione said warningly.
, bloody hell Mione." He snapped. This really was rather ridiculous after all and he felt like he deserve to be upset.
Harry grinned.
There was no way he hadn't seen that. He really had no excuses.
"I see." He said stepping back and moving across the classroom to the door. "You know that you really do have a terrible temper don't you?" He spoke shakily, attempting to look down his nose at Harry.
"Yes thank you Harry." He growled.
"Now as you are all aware we will require a demonstration of the traditional dance you will expected to partake in during the first song of the evening. I require two volunteers and since Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter have been unable to take their eyes off each other since they walked into my classroom I am sure they will be more than happy to help out." McGonagall chided.
"This ok?" Draco asked which received another furious nod. Slowly he slipped his slicked up finger into Harry, up to the first joint before gently pushing in to the knuckle. He waited a few seconds for Harry to adjust to the slight burning sensation.
Harry tried to muddle through the day with a semblance of normality which was luckily quite easy. Double Transfiguation saw another round of dance practice where Dean and Seamus were humiliated first followed by Blaise Zabini and Neville and finally Ron and Hermione. Ron had obviously asked her to the ball at some point during the dance as she'd stopped altogether in favour of squealing and hugging him. It was quite sweet really. Harry had spent most of the lesson laughing at the stupid critiques Malfoy was giving all the pairs. He looked good like that, when he was joking and laughing.
could stand talking about steaming shit at stupid-o'clock in the morning, Harry's subconscious could seemingly only stretch to accidental sarcasm when breached with the topic.
"Is it dinner then?" Harry asked dumbly.
Granger sat opposite Draco and crossed her legs, leaning forward. "Let me get this straight, you're
The same guard from before stepped forward with another vial of Veritaserum, this time forcing it down Malfoy's throat as he flailed his arms.
Draco had kissed him gently in the common room before taking Harry's hand as they made their way down to Hogsmeade so they could apparate. They found a quiet spot behind the Three Broomsticks to apparate from.
He looked up at Malfoy who waved a hand, dismissively as if to say 'don't mention it'. He smiled and returned to his parchment. Harry realised that he wasn't actually writing but drawing.
Harry returned.
When Harry woke the next morning it was to the same, snappy voice that had woken him up the previous morning.
Malfoy nodded which the wiry man indicated to the quick quotes quill hovering behind him.
"Don't you dare fucking aplogise for that, the way they treated you was disgusting. That's not how a child should be treated." He could feel the rage bubbling in the pit of his stomach.
After a few minutes of explaining, Madame Pomfrey bustled around a cabinet in her quaters and took a handful potions from the shelves. Harry recognised a blood replenishing potion, a calming draught and a pepper up potion among the the ones she was holding.
This chapter contains depictions and descriptions of past child abuse/mistreatment. It's not graphic but please be warned that it is there.
was going on and there was nothing he could say to change that...Unless there was...Oh of course there was.
Harry felt his cheeks grow hot. "You're trying to tell me to take him to the ball too?" He asked incredulously.
up to something though. Just look at him. I'll have to check him out later. Check
Potter." He growled tugging at the neck of Harry's jumper before poking him hard in the chest.
"We were school rivals, we bickered a lot but took it too far on occasions. I regret that."
The Great Hall fell eerily silent after McGonagall's speech had ended; concluding the Halloween feast and marking the official onset of the 1998 Triwizard Tournament. The department for International Magical Cooperation had decided, after many months of heated conferences and public debates (and the unfortunate stress-induced combustion of one of the governors on the board), to re-host the Tournament at Hogwarts as a futile attempt to atone for the disaster of the previous one. Since Potter and co had won the war and Voldemort was no longer a necromantic pain in the arse, it seemed as good a time as any to bring Wizarding Europe together as one and completely distract from the mistakes of the Ministry with a little barely-of-age, quadrennial, ritual sacrifice.
think Malfoy is up to something? But Harry you
Harry took in the same gold and red decor of the room briefly before he felt the hard surface of the door slam against his back and the warmth of Draco's body pressed against his. Draco took hold of his wrists and held them above his head, pinning them to the door with one hand. Harry gasped as he planted wet kisses along the length of his neck, alternatively nipping and sucking at the sensitive skin.
He jabbed Malfoy playfully in the ribs with his finger.
Ron snapped his attention back to Harry and nodded frantically before plopping himself on his bed and facing Harry. "Anything mate, you know I'm here for you."
Pomfrey began administering the potions as Harry managed to hook his fingers into Malfoy's jaw, pry it open and tilt his head backwards. It only took a few minutes to give him all the potions, Madame Pomfrey cast a few check up spells before she was satisfied that he was ok.
"Potter open the fucking door!"
"You did a little. He admitted. "But I had some time to think, I spoke to Ron and Hermione too before I figured it out."
Harry grinned at him. Draco looked up at him again.
"Prat. Can I go into your mind?" Harry asked. It was only fair wasn't it? If Malfoy saw his so he should see Malfoy's.
The court room went silent. After a few seconds a low, rumble of chatter was heard.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Harry it's ok, Ron and I don't mind-"
"Draco!" Pansy whined.
Harry started gently, stroking his hands along the arches of Malfoy's bony feet they were bloody cold, he was sat next to a fire why were they bloody cold?
"NEITHER AM I. FUCKING LIE POTTER. NOW!" He jabbed his finger into Harry's chest again. He was now only a few centimetres away forcing Harry to look almost straight up at him.
Theo grimaced and ducked his head. “Point taken. We’re proud of you though, how are you feeling about it?”
"Gentlemen, now would be good." McGonagall snapped, clearly relishing in the discomfort of the two of them. She was a cruel woman, very Slytherin of her to humiliate them like this.
Harry stilled. "Sirius? You met Sirius?"
Malfoy had an opportunity to invade his mind on Friday morning, which seemed to be an achievement. In fact, he'd managed to wake up before the sun even had an opportunity to invade the sky on Friday morning. It was a rare occasion but every once in a while a dream that woke him up in the middle of the night was one that made his skin itch with the need to fly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No." Malfoy croaked.
Harry furrowed his brow and shook his head.
She'd added two and two together and made four although in this situation the answer was probably closer to Filch wearing frilly knickers than it was to
Harry looked up to see Malfoy grinning at him. He worked his arm around Malfoy's waist. "We did do pretty great didn't we your holy pratness."
"Is there anything you wouldn't do
"I asked you a question Mr Potter." He squeaked angrily.
Harry looked up to meet Malfoy's eyes, shadowed behind his mask. He had a gentle smile on his face and gave a supportive squeeze to Harry's hand. Harry gave a weak smile back.
Draco snorted and Harry found himself laughing too.
"Hello Harry I know this is a little unorthodox-" she gabbled, yanking Harry by the wrist and shoving herself against him in an alcove. The cold of the stone behind him was more appealing that her warm body against his.
It didnt.
with yours?" She phrased it as a question however the underlying sarcasm was almost paralysing.
!' Text and started reading.
He paused for a moment.
By the time two of them had made it back up to the castle it had only just gone twelve. Lunchtime was the most popular time to visit Hogsmeade meaning that the majority of students in third year and above had left the castle for a visit, while Harry and Malfoy were still out, leaving the castle relatively quiet save for the younger years who would likely be in their common rooms and the odd professor.
He flew for a few hours, relishing in the light frost which nipped every inch of exposed skin, he was wearing his normal pyjamas by had had the decency to put on his Quidditch leathers as opposed to assaulting his Firebolt by wearing only boxers. He found he didn't mind the cold when he was flying like this, the adrenaline high was enough to keep out the chills for a while at least.
"Then probably." Ron answered, nodding.
Harry had been chattering his teeth and rubbing his arms on the entire walk from the ground floor back to the eigth year dormitories. He was still deliberately bumping into Malfoy and Malfoy was doing the same back however, the sweets had been eaten before they even made it in the entrance and thankfully the giggling had ceased before somebody heard them. They only made it to the fourth floor before Malfoy snapped.
Instead Harry allowed himself to rest his cheek against Malfoy's impossibly soft hair and let his hands caress Malfoys lower back.
Harry grunted at the innuendo, refusing to give Malfoy the satisfaction of a reply.
vocabulary if
Harry smiled and gave an overexaggareted bow as the applause continued along with a few more whistles than strictly necessary. Malfoy gave a stiff bow too before scampering back to Parkinson. Harry moved back to Ron and Hermione, her eyes were also looking suspiciously moist.
had got there was a mystery too.) So a brain bond with Malfoy was only the third worst thing that had happened to him thus far this year, althogh, it was only October so still plenty of time. The universe was slacking in the mild to fatal inconveniences department after the whole Voldemort thing.
' who
Harry looked up to meet Draco's eyes. "You really meant what you said didnt you?" He exhaled.
Malfoy stared for a few seconds and raised his eyebrows before opening his mouth. "I have arithmancy now. Use your free period for research Scarhead."
"I'll ask him." He agreed. He was sure that nothing would go wrong but he would talk to Draco if it meant appeasing Hermione.
Harry noticed that Blaise had vines with orchids wrapped around his forearm. So that was what Malfoy was drawing earlier. He hated to admit it but Malfoy was talented.
"Actually sir I know who cast it, shortly after I informed my friends I was here with Harry and the accident that happened, one of my friends admitted to casting it as part of a dare. She wasn't aware of the consequences." The four in the room turned to look at Draco. "I'm sorry Harry I didn't know."
Harry hadn't been called in to speak at many of the trials. He saw to it that Snape had been exonerated and that the ministry knew who's side he was on but other than that he had kept out of it. He chose instead to spend the weeks after the battle at 12 Grimmauld place, sleeping and cleaning and reading. That was until the month anniversary of the end if the battle.
The Weasel shifted uncomfortably. He was wearing a bright orange Chuddley Cannons tshirt which looked ghastly next to his hair. He picked furiously at the hem of the tshirt and made a point of not looking at Draco.
Harry wasn't entirely sure he
Harry blushed furiously and ducked his head. "I liked the French names, and I want to do more than kiss you?"
It was Harry's turn to blush, he felt the heat rising in his cheeks as the woman in front if his so openly discussed his romantic endeavours.
The curses were still going strong as he stumbled in through the door, a few choice words slipped out as he tripped the step. The common room was mostly empty, he spotted Hermione and Ron curled up together on the sofa, Ron appeared to be asleep whist Hermione was reading.
"Will you say
Ok so like this chapter kinda made me sad when I was writing it but like hey nvrm. Also lowkey have a head cannon that after the war Draco found a load of old photos of Sirius and was like 'wow I wanna b him' so I kinda wanted them to have met at least once.
"What's so funny?" Malfoy frowned, a small smile tugged at his lips which he fought hard to keep down.
He threw scarves and books and clothes out of the trunk making space to find the one small vial of dreamless sleep he knew was in there.
Harry blushed. He should not be blushing.
"Yeah well maybe we just use the same soap?" Harry snapped, looking away from Nott and trying to focus his attention on whatever Seamus was trying to blow up at the back of the room. He didn't need to deal with Nott.
trying to feel up Dean under the table judging by Seamus' wide grin and Dean's heavily flushed face and Neville was staring so intensely at the cactus he was cradling in his arms that Harry thought he would probably try and shag it before breakfast was over.
"Er." Harry said again. For once he cursed Hermione and Ron's relationship because clearly she had indoctrinated him as he was being as vague and condescending, and rather McGonagall-like as she was.
The realisation hit Harry like a stunning spell.
Now here they were, less than a month into term bouncing around in each other's heads, he could hardly say it was pleasant having his mind space invaded again so soon after Voldemort was killed but oddly he could think of people he'd much
Before long Oline’s interview was also concluded and the three champions reunited in the room with Lydia loitering in the doorway fixing her notes. A man with the same dusty lavender hair descended the steps soon after. Draco recognised him to be the photographer; Myrion Lafant, Lydia's brother. He had been in Slytherin and was a year younger than his sister. Draco thought he had recognised her surname when she was introduced but, for reasons beyond him, hadn’t made the connection between ‘Lafant’ and purple hair.
Once back in the common room Ron and Hermione had announced their departure to 'Study' although it was oddly convenient that Pavarti Patil, Hermione's roommate, had left to go to the library ten minutes beforehand. This left Harry to sit on his own in the corner of the common room.
It wasn't long before Ron and Hermione returned. Malfoy was still asleep and so the three of them chatted about classes and what Harry had missed from Herbology and defence. Harry was still bloody hard throughout the whole conversation and it didn't help that Malfoy liked to...fidget...in his sleep. Ron had obviously noticed the situation in Harry's pants and kept trying to whisper to Hermione about it while they talked.
"Then what? Spit it out." He growled.
"Said he'll be here in a minute." Harry nodded to Ron and Hermione as the situated themselves against a wall outside the doors to the Great Hall.
Harry's eyes snapped up to meet the gaze of his two best friends. "They pardoned him? So he's-"
"Ok?" Draco asked tentatively, brushing an loose strand of hair away from Harry's eyes.
Harry kept out of bed, not caring about the time and grabbed Ron by the shoulders.
Malfoy started shaking again. Tears began to well up in his eyes.
"Ok then ferret face, last question, what other uses for the spell are there?"
"Potter it's not a fucking curse it's just legilimency it's not like people bloody die from it and yes someone has used it without our knowledge but it's hardly dangerous. As for uses: it was used for a few other purposes although there are minimal uses of it after the 1320's." Malfoy said pointing lazily at another book he had pulled from the pile which appeared to be an index of recorded use of various types of occlumency.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So something
happen."
thought he was weird. He wasn't even sure why he had offered. He found he didn't really like knowing that Malfoy was in pain but a foot massage? Really?
like being physically touched, he thought back to a few days ago with Malfoy's body pressed against him in bed or yesterday when they danced. He had liked that so why didn't he want that girl? "I guess I would say that I like being touched, but
Luckily any news about Harry and Draco hadn't been subject to public scrutiny yet which left Harry offering Dean and Seamus a begrudging thank you for keeping their mouths shut. The two of them had shrugged and informed Harry that it was much better to have him owe them which had made Harry fear for his life, dignity and sanity.
The inside of the room was cosy and warm with high walls lined with dark-wood bookcases filled with leather books of various shades of tan. On the back wall there was a wide, ornately carved stone fireplace with a roaring gold fire in the grate. The wall behind the fireplace was adorned with a number of intricate gold mirrors in a myriad of different sizes and shapes. A large brown, leather sofa, similar to the one in the eigth year common room, sat in front of the fireplace on an olive green shaggy rug. Across the back of the sofa an expensive-looking, fur-lined blanket was slung. In front of the sofa was a coffee table in a wood to match the bookcases with two steaming mugs resting on it along with a pile of books, a few lit candles and a crystal ball on a wooden stand.
The woman raised her eyebrow to her hairline. "Not enemies anymore then, eh? Always going on about your rivalry y'know, said you had the whole school wondering what the two of you would do to rile up the other next."
"Honestly Ginerva, what would your mother say." She glowered at Ginny. At least someone else in the hall didn't fancy hearing jokes about Harry's unrelenting hard-on whilst they ate lunch. Ron was still grinning, y'know, like a bastard, however, Harry was still distracted by the fact that he had come so hard he saw stars when he left the hospital wing to care all that much.
Harry shot into Malfoy's head before he stood up to leave.
"Oh uh-" he stammered. Was he really paying that little attention?
happen. We were right. I'm surprised the whole hall didn't realise. Honestly Harry you two have the subtlety of a three headed dog."
"Put the rest of us to shame." Zabini drawled, shooting a knowing look at Parkinson.
"Right then Mr Potter, as for what happened to you." He turned to Draco. "It appears that, unlike yourself Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter is not a strong Occlumens and has limited mental shields. Would it be correct to say that you are well versed in Occlumency?"
The healer coughed lightly, he was also now very red in the face. "I assume the two of you are aware of the Legilimency bond between you, would that be a correct assumption? And you know who cast it?" Harry shook his head but Draco looked up to interrupt.
McGonagall stepped forward into the center of the room and gestured for the eighth years to stand back against the walls. Harry noticed Malfoy against the opposite wall sandwiched in between Parkinson and Zabini who appeared to be having a conversation over his head, well trying to anyway, Parkison was about 5"4 after all and all attempts to communicate
"You have?" Harry frowned. How in the fuck?
"You kidnapped me!" Harry exclaimed. He was in the bloody Room of Requirement again. The room they had gone to after their trip to Hogsmeade.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So let me get this straight, or not straight apparently, Harry passed out because having sex with you was
anything." Hermione interjected.
Harry laughed at Malfoy's ridiculousness and let Malfoy lead him into the Great Hall.
Ok so I did some sneaky things right, so "Gedankenleser" pretty much translates to mind reader in German. Think that's it for the sneaky things.
The post-battle trials had been a long and gruelling process. There were the innocent and the guilty but so many others in between. The innocent who made the wrong choices, the guilty who made the right ones. The people who changed allegiance to the side they thought would win and the people who didn't fight at all but hid away or stood by in compliance.
The three of them were waiting outside the door along with the rest of the eighth when Harry felt someone creep up behind him.
"Want what Harry?"
Harry grinned as Malfoy sputtered indignantly he lifted his hands up and mouthed 'cool'.
"I know what it bloody is Mione." He grumbled. Harry just laughed at the pair of them arguing like and old married couple and grinned at the thought of a very elderly Hermione explaining to a very elderly Ron how a toaster works.
"Draco!" Harry cried. "Ron, Monione!" He wasn't entirely sure he had got Hermione's name right but he had given it a good go.
Harry found himself blushing at the innuendo but chose to ignore it. Malfoy knew bloody well that he was not rubbing
Malfoy snorted against the back of his neck, ruffling his hair.
Ok so I decided on a whim to switch to Draco's POV. Idk if that will be a pattern? Maybe every few chapters but we shall see.
So theres an issue in the bathroom...again.
"Do you want to talk about it? I don't want to pry into what's been going on with you today but you know I'm here for you dont you? We both are." She indicated Ron, who, as if on cue, let out a loud snore. The two of them laughed lightly.
"Now students, today's lesson may come as unexpected to you however, it is important that with every ball that is hosted at Hogwarts an accompanied lesson on dance and dance etiquette is provided." McGonagall said rather wistfully. Had Harry missed something here? Since when was there another ball? He bloody hoped they weren't springing a surprise murder tournament on him too.
Almost immediately a very tall man in healer robes leaned over him. "Mr Potter how gracious of you to bless us with your company." Harry felt like he should take offence to the words but the man's tone seemed genuine. Besides, he was far too sleepy to argue.
"Please Draco, I want you, I need you." He stuttered as Draco moved to attack his neck again.
Malfoy resisted again but only managed a few seconds before answering. "July 31st 1991. The day I met him."
Harry nodded and Draco gave a small grunt.
She smiled at him sweetly. "Of course, I'd gathered that Harry. Was just hoping that by asking, you might decide to tell me rather than making me tell you."
Just little fluff
"We were having sex!" Harry burst out with a grin. "Weren't we!" He tugged unceremoniously at Draco's hands. He had gone a very interesting pink colour.
"Wait you mean...Lucius...he, he hit you?" Potter stuttered.

are this board of governors?” Draco spoke up. He wasn’t about to be shafted for being an ex-death eater. He knew that despite the fact that the trials were over and he had been cleared of all charges as a result of Potter’s testimony, there were
"Good for you Ronald." Ron swatted her again and she giggled.
"Mr Malfoy are you quite well? You appear to have blacked out for the moment there! Might I suggest you visit the hospital wing?" The sharp voice of Professor Vector ring out through the room as clear, black eyes bore into his own.
Ron blanched, freckles standing stark against sickly green skin. "Right mate, um, not sure how to help you here. At least he hasn't turned u-" Ron was interrupted by a sharp banging on the door.
"Pansy I thought you were done with lacing my Shepherds pie with sleeping draught and tieing me to my bed but old habits die hard I suppose." Draco snapped. He really wasn't in the mood for this. Not after the last bloody interrogation, tickling charms really should be considered unforgivables.
"I just wondered what you did with your jumper Harry. It looks awfully big and smells very...nice." She sounded oddly surprised as she told him that the jumper smelt nice which Harry reminded himself to take offence to as soon as he got himself out of the awful conversation.
Their normal transfiguation classroom had been completely stripped of desks and chairs leaving the expanse of smooth flagstone completely open. Aside from the lack of furniture the only other difference in the room was the all-too-familiar, oversized gramophone from the Yule Ball dance practice in fourth year, still looking a little beaten up for something that spent the majority of its life being molested by Filch. At least Harry assumed that's what happened to it when it wasn't being used to humiliate students and generally make life hellish. Harry snuck a glance at Ron who had gone faintly green at the sight of it, of all terrible things that had happened to him Harry was fairly sure that the Yule Ball dance practice would always have a very special place, high up on Ron's shit list.
Harry breezed through breakfast ignoring the usual perverted and brainless chatter of the Gryffindor table, Harry was unsure that any other house talked about sex at the breakfast table as much as the Gryffindors did. After hearing one too many sausage related innuendos Harry left breakfast and made his way with Ron and Hermione to Transfiguration.
Potter let out shaky sigh. "We won't talk about it anymore. I don't really want to discuss it. Can we just sleep?"
Idk what to write fir summaries I am bad at them soz
"When did you realise I how I felt?"
The wards at the manor only allowed him to make it just outside the gates which were open slightly. Without thinking he raced up the long driveway towards the door and knocked hard.
Harry discovers a snarky voice in his head. A reluctant truce is called.
"Oh yeah? You use custom soap from France made from daffodils and gifted to you by you're loving mother Narcissa Malfoy? I didn't know how common that was clearly." Nott was smirking now as he watched Harry grow more confused. Ok. That's why Nott is a Slytherin.
"Draco." Harry whined, reaching his arms out as far as they would go and making small grabbing motions with his fists. Ron laughed again, even Hermione stifled a giggle but Draco simply rolled his eyes and let Harry take his hands.
"Yes well as you know not all of us have the self control of the Chosen Twat. Oh wait! Yes we do considering that the Chosen Twat has the self control of a hyperactive toddler and most of us have grown out of that by now."
"Are you aware that by using your ability to protect Mr Potter you directly defied He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and everything he stood for?"
Harry looked up to see Malfoy grinning at him from the sofas in front of the fireplace. He was sat with a few other eighth years. Theo and Daphne were cuddled up in an armchair opposite him, Neville was sat on the floor leaning on Zabini who was on the sofa next to Malfoy and Parkinson sat directly in front of the fire painting her nails this time rather than Malfoy's. Harry smiled back.
Harry growled low in his throat before standing up on the bench. "This!" He shouted, waving the Prophet in the air. "Is bullshit." The hall murmered but stayed quiet, great they probably thought he was bloody mental now! That seemed to happen everytime he tried to deny a Prophet rumour. Harry growled again, of course he would have to prove it, they couldn't just believe him.
I mean...what it says in the tin.
was your option number two." The words elicitic a low growl from Pansy which Draco reminded himself to be terrified of shortly after he stopped being monumentally pissed off at the situation and himself for being stupid enough to turn his back on his dinner with Pansy next to him, again.
"What do you mean more effective?"
Harry rolled his eyes. "You're one to bloody talk anyway. I have never, in seven years worth of dinners in the Great Hall, seen you stop eating after one pumpkin pasty. You have the self control of a first year in Honeydukes."
Malfoy nodded his head against Harry's shoulder. Allowing his body to go slightly rigid as he attempted to stand on his own.
Malfoy shook again, much more violently. The cuffs around his wrists began to leave angry, red marks against the white of his forearms.
“This is Percy Weasley with the Department for International Magical Cooperation. He will speak to you after the three of us take our leave.” McGonagall spoke again, clasping her hands together at her chest and beaming at the former Gryffindor. Percy nodded politely at Draco, Vidal, Oline, and the headmistresses. “And this is Lydia Lafant, a journalist for the prophet. She will interview each of you individually and then you will be photographed for the front page.” McGonagall informed clerically. She gestured to the girl behind her who waved and offered them a shy smile. “That is all I have to say, if any other head wishes to add anything then be my guest, if not then Mr Weasley is free to talk to you, and then Miss Lafant is welcome to conduct her interviews.” The other heads stayed quiet and so McGonagall nodded to the three champions again and led the women out of the room.
"Yes this is Harry from school."
“I didn’t want anyone to stop me, I s’pose,” Draco answered, ignoring the fact that Blaise had called him ‘little potato’ in favour of sneaking another look at Pansy; who was standing with Millie, Daphne, Astoria, Zaff and Eden; who appeared to be a good friend of the younger two girls and was shamelessly sporting her Gryffindor robes as if it weren’t a violation for her to be in their common room to begin with. The group were looking murderous and ranting excessively with flailing hands. Zaff caught Draco’s eye and scowled before nudging Pansy with her elbow, setting the five girls into further fits of unnecessary rage as if Draco’s very presence offended them, which he didn’t consider too far from the apparent truth.
He threw all his bags on the bed along with the robes and jumpers and decided that, much like Ron, he deserved a nap. Crawling under the warm blankets and duvet he fell asleep almost instantly.
"Fucking hell!" Harry hissed.
The man indicated to the court that Malfoy had attempted to resist the Veritiserum again.
Malfoy simply smirked and pulled Harry closer to him until their chests almost touched. Harry wondered if Malfoy could feel the raw heat emanating from his body. They continued to dance until the gramophone stopped abruptly at the end of the song. A ripple of applause sounded from the rest of the eighth years as well as McGonagall.
"You have strong shields, I can feel them. Are you an Occlumens?"
"Malfoy please I need you to stay with me! What did Snape use?"
Harry pouted and made a whiny noise. Hermione laughed and shook her head at him. "Come on let's get him back, the sooner he goes to sleep the better." Ron agreed and the four of them headed back to school by floo.
"What did you do?" Ron slurred, eventually rousing and fixing Harry with a blurry stare.
Flitwick beamed. "Right you are Mr Potter, 3 points to Gryffindor." Flitwick turned his attention from Harry and began talking to the rest of the class.
“Only as a classmate, I was a Hufflepuff too but he was in a different group of friends. I wish I had been friendlier with him. I’m sorry, I’ll move away from that now, you're doing great Draco." She spoke quickly, avoiding eye contact and sniffing before looking up again. "Do you have much knowledge of previous Triwizard tournaments?"
"Yeah I'm sorry. Look can I talk to you. It's about the trial."
"Oh?"
Harry pushed him lightly.
Ron and Hermione had exchanged a few hushed words with him about whether or not their bond had been affected in any way once McGonagall had left which Harry assured them it hadn't, he had come to recognise a light fluttering feeling at the base of his skull to be the magic of the connection and that had remained the same since the day before.
Harry awoke to a light tapping against the window next to his bed. Cautiously he padded over. A small, tawny owl was perched on the window sil, it couldn't have been much bigger than the palm of Harry's hand and yet it carried with it an official Ministry letter over double its size.
Harry laughed and nodded and made his way to the chair next to Malfoy's bed, he began casting various cleaning charms and drying spells and spells for stains at his school uniform and was eventually greeted with a somewhat presentable looking uniform once again.
didn't have to dance with his ex-rival-turned-friend-crush-and-occasional-bed-and-dancing-companion, did he? The answer was no he did not and Harry was increasingly jealous of the fact.
He bolted to his living room and threw a handful of powder into the floo. "The Burrow!" He called.
Also I apologise but chapters in Draco's POV will probably always be shorter just becuase I prefer writing from Harry's POV more, we share the same angry, oblivious, dumbass energy so it's only fitting. :)
Harry is absolutely fucked ;)
"I know you thought I was a spoilt, bratty kid Potter but I didn't exactly have the happiest of childhoods." He forced himself to speak softly for Potter's sake but the ugly, biting of rage leered in his chest.
Harry had managed to wake up
Harry is disgruntled and snoozy.
have sex, do you?" Draco snapped, shifting his weight on the sofa, causing a distracting enough movement that Weasely looked up for the first time to meet his eye.
"Malfoy?" Ron said gently, interrupting the tirade of thoughts that invaded his head. "It's ok Harry, surprised we haven't had this conversation sooner but it's ok. You're allowed to want anyone who tickles your fancy to press themselves against you in dark hallways." He huffed out a laugh and winked.
"They sell cakes and pastries Ronald, they have patisseries in the wizarding world too you know." Hermione chided earning herself a light smack on the thigh.
"Come on don't cry, I'm sorry I shouldn't have mentioned him." He mumbled.
The rest of the day went by quickly whisly the trio sat around the lake. Harry had finished his Transfiguration homework followed by a charms essay, Hermione spent the time writing an Ancient Runes essay that was probably about sixteen feet long and Ron spent the day throwing stones into the lake and spouting off Chuddley Cannons Trivia, very productive. Thankfully the rumours about Harry's cock had ceased completely by the time they had sat through dinner.
Draco took his hand again, leading Harry through busy streets swarming with people. Harry was oddly surprised that Draco remained unbothered by the sheer volume of muggles and the loud rumblings of buses, cars and taxis but, like everything, he supposed it was something a person grew accustomed to.
"Good evening Granger you look lovely. Evening Weasley, I would say you looked lovely too but I don't quite fancy being hexed." Malfoy drawled with a hint of a smile.
“You’re a bastard, you know that? Ron’s in Auror training with me, you know.” Draco smirked, and Harry scowled back at him. “If you say what I think you’re going to say- ““-That Ron is forever living in your shadow? No, of course not. I was simply going to say Ronald fights like a muggle.” Harry stood on tippy toes to breathe into his face. “Not true.” Draco rose an eyebrow. “Oh yeah? Prove it.” Harry cupped Draco’s long face and kissed the smirk right off him, exasperated and over-stimulated once again. Draco kissed back, and he had the distinct look of someone who knew he had won. Harry inwardly groaned. Draco pulled back and licked his lips. “Very interesting debate, but I don’t see how that helps Ronald’s case.”
His friends Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle were obediently trailing him, saying nothing as he walked along the train even as he came across numerous empty compartments. Draco wasn't sure himself why he kept on walking back and forth. He had yet to see Potter yet, but that didn't matter, did it? He clashed heads with numerous blood traitors, complimented other pure bloods, (even if there wasn't much to compliment) and flirted with girls he used to go to Wizard day care with. But he still could not sit down. It was only when he spotted a boy with skewed glasses jump on the train at the last minute, lugging his bags and white owl with him that Draco finally stopped.
Greg sat forward in his seat, screeching the chair as he did so. Draco turned back around so fast he thought he had whiplash. Greg barked. “You look like you’ve seen a dementor! Need a hit on the back?” Greg looked far too eager to oblige, so Draco screeched his chair back so loud it made Mr. Suan yell out a bunch of expletives. “You really are too easy to piss of the teachers, Draco.” Harry said, laughing from his seat. Draco gulped back a blush. Did he just call him by his given name in public?
But he couldn't control it. And even though he tried explaining, no one ever understood. They feared him. And sometimes he feared himself too. But now he currently had no choice, because he was forced to sit in the waiting room of a asylum, waiting for
He was thankful for spending his free time flying when he got onto the broom while only shaking once. Draco had already gone off by now, he was supposed to meet him by the portkey point. Harry wasn't gleeful about having to kill a Peruvian Vipertooth, as they were apparently known for being lovely human-eaters. But with the combined forces of them, Harry figured they could kill it off without much fleeing from a hungry dragon. Merlin. Draco really got the worst of them. When he finally got there, Harry could see Draco shared his thinking, holding his arms close to this chest with worry across his face.
, and it made his fists clench. But Harry never asked Draco to leave, and that made Draco selfishly feel better. Draco wanted to tell Dumbledore to stop, but he knew it would be better to hear from someone much older. Even if Draco questioned Dumbledore's intentions... the man could talk. Harry's face betrayed his emotions, but he said that he still had no memory of his old family. Dumbledore replied that it was perhaps because he refused to remember. Draco wished he didn't have to.
Instead, he set up charms and enchantments around the car as Harry watched. It wouldn't stay for long, especially with it being muggle technology, but Draco doubted- even if he liked to think otherwise- that they would stay for long, by themselves where no one could see.
Harry managed to get a popcorn box for free, thanks to Parvati giving him one as a 'founders service'. She said this with a voice which lingered past friendship, but Harry just decided to ignore it. No sense in trying to stop the teen girl's population of Witches from having a 'crush' on him. Instead, he weaved through the crowds, grateful for his short-lasting a
“Oh, crap. I forgot all about studying.” Malfoy said and rifled through his desk until he found a bunch of rolls of parchment. “And what do you need to study for? Don’t tell me you suddenly care about magical creatures.” Harry said this with a hint of bitterness, earning to the fact that Malfoy and his cronies hadn’t made Hagrid’s life easy. “Of course not. This is for the Potion’s exam. And it looks to me like you should be studying too. Merlin’s tits know you need it.” Studying? That was a concept that Harry never wrapped his head around. If it was not math, it was potions.
One one hand, there were many death eaters at the battle, but what were the chances one was in both? On the other hand, when Creevey had snuck in on that fateful day, the man could’ve easily been alerted on his status due to him overseeing the weaslette’s year-. This was too much for Draco at once.
She nodded gratefully and ran back down the hall, holding the bottom of her dress in her hands. Time to get this night over with.
Harry looked at him with shock, and Draco marveled in his own Slytherin power to be able to answer something that the other person was thinking in their head. Draco wondered if Harry would be a Slytherin. "You got me. I looked it up. But that was only after I remembered how insistent you were to talk sometime again." Draco was about to answer seriously before he realized that Harry was making fun of him. It should have infuriated him, and perhaps it would have, had Harry been anyone else, Malfoy's would never stand for such insolence, but he found it increasingly hard to be anything but appreciative of who-and
~.~.~.~.
Draco peered over his notes, full of both his writings over his wife's condition and his alchemy work. Things had been harder and harder for him lately, as Astoria's disease worsened and Scorpius grew more observant. He thought he had his study for himself, as it was late at night and everyone else in the manor had fallen asleep- he'd checked. But he had left his fireplace unattended, and green embers slowly burned in it. A call? This late at night? Draco furrowed his eyebrows in annoyance. He abandoned the messy papers that used to be nice and neat to kneel down. As soon as he did, Harry's head popped through.
“His next move? Are you insane? We already quieted him. He’s not going to do anything.” Draco whispered fiercely. But he knew in his heart that wasn’t always true. The voice outside of his head confirmed it. “He has his ways around blackmail. How do you think he got around the war? He just wants money for his family, like I do. And his target is you.” Draco’s heart dropped and he flipped his wand with a silent incantation. Hopkins flew to the wall. “Keep talking.” Draco advised.
The end is sweet.
After years of keeping infidelity a secret, Draco and Harry decide to divorce their wives and move in together.
"I assume so. He's a tough kid. Way more tougher than me." Draco looked incredibly worse for wear. Harry wanted to be there for him, but knew Draco wouldn't budge. "Are you still in custody?" Harry asked instead. "No. They've released me for now after he told his story. He's still telling it, actually. I was just let out and allowed home. Or, they forced me home, before I was able to even speak to him alone." Draco spoke with unreleased anger. "I'm sorry. I told you I'd make this right, Draco. I will. I'll get that guy, but before then I'm coming to the ministry tomorrow." Harry said with conviction.
to use a broom? He saw some, now that he made sure to pay attention.
Welcome! (LJ: Maiwiz) {April}
cared. As even though he acted angry, he was not going to get the professor in trouble. After all, he had Harry's full attention now. And that seemed to be all Draco cared about at the moment. "Punishment? Then you let me play against you in Quidditch. Since you saved me from that devastating fall and all." Harry had carried the brunt of the fall. Which seemed to be the majority of the reason people laughed so much at them.
~.~.~.~.
Harry had been looking for Draco for the past hour. He had his map clutched in his hands along with his cloak. Life had gotten increasingly harder for Harry, who now had the full force of Voldermort being back. Alive. And now he had, along with those who he found precious, had to deal with it. His Godfather was dead. He didn't know what else to do at the moment but go see Draco, who had been doing a disappearing act for the whole year. At least he had the Order. They had finally let him in completely, after Sirius... he didn't want to think about it. Remus had told him he could only focus on the present for right now. He could go after Bellatrix later.
Ron’s POV
{LJ: Maiwiz}
He knew by now that the girl was watching him. She looked the same age as him and Harry, and Draco hoped she was Harry's friend instead of- a enemy. That was what Draco was going to think. She had a mysterious look but was dressed in regular muggle clothes, so Draco could see why Harry would end up befriending her. Draco even wondered if there was something special- no, not in her personality, but if she was magical or not. She picked up the football left at her side and began to walk up to him. Anxious, Draco wondered if he should try to outpace her, but gave up when he saw the look of determination on her face.
He realized that such a plan wouldn't work without help. So he turned to Hermione. And then, Hermione, with her scornful expression that was enough to make a wizard wilt, told him that he better not attempt something so dangerous. Harry had no choice after the lecture but to command her not to tell Ron. She had stormed off in even more anger after that, and Harry was sure he'd get screamed at later. But that was something he could worry about
"There's only reason why the hat would be whispering somethin', Harry." Hagrid said worriedly. Hermione and Ron hung on with interest. "One of the successors aren't here. Why, well, I'm guessing they're trying to find that out right now." Hagrid finished. Hermione seemed as worried as Hagrid while Ron just seemed to be impatient, with a hint of curiosity. They didn't have time to dwell on it as Dumbledore was already walking back up to the front. Again, everyone went silent and Hermione quickly ran back to her spot in line. "It appears a successor isn't present in this room as of now." He confirmed.
Draco ignored her when he saw the library windows that showed a black head of hair and sped up. Black let him go, but Draco doubted it would be the last time he saw her. The head of hair looked up and saw him, he smiled before getting up out of his chair and coming outside. "I thought you wouldn't come after all." Harry said, out of breath. "Well, your friend back there had a conversation with me and said you were quite obsessed with me." Harry blushed. "I only brung you up
the show, piece by piece if they put enough magic into it.
"I'm not a bloody girl!" He managed, looking away in embarrassment as he opened the exit door, determined to just stand in the empty hallway until someone forced back into the ball. "We're not supposed to leave. You're quite the rebel, Harry." Harry nursed his drink instead of answering. "Okay, fine. You're stressed. Can't imagine why, since you're both famous
act like a dragon sometimes... "That isn't the point! I would've realized the importance of the situation!" Draco complained. Harry rolled his eyes. "Before or
“Oh, it’s terrible! Truly terrible!” He shook out, putting the flip phone under his ear. “The preparations, they haven’t been sent yet!” Draco didn’t know what this meant, but apparently Harry did, as he groaned and stepped closer. “Why wouldn’t George send them?” Anthony seemed to calm a bit at this sense of rationality and shook his head. “I think he said something about a Championship.”
Draco put his crayon down with a thump. He was beginning to get irked at this stupid drawing. He had wanted to draw scenery, so he had decided on the lake from Hogwarts. But the blue was beginning to mix with the green too much, and Draco thought it just looked like a big blob with no shape. He was interrupted by his glaring by a knock at the door. Sighing and pushing himself up he went to open the door for whoever hoodlum wanted to bother him at this late hour.
He flew faster and Hermione followed. He chanted the killing spell inside his head forever. He just hoped that Dumbledore was right, that that wand he spoke of could fix it all- if he even could find it in time. But Harry couldn't doubt himself. "Harry, there were horcruxes. Before you were here. The order has succeeded in destroying most of them, but there is still two out there. We believe there's one in Voldermort and one in his... snake." Harry looked at her in bewilderment. "You're part of the Order, aren't you?" Harry asked. "Yes. Ron is too, much longer than me, and Neville as well." Hermione told him. "I'll tell you about the other horcruxes. Eventually." Yes, eventually. If Harry survived.
~.~.~.~.~.
Muggle outer wear was in more than ever, and while Draco would never understand why one would wear a skinny jacket instead of a warm cloak, it was all the rage for everyone else, including his half-blood boyfriend. Yeah, he called him his boyfriend sometimes in his head. Don’t judge him. He finished the jingle bell wrapping paper and collapsed in a heap on his comforter, pulling his cloak tighter around him. It was freezing and Merlin knew why Harry was out and about in the first place, and it didn’t help that the wintry weather had inspired his illness in the first place.
Harry, noticing Draco’s position, kicked it to a teammate and Draco cursed from under his breath, “Greg! Left wing position!” He yelled and Greg scampered off, having lost a few pounds after the war. Turning sharply, Draco tried to corner Hopkins but Greg had gotten there first, being a bit too eager to tackle. “Ouch! Man, that hurt!” Hopkins yelped. The ball then went to a different team member, but Draco was quicker this time, cutting the teammate off and turning him around, causing four more tackles and repossession.
“Have you been talking to mother again?” Blaise put his hands in the air again. “What? She’s a nice bird. And from what I’m hearing, you’re getting nice with Harry as well.” Blaise raised his eyebrow and Draco knew he was in trouble for not divulging Blaise in this information. “What do I hear about being nice? You know, in a fraternity you can make nice with lots of people!” Draco winced. Justin’s peppiness was a lot to handle.
Draco smuggled a bag of corn crisps into his lecture, needing the suckers if he was going to stay alive during Finance. The class never seemed to end, it always seemed to require new material just to deal with Wizarding money. Stephen Cornfoot, a boy in his year next to him, was munching on the spicy version of the corn crisps and was making Draco infinitely grumpy. That’s when the professor cleared their throat and made Draco look up from the homework he was scribbling on from another class. “I want you all to work on a new project for this semester. Turn to the person next to you- “-Draco looked disdainfully at the nerdy Ravenclaw – “That is your partner. I expect all of you to work together to demonstrate how one might use cash flow to pay for their infrastructure. All instructions are in the folder provided.” Draco snatched the yellow folder that was summoned on top of their table before Cornfoot’s red hands could soil it.
Chapter 25: Baby it’s Cold Outside…
Everything was always calm and simple, like they were friends instead of a relationship. Friends who would kiss sometimes but never more. He knew what Seamus and often Dean would get up to, he wasn’t an idiot. And he didn’t want to think about what Hermione and Ron would do together. He wasn’t a bloke that needed the PDA, he never was. But the thought of doing anything with Ginny made him anxious.
~.~.~.~.~.
Note exchanging is cause for ignoring lessons.
{LJ: Maiwiz}
Harry, for once, couldn’t find anything to say. He went back to his bed and sat down next to Draco, holding hands tightly. He felt their world had changed drastically again, and there was no going back from it. He only hoped Draco could get through it. And I, too, he thought, looking at Draco’s worried face as the hustle and bustle continued and the whispering increased throughout the building.
“Draco! Hey, love!” Harry said, holding open the door with one hand and wiping a cold sweat from his forehead. He was wearing the cute beanie Draco had picked out for himself- and boy, if that did not make a warm feeling in his stomach. “’Hey’ and ‘Love’ are muggle words, Harry.” Draco scowled half-heartedly and went over to hug him, not caring in the moment that anyone might see.
~.~.~.~.
In the present, Harry still didn’t know what to get the hot-headed blond and standing out here instead of observing Draco quietly for any reaction to shopping in Hogsmeade wasn’t helping. Blaise nodded swiftly and held out a crepe for Harry. “Store bought, but still decent. I understand they’re important to you two now?” He said with a knowing smirk.
Draco huffed and sat back on the wooden bench. “Pansy’s got a thing for the dramatics. Blaise is doing some educational nonsense to impress his latest Step Dad and win himself a new broom. Theo’s probably doing Art. Greg signed up for regular Muggle History again, the git.” He twiddled his thumbs and slowly put them down next to Harry’s neglected ones that Hermione had snatched the pamphlet out of. “Where is the sport’s section, Hermy.” Hermione’s face flamed but Harry hugged her around the waist to keep her from fighting back. “What he meant to ask is can you read us the sport’s list, Hermione?” He asked, giving Draco a look.
. He told himself vehemently. He got back in the car after doing a mental-checkup on himself and his lower region. "I'm in trouble, aren't I." Harry asked Draco when he slipped back inside. Draco sighed. "Yes. But I'm here to keep you safe." Draco told him in a rush. Harry looked at him with wide eyes.
Witch Weekly
Sending the note, Draco leaned forward and sighed. He was really starting to feel for the people he never got to know in the living. If he allowed himself, that was. It was a lot to bear.
happy. And just because I spend most of my time either trying to fix your own crisis, doesn't mean I'm experiencing my own." Draco told him as soothingly as possibly, since he still wanted to keep his own ego in check. Harry grinned, putting a hand up to caress Draco's chin. It tickled. "I miss your drawings of me." And that did it. Draco pushed him farther away with a growl. "That was ONE time, you arrogant gryffindor." Harry laughed and grabbed Draco's hand. "Yes, but you'd do it again."
Apparently, he wasn’t alone in this puzzlement. Sue Li and her gaggle of friends behind her had already started to whisper and giggle, but Harry didn’t notice, being in his own world as usual. It was a wonder how he had stuck his head out long enough to find out a way to defeat dear old Voldie. Or maybe that was just dumb luck.
~.~.~.~.
Draco fumbled with his gift for Harry, spelling the wrapping paper on with one hand and signing off his name with the other. He had been confused and stiffy about what to get him, but Weasley, in an angelic mood, had tipped him off about a signed muggle Irish Quidditch jacket from one of his years at school, Draco couldn’t remember now.
Chapter 8: A Tricky Investment
Harry shivered as a reflex even though he had a coat that was way too big for him wrapped around him. He had just been dumped, discarded, and dropped-off at the nearest asylum after his last episode went too far, even for his aunt and uncle who had strangely seemed stubborn to keeping him. The tragic thing was, he probably deserved it. His 'episodes' as he begun to call them, were getting more and more dangerous. He had almost caused his prat cousin to blow up after him and his gang had came after him yet again. He knew he was a freak. His only-surviving family knew it, and even the kids at his old correctional school knew it.
"You shouldn't be so depressed. It's late." Draco nagged him at Harry's expression. Draco had acted like Harry's new scolding mother ever since they became 'friends' and when Harry didn't immensely dislike it, like now, he had to admit it felt good. Was this what Ron was looking for with Hermione? Ginny had never been like this. She'd always let Harry be headstrong, unless he was about to burn the place down. "Besides, you're about to travel with me, you prat. You should be practically jumping right now." Draco quipped, and Harry had to smile. He knew Draco wanted him to bite back, but he wouldn't, for now anyways.
He was probably the most morning person at Hogwarts. He would be up before any of the other Slytherins, chatting loudly until all the others would come up angrily until Draco’s endless charm or endless intimidation would set in. But now, all he had was himself and his loneliness. Oh, and Potter.
Seamus spoke up first. “I’ve been thinking of becoming a reporter. Reckon’ I’ll be a good one?” Both Harry and Ron nodded respectfully. Dean spoke next. “A quidditch player. I might not make it, but- “Neville butted him in the side with his elbow. “What have I said about self-confidence, mate?” Dean grimaced and the trio sat down at the table. “I, for one, am excited about the years to come. Cheers, mates!” Neville said, popping off his bottle cap as if toasting. The rest followed suit.
Harry shrugged, "Maybe. Think they have noodles?" Draco laughed, mostly in relief. At least Harry, the dim-witted git, hadn't caught on to his cheap choice. "What? I like noodles, just like any person who likes Indian." Harry responded indignantly. Draco stood up and did a quick cleaning charm on his hair in case there was any sweat caught in his locks. "I'm sure there's noodles, it's a Indian buffet." Draco shook his head. Sure, they had been mostly eating at fast food places and cafes lately, but Harry ought to remember main foods at their own University cafeteria. Oh well, there was no curing the Gryffindor's one track mind.
"I can't believe you just acted as if kissing me was a inconvenience for you." Draco said angrily. Knowing he had just angered the beast, Harry tried to slide away, but Draco stopped him. "Don't even try it. What's the matter with you?" Draco asked, peering into Harry's glasses as if the answer was actually visible in his eyes. Which it wasn't. Harry liked to think he was brooding at all times. "Nothing. You're just very trying sometimes." Harry said, crossing his arms. "Oh bollocks. You're in a mood and I want to know why." Draco insisted, making Harry meet his eyes again. Draco didn't have to drag him by the collar, but it sure felt like it.
“Ron, shut up.”
Chapter 21: Another Press Conference
The interview is here.
“These make me like a girl, Malfoy, no.”
"Oh. Hullo, Minister." He greeted, bowing a little just to get on his nerves. "Harry! I have told you this before. Call me Kingsley. And do not bow, I am not the queen." He guffawed. "Oh, look at me, getting all off topic! Harry, you must complete your preparatory admission by next week. You do not get off it just because you're the Hero of the Wizarding World, I'm afraid." He smiled his business smile and continued. "I do hope you become an Auror, you're quite fit for it. And it would be a great duty to all those lost in the war." He frowned solemnly, possibly for effect, and leaned down to face Harry. "Do tell me when you're finished, all right?" Finally, Finally, he left, in that stiff ministry way of his.
“Why are you calling me Draco?” he asked dryly. “You can still call me Malfoy, Granger.”
They’d never talked about anything like this before, sexuality or liking people. Harry supposed he was just a little surprised, only because it was the first mention of it. Otherwise it didn’t matter much to him, in the sense that it didn’t change who Draco was. He was still the same Draco Harry knew.
What had just happened, when he’d landed on Harry after Harry’d grabbed Draco’s sleeve and pulled the Slytherin down with him...Harry could almost still see Draco in front of him, his grey eyes wide and beautiful. Feel the solid weight of him on his body, the hands pressing down on Harry’s chest, the warmth of being that close to someone else.
"Mr Malfoy I will ask you again. Why was the safety of Mr Potter more important than your own life?"
"Well what happened then? You've been grinning like an idiot at him all through dinner and you expect me to believe that
Malfoy rolled his eyes again and shook his head as if he was hoping it would dislodge the pink flush of his cheeks. No use. He returned back to his drawing and Harry tried to refocus on his charms work although if course it was no use.
Malfoy was shaking so violently that the shackles cut deep into his skin, blood spattered onto the floor by his feet. Tears were now streaming down his face and he cried out.
Lydia giggled lightly, clearing catching the expression of intense dread that momentarily penetrated his patented ‘Malfoy Mask’. "Well thank you Draco, I could listen to you talk all day but unfortunately I have to interview the others." She pulled a stupid face and laughed.
"Shuff off Malffoy." Ron grumbled almost instinctively through a mouthful of his third helping of eggs. He didn't even need to look up. He' be an asset to the Aurors if he could sense dark wizards with as much ease as he sensed Malfoy's presence. Harry shifted round on the bench to face Malfoy who was hovering next to the table.
"We needed to relax his brain after the accident Miss Granger, the effects exhibited by the potions Mr Potter was given are the same as alcohol without the negatives. He is merely inebriated." The healer answered. Hermione nodded and Ron laughed next to him.
"Hermione is suspicious."
share his headspace with, which he supposed was a start. It was still unpleasant though, however, it was safe to say, it wasn't the worst thing to happen so far this year. No, that would be a toss up between almost being ingested by a venomous tentacular in the second floor boys toilets (how that had got there was a mystery.) Or having to face off with an oversized acromantular on the third floor corridor (How
"Ah, then another time." He smirked at Harry at reached for a small pastry supplied by the house elves.
(See the end of the chapter for
After spending another 10 minutes (ok so his attention span needed some work) in the library Harry decided to leave to find Ron. Both if them had a nearly two and a half hour break before their next lesson.
Harry has absoloutely no idea what is going on.
The two of them jostled each other the entire walk back to the castle, giggling and stuffing their faces with sweets as they went.
Confident in his decision, Harry tore into his living room to fire call Hermione. He had expected some resistance from his best friends although Hermione had agreed with him. Malfoy didn't deserve Azkaban. Surprisingly even Ron had agreed.
Ron caught Harry's eyes as he glanced across the Great Hall to watch the Slytherin table "Let me guess: You think he's up to something." Ron jibed, elbowing Harry sharply.
I aplogise.
"I told you it was all just pulling pigtails, Draco, didn't I tell you?" She looked stupidly pleased at the small act of affection.
always come down to-
Malfoy just laughed. They continued on like that for another thirty minutes, somewhere during that time Malfoy had gone into a sort of dozy state which Harry was happy for. It meant he didn't have to listen to the git.
After a few corrections on their form, mostly Harry's, and a brief outline of the steps from McGonagall, Filch started up the gramophone which erupted with a crackling pop before the music was heard. It was a slow tune played on a piano which Harry thought may have sounded like a song by an old muggle composer he had studied in primary school. Then again he never enjoyed music lessons at muggle school so he couldn't be too sure.
"Yes well I believe we got even when you berated
Draco cut her off with a wave of his hand. "Yes, you can call me Draco, Lydia. No need to be so nervous." He smiled, hoping that perhaps the action would make him appear less like an intimidating ex-death eater and more like a normal eighteen-year-old boy.
Ron snorted next to Harry and slapped him on the back. Hermione was also giggling. Malfoy looked very flushed across the room and was desperately trying to push Parkinson away from him who was failing to whisper in his ear given their height difference.
She smiled brightly as she turned back towards Harry. "Of course you can dear but do us all a favour and clean yourself up first first."
"No Professor that's quite alright, my apologies I didn't sleep well." He grumbled. He knew she meant well, she was one of many teachers he had been surprised hadn't shunned him upon his return although he suspected that as teachers they understood students from abusive homes who were coerced into action by less than morally upstanding pureblood families. He couldn't be the only one surely.
She escorted Draco from the room and called Vidal in next, leaving Draco to converse with Oline. She didn't speak with a foreign accent as he had expected. Instead, she sounded like she was from
"Shut up Malfoy."
Malfoy nodded slowly. Clearly that wasn't a wrong answer, Malfoy was still being civil at least. He leant back into the sofa, folding his arms across his chest. Still frowning, of course.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry snorted which made Malfoy smile. He'd turned around on the sofa and was resting his arms and head on the back.
Saturday morning saw Harry waiting expectantly on the common room sofa in a similar outfit to the one he wore to their Hogsmeade date, although, he'd switched the beige trousers for a pair of brown courderoy ones and the black tshirt for a white one.
Harry nodded and allowed his head to fall back against the sofa. "Yeah ok I'll sort this out."
Malfoy grunted and nodded his head.
"Yes."
Malfoy nodded again and yawned. He pushed his chin forward to rest on Harry's shoulder. Being inside Malfoy's headspace elicited a level of calm in him that he had never experienced.
The wiry man nodded. "And by 'Harry' you are referring to one Mr Harry James Potter, am I correct?"
"I'll stop if you keep that up. I'm not bloody rubbing your feet while you keep being filthy, and i'm not rubbing your dick as a favour." He growled.
"You're not...surprised? Like at all?" He blurted.
Both of them dissolved into fits of laughter, this was the most ridiculous situation Harry had ever been for the sheer improbability of it. Malfoy was fucking weird.
"Then why did you chose to act in a way that would ensure the safety of Mr Potter?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes and stomped away from the table.
Harry sat up straighter in Herbology. He hadn't been paying any attention (who cared about the theory behind growing dittany) he was more interested in daydreaming about Malfoy, of course. The voice in his head had surprised him, he knew that Malfoy took Ancient Runes very seriously and wondered what could be so important as to distract him from it.
to stamp on Malfoy's face if he was being honest. But Malfoy was right, the ministry were looking for any excuse to toss him in Azkaban, getting him off had been bloody hard work and he'd had to go all boy-who-lived on them on more than one occasion. As for telling: Ron and Hermione could help. Well, probably not Ron. Ron probably couldn't help. He could talk to Harry about the Chudley Cannons losing yet another game against the Harpies while
"It was a fairly common spell amongst academics in Gretles time and much earlier, owls were were far more expensive and required rigorous training and many lower class researchers were not connected to the floo network. It was far more practical to communicate via a legilimency bond." He finished, eyeing Harry warily although he looked somewhat relieved that he had managed to finish speaking without any further distractions.
The man turned back to the guard. "Mr Malfoy has attempted to resist the second does of Veritaserum twice, therefore a third dose is permitted."
Harry looked at Malfoy who he was glad to see was also biting back a laugh at the mention of 'hidden balls'. He could feel Ron chuckle behind him and heard the all too familiar smack of Hermione's hand on his arm.
"Ready?" Draco asked, slipping his arms around Harry's waist as they stood together.
Nott was grinning at him now and looked like he was going to burst out laughing. "I'm not going to ask why you're wearing Draco's jumper but considering how flustered you are Harry, I assume it was an accident. The scent is blatantly his though and that is very obviously not your jumper."
"Malfoy please wake up. Fuck. Please. What happened to you? Who attacked you? I don't know how to fix it." He was frantically undoing his shirt to expose the wound more clearly.
Staff and students simultaneously held their breaths as the Goblet of Fire spewed out the first piece of scorched parchment in a burst of sparks and ash, a tanned square charred at the edges. The heat of the Hall was overwhelming, punctuated by the nauseating saccharine of burning parchment that hung in the air and mingled with the musty damp of the castle. The full moon remained hidden by the overcast enchanted ceiling, rendering the faces of many students shadowed as they stared in anticipation and wonder at the Goblet.
"Oh Mione do you know what 'Mon élu' means by any chance?" Harry asked after they had all stopped laughing.
He lifted arm up and around Malfoy's neck and loosely fumbled with the other arm to grip his hand as McGonagall instructed them. Malfoy slipped his arm easily around Harry's waist and pulled them closer together. Harry tried to ignore the loud wolf whistle from Seamus that echoed through the room and the numerous snickers of the other eighth years who should not be enjoying this at their expense!
When Harry woke up on Saturday morning it was to a dick so hard it was painful and a very heavy weight pinning him to the bed.
Lunch was awkward to say the least. Somehow the majority of the Gryffindor table had caught wind of the compromising position Harry was in earlier that morning, or rather
Harry sighed. They were close enough to the hospital wing but he couldn't wait for Malfoy to regain consciousness. He reached under his knees and picked him up supporting his legs and holding him under his arms and round his waist. His head rested on Harry's shoulder and he felt his hair and breath tickle him.
“Hey, what program are you two in?” asked Daphne.
“Dinner,” said Draco breathlessly, his hands on Harry’s chest.
“Well… yeah.” replied Harry, and Draco twisted around.
“...next class, the last class before the eighth years leave, we will be brewing Amortentia, or the most powerful love potion known to mankind. Normally it would take two months, but these batches are in their most crucial and final stage so that you will be able to complete and test your potions. Homework is to review this recipe. You all can go now, and come prepared next class.” finished Professor Athme. Harry hastily scribbled down the professor’s parting words before departing the room. As he stepped out the door, however, someone snagged his sleeve and pulled him aside.
Harry merely smirked back, and for the rest of lunch decided to simply indulge for once and let himself watch Draco for as long as he wanted. Watch his blond hair, messier than normal from the December wind. His smooth, soft skin, that Harry’d touched and kissed. His striking grey eyes, his high cheekbones, sharp jawline. Full, faintly pink lips that Harry so enjoyed kissing. Draco glanced at him again.
“Yes, dear. He’ll be fine in a day or two. Now,” she continued, with a reassuring smile. “You two can go on, I’ll watch him.”
Draco pushed those thoughts from his head. Now is not the time for that, he thought.
Now Draco was the one to snicker as Harry blinked in surprise before leaving, throwing a smirk at Draco over his shoulder. Draco rolled his eyes and started to talk in an undertone to Pansy and Blaise.
Draco sniggered, twisted around in Harry’s arms to that they were face to face.
“Goodnight.” Draco replied quietly, and goes to bed. His last thought before he fell asleep was how beautiful Potter looked in the moonlight.
It was Draco’s turn to laugh. “That’s karma, Potter. Slytherin-style karma.” He kneeled down and scooped up snow, forming it into a ball between his freezing fingers. He could see Camille, Simon, Daphne, and Amelie throwing snow at one another and screaming in delight just behind Harry, who was watching them with his back to Draco. Draco smiled to himself, and walked casually up behind him, before yanking the back of Harry’s jacket collar open and dropping the snow down, smashing the remnants into the Gryffindor’s dark hair.
Some people muttered at this, but Harry wasn’t that bothered. Usually he would spend Christmas at the Weasley’s, but he could give that up for a year.
Harry also knew that Draco was withholding something from him. He didn’t know if he should push the other boy this time, especially since Draco’s face was quite stoic. Harry had a feeling he wouldn’t budge easily, if at all. So Harry, with a small frown, changed the subject, but resolved not to forget about it quite yet.
“Hey, mate.” he said, clapping Harry on the back. “Hey, Malfoy.”
He’d have to just make it to that day, somehow.
“Yeah. I can’t wait to see Weasley’s expression when he sees me-” Draco sauntered up to Harry and kissed him, long and slow and sweet, like they had all the time in the world. “-do that,” he finished, pulling back and smirking at Harry’s flushed cheeks. Harry shook his head, chuckling.
“If you want, I know a night vision spell.” offered Hermione, and Harry exchanged a quick glance with Malfoy.
“Yeah, could you cast it?” Harry asked, and she nodded and pulled out her wand.
And for the first time in a very long while, he didn’t hate himself for being happy. He thought again of the moment of that irrevocable shift from the person he’d been to who he was now, Harry’s words echoing again in his ears. You deserve a life as much as I do.
It was love, decided Harry. That was what he was feeling. Love, awe, the need to protect this amazing thing that had happened to him.
“Want to go flying later?” offered Harry as they took a shortcut through a door disguising itself at a bit of wall. Draco was walking in front of him, as this little passage was only wide enough for one person. It was useful, though, it saved them the trouble of navigating the moving stairways.
“Hey, Harry,” said Daphne warmly as he sat down with them, but Pansy and Blaise looked at him with disinterest.
Harry doesn’t know the time, but if he had to guess he’d probably been there for a few hours. He always made a visible effort to go to sleep, close his eyes and lay quietly in his bed, at least until the breathing of his dormmates slowed into unconsciousness. That way, no one got on him for not sleeping.
“Yeah. Godfather sounds older than uncle, though.” he remarked with amusement. Draco smirked.
“Yeah. Sometimes I don’t mean to speak it, it just...happens.” Harry explained, and Draco nodded.
That night, Harry marveled that they had already spent around a month at Beauxbatons. He’d enjoyed every single second of it, and his new friendships, as well as getting closer with Draco and even Daphne.
“What does that even mean?” he replied, and Potter smiled and sat next to him on his bed. Draco coughed in surprise but tried to remain collected at the steady warmth of Potter’s body next to his.
Draco’s left forearm was exposed, but there was no Dark Mark. Only a large, shiny burn scar lay on his pale skin. Harry gazed at it, transfixed and a little shocked. Draco suddenly lifted his head from his writing and looked from Harry to his scar, his eyes suddenly unreadable.
“Whatever you say.” Harry answered, his fingers now grazing the back of Draco’s neck. Draco shivered, and Harry grinned. Draco glared at him in the mirror that he was still holding up.
Daphne appeared out of the crowd and sat down next to him.
“He’s busy too,” replied Harry wryly. “Do you know where-”
Draco laid his head against the cool glass of the window and pulled up his sleeve. No longer was there a Dark Mark upon his arm. Instead there was a large, ugly burn scar. He shook his head and covered it up again, resuming his gaze out the window and avoiding his reflection.
He entered the library, smiled when he saw Daphne, then stopped abruptly. He had forgotten about Daphne’s bloody study group, with Granger in it. Now it all made sense. He closed his eyes in exasperation. She was a good friend, she was, but she didn’t know when to stop.
“Yeah, I’ll be out in a second.” he replied.
They said goodnight early and headed up the small spiral staircase. Dean and Neville were inside, talking.
“There,” declared Harry, and Draco held up a mirror to examine, frowning skeptically.
“Fine.” he muttered, and Harry smiled.
“For our next class, yeah.”
“Come on, you dummy.” said Harry, standing up. “Patronuses.”
They flew slowly to the ground, where Harry released his grip on Draco and Draco stumbled as he took a few shaky steps, sinking onto the grass.
But Harry needed that damn book. He carefully approached the small table where the blond is writing until he’s standing behind him, then he cleared his throat.
“But if I hadn’t let my aunt and the others inside the school-”
“Hey, Harry. I was wondering where you’d gone.” said Draco, looking up from where he was curled in the armchair, reading some book. He smiled at Harry, who smiled shakily back.
Harry pulled back and looked at him for a moment, his hands still caressing Draco’s skin. He whispered something in a wondrous tone, but it was a soft, sibilant noise. A smooth hissing, the whispers of which seemed to wrap around Draco, and he shivered, entranced.
“I think your dress robes are better than mine,” commented Harry as they walked through the hallways towards the sound of orchestral music. Draco smirked, taking the edge of his sleeve between two fingers and rubbing the smooth fabric between them. He glanced at Harry, who was wearing nice robes of bottle-green.
As Harry ate he pondered. Pondered Draco, mostly. He was acting as though nothing had ever happened, as though someone hadn’t tried to kill him just a few days ago. Harry hadn’t tried to bring up Draco’s I-deserve-to-be-punished-for-the-past thing, figuring it was better to figure out what he wanted to say than to just charge in and blurt out whatever came to mind. It was definitely a sensitive topic. Honestly he didn’t even know what to call it. Every time he thought about it he called it something different.
“I think so,” Draco mused. “She’ll just be very surprised and want to know how it happened. Hence the interrogation.” Harry smiled.
loud bang as they knocked aside the floorboard. Harry laughed as Draco strode back into the bathroom, muttering under his breath about “fucking Gryffindor commoners” and slamming the door behind him.
“...two feet of parchment on the history of the Bubble-Head Charm, and on the charm itself. Practice before next class. Dismissed!”
“Well, I can’t say I’m not bloody surprised,” Ron said, a note of amusement in his voice. “But now that Draco’s not a git- well not as much of a git-”
“Why did you get it?” asked Draco, his voice a little stronger than before.
“-and Astoria walked in on us kissing, only my parents kept her dreadfully sheltered so she didn’t know what it was. So I go with her back to where we were staying, and she goes, ‘Mummy, Daphne was touching mouths with someone! Can I do that?’ and it was terrible.”
His hand dropped as he watched the sky, and the owl flew off when he stopped stroking it. Draco’s chin dropped, and he breathed quick, shallow breaths. His eyes are squeezed shut, and in that darkness he saw his father, his mother, his aunt, Dumbledore, Luna Lovegood and everyone who’d been locked in the dungeons of his house…
The next morning, Draco woke up early and donned his robes. Walking down to the common room, he smirked and rolled his eyes.
“Why am I so bad at this?” Potter sighed. “You’re as good as Ron.”
“When did you tell them?”
“Better you hear it from me than from Pansy or Blaise.”
“I don’t know,” he whispered. Everything around him seemed so still, so peaceful, like he hadn’t just been plummeting through the sky. “My broom, it was jerking and then it just- broke.”
“Our own dormitory?” whispered Ron. “Bloody brilliant.”
“Speaking of Ginny, Harry-”
“Oh, nothing.” Draco replied nonchalantly. She gave him a look, but he ignored it. “So ready for France?”
The painting swung open and he stepped inside, eyeing the common room to make sure Finnegan’s not there. Thankfully he’s not. Just Corner, Macmillan, and Bones. Draco jogged up the stairs and entered his dorm room for the first time, which was empty. Good thing that cretin Finnegan wasn’t sharing this room with him, Draco thought. That git would end up strangled in the bedsheets by weeks end.
“Non. We just have very good gardeners.” She extended a graceful hand. “I’m Camille. Nice to meet you.” Draco exchanged a glance with Harry and smiled as he shook Camille’s hand.
“That’s Teddy, I presume?” said Draco from behind him, and Harry picked up the baby and turned around.
“Draco…” Daphne seemed at a loss for what to say.
“Harry. Has Draco said anything to you?” Daphne looked more worried than before, and her hair was frizzing up out of it’s normal, sleek ponytail.
“I told you I don’t care about that! You’re not that person, Draco, you never were!” exclaimed Harry, his thumb stroking Draco’s hand, trying to comfort him. I hate that he’s
“What is that? How’d it light up?” exclaimed Draco. Muggles were apparently a lot smarter and more innovative than he’d always thought, if they could do all these things without magic.
“You mean have I ordered new dress robes? No.” replied Draco with amusement.
“Come on, we’re falling behind.” he exclaimed, and the two of them ran toward where Draco was holding the door for them. “Thanks, Draco.” said Harry, out of breath as they entered the building.
“Yeah,” Harry turned and quickly said goodbye to Andromeda and Teddy. “Thanks for having me this summer.”
“It’s called being eloquent, you tosser.” retorted Draco.
“No, he’s great. Fun to talk too, even though he hogs the bathroom and takes up all the space with his beauty bottles. It’s hard to wake him up in time for breakfast, though, he stays up all night and sleeps really late.” said Harry, a fond smile forming instinctively on his lips.
“Oh, of course not.” replied Harry with amusement.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I love you too,” he murmured, and Harry’s eyes softened. The words were easier to say than he’d expected, but he’d been meaning to say them for a while now.
“Yeah. I was just thinking about that.”
“Don’t really know how to talk to me anymore.” answered Draco wryly.
the past.
“What was that all about?” she asked curiously, and Harry coughed.
“Good afternoon, class. I’m Professor Athme and today we will be brewing a Wit-Sharpening potion. Instructions can be found on page 32 of your books, and ingredients are in the cupboard. You have all of class to complete this.” The room filled with the sound of turning pages and clanking as students get out their cauldrons.
“Obviously,” replied Draco, smirking, but accepted a tight hug from her and a welcoming nod from Blaise.
Ron groaned. “Don’t remind me.”
“Are you talking to me?” Draco asked.
Draco shrugged casually, with a blank face, but Harry could tell he was frustrated. “Still nothing,” he sighed. “It just doesn’t work.”
“That too.” replied Draco with a grin.
“Oh, yeah,” said Harry, remembering the giant, stately Abraxans flying through the air, the powder-blue carriage careening wildly after them. “Well, that was a really good Patronus, Draco.”
“Back to school?” he offered.
“Once again, welcome everyone. I have a few announcements before you all go to your dormitories. First, as you all can see restoration on the castle has been completed. There is a memorial newly built in the Courtyard, to honor the fallen.”
“I don’t dance,” remarked Draco, a slightly apprehensive look on his face.
to stop kissing Draco and turn to his two friends again. Draco had a satisfied smile on his face next to him, chuckling.
“Yeah, he did. We shook hands and everything.” Harry said. “I don’t really know why I did it. I guess mainly I just wanted to not have Potions be awkward, neither of us really knew how to talk to each other after he apologized. So I figured, you know, he made an effort, however small. I could try to as well.” He leaned back on his bookbag and his hands brush the grass. He, Ron, and Hermione are outside after class, high up on the hill that sloped down to the lake, enjoying the last of the summer warmth.
“Falmouth Falcons. But the Cannons are-” Draco tried unsuccessfully to think of a word that isn’t so insulting- “bottom of the league!” he finished. “Rook to F5,” he added.
“Oh.” replied Draco slowly. “I mean, I loved him too. He was my father. And very strict with me as well. He always strove to craft me into his idea of the perfect heir, the best son. I never quite lived up to his expectations, though.” His face seemed a little more sad, though Harry couldn’t tell if that was because Lucius was currently in Azkaban, or from the memories.
“‘Mione, I know that tone. Don’t go feeling bad for that bloody twat. He’s not a house elf.”
A part of him wants to end it, right here.
“Close. The. Window. Now.” demanded Draco, still lounging in bed.
“Amelie, Harry, you two will be teaching Class 4. Lesson plan is on the desk, we’ll go back up to Beauxbatons at lunch.” commanded the teacher, and Harry exchanged a glance with Amelie before nodding dutifully and entering Class 4.
“So move, then.” replied Harry, smirking, his arm over Draco’s shoulders.
“...know he apologized but really? Is is necessary to befriend…” Honestly Weasley, thought Draco idly as he fidgeted with a chess piece, no need to be so unfriendly.
Chapter 30: The Bright Side
(LJ: Maiwiz) {March} Also, enjoy the little tidbit on one of the next year’s topics and the third year’s focus, if you can find it…
"I know... I just wish we could go to Hogwarts together. Without... him." Draco's heart quickened and Draco cursed it. Harry was obviously just being nice, and Draco had to go and get romantically attached to him like some pervert. He really needed to meet other Hogwarts boys, even if it was Weasley, Draco decided. Harry needed a better friend than someone who found himself staring into his eyes more than actually listening to him. As Draco found himself sweating in the winter air, Harry kept on talking. "I wonder what'd house I'd be in. You're Slytherin, so I'd probably be the opposite of that..." Harry joked with a smile.
Finally rid of interruptions, Draco made his way to a non-magical tree on the Hogwart's grounds and sat down. Draco was relieved to see bars come up on the stupid phone, and punched in Harry's number before it could possibly not work again. Should he call? No, that would be just as forward as he was before, and Draco had in good mind not to do something as embarrassing as that ever again. Thankfully, Draco had already stayed up thinking about what his first words would be, and sent out a "Hey, it's the guy from the library. I'm Draco Malfoy." before throwing the phone on the grass. Draco let out a breath of air he didn't know he was holding.
"A Hufflepuff at that." Harry said pointedly. Cho was, Draco thought regrettably, way more high-market then she had appeared. "If it makes you feel better, she was a idiot to turn you down." Harry scratched his head while looking down at the foot marks at the entrance of the Ball that they hadn't even gone into yet. "Well, she's the one with a boy a year older, so I think I'm the loser here." Harry said despondently. Draco resisted the urge to barf at Harry's taste in women and guided him outside where they couldn't be seen. "You think one of those carriages are empty?" Harry said once he seemed to be done feeling sorry for himself. Draco knew immediately what most of them were being used for, and his eyes widened in shock.
He looked at them back with superiority. They hesitantly looked away. Draco: 1. Hogwarts: 0. Since there were only loiterers left after all the food had disappeared, prefects were hanging around as if waiting for McGonagall or Snape to blow their whistles for them to hustle everyone out. Draco didn't have to look over at the Gryffindor side, he knew Weasley was probably staring him down with a burning look while Granger would look over at him every once and a while quizzically. Gryffindors were so predictable. In times like these Draco wished he were placed in Gryffindor, it would be so much easier to convince his idiot housemates that he wasn't up to something.
"Probably." Draco took a sip. His nose scrunched. "Most definitely. Your subpar accioing skills are good for now." Harry took the tea back and put it on the nightstand. "You could be nicer to the person offering you hospitality. Who is also your
Draco followed Harry out of the car as Harry had abruptly got out to pace out in the woods. "Merlin's pants, Harry, please get back in the car!" Draco yelled, feeling like he was dealing with one of the angry peacocks back at his estate. Except this time, this 'peacock' could do more than bite. Draco wondered about the full extent of Harry's power as Harry caused a tree to blanch away from him. Was it true that he contained part of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? "Did you do that? Wait-Did you just say Merlin?" Harry asked, stopping in front of the now bent tree. "No. And yes, I did. It's a wizard expression. You could use it if you want." Draco began, before stopping himself.
you knock me out, you silly bugger?" Draco glared at him, but Harry didn't break. Draco finally let go of it.
Draco snorted at the dolt part. Wonders never cease. He lifted his head up in time to see Hopkins staring right at him. Enough is enough, Draco thought, and mimed What do you want? To Hopkins. He responded with a jerk of the thumb and moved silently forward to the men’s. Draco hurried quickly to follow. The door swished shut behind him and he looked at the man who had clicked a camera to make his whole life go to hell. His father wasn’t even talking to him. He almost lost his internship because of this man. “What is it?” He snarled. Hopkins lifted up a surrender. “Hey man, it’s not what you think. He just hired me.” Draco rolled his eyes. Of course he did. Not like that prat had any real friends. “Why does that concern me?” Draco added. Hopkins checked the stalls before turning back to Draco. “I know his next move, if you have a price.”
Draco finds out about some inconsistency.
Draco snorted and pulled back, his nose twitching. “You do not need to act like a pompous 40-year-old ministry man, Dear Potter.” Harry half-glared at him and gestured to Draco’s side of the room. “You do not seem to have a lot of belongings. You aren’t missing anything, are you? Here at Winsdale we care for all students.” He smiled sardonically before continuing. “I can buy some for you if you want.” Draco huffed. “I do not need you to buy anything. I enjoy the simplicity. Though this place reeks of try-hard muggle inclusion.” Harry’s eyebrow twitched but he willed himself not to respond to the bait and succeeded. Draco’s hard-set eyes betrayed no notice of this, but he knew that he knew that he knew.
"That can't be right. I'm not a savior, Draco. I don't even feel like the The Boy Who Lived! I'm a
"Okay, Okay! Back up!" a voice yelled, and Harry watched in shock as Hermione appeared in front of the crowd in her own set of robes. Ron followed, trying to stand as tall and proud as Hermione was. "I'm sure Harry will tell
"There are two spots open, Harry. Enough for the both of us. They'd be idiotic to not take us." Draco had a knowing smirk as if he was planning something. Draco turned a blind eye when Harry had disappeared whenever bad things in Hogwarts had occurred, and had stood up for him, but Harry would be stupid to think Draco didn't have his own plans he kept secret. It was one of the biggest reasons they were still friends even after Harry made friends in different houses; they didn't ask questions. Well, they both had opinions, which lead to fights, which lead to ignoring each other even though they were both a dorm bed away, but it still somehow worked out.
“Why must you insist on torturing me instead of wearing sensible Wizard robes?” Harry laughed and silenced Draco’s question with a sideways kiss. “Mmph.” Draco complained but pushed forward anyway. Harry broke the kiss and started a brave quest onto Draco’s neck and chest, kissing down… A knock interrupted Draco’s startled moan. Harry groaned and released his hold in the middle of Draco’s pecs. “Just a minute.” Draco huffed with obvious loss and Harry smirked at him. Draco pouted as Harry zipped up his jacket and tossed Draco his robe back, that he had happily relinquished from him in the tussle.
Draco swallowed and stepped closer. "I know. But I'm not going to hurt you, Harry. I can promise you that." Harry thought of all the suspicious things that had attempted to get into Hogwarts the whole year. "But what about everyone else? Draco-" "-You need to trust me. Harry, do you trust me?" Harry blinked back angry tears and shook. "Yes. But I'm not going to stop following you. I won't let them change you." Draco laughed darkly. "I'm already being watched by different people, Harry. I don't need you as a protector." Harry thought immediately of Voldermort, but Draco had said different people...
(LJ: Maiwiz)
Harry meets some new friends.
Wayne was among them. He remembered him from frequent rugby matches and from Hogwarts irregularly. He stood out, much for his size and that he was the only one from Hogwarts among them. He also never knew Wayne to be a friend of Zacharias.  It didn’t sit well with him, and he cut a path through a small wooded area instead, trying to run away from the nosy reporters desperate for an exclusive with the ‘newly out’ Potter.
“Mate. Staring.” Greg sighed, shaking his head. Draco refrained from rolling his eyes. When did Greg get such a flair for the dramatic? “I really thought you being his roommate would stop this grudge you have for him. Remember what happened to Vince when, you know, a grudge got in the way?” He said, glumly, and looked down at the table. Draco hurried to placate him. Greg wasn’t the most insightful.
Chapter 4: Chronic Suffering
"You sound like a married couple!" He yelled, attracting the attention of passerby. Draco put his palm on Scorpius shoulder and squeezed. "Scorpius, what have I told you about-" "-Mr. Potter! Don't let him dissuade you! He's obsessed with you! Why, he always talks about you!" Scorpius interrupted his annoyed and shocked father. "He's not normally like this, I..." Draco said with embarrassment. "Oh, I know what he's like." Harry grinned at Draco and patted the boy on his head for his unexpected help. "So you talk about me, huh? For how long?" Harry asked as they dropped off Scorpius in his room.
"Is Neville Longbottom alright? And Draco Malfoy? They were with me-" Harry stopped, not wanting to articulate the next words. He knew he could be hearing the most awful words ever said to him, and didn't know if he was even brave enough. "Neville has been already released, with nothing but a few curses. Draco, however, was in quite a unforeseen circumstance. I assume you already know of his... condition?" Mrs. Pomfrey asked, raising her eyebrow in question. Harry was now increasingly worried. She must mean... "Well, that look on your face is enough of an answer of any. Longbottom attested to seeing Malfoy turn into a dragon. And while 'Nagini' and Malfoy were fighting, Longbottom cut off Nagini's head."

feelings for his friend. While both of them were
"Draco. What is so important that you are skipping class to talk to yourself outside my doorway." He hadn't noticed Harry yet. Draco wanted to elbow Harry and tell him to run, but it was too late. Snape already was examining Draco, possibly trying to use Legilimency, before noticing the extra outline behind Draco. Draco was proud still at Harry's ability to stay quiet, nevertheless. "Who is that behind you." Snape's voice was thunderous. Draco wanted to wrap Harry in his arms to protect him, but brave and stupid Harry decided to walk into Snape's eyesight instead. If Draco thought Snape's eyes couldn't narrow more, he was wrong. Very, very wrong.
Draco, in one fluid movement went up to Harry and grabbed onto his neck, kissing him boldly. Harry gasped and kissed him back, and Draco was happy for once getting the upper hand. It went on for at least ten minutes before Colin piped up. “Is this an inconvenient time?” Colin said from Draco’s bed post. Both gasped in surprise and pulled away.
If Harry didn’t focus on the hysterics of what was happening, he could focus on other things. Like his heart beating twice its usual speed, which was remarkable as most kisses were as calm as could be on his easily tense heart. And that Draco was completely calm, pressed into him, and he seemed to be enjoying it too. It felt like an hour was spent kissing. Harry now knew what the girls felt like in Hermione’s romance films. It felt like it should have been longer, Draco’s cool perfectly stretched lips on his awkwardly-big own.
"Hello? Are you alright?" The man said, in a tone of voice that said he definitely didn't care in the least, but was doing it out of pure politeness. Harry, not wanting to get off his broom but knowing he had to do it anyways, stepped off of it and stepped into the light of the flying lamps. "I'm fine sir, I know my way on a broom." Harry said, waiting for him to even spot him. When he did, he had to look downward to find him. Of course. "And you are... Harry Potter? The King of Gryffindor?" He questioned, as if he didn't know. Harry wasn't egotistical, but knew he was famous by now. The old prat wanted to look all high and mighty.
"Oh, he's such a looker now, isn't he? But I doubt that rigorous training program he'll be on in the fall will do much damage. Quite the contrary, in fact." Pansy was blabbing along the latest gossip while flipping her bangs around as if they were at a venue instead of a mandatory meeting. But he only partially annoyed at her for this, they had to know how to cope somehow.
"...Of course. We'll see." Hermione nodded and pulled on Harry's robe as she started to turn away from Ginny. Harry followed, not taking his eyes off him in case he lost him. Hermione ditched him once they got to the bottom of the steps, probably knowing he would be going to find Draco. He practically ran to get to point A to point B, not wanting to be the subject of thrown nachos if he abridged ones view of Gobstones. George was right, it had turned out to be a hit, and many were cheering on each team like it was a real sport and not just a board game Wizard-style. Nevertheless, he did want to get to Draco without nacho in his hair.
Harry was sitting on his desk chair with no professionalism at all, Draco noticed. He was swinging back and forth on it like a child, with one foot on his desk that had forgotten papers but still had a sock and shoe, thank Merlin. Draco also noticed that Harry was slacking and was open to an attack. Draco bit back any hopeful thoughts. "I thought we agreed you would not be helping me anymore." Draco said slowly, trying for a very menacing attitude. It didn't work. "Helping? Draco, We barely see each other. We ignore each other in public. Or
Chapter 28: Limited Vocations
Draco looked over at Harry, who was currently writing on a scroll by himself next to a window in Transfiguration. A bang fell back on his hair and Harry blew it out of his face, and Draco thought that his black hair really did look like brunet if you looked at it in the right lighting-
Draco was close to screaming. He had never been near muggles as close as he had right now, and he had never liked muggles. They had an icky feeling of no magic, and once Father had told him of all the terrible things they had done, there was no problem despising them as lower-class beings. Now, though, he couldn’t hide behind his Father, and Harry was providing no escape route either. He would just have to keep his head held high and complain to Harry in private.
and Draco was relieved he had ignored it after all. Draco was becoming rusty. Draco smacked the rising blush off his face like there was a bug.
Harry was dragged as soon as he walked off the stage into another room. Harry had the feeling he was experiencing a very bad dream. He blinked fast as he struggled to catch up with what the person who dragged him off was saying. "Sorry, didn't mean to drag you like that. Professor McGonagall told me to take you here and she's pretty scary when she's angry." The 'dragger' was Ron. There was no one else in the room yet, thank God for small mercies. Harry took a seat on whatever he was standing against, which turned out to be a desk. The whole room looked like a class, a regal one at that. It looked like what Dudley's school probably looked like.
Harry, incidentally, had 7 things to say about this: 1. He did not give a crap about Divination. 2. Seven was the second most bad luck number, after 13, and he did not need more of that crap. 3. Harry was something that wasn’t a secret to many people, he was not a deep thinker, and he could not understand half of this. 4. Seven apparently signified a lot of different things, and Harry could not keep up. 5. Harry really would like a Honey duke’s chocolate right now. 6. The ‘truth’ of this study was that he was never religious. 7. Well, he couldn’t think of that right now, but he could probably find something later.
-A Slytherin always knows better
There was an exaggerated sigh and Draco didn’t even lift his head from his arms. “Blaise, I know you’re there. You should probably talk to Pansy about that problem.” They had been dating ever since Draco had dropped the bomb on his preference, and he had given good will to Blaise. It was a match made in hell though, in his well-thought-out opinion. “I wasn’t even talking about her, Draco! I got the supplies, already!” Draco frowned, having assumed he had already perfected Blaise’s tendency of body movements when he felt a certain way.
off of you." Draco said, freaked out of all of his previous fronts.
~.~.~.~.
" Harry said, confused, stepping more inside so she could see him.
However, that wasn't enough to persuade Harry to leave Hagrid to the wolves (the students, who did nothing but judge him) and he walked forward as soon as Hagrid asked for volunteers to greet the Hippogriff. Immediately, Draco's hand gripped on his arm. Harry looked back and was about to roll his eyes, but Draco looked more like he was concerned rather than just being a prick. "Why don't you come too then, since you're so concerned for my well being." Harry yanked Draco forward, and Draco, looking back to
Draco flipped through his DADA coursework book before tensely sighing. They hadn’t spoken of the names incident at all, and Draco didn’t know whether to feel saddened or relieved. It was like Harry -whom he had now thought of him as Harry secretly in his head - had completely forgotten that It even happened. Draco wouldn’t put it past the berk, but it still left him more confused than ever.
Hermione had came with Draco in tow one day after what Harry heard what could only be described as loud rambling through the hallways. Hermione told him later that he had came asking for the black haired boy, as if black hair was a anomaly, and after Hermione asked him more, he described him as having green eyes and being his bespectacled hero. Oh, and he needed to see him immediately. Which he repeated
choice of a partner has settled money over a case that has never reached court."
The woman nodded in return. "Follow me, please." Harry stumbled after her, struggling to keep up with the fast woman who hadn't even glanced back to see if he was actually following. Finally in step with her, he caught his breath as they walked down a short hallway. Then Harry noticed something "This place looks a lot smaller inside than it did outside." He commented, hoping the woman wouldn't retaliate. Instead she almost laughed. "A very correct observation, Mr. Potter. You'll find out very soon that it is even smaller." Harry wanted to ask more, because he was utterly confused, but she just kept walking until they reached the end of the hall. The end with no doors on either side. Facing a brick wall.
It was really a mistake to put Harry and Draco in the same class in the first place...
" Draco added more seriously after Harry looked cross. Harry didn't want to leave his children. He didn't even want to cheat on Ginny. Which made it even worse when Ginny found a letter Harry was going to send Draco, making Harry effectively the slave to whatever Ginny wanted.
Draco comes to Harry's school, which is only creepy if you make it so.
Draco realized that sneaking out of Hogwarts to meet Harry was harder than expected. Snape had showed him how, and turned a blind eye, but actually getting away without fellow Slytherins noticing was the hard part. Draco could only imagine the blackmail that would ensue if someone found out he was leaving Hogwarts. Draco decided the only way he could possibly avoid blackmail was to be nicer to his friends than he had ever been before. "Did you just... save breakfast for me?" Blaise asked as he sat down in the dining hall way past meal time, as he almost always did when there was no special gossiping to be had.
Finally, he stopped at the correct door. The room was minimalistic and had muggle-friendly characteristics with two white beds, nightstands, two identical drawers, and wooden desks with a lone lamp on them. He saw that the other living inhabitant had already taken his part on the right side, with the walls already being adorned with Quidditch memorabilia and various other muggle sports team posters. The brunet was shown in the moonlight by the large half-moon window and was standing on his tippy toes trying to attach pictures to the wall with a tack in his hand. “Hello there.” He said in a sultry voice, succeeding when the man wobbled and fell on his bum on the top of his bed. He was wearing jeans and a Cannon’s jersey with hideous orange sneakers.
Harry saw the other half of anger at the welcome meeting of their frat. Iota Mu Xi was holding another mixer, and Blaise was at the attention of it all. Of course, he was also managing to slight Harry at every possibility. Harry groaned and passed out more of the butterbeer that Blaise had dumped on him. He caught eyes with Draco at the corner of the room who was smiling at him apologetically. He had been shifty ever since the paper was released, even more than usual. Now he wouldn’t even risk a kiss if they weren’t in their dorm.
(LJ: Maiwiz) {July-August} Sorry for the non-consistent updates, but I’m running on least-possible amount of work right now.
"Dumbledore? Who was that?" Harry asked, not wanting to start with casual conversation. "That was Bellatrix Lestrange. She is a death eater." Harry know knew that was one of the people on Voldermort's side. Harry had already begun to fill with rage. What was he thinking, letting her go like that? He needed to be fast! Fast enough to get her next time! And Dumbledore had just let her go too! "How did she just leave like that? Why didn't you stop her?" Harry yelled, all politeness leaving him. This woman had probably aided in his parents deaths, and Dumbledore had not even tried to kill her! "I will need to teach you how to use a Patronus, Mr. Potter."
Part One: Waiting in the Dark
“Nev! That’s not true at all!”
“Got to’ get out of here before they notice who we are.” Draco said In between huffs. He grabbed onto Harry’s hand to hoist him up but then pushed him back onto the grass. “Hey!” Harry yelped. “That’s for making my robes dirty, you prat.” He said, dusting off his poor robes. Harry huffed and got off his own bum again. “Am I in trouble?” He asked innocently, catching up to him. “Because I can’t thank you enough, Draco, for all the help you gave me and the tutoring, with that intelligent brain of yours.” He hopped back and forth between Draco’s two sides. “Keep walking, bucko. And I am a genius, thank you very much.” Harry barked and put his nose in Draco’s hair at the back of his head, thoroughly irritating Draco even more. “Wouldn’t forget it for the world.”
for Draco. He just couldn't involve him right now, not when Umbridge was up the Slytherin's right arse. She didn't like Harry though. What a surprise. Her and her many rules were about to be broken, and Harry was ready for it.
Chapter 17: Back to Normalcy
“I just don’t get why it’s called ‘R.A.T.S’. Isn’t there an ‘of’ in the name? Is that even grammatically correct?” Harry rambled. Draco had gotten his fair share of these from his roommates and knew exactly how to do deal with them. “It’s meant so when you get really frustrated, you yell RATS!” Draco enunciated. Harry’s eye’s widened in understanding. “Really?” He asked. “Because I could’ve used that.” “No, you idiot, it was named after wizard kind’s familiar, a rat. And you’re just trying to distract me from asking about your scores.”
That was all the girls in his house seemed to talk about. And they hadn't been doing any of that, unless Quidditch counted.
And that’s when things un-clicked, as Harry had just embarrassingly caught the fact that Colin could gather what had just happened, for he said- “Golly, did I miss this much while I was away?” And then it hit him. Ginny. The girl that he had been dating for almost a year, that he had awkwardly kissed goodbye and promised to call only a week ago. He tried to cover his shocked expression, and was unsure of the results as Draco had quickly looked away to pull out Colin’s mirror.
at him when he listed to her his 'condition.' She
was not as cool and collected as he seemed. Harry poked Draco in the ribs as Hagrid began to talk, as Draco wasn't even listening. "You okay there, mate?" Harry asked, raising his eyebrows. Harry was a bit annoyed, to say the least, he was excited to see Hagrid teach and Draco himself said he couldn't wait to 'best the animals' as he called it. "I don't like birds. Any kind, really. Definitely not the big kind." Harry couldn't really call it a bird except for the head and wings, but it did seem rather frightening.
Draco glared at him with heated cheeks, as if betrayed by him telling her. Well, what was he
Draco glowered before he perked up with a idea. "Before you go... are you excited about the Coronation Ball? I hear all the girls are supposed to fall at our feet just to impress us." Draco laughed haughtily. Harry was amazed at Draco's ability to change moods in the blink of a eye. "Not really. I don't like all that attention, actually." Harry
Draco spotted Harry when he got off the landing. Dressed in loose swim shorts that looked like they were bought off the clearance isle, old flip-flops that were tearing at the corners, and a baseball cap with a metal band that probably belonged to Sirius Black beforehand. "You sure clean up nicely." Harry told him, lounging on the couch with his feet kicked up on the coffee table like a pig with no manners. Of course, Harry somehow made his whole ensemble with no thought involved look handsome. "Thank you." Draco answered, biting his cheek to keep a blush from heating up. "Now get your feet off my poor mother's coffee table." Draco bit out. Harry rolled his eyes and dropped them to the floor. "Are you finally ready, princess?"
Chapter 5: Needs
“I don’t know. I’ve got other prospects.” Draco gave a side-eye. Harry snorted. “Like what, accounting your father’s payments?” Draco glared at him to shush him, but to no avail. “I just think you can do more than just invest in projects all the time.”  Harry made puppy eyes and Draco knew there was no way out of this, at least for now of course. “Maybe you should invest in your own…” Harry said, and stealthily moved his hand to cover Draco’s which was covering his papers of art.
{LJ: Maiwiz}
Draco is miffed, and Harry doesn't care...
“What do you even mean, Malfoy. Just because we’re apart doesn’t mean we automatically change ourselves.” Draco barked out a laugh and now Potter looked scared at what he was going to say next. Oh, Draco loved this feeling. “I wasn’t talking about those interests, dear Potter.” He took out a stool and sat on it, examining his long legs. “I was talking about your absent interest in women.” Potter looked absolutely flabbergasted and Draco knew if this continued he’d have to take pity eventually.
Wayne: “What are we looking for, exactly?”
Back to the scene…
Harry wondered if this was the end as Millicent and Greg had put their heads up and was watching Harry intently. Draco groaned and took hold of Harry’s hand and pulled him along as they all descended the corridor, and Harry thought he was much too tired for this.
Harry was about to lose it if Draco didn't answer. Draco looked up at Harry's hand on his shoulder. "Because..." "Because?" Harry asked, egging him on. "Okay, you know what? Fine! I'll fucking spell it out for you, Harry Potter. I love you. And I don't know why, or
Harry looked around the kitchen. Pots and pans were in disarray, and there was a mess on the floor by the sink. Harry took out a mop and began to clean it up with his wand, ignoring the way Blaise was looking at him as if he wanted to have a word. George, coming in to save the day, whipped open the door as he finished sending the mess into oblivion.
Harry nodded slowly, hoping that if he pretended he knew what was going on the information might actually make sense.
Harry laughed aloud before responding:
"Blimey." Ron sputtered. "Never thought I'd see the day when they willingly decided to spend time with each other. You sure about this mate?"
"Yes!" Malfoy spat.
Ron nodded.
Experimentally, Harry lifted his hand a traced a thumb across Malfoy's cheek, letting his palm rest to cup his jaw. Malfoy let out a heavy rush of air and Harry retracted his arm quickly. No, that was not a good idea. It could only end badly.
"Thank you Mr Malfoy. Now please state your age, date of birth and place of residence."
. Seamus, Dean and Neville had ribbed him mercilessly. Even Ginny had found the entire situation far too amusing for Harry's liking. It also didn't help that Pansy Parkinson, Queen of gossip, was claiming she had actually seen it unfold (which to Harry's knowledge was a big fucking lie) and was, along with Zabini, promising to sell the pensieve memory to a large group of 6th year Hufflepuffs who had braved a trip to the Slytherin table. There was absolutely no positive to the situation since Malfoy wasn't here to take any of the teasing.
Draco woke with a start. The scene in his head quickly faded out to black before his eyes adjusted to reveal the familiar moonlit room he shared with Blaise. What the fuck was that dream? It wasn't his surely. So Potter's?
Honestly thank you so much to everyone who has supported me through writing this, it means so much to me that people actively enjoyed the work. So yeah...not to be sappy by thank you ❤
After finishing up he curled up in the chair and focused on the slow rise and fall of Malfoys chest, not wanting to go back to class and leave him here.
As she finished speaking footsteps were heard coming down the corridor and a man made his way into the room. Draco recognised him immediately as one of the Weasleys, the one that was head boy when Draco had been in his third year. He was wearing a three-piece, black pinstripe suit with a sage shirt and black tie and looked surprisingly professional for a Weasel.
"Come here." Draco growled, storming angrily into the room and grabbing Potter by the arm. He collapsed backwards onto the bed and pulled Potter in between his legs so his back was pressed flush against Draco's chest.
Harry blushed furiously.
"I can see all possible outcomes caused by a direct action."
"Draco's taking me to the patisserie he used to work at in muggle London." Harry said lazily as he stretched out further in front of the fire, he recalled his earlier conversation with Draco in the kitchens.
"I need to go!" He sputtered and pegged it from the hall hoping that he had made the right move here.
"Never better." He grinned.
"She thinks we're...uh...doing things together? I guess like...a couple? I dunno. I told her we were just potions partners." He sighed still pointedly not looking at Malfoy and hoping that murder had cooled down to mild torture.
Harry jerked up in bed, flailing wildly in an attempt to disentangle himself from the stiff, white sheets that were holding him in a faux body bind. He was wet. Soaking wet in fact. Taken-an-impromptu-swim-in-the-Black-Lake wet. The steady drip of sweat onto his matress from his tshirt and hair rung in his ears. A dull twanging thud. Every sound was amplified as his heart hammered in his chest. The voice from his dream was an unrelenting echo in his head.
McGonagall turned for a moment to shoot a stern look at the two of them, clearing seeing through Malfoy's fake cough and deeming Harry responsible for it, before returning to her speech. "This year on the 13th of October Hogwarts will be hosting a Masquerade Ball also known as the 'Occulatum Ball.' Or 'Hidden' Ball." She continued.
Draco searched around the headspace for a few more minutes, drawing closer to a particularly loud spot that he deemed to be the source of the distraction. He pushed himself into the crowded space and found himself caught in a memory. He relaised that it was from early that morning at breakfast, he could see himself at the Slytherin table, Potter was focusing on his eyes and then his lips and then finally his eyes were dragged down to his fingers. He shook the memory off quickly. Potter was distracted by him?
Ron looked rather sick and Hermione was giving him a very pointed look of 'I told you not to ask.'
(Universe:163738299 - Harry: 0). He opened the door slowly knowing full well who to expect behind it although hoping that perhaps for once the universe could waver in it's unbearable predictability.
Draco followed the door to a dank, sweaty corridor that seemed to bleed the foul smell of decaying plant matter. He must be partially underground now since it smelt similar to the dungeons. He could still hear the ringing of applause behind him as he made his way to the room at the end of the corridor.
to move. The girl pressed impossibly closer, Harry could've sworn that she was trying to share his bloody skin with him.
"Alright then you, we'll get you your sweeties."
"Just tell us Draco bloody hell!" Blaise snapped. "None of us enjoy this but unfortunately it's apparently necessary to get any ounce of truth out of you."
soft?
"Well Harry it is very obvious really." She said glancing over at Ron who looked like it wasn't at all very obvious and clearly had no idea what the awkward conversation was about. He made a noncommittal grunt.
“He’s a knob.” Draco sighed, thinking back to his encounter with the obnoxious moron.
They lapped the square and came to a small shop with two white, iron tables outside and a few chairs of the same style with patchwork cushions. The shop itself was one story with a pale blue awning that read 'Le coin de Marie', which Draco informed him meant 'Marie's corner'.
"Parabéns, Vidal." He answered stiffly in congratulations, offering the same polite nod to the other boy despite his growing reluctance to civility. He found that he didn't trust Vidal. Something about the overbearing cheer he exuded was painfully off-putting to Draco, but then again he didn't particularly trust anyone; sunny disposition or not. He felt the same way about that bloody twit Ernie Macmillan, far too happy for his own good and fucking infuriating.
Harry leant forward over the bed and cast the same series of cleaning and drying charms on Malfoy's hair and clothes and then repaired the shirt which was was tattered from spell damage and Harry's clumsy fingers.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I was talking to Malfoy?" Harry answered furrowing his brow.
an early start, he wanted to roll out of bed ten minutes before breakfast and muddle his way through the morning, like usual. His face unfolded from the deep frown into a look of reluctant amusement as he realised the strong hypocrisy of his second request. The voice was clearly a bad influence on him.
Thursday's classes were possibly the most unproductive that Harry had experienced in a long while. Seamus had branded himself 'the Hogwarts Booky' and was carrying around a ratty piece of parchment and quill at all hours of the day, asking unsuspecting students to make bets about their classmates romantic endevours. Harry's plan to explode his goblet at breakfast had backfired in the worst way possible with Seamus offering his untouched pumpkin juice to Ginny who, without warning, had taken a huge gulp before it blew up in her face. Luckily Ginny was one sighted when she was angry and was too dead set on hexing Seamus' dick off to relaise that Harry was to blame.
