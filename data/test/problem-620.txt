Aphrodite’s palace glowed beautifully in the dark blue sky. Pastel colored lights illuminated the interior, giving it a soft glow in the dark. There were many people mingling outside, some more drunk than others. He was fairly sure that at least one of them were naked. Probably a minor god and a nymph. He shook his head at their childish antics.
“Good evening dear.” His father, Lucius Malfoy announced from the kitchen. Ever since his mother had gotten sick, he had taken over the kitchen duty for her.
Embarrassingly, Draco whimpered. The sound seemed to spur Harry on, who immediately started taking off Draco’s trousers and pushing his lab coat up his back.
It had been a month since the start of their mission, and somebody had killed Parvati and Neville. Nobody had any idea who it was or why anybody would have any reason to murder somebody.
He threw the letter to the ground in frustration, where it instantly caught on fire and was reduced to powdery ashes. No matter how much he wanted to stay behind, Harry was a man of his words. If Aphrodite called out the favor she had done for him, so be it.
Draco gaped at it. He was used to eating watery porridge and maybe some leftover fish with fruits for breakfast. Fresh meat was a luxury, and there was enough here to feed his family several times over.
Once the episode is over, Draco comes back to his senses and realizes that he's spilled popcorn all over the floor. He flushes.
Draco snorted mentally. The last time he had talked to a field spirit, things had not gone well. At all. Several terse words had exchanged, and he had never talked to another one of them after that.
“Yes. To my base station on Planet X. You’ll never lack and you’ll spend the rest of your days in luxury.”
Before Harry could answer, Draco came up with an idea. He quickly put Harry’s hair up in a high ponytail and grabbed a fine-toothed comb from the dresser. He slowly traced out a narrow strip of hair at the nape of Harry’s neck and pulled it out of the ponytail. He combed it out until it was silky and smooth.
Harry growled and removed his fingers from the blond, almost coming at the sight of his stretched, shiny hole.
Draco smiled and leaned back into Harry’s embrace as he stirred the simmering pot of soup on the stove. “Coq au vin.”
“Good morning young man. May I ask your name?” It took Draco a while to realize that Mrs. Weasley was talking to him.
“Oh, fine, I’ll make it five. But just this one time, alright?” Phillina had met him a few decades ago when he had ruined her pasture by practicing his then-abysmal skills on it (although, in his defense, how was he meant to know that it belonged to her?) and they had argued for over an hour before Draco’s mother had separated them. She had forced them to become friends (albeit reluctantly) but eventually the bond had become genuine.
, and didn’t even seem to care that he was covered in snot, sweat and tears. For some reason, it turned Harry on. He would have felt disgusted with himself, but he had passed that stage long ago.
That evening, during the Prince’s ball, he was approached by a beautiful lady. She was dressed in the finest of silks, had the bluest of eyes and the brightest of hair. Prince Harry was smitten. “Good evening dear Madame.” He greeted courteously. She merely giggled and started to walk to the middle of the ballroom, beckoning the Prince to follow her. The Prince followed her blindly, and they started to dance.
He started with raspberry jam. He spread it on a slice of toast. Once he bit into it, he nearly moaned out loud. The jam was sweet and tart and thick, and the bread was warm and crispy.
“Alright,” Draco said, not really paying attention to it. He walked over to the nearest sofa and sat down to read, not even wiping away the dust on his clothes.
To his surprise, Harry simply laughed. “It’s alright. I’m sorry for scaring you.” His voice was deep and made Draco want to rub himself all over him. He blushed at the thought.
“If you say so.” Draco shrugged. “So,” He started. “Tell me about your parents. What’s your home life like?”
Harry had noticed that Draco looked uncomfortable with the man he was serving, who was trying to hold his waist. Without even thinking, Harry had walked up to them.
Hey guys! I'm so sorry I've been gone for so long, but I hope that I can start regularly updating now! I've planned it for once every two weeks, so I hope that works out! Also, I feel much better so that's a plus too 🥳
“I’m busy, love. I’ll be done soon, I promise,” Draco curled his lip and crossed his legs from where he was sitting on the desk, his arse not two feet away from Harry’s face. He was in a snit again, not that Harry could blame him. For the past few days, he had been loaded with paperwork from
“When was the last time you bothered to comb it?” Draco sighed as he tried to drag the comb through Harry’s tangled hair- wait, when did the beast become
There was a loud silence for a few minutes until it was broken by a cart full of teacups and crockery and miscellaneous household items speeding into the room.
“I guess so.” Draco shrugged. Harry gripped his waist tighter, making the large shirt he was wearing bunch up.
It had been three months since Draco had first met Harry, and they had settled into a routine now. Every Friday, Harry booked Draco for the whole weekend. They spent most of the time talking, and when Harry was horny, they fucked. It was oddly relaxing, and Draco now found himself looking forward to the weekends now.
Draco wailed and pushed back as much as he could. His bound hands scrabbled uselessly against the wooden desk, leaving scratch marks that Harry would have to vanish later.
.” Draco moaned. Harry slowly pushed his index finger inside up to the first knuckle. When Draco whined and loosened up, he slid the rest in.
He whined and arched his back as Harry pulled it out almost all the way, then slammed back into him, hitting his prostate on the first thrust.
Blaise and Terry eventually had to drag a screaming Hannah away from the cafeteria and into the airlock room. They ejected her with just enough oxygen to last for a few minutes before she would eventually die of asphyxiation.
“I would be much better if you released me and surrendered to the city police. You shall not get away with this for any longer!”
With that, he stood up and left the room, only pausing to grab a sage and poppy seed cigar from a refreshment table. He would definitely need it, anyways.
Footsteps started approaching the bathroom, and Draco flinched when a large hand started rubbing his back soothingly. Another one used a wet washcloth to wipe his mouth and his jaw gently, cleaning away some of the vomit that had stuck onto it.
Ron and Hermione, his managers, are very unhappy about it but that's mostly because they have to spend their time sorting out Harry’s messages instead of shagging in secret (although, everybody knows they're shagging so it's not much of a secret anyway).
Harry feels his heart leap into his chest. He immediately taps on it and opens the message, not even stopping to consider if it’s real or not.
“I don’t know how you make this so good.” Draco said over a mouthful from his third bowl. Harry laughed.
Draco ran out of the room with all his speed. He ran and ran until he had no idea where he was. He stopped for breath, panting, and leaning against the wall. He needed to leave this place
A butterfly landed his shoulder as he approached the mansion, making him smile. They were always attracted to him for some reason. Probably because he always smelled like flowers.
Draco bit back a grimace. Practicing with his mother meant several hours of intense concentration, staying in the hot sun and generally feeling miserable.
“It’s alright Harry, let it out.” Hermione soothed, nuzzling his head with the side of her feathers. Crookshanks mewled and snuggled into his stomach, purring against him. Even Ron had blown out the candles on his hand to pat Harry’s head comfortingly.
Greyback groaned. However, when the beast brought out something from its pockets, Greyback shrieked. It looked like a few leaves tied around a silver rod.
“Come on guys, let’s start the mission.” Red said. “We can start checking out the vitals of the ship before assessing how much repairs it needs.”
He sped up all the stairs until he got to his room. He shut the door and sat on his bed, hugging the mirror to his chest. Thankfully Pansy was dozing, so he had the room all to himself.
I am so sorry I took so long to update. I have lot of things to work on, but I'm working on new Drarry stories!
He watches Draco pull his pants up and secretly mourns the loss of the skimpy thong. However, to his delight, Draco’s trousers are tight enough to make his arse even
close for Harry’s liking. Harry clenched his jaw as he saw Apollo’s grip on his darling’s waist tighten ever so slightly. That unfortunate little wretch. He bit the inside of his cheek and calmed himself down. If he acted out now, he would ruin his entire reputation just because of
They had been dating for almost a year now, and for the last month or so Draco had been upset because Harry was being too ‘possessive’ of him.
He waited until only a few stragglers were left. He ran out of the asylum and approached one of them, a farmer who was preparing to take his cart with him to the forest.
Ever since that day, they had spent all their remaining time together, chatting or playing around or fucking. It was even up to the point that Harry had booked Draco every night for the foreseeable future.
He got up and ran up to the door, cursing as he realized that it was locked. He assumed that Cedric had proceeded to take him to the mental asylum, the bastard.
.” Draco begged. With a snarl, Harry snapped his hips and pushed in all the way to the hilt. He started to pump in and out of Draco’s tight, wonderful,
“Thanks a lot, mate. I’ll see you around!” Potter grinned. He placed the gold coins on the counter, where they magically floated into the money register.
They all started talking about people Draco had never heard before. Cormac was the first to notice his confusion.
He sighed and pulled off the silk covers from his body. The orange-red glow of the sunrise lit up his room and tinted his skin to warm shades of peach and honey. He slipped off his night gown and stretched widely, grimacing as his bones cracked and shifted back into place from lying down for so long. Since his mother was fast asleep (and would probably be so for the next few hours, at least) this would be the
Zeus’ grin turned dark, and Harry momentarily wondered just what he had done do her.* “Quite a while ago. But that doesn’t matter now, does it?”
“You’re feisty.” It commented with a raised eyebrow. Draco scowled and sat up in his bed, wincing as his middle protested. The beast hissed and got up from its chair to adjust Draco back into a lying position. For once, Draco didn’t talk.
Harry grinned. “Take her to the Fields.” He motioned to his ghoulish guards, who nodded and dragged the woman into the depths of Tartarus, ignoring her threats and screams.
Instead of answering, Harry sidestepped him yet again and started to hum as he continued down the hallway. And yet again, Kore stepped in front of him. Some violently red flowers were starting to bloom on his robes, and Harry became even more endeared with him.
Harry steadily undid Draco’s robes and spread them open, exposing his body. He stared openly at Draco’s body, making the blond blush.
“Yes, and they agreed to teach me. It will take some time, but I’m sure I can master it.” He said sweetly. His mother smiled brightly at him and leaned down to give him a soft kiss on his forehead. Her blond hair brushed his forehead. It smelled strongly of freshly baked bread, for some odd reason.
“There is no curfew, Carpo! I’ll come back whenever I want,” he jested, sticking his tongue out rudely and crossing his eyes.
“Yes. This time it’s a planet called Alpha. They are similar to East Roamers, but are much worse. They’ve even set up another planet as a base.”
“Don’t touch me.” Draco snarled, trying to pull his hands away. It paid him no mind as it used its other hand to hastily grab two tea cloths and wrap Draco’s hands in them carefully.
. He didn’t even know why he was getting turned on just from a simple touch. Well, Draco did have that effect on him.
Harry wanted to take him apart and put him back together, to make him weep and to make him howl with laughter, to be his master and his slave and his
Olympus was a glorious place. Even Draco couldn’t deny it. Each mountain ridge had buildings and houses more beautiful than the last. It was a blur of polished marble, pure gold and hundreds, if not
A few minutes later, his coffee was ready. He took the drink and walked over to an empty table. He scrolled through his TikTok for-you-page, not noticing as someone sat down in front of him.
The mention of the beast dampened Draco’s mood a bit. However, he didn’t let it show. He was grateful to Pansy, and he didn’t want her to see him sad.
Draco rolled his eyes from where he was seated on Harry’s lap. “I don’t know how many times I have to tell you idiots, but Harry is
A lot happens in this chapter, so I hope you enjoy it. I hope its not substandard, but I don't feel like I did it as well as I usually do :/
As they walk down the stairs to the garage, Draco takes a moment to look at Harry properly. Harry’s hair is like a rat’s nest, but he somehow pulls off the look. He’s only wearing a green sweater with a big ‘H’ on it and jeans with some black Vans. All in all, a rather simple getup, compared to Draco’s outfit.
He looked into the bottom part of the mirror that was still intact. In it, he could see several pairs of feet and what looked like a cat at their feet. Crookshanks probably.
He smirked to himself, and strutted away from the room, not noticing as another piece of glass fell off of the mirror.
Suddenly, he heard a tree branch snap. He froze. Slowly, he turned to his left and almost wet his pants. There was a very large man standing a few feet away from him. But the man looked… animalistic. Even more so than the beast. The man had fur on his face, claws, and looked distinctly… wolfish.
“Granger, what the fuck are you talking about? I’m not doing anything with Potter!” Draco exclaimed, schooling his features into a disbelieving look.
“Good morning.” It rumbled. Draco noticed that it was over a foot taller than him. Draco was a respectable five foot eleven, but the beast was gigantic.
“Here’s some tea! It should help you feel better.” She chirped. Draco’s smile widened, and he gracefully picked up Ginny from the cart. He sat up marginally, enough for him to be able to raise his head well. The beast hissed but didn’t say anything. Draco ignored it.
He sat on it and groaned softly as his body finally relaxed. This was familiar, this was comfortable, this was his nature. Settling into his royal throne, ruling over everybody in his world and crushing any opposition with a simple command.
As he rubbed the honey mixture onto his face, he pondered idly about the party itself. Aphrodite would definitely overdo it, as she tended to do, but there were a few, ridiculous rumors going around that she had managed to invite to invite the God of the Underworld
“T-thank you?” Draco stammered, tucking a strand of loose blond hair behind his ear. He was obviously wondering why Harry had bothered to help him at all. Hell, Harry
“Why you little-“ She lunged for him, but he smirked and teleported away a fraction of a second before she caught him.
“You’re beautiful.” Draco blushed. Harry moved down to trail kisses down his neck. Draco gasped when Harry sucked hard at a spot, leaving a red mark behind.
“Lie down.” He said quietly. Draco let out a breath and lay down on the bed, his head falling softly into the pillows.
Everybody nodded and started to go in different directions. As Cho left the entrance of the ship, she caught something strange that Red whispered to White.
“You like that, don’t you?” Harry asked mockingly. Draco nodded eagerly. His flushed pink cock was already leaking precum and staining his skirt. Harry bit back a moan at the sight.
Harry gulps and instantly saves the picture onto his phone. Thankfully, it doesn’t show up in the chat room and Harry quickly sends out a quick thanks to whatever gods are out there.
Crown Prince Harry Potter of Gryffindoria was a very arrogant man. Ever since King James Potter and Queen Lily Potter had passed away when he was 17, he had forgotten all his morals and become a reckless lad. He collected extravagant taxes, slept around with men and women alike from the brothel every night, and wasted his money holding lavish balls instead of helping his people.
“Hey. Don’t cry, love.” Harry frowned when he felt tears start to wet his chest. He lifted Draco’s head up by the chin and kissed away the two fat droplets that had gathered in his silver eyes. Draco closed his eyes and took a shuddering breath.
They talked for over two hours before they realized how late it was. Harry was a genuinely friendly and funny person, and Draco really enjoyed talking to him.
As usual, the square was empty this early in the morning save for some early risers who had started to stock up their stalls with their goods. The warm, sweet scent of ambrosia teased his nose and Draco impulsively decided to stop and get some freshly baked cakes before he headed down to earth.
It was a bit easier now that Harry had shrunk a few inches. He was still taller than Draco, but only by about a couple of inches now compared to the whole foot from before.
Not even ten minutes later, the door opened again. Harry perked up and spun around to at least try and apologize; even though it probably (read: definitely) wouldn’t work, it was still worth a try.
“I would like to tell you something, Crown Prince.” She said flirtatiously, while they were dancing.
He allowed the beast to push him into the cell and lock the door. Then, it walked away, half dragging his father with it. Once they were gone, Draco put his head in his hands and cried.
1 was a soft boy aesthetic, a cropped oversized striped blue and black shirt with a white collar, relaxed jeans and white Vans. 2 was the classic e-boy outfit, with a large white shirt over a black and white striped long sleeve shirt with black ripped jeans and checkered Vans. 3 was a black turtleneck with grey joggers and black and white striped Adidas.
His strokes gradually became slower as he allowed his mind to wander and trace out each of the constellations in the sky. Libra, Scorpio, Orion, Delphinus, and hundreds more glittered in the inky black sky. They were all beautiful in their own special way.
“He still is.” He said ruefully. He started talking to her about his day, only interrupted by his father’s yell from the kitchen.
He gently rubbed a finger over it, reveling in the whimper Draco let out. He leaned forward and licked it.
Draco picked up a small potion from behind the register and bagged it with the other tooth ache potion.
Once Draco arrived at the village, he got down and started rushing his father to the hospital, ignoring the stares and the whispers from everybody. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t experienced it every day when things were still normal.
The townspeople cheered as Harry led Draco to the middle of the wedding hall. They had decided to get married in the palace, and it had not taken long to convert the ballroom into a suitable location.
sheets, of all colors) and looking around wildly. The room was quite large and furnished comfortable, although all the furniture, the decorations and
The soft glow of the early morning sun shone on all the gold bricks and outlines of the square, reflecting broken beams of golden light that made it look even more ethereal than usual.
Harry snorted. Of course, she asked about his advisors before she even thought of wondering how he was. Then again, she was a sucker for a good love story, so he shouldn’t have really surprised. It wasn’t as if he ever asked about her, anyways.
“Take care Father!” Draco yelled as his father ran outside and mounted his horse and attached a cart to its backside. His father simply waved at him as he galloped away.
“Any time from now would be good. I have a tight schedule, Potter.” He doesn’t even call Harry by his first name. Fucking hell.
“Because the Earth Roamers do not deserve to live. They have destroyed their planet and are making plans to destroy other planets as well. I’m part of a mission to eliminate the human race and reclaim Earth to nurture it back into health. For a long time, I thought that all humans were worthless.
. She needed some serious fashion advice, and the only person she would ever listen to about that sort of thing was him, anyways. He was sure that she had left ages ago; she had stopped waiting for him decades ago when she realized that it wasn’t worth it. Well, that was what
“Draco? Draco!” Draco snapped out of his thoughts when he realized that Granger was talking to him. She had a concerned expression on her face.
Draco waved his hand and magicked his quill to start writing down the order on his logging journal. “How many of each?”
Thankfully, the gold-paved streets were mostly empty since it was still quite early. There were some stragglers, most likely a few minor deities trying to get to marketplace early enough.
you.” Without registering what he was doing, he kissed Harry’s cheek out of sheer gratitude. Before any of them could react, Draco was already out of the door and running away at full speed.
“I’m sorry Father. I can’t let you stay here.” Draco replied. The beast nodded in satisfaction. It walked up to the bars and yanked them open. He dragged his father out by his collar and tossed him out.
“Move back.” Draco says. He fishes around in his pockets until he gets the car buttons. He presses one, and the doors of the Ferrari start to raise up and outwards, like a butterfly’s wings. Harry looks like he’s about to melt into a puddle of amazement. Draco gets into the driver’s seat, and ushers Harry in. Harry, still dazed, enters into the passenger seat.
“Hey. Wanna team up?” Draco looked up from the Rubik’s Cube he was trying to solve to see Harry Potter standing there, looking  slightly sheepish.
Like the day after Draco had been healed enough to stand up, it had explained what it had used to restrain Greyback.
“This looks nice.” Draco smiled, looking at himself in the standing mirror. The fabric felt wonderful against his skin, for he was used to wearing simple cotton and wool shirts.
“But… I can teach you, dear. I can make you feel better than you’ve ever felt before, and you won’t regret it. Besides, don’t you want to do it with me?”
To say the least, Draco did not have any sort of good relationship with any of the field spirits. Or the forest nymphs. Or the water fairies. The list went on and on. They all complained that he was too ‘arrogant’ and ‘selfish’ to relate with them well. How was it his fault that they were all too stupid to understand what he was teaching them? Not everybody had the patience of Hestia, especially not him. That was one (and most likely the only) thing he and his mother had in common.
Draco gasped loudly. Harry grinned and went on to place small, teasing licks onto Draco’s lovely little hole. It was small, pink and
However, instead of going there, the beast led Draco into another room beside it. This room was also a dining room, albeit a smaller one. The table was not as long as the first one, and it was bare.
He slowly pushed his tongue into Draco’s tight hole, holding Draco tightly enough not to allow any movement. He licked at his clenching walls and savored the choked breaths coming from above. Draco tasted clean and sweaty and musky and heavy on his tongue, and Harry
“Hello. Enjoying yourself?” Draco jumped and turned around. Behind him was a tall, handsome man. He has black hair and kind green eyes. He looked around Draco’s age.
** were at guard. Although they were sisters, it was easy to tell them apart. Thallo’s chocolate brown hair was in a neat bun, and she wore a dress made of rainbow beams and flower petals. Auxo’s curly, auburn hair was interwoven with borrowed bits of sunlight and pieces of the summertime sky into two neat braids. Carpo was the most serious looking of the three, and she was the only one who was holding her spear properly. Her simple, but beautiful tunic was covered by her chestnut-brown peplos.
“Oh no, I don’t think I can sign anyone else’s arse.” Harry laughs. The audience groans a bit, but Harry ignores them. “Well, maybe, if the owner of the arse is up to it, I’m up for renewing the link. Maybe they could DM me with proof?”
Harry was like a fire. He was destructive and hotheaded and passionate and simply unable to be contained.
Draco frowned as Harry led him into the empty ballroom. It was dusty, and it was illuminated only by some flickering candles in the chandelier above.
“Thank you, Harry.” Draco sighed, feeling full and content. He leaned back into Harry’s broad chest and smiled as Harry kissed his temple.
“Such a little slut.” Before Draco could react, he landed two more sharp spanks onto the round swell of his arse. Draco whined and gasped as more hand prints formed on his arse.
He sighed and shook his head lightly. He came here to escape from everything, not to brood. Besides, it was daybreak was just in a few hours and he would have to leave before his mother discovered that he was missing.
The thought of his parents brings back the usual ache in his heart, but now it's just a dull throb. They had died in a car accident when he was one. For the next twelve years of his life, he had lived with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. They were rather nasty, especially Dudley, their obese, spoilt son. However, once he turned thirteen, he was handed over to his godfather, Sirius Black. Well, more like Sirius gathered a shitload of lawyers and demanded for Harry’s custody. He smiles softly at the memory. Those had been the best years of his life.
The sight of Draco looking so debauched sent Harry over the edge, and he thrust deep into the blond as he came.
As the judges read out the significant deeds she had performed, Harry found himself closing his eyes and dreaming about something… or

under the soft light of the sun, creating an ethereal halo that Harry wanted to tear into shreds and keep entirely to himself. His pale, delicate skin called out,
Cho didn’t really recall them from the space ship, but then again she didn’t recall anybody, really.
. He raised up the skirt and spanked it hard, relishing in Draco’s loud whimpers. After a moment, it blossomed into a soft pink color, showing the outline of his hand clearly.
“Harry, they’re attacking us! We can’t hold our own for long!” Hermione cried, shaking him as hard as she could with her tiny arms.
Twenty minutes later, he arrived there. He sent Dobby away with a wave and an extra tip (Father never paid him much). He took a deep breath and stepped into the Starbucks. It wasn’t that crowded, but he couldn’t spot TheGoldenSnitch (calling him that in real life was weird; his real name was Harry but Draco wasn’t used to saying that) anywhere. He shrugged and went up to the cashier to order his coffee instead. As usual, he got a Mocha Cookie Crumble Frappuchino and two chocolate chip cookies. It was the best kind of coffee in existence; whoever had come up with the idea to mix an Oreo milkshake with chocolate and espresso was a pure genius.
Draco finished chewing his salad before he responded. “It was, well…” he trailed off, trying to find an exact word for it. “Strange.”
Once they arrived at his room, he hastily made to run inside. Before he could, the beast lifted up his small hand and
“I’m Ron. You’ll probably see lots of my family here.” The tall boy shrugged, a half-smile on his lips.
there were any, but he rarely kept up with news from the mortal anymore, aside from the occasional demigod and/or hero that killed hundreds of monsters and saved innocents and automatically had a place saved for them in Elysium. Harry snorted. If Zeus could actually keep it in his pants for once, he would eat his cap of invisibility.
He crossed his legs and leaned back on his arms, not missing the way Harry’s cock jumped in his joggers. Draco smirked. Harry was probably too proud to admit that he was hard.
“I’m coming I’m coming I’m coming.” Draco cried. He clenched around Harry’s cock as he came violently against his pale chest, making Harry hiss.
“Fuck, you’re so tight, love,” Harry grunted, pulling Draco’s hips even closer to his crotch. Draco simply grabbed helplessly onto the sweaty bedsheets, unable to even hold back any sounds at all.
Draco is already arranging (cramming, actually) his hair care products on the tiny sink in their shared bathroom when Harry walks in on him. He gapes at the sink.
“Well, I just wanted to,” Harry said. He sounded amused. “Well, I’ll be off now, Draco! See you on Friday!”
As he drove home, something told him that even after the collabs, he and Draco would still have something special between them.
"Rampage." Harry replies, still staring at the TV screen. From what Draco can make out, there seems to be an extremely buff baldy and a giant gorilla.
He grimaced as the creaking sounds in the next room (he refused to acknowledge the moans and grunts that were growing in volume) started getting faster. And louder.
He ignored the screams and shrieks of the townspeople as he sped through the cobbled pavement. They could go die for all he cared. He urged the horse to go faster, and soon arrived at the mouth of the sinister forest,
“Hello friends!” Draco smiled as he waved at his phone camera. He squinted his eyes to read the comments on the live stream which were coming in the thousands.
“You know Doc, you’re really easy on the eyes,” Potter grinned, licking his lips shamelessly. Draco was taken aback by the compliment.
“I can’t believe you asked them to play this.” He smiled as they started to step in time with the song. It had taken several lessons, but Draco was now proficient in ballroom dancing. Well, slow dancing at least.
“Hello, beautiful.” The man crooned. His voice was deep and sent shivers down Draco’s spine. His teeth were a bright yellow that made him cringe. Somehow, this man’s aura was even more terrifying than that of the beast’s, and that was saying
,” he muttered. He opened his eyes, temporarily blinded by the sharp colors in his eyes. When his vision finally cleared, he noticed something in the corner of the tiny room, in front of the toilet. A tall glass vase with two roses in it. Almost exactly like the one he had gotten in his office that day.
Harry, after a lot of effort, managed to call a truce with his parents. He didn’t forgive them, but he was willing to hear them out. And honestly, that was enough.
Hermione was beside herself, and couldn’t even form a full sentence. She was automatically removed from the suspect list, although Draco wondered if she even cared at all.
Harry stood up quicker than lightening, and before Draco could process it, he felt a cold mouth press against his and-
“When the Prince was 17, his parents were murdered by an assassin sent to kill them from the neighboring kingdom, Slytherin. As young as he was, the Prince set out to kill the King of Slytherin, Tom Riddle, which he did, even at his young age. He spared the people, although, and allowed them to run away to Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff kingdoms.”
“You’re probably not from around here, then. It’s a normal thing around this area.” To Draco’s surprise, he shrugged his jacket off and handed it to him.
He stood up and stretched his slightly cramped muscles, groaning softly when his blood rushed unto his stiff muscles. His chiton was a bit wrinkled, but with a snap of his fingers it straightened itself out and artfully positioned the folded strip of silk back onto his shoulder. He braided his hair again, wore his crown and laced up his sandals. He was back to being Kouroi again. Not Draco.
” Harry groaned. Of course, she just had to bring the time when he had needed her help to try and make Ron and Hermione fall in love with each other (it was merely for the benefit of the Underworld as a whole – their combined intellect would make Harry even better off than he already was - and
“Oh!” Draco gasped. Harry growled and gripped Draco’s thighs tightly as he plunged his tongue into Draco’s arsehole, enjoying the clean, musky taste of it. Draco whined and squirmed, and kept on letting out these little gasps that drove Harry
Instead of answering, Harry kissed him. The kiss wasn’t hot and needy; it was soft and tentative and
Draco was about to file out his paperwork when he noticed a small vase on his desk. It was white and narrow, and in it was a single red rose.
they gawk at him? Him, the Lord of the Underworld? He could easily crush all of their souls with a simple command, and he could make their lives miserable with just a snap. They were in no position to act as if they were on his level.
Apparently, the ‘coronavirus’ was more serious than they anticipated. It took less than a year and a half to wipe them out completely.
“Wait! Ok wait, I’m sorry,” she said sheepishly. “I- I’m just trying to look out for you because Harry Potter is- “
Draco huffed angrily and yanked his hand from Harry’s grasp. “Fine.” He got up and stomped out of the office, slamming the door behind him. Harry winced and sighed as he rubbed his temples. Great. Now he would have to spend another five hours pampering Draco to make him happy again. Not that he minded much, but Draco was rather hard to coax when he was in a mood.
Draco grabbed his phone and went over to his wardrobe to pick out several spray painting cans. Then he ran outside to the front lawn of Malfoy Manor where several albino peacocks were preening in the sunlight.
She smiled and led him through the large hallways at a slow pace, allowing him to look around and gape shamelessly at the prisoners stuck behind their clear, fortified barriers. Some of them ignored the two of them outright, while others pulled faces at them and even muttered angrily about them. It was quite fascinating, and Draco found himself even more interested in his internship than he already was.
Hey guys. I'm sorry this took so long to write, but I've just been so busy and stressed this week and I could only write bits and pieces :(
They marched and marched until Cedric spotted the castle turrets poking through the tops of the trees.
Then Potter looked up at him, meeting his gaze head on. All Draco could think of was how his eyes really were the same shade of green of his hair. He had never believed whenever anyone had said so, passing it off as ‘sentimental garbage.’ Turns out he was wrong.
He purposely ignored the logical part of his brain that said the beast has saved him, and therefore cared about him, even if it was just a little.
“Blaise is alright. A bit of a prick, but he’s cool.” Ron shrugged. Harry noticed that Ron and Hermione kept on stealing glances at each other, blushing when they were caught. A slow grin formed on his face.
Hermione paused for a moment, licking her lips. “At first, he was just curious about the whole place, you know. And I don’t blame him–Azkaban Asylum is a very infamous place. I would be interested in it too.”
!” He screamed, kicking and biting and fighting as wildly as he could. The stranger’s grip didn’t loosen, and in fact the arm wrapped itself around his waist and held him firmly.
She did, but Draco wasn’t about to tell her that and ruin her surprisingly good mood. “Of course not, mother.”
The man chuckled and started to approach Draco, who scrambled back as much as he could with his broken ankle.
He pushed Draco onto the desk and cast a quick wandless spell that bound the blond’s hands with a silk tie. Draco whined and wriggled around a bit.
As Cedric left (not before sending a sly smirk to Potter), Potter scowled at his retreating back before turning back to Draco.
To his immense annoyance, Malfoy tsked lazily and twirled a long pink strand of his hair. A rather garish shade of pink if you had to ask Rufus.
He slowly disentangled himself from Harry, trying to keep the heavy blush off his face. He didn’t dare look up at Harry’s face.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco rasped, his voice hoarse. It was their third round of the night, and he hoped that Harry was finally drained.
To his relief, he heard a muffled voice coming from upstairs. Draco rushed up the stairs, taking them two at a time.
was some shade between black and even darker black. The only other color he could see was some shade of dark maroon, which did nothing to make him feel better.
“Harry, what are you doing?” Draco asked slowly, not wanting to provoke Harry. Even though he wasn’t scared for some reason, he still wanted to be careful.
He sped through the hedges as fast as he could, the adrenaline coursing through his veins. He ran and ran, not even stopping once he reached the forest.
Draco nodded and keened as Harry moved his mouth even lower and took one of the pink buds between his lips.
“Well, get over here then. Come talk about it.” Harry smiled. Draco sat on the bed with a huff and crossed his legs. Harry took his hand and started to put on a base coat of nail polish. Draco knew that he had skipped several steps in the manicure process but he refrained from pointing them out.
Harry started to vibrate his fingers against Draco’s prostate rapidly, stimulating his cock and sending large dribbles of precum onto the carpeted floor. Harry knew from Draco’s ragged breaths that he was close to coming. With that thought in mind, he applied even more pressure.
So, I'm going on a temporary hiatus because I have lots of exams coming up, and I need to study really well :(
Harry was going to have to be more careful around her now. He knew just what she was capable of; it was why he had chosen her as his advisor in the first place. Her sharp wit and intellect even surpassed those of some lesser gods’.
Once he opens it, he immediately gasps out loud. Embarrassingly, his cock starts to harden in his boxers, but he ignores it because
“I shall see you again, Harry Potter.” He blows a small kiss to Harry before leaving the room in a confident gait.
He must have taken too long to respond, because Harry flushes and says “It’s okay if you don’t want to. I mean, we’ve only just met…”
“Father’s in trouble. I need to go find him. I’ll ask Mr. Dumbledore to stay with you for the time being.”
As he turned, he saw Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys, and Neville watching them at the door, all of them smiling happily at the scene.
Lucius Malfoy sighed to sadly himself as he rode back to his house. It had been a false alarm; there was no cargo. It had been another man’s ship. He wondered how he would tell his family. He was so lost in thought that he took a right instead of a left, and soon found himself lost in the dark forest. The moon was blocked out by the clouds, so only little light filtered through the trees to guide him.
Soon, he heard a click and the door creaked open slowly. Draco excitedly thanked whatever gods were out there and slipped through the open door. As he expected, the building was empty, save the noises coming from the other prisoners of this place. He shivered and ran to the exit and peeked outside.
Lucius grunted as twisted the little piece of metal in the lock of the door. It had been two weeks since he had been dragged away to the mental asylum and he had had
Draco silently wiped his forehead with his handkerchief. He prayed silently that Cedric would soon get the hint, however unlikely that was.
“Be patient, love.” He could feel Harry smirk against his skin as he sucked love bites into Draco’s chest.
Some few stadia ahead of him, there was a god sitting among some flowers. Surely, it was a god, for no
“There are Wrackspurts around your head.” The girl called Luna said. Her voice was serene and oddly entrancing.
With a deep breath, Harry got up and sprinted out of the room, barely hearing Ron and Hermione cheer after him.
“Since you’re new to this place and all, I could give you a tour of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade.” His voice was deeper and quieter than it was before; it sent shivers down Draco’s spine.
The best part was that it was the mirror that had led him to the beast. The handy little thing had conjured a map for him that led him straight to the palace.
. Away from his overbearing mother, away from Hera’s scrutinizing glares, away from Apollo’s stupid flirting and his leers,
He eyed the sparse trees distastefully. Really, there was nothing here worth coming to see! Why in heavens did he even bother in-
“Try this!” A coat on a hanger zipped towards him. It was a deep red color with golden linings on the cuffs. Before he could take it off the hanger, Pansy muttered “No… clashes with his skin tone,” and pushed forward a different suit. This one was a royal purple jacket, complete with a cream-colored shirt and purple trousers.
“Hello?” He asked. It had been three weeks since he had met Cormac, and the prick hadn’t even bothered to call him
“Lemon drop?” Mr. Dumbledore offered. Draco chuckled and picked one from the little bag on the desk to put in his mouth.
“So, you guys,” He started conversationally, flopping onto his bed and holding his phone above him. “Have you seen this tiktoker called theGoldenSnitch? Like, he’s
When they were in the cafe, wrapped up in blankets and admiring the view, it was all Harry could do to not pounce on him. The way the sunset's glow contoured his sharp face was ethereal.
Draco nodded and continued to eat his lunch, grateful for the change of subject. But as Granger continued to rant, Draco found himself thinking about what she had told him. How was he acting different? As far as he was concerned, absolutely nothing had changed about him. Well, maybe one thing…
“That’s wonderful, dear.” His father smiled as he stirred the porridge he was simmering on the stove. “Your mother is in the bedroom.”
Harry didn’t miss the use of his own words being thrown back at him. He clenched his jaw and counted to three in his head, before he said something that he would regret later on.
let me come,” he pleaded, thrashing back and forth against the wooden desk and arching his back. Harry didn’t bother to reprimand him for talking again; he knew that Draco was already on the edge.
Harry scrolled through the videos his personal TikTok page, trying to decide what to do next. His videos usually got millions of likes and tens of thousands of comments, but he tried to reply to as many as possible.
“I’m the teapot.” She said helpfully. Draco turned to look at her and saw that she had eyes and a mouth carved in, just like Pansy. Then, he realized that everything on the cart, even the cart itself, had eyes and a mouth.
Mrs. Weasley proceeded to introduce him to everyone. Ginny was the chipped teacup, Hermione was the feather duster, Ronald was the candelabra, Fred and George were the saucepans, Crookshanks the cat was the throw pillow, Mr. Weasley was the clock, and much more people that Draco tried to remember.
Harry grinned. “That can wait. Right now, the only thing I want to do is edge you until can’t even think straight.”
“My classes are alright.” Ron said, spraying food bits everywhere. Hermione smacked the back of his head.
“Let’s have a vote. All in favor of ejecting Hannah, raise your hand.” Theo said, breaking up the argument.
not because Harry was tired of seeing them pine hopelessly for each other). That was centuries ago! Of course she just
“Anyway, dear, what should we do with him?” Potter asked, twirling the dark purple gun in his gloved hands. Malfoy pouted and suddenly leaned on Potter, who caught him and rolled his eyes fondly.
.” Harry hissed. He got up and stretched his cramped knees quickly, before gripping his stiff, dripping cock and guiding it to Draco’s stretched hole. He pushed in slowly, making both of them moan loudly.
He secured it behind his ear and moved on to the next flower. A dove-white aster. Its myriad of petals were slightly curved inwards, giving it a rounded shape. He gently touched the pointed tips and pushed them even closer to the center as he looked up into the night sky. Astraea’s legacy would live on forever.* He knew immediately where she was; his mother had taught him how to stargaze when he was still young. The
of deities who all lived there at least some of the time, if not always. Draco knew of some gods who only came to Olympus to visit others, or to trade goods. He often wished he could be one of them.
He wasn’t exactly bad looking. He had been incredibly handsome as a prince, and if one looked well they would still be able to see it. It was just these… these
“Are you sure?” Draco crooned softly. His hands started to slide lower, but Harry promptly grabbed his hand and put an end his subtle teasing.
Harry smiled softly and walked away from Narcissa Malfoy’s dead body to Draco, shaking his head when the blond tried to scoot away from him. The protective bubble he was in was very strong, and wouldn’t even break to the toughest of spells.
In a corner, surrounded by a protective charm to repel the heat of the flames, was Draco Malfoy. The blond was bound with dark red ropes that clashed magnificently with his pale skin, and was gagged. For some reason, the muggle way of abduction and murder was
Harry shifted so that he was on his hands and knees above Draco. He lowered his head and kissed Draco, this time with more passion. Draco gasped as he tickled the roof of his mouth with his tongue.
On the way back, he decided to stop at the local library to cheer himself up. Even though he had read all the books there at least three times (it was rather small since people in this godforsaken place didn’t enjoy academic sorts of entertainment) Draco still frequented the establishment.
“I, uh, thank you. Draco,” Harry says hurriedly. He faintly realizes that Draco’s French accent is glaringly obvious, especially when he speaks English. For some reason, it makes him sweat even more.
Also, I know I'm switching tenses between chapters but honestly I'm too lazy to fix them. This story is mainly for experimenting so I'm not really concerned about things like that.
That night, Draco had packed his things while Harry was sleeping and left, most likely to Malfoy Manor to stay with his mother.
“Calm down boy.” Draco crooned gently, attempting to calm it down. Soon, it stopped bucking but was still neighing worriedly.
“No, I can assure my fans that I am definitely not a reptile working for the CIA, thank you very much.”
"Potter." Harry turns and sees Draco in a fluffy blue bathrobe, his hair wrapped in a towel. The most ridiculous part is the lime green face mask on him. Harry almost snorts.
Ten seconds later (or ten minutes, Draco couldn’t tell) Harry let up, smiling when he saw the string of saliva that connected their lips together.
“Father!” He screamed, urging the voice to where the voice had come from. Soon, he got to a clearing and gasped.
Draco knew that he looked just as, if not more ridiculous than Harry. His own hair was in pigtails, and he had a charcoal face mask on. He had just taken the cucumber slices off of his eyes a few minutes ago.
Draco couldn’t have anticipated what happened next. One moment, he was smelling some flowers, and the next the ground had split open and literally spilled out heat and molten rocks from the depths of the Underworld.
“Alright, alright. How are your roommates?” They were all sharing rooms with people, although in different places.
“What do you want?” Harry asked, cutting straight to the case. He wasn’t in the mood to talk do anybody at the moment, especially not his meddling brother.
.” She said proudly. “You should go inside, though. We can practice in the afternoon before we go to Aphrodite’s party.”
Midnight came far too soon, and they all got up to leave. Before they did, Cormac pecked Draco’s cheek and slipped a piece of paper into his hands.
Draco had literally run away from his parents to join a circus when he was sixteen, three years prior to now. Even though he was rich and well off, his parents had more or less forced him to get a job or be kicked out. There was no room for mercy in a cold world. And Malfoys were notoriously ruthless, even to their own kind. The loss of their only son wouldn’t mean much to them; they could always find somebody else to take his place in a heartbeat.
“Feel better, mate?” Ron asked, playfully knocking the side of Harry’s temple once with a candlestick. Despite himself, Harry smiled.
“I’m adding another finger, love.” When Draco nodded, Harry slipped his middle finger in with the first one. He crooked his fingers, searching for-
He ran a hand through his hair and floated out of his room, humming idly. He went all the way through the large palace until he reached the grand front entrance. The sun was almost out of sight, and he could already see the moon starting to rise in the sky. He held back a groan. Apollo was definitely going to be at the party, then. While Draco admittedly
He pushed in another finger, still up to the same knuckle. Draco’s hole stretched easily around him, just like it always did.
.”* He snarled at a nymph that was approaching where he was standing, and she squealed as she ran away back to her group. Her friends chattered nervously around her and scattered like mice when Harry bared his teeth at them. Foolish creatures. He was about to look around for more
“Draco, I have to warn you that these are hard-core criminals and nothing else. They’d eat you alive if they had the chance. And as a doctor you must…”
Draco, who was originally frozen in shock, screamed and ran to Harry’s side, managing to pull Harry back to rest his head in his lap.
When her voice was out of hearing range, Minos asked, “My Lord, I am curious, but did you inflict something upon this woman, because your magic seemed to be ineffective on her?”
“By the way, I used the lotion you recommended!” And with that, Potter left the shop in a happy little strut.
“What’s your excuse this time?” He sneered. Cormac shifted nervously, and tugged at the hair on his neck. Then, Draco got a sneak peek of his neck when his collar shifted. Were those-
“Hello.” Draco smiled as he sat down next to him on the booth in the middle. Harry sat next to him on his right side, opposite Hermione.
“Hm?” He hummed, dipping his reed pen into the ink pot next to him to sign the document with a small flourish. Just like the hundreds of other ones he had done that day.
He's about to switch off his phone when he gets a notification from his message inbox. He scowls. Hasn’t he turned off all his message notifications already?
Draco knew that he couldn’t follow them inside, and sat outside of the hospital on the stone floor, panting and finally resting his strained muscles.
This is the absolutely lovely fanart that Fae made for this fic!!! I hope you guys love it as much as I do!
“I don’t need one.” Harry growled, slamming his fist on the dining table and standing up, ignoring the way his chair fell over.
He held the phone up to his face and smirked. “Don’t worry about their feathers; it’ll wash out easily.”
He looked up into the vast night sky and started to trace out the constellations again. Cancer, Aquila, Apus, Pisces…
“Hey guys. What’s up?” He smiled as they sat down in front of him. As usual, Hermione had a textbook in front of her and Ron was stuffing his face with food.
Harry was merely taking a stroll when it happened. It was a pleasantly cool day, and the sun peeked behind the large clouds just enough to cast a warm glow onto the planet below. The tree nymphs danced and swayed to the gentle tunes of the satyrs, the flowers were all in full bloom and even the animals were bathing in the dim sunlight.
“I must go and collect it now.” His father said hurriedly, pulling on his cloak and his boots in a rush.
Hopefully, they would be handsome too. If he was going to get fucked, he would at least prefer someone hot. But old and rich worked out too. As long as he got the cash.
“But after some time, he started to act much weirder. He would get really defensive about Potter, and once he even told me that Potter was
. The wood table was covered in a white tablecloth, and had a small vase of short roses in the middle. It was already set for two, with gold embroidered plates and cutlery. There were candles all around the room and the lights were off, which left the room with a soft yellow glow. There were even rose petals on the floor and the table cloth, as well as a cart next to the table that was full of food.
“That’s nice. What do your parents do for a living?” Draco asked. Harry’s face tightened momentarily.
“I’ll go change in the bathroom. You can change here, alright?” Harry whispered into his ear. Draco blushed and nodded. As the bathroom door clicked shut, he walked up to the bed and sat on it, admiring the soft satin sheets.
He rummaged through his pack and brought out a tea cloth he had packed with him. He managed to snap off a nearby twig from the tree and had soon fashioned himself a makeshift splint. It was very crude, but there was nothing else Draco could use for the time being. With a groan, he pulled his foot out of the roots, wincing as the movement shot spikes of pain down his leg.
A harsh tug on his shoulder yanked him out of his thoughts. He looked down at Hermione, who’s brown skin had turned a sickly pale color.
“Of course you do. You’re such a little slut, aren’t you?” He punctuated the sentences with a hard spank that made Draco choke out a soft scream.
Harry smiled softly and turned to focus his gaze on Draco’s round arse that was half-covered by the skirt. It was plump and perfectly shaped and
The use of the formal title didn’t escape Harry’s notice. He watched closely as she walked out of the throne room with a careful glint in her rusted copper eyes.
After letting Harry open and close the doors with the button at least three times, they set out for the cafe. Harry directs Draco to the place. It’s a small building with a few people outside of it. Once they see the car, they start staring and pointing at it. Draco grips the steering wheel tightly as he parks. When the doors open, they start to shout and squeal.
“Sorry,” they both mumbled. Draco sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. He would never understand these people.
“After the war, the Prince became a delinquent from his grief and became very selfish and arrogant. His behaviors were noticed by a sorceress, who cursed him and all of the people in his castle. Nobody knows what the curse was, but none of the people who were in that castle during the ball have been seen since that day. That was three years ago. Since then, strange sounds have been rumored to come out from the palace at night, and some claim to have spotted figures moving in the window, but none of these have been confirmed.”
As usual, the two of them were on the news. Their latest heist was to shut down the power of half of the city (Draco only took part in Harry’s less violent crimes. Harry minded little anyway). However, it seemed as if there was a special feature because Draco noticed that Hermione was sitting across from the reporter. And it looked as if they were interviewing her.
couldn’t hide his shock at the sight of his darling Kore staring at him with a murderous expression on his face. He was wearing nothing but a flowy white robe that the servants had probably changed him into.
“Didn’t I tell you to be quiet?” As punishment, Harry reached up and tweaked Draco’s nipples with more force than he usually did, using his nails to dig into the sensitive skin. Draco groaned loudly and arched into the touch. The darkened skin around his nipples turned beautifully red.
He hoisted his father up and helped him limp over to and climb onto the horse. With a kick to its behind, the horse started to gallop off into the night.
“Well, be careful.” She walked away from him with the ominous warning, leaving him in front of the small door that was guarded by at least ten different security guards. The room was hidden deep inside the asylum. All the walls were made with thick, soundproof metal.
After showing his ID to them and swiping his card into the small device next to the door, Draco found himself sitting across from Potter, who was lying on a velvet chaise lounge (Draco snorted at that. Terribly cliche). His arms and legs were bound by some sort of thick metal restraints that made Draco feel slightly safer.
“Brilliant. The humans have started to experience effects of the virus we introduced into their ecosystem. In less than a year, they should be eliminated.”
Wherever he stepped, the grass withered away, the trees cowered away from his dark aura. Even the animals knew better than to get in his way. The ground became a dying wasteland beneath his feet and all around him, but that wasn’t his concern. Demeter could easily fix that, anyways.
As he looks into the mirror, he inspects himself. His untidy raven hair, his green sparkling eyes, his tanned skin. He sighs, and runs a hand through his messy hair. He hopefully checks the door again.
He felt Harry smile into his hair. “Neither can I.” As Harry leaned in to suck his neck softly, Draco let out an appreciative sigh and ran his fingers through Harry’s messy hair.
She rolled her eyes and put down her spoon into her bowl of tomato soup. “Are you ever going to get to the point?”
*In case you didn't know, Zeus raped Demeter, who later gave birth to Persephone (or in this case, Draco)
He pushed the door open and ran out of the hallway, stopping only to grab a sword hanging on the wall, and out of the doors to the small stable it had. He grabbed the nearest horse and swung onto it. With a slap to its rump, it was off into the town.
“Such a unique name. Much more interesting than mine, to be frank.” Potter let out a small laugh at that, and Draco gulped. Here he was, having a polite conversation with an arsonist, mass murder, and so many other charges that Draco couldn’t even remember. It was quite surreal.
“Mother!” Draco whined, quickening his pace so he could match her speed. “Why are we leaving? It’s not over yet!”
“Thank you.” The beast said. Draco sighed as he heard the clops of its hooves become fainter and fainter.
Draco sighed as he peeled off his face mask. Harry was just so handsome! The fact that he could cook made him even sexier.
“Father!” Draco yelled, galloping through the forest at top speed on the horse he had hastily taken from the stables.
He did stop, however, when the toe of his boots got caught in some thick tree roots that stuck up from the ground, making him fall over. He groaned. He tried to free his ankle from the roots, but not only was it stuck but it also sent sharp spikes of pain up his leg.
“Hush, okay? I want to do it.” Harry started gently rubbing the cream onto his hole, patting it with the soft cloth. When he pushed his finger inside, Draco clenched his teeth. He slowly twisted it around, making sure that the cream touched all the tears.
!” Harry yelled; he thrust deep into Draco’s arse as he came, shooting his load deep inside of Draco. Draco let out a high pitched scream, but somehow still managed to hold himself together.
of food. There were freshly baked croissants, fruit juice, eggs cooked in a variety of different ways, jams, fresh fruits and cream, cured meats, sliced cheeses, freshly baked wheat bread, porridge, and so much more.
Slowly, over the course of the next few minutes, Harry pushed in the rest of the two fingers until they were fully embedded in Draco’s arse. He curled his fingers upwards in search of that special spot.
“Oh. Thank you, Mr. Potter, but I’m afraid we have to stick to the standard protocol for our procedures.”
He could see his parents waving at him. He looked behind him, but nobody was there. He turned back to the mirror, trembling. He could still see his parents. They were dressed in fine silks, and Draco’s mother looked as healthy as she did before she was sick.
“Harry, you’re going to be fine. Just take deep breaths, deep breaths-” Draco choked out, the tears already running down his face.
Soon, the shouts of the city police force filled the air, and Rufus sighed in temporary relief. Temporary, however, because Potter was loading his revolver and pointing it carelessly at Rufus’ head. His gloved finger rested loosely on the trigger.
“I’ll take that as a yes, hm?” Without further ado, the man (Draco… Malgoy? Malfroy? Well, his name certainly didn’t matter anymore, as far as Harry was concerned) shoves a permanent marker into his (quite shaky) hands and
The heavenly smell of the ambrosia cakes made Draco’s mouth water, and before he could stop himself he stuffed one into his mouth. He nearly groaned out loud; the sweet taste of ambrosia and the soft bit of nectar were simply
“I’m sorry Mother,” Draco said regretfully. He ignored her pleas as he ran out the door. He mounted the horse quickly and galloped away. He stopped at the library to leave a note for Mr. Dumbledore; there wasn’t any time to chat. Once he was done, he let the horse gallop away.
area, but his name is rather short. It usually takes him a few seconds to write it on a normal day, but as the end of a long minute approaches, Harry knows that he’s dragging it out. Why? Well, he doesn’t know the answer to that.
His perception of Potter. It had been several weeks since he had started working with Potter, and even he had to admit that Potter was…
Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. After taking a few seconds to calm himself by inhaling the smoky scent of the Underworld, he firmed his resolve and opened his eyes to finish the letter.
A fraction of a second later, he re-appeared just on the outside of Mount Olympus, and in front of the Gate of Clouds. As usual, all three
It had been a few hours since he and his mother had gotten home, and he was bored out of his mind. His mother had retired to her bedroom the minute they arrived, leaving Draco all by himself. He had tried sleeping but gave up after an hour. Where was Hypnos when you needed him?
“Where could he be?” He thought. His mother was worried. Very worried, which made her even sicker than she already was.
.” Draco gaped. Even the air was pure, and Draco wondered how he had lived with the stale Earth air for twenty-four years of his life.
When Harry’s eyes flickered open, it was already daytime. The sun was shining bright in the middle of the sky, and-

), so he summoned a cool breeze from his fingertips to quickly cool down the mask and make it harden. Once it was set, he gently scratched off a small part, before peeling the entire mask off. It hurt a bit, but beauty was pain, after all.
features that marred his image. The horns, claws, even his height had been affected. When he was human, he was just a little over six feet, not as tall as
, and not sleep around like his own father did. As far as Draco was concerned, nobody had met his requirements, so he was not taking anybody. Besides, it wasn’t as if his mother would just send him off to anybody, anyways. She was even more adamant about him remaining a virgin that
He silently cursed the witch and himself too. He had been very foolish when he was younger; he couldn’t afford it now.
“Good morning Kouroi! What would you like today?” Phillina, one of Draco’s few nymph friends, was behind the stand. Draco smiled and walked up to her.
He almost missed the small, folded piece of paper lying on his desk, just a few inches away from the vase, until he brushed up against it as he made to put the flower aside. He unfolded it, not knowing what to expect. Maybe it was a welcome note?
“You lied,” she whispered. Draco bit his lip and said nothing. She gasped and covered her mouth with a shaky hand.
Draco blanched. “Please let him go. He didn’t have anywhere to stay. Please.” He begged, clutching his father’s hand while looking up at the beast pleadingly. It seemed to consider Draco’s offer.
Harry couldn’t even breathe. He could only watch as the man cupped his hands and allowed a pure-white butterfly to land gently on his milky-white palms. The butterfly nuzzled into the man’s soft strokes against its spine, waving its antennae happily. The man laughed softly, his tinkling, melodic voice losing itself in the breeze and drifting all the way to Harry’s listening ears.
He frowned and picked it up. Was this some sort of gift? Maybe Hermione had gotten one for him. He made a mental note to thank her the next day. Perhaps she wasn’t so bad after all.
“What exactly did he do to you?” Potter’s voice was much deeper than usual, which Rufus curse silently and subtly attempt to shift away from the two of them, Where the
“If that’s all, then I might as well take my leave,” Draco sighed, putting the note back into his pocket. “Mr. Potter, please try to remain in your cell at all times or I will have to report you to the security personnel.”
He vaguely heard the other door opening, but another wave of retching instantly took his mind away from that.
. His face was blotchy and wet from his tears, his wrists and hands red from the ties, his chest was flushed, and his cock was quivering and red and
a monster. He had spent several sleepless nights pondering about it, and each time he came up with nothing. He didn’t deny that Potter hadn’t committed crimes or anything, but he definitely wasn’t the stereotypical supervillain he had expected to see.
Soon, Harry picked up the pace and started pounding Draco into the mattress with a blinding speed that made Draco’s eyes roll into the back of his head.
The next time Potter came around, Draco already had a customer around. Cedric Diggory, who was a vampire, was in dire need of something to help cure his tooth aches.
Swallowing his fear, Draco walked up to it and slid his arm into the crook of its arm. The arm was solid and muscular, compared to Draco’s slim one.
Cormac slipped a sly arm around his waist. Draco blushed, but he didn’t push away. He spent the rest of the evening resting his head on Cormac’s shoulder, enjoying his scent and oblivious to Harry’s predicament.
“Nice to meet you, roomie.” Harry smiles. Despite himself, Draco feels a small smile rest upon his face.
The beast smiled again at him. Draco smiled back softly, before remembering who it was and sneered instead.
know that you’re going to see him several times a week, right?” Granger asked, her voice tinged with concern.
He left his crown behind, and didn’t bother to fix his hair or his chiton either. When he got to the flowers, he took a moment to merely admire them before bending down to pluck some.
Draco allowed Harry to wipe his tears away and clean his snot with the blanket. With Harry rubbing his back and whispering sweet nothings in his ear, he fell asleep into a surprisingly tranquil slumber.
“Why in the world are you arguing? Look, I’m free on both days, so the both of you can ask me whatever you wanted to. Before you start acting like
“Ginny! Stop leaning over the edge! You’ll fall out!” A motherly voice shouted. Draco almost leaped out of his seat in shock, before remembering that they were alive.
“A Compilation of Greek Playlets and Tragedies: Volume I.” Draco’s heart lurched. He had only read a few of the Greek playwrights, and while he loved them, there weren’t many in the local library to read.
Draco shivered involuntarily. “But talking about it will help you overcome it. And accept yourself.”
“Come for me, love,” Harry said roughly and swallowed around Draco’s cock again. Draco moaned loudly as he came in Harry’s mouth, whimpering as Harry swallowed his come and licked the head of his cock relentlessly.
Lucius cautiously made his way to the table. The food was still hot, and the smell of it made him moan in delight and anticipation.
He dragged Draco outside by his arm. However, as Draco walked out, he could have sworn that he saw a sharp flash of green in his side vision. When he turned to look at it properly, it was gone.
where the Horcrux had been on his body, and how it had blackened the part of his body where it had resided.
was a very rich man). Draco had insisted on cooking the normal way, although it was hard, considering the different kinds of plants and animals here compared to Earth.
“No, you aren’t injured.” The wardrobe huffed. Draco noticed that it had a distinctly feminine voice.
As he breathed in the chemical air, he sighed. Ever since trees had gone nearly into extinction, people had found other ways of sustaining the atmosphere and climate change. Now, the air everybody breathed was made in labs before being pumped out into the world. The icebergs had been restored, the ozone layer had been fixed and even greenhouse gases had been converted into eco-friendly fuel.
“Thank you.” He sighed, a wide smile on his lips. It felt nice to know that people actually cared for his wellbeing.
“Where am I?” He wondered for a moment. Then, the events of the previous day came rushing back to him. He jumped out of the bed and scrambled away from it. Who had put him there?
It had been a month since they had arrived, and they were staying in Harry’s tree mansion (apparently,
It didn’t happen often, but sometimes Harry got into an unpredictable rage. Draco couldn’t blame him; it was only a result of his past trauma. He was careful, but he wasn’t scared of Harry hurting him. Harry had slapped him once, but he immediately snapped out of his rage and begged Draco to forgive him for the entire night until he had cried himself to sleep in Draco’s lap. But that was only once, and Harry had promised not to again. And Draco believed him.
, you feel so good around me, love,” he growled, spanking Draco’s pink arse again. Draco keened loudly, and Harry was sure that there were tears in his eyes.
, Draco was happy. He had Harry, and he admitted that he was actually in love. Suddenly, the prospect of a future alone seemed so sad.
To his surprise, Potter pouted and walked up to the clear barrier. Draco knew that the glass could endure thousands of tons of brute force, and there was no logical way that Potter could break it, but he still took another small step back.
.” Harry moaned. Draco pulled back and swirled his tongue around the head before plunging back, sucking it and humming around it.
He somehow found himself walking towards the cell, with Granger trailing after him, still spewing occasional warnings that Draco paid no attention to. Draco had only ever seen him on TV or in newspapers, and he would not pass up the chance to look at him in real life because of Granger’s big mouth.
It was an hour before they were meant to meet, and he was recording a live stream to ask for help with his outfit advice and his gay panic.
to find the one that was right for him (that is, if they even existed). All he wanted was someone who would love him for who he was, not because he was just a beautiful virgin. He wanted someone who would actually be
He looked at his smartwatch (despite how old it was, Draco still loved it; it was the only remnant of his childhood left) and checked the coordinates for the meet up.
Lucius found himself trudging slowly towards the castle. He didn’t believe the rumors at all and was not scared easily. Besides, if he stayed out any longer, he would surely get mauled or eaten up by feral wolves.
“Hey.” Draco jumped up in his seat, dropping his phone onto the table. Standing in front of him was TheGoldenSnitch himself. He was even sexier in real life. He was wearing a fitted black tee, a black leather jacket and faded ripped jeans with white Vans. His black hair was tousled perfectly, and his bright green eyes shone behind rose gold wire frames. His cheekbones could literally cut through butter.
“I wish to see my father.” When the image formed, he gasped. His father was lying on the floor of the forest ground. His leg and side were clearly mauled, and he wasn’t moving.
“I’d rather not. Potter.” Draco replies. He's made it a habit to call people by their surnames. It's just how he is. Harry chuckles.
“Love you.” Harry leaned down for a kiss and grinned when Draco gave him a short, chaste peck on the lips before turning back to his vegetables.
“Take him away,” he muttered, already flipping to the next piece of parchment in front of him. There was an unusually large stack today, although there weren’t any wars going on. Well, Harry didn’t
The twelve astronauts descended from the space ship onto the base station on Planet Polus. It seemed that two of them, the blond in white and the brunette in red already knew each other, judging by the way they were tangled up with each other.
Tbh this is turning out to be more like a collection of inter-related (is that a word?) drabbles than an actual storyline lol
“Father!” He yelled, seeing his father in a tiny cell, separated from him by a grid of iron bars. His father was very disheveled.
Draco Malfoy is drowning into those pools of liquid emerald. The boy’s eyes are extremely captivating. With extreme effort, Draco pulls himself free from their grasp.
“Look, I just had a lot of things to do. I’m really sorry.” Draco sighed. As much as he was annoyed, Cormac
“I’m alright. Just unprepared for the temperature drop.” Draco admitted sheepishly. The man smiled at him.
The man watched as the butterfly flew into the sky with a peaceful, yet wonderous expression on his face. His hands fell gracefully to his sides, adjusting the flowing white chiton he was wearing. Even more of his satiny skin was revealed, making Harry take a step closer to him..
He opened his closet and pulled out a netted softsilver shirt and tight platinum jeans that made his arse look fat. As he pulled them on, he wondered if it was an old patron, or someone new. Hopefully someone new, because they tended to pay him more than he was meant to get, so he kept the spare change.
under the multicolored lights coming from above. His long hair wasn’t in any braids this time, and his loose blonde locks framed his face like a gold picture frame. His lips were rouged, his skin was smooth and supple, and his lovely, shaped calves were wrapped in his white sandals. He was
Harry looked at himself in the mirror, contemplating the recent events. Over the course of three weeks, Draco had started slowly warming up to him and the palace residents, although he still had his fits sometimes. Now, he had daily conversations with Hermione and had become good friends with Neville as well. He was even willing to talk to Harry sometimes, which Harry counted as progress.
“Draco.” Bot 1 said. “You have been booked for tonight. Get ready to leave in thirty minutes. The rest of you, listen up.”
“You’re really something else.” Harry smiled softly; Draco didn’t know why his heart clenched at the sight.
He pushed his finger in further, just up to the first knuckle. Draco’s hole felt wonderful around his finger, and he nearly groaned aloud when he imagined the sensation against his cock.
When he finally arrived at the mansion, he sat at the front door step and breathed in the fresh air. His legs were aching a bit, and-
“You’re alright, love. Just relax.” Harry soothed, massaging his back steadily. Soon, Draco fell into a peaceful slumber, clutching Harry’s shirt tightly.
He walked as briskly as he could until he got back to his office. He locked the door, before sliding down to the floor and holding his head in his hands.
Harry’s breath suddenly became rapid and ragged, and he couldn’t help but imagine what lay underneath his darling’s beautiful outfit. Harry wanted to drag him away, rip off his clothes and
“Once upon a time, there was a King James and Queen Lily of Gryffindoria. They gave birth to Prince Harry about a year before you yourself were born, lad.”
“Yes.” Draco moaned. Harry started thrusting directly onto his sweet spot, making Draco arch so much Harry’s cock almost slipped out of him.
The next weekend, Draco was sullen and sore. His last client from yesterday had more or less taken him dry, and he was still bleeding from the treatment. He couldn’t stand the thought of telling the ManagerBots that he had anal fissures, so he kept quiet.
“Unfortunately, I don’t have much time today. I was wondering if you could just read me a short story today.”
“Kouroi!” Before he knew it, a tan arm slipped around his waist and dragged him into an empty space, away from the main room where everybody was dancing and grinding on each other. He was quickly, but gently, backed against a wall.
Less than two minutes later, Draco’s backside was bared to Harry’s view. He could feel himself blush as he minutely shifted his knees.
Draco ran inside to tell his mother the good news, and together they both hoped for a new beginning.
“Your welcome.” He said, snatching his hand away and darting back into his room before the beast could do anything

Harry sighed and put down his quill on the desk that was currently littered with paperwork. They were all the documents from his last Auror cases.
“Harry?” Harry turned his neck to see Ron hop his way into his room, with Hermione and Crookshanks trailing behind him.
By now, Draco had stopped struggling and had resorted to pleading Harry with his beautiful silver eyes, from which the most innocent tears were spilling out of. The picture the blond created was purely
“Nice to meet you! I’m Hermione Granger!” The lady was quite energetic but seemed nice enough, so Draco took her outstretched hand and shook it.
When Draco found the nearest lavatory, he immediately went in and locked himself inside. He leaned against the door, taking a moment to catch his breath. And to
“I don’t know what happened, Harry. Maybe you should listen to Hermione and see a Mind-Healer.” Draco said after a beat of silence.
“Father!” He yelled. There was another staircase leading to another floor. As he kept on going higher, he kept on getting closer to his father.
At first, he had only felt curiosity about Potter and his situation. He was merely interested in the way his mind worked and nothing else. But now… now, Draco was becoming increasingly invested in Potter. Scratch that, he was
He slowly fucked Draco just up to that knuckle, making Draco sob in desperation. Harry smirked. This was what he wanted, so this was what he would get.
And then, as if the Fates were watching (and surely planning something cruel for him), the memories of the day before came rushing into his mind.
Draco was confused. It had been a week since the beast had apologized, and ever since then, it had been acting… strange. It was friendly and surprisingly charming for such a brute creature.
“Harry!” He turned his head to see Ron and Hermione rushing towards him. He smiled. They were his best friends, and he hadn’t really gotten the chance to talk to them with all the stress of moving into his apartment.
Draco sat down on the fluffy bed, marveling at the downy fabric. Back in the circus, he only had an old model of a technobed, but this one was probably the latest. The temperature and texture of the sheets changed fluidly beneath his fingertips as he stroked them absently.
When they finally approached his cell, Harry Potter was leaning against a wall with his hands in his pockets, and it looked like he was whistling. He looked strangely relaxed for someone who was stuck in a mental asylum.
Harry knew that there was only one way he could convince Draco to love him unconditionally, even if it meant resorting to the worst measures.
sick, and so far nothing had managed to cure her ailment. She was getting worse every day, and his father was beside himself with grief.
Harry’s jaw tightened before suddenly relaxing. “Don’t worry about that, dear. I’ll take care of that.”
“Well, he-” A large blast suddenly filled the air, making Rufus jump in his seat (and let out a girlish scream, but nobody had to know that). However, Potter and Malfoy remained still, as if they had been expecting it.
Draco gasped when Harry’s grip around his waist tightened until his nails were digging into Draco’s sensitive skin.
He looked around, and something caught his eye. There was a castle turret sticking up from the top of the trees. Draco made his way towards it. A few minutes later, he gasped. There was a gigantic palace right before his eyes. It had a massive garden in front of it, complete with dried up water fountains and overgrown hedges. Draco cautiously made his way towards the front door of the palace. It was gigantic, and it took all of his strength to open just one of them. Inside was a large dining room, with other rooms to the side of it and a grand staircase leading to the second floor.
Later that evening, Draco left their flat with Harry to go to the pub where everybody was meant to meet up.
After a few more tense seconds, Harry finally finishes with a flourish and drops the marker onto the floor. He doesn’t even realize he’s sweating until a large drop of the salty liquid drips into his eye.
The next day, Draco had suggested that Harry go out with his parents in order to reconcile with them.
Harry leaned forward and shoved all of the papers on his desk onto the floor, not even thinking twice about it. He could always sort them out later, and his only priority now was to fuck his husband senseless.
Draco sneered and used his most convincing tone yet. “And if you ever paid attention to when I was talking, you would have known that I have a
He stood up and stretched his arms out. If he was attending any party, then he had to find something presentable to wear. It wasn’t every day the Lord of the Underworld came out of his realm, and if he absolutely
“You need to be subtle about it.” Draco said, handing Harry the file to do his own nails. It had taken a little while to teach him, but Harry was now moderately proficient at nail care.
Draco smiled to himself as he filed Harry’s nails. Draco had finally convinced him to have a spa day where they just relaxed and gossiped. So far, it was doing them a world of good.
He sighed deeply and conjured a makeshift throne for him to sit on. It wasn’t nearly as grand as the one back in the Underworld, but it would have to do. It was still beautiful, as it was made of threads of inky darkness, shiny obsidian and little flecks of molten lava. It glowed ominously in the dark.
