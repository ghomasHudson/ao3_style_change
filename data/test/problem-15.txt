The boys spent the next twenty minutes or so sorting through Hadrian's trunk; the clothes were all tossed to the side with spare scraps of parchment, old school assignments, stale candy and other trash to be picked up by the house elves when they were done. All of Hadrian's old schoolbooks as well as the handful of other books he had received over the years went on his bookshelf, as did the few personal items he had-the miniature Hungarian Horntail from the Tri-wizard Tournament, the sneak-a-scope Ron gave him in third year, the photo album of his parents-rather his cousins, since Lily was his real mom's cousin-and a few other items that he had received for Christmas over the past few years. His invisibility cloak-would he have to give that to Ginny?-and the Marauder's Map (which he was not giving up, no matter what anyone said) he placed in a hidden cabinet by his bed that would only open to his magical signature. At the very bottom of the trunk Hadrian found the penknife and the mirror that Sirius had given him the previous year; the mirror was shattered from Hadrian throwing it angrily into his trunk, but Draco assured him it could be fixed. Once the trunk was empty of everything valuable Hadrian banished all the rubbish on the bottom, and Draco summoned a house elf to get rid of the clothes and such, and then Hadrian picked up the box and followed Draco to his room, where they both sat in the window seat once again.
After studying for a few hours, Harry abruptly stood up and walked into the kitchen.  Draco watched as Harry came back in with a bottle and two glasses.
“Oh cool it, will you Blaise?”  Pansy stared at him as if he were a child pulling at her pigtails.  He shrunk back into himself slightly.
“Oh!  Right!”  He chuckled and nodded again.  “Um, the Weasleys adopted him over the summer.  He just kinda, er, showed up one night.”
believe you!”
"I won't hold it against you." Harry laughed, leaning his head against Draco's.
The house is cold and it seeps deep into my bones as I enter my room. All sense of personalisation has been removed. All that remains in the dark furniture set and grey walls. I locked the door behind me and let out a long breath. I sat on the bed, the world slowly spinning around me. I noticed a new watch on my bedside table.
"Fifteen pounds."  Harry handed over the money while Draco suspiciously eyed the shop.
“Draco,” My father greeted stiffly. My mother smiled, laying a hand on my cheek. “Narcissa? Let’s go.” My father held out his arm. We both took it, making sure I had a good hold on my trunk, and we apparated home to the front hall of our home.
“We attacked each other at the same time!”  Harry shouted.
“You called me an absolute buffoon.”  He started laughing.  I stared at him.
“Do you want to go further?” Harry asked, leaning his head against Draco’s and wrapping his arms around his waist.  “We don’t have—”
“Your aunt and uncle made you live in a cupboard under the stairs?”
The rest of the day went by unceremoniously, Transfiguration following Care of Magical Creatures.  Pansy decided we should eat early before our Prefect rounds that night.  The Great Hall was fairly empty right after class, allowing Pansy and I to talk almost freely.
“Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay.”  The crowd began to grow restless.  Pansy let out a few long, heavy sighs and Crabbe and Goyle began chatting quietly.  “There again, progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation, because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment. Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness, and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited.”  As she sat again, Dumbledore began clapping, followed by the rest of the staff table and a few random students.  I followed suit if only to maintain a precedent set by Prefect status.
"What do you mean?" Draco's cheeks heated up as Harry smirked.
“Only half full?” Draco smirked.  Harry rolled his eyes.
"Hey, that's okay."  Draco's gaze shot up to Harry's face.  He wasn't sure what he was expecting — surprise, maybe even for him to jump back or leave.  "Really.  Look, I'm bisexual."  Harry laughed.
"Mmm, will you stay?"  He murmured.  Draco paused.
The rest of the week they continued as normal but plagued by a tense air between them.  They both knew they had felt something the other night but neither could find the words to describe it, let alone discuss it.  They exchanged a few more moments — hands brushing in the passing of a mug or book, eyes catching for a moment too long, blushes rising on their cheeks.  But, by Friday, Harry had enough of the tension and wanted things to go back to normal.
“Tell him?” She asked softly.
"Yeah, I couldn't stay around the wizarding world after the war. It all drove me insane."
“What— was— that?” He asked between breaths.
"Thanks."  Harry nodded.  They stood there for a moment, silence filling the space between them.
"Well, what if I'm particularly sweaty after training one night?"  Harry countered.
"Shit, I'm sorry.  It was just a nightmare.  I built up those instincts when we were horcrux hunting.  Are you alright?"  Harry got out of bed.
"What?" Draco pulled back. He didn't even expect to talk to Harry, let alone kiss him and now—
"You're closer," Harry laughed lightly, nodding towards the record player.
“Shh, calm down!  It’s not that big a deal Pansy!”  I whispered, starting to hear voices outside.
There was a spot near the edge of the woods that, if walked through properly, would lead to a pond deep in the forest.  I would, of course, ask her for the exact details, but she would be suspicious of something, and my actions would be watched much more carefully.  Wasn’t there a rhyme she would say?  I walked down to the edge and stared at the tree line.
"That's fair."  Harry took a long drink and smiled. "I'm glad it has."
“No, no I’m fine,” He laughed and hugged me.  I sighed and held him tightly.
“I’m… sorry.  I’m sorry for what they did to you and how normal it is for you.  I’m sorry that you grew up without love.  And… and I’m sorry that I was horrible to you these past few years.  I’m… I’m just sorry,” I blurted out.  I could feel Harry’s eyes on me.
“You know you’re the only one I love like that,” He said, pushing off my chest slightly to look at me.
"Mittens?  Really?"  Harry laughed as Draco attached the tag to the collar.
“We’ve got Care of Magical Creatures now.  Come on.”  She took my hand and we joined the boys on the walk down.
“Oh, yes sir,” She replied calmly with a respectful smile.
“What?”  I nearly yelled.
Draco ran his delicate hands up Harry’s warm, broad chest, sighing again at the peace settling in his stomach.  They’d only been together for just over a month, finally getting together after months of meeting for drinks after work and oblivious flirting.  The first ‘date’ went as well as anyone could have predicted — both men were incredibly awkward through the dinner until Harry kissed Draco on his doorstep.  From then on, they were almost never apart.  They spent nearly every night together as Harry introduced Draco to muggle movies.  Tonight, Harry had chosen Stars Wars but got distracted halfway through by how absolutely stunning Draco looked in that new turtleneck of his.  He could hardly keep his hands off him throughout the film and wasted no time when the end credits finally rolled.
"Two tropical VKs too, please," Harry yelled back over the bar. Draco chuckled.
"I know what you mean. Pansy and I left after we finished our eighth year." The stood awkwardly together, oddly quiet among the overbearing crowd.
"Draco," Harry decided to whisper.  Draco inhaled deeply before slowly opening his eyes.  He wasn't sure what he was expecting — anger, surprise, fear, rejection — but what he met was what he could only describe as anxious curiosity.  Harry carefully slid his hand from Draco's shoulder, up his neck, to rest at the base of his jaw, afraid that if he moved too fast, he might startle Draco.  Draco remained frozen, relishing Harry's touch for what he was nearly sure would be the last time.  "Draco, I..."  Harry's train of thought left him completely when he glanced down to Draco's lips for a split second.
Wonderful.  Exciting news.  Likely some new artefact or powerful acquaintance.  Great.  I shoved the letter into my trunk.  I end up spending much of the afternoon trying to read the book Pansy gave me for my birthday but I’m unable to get past the first chapter as I can’t focus on the book.  I wanted so desperately to meet Harry but figured that he needed space right now and would let me know when he wanted to meet.
“What use is that?” Harry yelled.  “If we’re going to be attacked it won’t be in a —”
“I just…”
"Thought the last time that would happen was Potions class,"  Harry chuckled.
"Well, she's not entirely wrong, you know," Draco muttered before taking a long sip of his drink while Harry slapped his arm. "Hey!"
“Harry!”  Hermione warned.
“Yes,” said Hermione.  “Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?”
"Yes sir!"  Draco nodded before downing the water.
"Malfoy, it supposed to rain all night.  Just for tonight and I'll take him to a shelter tomorrow."  Harry pouted and held the kitten up to his face, who let out a quiet mew.  "Please?"  Draco huffed and threw up his arms.
“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless.
“That’s it!  This is all too complicated!  I’m not going.”  I flopped down on my bed next to her.
“It is my belief — and never have I so hoped that I am mistaken — that we are all facing dark and difficult times.  Some of you in this Hall have already suffered directly at the hands of Lord Voldemort.  Many of your families have been torn asunder.  A week ago, a student was taken from our midst.
"This song is for an old classmate,"  Harry laughed, thinking about the context.  Every time he announced the song, he felt a pang of guilt in his stomach.  He never talked to Draco after his trial, not even to check if he was okay.  He just walked away from the Ministry that night, and a few weeks later, from the whole of the wizarding world.  But he also didn't regret leaving.  Patronus was one of the best things to happen to him.
This became the new norm — once one of them moved to the other's couch, they would just stay there.  After helping each other, they'd shift back to opposite ends, Draco's arm draped over the back of the couch.  His long fingers almost brushed Harry's shoulder.  Harry was hyper-aware of this, always making him flush slightly.  Occasionally, Mittens would join them in the space between them, effectively distracting them from their work and usually leading to abandoned books and a very happy cat.
“He’s probably just tired and stressed.  Wouldn’t blame him,” Pansy whispered as he disappeared behind us.  I nodded as we walked back to the dungeons.
They spent a couple of hours at a few pubs getting properly pissed before going to a club.  Draco didn't mind clubs if Harry stayed close to him.  The club was packed when they got there, pressing them close together.  Harry ordered them multiple rounds of shots when they arrived, making sure if they weren't already drunk off their arses, they were now.  Draco felt almost all sense of elegance leave him as Harry pulled them to the dance floor.  They danced, joining other groups throughout the night, even stumbling outside with a couple of attractive guys for a smoke, until the music faded and they were forced to leave.  Stumbling home together, laughing and holding each other up, forgetting they could just apparate home, Harry sobered slightly in the cold London air.  Draco, the lightweight he was, stayed as drunk as he was when they left.
Draco knew that this time, Harry had definitely seen him. He saw the slight shock cover his face and his grip on the mic falter for a split second. Harry knew, but he didn't let on. There was nothing in his performance to suggest what he was thinking other than the brief moment of shock. He whipped around to sing the bridge, although sing might be generous for the way he roared into the microphone.
“Okay, well,”  She stared at me with her brow furrowed and eyes squinted.  “Get ready.  I’ll wait for you in the Common Room.”  I nodded as she left.  I quickly changed into my school robes and fixed my hair so it was no longer sticking up in the back.  I met Pansy and we walked quietly to the Great Hall.
“This is bullshit,” Pansy muttered, trying to get a bowtruckle to agree with her.  I laughed lightly and glanced over my shoulder.  Harry was talking quickly to Hermione, who looked much more focused on the classwork.  She sighed heavily before answering him.  I shifted to hear her better.  Pansy raised an eyebrow but let me move anyways, likely figuring it would be more interesting than the assignment.
Both men suffered from nightmares and would wake up in cold sweats during the nights.  Most of the time, they weren't bad enough to wake the other.  However, once in a while, one would have to shake the other awake to make sure they were alright.  Harry had the tendency to toss and turn and react quickly when he was woken up, which Draco learned one night when he heard a ruckus in Harry's room and went to check on him.  When he opened the door, he saw Harry thrashing around in his bed.
“Yes we are.”  I shrugged off my robes and tie and opted for a dark grey fitted jumper over my dress shirt.  Pansy followed suit, closely following me with her eyes.  My muscles still felt tense from the Defense class.  It felt like Umbridge’s voice managed to worm its way into my bones — a constant, squirming annoyance.
“Well,” He scoffed. I looked up. “They’ve set a trial date for him in front of the Wizengamot. It appears as though Dumbledore is attempting to bend the rules for him.” He shook his head, throwing the paper down on the side table before staring into the fire.
“Harry Potter?”  Dumbledore mumbled.  He looked up and glanced around.  The entire Great Hall turned and looked at Harry, who glanced around with wide eyes.
“It does make me happy.  It makes me incredibly happy!
Not long after, Harry bought himself a record player and began collecting vinyls.  His first album was a second-hand copy of Bob Seger's Greatest Hits.  Draco watched as Harry took the album out and inspected it for scratches before setting it down on the turntable and starting the music.
.  I walked out past the lake, looked towards the forest line and remembered something my mum used to tell me.
“Behave,” I muttered.  Pansy helps me for a few minutes hanging my clothes before we flop onto my bed and draw the curtains.
“No, no,” I laughed airly.  “I just saw you had a dog with you.  You never told me you have a dog.”  His brows rose slightly and nodded.
.  And I couldn’t say anything without risking everyone I love lives.  I swallowed thickly.  I could save Harry, but at what expense.  I could possibly save us all.  Dumbledore and the Hat’s words echoed in my head — ‘
“Alright, sure.  Why not?”  He leaned up and pressed a long kiss against my lips.  I pulled his hips closer, breathing deeply into the kiss.
“Alright, I was just wondering,” She muttered before turning back to her own breakfast.  I glance up towards the Gryffindor table.  Harry was happily talking with Hermione and Weasel over a mountain of breakfast food, comparing schedules.  He looked happy — bright smile, a mouthful of food, loud laughter.  I hoped that it was real, that it wasn’t just a facade.  That maybe, just maybe, the end of last year didn’t happen.  That Voldemort’s presence in my house was all just a fever dream.  That my father hadn’t inadvertently almost ruined our relationship.  That Harry and I could just be happy again.
“There is nothing waiting out there, Mr Potter.”
“I know.”  Harry stepped forward and pulled me into a gentle hug.  “I know.  I’ll be here for you.”  I buried my head into Harry’s shoulder.  “I love you Draco.  This doesn’t change anything.”  I nodded feebly into his shoulder.  We silently held each other until the sunset.  “We need to go back.”  Harry gently pulled away.  ”We both need to sleep.  We both need to eat.  Come on.”  He gently placed his hand on my cheek.  I leant into his touch, knowing it may well be the last time I see him for a few months.  He smiled softly, pressing a chaste kiss to my lips.  “Come on,” He whispered.
"What? He's hot, alright!"  So hot, Draco couldn't stop staring.  He hadn't seen Harry since his trial, and that was a very different man.  For the trials, Harry wore a smart grey suit, no doubt picked out by Hermione, with his hair still short and unruly but tamed with some SleakEazy.  He spoke professionally and respectfully, focusing on the defendants' actions and what they'd done for Harry rather than using his fame to pull strings.  Draco was grateful for that — the Ministry acknowledged him as an independent person now because of it.  He'd be the first to admit that Harry looked very nice during the trials — grownup, professional, a leader.  But the Harry Draco saw on stage was a completely different man.  He no longer held any sort of composure, jumping and dancing and thrusting to the music.  He was all over the stage, leaning into the audience, his long hair sticking to his face and shoulders.  When did he grow out his hair?  Draco wasn't complaining though — his hair now resembled that of a lion's mane, and all Draco could think about was running his hands through it.  Harry had also grown out of his boyish form into a well-built man.  Draco couldn't turn his focus from the way Harry clenched the microphone or threw his head back on a high note.  He wore beat-up trainers and ripped jeans and if he looked close enough, Draco was sure he saw eyeliner as well, holding none of the professionalism that he held a year ago.  Instead, Draco could see the rage Harry had pent up being poured out in his music.  He let himself go on the stage.
“Well, who would I be if I weren’t a bit of an arse.”  I kissed his forehead and he laughed lightly.
“Yes,” I started.  All three of their head’s shot up with varying levels of concern written across their faces.  Weasel looked ready to punch me, Hermione looked slightly baffled and Harry looked ready to smack me for my comments earlier.  I smirked even more.  “Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place.  So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away.”
“I didn’t think it’d get this far,”  I replied.  Really, I thought I would’ve cast obliviate and gone back to Pansy with a broken heart at this point.
“The… important stuff.  You’ll find out soon.  Like at the feast soon.”  She nodded and grabbed my hand.
“Hey, Potter!”  I yelled across the Great Hall.
.  He grasped around for his glasses next to him.
I’m not sure how long I stared at the ceiling before I fell asleep, or even if I did fall asleep.  I kept running through our conversation over and over again — the way he said he liked me, the sunset casting its orange glow over us, his smile, his laugh.  I couldn’t wait to see him again.  See him again alone.
“Hermione!”  Ron rushed forward to help her, dragging her hand away from her face to show her growing teeth.  This couldn’t have gone worse.
"I didn't even know if you were into blokes. I didn't want to ruin our relationship. Then we'd have to go to the Ministry and apply for new partners, and one of us would've had to move out. Merlin, imagine the custody battle over Mittens! It would be horrendous!" Harry exclaimed dramatically. Draco held back his laughter at Harry's theatrics.
"Yeah? Was there someone you made you realise it?"
“Ladies and gentlemen,” He began, his voice lacking it’s usual exciting lilt.  The crowd softened to a slight murmur.  “Would all students please quickly and quietly return to their respective dorms?  Hogwarts Head Boys and Girls please make sure everyone is accounted for.  Staff is asked to report to the Great Hall.  Thank you.”  The crowd silently began moving in sync back towards the castle.  Pansy intertwined our fingers, hanging her head as we walked back.  My breathing hadn’t quite recovered yet.  My head swam.
Arithmancy dragged by and finally, it was time to flesh out the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, Umbridge.
“Hey.”  Harry stopped pacing and turned to me with his brows furrowed and a forced smile.  His eyes were dark and his hair ratty.  His already too big clothes seemed to hang off his body more than normal.  He hadn’t been eating or sleeping.
"I was," Draco mumbled after taking a sip of his drink. Harry furrowed his brow. "I was an ass to you and your friends. To pretty much everyone, let's be honest." Draco stared down at the bar, swirling his drink. Harry cocked his head to the side, observing Draco.
“He…”  I knew somewhere deep in me that he was right.  I knew my father — he was a blood purist through and through.  He wasn’t under the Imperius Curse, despite how much he tried to convince everyone he was.  I always wished it was the truth.  Harry took a few careful steps back to me.
"I'm sure it'll still taste good,"  He comforted as Harry frantically looked for a way to improve the steak.  Draco looked over Harry's shoulder and Harry couldn't help but shiver at the tickle of Draco's breath on his neck.  "Besides,"  Draco muttered, pulling away and seeing the shivers,  "I've burnt plenty of food that you still ate."  Harry shook his head and chuckled.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked quickly.  Draco chuckled and pushed him slightly further back so that Harry was standing next to the bed.
“Positive.  Absolutely.  He did something with Wormtail’s Dark Mark and then he started just talking about his family and stuff.  Then a bunch of Death Eater’s came and he started a speech about loyalty and then he… he touched me.  My head.  The last time I confronted him, my touch burned him and killed him.  This time it did nothing.  He told the Death Eaters how he found Quirrel and then Wormtail and how it all led up to this point.  He t-tortured me.”  Harry’s voice broke slightly and a tear slipped out.  He rushed to wipe it away before continuing.
"You sure?"
"Bit of a tosser really," Draco mumbled. Harry pursed his lips before bursting out in laughter. "What? What did I say?" Draco leaned back. Harry shook his head, his body shaking with laughter.
"It looks like he's wearing little mittens!"
kept repeating, the pitiful screeches of Chang and the Diggory’s reverberating in my ears.  I couldn’t remember most of our walk back until I collapsed on my bed, Pansy next to me.  Blaise looked at us with a clenched jaw before drawing the curtains around his bed.  Pansy drew the curtains around us and cast a silencing charm before pulling my head into her lap.  I let out a shaky breath, feeling the tears welling in the back of my eyes.
“Is it…” He whispered, their heavy breaths mingling together in front of them.  They had plenty of heated make-outs during or after the movies, but were careful in touching each other, even if they were shirtless the night before.  Both had countless scars and insecurities and neither serious relationships before this.  Draco nodded and Harry’s hand slipped under the hem.  He ran his thumb along the soft skin just above Draco’s trousers before slipping his hand up to his waist.  Draco pulled him in again before slipping his own hands under the collar of Harry’s flannel and over the tatty old band shirt he wore underneath it.
“What?”  I took a step back.  It all still seemed just a bit too good to be true.  He stopped and looked away for a moment.
I just kept circling around a few corridors until I walked straight into someone else with their head down.  He fell backwards and his glass tumbled off his face, smashing next to him.  I stumbled backwards, tripping over my robes.
They appeared in front of a two-story townhouse on a Muggle street.
“To our newcomers,” said Dumbledore in a ringing voice, his arms stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lips.  “Welcome!  To our old hands — welcome back! There is a time for speech-making, but this is not it. Tuck in!”  A round of applause and a few whoops of laughter rang out as food appeared on the tables.  As the meal began, I stole a glance at the Gryffindor table.  Harry was beaming, tucking into a heap of food on his plate, looking as though it was the first time he had eaten in months — probably not too far from the truth.  Pansy started talking about her summer, a trip to France and Italy with her mum.  I nodded along, wishing I could tell her some interesting story from my summer.  Of course, I couldn’t tell her how joyous it was to have supper with the Dark Lord every evening, even if I wanted to.  Instead, I smiled, exclaiming at the important bits, and she hardly seemed to notice over her food.
"Morning,"  Harry mumbled with his gravelly morning voice.  Draco shoved the mug into his hands and turned around to hide his flushing face.
“No, I just—”  I kept looking for the words.
"I should have noticed, shouldn't I?" Draco groaned with a wide smile.
“Oh very funny,”  Granger said sarcastically to Pansy.  “Really witty.”
“Tell me, Potter,” said Snape softly, “can you read?”  I couldn’t help it anymore and I let out a small laugh.  Harry shot a glare my way.  I tried to give him an apologetic smile, but I ended up laughing again.
"You never noticed?" Harry chuckled, pulling back enough to look Draco in the eye.
“Hermione Granger.”
“Shit I’m sorry—”
“Except pointing out that she’s stupid and incompetent!” Harry huffed, crossing his arms.  He looked like a young child being told they couldn’t have a lolly.  I sighed.
“Seven oaks…”  I muttered, walking along the treeline.  “That does me a whole lot of good. What does an oak tree even look— oh.”  I stopped in front of an unusually large tree and looked into the forest.  Sure enough, six equally large trees followed it.  I looked back towards the castle.  The largest tree at the edge was just past the lake, just far enough to not attract attention.
“Your father was there,” He stated quickly.  My stomach dropped.  My father.  My breath became ragged and the world spun as I stared back at Harry.  I couldn’t decode the mess in his eyes — pity, guilt, fear, and resentment.
“Thank you, ma’am.”  I smiled at Pansy and wrapped my arm gently around her shoulders.
“Pansy, seriously, I love you but you have got to stop elbowing me there.  I’m gonna have a bruise,”  I scolded her, not bothering to look up.
"That's so basic!"
“You okay?” Harry mumbled.  Draco nodded and pecked Harry’s lips.
Draco sighed softly as Harry stroked his hair and let his eyes close.  Harry admired his features while soothing him — his nose was straight and sharp, turning up ever so slightly at the end; his eyes almond-shaped and framed by ashy brown lashes that nearly kissed his sharp cheekbones; Harry had never noticed the light freckles that formed constellations across his cheeks; his lips were soft pink and parted slightly, letting out soft breaths as Harry moved his hands through his soft hair.  Draco opened his eyes after a few minutes, gazing at Harry with soft grey eyes and his lips curling at the corners ever so slightly.
“You haven’t told me about your summer,” She commented.
“I’m with you.  Of course I’m okay,” Draco murmured back.  Harry chuckled and opened the door.  Harry led them over to his bed, gently sitting on the edge.  As their lips met again, Harry’s hands slipped up Draco’s shirt again.  He lightly ran his fingertips over Draco’s lithe frame, over his hips, then each rib.  Draco gasped softly at how delicate Harry’s calloused fingers felt against his warm skin.  Harry took the chance to pull away and tug the hem of Draco’s shirt.
“Prefect? Oh, wonderful Draco! Following in your father’s footsteps!” She pulled me into a hug and kissed my cheek.
“Thank you.”  He smiled slightly too.
“No.”  She raised her eyebrows with a slight smirk.  “Really?” My stomach flipped.
"Something like that." The rest of that weekend melted away in soft kisses and takeaway, the two men blissfully aware of each other, exploring the new relationship budding between them.
"Care to grab a drink?" Harry gestured to the bar where he assumed the boys were. "I'm meant to be meeting my bandmates." Butterflies erupted in Draco's stomach. He never imagined any of this in a million years — Harry Potter was inviting him to drink with his friends, entirely willingly, while looking like a rock star.
"I don't fucking care!"
"If you needed a place to stay," Harry stumbled over his words, eyes wide, hoping he didn't scare Draco. "I mean, of course, you don't have to—"
They paused again at the top of the stairs, Harry stepping up to look down at Draco.  Draco laughed before tilting his head up to kiss Harry’s jawline.  Harry groaned at the sweet teasing, feeling the heat rise up his neck to his cheeks.  He grabbed Draco’s hand again and pulled them to just in front of his room.
The words hung on the tip of my tongue, ready to be fired from my lips.
After a long, hot shower, a makeout against the wall and a gentle massage, they returned to Harry’s bed and collapsed.  Draco laid his head against Harry’s chest.  He ran his finger along Harry’s body as they dozed off.
“A light silver vapour should now be rising from your potion,” called Snape, with ten minutes left to go.  I looked at my own potion — perfect.  Pansy’s… a little less perfect.  More grey than silver, but very close.
I laughed along but had a pit sinking in my stomach.
“Very well.  Thank you, Lucius, for your work today.”  My father nodded curtly as Voldemort left the room.  We continued standing in unsettled silence until my mother returned to her spot on the sofa.  I tried to keep my mind off of my new knowledge of the Dementor attack, knowing Voldemort would likely be interested in my thoughts at this time.  I felt vicious pangs of guilt every time I agreed to Voldemort’s questions.
“—something to tell—”
Draco, like Harry, decided to get out of the limelight after he finished his eighth year.  He had to return to Hogwarts as a part of his post-war retribution.   However, as soon as they graduated, Draco and Pansy moved to a town an hour outside of Edinburgh.   Draco worked as a grocer, a relief from the constant attention from the media, and as a means to support himself after donating much of the Malfoy fortune after the war ended.  Pansy had convinced him to come to pride with her, saying he could maybe finally meet a nice guy, and even if he didn't, he could help her find a nice girl.  Once he had agreed, Pansy may have gone a little overboard.   She bought a semi-permanent hair dye to dye the gay flag on Draco's head; she bought him a large flag, small flag, t-shirt with the flag, rainbow suspenders, rainbow bracelets, as well an assortment of chokers and ear cuffs.
"After you, my dear,"  Draco smirked, causing Harry to roll his eyes again.
“So, what did you think of the movie?” Harry asked, nuzzling himself into Draco’s neck as the end credits rolled.  Draco hummed at Harry’s warm breath tickling just under his ear.
"What is it?"  He instinctively reached to his wand holster and Harry giggled softly.
"Aren't we going to Apparate?"  Harry turned and gave him an incredulous look.
"Uh, yeah! Sure!" Draco stammered, thanking Merlin the lights covered up his blushing cheeks. Harry grabbed his wrist and started manoeuvring them through the crowd. Both men made a silent pact to ignore the sparks exploding from Harry's grasp.
light grey plaid trousers with her shirt tucked in.
After I finished eating, I looked up just in time to see Harry leaving the Great Hall.  I quickly excused myself, saying I left some books in my room before chasing Harry down the hall.
"What are you doing?"  Harry asked, staring at him.  Draco looked up from his book and raise an eyebrow.
“Harry.”  I reached out and grabbed his arm.  He looked down at my hand then up at my face with a dark look in his eye before wrenching his arm away and stomping away again.  “Harry, wait!”  He disappeared through the vines.  “Fucking
“Draco,” He said softly, pulling away.  I swallowed the words as his face stiffened.  “There’s something else you should know about what happened out there.”  I nodded as Harry carefully untangled himself from my arms.  He stepped back, stood with his back arrow straight and took a deep breath before looking directly into my eyes.
"That? No, I figured that out a long time ago." Draco laughed.  Harry leaned against the bar and raised an eyebrow, smirking.
"You never cook,"  Harry chuckled and sipped from the mug.
“Alright.  I believe you, for now.”  I smiled.  A wave of relief washed over me.
“Yes,” I answer without hesitation. His grin grew as he whipped around and stalked to my father.
“Hey, I’m going for a walk.”  I stood up and placed my napkin next to my almost full plate of food.  “Don’t come looking for me,”  I said to Pansy as I kissed her head.
Draco swaggered over to Harry after reading his paper.
"Get used to it Malfoy.  Proper is just another word for no fun."  Draco shot Harry a look before taking a bite.
All too soon, it was the day before the last task and Harry and I were meeting in the warm June air, surrounded by wildflowers we didn’t know bloomed there.
Another argument broke out over what to eat for dinner.
Now months into their training, they both began coming across more complicated topics in their books.  Harry would groan every time a new difficult potion was brought up, causing Draco to look up and ask if he needed help.  Harry would deny it, but by Harry's third or fourth quiet, heavy sigh, he'd join the dark-haired man on his couch to talk through the potion with him.  Draco, on the other hand, asked for Harry's help when he came across difficult transfiguration or defensive spells, and Harry would join him on his couch.  Usually, they would return to their own couches, but one night Draco could not be bothered to move back, so he shifted to one end of the couch and lazily threw his arm over the top.
“Yes sir.  Dumbledore has proven to be an effective negotiator in the half-giant’s rights.  However, the Defense Against the Dark Arts position has been filled by a reliably ignorant source.”  Voldemort turned swiftly and moved towards the door.
"Yeah?" Harry inched closer too.
“I repeat, do you expect to be attacked during my classes?”
"No, dancing's good," He coughed. Harry laughed and held out his hand.
“We’re good, by the way,”  I mumbled when we broke for air.
"No!  Stop!  It's not— Argh!"  Harry dropped his wand and ran over to the bed, shaking Draco.
news to announce.” His voice sounded strained. “And as Dumbledore announced unceremoniously at your Leaving Feast, the Dark Lord has returned.” I straightened my back and inhaled sharply. “Despite claiming to be under the Imperius Curse during the first war, I remained a faithful follower of the Dark Lord since his rising. I was proud to return to his side at his return during the final task of the Triwizard Tournament. Not only have I returned to his side, our family,” My mother gently clasped my hand. “Will be hosting the Dark Lord for the foreseeable future.” A wave of nausea washed over me and my knees buckled. I did my best to maintain my composure as my father watched me. Slowly the door behind him creaked open.

“Hey Hadrian!” Bellatrix greeted. “You’re just in time!” Bella turned back to the rest of the class. A grumpy Hermione sat in the front row, along with Ginny Weasley, Ron Weasley, Seamus Finnegan, Terry Boot, Susan Bones, Daphne Greengrass, and several others he didn’t recognize.

“Yeah. Your father said it was alright for you to lead a raid as long as you stick your mask to your face with a parsel spell as a safety percussion. Wouldn’t do for the boy who lived to be discovered.” Harry cackled at her last comment. “Dumbledore would have to get a new savior. Who’s he going to ask? Neville?” Hadrian broke down in hysterics. Neville had been less than pleased to learn that his real parents were Barty Crouch Jr. and Regulus Black.

“Yup. Ronald here doesn’t approve of my boyfriend.” Hadrian said somewhat loudly out of spite to Ginny. Hadrian imagined that Bellatrix was beaming inside, but she managed to maintain a neutral outward appearance.
He prepared his Firebolt and himself for the ritual, and memorized the lines he needed to chant in Latin in order to make it work. He wrote a quick note:

“What do you think I’m doing? I’m eating lunch.” Draco replied snootily.
“Hey Hermione,” Hadrian said with a smile the next day as the trio made their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast the next morning. He imagined that the mudblood was feeling particularly murderous that morning. He laughed internally at the thought.
“20 points from Gryffindor for disrespect.” Hadrian snapped.
“Good job!” She said with a grin. “You, what did you say your name was?” Bella asked, pointing at Hermione. Bellatrix knew Hermione’s name of course, but why use it if ‘forgetting’ it would just rile the girl up?
They walked to the throne room where they would be officially initiated and marked. Due to the nature of their eliteness, only the inner circle would be there. Everyone was there when they arrived. They took their marks and there was a whoop of applause. Harry noticed Severus amongst the inner circle. Severus seemed surprised at their initiation. Of course a geas went over the room to ensure that none of them could speak of this occasion. Severus hadn’t recognized Harry, but that was likely because his hood was over his head. He seemed more shocked that Draco had made inner circle so quickly.

Brilliant! He thought. And seven was smart. It was a powerful number. What would he want to use for his objects? While he was pondering this question, Hermione and Ron approached him. “Hey mate, we haven’t talked much lately. We’ve missed you. What’s up.” Ron said, interrupting Hadrian’s line of thought. “Yeah. Hey what are you reading there?” Hermione asked, peeking over his shoulder.

“Anyone know what these mean?” Bella asked rhetorically, “They mean that you need to have purpose, intent, and willpower to be successful in silent casting. To have purpose means to act like you have a purpose. To be confident. To have intent is to have a motive. To want to do it. To envision the spell you are thinking, actually happening. To have willpower, is to have mental stamina. To be persistent, and headstrong.” Bella lectured. “Alright, now I’m going to have you work in pairs. Hadrian, Luna, Neville: You’ll walk around and assist anyone who looks like they need help.” Bella finished, and sat back and took out a pen to either grade papers or write a letter to the Dark Lord, aka her lover, aka Hadrian’s father. Based on the grin on her face, it was likely the latter.
“How do you know about the punctorum system?” Severus asked with a sneer. “Did Dumbledore tell you what I told him?
“Well, my parents are in Saint Mungos because of them, so I don’t like them at all.” Neville responded, defensively.
“Potter! 50 points from Gryffindor for disrespect to a professor.” Snaps snapped with a vicious, smug sneer.
“Thank you Professor Tallivex,” Hadrian replied, smothering the urge to call her his mother.
In a week, he’d be boarding the Hogwarts Express at Platform 9 ¾, so he could apologize on the train. What was the worst thing that could happen? He could get laughed at, but it seemed like it was worth the risk. In the meantime, he could think about what he could say.

Hadrian arrived ten minutes early for Hermione’s detention time, so he could chat with Bellatrix. His mother confirmed that Hadrian would have full control (assuming he didn’t crucio Hermione or something because in her own words: “As delightful as that would be for me to watch and you to do, we don’t want to be reported to the old goat who runs this school at the current moment). Then, Hadrian had a spark of inspiration. There’d been a spell in the Slytherin Grimoire that he’d found the prior week. It was Kivaro. It was pronounced as (key-VA-row), and acted like the cruciatus, except the pain was imagined, so it didn’t leave shaking or visible signs. If they put a geas on her, then.. “Kivaro!” he shouted in a flash of inspiration. “Brilliant, Hads,” his mother replied, in her nickname for him. “With a geas I assume?”, she asked, checking with Hadrian. “Exactly!”. “Alright then. But she does need to do something other than just that because otherwise, it’ll be suspicious.”
“My Hadrian,” she replied
“Ahh, well I’m sure it is just a slight misunderstanding.” Dumbledore replied, eyes twinkling furiously.
“The Dark Lord tried to kill me painlessly. Dumbledore left me at the Dursleys and made me go back for the first part of every summer. He claimed it was for a blood ward from my mother’s sacrifice which allegedly is what saved me, but it didn’t protect me from what I really needed protecting from: the Dursleys themselves.”
“Well, every year you have to re-tryout if there’s competition. So I won’t. If Oliver asks, I’ll simply tell him that I’m quitting. He can’t make me play.”
“Really?”, Draco asked.
“Yeah. You?” He replied.

Before Ron could say anything though, his mother had made her way over to the Gryffindor table. “Is there a problem here, Mr. Potter?” she asked kindly.
Hadrian mounted his broom, and kicked off into the air once he’d left the locker room. His Firebolt felt even more amazing now that it held a part of his soul. He smirked. Madam Hooch’s whistle blew, and he started flying around the court, searching for the snitch.
“Yeah, I was wondering that myself.” George continued
“Well duh. It’s not like we are here in this stupid after hours to do anything more productive.” Hermione replied snarkily.
Hadrian slipped into his mum’s DADA classroom. It was still so weird thinking of Bellatrix as his mum. He figured he’d get used to it with time though. “Hey.” Hadrian said, with a smile.
“Have you convinced father to let me go (if not lead) a raid this break?” he asked.

“Slytherin of course! You’re on the team still, so I’ll cheer for you, if Slytherin is playing, and if not, I’ll be in the library. Lot’s of Ravenclaws end up in the library during Quidditch games if Ravenclaw isn’t playing anyway.”

“Hello! Greetings class!” Bellatrix cooed. “I’m glad all twenty of you showed up just like I asked. Hadrian, Luna, Neville, I’m very pleased to have you here to help me today with.” she added. “You guys will be my mini-teachers. I’ll instruct, you’ll aid. I’m also invoking an old rule in the school charter. It’s called the aid-assist-lead rule. It states that a teacher who has students helping that teacher in helping other students, is acting as a Hogwarts staff member for the time being that they are in that specific teacher’s classroom. They are called tstaff. They get staff privileges while that is going on, including taking house points, giving house points, and giving detentions. For the detentions, they must give those under the supervision under a teacher of their choice, however. Hadrian, Luna, Neville; I, professor of DADA at Hogwarts, accept Hadrian, Luna, and Neville as tstaff, so mote be it.” his mother said, and her wand lit up.

They’d retrieve the prophecy at the DoM so they could break the prophecy's hold on the two dark lords while mayhem was caused at Hogsmeade. Bones would be taken out, and then they’d reconvene to take the Ministry. Lucius would become the Minister of Magic and various other DEs would get other positions in the Ministry. Then they would just have to take the school and deal with the Order of the Phoenix. This would be a big victory.
“Hadrian. You try.” His mother said. Hadrian was still warping his head around the fact Bellatrix was his mum and Voldemort - Marvolo - was his dad. It was mind-boggling at times. Hadrian stood up, and Hermione’s wand went flying into his outstretched hand, with a silent flick of his wand. Hermione huffed at his display. It was clear she did not like being outshone. Jealous prat.
Alright, I'm not confident about writing smut, so I have decided not to publish the scene between Harry and Draco at the end. I feel like my writing of smut (at least for now) is bad, but I hope you liked this chapter. It's a shorter one, but I'm posting two charters today, so I hope that's okay. :)
“What?!?!” Neville shouted. “Fred and George used the Imperious?”
Hagrid,
“Yeah. Okay, back to the four principles of the dark. Blood, freedom, next is children. The dark believes children are sacred. Children should never be abused and even in the case of the Dark Lord coming after you, Potter, he only would have used Avada Kedavra on you. It failed, but had it succeeded, it would have been instant and painless.”
“I’m positive.” Hadrian said, cutting Ron off mid-sentence.
On Saturday, Draco was waiting in the Room of Requirements for Harry. Saturday morning, Draco would help Harry with Potions and Saturday afternoon, Harry would teach Draco to understand Parseltongue. Sunday morning, Draco would help Harry with the Dark Lord, pureblood culture, the dark, and other wizarding customs. Sunday afternoon, they’d chat and catch up on homework.
“Great! See you in class! I have Binns first, so I’m off to nap-time. I swear, as soon as I learn how to exorcise ghosts, Binns is going to leave this plane of existence, and if Peeves doesn’t control himself, he’ll be next.”

“This is so unfair!” Hermione whined as they left class. “Don’t you agree Harry?” she asked, turning to Hadrian. Hadrian gave a neutral shrug, and walked off

“Really,” Draco questioned, looking up at Harry, “I thought you loved flying.”
“So what are you going to do about it now? Like how will you let them know you quit? I hear Oliver Wood is more fanatical about Quidditch than Flint, and he’s obsessed with the sport.”

“Agreed! But we get along now!” Harry said with a smile. Draco smiled back and they were silent for the rest of the ride to Hogwarts. Some other Slytherins joined them later, but when they questioned Draco on why Harry was in their compartment, Draco said that Harry was a decent person once you got past all the golden-boy hype, and to give him a chance this year. They were reluctant, but agreed nonetheless.
“That’s good. It sucked that it happened, but I suppose it’d be a bit suspicious if he let that go.” Ron said, oblivious to the anger Hermione was feeling as she spoke those lies. “But I’m still never gonna get detention again. I realized it wasn’t worth it as I was writing those lines.” she said. Oooh. That was all her. He didn’t force that as a part of the geas, only the nature of such. Seems like the punishment got through to her. Fear could do marvelous things.
“Ugh! Remember when I found out that I was the next dark lord because I could speak to snakes? When will my house EVER let me not be anyone but their alleged savior.”
Harry had been improving drastically. His spell repertoire increased as he was no longer bound by the constraints of light magic and he’d been better understanding manners and heirships. He’d be going to Gringotts over the spring break to claim those heirships and find out any parts of his family history he didn’t already know. He was in potions and Severus seemed displeased as ever. Harry was suspicious of Severus, but had no evidence against him yet, so he did not take action just yet. He would keep an eye on him though. Over Yule break, he’d been tutored in several subjects. The dark lord had composed a schedule for him:
“I never said such a repulsing thing. Do you sit in Ron’s lap at breakfast? Because I view you as a little sister who I don’t even know well or talk to much. Get off of my lap right now.”
Neville’s grandmother wouldn’t be happy with him, but she wouldn’t notice, because she didn’t notice a thing about Neville. Luna’s dad was the same way, so she’d have an easier time also.

Either way, all four were thrilled to be Elite Inner Circle members of the Dark Order. They were all grinning ear to ear for hours after their mark, and it took ten howlers from Molly Weasley for Fred and George Weasley to have their general good mood dampen. All of them had been for not telling her that they were going to “Lee’s house” over spring break. In reality, “Lee’s house” was really Riddle Manor, but had Molly known that, howlers would be the least of their concerns. They’d implanted false memories into Lee and his parents just to be safe --- so that if Molly checked --- the stories would match up.
I woke up in the morning to a letter being dropped into the bed.  I groaned as the envelope slapped me in the face before I flung out an arm and accidentally punched Pansy.
“I don’t think I can do that, but I can tell you some of the uses of moonstone.”  He laughed lightly into my chest.  I rubbed his back gently as he melted into me.  “Hey, you should get going soon.  It’s late and you’re exhausted.”
“That… that is all very true.”
"Stay?"  Draco murmured as Harry reached the door.  His face flushed as he vaguely remembered muttering something along the same lines to Draco a few weeks prior in his own drunken stupor.  He turned back around and sat on the bed.
“Look Draco!  They quoted you!” Goyle exclaimed, spitting bits of food across the table.  I mentally groaned, wondering why I ever became friends with the oaf.  I read down, and sure enough, my father had used something I said over the summer, tweaking the words a bit.
“I cannot stand Divination.  You know that.”  I rolled my eyes.  She bumped me with her shoulder.
“And they told us not to talk about it you dumbass!” Pansy defended me.  I squeezed her hand gently as a silent thank you.
“Want some help with those?”  I offered, pulling out my wand.  He grunted.
“Then maybe you could just be friends for a little while.”  She started pacing again.
“But then you could move on!”  She stopped in front of me again and grabbed my hands.  “Hun, you’ve been in love with this boy for at least a year, definitely attracted to him for more.  If you tell him, you have an answer either way.  And if he likes you back, then great!  You figure out how to move on!  Look,”  She made the most serious face she could.  “Just do it.  It’ll work out either way.”  I snatched my hands away and turned to look out of the alcove.  She had a point.  I should listen to her.
“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house,” Dumbledore continued.  I kept my eyes on Harry as Dumbledore spoke.  He now stared intently at his plate and I wanted to move next to him and comfort him.  Instead, Pansy took my hand under the table and ran her thumb across my knuckles.  “He was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play.  His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not.  I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.”  I took a sharp deep breath, hoping to Merlin that Harry was wrong and Dumbledore would say exactly that.  “Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort.”
“It’s getting dark, we should probably head back,”  Harry said after a few moments of silence.  I smiled and nodded.  The sun had just set behind the treeline, the sky now purple and the air much chillier than when we first came out.
But like snakes slitherin' in the dark,
“Better watch where you’re going.  Don’t want to run into someone again.”  I called after him.  He shrugged and shoved his hands in his pockets.
On the morning of Harry’s trial, I found myself in the drawing-room with my parents, once again trying helplessly to read another book. My mother had decided to join us that morning, disapproving of my father’s next trip to the Ministry. She had an amazing ability to communicate only through glances and pursed lips. This morning she spent sending glares his way. He ignored her, reading the paper instead.
“Are you complaining?” He asked, placing another kiss along Draco’s jawline.
“After this year, of course, many of you will cease studying with me,” Snape went on.  “I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class, which means that some of us will certainly be saying good-bye.” His eyes rested on a table in the back.  I glanced over my shoulder to see Harry glaring back.  I rolled my eyes and turned back to Snape.  “But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell, so whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my O.W.L. students.  Today we will be mixing a potion that often comes up at Ordinary Wizarding Level: the Draught of Peace, a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation.  Be warned: If you are too heavy-handed with the ingredients you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep, so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing.  The ingredients and method are on the blackboard.  You will find everything you need in the store cupboard.  You have an hour and a half. . . . Start.”
Harry thought for a moment. He could lie and say no, just to reassure Draco. But he didn’t want to lie. He didn’t want dishonesty in this relationship. Not after so many years of turmoil. “I am.”
Harry was laying in a seductive pose on Draco’s bed, propped up on one elbow. He was stark naked, save for a giant red ribbon. “Merry Christmas.”
The precocious child read the card. “It says he is your best friend was croo-shal to your defeat of Vol-Volde...”
Draco ran his hands through Harry’s hair. Harry  tentatively touched Draco’s back, gaining more confidence and running his hands over his shoulders and spine. Draco pulled back for air.
“I don’t remember much about that night,” Harry reminded them. It wasn’t his fault that Lavender had an open bar. He tried to remember seeing Malfoy but he couldn’t.
They stood by the door, neither making a move to open it. Harry’s eyes trailed down Draco’s face to his lips.
“Yes, but I can’t. I can’t miss a class without a note from Pomfrey.”
“All right. I’m not buying any more rounds. I only do that for good friends.” He rolled his eyes, but he couldn’t stay annoyed at them for long.
The next few weeks passed in a blur of stolen kisses, rushed handjobs, and interview requests. Harry took as many of the first two as he could and declined every interview. McGonagall informed them that Draco was receiving his fair share of hate mail, and they had intercepted several jinxed letters. Harry wouldn’t let Draco walk anywhere by himself unless he used the invisibility cloak. He was too worried after the events of Halloween. And Draco had to admit it was nice to be worried about. It was also nice walking everywhere with Harry.
Draco raised an eyebrow, and Harry knew he had failed at passing off his declaration of love. He changed plans. “I’m sorry. I was going to wait a while to tell you. I certainly wasn’t going to do it on our first date. And now I’ve gone and ruined this perfect evening and...”
“I haven’t Apparated on my own in over a year.”
“Oh, how was it?” Hermione asked.
It was Draco’s white-faced owl. Last night suddenly came flooding back to Harry, and he groaned again. At least Draco was alive this morning. He untied the letter from the owl’s leg and opened it. He blinked, trying to read it.
Draco smiled. “Yes. But Harry has an amazing ability to always see the best in everyone. An ability I wish I had.” Particularly right now, Draco thought. “We’ve talked about our pasts extensively. We were friends, and then we were boyfriends. And then we fell in love.”
“Would you, Draco? I would like it very much.”
That worked. He pumped some lotion on his hand and set to work. He flipped the pages with his free hand while he stroked himself. He stopped on a full-page spread of a platinum blond with a Chaser’s lean build. He imagined going down on his knees for him, what it would feel like to have a cock in his mouth. He rubbed and tugged, harder and faster, sucking an imaginary cock.
Kingsley waved his hand. “We are slow right now. Go ahead and leave. We won’t announce it before you’re ready. Everyone will just assume you’re on holiday.”
“After Hogwarts. We already live together in the dorm. I can’t stand the thought of not being with you every day after we graduate. Move in with me.”
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Did you finish your homework?”
“Is he one of the Governors now?”
“Oh, I think you do. Come on, just between friends.”
“Yes, thank you for pointing that out so bluntly.”
Draco’s face was unreadable, and though only a few moments of silence passed, Harry felt like it was an eternity. Finally, Draco spoked. Breathlessly, he whispered, “Well, we aren’t crying now.”
Kingsley smiled a bit and jotted it down. He was the only one who knew Harry’s actual residence. “Very good. And employment?”
“There’s plenty of time for that. Next time, the only toy I want is that thick cock of yours up my arse.” Draco ran a hand up Harry’s bare thigh.
“That’s all right. I feel better now?”
Harrry let out a breath and looked at the sky. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out a blank piece of parchement. He tapped it with his wand and said, “I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
is purely for the high-quality journalism.” Harry’s eyes widened. Somehow Draco knew he had gone too far. He changed the subject. “How was the fluxweed this afternoon?”
Harry stood awkwardly in Malfoy’s living room, taking in his surrounding for the first time. It certainly wasn’t Malfoy Manor. In fact, it was a really nice flat that could have been a television set on a primetime drama. It was sleek and modern, decorated in black and white and silver. It certainly didn’t look like a place a member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight would call home. The living room opened directly into the kitchen like those American homes he saw in magazines sometimes. He noticed stainless steel appliances and marble countertops. The windows overlooked the London skyline. This was an expensive flat.
Draco took a deep breath. “I miss my mother terribly. I don’t think her sentence was fair. Both us were…neither of us wanted to…but I actually did bad things. She didn’t. Not really. She just tried to survive. She never took the Mark. But she’s sitting in Azkaban, and I’m sitting here.” Once he started, the words just kept coming. “I hate thinking of how lonely she must be. How scared. I have started to be happy again, but then I feel guilty for feeling happy. It should be me in there. It should be me.”
Then he nuzzled his face against Harry’s still-covered cock, breathing in his scent. Harry moaned. Draco reached his hand into his own trousers and gave himself a quick squeeze for a bit of a relief. Harry first, he told himself. It wasn’t entirely selfless. He knew he would have a much bigger orgasm the longer he waited.
“Oh. Okay.” Harry’s face fell. He turned to walk away.
“So full,” Draco murmured. Harry smiled down at him. Draco raised a leg and put it over Harry’s shoulder. “Fuck me now.”
He pulled himself out of Draco’s embrace and stood, taking special care to stretch all his tense muscles. Why on earth did he feel this way? He pulled on a pair of boxers and thought. Well, Draco was meeting Hermione and Ron today. Not meeting, per se. But being reintroduced years later...and as Harry’s boyfriend. It was a terrifying prospect. If Draco had been awful to Harry in school, he had been even worse to Ron and Hermione. Especially Hermione, what with the whole mudblood business.
“Harry?!” The Muggle man turned and looked at Harry in surprise. As recognition dawned on Harry, his jaw dropped. “Oh, thank God!”
It was a good thing he did, too, as Hermione let out a string of obscenities about the rude goblin she had just encountered. But then she shook herself and smiled at Harry. “You look like you’re about to burst. You finally slept with him, then?”
“Incidentally, Ron,” Hermione said. “Want to go into town for the night? I don’t think my room will be available any time soon.”
Harry stopped and looked at Draco. “Thanks, I guess?”
Draco also didn’t expect any gifts, except perhaps from Harry. But he had a new wand holster from Steve, a subscription to
With a few quick Scourgifys and fresh clothes, Draco and Harry Flooed into the Leaky Cauldron two minutes past five. Applause burst forth from the crowds of their friends and family as they entered. Draco blushed and squeezed Harry’s hand. Cameras flashed as they made their way to the bar. Harry told Tom the barman to charge everything to his tab.
“You didn’t respond to any of my owls.”
When he knew Harry was close, he pulled away and took his bollocks in his mouth. “Shit fuck oh my god!”
Harry’s laugh turned into a moan.  Draco hoped Harry would always be this easy to turn into putty. “You wish,” he managed to say.
“Noted. Now spill it.”
“Draco Malfoy, darling. It’s been too long. Tell me, do you have a moment to chat? What’s it like being a former Death Eater, saved by the love of the Saviour himself?”
“You got all flustered and red.”
“Relax, Potter. We have plenty of time to figure out that stuff. You don’t even know my ring size. But yes, I’ll move in with you.”
“Sorry. What’s wrong?”
“No.”
“But I lived. Most of them healed. These just remind me to better. Just like this.” Draco gestured toward his left forearm. Harry took in the Dark Mark, really noticing it for the first time. How Draco could live so fully with daily reminders of his past, Harry didn’t understand. He had spent so long running from his own past that he didn’t know anything else. Ten years after the war, Draco was the brave one. Harry wanted to be brave again, like Draco. He wanted to confront the past completely and accept it a part of himself.
“Oh, bloody hell. Of course it’s you.” He held out the plastic bag of food. “Here you go. Two Galleons and eighteen knuts.”
Harry led them down to the Quidditch locker rooms, the closest empty building to the memorial. “Let me be clear. Everyone saw me pick you out. If you pull a Skeeter on us, it will be the last article you write. I want this word for word.”
Harry blinked. Where was he going with this? “Pretty sure you were there, too.”
“Am I?”
“You’re such a bloody show off with that wandless magic.”
Lavender Brown returned that night. She had some nasty scars but otherwise seemed happy to be back. She even hugged Draco in her excitement.
Draco sighed and planted one more kiss on Harry’s lips, just to shut him up. “I’m sure. Go visit the Weasleys before Molly sends you a Howler for Christmas. I will be fine.” Harry raised an eyebrow. “I will. And if I’m not, I’ll be home to you soon.”
Harry wondered how Draco had learned to cope, but he decided it was way too early in the morning for that serious conversation. He gave his lover a smile. “How about some coffee?”
The next day, Harry ventured out into Diagon Alley to do some of his errands. He picked up owl pellets for his African wood-owl, Oscar. He dropped off some robes to Madame Malkin for tailoring. Then he went to the Potioneer’s shop to replenish his stock of potions. Normally, he ordered by mail, but it was a lovely summer day, and he enjoyed being out and about.
“But what if—?”
Harry stifled a snort. This was going to be a long evening if he did not do something. Hermione led them to the living room, where Ron was sitting by the fire. He stood when Harry and Draco entered the room.
“And guys?” Harry didn’t say anything. “Potter, turn the bloody shower off so I don’t have to scream to talk to you.”
Harry floated on cloud nine for the next several days. He resisted the urge to show up at the Potioneer’s shop over the weekend, thinking that might come on too strong.
“I’m always right. Are you ready, Harry? Just one finger.”
“Why? So you can show me up at my own invention?”
Tentatively, with a shyness Draco had never seen in Harry, he pulled down Draco’s trousers and pants in one motion. “Sorry. I’m excited.”
“Are we going to Popperate there, Uncle Harry?” Daisy asked as they left the Dursley’s front porch.
“Ron!” Hermione chastised.
surprised!”
“Oh, yes. I’m working on a project.”
Harry furrowed his brow, thinking. He had always assumed that Lucius had doted on his son, that the two were close. He remembered how Vernon’s yelling made him feel, and in that moment, he saw the same feelings in Draco’s grey eyes.
By their third pint, Ron looked at Harry with concern. “You’re quiet tonight, mate.”
Draco closed his eyes as Harry stroked and tugged. He fondled Draco’s bollocks and ran his fingers through the dark blond nest of hair. He snogged Draco while he did it. It was the most sensual, emotional sex Draco had ever had. But that was Harry, he thought. Emotions on his sleeve. Harry sped up as Draco’s breathing did. He buried his face in Draco’s neck, sucking hard. He would leave a mark, and Draco loved it. Tomorrow, everyone would know he had spent the night with Harry.
He moved his hand to the zipper and pulled it down. He reached in through the trousers and grabbed Harry’s cock through his pants. Harry gasped, and so did Draco. He was thick, and all Draco could think about was having that up his arse. Draco was a slut for a good buggering.
Draco nodded. A third finger breached him, and Harry gave him a moment to adjust before he began pumping his fingers. Draco opened his eyes. He could see the arousal painted on Harry’s face. He couldn’t wait any longer.
The waiter filled their glasses with a bubbly, sweet wine that vaguely smelled of almonds. “To us,” Draco lifted his glass.
Draco stepped away from him. “Of course it’s important.”
“Wait, Potter, please, that’s not what...”
“If he can’t come, I’ll stay here with you. Molly won’t even notice I’m not there. The Burrow is crazy on Christmas.”
Steve was cute, too. And unfortunately, incredibly straight.
“All right.”
“And that’s why you’re yelling fuck in the shower?”
“Finally, we have added three Healers to our staff, and they will be arriving tomorrow. These healers are trained in Mind-Healing. Group therapy is now a required part of your schedules. You will meet with your year and your house three times a week. One day will be dedicated to healthy coping skills. The other two days are for talk therapy. This schedule will be in place for all students until at least the winter holidays. After that, your assigned Healer will decide if, and how often, you need to continue.
Two months flew by, and soon the day of the Wizengamot vote was upon them. Though public opinion polls favored the law by a large margin, Draco was a nervous wreck, even worse than he had been the day of the meeting with the Minister and Chief Warlock. Harry was nervous, too, but calming down Draco required too much of his attention to focus on the possible bad outcome. There’s not going to be a bad outcome, he told himself.
Malfoy scoffed. “You’re welcome, by the way. I’d never live it down if I let the Saviour of the Wizarding World get hit by speeding hunk of metal.”
Harry looked up to see Malfoy gesturing to his left forearm, where he knew the Dark Mark lay behind the fabric of his shirt. “And where do I come in?”
Harry nudged him. “You sound like Artemis. But not bad. I think they’d want me to be happy.”
Harry shrugged. “The hat almost put me in Slytherin.”
Harry snorted into his coffee at the memory. “Sorry,” he said quickly. But he stole a sidelong glance at Draco and saw him grinning.
Neville shook his head and sat down across from Harry. “She’s so angry. I mean, she’s always had a temper, but I can’t figure out what will set her off next. She’s yelled at me no less than five times since King’s Cross.”
His thoughts wandered back to Draco. Was Draco seeing anyone? Did he deliver food full time? Where did he live now that he didn’t have the Manor?
Half of the eighth year students were in this session. The Golden Trio, of course. Padma, Daphne, and Susan were the girls besides Hermione. Blaise, Neville, and Terry were the other boys. Great. His former nemesis, the sister of the girl he was betrothed to before the war, and his ex-boyfriend.
But if he were honest with himself—which he never was—he often felt like a third wheel with his friends. Or a fifth wheel in this case. Everyone was partnered up. Seamus and Dean had been together since fifth year. Ginny always had a new boyfriend or girlfriend when he saw her. George had started dating Angelina. Even Percy Weasley had a girlfriend!
“Good morning,” a cool, dignified voice sounded from the bathroom, jerking him out of his thoughts.
In time, he reminded himself. He was going to make this good for Harry. Draco was already feeling possessive, and he didn’t even care. He stroked Harry through the thin, cotton fabric.
He dated some, with no relationship lasting more than a year or so. He couldn't avoid the press if he dated witches and wizards, so he usually stuck to the Muggle world. But that never worked out; the fact that his home was invisible to Muggles was the least complicated part of dating. He excelled as an Auror, and he helped raise Teddy. He became the fun uncle to Ron and Hermione’s kids, and he only used his fame for charity. And he continued to adeptly avoid confronting his past.
“You can call me Harry, you know.”
The week just got stranger. He didn’t see Malfoy on Thursday, but he did see someone else from his past. Someone he had never thought he would see again. Someone he very much wanted never to see again.
Harry clenched in response, and Malfoy let out a shout of pleasure. He smacked Harry’s arse with one hand and pulled his hair with the other. Harry had never felt such a satisfying fullness. He was almost certain Draco’s cock was tailormade for his arse.
“Right.” Harry could have sworn Draco’s voice quavered. “So, you and I are—”
Harry propped himself up on his elbows and looked at Draco. “I’m not a virgin, Draco.
Straddling Harry’s hips, it wasn’t long before Draco could feel something hard pressing into him. He rubbed his own erection against Harry’s, savoring the little mewl that came out of his boyfriend’s mouth.
Harry was taken aback. He had just unloaded years’ worth of heavy baggage onto the boyfriend he had only been dating for four days. But he nodded. Draco pulled him back to lay down on the bed then wrapped his arms around him. He kissed the back of Harry’s head and pressed his warm body against Harry’s back.
It had taken them both a war, terrible choices, and a lot of work. But eventually, Harry and Draco had found freedom. They had found each other.
“Do we have to go to that stupid therapy thing since we’re all adults?” Ernie McMillan asked.
“I don’t know anything about money stuff. Can you help me find someone to talk to that won’t screw me over?”
It was just him and his hand this year. Although the other eighth years could leave the grounds, Draco was under house arrest at Hogwarts. And while finding a good lay had never been an issue before, he was now a social pariah. It was a shame. Sex would have been a great distraction from all of the general shittiness of his situation.
Ron sat back in his armchair—another source of contention—and Hermione perched on the settee. Draco sat gingerly on the sofa next to Harry as if he were ready to flee at any moment. They stared at each other, and Harry refilled everyone’s drinks from the now-floating wine bottle. Draco took a sip and sighed.
“What?”
Shacklebolt waved his wand, and Draco found himself surrounded by a sound-proof bubble. He watched as the council conferred, his heart racing. He believed he had met all of the conditions, but Hamish…
“Mind if I join you?”
“Are you ready, love?”
“Indeed.”
“Not a problem at all, Draco.” Dave took a paper bag labeled
“Honestly, mate. Aren’t you a little old to be stalking Malfoy?” Ron asked over dinner at Grimmauld Place on Saturday night. Rose and Hugo were at Molly’s with the other Weasley grandkids. Molly insisted on watching all of the kids Saturday nights and sending them home with their parents after Sunday supper. Every Sunday, she reminded Harry that the offer stood for any future children he had and then asked about Harry’s dating life.
Harry’s career meeting was the following Monday. He had no idea what he wanted to do with his life. The thought of fighting dark wizards ever again seemed terrible. Ron had suggested that he try out for a Quidditch team. But he didn’t think his heart was in it like it used to be. Hermione had been laying out brochures about various career options, pushing him to choose something.
Draco was still in bed, and he bolted upright at Harry’s entry, the sheet draped over his legs and hips. He was a sight, somehow looking both innocently sleepy and sexily debauched. “What’s wrong? Why are you back so soon?”
And then Harry Potter jumped out of his seat. “That’s it?!” His voice was loud, shrill, full of anger.
“Yes, we did.”
“Damn, that feels good.”
Hermione cornered him by the loo later that evening. “What’s wrong? That’s two weeks in a row that you’ve been quiet and zoned out.”
Wednesday was a long day at work. He really needed to spend an extra hour or two finishing up a report, but as soon as five-thirty struck, Harry rushed to the Floos. He impatiently tapped his foot as the long queue of Ministry witches and wizards inched forward. He envied all the departments that could leave on time.
“Yes, he killed the ice cream man and lots of other people. When your Uncle Harry was a baby, this bad wizard, Voldemort, tried to get rid of Harry. Harry lost his parents that night, but he was the only person who had ever survived Voldemort. He was so bad that people were afraid to say his name. They called him You-Know-Who or He-Who-Must-Not-Be Named.”
Harry met Draco’s grey eyes, the ones that used to sneer at him now held only kindness and warmth. Running a charity with Draco. Dating Draco. Life had taken a whole new turn. He had only intended to lend his name and support to this project, but now Draco offered him a new direction in life. “Yes.”
He switched back to fucking Harry’s face. Harry grabbed him around the thighs and pulled him deeper. Draco couldn’t hold back. With a shout, his filled Harry’s throat with his orgasm. Harry sputtered a bit, but he swallowed.
“You’re a good man, Draco. You had shit circumstances and made some shit decisions, but you’re a good man. Don’t forget it.”
