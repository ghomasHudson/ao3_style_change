He could ever so easily tell that Draco wasn't feeling his best self, he could see it like the light of day throughout those four days. He couldn't help but notice, whenever Draco was around, how unusually recluse he was, how
to be here, he just had to make everything up in his mind, so it all goes as flawlessly as could be.
they preferred other than his family issues. He wasn't even sure how many of the people surrounding him actually knew, but it terrified him to think that most of them did, and most of them were talking about it as he walked by. He
"Uh- have a good night, Potter. I, uh, thank you." Draco rocked back on his heels. The words felt new to him, stumbling out of him as if he had just learnt to say them. In fact, he
After Draco left him to deal with the demons of his mind alone in the hallway the other day, and after it all happened just before his eyes, it felt to Harry as though he was standing in a different corner, looking at Draco. He never saw him as the same Draco five minutes before his father walked into Dumbledore's office again. For the past four years, painted in Harry's mind was the picture of a stone-cold Draco, a soulless figure of a guy so full of himself. The fierce look in his eyes felt like a natural, a thin wall that hid nothing behind. But then he heard him, he heard the pain rushing out through his voice. He saw him breaking, and the image of an iron bar Draco faded from his mind. He was hollow, as if every spirit was forced out of him, leaving him as nothing but a shell of a body. His eyes, at the hallway, glistening, fragile like thin glass, and it took someone who truly cared to see through the cracks of them, and it wasn't empty nothingness that lied behind them. He did realize it was merely a mask of egotism he shielded himself with, one he was forced to put on from the moment he was conscious enough to feel the world around him.
"What has gotten into you two!" An exclaim came from a short distance, distracting them from each other for a brief moment. As they turned to face where it came from, they spotted Harry Potter rushing up to them, in Draco's direction to be exact.
He lost count, not that he cared to keep track of how many times he felt the edges of the piece tear through him anyways. For all he knew he felt closer to ludic every time he engraved another cut, felt the adrenaline piling within him one bit more every time. When he figured that it was enough, that he got to fulfill his minimum need, he decided to help himself for one last cut before calling it, not wanting to have any sort of undesired accidents. He gently pressed the edge against his skin and drew a line, he couldn't help whimpering in pain, this one had more pain that pleasure to him and he couldn't quite figure out why, but watching the blood rush out of him like a cataclysm in the sea, he came to realize that this one went deeper than his liking, which gave him one more reason to stop.
"I trusted you, of all people. I assume I'm to blame for it." He gravelly broke the silence when it was too heavy for both of them to bear. He decided that their conversation had reached an end, she said what needed to be said, and if he were to stay there for any longer she'd have nothing to say but to shower him with apologies, her feeble reasons and her crushing remorse, and he hadn't much desire to deal with any of which. So he stood up, feeling as her eyes followed his body like a pair of toddler eyes. He grabbed the letter that sat in between them for a while, and made his way towards the door, hoping that she wouldn't try to stop him.
"Don't you ever learn?" Draco, after having had it of standing there in silence while Harry drew an image of the finest detail of his face in his mind, shoved Harry against a wall with so much force that it hurt, Harry was now aware of where this violent tendencies came from. "Why is it so hard for you to leave me alone for fuck's sake?!"
who he used to be. He enjoyed that calmness, that peace he and Draco had somehow managed to achieve for now at least, and he was beyond willing to make the best of it, and though he'd hate to admit it, he actually found a certain kind of ease when Draco was around, without a fight, when
"You see, Draco, your mother was foolish enough to fall in love with some filthy mudblood. Not only dared betray me, but also, go to something so nasty for herself. And as such, from this moment forth, you're ought to feel no love for her anymore, as she didn't have any for you." His father spoke as though he could read through his mind while walking away slowly, never did he hear his father sounding so cold like a stone.
The next thing Draco knew was that his fingers were curled in a fist with a glimpse of pain spreading through his knuckles as he punched him. He thought he'd feel at ease at last, after physically pouring out his anger, but he didn't, it felt like nothing, he couldn't feel anything changing in him. And so, watching as the boy checked the area of the punch in shock, he punched him again, and again, knocking him off his feet and sitting on top of him, ready to do it again. He still couldn't tell if he felt any different.
Then in the matter of minutes, she started walking away, forced, dragging her feet out. He watched her in utter silence, but lord knows he was nothing but chaos inside of him. And then she was gone, the door shut behind her like she never existed in the first place.
was thanking him. There was so much more to know, so many questions that had yet to be asked, but Harry knew better than to press it. They hadn't built a stable ground beneath them, and anything could break the slim air they stood on.
but he said nothing as his eyes scanned the whole place, running over every face. He was now dressed neatly in his school robe, his fine black suit was gone. He was breathless, perhaps from running through the school's vast hallways on his way to get here.
"Not another word Draco!" His father jerked him by the arm, throwing like a puppet behind him, and using his large arm to block any of Draco's attempts to walk back to his mother. His mother still had that same smile and sparkling eyes, nothing changed, as if she was frozen in time.
He walked through the hole in the wall and into the gryfinndor common room, followed by both Ron and Hermione who seemed to be chatting about something which Harry didn't care enough about to give a listening ear. He let out a loud sigh that felt as though it filled the whole room, drawing his friends' attention to him as he tossed himself on the sofa.
"I will write to you all the time, all the time, and I will love you for as long as I live." She pulled him into her arms, resting his head on her shoulder. Still refusing to answer. She could hear his quiet sobs getting louder, slowly carrying out his pain.
"Why am I meant to believe any of that?" He was shooting her with a continually sharpening glare with the corner of his eye. He could hardly feel the way his eyebrow was arched too high up as he very carefully listened with a plain face without a change. He wasn't anything close to ill tempered, all that she said didn't really make him feel the things it was meant to, as he had yet to belive a word she said. He had no reason to consider anything she said true, even though it was entirely thinkable.
The rest of his group ran off, as it was expected of them since they were only his comedy show audience, only there for the fun part. Meanwhile Harry, who felt like he stood there watching for longer that he was supposed to, ran up to Draco and as soon as he reached him, he wrapped his arms around his waist from behind in attempts to pull him away, but trying to move him was like trying to get a statue to move. His body was as stiff as a rock while he focused on the boy beneath him, and it was only growing stiffer.
"It'll do you so much better if you mind you own business." Something beyond ease flooded Draco as he spoke, but he tried to keep it on the low. Did he actually
"No, it never went this far. He just lost it the other day, this happens sometimes." He straightened himself in his position. "If you kindly don't mind, I'd appreciate it if we didn't talk about this matter again."
Draco watched them walk away rather carefully, and he could hear them murmuring things to each other that he didn't bother to care about. He was waiting for them to completely disappear away from where they could see him and hear him so he could ask Goyle the question that had been messing with his mind since the moment Potter walked in, the question that caused his quite sudden and unpleasant panic.
"Dumbledore, I'd like you to do me a little favor. You see, Draco here, he's been reckless, but he's all set and back to his senses now." Lucuis patted Draco on the shoulder, not in the encouraging father manner you'd expect. It was more of a warning, or a signal to Draco to behave as he's meant to, do exactly as his father thinks he should. Dumbledore on the other hand, he seemed to be listening very carefully, studying Draco for any silent words, occasionally nodding at his father's statement.
Soon enough, the thought of gratitude sank in Draco’s mind as Harry crawled closer, getting on Draco’s lap and straddling the blonde’s thigh. Draco’s chest tightened and he failed to capture a breath, he preferred to look away, hoping that avoiding the sight of Harry would help drown the the thought of how bad he wanted to bury his head in the boy’s neck and scatter hickeys all over his skin. The surge of Harry’s hot breaths against the skin of Draco’s jaw didn’t help at all, nor did the feeling of Harry’s hard cock on his thigh.
"Oh, Mr. Malfoy, what do I owe the pleasure of seeing you today to?" Dumbledore greeted cheerfully as he watched Draco and his father walking up to him. Deep inside, all three of them knew Dumbledore wasn't the happiest to see him, as seeing Lucuis meant trouble to him most of the time.
"W-what is it Draco?" He said lowly, too lowly he thought the other boy didn't hear it, but putting in mind that his mouth was a bit too close to his ear, and the place being deadly quiet, he figured Draco heard him just fine.
As much as he wished Draco was sleeping soundly in his bed, unbothered, Harry was glad to see the ink of the footsteps adorn the parchment, for unlike the two previous nights when he just stayed seated in his bed watching the footsteps leave the dungeons and roam aimlessly around the castle and wait for them to disappear into the dungeons again, he had something in mind. To admit it, it did feel stalkerish, but he had a good purpose behind it, a plan which he hoped would work to fulfill the purpose.
Not focusing on the way before him and constantly looking around in anxiety, he felt himself crash shoulder to shoulder into someone, which snapped him back into real life after what felt like perpetual hours -
"My boy," he heard her whisper directly in his ear, her voice felt agonizing yet sweet, relieving as it washed away every bad thing off his memory. "My life's delight."
In disappointment, he headed to the slytherin table, although up in his mind he was willing to leave back to his dorm. He found his usual seat at the far end of the table taken by a group of chatting slytherins. So, with annoyance growing in him, he studied the table in search of a lonely spot where he can sit all by himself. He was lucky enough to watch Crabbe and Goyle walking away, leaving his old spot vacant for him.
"I full well deserved it." Even though Draco spoke in a tone loud enough for only himself to hear, Harry caught every word ever so clearly, it was hard for them to go unheard in such still silence. And at these few words, Harry had an unmatched urge, like thriving wildfire in him, born of both rage and ringing ache, to do a number of things. He wanted to run over to Draco and push him hard enough to knock him off his feet telling him to shut up. He wanted to go hug the boy tight enough for all his pain to ooze out of him. And he wanted to stand like a statue in that very spot until he drowns in his thoughts, until he can't feel his being anymore.
"Get up." With these two final calm-sounding words, he marched away, letting the sound of his clicking cane echo through the empty hallway.
"If I hear you talking about this again, I swear I'll fucking kill you." He threatened, his voice close to a whisper through his teeth, he was growing breathless and his body felt like it was being cooked.
Harry, on the other hand, was rather puzzled at the blonde's actions to say the least. Though it worried him in a way, Harry felt a hint of relief dash through him for a brief moment. For once he wasn't shut out, he wasn't insulted, and deep down gratitude found a way in him for not staying in bed watching the map with a plain face. It was unlike Draco to act on his impulses, like he just did, or to let his vulnerability show in plain sight. It was alarming, clear as day that something was wrong, too wrong that Draco's long-worn vanity broke to it.
"Thirty points from gryfinndor, for attempting - and succeeding - to start trouble. But, ten points for Mr. Potter for his obliging reaction." Dumbledore announced, feeling a bit proud by Harry and a bit let down by Ben, it was known how he hated to be put in a situation where he has to take points from gryfinndor, but as a headmaster of one of the biggest wizarding schools, he had to be just.
"Bloody hell! Was I meant to not look happy?" He asked, not Harry but rather himself, and he let out another sigh of tiredness, as though he was already tired from the term that had yet to come.
About ten minutes afterwards, Harry could sense Draco walking away. He carefully watched him, from the corner where he hid, limping away with one arm around his stomach, while the other constantly traveled up to his face, wiping away his flowing tears with the edge of his sleeve. No matter how many times he wiped his cheeks dry, they still felt wet nonetheless, even though he was hardly crying by that time.
couldn't move. He had no control over himself, and he didn't wish to have any either. He sobbed, hearing himself get louder. Sobbing out of the pain that invaded his body swallowing him. Crying over the fact that his father was the one to cause his suffering. Crying for he started to suspect his mother's love for him. Crying cause he felt weak, like a lonely stick that could be broken with a breeze. He felt hollow on the inside, empty, like he was a dark cold sort of a night.
They let the silence heavily douse the place around them, taking them in as they stared forward with blank eyes. There was nothing, they felt nothing. It was the peace both of them starved for, it didn't feel exactly like peace, but it was a moment in which there was merely silence, smooth and light, and they couldn't ask for more. The cold was slightly creeping in again.
No, every day is terrifyingly the same, one hell in an unbreakable loop, and it only gets worse if it ever changes. Draco thought. Though, he did appreciate the optimism.
it's September, and September is suicide prevention month :). If you are planning to put an end to it, please don't. I know it's hard and I know what you're going through isn't easy, but just know that there are people here who are truly willing to help, such as myself, and some others who share the experience. If you need any help, please don't hesitate to ask for it, I'm always here to offer all the support I can give. And remember, you're strong, stronger than you think. Self harm isn't an answer either, so don't go for it. Once again, I know it's hard, and you might think it's impossible, but there are countless ways to healthily cope with things, those you have to consider first before going to harm yourself. And know, you're worthy of all the love in the world :).
"What are those, Draco?" His voice only sounded like a brittle breath as he so hard fought away a burning urge to collapse down in sobs. He tried to take in as much air as his lungs could allow in, hoping that it would drown that urge, it didn't help much.
"It's something else," Harry swallowed, suddenly feeling ever so heavy as he tensed up once more, heavy enough that he felt his feet sinking in the floor beneath them. He looked away, his eyes running over the edges of the room, as though it was capable of giving him the words he lost to form his coming sentence. He wished that Draco, who looked at him with disturbed anticipation, could simply read the things he was willing to say through his eyes without him having to utter a word of it.
, he knew slytherins well enough that to want to do his normal day to day life around them, let alone
"Well alright, Mr. Malfoy, there's nothing to worry about. I will make sure to find something to satisfy everyone of us. Now, Draco, follow me, you will be late to class." Never did Draco think he would ever be thankful for Dumbledore's existence. He could feel the old wrinkled hand rest on his shoulder, walking him away from his father who stood still behind them, watching them go.
Harry offered the slightest nod as a response, watching as Draco slowly and with a hint of hesitation made his way away, disappearing into the dark hallway in the matter of a minute.
He fell down, and suddenly his whole body was aching as if he had stones thrown at every part of him. He felt too hot, he was sure his would start evaporating at any given moment. His breath was taken away from him, as though this whole planet hadn't a single bit of air for him. At that point, he was lying down, bringing his knees up to his chin, and despite crying, he had no tears left in him, his crying was only a series of endless whines.
"How?" He so badly wished to be surprised, he wished for the news to have an impact on him but it didn't, as he already expected such thing, he wasn't that much of an idiot to not see it coming from the people who finely enjoyed the struggle of others, there was no valid reason for them not to turn against him at the end of the road. It wasn't surprise or shock that he felt, he felt rather enraged, not because they dared do him like that, but because the memory of his father at the hallway paid a visit to his mind again, remembering that his father mainly came to see him thinking that he was the one who let the word slip. It brought back the sting of his father's hand smacking him across the face again and he could almost see the hell in his eyes again.
what happened, and it wasn't the easiest thing to forget about, and he could imagine how devastated the boy was.
Before he could comprehend it, a stinging pain shot through the skin of his cheek, and his head was turned rather robustly to the side as he could feel his father's hand meet his cheek in a forceful smack. It hurt so much it brought tears to his eyes. He rested his hand on the place where he was hit hoping to lessen the pain but nothing.
Careful steps took him further into the bathroom and closer to Draco, with his hands still wide open before him to signal that he didn't plan on going to his wand, that he was only here for a talk. Draco still held on tight to his wand, which he didn't seem to be able to help.
His eyes ran over the hall, scanning the gryfinndor table specifically in multiple rounds, but all he could find was an empty spot. Harry was late, or too early. The thought of asking Ron and Hermione clicked in his mind, but he brushed it off his mind just as soon as it came, imagining their disturbed reaction.
"Leave me alone." He ordered Goyle, who didn't seem to be listening or caring at all, out of the room. He rolled over, facing away, because, for the most part, he didn't want the idiot next to him to notice the growing terror in his eyes  as the memory of that dream ran across his mind over and over, in an endless loop.
He didn't have high hopes, but it felt like heaven in the making when he could feel Harry's arms, though hesitantly, climb up his back, slowly letting his hands rub up and down his back as he sobbed in his neck. It had been quite some time since crying felt this comforting. There were so many thoughts and questions clashing to invade his mind, but he did well enough to block them away. Perhaps it was his exhaustion that built the wall in his mind, emptying it of even the mere thought of wanting to put on his strongest appearance.
The sound of running water gently disturbed the the silence, being the first sound to be heard in ages. He gathered a handful of the icy liquid in the palms of his hands and blotched his face with it, feeling as the heat of his body slowly mixed with the coldness of the water, and for a moment that didn't last, it eased him in a way. He lifted his gaze to the mirror before him rather briskly, and that murk halo still rested there without a change. His own skin was tightening on him, he felt trapped within his body to the point in which he felt as if his soul was itching to leave.
"I got you this." After a floating moment of silence, Harry reached to his loosely hanging bag, digging through the mess he managed to shove there for his desired item. Then, within a minute, he pulled his hand out again, with a shiny green apple resting in it. "You really like those, I figured."
"Oh look, Potter is here to save the day!" The boy sneered in a cheerful tone of voice, obviously annoyed by Harry's presence, which seemed to be something they all agreed on, even Draco.
"Oh, those." Draco breathed out, his eyes suddenly ever so interested in everything in his surroundings except Harry. His face went pale to a fault, as if every last drop of blood was drained out of him as he used his other hand to subconsciously cover the mess of cuts. "Well, er, it's a burn."
In response, Harry nodded ever so slightly, preparing to walk the two of them away as he came to notice that Draco was too frozen in his thoughts to move on his own.
It was a figure, a pair of arms wrapped around darkness, the head resting on the shoulder of a silhouette. Most of it had yet to be covered with paint, only an outline drawn with a pencil. And just like the one Harry had noticed, this one was all in dark tones, holding the same sense of sadness. But just like the one before, Harry found a rather strange pleasure in that melancholy.
"Harry, you seem, very zoned out today. What's the matter?" Hermione asked in somewhat of a playful tone, sitting on the floor and facing Harry. Next to her sat Ron, gently holding her hand.
Silence stretched between them, consuming them whole. Harry kept his eyes unmoving on Draco, watching him collect his breaths with a struggle. He was letting himself fall in whatever his mind contained, Harry could tell, he was giving up to himself against his own willingness, letting a more venerable side of him show as he lost the battle he started with himself. His frown was no longer shaping his face, instead there was a broken look on his face, his lips quivering ever so slightly and his eyes, wide and mellow, looked to be damp already, gleaming as layers of tears pooled up in his eyes. It quickly caught Harry's eyes, how one of his hands made its way to the other arm, hoping to be unseen as it sat on where his cuts were. As if subconsciously, his fingers scratched on the cuts in a gradually growing speed, until he looked at the crimson inlaying the tips of his fingers Only then did he seem to wake up.
His father seemed to be pulling something out of the inside pocket of his cloak, and as he held it up for Draco to see, it appeared to be an envelope, still not looking back at his son. "Then care to explain this?"
"Hey Daniel, did you know that Malfoy's mom fell in love with a mudblood?" He shouted across the grounds to someone who seemed to be standing just down the little hill he sat on, while trying to look back without breaking the eye contact with Draco.
"Professor, I understand the point you're trying to make here, but violence is violence. Draco's physical offense was only a result of Ben's
"Don't flatter yourself Malfoy, I'm not here for you. I need to talk to professor Dumbledore." The other boy spoke with a sigh, his words didn't fail to sound so cold. He was clearly bored, and had other things that were more important than Draco's old I-don't-want-you-around game. To admit it, Draco was a little disappointed with Harry's reply, his ego was wounded on behalf of his child self, who had his friendship offer turned down.
At last, Draco let go of the boy, finally giving Harry the chance to drag him away. He was now sitting on the ground, his body started loosening bit by bit as his eyes stuck at the sight of the half knocked out boy beside him. Harry could hear his panting growing louder, as if he had spent years without a single breath.
What happened next was blocked from his mind, he couldn't feel it nor could he control it, almost as if he was being controlled by something beyond his knowledge. He was only awoken by a sensation of pain like fire eating the skin of his knuckles. The mirror was now in pieces, he could no longer see the halo for he could no longer see himself looking back at him, which felt strangely satisfying, like a goal he achieved. His fingers were tainted by the deep scarlet blood, with the areas that were lightly smeared and the reddening knuckles, his hand looked like a work of art. It was quite deiform to look at, yet still it terrified him.
As breakfast was over, the Great Hall was gradually getting quiet. Only a few gryfinndors were left including Harry, and they formed a little group around the table to talk about what seemed like an important matter. Hermione had left, leaving only Ron and Ginny with Harry.
"I was there, in the hallway after Dumbledore. I saw what he did to you, your father." He figured the words would be a lot easier to speak if he let them out in waves, with slow pauses of silence to make up his mind for the words that followed. He was right, it did help quite a lot. His voice even sounded almost as serene as he desired. "I know where these bruises came from."
, Harry had explained. Internally, Draco cringed at the mere thought of muggle music, even though he hadn't listened to any of it. He did
He could see, every time he passed past him, his clothes hanging baggy on his body, which by that time had become so thin and fragile like a dried petal of a flower, as though he would break in a blow of breeze. The bones of his face had an appearance more than they used to. And looking closer, Harry could see heavy dark bags forming under his restless eyes. And his lips were chipped, covered by bits of dead skin as Harry caught his chewing rather aggressively on them often. His hair still maintained its natural neatness, yet still it felt messy in a way, he no longer cared to wake up half an hour earlier than the rest of the students to get himself in the best shape possible. Now, he was most likely to sleep in and get caught sleeping during classes, and yet still he looked restless. And according to the story everyone claimed to hear from McGonagall, he was found one night lying on the floor crying in a dark hallway after hours. Harry was able to believe that story, as he saw Draco excuse himself out of classes with his face looking flaming red as if burnt rather often, and Harry allowed himself to assume he left to cry. He was aching to know what made Draco cry that often and that openly, yet he knew better than to ask.
was really there, bare by Harry's side without his cover of ego, if only that tenderness wasn't born of ache.
The lighting in the bathroom was dim, almost nonexistent, but still he could spot the tiniest little glimmers in Draco cold-blue eyes, caused by the gathering tears that worked like sparkling water. His face was broken into an unfamiliar pucker, something Harry had yet to get used to since all he had ever seen from Draco was his smirks of pride. He never really had the chance to see pain - or any other emotion - appear ever so vividly on his pale face.
"Silence, Harry." Dumbledore shushed the moment he opened his mouth, putting his long wished dreams of walking away from it out of his reach.
"Well then, good night. See you tomorrow at breakfast? Please do show up." On his way out, Harry turned back for a last glance. His hand was in the air, and he waved with a sheepish smile before completely focusing on finding his way out. On what earth did Harry ever want to see Draco?
Harry's head was turned towards the door rather violently as someone stormed in furiously, catching not only Harry's attention but everyone else's. At first glance, he saw Draco standing tall at the door momentarily, and it felt to him as though the blonde boy was staring right at him and specifically him. But Harry knew for a fact he wasn't.
"It's late, you need to be in bed." Draco took a short journey to where his shirt lied unnoticed, pouring his whole attention on picking up the shirt from the ground in a snail's pace in order to avoid further contact with Harry.
When he was close enough, Harry grabbed the boy's pale arm, and his action was followed by a muffled hissing-like voice escaping Draco's pressed lips. He scanned that spot, his eyebrows meeting each other in a frown. The beat of his heart was only growing louder in his ears as his muscles tensed up at the sight, he suddenly couldn't swallow a rather large lump sitting in his throat. He felt a strange sensation of fear, not of the view itself but for Draco, for it hurt beyond his imagination to see Draco's pain reaching the point where it reflected itself on his body at last. He saw the cuts before his eyes with various stages of recovery, some of them looked to be weeks old while others seemed raw as though they were only created a few hours ago. If there was one thing too clear about them, it would be that they're nowhere close to a burn of any sort.
"Well that's not the best thing to do, is it? Besides, we better hurry up before professor McGonagall transfigures us to some pocket watches." There wasn't a nice way for Harry to tell Ron that he didn't care one bit about transfiguration, not at this time. Yet still he walked with him, heading to their meant class, drowning in silence now.
and he wasn't even sure if he could trust his ears as it felt as if his mind was playing tricks on him, since every other voice sounded to be saying the same. He found himself rushing away with gathering speed, no longer trying to find his way to class as he would much rather go back to the slytherin dungeons. He couldn't hear any talking-like voices, everything from his surroundings was muted and replaced by the loud pounding of his heart in his ears, and his breathing pattern as it grew louder, but yet still it felt like everything grew ten times louder in his head. He was on the verge of passing out right in that spot. But no matter how fast and far he strode, it felt to him as though he was walking that same hallway over and over again in an endless loop, as if the way out of it was only the way back in.
"I thought I was very clear, Draco, when I said there must be no contact with this woman." His father mountained on top of him, as if waiting for him to get up.
"His absence was quite unusual, but we'd be pleased to welcome Mr. Malfoy into the school again." Dumbledore replied, and it wasn't like he could say anything regarding that other than what his father pleased, it was weird how his voice tone almost never changes. Not when his faking, not when he's being real, not when he's pleased, not when he's sad, if it ever did, Draco wasn't the one to notice it.
, and he was all willing to forget everything Draco had ever done to him in order to help make him feel better. He jumped up on his feet, fueled by the anger and disappointment he had just been given, and made his way out without the thought of looking back at all.
Talking about all that spread glimpses of joy all around him, faint and hardly felt, but it was the best he had felt through these recent days. He could tell, Harry was barely following, he clearly didn't have such experience. Yet still, the look on his face, brightening as he watched Draco slowly drift into his talk, it showed interest, telling the blond that although Harry didn't exactly have a clue, he still relished the chat itself.
"It keeps me up all night, and I know apologizing doesn't help either of us but still, I'm so truly sorry, Draco. If it helps, I only did it out of worry in the first place." Following her honeyed statement, they fell into deep, awfully distressing silence. He could feel her eyes burning through him in search for something to ease her mind, and she knew it was only a wild goose chase. His eyes remained fixed on the floor outside his desk, with a frown forming heavy on his face. He could hardly feel the way his teeth dug through his bottom lip, chewing on it rather violently, until a metallic taste spread in his mouth.
"I want you out of my house, Narcissa. You do not deserve to be here anymore." He heard his father's voice slowly lowering out of tiredness, and then there was pause. The whole place fell into a state of silence that almost felt peaceful.
"Charms." Draco shrugged rather carelessly. Charms was never a favorite of his, and he couldn't truly wrap his mind around how anyone enjoyed it at all. The thought of the class ahead gave boredom a way into him, and just by thinking that he would have to just sit with random students flicking their wands around probably incorrectly made him feel closer to being alamort.
Harry’s head got heavy on Draco’s shoulder, and as the blond glanced at him, he looked to be fast asleep already. He’d passed out.
"Professor, he didn't use magic against him. He threatened to do so, yes, but did not." Harry spoke at last, after giving it some thought whether he actually wanted to be a part of the conversation or not. But it was an urgent desire to tell the truth, even if it defended Draco, that was just a bonus, because he knew it by heart that Draco didn't care enough to defend himself.
"There he goes." The boy said to the rest of them as he watched Draco slowly rise up from the ground and straight on his feet. He knew that this was what the boy wanted of him to do, to get him to his very edge, and he couldn't help but let him have it.
Draco pulled out his wand, pointing it right into the boy's neck. His hand was shaking rather noticeably as he gripped on the wand with so much more force than intended. Unable to control his unstable hand, he felt the tip of his wand digging deeper into the boy's neck, and he didn't really mind it.
"Leave me alone for fuck's sake." He replied with his voice low and heavy. He had no power or desire to fight, or to make a scene and let the ones who didn't know know. He looked away, hoping to find them gone when he looks back, but unsurprisingly they still stood there, laughing again.
He let a desperate sigh escape from his lips as he was tired to doing all the talking. Looking at both of them, he could easily tell that they didn't know what they're meant to do about it, and they just didn't care enough to do anything at all.
"Why are you doing this, helping me and all? Haven't I hurt you and your friends quite enough?" He questioned despite everything in him telling him not to. The silence that took them sat uncomfortably heavy on Draco's chest to the point that he felt, if he had to, he'd scream at the top of his lungs if it was what it took to kill that silence. He found nothing better to say than to ask the question that paid his mind a visit the day Harry held him by the waist out of that fight, and it lingered whenever he was around. Something within him knew that in no way possible Harry merely wanted to help out of the goodness of his heart, he found it hard to believe that there wasn't more to it. Of course, it wasn't beyond imagination that The Golden Boy would help anyone in need only driven by the urge to, but Draco knew he wasn't someone worthy of Harry's kindness, he after all gave him and his friends quite the trouble all through their years in Hogwarts.
He did catch sight of Draco rushing to the exit of the Great Hall the night before, flames coming out of his face as he tried to trap as much as he could within himself. He saw the way his facial features tightened as he read a mysterious piece of a letter, knowing that whatever that paper hid had planted a severe sort of pain within him. Harry could hardly hold himself in place without running after Draco, everyone sitting around him must had sensed him burning as he watched the blond leave. He knew Draco ran off for a reason, he wasn't that much of a git to deny the boy the space he needed to process just because he wanted to know. And following the footprints that had just faded a minute ago, he figured Draco had had enough space with himself, and it was safe to check up on him.
Big empty space it was, the manor. A word that's said echoes and returns as multiple weaker versions of itself, yet it never leaves. And there he sat, Draco, with the company of nothing but still air, staring at the nothingness deep within the house. He might have been bouncing his knee, but he didn't feel it; his mind was too busy trying to find a way out, a way through which he didn't have to hear them.
”Touch me, Draco,” Harry groaned heavily right in Draco’s ear. “I know you want to. I heard you the other day in the prefect bathroom, moaning my name as you jerked off.”
He felt the need to walk away as he watched them march closer in his direction, he wanted to be hidden from Harry's sight while he still could, and he couldn't exactly put his finger on why it was too urgent that he goes before he's seen. He had no problem seeing Harry, or even having a settled conversation with him, which left him lost in why it urged him so badly to just walk in the opposite direction.
Despite the blinding sunlight breaking through his eyes, giving them a kind of a glimmer, he could see a group of four people he couldn't say he had seen before, but judging by the colors of their uniforms, the gold and red, he could tell they were gryfinndors.
He didn't feel threatened at all, in fact he never felt as safe around Draco. He almost knew it by heart that Draco wasn't meaning to do anything.
"I'm not an idiot, Draco! I know what these are!" His voice came out with a pitch louder than his liking. He was starting to question why he asked in the first place, he knew what these were, and by heart he knew that Draco wasn't to tell the truth of his life depended on it. He marched towards the other boy with rather huge steps now, driven by a sudden burn in his gut.
"Okay! What the hell?" Goyle muttered under his breath as he hesitantly tried to find his way out and away from Draco, who felt like an unstable bomb.
He sat in bed that night, just like the two other nights before, and he looked around to find everybody drowning in a death-like sleep, the steady symphonic audio of their breathing was somewhat relaxing to listen to. His lips curved in a smile before his eyes fell back on the map in his hands. His eyes were stone-hard, heavy as if the weight of the world was forcing them shut as he sluggishly fought away sleep, and they felt dry, too dry to the point that a few tears wandered down his face in desperate attempt to sooth his eyes every now and then. But it being the third night in a row, he got used to it. He faced no trouble brushing it away to focus on the better thing he had in mind.
A roommate of his was still fast asleep, it didn't seem to be that early, judging by the faint chatter just outside the door. A perfect time to wake up for any other student, not too early and he still had time to get ready and have proper breakfast, time wasn't the matter in his case. He lied still, his body unable to afford a blink of his eyes as he blankly gazed upon the ceiling. Exhaustion had already found a way into him, as if the mere thought of having to wake up and pretend to be living a perfectly flawless life drained him. He didn't want to go about pretending to be living a perfectly flawless life, he didn't even feel the will in him to live a perfectly flawless life.
"Hermione, have you noticed a change on Draco?" He was looking at her with hopeful eyes, like a child. He was hoping that worrying about Draco's bizarre behavior was an issue that worried everyone, so that he didn't feel weirded out the way he did.
There was no way for them to tell that a whole full hour had glided by like a breeze. There wasn't a way to tell what time it was, and to admit it, they truly didn't a have a spare thought to waste on time. Throughout that hour, Draco had learned that Harry's whole life revolved around quidditch, not only from the way he talked about it like it was the source of all passion in the world, but also, he could see it in the way his eyes widened with glimmers like shooting stars when he mentioned the golden snitch in his hands, the way his lips twitched in a smile and tried to hide it when he brought up that one match with hufflepuff.
Harry’s legs spread wider automatically when Draco’s lips landed on Harry’s inner thigh, inching closer with the tip of his tongue over his skin. A tingle ran through Harry’s system at the feeling of Draco’s heavy breaths warm against his skin, giving his goosebumps a rise, his free hand running up and down his other thigh in a gentle massage. Draco licked the area one last time, pleased with the sight of yet another hickey adorning Harry’s skin, thinking that no one else got the chance to mark him there gave the blond a rush of heartbeats.
He effortlessly untied the black ribbon and brought Harry’s hands to his lips once they were free, tracing that thin red line on his wrists left behind by the faint pressure of the ribbon with quick kisses, drawing a bracelet of kisses on both of his wrists. Then he wandered down to his neck, placing kisses with the same gentleness on each of the two marks. Harry, who had his hands free at last, threw his arms around Draco’s neck and buried in the white blond nest that was now messy, trying to take in all that’s possible of the scent of his hair - which was something between vanilla and honey - that lingered. Before Draco could go any lower to the mark on Harry’s thigh, his head was pulled back up and the two pairs of eyes met.
expect Harry to be into classical symphonies anyway. They talked about books, but exactly as Draco had anticipated, Harry was solely fully interested in
With every word of the letter, Draco let his weakness overwhelm him. He didn't really want to put any more effort on fighting his tears away, so he let them wet his cheeks as freely as they wished. He was scared, the words in the letter planted so much pain in him, he was hurt, and there was no point of playing tough.
Then none of them said a single word, as if all of them were silenced by some sort of an invisible force. They all stared blankly at Harry's passing figure, as if he specifically was not meant to hear a word of what they said. Draco couldn't help but fix his gaze on him, as everyone did, and he didn't know what to feel. He wanted him away, to vanish because the very sight of him, his messy appearance and bright eyes, was filling with with unnecessary annoyance, he couldn't put his finger on why exactly it was bothering him so much. Yet on the other hand, he was almost too scared Harry could tell what was going on in his life, and that he'll use it against him, but for the first time in almost two weeks, he felt noticed, he felt his being and it felt good. A lot of feelings were aroused within him, yet still he kept his eyes looking through Harry's as if there was nothing else to look at. And he watched as that red headed Weasley grabbed him away, not knowing where to feel grateful or upset.
Harry stamped a tiny kiss on Draco’s lips, as if to distract him from the way he slowly pushed down his precum stained boxers. Draco’s heart raced ever so loudly in his ears to the point that it was almost all he could hear, and the throbbing between his legs was getting unbearable. Draco’s erection jumped out on its own once it was set free, and Harry failed to keep his hands to himself, he gave it a little bump up and down of admiration, feeling a breathless moan against his lips from Draco. He slipped out of Draco’s grasp and onto the floor where he knelt by the bed, inviting Draco to come as well.
"No one ever does." The few words that Harry mouthed delicately caressed the skin of his neck, suddenly making him uneasy around the stomach that he felt inclined to push away, hoping that by doing so he might regain his breath that he lost.
"Who knew anything about me anyway?" He faced away. The thought of how everyone viewed him as a completely different person from who he really was always gave him a certain sort of pain, one that made him struggle to look at the mirror without loathing the image looking back at him, especially as of recent. He himself was seeing himself as that popular loathsome image of him.
"Here." She ever so slowly, almost hesitantly, pulled an already opened and folded again letter and placed it on the desk before him without having the nerve to look up at him. She was shrinking smaller and smaller with each passing minute. He eyed the piece of paper put before him, he feared to see it in a way, hoping that there would be nothing to prove her right, there would be nothing to give truth to her words, but the sight of it shattered those simple hopes of his.
Draco stopped at last, without turning back to look at Harry who kept walking up to him. Harry knew well enough that he didn't dare turn to face him, he didn't expect him to anyway, for he knew that Draco Malfoy wasn't the one to be confident enough to show his tear-burnt face.
His hands clawed at a black envelope, the once neat envelope couldn't maintain its graceful fold against the strain of his shaking fingers, which had a lot more strength than his weary mind could possibly control. He could feel the tiny droplets of sweat in the palm of his hand blending with material of the paper in his hand, as it absorbed it welcomingly.
It was a matter of fact that he didn't focus on all three of them, not all of them were his main point of interest. His eyes uncontrollably met the grayish blue eyes of Draco's, which looked right back into Harry's bright green pair of eyes, and in that very moment the world felt like it was moving noticeably slow. He hated that weird feeling of relief that overwhelmed when he saw Draco standing next to his father, dressed in that black suit of his which by now felt very familiar, standing with his hands behind his back as if he was trained to stand in that position. It felt to Harry like he finally found something he'd been looking for for way too long. Draco, however, didn't seem to feel the same. Instead, his eyes still held that sharp gaze he got from his father, his eyes looked like half broken glass.
With his eyes lingering to Harry, he traced Harry’s dick with his tongue as if he was licking an ice cream, and watched Harry’s back arching a little higher with a moan louder than the rest, which only seemed to tell Draco to do it again. And again, Draco licked him clean over and over, having that reaction doubled. Then, when he was done with that, he took Harry’s stiff cock in his mouth again and sucked without lifting his gaze off of Harry. As he sucked more and more, Harry overflowed him with moans, biting his bottom lip to trap in those who could have been far too loud, with random incoherent babble slipping through the moans, something along the lines of
The despair that weighed down Harry’s voice attracted Draco, he stopped his sucking and traveled all the way up, his face hovering hardly an inch away from Harry’s, and he smirked mischievously.
Harry made sure his steps weren't heard as he followed behind Draco in silence. He seemed to be in a rush, as though haunted by his own shadow. It took Harry a bit of a moment to gather up the voice to speak, as he was still struck by what he got to see, and he knew for a fact that the blonde boy would rather die than talk to him in that very moment.
He quickly buried the red stained piece of glass under his pillow and charmed the blood off his arm, and with pain shooting through his whole arm, he struggled to pull his sleeve down again to cover his torn up arm. It was hellishly hot in the room around him, as though the flames of hell itself surrounded him, and by that moment he began to assimilate how lonesome he was, he finally came to see that the dungeons were already mostly empty and how there was almost nothing to be heard in his surroundings. He obhorred these moments of sudden realization.
"Draco, if you want to talk about it, it- it's okay." He attempted to give any bit of help, and for a moment he lost all hope when Draco looked up at him, both his eyebrows arching and his lips slightly quivering. "It's fine if you, er, prefer not to talk about it. But if you do wish to speak, it's okay to tell me." He reassured as he felt the need to, after all they were enemies for years.
"We managed to tell  her that you're just an arrogant swine, which you may or may not have been." After being done with his work, the gryffindor sat on the floor facing towards Draco, hugging his knees closer to his chest. Chuckles smoothly slid through his last few words, and Draco could only wonder how he got the confidence to talk to him with such ease, something he truly wished he had.
He helped himself up, and then held his hand out to Draco who, surprisingly, took it, and with a bit of a struggle he was up on his feet again. He fixed his robes on his body just about as soon as he stood straight, and then let his hand reach to his face to wipe away the faded traces his tears left behind.
He leaned forward against the sink, letting the paper drop onto the floor as if it was too heavy for him to hold for much longer. For a moment, he just kept his eyes shut as tightly as they could that it hurt, refusing the urge to open them again as he felt himself a step away from pouring out, all of him, everything he felt was a blinking second away from flooding out of him. He felt like a volcano, his irascibility well mixed with the agony that was aroused by the memory of every moment throughout the last few weeks felt like active lava inside of him, painfully searing to the point that he felt the need to let it erupt. He didn't want to, he didn't want to sit in a dark corner and cry his eyes dry, for the longest time he thought that grousing his pain out to the walls until his lungs ache would help, but upon doing it over and over for days, it lost its charm, and became nothing but physically draining himself without a result he could feel. He wished to close his eyes for long enough for it to all go away, somehow melt away within him, or find away for it to flow out noiselessly.
“I- I can’t!” Only a minute later, Harry’s voice came out in an actual sob, terrified by another failure after he couldn’t do something as simple as keeping his hands away, and he thought Draco was only being forgiving when he only got him tied up, but if he fails again Draco would have no option but to punish him.
"Draco, please. I'm trying to help-" He sounded to be the desperate one in the room as he pleaded, but he didn't really mind it.
He strode away with audiable steps, and Draco quietly followed behind. His legs felt like iron as the desire to just disappear off the face of earth bloomed within him, he was beyond thankful it was only them two, yet still it shouldn't had happened, there wasn't a valid explanation for it. He tried to swallow the lump that sat right in his throat, wishing that things would just go back to being the same as they were in the olden days, when he and Harry only flooded each other with insults, that felt better, it felt real.
Draco’s chest went rapidly up and down in search for air, as if the air of the world couldn’t possibly fulfill his need. With breaths loud like wind, he looked down at Harry who was still kneeling in his spot, trying to meet his gaze. Harry’s eyes pierced through Draco’s as he used the back of his hand to wipe away the remainder of the cum off of his bottom lip.
"She did!" He never had that much courage to talk back to his father, but this time was different. His father never really crossed this line before, and therefore neither did Draco. Yes, he would occasionally poke him with his cane, hit him once or twice at a time, but that was the furthest he ever went. But now that this line had vanished, there was no reason for Draco to respect it.
"Talk about what? She's left all right. I lost the only glimpse of love I've ever had." His words came out in pieces, and it was left to Harry to put them together.
Draco couldn't help but look in Harry's direction, he couldn't help but observe his every action, and deep inside him he knew he was scared despite hating to admit it. He was haunted by the thought of Harry having any bit of a clue about what had happened to him, it terrified every bit of him to imagine it, thus he couldn't help but keep a very close eye on him every time he was around since the moment he saw him in the hallway when he was with his father. His eyes held questions, and that terrified him. From his seat at the end of the class, he could see him looking at Hermione who sat next to him, murmuring something Draco wished he knew. He carefully watched the way his lips moved, trying to get close to knowing what he was talking about, but it was a failed attempt. As he couldn't take his eyes off the boy, he would occasionally catch him looking back at him while he talked. Knowing Harry was talking about him, he couldn't help his growing anxiety. He could feel every pair of eyes refusing to leave him alone ever since he walked him, and he could feel himself having a spot in everyone's mind, and for the first time in his whole life, he didn't like it.
Before he could reach for the door to open it, Harry took the largest breath he could, aiming to welcome in as much air as it would take to drown that sense of nervousness in him. It happened every time, whenever he planned on having any sort of conversation with Draco, he would sink in his own hesitation and uneasiness, as though he was one bit too scared to say something out of place, something that would make Draco only despise him more. This time, however, he wasn't hesitant, he didn't have thoughts of turning and heading back to his bed, he
"Put the wand down, Draco." Draco, though hesitantly, lowered his wand slowly when Harry told him to. He seemed to feel safe at last, or perhaps just too tired and bored that he didn't bother to care even if Harry was to hurt him.
"If she did she wouldn't have left you!" He kicked him with every word that came out of his mouth, and he was only kicking harder with every word. "If she did she would've put a fight for you!"
"Thank you, professor Dumbledore. I sure hope that you would be kind enough to teach him the wrongs and rights, a bit of detention will do." He couldn't help but look at his father with utter confusion, he wanted to scream as loud as his voice could go and punch a wall as though he was mad, he just needed a way to let everything flow out of him and attacking his father seemed just right to him.
His eyes fell on Draco, to find him standing still as if he had been frozen in time. His ghostly eyes that he fixed steadily on Harry wasted no time in blinking. If Harry didn't know any better, he'd definitely begin to think that the other boy had been cursed. His face lost all color and went pale as dead, letting the redness in his cheeks illuminate his whole dimmed face. His eyes resembled the surface of ice on a winter day, that very same color, with that very same muted glimmer and for a moment Harry thought he could see the same rifts on the surface of thin ice. They looked to be wide enough to contain a whole edgeless universe within, and they were only widening. But then the moment that followed, he was thrown back to his body. His once apart pair of lips came together in a growing frown, and he promptly broke the shared eyegaze Harry tried to maintain, preferring to look down at where his feet stood. And Harry watched as Draco slowly circled himself with his own arms, as if trying to hold himself together for a few drifting seconds. He watched a bit too carefully perhaps, carefully enough to notice the way his hands slid down to his hips and rested there, his fingers drilling through the skin where his bruises lied.
"Excuse me, professor Lupin, I'd like to borrow Mr. Potter from you for a few moments." While in the midst of talking, professor Lupin was interrupted by the familiar old voice of Dumbledore, causing every head to turn facing the door, especially Harry whose name was called.
"I'm more than willing to be by your side from this moment forth. I guess you can say that I didn't unerringly understand how crushed you are, I focused on one side and completely forgot the rest, but here I am now, so please. "
He could hear the stone moving against itself, raucous sound broke the silence of the night and he so hard wished he could it stop it, in fear of anyone hearing it, despite knowing that it was half impossible to find someone awake roaming the castle this deep into the night. Elysian shapes were beginning to engrave themselves on the once plain wall, taking the form of an arch, until at last it formed a full door, after seemingly ages of praying ever so tightly for the noise to turn into silence again.
"I was rather fascinated by one of the paintings, the first one I laid eyes on. The one with the fountain and all." Draco couldn't help but wonder if the boy before him had always been this cheerful, if his voice had always held that ludic surge. His hands took no rest, moving around in the air as if trying to explain, pointing to one of the paintings.
"Oh thank goodness you're well! How do you feel?" McGonagall rushed to him, standing now at the side of the bed, taking his hand and giving it multiple squeezes as if she was trying to check something. He could not believe it was the same woman who insulted him before her whole class yesterday. Was it yesterday? He couldn't tell for sure.
They stayed like that for aeons it felt. Just like that, frozen with Harry's figure pressed tightly against the wall behind him, and Draco's figured pressed against him. He had his hand on his chest gripping on his red and gold tie a bit too firmly. Harry could see the red bruises on his knuckles. And it was unknown to Harry why he didn't even think of pushing him away. Their faces were close, maybe a bit too close that they could see their reflection in each other's eyes, and to Harry it felt as though Draco was trying to hold his breath.
He glanced around the darkness of the room one last time, to make sure that none of them was conscious enough to feel him leave or feel his absence later. He climbed out of bed as slowly and as quietly as ever, feeling the cool wood of the floor warm up beneath his feet. He picked the closest thing to a clothing item he could see off the floor, which was a hoodie, and put it on just as quietly. Making his way toward the dormitory door, he glanced back again, praying that this wouldn't be something to regret later. He didn't exactly have the best feeling about it, following Draco, but it was a voice inside of him that insisted he did so. Seeing what he saw and knowing what he knew, he knew for a fact that it would very much keep him up all night if he ignored it, it could carve in his soul deeper to ignore it than to be insulted for trying. It wasn't one of those things he could brush off for someone else to handle, as he was the only one who knew, and it wasn't a cold matter to sleep on.
He looked at his mother, with something far from hatred or disgust, but rather with pain, and she could read through his eyes that he didn't care one bit for any of what his father said, if he believed any of it at all. She looked back at him, her eyes soft and glistening like dying stars. Tears were pooling through her eyes, making it hard for him to read her emotions through them, but if he could find one thing through her eyes, it would be the love she looked at him with, the love his father claimed nonexistent. He wished to scream at the top of his lungs.
In a bit of a distance, he spotted the pale figure of Draco, giving him his back with a half blank canvas before him, judging by the way he seemed to focus on it, Harry could tell he was reaching a dead end with his painting. He was shirtless, that caught Harry's attention a bit more that he'd like, and his pair of trousers hung an inch below his waist.
Falling harshly right back into that thought, Draco couldn't give a response other than silence, which to Harry signaled a yes. He was heavy again, and it showed through everything in him. His eyes darted towards the floor, and every breath he took seemed to burn its way in.
as he mouthed the few words to him, it felt more like a death threat. But that was something he expected -
He turned back, and in the surge of a moment he threw his arms around the emerald-eyed boy, pulling him in to his chest with all the power he had that the other boy struggled to keep his balance. He wasn't thinking, and he didn't want to think, this could be his person in the world and he was inclined to hold onto him.
Why did he even talk about it? He still couldn't really wrap him mind around why did matter to him enough to tell his friends about it, and why did he expect them to help. Why did he himself even think about helping? He was annoyed that he was still thinking about the drained look on Draco's face, and he hated the fact that even when he was pissed off about thinking about it, he still worriedly thought about it.
Draco watched as Harry shoved a spoonful of food in his mouth, eating as quickly as he could since it was the last few minutes of breakfast. His eyes were unsettled, roaming back and forth around the hall, until they fell on Draco, who in return struggled to move his eyes away from the boy. Harry's face lit up with a smile of satisfaction, which he tried to hide as he got a questioning look from Hermione. Draco's cheeks gave an embarrassingly bright shade of pink.
"I do. No matter how horrible you think you might be, you still don't deserve that. You need to remember that." He replied as he let go completely, letting the distance grow between the two of them and instantly feeling weird about that embrace, but not guilty.
Hullo whoever reading this, so this might be the one of the last or the actual last chapter before I put this book on hold, school is starting soon for me and it's my senior year, so I won't have time to write, so yeah, just letting you know.
He sat on the bed by Harry’s side out of tiredness, rubbing his hands together and drawing in a massive breath. Harry was for once quiet, he looked to be deep in thoughts with his eyes focused on one spot in the room, refusing to leave it. Draco was grateful beyond what he could show that Harry had stopped moaning, afraid that another moan or two would get him unwillingly turned on.
"While you were staying in the hospital wing after your fever attack, a letter came, addressed to you but without mentioning whom it was sent from. Goyle suggested we open it, as much as I told him not to, he wouldn't listen to a word I said. He insisted, claiming that he was rather concerned after noticing your bizarre behavior, he said and I quote '
As a few minutes flew by, Draco was thrusting harder and faster, enjoying the nice warmth and wetness in Harry’s mouth as he fucked it. In an accident, Harry had let out a little moan while sucking, but he came to find out that Draco had actually liked the sensation of sound against his dick, so on and on, Harry let those little whimpers drift out of his lips freely with his eyes glued on Draco, awaiting for a reaction. There was an undeniable hint of pride thriving in him whenever Draco signaled that the gryffindor was doing a good job.
"Pansy, what part of I absolutely don't care are you having trouble understanding? There's nothing that I need to know from you. What is it that I should do to keep you away from me?" His eyes never met her eager ones while he talked. On usual basis, he'd do anything to know whatever anyone was keeping, he'd like to know all he could, this time was entirely different. He'd like to know whatever he could when he could trust the person saying it.
Draco was enveloped with warmth that wasn't his own, a swift surge of ease flowed over him in a moment he didn't foresee. Slowly, very slowly, he felt loose, untied by his own being at the feeling of a pair of arms taking him in, pulling him closer until he could feel Harry's fully clothed chest against his bare one. He felt
them. His fingers clutched tightly around the broken piece as though it was a ray of hope that he feared to lose in his hand. He ran it over his inner forearm, slowly he started before dashing it across. He could feel that cleft vein pulsing, and leisurely he felt as the adrenaline spread through him. At that point, the jabbing pain only lasted for a brief moment, and soon enough there was no more of it, which demanded yet another cut. And so, he traced the piece over his forearm again, and then repeating that same pattern over and over until he could see the blood immersing the spot like a puddle.
He was so full of his exasperation, and within it lied hints of pain, powerful enough to crush his already worn out being. However, it wasn't scorching him to let it out, he was alright letting it surge and swirl inside of him, he was used to it enough to know how bury it deep until he could no longer feel any of it.
Harry's upper arm was suddenly and quite firmly grabbed in a manner that startled him, as though Ron was trying to channel his attention to a certain thing, which left Harry is a state of confusion. And to get more attention out of him, Ron pulled on his arm, which felt like a bit of a shake. Looking at Ron, who seemed both concerned and shocked, he couldn't quite figure out what Ron was too desperate to get his attention to.
"But you don't understand!" He found himself almost yelling, his voice gained a pitch from the trouble it caused him to think about how he was expected to just sit and watch, without really understanding what truly bothered him about just sitting and watching. "It isn't that he decided to leave us alone, it's just, he isn't going on with his life normally without annoying us. Something has changed. And if I know something about it, it's bad."
"I did not!" He did not mind his voice coming out louder than intended, nor did he mind the bits of confusion that found their way through his voice. He was genuinely confused why his father thought he did this. His father let go of him, it felt somewhat soothing, to feel that his father believed him. But it was too good and too soon to be true.
To his not-really surprise, he saw Draco standing right behind Dumbledore's back, and next to him stood the boy from the fight yesterday. A red spot settled just underneath his eye, a little plaster that matched the skin tone of his red-looking face seemed to hold his nose together in place, and the little cut just above his lip was left exposed. Quite frankly, it was a bit of a shocker to see the boy up and well, his bets were on him occupying a hospital bed for a day or two at least. The three of them, clear as day, could hardly breathe at the presence of others.
He still hadn't written back to his father, and he knew his father was turning into a bundle of fire sparks awaiting for a reply as he sat there thinking. He most definitely could give the whole world if it meant that he'd be anywhere far from that awful excuse for a father, but his mother was nowhere for him to choose. She all of a sudden stopped writing to him, he waited for her owl every early morning at the window, but every time he walked away with his hands empty. Last time he wrote to her, knowing by heart that he'd be getting something comforting back, was when his father left him in the hallway with bruises all over his torso, and after that, he never saw his mother's owl. He knew nothing about her whereabouts, he knew next to nothing about her new life in fact, so choosing her was like choosing to be adrift in the wind, to be wayward and lost, choosing her was like choosing nothing. His father had quite the habit of giving hell to those who go for anything other than what he wished.
"Have you told him, Malfoy?" The boy smirked once Draco let go of him for a moment as his fingers began to hurt from grabbing his collar too hard. "Maybe if you tell him, he can save your arse."
"I don't know, professor. I haven't been studying." He replied once more. By that moment, his voice had gone weary, almost like he had no energy left in him to speak, or, probably, he had had enough wasting his energy on their vain conversation. Harry had noticed, with every word he said, he looked at everything but the woman talking to him, and it felt to him as though he was a trapped animal trying to escape.
He felt trapped in his own skin, his body was gathering heat, making it hard for him to find a breath. His arm felt dull, as though asleep, he could hardly reach out to his tie to loosen it. He was sweating more than he liked, as if his body was squeezing itself dry.
He watched as the gelid water placidly blended with blood into a pinkish colored liquid and slowly hissed at the pain it caused. For a moment, he studied his set of twenty uneven cuts with something far from admiration, the sight of them sent him into a cold sweat. By that time, he was quivering like a stick in the wind. Coming to see and comprehend what he had done took him into a whirlpool of foreboding. For once, the sight of blood adorning his almost colorless skin didn't amuse him, instead it took his breath away, and he suddenly felt frozen.
”Can I make you feel good too, make up for my disobedience?” Harry toyed with the waistband of Draco’s boxers as he spoke, his voice nearing a whisper with a tone so soft and misleading with a disguise of innocence that hid nothing good behind, like a poisonous flower that was indeed gorgeous on the outside but was sure to lead those who it entranced to their demise.
"Fine." Harry breathed out quite violently, which in a moment felt childish. But he was truly angered, mostly at himself because he
Everything before Harry’s eyes started to look as if underwater, and in a moment of doubt he did check his face for his glasses to make sure he was still wearing them. They were there, resting soundly on his nose, yet everything was a blur. Ron and Hermione had just left after butterbeer and a little chat, he could hardly remember anything from a few minutes ago. After the room doubled, spinning like a broken record, he found himself trying to reach for the exit to get his friends and tell them that he wasn’t feeling well, but standing up only made everything about a zillion times worse; piercing pain shot through his head once he leapt to his feet. He felt like a hot air balloon yet heavy like a load of concrete. His vision soon became misty, as if he had clouds layering up on his eyes with random glimpses of light that looked to be everywhere. Hazy and swaying, he was greeted by a stiff blow of cold wind biting his cheeks outside. He squinted his eyes all he could, hopeful to catch sight of either Ron or Hermione but nothing, everyone was like a faceless silhouette. His vision started shifting from the place where he was and suddenly he was in his dorm, with someone but it wasn’t Ron helping him walk, it was Malfoy. Despite the cover of snow on the front of his hair, he felt like a ball of flames, as if every object around him was radiating heat like the sun’s, he was so sure the snow was melting under his footsteps. His heart was pounding like a wild tornado in his chest and his breathing was only getting louder. He tried to lean against the nearest wall for support. He was with someone in his room, he had his hands tied behind his back as he got shoved against a wall. He could feel the pulse growing worse in between his legs, and for some reason he was getting so hard. Whatever was it he was going through had managed to get him horny in a way, horny enough that he was convinced this agony would linger even if he were to come ten times in a row. Up in his head, he was getting fucked against that wall in his dorm, by Malfoy. He tried to tell himself that in no way was it Malfoy, it was probably Cedric or another one of his boy crushes but there was no mistaking the white blonde locks and the ghostly gray eyes.
"What spell did you use on him, Mr. Malfoy?" He questioned, regaining the calmness of his voice. In the corner of his eye, Harry could see the taunt smile on the boy's face growing wider, taking the joy of feeling like he was winning. Harry couldn't help but feel irritated on Draco's behalf.
"Mother don't leave." He cried into her neck, repeating it over and over again, begging. He felt despair find a way into him, and every time he did, she repeated that sentence again. She pushed away slightly, resting her right hand on his cheek again, running her thumb across his cheek wiping away the trace left behind by hundreds of tears. She looked at him with a smile, without uttering a word. He wanted her to say something, anything, but her lips only moved in a smile. Her eyes sparkled as she looked at him, like they had a whole galaxy in them.
He decided against reading the letter, keeping it for another time when he was all by himself. Despite hating to see it, it was the last trace of his mother, the only trace that wasn't a mere memory.
"Listen, Draco, I- I'm so deeply sorry." She proceeded, throwing what she'd just been told to the back of her mind. The lump in her throat made her sound as though she was choking on her own words, but even that was enough to get her a piercing glare from the corner of Draco's eye.
just learnt to say them, not the words themselves but to whom they were said. He felt childishly embarrassed, but embarrassment was a familiar companion tonight, he had his fair share of it. It was the ease that was new, the ease of thanking someone for help, knowing that
"Didn't know you could paint." He spoke, for a moment he could say he wasn't aware he spoke. His nervousness vanished in him at the pleasant sight of all the paintings. As he looked in Draco's direction, he saw how the boy flinched as he turned to face him, almost dropping the brush and the palette of colors that rested in his hands.
"So we read it, maybe more than a single time as it didn't quite solve the mystery, if anything, it made it about a million times more bewildering, meaning it wasn't even close to enough for Goyle, it only made him burn to know more. It was from your mother, we later came to figure that out, and it said something about wanting to come back and hold you one last time, to keep safe for she knew you'd only be your father's favorite when he needs to put out his fury. Quite frankly, I grew truly concerned, being lost while knowing something extremely serious is going on, and I'd say I was the only one feeling so, the two only grew mischievously curious."
He pushed the door open at last, a little crack, through which he could see Draco's figure sitting on the floor, leaning against one of the toilet stall doors, undressed from his vest and robe, letting them lay unnoticed on the floor beside him. Harry still couldn't make his presence known. Never had he ever seen Draco cry with such anguish, never had he ever seen Draco cry at all in fact, never had he ever heard a sound carrying that much pain within, certainly not from Draco. Hearing the sound of his sobs alone planted a kind of pain deep within his bones, as if the pain which filled the crying could permeate through the solid of the body. His elbows pressed against his knees while the palms of his hands buried his face within them, letting his fingers grip on the front of his hair. Harry felt weak at the sight of him.
Draco rolled his eyes in boredom, but he didn't look as bothered by the lack of justice as Harry, if he was bothered at all. The boy on the other hand, seemed to be very pleased with the outcome of the conversation, looking at the two of Harry and Draco with a sneer he didn't intend to hide.
"W-well, he- he pointed his wand right into my neck! He threatened me! And I highly doubt it was but a threat!" He jumped as soon as he realized things weren't going exactly how he wanted.
"I like what you said there Mr. Potter, fair point." Dumbledore's approval wasn't the only thing Harry got for his clever-sounding statement. He could feel the two boys' eyes burning through him like fine light through magnifying glass. When he looked over his shoulder, he could see Ben's lips moving in
“Someone has been a good boy with little mistakes, eh?” He breathed the hot air Harry let out, whose panting was heavier than ever. He could feel Harry trying to catch his lips that were a small distance away from Harry’s, but Draco only smiled, enjoying keeping his lips out of Harry’s reach.
He walked the hallway that morning, late on his way to his potions class, and he could feel countless pairs of eyes following behind him wherever he went, eyes that appeared to say all sorts of things about him. Every face his eyes fell on was looking back at him, with pity, with worry, with a happy sneer sometimes, all while every mouth seemed to utter words he couldn't figure out to various companions.
His father came out a while after, seemingly for a breath of air, but once he did the air got thicker. His father, unlike his mother, seemed to noticed his figure at the end of the hall, but he wished he didn't. He glared at him, his eyes suddenly so sharp, as if the sight of his son was a disaster in itself, it felt like a warning of a kind. Draco wanted to disappear.
Against his anticipations of being let go, Harry was pulled even deeper within Draco's arms. He could feel Draco's hands grabbing a handful of his hoodie on his back, his fingers burying themselves in the clothes as his clutch only grew tighter. It felt so peculiarly exultant, the warmth of Draco's heated body radiating against his own, he smelt like faded cologne. He never thought he'd feel such pain, such affliction wrenching his guts at the mere sight of someone else's pain. He could feel warm tears against the bare skin of his neck, and the sound of sobs muffled in his neck somehow had the sensation of touch, he could feel the voice on his skin, and it sent shivers down his spine in ways no other thing did. He so desperately wanted to pull him in closer to his chest, even closer, but his limps felt too feeble, powerless, as though they were filled with nothing but water.
"Draco," with so much effort to get his voice to be heard, Harry's voice came out more like a whisper. He walked in, a few careful in, as though he was walking on thin ice.
He presumed that it was for the best he leaves, tries to find his way out of the bathroom and back into his bed before he crashes there where everyone could see. And so, with that thought in mind, he charmed the floor clean of the few drops of blood, and put the fragments of the mirror back together. He didn't know where his feet landed, there was no floor wherever he stepped, which led him to constantly trying to avoid nonexistent holes in the ground.
"I know everything, a lot more than you think I do." The words burnt their way out of Harry's lips, heavy to the point that he felt like he needed breath breaks between words. In response, he only got a sarcastic sounding chuckle from Draco, who turned to face him once more, his face all so covered with a look of deep annoyance yet still Harry thought he could spot the slightest hint of pain somewhere in his eyes, as if a sensetive memory had been awoken.
Her response did disappoint Harry, knowing that he was the only one who was unreasonably anxious about the boy he hated most, or thought so for too long. But he somehow didn't think about it, not one bit, as though once her sentence was heard, it was thrown to the back of his head almost at once, he couldn't feel the disappointment as he was meant to, it didn't bother him much that he was quite obsessively concerned about Malfoy.
"Accio first aid kit." At his words, a white box came floating towards the two of them, and within the next moment, it rested right by Harry's feet. Draco's stomach tingled the slightest, and he could only swallow,
and an occasional beg for more, Draco was expecting himself to cum from the mere sweetness of the sound. And he tried to thrust into Draco’s mouth; it was too good he couldn’t seem to get enough, Draco had to pin him down by the hips to stop him.
Draco kept looking down as he walked after that, hoping that it would help put down the thought of what everyone thought of him now, how they all viewed him as, hoping that by not seeing their burning gazes, he doesn't feel their unrequired attention.
"Well in that case, we do not tolerate violence in this school, Mr. Malfoy, with or without magic." Dumbledore informed, choosing to believe Harry, yet it wasn't quite the satisfactory. "Twenty five points from slytherin for your reckless behavior, Mr. Malfoy."
"D-Draco?" A chipped low voice came from behind, followed by a slight tap on his shoulder. He recognized that voice, and it both terrified him and elated him at the same time.
"Father, please!" He cried so loud he felt a sharp pain in his throat. His knees felt too week to keep him up, and in any moment he expected to feel his body hitting the floor as he collapsed.
His physical pain overpowered almost every other thing in his mind. He no longer felt the pain of his mother's words in the letter, he was no longer scared, he hardly ever felt anything of what was around him and there was only the soreness spreading through his bones. But somewhere in the corner of his mind, he knew there was a bit of truth to his father's words, it felt worse than all his father's beating that up to one point he wished that his father keeps going, hoping that if he felt enough physical pain it would swallow the mental pain.
"Right." Harry did notice the negative change in Draco as soon as he spoke, knowing that he had brought back a thought Draco had put effort into forgetting. "But hey, every day is a new day. There's always a chance for change."
His vision started blurring gradually, everything looked misty, covered by a thin layer of white, pain was creeping into his eyes. He could hardly feel his feet, he felt as if he was floating, as though there was no ground beneath his feet. There was an ongoing peep in his ears, and he chuckled at the thought that this could be his heart echoing in his ears again, except it had stopped. His fingers felt full, heavy like he had stones at the tips of his fingers, the  broken piece of the mirror dropped to the floor as his fingers loosened, and shattered into two more pieces. He could feel his body pulling him back, like two large hands hauling him back with force that took away his balance, it felt as though he was standing on the edge of a groundless pit.
"No Draco," he was losing one bit more of his strength, both physical and emotional, with every passing second, he hated talking about it just as much as Draco did, but Draco seemed to enjoy extending their conversation. His feet took him closer to the blond with cumbersome steps, his legs felt like two crappy built columns in a hurricane. He pointed to Draco's arm, watching as his pair of gray eyes traveled all the way down to where his finger directed. "
Once he found a lonely corner, Lucuis let go of Draco, throwing him away to the wall like luggage. Draco struggled to stay standing after his father threw him, nearly falling before he hit the wall behind him. He couldn't exactly say he didn't see that coming. His father looked away, his eyes were facing the stone of the building but he could hardly see anything through his fury, meanwhile Draco kept his eyes fixed on his father in dread. He did expect his father to do so but he had no idea why, so as he looked at his father with panic-struck eyes, he silently begged to know.
He sat up on his bed, wondering how on earth it gave him the capacity to move one bit of him. His head was spinning, and it was like he had a stone for a head, it almost pulled him back right after he sat. After a battle against himself to regain his balance, he sat straight, and a atrocious feeling washed over him like ocean tides. His stomach was turning in anticipation and it felt strangely mixed, yet still even though he tried to think of how light it'll leave him feeling afterwards, guilt overflowed prior, as though there were dark figures of people hiding in the corner, their crowded whispers wiped him clean from every bit of thrill he had, and made him feel as though he was a blood thirsty freak of a sort.
"I don't really care to explain, professor." He answered rather bluntly, shattering Harry's high built hopes of getting an answer. McGonagall's eyes widened, filled with what seemed like anger towards the statement she found disrespectful, yet she kept herself together, without saying a word.
Draco gave a last glare before he let go of Harry’s jaw and went back down, his head between Harry’s legs. Everything looked too good to be true, just like in one of his wild daydreams during potions class when he drifts away watching Harry chop his asphodel, the thought of having Harry screaming under his mercy driving him out of his head that he so badly wants to punch a wall. But there he was now, in Harry’s bed with Harry under him, hands tied above his head and his face looking tense in the best way possible. He had sure slept with multiple people, but the feelings Harry made him feel when he moaned was nothing to be compared with any other, it sparked something in him no one else or nothing else could.
"Yeah right, they thought your brain got cooked." Turning to his right, to where the voice seemed to come from, he saw Goyle, sitting on a stool beside him and laughing at his own stupid statement, the statement that only got him disapproved and annoyed looks from all the three teachers. Goyle and Crabb were the very last couple of people he wanted to see at that moment, anyone but them. That was a thought he regretted thinking of almost immediately.
"Let go of my son, Narcissa. He does not deserve to be touched by a disgrace like yourself." His father pushed him back rather robustly that he almost fell off his feet. And in that moment his eyes fixed themselves on his father and refused to look at anything except him, looking at him with  somewhat of a shock, somewhat of a fear, but mostly anger. He wanted an explanation, he
"Leave me alone, Potter." Draco ordered in a rather austere tone of voice, austere yet low. He was getting jaded, perhaps too jaded that breathing itself felt like too much work. He no longer wanted to talk, at all, not even to mention Harry away from him. He was ready to sit there for hours in silence even with Harry around if it took less talking. "And I want to see a little of you as possible."
Harry couldn’t balance the feeling of disappointment and confusion in him when Draco sat him aside and stood up, heading seemingly towards the door. The blond could feel Harry’s eyes burning through his back with questions as he walked yet he gave no answer. But the following minute, a surge of relief washed over Harry at the sound of the door being locked, it wasn’t over yet. Draco’s hand reappeared from the inside pocket of his jacket gripping on his wand and muttered a spell, which Harry’s heavy mind could only assume was a silencio spell. Then one by one, every piece of clothing that covered Draco’s body lay discarded in a pile on the floor by the door as he took them off, leaving nothing but a pair of pants on him. Harry’s excitement was surreal, to the point that he felt like Draco was doing everything extra slow, yet still, he let himself enjoy the ecstatic sight of Draco’s half naked body, and his hard cock shamelessly showing under his pants, leaving very little to Harry’s imagination.
"Is there any problem, Potter?" Harry blinked twice before realizing that the question was addressed to him, looked up from the pale hands to his face. Malfoy had one eyebrow raised, curious, his eyes narrowed slightly as he watched the gryffindor's somewhat widened eyes, Harry only managed to shake his head negatively before turning his attention back to the open book in his lap.
Her friend's response came faster than he expected, maybe he was lucky she still didn't get on the plane.
He ate while listening to Winky talking about how things were going, sometimes the elves asked him if he wanted more and even though he said he didn't need anything, they served him and he found himself trapped there with more and more food in front of him.
"This is madness!" Harry leaned over the table, hitting his forehead on the wood. He had been with Hermione and Ron in the library for an hour, reviewing the lessons he would have to finish after Christmas.
"Being Harry Potter does not help in the final grades, especially in potions" she pointed out closing one of the books she read, while Harry muttered under his breath, turning his face and pressing his cheek against the table "Harry, I saw what this potion and it's... particularly complex."
It had been almost a year since the war, Hogwarts was being rebuilt step by step, the school year had started and a few students from the lost seventh year of 1998 returned to finish their studies and do the N.E.W.T.s.
He noticed the pen that streaked the parchment, only stopping to renew the amount of ink or to rest on the paper when pale fingers released it to change the pages of that huge book in the center of the table, Malfoy looked focused, his forehead frowning a little while reading, his lips twisting to the side in a confused expression just before his attention turned to the pile of books on the left, looking for something specific, Harry could almost hear the displeased sigh that escaped the slytherin when he realized that what he was looking for wasn't there.
Harry read that letter more than once, and then he replied asking Hermione to stop the mystery and tell him right away.
"And how much time do you need to make one at least acceptable?" he asked before thinking and saw one corner of Malfoy's mouth lift in a half smile.
Harry pursed his lips and looked at the Slytherin, that same curious expression still on his face, but now a little more annoyed, as if he expected some kind of judgment. Harry hesitated, staring at him, until Malfoy seemed ready to say something else.
Malfoy bring the quill to the parchment and Harry began to wonder how the scratching of the tip on the paper made no noise, everything else did: flipping through the pages, adding ink, Malfoy's leg shaking, his breathing slow and calm, the small clicking noise of his tongue in frustration as if he had missed something in some lapse of concentration... but the writing was silent, the pale fingers clenched without force against the quill were quiet, almost graceful.
He tried not to be bothered by the attention he received when he returned to school, although this increased - a lot - his desire to be hidden in some corner, it took a while before it was routine to see Harry Potter, the Savior, walking down the halls without attracting so many looks.
"Unless I've a second head growing on me right now, I hope you've a good excuse as to why you keep looking at me like that, Potter" Malfoy said firmly.
The slytherin slid his eyes over the first few pages and gave an incredulous laugh, it wasn't mocking, but he certainly seemed to have found it amusing.
He sighed, he would think about it later, it was getting dark and he was hungry. He got out of bed, stretching each part of his body and hurried out, passing through the main entrance of the common room and was surprised to find Malfoy exactly the way he was hours ago, Harry wondered if he had even gotten up for dinner, 'cause there was no indication of that.
Harry didn't say anything, he and Malfoy didn't argue anymore, on the contrary, whenever they met the feeling was uncertain, as if they had so much to say, but not enough words.
Harry nodded, picking up his book from the table and heading up the stairs, totally ignoring the lump in his throat and how his heart sped up with that last sentence.
"Harry" it was Hermione who spoke, whispering firmly "I already told you, if you think you can't make this potion, ask Professor Slughorn to give you another one."
Going back to Hogwarts was Hermione's idea, of course, but Potter had no objection to that, even after all, he missed the castle.
"Are you sure you don't want to go to the Burrow with me, Harry?" Ronald Weasley asked for the fifth time that week.
Harry realized he had been staring too long when he saw it, he had to blink two, three times to see if it was real. It was the first time he had seen a smile, not a mockering one, smug or smirk, in Malfoy's face. He tried to move before the slytherin noticed the gryffindor's sudden stop at the door, and as soon as he took the first step, Malfoy looked up, his expression becoming more serious, but not closing or darkening completely as Harry thought would happen. He didn't seem bothered by Harry's presence, perhaps a little surprised and even sharing the slightest discontent that was knowing he wouldn't have the Common Room for himself.
Harry tilted his head to the side to be more comfortable while watching the fingers of the slytherin's left hand tap the wood in a melodic rhythm, it was the fingers once again that stole the gryffindor's attention, they seemed different, as if something was missing in both the hands. Wasn't there a ring on his finger since Harry met him?
It had been a while since he had sent the letter to Hermione and Harry was lying face down on the bed, he had already finished two History of Magic scrolls, it's just a matter of time to finish all the lessons, two more paragraphs for Runes, read the Transfiguration book and finish the drawing of the star map that Firenze had asked and that's it, everything would be fine.
Harry watched the paper with immense curiosity, even though he had an idea of whom Hermione would advise to help him, he imagined that it's only 'cause of the good grades the boy had, knowing that his friend had really talked and, not only that, she seemed to have established a minimal bond of friendship with the slytherin, made his heart flutter a little. He knew that Malfoy had changed, but reading it almost explicitly by Hermione herself... He really didn't know how to feel.
Draco Malfoy was sitting at a wooden table at the end of the room, reading a very large book, he didn't hear the passage open and, for a moment, Harry did not move, perhaps it was anxiety, or the desire to not attracting attention or even the surprise of seeing Malfoy outside his room. He looked relaxed, with his elbow on the table, resting his head on his left hand, he turned the page and raised his eyebrows, arching the corner of his lips in a brief smile.
Potter blinked, confused, listening to the elves talking excitedly about Malfoy's visits and some recipes he said were his favorites.
"Yes sir" an elf with big blue eyes replied "Mr. Malfoy comes here almost every day" she said, smiling "Tinker makes the chocolate cake that Mr. Malfoy loves, Mr. Malfoy who said it."
Two weeks before Christmas the train left, almost completely emptying the Hogwarts corridors, the school had never been so empty and, with some parts destroyed, it seemed strangely melancholy. On the same day that the students left, Potter spent the afternoon at Hagrid's hut, he knew that his friend was still shaken by the terror that was carrying Harry while he thought he was dead, so Harry planned to spend his free time with Hagrid, reminding him that everything was fine now.
And they had nothing to complain about the Eighth Year Common Room, perhaps only the lack of colors, it was a lot of gray and white, the students assumed that, perhaps Minerva and the others avoided as much as possible showing favoritism to any of the houses. But still, the place was cozy.
When Harry returned to the Common Room, Malfoy wasn't there, his book - now accompanying scrolls, quills and inkwells - was, but he couldn't be seen. The gryffindor sighed a little relieved. Harry started admitting in the third month of school - and Ron would call him crazy if he knew - that, in a way, he missed the rivalry with Malfoy, it's true that the slytherin was an asshole when he was a child, that he made Harry mad and that their arguments were childish and silly, but they occupied his mind and, now recalling some, even amused him. Having someone who hated him made him feel more normal and not The Boy Who Lived - not to mention the boredom he's experiencing now that all he do is hear Hermione saying that he and Ron should focus on the N.E.W.T.s.
"That's not what I meant!" she stood up on a sigh, picking up three of the six books that were close by "Just stop being stubborn."
The little elf really looked happy, she brought him a tray of what was probably the main course of the day, but there were so many pieces of chicken there that he didn't even know if Ron would be able to eat it all... He probably would.
Expressions of surprise and disdain spread across the faces of the people around when Malfoy was introduced as one of the students who returned, what was mostly heard were dialogues like "How did he have the courage to come back here?" "After all the things he did..." "But wasn't he... bad? " " A Death Eater! At Hogwarts?!”
Of the few who were there, Ravenclaw students stood out as the majority, followed by Hufflepuff, Gryffindor and, to a lesser extent, Slytherin. It turns out that, with all the terrifying events that those walls witnessed, many were uncomfortable with the idea of returning, gave up, trying to erase those dark memories, staying as far away from that place. As for the Slytherins, most of those who supported the losing side of the war fled, took refuge, others didn't return for fear of judgment, even though they were allies.
help any of you, keep that in mind. And, Ronald, you haven't finished Professor Binns' lesson. For yesterday" she emphasized the end of the sentence and left.
