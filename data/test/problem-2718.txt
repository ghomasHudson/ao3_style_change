Draco shrugged.
So far he had made no progress in discovering what the egg’s shrieks meant but he wasn’t going to give up anytime soon.
“Rita Skeeter is going to have a field day with this isn’t she?” Draco could already imagine a front-page article with his name on it depicting exactly how he fainted after being saved by his secret lover.
—————————————————————————————
He’s managed to do what all wizards haven’t in the last two hundred years!
“So... I was wondering whether you wanted to do something with me today... you know, take a break?” he asked hopefully.
Harry stayed by his side all afternoon and watched him like a hawk during dinner, which for Draco was a very uncomfortable event.
His mind hadn’t processed yet what he’d just heard so he didn’t really know how he felt about Professor Snape being his godfather.
He looked at her blue eyes and then moved his gaze down to her soft pink lips and subconsciously found himself leaning in closer and closer to her. She reciprocated the move.
“So they’re together now... right?” Hermione said.
For the next hour the healers worked tirelessly on the boy. Finally when they were finished Healer Montary (that was the name of the healer that was in charge of the boy) came out to tell them about his health condition.
“Oh, uhm... nothing... it just said I would do well here in Ravenclaw”
Snoodle made a little noise and hopped over to the edge of the bed. Understanding what his pet wanted, Draco picked him up and gently set him on the floor where the bunny hopped to his cage and settled on a pillow to snooze for a bit. Last night he and Draco had stayed up a little later than usual to finish an interesting chapter on the Cure for Boils potion so now he was tired.
“Isn’t there anything you can do to help him?” James asked Healer Montary, the same healer that had treated Draco a year and a half ago.
“Well, if we don’t have dates we can always go together as a group” Draco said and opened his text book.
Cedric had been great as well and the two of them spent as much time as they could together as this was Cedric’s last year at Hogwarts.
When Draco’s heart finally slowed down he looked at her warily.
————————————————————————————
“Mr. Potter, your son suffered a very rare magic outbreak from his magical core. This type of affliction isn’t maligne and won’t harm the boy himself or anyone else. Rather I’d say this ‘gift’, as you’ve called it, could result rather useful should he or anyone around him be injured” Healer Kum explained.
He also noticed he could now see clearly as if he had night/water vision.
He was tired and dirty and he felt like he had been walking for a year but he didn’t stop.
He watched with a sad smile as Harry, Lily and James apparated away to the train station, leaving the house unusually quiet.
Yes, it was indeed from his ex girlfriend.
The girl looked up from her work in the Library and looked at him distastefully.
“Harry,
He spent almost all day sleeping because he was under a lot of painkillers as the Healers monitored his recovery, which was going smoothly so far.
‘Draco, you’re so brave!’, ‘You’re so cute!’, ‘Marry me!’ some of them would call when he passed them through the corridors and he had to do everything in his power not to blush.
“Trouble in paradise?” he heard someone say as he turned his head and saw Kate smiling at him in pity.
Nott, of course, was careful and made sure he and his two goons, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle, were never bullying him out in public and waited until he was alone.
“It’s fine” Draco said curtly, not even glancing at him as he magically dried his pajamas in the bathroom.
“Blaise, stop antagonizing him” Pansy glared as the Italian raised his hands in surrender, muttering something about favoritism.
Well he was Wrong with a capital ‘W’. If only it got even stronger.
Draco remained a bit unconvinced but didn’t say anything.
“Yes, Headmaster” Draco said obediently as the Professor kept on explaining to them exactly what they had been chosen for.
————————————————————————————
He shifted slightly to adjust himself in a more comfortable position.
“So, what did you want to see me about?” he said as he sat in front of the Potions master’s desk
“What do you think it means by ‘We've taken what you'll sorely miss, an hour long you'll have to look and recover what we took, but past an hour — the prospect's black too late, it's gone, it won't come back’?” Cedric asked him after a moment of silence.
“Maybe I can speak to them and ask them to stop...?” Draco said in a hopeful voice.
Standing up, he noticed their purchases from earlier had been left on his desk.
The next day Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy’s trials were taking place: as expected Lucius got a life sentence in Azkaban while Narcissa got 80 years without the possibility of parole.
Draco smiled but didn’t say anything, opting to just tighten his hug around Harry. Soon it was time for them to part as the brunette took Draco’s suitcase and deposited it onto the hallway floor while Draco said hi to his parents.
After a few minutes the potions started simmering so it was time to add two and a half Water Seeds.
“You lost it when they took you and Dumbledore asked if one of us could keep it safe and return it to you when you came back” Ron explained.
He looked so peaceful and calm.
Draco gulped nervously as he sat in the comfortable chair in front of Dr. Dirwin’s desk.
Harry was having a stroke.
She just wasn’t going to stand there meekly and watch her friend suffer.
“No, Mr. Malfoy. On the contrary, you’ve been very good. We’re here because I would like to show you something” Dumbledore chuckled as he pushed open a small door and led them into a huge room with a tall ceiling; as he looked around he saw the only piece of furniture in it was a mirror in the center.
“Perfect! Then you release it and when it makes the papers you can show Potter just how important your work is, Draco. You can show him exactly what he’s so carelessly thrown away” Blaise smirked and clapped for himself.
“DRINK FIVE MINUTES BEFORE TASK. JUMP INTO WATER AND WAIT 5 SECONDS. FOR BREATHING-WARMTH-CLEAR SIGHT”
“Uhm... I’m looking for Hermione Granger...” he said.
Draco smiled to himself: he knew Sev was uncomfortable with publicly displaying his affection but honestly, Draco didn’t mind if Kate knew how much his godfather loved him.
“Kate these are my friends: Harry, Ron, Hermione and Lavender. Guys this is Kate” Draco introduced.
Healer Montary looked at him with sad eyes.
There were a few shocked gasps in the crowd, which listened eagerly to the conversation.
Finally after about ten seconds she let him pull away. He glared at her hatefully.
“Sorry” he whispered. He and Kate were still very close.
He stroked its black fur, which was very soft and fluffy, until it stopped wriggling.
With infinite love,
“Good morning, Snoodle” he said as he pet him on the head and the bunny raised his ears in response. Chuckling quietly he became aware of the smell of food coming from downstairs.
In the end, he chose Hermione as he felt he could trust her. Not that he didn’t trust Lavender, it was just the other girl was a bit of a gossip and was known for accidentally spilling secrets.
Spending the remaining time of the trip with Cedric, Draco’s mood slightly improved by the time the train arrived at King’s Cross station.
“RAVENCLAW!”
Harry was waiting for him on the platform and the two of them made their way to their parents in complete silence.
“I know what you’re trying to do and I’m warning you: back off. Draco is mine!” he sneered at her as she rose up from her seat.
The Gryffindors all looked up as Lavender rushed into the Great Hall.
Hagrid had already informed him he would be going last as he was older so he waited for his name to be called as the group of First Years grew smaller and smaller.
When Hermione didn’t answer, Harry retorted to shaking her slightly by the shoulders.
Being nervous only increased his chance of getting hurt and being distracted.
Draco simply looked at him with sad and disappointed eyes.
Rita Skeeter”
I desperately want to believe that you’ve changed so I’m agreeing to meeting with you to talk.
Him, Ron, Hermione, Lavender, Dean and Seamus were all sitting in their empty Common Room, trying to think of a way to explain what had really happened yesterday.
First he felt a slightly tingling sensation in his fingertips and toes. That sensation spread to his whole body and he felt warmth in him almost as if a fire had been lit inside him.
James got up and Draco readily looked to the ground.
Ron huffed.
“Do you not like it?” Harry asked him.
To make the smell more inviting (because so far it smelled like rotten eggs/fish) he added some Rose Roots and let them soak in the liquid before taking them out.
During the summer Harry and Draco spent almost every day together and by September they felt like they had known each other all their lives.
“It wasn’t your fault. Don’t feel guilty about this, Cedric. By the way, thank you for saving me” he said. Cedric nodded but his face didn’t lose its sad look.
Everyone agreed.
Draco looked up from his book and smiled, his  eyes lighting up. Harry’s heart sped up in his chest.
“You look beautiful” Draco said as he looked at the witch in his arms.
“Snoodle would hate you forever if he knew how much you like to munch on his dried apples when he’s not looking” Draco said and Harry smiled.
The group sat outside the Hospital Wing and did all they could right now: waited.
“Why?”
“I’m really sorry about all this, Draco” Cedric said. If it hadn’t been for him, all of this would have never happened.
“I don’t really see myself as business man so I think I’ll stick with Potions... or maybe Healing?”
He took it and filled it halfway through with galleons.
“To bed. It’s too early to be up” he said with a yawn. He wasn’t even cross anymore, he was just tired and wanted to sleep.
He took a deep breath and with slightly shaky hands he opened Harry’s letter.
“N-No he-he do-doesn’t. H-He likes b-bloody K-Kate” Harry wailed.
He closed his eyes and with a gentle wand movement he started chanting in his mind over and over various healing spells: he started with the damaged organs and flesh and then moved onto the torn blood vessels. Since he couldn’t do anything about Cedric’s broken bones without a potion he simply cast a powerful numbing charm on him to help deal with the pain. Even though he was pretty sure his friend was unconscious, better safe than sorry.
As Draco entered the Great Hall he could basically feel every person in the room staring at him as he sat down.
Lily glanced at her husband to check if he too had noticed Harry’s protectiveness towards Draco. Apparently he had as well.
Draco, feeling proud of himself, smiled and walked away, leaving a shocked Great Hall behind him.
He had a quick meal with Kate, Anthony, Michael and Terry who were adamant enough about keeping the conversation away from anything related to the task and to Draco’s health. He really appreciated this.
Lily raised her eyebrows.
Yours,
“Move aside! MOVE!” Cedric glanced up and saw Professor Snape make his way worriedly to his godson and try to shake him awake.
“Nobody found anything related to the Dark Arts, so the Malfoys are clear for that, however you did find a young boy bleeding in their Manor. We will have to see what they know about this, analyze the boy’s memories and decide whether they were the ones that did this to the child or if they are innocent. We already have the two of them in custody, fortunately they didn’t struggle, and are being interrogated by an auror at this very moment. James, please describe how you found the boy” Chief Horkins said.
“That’s why you’re special, Draco! You’re so much more! You’re funny and sweet and caring and... different from anyone I’ve ever known! I respect that you want to go alone, but I just want to help you get through this!” Harry said as he gently caressed Draco’s cheek with his hand.
“Well, there would be a trial and then they would be condemned to a sentence in Azkaban. The boy would have to be placed with a foster family until he is of age” Chief Horkins explained.
“How do you feel when you’re around him?”
“But if the Seeker catches the Snitch and basically wins the game for his team, doesn’t that make all the other players’ efforts totally useless?” Draco quietly asked as they left the shop with their purchases. Lily had to suppress a chuckle as she saw her husband freeze (he was probably having a stroke) and stare at Draco in disbelief.
“Better, yes I already have” he answered and James nodded.
Draco hesitantly hugged him back.
“I know it’s fine, I just-I-I’m not sure yet...” he muttered.
“Probably” Dean said as they changed the subject.
Blaise, who hadn’t been expecting such a reaction, gaped at his friend.
Suddenly Lily pulled out from her bag another package (this one was wrapped) and handed it to him.
Draco sat up now, his heart breaking at Harry’s confession. He never brought up his childhood or the war.
Draco grabbed his ass with his legs, pulling him forward, just before his cock had a chance to escape.
Still, Draco takes his time enjoying him. He uses mostly lips and tongue, so at the end, when he starts sucking, he’s rewarded with another spurt of salty sweet precum. He cums a second later. Harry’s hand is grasping his hair, his cock is shoved down his throat, his whole body quaking violently as curses spill from his lips.
“Scorpius!…Scorpius, where are you?!” He bellowed through the house, walking forward.
The thought brought bile to his throat. He was not able to stomach a lunch that day.
“It’s no bother. Stay safe,” he said in his professional voice. It was the mechanical answer that Harry gave all the aurors before they went out on a mission. It burned to hear. Harry was treating him just like everyone else.
“You feel so good inside, so tight. Did you spend all week waiting for me to fill you up?”
Draco slowly picked up his badge and did as requested.
“It was just a misunderstanding, that’s all. How long are you going to continue to freeze me out? I don’t know how much longer I can take this.”
Draco made a motion with his fingers for Potter to turn around, so he could get dressed.
Finally, Blaise held his head down onto his cock and paused as his orgasm hit,
as if there would never be a Christmas again.
They slept far apart, facing away from each other.
“Touch yourself.” Was that his voice?
“No, but a pretty bad bat bogey hex. Hit me square in the chest.”
“Do you seriously want to take this journey?
“Starting without me?”
Draco said silkily. He sat in the armless straight chair Draco reserved for guests. “Stand up.”
Draco rolled his eyes and resisted the urge to slap his palm to his face.
“You can’t be serious. You were going to let me sign this contract with Blaise still in the picture?” his voice rising to incredulous fury. The plates and glasses started shaking on the table, his accidental magic going haywire.
“Of course.”
Blaise comes up behind him, stroking his arms.
“Good.” He gave him a quick peck and smacked his bum, playfully. Harry startled and smiled, as Draco moved passed him to get to the bathroom.
The image of Draco in white robes standing across from him as they exchange vows flashes in his mind. Razor sharp because he’s imagined it so many times, thinking of everything down to the white peonies. If he can’t let go of Blaise, it will never come to fruition. Tears spring to his eyes when he thinks of the rings he’s already had commissioned for both of them, solid titanium with both the Malfoy and Peverell coat of arms engraved on the inside. He placed the order on Sunday, right after they returned from Paris. He told Draco he was going to check on the kids, which he did, and went straight to Diagon Alley afterwards to have them made before joining him for horseback riding…before the contract.
Harry allowed a soft smile, but it wasn’t enough. Draco could still sense a sadness in him. He dropped to his knees, locking eyes with him, and kissed the head of his cock, tenderly, as if it were the most precious thing on earth. He licked around the head and Harry moaned. He quickly put a hand over his mouth to stifle the sound.
The following week passed by in a hopeless haze of insomnia. Draco had one thing to look forward to, at least. Blaise agreed to meet a Dom named David that weekend after being begged by Draco at the Wizarding Country Club on Wednesday.
“Oh gods, Drake. You fuck me so good. Don’t stop.”
There was no use denying it, at this point. Draco would agree to anything, as long as Harry kept fucking him, like this.
He pushed Blaise against the wall and attacked his mouth. He felt the left over adrenaline from being on the skateboard surge through his body, and every kiss heightened it.
Blaise looked more beautiful than usual last night at the club, holding his firewhiskey loosely, his legs crossed as he sat in a grand brown leather chair. He was wearing a thin blue jumper, black trousers, and a black suede smoking jacket. His blue eyes sparkled as he took in Draco’s laughter. In his excitement, his raven tendrils would fall across his eyes when he was telling a particularly juicy part of a story, and he would brush them back. Draco wanted to grab those black locks with his own fingers and use them as leverage to shove his face down, onto his cock.
“Seems like my pet is just begging for a spanking. Makes it hard not to…”
Though he grated his nerves, he knew Harry better than all the others, besides perhaps Weasley. He knew every move he was going to make before he made it, having watched him so closely for most of his life. The difference between Draco and Weasley however, is that Draco was not afraid to check him when he was being a reckless Gryffindor idiot, and he was smart. He noticed things at the scene that the others did not, such as the magical forcefield from the day before. Weasley would have easily missed that.
“Auror Malfoy, as you know, it is technically against the DMLE’s policy to be involved with a superior without the ministry’s consent.”
Instead of flooing from the atrium, Harry directed them outside the back emergency exit where Harry’s flying motorcycle was parked, away from the crowds, a designated parking spot just for him. Why he insisted on flying to work on a hunk of metal, instead of just apparating, Draco could never understand.
In that moment, he’s sure down to his bones that Harry is dead. He is so sure, tears start filling his eyes, so he’s nearly blind as his body propels himself towards his bed.
Harry, it’s been two days and—“
Harry hadn’t put his quill down. “A bit.”
He kissed his back before spreading his ass apart to thrust inside.
He smacked his ass once.
“I don’t really know. I managed to stun all the wolves in one go. It must have hit you too. I called in more aurors to help. They should be here any minute.”
“I’m not leaving you with him.”
Draco’s heart broke a little more now. Had Blaise come at him with a shred of the anger he saw in his office earlier that day, he would have hexed the man into oblivion, on the spot, casting him out of his life forever.
“You know how much I hate that guy being around you. You’ve been acting up, for weeks. I’m sick and tired of this nonsense.”
Ever since he had started fucking him, his problems have been piling up. Now, he had lost everything, even his family. Draco blamed Harry for that too. If he hadn’t put Blaise in the hospital, he would have never come home early and discovered Astoria’s infidelity.
Draco winced. “I don’t doubt you, baby.” He confessed, stroking his hair. He demanded honesty and he had to give it back.
He was playing dirty. He knew nothing pleased him more than to tie Blaise up to the headboard, his body stretched taught, completely under his power. They had not done rope play in a while.
he was not going to let Harry scare him away from fulfilling his duties as an auror. For the last week, his work had suffered as a result of being caught up in their sexcapades. What a waste, he thought. It was all for nothing. He had lost everything for a few good fucks.
His eyes were vulnerable again. They always made him weak. Draco kissed him gently.
“I’m sorry Blaise. I can’t. I’m on a tight schedule. Scorpius is with his mom. I never get the weekends alone, and I have so much to get through today. Perhaps another time.”
“Too wild?”
It was Draco’s turn to flinch like he’d been hit by the kangaroo flogger. Harry couldn’t have realized how truly offensive that was. He had just insulted the very core of the Dom within him, in the worst way possible.
“Where’s my son?” His tone was low and dangerous.
“Check, please.”
“Are you trying to keep me away from your children?”
“I know.”
He would soon be gone from him, for two months, and Draco suspected the worst. He was going to lose him, for good.
“You make me feel like I can’t give you everything you need.”
Draco grins because—while they aren’t perfect like that—Harry’s really cute when he’s embarrassed.
Draco nodded into his shoulder, soaked through with tears.
Harry was buttering his toast, as if nothing had happened.
He looked around, but no one was paying them any mind, so he leaned close to Harry’s ear. Harry shuddered, knowing who it was, but he didn’t turn around.
“That’s not important. He means nothing to me, but you mean the world to me. I can’t lose you, darling.”
“Sorry,” Harry says. It’s more like a gasp.
He pulled out his wand and tried
He knows he’ll do anything for Draco. Anything he ever asks, no matter what it is. It’s like…he just can’t
When he looked up at the mirror again, he saw Harry standing right behind him, his naked chest dripping with sweat, still in his gym shorts.
Harry’s face morphed into confusion.
Harry turned his head away and got up to pour them both a firewhiskey. He handed a glass to Draco and sat back down on the couch.
The hostess led them to a table for two and Draco waited for Mr. Wolfe’s arrival. He appeared shortly after they sat down, with his own sub in tow. Harry’s face blanched as he took in the full glory of the owner’s sub, practically naked, his well-muscled torso well displayed. Nipple clamps were linked to his wide studded collar and to a leather belt buckled around his waist with chains. He wore a cock ring, also attached to the clamps with chains, and his erection looked purple and angry. As they strode forward, he saw the sub’s hands were cuffed behind his back as he followed behind Mr. Wolfe on a leash. When he caught sight of him from behind, he saw that he was impaled with a large butt plug. Weights swung between his legs and Harry realized with shock that they were attached somehow to his balls. He felt a little faint and decided that he didn’t want to know exactly
Completely sure, sir. I don’t break.”
Suddenly, Draco grabs the base of Harry’s cock and sinks down onto it, breaching his own entrance.
Draco drew back and brought the whip down with maximum strength. Blaise let out a quiet shriek.
Unprovoked? That had to be a sick joke. At the threat to his job, however, he began to calm down. He wouldn’t put it passed Harry to revoke his badge, and he was already on shaky ground with the DMLE. They noticed how Harry was treating him lately and blamed Draco for his foul mood. They weren’t wrong.
“I’ve been waiting to touch you all day and night. I need you.” He stroked his body with his large calloused hands everywhere and he immediately felt himself melting at the touch. His earlier thoughts, however, interrupted their flow.
Draoo starts off the bed to find him in the closet, then Harry strides out of it.
Draco should remove his belt and lash him until he screams. He should leave him with his pants down, ass marked red, and never look back. His Dom is screaming at him to punish him and leave him, but he can’t. He spanks his ass fours times in quick succession then brutally shoves his cock inside his hole. Grabbing hold onto Harry’s shoulders for leverage, he fucks him so fast and hard that Harry’s screaming. The wall is rattling loudly, and it sounds like war. He doesn’t care about Harry’s pleasure and doesn’t want him to enjoy it, in any case. The stable’s walls are shaking ominously and Draco thinks for a moment that the whole structure might collapse on top of them. It’s been standing since before his grandfather’s time, but he doesn’t care enough to stop. He reaches over to pinch one of Harry’s nipples through his shirt, twisting the nub painfully, earning a yelp.
_____________
Harry’s raw power was the stuff of legends. No one could match it,
“None of that was your fault,” he said with conviction.
Blaise was definitely not opposed to this rough treatment, giving it as good as he was getting it. He groped Draco all over, not getting nearly close enough to his blonde angel.
“Hey, don’t give me that look. You’ll never hear me complaining about being fucked over and over again. In fact, I was mostly delighted, until the very end.”
Harry’s heart catches in his throat.
Harry moved away, wincing as he slowly got to his feet with Draco’s help.
__________________________
Draco rolled his eyes, in response.
Draco stood up and started pacing. He had panicked and revealed his truth too soon. Now, he had to lay his heart bare in the middle of a fight. It could not have been a worse time. Harry would think it was false. There was a very high probability of rejection. He was angry that Harry had forced it out of him.
Harry sighed, releasing him and stepped back. Draco turned and kissed him before he could get away.
after only two weekends spent together, one month apart. He wasn’t like all the other miserable wretches that bowed and simpered for Harry because of his hero status. The very idea was insulting. This was the whole reason he never wanted to give into Harry in the first place.
“No. Go. You feel feverish. Too hot. Always. I’ll be alright in about fifteen minutes. I can take over.”
Draco stared into his pleading eyes like his was a loathsome insect. He pulled his arm away harshly, and sat back down.
Draco lets out a long breath. “That’s all I’m asking.”
Draco used his wand to cast the preparation charms and entered him swiftly. Blaise moaned. He bit Blaise’s shoulder as he thrust upwards.
“Don’t tell me what I’ll like! No, I don’t accept that. If I have to be trained, then so be it. If I could bring down bloody Voldemort, I’m pretty sure I can withstand a few months of your ‘training.’ I’m not afraid of you Draco.”
“Papa, I missed you too, but I can’t breathe!”
Harry suddenly started to panic, internally. Blaise was right. Draco thought their sex was boring, vanilla and ‘lovely.’ He would soon tire of it. He needed him to think their sex was dirty, raucous, and desperate.
and his would-be lover too, with his heart in his throat.
Where in the bloody hell did that come from?
“If you ever cared about Harry at all, you will go see him,” she said firmly.
Draco sighed in relief. He figured as much, but just needed to be assured. He could not help feeling a small sting, however, at Harry’s clarification.
Blaise pointed to a picture on the far left corner of the paper that Draco didn’t notice before. It was significantly smaller than the main picture. It showed Harry with Ginny at the park. They were laughing together. Ginny’s arms were wrapped around his shoulders. As they laughed,
but quickly bent forward, arching his back, so that his face pressed into the mattress and his ass was high in the air. He put his hands behind his back as if an invisible rope tied his wrists together, then spread his legs as wide as they could go, slightly squatting.
Harry noticed the “HP” in thin black lettering by the buckle. Draco was finally letting him in, letting him see. He blinked rapidly to clear his watering eyes. He needed to feel the pressure of the expensive leather around his neck.
“He-He can’t... He d-doesn’t-t l-like m-mme” Harry sobbed. Lily raised her head and looked at her husband, who simply shrugged.
Draco was left there, like an idiot, standing with his mouth slightly open. He sighed.
“I-I r-really want-ted to-to help C-Cedric but-but-“
“Thank you, Sir” he said quietly. He was feeling quite shy after seeing the teacher get so mad. He couldn’t even imagine how terrifying it would be to be on the receiving end of one of those sharp glares.
“Why would he do that? Didn’t Ron like Draco?” James asked. He didn’t want his son suffering more.
As they walked outside Cedric smirked at him knowingly.
A week had passed since his conversation with Ron and not a single word had come from Draco. No letters, no notes, no contact whatsoever.
Who knew how long Harry would have continued to lead him on if he hadn’t discovered this now.
Yes, folks, it’s finally here!
“Hi Harry!” Draco said and hugged his friend. Weirdly Harry stiffened a bit for a moment before relaxing. Draco thought nothing of it.
“Come, my boy, let us sit together!” Mr. Diggory said loudly and gripped Draco by the shoulder, steering him towards the first stand.
The healers has been forced to reduce his dosage in sleeping potions to prevent him from developing an addiction to them. Unfortunately though this meant nightmares and sleepless nights for Draco.
“Let’s hope everything goes well and my son wins” Mr. Diggory said as he watched his son with a proud expression.
“Don’t know”
Draco smiled and buried his head in the crook of Harry’s neck.
Spending time away from you has made me understand just how important you are to me, Draco, and I regret everything that I said and did that made you feel like I didn’t love you.
Cedric nodded.
‘Our* father’ Draco mentally corrected his wording slip up.
“You are the first student who has no interest about which house he is in” the Hat mused. His mind hadn’t yet registered the Hat had answered his thoughts.
He battled with it for hours, running through the maze as the high pitched shrieks of it followed him.
“This isn’t a test that you have to pass, Uncle Sev. Just... do what comes natural?” Draco said.
He sighed and sat up.
“Ok then. I’ll get started with the paperwork”
“There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be prepared, Ron” Hermione said and further distracted the group from Draco and Kate, who she noticed had shared some sort of secretive and complicit glance.
The Gryffindor, hoping it would help Draco wake up, had talked to him almost none stop about anything and everything; and when Draco finally woke up he wouldn’t leave his side and insisted on helping him recover as smoothly as possible.
Hermione rolled her eyes but smiled anyways.
“We did it!” Cedric said and hugged him while he thanked him. Draco smiled at him.
“That too” Harry said.
“Yes, I heard them because they were talking in the corridor and I was hidden in an alcove when-”
Was he Heterosexual? Homosexual? Bisexual?
“Sorry, mate” Dean said.
“Mhh... ticklish there... girlfriend” Draco murmured and Kate smiled.
He had ruined everything! And for what? A bad shag with a stranger!
Draco gave him a blank look.
————————————————————————————
“Where did you go to school before, Draco?” Hermione asked him.
“Whenever you’re ready, just walk in” the witch informed him as she left the room, allowing him some privacy.
“I’m gay” he whispered in her ear and pulled back.
He considered telling Cedric.
Professor Snape sighed and looked at Draco, who was still laying on the floor.
“Fine, I’ll ask him” Harry muttered and got up. Hermione stood as well.
“Like what?”
She looked up and met his eyes.
“Why? What’s wrong with being a Slytherin?” he asked. Harry had briefly hinted about his dislike for the house before but hadn’t really explained why. He knew about some people in that house being rude but that didn’t really mean anything did it? In his opinion bad people could come from anywhere...
His ‘parents’ were great and never pushed him while Harry fortunately hadn’t picked up he was eating a lot less than him for the first few days. Well, nothing lasts forever…
“Hiya Harry!” the huge man said in a weird accent
Draco didn’t answer and just lay coughing and panting on the floor. He was shaking from the cold.
“They beat him and starved him” he said quietly. He couldn’t even imagine someone hurting his Draco that way.
A few moments passed in silence.
“There, there, mate” Ron said as he patted his friend’s back, a hint of amusement on his face.
He took a deep breath as he prepared to knock on the Headmaster’s door.
Date? Joke?
“I heard your parents sued Barty Crouch” Kate said.
“Hi” Draco said in a low voice as he cleared his throat. He looked adorably embarrassed as the red tint to his cheeks highlighted his pale complexion and cheek bones.
He asked himself whether it was okay for him to like Harry. For all he knew, Harry was straight. Sure, he seemed fine with homosexuality, but would he react differently if Draco told him he had developed a minor crush on him?
“Are you still sure he’s ‘yours’? Unlike you I actually have the courage to take what I want” she taunted from behind him.
“Please?” he said and used his kicked puppy-eyes.
“So, have you met anyone here?” Terry asked him as he smeared a piece of meat with gravy.
————————————————————————————
In the end Healer Montary insisted that he stay at St. Mungo’s for another few hours, just to make sure he was healthy enough to go home with Lily Potter. Her husband, James, would be meeting them after work in front of the hospital. This didn’t mean he was completely cured, the healers has said that would take quite a while, but at least he was stable. He had to take a few potions everyday and had to go to St. Mungo’s for a checkup at least twice every week to make sure he didn’t suffer a relapse.
More tears descended on his cheeks. The cold around him was forgotten by his racing mind but not by his body: his fingers were cold and his nose and cheeks were colored a warm red.
As he gently gripped it he felt a surge of power going through his body and as he swished the wand towards the vase instantly the dying flowers in it regained their color and seemed to come back to life.
“Tell me anyway”
He knocked on the door and waited.
Draco shook his head.
“Whitewood, precisely 11 inches, rigid. Its core is White Moon Fish Fin”
“Hurts...” came the weak answer from the person laying in the bed. The voice was wracked with pain...
“I didn’t know: I found out by accident a few months ago. No one knows except for me,” he said.
Draco blushed.
“Wait! What about Draco! ! Will he be alright?” Harry asked, not even noticing he hadn’t even pretended to be worried about the Hufflepuff, as he followed the mediwitch down the short way that led from the maze to the Hogwarts corridors.
“Someone’s having a very good night” he said. Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t deny it.
“But-But why?” James asked in a childish manner and Lily internally rolled her eyes. She had seen her husband use the puppy-eyes to get what he wanted but this time she had a feeling Draco wasn’t going to be moved on this matter.
He couldn’t help but wonder though: ‘What about Harry?’
He swam until he found he was in some sort of kelp forest. In the distance he heard a voice singing beautifully. He recognized it as one of the voices from the egg, or at least one that sounded a lot like it.
“Then Graduation! Think about it Draco: this could be amazing!” she said.
And so Draco was forced to inform his friends both in Gryffindor and Ravenclaw about Nott, Crabbe and Goyle.
I would like to thank all those who read and followed this story and supported me while I was writing it. I really appreciate it!
“You know?”
“Oh... okay... thank you anyway” Kate said, a bit shocked by Harry’s curtness. She walked away.
“Quickly! We need to get him to St. Mungo’s as fast as possible!” James said as Sirius and him made their way to the Floo connection and flooed to the hospital.
As he got closer he gasped: his left arm (that was placed over the covers) was covered in blueish-greenish bruises. He hadn’t noticed them before. Injecting in his arm was a tube, probably for nutrition, and connected to his finger was a beeping machine that monitored his heart and blood pressure. He also had an oxygen mask on his mouth.
“What do you plan on doing after we graduate?” he asked, trying to start a conversation.
Draco had settled on a picnic blanket with his book and Snoodle sitting on his lap.
It was only during Dumbledore’s welcoming speech that Draco truly realized just how dangerous this tournament really was. He made a mental note to talk to Cedric and try to convince him not to compete.
“Good morning, Ma’am” he’d answered. He’d not been told how to properly address teachers (he suspected this lady was one).
Draco backed away slightly from him.
“He’s cute” Harry muttered and Draco internally sighed in relief.
Kate took off her shoes and laid down next to Draco, who immediately wrapped his arms around her. Kate placed a hand on his chest and rested her head on his shoulder as the two cuddled.
“I wanted to finish reading ‘Crime and Punishment’...” Draco said quietly.
“So what did you want to show me?” he asked and watched as Harry immediately smiled at him.
“Because I don’t. This little boy has already gone through enough pain and suffering to last him a lifetime. I want him to be happy, I want him to have a normal life with a loving family. I guess the idea of leaving him with total strangers doesn’t sit well with me...” James looked up at his wife’s face and found her eyes full of understanding.
Overall he really liked his new friend.
“You’re not disturbing us at all! We want you there with us, sweetie!” she said as she got up and then helped him stand up. She noticed he had gotten more comfortable with her and James touching him. Hopefully this was a good sign.
Lily looked at him horrified while James just lowered his head.
“Awww you two are so cute” Cedric said with a bright and slightly teasing smile.
“Oh come on! Anywhere!” Harry said.
“That’s enough, James. It’s Draco’s room and he can put whatever he wants in it” she said as she placed herself between James and Draco, forcing her husband to look at her in the eye. Recognizing a warning look when he saw one, James sighed, defeated, and nodded.
Part of him knew he had to talk to Harry eventually because they were living together but another didn’t want him to possibly get hurt again.
The tournament itself was only for students who were at least seventeen years old so at least Draco didn’t have to worry about any of his silly Gryffindor friends trying to enter the dangerous tournament. Instead he only had to worry about one friend: Cedric.
“Gentlemen, today we will be performing a raid on Malfoy Manor. We have reasons to believe the Malfoys are associated with the Death Eaters and are planning to “create” a new Dark Lord after Voldemort’s death thirteen years ago. I want you all to check out the house and restrain all it’s occupants. Examine only, do not destroy or take anything. Remember: the Malfoys are a very powerful family and should we trash their home but not find any proof of them being associated with the Death Eaters we could find ourselves in deep waters. Have I made myself clear?” Chief Auror Horkins instructed them.
In the living room he found Lily and James looking barely awake and an excited Harry who was petting Hedwig, who on the other hand was staring at Snoodle with a hungry glint in her eyes. Draco wrapped his arms around his baby bunny a little tighter.
“Mhhh... I don’t know. Draco hasn’t gotten out of bed all day and I don’t think anything I could do or say would make him change his mind...”
As they got home the four separated again and went up to their rooms to wrap the presents.
“Oops...” Nott laughed “Will you look at that boys? Finally Malfoy is where he belongs: on the floor beneath my feet” Nott then added when he saw Draco couldn’t get up because of his jinxed legs.
“It wasn’t so bad. When I was little my parents mostly had me do chores and when it got too much for me, they just locked me up in a cell: at least I had this to keep me company. I used to throw it against the wall and have it bounce back into my hand. That was how I passed most of my hours anyway...” he trailed off.
“Well, I asked Draco if he wanted to play in the snow with me but he went back to sleep...” he said with a small pout.
After her initial surprise, she hugged him back; when she heard him whisper “thank you” she had to hold back her tears of joy.
“Please just open the door, Ced” Draco said.
“Yes, I promised Kate I would show her around the castle”
When Draco didn’t answer or even open his curtains, the Ravenclaw sighed and simply placed his school satchel, which Harry had returned, on Draco’s desk and left the blond alone.
Thank you all!
Since it was June, the weather had gotten a lot warmer and he could be outside with Snoodle and Kate while they studied for his final exams.
What did she want to speak about? Was she here for Draco? Was she going to claim him?
Draco smiled in return.
“You know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back to my place” she said.
Draco rolled his eyes at his godfather’s formality.
“No, not really”
“Draco!”
The soft click of the door alerted him someone had entered the room: it was his wife, Lily.
“You should tell him” she said after a few minutes passed in silence.
“Like a vacation? Yeah! That could be great, Draco! So where are we going? Oh, we could go to Greece for a week! Or-or maybe-”
The blond’s core was thoroughly damaged and needed to heal on its own.
In the next few days Draco and Kate got to know each other better. Meanwhile Harry was busy trying to figure out a way to confess his feelings to Draco before it was too late.
“No, but he could be!” Lavender said.
He furrowed his brows and frowned but when his reflection in the mirror didn’t frown as well  he jumped slightly in shock.
“I’ll miss you all” Draco said as he hugged his parents and Godfather. He left Harry for last as he knew he would be the hardest to leave.
“Draco, unfortunately I cannot make this decision for you. However, I can say that you still have quite a bit of time left before you have to decide, so I suggest you keep your possible occupations in mind but also focus on actually enjoying your last year here at Hogwarts” Sev said as he patted Draco on the head. Draco didn’t say anything but quietly agreed with him. Maybe it was time to make a little change...
Draco nodded and slowly limped up to his room. A few minutes later for the first time he went to sleep warm and comfy in a soft bed.
“A house elf gave it to me when I was little because I didn’t have anything to do in the cell. When father found out he was punished for showing me kindness” he explained quietly when the adults just looked at him.
“Because that would be rude, Harry, and have you ever known Draco to be rude? Also, don’t you think that maybe Draco could like her?” Hermione said.
“Here. This belongs to you, mate” Ron said and handed Draco his white wand.
He didn’t mind: he often did that to Harry when he fell asleep on the sofa. What really scared him though was just how light his son really was. He could feel bones beneath his clothes...
Harry immediately sneered as he managed to calm down his blush slightly. He glanced back at Draco who seemed to be just as flustered as he was.
“Lets go to the furniture store before it gets too dark.” he said as the trio headed to the shop.
Draco nodded and started walking again at a slower pace and with his limp a lot more visible than it was before. As he walked he didn’t notice the sad expression Lily had as she held onto his small bony hand.
“Sooo what did the Hat say to you?” one of the boys asked.
Draco immediately recognized the voice.
Draco turned to the other two laughing Slytherins and stared at them.
As he went on with his studies he noticed he did find it a bit easier to master healing spells rather than others. He hadn’t given that a lot of thought before because he knew his wand was apt to healing magic but now he knew it also came from him.
As they apparated back Draco swayed on his feet and James had to physically hold him up to keep him from falling.
“Yes, well, what if he’s not gay?”
“Oh...” he simply said.
Witnesses say “they spent the entire night chatting, completely ignoring everyone and everything else. It was very sweet”.
“Am. I. Clear?” Professor Snape asked again to make a point.
As he went back to his room he stored his new ingredients in the potion cupboard and put away his other gifts except for the book Lily had gotten him, “Dracula”, which he placed on his nightstand. He would start reading it with Snoodle later that evening.
He definitely was dry; that was for sure.
He and Sev had gotten a lot closer and Draco found the seemingly gloomy man actually was quite kind at heart.
Draco looked at him with tired eyes and immediately noticed Harry was crying.
It couldn’t be. Draco could absolutely not be dead! They were both so young and their time together had only just began and he couldn’t imagine a world without his sassy blond in it.
“The others wanted to stay here with you as well but Madam Pomfrey wouldn’t allow it” he said.
“When they examined the body... she also kept a diary in which she wrote everything she did and thought” Kate said.
Potion Researcher and Developer Draco Malfoy has done it again!
He blushed shyly as the other Hufflepuffs congratulated him as well.
Draco had tried to find out why Professor Snape helped him but hadn’t found anything useful. The man was pretty secretive and intimidating. The latter proved to be a very helpful trait because Nott, Crabbe and Goyle had stopped bullying him.
Unfortunately I couldn’t, hence this letter.
“Because! We could have so much fun together!” Harry said.
Lavender and Terry were quite the gossips unfortunately. He knew they wouldn’t spread the information on purpose to hurt him but he knew the possibility of them letting it slip out accidentally was big.
He very quietly stepped closer and listened to the conversation that he recognized was between Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor Snape.
“I’m sure you would have been fine on your own” Draco said.
“Oh no, of course not, I wasn’t suggesting that. I was thinking you could release the cure to Spattergroit you’ve been working on. It is finished, right?”
Draco swallowed. “They’re very good”. Harry smiled widely at him.
“Oh Merlin, Harry! Are you alright?” Harry looked up and all of his anger and frustration instantly disappeared as he looked into Draco’s worried grey eyes.
Draco had tried talking him out of it but couldn’t do it, instead he decided to at least help Cedric: they revised and practiced together and Draco even modified the Disillusionment charm so that it would make not only Cedric but also all that he carried with him blend completely into the surrounding area. Basically he wouldn’t be invisible but simply his clothes and anything he would be carrying would take the exact same color and texture of the surrounding space; for example, if he was standing in front of a tree, he would ‘become’ an exact replica of the trunk.
By the sixth day, Draco was beginning to feel quite lonely as he hadn’t been able to see any of his friends and his girlfriend (it still felt a little odd to refer to Kate by that name) and even his godfather since he was admitted.
Draco hit him again.
This was his last year at Hogwarts before he would be out in the world.
“So your desk doesn’t get stained by-” she didn’t get to finish because he launched himself into her arms and hugged her.
“My family is british and we speak english at home” Kate said. Draco nodded and resumed eating.
“But without me?”
“Okay, well I may have spilled Snoodle’s treats on the floor a few weeks ago but I cleaned everything up and replaced them! I promise you I have done nothing to warrant your anger or disappointment towards me in the past few months” Harry said.
Draco was looking at him with timid eyes so Lily decided to step in. Her husband was quite passionate about Quidditch and didn’t realize not everyone shared his love for the sport.
“Sooooooo you two bow chicka bow wow?” he asked while making obscene movements with his hips.
Draco knew that was true for both of them.
As they left the candy store they stopped walking and Draco used this much needed break to breathe and rest a bit. He was already feeling quite tired and his joints ached.
As he quickly left the Library he started thinking about all the places where Draco could have gone and prayed he wasn’t in the Head Dorms as only the Head Students were allowed in there for the moment as Draco hadn’t yet told him the password (he had barely moved in there with all his stuff yesterday).
“And you can circle them- hey... where’s your broomstick?” Harry asked him as he looked around his room.
“As I’ve already explained: you’re not brothers! He is a foster child and that means he wasn’t adopted!” Hermione said not looking up from the book she was reading.
He felt everything going dark before him and he was about to pass out from blood loss and pain when a distant blue shine caught his unfocused eyes.
“We can talk about this another time. When you’re ready. In the meantime, don’t worry: I won’t tell anyone” Harry said as he hugged Draco.
“Yes, his name’s Harry and he’s your age. Right now he’s at Hogwarts but he’ll be coming home for the Christmas Holidays!”
“Unfortunately, first we have to find out what is causing this symptom before curing it. He’s been scheduled for an MRI scan in twenty minutes so hopefully we can see if he’s had any trauma in his head that we’ve missed. His chart did say he was hit in the head; do you know what object was used?” Healer Montary asked.
“I’ve no doubts about his talent, Sir, I’m mainly concerned about his health...” Draco trailed off and watched as the three champions entered the Maze and disappeared through the leaves, out of sight.
They both slightly blushed when their fingers brushed together sending electric jolts through their bodies.
Guilt and regret filled him as he couldn’t believe why in the first place had he been so arrogant to assume that Draco’s love for him was unconditional.
You’ve always put the blame on me whenever things didn’t go YOUR way. Mainly you’ve always blamed my work as a Potions Researcher and Developer as the reason why we constantly disagree.
“Hello, Draco”
Cedric would advise him on what to do.
He turned to his friend’s father and saw the curious look on his face.
He got closer to him and touched his face with his palm: Draco was ice cold. His blond hair was floating around his head.
Judging by their flushed faces both the adults knew exactly what had happened before they entered the room.
The smell of blood was pungent in the air as he slowly dragged himself to the box of medical supplies that had been thrown his way and started healing himself as best as he could without his wand. He looked at his body and couldn’t help but see the differences: he looked quite paler and skinnier with bruises and blood staining him all over.
“Sorry” he said in a normal tone.
As the feast began he still hadn’t actually registered what that entailed.
James looked at his wife worriedly when Draco didn’t say anything.
It looked like some sort of mutant crustacean eighty times bigger than normal crabs.
“Mr. Malfoy, could I please have a word?” Headmaster Dumbledore asked with a smile.
“Yes, but he loves me more “ Harry countered.
If only he knew...
To be fair the only little thing that was missing was Snoodle but honestly Harry couldn’t bring himself to care as he fell asleep with his love in his arms.
“No. You just sat there in total silence for a minute until the Hat sorted you. So, what did it say to you?”
They had told them everything they had ever done to the boy (whose name was Draco, by the way, and he was thirteen) and by the end of their confession everyone was disgusted with them: impossible chores and tasks, beatings for no reason, starving him. You name it.
The group was walking down the platform when a huge man came up to them.
Mr. Malfoy attended this evening the International Medical Conference for Magical and Non-Magical Diseases in London, where the best healers from all over the world came to hear the Potions Expert’s lecture on this new branch of medicine.
“I’m not sure yet... my father’s company deals with land ownerships and investments, so maybe I should become a business man?”
“I ought to bash in the head of the person who dared to do this to you... see how they like it... that bloody tosser...” Sev muttered.
He took a deep breath as she pushed them open and he took in the sight of the Great Hall for the first time.
The girl hadn’t been present to the last task because she had unfortunately come down with a bit of a cold and had preferred to stay inside instead of waiting outside for hours for the champions to arrive.
Draco’s panic instantly disappeared as Harry’s warm body pressed against his back, placing his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
“I promise you I’m nowhere near your mother’s friend. I’ve been recovering a lot lately and eating has become less of a burden. In fact, this is the second time I’ve tried becoming normal and so far I’ve been making a lot of progress!” Draco said cheerily.
As they emerged Draco gasped for breath and wiped away the water on his face with his hands.
He hadn’t given it much thought before when he would notice a hot guy’s butt.
“Astoria?”
Draco raised an eyebrow and shook his head.
“So, how old are you?” Kate asked him.
“How?” Sev asked him.
“They are quite disorganized. Dean and Seamus tell me I should check out Harry’s bed in Gryffindor Tower if I ever want to see a ‘proper mess’ as they called it” he said as he waved his wand and a set of socks levitated into their apposite drawer.
When you‘re at peace with yourself, you’ll notice you won’t feel like you have to bully others just to impress people who shouldn’t have meant anything to you in the first place”
Can we meet?
“So, you and Potter? What happened?” Astoria asked.
————————————————————————————
“Don’t apologize. You’ve been studying your ass off for the last few months. You’re allowed to get distracted by my amazingness ” Harry chuckled.
“Yes, you look perfectly healthy” Sev retorted sarcastically and Draco rolled his eyes.
“Yeah...they did. They were really mad about this”
He wasn’t good at dealing with admirers like Cedric...
“You can make a comment whenever you like. Just try not to be snide and hurtful. If you feel like I’m spending too much time at work, just say so. We can always talk about our problems, Harry”
It was sitting on a rock while it sang and made a necklace out of shells and kelp.
“Oh come on! Where’s THE smile I’ve been used to seeing every time I crack a joke?” Harry teased.
Snoodle liked him as well while Sev pretended he didn’t like the bunny but secretly snuck him treats when he thought Draco wasn’t looking.
“Are you ready?” Cedric asked.
“Draco. Of course, Cedric’s told me all about you, Draco. I want to thank you for helping my son: you’re the best friend he could possibly have in a time like this!” Mr. Diggory said and Draco blushed slightly.
“Oh, where are my manners! I’m Amos Diggory, Cedric’s father” Mr. Diggory said and offered him his hand to shake.
“Sure” Harry said in a low voice. Draco smiled.
Suddenly something hit him hard in the back of the head and the last thing he felt was a warm liquid running down his neck before everything went black.
“Sorry...” Draco mumbled.
“HARRY JAMES POTTER YOU GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE THIS INSTANT” Hermione’s enraged voice resounded through the apartment.
Sensing the atmosphere had changed, Draco tried to switch the attention to something else.
“I’d like to access the Malfoy vault” James said and the goblin looked at him and then at Draco with a piercing stare.
Ron simply shrugged and kept on shoveling food into his mouth.
Yes she had been mad at Harry for betraying Draco, but seeing how much he missed the blond, proved to her just how much Harry loved the Slytherin.
Draco didn’t say anything and simply hugged him a little bit tighter.
He felt the first two hot tears make their way down his cheeks.
I suggest you start acting like true friends or else you’ll be alone. And trust me, nobody wants to be alone in a world like this”
As he slowly went down the stairs he heard a voice he didn’t recognize say:
Elizabeth nodded in agreement, desperate for him to touch her even in the slightest.
Immediately their eyes softened as they smiled sadly at him.
As red sparks flew in the sky, James quickly entered the property and set out on checking the rooms for dark artifacts. After ten minutes he had only found one object that could he considered as a weapon: a tiny bottle of rat poison, which could harm even a human if ingested.
(Ah yes, he had started referring to his biological father as ‘Lucius’.
“I wouldn’t say that...” he muttered.
Life without Harry was a bit more dull however he managed to keep himself occupied with his studies. If he kept on with his current schedule he knew that by Easter he would have finished the Second Year’s Hogwarts Curriculum. That would leave him some months for him to start getting ahead with the Third Year’s one.
Although Draco would sorely miss the Hufflepuff, he was happy for him.
“Oh how I’ve missed you” he said as he stroked the soft black fur.
After a while touching wasn’t enough for him anymore as he began making his way down her body, kissing and licking, giving extra attention to her beasts and hard nipples.
He didn’t know for how long he was out this time when he woke up again.
When he didn’t say anything she went on.
he asked as he let her in the flat.
“I don’t really... uhm... I don’t...”
He couldn’t breathe.
Even if Voldemort was dead.
“When Lily told me I could have murdered Lucius and Narcissa with my bare hands”
“Please eat. You can’t leave me here all alone again. And what about Snoodle? What happens to him if you end up in a hospital bed? He won’t be able to come and visit you and I won’t as well because I’ll be at Hogwarts!” Harry sobbed as he pleaded with Draco.
“Oh, I’m not Harry’s best friend...” he said “I’m his boyfriend” he added and watched as Lucius’ face turned red.
As he stopped he turned and saw a door that led to an empty classroom was ajar and a small stream of light was peeking through it.
“This is where you’ll get your first broomstick, Draco” he said as he placed his right hand on his upper back while he pointed at the shop with his left.
‘Rennervate’ the professor said urgently.
She had just been healed when they brought Draco and Cedric in the Hospital Wing and had been like a leech ever since.
Cedric was standing there with a smile on his face.
“We‘ll leave you two alone for a moment” James said purposefully to embarrass the young couple. He turned to his wife but she wasn’t looking at him, she was looking at Harry, who seemed to be dying inside. He frowned slightly.
It was in the first week of January when his schedule was interrupted.
The raven-haired boy straightened his glasses and laid down next to Draco again, making sure to keep some distance between them.
He looked at Kate.
“Harry, I’m sure it’s not that bad yet. You still have time to-”
He had been the only person in St. Mungo’s who hadn’t been obliviated and knew of Draco’s abuse. James and Lily has asked this because they thought it was safer if someone at the hospital knew of Draco’s past and of his previous health conditions.
“If Harry were here he’d probably overwhelm Draco with his constant chattering about Quidditch moves and of how much he hates Theodore Nott”
“Of course you will; I trust you know what a date rape drug like Rohypnol can do so I’m suspecting that’s how it’ll happen. Either that or you’ll have me handcuffed to the bed” he grinned at the other man, playing along.
Dumbledore smiled.
He poured himself a glass of water and accidentally dropped it when he felt a presence behind him.
“Where is he?” he asked.
He smiled again and tried swimming.
“I don’t feel like doing anything else... look at them! Slow dancing, arms wrapped around one another. One would think they’re a couple!” a jealous Harry said as he watched Draco pull the brunette closer to his body.
“Of course, Mr. Potter. Rest assured we will do everything we can to help your son. The poor thing has gone through enough” Healer Montary said.
When left alone Draco and Kate exhaled and turned to look at each other.
Draco did follow Dr. Diriwn’s advice but found it very hard: he was full all the time and felt like he could throw up at any moment.
He watched as Cedric entered the arena and started battling his dragon: a Swedish Short-Snout. Cedric conjured a cloud of smoke (like Draco has advised him to do) to distract and confuse the Dragon as he went for the Golden Egg. Fortunately his strategy worked and as the dragon experts calmed the beast down and got it back into his cage, Cedric celebrated. People were wildly cheering and Draco was clapping as well.
His perfect pale face was marked by a cut just by his cheekbone and crimson blood was still pouring down from the side.
I really hope you’re awake so you can read this.
“Did something happen with you guys? Because we Ravenclaws sure as hell didn’t have anything to do with his current...mood”.
Harry stayed silent and nodded.
“What should I do after school?” Draco asked him. He had been thinking about his career options a lot lately and he couldn’t decide what he wanted to be. A Healer? A Potions Master? A Businessman? Something else?
Draco also got a small bookshelf for his books (it even had a cupboard so if he wanted to he could also store his cauldron and potion ingredients inside it).
I’m so sorry we didn’t get to say a proper goodbye and I feel so guilty, but I swear if I could’ve stayed by your side I would have.
Inside Draco purchased the potion he was looking for.
He tuned them all out and focused all of his magic, as much as he could muster. Slowly he felt the world start to spin around him as he internally chanted the required incantation; his hands shook, he felt weak, his mind soared but it didn’t matter. As the adrenaline pumped through him he opened his eyes and saw everything was going black around him.
Everything was in its proper place and nothing could ever take that away from him.
“That was... amazing” Harry said as he regained his breath.
“Mhh... I think you know what I mean”
“I thought he would have fun...” he said as he bowed his head. He suddenly felt ashamed.
“But-But he’s with K-Kate now...” Harry said as he finally stopped crying and wiped away his tears with the sleeve of his shirt.
Draco moved his lips but no sound came out.
James sighed and nodded as he and his wife left via apparation.
It was hard to speak of what his parents did to him and he generally preferred to avoid this type of conversations.
Because I know somewhere in you there’s a part that isn’t a bully, a part that doesn’t enjoy hurting people. You just have to let it show.
“I’ll be right back” he said and before he left he leaned in and placed a gentle kiss on her cheek. She blushed and smiled.
“Draco! There you are!” someone called from behind them, ruining the moment.
“I’m not really sure... I think so? I mean - Kate and I used to hold hands so...”
Kate had been happy as well when she heard what he did and showed how proud she was by giving him a long and passionate kiss which was only interrupted by the bell ringing, signifying it was time for Artimancy class.
“...and kinda quiet too. He really doesn’t talk that much does he?” James said.
James watched and got closer to the two.
They had sat in one of the front rows where they could clearly see the dark water.
He choked on a sob when he instantly recognized Draco’s hair and his signet ring.
In one hour Lily and James even discovered an unexpected thing: Draco’s favorite color was mint green. An important bit of information to save for later.
The next shop they went to was Rosa Lee Teabag (a tea shop) where Draco bought some of Lily and James’ favorite Christmas tea flavor which only came out at Christmas.
“Anytime you feel like eating, no matter the time, you do so. I’m also prescribing some vitamin pills to balance out your vitamin levels. You are to take one of these pills right before dinner and before every complete meal you have” Dr. Dirwin said as she handed him a glass container with white pills in it.
“Are you sure you’re on the same level as everyone?” Hermione asked him with suspicion.
“You know what? I-I can’t even be in the same room as you” Hermione said as she and her husband Flooed out of Harry’s apartment.
“Yes, you are, Draco. You’re so thin and I’m mentally hitting myself right now for not realizing what you were going through earlier! From now on I’m going to make sure you see just how handsome and skinny you are” Kate said determinedly.
“I’m not sure where my parents put them... They usually had someone hand me some clothes every other day so I don’t know where they kept them”
I’m warning you now: this is your last chance.
Apparently the Slytherin cock-blocker knew that as well and made sure she kept Draco busy all day every day.
I also wanted to clarify what happened the week after we... with my one night stand.
“Why-Why?! Do you find him cute!?” he said as he started breathing fast.
Cedric furrowed his brows a little and handed him a handkerchief.
Harry had asked about his constant stomach aches so Draco had asked if Lily could explain while he went to rest a bit because his head was spinning.
If Harry found out that Draco had basically moved on...
Groaning he slowly sat up in bed and looked around with blurry eyes.
The ride home on the Hogwarts Express was fun and Draco really had some time to focus on Snoodle, who had grown a bit. With his final exams he had been concentrating on his studies and less on his pet so he decided to make it up to him by playing with little bursts of light (which he knew Snoodle enjoyed).
“Me too” Dean and Seamus said at the same time. They looked at each other and grinned.
Luckily a little bit of his stuff remained in them so he quickly took a hot shower, got into his pajamas and crawled into bed, ignoring his friends’ worried glances and questions.
By now Draco was exhausted and was struggling to keep his eyes open while trying to place a foot in front of the other. James and Lily noticed this and shared a look. What they didn’t know was that Draco was also in considerable pain... the effects of his healing potions were probably starting to go away so he would have to take them again later that evening.
I get it. You have a lot of pressure on your shoulders, having to live up to people’s expectations and all that. This, however, doesn’t give you the right to mercilessly bully other people, because in the end it just makes you more unhappy.
As he neared the voice Mr. Ollivander’s voice stopped him.
In the end Healer Montary discharged him with a bright smile a week after he had gotten surgery (in total he spent about nine days at the hospital, he didn’t really know). He did however advise him to take it easy for a few more weeks and prescribed him to take a dose of painkillers two times a day for the first week.
“I’ll get them!” Draco said before she could even move and bent down to the floor to pick them up. He missed the sly smile Elizabeth had as she quickly cast a spell that copied down his class schedule on a piece of her parchment. She swiftly placed it in her bag and sat there, looking innocent, as Draco handed her the ball plans with a small smile on his face.
“What did you do?” Draco asked his friend.
‘No’ Draco thought.
He nodded and took a deep breath to calm down his nerves a little bit.
During this months he divided his time between his studies, Snoodle, Harry, Cedric and his other friends.
“Sure! I know it can be difficult to find your way around here. I kept on getting lost” he said. She smiled.
“Then what do you feel when it’s not dinner time?” she asked him.
He was a little bit hungry at the moment so he quietly served some stew in a bowl and on his plate a little Cornish Pastie with some mashed potatoes on the side.
“I’d be delighted to”
“You’re not asking, I’m offering. Besides, I like helping you and finding out more information!” Draco said.
“Draco, you offend me! You don’t think I can do it only with my extraordinary charming self?”
