"It's Hermione, mate," said Ron. "I've never been able to work out how she knows what she does, but I love it. Anyway, I was so convinced that she was wrong about this that we argued for ages, and we ended up having a bet. I bet her ten galleons you weren't gay, and another ten galleons that even if you were gay there's no way you'd ever get together with Malfoy. Should've known, when I paid her the first ten galleons, that the second ten would follow eventually."
Luna smiled. "Well, I'm even more intrigued now," she said. "Any clues? I promise not to tell anyone."
She was the spitting image of Ginny, of course, which gave him a momentary pang, so he concentrated on her body language and the expression on her face, rather than the face itself. She definitely looked happy. As Harry watched, she leaned forward and whispered something in Hugo's ear, her eyes dancing, and he threw back his head and laughed, before standing up and waiting until Lily did too. The two of them left the common room, heading out of the dungeon, and Harry considered following them until he remembered that there was a good chance Albus would be here somewhere.
"Oh, it is," said Draco. "It's pretty long – lasts for a couple of hours – and choirs and orchestras love doing it. But the solo parts are amazing, and Gerontius himself is a tenor. His part is
"These amulets are very popular in Italy," Draco told him. "People wear them to ward off the evil eye. It’s mostly just a tradition these days – I’m not sure how many of them really believe in it – but I saw this on a stall today at one of the Christmas markets, and I thought of you. It’s a bit of a silly idea, really. I won’t be offended if you don’t want to wear it." He seemed suddenly flustered.
Harry thought about it. "Erm... since breakfast, let's see... no, wait. I missed breakfast. I was sorting stuff out for while I was gone. So I've had... erm, a tub of churros from a stand in the park, half an hour ago."
dream," Harry pointed out. "I never expected it either, but I'm very much enjoying it. You were right – you're very different to the boy I used to know."
Draco looked at him quizzically. Harry took his arm and pointed to the doorway of the living room, where a sprig of mistletoe was hanging. Draco grinned and led the way to it.
he'd also seen Scorpius raise his eyebrows at Draco's use of Harry's first name, but the movement had only lasted for a split second, so it could have been just a twitch.
Draco smiled. "I wondered whether or not you were aware of that," he said. "Scorpius told me about it. I'm glad you
"... It's not the same as being alone with Harry," finished Ron. "It's OK, I get it. I doubt Hermione would have cried as much if you two had been there rather than just me."
," said Harry, blushing, "please can you show us where we're sitting? I want to tell Hermione about the music before it starts."
"Don't worry, I can guess what you want to ask," said Scorpius. He switched his spoon to his left hand so that he could eat while scribbling a note. Draco was about to reprimand him for these appalling table manners, but then he remembered that he did want to get back to the castle as soon as possible, and started to speed up his own tiramisu consumption. He'd just cleared his plate when Scorpius handed him the note.
Really short because I had a situation tonight that only left me with ten minutes to update... but the next part will follow within an hour, I promise!
do any of them – or any other real curse, for that matter – because not many people can do wandless magic, can they? But I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t check anyway. Are you in a hurry? I can do it now if you’re not."
Harry thought for a moment. "Scar," he suggested. "Neither of us likes to talk about our scars, but no one
"I know exactly what you mean," Draco reassured him. "I think it must happen a lot to single people – it certainly does to me. When I'm with a couple – any couple – they always seem to talk about things they do together, and I'm really just an audience member that asks questions from time to time. And If I mention anything I've done, they seem to soon find a way to connect that to their own lives, and then it all starts again. ... That sounds awful, doesn't it? I hadn't really thought about it until just now. It's not that I think they do it on purpose – I think they'd probably be horrified to realise what they're doing. But it still makes it hard to have a meaningful conversation with a couple."
"Pretty early," said Draco. "About four o’clock. But the sky will be pretty for a while after that, if you can’t come till later."
"No," said Draco. "He's a good man, as I said, and he hasn't given me a hard time, but he's also not really shown any interest in my life outside work. To be fair, I think he's like that with everyone, though – he's just a bit self-centred."
"What happened?" asked Harry, as Draco slumped down beside him on the sofa. Draco rested the back of his head on the sofa and stared into mid-air.
Harry grinned, feeling his grouchy mood lift somewhat. "Brilliant," he said. "I’ll make sure I’m back in time for that, then. I just popped in to say hello – I need to get back to the office  for a meeting."
"Right thigh," said Draco, kneeling on the floor in front of Harry. Harry's cock, which had been gradually regaining interest in proceedings since the start of the measuring, instantly stood fully to attention when it realised how close it now was to Draco's face. "Left thigh. Right knee... left knee... right outside leg... left outside leg. Hips... hmm, I'm not sure whether to measure under or over your cock. It wouldn't normally be up there when this measurement's being taken, so I think I'd better measure under it... but then your trousers might not fit you when you're excited..."
making up a story to get me to come with you, I suspect you'd come up with a more likely-sounding one than this. So let's assume you
to call a press conference I've usually been persuaded to do it by Hermione, so I've let her do it. But this is different - you'll see."
Potter gently lifted her uninjured right hand. "I'm here, Hermione," he whispered. "We'll get you sorted out, don't worry."
"I didn't actually see it happen – I arrived while the paramedics were treating her," Draco explained. "But that's what they were saying."
Lucius stood up and went to the oven to retrieve the apple crumble dish. "We could give him those sweets too, Narcissa," he called. "Can you get them? They're at the back of the cupboard."
Harry raised his eyebrows. "Has she really? That's interesting. And makes me feel a bit better, actually."
as keen as you, so please stop apologising for the raincheck. If you'll recall, one of the main things we've been talking about recently is how tired you are and what we can do about it, so I'm pleased that you were comfortable enough to say so that night."
“I’d quite like to see what it looks like these days,” Draco mused. “I haven’t been there since I was a small child. OK, what time?”
Malfoy smiled. "Fair enough," he said. "Short version: I'm trying to memorise the tenor part to four choruses from Handel's Messiah. I'm singing it in a concert tonight, and I was only asked to do so this morning, but the choir are doing four of the choruses from memory and I don't want to spoil things by being the only singer looking at his score."
“I have so many questions right now, but they can wait,” said Rabia. “Just one, though, and I think I know the answer but I have to ask: your voice…?”
Draco jumped up and stood in his way, and then somehow Harry's wand was at his throat before he'd even noticed Harry reach for it. Draco held up his hands in submission. "I can't stop you if you really want to do that, of course," he said, striving to keep his voice steady and calming. "But please can I ask you to wait a few minutes so that we can discuss the consequences?"
"Well, you're very wrong about one thing, at least," said Harry. "The end result will not be the same. Maybe it will for your parents – although I'm not going to accept that until the Healer's seen them – but they're not the only ones involved. What about you? It will make a difference to your quality of life if you get some help. I feel terrible that you've been carrying this burden all on your own, and no-one at work had any idea. Wait, does Chris know?"
The initially scattered applause soon spread, until the whole hall was clapping by the time Harry and Draco reached the staff table. Harry wasn't quite sure why they were clapping, and said so to Draco as they sat down.
"Huh, I always vaguely assumed you had loads of girlfriends," said Draco. "So who was the one you kissed?"
"That elf is going on my hugging list," said Ron, as he attempted to shove a whole sandwich into his mouth in one go.
"Wow," she said, staring at them. "Wait till Ron sees you! You both look amazing, but even more so together! Come in, come in. Draco, welcome to our home. We're so pleased Harry wanted to bring you."
"Why three?" asked Harry. "Oh, wait, I know. Good call. I like the idea of us all pulling a cracker with everyone. I'm doing Draco first though, if that's OK."
For the next couple of hours, they lay there contentedly counting and discussing meteors, occasionally swapping places to avoid limbs going numb. In between meteors, they tried to persuade each other of the existence of new constellations.
"Well, you didn't," Draco told him. "But it's OK. It's partly my fault, anyway. I've got so used to keeping everything to myself that I'm not very good at voicing my feelings. I'll try to get better."
"No, I really want to," Harry told him. "I'll definitely be there. This kitchen is impressively equipped, by the way. I take it you don't have any house-elves? And why are you here rather than in the Manor?"
"Not till the stalkers have got bored," said Harry. "Sorry – I just think it would be a nightmare if I tried to go shopping at the moment."
cook for myself, if anything went wrong I'd summon a house-elf to help fix it. But after a month or so I was able to feed myself with no help. It was amazingly satisfying, actually."
"Will you allow me to stay here? Ideally for the full two weeks – because, as I mentioned, I need the money – but at least until you're feeling well enough to resume your lessons."
, actually – it was definitely the news headline of the day. I was in France at the time, of course, but I got quite a few owls saying 'did you hear about Potter's childhood?' If it's any consolation, though, no-one was gloating. Most people were feeling really guilty. There were so many of us who'd grown up assuming you were worshipped by your family and friends, so it was a huge shock to discover that your family had abused you and that you
Harry smiled. "Two reasons, again," he said. "The first is that I asked about that wording when I became an Auror – not about your specific case, I mean, but about legal wording in general – and I made enough of a fuss that they changed it, so that now it does say 'person' and 'people' rather than 'witch or wizard'."
James smiled. "Why wouldn't I be?" he said. "I've only ever wanted you to be happy, and you look happier right now than I've ever seen you. If it's Professor Malfoy who's caused that, I'm all for it."
"Anyway," said Harry, "to the problem at hand. I'm glad you're enjoying tonight – I am too. And, I have a suggestion. Why don't we bring our bedding outside? I've never actually slept under the stars, and now that I've thought of it I really want to."
? You always look like a model, but I think you might have people creaming their knickers when they see you in all black."
sore by now," he said lightly. "You managed to restrain yourself while you were at Weasley's, I hope?"
(He had taken a liking to that particular brand of handwash and had bought some for the bathroom at work.)
Draco looked at him, surprised, but Harry was striding along the pavement with his hands in his pockets, very carefully not looking in Draco's direction. Draco, at a loss for words, opted for matching Harry's pace and striding along beside him in silence. After a minute, though, he started to hum cheerfully.
"I do," said Draco, grinning. "I'd assumed this was the case, but hadn't realised it'd be quite this bad."
Hermione and Ron grinned at Harry and set off. Draco turned to give Harry an unexpected wink before following them. Harry was left alone at the table, all too aware of the fluttering feeling he seemed to keep getting in his chest whenever Draco looked at him.
Draco appeared to be lost for words, so Harry squeezed his hand and said to her, "Just do anything you can that will help Draco care for his parents. That's all we ask."
lovely, though, so thank you. I haven't skated since I was a child. We used to go to the Somerset House rink every Christmas, but then there was... well, you know, and we stopped doing things like that."
part of your body," Ron pointed out, when Harry said so. "It's much worse on bare skin. Now, listen, I know Ginny did something incredibly stupid, and it's definitely put her off ever getting that drunk again, but... well, she's still my sister. And she honestly didn't mean to hurt you. Please will you be kind to her?"
Harry’s eyes shot open, but he relaxed as he saw Draco’s grin. "Maybe I wouldn’t mind," he found himself murmuring. The last thing he saw before he closed his eyes again was the expression of surprise on Draco’s face.
He linked arms with Hermione and Harry, and within seconds the six of them were striding along Diagon Alley towards the Leaky Cauldron in a "Follow the Yellow Brick Road"-type formation, giggling like school children.
I see that everyone is describing this prompt as "plum pudding", but it would always be called Christmas pudding here in the UK.
"Free of charge! Happy Christmas from the United States Embassy!" He held out the tray, and Harry and Draco both took a candy cane.
"Good idea," said Draco, and did one final wriggle before detaching himself and crawling into the sleeping bag.
"Well, I'd love to do it again one day, and I hope I get the chance," Draco said. "But that night was one of the best nights of my life, and afterwards I went to the pub with a load of the other singers from my year, and we ended up doing karaoke."
"Well, I'm not sure how much you remember about my trial after the war – thank you again for speaking up for Mother and me, by the way."
"I'm more likely to have shrunk, given that we were starving for most of the time we were on the run," said Harry. "But that was before I spent the summer being fattened up again by Mrs Weasley, so who knows? Yes, by all means measure me. Have you actually got a tape measure?"
"We can't have that, can we?" said Draco. "We'd better rectify the inequality immediately. If you want to, that is."
"I did think about getting an office when I first started, but I don’t really need one. And actually I don’t often have clients here in any case. But sometimes it’s more convenient for them to come to me. Like now, for example. I… have to admit I felt more comfortable meeting you on my own turf."
"It's a really difficult charm," Harry reminded him. "Lots of people can't do one, even people with happier memories than yours probably were."
Ron grinned at them all. “I’m just feeling smug for having the best mum in the world,” he announced.
"Sadly, I don't trust myself not to get carried away if I do this properly right now," he said. "But I always think it's good to leave people wanting more, don't you?" He took hold of Harry's head with both hands, and kissed him firmly but briefly on the lips, before Apparating away.
Harry laughed. "That's just freaky," he said. A hurt look crossed Draco's face, and Harry hastened to reassure him. "No, not
"I looked it up online, and the TfL website said I should go via West Croydon and Canada Water to Waterloo," said the customer, an earnest young businesswoman. "But that seems like a really long way round. Which way would
. I didn't realise it till this week, but I think it's been in the back of my mind for a while. But I wouldn't have dared say anything, because I never dreamed you might think of me that way."
"I don't need to – they're all real, and there's still loads to go," said Draco, moving in front of Harry again. "Trouser waist... jacket waist... front jacket length... front chest width... full chest. Sorry."
"There was an alleyway near the British Library that might do the trick," Harry remembered. "But, listen – why don't you come back to mine? To sleep, just to be clear. Seems like it'd be easier."
at keeping secrets, especially if Harry Potter is asking," said Winky. "What is Harry Potter wanting Winky to do?"
fourteen years ago, though, Draco," Harry pointed out. "I really don't think it'll be as bad as you expect. Especially if you're with
That afternoon, they were just finishing lunch when an elf appeared to announce that Hermione was in the entrance hall. Since the post-meal song hadn't yet happened, they asked the elf to bring her to the ballroom.
"That explains why I haven’t seen him," mused Harry. "So you’re in touch with him? You’ve never mentioned him."
"Well, it works, however you've done it," said Rabia. "Now, I'd love to sit and chat, but I've got a euphonium player coming for a run-through in a minute, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to throw you out. Harry, I’ll see you on Friday – please make sure you sit near the front so that Draco sings like he did today. Draco, I’ll catch up with you tomorrow, yeah? I’m going to want to talk ALL about Harry now I can put a face to the name.”
"Sorry, couldn’t resist," said Draco, his eyes twinkling. "OK. I think that if it’s a Muggle curse, it won’t have any effect, so you needn’t worry. If it’s a wizard curse, it’s not one I’ve ever encountered, so I’d have to do a bit of research to establish what it does and how to remove it. In the meantime, you just need to be vigilant. Keep a record of anything out of the ordinary that happens to you, however minor it may seem, and let me know ASAP. I’ll keep in touch with you in any case, though."
Potter let out the breath he'd been holding. "Um... Alright. I suppose so. For a day or two, at least, and we'll see how it goes. But you'll have to have the bed, and I'll have the sofa. I don't think I'll be able to sleep anyway, so it makes more sense for you to have the bed."
before I tried anything more complicated. Then I saw an advert at the station over the road, for a ticket sales assistant. I'd already been looking through the job listings in the
Harry considered this. "You know, that actually makes a lot of sense," he said. "It took me a while to learn all the kids' names last year – at least this year it's just the first-years I don't know. The control thing is less of an issue – I feel a bit guilty, actually, because all the kids behave for me, and I know it's not because I'm a brilliant teacher. Something to do with being
"So," said Draco tentatively, when the plate was empty and Harry had gulped down a glass of water, "as I understand it, your wife is attending the Quidditch England selection camp as a reporter, and you planned to go along and surprise her. I take it things didn't go according to plan?"

"It's Saturday morning," said Draco. "I'll be here for the next two weeks. Surely there's something more interesting that you'd usually be doing?"

beautiful," Harry breathed. He tentatively reached out a hand to stroke her, and a moment later she started to purr.
He gave them both a quick hug and strode quickly towards the door. As he opened it, the freezing air outside stunned him for a second, so he was still a little bleary-eyed when someone ran up to him and shouted "SIA MALEDETTO!"
"That's not what you were saying in bed last night, when you seemed to be rather enjoying removing the stickiness from my body with your tongue," Draco pointed out, as he went over to the sink.

"Well, it sounds like good riddance, but I’m sorry you were hurt in the process. How long were you with him?"
"We're not here to..." began Granger, but Weasley touched her arm; she looked at him and stopped speaking, then looked back at Draco and smiled reassuringly.
"I know you're trying to look away, Weasley," said Draco, "and, believe me, I'm sure I would be too if our positions were reversed. But I just wanted to point out that, as you'll see from my erection, the attraction here is by no means one-sided. I didn't know until very recently that Harry had ever been interested in me, but I can promise you that I've been having what you'd probably call inappropriate thoughts about him for many years. Yes, including when we were at school, although I would never have admitted it at the time."
The Barcelona staff member talked nonstop as they walked, switching frequently between Spanish and English; Harry's contribution to the conversation consisted entirely of hums and polite exclamations. Nevertheless, he was relieved when she led him into an office in which Oliver Wood was waiting for them.
it, so I had a hair transplant. I feel a bit of a fraud, but I'd rather that than have no hair. Shallow, aren't I?"
"Until tonight, you've always called him Malfoy, same as us. But tonight, since you saw him, you've been calling him Draco, and you haven't even noticed."
Draco leaned back on the sofa and gesticulated with his candy cane. "OK, so you've been partnerless since the end of July... what? Everyone knows when your birthday is!"
Harry gave them each a one-armed hug, and McGonagall beamed at them all. "Now, the start-of-term banquet is still a couple of hours away, and I'm sure Mr Weasley, at least, would welcome a snack," she said, at which Ron grinned unashamedly. "Why don't the three of you go and wait in the Great Hall, and I'll get one of the elves to bring you something to keep you going? We won't be able to sort out rooms until all the eighth-years are here and we can agree on the pairings, so you'll have to be patient."
"I like it here," said Harry, after they'd stood in silence in the darkness for a couple of minutes. "I think I'd like to live somewhere like this."
"This actually makes sense now," he said, shaking his head. "I used to think you seemed a bit dim when we were at school, but after quite a long time I realised that you were actually very intelligent, you were just not always great at noticing things."
Harry's aching back was what woke him on Sunday morning. Despite his insistence that the sofa would be perfectly comfortable, he decided that he was far too old to sleep anywhere other than a proper bed. Groaning slightly, he reached out for his glasses, which he'd left on the coffee table.
Harry took a deep breath. "Erm... Well... I've been thinking about... you know, sex. Erm, proper sex.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, still looking bothered, but Draco cut him off. "I will tell you everything you want to know, I promise," he said. "But the food will be better if we eat it promptly. And I haven't introduced you to Kilgharrah."
"Probably not," said Ron. "At least, not at first. But I do think they'll get over it as soon as they see how happy Harry is with you. Everybody
"You did all that you could, and considerably more than I had expected you to," Mr Ollivander assured him. "And I always thought it quite fitting that it was your wand that ended the war. Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. I never heard what became of it, though; did you ever get it back?"
Draco smiled slowly. "That's... interesting. I may return to that thought later," he said. "But let me see how briefly I can sum up my current situation first."

Harry's cock twitched visibly at that statement, but he nodded, and Draco grinned. "Sorry," he said. "I can see you're mortified, and I'm really not trying to make things worse. Can I just ask... and please forgive me if I'm totally wrong... is that because of me?" He brushed the side of Harry's cock – only the most fleeting of touches, but it was enough to make Harry shudder from head to toe.
Draco couldn't see Harry's face in the darkness, but he could just about tell when Harry turned his head to look at him. "I really did need some fresh air – I felt quite light-headed," said Harry. "But also I thought it might be nice for your parents to talk to Teddy on their own."
Molly beamed. “You are very welcome,” she said. “I’m just glad it worked. As I said, the human voice is one of the most delicate parts of the body - if you weren’t a singer, I could have healed you more quickly, but I couldn’t have guaranteed that your voice wouldn’t be changed. The spells I used were slower but safer.”
His assistant nodded as she placed a tray of coffee and biscuits on the desk, before leaving the room again and closing the door behind her.
Five minutes later, though, Harry found himself back in the garden behind Draco Malfoy's house, freshly Disillusioned and peering through the French windows. He hadn't worked out anything at all, other than that he wanted to see Draco again and find out what was going on. He was relieved to see that Draco was back in his armchair, surrounded by candles; this time he was just reading, but with the cat again sprawled across his chest.
"Oh, I've heard of that!" exclaimed Harry. "It's on at that theatre in the West End, isn't it? You know the one I mean. There's a big sign outside."
"I've often wondered," said Scorpius. "I've even done some research, but I'm none the wiser. I don't think there's enough evidence to say either way. Maybe I'll ask my dad while he's here. He knows
They arrived in the living room of Draco's flat in Wallington. Ron and Hermione immediately went to the window to look at the view of the city, and Draco stayed with them, pointing out landmarks. Harry went into the kitchen to make coffee, but he returned a few seconds later.
Draco burst out laughing. "Is that your best line, Potter? I'd've thought even you might be a bit more suave than that."
"I know that," said Harry. "But 'as good as' isn't good enough. I want the proper ceremony. I want to show people that I'm
Harry did so. "How about a glass of mulled wine?" he suggested, as Draco started removing items of clothing. "Might be nice to sip it and do a bit of stargazing while we get our breath back for round 2. It's in that flask in the big bag."
"Not only have I never seen you in a suit, I've never seen you with your hair any different," said Draco eventually. "I'm impressed. Did you do it yourself, or have you actually been out and had it done?"
"You do look amazing, though," commented Draco, sweeping in and kissing him. "In fact, I think I need to do something for you. Sorry, Ron."

"Harry asked if I could wear green if possible, actually," Rabia confided. "He didn't explain why, just that you'd like it. And I've been wanting an excuse to buy a new dress, so how could I refuse? Although, I doubt anyone'll be looking at me. Have you seen
"What did she say?" asked Draco. Harry reached forward and took the note off the coffee table, handing it to him.
(if only partially) made Draco suddenly determined to find out what had got Potter into such a state. If he ended up actually
After a minute or so, Draco raised his head and then bowed deeply. He then went over to the piano and took Rabia's hand, leading her to the front with him so that they could bow together. The whole audience was on its feet by this point, and they bowed repeatedly for several minutes until Harry stood and held up his hands.
They arrived to find Hermione's bed empty, but Ron was asleep in the chair beside it. Harry put his hand out to shake him, but then hesitated. "I think I'll leave him to get some sleep while he can," he said. "He can't have got much last night."
"Nonsense," said Narcissa. "You're on holiday. And we've already had our first breakfast. Let's call this brunch."
By eight o'clock that evening, the table at the Malfoys' house was covered in empty plates and dishes.
"I think I was a bit shy about them. Seamus made a few comments when they started to get really big, but he stopped when he saw how uncomfortable it made me - I always tried not to draw attention to them after that, though. But I'm glad you like them." Harry reached down and started stroking Draco's balls thoughtfully. "I still like yours better, though. They're just more... stylish, I suppose. Like everything about you."
Draco felt himself blush, but couldn't help laughing. "Fair point," he said. "Maybe I'll try it later. Anyway, my other question is: why exactly do you need this many candles?"
Harry watched her go, with a smile on his face. "I like the new you," he said. "Draco Malfoy, protector of cats and champion of Muggle technology. Who'd've thought it?"
Harry started to laugh as Draco finished speaking, and Draco looked at him, bewildered. He followed Harry's gaze, though, and started to laugh himself. Hermione and Ron were both gazing at him, open-mouthed.
"Harry it is," said Malfoy. "And, ditto. My surname isn’t something I’m particularly proud of, so I tend to go by Draco these days."
Harry hugged him, but just then there was a loud clanking sound and the gates swung open to reveal Filch, who glared at them. "I suppose you think you're all too important to turn up when everyone else does, do you?" he grumbled. "Come on, then. The Headmistress says you're to come with me. Where are your trunks?"
"I'm not bothered by people knowing," added Harry. "In fact, the more people that are here, the better."
expected them to be, tonight," he said. "But they're not often like that. Most of the time they don't even recognise me, and it's a struggle to get them to do anything. I'm just so
"It looks FABULOUS," Harry assured him. "And I like that you're not wearing a tie. It'd be too formal for tonight otherwise, but the open-necked shirt is perfect."
"Well, I'm glad the thirty-two-year old you did," said Harry, grinning. "Now we both know where we stand. The only trouble is, the thirty-two-year-old
"Right, so basically women and men can each be split into high voices and low voices. Women with high voices are sopranos, women with low voices are altos, men with high voices are tenors, and men with low voices are basses. In practice most people's voices are actually in the middle – which is called mezzo-soprano for women and baritone for men – but choral music is usually written for those four sections. And, I can tell you exactly what the numbers were, because I've got last night's programme in my bag. Hang on."
image while I'm at work, or I'll never get anything done," he said. "Better dash now, though. See you tomorrow afternoon?"
"No, I actually think it'll be fun," said Harry. "I kind of want to hear about what you've been up to in Italy when you
"I had a sort of mental link with Voldemort," said Harry, noting that Malfoy flinched at the use of the name. "I didn't see
Draco had already blushed more times in the previous hour than in the whole of the rest of his life, he decided, but at Ron's words he felt his entire body become flushed with colour. He bowed his head to give him the chance to restore some of his dignity. When he looked up again, he found both Ron and Hermione gazing at him with... could that be
"Lucius Malfoy," he said. HIs face was expressionless, and his voice gave no clues about what he might have been thinking. "Fancy seeing you here. I assume it's a wildly improbable coincidence? You can't actually have been looking for me?"
"Ice-skating? No," said Harry. "I always wanted to, when I was little, but they would never have let me. And I’ve never got round to trying it since. Is there a rink near here, then?"
"Erm... I'm not entirely sure," said Draco, sounding nervous. "Look, Harry... my parents are... well, not quite the same as the last time you saw them. Just... Well, you'll see. Here we are."
The basking only last for a minute before another customer turned up at the window, but Draco was in a sufficiently good mood that he hardly used
been an emotionally draining few hours – but he was keen not to spoil this surprising new whatever-it-was with Harry. "OK, you're on," he said; he was pleased to note that Harry appeared delighted at this response. "But only if you promise to tell me about you as well. I assume you're Head Auror by now, are you?"
"Professor Malfoy's right," said James, who had wandered over while Draco had been speaking. "It'll be over soon, and in the meantime we'll stick together. Stay close to Al and Score and let them answer any questions. And me, of course, but I can't be with you as much as they can. You'll be on your own in lessons, but if people start bugging you then, just tell the teacher."
to finally go to Hogwarts," Lily said, "but I'll miss you, Mum! It'll be really weird not seeing you till Christmas. You'll send me lots of owls, won't you?"
"Father has donated a bag of cakes to our excursion; I suspect that's his way of trying to make you trust us," said Draco, ruthlessly shoving his galloping thoughts to the back of his mind. "I think there's even a Christmas pudding in there."
"Yes, it's me," said Draco. "Sorry. I'm sure I'm the last person you would want to see at this point."
"You do realise it's dark outside, right?" said Harry, but he got up obediently anyway and went over to the window, where he found that the gibbous moon was illuminating the grounds quite well. "Wait. Which way is the Manor?"
He took Harry's face in both hands and kissed him lightly on the lips. This time, though, he didn't stop; he deepened the kiss almost immediately, turning his head to get better access. Harry responded enthusiastically, wrapping his arms around Draco and kissing back. This went on for a few minutes before Draco walked a few steps backwards, pulling Harry with him, and then dropped to the sofa with Harry on top of him.
"Hot chocolate," said Harry suddenly. "That's what I want. Are you really tired? There must be somewhere that's still open that has hot chocolate. D'you fancy sitting down for a bit and chatting? It's fine if you need to sleep, though. We can always do it another time."
"Possibly nothing," said Harry. "But it doesn’t look good. There was an explosion in which several houses were destroyed, and Blaise was found searching through the rubble. He claims he had nothing to do with the explosion, but he refuses to say why he was there or what he was searching for. He’s being kept in custody for further questioning, but we’ll have to let him go if we can’t find any evidence soon, even though we have no other suspects."
as brave. He suspected that he would never have summoned the nerve to ask Draco to hold him in bed if he hadn't been in such a state after spending the evening doing the rounds with Ginny.
"And all the craft stalls seem to have a section of animal ornaments made from thin twigs. Odd," said Harry.
Draco paused before answering, considering the question. "I want to say off, but I'm also still bloody freezing," he admitted eventually. "How about we start with all our clothes still on, but remove them as we warm up?"
Draco didn't say anything, and Harry looked up from his bent-over stance to find that Draco's face was hard to decipher. He stood up and peered at him. Annoyed, he decided. Draco definitely looked a bit annoyed.
"Hermione, I know it must be particularly difficult for you to come here," said Draco when they were all standing in the entrance hall. "I'm very grateful that you agreed to do so. I apologise for what happened last time you were here. Rest assured that the parts of the house that were used during the war are now closed off, so you won't need to see those rooms again."
Draco shook himself. "Sorry," he said. "I was just thinking that it sounds as if the two of you don't spend much time together alone at all."
"Obviously I'm extremely polite, and I tell them that I'm very flattered but I have a boyfriend," said Draco.
Potter, who had been starting to look a little more composed, instantly reverted to his almost-catatonic demeanour at this, but eventually he spoke. "I... I'll answer if I can. What's the question?"
Harry grinned. "What makes you think Professor Malfoy's seating plan no longer applies?" he asked mischievously. The majority of the class looked distraught; a few of them, however, seemed delighted.
Harry fell asleep almost as soon as he got into bed, having stayed up far too late to finish his book, but he awoke after only a few hours. The sun wasn't up yet, but the sky was so light that sunrise couldn't be far away; Harry couldn't see his clock while facing the window, but decided it must be about 6am. "Far too early to get up," he thought. He turned over to avoid the glow from the sky, intending to go back to sleep, but was instead struck by the sight before his eyes.
"Pretty well, I think. When I sang "Thy Rebuke" I think he had a tear in his eye, so I'm counting that as a good sign."
"Well, it will," said Draco. "But you can always take it off again later tonight if you want to. I just think it might make things more awkward if you don't wear it until then."
Very short one tonight due to the aforementioned lurgy, sorry. But I am taking the day off tomorrow in an effort to recuperate, so I hope to write a lot more then.
Draco stared at him. "I'd be delighted," he said. "But are you sure? What happened to waiting a few weeks?"
you last talk to Blaise?" asked Harry, as they stepped back into Draco’s forty-sixth-floor apartment.
"Well, thank you very much! I'm pleased you like them. When do you want to do this, by the way? Soon, I presume?"
"Where have you been?!" demanded Hermione. "You said an hour! We were just about to start searching for you!"
"Thank you, Draco," said Harry. "I appreciate all this. And I’ve enjoyed this evening. See you tomorrow!" They shook hands, and Harry stepped into the fireplace.
"I told her that she might be able to go on living a lie, but I can't. I'm a terrible liar, but she's always been brilliant at it. She can keep a totally straight face while she's lying through her teeth to someone. I've even seen her fool her mother. I used to admire her for it, actually, but it feels different now I know she's been lying to
, where Draco lives, is the tallest building in Manchester (in fact, the tallest building in the UK outside London). It has a 'shelf' about halfway up; everything below that shelf is the Hilton Hotel, and everything above is luxury apartments. I would LOVE to live there!
There was another long silence, during which Potter sat with his head drooping and his eyes shut, and Draco took the opportunity to run his gaze over the parts of Potter that he could see, in order to check for any obvious signs of injury. Then Potter pushed himself slowly to a standing position and walked over to the bathroom, where he stared expressionlessly at himself in the mirror for a while.
Scorpius beamed, looking very relieved. "I'm so glad I don't have to keep it a secret any more," he said. "I would have told you the truth if you'd asked, though – you do know that, don't you?"
Draco stared at him for a moment, then he smiled and took Harry's hand to lead him into the bedroom, extinguishing the living room lights as he did so. When he finally let go of Harry, for the first time in almost an hour, the sense of loss was startling. It was insignificant, however, compared to the sense of wonder that he felt as he stood in front of Harry and began to strip, keeping his eyes fixed on Harry the whole time.
"I was standing in the queue when you got here," she told him. "Maybe you have something on your mind? You looked right through me."
you. No, I haven't been with anyone else, and you're right: it's not something I would ever do. It's quite ironic that
"OK, thanks," said Harry. "And did I hear you say you're taking Scorpius out now? I think it'd probably be a good idea if you told him what's going on while you're at it. Albus will want to if you don't, so it'd be nice if he didn't have to go through it all again."
"Ooh, I know what you could do," he said suddenly. "You could start with the gorgeous white tie and tails, and then explain that that's not the only sort of music you sing, and then... take bits of it off? You know, take the jacket and tie off, and maybe open the shirt at the neck and roll up the sleeves a bit? To make it all a bit more laid back."
"We did. I said she can keep the house – I have these quarters, and I stay here most of the time anyway, so it's not urgent for me to find somewhere else. I'll have to get a flat or something for the holidays, because I need somewhere that the kids can stay with me – we agreed that they can all spend their time with whichever of us they want to. I
"Oh, of course there is, but nowhere near as much, and it doesn't usually feel like it's a total waste of time."
. It helps." Ron glared at him, but seemed slightly mollified... until he fell over again a minute later.
Marvelling inwardly at the idea that this conclusion wasn't scaring him, Draco put his dressing-gown on and ventured downstairs. He peered through the peephole. Granger and Weasley. Of course it was Granger and Weasley. Steeling himself, he opened the door.
time with you. I was already thinking that yesterday, and today the feeling is stronger. So, yes, I'm thinking of you like that. The question is… might you be able to think of
Draco nodded, and Harry grabbed a handful of Floo powder. "Pendennis View," he said, throwing it into the fire. He took hold of Draco's arm, and they both stepped into the flames.
"It’s very handy, keeping an owl in your office," commented Harry. "I must try that. Usually I just send Helen to the owlery."
He rooted through his backpack until he found a small booklet, and turned to the last page. After a quick count, he announced: "Forty-two sopranos. Forty-six altos. Twelve tenors. Twenty-three basses. ... Oh, wait, those twelve tenors include the two who were ill on the day, so there were only ten. Plus me."
Harry shook his head, but couldn't help smiling. The interruption had actually relaxed him, he found. "The thing is... I definitely want you to be here. I've really enjoyed all the time we've spent together, and I feel as if I could talk to you about anything. Whatever else happens, I don't want to lose that. I want you as a friend. But... I
know the truth, that's all I'm bothered about. The kids are welcome to their fantasies of you. I'd rather have the real thing."
"And this area is very peaceful," added Lucius. "The nearest station is miles away, and there isn't that much traffic. The people are very friendly if you approach them, but they don't bother you if you don't. We only came here because it was cheap, but it's proved to be a good decision."
"So... you're saying the sex will get even better," said Harry slowly. He grinned. "We may have to give up work. I'm not sure there's going to be enough time in the day for us to spend a sufficient proportion of it in bed, otherwise."
Harry grinned ruefully. "I was about to ask how on earth you knew that, but I suppose I do get mentioned in the Prophet from time to time, don’t I?"
"Of course I will," Harry promised. "But I'm hoping that if my plan works then you might feel comfortable enough to change your mind a bit sooner."
"I know what you're thinking," murmured Ron into his ear, making Harry jump slightly. "You're going to offer to share a room with Malfoy, aren't you?"
"Bacon time," said Lucius, who was at the stove tending to a frying pan. "Also known as half past eleven, on this occasion. You slept for twelve hours – you must have needed it."
keen to know why you've called the press conference yourself. I don't think you've ever done that before, have you? You've usually got Hermione to do it for you."
"Nothing long-term. A few flings here and there. To be honest, it was me that ended each of them – I'm happy with my own company most of the time, and none of them felt as if they were who I wanted to be with forever."
"Ron's at The Burrow stuffing his face," Ginny told him. "He says the only thing he hated about the last raid was that he hadn't eaten properly first. Although I'm not sure how Hermione'll react when she hears he's gone to his mum for food rather than going home."
An hour later, Harry and Draco Apparated from Grimmauld Place to the Burrow. They had no luggage with them: Kreacher had been delighted at the thought of moving to the Manor and living with 'Master Draco and Mistress Narcissa', but had been horrified at the thought of Harry transporting any of his own belongings there. He'd promised to have everything put away in Draco's suite at the Manor by the time Harry got back there.
you are," said Narcissa, when he entered the kitchen. "Did you sleep well?" She poured him a mug of coffee.
Surprised and delighted, Draco walked back onstage and found the audience on its feet. He’d assumed at first glance that it was just Harry and his crowd of Gryffindors getting carried away as Gryffindors do, and that maybe the Slytherin parts of the row were going along with them just to try and fit in… but no, he now saw that it was the entire audience that was standing and cheering, and also that the hall was now almost half full, meaning that several hundred more people had come in since he’d started singing.
"Not that I have a problem with it, but I'm curious – when exactly did you start referring to Harry as
Harry stared at him. "That’s possibly the most insane thing I’ve ever heard," he announced. "What’s wrong with not having a wife and kids? Surely no-one would judge you for being single?"
The song went well – he thought it was probably the best he’d ever sung it – and at the end there was a short silence before thunderous applause broke out. Draco couldn’t help glancing at the faces of his family and friends (new and old, in both cases), and was gratified to see astonishment on most of them, but even more so at Harry’s look of extreme pride. Hugely encouraged, he settled into the rest of his programme.
"Not before I've returned the favour," said Draco. "I've been fantasising about this for years, remember. Although, now you've added to the pressure by being a blowjob natural, I'm not sure I dare try."
"It's well known that Draco Malfoy has been missing from the wizarding world for many years," said Rita. "Where has he been? Have you been in touch with him all along?"
"Kreacher? The house-elf? I'd forgotten he was yours," said Draco. "But... Look, it's a very kind offer, and I'd love to be able to accept, but... it would be difficult for me to live anywhere other than the Manor. At the moment, at least. I can understand why you might want to never set foot there again, but... please will you just come and see, before you decide? It'll make more sense when you're there, I promise."
"Ah yes, Messiah, was it? I've heard of that. But I don't actually know what it is, and I was confused by everything else you said. Did you say you didn't know about the concert until that morning? That's not normally how it works, is it?"
"I do now," said Draco. "I tried getting the house-elves to encourage them to eat, and that worked at first, but now neither of them will eat unless I start them off. I kept getting home and finding them still sitting at the table with untouched plates of food in front of them, and the house-elves were all distraught. It was easier to just start coming home every day. It's not as if there was anyone I was spending lunchtimes with at work, anyway, so it wasn't a big deal."
"I think he'd like that," said Harry. "Why haven't you ever contacted him before, though? I know you knew he existed."
Harry looked at him, startled. "Are you sure?" he asked. "You don't have to. Not if you're uncomfortable."
"Don't apologise for that - your lack of time is the main thing we're hoping to fix, after all," Draco reassured him. "Now, I know you'd already agreed to today and it would have dropped them right in it if you'd pulled out. But have you had a chance to talk to anyone about future commitments yet?"
you to touch me, eh?" he said lightly. Harry's eyes widened at this, but Draco decided not to push his luck – for the moment, at least. "I'm fine with that if you are; thank you for suggesting it," he said. "I should warn you, though, that I sleep naked. I can put on pyjamas if you prefer, but I don't actually own any – do you have any I could borrow?" He thought it best not to reveal that he was well aware that Harry slept naked too, due to the delightful sight that had met him when he'd emerged from the bedroom that morning.
"It smells great," said Draco, truthfully. "I think it'll be much easier to use a charm to heat the Christmas pudding, though, don't you?"
"Come in," said Draco. "Would you mind if I quickly got dressed? I'd feel a bit more comfortable. I'll be as quick as I can."
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. "Wouldn't want you to fall over," he said, as the world spun around them.
"Since we're both aiming to be better at communication, I should tell you that I really do love you, too," said Draco, still beaming. "I know I've indicated it in lots of songs, but I thought I should probably say it at least once, too."
"No pressure there, then," said Rabia, her eyes sparkling. "Hi Harry, it's lovely to meet you. Draco's told me all about you, and I have to say I'm intrigued."
"OK," said Harry, trying to process all this. "But I don't really understand why the bonding spell does all that."
Harry was baffled. "One more go through what? What are you doing? ... Forgive me. I do really want to know, but I'm actually in a hurry too – I need to be at work in a few minutes. So I'll leave you in peace, but... could we maybe meet another day when we both have more time? I'd like to hear about how things are going for you these days – I haven't heard anything about you in years."
"So this relationship is only a few weeks old?" asked Rita. "Doesn't that seem a very short time in which to decide that you want to be with someone for the rest of your life?"
remember of it?" he asked gently. "We both said that we're thrilled to have each other as good friends, but that we're definitely also very attracted to each other. You said you wanted to go slowly, for very understandable reasons, and I said that I was fine with that, and that I want you in every possible way but am very happy to be patient. Does that help?"
Malfoy stared at him for a while, and then smiled and stood up, holding out his hand, which Harry shook, startled to find that his heart was racing. "Thank you," said Malfoy. "I'm very grateful. I was expecting to spend the year being shunned, at best. When it turned out that none of the others were coming back, I thought I'd have to share with the Slytherin seventh-years, and I wasn't sure how they'd react to me. But none of them has as much reason to hate me as any of the non-Slytherin eighth-years do, so I did panic a bit when I found out I'd have to share with one of you."
"I've just realised that I may have caused a problem earlier," Draco admitted. "When I Apparated to fetch Weasley, I came out here so no one would see me, but when I came to
"He was, for a while," said Hermione. "But he quit a couple of years ago, about the same time as he decided he'd had enough of the wizarding world. He lives here in Cricklewood now, and we're the only wizards he still sees."
one. Hasn't she met anyone new since she left school? Anyway... Listen to how stupid I am. She said she'd assumed I must be seeing other people too, because I've shown no interest in her for ages, but she thought we'd somehow come to an unspoken agreement not to talk about it because of the kids, and it'd be discussed when they were older.
“I already told you,” said Draco. “Some of the songs I sing make me think of you. I must have mentioned that to Rabia.”
Draco was taken aback. "I'd love to join you," he said. "Thank you very much for making me feel so welcome. It's more than I deserve, I think. But please don't feel you need to invite me every time. I know you three have a special bond, and I'd hate to intrude on that."
Draco smiled. "Me? Not at all," he said. "I'd be very proud to be officially at your side. And of course there's the bonus of being able to see people's reactions.
"I forgot you would have been here before," said Harry. "I'd like to hear about that, sometime. But let's see where Teddy is. He'd better be here – I'll be unimpressed if he's lit all these candles and then gone out. Teddy!"
There were a few murmurs when he stood up and people realised he was going to sing from memory, especially as the other three soloists were clutching scores, but this was something about which Draco was quite passionate - he knew he always performed better once he was off-copy, and if others didn't want to risk it, that was up to them, wasn't it? "Comfort ye," he sang. "Comfort ye, my people." And there it was - the audience was spellbound already.
The next morning, Draco was woken by the pleasant smell of bacon wafting up the stairs. He lay in bed for a few more minutes, taking in his unfamiliar surroundings. The bedroom was tiny, containing little more than a double bed, wardrobe and bedside table. The curtains were open; he realised he hadn't closed them when he'd gone to bed, partly because the room was so dark anyway, but mainly because he'd been too tired to do anything other than pull off his clothes and collapse.
"While I was in Russia, I watched a lot of Muggle TV, and there was this programme with vampires. Spike is named after one of them," he explained. Granger nodded knowingly and then said to Weasley, as he opened his mouth, "I'll explain it to you later, Ron."
He'd managed to remain stoic while answering the reporter's and solicitor's questions, but the few minutes they'd spent at home were whirling round inside his head. He'd been startled at how out of place he'd suddenly felt in the house where he'd lived for twenty years, and Ginny had seemed lost for words; they'd both just stood there for ages, until eventually Harry had gone to wash his face. When he returned, Ginny just said "Ready?" and Harry had nodded, before taking her arm to Apparate them both to the
Draco’s flush deepened. "It’s not just that," he said. "I’m gay, and I’m never sure how strangers will take that if they find out, and I suppose I’ve always been a bit paranoid about what people think of me, especially since the war. That’s the main reason I moved to Manchester, after all. So it’s sort of become second nature to hide stuff from strangers."
"No, it's fine," said Draco. He called Woopy, and a few minutes later they were both sipping their drinks.
So I don't know when he slept, or how exhausted and stressed he was, but he had a smile on his face every time he made one of his many speeches that year, and I couldn't stop thinking about how the FA and the Government were taking advantage of his good nature. And at some point it occurred to me that I could imagine the Ministry of Magic doing the same with Harry, and that if they also decided Draco should be wheeled out then that would be interesting.
Albus sank onto the sofa, pulling Scorpius down with him. Draco sat opposite them in the armchair, feeling very intrusive. He was desperate to ask about Harry, but restrained himself for the moment: Albus was important too.
Now, though, it was Thursday teatime: Draco had just returned to Harry's quarters after his day's teaching, and Ginny was due to appear in half an hour's time. Harry was a bundle of nerves and was pacing round the room; Draco opted to add
"Well, we should be able to get some in Hawes," said Harry. "Although… no, actually, that might be a bad idea. I don't want to make things difficult for your parents. You know what small towns are like."
Harry and Draco stamped their feet on the mat to remove the snow, then followed Ron through to the back of the house, where Hermione was sitting in an armchair by the window.
"You used to get really embarrassed when people saw you in your undies, when we were at school," Ron recalled. "I like this new confident you. Even if it does make me a little bit uncomfortable until I get used to it."
"Well, you don't have to," said Draco. "Dinner is just about ready, and you are allowed to quiz me while we eat. Ready to go?" He held out his arm.
"Correct," said Draco. "So, Harry, my thought is this: if they need you so badly, why don't they ask you
"Yeah, right," said Ginny. "When was the last time you came to see one of my games? You never come to watch any more!"
performance go with just one bow,” she told him as she gave him a gentle shove. “That was the best recital I’ve ever seen, student or otherwise. Well done.”
"Well... Of course," said Draco, realising that he could hardly refuse. He wasn't at all sure how Granger would react to his presence, but decided that she would probably prefer even someone she hated than no one at all; she had, after all, always seemed more sensible than most of her friends.
"Well, I was thinking about it tonight while we were eating - Hermione and Ron say hello, by the way - and I realised that if we just turn up and start wandering around the shops, at best we'll just get a load of people staring at us, and at worst someone will say or do something nasty and I'll have to step in and then there'll be a
Yawning, Harry let his gaze wander round the room as he waited to be served. Most of the tables were occupied by couples of about Harry's age, although the one nearest the door was surrounded by a group of five very loud teenage girls who were showing each other things on their phones and cackling. Next to them was a young man, again about Harry's age. He was on his own; he had his eyes closed and a frown on his face, and was muttering to himself.
"It's one of the great tenor roles," Draco told him. "The Dream of Gerontius is a huge piece by an English composer called Edward Elgar, about an old man who dies. The first part is about his thoughts when he's about to die, and the second part is what happens to him after death, when he's in heaven."
Harry and Ron looked at each other, alarmed, but Hermione just rolled her eyes and said: "Still on the train, obviously. Isn't it still the case that all the large luggage is brought up to school separately?"
"Hello, Ginny," said Harry, as Draco nodded politely but remained silent. "So what's this solution you've found, then?"
now seen all five seasons in the last few weeks, that's not the same as being obsessed with it for five years."
Draco looked away. "I was too embarrassed," he mumbled. "And there wasn't really anyone there that I knew well enough to feel comfortable asking. So I did a lot of reading instead, and formed my own diagnosis. All the symptoms fit early-onset Alzheimer's, and if it is that then there's no cure, magical or otherwise. Patients just get worse and worse until they die, usually within ten years."
Ron emerged from the fireplace at the exact same moment that Harry walked into the room calling "Hermione? Is that you?"
"I appreciate that," said Harry. "To be quite honest, though, I do actually feel a bit relieved that it's over between me and her, now I've got used to the idea. She deserves someone who really wants to be with her, and Ron's right – that hasn't been me for quite a while. I just couldn't bear to admit it – to myself or to her."
"Must be an R in the month," said Seamus. Then, off Harry's look, "What? You're hardly ever around! You're either teaching or off prostituting yourself for the bloody Ministry. You're certainly not doing anything sensible like... oh, I don't know, sleeping or eating properly. And I
"Well, she's going to have to get used to it, isn't she?" said Harry. "She's only got herself to blame."
"Hmm… Just lots of warm clothes, really. You can use a warming charm, of course, but it's kind of fun to do it the natural way. Wear at least two layers over your entire body – especially socks and gloves. And a hat. Oh, and an entire change of clothing just in case you somehow get totally soaked."
"I was about to ask whether you'd had a good trip, but the fact that you're three hours late suggests otherwise," said Lucius. "Sit down and have some mushroom soup, while I heat up the pie."
Draco looked a bit startled at this inclusion, and Harry smiled gratefully at Molly. "We're fine, thank you," he told her. "Just tired. But I promised I'd come and update Ron."
He leaned back in his armchair and closed his eyes. It was likely to be a couple of hours before Ginny got home from work if the previous week was anything to go by, and, after almost two weeks in the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, he was grateful to have some time to just relax.
"I hope so," said Harry. "Tell you what, though. Let's agree on a code word for both visits – to your family
Harry laughed. "You know what? You're absolutely right. And it seems ridiculous now that I think about it, because they're my closest friends, so if I can't talk to them then there's no chance with anyone else! I really can't, though. The other day, they came round to drop off a holly wreath for my door, and I was really depressed before they turned up. I was thrilled to see them – they stopped me moping – but for some reason I didn't tell them I was depressed. They launched into a story about how long it took to gather the holly from the garden and how many times they got pricked making up the wreath, and we had a good laugh and they cheered me up... but we never actually talked about anything to do with me."
The children stood up obediently, but Harry held up his hand. "Hang on a minute," he said. "I'm sure your dad was going to introduce you to my friend before you go."
It looked as if most of the inhabitants of Grimmauld Place had gone to bed by the time Draco arrived, as only a few of the houses were showing any lights. Number Twelve wasn't one of them, and Draco's heart sank: reluctant as he was to speak to Potter, it would make his life a lot easier if the man was actually at home and awake.
As they reached the platform at the far end of the hall, dozens of house-elves suddenly popped into sight, and started passing trays of Christmas-tree-shaped biscuits along the rows. Professor McGonagall, resplendent in the centre of the platform, winked at Harry, as he realised with a burst of relief that the audience's attention was distracted from him. He gestured for Draco to step onto the platform, and then joined his partner. McGonagall clapped her hands as they reached her.
Draco laughed. "No, this is the Cutty Sark," he told him. "It's more than a hundred years old - it's a tourist attraction, it doesn't sail any more. You're right, though, it
"Yes, and Ron… helped me… wrap them round me," said Harry, increasingly breathlessly. Draco hoped that this was due to the fact that he was planting tiny kisses along the path of the lights as he removed them – one of his better ideas, he congratulated himself privately.
"OK, that sounds sensible," said Draco. "And I've been wavering between a couple of choices for one of the songs, but maybe you can help me decide. Let me just wash my hands first, though - I seem to have got marmalade on them."
Draco strode to the counter and returned soon after, carrying two cups, one of which he put down in front of Harry.
"I hope so too," said Draco. "Good luck. And stay strong." He shook hands with Harry – he'd briefly considered going for a hug, but decided that this was not the moment for confusing relationship increments – and stepped outside, closing the door behind him.
"Well, if we're being truthful, Ron, Harry was obsessed with Draco when we were still at school, wasn't he? Remember what he was like that last year?"
Harry grinned and hugged him. "It's good to see you," he told him. "It's been a while, hasn't it? Sorry about that. Perfect timing, though. I'm just thinking about making a meal."
Ron stood up and went over to the window, where he breathed on the frost-covered glass and drew "HP + DM" inside a heart with his finger. "Two very good questions," he said, eventually, as he turned back to face Harry. "I'm a bit embarrassed that the first one that springs to mind is that I miss the canteen at the Ministry. It had its faults, but I was a lot better at eating a regular healthy lunch at a sensible time when I had that option. In the shop, George and I often forget to eat if it's really busy, and then we end up grabbing something quick and unhealthy because we're starving. But I suppose that's just lack of organisation rather than anything else."
"Fucking hell, Draco, that feels amazing," said Harry weakly. "I've never had that done to me before. Don't stop."

Harry and Draco did get quite a few inquisitive stares when they walked around the Ministry together, but thankfully no-one had asked them any questions yet: they had given a carefully-crafted joint statement to the Daily Prophet on Sunday, and Harry mentally congratulated himself on having insisted, as part of this, that they should be left alone.
"Well, I’ll see what Hermione thinks," said Harry. "It’ll have to wait till after my meeting, though. I’m already late. I’ll owl you both if there’s any news, OK?"
Hermione fixed him with an unwavering gaze. "What?" he said. "Why are you.... Oh, no. You can't be serious. You're thinking of Potter, aren't you?"
. That one's a real beast to play. Luckily everything else was fairly straightforward for me, though, so I could concentrate on the Schubert."
Draco grinned. "It was worth it, though," he said. "Even though I'm aching in places I'd forgotten I could ache. It's been a while. What time is it, anyway? What
If it hadn't been a totally insane idea, he would've sworn that the cat was trying to get him to follow it. And as soon as
day since, there hadn't been a single moment in which the temperature had risen above freezing point, and so the snow and ice was still on the ground. Harry reckoned this was the longest he'd ever gone through a winter without slipping on the ice, and memories of bruises acquired in previous years ensured that he was keen to extend his record still further.
happy. There'd been the occasional argument when they first got married, but never anything serious; thinking about it now, Harry couldn't remember the last time they'd actually had a proper row about anything, but it had been years ago. That had to be a good thing, didn't it? It was true that the excitement of the early years of their marriage was long gone, but Harry assumed that that was a natural part of growing older together: after a while, you were bound to stop surprising each other, weren't you? And if you had kids, your happiness became inextricably dependent on theirs, and your main mission in life, above all others, was to be a good parent. James, Albus and Lily all seemed happy and well-adjusted, therefore the Potter family must be fine.
"Well, I suppose it may seem as if we're moving a bit fast," said Draco, "but life's too short to waste time when I think we both know what we want. It's not as if we've just met, after all."
"Next Saturday. Against Gryffindor. We should win quite easily, in theory. The only good player on the Gryffindor team is James Potter, but the rest of his team is terrible, so the only way he can save them is by scoring millions of goals single-handedly. No-one on the Slytherin team is individually as good as him, but we're all fairly competent and we work well together. Al and I seemed to take the other teams by surprise last year – they all assumed that because we're both quite skinny we wouldn't be any good as Beaters, and by the time they realised we're stronger than we look we'd usually already won. This year will be a bit harder, because now they all know what we can do, but I still think we can beat Gryffindor."
