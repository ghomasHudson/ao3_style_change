“Please don’t call it that,” Harry says. “We didn’t talk about it! Because he
When Harry Apparates back to his flat, it’s to find Ginny sprawled along the floor, watching Muggle cartoons on their telly, and Malfoy sitting hamrod-straight next to her, eyes glued to the screen.
One small mercy is that Malfoy has apparently woken up already – though the coffee shop is closed today – and the bed is empty. Harry wonders if he had reached out for Malfoy in the night, if for a moment he had been able to touch Malfoy easily, without needing to think or worry about it.
“That’s true,” Hermione said, reluctantly, as if she didn’t want to admit Malfoy had a point. “It’s an example of the prejudice that most people don’t tend to think about, but it’s important – ”
Malfoy takes a deep breath. He opens his mouth, a little hesitantly, and then he says, “I have to talk to Pansy.” He gives Harry one last look, and his eyes soften. He adds, “I’ll be back in an hour.”
Harry rolled his eyes, flipping over a pancake. “I was going to stay with Teddy and Andromeda.”
Zabini cleared his throat.
sorry, he realised, even though he should have been, for Hermione’s sake at least. He wasn’t sorry at all. He wouldn’t take it back for anything.
He sent a reply declining their offer.
“Oh, what,” Malfoy snarled, “you want to
Harry eyed Ron with some alarm. Well, when he put it like
Narcissa softens a little. “And do you plan on marrying him? In which case we would not have an heir unless – ”
Harry could not bring himself to care. It was almost as though he and Malfoy were the only people in the common room again.
way, Harry could pretend that this was all a joke, something silly.
“Oh,” Harry said.
“Malfoy’s angry with me too,” offers Harry.
, in Harry’s own writing. Things had progressed from there.
Malfoy started taking all the clothes out of the trunk. “We’re burning these and we’re buying you new ones.”
“It wasn’t like that,” Harry said, “it was like – it’s really complicated, but when Voldemort killed me and everyone thought I was dead, I actually died, but because part of his soul was in my soul – or, whatever. I was dead then. And I came back to life, because of the soul thing, so when – well, when your mum came to check if I was alive or not, I was, then. She lied to him. For – well, for you.”
“Congratulations,” he says to them awkwardly, which isn’t the interrogation Harry expected.
“That’s wonderful,” Remus tells him, patting Sirius gently on the back. “I’m very happy for you both.”
“I hate you,” Harry laughed, and kissed him.
She was beautiful, Harry thought all of a sudden. In the kitchen light with her hair tied back messily and her bare, freckled stomach exposed by her shirt, flannel tied around her waist. And part of him would always love her. It wasn’t like sleeping with Seamus or kissing any of those boys and girls in the Muggle clubs they’d gone to had cancelled that out. If ever the time was to get back together with her, it was now. But they had tried, and it hadn’t worked, had just made them upset and angry. And Ginny didn’t want to, and neither did he. If he had wanted to, he wouldn’t hesitate.
Malfoy from beside him kept cackling at the Valentines, and Harry kept looking at the way he was licking jam off his butter knife, which was frankly obscene and not
Like Harry had summoned him, he saw Malfoy’s white-blond head walking over to the castle when he stood up and scrubbed a hand over his face, and ran to catch up with him.
“I have no idea,” Malfoy replies. “I think she decided to make breakfast.”
“And you’re sure,” Molly says, “that you’re both not rushing into this?”
Harry tried to move around him. “He probably just wants advice about Ginny.”
“Gladly,” Hermione said. “But Harry – this, I was not prepared for. When we saw you that first day – I mean, you fell asleep with Malfoy, and you haven’t been able to sleep since – ”
“Oh, because I’m in love?” says Pansy, snorting. Harry thinks about Padma, and thinks Pansy
“You were sleeping,” Harry said.
“Of course you’d say that,” murmurs Harry, fighting the urge to roll his eyes at Malfoy’s coffee obsession. You’d think that a man who was surrounded by coffee all day and night would eventually get tired of it, but not Malfoy.
Harry frowned. “It was an accident. A door hit us,” he said. “And Malfoy’s also injured. In his head.” This was a truer statement than Madam Pomfrey would ever know. “I tried to cast a spell but he wouldn’t let me.”
And he went over to sit in front of her portrait, listening to her rant about the usual inhabitants of Grimmauld Place, nodding absently, and telling her about how his mother was doing.
“Oh,” Dean says. “Yeah. Just wanted to confirm your order for Cam? Coffee-flavoured is an interesting choice.”
Owls from Ron, Hermione, Pansy, Blaise, and Daphne kept flying in when they had dinner. Sometimes they got into screaming rows over whose turn it had been to clean up or who’d knocked over one of the house elves’ shrunken heads, arguments that turned bafflingly into every other thing they’d used to fight over – Hagrid, Slytherins, Quidditch. It was easier to fight with none of the other eighth years around, but it meant they made up quicker, too.
The only thing Harry could think of to say to this was, “Um.”
“Um, because you’re freaking out?”
“You really convinced her,” says Malfoy once she’s gone, pushing Harry’s arm away. “Good job, she definitely believes we’re in love.”
“Do you.” Malfoy presses his face closer to Harry’s, nudging their noses together. “Is this real, for you?”
And that – that’s Harry’s excuse for everything he does over the next month.
────────────────────
Harry was so relieved he almost wanted to insist that Malfoy stopped walking so he could calm down. “Me neither.”
Harry barely lasts until they’ve stepped inside. He pushes Malfoy against the wall, kisses him and kisses him so hard his lips feel bruised and hurt. He presses open-mouthed kisses on Malfoy’s pale neck, moves on to Malfoy’s collarbone, smothers a laugh when Malfoy shivers and tells him those are
Malfoy had mumbled something under his breath and turned away.
It wasn’t easy to leave them behind. Everyone wanted to talk to Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville almost as much as they wanted to talk to Harry. He felt sick. He wondered why he bothered to come back, but he knew the answer – he had no idea what else to do.
“Nightmare?” There was something in Malfoy’s eyes like understanding, or maybe it was mocking. More often than not, it was usually the first one nowadays.

“I would understand,” Malfoy says carefully, “if you would want to – ”

“Good.” Luna nods. “I’m going to meet Pansy Parkinson. She’s also having some problems with her love life. I know Padma very well, you know, so I’m sure I can help her out. Wish me luck.”
They didn’t make it to the bed.
“I know,” Ginny says, quieter.
“Three,” says Malfoy.
Ron and Hermione exchanged their meaningful looks at this, but they didn’t say anything, and Harry didn’t try to figure out why. He was too busy being annoyed at Malfoy.
The second time he wakes up, it’s out of necessity. Malfoy is shaking him awake.
Harry wants to do something normal, wants them to fall back into their rhythm, so they go grocery shopping, because it’s long overdue. Malfoy is wearing wizarding robes but they go to a Muggle store anyway, people’s odd looks meaning nothing to them by now.
“Okay then.” Harry swings his legs over the bed. He hesitates. He wants to – kiss Malfoy again, or something. There had been so much kissing last night. It had been so fucking awesome. But maybe it would make things awkward?
Harry swallows. “Okay.”
“Well, don’t,” Harry said, before he could think better of it.
“Oh,” Parvati said. She rummaged through the basket and came out with a piece of what looked like a sweet, with almonds inside it. “When I can’t sleep I go to the kitchens to ask the house elves for

“How many would you reckon?” Ginny presses on. “Ron and Hermione say they’d like two. Hypothetically, of course.”
and immediately spots Harry and Malfoy. He smiles at them, walking over, and then he sort of looks at them. Then he looks back at the sign outside of the shop that boasts free wedding cake samples for engaged couples, and the smile fades, to be replaced by an expression of befuddlement.
Malfoy’s eyes flash. In that second he reminds Harry strangely of Ginny in a temper, Cedric arguing over who should take the Cup, Cho furious with him, Parvati Patil with her chin up because he’d insulted her ages ago. It’s possible Harry has a type. “So
Roses are his favourite flower, actually, but Malfoy probably just picked them because they’re classic flowers that symbolise love, so Harry pushes away any warm feelings in his chest.
“Draco’s our fearless leader, I don’t know if you’ve noticed,” Pansy said.
“Sort of,” Harry lies.
“I had to deal with your mother,” Harry reminds him. “They’re tame compared to her.”
and Malfoy asks
“You’re so happy when you’re with him,” Hermione says. “So just be with him.”
,” repeats Malfoy, sounding delighted.
“Oh,” Harry said. “She’s your aunt. Have you – have you talked to her?”
Now Harry’s heart twists painfully at the expression on Adriana’s face. “Of course you’re welcome to stay,” he says gently. “Adriana – I’m sorry.Your family should be proud of you. You’re an excellent student, and you’re going to go places. I’m proud of you, yeah?”
“Did you dream about this?” Harry asks, legs entangled with Malfoy’s and neck covered in lovebites and an embarrassing smile on his face.
, Malfoy.”
Malfoy wants him too.
“Shall we…” Harry trails off. He clears his throat. “We could walk around?”
a good idea. Malfoy was probably the only person who would put up with Harry’s psychological damage and his obsession with treacle tart and his nightmares.
make some friends who are Muggles, they liked me.” His voice was proud, and Harry’s mouth tilted up. “They’re just people.”
he’d said earnestly.
Malfoy sighed dramatically and flopped down on his bed. “We’re going to be late because of you.”
? and he barely managed to say, “Er, I’m Harry, I’m not – ”
“That is a completely different situation.”
“Oh yes, very reasonable, you did it to yourself,” Malfoy muttered, rolling his eyes.
Harry looked at him back. “Me too,” he said, and meant it.
“Yeah, I
He went down and made breakfast, bacon and eggs and toast. Malfoy joined him after, hopping on the counter and distracting Harry with his long legs and the lovebites Harry had left on his skin.
They’ve both settled on a summer wedding, on a day no one else will know the significance of, but that is the date of their first ever kiss.
, and Sirius’s response:
Malfoy looks taken-aback. “Oh – well, alright, then. I suppose we don’t have to review the ground rules – ”
Harry blinks rapidly. Sirius and Remus’s stories about his parents are always bittersweet. Malfoy is a comforting weight near him, leaning against Harry’s shoulders.
say nothing had to change, the very first time we kissed – ”
“Maybe we should get something healthier,” he tells Malfoy.
“Lower your volume,” says Remus, sighing. “And of course we’ll sit down, Harry and Draco aren’t going to stand there the entire time they’re here.”
Malfoy startled. “Where are you going?”
“Me too,” says Harry. “But Hermione made me give them up.”
didn’t know that,” Harry said, and felt warm inside for reasons he didn’t really want to try and figure out.
“Hm,” Malfoy mumbled, “beat back those Bludgers, boys, and chuck that Quaffle here.”
“Look,” he said quietly, in the corner of the common room when everyone was saying goodbye, handing each other presents and wrapping scarves around their necks. Parvati Patil was kissing Daphne Greengrass under a sprig of mistletoe while her sister and Blaise catcalled at them. “I’ll be at the Weasleys’ all break, and.” He hesitated. “Write to me, okay?”
He waited for Malfoy to nod and sit down next to Daphne Greengrass and Parvati Patil, who was wearing a butterfly choker with her head in Daphne’s lap, before he moved away.
“That is pathetic,” Malfoy said, the first words he’d spoken to Harry in hours. “Honestly, this is a new low for him. Normally he’d have bagged one of the Patil twins instead. Well, Daphne has that covered.”
“None taken,” Harry says weakly.
“I – ” said Malfoy, scrambling up.
“You’re not about to cry, are you? Theo’s handkerchief is a bit ruined now.”
Harry could imagine. “You weren’t exactly an example of normal two-year old behaviour. Teddy doesn’t care about that. He gets loads of presents.” Harry gave him too much, according to Andromeda, but he remembered that when he was a kid, getting presents meant you were loved. He wanted to make sure Teddy knew that.
“No,” says Malfoy again, “but we should be a bit more – affectionate.” He sounds like he’s picking his words carefully.
They hadn’t gotten back together at all. They’d fallen apart instead. Ginny had said, close to tears, that he didn’t talk to her, that she didn’t think they even knew each other at all, and Harry couldn’t say she was wrong. Because he loved Ginny, but he had held on to her like a prize he could win back, and he had wanted her because it meant he would have a real family. And – he said this only once, because he knew how furious she would get – she had always wanted a hero, The Boy Who Lived, the boy who tore her nightmares to shreds with a sword in The Chamber of Secrets. That had been their worst row, violent enough that Ron and Hermione had to pull them apart. They made up soon enough and agreed to break up for good – sometimes things were just a bit tense.
“So have you two realised you’re in love with each other yet?” Hermione asks. “Harry, I genuinely thought you were dating Draco before this whole fiasco with...a wedding cake?”
“Are. You. Fucking with him. Is this some sort of practical joke?”
“Alright, fine.” Harry hauled him up. “We’re making a run for it, then.”
“Well,” Luna says serenely, “I wanted to see you. I also came to ask your advice. You see, I think I’m going to ask Ginny on a date. But she’s been so distracted lately. I think she may be part of the Zothenberg conspiracy.”
“Mrs Weasley, it’s really nice of you to offer to bake our wedding cake,” Harry says, at the monthly Weasley dinner, for the fifteenth time. “But like I told you, we’re pretty set on Dean’s sister’s bakery.”
Hermione was talking to Terry about their Ancient Runes homework but Harry could feel her gaze drifting up towards him and Malfoy constantly. He couldn’t really bring himself to care.
The drinks had been set in Neville and Justin’s room sometime after everyone emptied the first few cartons, probably by Hermione. Harry swung by to grab a bottle of Firewhiskey; he could hear the music from up here. He felt unsteady, and he didn’t think it was just because of the drinks.
“I’m sorry I hurt
to be nice to you.”
“Oh, all pureblood families did,” Malfoy said crossly, turning around to glare at him, “you can ask Weasley – ”
when he wasn’t sure whether McGonagall had caught on to what he and Malfoy had been doing.
Guilt had twisted it’s way into Harry’s heart. “I didn’t – ” he began. “I didn’t know what that spell was. At least I didn’t throw any Unforgivables at you.” Everything was coming out wrong. Everything was always a fight with Malfoy. Why had he thought it could be different?
Malfoy had been right. It was a good movie, even if Harry understood approximately seventy-five percent of it. He pretended not to notice when Malfoy teared up in the middle and in exchange Malfoy pretended not to notice when he teared up at the end. It was dark by the time they’d finished, time for dinner, but they stayed sitting for a while, Malfoy yawning and turning his head into Harry’s shoulder. They stayed there for a while, Harry still as a statue, barely daring to move, barely daring to breathe.
“Weasley, then,” said Malfoy. “He’s right next door.”
“You’ve a perfectly good place of your own, Gin,” says Harry, not moved by her sulking expression.
Harry looked back at Malfoy because he couldn’t help it, and he saw that Ginny had noticed.
Harry sank to his bed in despair and considered the tendency for dramatics in Slytherin House, and that maybe this was what the Sorting Hat had been referring to all along when he said Harry would do well there.
Madam Pomfrey took hold of both of them and sat them down on separate beds, tutting loudly all the while. “And quite right of him too! Students messing with healing magic...You’ve both always been delicate,” she said disapprovingly, grabbing Harry’s chin and inspecting his face.
“I cannot even begin to express the depths of my lack of surprise,” Malfoy told him, and they went back to Grimmauld Place with their dozens of bags and ordered takeout for lunch while Malfoy practiced Transfiguring items and made Harry ask him questions from his Arithmancy notes.
“I didn’t,” says Harry defensively.
Harry kept looking at him. He watched Malfoy’s jaw twitch, a fine blond hair falling over his eyes. He slid off the table abruptly.
Harry rolled his eyes again.
“You’ve been a lot better recently,” Hermione said, “and I just want to make sure you’re alright.”
“And you came back,” Malfoy said, voice quiet and still.
“Er,” Harry said, and thought that Blaise really should have been more apologetic when asking Ginny’s ex-boyfriend that question. “Possibly? If you had less of an inflated head.”
“It’s not like that,” Harry said, like an idiot. “I – er.” He didn’t know what to say now. He thought wildly of Ginny, but he couldn’t imagine she would care much. She’d probably laugh. He should tell her anyway, just in case. He thought of Seamus – that was weird, certainly? “I don’t think – I don’t know if Seamus told you that in the summer when we went to that rave, we – just so you know – ”
Harry’s heart sank, and he and Ron looked at each other with dismay. He hadn’t been able to sleep without Ron and Hermione in the room, lately. He hadn’t been able to sleep at all, really. It was one of the things he and Ginny had argued about. She had said he couldn’t sleep without them there, and Hermione couldn’t sit down unless she knew where they both were, and, “Ron has this fucking guilt complex about leaving you two alone for more than an hour, and where does that leave me?” Harry hadn’t been able to answer her.
you’re a romantic. It’s obvious.”
Harry groans.

“We had to have some traumatizing conversations with Professor McGonagall,” Hermione reminisced.
────────────
But Malfoy’s scheme to avoid Harry at all costs kept going for the next week.
It was a good Christmas, if weird and different than any other holidays Harry had spent with the Weasleys. He opened Malfoy’s present last; it was a book about the Potters, dating from the early sixteenth century, with glossy pictures of influential family members. Harry flipped to the end to see his father, smiling roguishly up at him with bright hazel eyes, and his mother on the next page, rolling her eyes in his father’s direction and smirking. The last page was him, a post-war picture of him accepting his Order of Merlin, First Class. Harry had been annoyed at the press for showing up then and hadn’t cared much about the award either, and you could tell. He looked unhappy and curled up in himself, shoulders slumping and eyes searching, he knew, for Ron and Hermione. He stared at it for a long time, and went back to study the rest of the pictures of his family. He didn’t know how to thank Malfoy.
“What?” Malfoy looked up and followed Harry’s gaze to the door, where Mrs. Norris had appeared, watching them suspiciously. He paled.
“I,” Harry said. “That’s not – that’s not the
Harry repeats incredulously, tramping down his urge to laugh.
“They don’t like me,” Malfoy hisses.
“Easy,” Harry said aloud and the mirror remarked saucily back, “How long are you going to keep staring at yourself?”
Harry winced and covered his face with his hands. “Please don’t tell me anymore.”
They watched Teddy and Malfoy for a few moments.
, and can’t quite manage it, somehow. Malfoy had told him not to call him that the first time he’d tried.
“Um,” Malfoy said, straightening, looking apprehensive and eager, “I did, yes.”
He knocked on the bathroom door.
“Hi, Harry,” she said, walking over to him. “Can I sit here?” When he nodded, she sat down in the chair across from him. If she was surprised to see him she didn’t show it.
“And also,” continued Malfoy, his voice stronger, “I found your suffering amusing.”
Harry scowled, opening his mouth, but Daphne said, “She’s a bit like you, Pans, I quite like her.”
“You’re right,” Dean says. “Thanks.” He starts to walk past Harry, and then halts abruptly. “I feel like this is the time to tell you something.”
“I dunno,” Harry would say, shrugging. He didn’t know. It was just – entertaining, a little, to listen to Malfoy’s rants. Malfoy had listened to Harry, so Harry listened to him, whether he was talking about the quality of coffee in Hogwarts or how it was absolutely insane to be turning against the Dark Lord. He didn’t like Malfoy, he hated him still for being the first person to call Hermione a Mudblood and for bullying everyone in sight. But sometimes he would forget that Malfoy was an awful person, and it was, he thought, because of Malfoy’s steady stream of bored commentary in lessons.
and Side-Along’s Harry and Hermione both to Hogsmeade. Apparition makes Harry feel sick even when he’s sober, so he’s faintly impressed that he hasn’t thrown up.
“You’re wearing mine,” Harry says defensively. He’d just thought that it would help the illusion that he and Malfoy are in love if he wore Malfoy’s ring.
Ginny had said it easily, like it would make sense: “Are you in love with Malfoy?” He thought about Ron saying,
“Honey,” came the sound of Malfoy’s voice in the background over running water, “d-du-du du du du. Ohhhhh, sugar sugar. Da da da something something something.”
“Potter,” Malfoy said, taking a deep breath. “Since you probably only remember half of these people, that’s Blaise, Daphne, Theo, Greg, Millie, and Pansy.”
Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Pansy and Blaise all laugh.
“What for?” Harry says indignantly.
“Am not,” Malfoy argues.
Ron gives him an amused look, then Apparates himself and Hermione out of Hogsmeade and back to their home.
“I’d rather not go,” said Susan, looking very unhappy. “There’s only my parents and I left, and we’ve been a mess lately – ”
“Most likely.”
sometimes. It’s an Indian sweet. Not as good as my mother’s, but.” She shrugged. “Do you want some?”
Hermione and Ron stared at him, and Zabini scoffed out loud. But he thought Malfoy was smiling, a bit, no malice in his expression. He had never seen Malfoy smile like that before.
And then fucking Pansy Parkinson Floos them. When all this is over, Harry is adding Pansy and Dean’s names to Malfoy’s
“That’s Harry-speak for, we slept together but I don’t remember anything about it,” Ginny translates. “You’re such a floozy.”
Ron hesitated, and then nodded, disappearing into his and Anthony’s room with a
He was glad when the holidays came to an end and he, Ron, and Ginny Apparated into Hogsmeade and walked towards the castle, bundled up in cloaks and Warming Charms.
“Well, they don’t
“Pans,” Blaise said in an undertone, aiming a smile over at Harry. Malfoy stiffened beside him. “Harry. How is Miss Weasley?”
“I see,” Andromeda said. Harry waited in dread but all she did was welcome them in to the sitting room.
“Haha, yeah,” said Ron unconvincingly. “Look, Harry. You know how you are with Malfoy.”
“This is Draco Malfoy,” Harry said to Andromeda hastily. “He’s, er, staying with me for the hols.”
you,” said Malfoy.
Malfoy was cold, and pale. Harry wanted to kiss him forever and ever, wanted him here, right here, and then he made the mistake of breaking away from him. He looked at him and looked at him, and he didn’t think he could ever get enough. Malfoy smiled at him, reached up to smooth down Harry’s hair, a fool’s task, and then he froze.
Okay, so he’d kissed Malfoy, and wanted to do it again, and again. That didn’t mean he liked Malfoy in a romantic way. He wasn’t even sure whether he liked Malfoy in a non-romantic way. They’d sort of started living out of each other’s pockets by accident, and then kept on doing it. For the most part, Harry thought that they couldn’t stand each other, but also that they’d die for each other.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “You know one?”
“No, we are disgusting,” Malfoy said, but he leaned into the touch, “we are not even human beings right now. I am verklempt. I can’t believe we didn’t make it to the bed.”
“They were still a work of art,” Malfoy said smugly.
Harry went inside his room, navigating around the door carefully and closing it behind him. He tossed his robes on the bed and thought about changing out of the t-shirt and jeans beneath, but couldn’t be arsed. He lied down on the settee with his legs spread out, dangling over the end, and his head resting on the sofa the other way, by the open window. He listened to the chill of the wind rustling the leaves of the trees below. He thought about Draco Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy opened the door to their room.
engaged, Pansy, stop screaming at me.”
Blaise laughed and swung an arm over Harry’s shoulder. “Duly noted. You know, you’re alright, Harry Potter.”
He couldn’t sleep that night, but when he looked over, Malfoy was asleep, mumbling a load of gibberish and breathing softly, sleeping on his back in a starfish position like he’d always needed to fill up a too-big bed. Harry didn’t want to wake him up. He creeped out of the room instead, downstairs to the empty common room, and sat in one of the armchairs by the fireplace with his legs pulled up. Malfoy would have said he was brooding.
“What was that about my eyes?” Harry said, pulling away and grinning.
Remus already knows, thinks Harry darkly. He just wants to make Harry
“Oh...you didn’t say anything special, you only told us you were ‘going out for dinner with Malfoy’.”
Malfoy screamed bloody murder and started laughing hysterically, which made Harry start laughing hysterically, at least until Malfoy aimed a kick at him that sent him sprawling to the floor.
He came out of the bathroom in flannel pyjama bottoms that had belonged to Dudley when he was eleven and only remotely fit Harry now, and a Holyhead Harpies T-shirt that Ginny had bought him. Thinking of Ginny didn’t make things any easier, but at least Malfoy had already gotten into bed and wasn’t looking at him. Harry tried not to look at him either, and made his way over to his bed.
,” Malfoy remarked to no one in particular.
Maybe he was rooming with Ron. He could hope, at least. Neville, Dean, or Seamus, or one of the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs would be fine too, but – Harry’s stomach flipped. It wasn’t going to be – McGonagall wouldn’t –
“You go first,” murmurs Harry, giving a pile of snow a half-hearted kick as they continue walking.
at least,” and Harry told them both to fuck off, he’d last the whole year. They went down to breakfast still laughing. They joined Ginny, and though it was a bit awkward with her and Harry, when they told her about Malfoy she threw her head back and laughed and laughed and laughed. Harry had always loved to watch Ginny laugh, the pale and freckled column of her throat, but he did not think they were going to get back together now or ever.
Harry tried to catch Malfoy’s foot and tickle it, and Malfoy screeched and pushed him away, nearly toppling over the chair in the process. The rest of the common room was watching them, but they seemed almost as resigned as Hermione had been.
Harry walks back to his and Malfoy’s flat slowly. There’s Honeydukes...he’d been so furious when he hadn’t been able to go in third year...and Zonko’s, Ron said George was thinking about finally buying the shop... snow crunches under Harry’s feet and snowflakes are falling rapidly into his eyes, onto his glasses. He leans his head back and lets one fall into his mouth, the way his Muggle classmates used to. Sometimes the beauty of Hogsmeade will catch him unawares, this place of his childhood and this place where he now lived. Now is one of those moments. He looks at the shops, twinkling and decorated lavishly with Christmas lights, and the people flitting in and out, laughing and talking the whole while, and feels something akin to peace. Or maybe he’s just drunk.
On December 5th, Narcissa Malfoy walks into their flat with her head held high and eyes narrowed.
, and his mother said
Harry looks with horror at the direction of Dean’s gaze – Harry and Malfoy’s ring fingers, which each sport marching rings: Harry’s silver and probably extremely expensive, and Malfoy’s silver with a bottle-green gem which Harry had only gotten because it reminded him of his mother. How is Harry supposed to explain that Malfoy is a Slytherin and therefore he has terrible, convoluted plans and he forced his ring onto Harry’s hand and stole Harry’s ring all because he didn’t have any Muggle money and he wanted cake, specifically free wedding cake?
Harry says, “Challenge accepted.”
“Now that you’re here, we can go meet my mother,” Malfoy says to Harry.
“Congratulations,” repeats Harry. “Er, for what, exactly?”
Harry considers telling Pansy that she promised him tea. He has a strange thought that he doesn’t want Ginny to be here, after all. He likes talking to Pansy.
The next day, Malfoy sat next to Harry in Potions, sneering at Ron and Hermione, who shot him looks of deep dislike and looked to Harry with bewilderment. Harry was too busy gaping to argue, or say anything, really.
Malfoy fixed him with a contemptuous look. “I’ve got to find her before Filch does. She is my pride and joy.”
who couldn’t handle it and was acting like Harry was –
“Stop laughing,” says Harry when they’ve stopped at last. His anger at Malfoy is, reluctantly, ebbing away, and his lips are twitching instead. “Oh my god. I
“What,” Harry said. “And what did you mean, when you said you lived through sixth year?”
“Do not say a word,” Ginny warned. “You’re the one all chummy with Draco Malfoy these days, he’s sending
Harry sat up.
“Really?” said Harry, amused.
As soon as he met Harry’s eyes he flinched like he wanted to look away but he stood firm. The first thing Draco Malfoy said to Harry in a year was a polite, “Would you like to use the bathroom first?”
“We’ll give them away to satisfy your Hufflepuff needs, then,” said Malfoy. “Now let’s go.”
“This is really unnecessary,” Harry said, tilting up his head so the blood wouldn’t drip on the floor.
“Oh,” Malfoy says, noticing the rain. “We should go. I didn’t mean to go on.”
“You’re going to remember to get me an autograph, aren’t you?” Ginny says.
“Pay attention, Potter,” Malfoy said, grinning at him, “I don’t want to win just because you’re distracted by my beauty.”
Harry beams. “Aw, babe.” He accepts the roses gracefully, and grabs hold of Malfoy’s robes, pulling him closer. He kisses Malfoy on the cheek and whispers, “Nice try,” in his ear. Out loud, he says, “I’ll see you at home, darling.”
“I’m a patron for all things Right and Just and Saintly, except for when I totally cheated in Potions, but I still never got in any trouble for that, because I’m loved by everyone – ”
The word is quiet and soft between them; a private thing, something no one else will ever know. That home is wherever Malfoy is.
“Did you know,” Malfoy continues, “I’ve wanted to kiss you since you wore that leather jacket in fifth year. It was maddening, actually. I don’t think it’s fair for people to be so attractive.”
“Oh, you’re one to talk,” Nott said.
Malfoy clears his throat. “You are,” he begins awkwardly, “also my. Best friend, I suppose.”
He swallowed. Like that was some kind of excuse.
“Bit of a weirdo,” Harry echoed, and smiled at her.
“They
“Unless you’re

, but instead he says, “Wait for him to come home so we can have a mature conversation about our feelings.”
“You absolutely could not. I am
Harry had already thought that was the case – Malfoy likes wearing Muggle clothing when he visits his father, because it scandalises him, but he always wears proper dress robes when he goes to meet his mother. Today he’s wearing jeans Harry is pretty sure Goyle, of all people, bought him, and a soft green jumper. He looks good. He always looks good.
Harry hadn’t expected coming back to be the same as it had been every year he’d come back before, but like always, coming back to Hogwarts felt like coming home. He felt himself go still and peaceful, too, at least until he thought about Malfoy.
Harry could have killed him or kissed him, proud, ridiculous Draco Malfoy. He said instead, “Draz?”
Harry hugged his knees and looked down. “It’s just a day. It doesn’t mean anything. It’s really – it’s only that I’ve realised how little I actually know about them. And there’s only two people in the world left who knew them well, at least as far as I know, and I don’t know if they’d know everything I want to ask. They used to have a cat, and I don’t know where it went. I don’t know how they celebrated Christmas or birthdays. I don’t know what – what their favourite songs were, what Quidditch teams they rooted for, how they fell in love. I don’t even know where my father’s family was
“I suppose you never did that.”
“Where are you going?” demands Malfoy imperiously.
When they had started walking back to the common room, Harry cleared his throat and said, “Thanks.”
“What
Malfoy’s smile is strained, but Harry thinks he and Neville are the only ones to notice. “Yes, honey bunch.”
Harry does his best to thank her, though his insides are twisting with regret. He hates lying to Hermione, and she’s so
Hogsmeade is practically deserted, not a soul in sight. Harry can see why as snow begins to fall gently around them, settling into Malfoy’s hair.
Harry sat back down and tried not to think about Malfoy in the shower, damp hair and sweet-smelling shampoo, droplets of water falling down his neck, because that was weird.
Harry thought irrationally of what Malfoy was doing for New Year’s, whether it was just him and his mother, which it must have been. Andromeda and Teddy were related to Malfoy, too. He wondered if they’d met.
“I don’t know,” Harry said.
So he had two problems: a sort-of attraction to Malfoy, and meddling friends who kept questioning his reasons for living with Malfoy.
“Because you’re
Kreacher did keep sobbing whenever he saw Malfoy, but he cleaned up the rooms until they were sparkling, and handed them plates of sandwiches and glasses of water while they cast cleaning spells on the rooms.
“You listen to terrifying songs!” Harry shouted at the bathroom door from his position at his desk, where he was trying to complete an essay for Potions. Beside the cup of coffee Malfoy had set out for him, totally ignoring the fact that Harry didn’t even like coffee that much, was the assigned reading from the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He’d already completed it. Harry thought Hermione would probably be proud that he was starting on homework due for Monday on Friday evening.
“That’s because your impressions were always of
“Actually, we weren’t,” Harry admits, figuring Dean deserves the truth.
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry called back, laughing. He looked at Malfoy and his smile faded. “Are you alright that they...know?”
“Can you find your way home?” Ron asks him, looking around at their surroundings with an expression close to nostalgia.
There were only sixteen of them, the last remnants of Harry’s year. The Gryffindors, seven of them in total, outnumbered everyone else: Padma Patil, Anthony Goldstein, Terry Boot, and Lisa Turpin from Ravenclaw, Justin Finch-Fletchley and Susan Bones from Hufflepuff, and the three Slytherins. They all stayed in their respective groups, casting uneasy glances at each other.
They sat in silence for a while, but Harry hadn’t felt awkward or uncomfortable in any way. He’d felt, instead, comforted, by Malfoy’s presence and that the reason for it was the same as his own. And he had fallen asleep after all, at that kitchen table, when he usually only felt safe enough to sleep in the same room as Ron and Hermione or Sirius and Remus.
Harry smiled back. He didn’t know how anyone could have done anything else.
“We should go,” he says again.
“Camille is my sister,” explains Dean to Harry, who belatedly remembers Dean’s host of half-siblings and reckons he should probably have made the connection, since this is a Muggle shop and Dean’s mentioned them before. Harry’s not really good with names, a fact Malfoy always makes fun of him for.
Harry looked at Malfoy and touched his mouth wonderingly.
“Hello,” Malfoy said, still smiling. “You idiot, you’ve got snow in your hair.”
“We can’t kidnap anyone either,” sulks Malfoy, “seeing as Thomas has already told everyone in the world, that’s isn’t any use, so there goes
“I dunno,” Harry said, sticking his hand out to feel the water. “I like the rain.”
“Could give it a shot,” Harry said. “Don’t think you’d be able to manage braiding my hair, though.”
“You’re very drunk,” Harry answers, pushing past the crowds of people around them and stepping outside. The night air is cool, blowing his hair in every which way. He breathes in. Breathes out. Nights like this are made for living.
was weird, with Malfoy, and – whatever.
“Hello,” Harry said weakly.
But when Harry arrives, Pansy is sitting on the steps leading up to the doors, holding an old-fashioned handkerchief that has the initials
, though in passing.”
“No, really.” Pansy turns to face him. “If you fuck this up, I’ll cut off your dick and chop it into a million pieces. So. Don’t fuck this up.”
Harry opened the door to his room just as someone on the other side opened it, and the door slammed right in the face, as well as hitting the person on the other side in their head, sending Harry stumbling back on the floor with a hand clutched to his head.
Harry is glad Malfoy never asked him. The answer is too complicated to put into words. That he’d been such a mess. That he hadn’t wanted Malfoy to see him that way. That he’d thought being alone was what he needed, but what he had needed was just the simple comfort of Sirius and Remus kissing his hair, or Ron and Hermione’s fierce embrace, or Ginny’s wild laughter – alive, alive – or Luna’s understanding silence, or most of all Malfoy needling him and poking him until he was human again. That he had been scared of his feelings for Malfoy. That he had not known if he was the same Harry Potter he had been before he died and came back.
?” Harry demanded. He could not believe he had thought Blaise was all right. Blaise was clearly not all right at all, he was a –
“Sounds good.” Dean gives Harry a cheerful goodbye and heads out of the kitchen, heedless of the bombshell he’s just dropped on Harry’s head. Harry spends a few more minutes in the kitchen, shaking his head and marveling at the fact that Dean used to have a crush on him and Seamus had glared at him for it and he hadn’t noticed. Then he pauses to wonder if Seamus had glared at him in sixth year because of
“What now,” snaps Malfoy.
“Is it,” Ginny said, arching her eyebrows at him.
“Aunt Walburga?” Malfoy said.
“It’s kind of a stupid reason. It was Malfoy’s idea, anyway,” Harry says.
, he couldn’t think of anything other than what he had lost: the feeling in his throat, the pricking of his eyes, the
“Er,” says Harry. “I’ll figure it out.”
Harry assumed his competition was Voldemort. This was further proof that Malfoy was actually incredibly mad.
“It’s not that funny,” says Harry, crossing his arms. He turns to Malfoy and suggests, “Luna?”
Zabini stared at him for a few moments. “Oh, Merlin. It’s worse than I thought. If I could only have told myself this before. I’m sure it would have been a bright spot in a sea of darkness, or perhaps another dark spot in a sea of darkness. Either way it would have been hilarious.”
,” Malfoy despaired, “you don’t understand. You like saving people, I know you do, and I might as well say it since we both know it’s true, that you saved me – but that doesn’t mean you – ” His voice stumbled. “Love me, or – we
Hermione took over. “That isn’t what we meant, Harry. Obviously, we still think Malfoy is an unpleasant little bastard – ”
“No, I don’t,” Harry snarled back, “I don’t want to
Under no circumstances was it easy, living with Malfoy. When was anything with them ever easy? No, it wasn’t easy. Malfoy had a habit of leaving a mess everywhere he went, because he was used to people cleaning up after him without him asking. They had a few fights about that. Malfoy always needed to have dinner at a specific time, and breakfast at a specific time, but he considered lunch basically useless. He slept an insane amount, but sometimes he drank a ridiculous amount of coffee and stayed up ridiculously late, doing something equally ridiculous like writing an article or making a potion or practicing Charms they’d learned in school – as though Flitwick was going to spring an exam on them at any second. He was always singing along to songs on his Muggle telly at the top of his volume. But the worst part was that Harry found all of these things endearing, and he got used to them quickly.
Malfoy looks like he’s about to laugh himself silly and this is ridiculous, so Harry grabs his hand, tells Dean, “We’re not actually engaged,” and runs out of the shop at breakneck speed.
Whatever Hermione said, living with Malfoy
Dean stifles a laugh. “I also, uh, wanted to tell you I’m really happy for you and Malfoy. And I’m sorry about last year, when – ”
So he had two solutions: dismiss his attraction to Malfoy as unimportant, and ignore Hermione’s advice.
“Alright, I did,” admits Harry. “I paid attention to Crabbe and Goyle too...sort of.”
“Who?” said Harry. “Ginny? She’s not my girlfriend. We broke up in the summer.”
,” Malfoy ranted, “and did he listen to me? No. Do you know how many people are taking his N.E.W.T class? Five! And I don’t think he’s even noticed!”
“You told me not to,” Harry says.
“Oh,” Malfoy had said. “So you can still make me breakfast every morning?”
“What?” Harry said, looking up from frowning at a mysterious stain on page 97. Malfoy had opened the wardrobe and was staring at its meagre content. “Er, some of them, yeah. Those clothes are from the summer.”
“You were being moody,” Harry says.
“Er,” Harry says. They’d proposed to each other at the same time, actually. Harry had set up a private dinner in one of Malfoy’s favourite, fancy restaurants, had gotten on one knee, and Malfoy had screamed
“I’m glad,” said Ginny, and threw her arms around him.
“I’ve already been threatened about hurting Malfoy twice,” Harry said, “so there’s really no need for – ”
He had tried to approach the topic with Malfoy. In hindsight, he wished he hadn’t, or had at least picked a more crowded place to talk to him. At the time, Harry had figured the secluded, empty Quidditch pitch was a perfect place, and he’d been itching to fly anyway, so he’d suggested a match with Malfoy.
────────────
Sirius and Remus are what Harry likes to call
“Absolutely not,” Malfoy says at once.
“Another Slytherin lost to a Gryffindor,” mourned Malfoy, still looking at Blaise and Ginny with a small smile playing on his lips. “Pansy’ll murder him.”
Blaise nodded seriously, as if taking note of this.
When Malfoy went to his Arithmancy class, he went out to look at the statues: the queen’s serene expression, the knight’s devoted pose.
“No, we’ll work our way up to that,” said Malfoy dismissively. “We’ll go to a Muggle place.”
He thought about asking Malfoy to fall asleep together again, but he couldn’t imagine actually asking for that, even if he phrased it like a – an arrangement for the good of their ability to focus on class, or something. It was fine. The company, he thought, worked too.
Harry stares at her, ignoring the latter part of her statement. “What? When did I tell you?”
He could hear Luna talking to Malfoy about Wrackspurts and his careful responses behind them. Ginny looked thoughtful beside him. Things felt a lot easier between them now that they weren’t pretending to be something they weren’t.
“I think I’ve almost got it,” Hermione said, and for a second Harry felt chilled, like he had almost understood something too, but then Hermione went on. “And I suppose Malfoy did apologise to me.”
Anthony was still passed out on one of the couches, but Susan was sitting next to him reading a book, so it was probably fine. Harry didn’t see Ron or Hermione, and he didn’t really want to think about what they were doing with a private room. Ginny and Luna must have gone down to breakfast, or, he thought bitterly, they hadn’t been awoken rudely by Blaise Zabini, who was lazily reclining on a sofa and flirting with Susan.
Malfoy’s eyes go wide. “The one with robots?” He pronounces the word
That night, they didn’t sleep on the settee, but Malfoy talked as he got into bed, and Harry fell asleep with the comforting sound of his voice still ringing in his ears. Malfoy was fascinating, he always had been, even when he’d been fascinatingly horrible. Harry fell asleep now trying to figure him out the way he had fallen asleep trying to figure out every new problem the world had thrown at him: prickly, pointy, perplexing Malfoy. It was something to concentrate on, without any of the fear and anxiety that any of the other things he’d needed to concentrate on involved.
Malfoy smiled weakly. He was not laughing anymore. He took off the glasses and turned them back into an empty glass.
Harry’s heart hurt. “Wow,” he managed to say dryly, “thanks for that advice, Malfoy.”
“That’s one word for it.”
“Professor Potter?”
in trouble,” which was true, and made something in Harry’s chest ache.
A flock of birds scattered away at the sound of his voice and Malfoy looked at him shocked, like someone had suddenly hit him. “You don’t. You can’t,” he said, and reached one hand out like he wanted to touch Harry but let it fall to the side.
Harry almost says,
imagining the look on his friends’ faces when they realise how wrong they were is pretty amusing.
Harry froze too. He thought of Ginny. He thought
Adriana’s head snaps up. The side of her mouth turns up. “Is he really, Professor Potter?”
you if they ever – ”
He had only two nightmares, which was better than usual. One of them was Dumbledore’s body falling off the Astronomy Tower, which turned into Fred, which turned into Lupin, which turned into Tonks, and he rushed down to catch them but they were gone before they hit the ground.
“I wasn’t quite sure until this year,” Hermione said, as though this was supposed to be reassuring.
“Wait,” Harry says, mouth dry.
Ron was right, Harry thought. It was better that Malfoy was always either asleep or out of the room. What else had he expected? That they would fight over who went to the bathroom first, argue over keeping the lights on or off, windows open or closed? That they would spell each other’s hair pink in the night, spill cold water all over each other’s bed in the morning? That it would be unbearable not to bother each other? And what had
He looked out at the sky, thought about Malfoy disarming Dumbledore on this tower and Malfoy laughing into his collarbone in his bed.
“Did they appreciate the fact that I managed to make her play the Dirty Dancing soundtrack at all? No, Potter. They did not.”
Only, not in Malfoy’s company.
school.”
Harry tore his gaze away. “Sorry, mate,” he told Ron, and smothered a grin. “Want to punch me to make things even?”
, it won’t work because after Blaise and Daphne kept Silencing it I cast another spell on so no one could – ”
Harry chewed on the end of his quill and sang under his breath, “You are my candy girl,” until he realised what he was doing and stopped, appalled.
“That simply proves my – Daphne’s point. However, she talked about you constantly, and so we all had to suffer through her knowledge, and now we have it memorised. I’m sure Blaise knows your genealogy too. We all did. She couldn’t help herself.”
“C’mon,” Harry murmured, lifting up his trunk and going over to the others, because he didn’t think he could stand to be here. “Let’s find a compartment.”
about?”
It was like they could really live here, the two of them. Like this was their home.
. When Malfoy got a question right and he turned around to smirk all self-satisfied at Harry, Harry rolled his eyes back. When the bell rang, he waited for Malfoy to gather all his things. When Malfoy smiled he smiled back, and he thought, for a second,
Harry traced the lines of Malfoy’s palm and grinned back.
Harry pulls on a shirt and goes to meet Luna, possibly finding out why she is in their kitchen at eleven o’clock or possibly not. You never know with Luna.
Harry shrugged again. “I don’t know. It didn’t seem like a big deal. Most of those clothes are Dudley’s. Er, my cousin. Those were the ones my aunt and uncle gave me as a kid.”
Malfoy was staring at him, eyes open and incredibly grey.
better way, and then they’d started arguing about who was better at proposing, and then they’d made out. Neither of them even have a ring; they’ve both been wearing each other’s since Malfoy proclaimed them as an engaged couple to Dean’s sister. “I think you should just be yourself. Seamus loves you.”
Malfoy looked at him for a long time and then he leaned over and kissed Harry, once, lightly, soft. And it was
“Hello, Harry, Draco,” Luna said, drifting towards them. “I like your hair, Harry. Are you going to keep it like that?”
After that, classes fell in their predictable rhythm. Everyone was so busy frantically studying for exams in a month and a half, and trying to keep up with their workload, that no one seemed to notice when Malfoy and Harry sat in the same chair, when they held hands on the way to class or played with each other’s hair (whatever Malfoy had said, Harry had a sneaking suspicion he liked Harry’s hair the way it was). Both of them were hardly in their room most of the time, and they didn’t have much time for anything more than kissing.
They found Franny – the gramophone, in an empty classroom, under the desk. Malfoy bent down to caress her – it – horrifyingly, and Harry leaned against the desk, long-suffering.
and once Malfoy stopped jumping and looking at Luna like she was about to cast a Jelly-Legs hex on him, he joined in hesitantly. He listened to Luna and did not say a thing about some of the more outrageous theories, and just kept offering to refill her pumpkin juice. Harry wanted to snap at Malfoy that giving Luna juice wasn’t going to make up for having held her prisoner, but he trusted Luna. She knew what she was doing. And Malfoy was trying, so obviously hard. He didn’t see how no one else could tell.
I looking at here?” said Zabini’s voice, amused, and Harry’s eyes snapped open.
“Harry,” said Hermione, folding her hands in her lap and staring at him in an incredibly frightening way. “Would you, perhaps, like to explain the Draco Malfoy situation to us now?”
Harry startled at this. “Well, I don’t know, it’s not that hard. I mean, it is hard,” he amended. “Kids don’t make sense a lot of the time, but they’re honest. You just have to be patient with them. Go ask him about his drawing.”
“That’s amazing,” Harry says.
“We’re not
“We really couldn’t, you can try yourself – ”
“What are you talking about,” Harry said, alarmed. “Nothing really happened with Dean and I do not
“Well, I never swore not to be friends with you,” Harry admitted. “I did think of you as my archenemy in second year, if that makes you feel better.”
“Oh, I know,” said Malfoy darkly.
Malfoy, his back to Harry and his wand in the air as he repaired the chandelier, said, “I don’t know. I just liked it. I suppose it reminded me of dance lessons when I was a child. They were obviously never like that, but it was similar.”
Malfoy says, “Don’t say things like that.”
doing well for yourself, aren’t you, Queenie?” Pansy said, smirking. “Sharing a room with a Gryffindor.”
This is the worst possible moment for the owner of the shop, Camille, to come over and beam at Harry and Malfoy brightly.
“You’re allowed to ruffle my hair,” says Harry, “and you do it all the fucking time.”
He shouldn’t have said it like that. He shouldn’t have said it at all, but if he had – he should have planned it out, explained –
“Hi,” Malfoy says. To Harry’s delight, he seems
“Oh, and I suppose this has nothing to do with Parvati Patil,” Theodore Nott murmured.
Malfoy’s hair was rumpled and his clothes were disheveled and he had pillow creases on his face. It was obviously not adorable, because it was Malfoy, but if it wasn’t. Well.
“I don’t know if it was the right thing,” Harry said. “Now. Now, I don’t – sometimes I wish I didn’t come back. I don’t think it’s fair that I got to come back when so many other people didn’t, that I got to come back when there have been loads of times I wish I hadn’t.”
“I don’t see why that has any effect on you,” Malfoy said airily, “but I suppose so.”
“It’s not even eleven yet, Potter. And I thought you said you didn’t have a concussion?”
like you. You know who I am, so why are you still here?”
Harry stayed in bed and smiled.
“You had a crush on Bill, Ginny, and Malfoy.” Ron crossed his arms. “But not me? I thought I was your best mate.”
“I wanted to be,” says Ginny, as though that’s a perfectly valid explanation.
And Harry soared up into the air with Malfoy just behind him, a stray breeze lifting Malfoy’s hair and the sun casting a gold light on his face.
heartening,” Malfoy said, disgruntled, “you don’t hate me anymore because you’re
“I was dreaming about the war,” Harry said, though he wasn’t sure why he was confiding in Malfoy. “And dying.”
He thought that this wasn't supposed to happen, shouldn't have happened. He thought he wanted to do it again, so badly it hurt. He could see his thoughts reflected on Malfoy’s face. They were nothing to each other, nothing, and yet. And yet.
“I really wish everyone would leave me alone so I could live out the rest of my life as a hermit in peace,” said Malfoy loudly, pushing his glasses up on his nose. The Quidditch jab had probably stung. “Oh, did you want another autograph? Anything for my fans.”
“Oh?” Harry grinned. “Are you scared?”
Ron looked stung. “Am I not a catch?”
“Merlin, Potter, didn’t I just tell you I didn’t want to talk about it?” Pansy sighs. She tells Harry anyway. “Padma left. She’s angry with me.”
“The point is,” Hermione persevered, “are you sure it’s a good idea to live with him?”
“Understand?” Harry echoed.
“Right,” says Malfoy, his voice suddenly cold and faraway. “Maybe you should have Zabini be your pretend boyfriend, then.”
“The Potters originated from Pakistan but they settled in Britain ages ago. Your grandfather, Fleamont Potter, bit of an unfortunate name, really, got famous and increased the family gold off hair potions. He married your grandmother, Euphemia Shafiq, after graduation. The Potters weren’t ever on the Sacred Twenty-Eight, but the Shafiqs were, so despite all that prattle about equality and blood status, it was a coup for Fleamont. There are a couple of Potters related to the Malfoys, very distantly, and the Blacks, too; Dorea Black and Charles Potter come to mind. Your father’s favourite Quidditch team were the Wimbourne Wasps, excellent choice in my opinion. If I’m not mistaken, your mother supported the Appleby Arrows, and you know, there was a bitter rivalry between the two teams so that’s – ”
“Why didn’t you like him?” Harry says, wondering if they need anything else. They probably do. Wondering if they
“Wrong password,” the knight intoned.
Harry tries not to gape at him and changes the subject hastily to Percy’s new girlfriend. When the time comes for him to go home, he’s pleasantly buzzed, all thoughts of Malfoy almost completely driven from his mind and feeling extremely fond of Ron and Hermione, who are the best friends anyone could ask for.
“Ginny,” repeated Pansy incredulously.
But he
“Leave it, then!”
Hermione kept going, though her eyebrows were raised now. “But he’s really unimportant now, with everything that’s happened. We’re only trying to make sure you’re happy.”
Harry spent his Christmas break fixing up Grimmauld Place. He told Malfoy he would live there for the summer, and Malfoy had said, “That house belongs to me as much as it does to you.
“Malfoy, turn it – ” Harry trailed off. “Malfoy.”
and find Malfoy but Malfoy had already disappeared, presumably gone down for breakfast. Disappointed, but resolved not to give Ron and Hermione anything to exchange meaningful looks about, Harry waited a bit for them to come down, and they did soon enough, one after the other, probably because they’d been worried about him.
Malfoy huffed out a quiet laugh. “You know, I swore a solemn oath to never break our mutual enmity in first year. I had Pansy, Greg, and – ” His voice stumbled. “And, and Crabbe, witness it. On pain of bloody, merciless death.”
didn’t figure it out till Easter,” Ron told him. “Only, then you were hanging out with Malfoy at Teddy’s birthday party, and you spent all of Easter break with him, and every letter was just full of mentions about him – Ginny told me she’d known since Christmas.”
“I invited Girl Weasley,” says Pansy after a moment. “To make you feel more at home. I also quite enjoy her company. I planned on easing you in. Girl Weasley one week, more Slytherins the next. She, however, had a Quidditch game to play.”
“Er,” Harry said. “I get hot at night.”
“I like it,” Harry said, because it made him feel less alone, and reminded him of Shell Cottage. Malfoy muttered something about how of course he did.
Malfoy was frowning. “What, like you’re not alive the rest of the time? Are you secretly an Inferi, Potter? Are you – ooh, from one of those Muggle films, a zombie?”
“The party won’t be complete without you,” Zabini said, voice extremely sarcastic.
kisses
Neville squints at him. “Really? Well, either you or Malfoy better hurry up and propose. Our betting pool is getting cold by now.”
like Black!”
, and it feels like they should probably have crossed this point a long time ago.
each other, all I do is insult you, and I am – don’t you understand what I’m like? I’m irritating and I talk too much and I’m not
“I’ve always heard Gryffindors keep their promises but I will hold you to that,” said Zabini, setting the bottle in Harry’s free hand before exiting with a wink. Harry winced at the sound of the door closing.
“Pans, I swear I did this already,” Blaise said, exasperated, “and unless you want Draco coming back and killing us – ”
Harry swallows. “Er. I wanted to tell you both that I’m in a relationship with Malfoy.” Malfoy nudges him sharply, probably to make fun of his terrible conversation skills and to shame him for calling his supposed boyfriend by his last name. Harry nudges him back.
Harry offers him a smile and a shrug. “You took it.”
Ginny laughed again, but her ears had gone red. “I missed you.”
But right now, it was easy enough to play with her and laugh when Seamus lost spectacularly, and share Chocolate Frogs with Ron like they were eleven years old again.
He waited for Malfoy to sneer at him or insult the Weasleys and Hermione or ask Professor McGonagall if they could change rooms, or just change rooms without asking and shut him out completely. He didn’t. He was still incredibly annoying, of course.
, they aren’t
that?” said Harry, grinning. “
Hermione sighs impatiently. “You slept with Rafael, at a time when Malfoy was feeling abandoned by you. Rafael is an attractive, famous Quidditch player. How much more do you need me to spell out for you? You
Malfoy never said he wanted to leave. Harry never said he wanted Malfoy to leave. If he’d hoped that more proximity to Malfoy would have made him annoyed, sick of Malfoy, enough to give up on this ridiculous feeling – he’d been wrong.
“ – and so you see we’ve only been dating for a few weeks, and we aren’t engaged, though, I’m holding out hope.” Harry tries a bashful smile.
“He asked me,” Harry said, closing the door before Malfoy could answer. He took a quick shower, and after he felt like a clean, hygienic human being, he opened the door into Malfoy’s face.
...it was different. And knowing that Malfoy was somewhere in the crowd made him flush and hear Malfoy’s cold, scornful voice drawling out, “
On impulse – which was the way Harry did most things – Harry slipped his hand into Parvati’s and when she looked up at him, she smiled, a bit reluctantly.
Malfoy kept stealing Harry’s food and he casually leaned against Harry, who sat sideways so he could talk to Malfoy more easily, though Malfoy was only talking about how plebeian and awful it was that he’d slept on the sofa. It wasn’t like Harry couldn’t see the shock and horror on everyone else’s faces. It was just that it didn’t seem to matter. Neither did the fact that he’d missed his classes, or that his back still ached from last night. He didn’t feel tired for the first time he could remember since – since before the war, probably.
“Roses are my favourite flower,” Harry says, squirming a little inside. Had it been strange to keep the flowers? They were a reminder of his mortification in front of his class, so maybe it was. “Not that you’d know.”
“Professor?” Harry said.
“McGonagall could’ve set up her Floo for us again,” Ron said bitterly as they trudged through the snow, but Harry saw his shoulders settle down as soon as he saw the castle’s looming towers. Hermione had said she was coming back today too.
“Of course that’s Blaise,” Malfoy said, and then, faintly, “and all of our year, as well as Luna and Ginevra, apparently.”
Ginny frowns at him. “C’mon, have a heart.”
Malfoy was silent for a moment. “Yes.”
“Not only can you not carry me, we will slip and fall and
“Alright, it works, turn it off,” said Harry, his elbows on the desk.
“You listen to terrifying songs,” Harry told him again, because it always deserved to be said. “You’ve traumatised me for life.”
Malfoy shrugs again, lolling his head back. The lime lighting casts a yellow, artificial glow on his face. “Are we going to the pub tonight?”
────────────
“Ron,” said Hermione reprovingly. “You know, Harry, I’m sure Professor McGonagall would understand that you’d feel more comfortable with Ron – ”
He woke up in the night sweaty and shaking from a nightmare, a bad one about Voldemort, with Mad-Eye shrieking, “CONSTANT VIGILANCE,” at him and the dead of Hogwarts resting on the tables in the Great Hall. Malfoy moved his head to press against Harry’s shoulder and said, “Shhh,” softly, over and over, stroking Harry’s hair until he had fallen asleep again.
Malfoy was not looking at him at all. “I don’t mind that she knows.”
Zabini kindly ignored this and went on, “My point is that living with him is no drink in Diagon. It’s annoying.”
Harry blinked and saw him go inside with the password Daphne had said before. Then it was just him and Malfoy standing in front of the door.
“I’ll just meet you in there, shall I,” said Anthony Goldstein uncomfortably, and he opened his and Ron’s door, slipping inside.
Malfoy pokes him in the shoulder. Harry is practically carrying him. “Why are we going?”
Hermione nods her head and stands up. “Good.”
Harry looks down at his hand. Apparently this ring holds more sentimental value than he’d first thought. Malfoy must really love cake.
“No one’s judging you or pitying you,” said Ron in a low voice. “Not us. Never us.”
“Almost!” Malfoy hollered, which could mean anything from one minute to one hour.
“I’m avoiding Luna.”
“You can’t
There was an unreadable look in Malfoy’s eyes. Harry’s fingers twitched.
“Yes,” Harry says. “I’ll get my coat.”
“Ah,” Hermione says, and sits down on the couch. Probably she’s sitting on top of the List. Harry doesn’t have time to worry about that.
“I can smirk,” Harry murmurs sulkily. Then, he adds, “Hermione and Ron have known that I’m also completely head over heels for you since sixth year. Apparently I talked about you a lot, and was kind of stalking you.”
Usually when Malfoy had nightmares Harry was already awake.
, and Harry had thought with a pang of shame of what Remus would say if he just left Malfoy bleeding in a bathroom – bleeding
“My school doesn’t, um, allow technology, remember,” Malfoy said.
Thankfully Malfoy did not seem to be paying attention. “You’re,” he started, looking lost. “
“I don’t know what you are,” Zabini said. “All I know is that you come to school and Professor McGonagall puts you in a room with Draco, which is bad enough, but you both manage to keep a cordial relationship. More than I expected. Then all of a sudden you’re best friends and you spend half your time together and I find you cuddling with each other. Maybe you can understand my confusion.”
. First there’s Cho Chang. But she’s got a boyfriend, so you go with Parvati Patil to the Yule Ball, who, by the way, had a crush on you for all of fourth year until you took her to the ball and spent the whole time glaring over at Cho Chang, culminating in you and Weasley ditching the
“Maybe this is a dream,” says Malfoy, then: “I’ve had dreams about you sucking my dick.”
Malfoy’s thumb moved in a reassuring pattern along Harry’s palm before he let go. “I said it’s alright.”
“How do you know Luna doesn’t like you back?” interjects Malfoy.
“Dirty Dancing,” Malfoy proclaimed with a flourish.
“But I can’t be bothered to hate you now,” Harry said. “Not anymore.”
was probably the one with brain damage. Harry stopped and tried to examine Malfoy’s forehead.
Now there was this: getting drunker than Harry did after a few pints. (So, Harry’s tolerance was pretty low. Not everyone drank a lot of alcohol. Some people were busy saving the world, okay, Malfoy?)
“Good, because I had to deal with Pansy today,” says Harry, instead of saying something embarrassing like
“Harry, Draco,” he says, after hugging Harry tightly enough to cut off his circulation, and shaking Malfoy’s other hand. His gaze moves to their intertwined hands, and he raises an eyebrow in true Remus fashion, but says nothing, only invites them in. Sirius comes out of the kitchen to greet them with narrowed eyes and stiff composure. He’s also wearing his pyjamas, and his hair is pulled back into a chaotic bun, but he doesn’t insult Malfoy, and Malfoy refrains from insulting
“Well, finally,” Malfoy says, ceasing his tapping and uncrossing his arms. He’s still scowling, and he’s dressed to impress, as Malfoy usually is – wizarding robes, today, in a brilliant shade of Slytherin green.
“Oh, do
“How did you manage that, though?” Blaise asked interestedly, leaning over. “Was it your own natural charm?”
They weren’t strictly meant to be wandering the halls even during their free periods, but Harry was swinging their joined hands back and forth, and the corridors were mostly empty except for a couple of students who mostly scuttled away when they caught sight of Harry and Malfoy.
It’s Harry’s turn to blush.
Harry frowned. “Why wouldn’t it matter?”
The sooner the end of Easter holidays approached, the more restless Harry got. He didn’t want to leave. Leaving meant they’d be having exams, and after that, he’d have no choice but to decide what he was going to say in response to that Auror letter in his trunk.
“She didn’t even finish her breakfast,” Malfoy says into the silence, and then they both start laughing.
Harry squinted down and saw them: Ginny riding on Blaise’s back, Neville and Justin and Susan looking a bit embarrassed, Seamus cat-calling at them with his arms around Dean, Luna clapping vaguely, Ron and Hermione looking pleased for him as well as averting their eyes, Daphne and the Patil twins with sunhats to cover their hair from the sun, Terry and Lisa and Anthony holding brooms. They were all holding brooms, actually, except for Daphne, Parvati, Justin, and Hermione.
to insult Potter.”
“No concussion,” she announced, “for either of you. Now go straight to bed, please, and refrain from slamming into anymore doors.”
to come. The night won’t be much fun without him, but.
“Oh, come on, Pans,” Blaise said pityingly, “I already talked to him – ”
“That’s fine,” Hermione says, her smile indulgent now. “Have a good night, Harry.”
“And – ” Harry hesitates. “Maybe your family should know that the so-called Saviour of the Wizarding World is a flaming poof himself.” The Fawleys, he remembers, are an old pureblood wizarding family.
Sirius hadn’t wanted anything to do with Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He’d given it to Harry, and Harry hadn’t wanted it either – but Kreacher was better nowadays, and he’d felt guilty about leaving the house so empty. The solution had fallen into his lap easily – a second year had confessed to him that he was scared of going back home, where his mother would insult him and his father would drink all day.
Malfoy’s face did something strange. He looked at Harry carefully, and said abruptly, “Alright.”
“Yeah.” Harry’s laughter died in his throat. “And he. Well, he doesn’t feel the same, so.” He blinked, twice.
“I’ll try,” Harry whispers back, and lets her go. Then, again, there’s nothing left to do except wait for Malfoy, who was also talking to his smarter half (Pansy).
Malfoy preened. “I don’t see
Harry’s glasses immediately started clouding up in the warm atmosphere of The Three Broomsticks. Malfoy took them off and murmured a spell before handing them back to Harry, clearer than they’d been in probably a year, and continuing dragging Harry towards a secluded booth in the corner.
“Oh,” Harry said, and laughed.
“You’re not going to make a wish?” Harry asks, heart still thundering.
As if talking every minute of every day wasn’t enough, sometimes he started talking in his sleep, nonsense words that Harry couldn’t make heads or tails of but loved to make fun of. His favourite hobby was to insult Harry’s hair in the morning. He took elaborately long baths, locked himself in the bathroom and sang Muggle songs and old, awful pureblood drinking songs that got stuck in Harry’s head for days after.
“Doesn’t it bother you that Blaise is flirting with your girlfriend?” Malfoy asked, sidling up next to him.
“You don’t. Mind?”
“Um,” Malfoy said, chewing on his lip, “that’s not...I don’t think that would be a good idea.”
“Well,
He is totally, completely, head over heels in love with Draco Malfoy.
“Love, though,” Ron said finally. “Love is a lot.”
“What,” Malfoy said, eyes closed. “No...have your own. Stay away.”
“Malfoy, I am not going to a wizarding clothes store,” Harry said. “Everyone will try to mob me, and I don’t understand wizarding clothes that much anyway.”
“I’m not really engaged to Malfoy,” Harry says, just to make things clear. He may be deceiving everyone in his life by telling them he’s dating Malfoy, but at least he’s not pretending he’s getting married.
“I am never drinking again,” Malfoy proclaimed. “Oh my God. Why did I do that. Oh my God. You kissed Dean Thomas. Oh my God.”
“Oh,” Malfoy said.
“Draco, what in the name of Salazar are you doing?” Zabini demanded.
Harry frowned.
Malfoy’s been acting strange this whole day. First there was his inexplicable behaviour with Rafael, and then, when Harry had changed into his clothes for tonight, he’d been fidgety and had stared so long Harry had asked him what was wrong.
“I’ll come with you,” Harry insisted. “Er, if you want me to.”
“I’ve been meaning to ask you,” Blaise said casually, “do you think Ginevra Weasley would ever go for me?”
Malfoy looked touched. “That means a lot, Potter, especially considering my competition.”
“No,” Malfoy says, “but you do, so – ”
Ron looked puzzled. “I’m not wearing one?”
Harry could hear it falling from the open window in the dining room. He went to close it and found himself staring instead, breathing in the rain and looking at the grey landscape, buildings and people ducking their heads under umbrellas, rushing to get home. Malfoy found him there, still looking outside.
“I told Binns he needed to change his lesson plans in
“Yeah.” Harry stared out at the window. “I had to.”
Blaise said, “You see what I have to deal with? Pans, you have no idea how lucky we are that Draco did not share a dormitory with Harry Potter for six years. Every day I would have been locked out of the dorm while they had earth-shattering fights and screamed at each other until the next day, where they would have been attached at the hip again.”
The door opened noisily: Anthony Goldstein stumbled into the common room with his school bag slung across his shoulder. “Fell asleep in the library and Madam Pince chased me out with a feather duster, then Peeves tried dropping a water balloon on my head,” he announced to the room at large, looking around at everyone gathered in a semicircle on the staircases around Harry and Malfoy. “Er, what have you all been up to then?”
Harry gaped at her. “But how can you – no, I didn’t even
to know.”
you and Malfoy?” asked Hermione gently.
Someone knocked on the door; grateful for the reprieve from his essay, Harry stood up and opened the door to see an unusual grouping: Blaise Zabini, Parvati and Padma, and Susan Bones.
“Mentioned having dinner with Blaise.”
who is the reason that everyone in Harry’s life thinks he’s going to marry Draco Malfoy. But kidnapping Malfoy will ultimately accomplish nothing, except to convince his friends and family that he has some kinks to sort out. So while the blame, surely, lies with Malfoy, it’s Dean Thomas who Harry has to kidnap because it’s Dean Thomas who has just witnessed Harry trying free samples of wedding cake with Draco sodding Malfoy.
Malfoy stood up, too, stretching and yawning, rubbing at his eyes. He stumbled a bit into Harry, and Harry caught him at his elbow, and it felt good, just to touch someone. They stared at each other, laughing a bit awkwardly.
“Hermione,” Harry said, and didn’t know what to say. He couldn’t deny it. He was coming up on the edge here, almost there, almost there. He reached out to grasp her hand. “Hermione, you make me happy too. You and Ron. You know that, don’t you?”
. I’m not
“You don’t
When he looked behind him, Malfoy was smiling and smiling at him like he couldn’t help it. “You are,” he agreed.
Harry and Malfoy went into their room stumbling and yawning and humming Celestina Warbeck, to find Zabini spread out on Harry’s bed, asleep with his robes and shoes on. He looked like a model that had decided to take a nap mid-photoshoot.
“I can’t believe you like History of Magic,” Harry said, amused.
“We could – ” starts Malfoy hopefully.
planning on murdering these people.
Before Harry could answer him, Ginny leaped up from behind Luna with her red hair loose and falling down her back. She linked her arms around Luna’s neck and Luna reached up to hold her hands against Ginny’s absently.
“Not like
“I can’t show you. I need a partner.”
Harry shrugged again. “Be yourself?”
Harry touched his mouth and it came away red.
Harry sighed and rested his head against Malfoy’s shoulder, looking up at the brilliant blue of the sky. “Is that Blaise.”
,” said Malfoy, “fought on the opposite side of the war that you did, and hates you!”
It was hard to take the new professor seriously, since she trained Aurors and Harry had caught Death Eaters with her before, but she was a definite step-up from every other D.A.D.A professor Harry had ever had, except for Lupin, who would always remain Harry’s favourite teacher.
“Draco,” Hermione said loudly, moving her chair over towards them, “have you finished the Ancient Runes homework?”
Malfoy’s face did something strange, and he took out a sophisticatedly wrapped present in red that was very obviously a book. “Me too.”
“Oh, shut up,” Malfoy said, looking relieved.
He kissed Dean back, the desk digging into his back and the music ringing in his ears, curling his hand around the back of Dean’s neck. He thought, ridiculously, of Malfoy’s mouth, his throat when he swallowed or laughed, and kissed Dean harder like he needed to make up for that moment of mistaken notion, because he
“Exactly!” Malfoy hissed, casting a dark look back at Teddy, who was singing and drawing a picture. “I’ve missed two years of his birthdays! No presents, no money! He knows! He knows what I’ve done! Do you know what I would have done to a relative who ignored my birthday, Potter?”
“I’m trying to make up for it,” Malfoy told him, and Harry said, “I know.”
“What?” Malfoy says.
“Yes, but I didn’t believe you really meant it,” Malfoy said.
carefully.
“Ronald,” drawls Pansy, sipping at her drink elegantly, “you need to give up this insane obsession with that awful team. When you inevitably pop out another Weasley, you’ll pass your obsession onto the brat, and the poor kid doesn’t deserve the disappointment.”
and Malfoy casts a Heating Charm on some leftover curry to eat. And they settle onto the couch and watch Muggle pictures until Malfoy falls asleep, his mouth falling open and his head falling against Harry’s chest.
“This isn’t what it looks like,” says Harry as Dean Thomas pushes open the door of
“What are you doing?”
“You slept through all your morning classes,” Hermione said anxiously. “Oh, I knew we should have come here before! We checked in the morning but we – um.” Hermione cast a quick-silver glance at Malfoy, and looked embarrassed when she turned back to Harry. “We didn’t want to wake you up.”
“Er,” Harry says, racking his brains. “The Rudolph one?”
, you’re a tool, Blaise.”
“Research,” Harry repeated.
The rain falls faster, a steady beat drumming against Harry’s skin. Malfoy looks at him, almost wondering, and reaches out. He presses a palm against Harry’s cheek. Harry’s heartbeat quickens. He can’t breathe. Malfoy’s hand, gentle, ever gentle, brushes something away.
Harry shrugged, moving over to sit next to him and swinging his legs back and forth. “It makes me feel alive.”
“It’s weird,” Harry said, shrugging.
“The coffee-flavoured one was the best,” Malfoy interrupts, a beatific expression crossing his face.
“What,” says Harry.
“I’m not,” Harry says. I’m not leaving. He says, looking at Malfoy, whose nose is pink from the cold and lips are parted, “You’re beautiful.”
“You have snow in your eyelashes and you forgot your glasses,” Malfoy says, like he can’t help himself.
“Why?”
Harry had a brief moment in which he thought about Hermione introducing Malfoy to S.P.E.W. “
“Oh, for goodness sake,” said Malfoy in a low voice. “All that and you’re not going to leave? Your adoring fans are here, Potter, they’re waiting for you to leave so they can skin me alive and present me as a trophy to stick on your wall!”
Harry got out of bed silently to join him, and Malfoy offered him some coffee because apparently he was crazy and had stolen several cups of coffee from the kitchen and stored them in their bedroom.
“Of course I’m alright, you idiot,” Malfoy said, and grasped for his hand, ignoring Blaise and Daphne’s laughter. “We have terrible friends.”
When he and Malfoy came up together, Malfoy hesitated and Harry said, “Let’s just – ” and he nodded towards Malfoy’s bed and Malfoy looked relieved. They brushed their teeth together, making faces at each other in the mirror, which made fun of them back. They slept together again, and Harry didn’t have any nightmares. He woke up without Malfoy, with all his blankets tossed away and one sheet half-spread across him, and his hand outstretched towards the warmth where Malfoy had been before, a light breeze playing out from their window.
He was a little drunk, though he hadn’t had that much – not interested in losing control in front of everyone here. He hadn’t been raised sipping wine, though, the way most purebloods seemed to have been, and he was possibly more drunk than he had intended.
“So we’re what,” Harry asked thoughtfully, “dating?”
didn’t sound like a word anymore.
knew.
The moment Harry and Malfoy Apparate back to their flat, Hermione, who has either been waiting for them or has impeccable timing, comes marching up to them, eyes flashing and arms crossed in a frightening manner. Malfoy, next to Harry, inches away from her.
“Oi, fuck you, Harry.”
“You’re both disgusting,” says Blaise cheerfully, rearranging his hair artfully.
Hermione nodded. “To Ron and Neville as well. It doesn’t mean much, but it means a little. And you see, I’ve got a great deal to hate Draco Malfoy for. But I have to be grateful to him too.”
Dean Thomas, your ex-girlfriend’s ex-boyfriend and Seamus Finnegan’s best friend, kisses you.”
Ginny laughed and said, “Come on, Harry.” She let go of Luna to drag Harry up from the floor. Harry submitted good-naturedly, and when Malfoy didn’t stand up, he looked back and raised his eyebrows until Malfoy was following them and Luna.
“Oh,” said Malfoy’s voice, faltering. “Sorry.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and let Pansy stroke his hair until she had forgotten about it. He was clearly so happy that Harry couldn’t grudge Pansy for it at all. He kept beaming at Harry in-between insults about Harry’s hair, and listening to Goyle, and laughing with Millie, and stealing Theo’s drinks.
Malfoy’s grip on Harry’s elbow got much tighter as they made their way towards the booth around a table with a great deal of drinks. There was Blaise on one side, sitting next to Daphne and a black boy Harry didn’t recognise; Gregory Goyle was next to Blaise, beside him a figure he thought was Millicent Bulstrode, and an Asian girl with cropped hair that he vaguely remembered as being Pansy Parkinson.
“Draco.”
Neville tilts his head to the side, frowning at him. “Your engagement!”
“Didn’t you two snog at that first party?” Daphne said.
“That’s disappointing,” Luna remarked serenely. “We all match, now, you see.”
Harry punches his bed in victory.
Harry escapes into his kitchen to make Malfoy’s sugary, sweet, disgusting coffee and his own normal tea. He ponders over the ridiculousness of even Hermione being convinced he’s engaged, and how he can possibly convince her and Ron that he’s
Really, really drunk.

? Harry hasn’t even had time to formulate a kidnapping plan yet.
“I dunno,” Harry says. “He was acting weird the whole day. He was rude to Rafael Hernandez, and he was staring at me before we left for the pub.”
“Blaise,” Harry repeated. “Isn’t he a heroine too?”
“So that left me,” Zabini said. “I’m here to look out for him. I can’t figure out where
They pass pleasantries back and forth. Harry remembers to ask Rafael for an autograph; he makes it out to
Harry’s mouth twitched, which was the period in time where he became aware that the rest of their housemates were creeping down the stairs to see what all the fuss was about. On the boys’ staircase, Ron and Hermione were rushing down with their clothes rumpled, Hermione’s hair sticking up in every direction, and identical expressions of concern on their faces. Blaise Zabini leaned against the banister with an expression of extreme judgement and trepidation, wearing fancy-looking pyjamas that set off his dark skin and handsome face perfectly. Neville and Justin Finch-Fletchley were absent, but Dean, Seamus, and Terry Boot were looking on with raised eyebrows. On the girls’ staircase, Parvati stood by Daphne Greengrass, who was wearing a lacy slip of a night dress that went down to her feet and had a gaping neckline; each of them had their shining hair, one dark and one light, braided back identically in a coronet. Padma Patil watched on with indifference, next to her Susan Bones and a girl with brown skin and curly, short hair who Harry assumed was Lisa Turpin.
the one who dumped
“Why did you.” Harry stumbles over his words. He casts a glance at the sky above, clear and white, snow falling into his eyes. “Why did you leave,” he says finally. “When I kissed you, the first time, why did you leave?”
.” Malfoy sounded a bit hysterical, but also like it was too early to be bothered about it. “This is your fault. Your insanity is catching.”
Hermione eyed the Firewhiskey disapprovingly when they came back. “You do realise this is not at all what Professor McGonagall intended.”
Malfoy didn’t even bother to argue. He was so feeble, lying there, and Harry was the only one who thought he posed a threat.
“I’m not engaged!” yells Malfoy. “I am
It was, perhaps, time to admit that he did know.
me? Because you’re a hero, and that’s what you do, I suppose, to feel good about yourself, feel like there’s a reason to – ”
“It’s nice that Draco defended you, dear,” Molly says, turning to Harry, “but it shouldn’t have gotten so violent.”
It had worked out in the end, anyway, Harry thought.
“No idea why,” Zabini said airily. “Harry. Harry Potter. Can I call you Harry?”
“You are plebeian and awful,” Harry commiserated, and Malfoy whacked him with a pillow before getting up to go into the bathroom.
“Right,” Malfoy says, determinedly not looking in Harry’s direction. “We need to review our ground rules.”
“Sugaarrr,” Malfoy crooned from the shower, “d-du-du du du du. Ohhhh honey honey, d-du-du du du du. You are my candy girl, and you got me wanting you.”
His head hurt so much he almost reached up to touch his scar to see if it was burning. It felt like something had crawled up in his throat and died. But he was warm, comfortable, bound up in sheets and blankets, and someone sleeping next to him – Malfoy, who still looked asleep, with his arm slung across Harry’s chest and his head resting on Harry’s shoulder, legs sprawled across the bed.
“Yeah, yeah, it’s beautiful.” Harry rolls his eyes. “More affectionate. Got it. Moving on?’
“Come to gloat about the scars you’ve given me, Potter?” Malfoy said, voice hoarse. “Did you want us to match?”
“Oh, Harry,” said Ron, sadder still.
This made Malfoy blush but he said sternly, “Well you should have respected the fact that we are childhood nemeses.”
Malfoy looked up and caught his eye, and looked away sharply.
Harry winces. Neville had spoken a little loudly, and now some of the students are turning to look at them curiously. He doesn’t have time for this. His class should be starting in ten minutes. “I’m not – I’m not engaged, Nev.”
“He ran away.” Hermione is wearing her
He wasn’t going to stay at the Burrow for all of the holidays. Ginny hadn’t wanted to bring it up, but she’d mentioned talking about Blaise to her mother, which meant it was serious. Harry didn’t want to make things awkward. It would be easier for Ginny if he wasn’t there, and he should give the Weasleys their space anyway. He was going to stay with Andromeda and Teddy instead, at least until Malfoy said he was staying at Hogwarts for the holidays.
. You wish, Potter. Fine. Heads up.”
And he started running, throwing himself into Harry’s arms, and Harry caught him easily. They were both laughing louder than the rain. Harry tried to lift him up and failed miserably, so that they almost slipped and died like Malfoy had said they would. Malfoy laughed louder and wrapped his legs around Harry so that he would not fall into the grass.
They didn’t talk about it. They went back to being whatever they were, and Harry didn’t listen to Hermione’s advice again – at least not her advice about Malfoy. He Owled Sirius and Remus instead, and felt so utterly homesick for them – for Remus’s bone-crushing hugs and the millions of kisses Sirius would plant in his hair – that he forgot about Malfoy for a bit.
Hermione shook her head. “That, I really don’t believe.”
“What, it’s magic face wash?” Harry said and tried not to grin again.
“Hello,” Malfoy says, stiffly. He sits next to Harry and looks extremely unapproachable.
He hadn’t counted on Malfoy being a stubborn, stupid git, of course.
The Burrow was always loud. But there was something, someone, missing and they were all trying too hard to make up for it.
“What?” Malfoy screamed.
“Alright,” Harry said indulgently, “what’d they do?”
“I think you’re freaking out, Malfoy,” Harry said. “If you’re going to be a dick about this – ”
be sorry,” Harry bursts out. “You never would have said any of that to my face sober and you needed to!”
He forgot, that even if Malfoy was on his side now, he hadn’t miraculously turned into a better person.
“Yeah, well.” Harry keeps his eyes ahead and determinedly not anywhere near Malfoy. “So’re you.”
after a while – , a fork of cake halfway to Malfoy’s mouth, and the same cake’s icing smeared over Harry’s cheek.
“I know what you mean,” Malfoy said quietly. “It’s the truth.”
, and don’t you think you’re rushing into this, you're a little young, even Ron and I haven’t – ”
“And you’re,” Harry said slowly, “alright with it?”
“Some do,” Malfoy said. “Mother’s always gotten her skincare items imported from France, a witch named Gladys, bit of a show-off, really – ”
McGonagall looked a bit misty-eyed. “Mr. Black.”
“You should make the wish then,” Malfoy says. “It’s your eyelash.”
“I’m sure,” Harry assures her. He is sure, even though he and Malfoy have had a ridiculous amount of arguments in the past year. They always came back to each other. He can’t imagine being with anyone else. So what is the point of waiting?
“I’m not arguing with you,” argues Remus. “I’m only
────────────
“Myself!”
Parvati’s smile got a little wider, a little more relieved, and she said, “Yeah,” giving Harry’s hand a squeeze before she let go.
Harry furrows his brows. “What?”
“You’ll be alright?” Ron said, turning to Harry, his freckled face dear and reassuring.
“Do you
“And Daphne,” added Theo lazily, “even if she’s shacked up with a Gryffindor.”
Now he could link his arms around Malfoy’s neck, place a sloppy kiss on his cheek and ignore his pretend grimace, hold Malfoy’s hand while Malfoy delivered a long monologue about the parting of ways to the telly. He had never thought he could have this. He would never have let himself believe it.
“Okay.” Harry exhales, and rings the bell. Remus, to his relief, is the one who answers, smiling slightly, his sleeves rolled up.
“I like living with him,” Harry said, very coldly.
Malfoy nearly trips over a pile of his notes. He announces, “I might be about to throw up.”
“We’re going to get in trouble,” he said, looking out absently like he always did for the sound of Mrs. Norris sneaking up on them. He hadn’t even brought the Invisibility Cloak. He felt a little bare without it on him.
They kept the curtains in the compartment closed. There were crowds of people trying to catch a glimpse of Harry, reporters from the
“No, I wasn’t going to stay with them for the holidays,” said Harry, “I was – well, we can stay in Grimmauld Place.”
Malfoy was sipping coffee, bags under his eyes and his hair mussed from sleep. “Oh,” he said, turning slightly pink. Malfoy was always turning pink.
“Don't call me that,” Malfoy said. “I don’t want to listen. I don’t want to talk to you!” He had looked at Harry for one long moment, quivering, and then Madam Pomfrey had come in and kicked Harry out, and Pansy Parkinson had shoved her way in with Crabbe and Goyle.
Harry thinks, and the thought takes him by surprise. He realises something.
“Stop
“It’s a reminder,” Malfoy said. “And, alright, I’m not trying to – I’m just saying that this couldn’t ever possibly work. We should go back to like it was before. It’ll be better for everyone. We won’t have to worry about it as much – the papers would
“I know what day it is,” Malfoy said, voice unreadable.
“What,” Harry said. “What do you mean, it’s not a surprise?”
“Malfoy,” Harry says by way of explanation, sighing.
“I bet you’ll both last three days,” Ron told him, and Hermione said, “A
“I did,” Malfoy grumbled, “my hormones betrayed me and it’s – oh, whatever, you’re a bastard, Potter.”
!” Malfoy said, and then, in a consoling voice, “It’s alright, Potter. I know you’ve got a saviour complex the size of the Quidditch pitch and your life is incomplete without feeling like you are benevolently helping the poor mortals whose company you’re forced to deal with. Madam Pomfrey will sort us both out.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said again, and felt gut-wrenchingly awful. He had not even thought about it – he had not even cared – he remembered the blood on the bathroom floor and Malfoy gasping and dying, that feeling in his chest like he was falling, dropping to his knees. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I didn’t mean to.”
But they slept in the same bed now. Malfoy had charmed them to move together. The thing about being able to touch Malfoy was that Harry couldn’t bring himself to stop.
“Deadly,” Blaise confirmed.
“Race you to the pitch,” Malfoy said, and he leaped up to run down the stands before he had finished speaking because he was a rotten cheater.
“You are,” Hermione reassured him, patting his cheek.
Harry swallowed. “Not for me either. It wasn’t – it wasn’t like this.”
“But mate. The stalking? The constantly worrying about why Malfoy looked sick, and why he wasn’t talking to you or bothering you, and why he wasn’t doing his work or Quidditch – ”
“It’s okay,” Harry says. It’s charming, he almost says. I love that about you, he doesn’t say. Love. He doesn’t use that word when it comes to Malfoy.
“You are!”
Harry fights the urge to smile. Malfoy hates people who don’t like him, but he warms considerably to anyone who does. “Remus likes you. Sirius will get over it. As long as he thinks I’m happy.” He feels another pang of guilt.
“Good afternoon, Professor,” Harry managed to say, hoarsely.
“I needed to embarrass myself?” Malfoy asks.
Harry had honestly forgotten he was there. “I’ll come down soon. Fifteen minutes.”
“The Harry Potter I know,” Hermione says sternly, “doesn’t wait to find out if people like him back. If he doesn’t like you back, you can move on with your friendship. You survived the war, you can survive this.”

Malfoy looked up, alarmed. “To the Weasleys’?”
“Er, what?” Harry says. He must have misheard. He must have –

“I didn’t know you’d be working today!” Malfoy said, beaming at her while Harry continued to stare.

“The Sorting Hat almost put me in Slytherin,” Harry said thoughtfully, even though he hadn’t even told Ron and Hermione that.
“Yeah,” said Ron, “but I dunno what she was thinking putting Harry with Malfoy. Doesn’t seem like it’ll end well.”
He has to say
“Er, it sounds like they hated each other,” Harry said.
He waited for hesitation and there was none: Malfoy kissed him back right away, legs around Harry’s waist while the rain kept falling and drenching them both, like they had been hurtling towards this point for months or years. Thunder crackled in the distance. They were both freezing cold. Malfoy’s hand moved up from Harry’s jaw into Harry’s hair and Harry tightened his grip on Malfoy. He had been wanting to do this for so long and he wanted to do it right and he wanted not to stop, not now, not ever. He had to be slow and he had to be gentle. But he had been hungry for too long, and Malfoy tasted like rain and he was gasping into Harry’s mouth, his hold on Harry’s hair so tight it hurt.
“Well, how am I supposed to understand?” Harry snapped. “I don’t know what you’re on about – I’m sorry, I can’t change the way I feel, and I don’t want to, but you’re my friend first and if – if that’s what you still want, then I’ll – ”
going to spread virulent hatred you should be accurate at the very least. I wasn’t accurate, and all pureblood children have to take Muggle Studies at Hogwarts now, it’s required. I didn’t want to be behind either. So I bought some books, and they were very interesting. Then I thought I should see what Muggles live like, and I couldn’t use magic for the past year, so – ”
After, she said goodbye to them cheerily and made Malfoy promise not to ignore her again, which he did while still smiling.
“Yes, but she went to France for the war,” Hermione said. “Lots of Slytherins stayed out of it, actually, like Zabini – ”
Harry kissed him back slowly, like they had all the time in the world, a hand on Malfoy’s neck, feeling incredibly giddy that they were here on the stands where anyone could see them in the sun.
“Hermione found out,” Padma said, “and she said we had to ask Professor McGonagall, but we figure she’s probably going to let us.”
Malfoy muttered something that was probably rude, under his breath and opened the door, stepping inside before Harry could. Harry scowled and followed him in. He tried not to feel like the sound of the door closing behind him was the sound of his casket lid slamming shut.
Harry was perfectly prepared for everything to be awkward and uncomfortable. They’d never all hung out like this before, after all. Really, he did not know most of these people, and if he did, it was in war, not school.
“Why are you here, then?” says Harry.
Malfoy took Franny from McGonagall’s arms, and hesitated. Harry nodded at him before he left, closing the door behind him.
“And what’s that?”
“What,” said Harry, “have you – have you not been sleeping?”
, and I bet you anything he thought you looked
“Oh Harry,” says Hermione, her hand pressed to her mouth. “I feel a little embarrassed about believing you’d gotten engaged, but this is lovely, really, I’m so glad you’re happy.”
“What
Harry opened his eyes. Malfoy opened his eyes. They studied each other from upside down.
“Hey,” says Harry with a smile. Malfoy kicks him under the table, and he remembers
In love with Malfoy, he thought at night, throwing his blankets aside and looking over at where Ron was snoring, hand curled around the letter Hermione had sent this morning.
“Look,” Malfoy said, very fast, as they maneuvered around crowds of people, “I know you don’t like them, and honestly most of them hate you, but only Theo and Goyle were ever really involved with the Death Eaters, and they served their time in Azkaban after the Dementors were removed, so – and Pansy, I know what she said, and I’m sorry about that, but she probably isn’t – and you’ll probably like Millie the best – we should go back – oh, God, we’re here.”
In the morning, Ron and Hermione stayed by his side and Malfoy sang Muggle Halloween songs while insulting his hair and Ginny hexed anyone that asked him probing, personal questions about his parents. He thought about slipping away after dinner to visit their graves, but in the end he just looked through the photo book Hagrid had given him and hoped that wherever they were, they were happy, and that they would have wanted him to be happy too.
He did not cast an Impervius, but he did take off his glasses, tucking them in the pocket of the new jumper Malfoy had got him. There was a storm on the way. He stayed out while the rain kept hammering down harder, until he was drenched, hair a soaking mess and jeans sticking to his skin, and he felt alive.
,” and, “
Neville looks like he’s about to start laughing any moment now. “Of course.”
He can’t let last night be forgotten and ignored the way their first kiss was ignored. “I also have leather pants,” Harry says suddenly, and immediately wants to slink into the ground and disappear.
It was even weirder than he’d thought it would be, saying thank you to Malfoy.
at the Quidditch Pitch.
“You brought it up,” Harry reminds him, but he doesn’t mind changing the subject. There isn’t anything he doesn’t want to talk to Malfoy about.
says one that sounds like Pansy.
Hermione starts looking alarmingly like she’s about to burst into tears. “Harry, I can’t
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry said, and tilted his head back to kiss him again, feeling Malfoy smiling into his mouth.
“Scared?” Harry said.
Pansy flapped her hand around, scowling. “Oh, fine. I don’t understand why he gets all angry and upset. I miss when we were all
This made Malfoy turn pinker, so Harry pressed a kiss to his bare shoulder.
“Pathetic.” Pansy shakes her head. “Wish I could have a smoke.”
“You’re the only one who calls me that,” Malfoy murmurs. “No one else says it like you do.”
“Me too,” Harry offered, though his stomach flipped over at the thought of the Aurors, whose letter he had still not answered. “Ron and I came for Hermione. It doesn’t – it doesn’t really feel right.”
Malfoy in sixth year, I hated him!”
“Thank you, sir.”
“I didn’t want to come back,” she said. “I did it for Padma. I was going to go straight to the Aurors, but I didn’t want to leave her.”
Hermione’s eyes glimmer. “Why
Malfoy was, technically, on all counts, a perfect roommate. He didn’t leave his things around the room, he cleaned up after himself, he studied in the library or the common room, he never brought anyone up there. The thing was that Harry never saw him do any of this, because the only time he saw Malfoy was when they both went to bed, and sometimes he didn’t sleep in his room. Padma Patil occasionally went to her sister’s room instead, so that the other bed in Hermione’s room was empty, and he, Ron, and Hermione could push the beds together and sleep all curled up together.
. “I bet I’ll beat you again.”
Harry wrote about Mrs Weasley trying to get him and Ginny back together, and Ginny’s evasive responses re: Blaise, and the guilt and grief they all shared. He sent it off in the morning, with his and Ron’s letter to Hermione.
“Because he makes you happy,” said Hermione. “He helped make you better.”
“Don’t leave,” Malfoy says. He looks vulnerable, suddenly, lying there with his mouth pink and his nose scrunched up. Harry wants – he doesn’t know what he wants. He wants to make sure no one ever hurts Malfoy again, especially not him. “Don’t leave.”
“Let’s not,” Harry said, “let’s not worry about it too much.”
“Sorry,” he said, breathless. His head was raised above Harry’s and his mouth was a kiss away, arms securely around Harry’s neck. A first clap of thunder rolled in the background, and almost as though he couldn’t help it, Malfoy lifted a trembling hand to brush Harry’s hair away and touched the lightning scar on his forehead, brushing his hand over until it came to rest at Harry’s jaw.
“Whose don’t?” Dean said. He was watching the game of chess too, but mostly he was watching Seamus. “My parents didn’t want me coming back at all.”
, and then he smirks with the realisation, pleased and smug. Malfoy takes a hold of Harry’s hand gently –
“Oh come on,” said Harry. “It beats staying here alone.”
,” Harry says. “Come with me tomorrow and you’ll see.”
“What?”
“I know,” Harry said, because he did. “I’ll be alright. I – it’s fine. See you tomorrow.”
Ron scowls at his sister. “It wasn’t so bad.”
Harry shrugged. “Just thinking.” His voice was hoarse and sounded wrong to his own ears.
. I’ve been waiting. I thought it was a matter of time.”
to be a good roommate!”
Malfoy’s mouth quirks, just barely. “A wish?”
Malfoy is cold to touch, and his hair is covered in snow. Harry thinks he has hated Malfoy since he was eleven years old, and that he has loved Malfoy since was sixteen years old, and that now he holds Malfoy’s heart in his hands. It’s both a terrifying and wonderful thought. He says, “Let’s go back home.”
Harry sat down beside him, running a hand through his hair, which was a horrible idea because it made the whole hair situation even worse. “Me too.”
“Why do you like that film so much anyway?” he asked, sweeping glass in the bin.
“Okay,” Harry said, and they sat for a few more moments before he noticed Malfoy nodding off and hauled them both off to bed.
Harry chokes on thin air. “You – what?”
“I’m in love with Malfoy,” Harry blurts out.
He thought again,
“I always said you were a madman,” Malfoy said dramatically from behind him.
Sirius enters the sitting room and sets down the coffee and tea. He glances cagily at the door, but sits down next to Remus.
“Hey,” Dean said, a bit surprised. “Blaise and Seamus are switching the music back and forth between Celestina Warbeck and the Weird Sisters, it’s giving me a headache.” He nodded towards the bottle in Harry’s hand. “Mind if I have some?”
“Alright with what?”
“Professor, please,” said Malfoy earnestly, “it wasn’t her fault at all, and Franny’s got a whole life ahead of her – the Dirty Dancing soundtrack is a gift that we were spreading to the rest of the school, we’re encouraging connections to Muggle culture and it’s really quite a good film – ”
“I’ll talk to her,” Harry said.
He was at a loose end the rest of the day. He paced back and forth in front of the common room door panicking and trying not to panic until Lisa Turpin walked over and asked him very slowly if he’d forgotten the password. Then he went to his room to panic some more. Only being in his room was horrible because it was Malfoy’s room too, and he was
. He didn’t want to talk about it!”
“Before sixth year, obviously,” Malfoy said. “Blaise mostly tried it on with everyone, and we were in the same dormitory, or – well, it wasn’t like this.”
you,” Malfoy said, digging his foot into Harry’s thigh, “you ruin everything, you are the
She said to the statues, “
Harry took the book from him, struggling a bit under its weight, and found the passage Malfoy had pointed out. There was a copy of a handwritten letter, and beside that, a transcript of the letter. Harry squinted, only really understanding a few lines:
“You kept them?” he asks.
“Er,” Harry said.
“Not like that,” Malfoy hissed, sounding betrayed.
Malfoy, following Remus, pulls him gently inside the sitting room and settles on a couch that is much more comfortable than the one in their flat. He lets go of Harry’s hand. Harry tries not to miss the way Malfoy’s hand had felt against his own, and fails.
Harry took two and they sat in comfortable silence for a few moments before Parvati yawned and went upstairs. He stared at the last sweet in his hand after she’d gone upstairs. He wondered if his father’s family had been Indian. He didn’t know. He didn’t know what he was.
Malfoy looked panicked. “I can’t. He’ll hate me.”
“No, all he ever does is complain and insult my hair,” Harry replies automatically, then freezes. Maybe he should have said something more...couple-y? But Hermione laughs, so it must be alright.
Malfoy gave a little rueful shake of his head. “Why do you always have to be such a hero?”
, but
He was carrying Malfoy’s books and their arms kept knocking together on the way back to the common room. Hermione had dragged Ron to the library, Blaise was frantically planning out how to proclaim his love for Ginny, and Daphne and Parvati had Divination. It was just them.
Harry let him do this without much fuss. “I thought you were studying with Blaise and Daphne in the library?” he asked as Malfoy dragged him down the stairs and out of the common room, past Justin and Terry, who saw that Harry was being kidnapped by a madman and waved at him merrily.
The first one he’d had so many times he didn’t wake up, only made distressed noises in his sleep that he hoped Malfoy couldn’t hear. The other one made him bolt up, sweaty and out of breath, brown limbs tangled all up in white sheets. He looked over at Malfoy’s bed, where he could still see Malfoy’s bright hair against his pillow, and then he fell back in bed.
Harry...really could not think of a response to this. He decided to ignore it. “Well, Ginny’s not an object you get,” he said sharply. “If you like her, be honest with her. And don’t you dare hurt her. I’m sure she’d beat you to a bloody pulp and have your face covered in bat bogies if you even tried, and you’d have six brothers and me to go through after that.”
Harry sighed. “Fine. But I
The girl pulled away to punch him in the arm. “Where have you
“Oh, Merlin,” Malfoy said, voice clearer and louder and very panicked, “Merlin and Morgana. Have you got a concussion, Potter? Let’s get you to Madam Pomfrey.”
“No,” agrees Malfoy.

Then Dean Thomas sends him an Owl:
, and he can feel Malfoy’s surprised shudder, and then he kisses Malfoy and Malfoy moans,
“Potter,” Pansy said as soon as they were out of sight. She had definitely planned this.
“A better question is, why are you riding on my back?” Harry asks.
“Me too,” Harry said into her shoulder.
, and Malfoy looked at Harry so fiercely Harry said
“Pakistan,” Malfoy said at last.
“Please,” Harry whimpers, “don’t say things like that. And I dunno, Hermione, I thought so at first, but what does he have to be jealous about?”
Inside the bathroom, where it smelled like vanilla, Harry swept cold water over his face and tried to think. McGonagall had trusted him to be able to do this. So he was going to do this. It was almost soothing, to be able to have a task to focus on again.
hell,” Harry said.
“Your celebrity is wasted on you,” Malfoy mourned.
“Theo?”
“You haven’t been threatened by me,” Pansy threatened.
“Valentine’s Day,” Malfoy says, because he has a sardonic sense of humour.
“Hangover Potion?” Harry offered.
Harry settled down to sit at a table, putting down their books and pulling out his Potions essay that he’d left to the last minute, and let Malfoy do this without any objections. He had long since discovered that Draco Malfoy was an alternate universe, pureblood version of Hermione.
“Yeah. He said I was, er, attractive last night. When he was drunk. Among other things. But he was drunk.”
“No,” Harry says. “Listen.” It’s almost like he’s back in sixth year, hissing at a Malfoy who was tired and tired and hated Harry.
He couldn’t even go to his
“Nothing!” Malfoy had said, avoiding his eyes. “Have you always had that leather jacket?”
“Hold my hand,” Malfoy says suddenly.
“I’ve seen what your interference has done, thank you very much, Blaise,” Pansy retorted. “This is a mess.”
, in Malfoy’s writing, and the second ever is
After that, talking to the Slytherins was fairly easy, except for with Pansy, who still seemed baffled that he was here at all. Well, until Malfoy went up to get more drinks, and Goyle looked at Pansy, who nodded once, and stood up to help before Harry could. Malfoy looked at Harry with a slightly panicked look that Harry returned without the slightly, but Goyle was already dragging him away.
“No, they don’t,” Harry answers him, pushing the trolley to another aisle. “And I don’t know why you like those. They’re sick.” He gets some fruit anyways. Malfoy is a slave to blueberries. He likes the sweet ones best, but Harry is of the opinion that the sour ones are superior.
“Longbottom,” says Malfoy to Neville, inclining his head. “You’re looking good. Not as good as my precious baby cakes, of course.”
“Turn it off,” Harry whispered, “turn it off quick.”
a real Black, and if you think I’m not going there with you, you’re even more crazy than I thought.” It was only Harry, Malfoy and the little second year at first, but news had spread. A whole crowd of Harry’s students had come to him, nervous and stammering, and asked to stay with him. A fourth year who didn’t want to be around her uncle, a first year who only had an orphanage to go back to, a fifth year whose family had kicked him out – and Harry had never felt more right about his decision to teach, or his decision to help these abandoned souls. He had been saved. They were going to be saved too.
Malfoy took his hand.
“Harry.” Hermione turns to look at him. There’s something in her expression Harry can’t place, but it twinges at him. “I want you to be happy.”
“Are you alright?” Harry asks, sitting next to her.
He tried to work on his essay and kept thinking about how Malfoy would have told him every sentence was wrong. He tried to organize his trunk and found the book Malfoy had given him, pressed carefully back into the packaging after Harry had read it front to back. He tried to take a shower and kept remembering Malfoy singing in the shower, which led to thinking about Malfoy in the shower, which was not a productive train of thought. He tried to think about everything wrong with Malfoy, of which there was a lot, but being all-too aware of his faults made him seem more real, somehow.
“Oh, thanks very much,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
“You should probably make this quick,” Harry said as they walked out of the door in uncomfortable silence. “Malfoy’s awake and he really wanted to be here when I told him you wanted to talk to me.”
“Did I?” Malfoy wonders. His eyelashes flutter. “I had a dream where you called me Draco.”
,” Malfoy demanded, poking him in the shoulder. He looked serious all of a sudden. “The things I did. Don’t you care?”
“What?”
Malfoy’s head snaps up. “Excuse you,” he says in tones of deep and dark offence. “Obviously, I know roses are your favourite flower. You have no sophistication, and probably only know the names of five types of flowers, and you like classic things, and red is one of your favourite colours,
Living with Malfoy was easier than Harry would have thought.
, and yet you still look – !” He took a deep breath. “Alright. We’re going.”
Mad-Eye Moody screamed in his mind. Harry could picture how disappointed he would have been that Harry had allowed himself to be taken to an unknown location by a Slytherin.
Harry watched him for a little while, languid and lazy in the sunlight. “Merlin,” Malfoy said finally, sitting up and laughing sharply, “I can’t believe I actually slept there. Everything hurts now. What a disgrace. And your
“Try a Silencing Spell!”
Zabini leaped up when he saw Harry and opened the door out the common room with a bow. Harry gave him a weirded-out look as Dean walked through the common room door; Blaise leered at him, and Harry gave him an awkward nod. He gave them both a half-smile, so things were fine if embarrassing.
“Perhaps you’d like to join me for breakfast,” Zabini cut in smoothly. “We have some things to discuss.”
a Gryffindor. Do you know what my mother would say? Actually,” Malfoy mused, “she might be pleased.”
“What is wrong with you,” said Harry absently.

you don’t.”
“He’s had a lot of Firewhiskey,” said a frazzled-looking but fond Hermione. “I think we’re probably pushing our luck, McGonagall’s going to have our heads if we keep this up any longer, though I did cast about a million Silencing Charms over the door and to my knowledge none of the teachers’ offices are that close to our common room – ”
Malfoy is already sleeping inside when Harry enters. He settles down on the couch, and thinks about how stupid he is to have agreed to this insane plan of Malfoy’s. He thinks about Malfoy’s insane plan in sixth year that probably would have worked if Harry hadn’t carried out his own insane plan of turning him away from Voldemort. He thinks about the one and only time he’d kissed Malfoy. He thinks about a lot of things and it’s all Ron and Hermione’s fault for making him feel safe enough to drink all those pints.
“Harry, Malfoy’s stolen you away,” Ginny said. “Come play Spin the Wand with us. Come sit with us. Come dance with me.”
me. As if I’d ever want to anyway. Who’d want to braid her hair? Not me. She thought she had the best hair in Slytherin, and she and Blaise would duke it out. As though I wasn’t even an option. I have great hair.”
Constant vigilance, he thought furiously. His constant vigilance had
He had faith that Malfoy would not be able to stand the silence for longer than a few minutes and his faith was rewarded. Malfoy sighed again, loudly, and said, “I did some research.”
“I’m not
, and they are an abomination that should be set on fire.” He let the clothes in his hand fall to the floor dramatically. “I have not noticed this for so long because you are always either wearing your school robes, Weasley jumpers, Quidditch shirts, pyjamas, or the same two pairs of jeans over and over again. Potter, I know you have money, and even if you didn’t, people would
“Er, sure, I’ll ask Malfoy,” Harry said and closed the door.
“It’s not working!”
What followed was a complicated conversation about question 3b that Harry could not hope to follow at all, but apparently Terry and Hermione had disagreed on the answer. Hermione’s questions to Malfoy were stilted and stiff, and Malfoy was jumpy and careful, but otherwise things seemed to be going well. When they segued into a conversation about Latin, Harry started to get bored and cheered on Ron and Justin in their game of chess, his hand still on Malfoy’s ankle.

“I am laughing at you,” Harry said, grinning.
“At Christmas!” Harry said hysterically, looking up. “I didn’t even know at Christmas!”
Harry almost smiled. He didn’t, because it was
“I’m not freaking out!” Malfoy said hysterically. “I didn’t know you – you! And Ginevra Weasley and –
“We didn’t have any Muggle money, and Malfoy really wanted wedding cake,” Harry tells her, shooting Malfoy a furtive look that says
“Nooo,” Malfoy murmured, pulling the covers over his face.
“It’s a good idea,” Malfoy says defensively, “it’ll get my parents off my back. When Valentine’s Day comes around, I’ll tell them you dumped me and broke my heart, and they’ll leave me alone for a bit. A couple of months of peace, and maybe I can finally finish my articles.”
“They’ll get over it, it doesn’t matter – ”
Malfoy looks up at him, eyes glinting. “What kind of fake boyfriend would you be if you didn’t?” He cackles. Harry hates Malfoy’s laugh. Harry hates everything about Malfoy.
“Yes,” Harry says. “Yes. I’ve wanted this for real for I don’t even know how long. A long time.”
Harry collapses on his bed in disappointment.
Harry stared at him. “How do you know that?”
“Oh, no,” said Ron sadly.
“Yeah.” Harry almost laughed. It was ridiculous the way they were intertwined, in life and death and in ways that they could never make sense of. “But – I had a choice. I could have stayed, or I could have come back to finish the job.”
Malfoy stared at him. “Good God, Potter, you can’t go around
Unfortunately, that doesn’t make him feel any better.
“You have to read it,” says Malfoy, and lapses into a rant about all of the virtues of the book, as though Harry hasn’t heard it all for the past week. As though Harry didn’t buy the book because Malfoy loved it so much.
He Apparates back to Hogsmeade. One of Malfoy’s employees is closing up the coffee shop, and Harry nods a hello at her. He doesn’t receive a reply but he hadn’t expected one: Malfoy trained these employees, after all.
“Are you done?” Harry screamed back.
“She thinks of me as a friend,” says Ginny glumly, heaving herself up using her thighs. “Just a friend, which is. Fine. ’S alright, I’ll go visit George and Lee. They’re my second choice because I’m not in the mood to be pranked.” She strides past Harry to the fireplace, leaning up on her tiptoes to ruffle his hair on the way.
“And I was wondering how you proposed to Malfoy? Or how Malfoy proposed to you?”
Hermione looked taken aback. “Well Harry, I’ve known since sixth year.”
“No, I,” Malfoy said. “I didn’t want to have to do this.”
“Hello,” Harry said. They had woken up together twice before, but he felt his heartbeat quicken. He didn’t know where they were going from here.
there were
“That I obviously have been embarrassingly in love with you for going on a year now, and everyone is incredibly sick of it, and if you look at me like that, with your
He followed everyone on the train and into a compartment when they managed to shake them off, where they all squished together and cast a locking charm on the door. Hermione and Ron’s hands were clasped, Neville had a set look to his jaw, Ginny’s chin was tilted up, and Seamus had a tight and vice-like grip on Dean’s arm, but Luna was humming noncommittally and they were all putting on a fine show of being okay otherwise. They were okay, most of them, or they were going to be. Harry, on the other hand – he didn’t know.
He felt incredibly conscious of Malfoy standing
Walburga Black trailed off as soon as she saw Malfoy. “Is that my darling Draco?”
, Harry wanted to say, but it sounded embarrassing even in his head.
“It’s true,” Blaise said. “I admit, I saw it as fate, or destiny, that Dean Thomas and I were to share a room. However, he clearly held affection for another.”
“Malfoy,” Harry hissed, “look in front of you.”
doing?”
He went downstairs, but no one else seemed to be awake. He wanted to say
“Relax,” says Harry.
The hour came by and went. Malfoy had been right about Harry liking Millie the best; she had the same opinions about Quidditch that he and Ginny did, and she was much easier to talk to than the rest. Goyle was next, to Harry’s immense surprise. He talked to Malfoy mostly. Theo didn’t say much to Harry, but he didn’t think he hated him. Though when Pansy saw that he and Malfoy had their ankles hooked around each other beneath the table she did seem to despair.
“Hey, how come you know so much about my love life?” Harry said, grinning.
“He’s a bit strange,” Andromeda said, watching Malfoy argue with Teddy over which colours to use. “But I’ve lost enough family. I’d welcome getting some back.”
“I,” Harry said, and had no idea how to finish that sentence.
either way.
He made his way to the top of the stands and sat down on the seat behind Malfoy, because he did not think he would be able to look at Malfoy directly.
He found the dot labelled
, adds another voice that sounds disturbingly like Blaise.
“I hate you,” Harry tells him, but he doesn’t. He left behind hating Malfoy back in sixth year, though he didn’t know it then, and now, he thinks that even if he tried to despise him once again – tried to remember Malfoy’s lips curling up in a sneer, tried to remember all the taunts and jeers and various bullying, tried to remember

“I think you need to go to St. Mungo’s,” Malfoy said.
“Exactly,” Malfoy agreed enthusiastically. “I mean, even the school motto is in Latin.”
“Professor
The students are tittering, looking from Malfoy to Harry. “Calm down, everyone,” Harry tells them, and looks straight at Malfoy.
“If you say so,” Luna says doubtfully. “It could just be Wrackspurts, I suppose. Happens to the best of us. Speaking of Wrackspurts, have you and Draco figured your relationship out yet? Sex is always a good solution.”
He turns his head and gives Malfoy a slow, long kiss, because he won’t ever get tired of that. Harry is smiling against Malfoy’s mouth; maybe Malfoy can feel it, because he pulls away and pokes Harry’s dimple.
To separate beds.
“We do,” Harry agreed, smiling because Malfoy had said
“She’s going to tell Filch and I’ve got my Cloak in the common room,” Harry said, “turn that thing off!”
looking alarmingly like she’s been crying.
“Oh, shut up,” Malfoy huffed, “I don’t want to hear anything from you, you probably wash your face with dish soap and yet you still – ” Malfoy closed his mouth abruptly.
“I have a plan,” says Malfoy with a satisfied smile.
“Most of the scarring healed,” Malfoy said, voice distant.
Harry imagined Ron’s face if he learned of this. He considered making fun of Malfoy for saying everlasting glow and using magic face wash but decided against it. “Muggles don’t have that.”
“Because – because the rest of the Slytherins are in there,” said Malfoy. “We haven’t seen each other in a while, and you don’t exactly get on particularly well with any of them.”
Harry swallowed. “I know that.”

“I want you to be happy, too,” Harry mumbles.
Zabini waved a hand around nonchalantly. “You can call me Blaise.”
“Draco?” Daphne Greengrass said uncertainly.
“Hello, earth to Harry,” Ginny said. “You look awfully maudlin. Are you in love with Malfoy?”
“I’m not – ”
“You’d last a
“Well yes, there’s no denying that, but she seems fine,” said Hermione. “A little full of herself and dignified, maybe, but she and Parvati don’t seem to have any problems. And Susan Bones is with Lisa Turpin.”
didn’t like me!” Malfoy says furiously. He stops walking, crosses his arms and glares at Harry. Harry glares back, out of reflex, and stops too.
“And where were you, exactly?”
Harry went to their room and looked at the door that Malfoy had hit in his face, with
He had thought of thirteen long years with the Dursleys. He had thought of his cupboard under the stairs.
McGonagall folded her hands on her desk and stared them down: Harry, on one chair, fidgeting, and Malfoy, pale on another chair, a respectable distance away. Franny had been stashed behind McGonagall’s desk but she was still singing softly, and Malfoy was biting his lip, looking over there and not looking at Harry or McGonagall. Malfoy’s mouth was swollen from before. Harry did not want to think about his hair. He could not bring himself to look directly at McGonagall either. He really wanted to die, preferably now but any time today could be arranged.
“I can call you that right now,” Harry says, heart going
Malfoy looked aghast. “Leave
be in denial.
“I don’t think you should talk to Blaise,” Malfoy said, all in a rush.
Harry had never wanted to be friends with Malfoy. He thought of all the reasons why, all the horrible things that Malfoy had done, the way he had got under Harry’s skin. Malfoy had sharp edges. He could be unpleasant and cruel and awful. So could Harry.
Seamus had come for Dean, and Ginny had come for her mother’s sake. He wondered what they were all really doing here, why they were bothering, in this castle that had been their home and then been a place they’d thought they would all die in.
Seamus will be upset, of course, and Hermione will disapprove, and Ron will support him because Ron is a good fucking friend, but this is the only perfect solution to Harry’s current problem, as Dean Thomas is the reason that everyone in Harry’s life thinks he is engaged to Draco Malfoy.
?” repeated Harry, thunderstruck, looking around to make sure no one at the breakfast table was overhearing this horrifying conversation.
“Everyone’s got a type,” Malfoy says dismissively.
He thought about skipping the next class, but then Malfoy would know something was up. He expected Flitwick’s five points from Gryffindor because he was late on purpose, hoping Blaise or Terry or Anthony would have sat with Malfoy in his place. But when he came to the classroom, Blaise and Parvati were sitting in front of Malfoy, whose bag was clearly saving a seat for Harry.
They spent the rest of the day searching for all their belongings, and not summoning Kreacher to help just in case he pointed out darkly the mess they’d made yesterday. Malfoy’s especially were everywhere, in Harry’s room and the drawing room, all over the place.
. He adds, more firmly, “I haven’t got a type.”
“Harry!” Ron said loudly when he came over. “We haven’t seen you in so long. You’ve been with – ” Here he let out an enormous giggle. “Malfoy, ha.”
“Good,” Harry says. The world is hushed, quiet, as snowflakes flutter from the sky. He kisses Malfoy gently, hand fisted in the collar of Malfoy’s coat, as snow falls around them, coating them with white. He wonders how he ever could have stopped kissing Malfoy before. His heart is racing faster than it ever has in a Quidditch match. This is it, this is the one, this is what he’s been waiting for.
Hermione’s expression grew steadily tragic. “I can’t do this.”
“I still hate you,” said Malfoy, “violently, and terribly.”
“I’m climbing into the trolley,” Malfoy warns him, before proceeding to do exactly that. Harry pushes him around amiably, settling down from the confusion of Malfoy’s behaviour earlier. He grabs some hot cocoa, since they’re running out, and Malfoy’s favourite biscuits. He has a vague, guilty voice in the back of his mind – one that sounds suspiciously like Hermione or Remus – that tells him to get more healthy food.
Harry was not surprised Malfoy had come after him. He turned around to see Malfoy standing in front of the doors on the threshold of the garden. He smiled, and said, “Takes one to know one.”
, add Sirius and Remus.
“I couldn’t sleep,” Harry blurted out, conscious of the fact that he wasn’t wearing a shirt. “Sorry.”
Ron looked relieved. “You do?”
They didn’t find a compartment, because then everyone started rushing towards Harry, asking for his autograph and thanking him and wondering if he’s single and trying to touch him. Hermione cast a spell to keep them back with a furious look in her eyes and Ron said loudly, “I think he went that way!” while Luna started talking earnestly about Heliopaths so Harry could manage to slip on the Invisibility Cloak. A bit of a mistake not to have kept it on, really, but Hermione had said he was supposed to not have to hide anymore.
He didn’t sulk or fucking pine away for Malfoy, or anything. He just kept expecting to see Malfoy’s bright hair, feel his elbow on Harry’s shoulder, hear his voice. To his chagrin, Harry kept humming the Dirty Dancing soundtrack, though the Burrow was loud enough that no one had yet caught on.
Blaise raised an eyebrow. “Am I wrong?”
Hermione looked resigned. “That’s what you remember about it?”
necessary.
“We always get vanilla,” Harry says, and puts a pint of vanilla into the trolley anyway. They always get vanilla, or that fake-looking turquoise stuff, or salted caramel. He puts a few more pints of different ice cream into the trolley. Malfoy carefully arranges them around him.
“ – but we probably should anyway,” finishes Malfoy.
“You can laugh,” Malfoy said, voice rising and mouth twitching, “but it’s true. Before she came to Hogwarts, she read all the books about you, and talked about you constantly. That was before she met you and realised you were nothing but a disfigured disappointment with dreadful hair and vision problems, of course.”
“No,” Harry said, laughing.
?” Harry repeated. “No, I – Malfoy,” he said again, quieter. “Thanks.”
“Let’s sit down,” Sirius says loudly.
Harry gave his creased clothes from the night before and tousled hair a skeptical look. “Maybe you want to freshen up first?”
,” Malfoy said, putting his face in Harry’s hair briefly to groan. “You’re not supposed to say it, Potter, honestly.”
Harry should probably back out of this right now. He remembers the Hogwarts school motto –
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Harry asked, a bit stung. “I don’t. I don’t care what I look like.”
it. Harry doesn’t want to say that he’s dating Malfoy more than he absolutely needs to, so, trying to stall for time until Sirius arrives, he says, “I like the new throw pillow.”
The longest conversation he and Malfoy had was when Harry dug out the hawthorn wand from his trunk and gave it back to Malfoy, and all Malfoy said then was thank you. Harry did see the way his eyes had lit up, though. He was glad he’d done it.
“And I will never do it again,” Malfoy declared.
Harry tries not to stare. He feels warm inside, and kind of wants to replay Malfoy’s words over and over and over again, even though they were a little insulting. “Oh.” He clears his throat. “We were, er, discussing something.”
“I had my doubts about putting you two in a room together,” McGonagall said. “You always did seem to bring out the worst in each other.” When Harry bristled, she smiled. “I don’t think that’s true anymore, or perhaps it never was true. Regardless, I must admit I expected you to show up complaining about it within the first week. I’m glad you did not. I’ve been meaning to talk to you. Do you know what day it will be in a week, Harry?”
“I didn’t want to have to admit it,” Malfoy told him solemnly, “but there’s something you should know, Potter. Daphne – was obsessed with you.”
The door behind them opened and they both fell backwards in a heap on the stone floor, Franny falling to the side and miraculously still playing,
“Malfoy,” Harry said, ignoring this, “try the lift now.”
“I have tea with your mother! And I’m meeting Pansy every week. Remus already likes you, and the only reason Sirius doesn’t because you two are weirdly alike.”
“Oh my God, do those exist?” Malfoy said, staring at at the picture in awe. “That is so cool.”
But it is nice not to have to deal with Sirius and Remus’s own disastrous matchmaking attempts, which include: a disdainful Parvati Patil, a son of a friend of Remus who admitted to being straight – “But I might be willing to reconsider for you,” he’d added, eyeing Harry hungrily, and Harry had made a hasty exit –, Ernie Macmillan, Lisa Turpin, a Muggle who really had no idea what was going on, almost every single twenty-three-year-old Sirius came into contact with and in one mostly successful attempt Viktor Krum – so Harry had let himself be persuaded to pretend to date Malfoy.
This made Harry fall silent. Malfoy cackled triumphantly.
They were supposed to have gotten back together. Harry thought everyone else was waiting for it – he’d been waiting for it. Well, he’d actually been half-sure that he’d end up dying, for good, and that he’d never get to kiss Ginny again. He hadn’t thought about what would happen if they won, and then they had been awkward and tip-toeing around each other all of the past year, sick with grief and something else they didn’t have the words to name. There were trials to testify at, funerals to attend every day, Snatchers and Death Eaters to round up, prisoners to free, and Harry and Ginny hadn’t had the chance to learn if they still fit together. He wondered if they ever had.
“What, exactly, are your intentions with my son?” she says coolly, her tea and biscuits untouched on the ancient table Malfoy had brought over from Malfoy Manor ages ago, ignoring Harry’s protests.
“Er,” says Harry, with a nervous glance at Malfoy, who sits next to him and keeps nodding encouragingly at random points of time. He takes a risk – to help the illusion that he and Malfoy are in love – and slings an arm along Malfoy’s bony shoulders, pulling him closer. Malfoy smells like expensive shampoo and coffee and Narcissa’s perfume. “I love him, Mrs Malfoy,” continues Harry. It isn’t even a lie.
“Unless one of us meets someone they really like, in which case we will break off our pretend relationship,” Harry amends. In his case that’s unlikely, and he doesn’t like the idea of it happening to Malfoy, but it’s fair.
“Marshmallows,” Malfoy says, pronouncing the word carefully. “Let’s get them.”
He thought maybe getting some distance from Malfoy would be better. Then he let himself admit in his head that he was going to be miserable the whole holidays, and went to help Luna hide Easter eggs in the castle to try and forget about it, went to play Exploding Snap with Ron to try and forget about it, went to watch Ginny’s Quidditch practice with Blaise to try and forget about it. He couldn’t.
saying that to Ron and Hermione; they’d gone out to celebrate Malfoy uncovering several unsavoury politicians a few weeks ago. They’d gone as friends, and he’d never thought he implied anything else.
Hermione frowns. “But you’ve already told us you’re dating him, Harry, so you don’t need to look so anxious about our reactions. Have you told Sirius and Remus?”
with him. But some part of Harry – the part that remembers Pansy talking about Malfoy being in love with him, the part that thinks about Malfoy’s behaviour yesterday – wants to hope.

“I’m going home, of course,” Anthony was saying, watching Ron and Justin play chess against Neville and Seamus absently. “I don’t celebrate Christmas, though.” Here there was a general chorus of, “Me neither,” from a few others. “There’s Hanukkah, of course,” went on Anthony. “Mostly my parents want me home.”
“Okay,” Malfoy says, voice hoarse. His eyes are grey, grey, grey. They remind Harry of the moon watching over him at night. “No kissing.”
“Thanks, mate,” says Ron, and Harry realises he accidentally said that aloud. He may be a little more drunk than he’d intended.
Malfoy shrugged. “I’ve got studying to do. I’ll be fine.”
They were in Potions, working as partners. Slughorn had stopped looking baffled at this development and now took to smiling benevolently at Malfoy, who had forgotten his initial dislike of Slughorn and now looked pleased every time he smiled. It worked out well, since Malfoy was much better at Potions than Harry was. Slughorn had so far not noticed any lack of Harry’s previous brilliant skills, or the fact that these days Harry was mostly just staring at Malfoy’s hands while they measured ingredients and stirred potions.
Hermione, Parvati, Daphne, and Justin sat at the edge of the pitch, Justin and Parvati commentating while Hermione and Daphne served as referees, though Daphne was mostly braiding Parvati’s hair.
Harry tried, again, to be affronted. He was sure he would have punched Malfoy in the face for such a remark before, but instead he felt the wonderful momentary urge to laugh again. Malfoy, on the other hand, had that pinched expression again, like he’d said something he shouldn’t have said. He was muttering to himself again, saying, “Exactly the kind of situation I was trying to avoid, of
“What would we do that for?” Malfoy says, genuinely puzzled. “I get enough of that from my mother, Potter, thanks. Have Muggle shops really not got any Acid Pops?”
Malfoy kissed him back almost immediately; his hands found their way to Harry’s hair, pulling harshly, tugging Harry closer. Harry didn’t think, couldn’t think. He kissed Malfoy like he had something to prove. Malfoy kissed him like a challenge. He kissed Malfoy back like he wanted to
“Then what do you want?” Malfoy exclaimed, a little hysterically. “I’m
Harry shrinks in his chair at the weight of all of the stares and giggling around him. He has never been so mortified in his life, and yet, catching sight of the roses on his desk makes him smile.
“Potter?” Malfoy calls.
“Yes, exactly, and because it’s a source of shame to me that I’m
“Harryyy,” Ginny said, “why are you in this corner aloneeee? Oh, hey, Malfoy.” She squinted at him for a second. “Huh. I didn’t think Ron was telling the truth about this. Nice glasses.”
Malfoy had gone over to the bed with his trunk. He was hesitating. Harry waited, almost holding his breath. He wondered if he should say something, but before he could, Malfoy took a deep breath and turned around.
Malfoy looked flummoxed, but when Teddy failed to run away screaming about birthday presents from him, he seemed to let the truck comment go in favour of helping Teddy draw a rocket ship airplane and a rocket ship castle. Teddy’s hair started turning platinum blonde.
“Alright,” says Harry, smiling at her. She’s a good student, focused and determined and passionate. “What is it?”
“Well, I am,” Harry said, swallowing.
“I am not delicate,” Malfoy said crossly, at the same time that Harry did. They both exchanged startled looks with each other as Madam Pomfrey leaned over Harry and muttered, “
McGonagall came to a stop in front of a set of old, wooden doors in one of the north towers, guarded by a statue of a girl with a crown and closed eyes, and a knight with flowing hair that sat at her feet attentively. Not Sir Cadogan, Harry thought, meeting Ron’s eyes and smiling. Everyone stumbled back, not expecting McGonagall to have stopped; there were the general mutterings of, “’Scuse,” and a couple of people stepped on everyone’s toes as McGonagall turned out and squared her shoulders. Her speech was familiar and comforting, containing the words ‘respect’ and ‘inter-house unity’ again, and she smiled at them all. The look in McGonagall’s eyes was different, like she was relieved that they were all still here and like she hadn’t thought they would be, but she was the same and it was achingly comforting.
“I’m all right,” Malfoy says indignantly, teetering on the spot and stumbling into Harry, who catches him easily. Malfoy weighs almost nothing. Harry doesn’t budge against him. He likes Malfoy like this. Uncomplicated. Leaning against Harry. Smiling.
“I do care,” Harry mumbled through a yawn. “Do you?”
“I thought about, you know,” said Malfoy. “Calling Weasley, or waking you up, or getting you a Sleeping Draught. Madam Pomfrey says I use them too often, but she’d probably give them to
has more game than you, Blaise.
“I care,” said Malfoy, “I care that they’re going to hate you for it – ”
“I mean, yeah, with Ginny, but with Seamus too, in the summer,” Harry said.
“It’ll be fine,” Harry assured her.
“Before I realised my passion for Miss Weasley,” Blaise assured him.
“Have you – have you just been trying to make me angry this whole time?” Harry demanded.
Harry can’t bring himself to look at Remus’s face. “That means a lot,” he says, and it does.
Malfoy’s mouth fell open. “How
Harry shuffled against his pillow and kept looking at him, eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks and pale hair kissed. He tucked his free hand under his cheek. The other one had intertwined itself with Malfoy’s in the night. Harry lifted their entwined hands together and pressed a kiss to Malfoy’s knuckles, and then hoped no one would ever know he’d done that.
?” Harry said, laughing. He stood up and winced as Malfoy threw his clothes out of the trunk.
Malfoy touched his hair lightly, brushing snow off, and took hold of the crook of his elbow. “Didn’t you wear a hat?”
“Er,” Harry said, coming to a halt. He looked around. They’d been going in the opposite direction from the Great Hall, presumably because Zabini wanted to chase Malfoy off for some excessively abysmal reason.
Ron shrugged. “I trust your judgement. Mind you,” he added as he, Harry, and Hermione started walking out, “Mum will freak when you and Ginny both bring home Slytherins.”
there.
He didn’t know what they were doing, what they had been doing all year, and he didn’t know whether Malfoy felt the same. But he did not want to mess it up.
“Ah,” says Remus knowingly.
“Are...you...not?”
. Malfoy hasn’t been mooning over him, that’s for sure.
He realised what an awful idea this had been when he and Malfoy were standing inches away from each other, and Malfoy was directing Harry’s hand to his shoulder, and putting his hand on Harry’s waist.
“I don’t want to impose,” Malfoy said slowly, which made Harry snort and try to throw lacewing flies at him. Malfoy dodged and relented, “Oh, fine, if you’re sure.”
“Hermione,” says Harry at once, at the same time Malfoy says, “Pansy.”
“Ow,” Malfoy’s voice said, vaguely out of focus. “Potter?”
Ginny tightens her legs around him securely. “Because I want to. Harry, come
Maybe Malfoy might think he’s attractive,
“Oh my God,” Harry said indignantly. “That’s not allowed! That’s my bed!”
Narcissa smiles. “As long as Draco is happy, yes. That is all that matters.” She stands up gracefully, kisses Malfoy briefly on the cheek, gives Harry one last smile, and takes the Floo out. Harry feels like he’s passed some sort of test.
“I like him,” Harry said, rough. “That’s all.”
“I realised yesterday,” Harry says.
“And instead of using a spell or your personal physique to kick me off, you decided to cuddle up to someone I remember you violently hating with a passion and in fact attempting to murder once, perfectly reasonable idea,” said Zabini. “Though I admit, last night was not my finest moment. I apologise most sincerely. Quite impolite of me. In my defense my advances had been ignored for the first time in, well, forever. I was facing a serious case of heartbreak and I’d had to get incredibly drunk to deal with it, and mistook your room for my own.”
of it. Anyways, you’ve got lots to lose, you giant lump, what are you
“Potter,” said Malfoy finally, standing in a circle with clothes all around him, “what is this?”
“I hope for your sake it’s been made properly,” Malfoy says tartly when Harry emerges from the kitchen.
“Did you also have to follow him to the bathroom and ask me constantly why he wasn’t sleeping and why he looked sick?” Ron said. “Did you have to stay up at night and wonder where he kept going at night, and why he wasn’t talking to you or trying to bother you like he did every year before that? Did you have to contemplate missing Quidditch matches in order to follow him around some more?” Ron’s voice began to get a bit overwrought. “Did you, Harry? Did you?”
This was too much talking for Harry. “I did not attempt to murder – ”
“Can I stay in your flat?” Ginny says.
more like it,” he said.
on the
.” Harry had thought of second year, and hitting Malfoy with a tickling spell, and had to repress a smile.
“You’re welcome,” said Malfoy, voice posh and polite.
“If I’m glad you won.”
“You,” Malfoy said, sounding strangled. “Oh, just – come on. Let’s go to bed. You’re ruining my beauty sleep.”
“You didn’t have to try so hard,” Harry said. “To make me angry. I’m usually angry these days.”
They settled on one of the drawing room couches, the telly on a table they’d dragged in front of it, Malfoy cross-legged with his knees touching Harry’s.
with him. There was no escape, and if he was being perfectly honest, Harry didn’t want to escape.
As best as he could with Malfoy sleeping on him and a burning feeling of absolute mortification, Harry glared at Zabini and hissed, “You stole my bed.”
“That makes no sense at all, Potter.”
“We don’t
him. He was in love with Draco Malfoy and had been for who the fuck knew how long, and now he was doomed.
“Hi Harry,” Luna greets him. Her hair is braided in a style so reminiscent of Ginny, it must have been Ginny who braided it, and her eyes are wide and silvery under big, plastic glasses. Harry feels a rush of fondness towards her.
The first time Harry saw Draco Malfoy after the war he dropped his trunk on Ron’s foot amidst the usual rush at King’s Cross: bright-eyed children and their parents anxiously tugging them closer, hurrying towards the Hogwarts Express, the screech of owls and the faint whispers of people pointing to him and saying
Harry gritted his teeth. “Just give it to me, and I’ll come down when – ” He looked at Malfoy, who looked peaceful and still in sleep the way he never was in real life, mouth curled into an uncertain shape instead of a sneer. He remembered Malfoy murmuring nonsense in his sleep last night but he hadn’t minded. He remembered Malfoy helping him sleep, too. For a moment he thought about reaching out to touch Malfoy’s hair.
“Yes, alright,” Malfoy said, not looking directly at him. “I suppose I could have explained. I did say I lived in the Muggle world after the war, and, you know, the Malfoy accounts were frozen for a while – we couldn’t use magic, and – I thought I might as well get a job in the Muggle world, where no one would mind hiring me.” His hand went absently to his left arm, covered as it usually was by his sleeves.
“It was about time, honestly,” Ron says.
“Blaise doesn’t know anything about love,” Malfoy agreed.
“There he is,” Harry says, spotting Malfoy’s distinctive white-blonde head in a crowd of people near the entrance of the Muggle pub they’re all currently sitting in. Dean, Seamus, Neville and Luna aren’t here – neither is Padma Patil, and Harry thinks that must have something to do with her fight with Pansy – but Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Blaise and Pansy are, and now,
