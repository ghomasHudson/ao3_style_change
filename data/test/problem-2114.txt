Shrugging, the young man admitted, "They might have given me the chance to go straight to active duty. Said that my 'field experience' exceeded that of a few seasoned Aurors already."
After wolfing down the first few bites, Harry explained, "We found our missing librarians today, and they are kind of residing at Malfoy Manor for the foreseeable future."
"Oh," the raven-haired smiled to himself, pushing the package closer to him. "It's something I have collected these last few years."
Looking up at her pale friend who - despite all hardships still tried so hard to make their world a better, a safer place - the young witch smiled and promised. "Always."
Either Malfoy had learned by now that it was useless to argue with Harry once the Gryffindor had made a decision, or he was still rattled by the threat of being returned to Tom's former headquarters. Though the injured Auror had to be stabilized on his way to the front-desk, Draco did not intervene when he tried to check out against medical advice. Ginny did not bother either, just stepped up to the desk, five minutes into the argument, informing the nurse decisively, " Mr Potter is leaving, do you need him to sign any papers?" When the dark-haired witch started to protest once more, the young redhead interrupted easily, "No? Great! Have a lovely day," before gently nudging Draco and Harry towards the floo in the entrance hall. Anybody who tried to interrupt their path was met with an icy glare that would have done Draco's mother proud and three minutes later they could call out, "Number 12, Grimmauld Place."
Looking at the familiar potion recipes one last time, Draco caressed the clean lines of the notes. How he could not have recognised them right from the beginning was beyond him. Maybe he just had not wanted to know. Well, not any longer. Nodding, he confirmed, "I am ready."
An angry glint lit up Snape's eyes, "I never turned my back on you! I have always done my best to protect your family. My godson!"
"I am grateful that my son is willing to fulfil his duties towards his family. However, I do not expect him to live a life without love. Especially not if he might have found it already." The pureblood sighed and looked out of the window. "It has been different in the past. I have been looking out to increase our families glory so much that I did not even see what was right in front of me: that I was leading us down the wrong path. At one point, I was even willing to sacrifice my son's happiness, for it. But today … I would like to believe that I have learned. Now, I am grateful that Draco is willing to do is duties and wish for him to be with whomever makes him happy otherwise."
“Well,” he pondered. “I have to ignite the oven with a match and the fireplace in the library is kind of wonky.”
"They were important," Percy spoke up quietly. "Even when things were hard, and we did not see eye to eye because one of us was …"
"Gentlemen," the Lady Malfoy rose. "You will now take a seat, help yourselves to a nice cup of tea and a sandwich and listen to my son." When Chris Draca opened his mouth, she added sharply, "Without offering commentary!"
Closing his hand around Severus' fingers, Harry whispered, once more stubbornly not looking the man in the eye. "I don't want you to feel uncomfortable in your own home. I … I don't want you to leave."
Seeing his son pale, with sunken in eyes, sleeping fitfully on the couch, Lucius froze, once again mortified by the visible evidence of his mistakes. All he had ever wanted was to help the Malfoy name to greatness, as his father had brought him up to do. How could he have gone so wrong about that?
Before closing the door, a thought occurred to him. "Since I'll help clean this place to get rid of Voldemort's stench, I imagine that we will see each other very soon. If you bring milk, I'll offer tea to make up for the inconvenience."
Muffling himself with his hands, he started to tremble violently, before breaking to his knees. Whatever the spell entailed, it seemed to insist on him talking. Talking about things that were highly confidential in an - officially not even - ongoing investigation. Things that - if they came out - could make or break their case. After a few seconds, he cried out. Blood started to trickle out of his nose and, forcibly, his hands pulled back from his mouth. The scream that forced itself out of Lucius drew the attention of everyone present in the Atrium.
After a few minutes of casting, Neville turned around and did the same to the tapestry that contained the family tree. He then shook his head in confusion before repeating the spell.
," she emphasised, "is the only light-blue Aubusson carpet in the entire Manor. So, until our assets have been released and you can replace it, you will desist from ruining my fixtures, with your useless pacing!"
In a heartbeat, Harry decided and nudged quietly, "Go, change," while weaving his wand over the armchair, that stood beside the bed. He did not register Draco's smile, when the pureblood realised, that - while the cushiony chair had expanded into a large chaise - it would still be a tight fit with both on it. Still, he did not protest when he returned, clad in dark-green silk-pyjamas. The raven-haired had already claimed a place on their make-shift bed and wordlessly pulled Draco into his arms. It was not luxurious or even overly comfortable, but it was the best sleep they had gotten in a very long time. Neither noticed the sparks that drifted into the room, despite the closed window, settling over their precious patient. Nor were they aware of their quilt, travelling upwards, to cover their shivering forms, after it had slipped down mid-morning.
Sitting quietly on the bed beside her husband, clutching his hand, Narcissa Malfoy spoke barely louder than a breath, as to not disturb him. "It seems we are in your debt once again, Mr Potter. I knew that Draco was willing to do something drastic, but to be honest, I had little hope for him to succeed."
Looking between her husband and Snape for a moment, Hermione merely offered her forehead for a kiss before she rose from the armchair. "Sure, come on, Draco, you can show me where the good stuff is."
And all of a sudden, a door was there. It had always been there, Draco realised. He had seen it, from the corner of his eyes, because the dark, highly polished wood seemed so very familiar. But until now, a Fidelius Charm, entrusted to a house elf, had kept it concealed. Then the reality of what Kreacher had just said slammed into him. "A lab … a potions lab?" Draco asked hopefully, turning towards Harry.
With an amused glint in his eyes, the shaggy-haired blond tilted his head and challenged. "If you're so savvy, you undoubtedly know where we are as well."
When the gathered witches and wizards smirked at Draco, the blond snatched up the container with the chocolate mint ice-cream and took a humungous scoop before pushing it at Harry. His, "Shut up!" had all of them explode into giggles.
Maybe it was the outlook for a proper cup that didn't taste bitter or stale. Or the irritation by the house-elf's disrespect, that had Narcissa reach out for the cups, handing one to Harry while deciding. "We will take our tea in the dusty corner. You may leave." She then gracefully sank to the floor, draping her skirt over her legs before taking a delicate sip.
Hermione worked for the Department of Magical Law. Ron had taken his brother’s place at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, even before finishing his seventh year. He had, once again, become exactly what was needed, filling the hole – at least a tiny bit – Fred’s death had left in his brother’s life. So, cleaning up after the war fell to Harry – the boy who lived – and Neville – the boy who could have been the chosen one, had Tom made a different decision that fateful night. Both were glad that their friends were safe and would do their best to keep it that way.
Shrugging Luna replied, "It's a good arrangement. They help and receive food and shelter in exchange. The farmers around here cherish them. They think they are magic."
"No," Andromeda replied, forcing a small smile. "We are not alright, but we will get there. I just came to see you and Teddy and maybe get something to drink. Neither Narcissa nor I will be joining you for dinner, tonight."
Approaching her cousin, Poppy broke out in a broad smile. "Then let us make sure he is of good health before we allow them to experiment on him."
The fight was not over, despite Slytherins and Dumbledore's Army working surprisingly well together. The moon was already high in the sky when the last cultist admitted defeat. The Order of Phoenix surrounded the Minister as he walked over the field. Stoically, Kingsley looked at the wounded and dead until he reached the centre, "Who did this?" He inquired, studying the gutted leader.
When Harry staggered into his kitchen around six in the morning, he found Draco starring at a cup of tea, toying with the toast on his plate rather than eating it. The blond looked about as bad as Harry felt, though after the day slash night the Auror had had, he simply could not muster the energy to ask about it. With a bare grunt, he thanked Kreacher for the cup of herbal tea Luna insisted he drank at times like these when Draco finally mustered the courage to speak.
Staggering out of the floo, stabilizing Harry, Draco turned around to reach for the raven haired's bag, but Ginny merely shook her head. "Don't bother. I'll bring them upstairs and dash out to get his potions. You wrestle him onto a couch somewhere and make sure he stays put."
The young wizard had nodded once again, but apparently, that had not been enough. Caressing his neck, the Lady had cruelly dug her well-manicured nails into one of his wounds, until he had been thrashing on the floor. "You will address me as 'Mistress', and if I ask you a question, you will answer in kind, polite of course. Do you understand?"
Trying to take a deep breath, to expel the dust from his lungs, Harry winched from pain. Inspecting the back of his head, he hissed when it hurt like hell and his fingers came back sticky. Knowing his luck, the young Auror resigned himself to yet another laceration and possibly a concussion, judging from the way his brain throbbed. Still, they had more pressing matters to attend to. "Why?"
Tilting her head, the pureblood agreed. "You're probably right. Chances are higher for them to support one of their own."
Raising his eyebrows, the wizard challenged. "Considering that my potions have a far smaller chance of blowing up or colouring the brewer red and gold with their vapours, it is safe to say that I can brew in your kitchen!"
Allowing the young man to help him back to bed, not admitting - not even to himself - how drained he felt, the Potion Master sank back into the pillows, shaking his head, "That is not … what I have asked. Are you happy?"
“I tried to find the right spell to get him back.” The raven-haired choked, clawing at the armrest when he looked at the singed fabric where his godfather’s name ought to be. “But I can’t do it. No matter what I try, I can’t get it right.”
Once the food was gone, Harry picked up the tray with the dishes and nudged Draco. "Come on, I have one last Christmas present to share with you."
"I believe Walburga would contradict you there, but yes, the original plans were rather small. A ground-floor with two bedrooms and a tiny attic for the servants. There was a rudimentary cellar, but, as you can see, the house expanded over the years."
Swallowing compulsively, Lucius tried again, "I was in Lord Voldemort's inner circle. I committed crimes you sent others to Azkaban for. So why would you risk anything for me and mine?"
Closing his eyes, fighting down the tears, Harry slid down in his armchair. Had the Potter family had a tree like this? Their house in Godric's Hollow had been rather … moderate, not as grand as Grimmauld Place. Neville had told him that the Potters had been a well respected and a quite wealthy family. They had to have been since Harry had found no signs of either of his parents working. Sure, his mum had been a charms prodigy. But had she ever planned for making a living out of that? Or had her ambitions been satisfied with being a 'stay at home' mum? From the few, little details he had learned from Sirius, Remus and Severus, he could hardly believe that. In the end, it did not matter, because she had never had the chance.
Whipping around, the goblin studied him with narrow eyes. "In that case, you will, of course, let me analyse your spell!"
Grinning at the Potion Master, the Minister of Magic offered his hand, "It's good to have you back."
"I will do everything in my power to make that happen," the girl promised. "But from a certain point on, it will be up to you." Studying the coin she had kept on her person at all times, Luna mumbled, "Stonehenge. Not much time left now. Please, excuse me, Augusta, I have a message to deliver."
Chuckling, Hermione took the former Lord's offered arm. "On the contrary, I expect you to very much participate in our next activity."
Vanishing the whole mess with magic, she reached for a fresh piece of parchment and a self-inking quill. “What's wrong?”
The Auror's eyes flickered, avoided to look at Snape who sat at his accustomed chair at the table. Angling his body so the Potion Master was at his back and Draco in front of him, he nodded, "Very well, Draco Malfoy, did you brew a poison to kill Lord Alexio Rosier?"
The Potion Master, however, was unwilling to change the subject. Furiously, he accused, "Harry risked everything for you! Do you really think it endeared him to the public that he spoke up for a former Death Eater? He could still lose his job if it's discovered that you betrayed him!"
"What do you think they are doing?" Neville mumbled, guarding his plate of raisin cookies jealously.
For a minute, the wizard had done nothing. Merely attempted to calm his racing heart. Then he had prodded the wooden snake, first with his wand, then with the tip of his fingers. It had not moved.
Pondering for a moment, the former Auror tilted his head. "That the person coming up with it might have the right ideas to move our society past ancient pride and prejudice. Still, it would take some truly exceptional witches and wizards to make it happen."
Eyes snapping up, the former Lord had expected to see her apologetic for her lack of attention. Instead, his wife's eyes burned with irritation. "Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, I swear to you, by Merlin and Morgana, if you do not sit down this instant, I will tie you up and leave you, until Harry is expecting us. Even if I have to use my drawstrings!"
Calming herself, Narcissa gathered her composure before turning around while lifting her head. "Good afternoon, aunt Walburga."
"Thanks," Harry mumbled, briefly squeezing his arm before returning to the young Lady. She stood in front of the fireplace, and though her back was mostly shrouded in shadows, Harry could still see the trails of blood that marred her too slim back and the top of her legs. Taking a deep breath, he strengthened his own occlumency barriers. Astoria did not need his compassion right now. She needed his support. Therefore, he raised his wand and asked, "Ready?"
Sighing, tousling his hair, Harry mumbled, "I'll try, alright?" When the blond nodded, the young wizard looked at the horizon. "The sun will be up soon. We should get some rest."
He could not understand the meaning behind the gesture when the young wizard turned towards the mirror and folded his hands pleadingly. However, Lucius did not have time to think about it, since a moment later, George Weasley and a colleague of Harry - Charles Leewood if he remembered correctly - entered the room.
"Cosy," Kingsley commented. Yet, when the group of young witches and wizards gazed at him defensively, he merely shrugged and started to unbutton his robe. "Should we, Ladies and Gentlemen? I think Mr Potter's system is shy of an overload."
"Gods are a complicated matter. Until now, nobody has been able to prove or refute their existence conclusively. Most old families consider their house-gods a guiding influence. They believe that they provide protection and comfort."
Accepting the unspoken invitation, Draco curled up beside him. Sleeping together had become a comfort they both needed from time to time but had never talked about it in the light of day. "So, the case is closed."
The sun was touching the horizon, illuminating the strange group of former Gryffindors and Slytherins that lay side by side on the back lawn. Halfway through the day, Millicent Bullstrode had joined them. Blaise had been admitted to St. Mungos because one of the more volatile books in the Malfoy library had bitten him. After hearing what was going on, the newly admitted healer had clocked out after a thirteen-hour shift and joined them. Everybody had been immensely grateful since she could offer immediate help when one fireplace incinerated George's shoulder, and the former Lord Malfoy had a dizzy spell halfway through the afternoon. Millicent had checked him over and proposed a rigorous potions regiment to counter the negligence he had suffered in Azkaban.
After Hogwarts and magic and Horcrux versus Hallows, Harry had troubles reconciling everything that had happened with the picture of an arbitrary god, that guided everyone's fate. Also, it was easier not to believe in an almighty, divine power that allowed a baby to lose his parents and then be abused, in what was supposed to be his home for ten consecutive years.
"And, did it work?" Concerned, Harry scrutinised the little she-fox, who seemed a hairs-width away from starvation, but appeared determined not to let her new friend escape again. She japed and whined and scratched at his feet when Draco rose, only settling when the blond lifted her.
Stabilising his spine with a hand at the small of his back, the witch threatened, "I can cast a body binder. You are aware of that."
Somewhat confused, the wizard reached for the floo-pot as the girl bounded back into the room. "You are fast. I lost it just now. I wanted to show it to mummy and daddy. But … but if you are here, I guess that's okay." She held out her tooth. Yet, before the man could react, she closed her tiny fist around it. "Wait a minute! Where are your wings? Fairies need wings."
As Severus had expected, Harry found him a quarter of an hour later. He had retreated to the attic to brew another batch of Dreamless Sleep. They would need it until this situation was resolved. For such an addictive brew, it was a fairly straight-forward recipe, giving him time to think. For the Potion Master, brewing had always been the best kind of meditation.
Growing very still, Mdm Pince folded her arms as if she was trying to hug herself. "Once," she admitted. "But he only said that it was vital for the survival of our race. I never asked again." After a heartbeat, she looked up. "Will that be all, Auror Potter?"
"For the sake of my godson," the Potion Master replied calmly, "let us assume that he knew exactly what he was doing."
Yet before he could finish that sentence, a hissing noise drew his attention. "There is someone in the floo." Harry translated the information the wards were giving him. "It's for you."
A few tapestries had been rolled up against the wall. The young witch, however, seemed more interested in what was behind them. Using their combined strength, the two wizards had stabilised the carpets, while Hermione had pulled out a covered painting. Putting it on a sideboard, after removing the jewellery case, she had folded back the protective fabric.
Fortunately, the tents had been spread generously over the Weasley-Granger garden. Otherwise, it might have ended in disaster, when the three Gryffindors turned around and raised their wands, casting in one voice, "
With a content smile, Luna nodded to herself. "Of course, they are not broken in. But that does not mean that they won't tolerate a rider. I've ridden them since I was four." And then, she let go of Neville and approached the oncoming herd.
"I would be honoured," the blond assured, before inspecting them. "Harry, these are platinum with flawless emeralds. These are easily worth a thousand galleons!"
the skill-set to become an Auror - to help you. To fill the hole Fred has left in your life. This man works for you, twelve hours a day. He renegotiates your contracts with the ministry, to maximise your sales figures. Ron found suppliers and delivery companies in France on the off-chance that you
Smiling relieved, because finally, his friends looked more curious than irritated, the raven-haired revealed, "By eliminating the need for it."
Awkwardness reigned between the four since neither seemed to know where to go from there. Inari, trying to climb Draco's leg, broke the tension.
"Sure," the librarian threw a kernel into the air, capturing it with his mouth. "You three are better than any soap opera."
Hormones might be a suitable explanation, and before the Wizengamot Hermione would totally go with that. However, her best friends knew her better than to buy such a cheap excuse. So, she traded a look with her 'assistant' and while both she and Lucius straightened in their seats, Hermione started to explain, "Well, first of all, the spell Sandorn used could have had dire consequences. Lucius being tortured from resisting was nothing - no offence meant …"
Surprised, Harry shook his head, "You have never had Chilli? Prepare to be amazed! After the last few days of English Cuisine, I was craving something spicy. But don't worry, I brought yoghurt. In case it's too hot for you."
Shrugging, the pureblood reached for a biscuit. "I'll take it. It's not as if I really had a choice anyway."
During dinner, everybody agreed that the Malfoys would return to their home at the beginning of the next week, leaving Draco with Harry. Actually, the blond’s residency never came up, but when accidental magic made the goblets on the table vibrate, as relocation was discussed, nobody breached the subject of the young man returning home.
"They were brilliant," Hermione had remembered with a smile. "Fred and George opened their first joke-shop in Diagon Alley when they were only 17."
"We started going over the Potter vaults at Gringotts." Harry shared, rubbing the back of his head nervously.
Having already learned the basic of this strange kind of magic when Harry had gifted him and Luna with their jewellery, Neville added, "Or a number of things could happen, from blowing all of this to pieces, to apparating us several hundred feet above the ground, because then we would have fresh air and be able to talk to our colleagues easily. The fall that will kill us notwithstanding."
Once the adults had arranged all children on various sofas and armchairs across the living-room, Harry pulled out Hermione's battered copy of the Tales of Beetle the Bard, offering it to Narcissa. Quietly, he suggested, "I was hoping to be able to persuade you and Lucius to read to the children for a while, so we can all take a little breather." He gestured outside.
"So, you can do any colour?" The young Auror wanted to know, after puzzling through the first paragraph. Though potions were a requirement for the Auror corps, he had scraped his test by, with bated breath. While he had gotten better at the basics when no moody, gloomy teacher tried to make his life hell, he had never felt any particular preference of using a stirring rod over his wand, no matter how useful potions could be in the field. He knew how to brew a healing draught, a pepper-up and - most importantly - a hangover cure, though he usually had to prepare the later with a pounding headache. As a result, he had sicked up the potion twice so far, but afterwards, he had been cured. That still was a win in Harry's book. Hence, he was able to work through Snape's amazingly detailed explanations, entertaining ideas of various colour combination.
So, the three lingered. Hermione took Harry's clammy hand, but no amount of rubbing seemed to warm him.
Slowly turning bodily towards her, but unsure if he really wanted to ask, Severus demanded after a few moments, "Explain!"
"Good thinking," Harry grinned. "I was wondering why she wasn't underfoot as often these last few days."
"What the … but he was supposed to get out in ten months!" Daphne snarled angrily, but Harry just raised his hand. This was hard enough without an enraged Daphne cutting him off. "Hermione, Luna, Ron and I got the Wizengamot to reconsider his sentence since it had been us who had been imprisoned and tortured here five years ago." Forcefully pushing away these memories, he made himself soldier on. "Mr Malfoy agreed to enter the Rite of Compulsory Surrender with me, and since I am now responsible for him, I imagine I will spend some quality time here."
Now he let the retelling of her week wash over him, lulled to sleep by the dreamlike quality of her gentle voice.
Sidestepping Inari, who was bounding out of the kitchen as soon as the door opened, Hermione helped herself to some herbal tea while looking longingly at Harry's coffee. "Something just exploded on the third floor," she commented dryly.
Sighing, the young man looked towards his two best friends, who were sleeping the morning away. Maybe he should send them home. But then, Ron had come a long way with his transfiguration, the chair he had changed into an oversized chaise looked rather comfy, and Hermione was warmer than an oven these days. Maybe it was okay to be egoistical for once and keep them here for moral support. "My schooling was not what you would call 'uneventful'. Something was going on every year. The Triwizard Tournament was just one of many occurrences. But during my sixth year, things started heating up. The Order knew that the wards on the Dursleys' home would fall on my seventeenth birthday. So, they picked me up on the 30
"I am not sure that Astoria will be able to uphold her end of that bargain," Harry's quiet voice interrupted the two Slytherins.
Sipping bitter tea and grimacing at the taste of it, Harry wanted to know, "What makes you say that?"
Throwing a scrutinising look at Harry, then at the door of the master bedroom, Kreacher bowed so low, his nose nearly touched the ground and promised. "I will make sure that Master and Mistress will feel comfortable in our home." Then he vanished.
Once the two house-elves popped up, he ordered, "I need a pot of white-flower tea with a dash of honey. Can you do that, Emerald?"
"The very same," his partner confirmed. "But Harry, you can't brush off every threat, just because nothing compares to Voldemort!"
It was magic so old it was not even magic any more. As the first daylight washed over them, their very being was imbued with power, hope and peace. All wands were drawn, aiming at the ashes of the dying fire and without even a spell being whispered, the leftovers burst into a million sparks, shimmering in the sunlight, before they were carried away. The air around them was festive and reverent when the witches and wizards returned to the burrow. Though no words were spoken, their goodbyes were warm and sincere as the guests departed.
After failing several times at his given task, it felt good to tear down the plants. And though he could hear Kreacher share his misfortune of the exploding cauldrons with Harry, when the raven-haired had entered the back-garden, he could not even be bothered to snap at the elf. It was cathartic to let out his frustration by destroying something, so he did not want to be interrupted.
Bounding down the stairs, he shouted from the third floor, "I'll be back tomorrow at eight. Breakfast better be ready!"
Nodding, the woman replied, with a benevolent smile. "That would be lovely, thank you Mr Longbottom, Mr Potter."
Narcissa however, had shared with the somewhat shy half-blood at the man's side, how very concerned their 'Saviour' was, about his timidly growing relationship with her son. She had hinted his worries about the public opinion of him 'going dark' and how Lucius and especially Draco were thriving to prove their change of hearts from their Death Eater days. Narcissa had hinted how anxious they all were to not put Harry in a bad light when he had saved their lives, and how the young Auror might even consider sharing his concerns with the press if he believed himself to be portraited justly.
Knowing that he would not win this particular argument, Harry stepped back, but mumbled irritated, "The Dursleys had me cook for them since I started elementary school. I am absolutely able to heat canned soup!"
As with Hermione before, Harry's backside instantly hit the armchair he had just passed. Still, he looked around anxiously.
Forcing himself not to chuckle at the absurdity of the situation, Severus had merely taken another sip and decided, "I am quite content. Thank you."
"I claimed responsibility for the family-tree, by word and blood and magic. Though no matter what I tried, Sirius’ name would not take hold." Narcissa explained. "All the time, I thought I was too weak. That Walburga simply had been so much stronger than me when she had cast her magic. It made sense, since I did not even have a wand but maybe … maybe I had it wrong from the beginning. Maybe it is not about the strength of the magic …"
"No," Draco sighed, "I did not mean Aconite. We were standing beside raspberry bushes at the time. Yet my point still stands. This is as much my fault as it is yours."
Laughing out loud, the young wizard sank to his knees and hugged her. Her first service and nothing had been broken. "That was brilliant, Emerald, absolutely brilliant!"
Passing him by, Harry merely put a hand on his shoulder, before heading towards the stairs. He remembered all too well the feeling of having his own wand returned to him after he had thought it damaged beyond repair. When he was at the door, Draco called out, hoarsely, "Potter, I … thank you."
Sliding out of his chair, approaching their office garden, the young Lord Longbottom nodded, "Of course."
Seeing Harry unbuttoning his robe though the window while approaching the garden-shed, the man nodded, "I might have an idea, as should you, also your fiancé and, I imagine, every Weasley out there. But now, you'll excuse me. I have some stirring to do."
Bitterly, the young wizard laughed, "I'm a convicted Death Eater, bound to the 'Saviour of the Wizarding World'. That does not particularly scream 'eligible bachelor'."
Floating over the tray, gently setting it down on the desk in front of the window, the elf insisted, "Sir has to keep up his strength. Mistress was very insistent that Ruby made sure Sir is eating properly."
Gazing at the horizon, the young woman replied, lost in thought, "The herd has been uneasy these last few days. But I think white and black will go along quite well. I'm concerned about Teddy."
The journey to the bathroom was the next logical step. Yet, all of a sudden, Severus had to suppress the trembling of his limbs. This was the first time, he was about to walk in five … nearly six years. Potter's charm should hold, but what if his legs would not? What if he remained bound to his bed for the rest of his life? However, before his anxiety could increase to panic, Severus felt a warm hand reaching for his arm, strong and steady. Looking up, he found Harry's warm, green eyes gazing down at him and the young wizard promised solemnly, "Don't worry, I will not let you fall."
They had switched allegiances too quickly and a part of Ginny was seriously worried about that, since they might switch again, as soon as a more sensible solution than aligning themselves with Harry Potter came along. For now, however, they seemed sincere and Neville had assured her that the Oath of Compulsory Surrender would keep the Lord ... former Lord ... Malfoy from harming Harry in any way. A part of her abhored knowing the pureblood by her friend’s side. After all, her past experiences with him were less than stellar. However, Ginny trusted Harry, so she asked easily, "I was about to step out to fetch his potions. Does any of you need anything?"
"Thanks," he croaked when Ron stepped up to the bed, gratefully accepting the sips of water his friend offered.
"Exhausting," Harry mumbled around a piece of bread before forcing it down. "Sorry," he used the napkin – Narcissa would be so proud – before replying. "Neville and I were at the office until 3 a.m. Then we took a cat-nap on our couch. After tea and a biscuit, we started revising evidence from again at 8 a.m. Had Robarts not kicked us out an hour ago, we would still be at it."
Even the carpet underneath them began to move, prompting Narcissa to scramble back. Harry, however, remained seated on the floor, looking around in awe, slowly rubbing the tears out of his eyes. He hissed something, and the Lady Malfoy felt uncomfortably reminded of the Dark Lord. Then, however, the young man said something else, gently brushing over the snake-designs that had been carved into the couch table. And though it made no sense whatsoever, because Narcissa had never been able to understand parse tongue, she sensed the young man's words to be soothing. With Voldemort, the snake language had always sound vicious, even cruel at times. But when Harry used it, it was different, less unsettling, that was certain.
"You, you idiot!" His best friend sneered, all the while clutching his right hand desperately. "Who else?"
"It doesn't matter." Wrapping his arms around her from behind, lacing their fingers in front of her stomach, Ron gingerly kissed his wife's hair. "We have done everything in our power to make sure that fighting like that won't ever be necessary again."
Ron looked over his shoulder, where he could see his best friend talking animatedly. "He can see us if he turns. Though, I just don't see him doing that any time soon."
With a gentle smile, Emilia pushed back her chair and encouraged, "In that case, let us go and make sure that he reaches that point again. It will be hard work, but I am sure with your and Harry's help, we will be able to get him back to his cauldrons."
"Fred," Harry wailed, clutching the trinket in his hand, reaching out for the ghost. But in the end, he merely mirrored Fred's former gesture before letting his hand fall.
It really was as easy as expressed. Though they all had to clench their teeth against the magical overload, after but a few moments Harry sagged on the floor, breathing a little easier.
With trembling fingers, Draco closed the second to last journal. He had not wanted to believe that Potter would betray their teacher’s trust, but proof to the contrary lay spread out before him. The blond had spent quite some time these last few weeks rationalising away similarities between the recipes in these books, and the potions he had been taught at Hogwarts. But now Draco was at the end of his tether. One way or the other, he and Potter had to come clean.
"I have learned to see the man you have become instead of a mirror image of your father I expected you to be."
For a while they wandered aimlessly, checking this and that, letting the magic of the castle guide them. Hogwarts seemed to get bigger at every turn, leading them to new discoveries every hour. It was nearly time for dinner when Neville asked the question his friend had hoped to be able to avoid, "And what about Lucius?"
This is not, I repeat NOT a trend for this new year. I just wanted to give you this new chapter as kind of a 'Happy New Year' :). Also, DarthKrande is an amazing beta, who works swifter than a pixie ;).
Chuckling, Harry hovered beside the older wizard, his eyes alight. "Then catch me if you can!" Then he leaned over the handle, bursting into the star-filled night.
A knock on the door spared Harry once again from an immediate reply. Yet, when he stepped aside, to reveal the latest guests, he could only smile. "Not only my friends, or so it seems."
The librarians were making fantastic progress. By now, they had a good idea on how to 'jump start' a squib's core. The problem was of how to implement their solution. The highest chances of success had a combination of ritual- and rune-magic, combined with a strict potion's regime beforehand. Regrettably, neither the ritual nor the potions existed for now. Also, nobody could say if they would bring forth enough magic for the squibs to attend Hogwarts. But that was a challenge they could rise to afterwards.
The young witch flinched when Harry reached out for her. Immediately, the Auror slid back and raised his hands in a placating gesture. "It's alright. I won't touch you without your permission. But we need to get you cleaned up and … and you need to apply the salve. Do you think you can do it yourself, or do you want me to wake Draco's mum?"
Brushing away a dark smudge from the corner of his eye, Lydia Blackwood had decided. "It's a little sloppy, but there is room for improvement. Tomorrow, I want to see crisp lines to draw attention to your gorgeous, mercurial eyes."
"I know I have done bad things to Severus. But you are awfully forgiving for someone who had been faulted by him so much."
Therefore, when his team-leader stormed his and Neville's office, the raven-haired did his best to keep up, prepared to intervene, should the man prove rude or - god forbid - insulting. However, Harry froze at the door when he spotted the man approaching Narcissa. The Auror was currently executing a bow that would do Draco proud, reaching for the Lady's hand, indicating a kiss. His tone was perfectly polite when he stated, "Lady Malfoy, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Alexander Pince and I am the leader of the task-force you courteously agreed to help. My colleague, Mr Potter, has informed us that you might be able, and more importantly willing, to offer invaluable insight for our case. Let me assure you, that we are grateful for your time." Offering his arm, he guided Narcissa towards the door. "Please, allow me to show you our shared office."
For a few minutes, they sat in companionable silence, before Draco rose again. "I have to go back to my task. Have you eaten?"
"Lucius Malfoy's cane, the one that spat out a protective bubble during his first trial, you remember it?"
"In seventh year, I hid it in Greenhouse 2. Students know enough by then as to not touch anything without instructions, and Pomona kept an eye out for me."
Doubtful, Pince considered, "Hermione Granger has been abducted, is two thirds through her pregnancy, and you expect her to be able to do enough magic for you to locate her?"
Therefore, the raven-haired Auror shifted his assignments to attend the Wizengamot session personally, not intending to allow anybody to give his thrall any grief over what he was doing. Neville had promised to find someone to have his back, in case of emergencies and Head Auror Robarts had sworn to assign him only paperwork today.
The next time Harry opened his eyes, a huge, black man sat behind his desk. Reaching for his glasses, he pondered, "Am I hallucinating?"
"Nothing eludes your cunning eyes," Harry smiled. "And since I am sure you will find that I have cast the Tempus as well as the alarm spell, we can put this unfortunate matter behind us in an instant. Inquisitor Greengrass, would you do the honours?" He handed over his wand.
Forcing his eyes open, Harry was treated to the sight of Luna slipping past Draco, gliding into the room. The young man's protests died on his lips when she slipped off her shoes and sat cross-legged at the bottom of his bed. The innocent audacity of Luna Lovegood overwhelmed most people. Fortunately, Harry had gotten used to it. Especially during his final year where they had shared several classes. Too few seventh-years had returned, so more than one class of per subject had been unnecessary. A year with all four houses in classes like Transfiguration, Charms or Potions had surely been an experience Harry would never forget. It had done a lot of good for the house-unity, that was for sure. "Hey, Luna."
With a tired smile, Andromeda shook her head. "Please, don't rouse my nephew, on my account. I am sure Cissy and I will manage."
The pureblood had not seen Harry smiling at Narcissa, gesturing for her to follow. What he noticed was her catching her breath when he shook out the high−collared robe that had been delivered. The material was unbelievably soft and fell perfectly over his frame. The colour was such a deep green it appeared black with dark onyx buttons that reflected the light in a multitude of hues. Scrutinizing himself in the mirror, noticed that it really brought out his eyes and accentuated his white hair.
Testing the mattress before making a small incision, Hermione revealed, "Arthur read this book before Ron's and my wedding. I can't remember the title, but it was about this female pirate, who gets locked up at one point and can free herself because he has a barrette that is something like a lock picking tool. He was fascinated with the idea and decided to make me one. As soon as George heard about the project, he barged in, so now I have a slide with a knife, scissors, pincers I think and maybe even a lighter thrown in. Every time I check it, it's a little different, but it always contains what I need at the time. It must have taken Arthur weeks, if not months, to create it."
Grumbling, Snape challenged, "And will I get set hours as well? And if I don't exceed them, I get pudding in the evenings?"
When Harry knocked on Draco's bedroom a few minutes later, he received no reply. Opening the door just an inch, he noticed the room to be empty. Looking for his companion, Harry found the blond in the lab, staring at the blackboard. It was filled with equations and gibberish symbols the Auror had no hope to decipher. After a few moments, he spoke up, "Draco?"
"Everything is fine," Neville assured Harry. "I'm here on personal business." Looking at the Malfoys, the pureblood inquired, "Since Luna and I helped you at the Manor last week, I wanted to ask if you were amenable to return the favour?"
Harry could understand the sentiment. Nobody would enjoy hearing that his godfather had been chosen for 'political' reasons.
"A cage," Harry informed him off handily before he returned to discuss his New Year's Eve plans with Narcissa.
Many former Hogwarts students, mostly former DA members, would join them. From what he had heard, even Ginny might be in town. He never envied her the fame she had gathered, since signing the seeker contract with the Flying Harpies, right out of school. After the war, they had decided that the idea of a relationship had been better than the reality of it. Still, he missed her and could not wait to hear about her latest season. Last time she had been in London, she had even promised to make time for them to spend a day together. Going out with her on occasion helped to keep the rumours about their relationship alive and him off the list of the most eligible bachelors. A win-win situation in his mind.
Confused by the sudden change of topic, Harry straightened. “It readies my requests phonetically as if it’s trying to misunderstand me on purpose. I even tried spelling, but – as I said – it reads what I say, not what I intend.”
Feeling distinctively unsettled by the idea of being banished to the cellar, Draco spoke up, "I don't think …"
At Draco’s pained noise, Harry briefly reached out and brushed his thumb over the blond’s wrist. “Yes, I could,” he agreed readily. “But what good would that do? You have extensive knowledge of our laws and a unique insight into the minds of Death Eaters. You can do a lot of good. What would I be if I denied you that chance?”
"Go, pick up your baby-girl," Harry smiled, hugging Ron for a moment, before switching to Hermione. "Thank you, guys. I don't know what I would have done without you."
a Potion Master, as of this week. There is no one better at Ritual Magic than Manson. And Narcissa cares for the medical side of things. However, she's the only 'not-expert'. Should we do something about that?"
"Do you want a Calming Draught?" Draco offered and immediately tensed when she replied with a sharp, "No!" After a heartbeat, Astoria explained a little more composed, "Alexio … he had the tendency to introduce potions into my diet to … make me more compliant."
In the end, they agreed that Ron, Hermione and Harry would push the boundaries of the laundry room, to create some wizard space. Having learned from his father, Ron wove that spell skilfully, creating a new nook with a big window, so both Emerald and Kreacher had enough room for two beds and a little play area.
"Also," his father added, looking into Draco's eyes calmly, "Please don't forget to make a note if you check books out another from our library."
Grinning, Harry relaxed back into the chair. "Thank me after you have tasted it. The first time, Andromeda and I came up with the final mixture, it nearly blew out my brain."
With a nod, the blond agreed. "I will go to the library. This is not a life or death situation, so we have time. Uncle Sev is fine now. Maybe he will need a muscle relaxant in a few days, but this should be a standard potion, not requiring a mastery at all. So, I'm sure I will be able to come up with something that helps. I can always have him tweak it later." After a moment, he added, "Maybe we should talk to him about what we have done. That I've read his journals I mean and worked from them."
"But I, …" Teddy whispered, "I did not get my pancakes because the bad men came." Once more, the older wizards shared a glance, but neither said a word. "I could not understand them. Nana just started teaching me French in January, but they were really loud and sounded really mean. Nana pulled me behind herself, but one of them snatched me and shook my arm. I started crying because it hurt really badly and Nana tried to draw her wand, but she didn't. The wizard started shouting at her and squeezed me harder. She started shouting back and then the other two wizards did as well, and it hurt so much, and I thought they would hurt Nana, so I bit the one who held me and … and he let go, and then Nana reached for me and we appa … apparated away."
Reaching out for the blond, Harry flinched back, when the other wizard startled violently. "Hey," he soothed, "it's okay. What's wrong, Draco?"
Narrowing her eyes at him, Hermione pulled over his plate and started devouring the rest of his lunch, before finishing her cake and milk, challenging him wordlessly to say something.
"No!" Ron whispered, his fingers trembling when he recognised the deed for Weasleys Wizard Wheeze. Fred's name had been crossed out with golden ink, 'Ronald Weasley' replacing it.
Looking up from the puff pastry he had spread out over the kitchen table, the young wizard was surprised to find Lucius hovering at the door of the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. The bad conscience of the man was palpable, and the young man might have been tempted to laugh, but the thought of this man, his vassal, the person he had saved from the Dementor's Kiss believing him capable of collaring and caging someone, his son on top of that, killed all sparks of humour.
"And, of course, we will keep an even closer eye on our parolees and their masters and mistresses from now on. To prevent a repetition of that unfortunate event and to keep our fellow citizens safe, of course."
Shaking his head, rubbing his eyes, Harry cleared his throat before adding in a hoarse voice. "And the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have powers the Dark Lord knows not. And either must die at the hand of the other, for neither can live while the other survives." Swallowing heavily, the boy-who-lived turned away from the window, where he had kept his gaze trained on the desolate garden, looking at the white-haired man. "He marked me as his equal, gave me that scar but until the very end, he could not understand the power that made me return after he had killed me. The ability that enabled me to finally defeat him."
"Neville and Luna might be around for a few days this month. Usually, in springtime, they do something in my garden." When Severus merely tilted his head, Harry wanted to know, "Do you want to tell the Weasleys?"
As expected, the interrogation of the little elf was all but useful. Accusations of Lady Blackwood abducting someone were outright denied. The very concept seemed atrocious to Ruby. Referring to Draco as a 'guest' kept the violent rejection at bay. Still, she would not reveal a single thing that could be used to pinpoint Draco's location. It seemed that bringing in Kreacher really was their last option. However, when Harry explained to his house-elf what was expected of him, Kreacher seemed utterly puzzled. No successes on that front either.
Piping up from the fireplace, since she had not left the room when the rest had departed, Narcissa wanted to know, "What about my ring?"
First mission accomplished, the three wizards strolled along the paths, inspecting this tree or that flower to find the perfect token of Teddy's affection. The boy was especially enamoured with the fifty feet tall oak trees, those would certainly be sturdy enough for climbing, something Teddy thought a requirement for a 'sensible' tree. He was quite disappointed when Harry and Draco informed him that 'climbing' would not be happening on any tree Teddy could grow. Even with magical means, it was not possible to squeeze the development of a decade into a few short months.
Smiling benevolently, the Head Auror put a comforting hand on his young employee's shoulder. "Nobody expects you to do everything by yourself, Harry. You have done your part. Now, you need to ask for help."
"Say's the one who argues daily with the snake embellishment on his mantle-piece because the decoration does not like the soot that comes with floo-travel."
Crossing his arms over her chest, glaring down from the lovely surroundings of a Tuscany Villa, she spat, “And pray, how would you have me address the oppressor of the last living member of the Black family?”
"We do," Draco agreed, and Harry added somewhat apologetic. "And we are sorry for making you come in so late."
However, despite his glare, Neville seemed relaxed, amused even; a far stretch from the jittery child he had been. He chuckled under his breath, apparently not feeling insulted by the insinuation. "They gave me an Order of Merlin 1
. So, what happened? Why are the two of you not together, raising the statistically 1,17 perfect children, our couples have on average, in the perfect house, with the white picket fence your fairy tale books are all about?"
Harry touched his healed nose in wonder, he had barely felt the spell, while Draco was already pounding on the door. "Emilia, … Mrs Nightingale …! Please, open up! I understand the problem now. I can help Uncle Sev." He waited barely three seconds before raising his hand again when the medi-witch opened the door. Without offering any kind of explanation, Draco pushed past her and practically scrambled for the bed, picking up the photo. Gently he shook his godfather awake. As soon as the man opened his eyes, Draco reached for his hands, rubbing the wrists soothingly. The moment he had Severus' attention, he repeated the man's words, only now with context. "Lucius is a danger to Harry. He was always loyal to … to Voldemort. He lied in the past, to stay out of Azkaban. And since he is here at Grimmauld Place, Harry is no longer safe here. Therefore, he should leave."
"Potter!" Massaging his temples against an upcoming headache, the blond explained somewhat strained. "The Blacks have been a dark family for centuries. In here you will find more books on dark magic than even in the Malfoy library."
Taking half a step back, Bill cautioned, "Harry, the magic around here feels really malicious." It was dark, nearly suffocating.
“Because I won’t work in a house where the blood of not only my best friend Hermione Granger but countless other victims covers the floors. Voldemort has lived in this house for three years. His stench covers every surface. Can you imagine how I would feel walking these rooms?”
Ron fell into a chair after reading the message. Quiet sobs, he desperately tried to muffle, shook him. Harry could only offer comfort, wordlessly squeezing his friend's shoulder. "That's good to know … I …," What more could he say? While it was a relief to hear that both Draco and Lucius, as well as Hermione and Hugo, were okay … for now, Harry felt incredibly helpless. His head seemed to be filled with wool. All the terrible 'what ifs' were bouncing around it.
And, as expected, the horses slowed and started to circle Luna, nipping on her hair, her dress, her fingers, until she fed them the sugar cubes she carried aplenty. After a minute, she held out her hand. "Come on, Teddy, join me."
I'll have to leave you with a nasty cliffhanger with this chapter, but otherwise, it would have gotten too long. I hope you enjoy what is happening in the meantime.
"Good, old-fashioned revenge, for taking her toy and preventing her from gaining another? You know, some people are petty like that."
Of course, Draco had recognised her immediately, since not only had Harry told him about Dolohov's execution and the witch whose acquaintances had attacked him, the Daily Prophet had also published quite an elaborate article where Lydia Blackwood had featured on the front page. She had looked at him like he was a little puppy, not yet housebroken, but adorable still. Ignoring the havoc he had caused, she had ordered him to clean himself up, dress in what was provided and expect her in an hour.
When Severus merely looked at her, she elaborated, "A muggle in a five-year coma would have wasted away. He would be nothing but skin and bones, no matter how much 'nutrition' they would have pumped into his bloodstream and how much 'physical therapy' they would force on his body. The patient would be unable to sustain itself. When …
Once the pair was gone, Harry turned towards Narcissa, unrolling the diagnostic, "Explain this to me, please."
"Sure," she shrugged. "It was essential for Harry to learn how to close his mind to Voldemort, back at Hogwarts, when they were still connected through the … through his scar."
Emerald, however, did not let this criticism bother her. "Sir-Master-Harry said 'brilliant'. Now we play!"
Taking a deep breath, Harry put the cup back on the table, like a peace offering. “Lucius Malfoy has the knowledge and desire to help us. All he needs is the opportunity.” Holding up his hand to ward off an interruption, he continued. “I know you don’t trust him, Sir, and honestly, it would be naïve of me to expect you to. But we are stuck with this case, and we all know it. We need help, so, I guess what I am here to ask is: can you trust me, to take this chance to make things right.”
"Yes, you did!" Harry interrupted his companion. "Without you, we would have never been able to brew the antivenom."
When Draco came around the next morning, he noticed his three companions laying side by side, their fingers entwined over Hermione's belly. The moment, he stirred, a weight lifted off his back. Embarrassed, the blond realised, that he had slept on Potter's chest … like a lover. Yet before he could reminisce on the thought, Ron stated, "You drugged us."
Gesturing his guest back in the chair, Harry shrugged. “Yes, I know how it feels to be assaulted by nightmares day in and day out. And, yes, I know how it feels to go hungry. But that’s not what you came here to discuss. What about your father?”
On their way to Harry and Neville's office, Alexander Pince pulled the younger Auror aside and hissed, "I do not appreciate you going behind my back, Potter! You might be Robarts' favourite pet, but that does not make you in any way special! You are still a member of
"Oh, for Merlin's sake," the blond huffed exasperated, grabbing the small fox at the scruff of its neck. "Charles, if you could assist me, please."
It seemed that Draco shared this sentiment, since he chuckled, glancing at the page Harry studied. "Yes, we can even do Gryffindor red with golden stripes. Now hush, I have work to do."
Nodding slowly, Ron held out his hand. "Dreamless sleep it is." Once Severus handed over the vial, the redhead looked at his best friend, "I'm sleeping with you tonight."
So please, be patient and know that this story receives a LOT of attention from me at the moment, I just can't share it right away.
After dusting herself off, Astoria offered a perfect courtesy. "Mr Malfoy, Lord Potter-Black, it is a pleasure to see you. Thank you for your invitation."
For a heartbeat, the pureblood hesitated, then he indicated a bow. "Of course, Harry. Have a good evening."
"Ronald," looking at his youngest son, and the two friends that stood by his side, Arthur could not suppress the loving smile, when he noticed the protective stance of the two, covering his daughter-in-law. "The friends you have made in your first year at Hogwarts forced you to face the reality of our world long before your peers. Where other children had the luxury of spending their formative years fretting over grades, clothes or the latest gossip, you learned to survive trials, your greatest fear, treacherous animagi and Dark Lords. The proof that you have chosen said friends wisely, is them standing by your side, even after the war was won. "Common enemies bring people together. But only once the danger is passed, can we see who our true friends are. Not all the choices you have made in your life were smart. But those that mattered were true. So please, join Charlie and me tonight, with your growing family by your side."
"No!" Harry gasped, slamming down his mental defences, as Severus approached his memories of Draco. Those were his, and his alone! Fighting off the restrictive hands, he stumbled back a few steps.
When Neville and Harry came around, they were curled around each other, both clutching their wands in a vice−grip. They could feel the drainage of the shield-ing spell both had cast instinctively, but since everything was pitch−black, they didn't dare to let off on their protective magic. Coughing and slightly pulling back from each other, they soon realized that they were trapped in a tiny cavern, surrounded by the remnants of the house.
Severus was just about to explain where Pendragon could shove his 'legacy', when Draco entered the room with a tray, approaching his mother, who sat on a desk, studying the potions both Severus and Draco had created, regarding possible side effects. When her son offered a cup of tea, she accepted gratefully.
"Don't worry," she smirked weakly. "Molly will be back any moment. She just stepped out to get Draco some food."
Four days into his recovery, his mind finally made the connection: What was Draco Malfoy, a former Death Eater doing in Harry Potter's home? And it was clear that he was not around to visit on Severus' behalf, since he barged into his quarters every hour of every day, in various states of dressing. Once he had even entered in his pyjamas, shouldering Potter aside, who had woken him from his latest nightmare, pouring dreamless sleep down his throat. The former spy had not been able to puzzle out the relationship between the two, too grateful to get at least a few hours of undisturbed rest.
Where Hermione and Lucius were clad in a dark colour, Ron and Narcissa wore a robe respectively a breath-taking dress in a light beige. Ron had chosen … had been given a robe with a cut that flared at the arms and the bottom ever so slightly, indicating an idea of the cut his wife wore. Narcissa's garment was hugging her figure perfectly. The material was shimmering, reflecting the light. The high collar gave her an even more impressive appearance. Though Ron dwarfed her in size, his matt robe could not rival the impression she made in her shimmering gown. All eyes were drawn to the woman who had … however involuntarily … hosted Lord Voldemort.
Curling up on Draco's bed, she waved her hand when the little white fox scratched at the door. If she allowed the little vixen into the bed, nobody was there to judge. And if she hugged the small, fluffy body close, burying her tear-stained face in the soft fur, that was nobody's business but her own.
"Maybe," Hermione pondered, heading for an empty table to finish their discussion before joining their friends again. "But Thompson decided just last week that we should start thinking about a case against these 'Children of Hecate'. Sooner or later, the Aurors will catch them, and he wants us to get a head-start. It's not a pressing matter, but Lucius is extraordinarily helpful."
After a hissed, but ultimately fruitless argument with her colleague, since Sandorn denied any and all involvement of what had happened to Malfoy, the barristers had remained quiet when the Auror had started his spell. Now, Hermione turned towards the blond wizard, who had acted as a calm sentinel in the opposite corner of the room. "Auror Goldsmith, would you…?"
Pulling back, Charles Leewood straightened and offered his hand to Hermione. "Mrs Granger-Weasley, Goldsmith will have my report on his desk by nightfall. A copy will be sent to you."
After closing the door, Draco wanted to know, "What did you mean, when you said, 'this version of your dad'? How many versions are there?"
Breaking the silence, Alexander Pince rose from his chair and made an inviting gesture. "Miss Boleyn, thank you for joining us." When the woman claimed his seat, he explained, "Lady and gentlemen, this is Anastasia Boleyn, who is kind enough to help us with the development of the tracking spells. No questions, outside of this case, will be asked, as they won't be answered." With a small smile towards the witch, he added, "Robarts went out on a limb to get her for us. So, please, people, do behave."
Touching the blond's arm, Harry reminded him, "He's awake now and getting better. You don't have to work yourself to the bones, Draco."
Since it had been a quite intense day, on top of him still not being able to make any progress with his liege, Lucius had bristled and needed all his composure to keep from raising his voice. Angrily he had narrowed his eyes at her and hissed, "I would say that you are entirely unreasonable Mrs Granger. I have proven to you time and time again that I am a valuable asset to your cause, and that I am doing everything in my power to support you with your every-day work-life, as well as your cases. Nothing I have ever done, since working with you, warrants this level of distrust." Pushing back his chair, he had indicated a bow, clenching his fists to stay calm.
Surprised by the expecting smile, Draco followed Harry's prompting of standing by his side, before the young wizard requested, "Kreacher, we are ready."
"The Malfoys are still carrying out their sentence," the goblin lectured. "Hence it would be unwise to include them in this business venue."
"Mum says you're expected for Sunday lunch. No excuses," Charlie informed his little not-brother before the Weasleys departed as well.
"Teddy!" Harry exclaimed scandalised, burning red to the tips of his ears while the two Malfoys could barely suppress a snicker.
"Oh, cub," Harry sighed, opening his arms to the child that scrambled out of his high−chair, faster than Draco could assist, flying into his arms. Hugging him tightly, his godfather mumbled into Teddy's hair, "No matter what you say, no matter what you do, I could never hate you. Never ever!"
The injured man had drifted in and out of consciousness, with his owl perching at the edge of the backrest, like some silent guardian. Would Draco be sent away as well? He had not wanted to listen in on the quarrel, but when his father had left the office to return to the Manor, the man had looked pale and barely in control. It had uncomfortably reminded Draco of the last time the former Death Eater had been around the Dark Lord. Still, he had kissed Draco's forehead and imposed on him to 'be good' before he had left.
Blaise had seemed to sage in relief; but still decided to threaten Harry that he would, 'Hex his sorry arse into the next decade, should he ever hurt Draco!'
However, after a moment, the Potion Master shook his head and gestured towards the leather armchair. "Sit," he commanded, before floating over a book. "Read!"
Too exhausted to analyse the situation any longer, the blond curled around Teddy from the right and rested his head on Harry's warm limb. This was warm and comfortable and safe. Within moments Draco was fast asleep.
With a soft smile, Irma looked at her nephew before she started counting turns. Before the first was complete, she faded from view. Wordlessly, the young Auror held out his hand, and surprisingly, Irma Pince handed over the time-turner that had appeared around her neck.
"Young-Master-Draco-Sir apologises for not taking lunch, Sir-Potion-Master." Emerald whispered at noon.
After a moment, a decision seemed to be made as Neville straightened. Looking at his former teacher, he stated evenly, "I wanted to say thank you, Sir, for everything you have done."
"You would …" Harry hesitated for a moment, but then pushed through. This was the safest course of action. "You need to be naked, or they will vanish as well."
"Antonin, I'm surprised to see you here." Lucius overly polite voice broke through Draco's rising terror. Yet, instead of being released, cold fingers brushed over his cheek in a mock of a lover's caress.
Sedated, Ron joined his friends, allowing Harry to claim the Lady's hand, indicating a kiss. "Narcissa, you look stunning."
Thinking back to those nights where he slept alone, versus those where he didn't, the young wizard realised that Bill was right. However, at the moment, he had no desire to discuss this. So, he merely nodded and changed the subject. "Alright, tell me, oh wiser brother, how much are they trying to rib me off?"
"I know," she sighed, sinking down on the stairs beside him. "They are fewer and farther apart, but still there. He rarely talks about them, though we think it would help." Taking his lack of reply as attention, Ginny advised, "Talk to him when you enter his room. Remind him where he is and when. Do not touch him. He tends to lash out when he is scared and not all there."
"Hi, Harry. Great breakfast. How was your weekend?" Neville rolled his eyes as he offered his part of the conversation before biting into his bagel. Once his first appetite was satisfied, he explained why he had gone on about Dolohov like a pixie in a cage. "First, because
Shrugging nonchalant, the redhead stated, "Not more than sixty to seventy percent. You are regarded by the goblins."
"Potter!" Pince sighed, massaging his temples. "I am well aware of you having friends in high places. But the Weasley-children are not even working for the Ministry. How do you plan to keep such a delicate operation a secret, if you bring in outsiders?"
Aware that there was literally nothing any of them could do that night, Draco knocked briefly before entering. Drawing his wand, he gazed at Harry, who had just jumped up from 'their' armchair. With a flicker of his wrist and a mumbled incantation, the chair expanded into a settee big enough for them both. Then he shuffled past Potter and stretched out on it. Once comfortable, Draco lifted his arm. After but a moment of hesitation, the raven-haired joined him.
"I was thinking pheasant. And we have a guest." Turning towards Harry, Astoria offered introductions, "Gina, this is Lord Potter-Black. Harry, this is Regina Charlton, my …"
Despite that being true, the other wizard stated, "Had there not been a wand, you would have found another way to take him out. He threatened me."
Immensely relieved about how his liege had handled the situation, the former Lord offered a deep bow and confirmed, "Yes, my Lord."
Scrubbing his tangled and matted platinum strands, Lucius forced himself to get a grip on reality. Potter would never harm his family intentionally. He was too ‘good’ for that. If he submitted, as the rite and the spell demanded, his wife and child would be safe.
His breath paused when reality caught up with him. He tried to move back gracefully, but Potter's eyes told him that he had noticed him tensing. It was not as if the other man did not have the right to touch him. By Merlin, Draco had offered him that privilege and more in exchange for the mere attempt of saving his father from the Dementor's Kiss. He had even defended that right when Lucius had stormed his room. Still, Potter taking these liberties made Draco uneasy, despite knowing how useless that emotion was.
Once the two witches had vanished, Ron croaked, "Does anybody else have the feeling that our lives might be in danger if we mess this up?"
"You want Narcissa Malfoy to be brought in on this?" Welsh clarified. "We have what we want. What could a pureblood woman with ties to the dark help us with? "
The next day went without Draco sharing either lunch or tea with Severus again. He also skipped dinner. Since Harry had been caught up at the Ministry, the Potion Master decided to take a light meal in his room.
Smiling, she replied, "The pleasure was all mine, Mr Malfoy. And it is Mrs Granger-Weasley when I am out of office. Just so you know." With a wink, she sent the pureblood couple on their way, apparating back to the ministry. For the first time in nearly three weeks, she was determined to finish early, so she could pick up Ron from work. It had been ages since they had had dinner and an evening to themselves.
The Aurors needed two full days to file all reports to wrap up their librarian-case before their team could be disbanded. The main problem was Mr Pendragon's insistence that the subject of their research was to be kept a secret. Naturally, Mrs Pince had agreed, seemingly only to make Harry's life more difficult. On Thursday, after Neville and Harry had finally settled back into their own office, a new case had popped up. They were still able to make it home in time for dinner since only exceptionally stupid thieves stored their loot in their own basements. Well … a life of crime and no particular talent for it brought their pair of burglars a weekend accommodation in a Ministry holding cell and a pending trial on Monday. All in all, quite a satisfying end of a workweek.
"Now, excuse me, Sir. It seems there is a slight misunderstanding with the Slytherin in question." With a respectful bow, Harry left the alcove to approach the calmer end of the ballroom.
Throwing his quill on the table, Harry shook his head. "None of this helps us with the Hecate Case!"
"It's like the wizarding world has done absolutely everything to preserve their traditions, fighting tooth and nail against any form of progress. Muggles have done so many amazing things in the last ten years alone. Do you know how much knowledge you have at the tips of your fingers if you own something as mundane as a personal computer? Muggle children could teach their pureblood counterparts the most amazing things if they would. Just. Listen!"
"Sorry," the ability of this man to make him feel like an unruly child was amazing. Still, Harry could not fight the feeling entirely. "I'm just worried, I guess. Pendragon purged the dining room, but Malfoy Manor and Voldemort are linked in the peoples' minds. What if they succeed in jump-starting a Squibs core, but the public won't accept it, because of where the research was done? Or because Narcissa was involved? I know she wants to help, but what if the witches and wizards of Albion can't accept her involvement?"
It seemed that the youngest Weasley sibling had developed a possessive streak a mile wide. From the grin they all shared, the entire family approved.
"Here is milk," the young witch pushed a gallon-canister into his hand, after entering his living-room. "And some decent tea. The last one left a lot to be desired. Where is the food?"
Debating with himself if he should give his vassal some privacy, the decision was taken from him when Lucius turned around and bowed his head. "My Lord."
“I am, but this is no social call concerning my parents, my Lady. This is about Draco’s.” Stepping aside to reveal his partner, with his precious cargo, Neville was ready to reach out and steady the woman, while repeating his request, “Lady Malfoy, may we please come in?”
The Potion Master had been surprised to find Emerald still standing on his bed, wringing her little hands. After his first sip, he had sighed contently, before gazing at the elven child.
With a half-smile, the raven-haired agreed. "I requested a certain potion. However, how he goes about creating it, is none of my business. I trust your son to act in my best interest, as per our arrangement."
Heading towards the cafeteria for a snack, Pince suggested, "Lady Malfoy is still wearing her bracelet, and as long as one of us stays with her, it should not activate. Maybe you could take her to Gringotts?"
He was scared. A small and distant part of Harry - the one that usually kept him alive in the field when curses were flying past him - could analyse the situation and judge it accordingly. But the majority of him was as terrified as Draco. Terrified that he had involuntarily harmed the man he had come to care about. So, instead of keeping his cool, he lashed out, screaming right back when Malfoy got in his face, "I showed him the bloody picture, just like you told me. So, stop being an idiot when it was your idea in the first place!"
Slowly, unsure if she should or not, the Lady Malfoy turned. There, in black robes with neatly pulled back hair stood Severus Snape. The first non-family-member who had been allowed to hold her son. The man who had stood at Lucius' side through even the worst of the Dark Lord's temper tantrums. The man who had sworn an unbreakable vow to protect her boy and had actually delivered, ensuring that Draco made it out of the war more or less intact. A man who she had buried and mourned nearly five years ago. "Severus," she breathed, flinching when Irma Pince was suddenly by her side, claiming the teacups.
In New Zeeland, he found flowers unlike any he had seen before. So precious and vibrant, that he acquired a whole kilo of different seeds and sent them home, along with a library of books about their cultivation for Neville.
"You have the strangest relationship with your elf. You are aware that Kreacher calls you 'Sir' but purebloods like the Malfoys 'Master' and 'Mistress'? At the same time, he identifies Grimmauld Place as your home. There is no rhyme or reason to that."
Eyes going wide, Narcissa lifted her napkin to hide her cough when a piece of meat went down the wrong way. Harry addressed her with forced casualty, offering more wine, had her look unsure between the two young wizards. "Actually, I am not sure if this vintage is to my liking."
With a tired sigh, Harry turned to look at her. "If not him, who else? Who could I trust with this secret? Who would put as much effort into helping Severus Snape as his own godson? Not because I tell him to, but because he wants to!" Once Sirius' name had been returned to his rightful place, Harry had acquired a new painting to offer Walburga access to this room. It might have been a little vindictive, but Harry felt that he had the right, after all the time and effort he and Narcissa had put into the family tree. Hermione had found him this one, called 'Dogs Playing Poker' sharing that it was somewhat famous … or more infamous, in the muggle world. Seeing it, Harry had instantly known that his godfather would have loved it, as one of the shaggy black dogs looked suspiciously like Sirius' animagus form, though with shorter fur.
"But I told you that I would care for dinner," Harry protested half-heartedly, inwardly curious what his best friend had brought.
Coming to a full stop, prompting the taller Auror to run into him, toppling them both over, Harry looked up, an evil grin spreading over his features. "You know what, Neville. You are a genius."
"That sounds quite liberal to me. But anyway, I did not come here to discuss my godson's future marriage."
Pressing his lips together, so they turned white, even against his already pale face, the raven-haired promised in a harsh whisper, "I'll do everything in my power to avoid that, Bill."
">If you are so set on doing this, at least do it in a setting where half the Auror Corp is present. I don't want any more trouble with your charges!<" Harry imitated their superior. "Still, it would help if they were on the arm of one 'hero' or the other."
"She's adorable like that, isn't she? All mellow and relaxed, before her brain wakes up and she's from zero to one-hundred in a matter of seconds," a warm, adoring voice stated.
"I'll be down in a minute," Draco promised absent-minded while cross-checking two journals he had spread out over his work-table.
Wiggling on her husband's lap to get more comfortable, Audrey explained, "We were on holiday in America this summer. And since Lucy and Little Molly love their flowers, we visited a muggle botanical garden. There was this whole patch of newly cultivated dragon-egg-plants. They had just been planted because they were 'pretty'. Percy recognised them from one of your books and stories and managed to talk the gardener into selling him a few of the fruits. We extracted the seeds and voilà. Harry put us in contact with Neville Longbottom and he promised to help should you need him, but suggested, that your own herbologists might know better how to grow them."
"It is your house after all, with me being a tenant. I could understand your desire to give your parents unrestricted access."
"Lucius?" Hermione breathed through clenched teeth, doing her best to keep Harry's lunch and her cake from coming up again.
"I could, but the answer would not change. I am an adult with enough knowledge of potions, full access to a functioning lab and a Lord who has given me free rein in it. So, until Harry tells me otherwise, this will be the research I put my time and effort into. If I'm at the end of my wit, I will come to you for advice. However, until then, I will explore every avenue to put the werewolf-gene that lies in my little cousin to sleep, so he can live a life free of his father's curse."
"Hey," the older Auror defended himself. "I'm not the one who collects Death Eaters like other people collect tea tins!"
Hermione shook herself out of her thoughts when George came to a swaying halt by her side. "That's one nasty piece of magic. But I think I have gotten the gist of it. You can release him from the spell now if you wish."
"Trading one husband for another, how can Astoria hope to gain freedom when marrying into the Malfoy family?"
Now, Harry studied the product of an hour-long writing effort, where Severus had practised the same fifteen words over and over until he had not felt humiliated to share the outcome of his pathetically rusty writing skills. It was considerably better than at the beginning, but still nowhere near his old ability. Now he prepared himself for being mocked for his pathetic attempts.
The patriarch of the most noble and ancient house of Malfoy had decided that he was not nervous, on the morning of the hearing. As his father had taught him at a very young age, such emotions were unbecoming for a Lord, even a former one. So, he merely tilted his head respectfully when his liege joined him and Narcissa for breakfast and forced himself to enjoy the egg his wife had prepared for him. The only sign of his not−entire−calm demeanour was his hands repeatedly straightening the slightly threadbare seam of his robes. For the last few years, no member of his family had spared any concern for their wardrobe. So even the most elaborate dress−robe he owned, was about ten years out of date.
True, Inari was in the last stages of losing her winter-pelt, but usually, Draco brushed her down at least once a day to keep her shedding at bay. Also, this was often the time his godson took his first meal. Yet the kitchen did not look used. And the house-elf was a picture of misery again, as he glimpsed hopefully out from under the sink, but deflated when he recognised Severus.
'You are scaring all of us,' remained unsaid, but looking around, Harry could see the fear in Narcissa's eyes and the thinly veiled terror in Lucius'. And though Draco had approached… even restrained him, the blond seemed to be on guard, as well. Hanging his head in defeat, Harry sighed. "What else can I do to prove that I am not Him?" He sounded so sad, desolate even, though his words were barely loud enough to be audible for Draco, who stood so close that Harry's hung head nearly touched his chest.
Frowning, his partner agreed reluctantly. Both flinched when Pince's fist hit the wall, accompanied by a very unsophisticated swear. "Aunt Irma might be down there! Trapped and in need of rescue!"
Neville was the first to speak after the tale was finished. "But if you have all this knowledge at the tip of your fingers, why abduct the others?"
Bounding down the stairs, Harry found his friend waiting in the living-room, surrounded by the three Malfoys who either wanted to know what was going on or fussing over the slowly healing cut over the Auror’s left eye. Entering the room, Harry merely traded a look with his partner, before he turned around, “Accio Auror’s robe.”
The Gryffindors knew the Slytherin to be right, they needed this, needed to face their fears. Still, this was nothing to Draco but a shabby tent, so Harry offered, "If you want, you can ask Charlie to trade tents with you. His one is much better maintained because he lives in it whenever he is out in the reserves that are removed from civilisation."
Through his work in Egypt, Bill was the one most familiar with such wide-spanning spells, hence, he took the lead. At first, they had been concerned about how to coordinate their efforts, when they were too far apart to hear each other casting. However, as soon as Bill started chanting, the magic seemed to travel along the walls and over the floors, actively connecting them. It hit Ron first, since he was closest. And when he began his part of the spell, Kingsley joining in a few seconds later. Their combined energies seemed to join the race. Harry felt it as well, but knew better than to start the binding, since half of the participants were still missing. With several wizards casting, their energies felt electric and undoubtedly strong. But the 'By Who Lived' nearly staggered, when the magic of Ginny and Hermione slammed into him. It was hot, nearly burning, lighting up his nerve endings so fast it bordered on becoming painful. Yet, at the same time, Harry go this impression of compassion and care that echoed through every syllable of their spell.
"Squibs," she mumbled, "I knew it! But … I never thought …" Pulling over some papers, she started to study them in more detail and soon she was engaged in an animated discussion with the other librarians. Charles joined them, fascinated by the magical theory, but delighted to play devil's advocate, poking holes in it.
"You won't," His wife assured him, kissing him for luck. "You have researched this case meticulously and know that your client is guilty as sin. Nobody will let him walk free. Not with the abundance of evidence you have helped them gather."
"My godfather was a good man, willing to give up everything - including his life - for Harry to win. He witnessed unspeakable horrors. Committed heart-wrenching acts to enable Voldemort's defeat. But the public only knows about it because Harry spoke up for him. No matter if you were his friend, without Harry, Severus Snape would still be a pariah amongst his peers. And we don't even know how the public will react to his survival."
Opening the latch for the central heating, the young man grinned sheepishly, before taking to his own beverage.
Taking in the picture, the nervous Hufflepuff who seemed so unsure if he was supposed to stand behind or in front of Ginny when facing her family, the head of the family nodded to himself. Yes, his little girl has made the right decision with her future spouse. "Ginevra, growing up as the seventh child could not have been easy. However, outside of bad external influences," Arthur could not help but glower at Lucius Malfoy for a moment, "and incredibly protective friends," he nodded towards Harry, "I was never worried about you. As soon as you were able to hold your first wand, Bill's for the most part, it was clear that you would become an incredibly strong and talented witch. You grew up in your brothers' shadows, but today you shine all the more for it. Tonight, you bring us not only a friend but your future husband, so please, join your mother and Bill in our circle, to complete it."
Speeding up their steps, the four burst into the kitchen, only to step back out and in again, making sure they had not entered an alternate reality. In their defence, the picture that presented itself was most unusual for a Weasley household. All children in attendance, sat at the enlarged kitchen-table that was adorned with mismatched plates, cups and glass-wear as well as all cutlery available in the house. That might not be that surprising, but nobody was loud or unruly nor reaching over his or her neighbours' plates for a certain dish. No, the children sat patiently, only nibbling on an assortment of diced fruits that lay on their plates. At the stove, in the middle of Harry's many food-containers stood Andromeda and Narcissa, preparing coffee and tea, slicing up rolls and reheating food Harry had prepared so painstakingly the day before.
"I'll go to bed now. I just wanted to ask if Draco ought to sleep with his parents, or if you want to make yourself comfortable here, Andromeda. I'm afraid all my guest−rooms are full."
"Mother?" Draco mumbled sleepily before shooting up from the couch wide awake. "Mother! Are you alright? What happened? Did someone hurt you?"
No matter how good Ron had become at brewing, Draco was still better, understanding potions on a level far surpassing his. Therefore, the redhead had no qualms doing the 'menial' tasks of cutting, dicing and grinding. In the beginning, the blond had been surprised, but his inquiry was met with but a shrug. "We all have a vested interest for this to work. You are our best chance, so I'll do whatever I can to support you. Just like I do with my brother."
Draco and Teddy grinned from one side of their faces to the other, presenting half a dozen doves the blond had managed to capture, his seeker-instincts serving him well. However, as soon as the child spotted the tip of a white snout, peeking out of Harry's collar, Teddy was upon his godfather in an instant.
Chuckling, Neville shook his head. "And would you like the bow around her neck to be green or blue?"
"Whatever," Harry yawned. Still, his wand was at the ready, before he even reached for the doorknob.
Pulling himself into a sitting position, winching ever so slightly, Harry inquired after a moment. "Why is the Minister of Magic sitting in my office?"
Kreacher was cracking two dozen eggs into a frying pan, while Emerald prepared a variety of tea and coffee choices. That left Harry free to start on the bacon and the baked tomatoes Draco liked so much. He swore violently when he nearly tripped over a white bold lightning that shot through his feet the moment the backdoor opened. "Bloody hell, Inari!" He hollered, desperately trying to balance the baking tray so the tomatoes would not roll off.
Chuckling at the elf’s familiar complaints about the ‘ruination’ of perfectly good meat, and his owner's 'plebeian' palate, Harry approached his office to start on his preliminary report. He froze when he found Lucius Malfoy sitting in his chair.
The moment the speaker aimed to plunge his blade into Draco's heart, several things happened simultaneously:
Raising his eyebrows, Harry gave food for thought, "Maybe, but one, it's not up to him! And two, don't you think my parents had someone wear their treasured jewellery, rather than them gathering dust in a dark vault?"
Studying his godson for a heartbeat, the Potions Master uncorked the vial and swallowed it in one go. Wincing, since the taste really did nothing for him, Severus allowed himself a minute to let the potion do its magic. When he felt the strain on his throat ease, he offered Draco a brief smile before he turned his full,
"Well, we are currently working on the potion that gives it colour. But I think it's not that far off," Harry mumbled, doing his best to hide his smile.
Usually, Narcissa was a paragon of self-restraint, no doubt an essential virtue, both for a pureblood of high standing, and someone who had been forced to live with Tom. Knowing that her son had yet to return, her obvious anxiety was understandable, so Neville tried to soothe her, “Longbottom, Lady Malfoy. And no, there is no problem. Yet, it might be easier for you to invite us in.”
"Yes, I am aware of your deal with Harry and I have no problem with you tending to him twenty−four−seven the moment he leaves this hospital. But how exactly do you plan on doing that, Malfoy, if you faint from exhaustion?"
All three finally looked at Leewood, who stared at his hands. After a few moments, he recalled. "We know that Welsh was the first wizard Drake 'recruited'. But what if that wasn't even his intention? What if he needed something at the Abbey and Welsh just got caught up in all of it, and things snowballed from there?"
Looking at each other, the librarians traded casual shrugs. "If we connect my floo to the Manor, that poses no problem." Christopher Pendragon stated.
Despite Harry growling at his friend for making fun of him, he had to admit that all these things had happened, so he promised, “I’ll be careful.”
That night, Severus had tried again. He had rested before tackling the last flight. Once he had had reached the bottom, he had brushed over the snake-bannister, the one that had come alive. It might have been his imagination, but the wizard had believed the railing to lean up into his hand just the tiniest bit.
Stepping back, the raven shook his head, “No offence, Ron, but the last time I did, I was sweating blue for two days.”
"Bullshit! That's bullshit, George, and if you would stop making excuses for her and everybody else, you would see that. You were identical; I know that we all know that since you enjoyed toying with people, posing as the other. But she is your mother. Looking at you, she should see George and nobody else! Fred is gone and deserves to be remembered. And you are here and deserve to live and be seen!" Turning around, watching the other Weasleys and Hermione, he had challenged, "Or does a single one of you believe that
At Harry's encouragement, she added a healthy amount of yoghurt, before cutting up a square of the 'cornbread' on an extra plate.
"You are aware that you cannot keep it?" Lucius asked after a while. He had debated with himself to find a way for his son to enjoy the gift that seemed so precious to him but had found none. "The boy himself said that he had intended to give it to Potter."
Putting on their gifts, Neville and Luna proclaimed, "We love it! Thank you very much. But now let's go outside and set up a home for your little fox."
"What do you want for lunch?" Severus inquired, holding out his hand, for Teddy to take, so the boy would not trip during his acrobatics.
The platinum-haired pureblood could not help but feel a tiny bit proud of his son, for having the guts to so openly ignoring the wizard who commanded his … well, actually, all of their fates, and being appalled at his lack of manners. He and Narcissa had raised him better! Lucius pondered if he should remind his son, but was concerned that he would be overstepping his boundaries.
The teacher Harry had had at Hogwarts would have probably elaborated on the stupidity of the master of a house, knocking on his own doors. Or how useless it was, to rouse a patient who was probably sleeping for a simple errand. But after everything they had been through, the 'boy who lived' was incredibly grateful for even such a short, monosyllabic answer. So, he merely tilted his head, "Essentially."
Lucius nearly tripped over his own feet in his haste to storm the kitchen where the Aurors were still discussing their lack of options over a late breakfast. "They are going to sacrifice him!"
"I am appalled," Severus interrupted, watching with disturbing intensity how Draco flinched at the reprimand. "Your ability to lie has become non-esis… existent. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
Chuckling, the witch tilted her head. "Thank you, Auror Pince, but if you allow me a little correction. Inquiries would be much appreciated if they start with 'Do you want some tea?' or 'Would you care for a biscuit?'. I'm always good with these."
“Oh, and let’s not forget about interior design. Let’s talk about bare necessities! Since we don’t have any money, we can’t even buy our own food without going through the ‘proper’ channels. If our gamekeeper considers something my mother requests a luxury, he simply removes it from the provision list without providing a substitute. We needed six bloody months to compose a list that got approved more often than not, though he still rejects random requests just for shit and giggles! We tried to grow our own food, but I’m shit at Herbology and mum’s barely better.
"Of course," the young man eagerly pulled out his wallet, revealing a small picture. "This is the head, and here you can see his heart, and they said
Everyone ready to do his job or support the Auror department, bloody well shut up!" He glared at the witches and wizards at the table.
"Rude. I know," the dark−haired wizard interrupted. "But he's the Black−family's house elf, and I surely won't guillotine him for his insolence and add his head to the gruesome collection, this family seemed so fond of."
"I know," he sighed, curling up in the leather armchair. "I had a fight with one of my colleagues." When Severus Snape merely looked at him, dark eyes digging into his very soul, he needed but a few moments to break Harry's reluctant defences. In an endless stream of chatter, the young Auror shared every last detail of his case, the research the librarians were doing and how Narcissa was supposed to help. After more than half an hour, he ended with a weak, "But don't tell anybody, please."
With a simple gesture, Harry sent Kreacher to scout the place while he and Neville scanned their surroundings. Having an elf at their disposal had proven one hell of an advantage. While most witches and wizards guarded their homes against intruders, they rarely took the strong magic of their most loyal servants into account.
Holding him back, before he could flee and not be seen for the rest of the night, the young wizard instructed, "Take a few of the black napkins from the dining-room. The satin will be smoother than these rags, and we can change them whenever necessary. Also, we will talk about sleeping arrangements. So, return when you are finished."
"And you denied all involvement!" The young Auror snapped. Really, he was too tired for this and Draco was not making any sense!
"No!" Harry protested forcefully, his face turning a flaming shade of red. "Please, don't," he begged weakly.
Harry wanted to reach out but did not think that Draco would appreciate the gesture. So, he merely shrugged. "We will see about that tomorrow."
"You bet on Severus Snape kissing Arthur Pendragon's descendant?" Harry was shocked after the witch had shared that particular piece of information.
lied to Draco, no matter how gruesome the details. However, it was mind-numbingly terrifying to be chained to an ancient monolith, with a menacing lunatic waving a knife right beside him. Only Severus' steady hand, around Draco's wrist, had him breathe, instead of letting the terror overwhelm him.
"A young Auror lay in bed on a beautiful Friday morning," the other continued unencumbered. "Until he was rudely woken by a pounding on his door."
“Thank you,” benevolently, he offered a small bow and turned towards the door. Incidentally, he mentioned before leaving, “By the way, you should add my house to the Malfoys’ permitted residencies. I can’t imagine being eager to travel to the Manor
“We are not allowed on the third landing, mother. Those are Harry’s ‘private’ rooms, and he does not wish for any of us to invade them.”
For the next few minutes, the raven-haired traded places with his colleagues, until he mirrored his partner's position at the other edge of the site. "Be prepared to cast a Patronus," he advised his colleagues as he passed them.
"You're good at identifying spells, aren't you? Ron said that your skills of unravelling magic and understanding spell-compositions are unparalleled."
Stepping up to it, Charles Leewood made a few elaborate gestures, before he stated baffled, "Longbottom is right. Though these are the strongest, oldest concealment charms I have ever encountered. This is the beginning of a passage to Merlin knows where."
Looking down at his shaking fingers, Draco revealed, “They are going to sentence him to the Dementor’s Kiss. The hearing is at nine. They say new evidence came up and,” swallowing thickly around the tears he refused to let drop, he looked at Harry pleading. His voice was back to a whisper as if his rant had drained the last of his energy. “They will kill my father, and I don’t know what to do. Please, Potter, if you can help him, I …” Closing his eyes for a moment, the formerly oh-so-proud pureblood seemed to be at war with himself. Yet after a few heartbeats, he gazed at his former nemesis and took a steeling breath. “I don’t have any money or anything else to offer. Even to sneak out, my mother had to bribe one of the guards with some freshly baked bread, made of the last of our provisions, but if … if you do this for us, if you are willing to try, I’ll offer myself.”
"At one point, we really have to talk about your loyalties!" But it was no use, and they both knew it. Kreacher's loyalties lay with the last blood−related descendants of the Black family. For the time being: Draco and Narcissa Malfoy.
"He cherished you," the former Lord reminded him. "He valued your skill, your opinion. You had the chance to become his right-hand man; to really make a difference. Surely you were smart enough to see that. So why throw it all away?"
Studying the couple, Severus sighed somewhat relieved. "Finally!" He mumbled, then instructed, "Go and fetch your jacket. We're going out for lunch."
“No!” Harry hastened to assure her. Placing the slumbering man on the sofa in the entrance hall. “Don’t worry, Mrs Malfoy, he is just,” looking down at his vassal he shrugged a little helplessly. “I guess he is just exhausted and worn out after everything that happened.” Gesturing towards the wound, he recalled. “Neville and I were just worried because he hurt himself and we were not sure how to clean these wounds. So, I thought, as a mother, you might be familiar with such minor injuries.”
That, more than anything, drove the message home, of how fragile and worn down his godfather had become. A part of the Slytherin wanted to rave and rant about the unfairness of it all. Another part wanted to bury himself in the man's journals once more, despite being aware that knowledge alone was not worth anything if you could not do something with it. The rational part of Draco, however, wrestled back control so he could inquire in an even tone, "What are you doing?"
Pressing his lips together, the recovering patient nodded reluctantly. After accepting more water he rasped, "I tried to help. Guard his sleep. I woke from a nightmare. He told me to leave."
Smiling at the idea of Anu riding through his garden, magically … spiritually reviving dead plants, or striking down dark wizards, the brunet inquired, "Can you walk on water, Harry?"
Clearly not eased by the reassurance, Teddy whispered, "I wanted to give this to you. I made it because the stone was so pretty, and you said you liked those with metal−parts. But he doesn't have a single one, because I just met him and I …"
The snakes retreated and stilled; then the young man looked up. "They say that I am their master." Then it clicked.
Fortunately, Lily's son did not require an explanation. Harry merely squeezed his hand and offered a blinding smile, open and honest, displaying the best traits of both of his parents. "You're welcome."
coffee, he picked up the tray and gestured for his best friends to precede him. Inari bounded up the stairs ahead of them.
Draco did not put his hands on his face in second-hand embarrassment, but it was a near thing. "I can't imagine that going particularly well with Aunt Andromeda."
"Are there any of the little apple-biscuits left of those you made last week, Emerald?" Ron inquired after the first few sips. Though he had wanted to soldier on in search of his wife, Harry, Neville, and Severus had all threatened to petrify him, should he not strengthen himself after participating in an exceedingly draining ritual. He considered sugar the fastest way to achieve that.
Chuckling, Luna took off her sock and presented the sole of her left foot. A circular ring of scar-tissue sat precisely in the middle. "I stepped on one of Lockard's pixies, first year. It grew into a perfect circle. I think it is beautiful."
Since it obviously bothered Kreacher, Harry emptied his cup, cursing himself for not remembering that it was always topped off with
Nodding, Severus held out his hand to Narcissa, accepting the ring before turning back to Harry. "Where is your cloak?"
While the man had looked around, the witch had caressed a baby that lay sleeping in a crib beside them, while smiling down at the three young people before her. Her eyes had become impossibly tender when they had fallen on the mirror-image of her husband. Harry had never imagined hearing his name spoken with such overwhelming love - most memories of his mother were of her screaming and sobbing, begging for his life - as she had spoken softly, "Harry."
That elicited a growl. "Out of that fucking life where he can all but meet everyone's expectations for the sake of his family! He was supposed to be able to finally get what he wants!"
"It's willow and unicorn hair," Ron informed him, putting his wand into Draco's hand. "It is not yours, but for this one spell it will work because we both want it to."
"No! I think I will make him a file on how to be a proper fairy. And when my next tooth comes out, I can give it to him. Maybe, if he gets better, he can give up his other job!"
let you go!" Hugging his best friend's shoulder, the redhead stated, "But if you want to show your appreciation, for me sticking out my neck for you, all the time, I will take these books and have a read-through, before you throw them at your pet potioneers."
"Anyway," Neville cut through the tense atmosphere, glancing at the door. "Do you have further insight for us, Lucius?"
Considerably picked up, Jenkins smiled at her. "No, Sandra, thank you. You were very helpful!" Then he turned towards his waiting colleagues. "Pity, gentlemen, but it seems there is nothing I can do for you today."
Since about three in the morning, Harry had concentrated his efforts on convincing Kinsley to meet the issued demands, despite the Ministry’s hard-lined rule of not giving in to the demands of terrorists. Neville had been invaluable, backing him up, reciting ancient rules of Wizarding Britain that would further their cause. They had found somewhat of a middle ground when the Minister had promised a wide-spread check of all orphanages in the United Kingdom and a revision of the regulations on dealing with magical children.
While Neville started his casting, Harry and Severus watched him avidly. As did Draco, who had come out of the library after hearing his name hollered. So, none of the wizards noticed the person who had watched Grimmauld Place all evening, pulling out a wand, casting a spell on their own.
"Tired," the little boy mumbled. "head hurts," he whispered when his godfather pulled the blanket over him a few minutes later. But all of a sudden, he tried to scramble out of bed again. "My flower!"
Looking at his little brother, who had become his rock somehow, the twin grinned and ruffled the younger's hair, "I know, Ronnikins."
Looking at the other wizard, not even wondering how the seasoned Auror had come to know of his plans, Harry joined him on his rounds for a while. He made small talk and smiled at the right people, before he asked, "Do you think I should stop?"
With a war-cry that called for sugar, the children stormed the kitchen. A heartbeat later an exasperated roar sounded through the house, "Harry!"
Neither of them spoke, and Harry pretended not to notice Draco's clenched hands on the edge of the tub that were slowly turning bone-white from the pressure, nor the tears that started to leak out of his eyes. Once the face was bare again, Harry whispered, "Lean back." Before he washed the product out of the blond's hair, putting a warm towel over Draco's head, he let him towel it himself and then roughly scrub his face. Once he was finished, Draco seemed unable to meet Harry's eyes. So, they merely turned off the lights, bathing the room in darkness. "Come to bed."
"I did not know," the young wizard whispered brokenly. "Remus, … he, … I did not know. He must have thought me so ungrateful."
"Yea?" The young man pushed back his chair. "You know what? It does not matter! I do not have to explain myself to you. I'll apologise to Ron and Hermione tomorrow. And that will be the end of the matter! Goodnight, Sir."
The main room spanned the entire roof, from the front of the house to the back. Though the sides were shelved off, there was more than enough space to move comfortably. Above the main entrance, was a charmed wall that would let in the morning light, illuminating a desk with a rickety chair in front of it. If Draco was not mistaken, the chair matched the set they used in the dining room. At the back, facing the garden, was a brewing station with tabletops of wood on one, and granite on the other side. The outlet of the chimney was directly above it, and the blond could spot faint runes on the shaft that would syphon all harsh vapours and neutralise them before they were introduced to the London airspace.
For a moment, the two elderly witches studied their former pupils, until McGonagall tilted her head, "Mrs Granger, Mr Potter, very well, lead the way."
"You're welcome," Draco rose from where he had been crouched down beside her. "Now excuse me, please. Considering how long Potter seems to take, he might as well be baking our biscuits from scratch. I just want to make sure that he won't burn down the kitchen in his sleep-deprived state."
Tailing after the blond booklover, they reached a round table that was littered with tomes, scrolls and sheets of paper covered in multicoloured notes. The librarian from the Manchester University as well as the one of Westminster Abby gazed at them and traded an exasperated look. "Who has …," Michael Welsh (Westminster Abby) spoke up.
Oblivious to the whisper, Lucius rose once more and began pacing the room. "But I did not know that at the time. Severus is right. I did plan on going behind your back because Hermione convinced me that it was the right thing to do. I want to put these Children of Hecate into Azkaban, so I spared no thought to your wishes. That's detestable. You are my liege and my first loyalty ought to be with you. If you chose not to make your own safety a priority, I have to accept that. No matter how foolish the decision."
Trading a concerned glance with his partner, Harry gave reason for caution, "I think that depends entirely on the topic they have to research."
After an impatient gesture with her fan, a black-haired Lady inquired, "Still, that does not explain your conviction of him attending today, my Lord."
Closing his eyes, unable to keep the pain out of his voice, Draco whispered, "The winter solstice is a time of great power. It marks the return of the sun. We used to host the Yule-ball for all our family and friends. We put up an altar at the side where every guest could light a candle. I was allowed to light the sun-candle ever since I was two years old.
Reaching for the door−handle, Harry took a moment to take a deep breath, reminding himself. "Nobody wants to go in there, but someone has to. Otherwise, nothing will ever change." Resolutely opening the door, the young man entered and fought down the memories Tom Riddle had forced on him. This had been a place of plotting, torture, and death and although a few herbs burned in a fireplace and a new coating of wax on the furniture would not do a lot, it was most definitely a beginning.
Burning with mortification, the young wizard tried to avoid the former Lord's eyes. "Well, as you might have noticed, Teddy is quite excitable, and whenever we apparate, I'm afraid of him letting go." By god, could this get any worse? Trying to come up with a way to explain, Harry was surprised when Lucius stepped up to them and reached out towards his shoulder and waist. In an unexpectedly gentle gesture, the older wizard pulled the two close, "I understand. Draco was the same at that age. Narcissa and I only travelled wrapped tightly around each other. Whenever you are ready."
Maybe, Harry thought, he should introduce the two wizards at one point, since he seriously doubted that Snape would come out of his coma - and even more his role in the war - unscattered. Still, his talks … monologues really … with their residing 'dungeon bat' had always comforted him more than the obligatory sessions with the mind healer. Now, however, Harry was not sure if he was allowed to have them any longer. Maybe Snape would hate him if he came to his senses. Perhaps he would be grateful. Yet if the young wizard was honest with himself, he did not want to enter a conversation his opposite only entertained out of gratitude. Listening to the clock chime, Harry decided that there was nothing he could do about it for now. So, he gently closed the door again and made his way up to the attic.
When he had finally stood before her, eyes lined with black charcoal, skin porcelain smooth and lips the inviting colour of rose-pedals, she had nodded approvingly and Draco was ashamed to admit now, that he had been relieved. Without the thought of resistance, he had put on the clothes she had lain out for him with barely a minute to spare. He had hated himself for trembling ever so slightly, as he had stood before her, presenting himself. Even more so, when she had gestured at her feet, and he had kneeled, without so much as a thought about defiance.
The elf's eyes glazed over for a moment but became impossibly large when they re-focused. "Kreacher does not now," he admitted hoarsely. Then he let out a wail and started banging his head against the table. "Kreacher does not know where Master Draco and Master Lucius are. Bad elf.
Leaving Harry's usual spot on the windowsill, the blond straightened. He had been through worse, he would not cower now. "If it's all the same to you, Auror Potter, I would rather stay here."
At Ron's inviting gesture, Lucius chose a place at the broad oak-table that dominated the kitchen and helped himself to some tea Ron had set down before him. In the meantime, Harry helped to clean up Rose a little bit and started to assemble the cookie recipe as per the girl's instructions, so that his friend could return to his dinner preparations.
" the Auror bellowed, startling his companion. Grinning, he added, "A goblin will never best you without your explicit permission. You always have to be careful when offered a business proposal for your approval."
Chuckling to himself, by now he indeed ought to be used to her, he wanted to know, "Why did you never say anything?"
When the elf reluctantly trudged down the stairs, Narcissa went over her options for a moment, before resolutely opening the door. She vaguely remembered this room. It had been her aunt Walburga's salon, once upon a time. Now it resembled a pig−stall. Every available surface was littered with bottles. The whole room smelled of stale alcohol and magic. A lot of magic! To the pureblood it felt like the very air in the room was charged, making every hair on her body stand up. Once passing the threshold, she realised that the magic was concentrated on the carpet that covered an entire wall. Studying the family−tree, she found her own family, even her son and, of course, the main branch with the Lady Walburga Black, the family matriarch and her children. Except … one child was missing. The charred edges of the fabric, where Sirius' name ought to be, were ugly and repellent. When she touched them, a spark of the stored magic zapped her finger, making her hiss in surprise. Instantly a dark matron emerged in one of the paintings and screeched, "Take your hands away from my family tree, you insolent, little thing!"
Pressing his lips together, so he would not smile at his companion's haste to apologise with a contrite, "Sorry, Narcissa," Draco tilted his head and replied, "Apologies, mother, but Harry works at the Ministry, where you can find an entire department full of Potion Masters. I am not unfamiliar with the subject either. Maybe, I could get a copy about your thoughts on said potion?"
Leaning back into her chair, the medi-witch shook her head. "You know that I specialise in the care and aftercare of coma patients, right?"
"But why?" Charles spoke up, looking from one 'missing person' to the next. "What could be so important to necessitate all this?"
Though Snape looked much more amicable now, the raven-haired still was worried as he followed his favourite Slytherins into the kitchen. Fortunately, Kreacher had already prepared a meal, giving him time to collect his thoughts while quenching his hunger. Once he was finished, he met Severus' eyes. "After the war, I could not enter the Potter vaults to look at memories they had created, to touch what they had valued enough to secure at Gringotts. Sirius had left me enough money anyway, so there was no real need." Gesturing at Draco, he continued. "But with extensive expenses coming up, I thought it unfair to only use the Black vaults to secure my future."
Draco had startled back, when she had pulled out her wand. Yet instead of hurting him, she had cast, "Episkey." Passing him by on her way out, the witch had ruffled his hair, as if he was a dog. Then she had sealed the door.
Shaking his head, the Potion Master emphasised, "My godson is a grown man who is perfectly capable of deciding if he wants food or not. Your cooking skills are not at fault, Kreacher."
"Draco and Lucius are missing," Harry shared tonelessly before Neville brought their fellow Gryffindor up to speed. As soon as their meagre findings had been shared, Ron stepped up to his best friend and hugged him. "We'll find them, mate. After everything we've been through, we won't allow a group of Death Eater Wannabes to harm your Malfoys."
Interpreting the grateful look in his eyes correctly, she brushed a dark strand of hair out of his face and tilted her head. "You are welcome."
"It's not," Harry growled, storming out of the kitchen, right up to Walburga's portrait. "Let go!" He ordered.
Of course, for all of Voldemort's powers, Tom Riddle had been a bully at heart. He had needed to push others to their knees, so he could elevate himself. But that was not how Harry operated, and if this liege−vassal−relationship was supposed to work, Lucius had to see him for who he was, not who he feared Harry to be.
As a result of his years of service to the Dark Lord, the white−haired man did not even startle when setting down the cup. Only the slight trembling of his hands betrayed his distress when he tilted his head and stated, "Forgive me, my Lord."
Once the child was gone, he put his hands on Draco's shoulders. "Look, this is a muggle place. The chances of meeting someone who recognises us are slim to none. Also, Severus needs sap from a Dragon's Tree, and at Diagon Alley they were all out. If you are really not up for it, I can do it myself. But A) are you more skilled when it comes to potion ingredients, and B) …"
Content, Harry let the subject drop. Together, they entered the vault, and the young Lord Potter-Black started to inspect the variety of wands the Black family had collected over the centuries. Touching the worn velvet of the display case, he demanded to know, "Is this the only vault I own where wands are stored?"
Harry and Neville traded a glance and pulled out their wands as soon as the door to Rosier House was opened. It certainly was no Manor, more similar to Grimmauld Place in size and style. But it had a certain feeling to it that Neville and Harry had only come across at Death Eater abodes: dark and menacing.
When the boy hovered, his godfather nudged him along, reminding him, "And I said Kreacher, not Emerald!"
"I'll get Draco." Harry deflated, leaving the room. At least he would get a top-notch outfit out of this. Theodore Nott had overcome all prejudice and risen above all other designers in England. Mostly due to his contacts from school. Slytherins had stuck together after the war. But also, because he had an impeccable sense of style and colour when it came to his clients. Still, rumour had it that he was rude, notoriously hard to get an appointment for and a nightmare to work for. However, when Harry had sneaked into his shop two months ago, to request robes for Lucius' court date, the atmosphere in the shop had been relaxed and comfortable. When he and Nott had started a shouting match in the designer's office, no less than three workers had barged in, to ask if 'Sir' needed anything, glaring daggers at Harry.
Nodding, the young Auror picked up the diagnostic scroll once again. "It says your collarbone is partially fractured. It could heal naturally, the fracture isn't deep. But if you're up for it, I could try to heal it."
"Who would need 22 pairs of cufflinks?" Ron had wondered. "Imagine going on so many balls and meetings to use them all."
"I didn't," the young man shrugged. "I found it in the Black Vault. I thought it better to use something old, as to not draw attention to it. The snakes are somehow a re-occurring theme with the Black Family."
Closing his eyes, unable to keep the pain out of his voice, Draco whispered, "The winter solstice is a time of great power. It marks the return of the sun. We used to host the Yule-ball for all our family and friends. We put up an altar at the side where every guest could light a candle. I was allowed to light the sun-candle ever since I was two years old.
Instantly assuming a defensive position, Alexander pulled his aunt between them and Neville clutched an amulet he carried hidden beneath his robes. Spotting his friend's gesture, Harry smirked and hissed in parseltongue. Immediately a protective shield flared up.
"Severus Tobias Snape, you will listen to me now, or I swear, the moment you enter the afterlife, I will hex you into oblivion!"
Looking up, he reached out with his left hand, Ron seemed determined to keep the other, to caress Ginny's tear-stained face. "It's alright, Ginny. Please, don't cry."
Harry could not tell if his best friend really believed in what he said, or if he merely tried to sooth his wife. But in the end, it did not matter, because their girl would not have it.
Finally, relaxing, because not only were the two most unlikely people in his life agreeing with each other, taking a step back, Harry could even see the wisdom in their advice. Still, he could not help but tease, "It hurt to say that Severus is right, didn't it, dad?"
Coughing surprised, Harry switched back to English. "Inari chews on our furniture? Those woods are polished. That can't be good for her. Draco!"
Gapping, the former Black martriarch demanded to know, "You can not honestly be on his side. His mother was a mudblood and his father the reason my own son turned his back on his family!"
Things became more comfortable after that. It was as if this veil between Harry and his house had been lifted. Grimmauld Place did not become nice and cosy, but it became more of a home than Harry had ever known before. In the first weeks of October, Harry returned to work. He felt tired and worn, both because of the ancient wards of the house slowly adjusting to his magic, boosting themselves on his energies, and his efforts to build up Emerald's and Kreacher's reserves as fast as possible. He and Neville still had not had any significant breakthroughs in their case, but the few meagre leads they were able to collect were enough for Robarts not to make them drop it. After all, there were always other incidents that needed their attention when they had reached a dead-end.
"This leather-bracelet contains an undetectable extension charm. It's not big, just enough for a wand. But if you would allow me a piece of advice: keep it out of sight until absolutely necessary." Only after the Lady's confirming nod, did the young Auror continue. "And lastly, this," opening is hand, he revealed the old snake-ring with the black diamond. "I would very much like for you to wear this."
Once her companions had entered, she took off her robe, revealing jeans and a washed out sweat−shirt underneath. "Alright, where do we start?"
The relief was palpable when the man rose and bowed. "Yes, my liege. Mrs Granger-Weasley, Mr Weasley, thank you for your hospitality."
Offering back the cup, now filled with fresh tea, sugar and a dash of milk, Harry assured him, "I think he had a change of heart. But I guess you'll see for yourself when you read to him after lunch."
Covering his hand, Hermione reminded him. "You don't have to, Harry. But Lucius Malfoy is a grown man and short of wielding your power over him - as would be your right - you can only trust his judgement on his limits and that he will approach you if he reaches them."
The trial of Stephen Sandorn had turned out to be a rather short affair. Lord Thomson, the Head of the Department of Law, had decided that Mrs Hermione Granger-Weasley was biased, hence not allowed to speak for the prosecution. Too much personal investment, he had explained. Hermione and Lucius, however, had both been allowed to help with the gathering of evidence, and the evidence they found was damning.
When two minutes later, Harry's breath had evened out, Draco whispered from his chair beside the chaise. "Thank you, for coming in."
Smiling crookedly, the young man assured her, “I think I will be able to find it, don’t worry. Harry will help you with your husband, and I will bring the leaves momentarily.”
After Neville had left, Harry peeked into the master bedroom, before closing the door soundlessly. These two deserved a little lie in. After the excitement of the day, Harry felt downright exhausted himself. Maybe he should grab a little snack and then catch a nap. Yet, when he entered the kitchen, his hopes for a relaxing afternoon vanished. One loaf of stale bread, a small stick of butter, some wrinkled carrots and half a pinch of salt was the contents of the Malfoy's pantry. Taking a deep breath, Harry shrugged off his Auror robes and in but black jeans and a dark grey button−down, he left the building.
"No?" Harry inquired, working up a rightful anger of being dragged away from an important case, only to be yelled at, in his own home. He had very strict beliefs about how one was to be treated in one's own house. Also, he was really needed at the Ministry. Yet, instead of dashing towards the cantina to gather lunch, he was standing here, forced to deal with his stubborn professor's sensitivities. "Who would you prefer?" He snapped. "Minerva? I suspect that she has neither the time nor the money to properly care for a coma patient. Poppy? While she undoubtedly has the knowledge, I would hardly consider it fair to expect of her to give up her life for you! That leaves whom? Lucius? He was in Azkaban and while Draco and Narcissa would surely have tried their best, the resources they had been given by the ministry were barely enough to keep
I wish all of you a Happy New Year and hope that, for you, your friends and family it will be the best year you've ever had. After going through three surgeries in 2017, 2018 and 2019, I know it will be the best for me because I am finally at the point in my life where I am happy with myself. I hope you can experience the same.
"And?" The raven-haired inquired, leaning against the sink where the dishes were cleaning themselves.
“Because of your one redeeming quality.” Rising, Harry prompted. “Let’s go. We have a lot of work ahead of us.”
"Love," his mother tried to change the subject because they clearly were at an impasse with Peter. "Is it true what the story says? Are you the Master of Death?"
Nodding, the brunet explained, "One way or the other, each and every one of Harry's friends and family possesses an item, similar to this cane."
When they entered the kitchen, Draco had already set the plates and cutlery on the table, leaving it for Emerald to arrange them. He was currently measuring out the tea-leaves, not willing to risk camomile tea for breakfast.
"I am not splotchy! This is my future wife we are expecting. I think a little apprehension is to be expected."
Banishing the ashes from his robes, Harry sank into a chair, closing his eyes. "Nothing. It's alright, Draco. Don't worry."
Following Snape, Harry spotted the hearty meal that had been set out on the back patio that was blanketed with heating charms. When the older wizard instructed, "Eat!" he took a few bites and soon noticed that he was famished, having not had anything but the sandwiches Narcissa had served with tea in the afternoon. Ten minutes later, Harry spooned up the last of the raspberry pudding Ron had prepared, washing the meal down with a butterbeer. He gratefully accepted a glass of amber liquid, before sending the dishes back into the house. Reluctantly, Harry wanted to know, "What time …?" But trailed off when he saw Snape's blazing eyes.
Taking in the room, all witches and wizards present breathed a little easier. "Not perfect," Christopher decided, "but it will do. Now, let's begin."
"Maybe, …" the blond started hesitant, looking from Harry to Charlie to the little fox in his arms. "I mean I know what we do is important. But maybe I could floo over, once or twice a day, to care for Inari. Ron and Hermione and really wrapped up, at the moment. With Christmas and the shop and a new baby on the way, they barely have a moment to breathe. But Granger … I mean Hermione said, that they have enough room for her. Just not the time." Draco looked at the bushy-haired witch pleadingly, when he noticed the confused and downright reluctant look on Harry's face.
Whipping his glasses clean, James mentioned, "By the way, it seems like you have got a Malfoy in your library. Did you know?"
"Not Daphne," Draco mumbled and paled further when the realisation hit him, why Astoria's proposal had sat so ill with him. He had nothing against binding himself to a ministry worker. Just not
get their feet knocked out from under them by being told that they have magic and then get taken away to learn control something that could possibly be lethal when unchecked. They need something familiar!"
Is it as hot with you as it is in Austria? Honestly, 35° C in the shade is hot enough to melt. To be honest, I did not get a lot done this past week, but I have plans to continue this weekend. So to all of you and myself: a productive weekend to follow your passion :).
The stand-off between the two wizards lasted for several minutes until Kingsley deflated and admitted, "I have tea with Augusta Longbottom once a month and try to run into Mrs Granger-Weasley in the break-room every fortnight. By now, she has even stocked up on my favourite tea."
The sun was sinking, painting the vast, green hills a beautiful golden colour. Trading a determined look, Neville and Harry steeled themselves for the upcoming confrontation, though the image before them had their hearts sinking. It seemed that every witch and wizard associated with the Children of Hecate had joined this 'secret' ritual. The space between and around the monoliths of Stonehenge was filled with witches and wizards of all ages and sizes. Such a vast number would increase the strength considerably. Neville and Alexander Pince had convinced Head Auror Robarts to have every available Auror on stand-by, but now when the Cultists hae all gathered together, it was obviously carce: the Aurors were outnumbered five to one, three to one with reinforcements. Still, these were civilians for the most part. So …
Regrettably, before Harry got the chance to discuss his theory with Draco or Emily, he got called into work. Missing persons usually were not his metier. They had a department of Aurors especially educated to deal with those. But somehow, Kingsley had demanded him and Neville to join the investigation. When they entered the meeting room the team had been assigned, they both stopped dead the moment they recognised the latest victim: Madam Irma Pince.
"Shouldn't you be at work, Harry?" The Potion Master raised his eyebrows at the young Auror, ignoring his former friend. "And, Draco, I think a cauldron is waiting for you."
"Thank you, Luna … and Neville. This is perfect." Harry smiled, hugging both of his friends. Scratching his head, he then admitted. "Actually, I too might have something for you."
Luna had that effect on people who had yet to learn to listen to what she meant instead of what she was saying. Charlie seemed confused as well but took a step to come between the two fair-haired opponents. Harry put a calming hand on Draco's arm, who then took a deep breath. Neville, however, was able to understand. Hugging his beloved from behind, he kissed the back of her head, and suggested, "What about strawberries instead of roses? We can get some climbing ones, and they will look gorgeous with their tiny white pedals when they bloom."
Offering an elaborated bow, Harry replied, "Yes, your highness," before dashing out to avoid the stinging hex Draco sent after him in retaliation.
Grinning, Teddy gestured towards the kitchen, where Draco was currently pushing Harry against the table, kissing the life out of him.
"Nobody knows, really. Dumbledore theorised that you sacrificing your life for me created this powerful magical protection. One that shielded me from Tom's dark magic, till the ritual at the graveyard in fourth year."
"None of that," Lily admonished. "We're James and Lily. I was supposed to be your godmother, after all. We're practically family. But to go back to your question, no, we are not Horcruxes. We are more like … impressions of ourselves. Our souls could give this painting a little update to the events of the last twenty-four years. I think our true selves could finally pass on into the next world."
This had gone over smoothly numerous times already, but still, witches and wizards waited with bated breath, until the figure nodded once. Then the Patroni pulled back, and the dark creature hovered over to Dolohov, who put up one hell of a fight. Yet, of course, all in vain. Slowly, as if savouring what was about to come, the Dementor leaned over him. The chill he spread made all Aurors shiver when he leaned over the chained wizard and started to inhale. Dolohov got weaker and weaker, finally sinking to the ground. The hooded figure hovered vertically above him until the last, brilliant shard of the former Death Eater's soul left his body. Once the light had been swallowed, the Dementor nodded towards Robarts once and then floated away.
Turning away with a shrug, the raven-haired auror bound their latest suspects with a flicker of his wand. But one of Neville’s most outstanding qualities was his patience. Had to be when his greatest joy was growing things. So, Harry knew this discussion was far from over.
But Andromeda stood frozen in the doorway, pale and speechless, a mirror−image of her younger sister, who had risen from the couch at her entry, unsure if any fast movement would make her sister vanish.
The couple had not even needed to look at each other. "Yes." "Of course." It carried the Potter-crest, but neither cared.
Studying the lanky form in front of him, Harry noticed the minuscule tremors that ran over Draco's body, betraying how much the other wizard was forcing himself to 'do the right thing'.
"Aren't you afraid that they will tear out each other's throats?" Draco followed Harry to the living-room. "Uncle Severus has a lot of pent up rage over all the stupid things father has done in the Dark Lord's service."
He had only been able to whimper, not even strong enough to pull back from her vile touch. Still, he had nodded, because contradicting her again had been unthinkable in that moment.
Frowning, the pureblood watched her put the watch into the middle of the circle. Somehow this felt wrong. Hermione never took off her watch. "Are you sure this is a good idea? You said that the watch was a present from a beloved friend and that you even wear it at night. You should put it back on. Something could happen."
Sighing, George shrugged, "Let's see if we can boost his courage without high-percentage intervention. But if bad comes to worse, I have a few bottles around."
Once the door had fallen shut, Hermione turned towards Harry and … suggested, "There is no reason for you and your thrall to stay. Maybe you want to take Ron and George to the Leaky Cauldron? We can meet there later on. And tell George that his tabs are on me tonight."
Turning towards him, Robarts studied the young man with interest. "Tell me, Potter: who briefed you on what to say? Because after working with you for four years, I find it hard to believe that you would come up with such diplomatic responses and carefully concealed threats on your own."
When his partner did not reply, the current Lord Longbottom shook his head. "When you think about marriage, you've always had this idea of romantic love in your head, Harry. But that's not what our lives are about. Your love for all of us, your chosen family and friends enabled you to walk into that forest camp without any lingering doubts in your heart. Dumbledore called it your greatest strength, didn't he? 'The Power the Dark Lord knows not!' It makes you the strongest wizard I know."
As soon as Emerald was gone, Draco scrambled for the hiding-place, getting out the cufflinks, fastening them on his sleeves.
Rising on his elbows from where he had relaxed on the carpet - he loved that carpet, red and gold and black suited the room so much better than the dull grey colour scheme it had had before - Harry tousled his unruly strands. "You know, that might even work. I guess it all depends on how I voice my questions."
"Yet, it came into my possession and is now back in yours. These things happen for a reason. But as I said before, it is up to you what you make of it. You can as easily slip it into your pocket, as throw it into the lake. The choice, fortunately, is all yours."
Tilting his head, Harry replied, "It should be. But the wards just informed me that a young woman fell out of my floo and she is 'wetting' my carpet."
Lucius had managed to catch a duck and a dove and was smiling smugly when his liege touched down on the ground beside him. Harry had not managed to capture even one of the conjured animals and was currently wrestling with the reason for that. Right at the start of the hunt, their transfigured prey had flushed a mangled and half-starved snow fox, from his hiding place; a rotten tree at the edge of the forest. The beast had been half mad with fear and hunger, darting over snow-covered fields in a desperate attempt to find new shelter. Only when the animal had been at the end of its strength, had Harry been able to pick it up without getting bitten. However, as soon as the kit had realised that the human had no intentions of harming it, it had tried to burrow into the young wizard's cloak to find protection from the wind. Though Harry had accommodated the animal, it had been a constant struggle to keep it from falling off the soaring broom, as the fox kept crawling around inside his jacket.
The faint smile that grazed his lips when thinking about Ron and George’s antics melted away, when he arrived at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. He looked up the façade as the house pushed itself into view, briefly squeezing his eyes shut when the sunlight reflected on a window on the top floor. With a sigh, he opened the door.
When Ron's breath had caught, Hermione had reached out, rubbing his arm comfortingly. "You're talking about Gideon and Fabian, right?"
"He wasn't …?" The liege started but interrupted himself when he realised that they could easily be overheard and that it would not put him into a good light if he so much as hinted that he did not know where his vassal was. "Sure," he shrugged with forced nonchalance. "Today, he just had to help Narcissa. You know, the experiment these librarians had been running with all the creatures. It is a huge mess. All hands on deck and so on …"
After a moment of consideration, Harry shrugged, "For a man like him, it has to be unbearable to owe his life and well-being to the son of his worst enemy."
The dejected young man was nearly at the door when his godfather's voice held him back. "Your Aunt Bella's old potion texts are still in the library … of the Manor?"
And, all of a sudden, everything fell into place. "Thank you for dinner," Draco directed towards the house elf, before slowly pushing back his chair to make his way up to the third floor.
Remembering her position, Daphne raised her chin, "And pray tell me, Lady Malfoy, who have you invited into your home?"
"I know," the last but not really Black−heir sighed. "But it doesn't matter now." Looking at his friend, Harry put a strong hand on his shoulder. "Thank you, Neville, for doing this for them."
When the Minister, obviously the tallest and strongest of the group, offered to carry the young Mr Potter, Ron had merely growled at him. "I've got him!"
****************************************************************************************************
"Yes, Sir," Harry offered a weak smile, squeezing his best friend's hand to assure him that he was alright.
After a brief debate, the two Aurors decided to try the muggle way. While maintaining their shields against the debris, they tried to dig their way out. After half an hour, where seemingly impossible, Harry's headache seemed to be getting worse, they had blood on their hands, were significantly weaker from permanently maintaining their shield and had cleared about a foot of stone.
After nodding, Harry hurried down the stairs. Chances were good that Draco was right. But in his short life, Harry had learned to better be cautious. All of his cautions fled from his mind, when he entered his living room, realising that 'wetting' did not refer to tears, but the blood Astoria was spilling. The silky grey night-gown she was wearing was spotted with blood around her lower body-region. When he fell to his knees beside her, the young woman curled tighter into herself, whimpering quietly. Unsure if he was allowed to touch, Harry, whispered, "It's alright, Astoria. You are safe now. You are at Grimmauld Place. Rosier can't get to you as long as you are here."
Closing his eyes against the overwhelming pain, the raven-haired shook his head. "No, and even if I were, Draco could never be … he wants Astoria. She can give him everything he desires."
At Neville's encouraging nod, Luna opened the present, and her eyes began to shine. On dark blue velvet lay a necklace of white silver, adorned with countless, little stars that dangled from the chain-links. It would be far too excessive for the likes of Andromeda, Narcissa or Molly. For Luna, however, the shimmering jewellery was perfect and would suit her festive attires perfectly.
Hogwarts … so the school was still in session. A weight he had not known he had carried, was now lifted from his shoulders. No matter the outcome. The castle was still standing, and Poppy was still in charge of the infirmary. In a way, it felt enough. Exhaustion washed over him, and though he wished differently, his hand slipped from Emilia's fingers. He tried to force himself to stay awake, but the witch's comforting words soothed him, when she promised, "You can go to sleep now. We will be here in the morning."
Straightening, the old Lady opened a door and stepped into a surprisingly moderate wardrobe. "Yes, I do. I lost Alice, but I will do everything in my power not to lose you."
Emilia Nightingale! A brilliant Potion student six years his senior. She had attended her seventh year as a Hufflepuff the year he had been sorted into Slytherin. She had spent nearly as much time in the library as him, but not for lack of friends, but the desire to exceed all expectations in her Herbology and Potion's NEWTs. She had indeed set a record, one that had been broken only by him for Potions … maybe by Longbottom in Herbology, if the boy had survived the final battle. He was pulled out of his musings, by the vaguely familiar tone.
"Well … first, there was Albus Dumbledore's will. While he was not overly wealthy, and most of his money went to Aberforth, several thousand gallons were given to you. I take it you haven't come here, after … after the Astronomy Tower?" Harry more felt than saw his former professor shaking his head. The man was not ready for this conversation yet, so he continued, "Then there was Lucius. They did not have much time after the final battle before the Aurors caught up to them and all Malfoy assets were frozen. However, he managed to make a substantial deposit to your, respectively Draco's account. Just shy of ten-thousand gallons, since he knew such 'minor' investments would not be scrutinised too closely. The Malfoys are worth millions after all. And finally, …"
Ginny and George followed instantly, as did Hermione after taking a steeling breath. Her hand clutching Ron's in a vice−grip was the only indicator of her distress. Luna hovered at the door for a moment, looking towards the roof. "The gargoyles have done a poor job as of late. I will see if we can wake them up." She then glanced at Neville and when he gave her an encouraging nod, entered the house.
With a small smile, his partner tilted his head, "And we intend to find our missing librarians, safe and unharmed."
Steamrolled, Draco could only nod, a glimmer of hope reflecting in his eyes, turning them from a dull grey to shining silver for a heartbeat. “Yes, my … yes, Harry.”
Slowly rolling on the floor, the raven-haired gently woke his godson, who seemed to have an enjoyable dream, since his hair changed through all the colours of the rainbow. "I could, you know. I'm very well off."
In the end, Draco, was better off without him, since every single decision he had made for their family had ended in disaster. Therefore, it did not alarm the former Lord, that his liege led him back to the Auror Department. There was no safer place to lock him up before they got the chance to send him back to prison. He was, however, surprised when Potter entered the Head Auror’s office with the words, “Accio pencil-cup.”
"Draco is getting better; fewer nightmares and less frantic with brewing. His mind seems to slowly catch up to the fact that I won't kick him out and he won't have to return to the Manor. Even if he does not make himself useful every hour of every day. Narcissa is back to managing my social life, and I have to admit that I dread the Spring Equinox. Apparently, it is 'a time to renew old relationships and nurture new ones'."
The Auror walked around Lucius three times before he turned towards the other occupants of the room. "May I see your wand Mrs Granger-Weasley?"
"Hermione, … she … that night in the boat shack, she cast a stasis charm on you. Poppy said that saved your life. I … we did not know how to help you. So, the three of us, with the help of Professor … Headmistress McGonagall put you in a magically induced coma and started searching for an antidote to Nagini's poison."
"Narcissa," Lucius breathed out, capturing her hand after she had finished bandaging his wrist and pulled it to his mouth with shaking fingers. He squeezed his eyes shut while kissing her palm reverently. "Your fingers are cold as ice," Lucius whispered, pulling her into the bed before wrapping himself around her. With a little difficulty, he dragged up the duvet to cover their entirely clad forms.
Ron, however, merely laughed and nudged him with his shoulder, before rising to return to the house. "Don't worry, when it comes to the important things, you are still as oblivious as ever."
"You can't treat this like any other case!" Ron bellowed, jumping to his feet. "This is my wife you are talking about!"
Shrugging, Neville replied, "Well, I stood with my back to him, and if you didn't see him casting, and I didn't either, I see no reason to mention him at all."
"I would care for some ventilation, Kreacher. We could make it work." Harry assured him, but the house-elf shook his head decisively, taking Draco's and Harry's hand, guiding them down the corridor. Before the blond got the chance to ask what this was all about, the elf looked them in the eyes and revealed in a firm tone, "Master Regulus' lab is in the attic of No. 12 Grimmauld Place."
Calmly, Draco turned towards his father. "Of course, I did. Who else would I built it for?" After a moment, where nobody said a word, the young wizard held out his hand. "Leash and collar, if you please. I assume you followed your liege's instructions to the letter."
Yet Harry had not been able to reply, fighting down tears, so as to not embarrass himself in front of his parents. For years, more than two decades, in fact, he had longed for someone to act just like that. Someone who got angry on his behalf, when Harry was wronged, but …
"But that's exactly the point," Draco now spoke up. "Being a 'pureblood' isn't feasible any longer. With two wars, the need for inbreeding would be too high, and despite producing powerful offspring, such gifts often come at a price."
Massaging the bridge of his nose, Alexander Pince shook his head. "Sometimes, your ignorance of our ways is actually painful to experience, Potter. No matter what Dumbledore's funeral suggested, witches and wizards are rarely buried with their wands."
'Wanna bet?' the young man thought to himself, before turning them over in his palm, revealing the slightly faded etching, "Would you like to wear them?"
Words had been carefully chosen between the two Slytherins. A warning offered, instead of encouragement. The message had been well received, or so it seemed. Draco felt beyond relieved.
Pointedly looking at the other witches and wizards in attendance, many of whom obviously had slept in their day clothes, Narcissa stepped up to Harry, scrutinised him top to bottom and back again, before demanding, "A diagnostic, please."
Giving in, Harry followed him up the stairs, allowed to be prodded to undress and bullied into a shower. Rubbing his hair dry, as he left the bathroom, he took in the well-worn pants and shirt Draco had dug out of his wardrobe. He fidgeted with the seam of his shirt after pulling it over his head, talking more to the fabric when he admitted, "There is nothing to solve." Droopy, he crawled into bed, leaving plenty of room, should Draco intend to join him. "As of today, 3 p.m. Lord Rosier's death is officially labelled as caused by heart failure. Even though there was never any indication of him having a weak heart in the first place, as no use of magic by wand, elf or creature was detected."
Nodding, he confirmed, "For the next seven days at least. You know where Lord Malfoy has been. We will need a meal he can stomach. Narcissa and Draco are little better off."
"And you are one of Molly's, aren't you?" Lily had mused, looking Ron up and down. James had added with a grin, "You look just like the twins."
"Don't you want another pet around?" Neville gazed at his friend, before studying the map over his shoulder.
Harry's noise of protest came out as a weak whimper, that finally drew the attention of the other people in the room. A pale, blond head entered his field of vision and a heartbeat later, he had his arms full of a trembling and sniffing Hermione. "Oh, Harry, thank god you're awake."
Closing the door of his room behind himself, Draco burrowed under the covers, even turning on the wireless. Anything to block out the noises that came from the third floor.
"I could, but they don't need me to. They told me that everything is up to standard. Especially after Hermione brushed them up when we stayed here a few years ago."
"Yes," the young man bowed respectfully. Then he pulled open the doors of the library with a gentle smile. "Welcome home, Madam Pince."
Having already spotted the papers, the pureblood claimed the seat and started to gather an overview.
So, he had come here to discuss living arrangements with Astoria. Hoping that - one way or the other - he would be able to talk about Draco and the life the young witch had planned for them. The mere idea of Draco leaving Grimmauld Place caused an unpleasant ache in Harry's chest. But imagining the blond with the soon to be 'Lady Malfoy' made his heartache. No matter how this would go, Harry felt trapped between a rock and a hard place. All he could do now was believing in Neville's advice, hoping that he and Astoria could come to an arrangement that would not tear him apart day after day of seeing her and Draco together. He was not sure what it meant when the Lady merely studied him, an unreadable expression on her face. The young Auror would have worried about a mental attack, but had faith in his own Occlumency shields, to at least recognise one, if Astoria turned out to be so daring.
Gazing at the pureblood who had yet to meet his eyes, Harry forced a smile and nodded towards the Lady Malfoy. "Of course, Narcissa. Have a good day."
Pondering the statement, little Rose Granger-Weasley stated after a minute, "They get more expensive!"
Looking inquisitive at the little house-elf, who sat beside his plate, levitating some cutlery in-between topping off their mugs, the little elven-girl shook her head. "Master-Draco-Sir had the shimmering flower drink, though, Sir-Harry-Master."
Swallowing around a constricting throat, Harry could easily recall how he had felt about Ron's little sister in the beginning. "She …," stammering, he needed a moment to quietly admit. "She was everything. I thought about her constantly. Sometimes the memory of our kiss, the future we had planned, were the only things that kept me going."
"Hedwig was my pet. More than that, she was my first friend. She was there for me when I had no one. Hedwig stayed with me when it would have been so much easier for her to give in to her instincts and flee. She never had an influence on my magic, but I would have rather starved than see her hungry."
Now that his worst hunger was curbed, the Auror went into more detail. "The librarians have some kind of 'group research' going on and think that your mother can help them. But since working at the … where they were before, would be too much of a hassle - Narcissa would need a Ministry entourage every time she went there - they relocated to the Manor."
And though Harry very much wanted to protest, to walk on his own, his spinning head told him that that would not be the best of ideas.
I apologise for being delayed one day, but I was out of town with friends. I hope you will nevertheless enjoy this chapter, even when delayed :).
His best friend, however, put a steadying hand on his shoulder. "Yes, he can. He has to, Ron, because sooner or later, the press will catch on. No matter what we do. When that time comes, Kingsley has to make them believe that he did everything humanly possible to get Hermione, Draco and Lucius back."
Chuckling, Ron and Hermione helped him to gather the ancient potion journals. It seemed that one of Harry's ancestors had been a dedicated brewer. In the second to last vault, they found half a dozen books on old pure-blood customs. Hermione claimed them immediately, citing that most modern laws were based on these customs. A volume on healing spells was pocketed for Narcissa As Voldemorts volatile moods had extended to parts of the Malfoy library as well on one memorable occasion. Afterwards, Lucius and Narcissa had sneaked away the most valuable volumes, like the Malfoy Family Chronicle. Lastly, Ron, Hermione and Harry rode up to the last vault on their list.
All in all, Sandorn got away with a slap on the wrist. The former lawyer was coming out of this as a hero for fighting the dark and from his smirk after hearing the verdict, well aware of it. Additionally, the Lady Talbot and Hermione shared later on, that the real chance of Sandorn ever paying a single sickle were slim to none. While some of his victims might not have deserved their harsh sentences, them being entirely innocent was unlikely. After all, the Wizengamot had learned from the so-called 'Sirius Black'-incident.
Looking at the young man by her side, Irma Pince chuckled, "I can imagine Severus being interested in Christopher. Even though he had never shown interest in the same sex. He was always drawn to intelligence above all else. And Chris is as smart as they come. However, he's also incredibly arrogant, convinced of his own superiority in his field of expertise and self-confident he borders on being rude."
The next week, Grimmauld Place remained mostly empty. Draco and Severus spent the majority of their time at the Manor where - Harry had learned - the Potion Master divided his time between brewing in an all too familiar lab and screaming at Chris Drake since the two of them seemed unable to agree on
Worried, Harry started to chew on his bottom−lip but found he had trouble keeping his eyes open. Maybe he could take a little nap and then decide what to do with his house−elf.
Breathing easier, Lucius dropped his gaze. After countless minutes, Harry lowered his wand and stepped back. The pureblood, however, waited for a gesture before he rose from the floor.
Shaking his head, Neville pulled his partner into a fierce hug. "You never do anything the easy way. Fine, I'll hold the office while you sort out this mess. But remember, Harry, you still have a job. Eventually, you will have to find an occupation for Mr Malfoy where he is not in danger of being strangled on sight."
The raven-haired needed a few moments to collect himself before he copied the memory of this interrogation and sealed it away. Then he offered a small bow, and though it was directed at Draco, everybody knew that he was not the intended recipient. "Thank you," Harry repeated, "Your help is very much appreciated."
"Well, we did have a successful break-in a few years back, where the thieves escaped with a priceless artefact."
Waiting for a heartbeat, Lucius beseeched when his liege seemed to wait for his reply, "I am at your service. Whatever you want. Whatever you need. I will do everything in my power to support you!"
Slowly gathering where the intangible animosity in the house was coming from, Narcissa elegantly sank in the chair Harry seemed to favour. The one that stood at the centre of the chaos. "I certainly do. He saved my husband Lucius from the Dementor's Kiss and Draco and me from starvation."
Harry could do very little to influence his own mood when on a case. Being an Auror meant suffering the entire range of emotions from anger, to exhilaration, to despair. However, maybe he could alter Lucius' expectations somewhat. Teach him how to deal with his liege’s bouts of overflowing feelings that were entirely unrelated to him.
"I mean I need Professor Snape's blood," Harry corrected himself, blushing ever so slightly, already used to the sharp tongue of their medi-witch and her particular brand of humour.
Why had Draco not tried to explain who the leash and the collar were really for? Why had he chosen Harry's side over his father's?
Pulling an embroidered card that was decorated with the Gryffindor lion from Harry's mailbox, the pureblood gazed at her host.
"May your heart embrace the return of the light." To everybody's surprise, Ron had completed the last sentence of the prayer together with Draco. The redhead held the blond's gaze when they finished in one voice.
"I have no clue whatsoever, which invitations to accept and which are safe to decline!" Harry groaned, throwing a bunch of letters on his desk. In the last few weeks, his office at Grimmauld Place had been redecorated. Where once a single desk had taken up the majority of the place, another, smaller one, had been added at the side. Most days Narcissa sat there for a few hours managing Harry's social calendar.
"They are pretty, and it's supposed to be a present," Luna explained, sliding into her fiancé's arms when Neville let go of his partner. "Even if the intended recipient will most likely just chew on them."
Warning bells deafened them, as Severus fought weakly against the restraining hands of Harry and Draco, who tried to keep him from hurting himself.
Closing her eyes for a moment, the pureblood recalled, "Andromeda was married, so she can't inherit the Blacks' heirlooms. Your godson Edward, … well, he might, depending if you have children on your own or not." Clearing her throat, she allowed Harry to help her to her feet. "Anyway, Kreacher should be more respectful. His behaviour would reflect badly on you in certain company."
The former Lord had no time to react when the door was opened. His wand snapped into Harry’s hand faster than either of them could blink. Slowly and very controlled, the young man entered the room and commanded quietly, “Get up, and step away from my desk.”
