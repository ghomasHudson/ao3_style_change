“Yeah it will be fine, Katie said you can go in. Where did Draco go?” He points down the hall and goes into the office.
“Now then.” He licks his bottom lip slowly. “You’re biting that lip, Draco. You know the effect it has on me.” He places his long index finger over my mouth, a warning.
“Do you play?” He asks instead.
Nia ambushes me once more and squeals quietly.
“Have you ever been beaten?” I ask.
“I’d like to say cheers to Harry.” Nia stands up then and holds up her drink. “For deciding that his fate is to teach people like me, from home. And for finally quitting the aurors indefinitely. No offence Ron.” She whispers that end bit and everyone raises their glasses and claps for me.
“I mean, not right now because it's a mess.” He chuckles and carries on, “ But eventually yes, of course. And I’m even a bit excited to restore it ourselves.”
“Blaise, what are you doing?” I’m way too drunk to get the strength to push him away.
“Oh is that so?” I crawl up to him and he lays on his back.
“Which pub?” He sounds irritated.
“Is there anything you’d like to add?” He asks kindly.
He smiles.
“He’s so big now. He won't stop growing.” He sobs and reaches for Leo. He hugs him tight and surrounds him with kisses.
“Yeah, but don’t be ages. I want my baby back at some point.” We all chuckle at that and I make my way downstairs with Leo.
“Well I would be if someone hadn’t decided to hide my shoe!” Ron says back. “Bloody pregnancy brain!” He mumbles but Hermione clearly heard and turns devil eyes on him.
She hugs me and then gets up and hugs Draco. “Thank you so so so much guys. If you ever need a babysitter, I will be more than happy to help.” She chuckles while wiping her face.
When I finally come to a stop I open my eyes and find frantic green ones staring back at me. Harry Potter is on top of me, with his chest against mine, while we are both breathing heavily. I distinctly notice he smells of laundered lining and expensive body wash. It is intoxicating and I breathe in deeply.
“Oh no, you don’t.” Harry threatens. “You can wear something of mine.” He’s slipped on a white t-shirt and runs his hand through his just-fucked hair. In spite of my anxiety, I lose my train of thought. His beauty is derailing.
“Please.”
“Blaise? And Harry Potter? Draco! What was the stupid fool thinking?” She shakes her head in disgust and returns to packing.
“I want to bite this lip.” he murmurs against my mouth, and carefully he tugs at it with his teeth. I moan, and he smiles.
“He made a pass at me on Friday.”
“Okay, but then I really need to study.” I can’t hide the irritation still in my voice, but go into the living room and wait for supper.
We had both silently decided not to do anymore to the house today. We weren’t in the mood anymore. Everything Nia had told us was awful, of the things she had gone through being so young. And everything we had had to relive to tell her about the war just seeped the happiness out of the house. I looked at my watch and it was 4:20pm, then I looked over to Draco.
“He’s got you calling it that too?” I take his hand and he smirks at me.
“So, who shall we tell first?” I smirk at him.
“Draco, you’ve met my mother, Lily. This is my father, James.”
“Yes! Now!” I frown in confusion at her. “For pain. It isn’t as effective as the muggle stuff but it is less harmful to the baby.” Of course she is giving me a lecture right now.
I frown.
15.21    The Submissive shall accept whipping, floggings, spankings, canings, paddlings, or any other discipline the Dominant shall decide to administer, without hesitation, inquiry, or complaint.
“No! I-I don’t wanna feel.” I shove the water away.
I look at the house as we pass and it looks comfortable and homey. I can imagine Harry as a child running around the garden with Theo, and Lily calling them in for tea. It’s sweet.
“But male pregnancies aren’t common and as soon as he saw my stomach, it’s like I could hear his thoughts.”
“I’m not speaking to a head shrink!” I shout and cover my head with the quilt. Then I start crying again. “Please Hermione, I can’t. Don’t make me.” I feel her lie next to me then and hug me from behind.
“Yes.”
“I also had cramping in my stomach.” Draco says quietly next to me. I look over to him and he clearly knows he should have told me that because he looks guilty.
“Eat, Draco.” My appetite has become uncertain again….more…..more sex…..yes, please.
On Friday I mention to Draco that I didn’t get to go to my parents grave on Halloween.
Draco
“Harry look,” he shouts while walking back towards the room, I don’t hear him though. “I’m really sorry tha…..” he stops short when he sees me and his eyes go wide. “Shit! Harry!” He falls to my side and lifts my head with his hands on either side of my tear stained face. “Harry? Talk to me, are you okay?”
“Draco it’s okay, I’m fine. I know I don’t have to be here.” I chuckle a bit at that and look into his eyes. “But i needed to tell you that…that I love you too.” I take a deep breath and relax a bit then. He just stares at me with wide eyes and an open mouth but doesn’t say anything. Is this how he felt on the field? Because this is awful. “I mean, I love you, you don’t have to love me. If you didn’t mean it that is. If-“ Draco rushes over and kisses me so lovingly I nearly melt.
He mumbles something then but it’s too incoherent to understand.
“The healer said the baby is right at the back so i wont start showing for another few of weeks and she said my bump will be quite small until the end.”
“Hey Harry, hey Draco. Do you want the usual?”
Enjoy x
“Hi,” I say softly, and my sphinx-like smile meets his.
“I want to lavish money on you. Let me buy you some clothes. I may need you to accompany me to functions, and I want you dressed well. I’m sure your salary, when you do get a job, won’t cover the kind of clothes I’d like you to wear.”
“Please.” He mouths to me. I wipe his tears and help him up. As we are going over another contraction starts. “Ahhh. Harryyy.”
“It’s about gaining your trust and your respect, so you’ll let me exert my will over you. I will gain a great deal of pleasure, joy even, in your submission. The more you submit, the greater my joy - it’s a simple equation.”
“Hey Andy, you okay?” I ask her as she gets to me.
“Because I’m a benefactor of Hogwarts, I went there myself. And for all intents and purposes, I couldn’t get Miss Parkinson off my back. She badgered and badgered my people, and I admire that kind of tenacity.”
“Aww you guys are cute. Anyway, what can I get you?” We told her our orders and she walked off to go make them.
Before we can even knock on the door Teddy pulls it open and runs at us. He must remember the baby then because he stops just short of Draco and holds him hands out for a hug. Draco chuckles and bends down to squeeze him.
Hope you are all enjoying it so far. Thank you for all the kudos and comments. Sorry it's late, I've been very busy this week. Thanks again! x
May 24 18:40
“For long periods of time?”
I start panicking if I even think about leaving the house. Hermione and Ron come over sometimes, but most the time I pretend I’m sleeping or not home. I know these are signs I need help, but I just can’t talk about it yet. I need more time. But Teddy needs me, Andromeda needs me. So some days I manage to get out. Like today.
"Mother always told me to have a glass of water after bad dreams," said Draco sweetly. He fought down the urge to maniacally hoot at the evil glower Potter was sending him. The effect was somewhat lost when the person looked like a half-drowned cat.
Taking the executive decision of letting the situation play itself out, and not call in reinforcements, Harry continued walking along the narrow, claustrophobic streets. He was an Auror, damnit, and far too old to be afraid of the dark. A few minutes later the figure appeared again, this time a little bit to his left. Through the corner of his eye, Harry could just make out the dark cloak that seemed to absorb what little light the streetlamps provided. He tried to face the threat, turning once more and was again greeted by empty space.
“What’s this?” he asked when no explanation seemed forthcoming. A little bird came out of the clock and made an obnoxiously loud chirp.
Harry huffed, disgruntled, and cast some diagnostic spells. There wasn’t even a trace of dark magic around them. After
Ronald tilted his head to the side, and Draco went silent.
It started small. Quick glimpses of something black and shapeless, that nonetheless left Draco anxious. He would see it while walking the dog across the park. Sometimes, shopping on Diagon Alley, a shiver would make him pause and look around.
Last came a good-natured fellow who introduced himself as Charlie Weasley – to which Draco wondered if he was bound to meet the whole family in one go – and dropped a shrunken package full of construction material on the floor.
Draco was not impressed.
They were back to sharing a bed.
. They found their rhythm. And then they were both gasping, biting and kissing. Harry was moaning, rutting into Draco’s hand, and Draco himself had just a second to worry over his vision going completely white. It was over in an embarrassingly short time.
“Well, what do you call a thing with black fur that will not stay untangled no matter what you do,”
Thank you for the kudos and the reviews! I'm having a lot of fun writing this fic, and I'm glad you had fun reading it too! =D
"Be that as it may, Malfoy. You still can't burn down the house. Or destroy it."
Or should it be Draco, now? After all, since I achieved one out of two of my goals last night (your words, not mine) I’m feeling rather… generous. Especially after you wore those not-jeans-but-leather pants again.
the magic in the middle of a duel, Potter!”
" sneered Draco, turning to his side. "See how you like it now. Back to my back, Potter."
"Why the fuck are you so concerned about the fair treatment of a Death Eater?" Draco finally managed to choke out. "I tortured innocent people, you do know that, right?"
“Well, it was supposed to spill lava, so count your goddamned blessings, Potter! Potter,
“Ten.”
“No. I named him Potter after a disastrous afternoon where he chewed on Pansy’s designer shoes, successfully dodged all of her hexes, jumped out the window from the second floor of the Manor, fell on my mother’s rose bushes and was then chased by peacocks.”
They popped on the other side smoothly, with no apparent splinching issues.
“Yes, well.” Draco exhaled tiredly, trying to think. What a fucking night. “If that thing was a person, then the white flash makes no sense. But he shouldn’t be dead. Maybe… Banished? If it was some other creature…” Draco shrugged. “Who knows.”
"This is from your vault, until Gringotts can make things straight officially," he said, extending a bag filled with galleons to Draco.
“The least you could do is help me with these things. You’re a Potter too, you know.” dog-Potter’s only answer was a consoling bump to Harry’s leg.
when he noticed the grin Draco was trying to hide.
“You…” scoffed Harry, shaking his head. None of them was moving away. “Malfoy, you are such…”
“Excellent,” Draco said and turned to the pile on the floor. He arched an eyebrow. “I see your organization skills didn’t improve much with age.”
“I need to shower,” Harry said brusquely to no one in particular when the kitchen door was once again closed, and stomped to his room.
“You woke up showing signs of blood loss. And you said you were dreaming of bleeding in the Forbidden Forest earlier.”
“Right.” Harry swayed between his toes and his heels, hands deep in his pockets. “Is she your-”
“And it seems he fancies you too.”
"See you later, darling." Pansy, the vicious harpy, waved with her fingers. Draco could hear her giggling even as she Apparated with a loud
“There is…” Hermione started, in a suspiciously uncertain voice.
? He took in the gloomy expression, the defensive set of his shoulders.
“My parents?” she repeated, appearing surprised. “This is serious, then.” Draco raised one shoulder in a helpless gesture.
“I did not break any of your rules, Potter. Your elf wants to do his job, that’s all.” Harry took off his glasses and pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes.
“What-” Harry gasped, horrified. “Malfoy,
to himself. A sentiment Harry more than agreed with.
"I will expect irreproachable behavior from you at Hogwarts, gentleman. None of your previous shenanigans will be tolerated."
!” Harry cried out.
Harry started walking down the path that would ultimately lead him to the place he’d died. He reached the clearing, the mist slowly dissolving all around him. To his surprise, there was someone waiting for him there. At first, he thought it was Sirius Animagus’ form, and smiled, even with his heart aching, thinking that it would be good to at least see his godfather for a bit.
“Why would you tell
Thanks for reading!
direct you to the Wizarding area of the club.
?” shouted Draco, outraged.
He trailed off, taking in for the first time Draco’s white sweater hanging wetly from his skinny frame. Looking up, he found angry grey eyes flashing dangerously.
A rushing sound of nails scratching wood floors was heard, and suddenly a huge dog was jumping on Malfoy, yapping cheerfully and slobbering over everything.
!” Not even a stumble. “I’ll
He abruptly froze midway through his sleepy wiggling around routine. Took alarmed inventory of the arm thrown possessively over him, the warm breath pleasantly tickling the hairs on the back of his neck. And was that a stiffy poking him around the...
Potter, we’re having
“Oh.” Harry turned and stuck his head out of his office, suggesting emphatically to the other young Auror that he should go for a coffee break. He closed the door, warded it, and asked in a concerned tone:
“Bloody-,” was all he managed before slipping and ending up flat on his back on the wet floor. Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, unsure if he should go help or give himself up to hysterical sniggers.
Now. I may have pictures. I won’t apologize, it’s just my nature.
gnome stuck next to Draco’s peonies.
"Oh, hey Ron. That's all the food then?"
“What does it do?”
“Zabini!” Draco bellowed in outrage when he could finally breathe again. Blaise’s amused smile wasn’t helping him find his lost poise. “Have you no decorum?! One afternoon with Gryffindors and you turn into a heathen?!”
“- We went outside,” continued Draco, “and he came straight to your door. Then…the house went crazy too. Lights going on and off. The walls were shaking. I came into your room, and Kreacher was here.”
and lied down next to him.
"What are you on about, Malfoy?" Asked Potter, yawning.
And to Draco's consternation, he started walking away.
Chapter three.
“Are you telling me that you, Draco Malfoy,
“Erm… I usually just get take-out.” Harry admitted, scratching the back of his neck. Draco scoffed at him.
“Oh,” said Harry, a bit stupidly.
They both grimaced.
"Draco, can't we just try to fix it?"
“What is going on between you and Potter?”
“I saw you!” Harry persisted, grabbing Draco’s arm, and shaking him. “Walking after me like a bloody lunatic wearing that stupid cape and…”
“You…” Harry pointed at Draco with a shaking finger, and then at the dog looking at him with his tongue lolling out. “You named your
“Has it ever occurred to you that having time off is more distressing to him than running the house?” Harry opened his mouth to protest and Draco cut him off:
“Oh?”
“Merlin,” Harry said in between puffs of breath. Draco agreed with the sentiment, but his mouth refused to form coherent words for the moment. Bloody hell. He had just gotten off with the boy that had consistently vexed him since he was
Draco sighed in displeasure.
, to Harry’s complete perplexity. “I’ll explain later, I promise. You should go to your parents’ house.”
"Malfoy, come on,” he could hear the mirth in the voice of Prat Who Lived and threw one scathing look in his direction as he walked down a half-blocked hallway. "Where are you going?"
It was fine. He didn't complain. It could have been worse. He hadn't even pointed out to those Ministry simpletons that it was far from coherent to put someone in therapy for all the Dark Lord trauma, while still requiring said patient to live in the fucking headquarters of Moldy Voldy. No, no. Draco Malfoy was working on his temper. Until this morning when half of the Manor's roof had caved in.
"I still want to help," grumbled Potter stubbornly.
“Court me?” his voice had a mild pitch of hysteria to it.
“Oh, Harry!” Draco peered at him from his place and actually grinned. “Did you know this chandelier is cursed to spit candles on people passing by?”
“Oh.” He stammered, uncertain.
house? Why the devil would she miss it?”
“Dementor?” Draco asked.
“Potter likes girls.”
"Yes, go away, Parkinson. It's very rude to keep a man from leisure activities in his own house," sniffed Draco, preparing for another strike and shaking his bottom in much the same way as a cat getting ready to jump a mouse.
’” That set him off the deep end, and they grappled for dominance, Harry still laughing, Draco still ranting, until they both ended up sprawled on the floor.
“Yeah, I’m looking into it. But it doesn’t seem likely I’ll find anything. It’s been too long. Hermione was right, I should have investigated this properly when it happened.”
"), looking for all the world as if he would start laughing at any second.
Kreacher was absolutely no help. One look at Draco and he started wailing quite piteously that ‘Master didn’t warn we are having visitors!’. Which in turn made the dog take great interest in the old elf. The animal was taller than Kreacher, even on all fours, and seemed immediately determined to stick his snout into Kreacher’s face. Harry figured it was a ‘further investigation purposes’ kind of thing, and that Kreacher should be glad the dog wasn’t sniffing his behind. The elf ran, screeching. The dog chased him, barking joyfully. Draco yelled at him to behave, being successful only in setting off Walburga’s portrait.
Really, if the roof could cave, why couldn’t he?
, I don’t think I was attacked. I think this is the result of dark magic and rot."
this morning.” Harry rubbed his forehead in a resigned way.
“I won’t say you used an Unforgivable.” Harry continued, grudgingly. He was shivering lightly too, Draco was pleased to notice.
Potter,
Draco retreated to Potter’s office while waiting. It was impossible to miss, what with the Gryffindor banner stuck proudly on a wall and piles of half-filled paperwork spread around the desk, Potter’s messy scrawl outlining everything. Draco had been pacing for the longest ten minutes – time enough to realize he was still wearing pyjamas. He quickly transfigured his clothes into something presentable. Draco would be damned if he would die wearing striped trousers. It was bad enough that he had them at all.
Potter gave him a murderous look and seemed to be on the verge of shouting some choice expletives when Weasley’s voice came booming from somewhere above them.
"I don't want your help! I just want you to
“Isn’t chocolate supposed to kill dogs?” Harry asked after a while, turning a page from a huge tome, which was half written in Latin and depicted some rather violent drawings about curse mechanisms on the human body.
“Right, because McGonagall will simply relish the thought of putting students in danger.” Hermione scoffed. “Besides, Hogwarts’ wards aren’t really all that great since the war.”
“Shut up Potter! Fucking hell,
Harry looked at Draco, torn between laughter and disbelief. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Away from your house, Potter,” Draco said in sudden irritation. The dog lifted his head in question but settled back down when he noticed nobody was actually talking to him. “Before I get arrested for spilling more of the Chosen One’s blood.”
. I'm a Death Eater, I deserve to be almost crushed to death in my own bed!"
Draco scoffed dismissively, ignoring the twinge of guilt in his gut. He glared at the ceiling until sleep claimed him again.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” said Draco in his idlest tone, leaning back against the bathtub and closing his eyes.
As Draco searched for words, Weasley shot Potter a meaningful look. It was lost on the other if his confused expression was anything to go by.
shall endeavor to avenge your honor in return for your gracious behavior.”
Draco made a helpless gesture with his shoulders, surveying the room with suspicion. Remnants from his disturbed air from earlier could still be glimpsed behind Draco’s aristocratic features, and Harry felt his heart give a pang. Both Ron and Hermione were regarding Draco with horrified expressions.
“I hate you,” he informed Draco at last. And with a pointed scowl to the dog, apparated the lot of them to Grimmauld Place.
"Why not," he squinted at Zabini, body wavering precariously under the axe.
Evening found Draco sunken to the chin in his bathtub, pondering the merits of never getting up again. He was utterly exhausted. It seemed to him that every single muscle of his body was aching. He wouldn’t be surprised if someone informed him that his magical core had been completely depleted. Hermione Granger had proved to be one ruthless supervisor. At one point, Draco had suggested just leaving the house as it was, honestly, he wouldn’t mind. A bit of extra air in a couple of rooms, wasn’t that healthy? A while later, Potter himself had lost his temper when a bean fell on his head and proposed very loudly they really did destroy the whole place, probation be damned. Draco could live somewhere else in hiding, apparently.
“What, what?”
Potter gave a muffled cry. “I should have stayed dead.”
“Naturally.”
of protective wards after you moved in.
. Cold had no effect on him. However, finding a hot cup of tea innocently waiting for him in the entrance hall was quickly becoming his favourite part of the day. Draco boasted about this. Harry declared the tea was only effective in bracing him against whatever madness he would find at Draco’s office. Draco told him to go fuck himself, but there was a biscuit next to the tea the following day.
On the other hand, as the weather progressively got worse and rain started to be a permanent fixture to all days, Draco made an accurate correlation between the depths of Harry’s bad temper and just how wet and cold he was upon arriving from work.
“Well. Yes.” Draco put his plate in a little table close by. “Me too.”
"To the whole of them, yes. You should have had access to your personal one from the start. Apparently, there has been a… mistake in the paperwork. I fixed it"
“I think…” he started and then inhaled sharply. Draco straightened up and stared ahead. “
“I spent three months redecorating this place!” Harry exclaimed, indignant, and received a mocking look for his troubles.
“Really?” He drawled. Smirked. “Well in that case I can’t really hold it against you, Potter. I am quite dashing after all.”
“Oh. Right.” Harry said, feeling his amusement fade. He had – very productively – spent his working hours combing through all the Prophet’s mentions of the Malfoys in the last years. Ron had taken one look at him bent over dusty issues in the Ministry’s archive and bailed, muttering to himself something that sounded a lot like
Potter rose, grumbling and shaking his robes. He was apparently done. Draco put his hands down but was unable to stop staring. Potter himself had his eyes firmly on the fireplace. He looked remarkably shy in the sudden silence. For someone that was shouting with such abandon just a few seconds ago, anyway.
Harry looked at his own hands, annoyed. Figures. Why was he always the one with the strange visions?
“But if Harry really is the target, then he can’t be the primary-”
“But he attacked you-”
“Right,” Hermione brightened, leaning in. “It’s very straightforward really. First, we have to dispel the dark magic that made the roof cave in the first place. Draco, you were right about that.”
Cursing himself, his life, and
“We’re eating here?” he asked, rather dumbly, and received an impatient glance from Draco for his efforts.
“Saying your hair is ugly isn’t a war crime, Weasel,” Draco replied calmly, peering at Weasley over the rim of his cup of tea. He bit back a laugh when the other man spluttered in indignation. Hermione sighed.
"Sure Potter. I'll hire some contractors." Potter’s hand was abruptly halting him in the middle of the hall. All amusement was gone from his eyes.
“It was my idea!” protested Harry, scowling. “I do have some good ones, you know.”
Harry went to sleep angry. He punched his pillows, trying to get comfortable, and kicked his blankets off. He glared in the direction of Draco’s room across the hallway. The whole house had been covered in an unnatural hush after dinner. Still upset, Harry closed his eyes. As it turned out, he was in for a long, restless night full of disturbing dreams of white-blond hair, dark marks, and quiet forests.
“What
“How is she, anyway? Astoria.”
“And my sentence is your business? If you can stick your righteous nose in my affairs, THEN SO CAN I!”
“Then there were the wounds.”
“More importantly, how does he keep finding Draco? And why not just kill him, why the suspense?”
“I have to go back to the ministry. You’re all set?” Draco hummed and nodded.
PS: I don’t think we’ll need Heloise for this letter, will we?
“What the fuck, Draco,” said Harry, getting annoyed himself. “This just proves we need to move faster.”
Harry fire-called his friends. His obstinate, idiotic friends, that were now risking their offspring just to help him.
“What are you doing, Malfoy?” Draco lowered his eyes and started tracing his fingers in random patters on the wood. Ultimately decided that he could be casual.
“Oh, so what. He started off by attacking me, what’s to say he didn’t just go back to his original target?”
“It’s remarkable magic!” Draco sounded delighted, eyes shining bright and his hair sticking in all directions. That particular night ended with Harry atop his broom, shouting himself hoarse, and Ron laughing so much he got the hiccups. The chandelier was modified to spiting a harmless foamy material, which forever ingratiated Draco to Hermione.
“Oh, come on mate. He knows! What about sixth year when-”
“Focus!” Harry snapped when Draco took too long to open his door, being too busy finishing an insult. Draco shot him an annoyed glance but entered the house.
“Oh, don’t you dare Potter. I’m not
, and got exactly what you deserved.”
Draco still couldn’t quite believe he was back in this position. So to speak. Wasn’t it just an hour ago he had pledged very seriously to himself to be as cold and sneering as a Malfoy ought to when dealing with the Saviour? If Harry weren’t such a Gryffindor, he would have sworn that this was Slytherin subterfuge. Shameless Salazarian manipulation.
“Following what- wait-”
“Fuck-” Draco yelped when dog-Potter jumped on the bed, jolting them. The animal was still whining. Before either of them could do anything, Potter licked both of Harry’s forearms.
"Oh. Er… well, maybe you could buy the material and fix the roof by yourself?" He sounded doubtful even as he said the words. Draco scoffed.
Enjoy!
Pansy picked her way carefully around the semi destroyed rooftop, testing each bean before stepping on it. The loud crack of an axe hitting the wood made her jump. She could hear the few remaining peacocks in the garden screech in outrage.
Draco inhaled sharply and looked up. “Potter, I swear to Merlin,-”
“… truly fascinating, what they can do with magical houses. You should read up on some of the books I bought yesterday, Harry. It would really help you when you decide to remodel Grimmauld Place.”
“But you see, that wouldn’t work, because the neighbors-” Ron unexpectedly gulped and straightened up. Draco looked in the same direction and found Harry and Hermione staring incredulously at the both of them.
“Cursed clock.” Harry tilted his head, watching the bird disappear and then come out again.
you could get Draco’s assignments from his department and give them to him. He would never miss work while we sort this out.”
?” Harry gaped when the person twisting next to him at last managed to sit up.
Over the next few days, after what Harry had taken to calling the Naked Draco incident, (to himself, anyway), a truce of sorts was at last brokered between the two of them. Gradually, and sometimes a bit uncertainly, they started to seek each other out around the house. Draco would drop by Harry’s study and disparage over Harry’s taste in music (Harry was going through a Nirvana phase). Harry, never one to have a structured anything in his life before, much less a schedule, found to his surprise that he would wander into Draco’s office around dinner time unfailingly, and pester him until the man dropped whatever project he was working on and joined Harry downstairs. Draco actually liked to cook, much to Kreacher’s despair, and extensive negotiations had taken place until it was officially agreed that Kreacher would be responsible for breakfast and snacks, but dinner was Draco’s rightful meal.
“Yes.” His tone is clipped. What is his problem?
“Of course it is.” I murmur and roll my eyes. “Just set it up on the dining table over there.”
“Have you had enough time? Do you have any questions before I do any more tests or go through everything with you?”
“What is it?” she says inquisitively, bright-eyed and bushy tailed. She’s slept well, too.
“Hey! I take offence to that. Of course I was going to do it for you. What are slytherin besties for, if not to do interviews with smug CEO bastards when your best friend is ill.” She giggles and I kiss her cheek. “Did you eat something? And take the rest of that potion? You look better.” I say, changing the subject.
“Never Andy!” I shout after her.
“So Teddy… you know we don’t want anyone to know about the baby yet right?” Draco asks him as we approach the door.
Ladies know what to guard against, because they read novels that
“Draco! He sooo likes you! That just proves it.” I roll my eyes at her but deep down my subconscious is swooning.
“Fine Pans, but you need to get back to bed first.” I point to her bedroom to make my point clear. “For my sake as well as yours.” I whisper while looking at the dirty tissues.
I'm not going to get emotional. A huge lump forms in my throat, and I hug him, hard. He puts his arms around me, bemused, and I can't help it - tears pool in my eyes.
“Oh yeah? And what were his thoughts saying?” I ask sarcastically. He chuckles and sighs.
“I’d like to stay for today. If that’s okay. I have to work tomorrow.”
“Theo, come on, let's go.” Harry says mildly.
The next morning goes quickly. I give Teddy a bath and some breakfast then we all head to the new house. Draco goes back to bed and I give Nia her lesson. Teddy plays with his toys from grimmauld while I’m teaching. After that we start painting the hallway. The party is at 2 o’clock, so we don’t have time to do a whole room.
“How about… a tickle?” I say and attack him with tickles. He laughs and shrieks and eventually I let go of him so he can breath.
“I’m sorry for shouting. It’s these bloody hormones.” He huffs.
His mouth quirk up at this and he stares at me appraisingly.
“Then how?”
“What does this agreement mean?”
“Draco, calm the fuck down! No it doesn’t make you look pregnant. Nobody will know.” I try to calm him down and walk slowly towards him like he’s a wild animal.
Percy's daughter Molly, who’s 3, and Bill's daughter Dominique, also 3, raced past and shouted hello. Bill’s other children, victoire (5 years old) and louis (just 1), were on the carpet together. Victoire was trying to get Louis to walk over to her, but he was more interested in the colours on the rag rug carpet. He had started taking a few steps at a time lately so Victoire was more interested than ever.
After we have finished our pudding, we sit there a little while. We are both happy and full and loved. He has done such a nice thing for me that I have to invite him to the party now. He has to come and be with my family. It would be so lovely to have them all together.
“Merlin Harry...look.” He says between sobs. I kiss him and wipe my eyes.
“I’m not sure I’m sweet enough.”
“You know what! All your snide little comments to Hermione.”
He slides off me and stands beside the bed, staring down at me, his eyes dark with want. His look is triumphant mixed with relief.
“Well...I kind of like not working there. I didn’t realise how hard it was on me until I took this break to be with you. And it’s not like we need the money, we both have inheritance money. I was thinking of quitting the aurors actually.” I look away from him then. I don’t know how he’ll take this.
“Nia I need you to tell your boss that you are unwell and going home, tell them that you will be back in tomorrow as normal. And then you are going to come with us to our new house and calm down and tell us everything. Okay?” She hiccuped and sniffs but nodded.
Harry is running his hands through his hair and pacing up and down his study. Two hands - that’s double exasperation. His usual concrete control seems to have slipped a notch. I can hear things rattling in the draws and feel the waves of accidental magic. If he can’t control his magic, then this whole house could explore. I’ve barely seen what he can do but I know he has a lot of power.
“I’m gonna see if he’s okay. Are you sure you’re okay to have us over for tea Andy?”
“Nah, I’m going with Gryffindor, just like his dad.” He smiles at me. “He’s got nerve that kid, telling everyone our secret.” He chuckles.
“I haven't finished my cod.”
“I know what you meant Harry, it's okay….Fred would have loved this.”
“Master Draco be in his living room sir. Eating without Potter agains, he said sir.” The quivering elf said.
Understood?
“Yes thank you, I’m fine. Have you all got drinks?” At that moment Seamus sits back down with three pints and passes one to Harry and one to Dean. We both say our thanks and Dean gives him a little smirk and a wink. Definitely something going on there.
For the main course we had sticky fig lamb cutlets with warm bean and couscous salad. I was practically moaning with every bite it was so good. Draco had done an amazing job and must have been practising for hours on end.
At eleven precisely, headmaster McGonagall appears from the main doors and makes her way to the teachers table. She is followed by the other professors. We stand and applaud our teaching staff. Some professors nod and wave, others look bored. Last up is Pansy and Harry. Harry stands out in his bespoke grey suit with a grey robe thrown over, jet black hair glinting under the rays of sun from the enchanted ceiling. I don't think I’ve ever seen him in a robe before. He suits them. He looks so serious and self-contained. As he sits, he undoes his jacket, and I glimpse his tie.
“Merlin, sorry Harry, Draco. I didn’t even think. Of course, I’ll get something sorted.” We say our goodbye and off we go.
At 8 o’clock there is a knock at the door. Draco has just had a contraction and is having a drink now while I dap his head with a washcloth.
“She’s on the dance floor.” Harry leans in and shouts over the music. I blush at his closeness. He rolls his eyes and leads me hand in hand over to the bar.
“I want to fuck you mouth, Draco, and I will soon.” his voice is hoarse, raw, his breathing more disjointed.
“Okay. Thanks George, we will see you tomorrow then.” I tell him, because Draco clearly is not up for talking and nobody is pushing him.
“Daaa.” Leo says and holds his hands out for me. Draco passes him over and gives me a kiss.
“I’ve not been here for a while. We don’t get a choice - they cook whatever they’ve caught or gathered.” He raises his eyebrows in mock horror, and I have to laugh. The waitress takes our drinks order. She flushes when she sees Harry, avoiding eye contact with him, hiding under her long brunette bangs. She likes him! It’s not just me!
At 4 o’clock we went to the burrow, together. Everyone was surprised but so welcoming to Draco. He froze when seeing Bill but quickly unfroze when he spotted  victoire and Dominique. After half an hour Draco had relaxed a bit and was speaking with ease. He had had a conversation with almost everyone by the time we had finished eating, laughing and joining in like he belonged. He stayed close to me the whole night though and I could tell he was still nervous as hell. We even got him to play seeker for the other team when we decided it was time for quidditch. After not too long he was flying with confidence and racing after the snitch. My team won of course but he tried his hardest. Ron got super pissed after quidditch and told everyone he loved Draco, as a friend of course.
“No not at all, next Friday?” I was quick to reassure.
“You’re secure, no escaping.” He speaks and I can hear him through the helmet. He must have communication spells on the helmets. “Breathe, Draco.” He adds softly. He strokes my knuckles with his thumbs and then turns his head. He grins at me and gives me a brief, chaste kiss which leaves me reeling, my insides clenching at the thrilling, unexpected touch of his lips.
“Leo?” I say.
“So you decided on some exercise.” he breathes, his voice soft and melodious. His fingers gently tuck my hair behind my ear. “Why, Draco?” His fingers circle my ear, and very softly, rhythmically, he tugs my earlobe. It’s so sexual.
I press ‘send’, hugging myself, laughing at my little joke. Will he find it as funny?
“Good.” I murmur.
“What?” She said with a raised eyebrow much like Draco’s but I must admit Draco makes it look much sexier.
“Oh shit, yeah.” I take a puff and then speak again. “So, do you want the photos?”
“I didn't think so.” He opens the top drawer of the chest and removes a packet of condoms. “I know there’s a spell but it isn’t as effective and can slip off sometimes.” He gazes at me intently. “Be prepared,” he murmurs. “Do you want the blinds drawn?”
“What if I am ill Harry? What if I’m dying?” Then he breaks down completely and falls forward into my chest. I put my arms around him and rock him gently.
Theo laughs at that.
“I could make you stay.”
“Teddy! You are not to say that word!” I tell him because he probably doesn’t know, in fact he’s probably heard it off Ginny this morning and thinks it’s okay to say.
My cheeks flush and I want to run but I can’t seem to move. We are both silent for a moment and then he sighs and closes his eyes in defeat.
I gasp….how can he say things like that to me and not expect me to be affected.
“You are one brave young man.” he whispers. “I am in awe of you.”
“You cheated!” I declared jokingly to wind him up.
Harry Potter
“In here ‘mione!” I shout back to her.
When I’ve finished eating my breakfast I go to head upstairs but the doorbell stops me on the second step. I turn around and head for the door. I open it quickly expecting the mail man or Hermione but the person who stands there has soaking wet blonde hair and a frown on his face.
The door swings open and Teddy rushes in. He is about to jump on the bed towards Draco but I catch him mid air. Draco still flinches though and puts his arms over his huge stomach.
“Back through the castle doors and to the left.”
“I know that lip is delicious, I can attest to that, but will you stop biting it?” he says through clenched teeth. “Yours chewing it makes me want to fuck you, and you’re sore, okay?”
“That’s better. Why are you crying? You never cry.” She summons my brush with her wand, sits behind me, and very slowly starts brushing out the knots in my hair.
I would like to fly.
“He was fine,” I murmur.
I gaze at him and take in the sight of him. He really is handsome, and after last night, the drinking and the vomiting, he is still here. He wants to take me to London and have dinner with me. He wants my consent, whatever that means. Why me? I remember his words then - there’s something about you - and I feel the same about him. I want to get to know him and find out all his secrets.
The waitress returns with venison, but my appetite has vanished. What a revelation. Harry the submissive….holy shit. I take a large slug of wine - he’s right, of course, it’s delicious. Jeez, all these revelations, it’s so much to think about. I need time to process this, when I’m on my own, not when I’m distracted by his presence. He’s so overwhelming, so alpha male, and now he’s thrown this bombshell into the equation. He knows what it’s like.
I nod. He scowls at me but chooses not to say anything. I breathe a small sigh of relief. My stomach is churning with all this new information, and I’m feeling a little lightheaded from the wine. I watch as he devours everything on his plate. He eats like a horse. He must work out to stay in such great shape. The memory of the way his pyjamas hung from his hips comes unbidden to my mind. The image is totally distracting. I squirm uncomfortably, my pants a bit tighter. He glances up at me, and I blush.
I hit ‘reply’.
“Nia I’m so sorry you had to go through that. But I think we can explain what happened. You see, 6 years ago there was a big war in the wizarding world. The biggest anyone had seen….” me and Draco each take turns telling Nia about the war and everything that happened. After we had finished Nia stood up and spoke quietly.
Here’s a link to a drawing i did of them if anyone is interested. Its of the whole family.  https://thefangirlhemp.blogspot.com/2020/09/drarry-fanfic-drawing.html
“Yes dear.” I tell him with a wink and a tap of my pocket.
“Does she know youre here?” He asked. I've not realised it but we have started walking up the stairs already.
Harry Potter
He moves his finger in a wide circle, stretching me, pulling at me, his tongue mirroring his actions, around and around. I groan. Then he takes me into his mouth and it’s too much….my body begs for relief, and I can no longer deny it. I let go, losing all coherent thought as my orgasm seizes me, wringing me again and again. Holy fuck!  I cry out, and the world dips and disappears from view as the force of my orgasm renders everything null and void.
This chapter carries on from the last chapter.
The waitress takes our bowls, interrupting us for a moment.
When we get to the house, Nia comes down and greets us.
“I told him I’d meet him at Andy’s at 2.” I looked at my watch and back over to Hermione. “Speaking of which, we should get going.” She nodded and we both looked over at Teddy. As soon as I saw him I froze and heard Hermione make a little gasping noise. Teddy was still playing with the ducks but instead of seeing his normal face, he had changed it into a ducks face. Memories came flooding back of Tonks messing around at the table changing her face into all sorts of animals including a duck. And then more memories came up of her and with them brought memories of Remus, like when he came over to tell me Teddy had arrived and they had named me godfather. I could feel wetness on my checks and realised I was crying. I hadn’t even realised Hermione had moved until I looked up again and saw her speaking to Teddy in a low voice. I covered my face with my hands and turned away, but I couldn’t get the memories to go. It's like they were assaulting my brain and I was getting a headache from it.
“Not yet.” He says breathing harder as another contraction takes over. After it's finished he looks at me. “Will you get behind me again please.” He pants out.
“Where do you want to give birth?”
“I don’t deserve it okay?!” He all but shouts at me. “They are such kind people. Don’t you understand. Bill got disfigured because of me Harry! That was my fault! I let the death eater into Hogwarts and Greyback attacked Bill, because I let him in! And Fred died! He died! And everything’s my fault!” He was crying now but all I could do was stare and listen. “Good people died, and they didn’t deserve it! I should have died, but I didn’t. I got to live, while people lost their mothers, sons, brothers, cousins. Everyone lost somebody in that war, and I was on the wrong fucking side. And now… now you ask me to come to dinner with people who should hate me and wish me dead, and you wonder why I decline.” He takes a deep breath, tears still spilling from his eyes, and seems to be finished. I take his face in my hands and make him look at me.
“You aren’t giving much away.” He says drying and rubs his chin.
“Oh Harry. I’m sure it’s just the hormones. It’s a big thing to find out especially if you’re not expecting it and don’t think it’s possibly. I’m sure all he wants is for you to be with him but he’s too stubborn and you know it.” She's probably right. “Stay here, i'll be back in a minute.” She walked out the kitchen and I heard the floo go. I had started picking at the eggs in front of me when I hear the floo go again and then a voice.
“I’m sure I can….erm, lend you one. Get your things, we’ll drive back to Scotland and grab some lunch on the way. I need to dress.”
“A little.” I blush.
Draco
“I’m good.”
“The past is behind us Harry and I’m pretty sure Draco of all people has tried to forget it. Just tell him. What’s the worst that could happen?”
“That was a beautiful piece. Bach?”
“Just about my trip to France,” I say sweetly, hoping to diffuse their mutual hostility.
“Open it and find out Daddy.” He kisses me again and I lean around him to open it with both hands. I take one look and burst out laughing.
“Would you like some dessert?” Harry asks, ever the gentleman, but his eyes still blaze.
“I was going to email them to you, but you kind of interrupted me.”
“UNCLE HARRY!” Oh so it is teddy.
“Mmmhhh.” Is all I manage back. I had put it off so far because I hadn’t spoken to her in a while and I felt kind of guilty. But it needed to be done. I’ll do it tomorrow after our appointment.
I smiled to myself and remembered what had gone down yesterday after Ron and Hermione had left me waiting on Draco.
“You look nice,” he says.
“Yay, uncle Drcao and baby Leo are coming too.” Teddy says happily.
“I liked what happened in the elevator.” I murmur as he takes my hand again and we head up the stairs. I think I hear a small gasp but can't be sure and so head the rest of the way in silence.
“Mr Potter will see you in a moment. May I take your jacket?”
“If you’re looking for your jeans, I vanished them last night.” His gaze is dark and he shrugs. “They had vomit on them.” He says as an excuse.
Oh…. that surprises me. Before I can question him further on this revelation, he interrupts my train of thought.
“Yeah bye crookshanks.” Ron chuckles to himself and Hermione smacks him and pushes him towards the floo.
“Hey guys.” I wave to them.
“Are you smirking at me, Mr Malfoy?” He looks amused but it's hard to tell. He tilts his head to one side. I flush at his tone and look down. I can't look at him when he talks like that.
As soon as we arrive, Molly comes to greet us. It’s just a small tea today with Molly, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. Arthur is working late tonight so couldn’t make it, which doesn’t bother Molly as long as she has someone to cook for.
“Goddammit! That stupid fucking cat!” I slam my drink down on the counter and head to the living room. As soon as I open the door, crookshanks shoots past me. I try to grab him but he expertly avoids me and runs around Draco and up the stairs.
I turn back to the task at hand, trying to hide my smile. He’s hard to stay mad at. Especially when he’s being so uncharacteristically playful. He opens a drawer and takes out two slate black placemats for the table. I pour the egg mix into the pan, pull out the bacon, turn it over, and put it back under the grill.
“Yes.” It’s the right decision. If I stay here, in this room with him, he will fuck me. I stand, purposefully. “We both have the graduation ceremony tomorrow.”
“That’s a matter of public record, Mr Malfoy.” He says in a stern voice. Shit. Of course, if I had known I was doing this interview I would have done some research either in the library or using the muggle internet. I’m flustered now and decide to move on quickly.
“Stop biting your lip, or I will take you back in and fuck you, whether Weasley comes looking or not.”
“It has?”
“Draco Lucius Malfoy! You like him! I have never seen you like this, so….so…. affected by a guy. You’re blushing!”
“Yes I’m sure they are. As long as Draco does what I’ve asked and takes this potion once a day, then it will be alright.” She hands me a box of potions and some more leaflets on blood pressure.
“My mother and father have been planning it for a while, and I haven't seen her in ages.”
“Feel it, baby.” Harry whispers in my ear, and very gently grazes my earlobe with his teeth. “Feel it for me.” My legs are pinned by his to the side of the bath, holding me prisoner, giving him easy access.
“What do you mean he’s not alone?”
I finish in the shower and get some clean joggers on, I leave my top off for now because I’m quite hot after my shower. I head downstairs to get some breakfast and I notice it’s raining outside. Great, that means a wet and muddle game of quidditch after the party. I think that’s exactly what I need to get me out this rut. I grab some bread and put it in the toaster, then pour myself a glass of orange juice.
The wine floats over and he takes it from the air to pour himself. He finally takes a seat and I take a hasty sip.
“I do this to men and women who want me to.”
I give him a small smile.
“Not with you.”
“Thanks uncle Harry!” He says quickly then. I laugh and say no worries.
“They’re lovely. Raising the ordinary to extraordinary.” I all but whisper, too distracted by the paintings….and maybe Mr Potter himself. He catches my gaze and cocks his head to the side and regards me.
“Why the hell didn't you brief me on the guy! I didn’t know a thing about him and he made me feel like an idiot for not doing basic research.”
Here’s another chapter. Hope you like it! X
"No he is not." Luna huffs and looks down trying to hide her blush. "He's just my friend."
Blonde number one returns with a glass of water with ice in it.
“Harry. You just don't fight fair.”
“Greg, for the hundredth time, I have a date this evening.”
He takes my hand again and leads me to the dance floor. Shit, I don’t do dancing. I try to pull back and he looks at me. He looks slightly amused for a minute and then suddenly I’m in his arms and we are dancing. Holy shit, can he dance!
I’ll meet you in the Marble Bar.
Pansy has picked out, and maybe altered, my clothes for tonight and for graduation tomorrow. I wish I could feel more enthused about clothes and make an extra effort, but clothes are just not that important to me. I mean, I know what looks good and what doesn’t, but I couldn’t really care less about fashion. And besides, I usually have a robe on for school, and don’t go to many other places.
“Harry be careful please.” He sounded sincere. “Can you do this another time, there’s probably nothing up there anyway.”
Oh…. I can’t keep still. How can I not move? I wriggle beneath him.
15 minutes later I come upstairs thinking Draco is going to be asleep but instead he is throwing up in the bathroom. There is sick on the bed and the floor and a trail of blood.
“I know, I’m kind of jealous.” Draco says and we laugh. “I hope the rest of the house turns out just as good.” He finishes blowing the rest of the birthday balloons up with magic and sits down on the couch. I put the bow on the door and then join him. There was no denying Draco was pregnant anymore. He was huge and couldn’t hide it. Whereas Hermione could still hide hers if she wanted to, which annoyed Draco every time he saw her.
“If you were mine, Draco, you wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week after the stunt you pulled yesterday. You didn’t eat, you got overly drunk, and you put yourself at risk.” I swallow. He closes his eyes and shudders with dread passing briefly over his face. When he opens them again, he glares at me. “I hate thinking of what could have happened to you.”
I climb slowly out of bed and notice that my jeans and shirt are hanging on the wardrobe door. Where are my boxers? I check beneath the chair. Nothing. Then I remember - he squirrelled them away in the pocket of his jeans. I flush at the memory, after he….I can’t even bring myself to think about it, he was so - barbarous. I frown.
“Him and Nia have gone last minute baby shopping. It’s not like we need any more stuff but Draco worries.” I roll my eyes and smile.
“Really! Can I come and see?”
“Draco, you should steer clear of me. I’m not the man for you.” What the hell! Where is this coming from? Surely I should be the one judging that. I frown and my head swims with rejection.
Ah yes, the no masturbation clause.
The Submissive will keep himself clean and shaved and/or waxed at all times. The Submissive will visit a beauty salon of the Dominant’s choosing at times to be decided by the Dominant and undergo whatever treatments the Dominant sees fit. All costs will be met by the Dominant.
“Sorry,” I whisper. “I didn't mean to disturb you.”
“Once!” She scoffs.
“Good luck.” I shout to her.
I look between the stairs and the living room and just decide to give up. I grab my drink out the kitchen and follow Draco’s lead of making myself comfy on what’s left of the sofa.
“Hard limits?” I ask; the first thing coming to mind.
“Who said romance was dead?” she whispers, horrified. I’ve shocked Pansy. I didn't think that was possible. I shrug apologetically.
“That was really nice.” I whisper, smiling coyly.
Draco Malfoy
Harry Potter
“You’ll be amazed what you can find on the internet.” he murmurs.
“Why don’t you see for yourselves.” I show them the door and signal them to go into the house.
“So what’s the plan for the rest of the day?” He asks and arches his eyebrow flirtily.
“No!” I laugh and kiss him. He giggles and nods. “You know what this means?” I ask him. He looks at me and tilts his head. “You officially beat Molly.” We both laugh and then the envelope is grabbed out of my hand. I look up to see Orion looking at it funny and tilting his head just like Draco just did.
I peek up at him. He’s enjoying a private joke, a trace of a smile flirting with his lovely mouth. I fear that it may be at my expense.
Then there’s a big boom and suddenly there’s a big pink baby wrapped in a blanket in the sky. It’s eyes are closed and it has bright red hair sticking out the blanket. Everyone cheers and Hermione screams a little. Her and Ron kiss and hug and everyone congratulates them.
“Great! When we are closer to moving in, we can come back and move it closer to the house. It will be our apple tree, that our children can pick apples off and we can show them how to cook apple pie.” I smiled at the picture of it in my head.
“Good!”
“Harry…” he cries and I hug him close.
“I know, I’m this tall now.” He said and stood up to show us how tall he was and put his hand to his forehead. I snort at that and Draco jabs me in the side.
“This is my favourite tea.” I say with a quiet, breathy voice. He frowns, surely knowing I’m hiding something. I put the tea bag in the hot water and stir it around. When I feel it’s dark enough I take it out. I can feel Potter gazing at me and look up to find him looking quizzical.
“Turn around, face me.” he orders, his voice soft. I do as I am told. He’s watching me intently.
He reaches down, and from his pants pocket, he takes out his silver-grey silk tie…..
“I think he said no.” A voice says darkly from behind. Holy shit! Harry Potter is here. How? Blaise lets me go suddenly and I fall to the wall. I glance at Potter and he is furious. That’s all the motion I need, and in that moment my stomach heaves and I throw up on the wall and ground.
“That tree has always been a hazard. I’m glad I was here. I don’t want to think what could have happened to you. Do you want me to take you back to your room?” He finally releases me and now I’m just standing in front of him looking like a fool.
“I can make an exception, or maybe combine the two, we’ll see. I really want to make love to you. Please, come to bed with me. I want our arrangement to work, but you really need to have some idea what you’re getting yourself into. We can start your training tonight - with the basics. This doesn't mean I've come over all heart and flowers; it's a means to an end, but one that I want, and hopefully you do, too.” His gaze is intense.
“Safely?”
“Hello Teddy.” Draco says then and hugs him from where he is attached to me, then kisses his head to. Teddy reaches for his stomach and strokes it gently.
“Ermm I don’t actually know. We haven’t really looked around the fields yet.”
I look at all the kids and then at Draco and they are all smiling and I’m filled with joy. Draco looks at me and smiles. Then he gets up after Ophelia has gone chasing after Elsa and he sits on my knee. This isn’t a strange sight for the kids. Draco has always liked to be close. And I love him for it. He grabs my face and kisses me slowly. When he pulls back he claps to get the kids attention.
“How did we get here Ron? From being hunted down by Voldemort, to surviving and having family’s.” I’m still staring at Draco and don’t realise what I’ve said.
“Great, well I’ll ask Blaise if he can take the photos but I don’t know where.”
“What shall I wear?” He asks me after going through all his clothes, that he keeps at grimmauld, about 10 times. “How about this? What are you wearing?”
“What if someone had taken polyjuice potion?”
“Yes.”
“Because it was a secret.” I tell her and start eating myself.
“Please call me Andy, Harry. Everything is fine, I’m finished with my jobs if you want to go home.” She says and strokes my hair.
Potter sees us and must excuse himself as he comes over.
No acts involving medical instruments.
“No, Draco. Dark knight maybe.” He shakes his head and there’s that secret smile once more. “Did you eat last night?” He suddenly shifts to serious. I shake my head at him. He clenches his jaw. What the fuck have I done now?
“I don't think I’ve ever thought about it like that. Mrs Robinson was part of that lifestyle. I told you, she’s a good friend now. If you’d like, I can introduce you to one of my former subs. You could talk to them.”
“Yeah me to mate, me to.” And he’s most probably looking at Hermione. Though knowing Ron he could also be looking at the food.
“I’ll call you, Weasley.” He says presumably to the guy following us. I’m right and...Weasley…. heads down the corridor the opposite way. Potter then turns his intense green eyes on me. Oh shit, have I done something wrong?
“Not in front of the muggles dear.” He says with an eyebrow up.
As we walk through Hogsmeade, I feel lighter than air. We stop outside madam Puddifoot's tea shop. Potter lets go of my hand and holds the door open for me.
May I offer a definition for
“It’s your house Harry.” She said very calmly and on purpose. She knew what i was talking about, which meant she knew how much of a shit hole it actually was. And which means it wasn’t a prank.
“Draco, you're going to be exhausted.” She berates.
“Hmmm I don’t know about that.” I was teasing him now and gave a little smirk. He instantly recognised what I was doing and his whole face lit up. He threw a pillow at my face and rushed over.
“What?” He looks confused.
I leave the room to call him but as I’m about to hit the button, Draco rings me.
As I’m walking back towards Hermione and Ron, they both point behind me and I see Draco running off around the house. I throw my hands up and sigh. I turn back around and go after him.
“I mean you don’t have to, but it would be a great help to me.” She grabbed my hand and fluttered her eyelashes at me. Sometimes she acted like a slytherin when she wanted to. I huff and stare at her.
“God you are SUCH a pushover since this whole baby thing.” He said with a scowl but I knew he was just playing so I laughed.
“Hey Freddie!” I shout and go over.
No acts that will leave permanent marks on the skin.
“Miss Parkinson is indisposed, so she sent me instead. I hope you don’t mind, Mr Potter.”
“Helping cook in the kitchen. Have you seen Ron by any chance?”
“Harry?” She also sounds croaky and I finally look at the clock. Its 3am on Friday morning.
“No.” I mewl.
“Are you ready?” He asks and I just hold on to him tighter. He chuckles and revs the engine. Then we are off. It is slightly bumpy and with the force of the engine I hold on even tighter to Harry, if that were possible.
I’m just about to start walking when a patronus in the form of a zebra comes racing towards us.
“I don’t doubt that.” I whisper into my cup of tea. “Why haven’t you asked me to call you by your first name?” Okay….that was not what I expected to say.
Molly spotted us and forced her way over.
“Draco, please stop biting your lip. It's very distracting.” I blush and his lip twitches. “Would you excuse me for a moment?” He gets up and disappears once more. He’s gone for a couple of minutes and then returns with a document.
“Because you went home in that deathtrap you call a broom.”
“What sort of photos does she want?”
“Greg, you are going back to America….. in three days.”
We get back to our room to get changed and Pansy goes in first.
“Merlin! Thanks Kreacher. I owe you one.” I say to him and rush to get up.
I blink at him momentarily, and then I turn over. He runs his hands from my shoulders, down my back, and onto my arse.
Just as Ron and Nia get home, Rose wakes up and starts crying. Hermione jumps up and shouts “what?!” And frantically searches for the crying baby. When her eyes land on Harry and Draco shushing the baby she sits back down and puts her head in her hands and sighs.
“Dray, what would it take for me to get you to not use any more heavy magic on the housework?” He stops then and glares at me.
I don’t get much sleep that night. I toss and turn most of the night and dream of green eyes and long fingers. They start at my shoulders and travel down, down, dow—-
I note from your tone that you have read the documentation I gave you.
Two days later, me and Draco arrived at Andromeda's to pick Teddy up. We are going to take him to the park for an hour while Andy sets the party up. Me and Draco are the distraction. I really can't wait to see Teddy’s face when everyone yells surprise. I bet he’ll be so excited.
“Is he…?” Ronald prompted.
“Stop. Please. I understand. So you and Mr. Potter had intercourse?” Draco spluttered, eyes going wide as saucers.
, who, as usual, dragged me down in his mess.” Draco drawled from his seat near a fake window. It was showing cloudy, ominous skies that surmised his mood exactly right.
"And don't come back. Traitor." Grumbled a put-out Draco, sweaty and red-faced, sitting on the floor. It quickly became apparent even amongst all the yelling and cursing following Potter's entrance, that they had Blaise to blame for the presence of the Chosen One in the Manor. Blaise rolled his eyes.
“No, it doesn’t Potter. I don’t need to be in a place where all sorts of ministry workers can easily get into. I’m still a Death Eater, and people are
“I can’t court you; you do realize that, right?”
were being a nosy bastard,
“Of course! I’m such an idiot, it’s the dark magic!”
“I dreamed I was bleeding,” said Harry, frowning, sinking further into the pillows as he spoke. He had to acknowledge the fact that he couldn’t really support his own head up, however humiliating that was. He was just so
, this chilly air all around you. You were shivering, and getting paler and paler. I couldn’t get you to wake up. I told Kreacher to go reinforce the wards.”
, had he not? A pinched-looking secretary had stared down her nose at Draco after that, and Draco had stared right back, his disdain all-encompassing. But Harry kept his promise to not go babbling about Draco’s impulsive use of Killing Curses, so the Malfoy heir felt the need to send him a thank-you note:
Thanks you all so much for the reviews and kudos. You bring me joy =D
"You know, I think he got more dramatic, yeah."
Next came all the joys of looking after a living being. Draco waged war against the stubborn fur, washed the dog until his fingers were pruning, and had a rather disquieting meeting with fleas. He called for reinforcements. Pansy Parkinson and Astoria Greengrass appeared in his house soon afterwards, carrying books, dog food, and mockery.
"Oh. Of course. I forgot. Burning down the Manor, right," mumbled Potter, dazed.
. And had to immediately duck when an orange hex was thrown his way.
He left them to their lunacy and went downstairs to procure himself some Earl Grey. Twenty minutes later, Draco strode in. He had seemingly gotten over Harry’s rearrangement of the house. His hair was wet, turned into a slightly more subdued colour than the usual shock of blond, and he had changed into perfectly pressed black trousers, a white dress shirt, and a waistcoat. Harry rolled his eyes. His own typical clothes for staying in were in fact just pants, but of course, Draco would be as pretentious as hell.
“The Grim, eh?” Harry said, chuckling humourlessly. “Appropriate.”
you do it? How do you make even a handwritten letter sound like the work of a complete and utter wanker? I could almost see the derision leaping off the parchment, in your
“Exactly.” Draco’s face was lighting up with enthusiasm too. Harry found himself thinking that he should smile more. It would do his reputation as a snob some reprieve. “This room is brimming with dark magic, and-”
“Master called?” asked Kreacher, Apparating in with a pop.
. He held on tightly to his dog through the rest of the early hours, thoroughly spooked, a
“The Grim?” Ron asked, his complexion, already pale from the conversation, taking a slightly green turn. Hermione huffed.
at the
Whoever or whatever the thing was, it was still marching purposely in their direction, ever closer. Harry and Draco moved back as one, shoulders touching.
“Shut up, Harry.”
“Well, that’s new.”
“What?” he snapped, thoroughly incensed.
! Look!" He waved a broken roof tile at her, cheeks dirty with wall plaster.
“Well, we all knew your investigative skills would be sloppy at best, Potter.” Draco drawled, and Harry broke out of his reverie.
. And then, completely against his better judgment, his eyes, which were staring into Draco’s wide ones, started following droplets of water that were sliding down his face, his lips, down his neck, chest – what do you know, he wasn’t lying about the scars – abs and…
“Don’t call our daughter a demon.” Hermione admonished, but one corner of her lips went up. She sat down next to Draco. “Back to the point. You ran and tried a variety of spells.”
Thank you all for the kudos and comments! You're too good to me :D
“Yellow.” Harry offered, starting to grin. Draco sent him a scandalized look.
Malfoy (because
It soon became apparent to Draco that while Potter yelling at people had the power to make the bureaucratic wheel spin that much faster, no amount of yelling at
Draco drummed his fingers against the tub’s porcelain irritably.
Draco hadn't, and was glad of it.
“Sure, but we’ll have to be quick about it. We don’t know how long we have outside until he’s on your trail again.”
“Shove your infuriating hero complex up your arse for a second,” Draco said, without any real bite. “How are you feeling?”
Draco sniggered while his friends found places around the table. Even if a niggling part of him was annoyed at the interruption. Draco was a sore topic in the Chosen One’s life?
He eventually came back downstairs, miffed about his urge to hide inside the bedroom for the rest of the evening. He found Draco calmly sipping wine in the dining room. The table was already set, a nice spread of food on top of it, and Harry had to admit that whatever it was Draco had prepared certainly smelled good.
"I didn't forget anything Malfoy. Like I didn't forget that in the end you were just scared and wanted out. Your mother was just scared and she…. And you helped. Both of you. Ok?"
“He did, ‘Mione. I felt the magic, it was done properly.”
How else could Bill Weasley popping up in Malfoy territory be explained? The man strolled in just as Draco was threatening to throw a lamp at Potter. He looked around with curiosity, taking in the destroyed drawing room to which Draco and Potter had retreated after another screaming match in the kitchen. One of his lips quirked up- Draco was still holding the lamp over his head.
Harry had eventually walked out of the house in a furious haze, lest he blew the whole thing up by mistake. Their words were ringing in his ears, and his chest was a tight ball of pain and anger. He was wet and chilled to the bone in a matter of seconds, but actually rejoiced in the unrelenting downpour beating his skin. He strode blindly in the dark, not caring about anything anymore.
They ended up ransacking Grimmauld’s library for any books that looked promising to the case and reading them sprawled on the living room's armchairs, a roaring fire making the whole space pleasantly toasty. After his second piece of chocolate cake, Draco’s mood improved drastically, and Harry made a note to himself to always have sugar on hand.
"It's different. You were…" Potter waved his hand vaguely. "It's just different."
There would be no respite in this charity receiving business, Draco thought bitterly to himself. He let his shoulders sag a bit even as Slytherin pride protested from deep inside his bones.

Draco was called to give his statement. Yes, they were chased by an unknown subject.
A lot of bad things could be said about Draco Malfoy. He knew that. Death Eater scum, spineless coward, snob. Fine. But
(Also: Do not tell Heloise that he is a good boy. I know you did last time because he’s been pecking at me to write this letter faster so he can get more
“Arseholes? What…

Draco glanced cautiously at Harry, trying to gauge his reaction at this frankly traumatizing confession. As he watched, Harry’s expression turned from solemn to disbelieving to wildly amused.
"Apologies, Potter. How would you like me to call you? Draco's watch dog? Warden?"
“What? It’s not
, Harry paid extra attention to his surroundings, expecting his assailant to be back. He even poked around a bit on some old books he had lying around the house. But nothing came after him, other than the usual garbage, so Harry finally dismissed the whole thing.
“Indeed, Potter. The general idea was to keep you from having nightmares, not giving you wet dreams.”
“Are you sure it wasn’t a bulky girl trying to get an autograph, mate?”
“Those conditions are acceptable,” Draco said slowly, rubbing his hand against his left arm. Harry (and probably Hermione too), pretended not to notice this nervous tell. “We would need to go to my house and get some of my things.”
Then she grins at me in answer and it is infectious.
“Hey guys, everything okay?” I ask them.
“Severus? He’s…..taciturn. Doesn’t speak much and is almost always grumpy, but deep down I know how he feels.”
“Thanks, the elf’s have been teaching me. I asked them to, so I could cook for you. You always do nice things for me so I thought I would do something nice for you this time. I love you too Harry.” He says in a small by meaningful voice, with a tiny genuine smile on his face. He looked so open with me right now and I absolutely loved it and vow to make it happen more often.
“Leave her be. She’s probably got about 3 other patients. They need her as well and we are fine right now. And- ahhhhh!” She squeezes my hand really tightly then.
Laters, baby.
We all start cleaning as nothing in here actually needs to be magically fixed. Nia is asking all these questions about magic and learning and flying.
I’ve still got Teddy on my shoulders when we get back to the house, so I get him down but keep hold of his hand so he doesn’t run off into the house on his own.
He starts the ignition, and the engine roars behind us. He places his bag in the space behind our seats, presses a button, and the roof slowly retracts. With the flick of a switch, music surrounds us.
“I’m sure they’d understand Harry.” Hermione tells me.
“Draco’s gonna love that.” She says and we chuckle.
Harry Potter
“Fine, I’ll take it off shall I?” He threatens. I grab his hand quickly and place a kiss on the ring.
“Teddy Lupin!” Andy scolds from the door, where she must have been watching from.
“Blaise! How dare you!” I shout, staggered by his audacity.
“Master Harry owes Kreacher nothing. Kreacher just being a friend to Master Harry, just like Dobby would have wanted sir.” At Dobby's name I pause and look at him. He hasn’t mentioned Dobby for a while but it just occurred to me that he was probably grieving for Dobby as much as I was. Kreacher’s a lot nicer since having his locket back and having everything explained to him. Nobody ever sat him down and explained what was going on, they were just horrible to him because he was a bit grumpy. I admit I was one of those people for a bit but I eventually understood.
My appetite has completely disappeared now and I swallow nervously. He can't stay away!
“But I haven't done all the things you require from your list of rules.” My voice is all breathy, hesitant.
“But baby, I thought you liked that about me?” He does his flirty evil grin and rubs his foot with mine under the table. Then he carries on, “Anyway, did you see how nervous she got?”
“Well… nobody anymore. Almost everyone who knew them is gone now. But a lot of people told me about them in the past, so I just remember. I remember everything everyone told me and when I miss then, I just think of those memories.” He hugs me then.
“Draco…” I go in after him. He’s sat on the bed crying.
Harry is standing by the window, wearing the grey flannel pants that I love, the ones that hang in that unbelievably sexy way off his hips, and, of course, a white linen shirt. Doesn't he have any other colours? Music sings softly from the wireless, something about witches and wizards.
“Because they were all established submissives. They knew what they wanted out of a relationship with me and generally what I expected. With them, it was just a question of fine-tuning the soft limits, details like that.”
Soft limits:
After it’s finished I get him over to the pool. I take his nightshirt off and help him in, then I take my top and pants off and get behind him.
He gives me a don't-be-stupid stare.
“You are asking me if you hurt me?”
“Do you always wear jeans?” What a strange question.
“I know,” he murmurs. “Keep your hands about your head.” he orders, his voice forceful.
“Drinks?” Mr Potter seems to recover himself. “Prosecco?”
“Aargh!” I cry out as I feel the stretching sensation deep inside me as he takes my virginity. He doesn't stop until he bottoms out and then he gazes down at me, his eyes bright with ecstatic triumph.
“No, they are the first item on the menu. I don't need an aphrodisiac near you. I think you know that, and I think you react the same way near me,” he says simply. “So where were we?” He glances at my emails as I reach for another oyster.
“Working.” Hermione says angrily.
“Good boy.” he murmurs, and deliberately licks his lips slowly. I’m mesmerized by his tongue as it sweeps slowly over his upper lip. He’s staring into my eyes, watching me, appraising. He leans down and plants a chaste, swift kiss on my lips.
“Okay, and what do I get out of this?” My slytherin brain starts thinking. But he just shrugs and almost looks apologetic.
“Cum for me, baby.” His voice is harsh, hard, raw at my ear, and I explode between us as he pounds rapidly into me.
His world, indeed, and I want to belong in it, but on his terms? I just don't know. He hasn’t mentioned that bloody contract. I stare out the window and the landscape has changed. The somber night reflects my introspective mood, closing in, suffocating.
It looks like a big blue balloon has popped on one side and a big pink balloon has popped on the other side. There is a huge stack of presents either side of the buffet table. There are banners and balloons and food everywhere. There is even a bouncy castle for the kids, which Teddy has just spotted and runs for.
“Draco’s pregnant.” I sob to her with my head still in my hands.
“Sorry Harry. But you don’t need to be so skittish.” That was her way of apologising.
“Right then, we best be going. Come on Harry love. Thank you for having us aunt andromeda, Teddy I’m sure we will see you soon.” He says so quickly I nearly don’t catch it all. I look up at him in question, it's not like Draco to just up and leave. Maybe it’s something to do with the baby. I better go just in case.
“I want you to become well acquainted, on first name terms if you will, with my favourite and most cherished part of my body. I’m very attached to this.”
“I’m sorry too. But I hadn’t told Luna or Ginny. Hermione only knew because she was there when me and Draco had fallen out. That day you broke my door down.” I chuckle at that and so does he.
“Merlin Harry.” He says it like he’s dreaming and can’t stop himself. “Ahhh yeah. Ohhhh Harry yes! Ohh I love you.” As soon as I hear that, I stop completely. He must realise what he’s said then because he freezes too. My eyes are wide and I’m in complete shock. Did he really just say that?! And did he really say it first?! Oh shit, I need to tell him back quick before-
“That’s fine. Shall we say nine thirty tomorrow morning then?”
“Well okay. If you would just lie down and I can have a look what’s going on down there. If your friend here is going to faint, then I suggest he leaves.” She says and Hermione lies down. I frown and move around the bed to hold Hermione’s hand.
It’s my nephews 1st birthday today so I’ve decided to post an extra chapter this week. Plus I’ve written loads lately, I’m up to chapter 25 and I think its coming to an end. We shall see anyway.

Draco Malfoy
“I didn't really have a run-of-the-mill introduction to sex.”
“Have you eaten today?”
I stare down at my fingers. How am I going to dig myself out of this? If I tell him it was a joke, I don't think he’ll be impressed.
Olivia jumps up and fetches my jacket. Before she can hand it to me though, Potter takes it from her and holds it up for me. I blush again and feel ridiculously self-conscious but shrug it on anyway. Potter momentarily places his hands on my shoulders and I gasp in surprise at the contact. He doesn’t seem to notice my reaction, or at least doesn’t give anything away. He walks with me to the elevator and with his long fingers presses the call button for me. I stand awkwardly with him next to me looking all coolly self-possessed. Once it arrives, I hurry in and press the button for the ground floor. I am desperate to escape. I really need to get out of here.
“I didn’t know what you liked, so I got a selection.” He glares at me with a sort of apologetic smile.
“I sent him an email.”
Please him! He wants me to please him! I think my mouth actually drops open. Please Harry Potter. And in that moment I realise that yes, that’s exactly what I want to do. I want him to be fucking delighted with me. It’s a revelation.
15 years later
“Like you tell me stuff about my mummy and daddy?” He asks happily.
I find Andy in the kitchen making herself busy. She jumps slightly when she sees me.
“Touché, Mr Malfoy,” he says quietly. “I concede the food and the sleep.”
To be discussed and agreed between both parties:
“Draco don’t! What the fuck am I going to do for 2 weeks with him. He’s been here 5 minutes. How am I going to go to work tomorrow and leave him in my house.” We get to the bathroom and Draco starts looking for the right ointment.
“I’ll floo Katie and tell her it’s started. But she said she won’t come until they are 5 minutes apart lasting a minute each for over an hour. So I’ll come back up and get you comfy. Do you want me to tell anyone else?”
Severus drops me back at Hogwarts at dusk.
“This is the contract. Read it, and we’ll discuss it next weekend. May I suggest you do some research, so you know what’s involved.” He pauses. “That’s if you agree, and I really hope you do.” he adds, his tone softer, anxious.
“Maybe you will, then?”
“Hermione, what aren’t you telling me.” She stopped, huffed  and gave in to me.
“The pleasure is all mine, Mr Malfoy.”
“Where did you learn to dance?” I ask tentatively. He turns to gaze at me, his eyes unreadable beneath the intermittent light of the passing street lamps.
“You’re going all the way back to Scotland by broom?” He sounds surprised and a bit anxious. He glances at the window, which makes me look out too, and see it has begun to rain. “Well you should be careful then.” He says in a stern authoritative voice. Why the hell does he care? “Did you get everything you need?” He then asks.
“I think it might be tomorrow. Luna might be right after all.” He snorts and yawns.
The doorbell rings then, just as Draco’s about to start shouting and possibly throwing pillows. He huffs and crosses his arms.
Harry’s eyes widen infinitesimally, but I notice.
Holy shit! What the hell is he doing here?!! He looks all outdoorsy with his unruly hair and his cream knit jumper, jeans, and walking boots. I realise my mouth is hanging open and can’t seem to locate my brain or voice.
“Draco, baby,” he murmurs, and I nearly expire at the endearment.
I don't understand why you ran this evening. I sincerely hope I answered all your questions to your satisfaction. I know I have given you a great deal to contemplate, and I fervently hope that you will give my proposal your serious consideration. I really want to make this work. We will take it slow.
“Yes.” I breathe, because my mouth is suddenly parched. I hear the ice clink against the glass, and he leans down and kisses me, pouring a delicious, crisp liquid into my mouth as he does. It’s white wine. It’s so unexpected, so
“Okay.” He said without argument. He must be able to see how worried I am. A muggle is easy to deal with, but a witch is a whole other thing.
Then I see Angelina has Draco’s hand in hers and is looking at his ring. I roll my eyes.
His hazel eyes are soft and gentle.
“You’re welcome.” He said politely and stuck out his chin.
He grimaces as I get on the broom. He’s gazing at me, his expression unfathomable, eyes dark.
I frown.
“Luna was in ravenclaw, but she sat at any table, cheered on both teams at quidditch, and spoke to anyone who would listen to her,” Theo said while laughing. Luna smiled back at him and giggled. “I, however, am a fellow slytherin.” He winked at me and Pansy beamed.
Suddenly, it’s like we’re on our own in the room. Just the two of us. My whole body has come alive, every nerve ending singing softly, that electricity pulling me to him, charging between us.
“Everything, I want everything. I want you to fuck me and I want to fuck you.” My hands are on his chest and getting lower by the minute.
“Yeah… but who would have thought we would end up like this. I mean, I didn’t even know about magic until Hagrid barged down my door. Then there was Voldermort, and the war, and everyone we lost....” I can’t carry on for a minute. Hermione wraps her arms around me and stays there, then Ron puts his hand on my shoulder. “And then there was Draco, and there was finally light. And now you two have a baby and mine is due in a couple of weeks.” We are all chuckling now, some of us with tears rolling down our face. “I wouldn’t change a bloody thing though, because it’s what got us here.” They both nod and then Hermione looks in the corner.
“I really am sorry Harry, I did it in good will.” And then apparated away. I did feel a little bad about it but not much. Hermione should have just told us or not done it at all. I sombered over to Draco who was still staring off in the distance with red rimmed eyes.
I take another sip of my whiskey and am definitely drunk now but I keep drinking anyway. It has always been Ron and Hermione that have been there for me and had to pick me up when I’ve fallen. I never in a million years would have defeated Voldemort without them. They are so smart and brave and confident. They are such good people. I need to tell them right now, how good they are.
“I don’t need any help thanks. Draco just sent me to pick up a potion for him.” I go into the bathroom, open the cupboard and stop dead. There are about a hundred different potions in here and I have no clue which one’s for what. “Ermm on second thought, can you help me?” I ask the elf who followed me and is waiting by the door.
I fire up google.
“Wow, so the prince of Slytherin and only child to a pureblood family knows how to clean. I’m impressed.” I smirk at him. He shoves me playfully.
Malfoy is already sat down and Andy is just sittin when I come in with a still sleeping Teddy in my arms. Draco freezes and glares at me.
“Fuck you into submission.” She shakes her head disapprovingly. I blink rapidly at her, and I feel the blush as it spread across my face.
“Love you to. Tell Ron I said hi. Okay bye ‘mione.” And so I apparated back to grimmauld.
“Well, now everyone’s here,” he sends a look to Draco that causes everyone to laugh, “we have some news.” He looks over to Hermione and smiles. She takes his hands then takes a deep breath and looks at all of us.
“Goodnight dragon, I love you too.”
This throws me. Do couples still say that? Only three months - is that why there have been so many? He doesn't keep them for long? Or have they had enough after three months?
“I think I should have just joined you in getting plastered and dancing in your underwear.” He shrieked with laughter and then added, “would have been much more entertaining.”
The ice in my navel is melting. I am beyond warm - warm and chilled and wanting. Wanting him, inside me. Now.
“He was mostly courteous, formal, and slightly stuffy. It was like he was old before his time and he definitely doesn’t speak like he is twenty something. How old is he exactly?” I uncross my arm and turn to face her.
“Do you really want to know?”
“This is Charlie Tango, understood, Weasley. Over and out.”
“Yeah hermy, not help.” Teddy chirps up from the swing. Me and Hermione both chuckle at that and I help Teddy to get down.
I scramble up and change quickly and then head into the bathroom and brush my teeth. I stare at myself in the bathroom mirror.
20 minutes later and Draco has just beat Ron. I can't believe they haven’t played together before. And I can’t believe Ron lost! Finally!
October 7th
“How long until we are there?” I ask him.
Weasley pulls up in the large Audi. Harry opens the rear door for me, and I climb inside as elegantly as I can.
“Please love.”
CEO, Potter Enterprises Holding, Inc.
“But surely not four times a week. How about three?”
“Oh you don’t know?” Nia seems surprised and looks from Hermione to me and Draco. “Well...they give me the loft. They decorated it and did the whole thing out so that I could move in there.” Everyone goes silent at this and Ron starts choking.
September 2nd
We go into the first room, which isn’t as bad as some of the house but will absolutely take all day to just clean. So we get started with some spells around the place. When they hardly do anything, we turn to good old fashioned elbow grease. I start with scraping the mouldy wallpaper off the walls and Draco starts with cleaning the windows. We did a couple of spells on them and they don’t need replacing but do need a damn good scrub.
“Tomorrow?! You waited until the last day to ask me to look after the cat?” She was heading towards the floo now, slowly backing away from the conversations.
“You’ll have to trust me.”
“Oh no you don’t! You are not getting one of those...those things! No way!” I tell him before he can think too much into it and make his mind up.
“Hmm. Harry?” He sounds exhausted and I shush him.
“Edward Lupin! Apologise right now for scaring your uncle Draco! That was very silly.” Andromeda’s tells him off coming into the room.
“Why do you have to have such a big family? I feel like I’m seeing them everywhere I turn.”
“Yes.” He frowns. “Not my usual style. After I’ve done this, we’ll take a bath.”
“Physically.”
“Does he live here? Weasley?”
“Shit! Draco!” I try to shake him but he doesn’t wake. “Nia, go inside and go to the fireplace. You have seen me use it before. Chuck some powder in and shout ‘healer bell, st mungos’. Tell her Draco has collapsed again and to come quickly.” Nia nods rapidly, taking in every detail, and runs for the house. Katie had said at the last scan, that if he collapses again at the point, to call her straight away.
“Molly… I would like to apologise for my outburst before. It was childish and mean and I’m very sorry.” He takes her hand while saying this and she smiles at him.
“So how long have you two known each other?” Sev drawls, and looks impassively from Harry to me.
We walk the rest of the way together anyway, and chat about what has been happening since I left school.
The Submissive will obey any instructions given by the Dominant immediately without hesitation or reservation and in an expeditious manner. The Submissive will agree to any sexual activity deemed fit and pleasurable by the Dominant excepting those activities that are outlined in hard limits (Appendix 2). He will also do so eagerly and without hesitation.
I shake my head at him and frown sadly. I need to get out of here. He doesn’t want me and I don’t know what I was thinking. Why would Harry Potter want me? I wrap my arms around myself and quickly head up to the main doors. I can feel him behind me and when I’m at the doors I turn to face him but can’t look him in the eye.
“Yes, for internships at two publishers, tomorrow.”
When I nod, he pats my back gently and only removes his hand when he knows I’ve recovered.
“I know.”
Sorry for not posting guys, I’ve been in Scotland. I’ll be posting 3 chapters today to say sorry. Hope you like them. X
I hear another clink of ice, and then I can feel it around my right nipple as he tugs the left one with his lips. I moan, struggling not to move. It’s sweet, agonising torture.
“Can we feed duckies?”
Hope you like it. X
“So ‘mione, did you come here for a reason or just to chat?” She jumps up then.
“Would you like a picture copy?” She asks softly. We both just nod while still staring,  it keeps twitching and it is amazing. The image fades and we hold each other’s hands again.
“Happy birthday to you! Happy-“ I cut him off.
I glimpse Harry rolling his eyes, and I raise an eyebrow at him. He narrows his eyes at me.
I walk in and go to the front desk where I am welcomed by a very attractive young man. He’s sharply dressed and well groomed. He looked up and smiled politely at me.
“Shite!” I say out loud down the phone. “See Hermione, I’m no good at this whole friend thing. I've just woke you and Ron up- ON HIS BIRTHDAY!” I then start singing happy birthday down the phone and I’m crying by the end and drinking from the bottle of whiskey. “Why am I such a terrible person Hermione.” I sob to her. I drop the phone and curl up by the arm of the sofa and sob into my arms.
When we get back from lunch Nia offers to help with some decorating. We have picked out all the colours and wallpapers for the house but just have to get them up now. All the furniture has been ordered and is on it’s way. We just have to decorate and then build the furniture and we will basically be done. I’m bringing a few things from grimmauld but Draco doesn’t want anything from the manor. After that we just have to pack our things and move in. And done!
“Must be Harry Potter.”
“Well I think it is. I’ve been your boyfriend for over a year, I’ve met your mother multiple times. I’m just asking you to spend a couple of hours with my family, with the other people in my life whom I love. And you are standing there lying to me to get out of it. They are good people and just because they don’t have as much money as you do, and they aren’t as posh as you, it doesn’t mean you can go on pretending they don’t exist!” My voice had slowly started raising and I had ended it nearly shouting. I could feel tears running down my face. I was upset, angry, hurt, and confused. I look at Draco once more for any signs he’s about to change his mind. But he’s just standing there with his arms crossed and a frown on his face. I look down and my tears fall to the floor. I grab my coat and walk towards the floo.
“Happy birthday.” I whisper in Draco’s ear as I’m hugging him hello. Narcissa is right behind me so I just give him a kiss on the cheek.
“Yeah, and we will have to apparate there because there is no way I can walk that far.” I chuckle and nod.
Why won’t he look at me? Perhaps he’s changed his mind? A wave of unease washes over me. Perhaps walking out on him last night was the end for him, too. He’s bored of waiting for me to make up my mind. Oh no, I could have completely blown it. I remember his email last night. Maybe he’s mad that I haven't replied.
16    The Submissive shall not participate in activities or any sexual acts that either party deems to be unsafe or any activities detailed in Appendix 2.
This is hard to process. I just thought that I’d spent the night in this man's bed and yet here we are negotiating this weird arrangement.
“Palm-twitchingly mad,” he whispers. “Especially now.” His tone is quiet and deadly.
“It’s my fault. I did too much and now our baby is in danger.” He says between crying and trying to breath.
“Yeah, I should see where Hermione is. Congratulations by the way.” He slaps my back and goes off to find Hermione.
Well, maybe an inkling now.
She nods, grinning like a lunatic.
“Have you packed everything in the nappy bag?” Draco asks irritably while trying to shush a crying Leo.
CEO, Potter Enterprises Holding, Inc.
“Yeah it really was. One more party and we can get on with the house, and the nursery.” I grin at him.
“See, I knew you had a sense of humour somewhere in there.” I smile.
“Wrong? Not to me.” He shakes his head, he looks so sincere. “Try it,” he whispers. A challenge, daring me, and he cocks his head to one side and smiles his crooked, dazzling smile.
Just as the lesson is coming to an end I hear a pop of apparation. I turn around expecting Hermione but instead find Andy and Teddy. I get up and Teddy runs for his hug. I shush to him and point to Draco who is asleep on the grass.
He raises his eyebrows as his hand moves up and down his impressive length.
“Did you hear that Harry?! He called me uncle Draco!” I smile back and put my arm around his shoulders.
“So tell me the best thing to ever happen.” He said to me while giving me shit eating grin. He didn’t believe me and wouldn’t understand until I had finished. So I explained everything, how Hermione had come to the office and how I’d run through the ministry to get to the estate agency as quick as possible, how I’d looked at the pictures and just instantly saw our family there. Then I told him I’d signed the papers and handed the money over and that it was all done and dusted.
“You got some good stuff Dray, well done. Though I can’t believe you didn’t take him up on the offer to show you around. It was obvious he wanted to spend some more time with you.” She gives me a cheeky look and I just groan at her. When I think about it though I put my head back down quickly because I can feel myself blushing. Surely that can’t be the real reason he wanted to show me around. I bite my lip and try not to think about it.
“Can you not be so slytherin for once in your life?” I ask Draco as soon as Nia is out of earshot.
“There you go then, got what you wanted?” He asked, pulling away and straightening his coat.
“I see.”
“I think Draco would prefer Rome,” he says softly.
I help Draco get comfy on a towel and then sit next to him. We are at a wizards only beach so Draco doesn’t have to put a glamour on his belly.
“YOU DID WHAT!” He exploded. “How dare you buy a house for US without asking me first!! And how dare you buy anything without going in person to look at it!! And how dare you buy it without reading the contract!! HOW DARE YOU!” He screamed at me. He had gotten to his feet and was leaning over the table, it made me feel like I was in 4th year with McGonagall shouting at me.
“Safe trip, Mr Potter. Mr Malfoy.” Weasley looks kindly at me, though perhaps there’s a hint of pity hidden in the depths of his eyes.
“So what were you saying about your guide?” Theo asks his sister. “Did he not take to yours and Rolf’s whimsical ways?”
I get him in bed and jump in the other side. I’m back asleep in minutes with Draco next to me.
“Yes thank you Teddy, you’ve sang that 3 times today already.” He laughs and kisses the top of my head. That makes me chuckle because it’s usually the other way around.
“I’m sorry. I’m here Harry. Me and you, family.” He says while still crying softly.
“I don’t trust that floo at the new house yet. I want a professional to check it out, not just you randomly sticking your head in it.” He tells me with a glare. So yeah, I kind of told him by accident I had used the floo. It slipped out, but now he wants me to owl a  ‘professional’ before we use it again. “So Apparation it is. Let’s go sort our little pest problem out.”
Oh, Pansy, you have no idea.
“Hey Harry, do you wanna keep this?” Neville says and comes out of the greenhouse. He sees Draco and immediately looks at his belly and they both freeze. “Draco… hey. So I guess it’s true then. Congratulations, you two!” Draco unfreezes then, then turns and practically sprints into the house. “Oh I’m sorry Harry, I didn’t mean offence.” Neville says shyly to me.
“Good morning.” She giggles soundlessly.
“All done?” I ask him.
“You like horses don’t you Teddy?”
“Okay okay you win. Now come on, I wanna fly.” We apparate out and Draco takes control as I have no idea where we’re going.
“I was that small!” Teddy says amazed. We all laugh and he gets off my knee to look at the baby. “Can I hold him after grandma?” He asks me.
“Well, as you’re sore, I thought we could stick to oral skills.”
“Have dinner with me tonight?” He asks, changing the subject. “I'll explain everything then.”
“Wow, that cat is very clever.” Draco just stands there staring.
“No. I haven't signed anything yet, so I think I’ll hang on to my free will for a bit longer, if that’s okay with you.”
“Thanks Katie, I’ll send George in.” I get up and leave. George is at the door looking worried.
“Now now little cub, stop your crying.” I bounce him lightly in my arms and grab the bottle that Andromeda left on the side “are you hungry?” I ask him and put the bottle in his mouth. He just spits it out and screams louder. “Do you need a nappy change?” I check his nappy quickly but it’s clean. “I know!” I grab my wand and make some bubbles. Then I turn the bubbles into different animals and make them go in a circle above Teddy’s head. He stops crying instantly and waves his arms trying to catch the animals. “Phew.”
“Potter.”
“Good.” he says complacently and, I think, relieved. “Yet another first, Mr Malfoy.” He looks appraisingly at me. “Well, you get an A for oral skills. Come, let's go to bed, I owe you an orgasm.”
I’m silent for a moment.  “What are the rules I have to follow?”
“I can’t do this anymore.” He cries quietly to me. I can feel the tears and sweat run down my neck. “Harry do something.” He sobs.
“I don't.” I mumble. He raises his eyebrows, astonished for a moment, and his eyes darken, and he shakes his head in disbelief.
“I’m awed, Harry.” I can tell he is smiling at this.
“Weirdly, I seem to have lost my appetite.” I murmur petulantly.
“Thank you, Gretchen,” Lily says gently, frowning as Mr Potter exits. Gretchen nods, placing the tray on the table, and with another furtive glance at Harry, she leaves.
“Draco, are you drunk?”
“Thoroughly whisked and beaten.” He smirks.
I was so caught up in my head that I didn’t realise I had started struggling to breath and had gone down to the floor. I wrapped my arms around my knees and began to rock while repeating in my head that this was all my fault. I also didn’t hear Draco come back.
“Draco…” I touch his elbow and he turns on with a huge smile.
“Yeah….he’s a little out of my league, Pans.” I say dryly.
I tense. He moves the glass again and leans down, kissing me and depositing a small shard of ice in my mouth with a little wine. He slowly and leisurely trails chilled kisses down the centre of my body, from the base of my throat, down my chest, torso and to my belly. He pops a fragment of ice in my navel in a pool of cool, cold wine. It burns all the way down to the depths of my belly. Wow.
“So what did you do last night?” I ask. She cocks her head at me and raises her eyebrows in a what-do-you-think-stupid look.
“Yes, they do have a certain resemblance to your partner.” She chuckles, obviously speaking about the hair. “What’s his name?” She smiles at Leo.
“Greg…..oh.” My sigh is exasperated. He’s not going to let this go. “Harry Potter.” I cannot help the annoyance in my voice. But it does the trick. Greg’s mouth falls open, and he gaps at me, struck dumb. Humph - even his
“Has she got a name? No sorry, that’s for you and Ron…” I go to pull away a bit but she grabs me again.
“I’m not a bloody hippogriff, I can't possibly eat all this food.” My eyes track all the plates on the table and feel almost sick even thinking about it.
Failure to comply with any of the above will result in immediate punishment, the nature of which shall be determined by the Dominant.
*Are you home safe?*
“Would you like to come and have a drink? They’ve set a marquee up outside.”
I frown at that.
“Thank you, that was sweet of you. I’m feeling better now but I’m still going to take it just in case.” I smile at him and sit down next to him.
“I’m sorry I scared you Dray. I didn’t know how unready I was for going to the Manor. I should have told you, I’m sorry.” He looks down at me then and frowns.
“Who, Blaise?”
“Tell me.”
“Draco… I kind of want to tell people. Can we at least tell Ron? It's not fair he doesn’t know. And you can tell pansy and Blaise if you want.”
“Got here early so I could help cook. Mollys teaching me all her recipes.” She says with a genuine smile. “Rons out back I think, but I’m not certain.”
“That’s a lovely sound,” he murmurs.
“You think I’m gonna let you stay anywhere but here for at least the next week?” He chuckles at me and sniffs. We are still wrapped around each other and Draco’s crying into my shoulder.
“We don't have an arrangement yet.”
“I was drafted. She’s not well.” I say in a weak voice and sounding apologetic.
Quickly, he clambers out of the bath, giving me my first full glimpse of the Adonis, divinely formed, that is Harry Potter. His erection is tame but still substantial….wow. He wraps a small towel around his waist, and holds one out for me. Climbing out of the bath, I take his proffered hand. He wraps the towel around my waist, pulls me into his arms, and kisses me hard, pushing his tongue into my mouth. I long to reach around and embrace him…..touch him…..but he has my arms trapped. I’m soon lost in the kiss. He cradles my head, his tongue exploring my mouth, and I get a sense he’s expressing his gratitude - maybe - for my first blow job? Wow.
“A boy!” He stops kissing me and has the most brilliant smile on his face. He wipes his tears and wraps his arms around me, which I copy.
“Would you like to join us, Mr Potter?” Severus asks.
“She must still be in the barn. Have you got the card?” Draco asks me before unlocking the door.
Food - I am not eating food from a prescribed list. The food list goes or I do - deal breaker.
“Her name is Cassie, and like I said it’s important so I need to be there.” He looks kind of apologetic but I’m still pissed.
“Yeah!” I practically shout at him. “Sorry, I mean yes. That sounds like a lovely idea.” We are both smiling at each other now and we share a long slow kiss before we apparate out.
“So, you’ve charmed my godfather as well?”
“I love it! It’s brilliant! Thanks so much.” He cheers up instantly and looks around some more.
“I’ll drop a bag off later. Bye Teddy! Have a nice time.”
“Nia what have I told you? You should always have your wand on you.”
“This is Blaise Zabini, our photographer.” I tell Potter then, turning to Blaise and grinning at him. He smiles back affectionately and then his whole face shuts down when he looks at Potter.
“Good morning, Draco. How are you feeling?”
“Fine, leave me again. If you need me I’ll be at OUR house.” I retort back and stomp off to the bathroom. I thought maybe he would come after me or wait for me but when I came out of the bathroom 10 minutes later, ready for the day, he’s gone. I put it to the back of my mind and apparate to the new house. I’m only there for a couple of hours though as I can't really concentrate. It hasn’t distracted me like I thought it would. Maybe Teddy can distract me. I go over to the floo but don’t know whether it's usable. Oh well better try it, might have to add it to the things that need fixing.  I throw some powder in and say andromeda’s address and stick my head in with my eyes closed, hoping my head doesn’t go up in flames or get chopped off.
“He is just being nice.” I tell her but then I think about it and what I know of Harry Potter, is that he isn’t nice. Polite, maybe. What if Pansy is right? I mean he did say that he was glad Pansy didn't do the interview. I bit my lip and hug myself, considering the possibility that he might actually like me.
“How did the scan go?” Nia says excitedly, coming down the stairs.
“I’m going to take you from behind, Draco.” he murmurs, and with his other hand, he grasps my hair in a fist and pulls gently, holding me in place. I cannot move my head. I am pinioned beneath him, helpless.
“Sort of.” His voice is wary. He frowns for a moment and seems to be engaged in some internal struggle. Then he glances up, a decision made. “One of my mother’s friends seduced me when I was fifteen.”
He’s so passionate, mesmerising. This is obviously his obsession, the way he is….I can’t take my eyes off him. He really, really wants this. He stops talking and gazes at me.
“Thank you guy, these are amazing.” I say to everyone and wrap my arm around Draco.
P.S. I work for a living, too.
“How was the holiday anyway.” I ask them both. Ron was very red and sunburnt. He looked in a lot of pain actually. Hermione had tanned very well but she probably put sun cream on unlike Ron.
“Night Harry. Love you.” He says and kisses me slowly.
“Yes.”
Harry Potter
CEO, Potter Enterprises Holding, Inc.
Hermione answers straight away and her face lights up at seeing Leo. Then she starts to cry and calls for Ron. He comes running in out of breath.
“Harry, why is it that when I told my mother I was pregnant this morning, that she didn’t act all that surprised?” Shit! “You see, when I asked her about it she said she already knew. And when I asked her how, she said she could just tell. But I don’t believe that, so would you like to tell me the truth Harry?”
“Get these clothes off and get in my bed, now.” He tells me in a rough voice. I love it when he gets dominant. So, I do as I’m told and get in his bed naked and hard. He joins me straight away and for the next hour or so neither of us can concentrate on anything but each other.
“Okay Hermione, no problem. Love you too. And bring Ron tomorrow.” I shout as she’s swirling through the green flames. It would be nice to say goodbye to him before he went away for 2 weeks and left me with all the casework and his girlfriend's cat.
“How’s the baby shower planning coming?” I ask him. He has his head on my shoulder facing my neck. He chuckles at that and smiles.
“Are you? I’m not sure we’ve concluded anything yet, Mr Malfoy.” he murmurs.
“You are amazing. Thank you.” She hugs him back and then goes on her way.
“Draco, your home is looking lovely!” Hermione says quietly but enthusiastically.
I groan.
“So Nia, what did Harry and Draco get you for your birthday?” Hermione asks her.
“God he really has taken it out on you huh?” Draco said, flipping my hands over and studying them.
“Of course, but you have to sit down and be good.” I tell him.
“Yes.”
We step outside and Harry shakes his head as if to clear his thoughts and gestures for me to go before him in a most gentlemanly manner.
“I think you have that cliché the wrong way around.” I grumble. I am the moth and he is the flame, and I’m going to get burned. I just know it.
I looked at my watch and decide I have plenty of time to tell Nia the good news and continue the house. So I floo to the manor to see if Draco wants to join me.
No activity that involves the direct contact of electrical current (whether alternating or direct), fire, or flames to the body.
Katie does a few spells and takes some notes. Then she smiles at me and says another spell. Suddenly there is this 3D scan sort of thing floating above Draco’s stomach. My hands go slack in Draco’s and I stare in disbelief. Draco opens his eyes because I've let go, and gasps.
“Mr Potter will see you now. Please go through, Mr Malfoy.” Blonde number two says. I stand up on shaky legs, my nerves showing themselves once more, and abandon my glass of water.
“What?”
“It’s a beautiful city,” Luna says a bit louder. “Harry, you should take Draco to Paris,” Luna states firmly. I sink down further, but what comes out of his mouth surprises me.
“Clearly you’re not fine. I thought you said you weren’t ready to get married?” I sit down next to him and see he’s still got the box in his hand.
“Are you nervous?” he asks softly.
Harry heads into the kitchen and picks up his phone, scrolling through some emails, I assume. His mouth presses in a hard line, and he makes a call.
“Well, to ‘chill out’, as you so humanly put it - I sail, I fly (plane and broom), and I indulged in various physical pursuits.” He shifts in his chair. “I’m a very wealthy man, Mr Malfoy, and I have expensive and absorbing hobbies.”
“What do you mean it’s too dangerous?”
“Yes please. I need to get an appointment TODAY.” I couldn’t stress that today enough. “My boyfriend has been being sick for a few weeks now apparently and he’s been very down lately too. He’s always crying which is not like him. I’m very worried. He's not eating and is very stressed.”
May 23 18:04
“I’m so sorry, I forgot my coat.” It’s malfoy. Great, he’s seen my crying like a girl. I’ll never live this one down.
“Are you taking a break now that you’ve finished at Hogwarts?” Mr Potter asks.
They are both from Harry. I fire up the laptop.
“Oh and I also put the swing up on the tree in the front, just like you wanted.” She smiles and then looks startled as Draco hugs her too.
We must have been walking around for 45 minutes at least when we got to our last field. It was surrounded by hedges and the entrance was slightly overgrown. We had to duck and dive to get through, but we made it. This field looked the worst, with grass up to our thighs and trees overgrown. There looked to be some sort of building over the other side, so we trekked over there to take a look. As we were getting close, Draco grabbed my hand and I turned round to see his widened eyes and smile.
“I better get going, I still have my shift at the Hogs Head.”
“It’s okay, I’ll apparate us upstairs and you can tell me what to pack okay?” She nods and I grab her around the waist.
Draco is curled up against my side and I stare from him to Leo. I love these two boys with all my heart and wouldn’t change my life for anything. It’s so perfect I could cry, which I have been doing for the past 2 hours. I gave Leo his bottle about 5 minutes ago and so I place him in the Moses basket next to me and lie down next to Draco. He shifts and squints his eyes open.
He hands me over the catalogue and shows me dark wooden wardrobes, chest of draws, and 2 side tables. They actually look really nice and will suit the dark blue paint.
He was standing next to the floo now so I moved closer.
He leans up on his elbows and stares down at me, green eyes intense.
“But that’s the whole point of family Draco. They are there to support you and help you when life goes wrong.” He looks at me and gives a small smile.
“Of course, love.” I help him lean forward and climb behind him. He instantly leans back and sighs. I kiss his head and stroke his hair back. ‘Nearly there.” I whisper.
“Shhh. It’s okay, we’ll talk in the morning but I don’t want you to give it back. It's our house.” He said while giving me a little smile and another kiss, just as delicate as the last. So I closed my eyes, not being able to keep them open much longer anyway.
“Guess he agrees with that name too.” Draco smiles and we both settle down to sleep.
“Awesome name.” She says and looks at Draco to which he smiles kindly back. “Yes we serve hot food, would you like a couple of menus?” She hands us some menus and we take a seat by the window.
We exit the hotel and head to the nearest alleyway to apparate. He doesn’t speak, doesn’t even mention the outburst of passion in the elevator. Maybe I should say something? Should we even talk about it or should we pretend it didn’t happen? It hardly seems real, my first proper kiss. As I think more about it, I assign it mythical, Arthurian legend, Lost City of Atlantis status. It didn't happen, it didn't exist. I definitely imagined the whole thing. No. I touch my fingers to my lips and they are still swollen from the kiss. It did indeed happen. I want this man desperately and he wanted me.
When we head back up to the towels Hermione and Ron are waiting with cupcakes. One has a candle in it and they start singing happy birthday. Teddy immediately joins in at the top of his lungs and even Draco joins in. He then kisses me and I blow the candle out.
Compromise [
“What did he want?”
“How much do I owe you for these clothes?” I ask him, changing the subject.
“Course she’s ready. So many wrackspurts wouldn't be around if she wasn’t. Infact there are an incredibly high number today. If I was to guess, I would say someone else is pregnant too.” Luna says in her sing song voice with her colourful glasses on. Me and Draco share a quick nervous glance but keep our heads down. Then Ginny rolls her eyes and pushes Luna towards the table.
“Sorry….this was a fucking disaster.” She comes up to me and rubs my arm.
My thoughts and my stomach are in turmoil. My appetite has vanished. I stare at my half-eaten breakfast. I’m just not hungry.
“Oh. Now I’m really confused.”
What can I say that I haven't already?
“Oh my god, he’s so sweet.- ahhhhhh” She screams louder then.
“Until we meet again, Mr Malfoy.” He makes it sound like a challenge. I frown, confused. When will we ever meet again? I take his hand and shake, and feel that same eclectic static from before. Maybe it’s my nerves.
“Come on draco, we just have to have a look around, take some notes and then we can go back to grimmauld and work out which room to sort first. Deal?” I eyed him until he gave in with a sigh.
“You cheeky slytherin!” I say and put him down. Just as he’s about to talk though, I kiss him hard. “I fucking love you!” I say and laugh.
“Ermm yeah sure. It’s not a big deal really. In Hogwarts there are 4 houses. Each house means different things. So say you are sorted into Gryffindor, then it means the hat saw that you were brave, and confident, and daring. Whereas if you were placed in slytherin then the hat saw that you were cunning, and ambitious, and had pride. There is also Ravenclaw, which means you're intelligent, creative, and wise. And lastly is hufflepuff, which means your patient, loyal, and dedicated. The hat looks into your soul and sees which house you belong in. There have been some questionable choices made by the hat, like Hermione. Anyone who looks at her could swear she is Ravenclaw, but deep down when things got real, you saw that she belongs in Gryffindor. But with you it will only be for fun really. You don’t have to do anything you're not comfortable with, Nia.”
“I don’t know.” Draco says, bored and not paying attention properly.
“Well, tell it to me then!” I roll my eyes at him and hold his hand. “Please.”
“Your turn cub.”
“I can’t imagine why.” He pauses and frowns. “So did I after I came back to bed.”
“Yes, hopefully it won't take longer than that. Take care Potter.”
“Remember when he wouldn't even come to these dinners? And now look at him. One of the family.” I look at Ron looking at Draco and Hermione, and smile at him. That really surprised me coming from Ron. He was always supportive towards me and Draco but I think this is the first time he’s called him family. I will definitely be remembering this moment for a long long time.
“I don’t want to turn out like my father.” He says sadly. I know he loved his father but he was too strict with him.
“Who then?”
“Well thank you Teddy, for telling everyone. Yes, it’s true, I’m pregnant. Like Teddy said, if you don’t like it, get out.” Then he sits back and grabs my hand. I smile at him and look around. George stands up then.
“I’m not going anywhere.” I prove my point by getting into bed next to him.
“Draco, I need you supple, strong, and with stamina. Trust me, you need to exercise.”
“Wow, you look beautiful Nia!” I tell her and then Draco turns around and sees her. He gets up and kisses her cheek.
“We're here.” His look is intense, half in shadow and half in the bright light of the street light. Dark knight and white knight, it's a fitting metaphor for Harry. He looks strained. His jaw is clenched and his eyes are tight. He undoes the spell that was keeping me secure and holds my face in his hands. His face is inches from mine.
“Hey, are we doing coffee?” He sounds like the old Blaise. Blaise my friend, not a - what did Harry call him? Suitor. Ugh.
“We’ll see,” he says tightly.
“Good.” He reaches forward and takes my iPod out of the breast pocket, and he puts it by the sink.
“From Hogsmeade at about twenty hundred hours…… no…..standby at grimmauld…..all night.”
“Just give her some time alone. It’s a lot to take in.” He nodded and we both sat down on the window seat and stayed there in silence for a while.
It was not my intention to end up here (and have Draco hate me more than he already does), when I went in search of somewhere for me and Draco to finally live together. You see, I definitely was not moving into the manor. Way too many bad memories there. Draco said grimmauld place was too dark and dank for him. That coming from someone who currently lives where Voldemort had once taken up residents. I guessed Draco still only lives there though for his mother but it’s time for him to start his own life. He hates spending time at grimmauld for some reason. I mean yeah it's still a bit unlivable in some rooms but for the most part it was okay. Me and Ron and Hermione had spent a long time doing it up before we all started jobs, or in Hermione's case went back to school. Even some of the other Weasleys had helped, including George and Charlie. Neville had helped with the garden and Luna had helped with… Well I don’t know what Luna had done really except make my house smell like burnt grass when she went round with her smudge stick, but she was good company for a couple of weeks. I'll miss that place when and if we actually move in here. I have some good memories there, some great end of the war parties were thrown there, and some amazing small get-togethers, I’ll even remember the times after the funerals where we sat hugging on sofas and reliving good memories of the dead. Grimmauld is were i finally broke it off with Ginny after realising i was gay. She understood but it took her a while to really move on and be a best mate again. It’s where me and Draco shared a lot of firsts too. Like our first kiss, after he walked me home a couple of dates into our relationship, and our first argument (inevitable) about which broom was better to fly. It was also home to our first time having sex, a little awkward and painful but perfect none the less. It really will be greatly missed but it's all for a good reason. I mean what better reason than to start our own family and have new memories.
“Yeah, I think I’m going to go have a cup of tea with my mother and go to bed, I’m knackered.” We kiss goodbye and he leaves. Then I take a deep breath and floo to Ron’s.
Pansy knocks gently.
“Not over dinner.”
“Pans.”
“Yes Draco, as a matter of fact I have. I took Teddy to the flower park and fed the ducks and then gave him a bath back at home. Andy was then kind enough to offer me tea and I accepted, then when Teddy went to bed me and andromeda had a couple of drinks. Okay?!” He stared at me for a second and then deflated.
The Dominant shall provide the Submissive with a personal trainer four times a week in hour-long sessions at times to be mutually agreed between the personal trainer and the Submissive. The personal trainer will report to the Dominant on the Submissive’s progress.
“It’s fine Andromeda. Please, let me help.” I tell her and walk towards them. I hold my hands out and she passes me Teddy.
Burning the midnight oil
The first thing I’m teaching Nia is the levitation charm. I've told her what charm to use and I demonstrated for her, now it's her turn.
“Dancing with my beautiful boyfriend, what do you think I’m doing?”
“I have news.” He says and lets me go. He grins and his dark eyes twinkle.
“Here. I don't want you catching a cold.”
“Yes.” I mumble, exasperated.
“I know. He’s so loyal and kind, but also brave and cunning.” He smirks at me. “Shall we put bets on now or…” I laugh at him and smirk back.
“That’s okay, you’ve done well to not freak out till now.” We laugh and head downstairs.
As I’m sitting at the vanity, drying my hair, I see the bed in the mirror and it clicks that I slept with Harry Potter last night! Holy shit! What I would have given to be awake for that, and to watch him sleep…. I shake my head and finish up with the hair dryer.
Does the Submissive consent to be gagged?
“Hello Harry, sorry for just popping in. We’re fine thank you. Teddy just wanted to see how the house is going.” She says and sits down next to Nia, as I take my seat with Teddy on my lap. “Hello Nia darling.” She says quietly. We are all talking in hushed tones as not to wake Draco.
“Well, then,” he looks relieved. “The rest of this stuff is just details.”
I glance at Harry and he is waiting for me to sit down.
When we get there, we both stop and look. It's as big as a garage and the shape of a hexagon. It’s made of light coloured wood and glass panels. It could be really pretty but at the moment you can't see through the glass panels, some of which are missing, the wood looks rotted, and inside looks like a jungle of weeds.
“Where’s your man Harry?” Says George. Good question, where was Draco? He said he was coming. I sit down next to Luna across from George and begin chatting.
“How’s everything?” I ask them.
“I don't know yet. It will depend how my interviews go tomorrow.”
“Thank you Hermione.” I say while giving Draco a look that’s said ‘I told you so’.
Harry Potter
“Babe...come on. Let's go to bed.” I nudge him, but he doesn’t wake up. I sigh and smile at him. Bloody lazy fool. I get up slowly without waking him up and then pick him up gently. He gives a little intake of breath and then huffs it out and wraps his arms around me.
“Not particularly.”
“No. It’s none of their business.” He saunters towards me until he’s standing in front of me.
“A local artist.” Potter says as an explanation.
Not so intractable men
“Thanks for your help Nia.” I tell her as she’s going to get ready for work.
We must have fallen asleep rocking because next thing, Draco is waking me up.
“Not to me.” All humour is gone from his voice and his gaze intensifies. My belly clenches and I have to tear my eyes away from his and look down at my knotted fingers. What the fuck is going on? I really need to get out of here - now. I unknot my fingers and grab the recorder off the table.
Okay maybe a quick shag and then we can discuss the party. What harm can it do? Besides, this is moving too fast for me to start talking about Ron.
“You sound like a control freak.” I say before I can stop myself.
“I’ll see you this evening.” I hang up.
“Are you smirking at me, Mr Potter?”
“I’m sorry uncle Harry. I’ll be careful.” He says and starts rocking again but gently. He looks at the arm with love and strokes it. “It’s very lovely. Was your mummy a nice lady?” Teddy often asks hard questions like this but I don’t mind talking to him because he understands.
I drop my bag on the floor and collapse on the sofa. Then I think of all the studying I have missed today because I was with…..him.
Pansy had said he was dangerous; she’d warned me, and she was right. How did she bloody know?! He’s dangerous to my health, because I know I’m going to say yes. And part of me doesn’t want to. Part of me wants to run screaming from this room and all it represents. I am so out of my depth here.
“Tea?” I ask her.
“I’m so sorry.” He pauses, looking like he's thinking. “Do you get along with your Godfather?”

“DIDN’T SEEM LIKE NOTHING.” He persists. He does not give up easy.
“Did you know, uncle Harry and Draco, that today is the 27th of march?” We both look at each other as if to say ‘where’s this going’.
He lifts me and pulls the quilt and my duvet out from underneath me and places me back down, this time on the sheets.
“Healer Bell said October 21st, but the little cherry could be born before or after.” He places his hand next to mine on his stomach and smiles at it.
“Nope, I wanted it to be a surprise. What time did he arrive?” Hermione says looking at Leo.
My mouth hangs open. Fuck hard! Shit, that sounds so...hot. But why are we looking at a playroom? What the hell is a playroom?
“Draco, I’ve told you. There’s something about you. I can’t leave you alone.” He smiles ironically. “I’m like a moth to a flame.” His voice darkens. “I want you very badly, especially now, when you’re biting your lip again.” He takes a deep breath and swallows.
I’m a ball of sexual tense need. He stares down at me for a moment, measuring my need, then he grabs me suddenly and flips me over. It takes me by surprise, and because my hands are tied, I have to support myself on my elbows. He pushes both my knees up the bed so my arse is in the air, and he slaps me hard. Before I can react, he pushes into me. I cry out - from the slap and from his sudden assault, and I cum instantly, untouched, falling apart beneath him as he continues to slam deliciously into me. He doesn't stop. I’m spent. I can’t take this….and he pounds on and on and on…..and I’m hard again…..can feel another orgasm coming…..surely not…..no…..
We chat for another 10 minutes and then I get up to leave.
him smile.
“But what if Harry?”
“Oh, Draco,” he breathes. “You have the most beautiful skin, pale and flawless. I want to kiss every single inch of it.”
I have hoodwinked Pansy Parkinson. A first. She hands me my tea.
“You don’t have to do all that Harry.” He said hunching his shoulder and looking down, “I’m sorry I’m being such a pain.” He started walking towards one of the rooms but was soon stopped by my hand.
May 23 17:59
“Ahhhhh.” He yells while pushing and gripping my hand. I try to be as supportive as I can and shush him while stroking his hair with my free hand.
“Help yourself to food, Draco.”
When we were both out of breath and both our faces hurt from laughing, we lay down next to each other. We were both covered in paint from head to toe but we didn’t care. We had had so much fun today, just spending time together.
Sunday comes and word got out that the baby had arrived. Everyone left us alone like we asked but sent cards and gift baskets to say congratulations. Today we are going to Andy’s first and Narcissa is meeting us there. Then we are going to the burrow. We are even going to see Hagrid, but not till next week.
Excuse me?
“Well here we are. It was good to see you Mr Potter, you should come visit more often.”
“Excuse me.” I go to the kitchen and lean on one of the counters, not checking the number.
Little Miss Pigtails returns, all coy glances and swaying hips, with our entrées: beef wellington, I think. Fortunately, she gives us our plates and then leaves, although she lingers handing Harry his. He looks quizzically at me as I watch her close the dining room door.
“Would you like to go?”
“Put me down you oaf!” He shouted in between bouts of laughter.
This chapter carries on from chapter 2. Ive put it up early because I’m flying through these chapters and thought it would be a nice surprise. I promise the chapter get longer by the way. Hope you like it. X
“Sounds great.”
“Well we don’t want her there so she kind of is. Do you know what this reminds me of?” He asks me and then carries on without expecting an answer. “That time you had to look after that bloody cat of Hermione’s! Now that was a pest.” He’s laughing now and I think back to that 2 weeks I had crookshanks. I could have killed that bloody cat.
We go through the kitchen and open the patio doors. I hadn’t done much to the back garden yet and was waiting till I did the stables. But as we step out, my breath leaves me.
“Sev, we have half an hour. Would you like some tea? And you can tell me how your potions store is going.”
“It doesn’t matter now Hermione. I’m here and you need to push. You can do this,you are Hermione Jean Granger!” She nods with me and starts pushing.
The next day Neville and Hannah come to visit. This time I know it’s not for Draco. He’s come to check on the plants. When he turns up I’m in the middle of teaching Nia.
“Would you like tea, coffee, or water?” She asks nervously and turns all her attention on me. Both the guy and girl are now starting at me and I glance between them.
“We always argued before.” I shrug. “Plus we have only argued like twice in nearly a week. I’d call that a record.” I wink at him and he chuckles weakly. I wipe his face and kiss him.
“Sorry, I thought everything was in there. My shoes aren't in there are they? They’ve disappeared.” I say sarcastically and head for the stairs.
Draco Malfoy
“Look at him!” one of the girls beside me hisses enthusiastically to her friend.
“No.” I mutter truthfully. I already knew that about myself anyway.
“Don’t worry Harry, I can help. I’m pretty sure grimmauld looked worse.” We both laugh at that and head inside.
He moves forward. instinctively,I move back until I feel the bed against the back of my knees. He drops his towel, but I can’t take my eyes off his face. His expression is ardent, full of desire.
I have never left the UK. Pansy is off to Barbados with her parents and her brother, Ethan, for two whole weeks. I’ll be Pansyless in our new apartment. That will be weird. Ethan has been travelling the world since he graduated last year. I wonder briefly if I’ll see him before they go on holiday. He’s such a lovely guy. The floo rings, jolting me from my reverie.
“What happened to the fifteen?” I blurt out.
“But I want more.” I whisper.
What? Shit! Pansy was murmuring something about this yesterday.
“What, like Scorpius?” Draco pulls a face at the name. Everyone laughs, including Ginny.
“Congratulations!” She says and puts the baby on Draco’s chest. He’s crying again now but tears of joy. And just seeing them two makes me start welling up.
Issues
After a couple minutes silence and me on my side staring, he looks at me.
“There’s an elf here with a delivery for you. You have to sign for it.”
“I LOVE THIS SONG!” I shouted to nobody. I had finished that last glass and was getting a bit unsteady on my feet so I turned around to sit down and that’s when I saw him. He looked a bit ruffled and red in the cheeks as if he’d run here. I dropped my glass and it shattered everywhere. This was so embarrassing, I was pissed as a fart with no pants on and dancing around my living room. I instantly turned the wireless off and the silence was eerie.
“Good evening, Draco.” His voice is cool, his expression completely guarded and unreadable. The capacity to speak deserts me. Damn Pansy for letting him in here with no warning. Vaguely, I’m aware that I’m still in my joggers, unshowered, yucky, and he’s just gloriously yummy, his pants doing that hanging from the hips thing, and what’s more, he’s here in my bedroom.
I open the door for him and stare down at the floor. This is the first time I have ever had sex in my home, and as sex goes, I think it was pretty damn fine. But now I feel like a receptacle - an empty vessel to be filled at his whim. Harry stops in the doorway and clasps my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his. His brow creases.
“Well, we can start with: How was last night for you?” His eyes burn, filled with curiosity. He’s anxious to know. Wow.
“Phew it works. Hey little cub. Is your grandma in? Can I come through?” I ask even though I know Teddy wouldn't be in the house alone.
His grin widens, and leaning down, he undoes the tie. The woven pattern has made an indentation around my wrists. It’s….sexy. He gazes at me. He’s amused, his eyes dancing with mirth. He kisses my forehead quickly and beams at me.
“Let’s go.” The park is in walking distance so we decide to walk today, mainly so Draco doesn’t throw up in a bush if we apparate there. Teddy is happily talking our ears off the whole way there and we just listen best we can and talk when he lets us. About half way there he decides to swap hands and now he can hold both our hands and be in the middle. I look down at him and his blonde hair and then at Draco and his blonde hair, and smile. This is what having our own will look like and it looks and feels great. Draco sees me staring and clicks on to why, he smiles back happily. This will be us very soon with our own, and we couldn’t be happier.
“Draco, you could be wearing a sack and you’d look lovely. Please don’t worry. I’d like you to meet my mother. Get dressed. I’ll just go and calm her down.” His mouth presses into a hard line. “I will expect you in that room in five minutes, otherwise I’ll come and drag you out of here myself in whatever you’re wearing. My t-shirts are in this drawer. My shirts are in the closet. Help yourself.” He eyes me speculatively for a moment, then leaves the room.
“I’m going to move, baby.” he breathes after a moment, his voice tight.
“Hey cub!” I kiss his head.
“But instead he turns up here.”
“Yeah, sorry. I got out early and decided to come straight over.” She looked apologetic and shy.
“Hey! Where do you think you’re sneaking off to?” I say while yawning. Why’s he trying to sneak out like the morning after our first time.
“Stop with the bullshit Hermione. Draco is over there nearly in tears, refusing to come near the house and thinking you hate him!” That last bit got a reaction out of her. Finally. I don’t like shouting at Hermione but i am not in the mood for this right now. Her eyebrows shot up and she opened her mouth to mimic an o.
He chuckles. “It’s recently become my favourite.”
“Draco, wake up.” Harry’s voice is soft, cajoling.
“You are doing amazing my love! Keep going.” Then my phone rings but I leave it until Draco’s comfy again. Then it’s gone off but I ring back.
Do you guys prefer the emails in the middle of to the side? I can't decide which reads better.
“Okay, Mr Malfoy, another point well made. How about an hour on three days and one day half an hour?”
“Please, Harry.” I whisper.
“He’s understanding. Part of me doesn't want to go, but it’s tempting to lie in the sun for a couple of weeks. Besides, mum is hanging in there, thinking this will be our last family holiday before Ethan and I head off into the world of paid employment.”
15.19: Touching myself without your permission. I feel like this may be a problem.
Draco Malfoy
“So, are you going for a joint baby shower as well then?” Molly asks.
“Bye mum, bye dad.” I say and turn to go.
“Well you didn’t have to track me down through my wand and act like a creepy stalker.” I turn and snap at him. He stares at me and seems surprised, maybe even a little wounded. Maybe that was too far.
“Nia? What’s your favourite colours?” I ask her while she’s distracted.
“I don't want you to go.”
“It’s good to know that you can be amenable. Now, where were we?”
“Uncle Harry! Uncle Draco!” Teddy jumps on me and I pick him up.
“Where is your fiancé Miss Granger?”
“Harry, is everything okay? Draco walked off and he looked like he was crying.” He rings his hands nervously and looks worried.
My legs are suddenly unsteady as I turn to get a glass. I’m so glad I wore my best jeans today. I turn back around to start pouring the beer and glance at him. Merlin, he’s so handsome. As it is slowly pouring into the glass I think. Why the hell is he here? In Scotland! Then a part of my brain says, he’s here to see you! And I almost drop the glass. No way! I dismiss this idea immediately. Why would a beautiful, powerful, smart man want to see me? It is ridiculous and I get rid of the thought.
“Appalled?”
“Yes. I would like to spend some time here.” He says but he isn’t looking at the library or the shelf’s or even the book in his hand, he is looking at me and is smiling. I smile back and then clear my throat.
It’s so big and still growing. His erection is above the water line, the water lapping at his hips. I glance up at him and come face-to-face with his wicked grin. He’s enjoying my astonished expression. I realise that I'm staring. I swallow. That was inside me! It doesn't seem possible. He wants me to touch him. Hmmm...okay, bring it on.
I shake my head and roll my eyes at myself. Get a grip, Malfoy. I look around and try to figure out how old this guy is. The building is clinical and modern so I’m guessing Potter is in his forties and that he’s fit, tanned, and fair haired, like most of his employees.
Katie comes back in after a minute. She smiles at us and sits back down.
“We have a son.” I repeat Draco’s words. I kiss Leo’s head and my tears drop into his hair. Which I then get a look at and start laughing. “He has your hair.” I turn my watery smile to draco and leans against my other arm. We stay there for a while just enjoying the moment.
“Nia? We are so sorry, we didn’t mean to upset you.” I say calmly and touch her shoulder.
He smiles sardonically.
I awkwardly hug him while holding the wrapped broom behind my back.
He starts crying again and I hush him. Then he goes back to sleep and I place him in his Moses basket next to the chair. I put my head in my hands and try breathing more slowly. Why is Malfoy here?! What if he harms Teddy or Andromeda? Or tries to kill me again?
“So remember every 5 minutes, lasting 1 minute each, for over an hour. Got it? Keep him hydrated and comfortable. Male labours tend to last a while. Oh and try to get food down him if you can but don’t worry.” I nod to all this and then head back upstairs to the cupboard for fresh sheets. As I’m shutting the door, Nia comes down the stairs rubbing her eyes.
“Draco went into labour at 10 to 5 in the morning and then he was born at 10:24 last night.” I tell them and hold Leo up higher.
“No, you don’t, you’re just saying that to avoid me. You’re always avoiding me.”
He sits on the end of the bed, close enough for me to touch him.
We have been really good friends all through Hogwarts, but I know that Blaise likes me way more. He’s cute and funny, but he's more like the brother I never had. Pansy is always teasing me about it, and the fact that I’ve never had a boyfriend really. But I just haven’t found anyone who…. well, who I’m attracted to, even though part of me longs for the kind of butterflies-in-my-belly moments.
When he is finished explaining everything that Harry has probably told him he has to, he huffs again, makes me sign a delivery note and then apparates out without even a bye. I want to laugh. Pansy whistles, impressed when she sees it.
I’m just about to start the conversation about it, when Molly calls that tea is ready. We all get seated and Draco starts telling everyone that he just beat Ron at wizards chess. They don’t believe him at first but then Ron sticks up for him and confirms it. Molly and Hermione are shocked that someone beat Ron at last, Ginny is shouting loser at Ron across the table and Luna is just staring at Draco.
If I’d not met him, I’d still be sweetly and blissfully oblivious. My mind drifts to last night and this morning….and the incredible, sensual sexuality I’d experienced. Do I want to say goodbye to that? No! Screams my subconscious.
“Draco, stop this. Hermione doesn’t hate you. And you're not to blame for things your aunt did, it wasn’t you. There’s obviously been a mix up or something, i'll just phone her and ask her what the hell happened.” As I grabbed my phone out of my pocket it starts ringing. I answer and it’s Hermione asking how things are.
” he breathes in my ear. I whimper, exhausted, pulling against my restraint. I’m helpless, lost in an erotic torment.
“Oh right yeah, sun cream.” Hermione passes him soon and he lathers himself in it and lies back down.
“Do you know what that means?” He asks in a sing-song voice.
“Oh, Draco Malfoy, what am I going to do with you?” His lips quirk into a half smile.
I flick through the TV channels, but deep down I know I’m procrastinating. Burning a bright red hole in the side of my bag is that contract. Do I have the strength and the wherewithal to read it tonight?
“What’s this about?” She tries to get up but Draco whispers the sticking spell so she’s stuck to the chair, and I whisper a muffliato charm so nobody can hear us. “Hey! What is this?!” She says clearly frightened. She shouldn't be frightened, it’s just a sticking charm, any witch or wizard knows it.
3 years ago
“You’ll find out if you get a move on.” He says as he’s going through the door. I get up and shut the door behind me. Then I put spells up to keep Nia away in case she decides to drop by.
“I’m sorry.” I say pitifully and wipe my mouth with his soft handkerchief.
“Get out of here.” He says and throws the loo roll at me. I chuckle and roll it back to him.
“Albus! For Harry and Draco.” Ginny shouts.
“Where did you sleep last night?” I turn to look at him.
“Harry. You use sex as a weapon. It really isn’t fair.” I whisper, staring down at my plate, and then looking directly at him. He raises his eyebrows, surprised, and I see he’s considering my words. He strokes his chin thoughtfully.
He raises his eyebrows and flushes slightly, if I’m not mistaken. Ha.
“Yes, sir.” I say as I’m packing my things away. I look up and his eyes narrow. “Thank you for the interview Mr Potter.”
McGonagall shakes Harry’s hand, and there is a swell of polite applause. My heart’s pumping in my throat. He approaches the lectern and surveys the hall. He looks so confident standing in front of us all, as Pansy did before him. The two girls beside me lean in, enraptured. In fact, I think most of the female members of the audience inch closer and a few of the men. He begins, his voice soft, measured, and mesmerising.
“Yes well that’s my boyfriend, brave and stupid.” He glares at me and smirks a bit.
Finally, an easy question, away from all the double-talk.
“Oh no.”
“Right mother, we are going now. I will see you in a couple of days.” Draco says and gets up slowly. Narcissa gets up two and goes over to Draco and gives him a long gentle hug.
“Okay.” I answer softly. If I go, that’s it. The thought is surprisingly painful, but I steel myself and keep my mask up.
“We had other things on our mind yesterday Hermione.” Draco says and shows her the moving image.
Harry Potter
“Oh?” I have his full attention.
“I wouldn't have missed it for the world, Draco. You make me very proud.”
May 23 18:06
“Of course sirs, of course. Come in.”
“Do you know which potion is for morning sickness?” I ask him while still looking at the bottles, trying to identify anything.
“Harry, with all due respect….” My voice fades. I can’t ask you. I’ll get your biased, kinky-as-hell, distorted worldview regarding sex. I want an impartial opinion. “It’s just about mechanics. I won’t mention the Red Room of Pain.”
“Fuck.” He says through breaths. I open my eyes and look at him. He looks beautiful like this and a certain word comes to mind but i can’t say that yet. It would freak him out and possibly me too. I relax back into the after sex haze. I slip my arm under his head and bring it on my shoulder. I kiss the top of his head and pull a blanket over us after using a scourgify spell on us.
Her theme is “what next after Hogwarts?” Oh, what next indeed. Harry is watching Pansy, his eyebrows raised - in surprise, I think. Yes, it could have been Pansy who went to interview him. And it could have been Pansy who he was now making indecent proposals to. Beautiful Pansy and beautiful Harry together. I could be like the two girls beside me, admiring from afar. I know Pansy wouldn't have given him the time of day. What did she call him the other day? Creepy. The thought of a confrontation between Pansy and Harry makes me uncomfortable. I have to say I don't know which of them I would put my money on.
“I meant it as a joke.” I whimper.
I remember that I’ve got to go pick up a box that I forgot and the last of the mail from grimmauld place. I decide not to leave Luna here though.
Food:
“Really? Well.” He reaches for one. “All you do is tip and swallow. I think you can manage that.” He gazes at me, and I know what he’s referring to. I blush scarlet, my mask not accounting for blushing - I just can’t help that. He grins at me, squirts some lemon juice onto the oyster, and then tips it into his mouth.
As we are walking to the cafe, Nia and Teddy are ahead of us chatting and chasing each other, and me and Draco are strolling behind holding hands. For a second I imagine us older and Nia and Teddy as our children. One of which is still growing inside Draco. Life is good. I smile at Draco and lean over to kiss him sweetly. In this moment life is definitely good and I am very happy.
He groans.
“Obviously.” Sarcasm drips from my voice, and I roll my eyes internally.
“What happened?” She asks professionally but a bit frantic.
“It's all my fault, it’s all my fault.” I repeat to him, barely even recognising he's there while crying and struggling to breath.
“Theo is in construction, magical building not muggle, and my little sister is currently in Paris, looking for one magical creature or another with some grandson of Newt Scamander.” His eyes cloud with irritation. Either he doesn’t like her being there, or he doesn’t like talking about his family. Is it because he’s adopted?
Origin: 1580-90; submiss + -i've
“Sleep, sweet Draco.” he murmurs, and I close my eyes, but I can’t help feel residual melancholy either from the music or his demeanour. Harry Potter has a sad side.
I’m coming back up the stairs with both our breakfasts 20 minutes later when I hear Draco in the bathroom throwing up. I rush to the bedroom to put down the breakfast tray and then practically run to the bathroom. By the time I get there though Draco is at the sink washing his mouth out.
“Oh…..please.” I beg, and I pull my head back, my mouth open as I groan, my legs stiffening. Holy fuck.
“Bit of a foregone conclusion, wasn’t I?”
“I’m coming in.” I tell him softly and open the door. When I see him, I have a quick flash back to the time he was crying in moaning myrtle's bathroom. I quickly clear that from my head though because the Draco now looks a mess and needs my help. He is leaning over the sink with the tap running and has clearly splashed his face a few times. His eyes are red rimmed and even through the wetness on his face, I can see the tears falling.
“I’ve never had one.” Ever.
I pace around the school and then head through the gates and along the road to Hogsmeade.
A tremor runs through my whole body. I am naked in a bath with Harry Potter. If someone had told me I’d be doing this when I woke up in his hotel suite yesterday, I would not have believed them.
“Very.” he says with an intense look, and I don’t think he’s referring to food.
“I’m sorry. It's just, well, all your symptoms point to pregnancy Mr Malfoy.” Okay what did she just say? My mouth is hanging open and I don’t know what to do.
“Mrs Potter, please.”
He puts everything back down and I swallow and try to stop the blush from spreading again. It doesn’t work and so I look down instead.
“Why? Ginny said it this morning when she spilled her cup of tea.” He says confirming my suspicions.
“Where in Scotland?”
I carry my broom until I get onto an open bit of grass and then I climb on and cast a protector on my hair. After that, I’m in the air and it doesn't take me long to get there. I arrive at the hotel at precisely six fifty-eight and head inside. I shrink my broom and place it in my pocket.
Pansy is skipping around the kitchen when I stagger in.
“No! She’s going to tell me cherry’s dead! I know she is, because that’s what I deserve!” Draco has gone backwards with his progress of blaming himself since the pregnancy and it’s starting to worry me.
“Spend the night with me.”
Personal safety:
“It’s not your fault Katie, thank you.”
“No Draco, it's fine really. I just didn’t want to keep shouting was all.” He looks relieved at this and I tell him what happened and about Tonks. He listens to every word and understands because he knows Teddy and he knows of Tonks.. and he knows about how hard the war was. After that we decide to get into the game and both mount our brooms once more. I realise the snitch and off we go.
“So where is it?”
“The sooner I have your submission the better, and we can stop all this.” he murmurs.
“Draco, come on. Don’t stress about it. Hermione’s clever enough to not tell him until she asks us.” He turned around and glared at me.
“IT WAS NOTHING.”
We all stand. Pansy and Theo follow Mr Potter and Luna out of the room. I go to follow, but Harry clutches my elbow, bringing me to an abrupt halt.
I grab my clothes from yesterday, the ones still remaining anyway, and shrink them and put them in my pocket. I find my jacket back in the main room and find a bobble to tie my hair up in a bun with. Harry is watching me as I tie it up, his eyes following me while he is on the phone. I don’t listen to his conversation, I couldn’t understand it even if I did, and instead flick through my phone waiting.
As we stroll through Hogsmeade to the coffee shop, I slip my arm through Blaise’s. I’m so grateful for him….. Normality. Someone I know and understand.
“Draco interviews me for the student paper at Hogwarts because I’m conferring the degrees there this week.”
“He has helped me cook and clean and babysat Teddy. He is great with him. He’s helped me with the funerals and he has been a shoulder to cry on when nobody else has been here!” She says angrily now. Andy hardly ever gets angry and never at me. “He has been very nice and a big help. He has changed since your school days, so you both just need to grow up.” She finishes and huffs.
I get to the bedroom with his glass of water and my plain water. I open the door and Draco is flat on the bed asleep. It looks like he has just fallen face first into the pillows and stayed there. I put our waters down on our different sides of the bed and sit down on the bed to take my shoes off.
“Awed?” He asks sarcastically, acting his age once more.
We sit staring at each other a moment, food totally forgotten.
Hold on, I was meant to be the one interviewing him, not the other way around. His eyes burn into me and I feel compelled to tell the truth.
I shut up.
“I went hiking with Theo.” His thumb strokes my knuckles, back and forth, and my heart skips a beat. My breathing speeds up and I feel hot. How does he do this to me? He is only touching my hand, yet the sparks are flying throughout my body and causing my hormones to go mad.
“I don’t care about that, I like muggles - and love the things they come up with - and you shouldn’t go around spouting that crap.” I turn away from him and continue to focus on my magic where it’s cleaning glasses and placing them back on shelves.
“Understood, standing by, over and out.” Weasley communicates back, through our headset spell.
I look around and it’s like we landed in a war zone. There were kids running around, babies crying, Molly shouting, Ron and Ginny fighting, and Arthur was messing with the volume of the new muggle tv I got him for Christmas. Same old same old then. It was like this at every family dinner, especially if EVERYONE was invited.
“Hi, Theo.” I smile at him. I am aware I am biting my lip.
“You better get over here now.” I tell her and put the phone down. I hear a distinct POP of apparation then. I turned around to see Hermione stood by the front door.
“Good thank you mother, tired but good.” She kisses Draco and me on the cheeks and then looks at Leo. “Would you like to hold your grandson, mother?” Draco asks her. She looks at him and then me, practically pleading with her eyes. I smile and offer her the baby. She sits down with him and Draco sits next to her. I sit on the other sofa with Andy. As we are saying hello, Teddy pops his head around from the back of the armchair.
“I won't be a minute, I'll just run upstairs and get my broom.” I tell him and run upstairs.
Mr Malfoy,
“There’s more.” He says and Andy waves her wand. Next thing there is a pram to match the changing bag.
The following morning we get up early and have breakfast. We want to get to the house before Nia does and then we can give her a key.
“I'm really not hungry, Harry.” I am reeling from your disclosure.
“It was an...interesting evening. I won’t forget it any time soon.”
“Do you wanna sleep at grimmauld tonight with me and uncle Draco?” He shoots awake at that and grins.
“You fucking liar!” Then he rushes off through the house.
We arrived at mine after not too long and I opened the door for him to go inside. I walked in after him and put down the umbrella which was dripping all over the floor. Note to self -don’t forget to clean that before I fall over it in the morning. As I was putting that down, Draco must have mumbled a spell because suddenly I was dry. Turning around to inspect Draco, so was he.
“Oh my god! I’m going to kill him. Ahhhh.”
“Big?”
“Ermm, Mr Potter, this ermm...really— look, Weasley doesn’t have to do that.” I quickly glance at Weasley and he is remaining stoically impassive. “I’m sure they can manage.” I all but whisper.
“You want dessert?” he snorts.
I open it and find a half leather box with three seemingly identical old cloth-covered books. They are in mint condition and there is a card. The writing is neat and tidy and reads:
“Hey Neville. I was just wondering when we can get started on this greenhouse?”
“This conversation is not over,” he whispers threateningly as we enter the dining room.
“We don’t have time for that.” I shout through the closing bathroom door.
“OMG! Wow, it’s a baby!” She says joyfully. She stares at him until I give her the go ahead.
“It's okay babe. I will call st Mungos as soon as I’ve got you in bed and get you an appointment today. Even if it means using my ‘boy who lived’ status. I’ll do that for you.”
“Yes.” He smiles his dazzling head-cocked-to-one-side smile, and my stomach pole vaults over my spleen. I can’t help but reflect his glorious smile back at him.
“I really am sorry Harry, and I didn’t text or call or anything because I kind of lost track of time and I’d thought I’d have been done well before 5.” He looked at me with big eyes while ringing his hands. Dammit how could I not forgive him when he looked at me like that, and he did have a genuine reason for running late.
“Yeah mate, you can go after and show them their grandson.” Ron says sadly. Hermione had told me that they had taken Rosie to Fred’s grave and Ron had cried his eyes out. I sling my arm around Ron’s waist and pull him closer.
“In London?” I’m confused and my brain isn't working.
“Draco. My name’s Draco.” I mutter at him. “What can I get you, Mr Potter?” He smiles that inside joke smile again and I take a breath. I can do this.
“Yes I’d like that.” She says politely.
“It iz beautiful.” Fleur says in her French accent.
The next day after Nia’s lesson I ring the window guy. He says he will come tomorrow and measure up, then he can fit them next Thursday. I give Draco the catalogue for the furniture, because he’s better with that stuff.  And I ordered some paint. Then I floo call Neville.
I nod, as if in agreement. Inwardly, I pine. Oh, Pansy….I wish I could tell you everything, everything about this strange, sad, kinky guy, and you could tell me to forget about him. Stop me from being a fool.
He gazes at me and then nods.
“That is it Ronald! I have told you not to say that to me! I’m going home.” She turns to leave but I grab her arm.
“Okay, open your eyes.” Draco tells her. She opens them and gapes. She doesn’t say anything and just shoves the door open. She looks around and falls to her knees. Me and Draco stand there in shock and then we hear her crying and we move around her. I kneel next to her and Draco stays standing (partly because he would struggle getting up).
“Yeah,” I agreed. “Take out for tea?” I said after a minute, because I know neither of us can be bothered cooking.
I thank him and head to the elevator with my ‘visitor pass’. I smirk a bit at that because I’m sure it's obvious that I don’t belong here, without printing it in large on a security pass. I’m wearing converse for god's sake and everyone else is in suits and heels and dressed professionally. Even the security are dressed in black suits, I notice as I pass them on my way to the elevator.
I do not want or need a laptop indefinitely.
Harry’s softly spoken question haunts me. Shaking my head and endeavouring to quell my nerves, I decide on the plum-coloured shirt for this evening, with black jeans and a black tie to match. It’s demure and vaguely businesslike - after all, I am negotiating a contract.
“chéri is a boy.” I tell him while laughing and crying. He grabs my face and kisses me. Everyone is cheering but we are in our own bubble, just me, Draco, and our baby boy.
