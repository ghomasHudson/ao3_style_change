He contemplates opening a dialogue, but knows that Draco—like him—isn’t the type to suffer idle chit-chat, and without anything else but the obvious to speak about (which, neither of them seem willing to broach) Severus doesn’t see a way out of the excruciating awkwardness of silence.
‘Shocking, I know,’ says Malfoy dryly, and he turns, those cool blue eyes landing unmistakenly on Colin.
Ginny grins. ‘None taken. He’s an idiot,’ she says. She glances sideways at Harry and slings an arm around his shoulders. ‘Cheer up,’ she says. ‘He’ll come around.’
After all, the rivalry between Slytherin and the other houses had already eased up. If it stops completely, Slytherins might actually start to get treated like everyone else; and if we get treated like the other houses, if they start being seen as just
Longbottom nods. ‘I ran into him on my way back to the tower. Sorry, I meant to tell you but I was worried about getting back before curfew, and you didn’t get back to the dorm until late anyway…’
He’s staring at Malfoy, green eyes wide behind his glasses. He blinks once, twice, and suddenly his gaze clears.
Without meaning to, Pansy glances sideways. Draco, several seats down and across the table, is watching Potter. His face is carefully blank, but he’s gripping his mug so hard his knuckles are white and Pansy half expects the cup to break beneath that grip in a dramatic shower of porcelain.
Despite the seriousness of the moment, and the still too-heavy atmosphere in the castle, Luna giggles.
Harry laughs. There’s something so easy and warm in it—though Draco’s words are obnoxious and not at all funny—and Draco relishes in the sound. The laughter that is his, that someone as pure and good as Harry has given him.
He turns suddenly. ‘What’s wrong? What’s wrong is I just got dumped, okay? Except, we weren’t ever really together, were we? So I wasn’t actually dumped I was just…rejected.’
Just before the darkness swoops in, he hears Potter make a soft noice of contentment. A hand slips into his and then, warmth spreading through him, Draco is asleep.
She keeps her footsteps light, careful to avoid any disgusting pitfalls on the floor, and reaches out to tug on the loose strands of hair as she sidles up next to him. Draco jerks, a satisfying flash of outrage and anger flashing across his face, that melts into a mild irritation the minute he realises it’s her.
Potter is pale. Except it’s not a pale like Draco is pale, but a ghostly, sickly pale, his skin tinged in grey. Shadows carve deep grooves under his eyes, his cheeks gaunt and hollowed, as if—and Draco’s gut clenches—all the life has been sucked out of him.
Potter turns sharply, pulling out of Malfoy’s grip with a scowl, his fists clenched. Phineas sighs, and gets ready to alert a teacher to an impending fight.
Malfoy runs a hand through his hair, dislodging the normally pristine style he has it in, and sighs. He looks around the corridor and frowns.
Parvati is watching her, her face creased in concern. Her gaze shifts over Lavender’s shoulder, her frown shifting to annoyance and distrust, and Lavender glances back just as Harry touches her arm.
There was one photo that Colin took that showed him the potential he had to be a great photographer. A small antelope, caught in the gaze of a hunting Leopard. The antelope froze, though it had plenty of room to run. Plenty of places to hide. Yet it was as if it was trapped. Trapped by the gaze of the predator in it’s sights.
Harry flings out another hex to land harmlessly against Albus’ shield, ‘—did this to him! You shouldn’t even be here! You shouldn’t even be near him!’
Ron startles. Once again, he’s forgotten Dean is there. The boy stands over by the door, looking extremely uncomfortable with being there. Still, he stares at Ron in incredulity.
She inhales deeply, measuring her feeling slowly, controlling the sharp burst of worry that burns through her when she sees the long, white marks making their way up Harry’s hands. They aren’t the blistered burns from fire. They’re too long and thin, and the fact that Pomfrey hasn’t healed them can only mean that they were caused by magic.
‘There!’ says Draco, jutting his chin at the results. ‘What’s that? That round red bit. Is that bad? That’s bad isn’t it?’
Harry is distracted. There are many good reasons for Harry to be distracted—the events of the summer, the endless stream of stares and whispers, and the unexpected (and unwanted) change to his class schedule—and yet all he can seem to think about are the dreams he’s been having.
Malfoy’s voice barks a spell next to his head, and suddenly Harry can see again, his glasses back in place. He’s pulled out of the way, again by the back of his robes, as one of the Ravenclaw’s launches at them. Malfoy sticks out a foot, tripping the boy and Harry has to admire the quick way he’s back on his feet.
Pod turns his head, swivelling one large, opal eye to fixate on Potter. Potter doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t move. Doesn’t even breath.
Hermione can almost hear it. An extra word tacked onto the end of the sentence that Malfoy doesn’t quite say.
They tumble into the grass. Draco feels his inkwell topple over and ink soak into the leg of his trousers, but he doesn’t care. He lays half on top of Harry and kisses him.
Pansy eyes him for one moment, before rolling her eyes and releasing Greg. ‘So, Potter then?’ she says, and rolls her eyes. ‘Typical.’
Draco watches, unable to look away, unable to stop seeing how thin Potter looks like this. How small. How vulnerable.
She purses her lips. ‘You’re a good godfather,’ she says slowly, her gaze shrewd and unblinking as she watches for his reaction. ‘A good mentor. But there have always been…rumours.’
The astronomy tower, where Draco made a dig about Slughorn that made Harry laugh. Draco had been so surprised, his eyes almost a soft blue as he stared at Harry before offering a small, amused smile that softened his features. He’d looked so nice like that. Unreserved. Open. Attractive, even.
‘So what, you want me to leave?’ Draco snaps, though inside he’s rather hopeful that Urquhart will say yes.
'Oh yes,' says Luna. 'Draco is quite knowledgable about many magical creatures. He likes to pretend that it's because he's good at potions, though I know the truth.'
Draco shoots him a sly grin and Harry glares at him—though there’s none of the old antagonism there.
‘They’re are four colours,’ she says, running a finger down the spines of the books. ‘Red, green, yellow and blue.’
Blaise shrugs, calling her bluff. Of all the Slytherin’s, Daphne was the most uninterested (aside from him, of course) in the usual power games within the House.
‘Tell me, Draco,’ says Theo, cutting off Potter like he doesn’t even exist. ‘What will the Dark Lord do when he finds out? Hm? You think this will end well for you? And what about the rest of us, huh? When he finds out that we knew and we said
Draco scoffs, shooting Blaise a sideways scowl. If he had it his way, he’d rather be back inside beside the fire. Hell he’d rather be in the library, sitting next to—
‘But...’ says Ron, gaping at them. It’s all just too much. Dean saying Ginny and Harry are together. Harry saying he’s…he’s… ‘But what about Cho?’
‘I…I haven’t been—it’s not like you wanted me here anyway,’ says the Speaker. ‘You told me to stay away from you. You’ve been ignoring me in class, I figured this would just make things easier.’
‘Pfft, I’m not doing anything,’ she says, raising an eyebrow. ‘Besides, he’s the one being a git. Honestly,
disappointed. He's not. Really. Because he doesn't find Malfoy attractive. Or even capable of normal human emotion. The incident in Diagon Alley not withstanding.
‘Alright,’ says Madam Pomfrey, startling them all as she bustles back into the room. ‘That’s long enough. You can all come back tomorrow. Potter needs to rest.’
‘No,’ says Draco, and he turns to open a door off to their right. ‘Just competent. Now, are you coming in or not?’
‘I—sorry.’ Potter’s voice cracks, pitching unnaturally high, and he let’s go of Draco’s clothes like they’re on fire, dropping them all over the floor.
Ron’s face turns that familiar shade of enraged red, but Professor McGonagall interjects before he open his mouth.
There’s another splash to her left. Zabini’s head breaks the water, shaking his hair out of his face as he gets his bearings.
Three people try to ask him out. Two boys, and a girl who assures him she can change his mind. It’s right after this last one that Harry vanishes. He disappears down a corridor after Charms class and isn’t seen for the rest of the day.
‘You don’t think…’ Minerva trails off, sharp eyes fixing back on Poppy. ‘Surely not. That disease is just about unheard of. Has there even been a record of it since Morgana Le Fay herself?’
Moments start crashing through his mind. The Alley. The Attack. Draco sodding Malfoy desperately casting healing charms and cradling his head. Draco pulling him into the space between carriages on the Hogwarts Express so no one could see Harry having a melt down. Draco Malfoy taking him to the Hospital wing and not telling a single person when Madam Pomfrey declares that he’s fine, he’s just having
‘Harry?’ Granger calls, frowning over at the three of them, at Draco standing far too close to Brown with that furious expression on his face and Potter looking back and forth between them. ‘Everything okay?’
Theo turns away in disgust. Though who he’s more disgusted with (Draco, or himself) he doesn’t know. He heads for the door.
‘Don’t beat around the bush, Granger. They’re obviously friends. Weasley has cottoned on to the fact and now he’s pissed. Admit it, you lost.’
The soft kiss, pressed lightly to the corner of Harry’s mouth, next to the bruise, breaks what little self control Harry has. He pushes back, grabbing at Draco’s shoulders and holding him in place before he can pull away, his own kiss hot, and fierce and desperate.
Remus blinks, glances away, debates staying back with her. She’s been avoiding him, and he doesn’t blame her. Still, being in her presence, smelling that sweet scent of peanut butter, toffee and peppermint tea, he can’t help but want to linger. To relish this small moment with her just a bit longer—though every fibre of his being knows that he shouldn’t.
‘Sixth years need parental permission to do Care of Magical Creatures due to the high contact with dangerous magical creatures,’ Minerva says tartly. ‘Do we not need their permission for
With that, Minerva spun on her heel and stalked out, leaving the two boy’s sitting dumbfounded. Without sparing his students a second look, Severus follows her out—no doubt to try and change her mind about this unusual punishment.
Poppy’s gaze snaps upwards. Two hundred? Barely a week into the school year and both houses would be in negatives. Still, she knows it’ll do no good. It never has in the past. This rivalry runs deeper than house rivalry and really, yelling and lecturing clearly isn’t going to resolve their issues.
‘Draco is okay,’ she says, and Severus doesn’t miss the fact that she didn’t answer his question. ‘Well, Draco is as okay as he can be.’
Harry shrugs it off, rolling his ankle around in a circular motion to ease away the remainder of the already-fading pain. He tests his weight on it and only feels a minor twinge. He grins at Draco.
Draco dumps his bag on the table and drops into the couch. ‘Is it?’ he asks, letting his head fall back.
‘Yes,’ agrees Severus. ‘I’ll organise it at once. Come along Nott, you’ve caused enough trouble for one day.’
Ginny turns to Ron, fury written all over her face. ‘You are unbelievable,’ she says, shaking her head.
There’s a vague snort from the other side of the room, and then Theo mutters, ‘I told you not to bother.’
She licks the foam from her lips, drops the mug to the table and pushes up to her feet. Without thinking, he slides out of the booth to let her pass. Once again that strange mix of peanut butter, toffee and peppermint tea hits him, and he’s momentarily distracted.
A momentary pause, and Malfoy looks caught, like he’s not sure how to respond. ‘I despise you Potter, everybody knows that.’
She’s…stunned, actually. Does he realise what he’s implied? She knows, of course, that the rest of the class has. Several students are muttering, exchanging amused and speculative whispers that aren’t quite as quiet as they think they are.
She sighs and rubs at her eyes. Minerva was right. It should have been impossible. Even she had thought the illness a fairy tale. A myth. Something you told children who were misbehaving. And even if it weren’t, it was a malady that only afflicted the strong. The exceptional.
‘If you think for one second I’m spending an entire year studying something that cooks bread, you’ve got another thing coming Potter.’
‘On whether or not you have a kitchen separate to your lounge area. And of course you’ll want a guess room. And a dinning room—I
For the twelfth (or was it the thirteenth?) time that afternoon, Bellatrix Lestrange steps from the Hospital Wing storage cupboard. Her hair is as wild as it ever were, tangling around a face that (despite her years in Azkaban) has not seemed to age at all since Poppy last saw her in her last year of school.
He grins at her, but there’s a shadow beneath his expression. One that she recognises. One that only comes when a person has faced true pain. When they’re afraid they’ll face it again.
He shrugs, clearly unhappy, but not wanting to prolong the conversation. ‘Guess that’s up to you,’ he says.
Another rustle of clothing. ‘It doesn’t sound like hissing. It just sounds normal. Like they’re speaking english.’
Before he has time to ponder her reaction, however, the Hospital Wing door is swinging open and Severus is rushing in, a stretcher floating in behind him, and four students hot on his heels.
They’re performing a dance. One that they don’t yet know the moves to, but Luna can see the subtle indicators in their movements. Can hear the melody in the underlying tones of their voices and the missing words from their sentences. They haven’t realised it yet, but then, they’re still trying to find their rhythm.
Theo sighs, and Blaise gives up, instead shooting Pansy a pointed look and gesturing his head toward Vince and Millicent.
‘Hey,’ says Ron, nudging Harry. ‘When do you think you’ll host the Quidditch trials? I thought maybe next Tuesday would be good, you know, get it over with early?’
Harry stares at him. He laughs, sharp and high and morbid. He swipes a hand across his face and Ron realises that he’s
‘So,’ she says, keeping her gaze steadily on the biscuit base she’s making. ‘Tell me a bit more about Draco. I admit I’m finding it difficult to start a conversation with him.’
‘I…yes. I have food for you,’ he reaches out for her, and she curls herself around his arm, tasting the air to try and determine what he has brought her.
Poppy is a patient woman. After all, she’s worked with Albus Dumbledore for over twenty years, and Merlin knows that man can test the patience of any sane witch or wizard that is forced to spend prolonged periods of time in his presence.
Her gaze flashes over to Draco, so quick that Pansy almost didn’t see it. Irritation spikes through her. Honestly, had
Albus considers the boy a moment. He sees Severus’ temper falter, and the nervous, somewhat guilty look that flashes behind that dark, bitter expression. He sees the concern of Mr Zabini and Mr Goyle. Even young Malfoy chews on the inside of his mouth as he watches the boy who put him in his current condition.
Dora grins. ‘Sure,’ she says, taking a sip of her drink and eyeing him over the dwindling froth. She licks her lips, smirking at him with her eyes, ‘I think it’s someone he likes.’
‘I’ll grant you that it was a bit awkward at first,’ says Draco. ‘What with Potter’s inherent shyness and all. But I think it’s growing on him. There’s a certain thrill to being watched, you know? And Myrtle can be so encouraging, sad little thing that she is. And—’
. But instead it’s picking up the same damn toy off the floor over and over again, and baby proofing the
Two more blood-replenishing potions and Poppy seems to relax with a satisfied nod, stepping back from the bed and casting a wordless cleaning charm on her bloody hands.
Oh, hell. Harry has never been one for subtly so he might as well just ask. ‘Are you really not going to forgive Weasley?’
‘And be responsible for you freezing to death? I think not,’ he says. ‘And anyway, we’ll warm up in a minute.’
‘My dorm,’ says Draco, and his gaze flicks over to Potter’s fist, still surrounded in the soft glow of angry red magic. ‘I know you hate me at the moment, but it would be really great if you could not hit me with that.’
Blaise, ever the mediator, steps forward, his hands outstretched. ‘Wait, just wait a minute. Can we all just calm down?’
Mad-Eye rolls his eye. ‘Contact me immediately if you notice anything,’ he says, and pushes up from the table. ‘Shacklebolt, I’m sure you have work to do.’
‘You wouldn’t,’ gasps Eric. ‘You can’t. They’ll know. They’ll expel you. You can’t get away with it. You can’t…I…I’ll…’
Draco, breathing heavily, glowers at Theo. Theo doesn’t dare take his eyes off him. Even as Blaise moves into their line of sight, turning to face Draco.
At first, Harry doesn’t recognise the attacks for what they are. They come in bursts, striking out of no where (at night, for the most part, and Harry is thankful for small mercies) and leaving him gasping and sweaty and shaking. His heart hammers in his chest and he can’t quite expand his lungs enough to breathe. He thinks he might pass out, but just as the blackness is creeping into the edges of his vision, the all-consuming panic subsides and he’s okay again.
Despite this, there’s that familiar expression of expectant arrogance on his face that would, if not for the fact that Ron has also seen him, almost make Harry wonder if he’s hallucinating. It certainly wouldn’t be the first time he’d hoped to find Draco Malfoy on his doorstep (not that he’d tell anyone that).
He laughs and she bridges the gap between them. In the background she can hear some sort of commotion, and assumes that one of the younger years has set of another explosion. Or Seamus, she supposes.
The next day, Draco’s frustrations reach a new peak. He’s spent the night tossing and turning, tormented by dreams of kissing and caressing and touching—Merlin so much
Guilt flashes across Albus’s face and she knows she has him. Even Severus looks mildly uncomfortable.
‘Colour coded?’ asks Ron. His eyebrows shoot up and he grins. ‘House colours!’ he exclaims. ‘So, we only need to look through the red ones.’
He does. Lips press tight against Draco’s and that’s all it takes. His fingers lock in Harry’s hair and Draco whimpers, succumbing entirely to the feeling as everything suddenly clenches tight and—he gasps—release.
‘I think that’s quite enough,’ says Poppy, entering the room again before the argument can escalate any further. ‘I have my hands full enough without you two adding more stress to my patients. They need to heal, you can see Mr Potter tomorrow.’
She smiles at him. ‘But,’ she adds. ‘You never quite balanced each out. You tended to ignite each other’s fire, and, while that can sometimes be good in a relationship, a fire that burns too hot will burn out too quickly. You and Draco, on the other hand. You balance each other out.’
Hermione shrugs. ‘I don’t know,’ she says honestly. ‘You didn’t notice anything strange this morning, did you?’
Draco shrugs helplessly. ‘That’s just it,’ he says, and his voice is thick and rough as he leans back against the window sill, his hands gripping the stone. ‘I don’t know. I don’t know what I did wrong. I helped him, didn’t I? I gave him
His voice is all wrong. There’s none of the cheeky superiority he’s so fond using on everyone. No smugness. No drawl. Just a tight, anxious voice that is nothing at all like his usual cool and collected self.
‘Yeah and word is he heard about that poll going around about Slughorn being the better potions teacher so you just
The boy glances around. ‘Here?’ he flushes. ‘It’s just, I thought we could go somewhere less…crowded.’
who cast the shield in class. Meaning that he’d known perfectly well that Harry hadn’t been able to cast it at all.
‘I don’t mind,’ Charity insists. ‘I don’t want them to miss out, after all. It’s a great opportunity. And, and I agree. From what I’ve seen they both seem to be improving. Albiet slowly, and sometimes you have to trick them into it, but they

He yanks his traitorous wand out of his sleeve and tries to think of a spell to put the damn fire out. He’s still struggling to believe that he set the fire. So far his wandless work hasn’t been anything to write home about. And he hadn’t even been
‘Thank you,’ he murmurs, snuggling down and allowing his subconscious to drift back towards his dream.
…there are more emotions roiling through him than he’s prepared to deal with and the tension and anxiety boils along Draco’s skin.
‘I’m not the one who—‘ Draco cuts himself off. ‘You know what? I don’t fucking care. I don’t care about you and I don’t care about fucking Potter.’
As always thank you to everyone who is still out there waiting for the next chapter. I desperately want to be able to finish this story, but finding the time and energy lately just to squeeze writing into my currently very busy schedule has proved more difficult than when I started. Thank you for your patience and your perseverance in sticking with me as I make my slow way through to the end of this story.
Poppy chuckles. ‘Yes. Well I suppose in comparison stealing a patient’s confidential file is minor. Still, as you say, they can be quite resourceful; though I do wonder how they thought no one would notice.’
Harry shrugs her off. ‘Oh she was fine. Beautiful, actually, and not aggressive at all. Especially when I explained that we were just looking at her.’
Hermione marvels over that. If this was their Harry, did that mean that the Harry of a few moments ago was Malfoy’s?
It makes solid contact, and the small but dangerous ball goes flying off again. He must of charmed them to return, because not a moment later it’s flying back toward him.
‘Anyone who does not comply will face a weeks worth of detention, twenty lost house points, and find themselves assigned a new class partner who you will work with at all times.’
Remus narrows his gaze at her. ‘Why would I know about any teenage romances at Hogwarts?’ The moment he says it, realisation slams into him. ‘Wait, Harry? You think
If there’s anything about her job that Tonks dislikes, it’s having to deal with crowds. Not because of any particular dislike of people—in actuality she rather enjoys people—but more so because there are so many opportunities for her to fall on her arse. Add in a magical zoo (Scamander Emporium no less) and Tonks would be happy if she made it through the day with only minimal embarrassment.
Though his expression is hopeful, he says it in a way that denotes his expectation of her refusal. She gives him a smile, leaning forward to press a lingering kiss to his lips.
‘Very good,’ says Professor Burbage brightly. ‘Well, how about we hear from…Hannah, why don’t you go next?’
‘Yeah,’ says Harry, dumping the towel and yanking the shirt over his head. ‘Curse scars. I’m stuck with them, just like all the rest.’
I debated with myself at length about whether or not to do a chapter in between the last one and this one; but in the end this felt right. I promise there will be more about what happened in the last chapter - just not yet :)
‘I was,’ Harry says hurriedly, cutting him off. ‘I was enjoying it. I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately, and I thought I could handle it but…I guess not.’
She strides past Ginny, her robes billowing out behind her as she speeds off faster than Ginny has ever seen her. Ginny takes a few deep breaths and hurries after her.
Harry considers him for a long moment before a wry smile stretches across his face, he looks away, but his gaze flicks sideways, back at Colin. ‘You saw, didn’t you?’ he says.
She heaves a sigh of relief as she exits the Avery a short distance behind them, and sees the group heading toward a food vendor.
Malfoy jumps and swears. Disapproval swarms in Hagrid’s gut like angry bees, but before he can step in, Malfoy surprises him by actually smiling.
—’ she says this bit in the direction of the still fighting boys, raising her voice at them but neither of them even pause in their fight to acknowledge her.
‘What do you mean?’ says Potter, looking back and forth between Ginny and Dean. ‘You’re not, you’re not breaking up, are you?’
Draco’s eyes go wide. ‘He told you…’ his face goes pale, but if anything he straightens even further, his expression hardening. ‘No one will believe you.’
Harry chuckles low and soft. ‘Let me guess, there’s some magical creature that loves christmas that’s going to make all my troubles go away?’
Luna nods. ‘It was quite bad. Several classroom suffered almost irreparable damage and a large portion of student assignments were lost. Three years of students had to repeat a year because the school records had all been lost.’
Ron snorts and shakes his head. ‘Bonkers,’ he says. ‘It’s all just bonkers. You’d think people would’ve forgotten all about that with all the attacks there’s been this summer.’
She takes the chart out of mid-air. ‘And what happened to your big plan of returning for Mr Weasley’s birthday? Or have you decided that’s not as important as wallowing in self-pity?’
Stunned silence follows. Well, for a moment. Then Ron—standing frozen in the half open doorway with his hand still on the handle—says in shocked disbelief,
Harry knocks his chocolate away, stepping away from the Slytherins to press closer toward Poppy, his wide-eyed gaze riveted to the unmoving form of Mr Malfoy. 'You can fix him, can't you?' he repeats, his voice high and strained, the blood drained from his face to be seemingly spattered over his clothes. 'He's going to be okay? Right?'
Ginny snorts. ‘Serves her right,’ she says. ‘No wonder Harry’s uncomfortable. Why can’t they all just leave him alone?’
They’re in various stages of packing up their things, and Theo can only hope that they haven’t seen the necklace. That the damage is limited to just these three. Brown, Potter and Draco.
Kingsley merely blinks. He raises his mug, and they clink them together, sealing whatever strange deal they’ve made as sure as any handshake.
So, so, SO many apologies. This chapter killed me. I rewrote it several times, from at least four different POV's and in all honesty I still hate it. But, I'm done fighting with it. There's stuff coming up that I'm dying to get to so, this is what it is for now. Anyway, I am dropping back to once a week again until I stop feeling so annoyed with this story but I have not given up. I am determined to conquer this story (plus, I haven't gotten to all the cute stuff yet!).
He strides down the street, flinging shields and reinforcement spells at the buildings as he passes. He keeps his head down, trying not to draw attention to himself even as he grabs two teenagers by the scruff of their necks and shoves them toward the gaudy store front of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes. Both Weasley twins are there in the front, ushering people into the depths of the store, and one of them gives Severus a nod and a wink as they yank the two teens away from Severus and into the store.
‘Well you were thrashing about like a fucking crazy person, so yeah, I hexed you,’ said Smith stiffly, tucking his wand back into his bedside table draw. ‘Now shut up. I have an assignment due tomorrow and I don’t want to be too tired to work on it just because The Boy Who Has Nightmares can’t keep his problems to himself.’
Minerva snorts. ‘Yes,’ she says with a sceptical smile. ‘Clearly they can be quite resourceful. Though, I’m still not sure why we haven’t nipped that particular mandrake in the roots. You don’t think letting them get away with it was going a bit far?’
Malfoy is grinning as he talks, watching Potter who is twisting his head back and forth, unable to decide where to look first and too overwhelmed to take it all in.
‘Many of you have no doubt heard that there was an altercation yesterday evening in the Defence classrooms,’ says McGonagall, her gaze sweeping over the room and quelling all conversations.
He’s not sure what he wants to do more, write to his Nan and tell her about this honour, to make her
She turns to look at Harry and Malfoy with an expectant, if trepidatious smile. Hannah glances at them too, and hopes that they aren’t going to spend the rest of the class arguing. Conflict makes her nervous; and when she’s nervous, she sweats.
‘Oh, they’ve been everywhere in the castle,’ she says. ‘But I wouldn’t worry. They’re definitely on the move now.’
And suddenly, Theo realises exactly why Draco is afraid. It’s not the mission, or the necklace, or even the chance of discovery.
Satisfaction surges through her, almost better than the last hour she’s spent with the handsome seventh year.
Potter looks at him curiously, his feet crunching along the leaves on the path. ‘You’ve just called me every insult known to man, and now you want to get ice-cream?’
Draco stiffens at Luna’s side, staring down at Ron with narrowed eyes. Two predators sizing each other up. The wolf and the lion, each lonely, each desperate to make their mark, each needing to be loved.
Ron gets an arm free and punches Malfoy in the face. Malfoy staggers back, falling straight into the dome.
Harry shifts beneath him. ‘Hm, uh,’ he says, and his voice is breathy and warm against Draco’s neck. ‘I…uh…Draco…’
Right from the moment that they returned to Hogwarts for their eighth year, Draco has been different. Sure, he still
Pomfrey brushes a hand through his hair. ‘Harry,’ she says. ‘I cleared them all myself. There was a lot of smoke and I just want to be sure I didn’t miss anything, but they are okay. They’re just sleeping.’
He shoots her a narrow eyed look which she returns with an arch of one carefully manicured brow. Instead, she turns to Greg.
He doesn’t know why he does it, only that the words are halfway out of his mouth before he’s fully processed the idea to even speak. ‘Although I am curious,’ says Theo, dropping his school bag and straightening to stare at Draco in genuine, if disdainful, bafflement. ‘Do you
Ron jumps and spins around and, of course, there’s fucking Malfoy—flanked on either side by his stupid goonies as always—there to ruin everything. Ron scowls, fury boiling through his veins.
As if sensing what she’s thinking, Daphne rolls her eyes. She shakes her head and then pauses, her posture straightening as her gaze pins on something across the room. Curious, Pansy follows her gaze.
Tonks blinks, and it’s as if her thoughts have once again personified themselves before her. Potter seems weighed down by the words, and Tonks can see all the expectations piled on top of him (the papers, the Ministry,
Two days later Dean is about ready to punch the next person he hears discussing Harry and Ginny’s supposed “new relationship”. It seems to be all anyone can talk about. How she dove into the unknown depths of Potter’s stupid conjured lake to rescue the overpowered idiot. How she sat with him for hours, which, yes okay, she
She contemplates calling out, giving the boys away and making them leave her sanctity, but…it’s been
Harry smiles down at the grass. ‘Yeah. Twelve months ago I’d have given anything not to put up with you and now…’
‘Keep it up Gin!’ Ron shouts after she scores her third goal, pumping his arm to cheer her on, and Ginny feels a glow of pride.
Theo had retrieved the necklace from. Draco who had snuck the thing into Hogwarts to begin with. If all else failed, Theo could easily pin the situation on him. No one would doubt him. Not with Draco’s track record. Not when the mission was Draco’s to begin with.
At the end of class, he weighs the little bag of coins that Theo slips into his palm with faint satisfaction. Daphne gives Blaise a meaningful look as she passes, eyes flickering down to the little purse, and he waves her off. He’ll have to give up the little bag (not to mention his mother’s grimoire), but for now he would enjoy the satisfaction of the win. He was still the betting King.
Ginny grabs the two drinks, ready to storm over to Harry’s rescue, only to see Malfoy (of all people) appear at Harry’s elbow. From the furious red flush that blossoms on Romilda’s face, Ginny can only assume that he’s said something appropriately scathing. She smirks, and inches closer to listen in.
He inches closer, sliding his thumb up over Harry’s jawbone and over his lip. Harry’s breath is hot and moist. Draco wants nothing more than to close the distance between them and kiss him again and again, until all the self doubt and worry gnawing away at him disappears.
‘That wasn’t—ugh. Look, I get it, okay? You don’t want to be with someone who’s probably going to die. That’s a sucky position to be in and I understand. You could’ve just said that in the first place instead of going on about how we don’t work together.’
She’s the only one in the class who looks amused, and Hannah wonders if she’s amused by Harry or by Zach’s presentation.
Silence falls. Potter shifts uncomfortably, running a hand through his hair and looking at anything but Malfoy. Malfoy just stares at him, his face unreadable.
Ginny grumbles, but she and Luna begin packing up their cards. Ron pushes to his feet, shuffling his weight from foot to foot, opening and closings his mouth as he tries to decide what to say. He sighs and settles on,
‘For being a good friend.’ The blush returns to Harry’s face, stronger than ever, and then—before Neville can reply—he disappears out the door after Malfoy.
Ron nods, frustrated at being chastised by his baby sister but knowing he deserves it. That is, until he glances up and sees her glaring at Dean.
Hell, he’d outright grin if he didn’t think that Draco had just cost them the assignment (worth twenty percent of their grade, no less; and honestly, who knew that Slughorn and Snape shared a predilection for setting high mark assignments at the start of the school year?).
The smell of lavender caught Hermione’s attention, and she turned back to her cauldron, ready to implement the next step.
Luna shrugs. Her eyes settle almost instinctively on a cover, and she reaches for it, suddenly knowing why she’d needed to get up.
Potter drums his fingers against the table, eyeing off Malfoy with an expression that Lisa suspects is
He goes silent. He’s still staring off into nowhere, but there’s the slightest lift to his lips—a small, bittersweet smile that lingers on his mouth and in his eyes. Harry can only stare, suddenly quite unable to breathe. He drops his gaze to his own mug of deliciously warm cocoa, made just the way he likes it, and swallows hard.
Ginny shakes her head. ‘Honestly,’ she says, and flicks her hair over her shoulder. ‘They aren’t good enough for you.’
‘He fell off the couch,’ says Draco, watching Scorpius with avid eyes. ‘He just rolled right through my wards and straight onto the floor. I picked him up straight away, and he looks fine, but he hasn’t cried. Not even a bit.’
‘Sorry I’m late class, I had to pick up some new material for next weeks class project. Alright, time for our individual presentations. Everyone got their projects ready? Oh, yes all on the table. Well done. Well, first up to present will be, let’s see…how about Miss Bones, with her Muggle flip-phone.’
‘Harry Potter,’ says Ginny in her best imitation of her mother’s voice. ‘I suggest you get real certain, because it’s going to be hard enough getting Draco Malfoy, of all people, to agree to go out with you based on the fact that you
It should be impossible for his face to get any redder, and yet, it does. ‘I, uh, kinda ran away,’ he says, rubbing the back of his neck.
Theo glances up, eyebrows raised. It’s the first time that Draco has even acknowledged Theo in weeks. Draco doesn’t seem to notice, though. He’s too focused on the conversation.
Potter is shaking his head. ‘No, I can’t do that. I can’t just pretend that none of this ever happened and still make nice. It’s not fair. You can’t expect me to do that.’
He makes a lunge for Harry, but Harry dodges away from him, shuffling backwards and laughing. He scrambles to his feet and makes for the door.
‘It is indeed,’ says Professor Burbage, still staring at Malfoy. ‘Though I doubt any of you students would be able to tell the difference.’
Poppy flicks her wand at Potter, casting various standard diagnostic spells as Malfoy and Minerva watch on. Malfoy, apparently deciding that he’s not at risk of being admonished or tormented about the situation, sits on the edge of his bed.
‘Because this is the potions section, idiot,’ mutters Malfoy, rolling his eyes. ‘Honestly, how do you function?’
Potter’s hair drips into his face and his eyes, so green and bright without his glasses on, are innocently wide, fixated on Draco. ‘Maybe,’ he says, his voice soft. ‘But I don’t think those reasons matter anymore.’
do this. Making people run around after you. It’s childish and it’s stupid. You don’t consider anyone else, you just do things because you’re
would feel that buzz, and maybe she will—maybe, by the grace of magic, Ron would come to his senses and realise she exists and do something sweet—but the truth is, she probably won’t. And that's okay. Because maybe…maybe her actions will help others tell each other how they feel?
‘Think of only me,’ he says. He trails his fingers up Harry’s arm, and rests his palm on Harry’s neck. ‘Think of this. Right now.’
Most wizards who use as much magic as Potter has just done end up in comas. At worst, without magical intervention, the physical strain is enough to cause organ damage. Tainted livers. Ruptured spleens. Heart failure.
‘C’mon,’ says Potter, nudging Malfoy with his elbow before stepping away quickly and ducking his head. ‘Let’s go get some food. I’m half starved.’
hadn’t been there none of this would have happened because he wouldn’t have been trying to protect his pathetic, sorry excuse for a boyfriend in the first place!’
He ignores the smug look on Blaise’s face—he’ll decide how to punish the irritable sod later—and stomps through the grass after Potter.
She looks back down at the portrait of her and her sisters, clearly modelled off an old photograph from their youth—before their differences had torn them apart—and feels an odd mixture of emotions. It
A/N: I know, I know, I'm two updates behind. Have no fear, I've not abandoned the story already. Rather, there's a severe stomach bug going around the city I live in and I've spent the last week being violently ill, which doesn't really lend itself to good writing - thus why this chapter is so short. Never fear though, I hope to make it up to you, if not in the next chapter but the one after that.
He remembers what Malfoy said the night of the fire. About fighting for Harry. About doing things that no one else would.
‘You’re here,’ he gasps, and something like relief washes over him—except that it’s a little too desperate to be relief. ‘You have to help. I… I think there’s something
There’s a moment of silence and then Malfoy chuckles. ‘Ladies and Gentleman, Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived-To-Set-Snakes-On-Innocent-People.’
Draco chuckles and, very deliberately, leans forward to kiss him, shifting his hips as he does so. Harry shudders—which only serves to encourage the growing situation at their hips. Draco bites his lip, feeling his trousers begin to tighten in response to Harry’s obvious arousal.
Theo knows that Potter can’t possibly know about the necklace, can’t know—no matter what look Draco gave him—what danger they were just in, and yet the boy is obviously covering for Draco. Theo knows it. Granger knows it. Blaise knows it. Yet no one says anything.
Harry is good at running. Always has been. He thinks he hears a shout behind him, but he doesn’t care. He doesn’t care that he’s just ditched out on detention. Or that McGonagall will probably blast him for it when she finds out. Or that he’s left Draco Bloody Malfoy sitting baffled in a puddle of spilt cleaning water.
Draco chuckles and straightens, not moving out of Harry’s lap but giving him room to straighten up. Only Harry stills, his eyes flashing wide, his cheeks flushing red.
The reaction is immediate. The boys spring apart, recoiling like they’ve been burnt. They turn toward her, eyes searching, and she squeaks, ducking back down behind the bathroom stall.
The stag turns it’s head, looking first at Ron and Ginny, and then toward Malfoy’s group. It turns in a circle once and then, in the sudden quiet that falls over them, Harry’s voice whispers through the hall.
‘You will do this, and you will do it without complaint, or I will send you back to your dorms this instant.’
McGonagall heads out of the room, disappearing into her office almost exactly on cue and, as Brown is opening up her bag, her face lighting up in confusion when she sees the package he’d slipped into it, Theo sticks.
‘Of course full discretion will be required,’ adds Albus. ‘You’ll have to organise a vow on that front I should think. Just to be on the safe side. If you wouldn’t mind Severus,’ Albus gestures to Nott.
‘My help?’ asks Draco, eyebrows raised and eyes wide. ‘And what would you want my help with Weasley?’
She shifts her weight, eyes darting up and down the corridor (which isn’t empty). More than a few students are watching them, gazes curious as whispers echo around them. Ron frowns and glances about, only just seeming to notice. He scowls.
Draco, his mind of far better things, ignores him. Suddenly wanting nothing more than to be alone in the privacy of his own bed.
’It’s not like I want to be captain,’ says Harry. ‘Nothing ever works out the way it’s supposed to. We can practice the manoeuvres ’til the sun goes down but that doesn’t mean that’s how it’ll play out on the pitch.’
Draco rolls his eyes. ‘I’ve been scrubbing floors since October. There’s not a room in this castle I haven’t been in.’
Colin knows that Harry doesn’t like all the attention he gets. He has learned, through trial and error, that Harry prefers solitude to the endless stares and whispers that follows him. Yet, despite that, the urge to photograph Harry has always itched in Colin’s hands because Harry’s face is one of the most expressive of all the people he’s ever met. Now, though, Harry’s face is carefully blank as he watches Malfoy leave the Great Hall.
Surprise washes away some of Lavender’s anger. The fury is raging across Ron’s face. He shakes his head and turns away.
‘One will develop a tolerance for anything given enough exposure,’ says Draco, refocusing back on his book. ‘I’m just trying to keep from catching that Gryffindor idiocy. I still despise him.’
Malfoy’s gaze flicks back and forth between Minerva and Poppy, wary and still mortified. ‘For a moment,’ he says eventually.
A door slams up ahead, coming from the direction of the Hospital Wing. Ron’s footsteps falter. He shakes his head, clenching and unclenching his hands, trying to rid himself of nerves. He feels like he’s about to step out onto the Quidditch Pitch during finals.
Draco straightens, his bag clutched tightly in one hand, and the other still stuffed carefully into his pocket.
Silence. Molly chances a quick glance and sees an expression of incredulity on Draco’s face. ‘You think you
‘What? Seeing as we have to start getting along, I don’t see the problem in appreciating the finer points of other houses.’
‘Mate,’ says Ron, realisation crashing over him, along with disgust and outrage. ‘You’re mad if you think you’re anything like that psycho.’
‘You understand that he is hunted by the Dark Lord?’ he says in a softer voice. ‘You realise there is no future with him?’
Potter nods. ‘Yeah. Though he doesn’t talk to them much. I think it makes him nervous. Not talking to snakes, but the way other people react.’
Harry rubs the back of his neck. ‘Er, sorry. I guess I don’t really pay attention to the other years much.’ He laughs nervously.
Harry glances up from perusing the photos. ‘Yeah, but there a heaps of us,’ he says, indicating this fact by lifting a shot of the two of them flying around the goal posts in pursuit of the snitch.
The curtain slides back as Draco is shrinking his clothes and pocketing them. Potter shuffles over to the benches, a towel wrapped around his waist and head ducked (and here Draco thought Gryffindor’s were supposed to be
Hermione levels her with a cool gaze. ‘I’ve been your roommate for six years. You’re a gossip, Lavender. You always have been.’
She sighs and shuts off the mirror with a wave of her wand. There was no harm in letting the boy be happy another day. After all, if she’s right, he’s got a long struggle ahead of him.
‘Harry,’ warns the Girl, ‘Let’s, uh, let’s maybe calm down, yeah? We don’t want another exploding bludger.’
‘That’s what you’re worried about?’ he asks, and he almost wants to laugh. ‘You’ve been shirking your responsibilities for
The room goes quiet again. Malfoy doesn’t move. He raising one arm up to cover his face and soon, he too is breathing softly.
‘I know that,’ says Harry, his voice trembling. ‘I know he is. But I can’t…don’t you see? It’s too late. I can’t be saved. And if he…if he goes through with this? It’ll all be for nothing. I can’t…I can’t let him.’
‘Oh come on,’ says Blaise, tossing aside his book and summoning another of Greg’s marshmallows. ‘When are you two going to kiss and make up, huh? All this tiptoeing around you and him and Potter. It’s getting a bit tedious don’t you think?’
Blaise catches Greg’s eye and tilts his head toward Draco. He doesn’t bother trying to get Vince’s attention (or Theo’s, who aside from being engrossed in an essay, hasn’t even looked at Draco since The Fight).
Harry rolls away, avoiding a punch to the head from Ron, before scrabbling to his feet and pulling out his wand. He swipes blood from his nose, and levels Ron with his wand.
He pulls out one of the chairs—one at the opposite end of the table to where Hermione and the others are standing—and drops into it, his expression cool and closed off.
‘Dunno,’ says Harry, but he looks distracted, his gaze falling away from them as he chews on the inside of his mouth.
It’s no use. Draco may have been spoilt, and self-involved, and arrogant. But there was a reason he was all those things. There was a reason, besides money, that he was at the top of the food chain in the Slytherin hierarchy.
Harry, who is hunched over, shoulders shaking as he tries unsuccessfully to stifle his snickers, shakes his head. ‘Nope,’ he chokes out.
Draco barks out another sharp laugh, shaking his head and looking away from her. ‘I wish that were all it was,’ he glances toward her. ‘It’s over.’
Potter crosses his arms across his chest, which Phineas thinks is supposed to look indifferent but really just makes the boy look self-conscious. ‘You’re the one who said it was over. You told me to stay away from you.’
‘I…’ he swallows, starting again, and Hermione wonders what on Earth could be so bad that he’s this nervous. ‘Look, I…I didn’t say anything before because I was kind of embarrassed and by some miracle Malfoy didn’t go shoot off his mouth the minute it happened but…I kind of…lost it…’
be helpful (though, with the girl’s tendency to prattle on about the undiscoverable or rare Hermione’s not sure how much use she’ll be here) but there’s more to it than that.
Malfoy stares at Potter for a long moment, his eyes wide and his face pale. ‘What’re you talking about?’ he asks, his voice low and hoarse.
The air is cool and crisp and has Draco sighing heavily into the collar of his coat as he makes the long trudge down to the Quidditch Pitch.
‘So,’ says Ginny turning back to face Katie. ‘Now that we’ve been traumatised by our captain, want to get this practice started?’
Colin would love to photograph them. Up close, just her eyes crinkled in a smile, with a peek at her freckles smattered across the bridge of her nose.
Potter, who is squinting at Blaise, Greg and Theo with no small amount of embarrassment and nervousness, looks back at Draco. He swallows audibly.
‘Isn’t this why you followed me out here?’ says Harry in a soft voice, turning his face into the blond’s neck.
Severus bursts out into the chaotic street. People shove and push, desperate to flee the bolts of reds, yellows and oranges being flung throughout the street. At the far end of the street Severus sees four people dressed in the familiar black robes of Death Eaters.
Deep inside him, the wolf whines it’s agreement. Though the full moon is still weeks away, the wolf tugs him toward Dora. He can feel it’s pull, her easy nature quelling the fury of the beast, making him want to curl up beside her by a warm fire.
‘So,’ he says, and his voice hitches an octave too high. Clearly his throat, he tries again. ‘So, what’s next?’
‘Of course I told Kinglsey. Malfoy’s father and aunt are both Death Eaters. The only reason I’m telling you now is because I know Harry means a lot to you, and, well if I’m right, he’s going to need all the support he can get.’
Minerva nods. ‘I believe Albus has a rare book on Morgana’s era, I’ll see if I can get my hands on it. I assume you haven’t told him?’
Hermione grimaced and didn’t bother answering. She didn’t have to. It was inevitable really and they all knew it. Looking across at Slytherin table, Harry caught Malfoy’s grey-eyed gaze. That familiar scowl flitted into place, and Harry knew that a similar conversation was being had over there.
He slides his fingers through Harry’s perpetually unruly hair, pulling slightly as Harry bites down on Draco’s collarbone. He stifles a groan and drops his head forward, pressing his face into Harry’s hair.
they’re curious. She’s not the only one who realises that she’s never been late to class before. She crosses to her desk, ignoring Potter as he trails her, and flicks her wand at the board. Instructions for the lesson weave themselves across the surface, but Potter is still stubbornly at her back.
‘Oh alright,’ she says, rolling her eyes and waving him off. ‘Fooling around then. The point is, you
Potter returns the smirk in a manner eerily reminiscent of the Slytherin he’s mocking (a clear indication that they’ve been stuck spending far too much time together). ‘You’d be lucky to get my help,’ he says, still leaning on his table. ‘This class is
Malfoy hesitates, measuring Harry’s response. ‘Alright,’ he says. ‘So, how long do you get out of class this time?’
She casts him a sidelong look. Of course, she already knew this, just like she’d known about the visit in the first place.
Hermione can’t help it. She looks up from her essay. Ron his frowning down at his hands, chewing on the inside of his mouth. He glances across at the empty seat where Harry was sitting and frustration flashes across his face.
He sets the box of books aside, placing it carefully on top of the pile of presents beside him, his hand lingering along the top of the box.
‘You said you were in the Hospital Wing, right? Maybe it was food poisoning?’ says Greg in what he mistakes for a helpful manner.
Harry’s gaze snapped back to Malfoy. He was watching Harry with that now-familiar appraising look that was half challenge and half...what? An offer of conspiratorial friendship? At the very least, he was an alley against Smith.
An hour after Madam Pomfrey has cleared them all of any lingering repercussions (and yet demanded they all spend the night), they lay or sit in their own beds in various states of quiet unwinding. Ginny can’t stop her hands from shaking, so she scrunches them up in her sheets and looks around the room.
‘Yes of course—but Harry, there in the thick of it all? So many sensational stories. In fact, I heard that you took on Bellatrix herself—’
He shrugs her away, glancing sideways at Katie. ‘Yeah,’ he coughs and clears his throats. ‘Uh, thanks. I should…I should probably go.’
He glances nervously at the two remaining seats; one next to Malfoy, and one next to Zabini. He drops his gaze to the floor and heads to the seat next to Zabini, slipping into the seat with a nervous smile.
Malfoy all but flees the room, leaving Minerva to wonder whether or not she should bother tracking down Potter to find out what happened. She decides against it, realising that Albus would only question her if he found out, and she doesn’t need to give the man any more reason to play favourites than usual.
She frowns and, trying not to feel hurt by his brusk attitude, follows. ‘Are you okay?’ she asks. ‘Because I can help if—’
She laughs. ’Sure,’ she says, and takes the photos. She frowns at them curiously. ‘Why this one? For the life of me I can’t choose which is better and you did it in a minute.’
Next to her, Earnie McMillan stifles a snort of laughter, quickly turning it into a low cough before anyone notices.
She busies herself making sandwiches, waiting patiently for Harry to compose himself. She knows from previous experience that when it comes to teenage boys, it is always best to let them come to you.
Hesitation has never been either boy’s preference. In fact, they’re almost always too eager to blame each other for whatever scrape they’ve managed to get themselves into.
The fine edible petals would almost be impressive, what with their shimmery and translucent colour and aromatic taste of chocolate, but Draco is too distract to really pay them any mind.
She brushes a hand along the back of his head as he sits down at the table for Christmas lunch, smoothing down the loose strands of blond hair—so much like his father’s—and drops a kiss on the top of his head.
Theo shrugs, though this time his eyes flash downwards and his jaw tightens the way it only ever does when he thinks of his father.
Still, she knows Potter, and she knows that if he doesn’t drag himself up out of the darkness he’s sunk into things will only get worse; and if he won’t pull himself out, she will.
The boys, predictably, spend an inordinate amount of time in the Avery—Potter somehow managing to convince Malfoy into chasing after the Golden Snidget’s, not trying to catch them, but each boy trying to outrace the other.
The answer is clearly sarcastic, and he almost stumbles with the force of the next hit. He’s out of breath and panting, his flushed face standing out against the paleness of his skin.
She puts a stasis charm over the tea and coffee and sandwiches and returns to her dinner preparations. Ten minutes later, she is rewarded by a tentative shuffling into the kitchen.
is far to pretty a name for you to just butcher like that Gin. How about you go back to your little camera friends and leave the grown ups to talk.’
Though, Katie supposes she can’t complain too much. It was Ron’s berating of her that prompted his sister to suggest getting together for their own little practice sessions when Katie’s schedule allowed.
Lisa smirks. ‘I know. I take Runes. To be honest, I’m surprised you were able to pull this off seeing as you’re not taking it this year.’
The Burrow is a warm—if slightly wonky—beacon of light in the chilly December afternoon. Tonks’ footsteps crunch in the freshly heaped snow, and she huddles down further into her winter coat.
her there. Somehow, with her wide eyes and odd and often-times out of context remarks, Malfoy actually finds Luna’s presence (of all people) comforting.
Something shifts in those vividly green eyes. A small grin twitches at the corner of his mouth, an edge of wistfulness creeping into his eyes. ‘That’s okay,’ he says. ‘It was at least a decent photo of me, right? I don’t look like an idiot.’
Severus is quiet a long time. ‘Dumbledore isn’t a god. He is infallible. You may not want his protection for your son.’
Luna nods. ‘Pity,’ she says. ‘They did so enjoy our long flight last year. They were ever so helpful.’
She watches them out of the corner of her eye from three seats over, simultaneously stuffing her face with a double helping of hot chips and a cottage pie, and unashamedly eavesdropping on the two boys across from her.
He stops short, staring at the small figure darting back and forth across the sky in the distance above the Quidditch pitch. The figure turns sharply, catapulting into a nose dive that knocks the wind out of Draco’s lungs. He stares in numb disbelief, knowing there’s only one person who can fly like that and wondering what the bloody hell the idiot is thinking.
‘A curse for a curse,’ mutters Malfoy, his tone low and brooding, his face clouded. He sighs and runs a hand over his face. ‘Bloody fae.’
‘Well,’ says the human girl, leaning on the edge of Blue’s tank to peer in. ‘Why don’t you pick a name now?’
‘No,’ Poppy agrees. She chews on her thumbnail, a nervous habit that Minerva hasn’t seen since the last wizarding war. ‘I’m starting to wonder if we should tell Albus?’
Behind him, Draco’s eyes go wide. Anguish flashes over his features, but it’s gone just as quickly as it came. Theo’s blood boils. He clenches his hand around his wand.
Draco pushes into a room and, half expecting the worst, Harry follows. Only to stop on the threshold and stare in bewilderment. Inside, sitting propped against a table, is a large oil painting set inside an elaborate bronze frame.
New books? Blaise raises his eyebrows and glances curiously at the timetable, wondering just how much of it has changed. The paper is barely in Draco’s hand before Snape is stalking back off.
There’s no sign of the wrackspurts that have been plaguing him. Indeed, his shoulders are relaxed, and the usual creases around his eyes are smoothed out. They have a faraway, lost look about them, as if he’s not entirely here—and Luna suspects he isn’t.
He says it in such a way that Minerva is positive he’d already thought of her, and was hoping none of them would. She resists the urge to hex him, and instead focuses on the fact that she’s been victorious. She exchanges a smile with Poppy and Charity, and enjoys the creeping satisfaction that comes from seeing Severus so put out.
Dizziness assaults his vision and Potter blurs before him. He sways and a hand steadies him—though it’s not Pomfrey.
, no. God no! No, no one ever did anything. It’s just…my aunt…she uh, well she caught me. When I was nine or ten, I was in the bath and she came to make sure I was out but I was, er, wan-wanking.’
When he finally stops running, he’s at the astronomy tower. He supposes he shouldn’t be surprised. Years of Harry Hunting have conditioned him to seek out the highest possible point to hide. Probably why he enjoys flying so much.
He glances over at Poppy and though he knows she feels his gaze, she ignores him in favour of dealing with Harry.
‘I guess so,’ she says. ‘I mean, mostly it’s just picking people up and detaining them. Most people quiet down fairly quick when they see us. But I guess things have heated up a bit recently, so we’re having to fight a bit more than we used to.’
afraid?’ asks Malfoy, staring across the room, almost seeming to gaze at the portrait Phineas is hiding in. ‘Don’t you realise what could happen if anyone found out about this?’
Hagrid frowns. 'Harry's always gotten good marks in my class,' he says. 'Better than Malfoy, anyway.'
Kingsley raises an eyebrow at her, before shaking his head and continuing to mark up the report (she wonders briefly whose it is, and hopes it’s not one of hers).
Malfoy shoots Luna an annoyed glance. She shrugs at him, linking her hands behind her back and turning to look back along the shelves, keeping one eye on the boys and one on the books.
Potter looks exasperated. ‘You want to be friends?’ he asks, incredulously. ‘So, we can’t be together, but we can be friends?’
Harry grinned and bit down on a chuckle. He wasn’t wrong. The circular room was a mis-match of the house colours. Varying shades of blues, reds, greens, and yellows had been thrown about the room without any discernible order or pattern. Harry spotted a few chairs in the corner that (although a hideous shade of yellow) looked like they’d come from Gryffindor tower and instantly gravitated toward that direction.
They all head up to the front of the room to see a small, sprawling model display of what can only be described as lights and colour.
He breathes in. He breathes out. He waits for Malfoy’s response. Tries to pretend that his chest doesn’t hurt with the simple effort of
Stunned and more than a little pissed off (not to mention embarrassed that someone had been witness to his nightmares), Harry pushed himself to his feet and reached for his wand to figure out what the hell had happened to his nightly silencing charms.
She pauses, watching him for a moment before approaching, appraising his appearance as a general reflection of his mood. His shirt is untucked, his tie loose, his hair falling around his face instead of slicked back in his once preferred style.
Pansy grins, pleasure bubbling up her spine. ‘Oh, he’s alright,’ she says, flicking her hair over her shoulder in order to cast a quick glance his way.
She plasters a smile on her face and half jogs after her boyfriend. ‘Ron!’ Lavender calls, reaching out to catch his arm before he can disappear up the boys dorm steps.
‘Over here,’ says Poppy, gesturing at the prepared bed before Severus can continue. ‘Quickly, quickly.’
The change comes gradually…unexpectedly, creeping through Harry’s thoughts with such subtlety that he doesn’t notice until it’s too late. Until he’s well and truly transfixed. Until his mouth is pressed firmly against unexpectedly soft lips, drawing forth a faint gasp of air, a sharp intake of breath that sends the heartbeat under Harry’s palm racing and warmth bursting through Harry’s insides like warm honey. Honey and lemons, he thinks, the smell tickling at his nose, drawing him further into this momentary insanity without him even realising.
That garners him the startled attention of Blaise, Greg and Draco, none of whom had realised that he was awake.
Remus shifts in his seat, gripping his mug a little too tightly, unsure how they got off on this tangent. ‘I’m not exactly fit for—’
Out of the corner of her eye Ginny sees a Slytherin chaser make a break for Gryffindor goals. She stops watching Harry and Malfoy dipping and diving through the sky and races off to guard her end of the pitch.
Malfoy steps further away. ‘Maybe it did, when it was just you and me. But do you really think it’ll be the same out there? As soon as they know they’ll tear us apart. They’ll say we can’t be together. They’ll
Thistle holds a present out to him and steadily they all work their way through the gifts. Draco’s pile is, as usual, the largest. He receives all sorts of gifts from his school friends and as Narcissa makes her way slowly through her own small pile, she watches the gloom settle back over him.
By the time Harry looks up, Draco has recomposed himself, but not before Molly sees the smitten expression on his face. She turns her head away, smiling down at the tray in front of her. She had thought her days of watching lovestruck teenagers interact were over, and yet, seeing Draco and Harry before her now, she is suddenly glad that not
Minerva freezes for a moment as all eyes fix on Potter. By the time they swivel to her, however, she’s composed herself by pulling a stack of paper’s toward her to grade. That doesn’t stop her from hearing Potter’s response though.
‘They aren’t conscious!’ she takes a deep breath—not knowing how deep the water is—and drops into the water.
She clenches her jaw, sighs, and finally relents. ‘I suppose I could talk to the headmaster,’ she says reluctantly. His face lights up, but she cuts him off sharply before he can say anything more. ‘But
Blaise blinks, apparently confused by Draco’s lack of reaction to all his teasing. ‘No,’ he says, raising an eyebrow. ‘I’m not all talk.’
Albus steps forward, turning to Messers Zabini and Goyle, ‘I know it’s been a shocking morning. May I suggest, as you are both unharmed and primarily bystanders, that you head back to your dorms to recoup from the shock? You are, of course, excused from classes today.’
She almost chuckles, but one look at Potter’s face, (at the lingering frown and the absent minded chewing on the corner of his mouth) gives her pause.
Potter drops down in the seat opposite Draco, a grin plastered firmly in place as he reaches out and snags the book out of Draco’s hands.
‘It’s not like I did it on purpose,’ Potter says to the floor. ‘There wasn’t really time to think. Your head was about to crack open on the ground and all.’
The trunk lid was open, it’s contents scattered across the floor as Theo dug through it. A letter from his father lay discarded on the floor, telling him exactly what to look for. He pulls out more books and pristinely folded clothes, throwing them carelessly around him, mindful of the fact that he only has a limited amount of time before his dorm-mates return.
A few of you noted that the last chapter was a little confusing and I just wanted to clarify a few things because I can't be bothered rewriting it.
Hermione crosses her arms over her chest, looking over at Harry, at Ginny and back again, worrying at her lip with her teeth as she tried to puzzle something out. ‘There’s something that’s been bothering me.’
From there, the invisible, microscopic creatures spreads amongst the sixth years like wildfires—most notably among the Gryffindors and Slytherins.
Malfoy frowns. He looks back at Ron with that stupid superiority, like he thinks he’s better than everything and everyone, and doesn’t move.
Then, almost as if to break the spell, laughter echoes out from further within the building. Neville blinks into the dusk-like light, remembering that he’s not alone.
‘Poor Daphne,’ he says, not even bothering to look up from his magazine. ‘You know, there’s other ways to win the game than just catching the snitch.’
She lets the smirk drop away and reaches out a hand to rest lightly on chest, just above his heart. ‘Look,’ she says. ‘I don’t care if you love him or not, but if you do, if he’s what you really want then don’t fuck it up. For your own good get back in there before you loose him forever and fix whatever the hell has gone wrong between you.’
‘Um, excuse me,’ says Dean, interrupting the girls before the conversation can continue any further. ‘Do you mind maybe
Normally she would call out to him to say hello, but he looks so at ease (despite his sodden state) in his wanderings that she doesn’t have the heart to break him from whatever reverie he’s lost in.
‘Just, don’t twist like that, keep your hand a bit looser and—oh, uh, yes okay that’s better just, oh. Okay, yeah, that’s…’ Draco turns onto his back, stretching out and letting his head fall back onto the ground.
‘Well,’ says Colin, careful to keep his voice low, ‘it seemed…’ he searches for the right word. ‘Personal.’
A wicked smile spreads across the other woman’s face, her eyes glittering behind her glasses. She merely offers Poppy a wink before throwing the floo powder and disappearing back to her own offices.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow. ‘Two minutes ago you were freaking out thinking he was going to tell everyone.’
This time when Harry steps into the room there is no painting. Scorpius is sitting in a magic crib, happily playing with a set of levitating blocks.
Potter nods. ‘Well, like you said. I can do what I like with my things. And right now, this snitch is mine. Why should I give it to you?’
Longbottom catches his expression and promptly flushes. ‘I, er, I just mean…she can be a bit…much...’
‘Few days,’ says Harry tiredly, turning his head and looking off in the opposite direction from Hermione and Ron.
Potter cocks his head. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out the little golden ball and considers it.
Malfoy looks away, stuffing his hands into his pockets and leaning back against the wall again. ‘If we’re caught, it’ll be over in more ways than one. For both of us. That’s something that I really don’t want.’
Pansy raises her eyebrows. ‘Well aren’t we sensitive. I was just asking. Well, I think that’s enough excitement for me. Draco? Are you coming?’
‘I’ll give her back in a minute!’ Harry snaps over his shoulder, the tension rolling off him in waves.
Albus, sensing that Harry's ire is not yet released, pours more magic into the shield, strengthening it enough to not only fix the crack Harry left in it, but make it thicker.
Lisa raises her eyebrows. She slides a piece of parchment out from behind the notes she’s been taking and jots down a few observations. From her previous recordings, she had expected Malfoy to be the cause of Burbage’s inevitable meltdown, but apparently it was Potter’s casual dismissal of her class that was going to break her. The boy tries (and fails spectacularly) to apologise.
Blaise Zabini is guarding the goal posts. He winks at her. She shoots his a wicked grin, rolls to her left and, with a deft flick of her wrist combined with a sudden sharp turn, she smacks the tail end of her broom into the quaffle, sending it spinning off to the right end of the goals—where Zabini isn’t guarding.
Like Malfoy, Potter has several cracked ribs, his nose is broken and he’s covered in varying shades of bruises. It’s the other indicators, however, that fill her with dread. Several of his organs light up in green and his back is covered in layers of pinks and dark red. This isn’t fresh—in fact, from the shades of the colours she’d say they’re several weeks old. Just what in the name of Merlin has he been doing?
Luna pats his arm sympathetically. ‘Did you know that despite their size, erumpent are known to be quite shy?’
That is, until he sees the contemplative—if somewhat amused—arch of her brow, and the small, Slytherin worthy smirk she’s pointing in their direction.
Echos of explosions whisper in Harry’s ears, flashes of red and yellow dart across his vision. He knows it’s not real, that it’s just a memory, and yet nausea churns in his gut as the memories grip at him. He tries to think of something to calm himself down. Anything else.
‘Yeah,’ he says sheepishly and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Sorry. Again. It’s been a shitty few days.’
‘Mistress called?’ she says, and then (noticing the room they are in) jerks in surprise. ‘Are we’s preparing the presents already Mistress? Oh, should I call for dessert?’
The room is quiet. What few remaining students are watching them in various stages of curiosity. Granger says something, but Theo can’t hear it over the rushing in his ears.
‘Mm, I suppose so,’ says Ginny, brown eyes darting over to the table where Harry and Draco Malfoy are actually managing to work on an assignment together.
‘Very well,’ she says. ‘I will refrain from speaking to Mr Potter, provided this doesn’t happen again. You’re in detention together for a reason, if you recall.’
Draco yanks open the bed covers, kneels up on the end of his bed and glares across at Blaise imperiously. ‘Zabini,’ he says, his voice surprisingly matter of fact despite the irritated look on his face. ‘Do you know as much about sex as you claim you do or is this all show?’
Still, Pansy has learned over the years that more often than not, Greg has a fair knowledge of the goings on in their house, and, much to her convenience, crumbles easily under pressure. Especially when neither Vince nor Draco are around to protect.
Draco blinks, staring at the box in mute surprise. He turns it over and the confusion gives way to a smile. It’s slow, at first, but as his gaze lingers over the box, it grows into a laugh.
‘Then I don’t see how they can be friends,’ says Hermione, shaking her head. ‘Harry wouldn’t just be friends with someone on the other side.’
Once the door is shut behind the two, Albus turns back to the room. Harry is looking at him expectantly, arms crossed as he flicks furious glares at Mr Nott (steadfastly avoiding looking at Draco now that he’s awake, Albus notes with interest).
When he does, he traipses into the room with a vacant expression—almost reminiscent of Luna, except for the little frown marring his features.
The door to the Hospital Wing swings open and, of course, in walks Malfoy. He stops at the sight of them all there, eyeing them—Ron—warily.
‘And don’t tell anyone else in the process,’ adds Ginny, her tone still cold. ‘This secret doesn’t leave this room. Not until
‘Alright!’ called Professor Sutton (the new Muggle Studies teacher), clapping her hands together and surveying them all with a bright smile. ‘Have we all gotten food? Excellent. Now, you have three hours the first check in. Have you all got enough tickets? Back up money? Sunscreen? Yes? Excellent. Remember, stay in groups of at least two and if anyone gets lost, I’ll be right over there by the coffee cart grading your mid-year papers—’ here she shot them a cheeky grin and a wink. ‘—Alright, off you go!’
‘Close your eyes,’ she reminds him. ‘Focus on your wand, the texture and how it feels; now, count your breaths.’
Irritation spikes. Along with determination. In response, she braces her arms on his shoulders and uses him to push up out of the water. Surprise lights his face. Right before he’s dunked under the water.
He’s almost at the door to the greenhouse when Harry calls out after him. Panic overwhelms Neville and before he has a chance to think about what he’s doing he dives between a couple of large, bulbous purple blossoms by the greenhouse door. He squeezes his eyes shut and prays that they won’t see him.
Draco rolls his eyes and mutters something under his breathe. ‘Yes, in the middle of the bloody night,’ he says. ‘Merlin, do you
‘Malfoy’s do not throw tantrums,’ she says indignantly. ‘Alright then, let me guess who it is? Pansy? Elanor? Oh the Greengrass girl, she’s quite pretty.’
Laughter echoes around the table, the money and the photos momentarily forgotten in favour of the comfort of friendship—a friendship that started with a bet and ended with a mutual relief that, finally, they could all stop pretending to hate each other.
Draco lets his head fall back against the wall with a thud, trying to make himself stay focused. Potter’s back is taut under Draco’s hands, the tension coming off him in waves.
An older boy stands there, a friendly smile on his face. He’s a seventh year, though Harry’s not sure they’ve ever spoken before.
Ginny, who is already sitting on the bed, grins and reaches out for him, drawing him back against the headboard with her, looping an arm around his shoulders. ‘Who?’ she asks, running a hand through Harry’s hair (rather like one would bet a dog) as he flops back next to her.
Albus steps around to the other side of the bed and begins a complicated spell, pulling the focal point of magic in the castle wards to this section of the school and funnelling it toward the boy, pumping enough magic into the boy’s body to sustain him while Poppy works.
‘I still don’t know how they do that,’ he mutters, glancing around the room for some secret entrance.
Malfoy, meanwhile, is glowering at Potter. His jaw clenches and he flops back onto his bed with a small growl. ‘When can I go?’ he asks the ceiling.
Poppy chuckles. ‘True,’ she says. ‘Still, the quicker things get back to normal in here, the better.’
‘Ron, if you’re a grown up, then I’m a blast-ended skrewt. Now, run along. Milly and I have plans to make…ohhh, we should make best friend bracelets!’
He shrugs at her, stuffing his hands into his pockets. ‘Alright I guess,’ he says. ‘Say, can I talk to you for a minute? Upstairs?’
The Girl, standing back from the two boys, winces, staring at the Speaker with another expression that Blue doesn’t understand. Blue twitches her tail. She wants to understand. She wants to know why her humans are so sad.
Ron glowers back at him and, without even trying to get up, pulls out his own wand. ‘She’s mine,’ Ron declares. ‘I’m in love with her.’
An affliction with no cure. No remedy. No potion. Nothing that will make the disease currently riddling it’s way through Potter’s magic any better. Slowly but surely his condition will worsen.
She sits down, feeling as tired and worn out as Poppy had looked. She opens the front cover, trailing her fingers across the loopy letters inscribing Potter’s name there.
He glances at her, eyes widening as she leans into him, pressing her chest into his arm. ‘Er,’ he says, eyebrows rising. ‘Not sure.’
‘Do they hurt?’ asks Malfoy in a soft voice that Hermione wouldn’t have thought him capable of a year ago.
‘Not without punishment,’ says Minerva, though her tone and expression express the depths of her disapproval and Albus knows he will be hearing about this later. ‘He gave Nott an in-school suspension.’
They sit for a moment in silence. Harry shifts closer to her, their shoulders pressing just close enough to draw comfort, but not enough for Harry to be leaning on her.
‘Damn,’ he mutters and turns sharply, away from his fellow Death Eaters and shoves through the crowd.
Ginny scowls and opens her mouth to no doubt start shouting, but Harry shoots her a sharp look and she falls quiet. He turns back to Ron and says darkly,
‘Drink that for the pain. Half now, half tonight. You’ll be fine,’ he says, and turns to Draco. ‘Alright, lead the way.’
‘Harry, mate, that thing looks like a death trap. Maybe…maybe later yeah? I think Hermione’s right. We should…we should build up to it.’
Daphne glances back at Greg and Vince and winces. ‘Those two are hopeless. I can’t believe they even managed to pass their O.W.L.S.’
When they stop outside the erumpent enclosure, Potter leans forward over the rail, shifting sideways into Malfoy’s personal space almost without realising. The other boy glances at him, but doesn’t shift away. Instead, he leans forward as well, and mutters something to Potter, low and inaudible to Tonks’ ears.
‘Course not,’ says Hagrid with a warm smile. ‘Always happy to have more. Though we’re almos’ finished ‘ere anyway. Just the one stop left.’
‘Oh fuck off, maybe if you weren’t pretending—‘ Malfoy cuts himself off again and scowls furiously. ‘Why don’t you tell them what
She inhales, dropping her gaze to where his hands are clenched in the sheets, twisting them in his anxiety. She looks up at him and he knows the answer before she says it. He can see it. Even in the shadowy darkness, he can see the answer in her eyes.
She smiles nervously, her hands fluttering over her books. ‘Nonsense,’ she says, ducking down to gather up her things. ‘Don’t be silly.’
‘They’ll hurt me anyway,’ says Potter. ‘You think Voldemort cares who I’m dating? He wants me dead. Period.’
. He cannot do this. And I cannot ask him to. I cannot make him do this. He will resent us for the rest of his life and I can’t…I can’t let that happen.’
‘Remus,’ says Kingsley, not looking away from Dora. ‘You taught at Hogwarts. Settle an argument for us. The Slytherins, they’re a fairly…
Harry chews on his lower lip again, and Draco resists the urge to tell him off for it. Instead, he reaches for the scrubbing brush and starts back up on the cauldron—after all, he
‘Well,’ she says. ‘I still have to administer the morning potions, if you’d like to help with that?’
Don't forget, I am now on Tumblr, feel free to head over for updates and sneak peeks:  thejadewritergirl.tumblr.com
Triumph bursts in her chest, but she doesn’t let it show. ‘Oh?’ she asks. ‘That’s very interesting.’
She almost asks him, almost considers offering him some advice, but then Bella enters the room, and there’s a flash of something she doesn’t recognise in Draco’s face when he looks up, a tightening of his jaw at his aunt’s entrance that prevents her from speaking. At least in front of her sister.
Potter’s shoulders slump and he stares at Malfoy helplessly. ‘I…I mean I want to. I’m not sure how they’ll react but…don’t
Draco doesn’t even look at him. ‘Are you done with whatever game you’re playing? I’d rather not stay too long, I might catch something.’
'Don't do this,' says Draco. 'Please. You didn't do it. Everyone will think you tried to kill me and- Well it's not right, okay? You didn't do anything wrong.'
A feeling of foreboding settles into Ron’s gut like a boulder. He continues to the Hospital Wing, his dread over the conversation he came to have increasing with every step. What was Malfoy so upset about? Obviously it has something to do with Harry, and that only makes Ron feel worse.
‘Over here,’ says Ginny, paddling to the spot where she can still see Malfoy. ‘Careful, the water stings.’
‘This,’ says Zach, holding up the item with an ominous expression, ‘is an extremely dangerous device. It can
excited,’ Ron had griped when Harry and Ron had received their time-tables and realised they’d been sorted into different rooms. ‘You get to get away from Lavender and Parvati. We
They’re completely alone, but for the chattering of several birds, rustling about in the leaves above them. Draco relishes the solitude. Free from secrets and lies. Free from having to hide every feeling and emotion. Free from Weasley’s stupid stare.
Draco sighs heavily, glaring off toward the forest. His jaw clenches, a sure indication that he’s chosen to pretend she doesn’t exist. Well, she can’t have that. Straight to the point then.
‘Ugh.’ Ron mutters something unpleasant and scathing under his breath, but Harry hears the tell-tale sound of blankets being thrown back and grins in victory.
‘What Lovegood is trying to say,’ he says dryly, shooting a half smirk in her direction. ‘Is that we’re going to the record room.’
‘Oh,’ says Blaise, still smirking at Ginny. ‘I’m sure we’ll think of something. Potter and Draco can’t be the
Ron stares at them, unable to think of any words to say. He’s so angry his entire body is hot. He simultaneously wants to yell at Harry and punch Malfoy. His chest heaves and it physically hurts to try and keep his breathing under control.
‘Well, maybe,’ says Hermione, brushing a lock of curly hair behind her shoulder. ‘They’ve only fought like this once before but…well, this isn’t like then. They’re not really fighting so much as Ron isn’t speaking to Harry. Harry is desperate to fix it, but for whatever reason, I can’t get him to talk about it.’
‘And yet,’ says Blaise, and gestures at Colin. ‘You somehow managed to con Camera-Boy here into following them around for a whole night. Tell me, how
'Long enough to know the Chosen One is a poofter,' he says, smirking. 'Oh, this is going to be good.'
‘You know,’ says Dean through clenched teeth. ‘I tried. I really did. I told myself it wasn’t true. That they were just rumours.’ He shakes his head. ‘Did you really think you could get away with this?’
She’s not sure precisely what she needs to finish her essay, but she’ll know it when she sees it. She always does.
Harry, mid-roll, throws his broom around, spinning in a dizzying 180 turn and racing off after the snitch. Malfoy curses, flicks his broom sideways and makes chase.
Poppy raises an eyebrow. ‘Really?’ she asks. ‘You’re not even curious about what happened out there?’
The girl leans on the corner of the table, looking down at Harry with a wide smile and batting her eyes at him rather like she has something caught in them.
Molly hesitates, hovering between going to Harry and offering him the comfort he clearly needs and minding her own business.
‘You know what he means,’ she says, giving him a soft, reassuring smile. ‘You know we love you no matter what.’
Harry runs a hand through his hair, agitation written all over his features. His eyes dart around the room and he shrugs.
?’ Draco asks. Another burst of pleasure flows through him and the thought of stopping makes the tension worse. Everything tightens. ‘Shit, just…hang on. Can you…Just a bit more, please?’
Archie chuckles. ‘I thought the yellow house was supposed to be for the meek ones? I think maybe he’s in the wrong house,’ he says this to Hagrid.
Potter and Malfoy glance at each other, but whatever unspoken thing is hanging between them have them glancing away quickly, despite their obvious excitement. Poppy shakes her head.
‘Yeah,’ says Harry. ‘But Neville says a lot of magical plants respond to feelings. And you’re a grumpy old fart, so it’s no wonder they like me best.’
Malfoy sits up, slowly, still giving Harry that wide eyed stare and Harry thinks he might throw up. Or pass out. He’s not entirely sure which, only that his insides have just turned to jelly and his brain is short circuiting over the monumental realisation that he’s just kissed Draco Malfoy.
‘The item I chose,’ she says, and is relieved that her voice isn’t as shaky as she feels, ‘is a Muggle Camera. Even though it looks really different, they work pretty much the same way ours do, except this one prints the photo out as well. I think. I didn’t actually manage to get it to work. Um, anyway, that’s uh, mostly it. Does anyone have any questions?’
