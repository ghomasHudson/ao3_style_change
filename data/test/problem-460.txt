Blaise held him with both his arms. "I don't know Dray. I do know that Harry is not the world. You're still you without him in it. And I know it's terrible right now and you feel like you'll never feel happy again. But I promise you that you won't feel like this forever." Draco just cried more, and Blaise let him.
"Hey, Draco. Everyone's wondering where you are. You've been in here for a while." Harry said, sounding concerned.
"I didn't remember last night... but Dra- Malfoy showed me his memories..." They stared awkwardly at each other.
"Why so tense, Potter?" Draco started. He had to admit, he loved the way Harry's face looked right now, blushing and glowing. "Never seen two people kiss before?"
"Hello, Draco." Harry said, very formally. It struck a nerve through Draco but he decided to ignore it.
Nothing made sense... he was into Draco just a few weeks ago and now he was having secret trysts with the girl Weasley? He had to talk to Blaise about this tomorrow. He made his way back to his own common room only to have Pansy shouting at him for being a complete and utter git for leaving in the middle of her story.
"Hey... can I speak to you two about something?" Harry asked, fidgeting with his hands. Hermione looked up, putting on a confused face, but lightly smirking.
"Like you all weren't just as bad as me before you started sucking the Gryffindor's dicks, eh Malfoy?" Goyle sneered.
- fine with it... if anyone asked. He headed to his dorm where he'd hoped Ron would be- luckily he could kill two birds with one stone since Hermione was in there as well. Also luckily- they weren't making out like last time he walked in on them, they were just studying.
"You see, for about a year and a half the Dark Lord lived at my house. Meaning he was there every day. He tortured people in front of my eyes and if I made an effort to stop he would kill my mother and then me... so sure, everyone has a choice. And I made the choice to protect my mother. I got this," Draco pulled up his sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark, "so my mother wouldn't die, so that I wouldn't die." He rolled his sleeve down and gripped the Firewhiskey from Ron and took a long swig.
Thankfully, with his sprinting towards the Great Hall, Blaise, Pansy, Millie and Crabbe were headed his way, so he could stop running and tell them the news.
He hoped no one had seen, but Draco let a few tears fall during Harry's speech. He wanted more than anything to just run up to him and hug him, and tell him that no one was ever going to hurt him again. But, he couldn't. So he just sat there. Draco couldn't believe that Harry thought that way. The poor kid actually thought everything was his fault.
"You kind of did... and you have every right to do that if you weren't happy. But... you were. You are bloody in love with that bloke and you've been miserable since you broke up with him."
Classes were finally over and he could head to the common room and just relax- oh shit he forgot... The Bonding Thing. Well, so much for relaxing... He decided he didn't want to be in the common just yet and took the long way back.
"Er, yeah. Just in case something like this ever happened... and I'm pretty sure Hermione already knew anyway."
"I mean, it was very embarrassing on his part." Harry rolled his eyes and guessed the next voice to be Blaise.
"We uh- we didn't want to risk it. Anyway, I need to go change and I'm sure Harry does too, so be back in a jiffy." They both rushed upstairs. Draco put on one of his nicest outfits, gelled his hair back, and hoped he didn't look as fucked as he did 5 minutes ago.
Draco was ready for this ruddy day to just be over already. He skipped lunch, not really wanting to deal with anyone and when classes were done made his way to the 8th year common room. He saw Pansy sitting on the couch talking to Millicent Bulstrode about something he probably wouldn't have any interest in.
"How long have we been together?" He joked, and kissed her on the cheek. Harry looked at them longingly...
"We might even just hold hands and sing friendship songs for all we know, she is a Gryffindor after all." Blaise said.
alsoooo i have hermione's pov in this chapter because i thought it would be fun, let me know if you like that or if i should stick to harry and draco's.
"Weird... I was with Pansy chatting last night and she went up to bed after  you left the common room and I don't believe I heard you come into our room last night..." Draco was loving this. Blaise was glaring daggers at him and Draco was about to open his mouth to say something but a certain green-eyed, black-haired, beautiful wizard caught his eye.
After what seemed like hours of teaching Luna how to play, they played a few rounds of one on one. Soon enough the sun started to set and that meant that dinner was either soon or they were missing it. He sat down to catch his breath for a moment.
"Save it. You're shagging Potter, right?" She said. Draco gave her a glare, but shook his head for yes.
"You think I'm worried about Sluggy? You've met my girlfriend, right? She's gonna kill us." Harry took a bite of toast, handed it to Ron, and took the quickest shower of his life. He rushed into his robes and out the door, shoving the bacon and toast into his mouth.
Draco watched Blaise just standing outside the portrait door for about 5 minutes until he heard it open. And, you can't blame him for being completely and totally stunned  to see him grabbing Ginny Weasley's hand and walking her in the other direction.
"Well, you weren't at breakfast this morning and neither was Draco and after the whole...," Ron lowered his voice, "you know... kiss thing last night... I guess a bunch of people started talking about you and him and well..."
"Well... you two are together aren't you? I saw you... ya know... making out the-the other day." Harry looked down at his feet while Blaise just laughed.
"I missed you too, Gin." And he pulled her in for a short, but loving kiss. "Sorry, were you getting ready to shower?"
Ron looked at her. At this beautiful, intelligent, brave woman staring at him like he was everything. Telling
But he also didn't understand what he was talking about. Draco could say with utmost confidence that he didn't have a crush on anyone... maybe...
"Oh what? You can't enjoy love because you are too busy ogling over You -Know -Who... And not Voldemort everyone!" Pansy laughed while Draco blushed madly.
"It's delicious." Draco said, before attacking Harry's neck again. Harry wanted to taste Draco so he grabbed his face and flipped them around, bringing their mouths together intensely. Draco had no complaints because he loved Harry being pressed against him. The hotness of Harry at his front and the cold of the wall on his back was simply incredible. He felt on fire with arousal. But, Harry pulled away and Draco almost collapsed from the sudden loss of contact.
Damn Potter for being so cute, Draco thought. He really wasn't going to make this easy on him was he?
He looked at Draco, not with pity, but with a mutual understanding. Harry knew about nightmares alright. He used to use silencing charms too until one morning when Ron was calling for Harry and pulled his curtains open only to find Harry in the midst of one screaming silently. Ron made Harry promise to never use them again.
Hello again! In this chapter it's the day from the last chapter and everything that happened but from Draco's POV. Also, I have included pretty much the whole lot of Slytherins and people from Harry's year because we need some involvement with students and I think their last year was pretty awful so a lot would come back anyway.
"Shove off, Zabini" was all Harry could say as he tried to figure out if Blaise could see the blush that he felt blossoming on his cheeks.
"Right. Harry... are you going to be okay without us there?" Hermione asked him. "I feel terrible. You are welcome to come too."
Draco looked at Blaise, then at Ron and Harry. He, of course, wanted to be with Harry...but he didn't want to say anything in case Harry didn't want to be with him. He gave Blaise a look like
"Uh-... you! You know... and your girlfriend. Yeah..." Harry looked at him disbelievingly, but then shrugged.
Hermione kissed Ron and then headed up to her dorm. Draco was about to go to his room when Ron stepped in front of him.
All of a sudden it hit Draco like a smack in the face. No way, Draco thought, he's dating a Gryffindor? It would explain why he's being so secretive about it, especially if he or she is younger.
"Very well done! It was perfectly executed. Congratulations, Mr. Weasley, and Miss. Parkinson- very worthy opponent. I don't have anything else for you all; have the rest of the class to do as you please." Bill waved, walked by the trio and winked. "Mr. Potter may I speak with you please?" Harry looked at Hermione and Ron and shrugged and followed Bill out the door.
"Alright 8th years, how the hell are ya? I know you guys think this class is a waste since the war, but there are always things to learn. As for today, we are just going to be dueling. Any volunteers? Anyone at all?" Bill exuded excellence and was an astounding teacher.
"Anyway... it's not like anything is going to happen. We're too different and there's too much history."
Luna, as if reading Draco's mind, said "I am friends with the kitchen Elves. I'm sure they would make us some dinner if we missed it", taking a seat next to him she picked up a clover from the grass and began picking off the leaves.
"I was just making sure you weren't uh- up to no good or something." God dammit why did Harry have to be so fucking cute.
hope you enjoyed! next chapter won't be up for a few days, still working on it! leave a kudos and a comment!
All of a sudden Harry woke up and realized he had fallen asleep right on Hermione's lap. He shot up and Hermione laughed.
"I-we... I apologized... and then I hugged him and he hugged me back and it was... nothing. Calm down."
"No... Draco and I aren't... well, we were making out... but we aren't together. I like him, but he has the hots for someone else." Harry looked up.
Blaise did a sad smile as he followed Draco with his eyes and shared a knowing look with Pansy. The other students in the Great Hall looked around in confusion because - did Draco Malfoy just follow Harry Potter outside the Great hall, that's weird.
"Alright, don't tell me. I'll find out eventually," she looked at him with a loving expression, "Please don't stop being my friend, Harry. I think I'll always need you in my life."
Forgot his quill? Yeah, right. Draco thought. Blaise had never kept a secret from him, and he'd be damned if he thought he was going to start now. Draco got up, ignoring Pansy's protests and promptly followed Blaise out of the common room.
"No more remarks about me, Drakey?" Blaise cooed, quietly so only Draco could hear his taunts. "Saviour got your tongue? Hmm...well, I guess you wish?" Draco kicked him under the table and muttered a 'shut up' before indulging in his eggs.
"Unfortunately, I don't have the same curfew as you all, but I would love to come until curfew hits." Luna said. "May we invite Ginny as well? It'd be nice to include her."
“Draco, c’mon you’re killing yourself. Don’t you realize that the longer you let this go on without being honest the worse you’ll get hurt?” There was a look of desperation in Pansy’s eyes. Perhaps
After lunch the day went on as normal. They had Charms, History of Magic and then Defense Against the Dark Arts. In DADA they took their usual places.
"Yep." Pansy looked pretty pleased with her eavesdropping skills. Draco however felt like he was going to upchuck all over his friend. This was all way too much to take in right now. First, he finally admits that he likes... Potter... and now there's that slight chance that, if he ever broke up with Ginny... not likely considering they're in love... that he had a shot.
and he knew Pansy was right. But he was too weak to stop seeing Harry… he couldn’t be the one to end it.
"What do you mean, Gin? I'm good." Harry replied nervously. How could he talk about all this with Ginny... of all people.
"Oh... well... I'm not too sure you want to hear it," Draco laughed, "you were quite insane." Harry blushed.
"Ah, Mister Potter I'm so glad you could join us," Slughorn started, "10 points from Gryffindor for being late and disrupting my class. Take a seat next to Mister Zabini please."
"Yep. Fine. I'm tired, please don't make out in here I'm going to bed. 'Night." He made his way towards his bed.
"I don't think so. I think that's natural. You're not always going to fancy the same person forever, I mean, we're young. And you're not- I mean... your friend's not a bad person if they don't marry this girl... or guy." There was an awkward silence before Harry answered.
The non answer she got from Draco was as clear as if he would have screamed it from the rooftops. She just gave him a look that made Draco trust her implicitly. Fucking Gryffindors...
, that’s what he’d be. He realized that when Harry suggested the friends with benefits, and he knows it now more than ever. Whatever Harry needs, he’ll be.
"Harry? Ow! Merlin, my head." He said, rubbing his temples. Harry laughed softly and handed him the hangover potion.
"Good... I'm, uh, glad we can agree on something. You were, most definitely, a prat." Harry smiled a big smile and he and Ron just fell into their normal steps, talking about nothing and everything. He was finally starting to feel like himself again. There was just one more problem... what the hell is he going to do about Draco?
"Harry said he wanted to stop seeing me." Draco said, trying to keep his cool. "He said that he thinks we have very different feelings for each other and that it would be in both of our best interests if we stopped it now. I just... I don't know what to do, Blaise. I love him. I'm in love with him." He couldn't hold in the tears anymore and he broke down and cried into Blaise's chest. "What do I do?" he asked in a choked sob.
"Mister Malfoy... I am well aware when holidays start in my own school." She said, a certain look in her eyes. "I will see you boys tomorrow morning." She walked into the infirmary with a swish of her cloak.
"I'm sure whatever I did is worse, so no judgement from me. I promise." Draco smiled and tapped his forehead with his wand bringing the memory out in a clear airy substance. He dropped it into the pensieve and Harry pushed his head down into it, silently praying that he would still have some dignity intact after watching it.
Things have been weird at Hogwarts this Holiday. I mean, it's Hogwarts so it's always a bit odd. Draco likes staying here, going home is a last resort. Hogwarts is the only constant in his life quite honestly and he loves it- except; why the hell does Luna Lovegood sit by him at every single meal? Every one without fail Luna is right there sitting next to Draco.
"No... I've never... obviously, that's why I didn't drink. Moving on..." Harry said looking down from Ron's eyes.
"Sorry... I'm sorry. I think I just need some air, Ok? Don't wait up." Harry grabbed his invisibility cloak and walked out the door.
"Go talk to him, Draco. You're going to regret it if you don't." Blaise said. He was right... he needed to find Harry.
"Easy. My eleventh birthday. That's when everything changed, that's when... when my life felt like it mattered... it probably sounds dumb to you, right?" Harry was looking down at his lap, seemingly very self-conscious about himself.
Harry blushed, in all honesty? He was staring at Draco. He didn't know why but he felt drawn to him for some reason. Since last night he was curious about the blonde haired boy and why he seemed so different this year. Harry had to admit that Draco was really attractive... he was the type of handsome that wasn't thrown in your face but everyone was well aware of. Harry realized it has been a long few seconds since Ginny asked him.
"Wh-why... why would you just assume it had something to do with Harry?" Draco asked, feeling small. Was he that obvious?
"Yes!" Harry said all too quickly. "Uh, yes, I'm fine. Thanks for coming to check on me." The fact that Draco took the time out of his day to come make sure he was okay... that just made Harry's stomach do backflips. Maybe he likes me as much as I like him? Or... maybe he's just friends with Hermione now and he wants to be nice...
"Hermione, we're probably going to need more Firewhiskey." Draco said after a long pause. She pulled another bottle from her purse.
He went to Potions a good deal later than class started. He walked in and the class turned their attention from Slughorn to Harry.
"Ron, I told you what Draco said to me. He was serious. Just drop your hatred for them already, we're not children anymore. We fought in a war together."
They practically ran to the Eighth Year common room and when they got in there pretty much everyone, minus a few, were there waiting to leave.
He couldn't quite believe this was real. He kept looking around, trying to find the joke... the prank. He isn't this lucky. He's not this fortunate. He doesn't deserve this wonderful man sitting next to him, smiling with that- he certainly doesn't deserve that smile.
For some reason, Draco blushed at that. It was just the idea that his friend, who also had a crush on him, sitting next to Harry freaking Potter who he ... well we've been over this... Oh, who was he kidding? He liked Potter, god dammit. It suddenly made all the sense in the world why he was always so jealous of Ginny...He's an idiot.
This day was not going at all how Harry had originally thought. First, Draco apologized to him, then they shared this intimate hug... moment... thing... and now every time he looked at Draco he got this weird feeling in the pit of his stomach.
While walking back to their common room Draco pulled Harry back. Blaise and Ron looked back, smirks on their faces.
"Nice hickeys, Potter." Blaise said. Draco was tempted to turn around and slap Blaise but again, that would be obvious...
"Okay, okay... I get it. I understand that you don't feel like that, but you have to admit that's why everyone else is drawn to me."
"Why? Maybe because I've had to sit with my best friend for 2 days, wiping his tears and holding him as he cried into my arms. I'm sorry, but I've never seen Draco more hurt than how I've seen him the past few days. How can we even be sure that Potter has real feelings for him?" Blaise said, looking expectantly at Ron and Hermione.
"Hermione's right. I mean, just think of everything you did with the DA in fifth year! You were basically a professor right then and there. Have a bit of faith in yourself, mate." Ron added.
Harry had been so concerned about Ron and Hermione being missing, he didn't even realize that the Hogshead was empty besides himself and a few workers. He looked around and not a single soul was dining. He turned the corner and saw a beautiful sight. There were flowers and candles set on a table with a beautiful tablecloth. There were pillows surrounding the table in colors of red and green...
? How is anything supposed to happen if you don't? Look, I know you say he doesn't like you and, whatever, maybe he doesn't. But, you're never going to know for sure unless you talk to him about it. Look at 'Mione and me, huh? I mean I was
"You may not have blood family, but you have a family that you've chosen, and who've chosen you too. In a way, that's better. You're not just stuck with people that you share blood with- you were chosen, and not in an almighty way... in a love way."
"And by normal, we mean embarrassingly goo-goo over Potter again." Pansy said, smirking. "So, Weasley. When do we start?"
Draco rubbed his temple. "Well...if you-uh... if you must know... I-well... Potter, I swear to Merlin if you repeat this to anyone I'll hex your balls off, but I have nightmares... really bad ones were I end up screaming most nights... and well I'm not allowed to use spells outside of class on my probation... so I can't use a silencing charm..." Draco didn't know how to continue and now it was Harry's turn to stare.
"I don't know how to start other than, I'm sorry." Harry started. "I can't believe I said those things to you and I can't imagine you'd even want to forgive me... I never wanted to-" Harry was talking a mile a minute, but Ron cut him off.
"Yeah, 'fraid so." Ron said sadly. They sat in comfortable silence until Dean and Seamus walked down and plumped themselves right next to Ron, across from Draco.
He looked up at Draco with a look of sad understanding. "You, uh- you don't like me.. that way. Right?" Blaise looked down at his lap.
"I think we have completely different feelings for each other and I don’t want either of us to get hurt and this is killing me but I have thought a lot about it and I think it’s in the best interest for both of us if we end this now.” Harry said in one breath.
When the applause died down Harry said "Thank you, Draco... that was-that meant... just, thank you." Draco gave him a smile because he knew if he spoke he would sound very choked up.
"Oh, uh-uh- nothing... just daydreaming I guess." she shrugged and he thanked God that he was off the hook. Ginny got up and continued "I gotta head to Defense, some students want to practice before class, I'll see you guys." and she kissed Harry's cheek.
Now, Harry would tell you that it is very hard to shock him. After all, he spent most of his childhood in a war so there was really nothing that anyone could do to surprise him at this point. Or, so he thought.
"I mean, no shit you like Potter! Am I your best friend? Are you an idiot? Both answers are yes, by the way."
"You took Muggle Studies, right? Romeo and Juliet?" Ginny looked at her, as if telling her to explain. "Romeo and Juliet came from rivaling families. Nobody thought they would work together because they were just too different. Juliet said that; meaning that no matter what you call a rose, it will still smell like a rose- so, what's in a name?"
"Draco... I wasn't brought up in the Wizarding World. But, I do know that growing up in a Pure-Blood family, like your own, things were shoved down your throat and you were forcibly taught all the wrong things. Just the fact that you apologized to me proves that you're not an awful human being," Hermione took Draco's hands as she said this last part, "and I forgive you."
"I've never, in all my years! And Eighth Years no less! You all should be ashamed of yourself... violence never solves anything! You all have 3 weeks detention starting tomorrow! No exceptions!" McGonagall was yelling at them right outside the infirmary, where they had all just been treated for their wounds.
Draco watched as Harry left the Great Hall. For some reason Draco's brain stopped working and he got up without even realizing it and followed him.
“I’m sorry. But I do want us to still be friends.” Ah… the dreaded F word. Friends? How could he be friends with Harry after he had him the way he did? After he kissed his skin and kissed his lips and well… you know. Harry took his virginity for crying out loud! How could he know exactly how Harry kisses, how he tastes, and not be able to do anything about it? It would kill him.
"Me either. I never thought you felt the same way about me. But, it's happened. I love you." Harry said, so blunt, so easy... so right.
"No. That would be someone who wasn't really your best friend. I am always honest... and honestly? You're an idiot. Falling for Potter? Dumbest thing you could do. Well, except for me...falling for my best friend." Blaise had a joking tone but still, Draco could tell there was more to the playful theme.
"I'm fine. I just don't think this bonding thing is such a bad idea. Everyone is aware of each other's existence but we're all just tip-toeing around one another. Maybe if we-" Suddenly Draco wasn't talking anymore and Blaise's mouth was on his and he didn't even have time to protest since Blaise sort of shoved him onto the bench that was next to him.
Draco looked at him for a moment, just staring at Harry. He was taking in all of his features. His strong jawbone and wild mess of black hair...some strands were sticking up and some fell in his face but he still managed to look fucking perfect...Harry cleared his throat awkwardly and Draco realized he must have been staring. He blushed but it was barley noticeable, and he tried to remain cool and collected.
"Mate, like I said, tell him how you feel. Like, I would know what the bloody prick is thinking." Ron said exhaustively... this had been going on for approximately an hour.
"Having Potions first thing in the morning is like a crime, don't ya think?" Ron asked him. Harry thought about it. A few months ago he wouldn't have said
"Yes you are if you seriously think Potter doesn't like you. God, men are idiots I swear. Thank Merlin I don't have to deal with this. Potter has the major hots for you, you complete and utter wanker."
"Greg, we all want to forget about the horrors of The Dark Lord. Yeah he bribed us and manipulated us... but that's all bullshit like Draco said. You can continue your hate and keep being a spoiled, obnoxious prick... but the rest of us?," she glanced around to the Slytherins all around her, "we're going to take a lesson from the heroes." Pansy said.
Just as Harry was leaning in to kiss him, someone entered the washroom and the two boys pulled apart quickly.
"Ron... if my life made sense, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you about how I'm in love with-" Harry froze, terrified of what he was just about to say. "How I'm... just..." It was no use. Ron knew him well enough... he probably knew without Harry accidentally admitting it. He was irrefutably in love with Draco Malfoy. Fuck.
"He didn't even care Ron. I thought that maybe he'd be a little hurt by what happened, but he remained totally stone cold. I mean I thought that he'd at least be a little sad. But maybe I wasn't even that good at sex. So, I guess he's not missing out on anything since he didn't have real feelings for me, not even sexual!" Harry couldn't help but laugh. The man he loved not loving him back, like he was in a movie. Or a sad character in one of the muggle novels Aunt Petunia had lying around where the character loses the love of their life.
Draco was pretty sure he wasn't breathing right, and may never breathe right again because Harry Potter was single and evidently bisexual and likes someone else. Could that 'someone else' be him? Should he get his hopes up?
A few more people spoke and Harry was very determined to not talk at 'The Bonding Thing'. He didn't know what to say. Harry had lost more people than you can count on one hand. But, so had everyone. Harry fought in a war. But, so had everyone. Sure, he was The Chosen One, but that didn't make him any better than anyone else. People knew his story, it was in ever article for months...
I wanted to set up these two boys' kiss... or almost kiss (;  Next chapter will be Harry trying to put pieces together.
"Can you at least tell me how? This isn't like us, Blaise. We don't keep things like this from each other." Draco was trying not to feel hurt by all the secrecy, but it was hard. Could Blaise not trust him?
"C'mon Draco, there's gotta be something you haven't done. Jeez..." Pansy said, laughing. Draco blushed and sent a death glare her way. A few people joined in on the laughter which just made him blush more.
"Inter.....interesting...uh... that's cool... uh, that's good. Uh, I'm gonna go and find Blaise he was gonna lend me a ... a... a- thing... so I gotta go. It was... uh, good... talking to you, I'll see you around? Okay, bye." And he got up and practically ran out of the common room.
After that whole ordeal the day went on fairly normal up until after dinner. Harry didn't particularly want to see anyone and not for any reason just because he felt like being alone. He went up the his dorm grabbed the cloak and Marauder's map and went on his way.
"Of course I have, Malfoy. I just don't particularly want to think about your's or Zabini's mouth." Harry replied, impressed with himself that he didn't stutter at all.
anyway, hope you enjoyed it! leave a kudos and a comment about what you'd like to see in the next chapter.
He needed to find Ron and apologize. Harry didn't have words for how terrible and humiliated he felt, but he did have one question. Before he showed the memory Draco said "Don't think differently about me after you see it." After watching the memory Harry was confused. What did Draco have to be embarrassed of?
"I don't know why he won't just tell me what's wrong. I have been begging him to for days but all I get is 'I'm fine, Ron'. He's clearly not fine."
Potions came along and for once, Harry wasn't dreading it completely. Sure, he still was terrible at it, but he knew he'd see Draco... and for some reason that was comforting instead of the past annoyance. To be honest, he's been avoiding Draco for these past few weeks. Maybe not avoiding... but definitely not looking for him. It was time for him to just face his fears, I mean that's what Gryffindors do, right?
"Of course that's what I want..." There was a long pause. How was he supposed to talk about how much he liked Harry when he couldn't even find the words to say it? "I just... I don't want just a shag buddy... I... I don't know."
"No one is as shocked as we are babe." Ron said. "So we're staying at mine for week one and yours for week two- right?" Ron asked her.
"Lemon drops." Harry said and smiled sadly to himself and then watched as the office revealed itself.
"Why do you sit by me everyday?" Draco blurts out, startling Luna from the paper she was reading, no doubt.
"Don't give me that bullshit, Harry! I'm your best friend. I've known you for 8 years. You think I haven't noticed something's been going on? When I ask again I don't want you to lie to me. What was that about?"
"Yes, Gr-Hermione?" He felt rather odd saying that but sort of happy when he saw Hermione genuinely smile up at him.
"I think I'll like it better when a few words are changed... but I suppose it's much to early to think about that." Harry said, grasping the sides of Draco's face, one hand cascading through Draco's hair. Draco was trying to suppress his maddening blush, but couldn't.
"I'm fine, don't worry about me." Draco said quickly. He looked back and saw Blaise in his usual spot with his legs extended on the empty chair, he was talking to Pansy and laughing about something.
"Yeah, but he flipped a switch! He went from calling him 'Malfoy' and hating him to having a crush on him and calling him 'Draco'. Weird!"
"Uh... well, Neville... that sounds brilliant. We will, well most of us, will be there." Pansy said.
"I- yeah. We've had sex. But, only once. We decided it was too soon for that and we just... do other things..." Harry groaned internally, and probably externally, about this terribly, horrific and embarrassing conversation.
"Well... we tried to deny them, of course, but there were already so many crazy things being said... people didn't really believe us." Blaise said, awkwardly. Blaise is a pretty go with the flow person and takes a lot to make him feel uncomfortable... but I suppose it would be weird hearing stories about a guy who you have a crush on with some guy he has a crush on. ...And now Draco was hating himself again for the whole 'Blaise' situation.
Harry looked at the two of them incredulously, "And when did this pot smoking take place that I didn't know about?" Hermione looked sort of guilty, but Harry was only kidding, really.
Harry needed to find Draco. It was the only thing that would solve his memory issues and Hermione's strange behavior.
Draco looked back up and Seamus had already moved on to something else, but he made eye contact with Hermione, who had a look in her eyes he couldn't really decipher.
What's wrong with him? Blaise is so amazing and just look at how attractive he is! This is ridiculous. A boy as wonderful and gorgeous as Blaise likes him and he, for some unknown reason, doesn't like him back. Blaise must have felt Draco's eyes on him and looked up into his own. He gave Draco a genuine smile and went back to his conversation with Pansy.
"Don't take this the wrong way but... how did this happen? You just confessed to me the other week about your feelings... well I guess it's been about a month or so... but you know what I mean. And now you are hooking up with Ginny Weasley? I'm not mad... just confused and worried for you..." Draco trailed off.
until I finally got off my high horse and we talked about it. I'm not saying you have to tell the bloke you
He went all over the castle looking for Draco since he wasn't in the common room. He checked the Great Hall- nothing. He checked the library- nothing. He checked the locker rooms- nothing! Then, it hit him. Draco had taken it to sleeping in the Room of Requirement every night... perhaps he was still asleep. He made sure he had the other hangover potion Hermione gave him and made his way.
"Well!? Are you just being a freak and watching me sleep? One of your weird fantasies, Potter?" Draco smirked, hoping to make Potter blush at the insinuation.
Harry sure knew how to shut up a room. Hermione grabbed his hand halfway through his speech and hadn't let go yet. No one had any idea what to say to that, and everyone sat in an awkward silence for a few moments.
He tried to walk by without uh, interrupting them, but they were sitting right by the stairs which Harry needed to walk up in order to get where he was going.  And, Harry being who he is, sort of stumbled as he was heading that way.
announced that if he unlocked the door Draco would attack him and asked him to sleep in Ginny's room tonight.
"Then why did you break it off with me?" Draco asked desperately. "Why did you- you said we had different feelings for each other... I-."
"Brilliant. Ornaturique!" Draco had his eyes closed and then looked down at his arm. The Dark Mark was ugly, and horrible and reminded him of all that he hated about himself. But, after Voldemort died, it faded. It was now just a light grey, but still clearly there. What Luna did- made it actually look... pretty. There were multi-coloured flowers all around and over the Dark Mark with vines connecting them all. It was beautiful, Draco thought. He had never seen anything so beautiful. He could where a short sleeved shirt without feeling like he'd throw up. He could be... intimate with Harry without fear that he'll see it and be revolted... it was... well how many times can someone say beautiful before it looses it's meaning? Draco actually felt like tearing up a bit.
But knowing that you were still out there, after that day when you lot were captured," he gestured to Ron and Hermione as well, "and I knew for a fact that you were alive... you gave me hope without even trying."
"We're good. You're my friend. I'll just find another girl or guy to pine desperately for..." he laughed, "See ya."
"Being an areshole is not a Slytherin trait." Blaise said, rising from his seat to meet Goyle in height. "In case you need to be reminded of them, Slytherins are ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. And, yes, we do tend to have highly developed senses of self-preservation. But, nowhere in the entire Wizarding World does it say that you're an arse if you're in Slytherin. That's a Goyle thing, I'm afraid." Blaise said.
Blaise spoke, "I'll go. Never Have I Ever ... smoked pot." A good amount of people took drinks, including Ron and Hermione!
"Untrue. I was just an arrogant prick. I was brought up that way and never taught anything different. I never actually believed in all that rubbish without my father pushing it down my throat. It's bullshit. No one is better than anyone else just because our cousins fucked each other. I mean that makes no goddamn sense. You're an idiot Goyle." Draco said.
"Save it, Malfoy. I get it. We're attracted to each other; it'd be a shame to waste it just because we don't have feelings for each other, right?" Harry said, bluntly. Draco was stunned, and... hurt. Harry really didn't have feelings for him at all? He just wanted to shag?
Draco went to his room to grab a book and went back out to the common room. He sat in a chair directly next to where Blaise was and started reading.
"Hi mate, want to study with us?" Ron said as Harry walked in the room, eyeing him strongly for, what Harry assumed to be, an out on studying.
"How do you-!?" He cut himself off from screaming too loud... "How do you know about Ginny and I?" He said again, quieter.
"I don't! I know that you would support me if I decided I wanted to-... call him 'Draco'... I just... was being a prat and I'm sorry." They both knew this was one of those situations where they were saying one thing but talking about something completely different.
Ron grabbed the bottle from Draco's hand and took a sip. "Something that bothers me is when people," he looked directly at Draco, "don't take responsibility for their actions. Everyone has a choice."
"Pans, I think you'll forgive me when out when I tell you what I found out." He smirked and her expression changed.
cry in front of Harry. Not now. So, Harry knew Draco was in love with him and he didn’t want to continue because of it… how did he figure it out? He thought that he played it off as just sexual attraction, but it didn’t work the way he thought, obviously.
"Well, for example, I'd say something like 'Harry, What Are The Odds that you'll kiss Hermione's armpit' and you would say 1 in 15, and then I would count down 3,2,1 and we would both say a number in that range of 15. If we say the same number you'd have to kiss Hermione's armpit, but if we don't you're in the clear. The highest range you can go is 15. The lowest is 5. Who's in?"
"I can't help it, Ron! It's not something that you can just flip in your mind. It's subconscious! I can't control how I feel about someone!"
"We're not sure. He's been off for a few weeks..." Hermione gave him a look that said I know exactly what's wrong but I think Ron's head would explode if he knew.
There was awkward silence for what seemed like an eternity and then Ron, of all people, started clapping. This triggered everyone else to begin and eventually it was just an eruption of applause. Draco blushed profusely.
"I mean, I think it's pretty ridiculous but since McGonagall wants us to, I guess we have to," Gregory Goyle said as he was piling sausage into his mouth, "what do you think Draco?"
Blaise glanced at Draco and then spoke up, "I'm bored. Let's play 'What Are The Odds'" he said, smirking.
"Harry you really don't know how beautiful you are do you? You're lovely. I mean... I don't know why you wouldn't believe me. Coming from me it should mean the most."
A few minutes later Draco had calmed down,but he was still resting his head against Blaise's chest. "I'm so sorry if this is how I made you feel Blaise." Draco said.
"How do you know? I mean, really? What kind of indications have you gotten from him? He  continues to hook up with you, he thinks you're attractive and he wears your hickeys like trophies! That sounds to me as if he
I loved writing this chapter. Also, the soulmate thing between Ron and Harry- so pure. Friendships are so important and my best friend is definitely my soulmate so... just love that for them, so cute.
"I think that's a good idea, Hermione." Neville said. He walked over to the Slytherins and sat down next to Pansy.
"Yes, of course... just an unlikely pair." Harry joked. "It's not a problem, right Ron?" Harry kneed him.
"-Like him?" Ron finished for him, "Malfoy, Harry? Really? I mean, you really know how to pick them. First, my sister. Then, the person who made our lives hell for 7 years. Nice job!"
When they got to her office McGonagall was waiting for them, and waiting to give them their punishment.
"My problem? My problem is one that all of you had for 7 years up until we lost the war. Bloody hell, I mean come on. We are better than them. Our bloodline is pure, unlike that filthy lot. It's bad enough we had to do that ridiculous bonding thing with them. You all are so two-faced as well. You are thinking the same thing. That's right, don't let them fool you." He added, because people seemed to be looking now.
"All right you crazy kids. Hurry though, we don't want to be late for our social gathering, would we Ronald?"
"I'm too drunk for this right now, Harry. We'll talk tomorrow." And Ron went back to the booth. Harry swallowed his need to cry and followed him.
"To be honest with you, I never hated you. I hated that you hated me... but I always had feelings for you... you know. Like a crush. I've always had those kind of... feelings..." Draco had never felt more exposed than in that moment. He'd never been so open with... anyone.
ok so some characters stayed at hogwarts for winter holidays and draco is one of them. that's all, enjoy(: --- (also i completely make up a spell... ok now that's all!)
"I'm sitting here complaining about getting the world handed to me... you didn't even know your parents."
Later, when they got to the platform, Molly and Arthur were waiting for the four of them. They were all greeted by hugs and love, and Harry knew that Draco was right. Having people choose you is
"Okay... remember that you said that... I'm dating... Blaise. Zabini... Blaise Zabini and I are dating and we have been for a while..." Ginny closed her eyes, scared of what Harry's reaction would be and Harry was going to open his mouth to say
"Mmm, you read my mind, let's go." Draco grabbed his hand and Harry draped the cloak over the two of them making them disappear. Neither were aware of just how much their hearts raced at that simple action of holding hands.
"I think you're incredible. Not many people have the capability to change. You became the person you wanted to be despite of your family's values. You helped so many other students learn to change to. I mean look at us. You hated me and now we're... er... friends..." Harry trailed off, noticeably embarrassed. There aren't many people Draco would go out on a limb for, but Harry Potter isn't just a person.
"You... you told them that we're d...oing- hooking up?" Harry's face fell, but he hoped Draco didn't notice. It really is just about hooking up for him isn't it? How can this be everything to him and nothing to Draco?
"Look a bit worn out Blaise, long night?" Draco asked, innocently. The rest of the table took notice of how red he got and snickered.
"But why would-" Draco was cut off by Ron gripping him and Draco on the back and ushering them back to the booth.
Harry looked at him and laughed. "They can wait till tomorrow." He said. "Kissing you can't." They made their way to Harry and Ron's room and locked the door. Telling their friends can wait until tomorrow most definitely,
"Did you catch that?" Pansy asked her friends as she was attempting to move Draco to the bench by the Great Hall.
He perked up at the sound of his name, he hadn't really been paying attention. No, he was busy watching Harry Potter, but of course he would never admit to that.
Draco was heading to the 8th year dorms when an arm grabbed his wrist and pulled him towards the stairway outside the Great Hall.
Draco was trying with all his might to not let the tears that were forming in his eyes fall. He failed and one slipped down his cheek. Quickly he wiped it and looked at Hermione once more.
"Hermione, I think I left my History of Magic book back in Sluggy's room." He kissed her on the cheek and ran off.
"Uh, okay. Never Have I Ever ... um.... I don't know...I'm not- ...very good at this game..." Draco said lamely.
As Ron was drunkenly telling them something that he thought was hilarious, Draco noticed a blonde waitress talking to Potter. She was gorgeous... and clearly flirting with him. Something started boiling inside of him and he wriggled out of Ron's grasp and made his way to the washroom.
his boyfriend... he didn't like Harry that way- it was just physical, that's all. And Harry was fine with it. He was totally and completely- positively,
"Malfoy we are going to be late if you don't haul ass to the showers. You don't want Potter to see you with un-gelled hair..." He did a dramatic gasp and hit Draco with a pillow. "Get up!"
Harry hadn't seen her yet this morning, which was weird considering she was usually the one wondering where Harry was. He decided to leave his friends' mushy gushy love fest and find his missing girlfriend.
"Me and ... what? Why? What are people saying?" Harry's stomach was doing back-flips and he felt like he was going to be sick.
So all Draco wanted was to shag... that sucked to hear. He didn't even want a relationship, just wanted to hook up.
Draco paused for a second trying to collect himself. "It was like he had just killed all of us anyway. But even if you had died, Neville was right. Your heart beats for us, and you are the reason that everyone who is in this room is alive. But, you're not the reason anyone is dead. That is because a disgusting man thought that power was more important than love and honor. To me, personally, you're everything that I needed during that time." He felt Blaise and Pansy's knowing smirks at that, but he didn't care, "I was in a house with Death Eaters torturing people.
the events following the bonding thing. it's a shortish chapter but i wanted to get some things rolling! hope you enjoy, leave a kudos if you do (:
Suddenly the common room door opened, and he saw him. Draco’s breath caught in his throat as he made eye contact with Harry. The man he had long awaited to see for the two weeks he’s been gone…
"Nice hickeys, Potter." Blaise said holding back a chuckle when Harry took his seat. Harry didn't have a comeback in him right now and just wanted to crawl in a hole
"Hi. Wanna sit?" Draco said, patting the seat next to him on the couch. Harry accepted the invitation and sat down next to him. There was comfortable silence until Harry said,
"Yeah. I don't know this friend but he sounds like he might be some sort of big hero... maybe savior of the world? Hundreds of books written about him? Hmm... I don't know I just got that vibe," He chuckled and Harry laughed, "don't worry about it, Harry. Do what you have to do... or you know tell your friend to."
"I just do. Life balances itself out. Something incredible will come from this heartbreak, I just know it." Draco didn't know what to say to that, so he just hugged Blaise tighter until they both fell asleep like that, in each other's arms.
"She told me she's dating Blaise... and Ron overheard he ran off and she went to talk to him. He kind of freaked out a bit and let it slide that Draco and I are...'
"Harry, you don't give yourself enough credit. You are excellent in Defense. Yes, when you were battling Voldemort you didn't use advanced spells and hit him where it hurt... but, you pick up defense spells quicker than anyone I know. You created a Corporeal Patronus when you were 13 for crying out loud. Sure, you have some things you need to learn... but McGonagall wouldn't have asked you to do this if she didn't think you could." Hermione said.
He smiled to himself as they said the same number. Got him, he thought. Harry looked around to find where Draco was headed and then felt hands cup his cheeks, and turned to see Draco leaning in to him.
"Of course I have, Malfoy I just don't particularly want to think about your's or Zabini's mouth." Draco had to admit that he was slightly impressed that Harry managed to quip a comeback so easily.
"Harry didn't tell me, Draco. You did. Just now." Luna said, like it was the simplest thing in the world.
"Well, that's what all of us were wondering as well. I suppose it had something to do with whatever you and Ronald talked about in the washroom." She looked at him pointedly.
"I'm just... sorry. This is so embarrassing." Draco put his face in his hands. "I guess I just can't believe this is actually happening." He said, a bit muffled by his hands. Harry grabbed his hands and took them in his, causing Draco to look up at him.
"I thought maybe you'd need this. You can thank Hermione." Draco smiled, graciously accepted the potion, and then downed it.
And, it's not like Draco doesn't enjoy the company. To be frank, he likes it a lot. He likes that Luna just sits there in silence and she doesn't ask any questions and just lets him be. But, why? Because Longbottom and all of her friends are home for the Holidays? Because she feels sorry for Draco? He decided to finally ask on a random Tuesday during lunch.
Harry had heard enough. He went back down the stairs and walked right past Hermione. He didn't know where he was going but he just wanted to be alone.
"Nothing to lie about Pans. We were flirting. That's all we've been doing for months. Since he and She- Weas... Ginny... broke up." Draco looked over at Blaise, saying an
He looked at Draco, and the look that Harry was giving him made Draco's insides melt. He stared at Draco for what seemed an eternity until he finally spoke.
?" Draco smiled. "I really am sorry. You're an amazing friend, you're practically family. I don't even deserve you. You're right... I've been a right awful friend to you. I'll be better, I promise." He said, reaching his arms out to hug her. She complied and went in for a deep hug, her head resting at his shoulder as she was engulfed by his arms. When they pulled apart she kissed him on the cheek and sat on the desk opposite of him.
"Will you two just bloody shag already? I'm getting bored of this. Shag. Then we can all move on with our lives." Pansy and Blaise exchanged a look that said
Harry joined Hermione and Ron. "I still can't get used to the fact that Bill is our teacher." Harry said, putting his bag down.
... it changes everything. It ruins everything. After we leave Hogwarts, I’ll be heartbroken and cry for a few months and I’ll be fine.” Draco said. It was only partly a lie. Mainly because he knew there’d be no getting over Harry. How can anyone even come close?
"You don't even understand my love for you. I'm so in love with you. I'm everything? No. Hermione Granger you're everything. You're my everything and I don't know how I got so lucky." He kissed her and she melted into him.
But, not having Harry in his life at all would kill him more. And, because Draco didn’t care how hurt he would be not having Harry the way he wanted him… because in whatever way Harry
"Well, originally, but then she decided we could just meet up and plan what we think it should be..."
"Hermione- don't start, Ok? I know it in my heart so just... leave it be." Harry said quickly, before she could say anything else.
They stayed like that for a few seconds until they heard someone clear their throat. He then heard Pansy's voice, "Uh... sorry to interrupt... but..."
"Uhm, you're welcome! People were about to start leaving for classes now and I'm not sure what people would say if they walked out and saw what I just did!" Draco blushed and rubbed his forehead.
“Love, you’re being a bit too obvious that you’re waiting for someone to walk through the common room door…” Pansy said to Draco as they were sitting in front of the fireplace. Draco knew this, and, quite honestly? He didn’t care. These two weeks without Harry have been terrible. Yes, he wrote to him and Harry wrote back, but it just wasn’t the same as being able to hold him… to kiss him. Was he being dramatic? Definitely, but he didn’t care. He just wanted to see Harry.
"Where-uh-where's Har-uh Potter at?" Draco asked as they sat down. Hermione gave him a knowing smirk and then Ron answered, "He said he didn't sleep well last night and wanted a little bit longer. Asked me to bring him up some toast."
"I don't have much to go by... but you're... I... you're just..." Draco tried but couldn't get the words out.
"You can call him 'Draco'," Ron said, fidgeting with his hands while looking down at his lap. "I mean... if that's what you want to call him. You can. You can do whatever you want. You know? Like... if you want to... call him 'Draco' then call him 'Draco' and I'll support you. I just don't want you to think I wouldn't-" It was Harry's turn to cut Ron off.
"...You really have a way with words... thank you. I don't deserve to... you just really know how to make me feel better... I still don't get why you had a crush on me as kids. I was insufferable to you."
"I wasn't planning on it, Ron. I know how it feels to be outed. I would never do that to anyone. You have nothing to worry about; Harry's life is his own."
"Hermione... please. Fuck! I knew you knew... at the party... you...you gave me a look and I knew... but, Harry does...he..."
"Yes, Po-Harry...," He just called him Harry, that felt really good, "for everything I've ever done or said to you. I was an obnoxious prat and I needed attention from you and I-" Draco stopped abruptly. What is the matter with you, he silently berated himself. Great, way to go Draco you just told Harry you need attention from him. He tried to continue with some dignity, "and I well I was completely out of line. I grew up in a horrible environment and I know that's not an excuse but..." Oh, Gods... was he rambling? Yes, he was definitely rambling, god dammit.
She smiled and sat down across from him, pulling books out of her bag. For the rest of the morning they sat in comfortable silence reading and enjoying this blossoming friendship.
"I think you'd be surprised. You're so set on him not liking you... and I'm just not sure why." Ron said.
don't hate harry! you'll get his insight into why he broke it off with draco next chapter, he has a really good reason i promise!
Yeah, we get it, you're in love. Harry loves Ginny but you didn't see them draped all over each other all the time!
"Well... I'm here to talk about last night." Harry said, hoping his anxiety wasn't clear in his voice. Draco looked up at him meeting Harry's eyes with fear.
"It's difficult to explain... there were parts that were cheerful and parts that were not. You know? I never had any idea of what other people's lives were like until I woke up and realized... parents are supposed to support your own beliefs and dreams... and- and wants? It was a shock to me...I was always told that it was my father's way or no way at all..."
"What you were saying before, how it's weird that Harry calls him Draco instead of Malfoy now. 'What's in a name?' Who cares what he's calling him- it won't change how he feels about him."
Draco had fallen asleep in the common room and woke up confused as hell. His neck hurt and he had no idea what time it was. He looked over and Hermione was sitting on the couch with Ron as they were having a conversation.
"Bloody hell... sorry I'm just a bit... uh... distracted, I guess." Harry said, looking down. Draco was still there and he definitely couldn't talk about why he was distracted while the distractment was right there.
"Sorry, love. I woke up late. Couldn't sleep last night and then had a right awful nightmare when I finally did." She leaned into the hug and nuzzled her head into Harry's neck. "I missed you."
"Do you really not know by now?" Harry breathed. His breath was hot on Draco's face and he was pretty sure that he was going to pass out from his need to kiss Harry.
"You know, 'Mione?" Harry asked. Draco was taken back a bit. Harry had remained awfully silent for a while.
"We were studying together this morning... actually, most mornings for the past few weeks, and I invited Draco to sit with us over here. That's fine with you guys, right?" Hermione said.
"Hmm? Friends? Never heard of them..." He kissed Harry again. They rubbed together to create unbelievable friction and Draco was on fire with want. He wanted Harry and that thought excited him and terrified him at the same time.
"Good idea, I don't know how Ron would take that hearing it from someone else." Hermione thought to herself. "Do you think Draco knows?"
"Of course she knew. She had to punish us, but she knew Goyle was being a right git. The 3 weeks part was for any passer byers so they would know she meant business." Ron said.
"Harry! Perfect timing, we are talking about going to Hogsmeade later for a good time! You in?" Harry thought about it and decided that it sounded perfect. It was just what he needed to get his mind off of Draco for a night.
"There is no 'apparently' about it, Potter. You were definitely very drunk." Draco gave him a soft smile.
Of course, it had to be Harry. Of all the 8th years it had to be him. Harry looked at him as he was walking and all Draco could do was wave awkwardly and blush.
Hermione said something and Draco looked unsure, but then followed Hermione to the table behind Ron and Harry.
don't worry i just love the dramione friendship- i want them to have a good solid friendship in this story. hope you liked it!
"I'm working on it, I really am." Hermione opened her mouth to reply but she saw Ron and Ginny walking over to them.
"I'm sure you mean Professor Weasley, Ronald?" Bill laughed. Ron rolled his eyes and went in front of the class.
When they pulled apart it seemed like the fastest kiss, but most meaningful and slow kiss he ever had. They looked at each other before Draco got up, grabbed Blaise and went up to what he can only assume to be their dorm room.
"I can live with that." She said. She kissed him on the cheek, handed him an extra hangover potion, and left the common room.
"Malfoy! They're just kidding. Harry's a right awful liar. Could have never fooled us." Draco still looked unsure but kept eating his toast despite that. Ginny walked in the Great hall and about 10 seconds later Blaise did. Really discreet guys, Draco mocked in his head. Although, if they walked in snogging he wasn't sure too many people would grasp it even then.
"Everybody has hardships. You can't judge people based on them. You may have had a lot of material items, but you were never emotionally supported and that's something all kids need... I never had that either. I grew up with my awful aunt and uncle and my horrible cousin, Dudley. Though, he has apologized to me and we correspond here and there now..."
This is now part 3, and the final part, of The Bonding Thing! It's a fairly short chapter but I wanted to finish this part of the story up!
also... i know this chapter is really short :/ but i wanted to get the "break up" out of the way so that i can move onto happier things (:
"I saw her crying in the corridor the same day that her and Potter broke up and we started talking... and I walked her back to her common room. We made plans to hang out the next day. We hung out that next day, just in an empty corridor and talked for hours. Then we kissed and she felt really guilty because she had only just broken up with Potter... but I told her that she had nothing to feel guilty about. We are keeping it secret because she's not ready for Weasley to know... and for Potter to know either. I don't blame her."
Later that night, Draco was feeling sorry for himself and didn't go to dinner. He avoided everyone all day by hiding out in his and Blaise's room. He may or may not have locked Blaise out and
"And why did you stop kissing me, may I ask?" Draco said, pouting slightly. Draco was too adorable for his own good sometimes.
They left their 'make out room' and walked in to everyone hollering and cat calling. They just laughed and rolled their eyes.
"McGonagall wants to meet with me?" Draco was surprised. He didn't think McGonagall would want him involved, of all people.
"Hey guys... how's everything?" Hermione asked the siblings. Ron smiled at Hermione and sat next to her, the side Harry wasn't on, and kissed her cheek.
thanks for reading. hope you enjoyed. i know it's short but i like this chapter a lot so i hope you do as well! (:
"Why don't... why don't I just show you?" Draco grabbed Harry's hand, muttered a cleansing spell over himself and led Harry out of the Room of Requirement.
As he was walking up towards the room he realized that if Draco is already using the room...would he be allowed to come in? Maybe if he told the room that he
. I like it." He leaned in and said directly into Harry's ear. The motion gave Harry goosebumps all over, remembering exactly why he'd been so
"Right. See you... uh, back at the table..." Draco walked past Ron and out the washroom without looking back.
"I... I really don't want to. Why are you not more freaked out about this? Ron saw us! I mean... he's probably going to hate you."
"I know... too bad it took us so long to realize that. But, I wouldn't trade it for anything... Hermione?" Ginny asked.
Since it's Saturday they didn't have class, and the eighth years were of age and therefore able to go into Hogsmeade when they pleased, (as long as they were back before curfew) everyone decided to go for a pint or two. They invited everyone, of course, but Dean and Seamus wanted to 'stay in' and Neville had plans with Luna and everyone else had other plans so it ended up just being Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, Blaise and, you guessed it, Pansy.
"It's been two years, if he isn't on board yet I don't know if he will be" Harry walked past his friends and hurried to History of Magic.
Harry wasn't exactly sure why he felt so weird about it, especially considering that those were two people he thought he couldn't care less about. I mean it's not like he had a crush on either of them. Sure, Blaise had good features, a strong jaw-line, and was perfectly handsome. Draco has those prying grey eyes and thick blonde hair... and his lips were very plump and firm looking... it intrigued Harry, for a sum total of 7 seconds, what it would be like to kiss Draco Malfoy, until he laughed at himself for thinking such a ridiculous thought.
"Oh... is that so? And who is this man that is lucky enough to have caught The Saviour's eye?" Draco wondered if Harry could hear his heart beat, because he was sure it was about to pound out of his chest. Harry took a step forward so that his nose was almost touching Draco's.
"Yeah, cause you look so much better. There's no time. We are going to be so late. We'll just sneak up to our dorms and ... fix ourselves and meet back in the common room, Ok?"
A few of the Slytherins looked shocked, some touched and some... well had no apparent facial expressions.
he didn't know how to say... but goodbye was the prominent one at the moment. He made eye contact with him and pointed towards the doors.
"So Harry," Seamus started, "have a morning snog with Ginny?" The Gryffindors chuckled and awaited Harry's response.
"McGonagall's office... the pensieve. I'll just show you the memory." Harry took a sharp inhale of breath. He thought he might die of embarrassment because he knew that Draco was about to show him was going to be
Harry's hand started trembling and he didn't know why. He spoke in a quiet voice. "I never wanted to be a hero. I never asked for any of this to happen to me. For my parents to be murdered, for countless lives to be lost because of me! Yeah, I'm The ruddy Chosen One, but I'm also the reason that this whole fucking war started in the first place. I'm the reason everyone died. I-I'm," Harry choked back tears, "I'm the reason my parents are dead. And every time someone calls me one of those names... it just reminds me of all the lives I couldn't save."
