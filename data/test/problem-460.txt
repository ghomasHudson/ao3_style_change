Harry was confident in his looks and his abilities and whilst certain Professors (
Harry’s fingers slipped soapily up his turgid shaft, the pad of his thumb rubbing across the thick vein that went down the middle of it. He glanced down as he pulled back his foreskin, teasing the swollen bulb before closing his eyes and letting his mind drift.
“I know,” Draco replied, “I’m s-sorry, I just couldn’t sleep, the others are having a party in Slytherin. Is it okay that I’m here already?”
“I know what you’re going to ask dear,” Nadia winked as Harry slid the door quietly closed behind them and checked there was no one else about. “And don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal. I was absolutely insatiable in my second trimester, there were times when my poor husband Harold couldn’t keep up, but they do a pill now –“
“You look like an angel,” Harry grinned as Draco blushed. The omega looked pleased though as he slid into the bed nearest the wall.
“I need to get back,” Harry explained, “I don’t know if you’re aware but I’m responsible for an omega at the moment.”
“Mrs. Lestrange is already on her way,” Professor McGonagall’s nose wrinkled up as if she had smelled something distasteful. Harry vaguely recognised the surname from the war history, guessing that, similar to the Malfoys, the Lestranges had been on the opposite side to his parents. “However, whilst Draco is technically with child, all decisions fall to the charge of his legal alpha, the other parent.” McGonagall spoke stiffly and awkwardly as a chill ran down Harry’s spine.
Draco clutched tightly at Harry’s arm as they apparated onto the designated point on Diagon Alley.
Draco relished the sensation of Harry’s large hands gripping his upper arms, lifting him up before steadying him gently on the rug.
“Harry s-stop – it tickles!” Draco squealed as Harry grabbed his slim hips in order to hold the younger boy still.
“You never used to complain when I woke you up this way,” Ginny arched her eyebrow as Harry shot her a look. She laughed and slumped back down, “Fine, fine, I just wanted to say sorry for my part in winding you up about Draco over the last month.”
,” Harry said as Draco tried not to wince. “But I’m here for you okay? I’m your alpha right now and if you ever feel cold or sad or hungry or
“I must then entreat you Harry,” McGonagall paused, considering her words carefully, “please consider your next move with your usual level of empathy.”
“That’s right Draco,” Remus began loudly, “you could just angle your axle to compensate.”
“Okay,” Harry laughed, levitating his mug of tea over to him and settling down on the couch.
^*^*^*^*^
“Oh darling, I will. I just thought it might be a bit overwhelming for us to bond during your first experience,” Harry frowned, feeling angry at himself. “I
Draco seemed to be drawing close to completion, as he was emitting high, punched out noises. Harry could feel the towel grow sodden as a wet puddle of slick spread out around them. He looked up, over Draco’s head and froze in shock when he realised they were facing the large bathroom mirror.
“Hnngh,” Draco whined, sagging down as finally a steady stream of colostrum trickled out and over his stretched belly. Harry sat, open mouthed as he felt Draco’s milk drip off the end of his nose. Some of it was clinging to his glasses and he could taste it on his lips. He ran his tongue across to collect the droplets, creating warm bursts of honey apple in his mouth.
“Yes,” Draco replied enthusiastically. The food Harry had made had been delicious and he had loved watching everybody laugh and have fun together. Even though his stomach was cramping now, it was still worth it to have sampled all of the different cake layers.
^*^*^*^*^
Draco smiled shyly up at him, “I don’t think the other customers would like it very much if we bonded here.”
Draco nodded, looking back at Harry and the other omega one last time before following Hermione through into a utility room where she opened the backdoor.
“I still w-won,” Draco protested, trying to crane his head back to look up at a smirking Harry.
However, a quick sniff of the air reassured Harry that that was not the case. In fact, there was a strange sweet scent that he couldn’t place.
“Fuck!” Harry exclaimed, panting loudly as he orgasmed, painting the tiles with ropes of hot come like a pornographic Pollock. His chest was still rising and falling rapidly as he sagged against the wall, one arm up to brace himself. The steady stream from the shower was beating against his hunched shoulders.
“Fine,” Damien spat, angrily glancing round to see the gathered onlookers.
It was comfortable and pretty without being too attention grabbing. Or at least that was what Draco had thought until he walked into the hall and noticed half of the students sending him nasty looks and leaning in to each other to whisper.
A strained expression passed over Professor McGonagall’s face as she slid a roll of parchment across to Harry.
“Of course,” Draco declared, eyeing the suddenly very dark and expansive looking forest. “It will be fun.”
Draco gave a strangled gasp, allowing Harry’s fingers to pull his chin back up, his back curving lower and causing his passage to tighten around the intrusion.
“Yes,” Draco replied, looking excited again and hurrying back into the changing room before drawing the drapes.
“Draco’s the one with silver hair isn’t he?” Luna asked before turning to Dean and Michael, “I thought he actually ranked quite high up your list that you made?”
“Fuck,” Harry swore, surging up to pull Draco into a deep, urgent kiss. He helped the omega tip forwards, lining up his entrance with Harry’s cock before allowing Draco to set the pace. Draco’s face tightened then went blissfully lax as he sheathed himself on Harry’s dick. Harry lay back against the rough wood, staring up at the angelic omega. Draco opened his grey eyes, locking with Harry’s before giving him a bright, adoring smile.
“Sweetheart, careful of your dress, I haven’t had these floorboards sanded yet and oh…” Harry swallowed thickly as Draco stood up and pushed his dress off completely, revealing that he hadn’t been wearing anything underneath it.
“You’d better go check on your alpha,” Felicity told him, “I’ll walk you to the Morgana Study okay? I reckon that’s where Harry and Hermione’ll have gone and I’d feel rotten letting you wander around on your own here with all these nasty big grown alphas,” she shot Draco a toothy grin before holding out her hand.
Draco wondered if his mother was still alive whether she would have taught him? He tried to imagine the kinds of opulent nests that Narcissa Malfoy would have deemed worthy for her own pregnancy with him. He really hoped there had been turrets, maybe a duvet drawbridge.
“Shouldn’t you have gone to pick him up?” Hermione frowned.
“I’m sorry Draco, you must think we were raised by wolves,” Remus said as Draco gasped and jerked his head to Harry. The alpha was chuckling as he brought his hand up to gently ruffle Draco’s hair.
“Look how perfect you are,” Harry sighed, swiping his thumb down to gently graze Draco’s tight balls. He kept massaging Draco’s erect member as Harry stretched his body up to bring their lips together. Within seconds, Draco’s mouth fell open, his body going rigid and spasming as he came.
“No,” Draco shook his head but looked pleased, “I was worried I wouldn’t…” he trailed off with a blush. “That I fainted t-too early and wouldn’t get to…”
Draco flinched slightly as he realised Harry’s green eyes were now on him, having caught Draco staring at the alpha.
“Y-You have?” Draco asked as Harry edged in again, letting out a low moan.
“I’m telling you,” Harry continued cheerfully, “I was this bloody close to asking the DJ to turn it down.”
“I’d l-like to make a nest,” Draco explained, “and I was wondering if you might give me…”
“Don’t be a pillock,” Harry pulled a face, “you’ve been fully invested in Hermione since
“How are the wedding plans going, Harry?” Remus asked a moment later as the mood lifted. A gentle breeze trundled across the garden, bringing with it the scents of anise and fennel.
“How about on the second deck of the Knight Bus?” Harry suggested, trying to look as innocent as possible. He could feel Draco tense but the younger man still managed to smile politely.
Draco had only seen Harry Potter twice since the incident with Bella and Rodolphus. The dark haired man would turn up at Madam Pomfrey’s office a little after Draco in order to siphon off some of his excess magical energy and feed it into Draco’s core.
“It’s okay Professor,” Harry sighed, “I can understand why it was your first conclusion.”
“I know it’s freezing out there, so we’ll only stay a minute – here, put this on,” Hermione passed Draco a large fluffy coat that he could scent belonged to Molly Weasley. He took Hermione’s outstretched hand and let himself be led into the garden where the air was filled with crystal flakes.
“Sorry I’m late,” Remus announced cheerfully, drawing Harry into a quick hug before taking a seat opposite the bench on a stone bollard. Harry stood up to try and offer Remus a more comfortable option but the other man dismissed him with a smile. “So I have good news,”
“Before she sold you off to some pervy old fart?” Harry grimaced.
“I can smell…” Harry murmured, “apples and frost.”
“Atherol would even take in your bastard sprog,” Bella hissed, her eyes flickering dangerously to Draco’s belly. “Can’t you see what a second chance you’ve been given here? I knew inheriting Narcissa’s looks had to be worth something in the end.”
Draco couldn’t help the laugh he let out as Hermione shot him a grin. He already liked the beta, she smelled safe and seemed kind enough, not to mention she was one of Harry’s friends.
Harry tore his eyes away from where they had gravitated back down to the swelling at Draco’s middle to look at the younger boy’s face. Draco had his head turned to regard himself in the mirror and there was a happy smile on his lips as the sweet scent of apple pie filled the room.
“Alright,” the boy looked pleased by the permission, “my name’s Damien, Damien Tuppence.”
“You’re only twenty-two!” Hermione exclaimed before shooting an apologetic look at Draco.
“Well I didn’t design the building, what about the clothes?” Olive snorted as Harry shot her a guilty look.
“A-Alpha!” Draco cried, his face a wet and blotchy mess as he desperately tried to continue stroking Harry’s cock, his small hands slipping and jerking erratically. Harry growled as Draco stopped moving, right on the edge of Harry’s own orgasm. However, he couldn’t begrudge the younger boy as a second later, Draco screamed hoarsely, slamming himself back onto Harry’s fingers as he came for the second time across the bed sheets.
Draco sat back, slipping his menu in between the salt and pepper shakers. If he was being truly honest, Draco did feel a little self conscious about not having Harry’s bond bite yet, despite smelling like him. He did, however, believe Harry when the alpha explained to Draco that he just wanted to give the younger boy time to adjust.
“Congratulations,” Harry yawned, “I know you wanted them over the Falcons.” Harry stared at Ginny who was still kneeling by his feet. “So why exactly are you in my bed then?”
Draco felt himself go very red again and gave the store owner a shaky smile. “Yes please.”
“I am,” Harry replied, relishing how it felt to hear Draco call him that. “And you’re my omega, my baby boy.”
Draco glanced up to where Harry was pointing. It was a stall that looked to be covered in different coloured icicles. Draco watched as a man handed over some coins to the vendor before snapping one of the red icicles off of the roof and tipping it up like a shot glass.
“Harry,” Hermione began as a tentative whisper. “I understand you had nothing to do with the spell and that this Draco Malfoy made an honest mistake. But
Draco smiled before the conductor announced that they were drawing into King’s Cross Station.
Draco’s eyes widened before he giggled, “Like a lolly?”
Ron snorted, “Blast from the past innit? Being back on that train with all the ickle kiddies?” the beta winced as soon as he had said it, shooting Draco an apologetic expression.
Draco shifted awkwardly, his denims were soaked through in places and the previously warm slick had chilled and was now freezing his skin in the snowy air. He tensed as Harry took a step closer and peered round behind Draco as if to check the damage.
“What about him?” Harry narrowed his eyes as Remus rose up and started straightening the rug that Harry’s pacing had set askew.
"Are you alright little one?" Harry asked softly, caressing Draco's sweat damp skin.
“You’re right, I’m much too possessive for that,” Harry smirked, “I want you all to myself behind closed doors and away from prying eyes.”
“I can be yours too,” Harry growled, nipping the top of Draco’s ear as the omega let out a soft yelp. “If you want me to be.”
“I don’t think Atherol Sourboll would be that interested now,” Draco laughed, looking down at his protruding belly.
^*^*^*^*^
“Thank you,” Draco replied politely, feeling rather comforted as the women of Gaedere House began feeding him various compliments.
“He’s not a child,” Snape replied coldly, “I would have thought you would be the last person to wish him to be perceived as one. I have a multitude of old spell and potions journals and had forgotten which one contained that spell. I had also underestimated Draco’s loneliness and discontent, provoking him into using an unknown spell on himself.”
“Are you excited to be a dad?” the girl who had broken her arm asked, the colour returning to her cheeks after a particularly strong episkey.
“Ugh,” Harry shuddered at the thought, “I hadn’t even considered that thank god, you know pureblood families wig me out.”
“It’s o-okay,” Draco replied. “I’ve just never shared a bed with anybody before.”
“Do you want to come on my tongue then little one? What is it you’d like?”
“Well, I mean,” Hermione rolled her eyes and tutted frustratedly, “Circe, I am absolutely pants at talking about these kinds of relationship things.” She shot Ron a vicious glare as he snorted into his hot chocolate.
“Poke holes in the condom or throw out your pills?” Smith continued. “Only I’d like to be sure so I don’t end up in Harry’s shoes next time I get my dick wet.”
“How d-did you know that?” Draco asked, he hadn’t managed to tell Harry yet.
Draco laughed as Harry gently helped the omega to his feet, leading him through a side door and into a grand looking marble bathroom. “One thing I did do, is get the water hooked up already,” Harry announced, gesturing to a massive bathtub that was nestled up against the window, looking out over the gardens. Fairy lights were twinkling in the trees and the eco friendly paper lanterns that Luna had brought were evidently being set off, dancing across the night sky in hues of gold and orange.
Bellatrix had written in her erratic, ink blotted scrawl.
The trouble was, he now was in the devastating position of knowing what Draco’s slick smelled like. When Harry had first caught a whiff of that aroma, his mouth had literally watered and he didn’t think his dick had ever been that hard in his life. Poor Draco had been so flustered by the whole affair that at least he hadn’t seemed to notice that Harry had been sporting a considerable stiffy in his jeans. Even just the memory now of that sweet honeydew was enough to get Harry’s shaft thickening with blood and his balls feeling heavy and tight.
“All good,” Harry replied, “I was just going to pop to the loo if you’ll be alright for a few minutes?”
Draco found himself spreading his legs further, pulling his own knees apart as far as they could comfortably go. He wondered if he would remember this with shame, acting so wantonly? Somehow he doubted it, Draco was safe with his alpha and he knew Harry was enjoying the display of desire and arousal.
Harry disappeared in to the bathroom and Draco could hear the creak of the shower pipes turning on. He waited a few more minutes, watching the bright flashes before deciding to get down after all. His body was starting to ache having been stuck in one position for an extended period of time.
“I really am sorry Mione, I just freaked out okay? You should have heard the lecture Madam Pomfrey gave us about stress and male omega pregnancies.”
“Draco, are you lactating?” Harry blurted out in shock.
“You know those beetles are also called cockchafers,” Snape commented absently, staring at the clusters of May-bugs as Harry tried not to choke.
“Huh?” Harry began to panic.
Sometimes, in the silent darkness of the night, Draco imagined letting the alpha kiss him. Draco had never been kissed before so he didn’t have much reference for his musings apart from a battered romance novel he had stolen from his aunt’s library. Draco was pretty sure it had belonged to his omega mother anyway, as the initials N.B. were inscribed on the front page in curling script.
Draco gently cradled his bump as he watched a strange cloud of emotion pass over his godfather’s eyes.
“Did it go alright with the thestrals?” Draco questioned as Harry began shedding his outermost layers and leaving them on the exposed flagstones by the door, away from the very expensive looking rugs.
“Mum’s already said you’re welcome at the Burrow,” Ron told him. “Just in case Remus and Sirius were still away this Christmas.”
Harry groaned as he stretched out his aching limbs. The Ministry had sent up some specialised auror programme tutors for the spring term and they were definitely not mucking about when it came to training.
“Hey, Draco, mate, it’s okay. Fuck, are you alright?” Ron murmured, not waiting for an answer as he lifted Draco up and called out to someone further down the corridor that Draco vaguely recognised as Michael Corner. “I’m going to take him to the Hospital Wing, I want you to patronus Harry and make sure somebody gets Professor McGonagall to deal with these absolute fuckwits.”
“I thought Bella was my only aunt,” Draco admitted, feeling a little shell shocked.
Currently, Harry was out on the pitch enjoying a game of quidditch with the rest of Gaedere House. The older man had left Draco revising for Charms in the Morgana Suite. Draco hoped Harry wouldn’t be angry with him after he discovered what had happened but it wasn’t like Harry had ever tried to control Draco’s movements.
“Merlin,” Hermione shook her head, “It will be like the Burrow.”
Harry had actually heard about, given that Mrs. White sent Sirius an invite every year on account of having been tremendously close with his mother Walburga Black and ever so impressed at his ‘war hero’ status. Then again, every single invitation also neglected to include Remus and was subsequently thrown in the bin or turned into origami, often of particularly ugly insects in compromising positions.
“Okay,” Padma nodded, “it’s just a little pink so that’s good. We’ll get some ointment on there and you’ll be right as rain.”
“Do you want to dance?” she asked, flashing Harry her pearly teeth, lit up eerily by the UV lights.
The thought made Draco let out a small giggle as Harry raised an eyebrow at him.
“Third and final question,” Katie paused, “were you aware that your alpha has spent the
“Is he yours too?” Remus asked neutrally. “You seem quite protective of him.”
Draco smiled and tried not to blurt out the first thing that came into his head, which happened to be that he thought Harry’s glasses made him look like a sexy professor.
^*^*^*^*^
Harry sagged in relief as his friends all came bundling into the room, cooing over a gurgling Lyra and offering their heartfelt congratulations. Harry and Draco shared a knowing smile together as he helped the omega sit up further, their daughter safely in Draco’s arms.
“Thanks,” Harry replied, forcing a smile as he stalked out of the office, ignoring the jaunty whistling of the stone gargoyle behind him.
“Face it Draco,” Bellatrix sighed, rearranging her face into a seemingly more sympathetic expression. “You will never get that boy’s bite. However
IS SNIVELLUS ON MY DOORSTEP?!”
“And yet,” Snape stated, his voice seething with misery and bitterness, “I got to keep a part of her in my life.”
“Aw, that’s great,” Katie beamed. “I assume you’ll take some maternity leave but do you reckon you’ll want to work after that?”
Harry swallowed, shifting his mug in his grip and reaching out to squeeze Remus’ shoulder.
“As far as I know,” McGonagall sniffed, “although I wouldn’t put it past Mr. Black to drag Mr. Lupin into some sort of trouble.”
^*^*^*^*^
“I’m here now,” Harry stated, bringing their lips together in a wet kiss, his tongue pushing into Draco’s mouth. Harry chuckled as he drew back and wiped away a trail of saliva on Draco’s chin with his thumb. “Messy boy.”
“What?” Ron frowned, “I thought Draco was getting his own place? Hasn’t Remus been working on squeezing his inheritance out of the Lestranges?”
“I-I’d like to take them something tomorrow,” Draco fidgeted with his cardigan, realising that now Ron was gone he could probably take it off and change into his night gown. The new one from Olive’s that was a beautiful eggshell silk and didn’t even have sleeves. “It’s rude to be someone’s guest without a gift.”
“How I pictured you spread open on all fours, reams of slick spurting from your pink hole?”
“But it’s true!” Ron protested. “I’m not saying I agree with it Mione but it’s a pretty permanent decision for a kid to make.”
He wondered what Harry thought about Draco now? Did he still see him as a horribly shy and silent omega or had Draco managed to convey glimpses of his own personality across to the alpha?
Harry made up his mind to write to Remus when they got back to school, the werewolf having trained in legal affairs. Maybe as Harry was Draco’s temporary alpha, there was some way they could get him his funds.
“You…” the man began to speak, clutching at his wife’s arm, “J-James Potter…”
“Draco?” Harry prompted, a serious expression on his face.
“I had two pieces of marmalade toast and a pain au raisin,” Draco told him.
“Oh my love,” Harry’s own tension bled away as he smiled at Draco, stroking his cheek, “don’t be. I’m here okay, I’m not going anywhere, I’ll be right by your side for everything.”
Harry pulled a face, the more he heard about Bellatrix Lestrange the more he intensely disliked the woman and he had already thought she was a piece of work from their first meeting in the Hospital Wing.
“That’s the spirit,” Ron nodded, looking like he was trying not to laugh. “I’ll go get the sausages.”
Snape sighed, although it didn’t sound annoyed, just tired. “When I composed that spell, I…I wasn’t in the best of places.”
have complete access to my inheritance and right now most of it is sat gathering dust in Gringott’s. Honestly, let’s just treat ourselves today alright?”
“But if you want it prettier then let me help,” Harry stood up decisively and reached for his wand. “We can use magic right?”
Draco blushed but didn’t answer as opened his mouth wide and stretched his lips around the purpled head. It was obscene, Harry thought as he gazed down, the way saliva was escaping from the corners of the omega’s mouth, running down his chin as Draco pulled back off and then tried again.
“Are you
“You know that’s not where my loyalties lay,” Snape bit out coldly.
“I’m sure you’re a real catch,” Harry smiled placatingly, glancing down the corridor and hoping he could leave soon.
“Snake slut,” someone hissed, setting off a chorus of gleeful hisses from the other students.
“I am,” Harry said truthfully, “although I think it might well be me that spoils them rotten and buys things I shouldn’t.”
“Oh don’t you look adorable!” Katie squealed upon seeing Draco’s new outfit. “It’s so pretty!”
“You make a-all of these?” Draco asked, reaching out to rub the soft pink satin of a nearby blouse between his fingers.
Behind the other man, Harry caught sight of two origami stag beetles buggering each other.
Draco snickered as Harry grinned, taking off his glasses and wiping his hand across his dirty face.
“Well let’s just walk about a bit first then,” Harry smiled. “You lot all hitting the maze?”
“Thank you,” Draco nodded, feeling a little more at ease.
“Wait, really?” Harry blinked.
“I think you need to go out tomorrow night,” Ron said quietly, “your alpha’s got to be going crazy being around an omega that smells like you all the time. You need to get it out of your system and get your head on straight.”
Draco squeaked and wrenched up the bed sheets to cover himself, peering out over the top of them to see three women standing at the doorway in various states of surprise and amusement.
“What is it?” Draco asked curiously, peering round at the alpha.
“You look bloody good Draco,” Harry sighed wearily, slapping a hand against his face and letting out a pained groan. “And unfortunately it just makes what I had been planning to ask you now seem like it has some sort of ulterior motive.”
“Did you get impatient waiting for Daddy, little one?” Harry growled, ducking down to nose against Draco’s hairline before licking a stripe up the column of Draco’s gulping throat.
Draco nodded, his eyes widening, his omega had been hoping for exactly the same thing.
Despite having put away a sizeable portion of chips back at the pub, Harry still felt ravenous come dinner time. Luckily, the house elves had cooked up a veritable feast. Harry was pleased that Draco’s appetite had come back in full force and he watched with amusement as Katie helped pile the omega’s plate with vegetarian cottage pie and boiled carrots.
“Harry Potter wouldn’t be caught dead with a Malfoy,” someone snapped.
“Where are you going to be working?” Harry asked, realising he didn’t know about quite a few of his fellow Gaedere peers’ plans for after their courses finished.
Draco began trying to take off his nightgown, weakly scrabbling at the straps before Harry shushed him gently, helping the omega lift up his arms and pulling him free of the creamy silk. Immediately, Harry plastered his naked chest against Draco’s back, their skin slipping together with sweat. His hands snaked round Draco’s sides, cupping and kneading his small breasts as the younger boy moaned, throwing his head back against Harry’s shoulder.
Harry narrowed his eyes as he saw Seamus grit his teeth, a small bead of sweat rolling down his temple as he focussed his wand. As subtly as he could, Harry cast a wandless impervious charm over Draco and Katie and then himself and Hermione.
“I hear the auror trainers have been working you guys hard,” Colum smirked, his eyes flickering appreciatively to Harry’s muscles.
^*^*^*^*^
“Oh I know that,” Hermione said, clicking her tongue dismissively, “Harry would never hurt anyone.”
“Yeah, but,” Colum looked confused, “you’re not actually
Draco blushed horribly and tried to take a step behind Harry to hide his currently very dowdy outfit from view. He expected Olive to roll her eyes or make some kind of cutting remark but instead she just looked unreasonably delighted.
“If I’m so bad then stop bothering me,” Draco muttered, shoving his mittens hard against Smith’s chest and letting out a grunt of frustration as the large alpha didn’t even budge a millimetre.
“Knot head alpha like Potter?” Snape spat, “I doubt he bothers to remember all his conquests.”
“Don’t you think you owe Venetia an apology?” a willowy beta girl Draco knew was called Iona crossed her arms over her chest and levelled Draco with a demanding glare.
“You don’t think I’d be handsome clean shaven?” Harry laughed as Draco pouted. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist and lifted him up before laying him down gently on the bed. “I’ll have to keep you away from Charlie Weasley then – his beard’s massive now.”
“Bugger,” Harry muttered, irritated at his own curiosity. For some reason he just felt like he wanted to check on the omega again. Draco had been in such a horrendous state yesterday, his entire delicate frame wracked with tremors. Harry decided it must just be the alpha side of him, so uncomfortable at seeing an omega in distress. Harry figured he would feel much better once he had confirmed the boy was fine and then he could get on with life as usual.
Draco padded over to the bed, tugging off his slipper socks and looking around him. With the raging storm outside, the bed just didn’t feel quite right that night. Draco could sense himself growing rather irritated with how flat the duvet was, how tightly the sheets were tucked underneath the mattress.
“Like I was saying,” Remus continued, “you could authorise him to take his inheritance out of that and instead open a more accessible account at Gringotts. Then all you would need is to sign once on an annual release form and Draco could do whatever he wanted with his money. Or, for a small fee, you can extend the financial freedom to last five or ten years.”
“Quite,” Remus smiled. The other man seemed to give up on the socks, casting a charm instead to send them flying into various drawers where they would at least be out of sight. “You know, being a werewolf allows me access to a layer of scents and physical cues that would elude most alphas.”
After breakfast, where Draco had found himself surprisingly hungry and scarfed down two helpings of fried eggs, the two of them made their way to the Hospital Wing.
Dean shrugged as he quickly trotted after the Weasleys, leaving Hermione, Harry and Draco to make their way down the path. They eventually came out to a small, circular grove with a small fountain. The fountain itself was a stone sculpture in the shape of a Christmas stocking with water bubbling out from the top of it. Sure enough, small clove-studded oranges were floating in the pool, along with paper sailing boats.
“Seamus, might I suggest that you simply buy the baby a teddy bear?” Luna stated looking surprisingly content for someone who had cold custard dripping down her nose.
“What?” Harry grimaced, he had naively hoped that he would just be able to walk away now that his role, or lack thereof, had been established. Although of course Harry had realised the spell would be ended, he hadn’t anticipated actually having to be involved so directly. No omega would consider having a child whilst they were unmated, despite it being old fashioned bullshit, that was the way it worked. There was an element of biological sensibility to it as well, for omegas were ill designed to carry a child to term without an alpha’s support.
Shadowfax emerged from under the covers and pushed herself into Draco’s lap, purring.
Malfoy tucked away his quill and notebook, “We probably shouldn’t linger here unnecessarily. I’d nip it out for you now, but I wasn’t expecting to do a removal straight away, and I don’t have my proper PPE, so that’ll have to wait, I’m afraid.”
“So you wouldn’t call your work allegorical or instructive at all? Nothing about your personal history to be inferred from it, even in subtext?”
Harry was very taken aback by that explanation.
“Thank you,” Draco said uneasily. Then, “I think I’m supporting Hufflepuff, actually. I’d just as soon have one like yours.”
“You’re trying to make me gush, and I’ll do it just to embarrass you. I absolutely gobbled them up, and I’m in agonies for the third one. You have a fascinating mind; your imagination staggers me. You can’t think how difficult it’s been not to mention them at all to you these last few days. How’s that?”
“But why does it wear down?” Theodore asked.
“There’s no need to look so smug about it,” Draco said with his eyes still shut.
Malfoy drew his arm back and yanked his sleeve down, “What does it look like, Potter?” He was clearly trying for his old sneer, but he looked young and frightened and embarrassed.
Draco leaned back against the settee as well so that their faces were level, still smirking, “Ah but I’ve known all that for years, and now you’re giving me new information as well. I’d no idea you find me handsome.”
On the first day at Padfoot’s, Harry had offered to sleep in the guest room but Draco had shyly told him that was unnecessary seeing as they had already shared a bed the night before coming down to London.
“That’s bloody stupid,” Harry spat angrily.
Although Harry’s custody of Draco would end after the baby was born, he was sure the alpha wouldn’t let his child live in squalor. Regardless, Draco knew he wasn’t welcome back at the Lestranges, not that he would ever subject his baby to Bellatrix.
“Well I think he wanted to go,” Hermione snapped, clearly irritated at only herself, “and he had it in his head that you might take him as a reward or celebration or something.”
“Draco, shit, look at me – you can’t do this right now okay? I can’t be in the room,” Harry pleaded. He wondered if Draco had ever experienced a heat off of suppressants before. He very much doubted that Bellatrix would have allowed such a thing.
“Y-Yes please,” Draco replied, finally opening his eyes. He chewed on his lip as he watched Harry carefully cup the second breast in his other hand. This one didn’t immediately produce milk so Harry gently began to squeeze both of them, massaging in careful, caressing motions as his thumbs swept over the painfully erect buds. Both of Draco’s nipples were standing in stiff, pink peaks before he let out a high pitched whine and trickles of almost clear milk began dribbling again from his right breast.
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy, I can see that your colostrum has fully come in, nothing to worry about, often happens around the midway point with male omegas. Are you feeling any discomfort around the breast area?”
Harry’s jeans tightened further, he could feel how wet he was with precome and he had to shift in the seat to ease his own discomfort. He regarded Draco thoughtfully before giving the boy’s breast another squeeze. “I’m proud of you Draco,”
“And that day you were offered a position at Hogwarts,” Remus breathed out softly, “where Harry Potter would spend eleven years of his life.”
Draco felt Harry move backwards on the bed, holding the omega’s slender hips steady. He whined with anticipation as he felt the thick blunt head of Harry’s cock press against his twitching entrance. Harry squeezed him tightly, pressing reassuring patterns into Draco’s skin with calloused fingers. The older man leant down to kiss up Draco’s spine, licking in between the notches.
There were a few moments of silence before Ron sighed guiltily, “I didn’t mean to upset you mate.”
“You’re literally a demon,” Harry laughed, shaking his head.
Draco laughed before trying his own and discovering it was spiced plum, it was particularly pleasant and warming.
Harry took a gratifyingly long sip of his pint as Ron returned to their table with a family sized packet of crisps and a bottle of pear cider for Hermione. There was a fair crowd in the Hog’s Head that evening and Harry could see Ginny, Dean, Luna and several others coming in from the windy dark outside.
“Are you disgusted?” Draco asked, fidgeting with the glittery plastic buttons of the cardigan.
“F-Fine,” Draco nodded. “That was silly of me. I just wasn’t thinking and suddenly smelled an alpha, I forgot we were in public.”
“From you both huh?” Sirius gave his godson a pointed smirk as Harry’s face made a strange expression before glaring at the older man.
Harry twiddled his thumbs, listening to the rustling sounds of fabric coming from behind the curtain. Draco had been a little while but Harry didn’t want to pressure him by asking if he needed any help.
“I mean like, I know some omegas prefer more traditional things, dresses and stuff,” Harry continued ineloquently, no one he had ever been around had really shown an interest in fashion. Ginny just wore what made her look good whilst Hermione mostly opted for comfort, an attitude Harry tended to adopt for himself.
“I’m so proud of how well you’ve been handling this pregnancy Draco,” Harry whispered, quickly casting a wandless muffliato around them. “You’ve been so brave, so good.”
“Oh,” Sirius replied, “well why the hell didn’t you say so? I’m not
“I’ve had a cold!” Olive exclaimed, still looking rather put out. “I only knew when I saw the bump and -“
Although omega rights still weren’t great, if Bellatrix had her way Draco would have already been yanked out of school and mated off to some pureblood family.
“Alpha…” Draco groaned, trying to turn his body so as to get closer to Harry. Harry took a deep breath, instantly regretting it as his nostrils filled with apple pie and frosted honeydew. Harry was already rock hard, his body’s natural response to the writhing, slicking omega in his arms. Harry began to get up out of the bath, careful not to knock into Draco. He wandlessly cast for the plug to start draining its contents as Draco gave a moan of displeasure at the alpha moving away, his omega perceiving a rejection.
“No!” Draco cried, feeling revolted and horrified. He took a wobbly step backwards.
Draco nodded, even though Harry probably didn’t see the motion, occupying himself with gently rearranging the omega. Draco steadied himself on all fours before allowing Harry to lift him up in a way that meant there was no uncomfortable strain.
you’re possessive as fuck.”
“How about we get them all?” Harry smiled indulgently, “We can always wrap up what you don’t eat now and save it for later.”
Harry stared at the blinking lights of the kebab shop opposite when suddenly a blue wisp of light streaked down the alleyway. A moment later, an otter materialised in front of him, speaking in Hermione’s worried voice.
“Of all the insolent –“ Snape began as Professor McGonagall raised her hand.
“Lupin,” Severus greeted coldly, his eyes narrowing as a still apoplectic looking Sirius pushed past him and barrelled down on Harry with accusatory hisses.
Harry glanced across to Draco, the younger boy was gesturing animatedly at Neville and Katie whilst they discussed some sort of semi sentient plant that had recently been discovered in Brazil.
year.” Harry added, going slightly red in the face. “Look,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck, “are you absolutely sure the baby’s mine? Because I genuinely don’t know any Draco Malfoy and I certainly haven’t gotten anyone pregnant.”
Harry crawled into the nest, his large arms bracketing Draco as the alpha bent over him, staring down at Draco’s face with enough intensity to make him shrink slightly.
“I reckon so,” Hermione smiled. Draco turned towards them, evidently having heard his name, he looked at Harry curiously.
“Not like that you daft numpty,” Sirius scoffed.
Harry tensed slightly, that felt like a strangely barbed jab at Draco.
“Draco? May I come in?” Hermione called out. Draco hopped off the bed to unlock the door and allow the beta to enter.
“Some Christmas shopping in the cards then,” the lady beamed and Harry could feel Draco relax. “So loves, do you want anything from the trolley? Can I interest you in a chocolate frog? All proceeds going to the War Orphan’s Trust.”
Harry slid off the bed before tugging his pyjama trousers down, revealing his own semi hard cock. He heard Draco make a strangled noise before joining the younger boy back on the mattress.
“Okay,” Draco gave Harry a shy smile.
“Yeah,” Harry shrugged nonchalantly, “but I’d like to be around at first you know, help look after the baby – change nappies, that sort of thing.”
After his nightly cleansing and care spells, along with brushing his teeth and having changed, Draco exited the bathroom back into the comfortable warmth of the main suite.
Harry tossed back a big gulp of the drink before smacking his lips, “Oh! It’s dandelion.”
“I’m glad,” Harry smiled softly, crawling over to rest against the side of the tub and drawing his husband and baby back against him. Draco sighed serenely as Harry pressed a loving kiss to the top of his scalp.
“You alright?” Harry asked. “Madam Pomfrey says we should avoid apparition during the third trimester but I read that we’re okay for now.”
“You need to be careful, little one,” Harry murmured, his lips ruffled Draco’s hair as he spoke, the other man’s head bowed down towards him. Draco squeezed his eyes tightly shut as he felt his thighs start to tremble, instinctively he pushed back ever so slightly, eliciting a muted intake of breath from the older man. There was something huge and hard nudging Draco’s right buttock and the hand on his belly was diffusing his skin with heat like a brand.
“Oh,” Draco allowed himself to be helped up by Harry before falling into place beside him on the walk back to the annexe. “I d-didn’t know whether we were going shopping today.”
Draco beamed, swinging his legs against the chair.
“She’s going to play professional quidditch?” Draco asked, looking surprised. “That’s so cool.”
“Of course,” Katie replied, nudging Draco’s shoulder carefully, “I’ve got a new sundress that I want to wear but I thought it might be a little short to have on whilst running about the castle looking for you.”
“Molly says Harry’s got a heart of gold,” the third woman announced, “besides, young men will do as they will if you know what I mean.”
“Yeah,” Harry grinned sheepishly, “Mione and Luna helped me with the charm work – oh hey, watch this,” Harry leaned in and whispered something to the fondant dragons before they zoomed up to the very top tier and blew fiery breaths across the eighteen, tall silver candles there.
want in here?” Harry asked, removing his arm from Draco and walking around the globe, inspecting it.
Draco jerked his head up to see Damien Tuppence, a fellow Slytherin Seventh Year omega slide onto the bench opposite him. For the most part, Damien had always ignored Draco, the other boy was incredibly pretty with rosy cheeks, blue eyes and dark curly hair.
Harry wrinkled his nose before sighing and gently carding his fingers across Draco’s scalp. “You see? I don’t even know if Draco’s had any weird cravings. What if
“Here,” Harry said to Draco, cutting a large slice of strudel and offering it across the table, “I don’t know if you’ll want custard with it after that.”
“Sod off!” Ron scoffed as Hermione laughed in the background, still managing to keep reading her own book at the same time. “Like you don’t need yours
Over the last few months, Harry had managed to arrange for landscapers to come in and charm the hedges and flowerbeds into full glory. There was even a sizeable pond with a fountain and ducks. Different coloured lilies floated in the water whilst brightly dappled koi fish meandered lazily in the depths, hiding from the August sun under emerald clouds of pondweed.
“Dennis Creevey says he saw you in the Hospital Wing,” Damien continued, leaning forwards with his eyes scanning Draco critically as if expecting him to start glowing or something. “He heard Madam Pomfrey talking about your
“I’ll give you the completed forms back next lesson,” Severus informed him. “For now, please make yourself scarce. I need to don gloves and goggles for the next stage of this experiment and I will not be responsible for explaining any mishaps to that alpha lout of yours.”
In the middle, sat a gigantic cake covered in different shades of frosting. On one tier, miniature green sugar dragons raced around, toasting decorative marshmallows with puffs of flame. On another, Draco could see magically blooming lilies and narcissi being visited by honeybees that looked like they had been fashioned out of pieces of toffee popcorn.
The group plunged into the mass of trees, laughing and whooping as they heard other maze goers calling back to them and shouting clearly erroneous instructions in a bid to get to the centre first.
Before Harry could launch himself at his godfather, the patio doors cracked open. The guests fell silent and Luna happily started up on the cello again.
“Bellatrix!” the man shouted angrily but the woman simply seemed amused as she cackled in response.
“Be winter before you know it,” Ron yawned, heaving himself out of bed and gingerly changing into clothes for the day.
“Sorry, Harry,” Damien smiled, “the train got a bit bumpy there, I thought I might fall over.”
“Okay,” Harry nodded, feeling his own anxious tension start to subside. He considered whether Draco had wet the bed? He knew that Fleur had joked about nearly having accidents during her own pregnancy, the baby pressing on her bladder. Then again, Harry would have definitely recognised the smell of urine, what he had caught a whiff of this morning wasn’t unpleasant at all, in fact it almost reminded Harry of…
“Wait,” Harry said quickly, jerking back to Draco and quickly tying the front of his hospital gown together and concealing his previously exposed breasts. Draco smiled shyly at him whilst raising a blond eyebrow.
Draco pursed his lips in a smile, feeling the elation of his inner omega at having pleased his alpha. “Aunt Bella would
“What?” Harry snapped, turning to Hermione, whose shocked expression made him sag with exhaustion. Harry had spent all day yesterday and then most of the night thinking about the strange little omega squirreled away up in the hospital wing, clothed in a too big gown.
Draco stared at him for a few moments longer before sighing miserably, sagging down in Harry’s arms. It wasn’t exactly the reaction that Harry had been hoping for.
“So you created a spell?” Remus asked, his eyes were now back on Snape as Harry watched the two men converse.
“James would have found it hilarious you were having a baby with the Malfoy boy,” Remus commented wanly. “Merlin knows he would have enjoyed rubbing that in Lucius’ face. Lucius was a year below us but he was insufferable even back then. I mean, it wasn’t quite the distain your dad had for Snape of course.”
^*^*^*^*^
“I’m sorry you had to do that,” Draco cringed, he had forgotten he’d promised to meet Katie at the west exit at noon.
“Hey,” Harry said as he drew up to the omega, who was sat down with his knees hugged up to his chest. “That wasn’t what it looked like okay?”
A sharp rapping on the door made both men flinch.
“I’m okay,” Draco replied, though his voice was muffled as he was squished against Harry’s own knitted jumper.
“Aren’t you cold?” Harry frowned, Colum was still only wearing his t-shirt and there was probably an overnight frost coming.
“But I’m an omega,” Draco continued, almost pouting.
“We’ll make one,” Harry replied, immediately sure that he would do anything to get to see Draco in this dress again.
Draco shook his head, “I’m fine, thank you.” He ignored Harry’s teasing smile. Draco knew full well the alpha found it amusing that Draco refused to take off his large fuzzy cardigan in front of Ron. Even if the older students had more progressive views of omegas, there were some things that just weren’t done in Draco’s mind. That argument however, always felt a bit weak whenever Draco looked down and saw his stomach.
“I’m really embarrassed,” Draco admitted, his nose scrunching up as he stared at the floor.
“I have photos of her and she always wore s-such pretty outfits. I really like…” Draco’s pink tongue darted out to lick the end of his finger before he leafed through the magazine in front of him, “this one!” Draco announced happily, twisting the page so Harry could see a full spread of different outfits. They were all very sweet and elegant looking, with more lace and ruffles than Harry had expected.
Draco’s moans and whines became louder in volume, causing Harry to cast a muffling spell before allowing himself to make the same level of noise, grunting animalistically every time his throbbing length ploughed back into his pliant and welcoming mate.
“Right,” Ginny declared loudly, sliding off the bed to march over to Seamus and jab him in the chest, managing to look intensely menacing despite being a fair bit smaller than him. “You, Finnegan, are not to go breathing a word of this to anyone. We don’t want the whole school getting the wrong end of the stick okay?”
“Sirius,” Remus interjected warningly.
“Don’t be afraid of what daft idiots think they know about you okay?” Harry squeezed Draco’s shoulder again, acutely aware of his fingertips touching the smooth, exposed skin. “I know you’re not a gold digger Draco, to be honest you’re probably technically richer than I am. Not to mention that so far you’re doing a pretty lousy job of taking my money from me.”
Draco’s panic was bubbling up over again, his heart felt like a hummingbird’s as it beat rapidly in his chest. Suddenly, gentle hands clutched at his shoulders. Draco immediately started to try and wriggle free when there was a hushed voice in his ear.
“Ah,” Harry laughed in understanding as large plates of apple and cherry pastries appeared along with jugs of thick custard.
“Oh thank fuck,” Harry groaned, collapsing down onto the floor with relief as Draco crawled into his lap and began peppering the older man’s face with kisses. “Are you sure sweetheart? You’re not just saying that?”
“Hey,” Harry murmured. “Are you back?”
“You’re so big,” Draco said as he blinked owlishly at Harry.
“We have peacocks?!” Draco asked, his eyes widening excitedly.
Harry refocused his effort, forming a circle around the breast with his fingers and lightly tugging and pressing.
“She might be expecting Draco to turn up on Boxing Day with a mating bite though,” Ginny smirked as Harry groaned. “Honestly, apparently the other day Fred tried to tell her it wasn’t like that and she nearly yelled his ear off about how she knows you’re an upstanding young man and would never abandon a pregnant omega.”
“There’s strudel for pudding today,” Draco told him, “I wanted to save some space.”
Draco jumped as an owl knocked on his window. He hurried over to make sure it hadn’t disturbed his nesting robin before passing it a bit of broken off rice cracker. Draco detached the rolled up scroll from its leg before closing the window again and shivering. It was bitingly cold out and Draco was now only in his thin undershirt.
was me attempting to be honourable.” Harry paused, “But I can assure you Draco, everything I’ve felt since then has been because I want you, not just our child, but you as well. I would never offer to bite someone out of duty, you’re forgetting who raised me.” Harry grinned at Draco, whose previously shuttered off expression seemed to be opening up to something resembling wary hopefulness.
“Hmm,” said Harry, understanding Theodore’s conundrum. Excepting the snake--which had to be discounted as it refused to leave--all the creatures were very charming. “Well, which of them do you think you’d most like to talk to? It isn’t only about having a cuddle. Or hang on, maybe you’d rather have a post owl?”
“They’re going into
Harry’s television and VCR were objects of great fascination to Theodore, and he asked to have a go with them nearly every time he came round. In preparation for his stay, Harry had gotten very enthusiastic at the video rental near his flat and bought a perhaps excessive percentage of their secondhand stock. There was a teetery stack of cases piled up round the telly he’d just brought back to Grimmauld Place. Harry was particularly looking forward to introducing Theodore to
“It’s sort of a long story. Years ago, there was a very violent and greedy man who liked to use magic to control people and steal from people and hurt people, and one of the ways he controlled people was with cursed pieces of jewelry. He’d give them to his followers and use them to give orders from a long way away. But the jewelry would also turn on any follower who betrayed him.” Draco pushed up his sleeve to show Theo the fading red marks on his arm, “It got hold of me today, while I was trying to put a containment charm on it to keep it safe before I took it away to be destroyed.”
Harry knew he shouldn’t be shocked. Theodore was a bright child, and his grandmother was quite an old woman with a serious illness. Harry took a deep breath and reached for calm, “I want to tell you that Granny’s going to be fine. I hope-we all hope she will. But that isn’t the sort of thing you can know in advance, Theodore. Sometimes things work out how they should, and sometimes. They don’t. The healers at St. Mungo’s are very good indeed, and they’re going to do everything they can. Spattergroit is nasty, but they’ve seen it loads of times before, and they know what to do.”
“I had no idea your nosiness and poor manners had an off switch, Potter. Where on earth did you get these marvellous scones?”
Dean rolled his eyes with evident affection, “Oh he’s up to his nose in wedding planning but convinced I don’t know a hydrangea from a satsuma. You’re coming to the wedding, yeah? Seamus’d never forgive me if I had you in the shop and didn’t make you promise.”
Harry laughed, “Of course.” And he ungloved Draco’s hand and tucked it into his coat, against his heart.
“Thank you,” Harry sipped from the cup, expecting coffee or perhaps tea, but it was hot chocolate. “We should probably go through so that Theo can get onto the train.”
“So Haz,” Dudley remarked around a mouthful of roast potatoes.They were sitting across from each other at a very long table in the garden at the Burrow for the monthly Sunday dinner. Dudley had been a bit shy of joining initially, but now he turned up more often than Harry did. He was very popular with Arthur, and they’d developed a habit of going for drives together after the meal was finished. “How’s the dad thing going?” Harry had already progressed to pudding and was enjoying a helping of raspberry fool but Dudley’s appetite was rivaled only by Ron’s, so he took longer over each course.
Harry pointed his wand at the mess, “Evanesco.” The pasta vanished, leaving behind a greasy stain on the duvet.
Theodore nodded, “Like my dad and like you.”
In addition to navy blue robes with the school crest embroidered on the back and a navy cap with a low peak, Theodore’s school uniform required plain black lace up shoes, “Won’t you get detention for being out of uniform?”
The hostess set off at half a trot, and they followed briskly behind her, through an ordinary dining room, filled with muggles on dates, down a dim corridor and through a door that looked like it was going to lead to the kitchen. It didn’t.
“He’s not your responsibility; he’s mine!” Harry hissed. “You’re not his dad just because you know how to be a werewolf already.”
Harry thought guiltily of his withdrawal from much of the wizarding world, “It really fucking is, yeah. It’s scary.”
When Harry opened his palm to look at it, it opened its miniscule beak and spoke aloud in Draco’s voice, “I shouldn’t be at all cross if you decided to drop into my room this morning. Quick as you like.” Harry smiled and tucked the crane into his pyjama pocket, then got out of bed.
“Oh, do you want me to read it aloud?”
“It’s not bad,” Theodore protested, looking rather startled at Harry’s reaction. “It’s not like. Mean. I wasn’t going to laugh at him!”
When Harry finished counting, he went in search of Draco, through the sitting room as it seemed to have been the direction Draco went in.
“What werewolf thing?” asked Bill.
Harry tried for a moment to remember how it felt to be in love with Ginny, “I don’t know if that translates to being able to write about it. Anyway, the person who sent the patronus is a woman, and she kind of needs to stay a woman to make some other things in the plot work properly.”
“You ought to be using a spatula and not your wand,” Harry told him.
Theodore popped up every now and again to present some piece of analysis to Harry, whom he regarded as a quidditch expert, second only to Ginny. Theodore happened to be sitting with them for a particularly long time out when Draco got up to get them all hot chocolates from concessions.
“Er,” Theo glanced at Harry again. “A shout?”
Theodore thought about that, “Do you know Harry?”
Dean seemed to notice Theo and Draco for the first time, “I reckon you didn’t come in so I could give you a hard time about your hair, though. Wand working all right, I hope?”
“How do you get rid of them?” Harry asked.
Theo accepted the handshake, “Thank you.”
“I’m only here to do my duty, you know.”
“I told him about us,” Harry confessed, taking his cup off Draco and swigging heartily.
“Oh, right. I think I remember seeing something about that in the nutrition leaflet.” Harry stowed the wine and set a pitcher of gillywater on the table instead before taking a seat and digging into his own helping of pie. “So what’s on the agenda for this evening? Any last minute advice?”
“I know I said I wanted to suck you off, and I do. But er. I’m also feeling a bit fickle.”
“I’m going to learn as well, when I’ve had enough Potions for them to take me,” Theo said staunchly.
“Theo,” said Harry a little sharply. “We don’t make personal remarks about other people’s bodies.”
“I don’t mind if you see,” Draco said carelessly. Then added, “I do have to take all my clothes off, first.”
Harry grinned, “I’m that good, I guess. I could take it back, if you like?”
It was a very, very jolly Christmas. And all too soon, it was over and done with, and Theodore was on the train back to Hogwarts, leaving Harry alone in Grimmauld Place again. Harry found it almost unbearably quiet. He even missed Twinkle. He had to take to leaving the telly on to keep himself company. Fortunately, he had foreseen his gloom and planned a special date with Draco to lift his spirits with both companionship and smugness. Draco had been asking about going to see a play together, and Harry had finally managed to book tickets to a production of Hamlet.
Malfoy donned his protective gloves, then raised his Dark Detector and stepped into the room. Harry followed close behind him, pulling on his own protective gear. The Dark Detector was vibrating so hard that Harry could hear its high buzzing against Malfoy’s  gloves, like the whine of some tiny insect. Dust clouded up round their boots when they trod on the ancient rug, and Harry was grateful for the face covering that protected his nose and mouth. Apart from the dust thick on every surface, the room was pin neat.
Theo took a crunchy bite and answered with his mouth full, “I will.” Theo’s hair was blue-black that morning, rather blending in with his cap so that his head seemed to be peaked and not only his hat. There was also a new scattering of freckles over his face that Harry supposed was inspired by their night at the Burrow, surrounded by Weasleys. Harry enjoyed these little tweaks through which Theo showed his clannishness. It filled him with affection for his whole family.
“Yes, thank you,” said Draco. “And sparkling water for the table, if you have it. Or would you prefer still?” He looked at Harry.
Draco lit his wand and pointed it at the edge of the portrait, “Well come and have a look.”
Draco sighed heavily, “Very true.”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand, “It was a bit complicated, but I’m really glad I got to see him. No one ever even told me anything about him, really. Not even Sirius, and he lived with my dad’s parents for a while.”
Theodore nodded and smiled, “I didn’t think you would.”
“All right, silly,” Harry said laughing. “It’s my turn now. Or your turn, rather. You’re It.”
Harry spared one moment to cast a Shield Charm on Theodore, then flung himself between his godson and the monster. He almost laughed aloud in relief when the creature’s shape wavered, then with a loud crack and a waft of rotting stench shifted into a Dementor.
“Thanks. Very gracious of you,” said Malfoy grumpily. “Now you’re ahead again.”
, and
Draco tossed his hair defiantly, “I know I’d very much like to suck your cock.”
“Yeah, well I’ve run out of guest rooms, and you told me this one isn’t dangerous--hello darling, aren’t you beautiful? Oooh! Steady on, now.”
“Though not dirty knickers,” Malfoy smirked but there was a smudge of jam on his cheek that made the expression less annoying somehow. Harry wondered if Malfoy’d had that particular dimple at Hogwarts and his ears got a little warmer.
Harry swapped the mugs round so that Malfoy had the empty one and poured in a little milk, “Well, I am. I was a bit shocked, but I shouldn’t have been. Nosy. Rude.”
“Harry!” Hagrid was inside as well, sitting on a painfully compressed poof pulled up to Luna and Ginny’s kitchen table. Ginny was sat across from him in an ancient Gryffindor jumper and faded Harpies leggings, holding a steaming mug between both hands and resting her stocking feet on Fang’s back.
Malfoy swallowed his mouthful before he answered, “Yes, of course. I’m sure he is.”
“Missing him. Wishing I could get his advice or just talk to him again. I thought I’d come in here, and be knocked out with it. But it’s not like that now. He seems just as far away as he did before I opened the door, and that’s sad on its own, I suppose. But I can bear it.”
“Good morning, Theodore. Potter,” Draco handed Harry one of the cups, then dug in his jacket pocket and handed Theo a paper bag. “Just a bun. In case you missed breakfast.”
Harry gave him another little shove, “Well I’ve got eyes in my head! I can see!”
Draco laughed, “I agree, your face is generally quite pleasant, but perhaps you had indigestion at the photo shoot.”
“But it would have gone like that for me. How it did for him in the end. If you hadn’t. Been there.”
“Oh, that’s intriguing.”
“Yeah, suppose so. Sorry, I should have. I should have asked you first, shouldn’t I? It just seemed like the moment for it, so I said it.”
“Well you do, but sometimes you look ready, but then you want to spend another hour doing indiscernible things to your hair.”
Theodore shrugged, drew a deep breath and bellowed, “
“Don’t bother; let me send you to mine! Muggle hairdressers are where it’s at, Harry. You still in that tiny flat here in London?”
“Well that was a waste of an afternoon,” Malfoy griped as Harry followed him through the Floo back into Grimmauld Place some hours later. “You might have just given me the dittany yourself and saved us both the trouble of a visit to St. Mungo’s.”
“What?” snapped Harry. “What?! Why are you looking at each other like that? Don’t tell me you already knew?”
Theodore tried five wands in total before sending up a blaze of turquoise sparks, the same colour as his hair.
“I saw him for a bit for one day. You’ve been seeing him regularly for ages. What do you make of him now?”
“There you have me, I don’t know!”
“It’s really disgusting,” Draco assured him. “Sometimes I think it would be better if it weren’t hot. But they tried improving the flavour about five years ago, so now it’s bitter, scalding, and tastes vaguely of banana. It’s a bit like eating a boiled banana skin, but without the interesting texture.”
Harry stroked his back, “I’m so glad you enjoyed it. It’s a lot, isn’t it? Live theatre’s really intense sometimes.”
Draco tossed his hair, sweeping a jasmine-scented breeze over Harry’s face, “We’re having dinner, Potter. Haven’t you ever been on a date before?”
“Hermione’s all right, but I shouldn’t like Theo to feel like I was noising his business about the whole family, so maybe not your mum. She can be a bit er.”
“No,” Harry said firmly. “One to start, please.”
“Well all right then,” Malfoy finished his tea and stood up. “Back into the fray.”
Draco shrugged, “My second boyfriend was muggle-born and he seemed to think I would get something out of those Lord of the Rings books, so he made me read all of them.”
Harry’s own ears were getting hot, but he couldn’t help laughing, “You’re clearly being handsome on purpose; you can’t act all surprised when people notice.”
“Careful, T-Theodore,” said Harry reflexively.
“Thanks,” Harry leaned in to kiss him. “I had two showers today, and I’m wearing lip balm.”
“But why shouldn’t we?”
Dean swept the wand away, “No? Try this one. Poplar and phoenix feather. Nine and a half inches and quite inflexible.”
“You aren’t coming to live with me because we’ve given up on Granny,” Harry said intently, resting one hand lightly on Theodore’s shoulder. “Of course we haven’t. But she does need treating, and even once she gets well, likely she’ll need quite a lot of rest. We’ve had to plan for a long stay with me to make sure you’re looked after, because that’s our job. Looking after you. Yes?”
Harry reached into his coat pocket for his cap and stretched it over his coils at once with a hard shiver, “I was going to suggest we go for a nightcap, but I may have frozen to the pavement, actually.”
“Right, I know that. I just,” Harry trailed off.
“Ouch!” Harry dropped his hand at once. The handle was buzzing so sharply, Harry felt almost as if he’d been stung. “What was that?”
Harry didn’t have all that much in the way of things either, as-despite the small fortune his parents had left him and the larger fortune he’d made from his book--he had a horror of spending money on himself. He suspected that was what had prevented him from making Grimmauld Place properly livable before, though when he confided those feelings to Ron, Ron had laughed and said, “But you’re paying rent even though you already have free accommodation, numpty, so it can’t be that.”
“I’ll be in school, then!” Theo objected.
“Right-o.” Draco bent to kiss Harry, melting hot kisses, along his jaw, down his neck, along his collarbone and  back to his mouth. He licked his palm and wrapped one hand around Harry’s cock to give him occasional firmer and firmer squeezes. Harry groaned and pushed back against Draco’s hand with every squeeze. Draco pressed himself flush on top of Harry, rocking and squirming against him, his own erection scalding hot where it met Harry’s skin.
“Well it’s sort of casual,” Theo agreed, nodding. “Some people don’t like it because they think it sounds a bit monstery, and they say lycanthrope instead. I usually say lycanthrope in company, but I like calling myself a werewolf because it’s cooler. It is all a bit much to take in all at once. I’ve brought you a book, though. It really helped me.”
“Most magic doesn’t last forever,” Harry told him.
“Okay,” Theodore leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder for a tiny moment, then let go of him. “I know.” Theodore drew a deep breath, “Harry?”
“Maybe want to teach me some last minute hexes?” Theo suggested. “Just in case.”
“You were?!” Theo looked shocked and dismayed. “But why would you do that if he was so bad?”
“So this is where the magic happens,” Draco zeroed in on Harry’s desk nearly the identical moment they walked into the library.
“I hope you’ll come back,” the welcome wizard smiled sincerely. “If you come on Saturday mornings, you’ll usually see me. Just look for the bloke with the pink hair and come say hi. I’m Kal.”
Harry huffed but held out his arm, “Shall I Side-Along you?”
“What’s affinity?” Theo asked.
“Astute and nosy though you are, Potter, I hope you can accept that you do not know every teensy tiny detail about my past, present, and future. And anyway, this isn’t about you; it’s about Theodore.”
“No, it’s v-” Malfoy checked himself. “I’m sorry. It wasn’t you, it was my fault.”
And then it was over. Draco was lying on the kitchen floor, in the shape of a lean, grey wolf. After a moment, he pushed himself up to sitting, lifted his head, and let out a long, sweet howl. Then he bent and sniffed Shadowfax, and let himself be sniffed in return before turning his attention to Harry.
“I think I’m okay. Will you let me use the video?”
No one took any notice.
“What sort of godfather would I be if I didn’t see that you could keep your things tidy without magic? Put your bag in your room, please Theo unless you want to do your homework before you have your tea.”
“It was okay,” Theo answered, still sounding expectant.
But the box had split along the middle, each half falling aside to reveal what looked like a snippet of yew branch, covered over in soft gold. At once, the branch extended, wrapping itself around Malfoy’s fingertips. Malfoy gave a yell of pain and surprise, but even over his voice, Harry could hear another voice. A familiar high, sibilant voice that turned his stomach.
Harry expected Draco to either admit that they had hated each other at Hogwarts or to try and politely defer, but he was surprised when Draco did neither.
Harry’s brief silence appeared to make Draco rather nervous, “Is it all right with you if I seduce you now? It won’t be at all fun if you don’t enjoy it as much as I do, so do speak up.”
“It’s not fine! I can’t believe we decided to book the move for the same week as the premier. We’ve both gone insane. Theo’s going into care, because his guardians are unfit.”
Harry snorted, “Thanks.”
“Good,” they walked on quietly for a few moments until Harry spoke again, “So where are we going?”
Harry was digging in Draco’s bag before he’d even finished speaking. He turned up the pouch and extracted the potion flasks, then used his wand to uncork them. He carried them over to the bed and passed Draco the Strengthening Solution first.
“I’m not gone,” Harry protested. “I just. Don’t get out much. And besides I wrote two books; isn’t that enough of a presence? Malfoy, are you trying to tell me that you’ve missed me?”
Theo nodded. His eyes spilled over, and he fixed them on his rather soupy ice cream.
“Not very.”
“Do you? How do you know?”
“Well, I think the conspicuous question is, why have you written the books you’ve written? Wouldn’t the more obvious choice be an account of what you went through during your time at Hogwarts? Or your disappearance leading up to the defeat of You-Know-Who?”
“Shhhh,” Draco answered when Harry tapped on his door. “Come in. Quietly.”
Draco spun another circuit in Harry’s desk chair, and his fair hair came loose from its knot and fanned out about his face, “Need a bit more, do you? Greedy. You’ve opened up a great gaping hole in my life, Potter. I want something only you can give me, and I’ll never forgive you for it, ever. Novels! I’m completely ruined, and it’s all your fault. I like your books even better than your scones. Appalling.”
“Well, you’re not exactly shaped for using a toilet!”
“Yeah!” Theo agreed at once.
Theodore looked uncertain, as if he thought Harry might be making a joke and he wasn't sure if he was meant to laugh, “Really?” his mouth twisted between a smile and a frown for a moment, “But it isn’t real. It’s only a film. It isn’t real, is it?”
Theo wanted to help with the tea, which Harry was pleased with, so Theo made ham and cheese toasties while Harry warmed up some onion soup from the night before. Even Draco helped by making a pot of tea and thanked Theo for cooking, which Harry was also pleased with.
“We don’t usually pay house calls at the weekend,” Malfoy said thoughtfully. “But I can come back tomorrow if you really would rather have it out as soon as possible. Wouldn’t blame you.”
“Yeah, of course,” Harry kissed Draco again. “Of course I’ll stay.”
Malfoy smirked, and even that was not quite the expression Harry remembered from Hogwarts, “Does she now? Fancy that.”
“And anyway I didn’t like monsters and all those foul things. They just sort of.”
“But I wanted to see the cursebreaking!”
“Because you have school and only a fortnight left of the term, so you shouldn’t miss any of it,” Harry answered absently, stirring his coffee.
“He asked me if we’re going to get married.”
“Harry,” Draco murmured presently, squirming quite hard.
“I thought I’d send Theodore through now and then nip back to his room and get a change of clothes and his school bag.”
“Well he was up to something, wasn’t he! I was right!”
Ron grinned, “Can be, yeah.”
Draco looked at Harry.
“It’s simple and easy to understand,” recited Theodore, clearly having prepared to persuade them. “And it has symbolic meaning as well, since a glade is a clearing in a forest. The world being the forest, and our house being the glade. The Glade. See?”
Harry was having a good writing day. He hadn’t been expecting one. Good writing days required adherence to all his writing rituals, and he wasn’t sure if they’d quite feel like home at Grimmauld Place, and he might need to work out some new ones or make adjustments. But they had felt cosy and familiar like a well worn jumper, even in the strange place. He was very pleased.
Theodore laughed and turned a pancake a little too hard, “Oof!”
A desire to laugh in relief mixed with annoyance at being caught out for being afraid when he hadn’t even noticed himself that he was afraid. Harry nodded. “I suppose I am,” he said rather stiffly.
Draco dragged in a long breath through his nose, “Most of the fortune necessary for its upkeep was sunk into the coup effort, and the rest was confiscated by the Ministry after the war. Since my parents both had their wands snapped and couldn’t even use glamours on it to pretend everything was fine while the roof fell in, they. Vacated. My mother fled to Romania where she has no doubt found herself a black market wand and a new blood supremacist husband and perhaps a second round of blond offspring. And my father. Fled this plane of existence. So. Not much family, not much home.”
“It’s horribly unprofessional of me, but as you’re helping with the ward anyway,” Malfoy seemed to have been prepared for this eventuality because in his satchel, he had spare gloves and an extra face shield for Harry to wear during the removal.
Draco covered his ears as well, “It’s all right, Theo. Loud as you can, now.”
“Everything all right?” Harry asked.
Harry let out a little shout of laughter, “You found me!” He hugged Draco about the neck and kissed Draco’s nose, because it seemed appropriate to match his exuberance. Then Harry let himself ooze out of the wardrobe. Draco had started up his triumphant frolicking again, and Harry rather wanted to join in, but he was laughing too much. When they had calmed down a little, Harry took the Disillusionment Charm off himself and started counting down from a hundred again while Draco beetled off to hide. Shadowfax had gone to sleep on Harry’s bed, and stayed behind.
“You can’t think your way into it,” she said with a shrug. “You just have to go out and get some experience. Take a chance. It’s a leap of faith.”
Theodore toed a loose thread in the rug, “Something about not wanting me to make a mess on the carpet, I think. I’m not going to make a mess,” he added. “I’m not a baby.”
“Go on,” Harry said quietly, trying not to smile. He put his hands over his ears.
Here Harry was interrupted because the Floo buzzed again, and Theo jumped out a moment later, nearly banging into Malfoy.
“It’s a bit funny to think about,” Luna said thoughtfully. “But he’s so much nicer than he was at school, so I don’t think anyone’s going to mind if you like each other now, Harry. No one who matters anyway.”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded. “You’re totally right. Our obsession with our own superiority, our exceptionalism sort of poisons our relationships with all our neighbours, doesn’t it? Muggles, lycanthropes, centaurs, merfolk, elves, goblins, veela, everyone. But we’re all intelligent. We all have culture and values and insight. And we all deserve to have equal influence over how our world functions. It doesn’t belong to wizards more than it does to anyone else.”
Harry frowned, “Are we talking about Theo or about you?”
“I know you didn’t,” Harry told him. “I don’t expect you to understand everything in the world before anyone’s told you about it. It’s okay not to know something, and it’s okay to ask if you want to find out. That’s a little bit different, though. Asking someone if they’re gay. Do you understand how it’s different?”
“Well, I can’t argue with that,” said Harry and helped himself. Draco sat down and dished out his own share, and they were all quietly eating for a moment.
“Hmm,” Harry set the food and drink down on the coffee table and came over to have a look at the pile. “Well what do you fancy?”
“Thought about it very loudly and interrogated me about the most horrible experience of my life.”
“You’re sure you’re all right?” Harry Conjured a glass and a stream of water to fill it.
Draco eased himself up into a half sitting position, leaning against Harry for support and swallowed down half the Strengthening Solution in two gulps. Then he was able to sit back against the headboard and sip the pain potion a little more slowly. He was paler than Harry had seen him in a long time and still tense with discomfort and sluggish with weariness, though he was moving a little easier now.
Harry counted backward from ten in his head before he answered, “I know. Right. I am in over my head.”
Draco’s cheeks were pinking quite prettily, “Yes, probably about twelve years ago.”
“Animosity?! Why would you be nursing animosity? I only saved your life in that fucking fire! I only saved your skin from Voldemort!”
Ginny sighed, “Yeah, you’ve said.”
“Good. No hard feelings. Let’s go and see about your cat.”
“Er. You’re welcome,” Harry said awkwardly after a moment’s silence.
Ginny shrugged, “Training’s starting again next week, so just resting up at the moment.”
“Okay,” said Theodore.
“It’s all right.” Draco smoothed his hair, as if getting embarrassed had mussed him, “Mind how you talk to me in future. I’m going to be a ravening beast presently, and I could easily tear you apart with my fangs, Harry Potter.”
“I am a cursebreaker, Potter! I know what a curse looks like!”
“Just come and find us in the portrait corridor when you’ve finished with that,” Draco advised.
Kal gave him the thumbs up, “Wow, big day for you!”
Theodore looked even more grave, “I’d just as soon not upset her while she’s ill.”
Harry shrugged, “‘S’all right. Didn’t the Healer say it was interacting with your Mark? I expect that’s why it grabbed you like that.”
“Lovely to have you. In that case, I’m not sure if you’re familiar with our menu at all. We do a selkie mermish fusion here. The menu is pre fixe, as people unfamiliar with those cuisines tend to find it a bit overwhelming to choose something from a list. The first course tonight is something we like to call swan feathers, though don’t worry; it’s nothing to do with feathers. They’re lovely and crispy, sort of our answer to breadsticks, served with a spicy kelp aioli. Then it’s an incredible braised eel for the main course. So tender it’s like biting into a wave. And for dessert, our fennel ice cream. Incredibly refreshing on the heels of the wild garlic in that braised eel. Now, while we work on the starter for you, would you like to try our flight of wild flower liqueurs?”
He turned to Draco, “Want to g-”
Draco watched a fairy land on a water lily and wipe its tiny brow, “Well. Your first name is on the tip of my tongue. But every time I nearly say it, I feel a bit.”
They decided on The Glade.
“Is a Tolkien reference too precious, do you think?” Draco asked. “I think it might be.”
“A beautiful genius, like her mum. I forgot you’d be here. I expect you walked with Teddy?”
Harry looked away and sighed, “All right, fine. For your piece of mind. Your room only, Theodore. And then you’ll have your tea and some piano practise.”
Draco reached out and took the basket, which he held up in front of his face to speak to Twinkle, “Don’t worry now. You’ll be on the train in a moment, and then at least you won’t be swinging about like this.”
Without even bothering to check if anyone was looking, he walked through the wall between Platform 9 and 10 and vanished. Theodore followed him eagerly, and Harry brought up the rear.
Harry grinned, “Yeah. I reckon we make quite a formidable team.”
Harry grinned and gave Dean a little shove, “I’m telling my hairdresser you said that.”
Theodore started giggling about Draco saying ‘dick,’ “It’s okay. You should hear the kids at school.”
“That being said, I’d really like to kiss you. Right now. Would you like that, too, Harry?”
Ginny laughed, “Except three seconds ago, you thought it was from me because I liked you.”
Malfoy hefted the squirming sack, “You asked for a decontamination under some very specific conditions, and my superiors sent me to execute it. It’s my job to be here.”
“In my bag,” Draco said, looking amused. “There’s a nightshirt. Just toss it to me, if you don’t mind.”
Shadowfax had emerged from her basket and sprung onto Draco’s shoulder, while he had his back to the bed to speak to Harry. She was a lithe little thing, the colour of a cobweb with huge, round yellow eyes that seemed to be unusually reflective, as they shone even in the slight dimness of the bedroom.
Hagrid rose as well, grumbling a little about the rain, but he followed Luna out.
“Where’ve you got to now?” the bird asked in a playfully plaintive tone that made him smile.
Harry Apparated into Hogsmeade’s semi official Apparition area, and walked the familiar road up to the school gates. The gates were chained shut, but Hagrid had taught him a charm to open them shortly after the war. Harry waved his wand at the gates, and the chains slackened and melted away and the gates swung open to allow Harry to pass through them. The castle loomed, mist swathed in the distance, and even ten years since the end of his time at Hogwarts, it felt strange that he wouldn’t be walking up the same path and sleeping in his room at the top of Gryffindor Tower with Ron on one side and Neville on the other.
“Brilliant summer, Granny!” Theodore said eagerly. “Draco showed us the YLHC--oh, that’s the Youth Lycanthropy Health Centre--and everyone there’s really nice. And Ara from my support group is going to be starting at Hogwarts with me! I hope we’re in the same house. It’ll be nice not being the only werewolf. She’s been on wolfsbane longer than I have. I just had my first doses two weeks ago. It’s called a pro-er. A pro something.” He looked at Harry, “What’s it called again?”
“I. Er. Yes? Tomorrow night? Yes. Yes, I would. I can do that. Yes.”
Theodore slumped against Harry and sobbed. Harry patted his back until his sobs subsided into hiccoughs, then conjured a stream of water into Theodore’s bedside water glass and offered it to him. Theodore drained the glass in two gulps and repeated the performance when Harry refilled his glass.
“Your aunt Hermione would be so proud,” Harry interjected fondly.
“I’m sorry,” Draco murmured when they left the museum hand in hand. “I didn’t know he’d be here, or I’d have warned you. I know that must have been. Complicated.”
“I know,” Harry stooped to pet Fang. “I’m putting down roots into my desk chair, I think. All I ever do is write these days.”
“With the hound patronus!”
“You shouldn’t’ve typed them up on this haunted typewriter. Going to have to destroy that as well. Dear me Potter, you really must be more careful in future.”
“I shouldn’t do anything dangerous in front of him, of course,” murmured Malfoy in an undertone, his cool, grey eyes on Harry’s.
“Exactly.”
“It happens everywhere, since I’m a wizard.”
“What is it?” Harry asked quickly.
“I’m good at Potions,” Harry reminded him.
Malfoy shrugged, “Not since he was a baby. We saw them for a bit shortly after the war, til Aunt Andromeda and my mum fell out again. She used to mention you, actually.”
The revelation fell rather flat. Dudley was not familiar enough with wizarding culture to understand the significance. And to Harry’s profound annoyance, Ron and Hermione exchanged oh-dear-well-we-knew-it-was-coming looks.
Luna rose from her chair, “Hagrid, let’s go and feed the chickens so that Harry and Ginny can talk in private. If Harry blushes any harder, I’m sure he’ll faint.”
“I suppose it’s not very romantic, is it?”
“I mean,” Harry shut his eyes briefly, his middle feeling squirmier and squirmier. “More than that. Not that he likes me more than you! I mean er. We like each other like. Like. Uncle Ron and Aunt Hermione. Or like er. Aunt Ginny and Aunt Luna. Luna. Sorry.”
For a moment, Harry thought he might be swept away in a nauseating wave of righteous fury and revulsion. It was like he was seventeen again, heady with the urge to hex someone into oblivion, to put things right. “It was Greyback, wasn’t it?” Harry’s voice came out as a growl.
“This tapestry is a chameleon ghoul, though,” Malfoy tapped his Dark Detector against the tapestry.
“Well, as I say I’m not going to beg you,” Malfoy said. He turned away and began to pack his Dark Detector into his satchel, “Perhaps you’re right, and there’s too much between us to work together effectively.”
“Of course it isn’t real.” Harry paused, not sure how much of an explanation he should provide, “Brains are very good at working out patterns because it helps you stay alive. You know that sort of berry makes you puke if you eat it. That sort of animal will take a bite off you if you try for a cuddle. Dirty water will have you up with your tummy all night if you drink it. The thing is, well before you were born, a load of scary things happened to me, and my brain got used to it.
“I’m not sure. Sometimes, I suppose.”
“Not always. It can be.”
Ron looked mortified, “It’s not like that at all!”
“Yes?”
“So methodical for a Gryffindor,” Draco waved his wand and changed the entire wall behind the kitchen table into a chalkboard.
Draco laughed, “Good lord. This is you at fifty percent is it? What a sobering thought.” He sipped from his hot chocolate, “How did it go? What did he say?”
Hermione considered, “He’s quieter now. Not so desperate for attention. Sort of reserved in fact. And he’s more polite. Most of the time. And he’s really passionate about his cause. That’s when he gets a bit rude. He can be a bit. Pushy.”
