She nodded, and once again, they fell into silence. He could barely breathe. Thoughts swirled in his head, demanding attention. It was time.
“Yes. You will only write to me if you believe she is hiding anything from the ministry.” Lucius looked at him with a calculating eye and then dismissed him by looking back down at his work. “That is all.”
“Draco...perhaps we should go get some robes fitted- like we used to...” His Mother looked around, sharing the same look of sorrow that Draco had in his eyes. He nodded- they both needed something to remind them of when times were better.
On the way back to the hall, Draco took a different route. A meandering route that allowed him to think- He knew his past was about to catch up with him, he could not escape his actions during the war. He would be prosecuted. His Mother would be prosecuted... But he could put all that off for a little longer. He made his way to a small courtyard near the Transfiguration classroom. It had been heavily impacted by the battle; several of the doorways were collapsed in on themselves and fires had burnt most of the plants and grass.
Draco waited for his friends to finish packing up and they left to go to the library for their usual Monday afternoon study session- which usually ended up being gossip sessions.
“When then?” Harry didn’t take the hint, “You were... different- when we were in the Manor- and in the room of requirement…” he saw Draco’s confused look. “You called it the room of hidden things, but it’s slightly more complic…” He trailed off, “Anyway- when did you change your mind? When did you become good?”
” Someone was shaking his shoulder. It as Pansy. “Are you okay?” Some  distant part of him registered the deep concern on her face and slammed against it’s walls trying to reach out. Draco frowned and shoved back against it.
Draco sighed, knowing he had not been eating as much as he needed. He rarely looked in the mirror, but when he had seen himself this morning he realised he looked far too skinny.  “Yeah, um, I’ll have some porridge”
As a growl rose in Draco’s throat, several things all happened at once. Draco felt his anger well up inside him- fuelled by something dark and deep inside him, it leapt at the chance to finally do something violent and so he too leapt at Crabbe, grabbing at his shirt, his hand curving into a fist, readying for a punch. However, before he could go through with it, his body instinctively dodged when he caught some movement out of the corner of his eye. Granger had shot a stunner at them. She would have gotten Crabbe, but Draco had pulled him along with him when he dodged. Habit had made him save his old friend. The presence in him throbbed in displeasure.
Draco hit it with all the force he could muster. It felt good. And his hand, which had now healed, only hurt the smallest amount. It was enough.
Yet, whilst it would have increased his survival chances greatly if he discarded the incredibly heavy form of Goyle to run more freely, Draco could not abandon his friend to death. He lost sight of the others and whimpered as the flames appeared in front of him.
He was allowed out of his room and into other parts of the house of course, but since his family’s very public failure to the Dark Lord, he wasn’t exactly treated with respect by the other death eaters. It appeared his mother still cared about him, but she still wasn’t the same since he had repeatedly had Luna in his room.
“Hmm,” Neville scratched his chin thoughtfully. “That’s a tricky one, there could be a variety of reasons. Are you mixing Hokkaido Honey in with the water when you spritz it?”
“Why are you getting so many deliveries recently?” she huffed shooing away the most recent snowy feathered visitor. “It’s like a bloody owlery in here, one even scratched my arm the other day flying past.”
“This was a trick,” Draco gasped, wheeling wildly around the table, they were all staring at him now. “Bloody hell you
Magalie smiled at Harry, her eyes bright and knowing, “Yes Harry,” she replied, “I think I understand now.”
“Oh well that in case,” Draco smirked, “my co-workers make Morlocks look like a civilised species and my boss is one impotent bluster away from turning into a puffer fish.”
“So,” Harry cleared his throat, still very aware that Malfoy couldn’t hear a word he was saying, “Do you reckon that red headed witch will keep the baby even though it might be cursed?”
“Right,” Picklemarsh’s face turned cold, “and how many different departments exactly did you send your C.V. to?”
The previous week he had summoned Magalie a little too early and when the end of episode had resulted in a cliffhanger Malfoy had turned excitedly on the sofa to register nothing but empty space. Harry had felt his chest constrict uncomfortably as Malfoy’s face had changed, his smile melting into the tight, reserved expression that he wore for most of his day at the Ministry.
Harry smiled and nestled back in the armchair, he had developed somewhat of a crick in his neck from the long hours bent over the department’s pensieve.
“Finally, a suspicious package,” Ron announced cheerfully as Malfoy rooted through his briefcase and extracted a Tupperware clearly containing a sandwich. Harry gently snorted a laugh before leaning back to look round the rest of the offices.
“Don’t tell me!” Harry gasped, his eyes widening. “I’ve been with Ron all day and the cheeky bugger didn’t even mention it!”
moment in a cauldron shop. How would Malfoy feel when he knew that Harry had been witness to an entire month of what should have been private moments.
“You’re all dead to me,” Harry griped, reaching forwards to grab a bottle of Ogden’s from the garden table.
“Apparently the actor had a bit of a pay dispute with the show runners,” Draco grinned, he loved a bit of gossip and yet Marlene at the office had always seemed distinctly uninterested in the nuances of wizarding soap operas. “Unless they sort it out by season’s end, they’re writing him off.”
“But I’m not down?” Harry screwed up his face. “Are you telling me I’ve been a miserable git for months and no one’s thougt to say anything? Have I been bringing the mood down at pub nights or something?”
“Maybe you could invite him to Ginny’s wedding?” she suggested eagerly. “He always looked so happy in formal wear.”
Harry observed Philippe carefully, it was the man’s first appearance in Malfoy’s provided memories. Philippe appeared to be a fair bit older than them, in his late forties or early fifties. He was handsome with salt and pepper hair and a trimmed beard. Since cracking open the yellow marble, Malfoy had spent most of his time with Philippe complaining about the inefficient bureaucratic systems of the Ministry.
“Sensible woman your wife,” Harry grinned as Ron rolled his eyes. “Look, how about you take a break and I’ll go back in on my own.”
“The same couldn’t be said for all the aurors,” Odette pointed out, “surely you must be a little relieved that it was him?”
“Oi – if you two aren’t going to pull your quiz weight I’m cutting you out of the prize money,” the other man chortled as Harry rolled his eyes.
“He said he liked my hair on Monday,” Draco muttered, standing in front of the bedroom mirror. “How did I have it on Monday?”
Draco snorted as the owl settled on his desk, preening its feathers and tapping its talon impatiently. Draco recognised the stamp on the scroll it was carrying as belonging to Gringott’s and quickly untied the parchment from around the bird’s ankle.
Harry blinked as Malfoy’s face erupted into a wide, happy smile. Harry hadn’t even known that the other man could make that expression. The woman was in her thirties, she was beautiful and had a lilting French accent as she drew Malfoy into an embrace and kissed both his cheeks.
Ron blinked before snorting wildly, “Jesus, I don’t know mate. I mean, if I remember correctly what George told me, you can’t actually touch them or anything. He was trying to develop a line to be companions for the elderly or people with magical dementia in Mungos who don’t get visitors, I think…” Ron trailed off, looking around the kitchen before letting out a triumphant noise and gesturing to a slip of paper on one of the work surfaces. The label was written in calligraphic script and entitled “
He had heard through the grapevine that Blaise had gotten married and maybe moved to Canada, whilst he had no idea what had happened to Pansy Parkinson or Gregory Goyle. He wasn’t even sure if Malfoy had honestly even been that close to any of them.
“Not only are the Deutsches Zaubereiministerium saying the reports were incorrectly filled out but they’re also now claiming they were two days late!” Picklemarsh roared, flecks of spittle spraying his desk where he had at least three different motivational calendars.
“Promise me you won’t take any work with you,” Harry squinted at Draco as they exited the clothing shop. “I don’t care what Bill says, I want you all to myself.”
“It baffles me how anyone thinks you’re charming,” Draco rolled his eyes, paddling backwards from Harry and enjoying the sun on his face.
to being in Malfoy’s memories, watching the other man work or prep his lunch, listening to him crack jokes with Magalie or snort at the latest quidditch results, often at the expense of the Canons, which Harry secretly agreed with. It was just, familiar now perhaps, almost as if they were friends inhabiting the same space. Which was probably a stupid thing to think and perhaps Harry
“Curses?” Harry asked excitedly before calling out across the table. “Hey Bill, what do you know about occamy eggs?”
“You look like you have a bubble beard,” Harry smirked as he leaned against the sink. Obviously, seeing as Malfoy was in the bath, he should probably fast forward, but the other man was happily talking to himself about quidditch again and some of insights were just too good to miss. Harry had been fast forwarding so much over the last few days when suddenly he had been struck by the irrational fear that once he reached the end of the memories he would never get to see Malfoy like this again, so relaxed and intimate.
“You might like him now,” Harry continued, acutely aware he was just digging himself deeper. “Honestly, Ron, he’s not so bad. He reads science fiction books and plays chess, you know I finally learned how to execute the Jacobean Jolly? That move where you put your rook –“
He tried his best to reassemble his expression into a more palatable one as Ron came striding over with auror Penny Solomon in tow. A fair number of guests had gathered in the garden, there must have been about thirty people, most of whom Harry recognized. Plus, there was a small rampaging hoard of children scurrying about, waving dripping ice popsicles with sticky fingers.
“There have to be rules right?” Draco murmured. “They have to fast forward through anything explicit?”
“You can still get to know someone well enough through their memories,” Harry protested. I’m not saying we’re suddenly bosom buddies on anything like that, I just think that when this investigation is over it might be nice if we, well, if we all gave him a chance or something.”
“And I do feel guilty when I see you,” Harry continued. Draco bristled, ready to just call it a night and leave before his dignity could be bruised further.  “But only because I hurt you,” Harry added. “I feel like I betrayed you.”
Harry scrunched up the scrap paper on his desk and threw it over at the waste bin where several similar balled up messes lay on the carpet.
“What?” Harry wheeled wide-eyed on Draco. “Fuck, Draco, don’t do that – I swear I’ll stop harassing you, you’ll never have to hear from me again if you don’t want.”
Harry saw the moment Malfoy’s shoulders slumped in tired resignation. “I can assure you,” Malfoy sighed, “I have no romantic interest in Marlene, nor am I stalking you. In fact, I believe this is only the third time we have run into each other outside of work this year –“
“You’d have to be lonely to order charmed imaginary friends,” Ron’s eyes widened, “I mean, it’s a bit creepy isn’t it?”
“Nothing like a mother’s love to get past the fact your spawn has bat wings and a predilection for human blood,” Harry added jovially as Malfoy reached for another carrot.
“Having fun?” Harry grinned. Bill had nipped off to the toilet and Potter had slid into his vacated seat so that he was now stationed next to Draco.
It was a Saturday morning and no one had classes on Saturday so both boys got to sleep in. This was good because they were both tired from the events of the previous night. They ended up sleeping in until about eleven o'clock. Draco was the first to wake though he didn't want to move so he just lay there waiting for Harry to wake. When Harry did wake up a few minutes later he looked at Draco and smiled, then said, “Hey how are you feeling?”
“Um, well,” Harry paused to rub the back of his neck with his hand, “I guess so, I just didn't really think that I should break it, like I said before you don't deserve that.” he shyly smiled at Draco,”And, well yeah I do like you, as a friend,” he hurried to add,”so yeah I made sure that your wand was safe.”
Harry nodded and said the lubrication charm again and stroked along his cock a few times to cover it fully before aligning himself at Draco's entrance. “OK, you ready love? I'll go slow, yeah.” Harry said as he started to push in. Draco moaned at the burning sensation as Harry’s tip penetrated him. “You OK?” Harry asked.
Harry heard the train before he saw it. He recognised the familiar squeak of the wheels against the tracks and knew that he was finally returning home.
“OK fine you stay here and I'll go get some food and bring it back up.” Harry was starting to get really hungry.
“Why is your face doing that?” Draco asked, motioning to Potter’s face, a disgusted look on his own.
Draco grabbed his wand off the floor quickly asked permission to go to the bathroom and ran out of the classroom, leaving Harry standing there shocked and helpless (and horny).
Harry and Draco were in Draco’s dorm room, Draco was studying and Harry was smiling at Draco again. It was making Draco want to say something mean or hurtful to him just to stop him from smiling, they were studying for Merlin's sake. “What could you possibly be smiling about?” Draco asked when he couldn’t put up with Harry’s incessant smiling anymore.
The kiss ended and Harry pulled back to look at Draco. Harry knew he shouldn't have said that to Draco. He'd known that Draco's feelings for him weren't as strong. He'd known that and still he had to tell Draco that he loved him. Draco looked like he was having an internal debate of whether to lie and say he loves Harry too or to tell the truth and say he doesn't love Harry. But Harry has been in love with Draco for a long time now and Draco has only just realized his feelings for Harry, so Harry decided to say, “Draco, it's OK if you don't love me back. I just needed to tell you.” Harry smiled sadly.
“Really, I'm pouring my heart out here and you're just gonna say that I'm ‘not too bad’?” Harry asked.
Harry took that as encouragement and positioned himself a bit lower than before, started licking and sucking at Draco's balls and moving down, down until he stopped right before he got to Draco's entrance. Harry sat up, tapped Draco's bare legs and said “Roll over.” Draco slowly complied, “Don't you want my tongue in your arse?”
After a bit more back and forth with Draco calling Harry different things and Harry threatening to kill Draco if he ever called Harry that again, they saw that it had got red quite late and Harry went back to his room. Harry got into his pyjamas, brushed his teeth, had a quick wank then went to sleep. It was the first good night's sleep he'd had in a long time.
“Oh, well if you want to go with your other friends then you can, you don't have to wait for me.” Draco said sounding disappointed.
“I do not! Take that back.” Draco said indignantly, simultaneously wanting to lean in to Harry and pull away.
Harry said a wand less lubrication charm and inserted the tip of his finger moving his left hand to rest on the bed beside Draco, supporting his weight. “I learned that one just so I could use it on you.” Harry smirked, “Well I hoped I’d get to use it on you.” Harry added. Draco just moaned at the intrusion.
“Nah, it's fine, it actually gave me a chance to practice wand less magic.” Draco boasted,” You know I'm actually pretty good now.”
The two boys say at the slytherin table with Draco's friends, Pansy Parkinson and Blase Zabini. They knew of Draco and Harry's new friendship so they weren't really surprised when Harry sat with them. Conversation came fairly easily, after a few quick apologies about past grievances they were able to get along quite well. They disagreed on a few things and quarreled over them but mostly they were civil. They avoided talking about the war and manly talked about Quidditch and homework, but it was nice for Harry to have someone else to talk to about these things. Having only Ron, Hermione and a few select others in his small group of friends it was good to talk with someone outside his immediate group. Though it was still the same generic answers, ‘we have too much homework’, ‘we should only have to go to class for two days rather than five’, ‘the teams for Quidditch are really good this year’ etcetera, etcetera.
Draco looked down at their laced hands, his milky pale fingers alternating with Harry’s tanned ones. “Yeah I can tell.” he looked up at Harry, their eyes met in a mutual desire, they leaned in but before their lips could touch Draco dropped his head and asked, “Are we going too fast? Should we slow down and talk about it?”
“Wait! Please.” Potter turned to face Draco. “I’m sorry, I should have told you, I was going to, I just wanted you to trust me first. I didn’t even mean to, I was going to sneak out once you were asleep and never go back, I was going to leave I promise, it was an accident. You were just so warm and it was the first time I’d changed, I was exhausted. I wasn’t going to come back either, but I haven’t slept properly in so long, but when I was with you, I finally felt safe enough to sleep.” Draco didn’t realise he was crying until he looked up and saw Potter through a blur of tears. “I’m sorry.” Draco sobbed. He hated crying in front of people but he didn’t care that Potter could see him crying. In fact he was glad Potter was there, like just his presence was comforting.
Draco did not expect this. He thought that Potter would have broken his wand, set it on fire, blow it up, anything. Anything but to keep it in perfect condition. But Draco couldn't stop to think about this now and so he pocketed the wand and continued on his way to the entrance of Hogwarts for his last year there.
“Draco listen to me OK,” Harry waited until Draco was looking at him then went on, “I don't care that you did a few questionable things during the war, hell I killed a few people, I almost killed you-”
“Yeah sure.” she didn’t look up from the article she was reading. Harry leaned over to Draco and kissed his cheek. Draco turned toward Harry and caught his lips in a chaste kiss. “You guys are adorable but could you refrain from being adorable at breakfast, people are staring.” Hermione went back to reading, shaking her head.
Harry just shook his head and laughed again. Soon both boys were laughing. “Hey, why did you get so freaked out when I asked you why it mattered?”
Draco opened his eyes, light was streaming in through a gap in the closed curtains, he felt warm arms wrapped around him. What? Draco had not gone to sleep in someone else’s bed, had he? He looked at the curtains again, RED, they were RED! No, he’d fallen asleep with Potter in the Gryffindor tower. Luckily Potter had had the foresight to close the curtains around the bed so no one else had seen him. The only problem was that he’d changed in the middle of the night, he was no longer a ferret. What if Potter had seen him, well he probably would have kicked him out, right? That didn’t matter right now. What did matter was Draco’s escape plan, he’d turn back into a ferret, check that everyone else was sleeping, turn back so he could open and close the door and turn back into a ferret to get back to his dorm. Simple plan, nothing that could go wrong.
“Fuck off. You're such a dick head, I did something nice for you and you just had to make fun of me.” Draco said dismissively.
“Yeah, I've got a few old T-shirts that you can wear.” then Harry stood up and moved to his cupboard to pull out two wrinkled T-shirts, one for himself and one for Draco. Both boys got changed into the T-shirts and just kept their boxers on. “Hmm, you look good in my clothes.” Harry mused when he saw Draco.
“Oh yeah? Well that makes me feel a bit better at least.” Harry looked partly relieved and partly impressed, “Can you show me some of the spells you were working on?”
“Well, you know who asked me to do something for him, so that's where I was.” he lied, he couldn’t tell her the truth. “I will also have to continue to do as he’s asked tonight so I’m going to put my books away now and do that.” Draco looked at Pansy daring her to stop him. “So, if you don’t mind I’m going to go now.” Draco finished.
2. Ron had started dragging Harry by his right sleeve while Hermione one scolded him for standing around.
Draco made his way up to his room where he was met with a mostly empty space; only a few people were left in the dorm by the time Draco finally made it back. This was good, Draco would be able to get ready in peace. He discarded yesterday’s clothes, threw on his uniform, brushed his teeth and hair, magically of course gave himself a once over in the bathroom mirror. He looked halfway decent, not as good or put together as usual but good enough to pass.
“Hey little guy, where did you come from?” he’s utterly insufferable, but his hands are so nice and warm. Draco realises just how tired he is, the books did say that he may experience symptoms such as tiredness after the first change, but he didn’t think he’d be this tired. Despite it being Potter he decides, fuck it, I’m tired and I’m going to sleep, Potter even lets him. “Aw, are you tired?”
“No, no stop! I take it back, I take it back. Get back in your chair you wanker.” Draco waved his hands around in an attempt to ward off Harry.
“I'm sure that you would have found some other way.” Draco didn't want praise for his actions during the war, everything he did was selfish even helping Harry was selfish.
When Draco got back to his room he closed the door too loudly and someone called out “DO YOU MIND!” To which Draco ignored and instead just kept muttering “fuck, fuck, fuckety fuck-fuck.” ‘what did I just fucking do?’ He thought ‘Harry was right, I got my wand back so why should it matter? But it does matter. It matters because he took care of it, he made sure that nothing bad happened to it. That matters.’ Draco thought about this more and more until finally he thought ‘Wow, this really is driving me insane.’ and went to sleep, well, he tried to anyway.
“It’s just that I can fall asleep better, if I, well when I- in my animagus form.” Draco stuttered out.
Draco had only ever heard those words from his mother and occasionally his friends, though having Harry tell Draco that he loves him, well, Draco had never thought that the day would come. But there it was. Harry had said those words. Harry loves Draco. Does Draco love Harry? No. Maybe? No, he likes Harry sure. OK he really likes Harry. Like really really likes Harry. But does Draco love Harry. Well he definitely loved hearing Harry say that he loves Draco.
When he arrived at his destination he quickly chose a shower closed the curtain, used every locking charm he knew on it, hung up his towel and clothes, undressed himself and finally turned on the water, cold at first to stifle his erection then hot to soothe his body (and mind). After about 20 minutes Draco turned off the water, towelled himself dry, put his clothes on, grabbed his pyjamas and towel, opened the curtain and saw Potter standing at one of the sinks. He wasn't even washing his hands or looking in the mirror, he was leaning against it and looking at Draco, he even had a smirk on his face! That fucking prick was fucking smiling! He was fucking amused.
It had been a week since Draco had started his eighth year at Hogwarts, he'd been to all of his classes by now. It was annoying because there were some seventh years in his classes too. It was mostly uneventful though, which was good for Draco except for the fact that that gave him the perfect opportunity to sit at the edge of his bed in his own dorm room (the eighth years were given their own rooms this year) and ponder the question he's been trying to answer for the past week; ‘why did Potter take such good care of his wand?’
Draco did want to sleep, he was absolutely exhausted, though he wasn’t sure if Harry would be ok with it. “Well,” Draco cleared his throat, “yes but will you stay?” Draco looked into Harry’s eyes.
Draco turned back into a ferret, still snuggling into Potter though. He went back to sleep in Potter’s arms, one of the better sleeps he’s had in so long that he can’t remember his last good sleep.
Potter didn’t take long, he was out seconds after Draco. They looked at each other, Potter questioning and suspicious, Draco open and sincere. Potter sighed and said, “I knew it.”
Harry whose eyes were now open, lifted Draco’s chin to gaze into Draco’s eyes, “Do you want to slow down?” he asked softly, “because if we are going too fast I’m happy to slow down.” he moved his hand to Draco’s cheek and Draco leaned into the touch, “we can talk about it, we should.”
Draco felt himself getting closer, too close, so he said, “Harry, please I need you inside me now.” Harry just nodded and moved off of Draco, motioning with his hands to indicate that he wanted Draco to spread his legs. Once he had his legs sufficiently parted, Harry whispered the lubrication charm and brought his fingers to Draco’s entrance. The anticipation of what Draco knew was coming next was almost unbearable, though when Harry’s first finger slowly entered Draco it was the most pleasure he’d felt since, well since the last time Harry’s finger was in his arse, but it felt extremely good. Before long Harry was inserting a second finger, there was a slight burn at first but after a few thrusts it was just pleasure. Harry had started to scissor his fingers, stretching Draco. When Harry had added a third finger and was scissoring him open even wider, Draco - who was almost lost in the pleasure - said, “More, please I need your cock.”. He didn’t even care that he was begging and that he’d probably look back on this in the morning and feel embarrassed, but that was future Draco’s problem, right now he didn’t care; he just wanted to feel Harry inside of him. Harry, upon hearing this, swiftly removed his fingers - lingering to admire the way Draco looked beneath him - and whispered the lubrication spell again, rubbing it along his throbbing cock. Harry moved forward slightly, then after positioning his cock at Draco’s entrance looked up to see Draco looking back at him with mostly desire and lust in his eyes, but also love. Draco nodded at Harry and he suddenly felt full, Harry had entered him almost all the way to the hilt, but stopped just before. Draco was ready for the intrusion though, having done this with Harry a few times now he was almost accustomed to the feeling of Harry’s cock filling up his arse. As this was the case Draco nodded again and Harry pushed the rest of the way in. They quickly got into a rhythm, Harry thrusting in and out, Draco grinding his hips up to meet Harry’s as he thrusted into Draco at a loving but fast pace. Draco felt every thrust of Harry’s hips meet him in the most delicious ways, with Harry hitting Draco’s prostate almost every thrust. Harry started tugging Draco’s cock as he continued to thrust into him.
“I'm not the only one who went through something traumatic. Look at you, you killed the dark lord and you're fine.” Draco said into Harry's shoulder.
When both boys had caught their breath Harry moved back up the bed to kiss Draco. Draco moaned at the taste of himself in Harry’s mouth. Harry's hands roamed around Draco's stomach, reaching down and back to Draco's prick feeling it get hard again, Draco hissed from the sensitivity of his cock. “Is this going too fast?” Harry asked as he started stroking Draco's dick again.
“I was looking for you, I still don’t quite trust you. I had to make sure you weren’t up to something.” Potter said as he walked towards Draco warily.
Harry started to move his tongue quicker, fucking Draco as deep as he could, trying to find that sweet spot that made Draco shudder with pleasure. Coaxing moans, pleas, whimpers and muttered cusses from Draco as he fucked him with his tongue, hitting that spot as often as he could. Eventually when even Harry couldn't take the teasing any more he got up onto his knees behind Draco and, having already stretched Draco with his tongue, Harry positioned his cock at Draco's entrance, whispered a quick lubrication spell and finally pushed in. Both boys moaned in relief as Harry sank all the way into Draco. The warmth of Draco one thousand times more intense now, surrounding Harry's cock, buried deep in Draco. After a few seconds of not moving Draco nodded and pushed back slightly, trying to get more. Harry got the idea and started to pull back out.
Unbidden, Hadrian felt a deep longing for the massive mint green sweater in his real trunk. It was XXL, with cotton that was beginning to pill, and a cute pig face stitched into the corner. He’d had it for as long as he could remember knowing Laney. She’d give it to him the first day she’d found him shivering on a curbside, trying to keep him warm. Annabee also loved the sweatshirt, always crawling into the folds whether he was in the shirt or not. His little clingy honeybee and his chaotic twin. Suni usually dozed in the front hanging pocket, as much as she could anymore now that she wasn’t a one foot baby anymore.
Immediately there was pandemonium in the courtroom. A Lord to an Ancient and Noble House doing such a thing was a scandal. Extremely. Hadrian leaned back and watched with apathetic eyes as the judge furiously berated the Potters and signed every document allowing his mothers custody and even a restraining order while giving James and Albus the evil eye. Annabee squealed happily and threw herself at Hadrian. Making a couple Lords smile indulgently as the eldest Dragma held and rocked her softly. Draco snickered quietly.
Laney withdrew her hands revealing a tiny calico kitten blinking cutely around the room. Hadrian frowned at his familiar as Suni gave the tiny creature a speculative eye. Draco snapped back to himself. He was eleven, he would not be jumping the bones of a boy he just met.
“Hadrian was really looking forward to Defense, but the teacher is a little dull.  I love potions! I’m not great at them though, it’s basically the same as chemistry! I was horrible at it, but it was still my favorite. Snape’s tutoring Greg, Victor, and I, but I think I just don’t have
Hadrian woke to a banging at the door, growling, Hadrian crawled out from under the bed. Glaring at the door angrily.
“Hadrian’s making a pot of coffee now, this conversation first. I need help.” Severus was wide awake. “It’s not big. Well, I think it is, but Hadrian has memory problems. Like he doesn’t remember months of his life, and something about it gives me a bad feeling and he won’t listen to me. So, I was wondering if…”
“I’m sure he didn’t mean that. I’m Lily, Alex said that your name is Laney correct?” The curly red head just glared at the older woman quietly, obviously still peeved and unwilling to engage. She shifted her attention to her ex-son before a kind smile blossomed on her face.
A medium, he’d need one for the ritual circle. The only material thing he would need as long as he memorized the words he would need efficiently enough. The wards would scream if Hadrian tried to smuggle the book into his room for guidance, so memorizing was the only option. He should only need chalk or paint, something that would last and not get brushed away by a draft or swirl of magic. Not that his loving ‘father’ would ever give him access to anything like that. After that last visit he’d left Hadrian bloodied up and taken everything useful or studious for him to do, or for him to use against them.
“Lily. Go.” The redhead shot concerned and longing glances between her husband and her ex-son before she hurried Alex away and escaped down the hall. Leaving Hadrian to face
“I’m looking into that now.” Mother was ice cold fury as she spoke in low tones with Lucius, hands twitching as if looking for her magnum. Lucius was rifling through different law books and sending owl after owl out to various connections at the Ministry and other powerful Lords.
“Ah, Miss Dragma. This is Mr. and Mrs. Potter, and I’m sure you’ve met Alex.” Laney flicked her hair over her shoulder when Alex reached out a hand to shake.
“I’ve been fine mostly. Seeing the Potters is… distressing at times. And Alexander keeps harassing Laney and I, it is bringing back some unpleasant memories. I’ve been taking it a day at a time however, and I have Suni and Laney with me. I’ll send a letter to mother if anything gets worse or to a degree I can no longer handle.” Laney scowled.
“She can be a loud terror when she wants professor, we know. No need to sugar coat it, there’s a reason Hadrian’s the voice of reason.” Snape needed to stop being blindsided by how much
Alex sat down on the stool with a small glance at the side. Hadrian’s friends had all been thrown to the snakes! It was perfect, when he was in his rightful house with Alex he’d see how he was supposed to act. Right now, standing there on his own, he already looked so much better, his posture was still straight, but his hands tucked into his pockets. Shoulders back with easy and powerful grace. He wasn’t more powerful than Alex, but having some intimidation to back him up was always good. That’s why Draco ran with Crabbe and Goyle after all. He almost reminded Alex of Uncle Sirius.
Or was that just when you thought I was a muggle-born gypsy oh great one.” Alex winced and wilted under her harsh sneer and Lily pulled him closer to her before giving a small smile.
Lucius has also shown him ritual magic and allowed him to hone the craft himself, impressed with his skill in performing the difficult magic he had to escape his prison. Hadrian could honestly save he’d never been happier or more fascinated practicing a branch of magic, each successful ritual was an elation, an adrenaline high.
All he had was a snapped wand with no core, and more bruises than he knew what to do with. Luckily, Hadrian had a good memory or his late night sneaking into the library would be for nothing. Drawing a ritual circle was easier if you had a picture, but he would make do, they either worked or they didn’t. Even so, disowning yourself from an old family bloodline was complex and complicated work-
“Never call my sssister that ever again. Unlesss you’d like me to wring your neck until you are a lifelessss puddle on the floor.” Alexander paled until he was paper white and Hadrian released him, letting the lion slide to the floor as he returned to his friend’s sides. His arm shooting out to grab Laney as she giggled and swooned dramatically.
Draco soon shambled down the stairs. His parents following quickly behind him. The blonde looked relieved to plop himself down next to his paramour, stealing sips from the younger man’s mug. Hadrian didn’t bother chiding him, smiling indulgently. Lucius gratefully poured him and his wife some coffee and sat down at the table. Hadrian peeked around.
“Show me.” Hadrian didn’t bother to fight it, ignoring the gasps and the small sharp sob from Draco as he pulled down his small morph. Nothing changed, except the smoothness of his skin. Now there were scars marring him horribly, not many that could be seen as most were on his back or his limbs. He still grimaced as Severus, one of his fathers, traced the thick and gnarled scar across his neck. Fingers deftly sweeping back up, the tiny scar the cut the upper left of his lip, the long line under his left eye. All three caused by the same beer bottle that Uncle Vernon had sent hurtling at his head. The long and faded scar on his forehead was much smoother, nearly healed and unseen beneath his hairline.
The long-haired brunet was smiling up at him with those sweet green eyes that would flash the most brilliant gold as he tumbled deeper into his thoughts. But, he didn’t grab for Draco’s full attention, he only relaxed under the blonde’s arm, smiling into the other’s chest and relaxing.
Turning half way around, the raven glowered at the sight of his biological brother smiling at him. Hadrian wand was still in front of him, a small flame licking at the tip. He wondered if he’d get in trouble for ‘accidently’ lighting the little prick on fire. Alex seemed expectant, waiting until his smile faded and he frowned.
“For you? His father? He should have been worth the world.” James glared and opened his mouth. But Sirius was tired of listening. “Avada Kedavra.”
“Doesn’t need help with that. I taught him well. Someone tried grabbing Annabelle at a park. Homophobe that didn’t like that Sara was married to me. Hadrian sprinted after him and broke his arm. That time
“We can only avoid him for so long, why is he being so persistent? Didn’t he get the hint before we got sorted?”
“I didn’t remember him Tom. I thought the few memories I had were dreams, the dragon plushie in my vault. I don’t remember being pregnant, I don’t remember naming him, watching him grow or crawling for the first time. And that paper…” Severus shuddered in his arms. “Tom, do you even know was the Carotid Artery is?”
“I’ve heard so much about you Lady Malfoy that I feel like I already know you. Please, all of you, come in and make yourselves comfortable. I’ll make some tea and we can chat while I finish dinner. I’m sure a warm meal and a safe roof is a priceless thing.” His green eyes sparkled when Hadrian leaned back towards him. Going on his tiptoes to give Draco a kiss and a pat on the chest.
Narcissa whistled low and smiled. “He’s as pussy whipped as you were when you and I started courting.” Lucius smiled weakly. Until his Lord also smiled, the look was distant and far away.
The morning rose softly, Hadrian’s eyes blinking as the glow pried his eyes open. Draco’s blond head was burrowed into his hair and his arms were squashing Hadrian’s face into his neck. The raven haired man laughed softly, kissing a hickey on Draco’s neck before rolling out of his grasp. Hissing a good morning to Nagini and wandering downstairs to start the coffee maker.
“No one has seen the Potters since Hadrian went missing, Madame Bones is already starting a search, but it will take some time. They haven’t been stripped of their most Noble title because the court case wasn’t even an hour ago.”
A small thud from upstairs caught their attention, and Hadrian got up. Moving into the kitchen, presumably to start breakfast. Draco following like a love-sick dog at his heels. Cissa smiled into her mug.
Draco had gotten on the train interested to find the boy who lived, but he found himself rather satisfied with what he’d found instead. His mother and father would hardly care either way as long as he made nice wizarding friends that had a shred of a decent head on their shoulders. Hadrian’s head leaned back slowly, craning to look at him. Those eyes pinned him down, and even though Draco knew he wasn’t another empath it felt like the other boy was baring out his soul. It was a slightly thrilling feeling.
Even Lucius seemed shocked, before a gleam of delight filled his eyes. The final nail in the coffin.
“Ah, the anxiety disorder? Not a problem, of course his sister may join.” Sara relaxed again and Severus hid a smile, still sitting beside Lucius. “I hope they won’t try to use it against you or him, however mental health studies are slightly archaic in the Wizarding World. So I hope Potter won’t be depraved enough to dig, if push comes to shove however would Hadrian be comfortable to simply be assessed by a Mind Healer? A muggleborn named Ted Tonks, he would serve as an expert testimony to help keep Hadrian out of Potter’s hands. Only if they pursue legal action that is.” Sara nodded.
She wanted her baby back. The one who had such a sweet smile and was so patient and good. Who kept her company while she read her charms work, or brewed potions, or even just cooked. Not the one who glared at her and regarded them with such fear and
“Hello there! I’m Laney Dragma, this is my brother Hadrian Dragma. You are…?” Her grin was sharp and challenging, Draco smothered a laugh at the affronted look on Potter’s face and motioned Crabbe and Goyle closer, making them loom over the three of them while Hadrian slowly sorted himself back together.
“I thought… I didn’t know what was going to happen and I only had precious few months with him in the summer. Things kept getting in the way after fourth year, but I promise I had a plan to tell you once we turned sixteen and I found out…” Draco trailed off thoughtfully, looking at Hadrian with pure awe and reverence when his love pet the dangerous snake with absolutely no fear. His mother eyed him curiously before his unspoken words hit her and she gasped.
Immediately, the door was opened and Potter was shoved inside. The rest wandered inside and listened to Snape’s lecture in a contemplative silence. Watching as he flayed Potter alive with a small hint of amusement. The only thing reaching Hadrian was a note passed from Draco on his left to Laney on his right.
The girl fell silent and glanced at Hadrian, Lucius’ breath caught in his throat. His eyes were nearly glowing, eyes a deep emerald green with a sickly glow that reminded Lucius way to much of his ex-Lord’s favorite curse. “The Potters can crawl into a hole and die for all I care. I don’t want to see any of them.
Severus left his godson to his thoughts, chuckling softly as he wandered into the kitchen. His mate was there already, practiced hands using the muggle coffee pot like it was as easy as breathing. His hair was down in slightly messy waves, a baggy tank top hanging off his shoulders. The man gave him a smile.
Severus’ letter had come as a surprise to him. Meeting with him through the floo had been a meeting with an equal amount of surprise. A meeting that had filled him with equal parts hope and outrage. Hearing that James had lost custody and proceeding then to simply take it, it had infuriated him. When he’d tried and failed to gain custody as James abandoned his beloved little godson Harry. Harry-Hadrian who was no longer just a child.
“What did you need me for? The rooms perfect!” Hadrian rolled his eyes and shoved Draco to sit on the end on the bed. Plopping down onto Draco’s lap so he couldn’t escape.
Screaming, Hadrian grabbed onto his core with both hands and felt when the accio snapped off of him and something else tore at him. It felt like his atoms were being tore apart and shoved through a small tube before they were forcefully packed back into his body. Weightless, for a moment. Then he crashed back to the ground.
The blonde paused, green eyes flashing in his mind. It was April, Hadrian wouldn’t be expecting it, but he also had the landline if he wasn’t at the café. He had a home, technically, it was Hadrian’s home. He’d always said that Draco was always welcome. The key in his pocket felt heavier than lead. His uncle saw his hesitation.
“The two are siblings, both are first years in my house.” James said nothing behind his family but Lily gave another tense smile.
Hadrian tightened his grip on his wand. Lily flinched again and tried to entice him closer with open arms.
held the boy tight. He looked at his own father and got a nod from him. Immediately Draco set off to fetch his mother and their lord.
His Lord and the other adults froze, staring at his son’s hand. Draco paused, giving his mate a quick glance up and down. Hadrian usually morphed the love bites away, so there were no marks. The blonde frowned a little bit in confusion when his uncle and his lord leveled him with twin venomous glares. Draco blinked again, the shimmer of red catching his eye.
Said mentor was relaxing on the patio next to the tree, enjoying a shady spot under the veranda with his wife. Sipping at what was either a fire whiskey or an iced tea. Narcissa sipping at a glass of water beside him.
He was wary of course, but he also didn’t think his effortless looking more like his fathers would be so bad. Hadrian relaxed his shoulders and let out a sigh, raising the vial in a small toast, though he didn’t know what to. Having a family again? Finding his birth heritage? Reclaiming what he’d lost?
The yellow and white boa snickered and slithered up her master’s chest. More firmly pushing herself into his jaw and affectionately scenting it. That was the second time his therapy had been brought to his mind. He doubted the headmaster would let him leave the school, however. He’d continue in the summer, and if it got worse he’d talk to Laney.
“He did the thing, didn’t he? I swear, he could say the most mundane things. But how he says them you think he was Dane Cook or something.” Another flat glare was fixed at her as Hadrian fell silent again. Though this time Draco didn’t feel that stab of coldness, so he assumed Harry was a bit more comfortable in his skin now and just choosing not to respond.
The train rumbled in the station holding, his head was lulled onto the window watching the crowds while his sister was happily spinning a quarter between her knuckles. He could tell she was more nervous than she let on as she held his hand with her free hand tightly. But he didn’t comment on it. This was going to be the longest they’d separated from their parents and baby sister since they’d become a family and Hadrian would be lying if the anxiety for his baby sister Annabee wasn’t a pit in his stomach. He was glad that Laney was at least here with him.
In all his years he’d always looked forward to the day he’d go to Hogwarts, and it was finally sinking in that he was
“I spent months ruining Alex, fully prepared to target James next. And he did it for me. I’m almost disappointed.” Laney grinned and Draco wrapped an arm around his waist with an conspiratorial grin.
“Now, I heard from your mothers’ that you were in therapy. Obviously, that is not offered here at Hogwarts. Can I inquire as to how you are doing?” Laney obviously looked at him, one of the few questions she couldn’t answer for him. Hadrian straightened his shoulders a bit.
Lily’s grasp tightened on her ladle. How was she supposed to have known that her sister abandoned her son? She never called or sent post anymore and Albus had said they were family and Harry was sure to be safe there. Not in danger from wizards there, in danger of being Alex’s twin brother.
“I know. I know. Lily was insistent to make him feel at home. That meant giving him free reign and hoping for the best. All he did was lock himself in his room and never come out until everyone was asleep. Surprised the little snake didn’t slit out throats in our sleep. He hurt Alex! And used his own blood for the disownment ritual.”
Creeping out of bed, his body protested the movement. Especially his leg. The joint screamed at him viciously, and a peek under the sweatpants he knows he never put on revealed the abused flesh. His knee joint was a swollen and angry red mottled with dark purple near black bruising. Hadrian grit his teeth, a foggy recollection of a boot stomping on his leg.
“What would be quicker? Waiting for a warrant as is or filing all the paperwork to destroy Potter legally and then gaining the warrant?”
Stuffing the letter in his robes. Severus escaped down to the dungeons, whistling to call his post raven down to his chambers he sat down at his desk and grabbed a quill and parchment as swiftly as he could.
“I never would, you may actually have to worry about him hurting me-ah!” Hadrian smacked Draco’s bicep with a pout that dissolved into a grin. “See! Abuse! I’m in danger Uncle Sev!”
Snape hid his slight surprise when the Potter spawn replied with a bland voice. “Many, and I believe Mama and Mother will beat you to it. Mother has been fed up with them since my adoption.” His godson hopped in the conversation. Snape eyed the way the blonde’s hands curled around the long-haired boy’s bicep. It wasn’t the worst Potter twin it seemed, but Snape was still displeased. Though, this wasn’t the conversation he’d been expecting, or where he was expecting to have it. Draco growled his input.
Perhaps tutoring wouldn’t remiss with those three… A small explosion sounded and the two laughed softly, grinning like children with an inside joke, or a secret. Snape snarling and yelling at Gryffindors while subtly trying to shape up his house’s side of the classroom.
“No, you shut the fuck up. The day you lay another hand on my son is the day I hand feed you your own internal organs!” The threat was a vicious hiss, her eyes glowed harshly as she slammed her hand on the desk. Severus mused. She was the magical influence then.
Annabee cheered with Laney and Draco raised his hand excitedly. Mama ruffled the blonde’s hair and smiled at Lucius as they all began migrating to the hall. “I’ll use the floo to give a quick call to Severus to come join us. You don’t think he’s busy do you?”
“Blackouts, I go to a boarding school, but I never remember going or coming home. It’s like I don’t exist for nine months, I fall asleep on August 31
If Dumbledore had adopted his child out to the Potters and twisted his mind almost beyond repair. Nearly killed him with muggle relatives and hardships at that blasted school, almost made Tom kill his own child. It wouldn’t surprise Tom if they learned Albus was the reason that he and his husband couldn’t remember their own son.
“The women called that Death Eater scum lawyer; he’ll be representing them against us in Harry’s custody case this winter. I doubt he’ll see sense like any light lawyer and settle this out of court. It’s going to be a public spectacle and we’ll be dragged through the Wizengamot. Rita is going to be a nightmare if she gets wind of this. We’ll have to be careful with Alex’s PR.”
“I’m afraid it’s unplottable. I can’t help you or the Auror’s Severus. Just trust I will do what is right for the Greater Good.”
“Professor, do you know why we’re being called into the office?” Laney’s pout was at full force while still being respectful to their Head of House. Hadrian glanced back at Snape himself, the man stayed blank but did answer them in a bland voice.
, god the words were so surreal and so, so lovely. His little prince. Looking at the paper with inquisitive eyes, it was a full inheritance, heritage, and medical parchment. Rather thick too. Lucius never liked to do anything by halves. He’d probably wanted to see Hadrian’s heritage and genetics that could be passed on. Money wasn’t important to the Malfoys, but heritage and genetics were to a point. If there was a dangerous mix then blood adoption would be encouraged rather than conception through potioned means. He was getting off track.
” Sara glared venomously at the red-haired woman who paled considerably. “To my knowledge, no one’s dared to threaten taking away any child from the Weasley’s yet, with the only difference being you undoubtedly making more money and only raising three children, adopting your children, and you being gay. I wonder what the media would make of this threat, I’m sure Rita would make quite the spectacle of an article about it.”
Hadrian was shaking back in the back, not as bad as he could of, he had trained restraint and silence in the whirl of hectic emotions. That didn’t mean that he was unaffected internally as his mind spun.
“Lady Potter and the Potter tweedledee and tweedledum trying to get their grubby hands on my brother and trying to wreck our family in the process is a little more than distressing. I want to punch her son in his smug little face half the time.”
Sara waved her off, “We didn’t know owls were like magic post. We got Laney a kitten for her birthday and a Hogwarts send off. But Hadrian got Suni his ball python for his… oh, was it his ninth birthday?” Erin played with her wife’s fingers idly.
Draco glanced up from his own letter and eyed the staff table with interest, frowning at something that Hadrian couldn’t see. The raven nudged him a bit as Laney collected their replies and waved down one of the post owls with a knut in her hand. Hadrian let his eyes ask his question and the blonde gave him a slightly bewildered smile.
Both of their heads whipped back when the floo flared. Severus rushed out and past them without a backwards glance toward them. “Albus was at the school, but he’s claiming that he never saw Hadrian after the court room. He locked himself in his rooms before Minerva or I could question him otherwise. I’ll be looking around once I get back there. Has anything new happened on this end yet?”
“The Potters threatened to sue for Hadrian’s custody yes.” The room got so quiet you could here a feather falling. The red haired girl fell silent, mouth slightly agape with wide and shocked eyes locked onto him. Hadrian’s eyes were just as wide, terrified as his body remained stiff as a board, knuckles white where they clutched at his sister.
Hadrian glanced down at his hand. Proof of his lover’s devotion, to his parents and their proud eyes on him. To him and how he now resembled them again.
Hadrian was happy, lazily doting on his honeybee. Draco beside him trying to wrestle Suni into submission as the snake threw herself on top of every piano music sheet the blond pulled out to read and study. Laney was having the time of her life terrorizing the peacocks and Annabee was being spoiled rotten not only by him, but the Lady of the house as well. (Their mothers were both working and spending ‘quality time together’ and he couldn’t hear it through the walls. A plus).
This is the man who took his godson. The man he couldn’t recognize anymore. This was his enemy. He mourned for his godson and each spell was his fury at everything he missed due to James keeping him away from him and then sending him away.
Ultimately, pretty useless against most wizards as there was apparation, sleep potions, stunning, and shields. But it filled Hadrian with no small amount of love for her. Letting her care for him. Mother had never been the warmest person alive, but he’d known she cared. It had actually been her that he was closest to. She soothed the past trauma, didn’t force him into talks about feelings or physical comfort, instead she was an anchor. Stable. Forcing him to get up and work on a schedule, taking him to the shooting range with her, teaching him how to be a better person for the people he loved.
“Wait here alright?” Hadrian nodded easily, Annabee waved from his arm’s happily and Laney gave them a grin. There was a large skip in her step as she practically danced to the bathroom, Hadrian chuckling and watching her antics as Lords and Ladies alike exited the hall leaving it mostly empty as he waited.
The gargoyle leaped out of his way as he swept up into the office. Portraits, ghosts, and Fawkes alike ignored the fact he was trespassing. Fawkes even helpfully taking the Headmasters visitor’s log and burning it to ashes to stop it from recording his entrance. Unfortunately from the look of the fireplace, all recent letters were burned as well. Severus growled.
“You’re doing a better job than I am,” Draco smiled at Harry and sat up, he spun around to face him and said, “I mean I practically worshiped you throughout my childhood, all I wanted was to be your friend. So long I imagined us meeting, Father always told me that people would respect our last name, I just assumed that you would want to be my friend because I’m a Malfoy. I imagined it for so long that it felt real, I was just a boy and you were my only friend, I’d tell you everything. I used to write you letters, I never sent them obviously, but I wanted to. I never had any proper friends so I had to invent one, and you were famous, the best of the best, you were the only one good enough for me. So when I got to finally meet the real thing and you rejected me, it was like my only friend, the one person I trusted most in the world, had just dumped me for someone I was always taught was less, unworthy of someone like Harry Potter, I hated you then. My best friend.” Draco looked at Harry’s astonished expression.
They’d been dulling, as everyone else in their Dada class had been, and somehow Harry had ended up stradling Draco’s hips. They were both tired out from the fight, panting and sweating. Harry leaning over Draco -- who had been disarmed by Harry -- with his wand aimed at Draco’s chin, if one of them just moved a few inches toward the other they would have been kissing. Harry had clearly won the fight but he wasn't moving off Draco, so Draco did the only logical thing, he bucked his hips to get Harry to move off of him. This however only served to show how both boys had erections.
“Uh,well,” Seamus scratched the back of his head, “I said you’d tell us at breakfast. Said you wouldn’t leave your room until morning.” Seamus looked down at his plate.
Both boys startled awake when Harry's alarm went off, signalling that they had to get up. Harry reached behind him to turn it off and snuggled back into Draco, taking a deep breath, then saying, “C’mon it's time to get up, love.”
This was not part of the plan, he was going to sneak into the Slytherin dorms and change back then come up with the best way to utilize his new skill. Now that plan has been intercepted by Potter and utterly ruined by his exhaustion. Well he’ll just have a quick nap and leave when Potter falls asleep.
Class ended and Harry got out before Draco did so he waited for him in the hall outside the classroom. When Draco finally came out he was looking down and walking fast so Harry had to grab Draco and say “Hey, Malfoy” to get his attention.
“Look I'll tell you later, there's too many people here and I don't want people talking about this.” Harry really didn't want to say.
“Well fine but I deserve you, and I deserve you at your best so I'm here to help you.” Harry was not going to let Draco go that easily.
He didn't notice Harry look over and smile at his display; shovelling mash potato into his mouth, followed by a spoon full of mushy peas, washed down with a gulp of whatever was closest. He only noticed Harry once he put his hand on draco's shoulder and said "Hey, you might want to slow down there, we don't want you choking on your food," he smiled, then followed that with a mumbled, "at least not any more."
That night, when the boys were changing out of their clothes and into T-shirts and boxers, Harry mentioned something that Draco had not realised; he had not been vomiting as much lately. Draco was surprised that something that significant could escape his notice. Though if it really was that significant he would have known. So does that mean that Draco's months of suffering were not as bad as he'd thought? Or perhaps it was more the fact that Draco's negative feelings that were making him vomit were replaced with positive feelings, feelings for Harry. Draco decided that it was most likely the latter, because when he snuggled into Harry's side, Harry's arm wrapped around him, he felt completely content and loved.
Draco was going to drive himself insane thinking about this. He just wanted the answer. Draco didn't even realise that he had gotten up and was walking over to Potter’s room until he had already knocked.
The two boys woke up about an hour later, just in time for dinner. So after kissing for a few minutes they got up and dressed, Draco whining the whole time about just staying and going for round two. Harry, however, was persistent --though a little tempted to give in to Draco -- and they made their way down to the Great Hall.
“Ha, it takes more than just food,” Harry twirled Draco around, “it also takes you being so damned hot and adorable and romantic and just overall amazing.” Harry said as they started to sit down.
During transfigurations Harry couldn't concentrate on anything that McGonagall was saying and instead could only replay the events of the morning again and again. He woke up, wanked, bumped into Draco, showered, talked to Draco, got yelled at by Draco and now he couldn't stop looking over at the blond. He just wanted to talk to him, be friendly, then Harry saw him with an erection and lost his shit. Harry decided to apologise to Draco, and finally after a week start his new relationship with Draco.
Harry removed the locking charms from the door and walked back to his dorm room with his arm around Draco's waist. When they got inside Harry closed the door and both boys went to sit on the still unmade bed. Draco cuddled into Harry's side. At first Harry thought that Draco just wanted to cuddle together but then Harry noticed that Draco had started to cry. “Hey, hey it’s OK. Why are you crying?” Harry asked.
After the trial -- the one where Potter saved his ass from Azkaban -- Draco could eat again, he had regained his appetite, but no matter what he did, he just couldn't keep it down.
Harry woke up in the middle of the night suddenly cold and alone. He had gone to sleep with Draco lying on his chest, hadn't he? Harry picked up his glasses from his side table and put them on. When he could see again he looked up and saw that his door was slightly ajar. This made Harry feel uneasy. But he got up to investigate. Maybe Draco had just gotten up to go to the bathroom, Harry thought. So he started walking to the bathroom to find Draco.
“OK, spread your legs then.” Harry said as he moved back. Draco brought his knees to his chest and spread them apart.
Harry moved beside Draco and they looked at each other in the mirror. Both boys were silent for a bit then Draco broke it by saying, “That's a bit of a mood killer huh.” Draco laughed bitterly. He had never hated himself more than he did right at that moment.
“Yes please. It’s just too much right now and I’m still groggy.” Draco crawled to Harry and hugged him, because the feeling of heat in his cheeks was not going to go away any time soon and he didn’t want Harry to see his face flushed.
But apart from all of that Harry was glad that he could have some kind of normal routine again -- or ever really -- and that's what staying at the burrow helped him have.
“Yeah fine.” then he really did leave and Draco was hit with a wall of silence, the only thing filling it was his ragged breathing.
But now that he’s thought about it, it’s happened before. Draco has been aroused by other boys, which was fine, but he has also been aroused by Harry before.
“Yeah, I mean you're pretty hot too, is that what you wanted to hear?” Draco gestured around at the food, “I put this whole picnic together isn't that enough.”
Harry was still laughing as he closed the door to his new room. “‘It matters because I'm a prick’ ha.” Harry had missed Draco's comebacks and remarks, they were always funny, hurtful mostly, always insulting, but funny none-the-less. Harry was struck with the realisation that maybe Draco didn't actually want to call him a prick, but instead just didn't want to admit why it mattered that Harry had kept the wand in such a good condition. That made Harry stop laughing. Instead he started pondering reasons as to why Draco didn't want to admit the real reason that it mattered. Was it because they had been enemies for so long that they couldn't be nice to each other? Or was it something else? Something more intimate and vulnerable? Harry wouldn't know unless he asked and he wasn't going to ask, not yet anyway.
The two boys spent the rest of the day talking, laughing, kissing and relaxing. Both of them were laughing about something Harry said as Draco kissed Harry and pulled him down to lie on top of him. The kiss grew in intensity and soon they were both only in their boxers. “Do you want to keep going?” Harry panted.
The two boys moved to the couch, Harry wrapped the blanket around Draco and put his arm around his shoulders to pull him closer. They sat in silence for a while, Draco quietly crying and Harry comforting him.
“OK, great. Well, did you want to walk back to our dorms together, I mean if you don't have another class before lunch?” Harry asked, a little hesitantly.
Draco got up and took off the T-shirt Harry let him borrow, looking at Harry the whole time daring him to say that he would rather stay. Harry however just did the same and took off his T-shirt while looking at Draco the whole time. Draco stuck his tongue out at Harry, Harry only laughed at that.
T-shirt. Harry got into his bed behind Draco and spooned him. Draco hummed a sigh. Harry started to lightly brush his fingertips over Draco's arm and kiss the back of his neck. “Mmm, yes keep doing that.” Draco murmured.
“Nah, Ron won't be up for another thirty minutes at the least. And I'd rather have breakfast with you today.” Harry added the last part a little shyly.
They spent the rest of their walk just talking about everything and nothing, discussing homework and how the first years are so much shorter than they were when they started. But soon they were being reminded by their stomachs that it was time to head in and go to dinner.
However Draco made the decision for him by saying, “Ah, Harry and I would like you to know that we are dating,” he held up their clasped hands as evidence, “and if you have any issues with that then too bad because there's no way we're breaking up, at least not any time soon.” Draco smiled at Harry and squeezed his hand.
“I didn't make that any easier for you, did I?” Draco thought back to all of the times that he teased, hurt, hexed or just annoyed Harry over the years.
With that Draco bolted up the stairs to his dorm, dumped his stuff and ran back down and out the portrait hole. He had overheard the golden trio talk about going to the girls bathroom, the one with Moaning Myrtle in it, tonight. So with that information in mind he made his way to the ROR to change, out of sight. Once he’d done that he trotted over to the girl’s bathroom to wait for Potter. It didn’t take long for them to come out. They were chattering about something he didn’t care about, until Weasley stopped and pointed at him saying to Potter, “Hey mate, your ferret’s back.” At this Potter’s face lit up, he looked over at Draco and swiftly walked over to sweep him up into his arms. Draco immediately snuggled into his embrace, reveling in the warmth. How was he always so warm? “He really likes you doesn’t he.” Weasley laughed.
Soon the two boys were kissing each other and rubbing their hips together. Draco had rolled over to get a better advantage. This proved to be mostly fruitful though it still was not enough for either boy. Harry was the first to acknowledge this by snaking his hand down the front of Draco's shirt and to his boxers (both boys only wore a T-shirt and boxers to bed) where he reached his hand past the waistband and began stroking Draco's cock. Draco already moaning from just rutting against Harry was reduced to whimpers and pleads for more. Harry indulged Draco by removing both of their clothing and kissing Draco's chest whilst still stroking Draco's cock. Harry continued his way down Draco's chest and stomach until he reached the skin just above Draco's prick. Harry then licked the head of Draco's cock, earning a loud moan from Draco. Harry feeling a little neglected started to stroke his own cock as he started sucking Draco's. Both moaning at the sensations, Draco's becoming louder though because of the vibrations Harry made along Draco's cock. Harry sucked Draco's cock deeper into his mouth, he moaned again and again, reducing Draco to whimpers and pleads. Draco was too close to cumming and he didn't want to cum just yet but it felt so good. Harry however, made the choice for Draco by removing his mouth with a pop and kissing the tip said, “Don't worry love, I'll make you cum, just not yet.” Draco just whimpered his reply.
Draco woke up with morning wood, and knowing he had time to spare, he reached under the warm covers and into his boxers and started pulling on his cock. He found himself thinking about Potter, thinking of him as Harry! He immediately stopped what he was doing and, realising that the only way to rid himself of his problem now would be a cold shower. Resigning himself to that decision he got out of bed, giving his wand a few quick flicks to make it then got his clothes for the day, -- eighth years didn't have to wear school robes any more -- grabbed his towel and walked to the showers with his clothes and towel in front of his crotch to hide his erection.
“Ok well,” Potter scratched the back of his head, “just, I don’t know, apologise to ‘Moine and Ron as well and you’ll have to make an effort to prove that you really are on our side. I believe you, but I don’t trust you.” Potter could be very mature, when the occasion called for it, Draco thought.
Harry studied Draco fastidiously noting his seriousness and the lack of draco calling Harry a prick or some other such insult.
Harry rolled onto his back, pulling Draco on top of him, while at the same time moving his hands to rest on Draco's arse. Draco moaned at the sensation and deepened the kiss. Then Harry ground his hips up against Draco's, both boys moaned at that. “Stop, stop, stop, stop! Harry I have to go.” Draco said as he rushed to get off Harry, pulled his pants on and run to the bathroom. Harry quickly realised what was happening and grabbed his pants, quickly pulled them on too and ran after Draco.
After a few more seconds of staring at each other, Harry smirking, Draco sneering indignantly, Harry broke the silence by saying “You take really long showers,” then as an afterthought, “unless you weren't exactly showering the whole time, and I see you've taken care of your little problem, though to be fair it’s not really that little.” he raised his eyebrows twice before saying. “If you get what I mean” Draco did get what he meant but that didn't mean he liked it, OK he kind of liked it but that didn't mean that Potter was allowed to say it.
He was awoken by movement behind him. Potter was getting up, slowly and carefully almost as if he was attempting not to disturb Draco. At this his heart melted and sped up simultaneously. But Draco quickly put his feelings aside and jumped off the bed, still a ferret thank Merlin. Though as soon as he made a break for the door Potter grabbed him up, brought him close to his face and said, “Where do you think you’re going?”
Harry slowly pushed his finger in more and more until it was all the way in. Draco moaned and said, “Move now.” Harry complied and started pulling his finger back out, pushing it back in once he reached the tip. The sensation of Harry's finger burned but it felt so good and Draco needed more so he said as much to Harry, “Another finger, I need another.” Draco struggled to talk. Harry added a second finger at Draco's request. Starting slowly again then building up speed. He started scissoring his fingers inside of Draco, making him moan and plead for more. Harry added a third finger and started to pump them in and out getting faster and harder each thrust.
Then they were kissing. Slowly at first, just testing the waters, then Harry liked Draco's bottom lip asking for entrance. Draco happily gave it to him, opening his mouth to let Harry explore it with his tongue. The boys just melted into one another, kissing and running their hands over the other. There was no pressure for anything more in that kiss, just the movement of lips and tongues. Draco pulled away first, needing to take a breath. Both boys were panting from lack of breath but they were smiling at each other. “Wow.” Draco said.
On the way down they both decided to tell their friends about their relationship. They decided to sit at the Gryffindor table to tell Harry's friends first. They walked into the Hall without holding hands but when they sat down they held hands under the table. Hermione raised an eyebrow at the absence of the two boys hands but didn't say anything. Harry realized that he would have to get the attention of his friends without the help of anyone else. This proved harder than he would have thought. He first succeeded in getting the attention of Hermione and Ron fairly easily but it was a lot harder to pull Dean and Seamus from their conversation about Merlin knows what. Though when he finally had the attention of his friends (excluding Neville as he was sitting with Luna at the Ravenclaw table) he didn't know what exactly to say. He didn't just want to say ‘Draco and I are dating’ but he also didn't want to say ‘Draco and I used to be enemies and we have had our differences in the past but in the past few weeks we have found that we get along pretty well, as you already know, and, well, we both really like each other and are very attracted to each other and are now in a relationship.’ because both were decent ways of explaining that he and Draco were dating but neither felt like the right thing to say.
Once he was satisfied with his apologies he sat down and started eating, not realising how hungry he'd become. Though since he was around gryfindors he felt that he didn't need to be polite and well mannered while eating so he dug in.
“Hey, hey it's OK, we’ll write her a letter at lunch today and explain everything to her. She’ll understand and everything will be fine, yeah?” Harry hugged Draco to himself and ran a soothing hand up and down his back.
“I'd do anything for you, but I'm not writing to your mother about our relationship.” Harry said, bringing his hands to Draco shoulders and looking him square in the eyes.
“Oh yeah it was good, in fact it was similar to what we're doing now, just with less clothes.” Harry sat back, straddling Draco's hip, and swiftly took his shirt off. Draco, having seen Harry shirtless before was not completely stunned by the sight of Harry with a bare chest. But because the sight of Harry in just his boxers is one that Draco associates with some particularly erotic memories, he found himself so lost in the sight that he didn't even realise that Harry had started kissing him. This was not a bad thing for Draco, in fact it was really good. Harry, it seems, is a really good kisser after he's just been woken up from a particularly dirty dream.
Draco finally got to the bathrooms, ran into the closest stall and removed his robes. He was reluctant to take his boxers off, not because he was uncomfortable with being nude but because it meant that he would have physical evidence that he had gotten hard because Harry had been straddling him.
They continued eating and talking until they’d all finished their food. Ron and Hermione returned to their shared dorm as did Dean and Seamus. Harry and Draco decided to go on a walk around the castle grounds for a bit before going back to Harry’s dorm.
“I- you’ve been sleeping with a ferret? Yeah I’d say that’s creepy Potter also, too much information. There are some things you really should keep to yourself, especially, who or what you sleep with.” Draco hoped he sounded incredulous.
“Harry you don't need to thank me for forgiving you.” Draco said sadly, he didn't want Harry's thanks he just wanted this whole thing over with.
Thank you so much for reading! Though again I suck at writing and I've never written anything smutty so sorry if it's bad.
Most people were either still asleep, studying or at breakfast when Draco got back to the dorm. He‘d turned back in the corridor, making sure no one saw him and made his way up to his room, uninterrupted. He was able to shower, change and get ready without any disturbance from others. That was the good thing about being in Slytherin, most people knew what personal space was. People would generally keep to themselves, knowing that if they disturb someone, they would get hexed.
Harry bent down to leave open-mouthed kisses on Draco's lower back. He continued kissing and sucking until finally he got to Draco's puckering hole. Harry slowly inserted his tongue into it, feeling the warmth of Draco and tasting what Harry could only describe as sweet, salty and purely Draco.
“Right well anyway we have transfiguration in about 10 minutes so we should probably go.” he said as he pushed himself off the sink.
Harry laughed and grabbed Draco’s hand, stopping him from trying to fix it, and brought it to his lap, lacing their fingers together and said, “I’ve given up on trying to brush it, usually I just sort of run my hands through it and hope for the best.”
“Yes, I was just teasing you,” Harry put his hand on Draco’s cheek, “it's fun to tease you, you get all red.” Harry laughed and leaned in to kiss Draco's forehead.
“Don’t be sorry.” Harry said and he kissed Draco, his joyful air gone, now replaced with a serious one. Draco was so startled he didn’t even know what to do, he froze. After a second the shock wore off and he felt tingles all through his body, every nerve lighting up. He kissed Harry back with so much passion that Harry let out a surprised moan that was muffled by Draco’s now hungry mouth.
“No, I'm really not. I'm so fucking depressed and anxious and the only thing that's making everything bearable is you.” Harry kissed the top of Draco's head.
Draco was cut off by Harry saying, “Neither did I.” he smirked at Draco, then brushed back his hair and kissed him again, just a short sweet kiss and said, “I like your hair a lot better like this: free. It looks so much better on you, and I’ve been dying from the urge to brush it out of your face, to run my hands through it.” he ran his fingers through Draco’s hair then as if to prove his point.
He of course apologised to Luna, ginny, Seamus, Dean and the others at the table, he wanted to make sure that everyone knew that he was sincere in his apologies and that he'd make up for past grievances.
Harry leaned forward and just before he captured Draco's lips in a kiss he said, “I love you, Draco.”
The kiss got more and more passionate and Harry and Draco moved to lie back down, Harry on top of Draco. Their lips moved together and it was the best kiss either of them had ever had. But Harry broke it to start kissing down Draco’s jaw to his neck. Kissing, sucking, nipping and liking all over Draco's neck. He started at the spot where Draco's jaw ends, just below his ear, Draco moaned at the feeling of Harry's lips there. Harry moved down and started on the place where Draco's neck met his shoulder, Draco’s moans got louder. Harry stopped to put up some quick silencing charms before he moved to Draco's left side. He repeated what he did which made Draco moan and squirm under Harry.
Harry so desperately wanted to go over to him and tell him that he would always be there for him and that whatever draco needed Harry would provide him with it. Harry wanted Draco full stop (period).
Draco opened his eyes, stood up and stretched. Thankfully he was still a ferret. He looked over at Potter, still asleep, he looked so peaceful. It’s really not fair, why should Draco have nightmares and horrible sleeps when the Chosen One gets to sleep like a rock? No it was fair, Potter was on the right side of the war, he was part of the good side, Draco, like all the Malfoy’s, was on the wrong side, the side with evil. Draco looked down at his little ferret arm, no Dark Mark in sight. That made him feel better. He probably never would have gotten it in the first place if he’d been friends with Potter. It was too late though, Potter would never be friends with him now, would he? Perhaps if Draco was really sincere in his apology then Potter would see that he really did want to be on his side, that he could be an ally. Draco was fairly intelligent, he'd be able to help the trio in their fight against evil, help them research and plot. He’d even be able to spy for them, like a double agent. He could give false information to The Dark Lord.
“Fucking hell Harry you can't just say things like that.” Draco was on his hands and knees instantly.
Though both boys wanted to avoid the subject they ended up talking about the war. About their roles and what Harry did when he was a fugitive on the run. About what Draco did while Harry was a fugitive on the run. They talked about all the horrible things Voldemort did to both of them, though mainly Draco as he had to live with Voldemort. Draco explained the reason as to why he cursed Katie Bell, why he tried to kill Dumbledore. He also talked more about his vomiting, when and why it started. How he hasn’t been able to keep a meal down for months. Draco then vomited into a bush, he’d tried not to eat too much for dinner as he’d found that he was able to keep it down longer if he ate less. Harry changed the subject then, talking about their potions essay that was due in on Thursday.
“Well then, why didn’t you say anything, and why did you act like you didn’t know?” Draco questioned.
“Yeah mate it was pretty obvious, what with all the staring longingly at each other and hanging out together. Like, seriously I came by your dorm earlier and either I heard you two going at it or someone else was in there. Next time use silencing charms.” Ron said. Both boys looked at each other, wide eyes and pink cheeks, Harry shrugged apologetically.
Draco could think of only one response to that, “I’m surprised I’m not already dead from how much I’ve wanted to fix your hair. I mean do you even brush it?” Draco reached up to pull at one of the many strands that were out of place.
Draco dreamed of Harry and himself, finally loving each other like they always should have, and for once he had no nightmares of his time with Voldemort. He also managed to keep his dinner down. It seemed that Draco’s life was getting better, that finally he would be able to smile and it wouldn’t be fake, that when he laughed it was because he was happy not because he was trying not to cry. All Draco worried about now was whether something would come along to ruin all the good that had finally appeared in his life.
Though Draco would love to stay and curl up in Potter’s lap he really should get back to the slytherin dorms before anyone gets too suspicious. He got up out of Potter’s lap and bounded to the door. Potter looked up at him, a questioning look on his face, so Draco scratched the door to let Potter know that he wanted to leave. Potter walked to the door, “You want to leave? Don’t you want to stay, just for a little longer?” Potter said, hand on the door knob. Draco scratched the door again, indicating that he wanted to leave. “Oh ok but promise you’ll come back?” Either Potter is delusional or he thinks that a ferret can actually understand and acknowledge a promise. Nevertheless Draco nodded and scratched the door again. Potter opened it for him and walked down the stairs with Draco to open the portrait hole for him too. “Bye, baby.” Potter said, as he waved to Draco. He looked back to see that Potter was closing the portrait, Draco felt sad, almost like he’d never see Potter again. He didn’t know why his feelings had changed so much, first he hates Potter, then he’s so attracted to him that he can’t focus and now he’s sad to leave the boy. What was going on with Draco?
“Wait your into a guy!” Draco said so shocked that he almost forgot what he was meant to be talking to Harry about, “Well now I have to know who he is.” Draco demanded after a few shocked seconds.
“But I cursed that girl, I was the reason Dumbledore died. I became a fucking Death Eater!” Draco pulled up his sleeve to show his dark mark, then continued, “I'm not innocent in this Harry I do deserve to live like this, what I don't deserve is you.” Draco finished sadly.
The two boys told Draco’s friends about their relationship, to which they responded positively with Blaze saying, “Yeah, we already knew, it was just a matter of when you were going to, one; actually get together and two; when you would tell us.” and the others nodding in agreement.
However, his plan did not go according to plan.  He had to pass Potter’s dorm room on his way to the bathrooms, and, as he did Potter walked out, in such a hurry that he ran into Draco. This unfortunately made Draco drop most of his clothing and his towel, which exposed his still very noticeable erection. Both boys stopped, stared and then Potter started to laugh, again! Draco just picked up his clothes and continued on his way to the showers.
“Oh, oh, ah, stop laughing, it hurts, please please it hurts.” Draco tried to stop his laughter, only to start up again at the sight of Harry laughing.
“Apologise?!” Potter looked astounded, “Draco Malfoy, wants to apologise, to me?” Potter said, disbelief colouring his words.
Harry just laughed and squeezed Draco’s hand before going back to his breakfast, smiling to himself. Draco, also smiling, turned to the paper and looked at the front page headline, it read as follows “RIVALRY TURNED ROMANCE?” That caught Draco’s attention, he looked at the accompanying photo, to his absolute horror it showed a photo of himself and Harry at their picnic where they kiss and pull back to look at each other.  He quickly scanned through the article, picking up key information like “anonymous source sent a photo of the two who seem to no longer be rivals but, who now appear to be romantic partners.” and “our source also tells us that the two have been seen together constantly having been holding hands, kissing and exchanging loving looks to each other. Is this a start to a new relationship or have they been together long before their eighth year at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry?” Draco threw the paper down, not caring that it had gotten in his food, then turned towards Harry who was already looking at Draco, and blurted “Someone leaked a photo of us,” he motioned between them, “to the freaking Prophet and now everyone knows about our relationship!”
sorry for not posting updates for ages, but school is annoying and demands attention so I've been short on free time to write.
The two boys decided to have a picnic at lunch, they had different classes in the morning so they were unable to spend much time together, but Harry had the idea of lunch outside, a picnic, this appeared to be a great idea, one which Draco was very enthusiastic about. Draco put a whole buffet of food together for their picnic, he conjured a rug and cushions for them to sit on. He was allowed out of class early so he set the whole thing up while Harry was still in class. When Harry came outside after returning his books to his dorm he smiled, picked Draco up and kissed him. After putting Draco back down Harry said, “This is why I love you.”
Though try as he might, Draco could not find sleep, so he slipped his hand under Harry's shirt and started drawing circles on his stomach. Draco half hopped this would wake Harry up but also that drawing the soothing patterns would help them both sleep.
“Uh, well I don't think we can erase our history but, if being friendly is something you want then sure Potter let's be friendly” Harry was so happy Draco had said that they could be friendly, though he couldn't show it too much so he said,
When Draco finished writing the letter to his mother, Harry and Draco brought it up to the owlery together. They gave the letter to Draco's owl, then went for a walk around the castle grounds.
“Ha, like I wouldn't have been thinking about you anyway.” Harry said without thinking, so he added, “Because I'd be thinking of how I hated that you had my wand.” it was a feeble attempt at a save.
He could smell the smoke and when the train finally pulled into the station the smoke stung his eyes. Or at least that's what he told Ron, when he'd asked why Harry's eyes started to water. Truth be told Harry wasn't sure if it was just the smoke or if he was crying with the relief of getting to finally go home.
“Just you, I mean, you’re an animagus, which by itself is amazing, but you’re also on our side now. Assuming that you are telling the truth.” Potter looked at him, serious.
“OK good because I don’t think I can stop now.” Harry went back to kissing Draco. He kissed and licked down Draco’s neck and chest. He stopped to suck on each of Draco’s nipples. Draco moaned at every kiss, lick and suck from Harry. Harry continued kissing down to Draco’s stomach playing with Draco’s nipples at the same time. When Harry reached the top of Draco’s boxers he teased the edge with his fingertips and when Draco lifted his hips impatiently Harry gave in and took them off slowly. Harry revealed Draco’s cock (which was definitely above average) and wrapped his hand around it. Draco moaned so loud at the feeling of his cock being touched.
“Thanks.” Draco said as he kissed Harry's bare chest. Harry just hummed in response and ran his hand over Draco's shoulder and back as the two drifted off into a peaceful sleep.
The moment Harry got off the train and saw hogwarts restored (mostly) and lit up in all its former glory against the night sky, all thoughts of Draco left him and all he knew was that he was home and that everything would be okay now.
“No. Look I just wanted to apologise to you. Not just about this morning, though definitely about this morning, but also about these past couple of years.” Harry paused to take a breath, “I just wanted to say that I shouldn't have done that, any of that, and I'm sorry if I annoyed you or hurt you and I'd really like to start over.” Draco looked dubious so Harry added “I'm serious, I want to start over with you. I don't want to be ‘enemies’,” -- he used air quotes when he said “enemies” -- “any more I want to be friends or at least I want us to be friendly toward each other.” he looked up expecting Draco to punch him or hex him but what he saw was, what looked like, Draco considering it.
“Oh, that. Yeah I just wanted to apologise.” Draco said, trying to sound as sincere and sorry as he could, it was difficult seeing as it was not an interaction common between himself and Potter.
Harry woke up feeling refreshed, he'd had the best sleep ever. Harry couldn't remember a time where he'd gotten better sleep. Though he did dream about Draco a lot. They were doing some really, really intimate things. Harry was almost jealous of dream Harry. While Harry showered, dressed and walked to Draco’s room he reminisced about his dream, trying to saver every bit of it.
“No, Draco I shouldn't have fired that curse. I should have helped you then but I didn't. I can help you now though. I want to help you because I care about you.” Draco looked up at Harry again, “Draco please let me help you, if not because you deserve it then because I'm the saviour of the wizarding world and I need to save you.” Harry finished with a bit of a joke.
The sun was starting to dip down, almost touching the horizon. The sky had turned a pinky color and Draco decided that he liked the way it made Harry's hair look more like a halo, the setting sun turning it gold at the edges. Draco had always wanted to touch Harry’s hair, ever since the day he’d met him, ‘now’, he thought, ‘he could’. Not being able to resist any longer, Draco brought his hand up to Harry's hair and ran his fingers through the strands. Harry looked up at Draco then, and slowly brought his lips up to meet Draco's.
But as hard as he tried he couldn’t pay attention to his best mate. Since the war he's felt empty, except for when he was thinking about Draco or wanking while thinking about Draco. At first he had been startled by his new feelings toward the blond but now he takes comfort in it. He imagines life with Draco, kissing him, cuddling with him, being loved by him, making love with or to him. Though he generally thought about the last one while he was wanking. His feelings for Draco were an escape for him, they gave him something to focus on, something to hope for, something to fill his dreams other than the nightmares he has where Voldermort comes back or when he doesn't save Malfoy from the fire in the room of requirement. He's watched Draco strip for him but he's also watched draco slip from his grasp and fall into the fires below.
“You're welcome, Harry.” he emphasized Harry's name. Harry smiled at Draco and started eating the food Draco had laid out for them.
“Stop playing games Malfoy. I know it was you. I knew the first time I saw you, no ferret is that white, also you changed back in the middle of the night. Not all of us have the luxury of sleeping properly, some of us, have what’s called trauma which gives us insomnia. I can’t sleep through the night, I knew it was you.” Potter didn’t take his eyes off of Draco.
“Yes, Potter I want to apologise. Not just for invading your privacy, but for everything.” Draco started.
“Well mainly because I thought that I’d never see the day that you’d apologise. But also because you’re brilliant.” Potter looked triumphant.
Draco shook away the memory of when he first realised that he was somewhat attracted to Potter. There were other occurrences where Draco had been aroused by Potter but all were accompanied by the knowledge that Harry hated Draco and that it was most likely the result of his hormones and the conflict between him and Harry. But now the conflict had been resolved (mostly) and they were on the fast track to becoming friends. This made Draco unironically conflicted. Did he like like Harry or did he just have a lot of mixed emotions and hormones that were making him feel this way? Well either way he knew that he would have no chance with Harry anyway. They could be friends but nothing more. Harry probably wasn't even into guys.
“No it's not. You're just a fucking prick!” and at that Draco stormed away, back to his room harry assumed.
Draco always felt a bit sick and was used to it now so he just replied saying, “Better after sleeping.” then he remembered everything that Harry had done and added, “Thanks for everything you did last night, I'm just sorry you had to be there for it.”
Harry quickly pulled his pants back up and used a scourgify on his hands before he opened the door. Though when Harry found Draco standing there he thought he'd summoned him, just by thinking about him, and then wanking to the thought of him. But then Draco held up his wand and asked in an almost angry way “Why did you take such good care of my wand? Huh? Why didn’t you just break it? Or burn it? I mean I deserved it! Didn't I?” Draco had started to breathe heavily, this made Harry start to panic a little. Harry had been asking himself these questions too for a long time. Of course he knew that he liked Draco now and didn't wish him or his wand harm, but he didn't know how to tell Draco that.
Draco was dressed now and was combing his hair. “You know if you combed your hair it wouldn't look like a birds nest.” Draco teased.
After a few minutes of doing this Harry started to stir, then he was squirming, and that was how Draco ended up pinned under Harry. “You know I was having a great dream.” Harry said, then kissed Draco.
“Well I can pull off anything.” Draco said flirtatiously. Then Harry pulled Draco into a kiss. Ending it only to ask, “What side of the bed do you want to sleep on?”
Which was exactly who Harry was thinking about right as Draco strode through the entrance to the platform and walked over to board the train that had just pulled in. The sight of draco stirred Harry’s thoughts in a different direction. They went from pondering how soft draco's hair would feel to how lonely, tired and empty draco looked at that moment. Still he had his pride and walked with his head held as high as he could get it without him seeming arrogant. Harry admired him for his ability to hide his pain but was also sad that he had learned it so well. Though Harry knew what pain looked like and he also knew draco (if not personally then from years of “casually observing” him) and Harry could see through draco's mask straight through to his pain.
“Just don't do anything bad to it. I have a reputation to uphold you know.” Harry started walking to the chair.
“That's the first time you've referred to me as your boyfriend.” Harry mused, “I like it, do it again.”
“Well when I told the others that you two were shagging, we made a bet of when you would tell us about it, I said you would shag so much that it’d be days before you even came out of your room.” Ron laughed.
“It’s creepy is it? Well you’d know, seeing as how for the past few nights a ferret has been sleeping with me, a ferret that looks a lot like the one Moody turned you into in forth year.” Potter looked smug but Draco kept his wand raised. “Would you consider that to be creepy?”
It wasn't hormones or anything like that that made Draco aroused by Harry, it was pure attraction, affection. Draco liked Harry. Harry probably thought that Draco hated him again now. He'd just run away. He'd been silent then he ran away. What was he thinking. Well he wasn't thinking. But now he was and he resolved to go tell Harry his discovery; He liked Harry too.
Thank you so much for the reads! I'm sorry this chapter took so long for me to post but I've been a bit busy and unmotivated so I had trouble writing it but it's done now and probably really bad so I'm sorry.
Draco didn’t want to leave. Potter was so warm and the Slytherin rooms were so cold in winter. Maybe if he just turned back into a ferret now he could stay, just until Potter got up then he’d be able to sneak off. Yes that was a better plan. He’d be able to better blend in among the hustle and bustle of students getting ready for the day. So he’d be late for breakfast if he stayed, but he didn’t really care about that. All Draco cared about was the warmth of Potter. The feeling of Potter wrapped around him. Potter’s nose nuzzled into his neck. Potter’s legs tangled with his own. Potter’s chest pressed to his back feeding Draco his warmth. Potter’s cock pressed against his arse. Potter’s cock pressed against his arse? Why did Draco even think of that? It was quite noticeable. The length of it. The hardness. What was Draco thinking? This is Potter. You do not think about your enemy like this. It’s like rule number 1 of enemies: Do Not Think Of Thy Enemy Romantically Or Sexually. Draco has violated that rule. Perhaps he should leave, before it’s too late. Though it’s already too late really and what more harm can be done?
The two boys walked for a little longer after that, but soon were headed back to Harry’s dorm room to sleep. The eighth years were allowed to stay up for as long as they liked but were encouraged to stick to the same curfew as the other students. When the two reached Harry’s dorm they changed into their boxers and got into Harry’s bed together, Harry spooning Draco. They weren’t very tired as they’d slept in that morning and they’d also had a nap so they just talked and kissed for a while longer before Draco fell asleep with his head on Harry’s chest again. Harry stroked Draco’s hair for a while longer then fell asleep himself, holding Draco to himself. Though just before he fell asleep he said in a soft voice, so as to not wake Draco, “Good night, my love, good night.”
“Merlin yes.” Draco practically moaned. So with that Harry kissed the tip of Draco’s cock and licked a stripe from the base back to the tip where he wrapped his lips around and started sucking. Harry took Draco’s cock as far into his mouth as he could and Draco put his hands into Harry’s hair and pulled slightly. Harry moaned at his hair being pulled, this sent vibrations down Draco’s cock and he mewled at the feeling. Harry kept moaning as he sucked Draco’s length making Draco moan and mewl and whimper. Draco started to meet Harry’s mouth, thrusting his hips up. Harry sped up his pace as he sucked deeper causing Draco to let out a string of “Fuck, yes Harry, oh faster.” and other such obscenities. After a few more seconds of this and Draco was screaming, “Oh Harry I’m gonna cum. Fuck, fuck I’m gonna cum.” Harry just sucked harder and faster and Draco came down Harry’s throat. Harry swallowed all of it.
“N-no- Merlin that feels so good Harry. Keep going.” Draco moaned at Harry's hand on his sensitive cock.
Both boys had gotten quite a bit of homework, so they mostly just spent their afternoon and most of the night (they had to get dinner in between) getting it done. This meant that they just curled up together that night. They talked for a little while but they were both tired from a full day's work and just wanted to sleep.
