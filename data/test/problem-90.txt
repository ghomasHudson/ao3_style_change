His eves were dark. hooded and shrouded by shadows, only increased the aura of misery sounding him. The stress had let to lack of sleep, and often forgetting to eat, other times finding himself so physically overwhelmed
He carelessly threw back the last of the bottle, swallowing the colorless liquid without so much as a grimace, sighing in content when he felt the familiar burn. He let his mind wander, absentmindedly contemplating the future.
He blinked thrice to clear the white dots that were clouding his vision that reminded him so much of the white specks that he had carelessly left along the table a few hours earlier, the remnants of coke lines that lied beside rolled up fives and credit cards.
Harry’s head was pounding, and he rubbed his eyes and irritably swatted the gyrating brunette away, muttering curses under his breath and rolling his eyes when he heard her complain about how he as a 'fucking waste of a pretty girls time'
danger, he apparated straight to the fire.
Quiet mumbles left his plump lips, the words inaudible to anyone else as they spilled from his mouth. Although his words could not be interpreted, it was obvious to anyone who knew the young man what he was wishing for; the safety of his missing husband, and for his family to be whole again.
His once long, healthy fingernails were now chipped and bitten away at. his fingers, usually calloused from his work, we're now shaking, his knuckles still painted a deep purple, the mark a reminder of the news he received the previous month.
The tears are falling freely, he realises, as he takes in his husband, and suddenly he can't breathe, can't think, can't do anything except stumble toward and pull the asshole down into
"They're lost at sea, the entire crew. We're sorry Mr Malfoy-Potter, the ship wreck has been located, but none of the crew have been found. Your husband could still be stranded at
his arms as he lets out the sob he's been holding in for weeks now.
playing with the air
The room was steadily growing full though, far too full for Harry’s liking. There were hundreds of people crammed into the living room alone, not to mention the several other rooms in the penthouse. The music was loud, but the talking was louder, which led to the dj cranking up the volume a few more notches or connecting a few more speakers at least every half hour.
An old sweater swung from his shoulders, loosely hanging off of his thin frame. It wasn't his usual look, but he could still smell him on it, his scent clinging to the sweater.
soft sound
"My, my Harry, complimenting me? How the years have changed us” the silken voice purred, and before Harry could spend a second to work out why it was so familiar, the guy turned around, and Harry was faced with none other than Draco Malfoy.
"Well fuck, aren't you a sight, Draco" Harry grins, reaching forward to run a hand through his curls as he marveled at the boy in front of him “I have to admit, gorgeous, never expected to see you again, least of all here. No complaints though”
go down
go down
Fiddling gave the youthful boy something to do in an endeavour to calm his racing thoughts, though it was in vain.
“Oh. Hey, Draco.” Harry looked up at him, seeming a little lost. He looked hollow behind his eyes, and Draco could feel his eyebrows furrowing in concern. “Yeah, I’ve been…” he trailed off and glanced past Draco, into his office, to where the chalkboard hung prominently on the back wall. He seemed to curl even further in on himself. “I don’t want to count this one, okay?” he said, finally. “It doesn’t really feel like a victory.”
“I…” Harry was a bit at a loss for how to answer that. “I mean, I guess I can understand that this isn’t what you expected. I didn’t plan these dates, so I didn’t know this was happening until yesterday, either. But it’s the most personal thing I’ve gotten to take anyone to do since I’ve been here. You’re getting the truest look into my life of anyone. That’s romantic in its own right, isn’t it?”
—while Greg seemed mildly confused by his Captain’s fury. “Well, obviously. They’ve been obsessed with each other since we were eleven, and we all saw them at the gala, right?”
Harry pulled back again, his hands coming to Draco’s face, still looking like he didn’t quite believe what was happening. “You’re really staying? Like, permanently?”
Sounds of enjoyment came from around the circle as people assembled and sampled their treats. A deep, content hum emanated from next to him, and Harry turned to see Draco sucking melted chocolate off of his fingers, eyes half-closed in apparent bliss.
Draco stood still, allowing Harry’s exploration for a moment, but soon he was shifting away so that he could remove Harry’s shirt as well. Once skin hit skin, everything went a bit fuzzy. Harry vaguely remembered tripping as he tried to get out of his jeans without remembering to take his shoes off first, and the sound of Draco laughing helplessly at him, only to end up swearing as his own shoes refused to come untied.
I'm on
“Good sides, or bad sides?”
“I like the foam; it makes it feel special for some reason,” Harry said sheepishly. “But honestly, I’m also completely dependent on the caffeine these days. Pre-holiday is my busiest time of year.”
A while later, when they had parted ways, Sullivan caught Harry’s attention from where he was standing on a footbridge over a large, decorative koi pond and waved him over.
Soon, the pile on the table was significant enough that it was time to move on. “Where are my fellow puzzlers?” Leela called, and Dermot, Rose, Sadiyah, and Gabrielle joined her. They bent their heads together and started moving things around, speaking rapidly, so Harry left them to it, moving back into the maze.
A single tear escaped, a trail of heat tracing down Harry’s cheek. He dropped his head. The couch creaked. A gentle hand brushed his shoulder. The door opened, and then closed again. When he opened his eyes, Sadiyah was gone.
you waited to tell me until—fuck, I hate you so much.” He buried his face in Draco’s neck. “So fucking much.”
her way before she could teach a room full of kids an exciting new word. Hilde jumped around, holding her foot in her hand and silently swearing up a storm. “Just meet me in the hallway,” he told her tiredly when she finally calmed down enough to stand on both feet and glare at him.
It was twilight when Harry met the blue team out on the sprawling patio. Candles lit the area, highlighting an array of lounge furniture and a few secluded, trellised areas near the perimeter, and the center was taken up by an enormous swimming pool and a large hot tub, both lit from within. A long table covered in buckets of ice filled with bottles of wine and champagne stood to one side. Harry was sporting a pair of swim trunks much more modest than his earlier outfit with a short sleeved linen shirt and was pleased to find his companions similarly attired in combinations of swimwear and casual summer clothes. Cormac, Harry noticed, had foregone a shirt completely, displaying a rather impressive six pack. He was obviously very proud of his physique, but Harry couldn’t bring himself to blame him.
you can read it cover-to-cover, yeah?”
“I am well aware of that.”
Harry started slightly. “Hmm?”
Draco opened his mouth, shut it, and then moved in a way that suggested he was about to make a run for it. Harry’s hand shot out to grab him by the wrist. “Don’t you fucking dare,” he hissed.
Harry chanced a glance up to see Draco looking down at him, not with pity, but empathy. “Yeah. I do.”
“Pleeeeeeease?”
“I found her sneaking around the corner trying to get pictures of you and Gabrielle just now,” Hilde said, glaring at Nathalie. “She had a Quick Quotes Quill behind her ear and everything.”
Harry focused back on Pansy. “Wait, so these are back to back?”
Sometimes, it was the joyous bonfire rush of showing up at a garden party gala celebration and watching as someone braved the flashing cameras and nosy questions of the press for you with a weird sort of fluttering sensation in your chest, and then taking him back to your place and expressing your thanks on your knees while his hands clenched in your hair and he swore like a sailor in a storm.
Happy to have found a subject that he could discuss without revealing too much of himself or stumbling over any accidental references to their uncomfortable shared history, Draco began to share the stories of some of his more colorful clients. These led to a handful of anecdotes about the odd custom orders Harry had handled over the years, which led to a lively discussion of the pros and cons of magical versus mechanical animation of toys and gadgets.
Draco escorted him to the door, and after closing it behind him, found himself leaning against it, his mind whirling.
he was… he was—
“Don’t speak of yourself in the third person, dear; it makes you sound grandiloquent,” Narcissa interjected calmly, not bothering to look up from her plate.
“Well. In that case.” Draco set his glass on the counter before snagging Harry‘s belt loops with his fingers, tugging him forward before plucking his glass from his hand, setting it beside his own. “I believe we were in the middle of something when we were so rudely interrupted the other night.” He pulled Harry closer and kissed him.
They didn’t hold the elimination ceremony until the next morning, everyone being too tired by the time they’d returned to shower and change and wait through the filming like they didn’t already know what was going to happen.
“Um… hello, Ronald?” Draco greeted him, confused.
“I think it’s wonderful that we’re seeing more integration of Muggle culture and technology into the magical community,” McGonagall opined. “We’ve been far too isolated for far too long. It was quite a burden on our Muggleborn students. Once this ‘internet’ and ‘electronic mail’ began to take off, it became harder and harder for them to adjust to life at Hogwarts.”
“I will.” He turned, and though his expression didn’t change, Draco could see something shift behind his eyes. “Draco, what time’s your Portkey tomorrow? I’ll come see you off. If you want, I mean.”
“You can, and you will.” Pansy shook the outfit at him, and Harry cast Draco an imploring look.
“She assures me that they deactivated when things started to get… hmm, less family-friendly, shall we say?” Draco told him, eyes sparkling wickedly.
Draco narrowed his eyes but then nodded. “Fine. But we’re never speaking of this.”
Dermot’s face did something complicated. “Yeah, I did.”
Despite his best attempts, Draco had not managed to escape his mother’s machinations for her perfect Christmas Eve/housewarming party, and he was now facing the idea of spending the rest of his ‘holiday’ hand-lettering invitations and dealing with temperamental fairy labor unions to arrange lighting for the night of the event. And that wasn’t even getting into the food preparation, which he was positive was going to be a complete disaster.
“I agree.” Harry considered it for a moment before pulling his wand and transfiguring the centaurs into fauns. He paused. “Fauns aren’t real, right?”
“I don’t think I can move my arms,” he confessed as Sullivan sat down next to him.
“I wouldn’t dream of it.” Once he had his breakfast in hand, Draco joined them at the table, glancing in interest at the papers in front of them. “What are you two up to, then?”
He dropped his arm with a frustrated sigh. “Yes, fine, I’m in love with you, too. Fucking
Malfoy snorted, derisive. “The Dark Lord is—was—an accomplished Legilimens. I knew what I was doing. There were no secrets in that house. Aside from Severus’s, apparently. Which, by the way, what the fuck?”
“Great.” As Dermot arranged the instrument and his hands, he explained, “This isn’t an original, because I thought that might be a bit intense— writing you a song before we even met. But I think it captures how I feel about being here pretty well.”
“It just
“Well, he kept me company after Jack left so that I didn’t have to spend a whole day wallowing in self pity, but it’s not like they were filming that or anything. I guess they just needed to pad the episode a bit or something? I dunno.”
When Ron resurfaced, he was gasping and shivering. He glared at Ginny, who was laughing uncontrollably, and promptly grabbed her around the shoulders, pushing her completely under. She was still laughing when she popped back up, despite the cold water streaming from her hair. “That was perfect,” she said, sighing happily.
“No. Why you lied. When they caught us.”
“Ah. Well. I suppose it did what it was supposed to, then.” A pause. “I’d been thinking more along the lines of a fresh coat of paint and maybe getting rid of the house elf heads, but… hmm.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “You can have
Draco had, officially, reached the end of his patience. “BECAUSE I’M IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE!” he nearly screamed. He could feel himself shaking and took a deep, shuddering breath, trying to regain some sense of self-control.
Harry looked pointedly at the drawing’s rippling abdominals before raising an eyebrow at her, and Hilde giggled. “Okay, so I may have taken a
, he explained later, nervously, hours after Pansy had helped him properly apply the color.
“Right? No one in the house could figure out a damned thing. And believe me, we tried.” She grinned. “Things got a bit boring on the off days, with nothing to distract ourselves with. We had to make our own fun.”
She took a prim bite of her lunch, chewed, and swallowed. “You looked rather happy when you got in, last night, as well.”
She quirked a half smile at him. “I will be fine. Go dance.”
“Of course. Yeah. I can show you, come on.”
He spent a few hours in the K&C office again in the morning but found his concentration suffering and gave up by lunchtime. Rather than heading back to Hogsmeade, he decided, on a whim, to take the bus to Charing Cross Road and make a final visit to Diagon Alley in hopes of finding a gift for Harry.
“I don’t think I will. You’re a bit adorable when you’re flustered.” Her dark eyes sparkled.
“Oh my god, Draco, yes—I traded my fucking house.”
Draco, apparently having noticed the path of Harry’s gaze, had frozen in place as though he knew they were on a precipice and was afraid that one wrong move would end in disaster. At the question, though, he gave a minute, almost imperceptible nod. Hesitantly, Harry stepped in closer, bringing one hand up to cup Draco’s jaw. Slowly, he leaned up, giving Draco plenty of time to pull away. He didn’t. Instead, as the distance between them closed, his breath hitched and his eyes fell shut.
“Right. Well, I’ll see you for dinner on Tuesday. Bye.”
Sadiyah sighed, stopped walking, and looked at him. “Okay, fine. But you’re not allowed to hold this against me, alright?”
“I do NOT—”
“Only that we didn’t do that sooner,” he reassured him, smiling again. He couldn’t
“I mean,” Harry said, considering, “there were a few moments that were hard to watch. I was a bit upset that Pansy went ahead and aired the footage from the escape room, at first, for instance; and the fight about Perry was rough. But, overall, seeing everything laid out like that made it feel... sort of inevitable? And there’s something kind of nice about knowing that what we have was clear enough that Pansy bothered to record those moments in the first place.”
Harry huffed a surprised laugh. “That’s true.” He wrinkled his nose at the memory of Cormac’s slobbery attack. “Merlin. If Hermione’s accounts are anything to go by, his kissing skills have stayed pretty consistent since fifth year. That was bloody awful.”
They sat there next to each other in a discomfited sort of impasse before Harry—realizing that the extreme awkwardness had finally convinced his erection that this was
“You weren’t,” Draco assured him.
“Can we do it again?!” Teddy’s enthusiastic request came from mere feet away, and Harry rolled off of Draco impressively quickly, pulling himself up and brushing the snow off of himself as though nothing had happened. Draco followed suit, studiously not looking at him. Fucking hell. He took a deep breath and tried to be grateful that they’d been interrupted.
He thought of Harry whispering ‘
“Oh, come on,” she whined, but Harry just raised his eyebrows silently. “Ugh,
It had been a low point in and of itself. And then, things had gotten worse, because Pansy had had an idea—The Bachelor: Magical Edition.
“…fiiiiine.”
Blaise gestured for Harry to continue, so he did, running through the list he’d been consciously building in his head over the last couple weeks and unconsciously for quite a long time before that, when he thought about it. “Compassion and empathy are top. I don’t think I could be with someone who didn’t truly care about other people. Someone who believes in equality, and fairness, and doing what’s right. So much of my life has been, and still is, about making the world a better place, so finding someone who understands that is important to me. I’d also like to find someone who values family, whether blood or chosen—someone who takes care of the people they care about and will be happy to spend time with all the people who are important to me.”
Draco was happy with his life in New York. He worked at a prestigious international wizarding financial services firm (Kashburn and Costleigh), and he was good at what he did. He got to wear sharp Muggle suits and talk to very rich people about “returns on investment” and “risk management” and “diversified portfolios.” He had a beautiful, modern flat on the Upper West Side and a string of beautiful, modern men to take with him to charity galas and industry cocktail parties. He had a favorite cafe and a favorite route through the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a favorite tailor in the wizarding district that made sure all of the aforementioned sharp Muggle suits fit him like a dream. It was, frankly, more than he had ever expected of his life when he had fled from the UK immediately after the war trials were concluded.
“Whew! Finally,” Ginny yelled as they stepped into the loud, crowded bar. “I need a drink.”
“Oh.” The wind went out of Draco’s sails abruptly. He’d psyched himself up, flying high on the delight of his family at his announcement, and now he felt a bit lost. He had no idea where to find Harry if he wasn’t here; he somehow didn’t think that he’d have gone home.
of us did. Why are you so sure he didn’t?” Harry furrowed his brow. “Have you seen something behind the scenes?”
“Fine, yes, I’ll make sure to talk to everyone.”
“What the fuck are you doing, Potter?!”
“Out of curiosity,” Pansy remarked, “how exactly did you come to make Reginald’s acquaintance?”
than I expected so far, being back here. Spending time with my family; even spending time with all our schoolmates the other night. And you’re a part of that—a rather integral part, if I’m being honest—and I don’t want to mess that up. I’m not going to be here for much longer, so anything we started wouldn’t last. It
Potter let out a surprised bark of laughter, trying to cover it with a cough. “Well. Then congratulations, I suppose.” His eyes widened just a bit as something seemed to occur to him. “Wait, is that why you keep going through boyfriends so quickly? They’re boring in bed?” He sounded both incredulous and entertained, and Draco sniffed.
“This kid is almost as dramatic as you were when I met you,” Harry observed a bit later with a mischievous smirk.
Dermot’s smile widened and took on a mischievous air. “So this might make it even odder, but as you might have gathered, I’m a musician, and I have a song that I’d like to play for you. Are you up for it?” He retrieved his guitar from where it was leaning up against the side of the sofa and settled it across his lap expectantly.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “I don’t know that I think much of whatever her screening process was, at this point. So far, I’ve had to cut a woman who once tried to assault me, a man so posh he made
“Better safe than sorry,” Harry agreed, and leaned up to kiss him.
Ron squawked in indignation. “Me?! Why would you assume it was me?”
“Did you make Hilde step on those Legos?”
Her statement was apparently enough to loosen everyone else’s tongues, because suddenly Draco could barely differentiate one yelling voice from another.
“What Slytherin logic,” Draco observed, looking amused. “Fine, meet me out back in half an hour; I need to go change. But I can only come up for an hour or so.”
He leant against the counter as Harry poured a batter into two ramekins and covered them before casting a cooling charm over them and letting out a breath. “Okay! Hi. Sorry about that. Soufflés are finicky. Do you want to open that wine? There are glasses in the cupboard to your right.” He moved to the sink, thoroughly scrubbing his hands and arms before divesting himself of the apron.
When he stepped into Harry’s apartment, the living room was empty. Peering down the hall, he could see a light coming from the spare bedroom, so he made his way quietly over and found Harry leaning on the edge of a crib, looking down at a sleeping baby that he assumed was Rose Granger-Weasley. Harry glanced over at him and smiled, holding a finger to his lips. Draco gestured toward the living room with his head, and Harry nodded, following him and closing the door over behind himself.
“Hi,” Dermot greeted him once he had Harry’s full attention. His hand was still on Harry’s arm, and he guided them over to a corner with a couple of couches, sitting down and gesturing for Harry to join him. “Sorry, I hope that wasn’t rude. This whole situation is a bit odd, isn’t it?”
Maybe that’s why I started hanging out with Malfoy. Two major benefits: it pisses people off, and he doesn’t expect anything from me. We mostly just drink and lie around on the carpet listening to music. Sometimes we snark at each other, just for old time’s sake. But overall, it’s weirdly pleasant.
? Me? I resent that.” Draco’s eyes sparkled with good humor even as he attempted to look affronted.
Draco looked at him consideringly for a moment. “You know that it’s not your fault, right? You didn’t do anything wrong; you went for a walk.”
. My family had a similar one when I was a kid, and they are super fun and super difficult to control. Also, if you fuck it up, you end up with snow up your pants legs, which is fairly unpleasant. Tuck your jeans into your socks, kids. You’ll thank me later.
“Merlin, I haven’t been to Honeydukes in ages. I should stop in sometime, maybe pick up some sweets for Teddy.” He smiled, remembering afternoons full of sampling the strangest new confections with Greg and Vince, back before their world got so complicated.
Y’all, writing this fic has been a fucking ride, start to finish. Thank you SO MUCH to all of you that read along; your comments kept me going as my buffer of completed chapters got shorter and shorter and I started to wonder if I would finish on time. I hope that the ending is as disgustingly cheesy as you hoped! Personally, my teeth almost fell out writing so much pure sugary sweetness (especially that last line), but I committed to full Hallmark from the outset, and I just couldn’t end it any other way. I wish all of you who celebrate, religiously or secularly, the merriest of Christmasses—and if you, like me, can’t be physically home this year and are hurting, I hope that this absurdly fluffy nonsense could bring you a little bit of joy. Cheers to 2021 and a fresh start! 🥂
“This,” he said, gesturing between their naked bodies with his cigarette before taking another drag. “Us. Obviously. What else would I be talking about?”
Like, no one saw anything at all? How did they even get out? Why were they here in the first place? Who
Draco felt himself flush and spared half a moment to wonder if the color was anything like that of his aura before returning to the matter at hand. ‘In love’ was a little bit of an overstatement, surely—but it hit close enough to home to be unnerving. Despite the emotions roiling through him, Draco couldn’t help but ask: “Why not?”
“Hmm?” Draco asked, looking at the piece for a moment before closing it in his fist. “Oh, I don’t know. Some stupid reason, I’m sure. Why aren’t you at the cabin? Did something happen?” His expression turned concerned.
Harry snorted. “Yeah, I have a bit of experience in that myself.”
Draco wrinkled his brow, not really sure what to make of that, but then Harry asked a question about the potions bust, and Draco forgot about it, instead focusing on a dramatic retelling of his glorious victory.
Harry rubbed his eyes and reached for his glasses. “Yeah, alright.” He blinked at her, ruffling his hair sleepily. “Where have you been all day, anyway?”
Harry felt his eyes go wide. “Oh god.”
,” Harry interjected, frustrated. “He hates having to be nice for too long. Taking his annoyance out on people who were being shitty was a harmless way for him to be… well… kind of a dick, but still.”
Nancy had removed her muffins from the oven at some point while they were all working, and once everyone’s trays were in the oven, she called them back up to the front. “Did everyone set their timers?” She asked.
had an opening to invite me, if he wanted to, and he
“Okay.”
“Harry, where did you—Merlin and Morgana, Potter, why is your door open?! Put some clothes on!” Harry straightened from where he’d been bent over and looked over his shoulder, a pair of jeans and a worn tee in his hands, to find a rather pink Draco standing in the doorway. Despite his words, he was making no effort to turn away; instead, his eyes were focused quite firmly on Harry’s bum. Harry found his reaction somewhat surprising but immensely gratifying. Still, though—
“Quite. An improvement, in my opinion. I find I have less of a taste for the grotesquely opulent these days. Would you like some tea?”
A choking sound came from the left, and Harry looked over to see Draco pounding his chest, red in the face.
“Why would you even bring that?” Draco asked petulantly as Harry pulled the device from his back pocket. Mobile phones were becoming more common in wizarding society, but Draco had yet to give in to the trend. He didn’t fancy the idea of being accessible to anyone at any hour of the day.
Sullivan laughed. “Merlin, no. They’re much too pragmatic for that. Know how to keep their heads down when it’s good for them. But the Death Eaters probably would have tried to recruit us all eventually; we’re Sacred Twenty-Eight and all that nonsense, so he would have considered us a real get. So we decided to get out before it came to that. My parents never cared about blood purity and all that. I mean, neither do I, obviously.” He looked over at Harry, his expression sincere.
Harry felt himself flush. Blaise cleared his throat pointedly. “Let’s leave that to the audience’s imaginations, shall we? Now.” He clasped his hands in front of him. “On the Muggle programme on which your experience was based, the season ends with a proposal. Due to the shortened timeline, Witch Weekly opted not to include a ring in their plans. However, we’d all love to know—is there an eleventh Most Eligible title in your future, or should we keep an eye out for a different sort of announcement?”
“Well, who else would it have been?” Pansy asked, raising an eyebrow at him. Ginny buried her head in her girlfriend’s neck, snorting.
Forty five minutes later, Harry woke to the sight of Luna looming over him, her head tilted as though she was observing some form of interesting wildlife rather than a friend of more than a decade, her long hair tickling his nose. “Jesus,” he said, scrambling back a bit to sit up, one hand clutching the towel that was thankfully draped across at least the most important bits of his lower half. “You couldn’t have, I dunno, shaken me or something?”
“Shut
“Ooh, are we eating?” Ron asked, sitting up from where he’d been lying out on a towel on the rear part of the deck where the shade didn’t reach. “I’m starving.”
“Hello, everyone!” Luna greeted them brightly. “Today, we’re going to be practicing figure drawing. Have any of you done a figure drawing class before?”
ago; the
“We’re going to start the class with a series of gesture drawings. Gesture drawings are where the artist has a short amount of time—generally thirty seconds to a few minutes—to complete a sketch of a model. It’s a good way to warm up and to begin to recognize the general shapes of a body without getting too caught up in the details. A light gesture sketch can also be a great skeleton for a longer figure study. I’ll demonstrate. Harry? Would you disrobe and step onto the platform, please?”
“Did you have any idea that Nathalie wasn’t who she said she was?”
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. I just sort of fell into it, I guess? I tried a lot of things after the war. Studied wandmaking for a bit, and it didn’t really click, but I really liked the woodworking part of it, so I took some Muggle classes. I was carving things just, you know, for myself or whatever. Just small stuff—animals, that kind of thing—but then I was working at George’s shop for a bit. He does a lot of experimental charmswork, you know? And I got to thinking about how charms could be integrated into my carving, and we kind of brainstormed, and then the next thing you know, I was making these moving wooden dragons and hippogriffs and things and I just… never stopped.”
“Oh, it can,” she assured him, although she looked as much amused as embarrassed. “Are you sure you want to see?”
“Oh! Sure.” A walk actually sounded nice, Harry thought; the wine was starting to go to his head, and moving around a bit might help sober him up. He had a vague inkling that there was some reason going off alone with Romilda might not be a great plan, but he couldn’t quite remember what it was in his mildly-sloshed state, so he shrugged it off.
“Just some guy at a bar. It really doesn’t matter.”
“Bite me,” Draco answered acerbically, yelping when Harry did. Before he could form a complaint, however, Harry’s nimble fingers were undoing his trousers, sliding under the waistband to caress his hip bones.
“Harry?” Draco asked, and Harry startled, dropping the niffler onto the table, where it bounced and rolled slightly.
Harry was just about bubbling over with excitement when he met Hilde in front of the school where Neville’s day camp met. “Hey!” he greeted her, smiling widely. “I’m so excited to get to share this with you.”
Harry put a hand on his knee to silence him. “Thank you.” He gave Draco a small smirk. “Honestly, it might have been the best part of the date.”
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco sneered. “So, what, we’re all just supposed to put up with you flouncing about in the nude for the entire week?”
“Why did you even have that
Harry shrugged slightly, smiling. “I can be pretty sneaky when I want to be. I did spend the majority of our school years getting into basically every corner of the castle and grounds that I wasn’t supposed to.”
Harry shoved him away with one hand, wiping his lips with the other. “Ugh, what the hell?!” He gave Cormac a disbelieving look.
He brushed his hands off on his jeans before heading inside. As he made his way through the mudroom toward the kitchen, however, Harry found himself yanked into the games room by the neck of his shirt. For a panicked moment, he cursed himself for leaving his wand in his bedroom earlier. When he whipped around, however, it was only to see a rather irritated-looking Pansy with her arms now folded across her chest.
When they’d finished breakfast (and good lord, Harry made amazing French toast), Harry said regretfully that he had a few more projects that he needed to finish and deliver before the end of the day, and Draco admitted that he should get home to help with food preparation for the party if he didn’t want his mother to murder him with passive aggression. With a lingering kiss goodbye and a promise that they’d see each other at the party tomorrow, they parted ways.
“I wouldn’t be surprised, to be honest. Pretty much everything else I thought was myth when I was a kid has turned out to be real. Plus quite a few things I hadn’t heard of, actually.”
Harry was tempted to go check on Draco, but he managed to push down the urge. Malfoy was an adult; he could take care of himself. He probably didn’t want Harry hovering or babying him over something as commonplace as motion sickness. With effort, he managed to turn away from the house.
The London offices of Kashburn & Costleigh were located in the Muggle financial district due to their heavy use of Muggle technology and the fact that they traded in both magical and Muggle assets. It was one of the reasons that they’d grown so rapidly in recent years: the complete separation of magical and Muggle financial systems had always been a massive headache for people living with feet in both worlds, and K&C provided wix with the ability to manage their wealth across systems without getting on the bad side of either government.
“Oh come on, you can tell me.” Blaise winked.
Before too long, they came to a flower-covered archway standing incongruously between two massive trees. Harry gave Draco a puzzled look as he led them toward it, but Draco just smiled and pulled him through.
Draco couldn’t wait to discover all of them.
Harry watched him in disbelief. “We aren’t who we were in school, Draco. People change. You, of all people, should know that.”
“All of that out of your system?”
“Meaning…?” Draco licked his bottom lip, looking hopeful but uncertain.
It was too much to think about right now. He wasn’t even sure if Harry would want to keep seeing him if he stayed, or if he had only decided to give it a go because he knew there was no chance of a long-term commitment. He
Having eight hours to kill between dates was, Harry thought, possibly worse than heading from one right into the next. He contemplated taking a nap, just to kill a little time, but he and Leela had turned in so early the night before that he wasn’t remotely tired. After dithering around for a bit, he ended up taking what felt like an extremely long shower. Afterwards, when he looked at his clock only to see that he still had more than seven hours to go, he decided to work a bit more on his gigantic puzzle, which was still only about two-thirds done.
“Alright,” Hermione said determinedly, getting up and stepping out of her shorts, leaving herself in a sensible one-piece swimsuit. “I have to swim at least once while I’m here.”
Luna wandered around helping everyone set up their paper and charcoal before returning to the front of the room. “Now, Harry, we’re going to do a series of gesture drawings, and then a couple of five minute poses, and then we’ll get into a final hour-long session so that everyone can make a more complete piece. Does that sound alright?”
“Oh good.” Draco’s relief was visible. “I didn’t actually have a backup plan, so I would’ve had to get very creative if you’d decided against it.”
The Patronus looked up at Harry and began to speak in Luna Lovegood’s lilting voice, but the noise of the bar drowned out most of what it said. He caught only a few words, but they were enough to make his blood run cold.
“Wonderful. Now, strike a pose.”
“Did you not know that?” she asked, sounding surprised. “I thought it was common knowledge. They were photographed out together several times.”
To Draco’s pleasure, Pansy, Blaise, and Greg had all joined them, Greg with his girlfriend in tow—although Greg had whispered to him, when she had disappeared for a moment to refill their drinks, that he was hoping she would be his fiancée by tomorrow evening. Draco had given his heartfelt congratulations, pleased beyond measure that his friend—who had had an even more tumultuous childhood than his own, in some ways—had finally found some peace and happiness for himself. When Susan returned and pulled Greg off to see someone else she’d run into, Draco stayed with Blaise and Pansy for a few minutes, enjoying what would probably be the last time he’d get to spend with them for quite awhile, before continuing on his way.
“Rude,” Harry said, faux-indignant but unable to suppress his smile fully.
It had been perhaps twenty minutes when a long arm dropped suddenly over Pansy’s shoulder and a head of red hair leaned down to press a kiss to her temple. “Hello, gorgeous!” came the somehow-still-familiar voice of George Weasley.
“It’s just, last night, you seemed…” Harry studied his face, but it gave nothing away. “Nevermind.”
“—without you,” Harry finished, ignoring the interjection.
Malfoy gave a theatrically exasperated sigh, but there was a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth. “Well, go on then. We’ve got plenty of time for me to destroy you at Billiards another day.”
And suddenly— suddenly, everything seemed very simple. He took a deep breath, and he let it out, and he made a decision. For once in his life, Draco Malfoy was going to be brave.
Gabrielle’s drawing was done in oil pastels and was stylized, looking more like the sketch of a fashion designer than a likeness of Harry. Sadiyah’s was, like Jack’s, focused on one small section of him, but instead of his chest, she’d gone for his feet and calves.
With a dejected sort of groan, Perry flopped backward so that his head was on the back of the couch, staring up at the ceiling. “They did warn me, but I was
“Again, your sister is dressed as Willow,” Hermione pointed out with a sigh.
Draco had not done much in the way of sledding as a child. It was a bit boring to do on one’s own, which was how he spent the majority of his winter holidays, especially because the land around the Manor was almost entirely flat. What little he
Harry didn’t think it was all that much later when they made their way downstairs, but realized that it must be further along in the morning than he’d thought when seven heads turned to look at them as soon as they reached the foot of the stairs. Before he could think of anything to say, Pansy, Ginny, and Blaise broke into a round of applause and wolf whistles. Luna was smiling, and Hermione and Greg both looked quietly pleased, if a tad embarrassed.
“No, Ginny and Pansy have already shut themselves up in their room,” she said, ignoring the retching noise Ron made, “and Draco’s still feeling a bit carsick, so he’s lying down. I think Blaise might be napping; his door is closed as well.”
As the line inched forward, Leela told him stories about her time abroad, describing the major differences between living in Mumbai and London. “One of the oddest parts of coming back here, honestly, was the brooms. Wix almost exclusively use carpets there. Getting on a stick to fly just felt… weird.”
“Bye Harry!” Teddy called from where he was still sitting atop Draco.
Harry tried to hide a laugh as he accepted a slice of pizza from Hermione and a glass of wine from Ron before claiming the seat next to Draco, nudging his sprawled legs with a knee to make room. He took an eager bite of his pizza and then paused, chewing slowly, trying to figure out just what he was tasting. Wrinkling his brow, he dropped his voice in case Greg was on his way back out. “Er… does something about this taste a little… off, to anyone else?”
“Debatable.” Draco smirked, and Harry moved his hand to mess up the meticulously styled white-blond hair, earning himself an indignant squawk and effectively ending the moment.
With only ten people left, it was easier for people to catch him alone. The first to approach him was Gabrielle, looking nervous but hopeful. He felt a little guilty; the only time he’d even tried to talk to her thus far had been interrupted.
“Something that the great Harry Potter isn’t good at?” Draco had smirked at him, and Harry had shoved him in the shoulder and told him to go fuck himself, laughing. “But I’d so much rather you did,” he’d murmured when Harry had drawn near again, and Harry had given him a look that said Draco would be paying for that later. Draco looked forward to it.
“Wait, are you
A chorus of agreement (albeit with various levels of enthusiasm) came from the rest of the scattered group, and Hermione let out a relieved-sounding breath.
Forgotten in the chaos, Ron wandered up to Goyle. “Drusilla, huh? Bad luck.”
“One night and you’re already replacing my toiletries.” Harry reached out, curling his arms around Draco’s middle and pulling his back flush against his chest before biting his shoulder lightly. “I’m not sure I want to know what else you’ll manage before you head back to New York.”
Harry cracked a tired half smile, leaning his head back to rest against the back of the sofa and closing his eyes. “I’m more trouble than I’m worth, unfortunately. When I was helping George before, I was almost completely behind-the-scenes. It’s stupid, but I still draw a lot of attention, which isn’t great when the store’s already packed with holiday shoppers.”
“Indeed. Well, as we expand, we’re hoping to reallocate some of our more senior staff; the majority are still in the New York office, which leaves the rest of our locations fairly bottom-heavy. I was hoping that, since you grew up here and are familiar with the workings of the UK magical community, you might consider a transfer.”
“Did I?” Draco asked innocently. “Oh dear. There might be more elsewhere; you should probably check. I wouldn’t want to get your sheets dirty.”
“How very unreasonable, holding a grudge over a teeny little hole bashing through several stories and Salazar knows how many cart tracks that had been in use for centuries.” Draco smirked, and Harry shrugged unapologetically.
“I’m an idiot,” he sighed to himself before digging the thin book out from under his jumbled pile of clothes. Sadly, he hadn’t gotten much better at packing since his Hogwarts days. Tucking the book under his arm, he made his way downstairs.
“Teddy found it,” Draco admitted.
“But…” Draco’s eyes search his face. “But you asked me to come live here with you.”
“Yes, sir,” Harry answered with a teasing little salute before Apparating away, and Draco tried very hard not to shiver at the words. Oh, he was in trouble. But maybe not too much trouble, he supposed; dinner at Harry’s flat sounded extremely promising. He doubted that he was misreading the subtext of the invitation.
Gabrielle seemed to be having a similar thought. “This is hideous,” she observed, gazing up at it. “And perhaps a bit offensive, I think.”
“So a bit of a bleeding heart, then?”
Draco made an incoherent sound in response, dropping his hands from his legs and linking them over Harry’s shoulders to keep them in place so that he could wrap his arms around Harry’s neck. He clung to Harry as he began to slowly thrust. They rolled against each other, panting, gazes locked. Draco’s mind was blank of anything but pleasure and heat and Harry. He wanted more. He wanted everything.
Harry wasn’t the only one who had noticed; Draco and Hermione were looking in the same direction as Harry, expressions concerned. The rustling was coming closer, and it was moving fast. By now, everyone was watching in various states of unease. Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and cast a hasty shield charm over them all, and several of the others followed suit just before a huge wildcat broke through the brush into the clearing and bounced off of the bubble of charms. It recovered quickly, shaking off its disorientation, and began to prowl a circle around them.
“Ooh, yes please,” said Luna from behind Harry, causing him to jump.
“No, nothing important. It is just… some of the other people here are friendlier than others.”
“Gabrielle—” he began, but she shook her head, silencing him.
getting them?”
was. Draco could turn this around. In fact, he
The mudroom seemed dim after the bright sunlight, but to his right, Harry could make out a tall, lean figure in the games room. As Hermione headed upstairs, he rerouted himself, leaning against the doorway. “Hey Draco. Feeling any better?”
Blaise rolled his eyes. “Do I know the names of all your casual hookups?”
He’s just… here, a lot. And a big part of Teddy’s life. And it’s not like it could lead anywhere, so it would just make everything awkward.”

Harry grinned. “They’re one of the better things we’re importing now that the Ministry has stopped suppressing international trade quite so heavily. Apparently, Japan has had them for decades, but the tariffs were so high they weren’t even bothering to try to sell them here.”
“I’d really rather—”
“What?” Harry asked. He felt as though he’d come in at the middle of a conversation. “What are you even talking about?”
Malfoy,
A few years after Hogwarts, Harry had been talked into training for a marathon by Dean Thomas, who had gotten very into running after the war. Although Harry hadn’t ended up making a lifestyle of it, he had found completing the marathon to be a heady experience, and he still ran frequently, finding it—like many physical activities—to be a helpful escape when he needed to shut his brain down for a while.
like Rufus Scrimgeour,” Draco exclaimed in horror as a foul-mouthed older man took up the screen.
Draco let out a squeaking sort of sound as his hands flew down to cover himself. Harry’s eyes shot up guiltily to where Draco was staring at him in wide eyed mortification, a brilliant blush spreading over his face and down his chest. “I— it was
Harry snorted. “Fair point.” Glancing behind himself, he asked, “Is it okay for me to do this here? We haven’t really talked about…” he gestured vaguely, presumably to indicate the rest of the house and the people therein.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and looked up at the sky. “I dunno, ask if you wanted to get out of there and then try to sneak off while Ron wasn’t looking?”
“I definitely do not remember using that word even a little bit.”
to do.
anything. They were friends now, good friends, and Harry was grateful for it. Really.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And speaking of Sullivan.” Blaise suddenly looked like the cat who’d got the cream. “That was certainly an interesting development. How do you feel about him making a move last night?”
“You’ll have to wait and see.”
Finally, Narcissa put down her quill and looked up at him. Her eyes were twinkling, and suddenly he was very sure that she and Andromeda had discussed what had happened yesterday morning. “You seem awfully interested in Harry’s love life, dear. Why don’t you ask him, if you’re so curious?”
When the two eventually parted ways, Draco was surprised to see that they had passed more than an hour together—and that, once they’d been seated, it hadn’t been awkward at all. He was already on his way back to the house when he realized, with some chagrin, that he’d forgotten to go into a single store.
Draco flushed and glared. “I truly hate all of you,” he announced to the room at large.
“No,” Hilde told him, giving him a dimpled smile, “but we were at Hogwarts together. I was two years below you and in Slytherin, though, so we never had any friends in common.”
he was, even like this. He fell back as Draco returned fully to the bed, pushing on his chest and climbing atop him. Bracing himself on one hand, Draco used the other to carefully slick them both, immediately turning Harry’s laugh into a moan. “Jesus.”
“What are we even doing, Harry?” he asks. His voice is stuffy and miserable. He’s definitely been crying, then. He’s also just called me ‘Harry’, which is new, and I think it might even be exciting if it weren’t for the rest of the sentence. Because, apparently, we’re going to talk about this.
Harry responded enthusiastically, bracing his hands against the counter, but broke the kiss much more quickly than Draco would have liked. “Dinner,” he reminded Draco.
“Can’t have that,” he conceded with a smile. “I suppose we should go do our part, yeah?”
“Yeah, alright. See you later.”
When they’d finished, Harry attempted to pay, but Draco brushed him off. “I’m still wooing you,” he chided. “You may pay when you ask
“Make me.”
Harry’s walk back to the house was brisker than before. When he got back to his rooms, he pressed the button for elf service.
And then there was what Sadiyah had shared about how Hilde had treated Gabrielle sometimes. Hell, Nathalie had even accused her of trying to cause drama, although he hadn’t given it any credence at the time, as she was in the middle of being exposed as a mole. The whole thing left him feeling worn out, and he was hard pressed to pay much attention to what she said as they ate. What little he did catch seemed to be yet more about the places she wanted to visit and things she wanted to do there that, now that he was paying attention, Harry couldn’t help but notice sounded rather expensive.
Things were much less awkward after that, although at first Draco could still feel himself flushing when he accidentally brushed against Harry, and he caught the other man looking quickly away from him several times. As the evening wore on, however, the discomfort faded. Andromeda suggested a hot cocoa break, and by the time the beverages were gone, they had managed to slip into a surprisingly friendly rapport.
“Harder,” he begged, unable to bear the ecstatic intimacy any longer. Harry made a desperate sort of sound and obeyed, straightening and anchoring himself by gripping Draco’s thighs before taking up a fast, pounding rhythm that had heat building deep inside him as Harry hammered at his prostate with every thrust. It rose like wildfire, and finally, in a burst of overwhelming pleasure, consumed him.
Undeterred, Blaise went on. “What about people you’re
“Good morning, Ganty. Could you do me a favor?” At her affirmative, he asked, “Can you tell Pansy and Draco that I’m fine, but that I’d like the day to myself, and that I promise to be back here on time tonight, so they don’t need to worry?”
They started the Christmas movie that Harry had chosen and curled up on the sofa with their food while an opening monologue played over a montage of happy people at airports. “You’re not allowed to judge me for liking this,” Harry told him as he popped a chip into his mouth. “I am aware of its flaws and I don’t care.” Draco just laughed.
“Yeah, I’ll stay,” Greg agreed. “Be a bit of a waste to give up now.”
“Quite.”
“He never seemed particularly interested in any one of us while we were at the house,” Gabrielle chimed in. “And we could see behind the scenes how they were drawn to each other, especially with how the crew talked. It was a disappointment, at the time, but not a surprise.”
Harry’s stomach plummeted, his pleasant ‘television face’ dropping for a moment before he caught himself and pasted his smile back on, hoping it wasn’t obvious how forced it was. His fight with Draco was still fresh, and the reminder of the unexpectedly nice time they’d had the day before was like poking a bruise. “Uh, yeah, it was… it was really good, actually. It was kind of him to do.”
“Oh please,” she said dismissively. “It’s been six years since you two split; that line is
Harry smiled. “I think that it’s beautiful, and that you’ve got a vivid imagination,” he told her.
Harry’s amusement came to an abrupt halt as he rushed to cut her off. “RIGHT. Pizza. Downstairs. Draco, were you looking for something?” He knew that his voice had gone a bit high, but anything was better than letting Luna finish that sentence.
Harry got to bed early. He was slightly off kilter and not really sure why, and sleeping it off seemed much more appealing than trying to figure it out. He felt well-rested and refreshed when he got up the next day, so he pushed the night’s discomfort out of his mind, deciding that he must just have been overtired after two somewhat intense days in a row. It was mild and sunny, so he decided to go have a walk around the extensive grounds for a change of scenery.
“Why was— nevermind. Let’s go look for that button.”
half an hour ago. Merlin. I meant that you don’t see it when people…” He closed his eyes, looking pained. “The crew don’t talk about
The crowd exploded with screams and whistles as Perry took the stage, waving at the audience as he crossed to Blaise. “WE LOVE YOU PERRY!” a group of witches called loudly from the back of the room, making the already sheepish-looking Perry blush. He was wearing an open blazer over a tee shirt and dark washed jeans, and his hair had been cut short, curling stylishly around his ears and over his forehead.
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Harry grumbled.
Harry reached out on panicked instinct, grabbing one of Lee’s arms before he could tilt off of his broom completely and slinging it over his shoulder. Katie Bell, having seen the scene unfold, dashed forward to grab his other arm, and together, the pair got him down to the pitch, where Luna and the Arrows’ Healer—an older witch called Gertrude Arzt—were waiting with their med bags. The rest of the players descended in somber silence as the gravity of what had just occurred dawned on them all.
“Will you?”
TWICE, and I’d already read it a few times before now.”
“Of course you are. The contract has been signed,” Lucius said dismissively. He opened his paper once more.
“I’m sorry, Harry,” Perry said from where he was holding one of her arms, “but Hilde’s telling the truth.”
fit. Harry’s mouth went dry as they dismounted and sauntered over to him, giving him a knowing smirk.
“It’s lovely to see you, Mother,” he said, trying to sound enthusiastic rather than exhausted and uncomfortable but unable to hide his wince of pain.
The look Luna gave him made it clear that she found his question highly amusing, but she answered him, nonetheless. “Your energies have always drawn you to one another. They even pulled you both back to England at the same time. It was inevitable, really, don’t you think?”
“That still leaves eight people I’m trying to date, the teacher, and, oh yeah,
“Like what?”
“What about me?” Harry turned to look at Luna, who was rolling her beer bottle against her lower lip consideringly.
After the tasting, she walked them through the actual works, where they walked past vast cisterns and through rooms of stacked barrels where she talked about the different types of wood used and the ways that they affected the different lots. Apparently, in magical distilling, it was a bit similar to wandmaking in that each type of wood imbued different properties into the final product.
“Good. Now, want to tell me what’s going on? A little slower this time?”
And so here he stood, waiting nervously in an intimidatingly posh bedroom in an intimidatingly modern mansion in Brighton, waiting to try his hand at dating fourteen people at once in the hope of finding true love under the watchful eyes of thousands of wix around the UK.
Harry’s mouth slid from his shoulder to the dip of his neck, where he bit down again, slightly harder this time. Draco whimpered involuntarily. “I wouldn’t be opposed. But I generally prefer to be on the giving rather than receiving end of that, too, just so you know.” His voice was teasing, and Draco shivered, his mind immediately supplying him with an array of extremely interesting mental pictures. Merlin and Morgana, this man was going to kill him. Harry’s hands slid down Draco’s torso, edging toward his rapidly growing erection. “Although that’s not a hard and fast rule,” he added conversationally. Draco’s reply was nothing but an inarticulate whine. His head dropped back onto Harry’s shoulder as Harry’s hands reached their goal.
“Thanks,” Harry sighed, letting his eyes close. From Pansy, he knew that that was the closest to approval he was going to get, so he decided he’d take it.
“Wow.”
Ginny, who had been passing, apparently overheard this last bit because she looked over at them. “He’s here for Harry?” she asked Ron. Ron nodded, and she shifted her attention to Draco. “About damned time.” She glanced over her shoulder, and Draco followed her gaze to see Mrs. Weasley on her way back, holding several mugs and a plate of cookies. “For Merlin’s sake,” Ginny hissed, “get out of here while you can.”
“Luna Lovegood is spoken very highly of by all of the British wizards that I know and respect,” she told him coldly, “and she is a very good friend of Harry’s.”
. Secondly, she was completely addicted to reality shows. And lastly, she was, at her core, still very much a Slytherin—which meant that she was
You shouldn’t. But you know you will.
Harry looked up at him, unaccountably moved. “Thanks, Draco.”
Harry huffed out a laugh, bringing his hand up to rub Draco’s back. “Trust me, I’m not any happier about this than you are. Not that I don’t love Teddy, obviously. But timing-wise…” He trailed off before kissing Draco’s temple and pulling back, forcing Draco upright. “I’m really, really sorry.”
“Come race me!” the girl yelled, and Teddy’s mood immediately shifted back to exuberant.
fault you aren’t getting laid.” For half a second, Harry thought that her gaze had flicked toward Draco, but he quickly dismissed the idea as paranoia. Ginny snorted, burying her face in her girlfriend’s clavicle.
Harry wrinkled his nose. “I’m still not wild about it,” he admitted. “I don’t suppose you can talk Pansy and Draco into letting me keep my clothes on?”
“Yeah, really.” He released her, watching her return to Owen’s side. His arm came up around her, and it was clear that he’d been holding back out of politeness. Now that they had Harry’s blessing, he seemed to relax. “We all came here to find love, right? Or at least the potential for it.”
“Well enough. It’s more interesting than you’d expect.”
“You just did. Although I wouldn’t blame you if you’d forgotten already. I have.” He rubbed a hand over his eyes, his mask of indifference slipping just a bit, revealing his frustration. “Besides, I don’t just mean the sex. And the fact that you think I do is honestly the bigger problem. We don’t
He shook his head in amusement. Apparently everybody had their own idea of what made for a good vacation.
Harry was cold, and his legs ached. All of him ached. He’d run too far for too long with too little food, too little sleep, too little hope. He’d thought, maybe, that he would be able to rest, when it was done. But it wasn’t done. It felt as though it might never be done.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well yes, but, with family! And other friends! Not because
Harry hummed as the soft scent of lavender wafted through the glass cubicle. “That feels nice. Smells nice, too.”
Harry shrugged. “Sorry. If it’s a Muggle thing, it’s not something the Dursleys talked about.”
“Wish I could’ve,” Harry sighed. “What made you decide to leave? Were you parents heavily involved in the resistance during the first war?”
Draco groaned. “Please tell me that you aren’t including Teddy in your division of labor, Mother. He’s
Ron, as Deputy Head of his department, had dragged a reluctantly-tuxedoed Harry around for the first hour or so, introducing him to the who’s who of the British Quidditch world before finally letting him loose. “But you’d better not disappear completely,” he had warned, pointing at Harry with a knowing look, before diving into conversation with someone-or-other whose name Harry hadn’t bothered to make note of. Harry had given him a sarcastic little salute before grabbing a drink off a passing tray and making his way to his current spot, which he figured was about as out of the way as Ron would let him get without arguing with him about it.
“You also talk to him during dates.”
“Sorry, Blaise, but I think I’m going to keep my thoughts to myself for now.” Harry grinned cheekily.
They had spun their way down the hills over and over, sometimes sliding to a smooth stop, sometimes tipping ungracefully into piles of soft, pristine snow. Harry’s delighted grin had never left his face. They’d taken turns hauling Teddy, and each other, to their feet, and Harry’s eyes had twinkled with joy and what Draco thought might be affection—an affection that, inexplicably, didn’t seem to be directed solely at Teddy. Draco had found himself grinning back helplessly, his inability to tamp down the exhilaration of it all leaving him open, unguarded.
“Please.” Draco allowed her to tip the potion into his mouth, and immediately felt himself begin to fade. He vaguely heard Goyle say something about meeting them at the hospital and saw Luna summon and speak to a silvery hare that he thought must be her Patronus just before slipping into blissful unconsciousness.
“Hmm.” Draco considered. “Only if you tell me what
Perry sighed and set down his wine. “I thought that
Draco sighed. “Me too.”
Harry cleared his throat and tried to smile. He’d been extensively coached on how he was expected to behave, and he was fairly certain that Pansy would throttle him if he messed it up, cameras or no. “Yeah, definitely. It’s all a bit surreal, honestly. But I’m excited to meet everyone.”
I feel really bad about it, but he says it’s fine; he wants me to have things that are just mine, still. It’s the closest we’ve come to talking about this, about us. About the fact that most things that were ‘mine’ or ‘his’ have become ‘ours’.
“I packed sandwiches and energy bars in Greg’s satchel,” Hermione told them, “so take whatever you’d like.”
“This is different,” Harry smiled. “This is a tour bus.”
“I’d say I’m sorry you’re out of practice, but I’m really, really not right now.”
like a date, even if Harry knew better, and he didn’t really know what to do with that other than swim until his limbs felt heavy and all he could think about was a long, hot shower and a nap.
don’t know anything about them, either? Why the hell did you put them on the show, then?”
Hermione looked up from where she was curled up on one of the squashy sofas, a field guide of some sort open in front of her. “Still thinking of picking something up?”
Trays of biscuits went in and out of the oven, icing was mixed, lemon curd was whisked, and cooling charms were cast. Harry’s snowflakes were carefully floated to a tray where he could begin piping delicate white patterns onto them, while Draco moved to the table with Teddy to decorate the gingerbread, Narcissa began sandwiching raspberry jam into the stars, and Andromeda moved on to preparing peppermint meringues.
Quick shoutout to Oriberry and Rimedio, who've been commenting as we go along — y'all make my day!
Once they’d picked up speed, it was remarkably like flying, albeit quite a bit harder on the arms. Still, the smooth rush forward was familiar and exhilarating, especially with Draco racing alongside. The smell of lake water and fresh air, combined with the heat of the sun and the cool of the wind and the sound of Draco laughing and swearing beside him as Harry pulled ahead, was everything Harry could have asked for on their last day away from the real world.
Harry gave a half-hearted shrug, not quite meeting Draco’s eyes. “Yeah, I just wasn’t feeling particularly festive, I guess. Didn’t want to bring everyone down.”
Draco smirked. “Not exactly. You’re the star, after all; only the best for our charming Bachelor. It’s still very nice, though, don’t worry.” He replaced the potion where he’d found it. “You have free reign of the grounds, more or less, as long as you stay out of the common areas we’ve designated for the contestants. You won’t have trouble avoiding them; they’ve all been warded, so you’ll feel it if you get too near. Otherwise, though, do what you’d like.”
“Because no one told me.”
“Alright everyone, take a piece, go on!” Harry and Perry joined everyone, hesitantly popping their pieces into their mouths. Unsurprisingly, based on their appearance, Harry found them quite dry—they were almost more like a scone than a muffin. Nancy chewed thoughtfully. “Not a bad effort,” she said when she’d swallowed. “Perhaps a tad overcooked, and you seem to have either used a tad too little liquid or a bit too much flour. But overall, very good for a first try!” Jane looked relieved, and Kevin seemed rather pleased; they obviously hadn’t been expecting positive feedback.
Sadiyah laughed. “Fair enough. So, what do
Harry grimaced. “Sorry. Look, I was on my way to grab a coffee; can I buy you one as an apology? Or were you on your way somewhere?”
Everyone moved obediently toward the supply closet to select their materials, but over the sounds of moving chairs, Harry heard a snort of derision coming from, he suspected, Dermot again. He narrowed his eyes. He seemed to remember Dermot mentioning that he’d been a Ravenclaw and was a year below Harry, which would mean that he’d been in Luna’s class. Harry found himself wondering, suddenly, if Dermot was one of the people who used to do things like hide all of her shoes.
Harry breathed out a sigh of relief and then turned to Draco, chest still heaving with exertion. Draco couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face even as he tried to catch his breath. He could feel sweat tracking down his face, his neck, his back, and he was streaked with dirt and—he suspected—blood; but they had
much better than me.”
Harry nodded, as did his companions.
Draco let out a relieved-sounding sigh. “Merlin. Yes, please.”
“Oh fuck,” he groaned, letting himself fall backwards until he was lying flat on the counter, using his hands to help hold his legs in place. Harry focused his full attention on Draco’s leaking cock, taking it fully into his mouth and sucking.
“Rose?”
As the night went on, Draco had to grudgingly admit that Harry had been right about them not actually knowing each other, despite their many years of circling one another. But Draco had been right about something else: Harry Potter was anything but boring. On the contrary, he was so compelling that Draco found himself building a mental list of things he wanted to show Harry just to see his reactions and places he wanted Harry to take him because they sounded spectacular.
than planned?”
“Most likely not,” Draco said breezily. “Anyway, he told me that it didn’t work out because you had, and I quote, ‘too little in common in some areas and too much in others.’ And the ‘too little’ included his love of fashion and your love of Quidditch.”
Leela gave him a look he couldn’t read.
CW for a scene with someone coming on too strong that probably falls under attempted non-consensual contact. It’s brief and over the top in a way that is intended to be comedic, but if you’re uncomfortable, you can skip from “Great! There’s a path to the gardens out this way” to the next section break and should be able to get the gist of what happened from the next bit!
“That must be hard.” Blaise gave him a more theatrical look of sympathy for the cameras. “Was there anything else about today that made it all worthwhile? It looked like you had some good moments before all the drama.”
Once the cameras were off and the crew had disbursed, Pansy and Draco settled in. Draco was uncharacteristically quiet. Harry hoped he wasn’t still mad about the hot tub incident.
Harry grinned hopelessly. “Yes.”
Harry leaned into the touch, grounding himself, taking in these seconds of respite before he was called away again—always,
Goyle grunted his agreement. “You?”
Perry looked up in surprise and grinned at him. “Not at all, have a seat.”
I can, actually, a little bit. But, forced heroism aside, I don’t think I’d want to change anything.
When the rest of their friends returned, Harry and Draco were chopping vegetables in preparation for dinner. The house was immediately filled with chatter and laughter as they wandered in, heading toward bathrooms and bedrooms to shower and change. The rest of the day passed pleasantly, with everyone coming together for food before splitting off for reading or talking or cards. Quite a few bottles of wine made the rounds, and Harry felt pleasantly buzzed when he finally headed to bed, knowing that he would be asleep within moments.
As they climbed from the car, Harry happily breathing in the spicy smell of pine, the crunch of gravel announced the arrival of the rest of their party. “Oh, Harry, this is lovely!” Hermione called as she slammed her car door shut.
Harry placed a hand over it protectively. “Let’s get food handled, and
“See you tomorrow, Harry.”
*****
He nodded.
“Cousin Draco Cousin Draco!” the whirlwind shouted, coalescing, as Draco’s eyes began to focus, into a small boy with a riot of unnervingly familiar black curls.
“Do you need those?” he asked, licking a stripe up Harry’s abs.
“You’re joking, right?”
of omens.”
He looked sad and embarrassed and Draco knew that if he hadn’t already decided to tell the truth, he would have done so now. “You didn’t misread,” he said, chest tight. “I just can’t. Even if I might want to. It’s not a good idea.”
“I know an excellent stasis charm.” Draco rolled his hips against Harry’s, sliding his erection against Harry’s groin and feeling immensely satisfied to find an answering hardness.
“Darling, must you?” Pansy queried.
“Dermot,” Harry called. Dermot stepped up to him and Harry held his gaze for a moment. “I didn’t grow up with a family,” he told him, finally. “My friends are the only family I’ve ever had. They mean everything to me, and I can’t respect anyone who can’t respect them.” Dermot flinched, at least having the grace to look repentant. “Good luck,” Harry told him.
want people to know,” Draco prevaricated, embarrassed, “I just didn’t want to… complicate things.”
There was a long shopping list of things for the party: table linens, party favors, wine, more decorations that would fit Merlin-knew-where, and new robes, among other things. It was excessive, and they both knew it, but it made her happy and so he didn’t say anything. Draco was still mildly surprised by the warm welcomes they received in every shop they entered, but he supposed that time and money could heal almost anything.
“I just thought that it might… be a good starting place. For the renovation. A clean slate.”
Harry, whose face had taken on a curious look at Draco’s unconscious glance, gave a small, relieved smile, but didn’t move away. “Good,” he said, his voice soft. He paused for a moment, seeming to make a decision, and then he was leaning down slightly, and oh god, he was doing to kiss Draco, and Draco was going to
Draco sighed, knowing that there was no way he was coming out of this unscathed. “It’s a Christmas party, then, I assume?”
It was nice, Harry thought as he looked around the circle, to have had this time with everyone. Hermione was curled into Ron’s side across the way, looking sleepy. Ron chatted with Greg while keeping a protective arm around her, and Harry smiled. He was so happy for them sometimes that it made his heart ache.
“Well this is… festive,” he finally said. “Remind me why we’re here and not catching up on our own somewhere?”
Harry was feeling restless the next morning, itching to do something that wasn’t just killing time until another pre-arranged, carefully staged date. He didn’t feel like swimming after a full day at a beach, flying didn’t sound appealing, and he’d read everything he had brought with him. Eventually, he called one of the elves and asked if they could bring him anything at all to do, which is how he ended up sitting on the floor in the middle of a 3,000 piece jigsaw puzzle when Pansy and Draco came to brief him for the next day’s date.
thought you might have said, as well.”
Harry took a deep breath and let it out slowly. “Right.”
“Yes, that. Since then, I’ve largely stuck with things you’ve either done or expressed interest in doing, but this was a bit of a wild card, so I thought it best to check your comfort level.”
He needn’t have worried. People approached him one by one, pulling him away from whomever he was speaking to with polite “I hope you don’t mind”s and “is it alright if”s and “I was hoping”s. It was definitely strange being the sole person with whom people were seeking time, but not that much stranger than some of the Ministry events he’d been insistently dragged to over the years. And at least these people all supposedly wanted to get to know him, not get something out of him. That thought made him grimace, so he pushed it away.
CW for a panic attack and references to traumatic canonical events.
Greg’s face lit up. “Are there actually boats in it?”
They’d asked endless questions about how the telly itself worked, who made the programmes and how, and how they were broadcast into people’s homes. When Harry, and then Hermione, hadn’t known all of the answers, they’d tracked down books on the specifics, venturing into the Muggle world themselves to purchase a wide range of texts as well as several used models to experiment on. Not long after, they’d announced the addition of a new product to the WWW range: a converter to allow Muggle tellies to run off magic rather than electricity. Concurrently, they had hired a team of ambitious Muggleborns—largely former Ravenclaws—to find a way to use the infrastructure of the Wizarding Wireless Network to transmit not only Muggle programming, but new stations specifically by and for the magical community. Within a few years, television broadcasting had become the fastest growing industry in the Wizarding world, and Fred and George had grown from ‘financially successful’ to ‘spectacularly wealthy’.
Because that was the thing, when it came down to it. He’d been harsh, but he hadn’t been lying; he and Max had been
Harry laughed.
Harry turned and walked away.
Draco gaped at him. “Please tell me you’re joking.” His erection was pushing painfully against his fly, and he knew for a fact that Harry wasn’t in any better shape. He couldn’t be serious.
Pounding bass
Greg eyed the water doubtfully. “Still seems unlikely this is going to fit us all.”
“What?”
“Wait, what?” Katie Bell, who had been largely silent throughout the ruckus, was looking at Harry in distress. “But, Harry, you
“Who’s got the water?” Pansy asked tiredly, apparently too worn out for sarcasm or sass.
“Oh. Yeah, okay. Thank you. I’m, uh— I’m heading into the workshop. If he asks.” Harry sounded disappointed, and Draco felt a knot in his stomach.
In some part of his mind, Harry had assumed that his natural ability to balance on things like brooms and hippogryphs and thestrals would translate into being able to balance on water skis.
“At least you got one good thing out of today,” Draco said, and his amused tone was enough to make Harry look up.
The next contestant to enter was the polar opposite of Dermot, physically: a short, curvy blond with huge blue eyes and a bubbly energy that Harry also liked immediately who introduced herself as Hilde.
Once the stew was on the stovetop, Greg decided to poke through the house guide for instructions on how to use the fire pit. Harry joined his friends in the games room, where Hermione was thoroughly trouncing both Blaise and Luna at darts, the magical scoreboard showing her a good hundred points ahead of either of them on their race to zero. Ron and Draco soon found them, returning the chess set to a cabinet in favor of watching Hermione destroy her competition.
He was several chapters in, Draco still fast asleep with his head on Harry’s lap, when the others began to trickle into the room in various states of drowsy disarray. Everyone seemed to have had the same idea as Harry, opting for pajamas or cozy loungewear. No one gave Harry and Draco a second look, although Greg did offer to refill Harry’s tea while he was in the kitchen, which Harry accepted gratefully.
Draco snorted. “I can. It sounds exactly like something Potter would do.” He bumped his shoulder against Harry’s pointedly.
“I’ve written up a template invitation and split the guest list in two; you may start with this half,” Narcissa replied with the air of someone bestowing a great favor.
The skin of his jawline, down the length of his neck
Ginny was grinning in a way that let Harry know that they were not going to hear the end of this for a long, long time. “Oh, at least once a day.”
“I’m still a little creeped out that she had cameras in my bedroom, though,” Harry said. “Feels like a bit of a violation of privacy.”
Teddy sighed. “
Despite his assurances to Hermione at the time, Harry’s last-minute babysitting gig had indeed been a problem, in that it had lost him a full day of pre-Christmas working time. He was behind on several orders that he’d promised he’d have done in time for Christmas, he’d admitted to Draco on a brief Floo call the night before. He was going to have to spend the entire day (and most likely a not-insignificant part of the night) in his workshop, eliminating any chance they’d had to go on a final date before Draco left. They were due to spend tomorrow evening making Christmas biscuits with Narcissa, Andromeda, and Teddy, and then the next day would be dedicated to party preparations. Then came the party, and then Christmas, and then… then, Draco would be gone.
want to spend two hours in a car with Ginny, Pansy, and Blaise right now. Thankfully, they managed to behave themselves—probably because within five minutes of leaving, Harry told them that if they didn’t stop tormenting him, he might be distracted enough to crash the car.
The bank they’d chosen to end their race hadn’t seemed unreasonably far when they’d started, but as they rowed on, Harry began to feel like he might have overestimated the stamina of two people who weren’t used to this sort of exercise. The shore didn’t appear to be getting any closer, but Harry’s arms were tiring, and each pull against the water felt increasingly difficult. He felt himself slowing as the muscles of his back and shoulders started to burn and his hands began to cramp.
“This was really nice,” he said once they were facing one another. “I have to admit, I wasn’t expecting much, but I had a really good time.”
“Should I stop, then?” Harry bit again, sucking lightly, his thumbs brushing at Draco’s hip bones, making him wish desperately that he hadn’t gone for a shirt that tucked in so that he could feel Harry’s skin against his.
“So, speaking of going back to New York,” Harry said quite a bit later as they sat at his kitchen table sipping tea, as though there hadn’t been a significant chunk of time and several orgasms since he’d last mentioned it, “when is that happening, exactly?”
Lucius opened his mouth, most likely to yell right back, but Narcissa held up a delicate hand to silence him. “Is such language really necessary?” Draco opened his own mouth to tell her that
Nathalie gave him a sympathetic smile. “I’ll bet. What made you decide to put yourself through this? From the way you usually talk in public appearances, it doesn’t seem like your particular cup of tea.”
“Oh stop, you sound like Blaise,” Harry laughed. “I’m fine, I promise. Confused, but fine.”
Their drinks landed on the ledge before them, announcing Harry’s name in a squeaky voice that made Draco jump, and Harry collected them and moved toward a small table. Draco had assumed that the drinks would be made to go (as was the case in most of the shops he frequented unless one specified otherwise), but they’d been prepared in chic white mugs, and so he resigned himself to a few more minutes of awkward small talk. Luckily, Harry took the lead. “So, you’re in finance these days, right?” Draco’s surprise must have shown on his face, because he quickly went on, “Narcissa talks about you sometimes.”
“Shut up,” Draco said, making Harry laugh, and he climbed out of bed. He was headed toward the loo when he remembered. “Oh! I brought you shampoo.”
“Have you seen you?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow. “You’re successful, you’re smart, and you’re gorgeous.” He coughed. “From an objective standpoint, I mean. I don’t believe for a second that you don’t get approached all the time.”
“Everything going well here?” Draco asked.
“Duly noted.” Harry flattened his palm, caressing down Draco’s side and then up his arm, his neck, finally cupping his face and leaning down to kiss him. “That was really nice,” he murmured against his lips.
… has run its course, don’t you?”
Silence for a moment. “Oh.” Draco’s voice was quieter, tentative, as he asked, “And?”
“No, you were last—”
Draco sighed and set the cigarette down, turning to face him. “There’s no
(See the end of the chapter for
Trying to distract himself, he commented blithely to his mother, “There are rather a lot of Weasleys on this list, aren’t there?”
Perry, thankfully, actually showed up for their date, which Harry thought was a good sign. Draco had arranged for them to take a baking class together, and Harry was quite excited. He’d known how to cook since he was a child, but baking was something that he’d never been able to master; it was too much like potions, in that if he didn’t pay close enough attention to the details, it tended to end in disaster.
Draco’s eyes flashed at the challenge, and Harry grinned, knowing he’d won, even before Draco thrust almost viciously back into him.
“Before we knew for sure that I was a witch,” she confided in him, sounding nostalgic, “rollercoasters were the closest I could get to flying. I haven’t been on one in ages.”
The smile made Draco’s chest clench, and he wondered if he should just come out and say that he thought perhaps he’d changed his mind, that maybe he wanted to pursue this after all. “Do you ever think of having children of your own?” he asked instead.
Harry felt warm and happy, surrounded by some of his favorite people in the world, just relaxing and enjoying each other’s company. They’d all come so far, he thought, as he watched Pansy and Hermione bicker good naturedly about the rules of some obscure darts game he hadn’t heard of while Ron and Blaise appeared deep in conversation about what must have been something to do with mixology, judging by the way Blaise was gesturing at his glass and Ron was eyeing it thoughtfully.
“She turned three in August. She’s a right terror these days; almost as opinionated as her mum.”
“So, tell me about yourself, Nathalie! I don’t know anything about almost anyone other than your names at this point. What do you do? What made you want to come on the show?”
“You’re welcome,” she answered. “Drink?”
“Well yeah, but, it’s not like he’d ever want

“Oh thank
about it? Harry, you look like—” He stopped, took a deep breath. “Who was it?”
The dinner provided for Harry and Perry came in the form of a rotating array of small plates, making the experience more interactive as they tried and recommended different dishes to each other, occasionally having to rush to grab a bite before one dish disappeared to be replaced with another.
“What the fuck, Draco?”
“A lot of the time, yeah. I like it here.”
“I mean. I don’t actually have anything to compare it to,” he admitted. This had been part of the messy, confusing tangle of thoughts and feelings he’d been trying to work out ever since Pansy had walked away. “It’s not like I’ve ever been in love before. How do you
“Yeah, I mean, overall it was great. Leela’s a lot of fun.”
“You had two different Muggleborn stepfathers, though,” Draco pointed out. “That does provide you with a bit more literacy in non-wizarding
Harry smiled at the group, hoping that his nerves didn’t show through his cheerful facade. “Hi everyone. Thank you so much for joining me on this journey. I have to admit, it took a bit of convincing to get me here—” more laughter— “but I’m very excited to get to know you all and see if one of you might be the person to get me off the cover of
“S’mores!” She looked around the circle, but was met by a collection of blank faces. “Really? None of you? Not even you, Harry?”
It was Perry’s turn to look confused. “What do you mean ‘it probably is’? You literally
“I’m going to kiss you. And you’re going to see whether it feels right to you, or whether... whatever else is on your mind means it doesn’t. Unless you don’t want me to, in which case, I think we already have your answer.”
“Well then.” Draco grinned and leaned back down, murmuring into Harry’s mouth as his hand returned to its former position. “Let’s just do this and go from there, shall we?”
“I mean… What good would it have done for me to be here?”
And if he were living here, he would be close to his family, and his friends, and— He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Hermione, who had been pointedly ignoring the pair after her defeat, looked up, her injured pride taking a backseat to her curiosity. “Really? That’s quite a tricky bit of magic.”
I’m attracted to him. But that doesn’t mean—”
Cormac and Romilda took on matching expressions of annoyance, but the others didn’t seem bothered by Harry’s approach, thankfully. Gabrielle gave him a shy smile. “I have been training as a perfumer,” she told him.
“That was my
“Seriously?” Harry gave Draco an exasperated look. “We’ve hung out like five times this week!!”
“Really?” Draco was… Draco didn’t know what he was. Surprised? Relieved? Pleased? Disbelieving? Perhaps all of them at once.

“Is he okay?” Harry asked her, concerned.
“Merlin, don’t startle a man with a knife in his hand!” Draco berated, midway through slicing a lemon in half. Looking over his shoulder, he saw that Harry had joined them in the kitchen and was leaning on the counter behind him. He turned back to the task at hand. “And of course I know how to cook; I live alone. How did you think I fed myself?”
“Really captures my essence,” Harry agreed. “Great job with the face.” He nodded at the tiny, cartoonish lightning bolt and thick circles that were obviously meant to indicate his glasses. “The resemblance is uncanny. It’s like looking in a mirror.” He let his gaze drift lower and snorted as he realized that the stick man also had a rather prominent penis. “Well, most of it anyway.”
“Can you even imagine?” he asks me.
“Don’t you ‘what’ me, Zabini.”
Leela looked like she was trying desperately to keep a straight face. “Um, yes, that was absolutely what I was going for.”
The crowd roared, and Harry watched the players circle the field as his own team took to the air.
you, makes him happy, for whatever reason. And—” he shrugged, looking sad. “He deserves to be happy. But he doesn’t really… believe that, I don’t think. So, like I said, he’ll never ask you to stay. Even though we know he wants you to. So I just… I thought you should know.” He trailed off, and then grimaced. “Seriously, though, Malfoy, please don’t tell him I told you any of this, because he might actually murder me.”
A knock came at the front door. Draco looked up from the mushrooms he was stuffing and was shocked to see that it was already late afternoon. Narcissa was carefully piping filling into a batch of gougères, so he began to set his own project aside before he heard Andromeda’s footsteps heading toward the door. Relieved, he returned to his work, not paying attention to the murmuring coming from the front of the house until he heard Andromeda calling for him.
“It’s fine,” he said, shoving his hands into his pockets. “It was my fault. I shouldn’t have assumed that you would want—” He trailed off with a small shrug. “I’m not always… the best, at reading people.”
Harry laughed. “Based on our combined experience, I’m going to say slim to none.”
Pansy shrugged her assent. “I’m more of a ‘want, take, have,’ sort of girl.”
“What the hell is wrong with you?” she hissed, looking even more exasperated with him than usual. “Every time he’s over here, you spend the rest of the day mooning, and he finally asks you out, and you say
“Shut up.” Harry kicked Draco lightly under the table, and he smirked.
“I forgot to ask, what did Ron need help for? Was everything okay?” Andromeda asked.
The vast majority of the ground floor was made up of one huge, two-story tall room, framed on one side by the wall of windows they’d seen from the outside. It held a huge fireplace and an assortment of comfortable-looking furniture. The open plan led into a large, modern kitchen full of the latest magic-electric hybrid appliances, and a short flight of stairs led down to a games room and a mud room with a door to the patio. Harry was delighted by every bit of it.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Just try to put in a
“Not really. But I’m sure I’ll have someone by then. It’s not hard to find takers.” He gestured up and down his body and raised an eyebrow in an unspoken
“Well, no, not directly, but—”
Draco let out a shuddering breath and leant down, kissing Harry again. Despite his earlier bravado, it was clear that he was nervous. Harry was, too; everything they’d done so far had been amazing, but there was something about the intimacy of this, of Draco being inside of him, that felt overwhelmingly
“Take Ginny Weasley. She’s always been a mediocre player, but the Harpies were just raring to snag her. Bet they thought taking on the Savior’s sloppy seconds would boost their popularity.”
“Luna sent an owl.”
Harry chuckled wryly. “We do seem to land ourselves on opposite sides pretty consistently, don’t we?”
“Well don’t worry, we won’t keep you in anticipation for too long! The first contestants are just pulling up now.” Blaise pointed down the long drive to where two old fashioned-looking limousines were slowly making their way toward the house. Harry felt his heart stutter but did his best to appear calm. They were just people. It would be fine.
Their final activity, it turned out, was a tour of the best Christmas lights in London. The bus meandered from place to place, stopping by the massive Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square, coasting under the glittering lights of Regent Street and Oxford Street, and gliding past the decadent window displays at Hamleys, all while a man with a microphone wove them tales of the city’s holiday history. Draco looked at the various displays appreciatively, but he found himself much more interested in watching the look of awe on Teddy’s face as they traveled from sight to sight and Harry’s delighted grin.
They finished their breakfast, teasing and touching between bites of toast and sips of tea, and Draco contemplated how completely natural it felt. Last month, if someone had told him that he would be having an amiable morning-after breakfast with Harry Potter in a few weeks, he would have laughed in their face—and possibly given them the card for his old mind healer. Hell, if he’d been told he’d have this sort of pleasant, comfortable morning-after with
“I should hope so, as the last time you saw me was at a funeral.” He held her at arms length and gave her a quick once-over of his own: same blunt bob and severe bangs, same pristine red lip, same wicked smirk. “You look exactly the same as always.”
“Shut up.”
Hermione coughed. “I’m sure we can each let Blaise borrow a few things from us. Harry, there’s laundry here, right?”
It was just after 10 PM, and Harry and his friends were making their way through the line into the Red Cap—the newest, supposedly hippest, bar in Wizarding London—for what had promised to be a truly epic Halloween party. They probably could have cut the line, if Harry were honest with himself, but he hated playing the celebrity card, and he was hoping not to draw attention to himself. Well, not for that, anyway. He couldn’t pretend that his black leather jacket and red silk shirt combination wasn’t a bit on the ostentatious side.
“I really liked him,” he mumbled, voice thick, after he had cried himself out. A hand carded through his still-damp hair.
“Yes,” Draco replied nonsensically. He turned his head to reach for Harry’s mouth, but couldn’t quite find the angle. He made a dissatisfied little sound, and Harry, apparently realizing what he wanted, kissed his shoulder once more before pulling out and rearranging Draco on his back, settling between his legs.
“Nice to meet you, Dermot.” Harry smiled back reflexively. Something about Dermot made him feel immediately at ease, and he found himself thinking that maybe this hadn’t been such a horrible idea, after all. “I look forward to getting to know you. I’ll see you inside, yeah?”
“Ooh, does this mean you’re celibate for life now? Bad luck, Potter. Not that you were getting any anyway, I’m sure.”
Harry tried to listen, he really did, but he couldn’t seem to keep his mind from wandering. He found himself thinking what it would be like to be having this conversation with Draco, instead—what it would be like to be curled up on a couch with him with a glass of wine, talking about their future.
“Er, yeah, in a closet in the mud room, I think.”
“So, care to share just what our darling Pansy said that’s got you hiding from everyone?”
“Does she really use Legilimency, then?” Hermione asked, her curiosity outweighing her caution.
“Any ideas yet on who might go the distance?”
Harry hadn’t ended up going flying; it hadn’t seemed so appealing once he’d gotten outside, so he’d gone with his plan of reading and relaxing in the sun. He was glad he had; the day of rest had left him reinvigorated for his next group date—a day out on a yacht. It was essentially just more time to get to know the contestants, but with the camera-friendly lure of scantily clad people sunbathing on the deck and potential solo shots of various contestants staring pensively out over the water as their hair blew in the wind. It wasn’t exactly a physically taxing plan, but Harry knew that he’d be passed from person to person all day long as they tried to get in some quality time with him before eliminations, so he would need his energy.
He let out a slow breath. “One. Night,” he capitulated through gritted teeth. “But understand me, Father—I am not a token in your ridiculous game of politics and power. Plot to your heart’s content, but leave me out of it.” Looking down at his half-full plate, he sighed. “I’ve lost my appetite. I’m going up to bed.”
Hermione rolled her eyes at his indignation. “Honestly, Harry, it’s not like you’re a particularly chatty correspondent. How else were we supposed to keep up with your life?”
“Indeed,” Nancy agreed. She finished her glass of water and tried to put her pleasant expression back on. “An easy enough mistake to make, and a good lesson in kitchen organization: always clearly label your ingredients, and always keep them in the same place—that way, you’ll be sure that you’re grabbing the right thing.”
With Harry, he didn’t need to. It was just… there. It was both lovely and terrifying, and it lingered at the back of his mind for the rest of the day, along with his mother’s voice, asking him:
“Yeah, that’s pretty embarrassing for you,” Leela agreed. Now that they’d sorted themselves out, she was in a buoyant, playful mood; Harry thought that her decision to ask him not to choose her must really have been weighing on her. “What should we even ask them for?”
Ron cut him off with a roll of his eyes. “Yeah, we fucking know, mate.”
“Not so much,” Leela agreed. She tilted her head, considering him. “Group hug?”
He stretched his arm forward, closing in on the darting golden ball. Then, several things happened at once. The Snitch jerked suddenly upward. Draco snapped around dizzyingly quickly, shooting up after it. A voice nearby yelled “Look out!” And, as his fingers closed around their prize, he felt two heavy objects smash into his body—one to his left shin, and the other to the exposed right side of his torso, directly against his ribs—the dual forces spinning him around violently even as he felt several things crack horribly where the Bludgers had hit him.
“Good. The crew will be disillusioned once we’re inside to avoid distracting you and the contestants, but if you need anything, cross your fingers behind your back and someone will help you out.”
“Right.” Harry cleared his throat, trying to think. “Um. So what are you… looking for, in a serious partner? I mean. Like, how do you see them, or, me, I guess, fitting into your life?” He cringed inwardly. He sounded like he was conducting a job interview. Poorly.
It didn’t actually take them long, once they were actively looking; the button was on the wall next to the table, clearly labeled. “Well. There goes my Seeker cred,” Harry grimaced.
Capulet was standing next to him, grinning, from which Draco surmised that his catch—despite its
“Yes, exactly! See, you get me.” Harry grinned and slid his thumbs under the waistband of Draco’s trousers. “Come over when this is all done?”
“No offense, but I don’t trust a single person in this room to point a wand at my head. I’ll be back in a moment.” From behind him, he could hear Andromeda laugh and his mother let out an offended huff. Ignoring them, he wiped his hands on the front of his borrowed apron, removed it, and headed up to the loo.
“Er, maybe later, love,” Ron cut her off.
“Hah! I mean, he’s not wrong. He spent the entire game I took him to trying to talk me into leaving by bribing me with sex. What did he mean by ‘too much’ in common, though?”
Harry thought about it as the others talked amongst themselves. He’d done his share of puzzle-solving over the years, but in the end, he thought his Seeker’s eye would be more useful, so he joined the four other people who had decided to stick with clue retrieval. Then, everyone split off to see what they could find.
Draco looked apprehensive. “Yes, but it’s alright if you don’t—”
“It feels really weird to be doing this again when I was just here this morning,” Harry told Sadiyah as he pushed open the cabin door. He’d spent a few pleasant hours working on his puzzle with Draco, but eventually, he’d had to get himself ready for this weird moment of prearranged deja vu. The room, as they entered, looked precisely as it had when he and Leela had arrived the night before, right down to the tastefully-set table. “They didn’t change a thing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, we should
“Oh, fuck,” Harry said groggily. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.” He yawned. “Sorry,” he repeated.
It was unclear what, exactly, happened at that point. All Harry knew was that one second, Cormac was closing the distance between them again, and the next, his foot had shot out from under him and, somehow, his flailing had propelled him right over the side and into the water.
Draco gave a weak laugh. His legs were still shaking, and he felt slightly lightheaded. “I hope you were planning on letting me spend the night, because the odds of my being able to move anytime soon are not at all promising.”
“I’m sorry, could you repeat that? I believe I must have misheard you—it sounded like you said you
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh.” Harry shivered and wrapped his arms more tightly around Draco’s waist.
“I appreciate that,” Draco said, and meant it. “But it doesn’t change the fact that I’m not seeing anyone.”
Draco rolled his eyes in such a familiar way that Harry felt himself immediately relax. “Potter, we’ve apparently been engaged in several years of prolonged and confusing foreplay. Don’t you think we’ve taken it slowly enough?”
“Mmhmm,” Draco agreed as he began to slowly stroke them together in his hand. And then, “Fuck.”
idea. It was just
At her assent, Draco stepped aside to allow her to enter. Once she’d straightened, Pansy took Draco by the shoulders and kissed him on both cheeks before stepping back to look him up and down. ‘You’re looking better than the last time I saw you,” she observed.
Teddy exclaimed, sounding scandalized.
Harry and Draco followed a tiny, enthusiastic old wizard with large glasses and a long beard as he walked them through the exhibition. It began with a series of illustrations, blueprints, correspondence, and recipes from the 1600s, which were accompanied by a tiny, moving replica of what the whole operation would have looked like at the time. Draco and Harry observed the miniscule wooden wizards working the machinery, tiny wands waving over pewter cauldrons almost as tall as themselves, Draco pointing out the bizarre sartorial choices the artist had made while Harry tried not to laugh and offend their tour guide.
“And?”
“Almost certainly Mother,” Draco replied with a smirk. “She loves a touch of dramatic holiday romance. I promise I won’t accost you in front of everyone you know, though, don’t worry.”
“Do you want to go back?” Harry asked, concerned.

“True, but that’s… mmm.” The end of the sentence got lost in a hum that was nearly a moan, and Harry gently tugged Draco’s head back by his hair, kissing up his neck before nipping at the cord of muscle leading down from behind his ear. “What was I saying?” Draco asked breathily. His fingers dug into Harry’s lower back.
Harry pondered this. “Well, obviously I want to see how we vibe when it’s just the two of us. It’s different to hang out with someone solo than it is in a group. I want to see what they’re like when they don’t need to stand out from the crowd to get my attention. Other than that, I’m hoping to sort out some key compatibility issues to see if we’re on the same page.”
“Morning,” Draco grimaced, eyes still scrunched shut.
anything, Max. You come over, we have sex. I go to your place, we have sex. We stopped
Harry laughed. “No, they pretty much do, actually. Everyone comes to play from time to time, don’t they?”
The warm hand returned to his knee and squeezed it before disappearing. “Just… think about what I said. You deserve to be happy, Harry. Even if it’s not with one of us.”
Hilde’s eyes took on a faraway look. “Oh, he’s so handsome,” she sighed.
As the movie approached its ending and each plot line began to resolve, Draco watched in horror as the Scrimgeour-look-alike appeared on the screen wearing nothing but a guitar. He looked down at Harry to berate him for not warning him about just how disturbing things were about to get only to see that Harry was fast asleep on his shoulder.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Capulet hissed. “You can’t just go cozying up to Harry Potter!”
“So, I have to ask—what made you agree to go out with me?” he asked. He knew his own carefully calculated behavior had set the ball rolling, but after their last date, he’d come to the conclusion that Harry wasn’t one to be that easily manipulated. And sure enough—
Draco Malfoy—friend, confidant, and very attractive man whom Harry had spent a
Harry leant against the door and closed his eyes for a few moments, trying to sort out what the hell to do now, before he gave it up for a lost cause and went to pee. By the time he’d brushed his teeth and showered, he’d come to the conclusion that the best thing to do would be to pretend it had never happened.
“Well, it’s… abstract,” Harry finally said, his eyes crinkling at the corners as he held back his mirth. “And Luna did say that my aura was colorful.”
“Yeah, sure. Let’s head in.” Harry fished the theatrically ornate, oversized key from his pocket. “I actually have no idea what’s in here,” he confessed as he unlocked the door. “I sort of zoned out when Pansy was explaining it all.”
“Seriously. And I had some guesses, obviously, but I didn’t have an answer myself until I was out of school. My aunt wouldn’t talk about my mum and dad, and at Hogwarts I was a bit preoccupied. But after the war, I got curious again, so Hermione and Draco helped me do some research.”
Between the odd cadence of the conversation and the unnerving nearness of Jack’s body, Harry quickly found himself in need of more alcohol and excused himself. He wondered if anyone ever got used to Jack. He suspected not.
“The ends of her hair are singed,” she cackled gleefully.
“Anyone would have done the same,” Perry answered modestly, waving him off.
Draco snorted halfheartedly. “Traitor.”
Draco woke to sunlight coming from the wrong direction, and it took him a moment to shake off his confusion and realize where he was. As he blinked away the last vestiges of sleep, the unfamiliar room around him came into focus, and the memory of the night before came back to him, making him smile. He seemed to have migrated to the far edge of the mattress during the night, he noticed, and was grateful that he hadn’t fallen right off. He stretched and rolled over—grimacing and groaning slightly at the lingering discomfort of their activities—to find Harry sprawled inelegantly on his stomach. His mouth was slightly open, his legs at odd angles, and one arm was wedged under the pillow while the other lay straight, reaching out toward Draco. He looked ridiculous, and ridiculously endearing.
Draco’s hands hadn’t left Harry’s face, and they easily guided him back, holding him still until he met Draco’s gaze. “Of course I mean it,” he said, voice shaky but firm.
“Er, hi…” Harry greeted them, looking from one to the other suspiciously. “I just wanted to check if I’m alright to head to bed.”
Harry followed his lead without thought. It felt natural, in the moment, like the obvious progression of things. And it was nice, after the gross, unwelcome attempt by Cormac. Sullivan’s lips were surprisingly soft, and he kissed Harry like a question, not a statement. It was—
Despite the fact that both teams had enough solid players to be fairly evenly matched, however, the red team was losing spectacularly. When a fairly lackluster throw by Gabrielle soared unencumbered through the hoops above William while he studied his nails in boredom, bringing the score to 110 to 10, Harry blew his whistle in frustration before heading over to the goal.
Harry popped his piece into his mouth, excited, only to almost spit it out immediately. “Oh my god,” he choked around his mouthful. Around him, he heard coughing and sputtering, and one man actually did run and spit his out in a rubbish bin. Hasty gulps of water were downed by several people trying to wash the horrifying taste from their mouths. Harry managed to swallow with a pained gulp. He looked helplessly at Perry, whose face was twisted in distaste.
Can you have a meet-cute when you’ve known each other for 15 years and literally hung out two days ago? Asking for a friend.
Harry whimpered as Draco’s hand began to move again, which he hoped Draco would interpret as the “yes please” that it was. The sense of urgency had begun to subside during their brief break, but it didn’t take long before he found himself back on the edge, hopelessly aroused by the feel of Draco’s fingers tight around them, the smell of the crook of his neck, the small sounds he was making. “Fuck, I’m— oh fuck.” His fingers clenched into the skin of Draco’s sweat-damp back, and Draco took this as encouragement to speed up his strokes. Harry had only seconds before his orgasm shot from him, his entire body tensing as he failed to stifle a resoundingly loud groan.
“Oh thank god,” Draco exhaled on a laugh.
“You’re not wrong.” Harry went to take a sip of his champagne and realized it was empty. “Do you want another drink?”
“This place is still creepy, though.”
“I can’t decide if that’s better or worse. Certainly confirms Smith’s bullshit, anyway.”
It wasn’t that Harry had a problem with Pansy. She, like most of them, had done a good deal of growing after the war, and although she would likely never be anything approaching
“And how was everybody else keeping?” Narcissa queried, pointedly not asking directly what other gossip he might have to share but obviously angling for whatever juicy details he might be willing to divulge.
And that did it. Something in Harry finally snapped, and his vision went red around the edges. Without even realizing what he was doing until it was over, he wheeled around in a tight 180-degree turn and punched Zacharias square in his stupid, smug face.
Returning downstairs, Harry found most of his friends wandering around, exploring the rest of the house. He poked his head into each of the twin bedrooms, which he was relieved to note were quite nice. Although Luna and Greg were easy to please, he was fairly sure that, had they not been up to snuff, he never would have heard the end of it from Draco or Blaise.
She draped her arms over his shoulders and grinned. “I guess you just don’t have the feet for it.”
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised, and answered without considering. “No, that’s quite all right, but thank you.”
Hilde looked pained, but stepped out of her heels and put them into one of the cubbies next to Harry’s.
She shrieked in surprise. “What the— HELP!” She ducked the first moth, but another promptly joined it, bouncing off of the side of her head as she straightened. “EW!”
to say it could be worse,” Perry snorted, and Harry shrugged helplessly as he straightened.
Draco shuddered. “Even watching was horrifying. I can’t imagine actually being the victim of whatever that was.”
Harry couldn’t stop grinning. He waved across the room to Jessica, one of the full-time staff who seemed to be in charge today. She waved back with an amused smile before returning to helping one of the younger boys separate what appeared to be some stubbornly stuck Legos. Standing back up, Harry turned to Hilde, who looked overwhelmed and lost.
Draco is the one to instigate the hug, now, pulling Harry in gently and resting his own head atop his. “Well, you’ve no shortage of family.”
*****
“Let me through, dammit! No, I’m not family, but I’m—” Draco’s eyes went wide at the voice. It couldn’t possibly be—
“I’m reasonably sure that’s not how that works,” Hermione told him, trying to sound stern but biting back a laugh.
“Attracted? Is that what we’re calling it? Because I’m reasonably sure that you’re in—”
“Potter, you
Draco made a spluttering noise. “I
“Oh,” Draco said, surprised. His mother had, of course, tried to talk him into transferring offices, but he hadn’t really thought of it as an option. “What would it entail? All of my clients are in the US; I can’t imagine they’d be pleased if I moved abroad.”
Dinner was lovely. Andromeda and Draco had put together a spaghetti carbonara in addition to the salad and rolls, and it paired very nicely with the wine Harry had contributed. The conversation was largely dominated by Teddy, whose class had begun a new unit on the solar system and who was therefore positively bubbling over with space facts.
Perry laughed. “What can I say, art is not my forte. But I think I captured the most important parts fairly well.” His eyes slid down Harry’s robe and back and he wiggled his eyebrows.
“Draco, darling, you’re not nearly as subtle as you think you are.”
with children, anyway?
“I wish,” said Ron on a sigh.
The group relaxed, chatting about the various activities they had open to them in the coming days. Harry allowed himself to tune out, watching tendrils of steam rise around them. He laid his arms along the edge of the tub, enjoying the juxtaposition of the nearly-too-hot water against the cooling night air. The heat eased the tension his muscles had built over the course of their travels, and he allowed his eyes to close as he took everything in—the smells of night air, pine, and the faint memory of woodsmoke; the sounds of bubbling water, crickets, and his friends’ chatter. Draco’s knee drifted to rest against his, thrilling and comforting at the same time—an odd mix of sensations that Harry had gotten used to experiencing in conjunction when it came to Draco.
Harry took his time chatting with various people, enjoying the luxury of not having to rush so much. He had just parted ways with Hilde after a very interesting conversation about the differences between magical and Muggle theater (neither of which Harry had much experience with, he’d admitted) when Rose and Owen approached him. He hadn’t seen much of them that evening, he realized, and they looked… well, nervous.
“Well you aren’t arranging one for me. I do not, and will not, consent to this.”
“Easier said than done,” Harry responded wryly. “Maybe I should have taken them up on that training bar thingy.”
When everyone was once again seated, Luna gestured for Harry to step back onto the podium once more. He removed his robe again, realizing, as he did so, that he was feeling much less self conscious than he had been. Luna had him sit on the chair, propping one foot up on the apple crate. She directed him to place one hand on his thigh and rest the other forearm on his raised knee. Once she had him settled in a way that she approved of, she used her wand to make several marks on the floor and crate to indicate his position, explaining to him that they would break every twenty minutes to let him stretch out and give the artists a break.
“We didn’t
Harry shook his head, not following.
Harry smiled fondly. He loved when Draco was like this, casually affectionate. He’d been worried that their multiple unfortunate encounters the day before would put a stop to it, at least for awhile; the fact that they hadn’t, he thought, was probably a testament to the strength of the friendship they’d built over the years. He was immensely grateful for it. He gave in to his earlier instinct and ran a hand through Draco’s uncharacteristically messy hair, making him hum in sleepy contentment. Picking up his mug and a mystery novel that someone had left on the end table, he settled in and began to read.
Once she was set, Harry led her around the room with him, stopping to exclaim over the painting one of the kids had wanted to show him, letting another child tell him a story about how his doll had needed to go to the hospital, and promising a small group that he would read to them the next time he was in.
close to Harry’s face—and, suddenly, Harry was feeling rather dizzy himself. He pulled his hands back, embarrassed.  “Sorry.”
When Harry woke up a few hours later, he was feeling distinctly less disoriented. In fact, he was finally lucid enough to remember the house guide that his swap-mates had sent and which was buried somewhere in his bag. The house guide that, conveniently, laid out all of the information he hadn’t been able to remember in enough detail to share with his friends.
Depositing his finds on the table, Harry allowed himself to observe for a few moments. People were working singularly or in pairs, but no one was being overtly competitive, which Harry appreciated. Owen had Rose balanced on his shoulders trying to reach something she’d apparently spotted on a high shelf, while Dermot was examining a stack of sheet music with interest, and Gabrielle was studying the seemingly empty drawer of a desk nearby. Voices and the sounds of things moving came from further into the room, but Harry couldn’t see everyone in the chaos.
Leela laughed. “Well done. Let’s go explore, then.”
“I didn’t sign anything.”
“Ten minutes for the bread, and we’ll be done.” Andromeda transferred the rest of the tomatoes she’d been slicing into the salad bowl and accepted a glass of wine from Harry. “Cheers.”
He had meant what he said when he’d told Harry that he didn’t want to ruin the bubble of comfort he was building here with his family, that he didn’t want to make everything worse in the long run. Sitting here now, though, he had the horrible realization that he was likely going to feel the tug of want and the ache of separation no matter what he did. The only way to spare himself would be to purposefully build emotional distance—to keep even their friendship at arm's length. The thought made his stomach churn, and he knew that there was no way he could bring himself to do that.

“Now get back out there; you aren’t here to chat with me, you’re here to show off those, what did Luna call them? Oh yes— ‘nice shoulders and round bottom.”
He didn’t see what happened next. There was a loud crash, a couple of gasps and, above them, a horrified squawk. Unsure if anyone had been hurt, Harry tied his robe hurriedly and joined the group, only to find Dermot standing with his arms outstretched, his face a picture in indignation. His whole right side had been doused in electric blue paint—from his hair down to his shoes. Adding insult to injury, a burst of pink and silver glitter has somehow managed to spill on top of it, leaving a swath of sparkles across his shoulder with lighter dustings of it up his neck and down his arm.
“Never tried to date a dozen or so people in one go before?” Dermot asked with a teasing smile.
“Teddy,” Harry said softly, taking the boy’s hand, “Draco can’t stay with us, he has a very important job back in New York.”
. But Sullivan made him feel small in an entirely enjoyable way, like this was someone who would take care of him.
“Yeah, a very public date at a very large event that will be full of a hell of a lot of reporters from publications that I don’t work for and therefore can’t make leave me alone. It’d be a publicity nightmare. I’ve put up with the whole circus a few times for people I was actually
The vast majority of the packages were, of course, for Teddy, and so the adults sat back and watched in fond amusement as he tore through them, delighting at the growing pile of books and toys and art supplies he unwrapped. Draco, having been informed ahead of time of Teddy’s current dinosaur fixation, had brought him several Muggle books on the subject. Harry had, in addition to several other things, zeroed in on his new interest in outer space and crafted a moving model of the solar system.
Harry was grinning now, too, the buzzing energy of their win almost visibly coursing through him. He beamed at Draco, and he looked so fucking beautiful, even though he was just as dirty and dishevled as Draco was, that Draco couldn’t help but glance, just for a second, at those lips that he’d surreptitiously observed for so long as they stretched wide with joy. When he snapped his eyes back up, however, it was clear that Harry had seen, because the smile had morphed into something that Draco couldn’t put a name to, and his eyes were searching Draco’s for something. And then—
Harry groaned. “Yes, yes it was.”
“I don’t know, really.” Harry paused, knowing that he wouldn’t be let off the hook with only that for an answer. “Everyone who’s still here is someone that I could potentially see myself with, but they’re all really different from one another. I think… I think that sometimes, you don’t really know what you’re looking for until you find it. You know? So I can’t really predict where I’ll end up. In the meantime, I’m looking forward to the solo dates. It will be great to get to really know them all a bit better to see how we might fit.”
In the end, Draco decided that his best option was to just tell Harry exactly what he had told Andromeda. He’d contemplated outright lying about his attraction, but if their situations were reversed, he knew that he would be much more hurt by a flat rejection than a logical explanation. And as much as he was tempted to take the self-preserving route, he was trying not to be that person anymore, so he’d just have to suck it up—as much as it went against his nature to do so.
“Whatever. Today’s date is with Jack, and you’ll be doing a tour of the Ogden’s distillery. Have fun, don’t get too drunk, and try to learn something about them for fuck’s sake.”
. I’ve always been very clear with you as to your responsibilities to this family, and I will not—”
, he berated himself. He had to get himself together. The last thing he needed was to complicate his holiday with a romantic entanglement—especially with someone who was so deeply entrenched in his family. It could only end badly.
Harry watched, curious. The contestants all glanced around at each other, and then—
“Well, first things first,” Blaise opened, “how are things between the two of you? Still going strong?”
Blaise rolled his eyes at them. “As I said. Ages.”
“Definitely. It will be great to see how everyone acts when they’re in a bit more natural of a setting. I’m hoping that once we get going, they’ll forget about the cameras a bit and relax.”
The comment hit hard, and Harry couldn’t contain his wince. He tried to rub a hand down his face, but grimaced as he bumped his swollen eye. He felt so small. He’d never wanted Draco to know about any of this. “I just… get angry, sometimes,” he muttered. “I go by myself. It’s just… an outlet. I don’t know. It’s never with anyone I could actually hurt. And I can heal myself. It’s just a thing I do. Sometimes.”
“Holy shit,” Harry muttered as Draco stepped forward to speak with the host.
” Harry laughed, and he closed the small distance between them, still smiling even as he pressed their mouths together.
Harry had trouble keeping himself from looking completely miserable at the elimination ceremony. He said goodbye to an unsurprised and contrite-looking Nathalie and an indignant Cormac before retreating to his room, where Blaise was waiting. “Do we have to do this right now?”
“Rose is their daughter?” When Harry nodded, she asked “How old is she?”
“Where did you come from?” he asked once his heart had begun to slow.
truth.”
They’d been out at a pub with a small group of friends at the time, and the announcement of his victory (or failure, depending on how one viewed it) was still fresh enough that he was very much not in the mood. Pansy had spent a few more minutes trying to convince him before sighing and wandering off to find someone else to talk to, and Harry had, naively, considered it a bullet dodged.
Sadiyah gave a surprised laugh. “You’re an odd one, Harry Potter. I like it.”
Draco held up his hands in surrender, very clearly trying to look sympathetic and not like he was about to laugh. “Best do as she says. She’s already mad that you kept her waiting.” Harry glared at him before snatching the outfit from Pansy and retreating to the loo to change.
“Not what he asked,” Pansy sighed, sounding exasperated.
Draco laughed. “You’re not wrong. Alright, fuck it. Give me a minute to go and let her know, and then we can proceed to drowning our sorrows.”
“Is he
“No, Pansy. It was nice of her to have you check up on me. And I thought the elf’s name was Dilly?”
Greg set down his empty beer bottle and climbed from the lounger he’d settled into. “I’ve got you!”
“Oh, it’s alright. My uncle’s yacht is larger than this one, but this is still pretty nice, I suppose.”
he told himself firmly.
“Fuck,” Harry heard Draco mutter. “Fuck fucking fuck.”
“I mean… no.”
She sniffled quietly, and his heart broke a little bit. “Hey,” he told her, reaching to tilt her chin up so that she would meet his eyes. “You are spectacular, okay? You are gorgeous, and kind, and smart, and the way you stood up for Luna today was completely fantastic.”
“We’ll take five minutes,” Luna announced. “Feel free to wander and look at everyone else’s pieces.”
Harry shrugged. “I hadn’t thought that far. Do you play chess?”
Jack shook their head, eyes sparkling.
“Takeout?” Draco rolled his eyes, and Harry shoved off the counter, moving  around the kitchen island and sliding onto one of the tall stools. He leaned his elbows on the surface, watching Draco work.
“And he was pretty sexy as Army Guy,” Hermione added.
After a few runs, Teddy had insisted on racing, but quickly called foul as Harry and Draco’s greater weight had given them the gravitational advantage. Heading off the beginnings of a pout, Harry had returned the disks and secured them a larger family toboggan instead—one which the teen manning the shack insisted could fit up to four people comfortably. Their combined weight, Harry had explained to Teddy, would make them go much faster than any one of them on their own.
Holding eye contact, Draco nodded slowly. Harry let out a gasping little laugh, and, grabbing Draco’s face with both hands, he pulled him down and kissed him fiercely.
“Art done by professionals,” Harry argued. He felt like his whole body was burning with preemptive embarrassment. “With models who knew what they were getting into.”
“It will,” Oliver asserted confidently. “Another pint to celebrate?”
Hesitantly, she added, “I don’t really think your heart is in it, either, is it? At least not tonight.”
“Nah, couldn’t have pulled off the shirt,” Ron answered, sounding truly disappointed.
Harry groaned. “Merlin, did
know.”
“He doesn’t have to, any more than you do.”
about, sure, but I’m not about to just so that you don’t have to show up for an event solo.” He turned pointedly back toward his desk, clearly done with the conversation. Draco sighed, but turned his attention back to the badly-dressed witch, who was now leaning against the edge of the photo, apparently napping. Ah, well. It had been worth a shot.
Leela let out a heavy breath and hugged him back. “You sure?”
Once they were clean and dried off, Harry offered to lend Draco some pajamas. It wasn’t terribly late yet, so rather than going straight to bed, they opened a bottle of wine and curled up on the sofa, putting on another Christmas movie—this time, a rendition of
“Once a homicidal maniac took up residence in our home?”
apparently still sound asleep. Draco Malfoy was in his bed, on top of him, sound asleep, and Harry was semi-hard and also
When it was finally time to meet Perry, Harry did his best to clear his mind and go into the evening focused solely on the two of them and any potential future together. Perry looked uncertain himself as he greeted Harry by the door. “You doing okay?” he asked, and Harry nodded, willing it to be true.
“Gladly.” Grabbing his wand once more, Harry cast a quick charm over them both, drying most of the sweat that coated their bodies. It wasn’t enough to remove the sticky aftermath of their lovemaking, but it did, at least, dispel the clammy feeling of sweat and spunk cooling in the evening air. He turned, curling against Draco’s side just to feel the warmth of his skin again. “I kind of can’t believe this is happening right now,” he admitted, his head resting against Draco’s chest. “I honestly didn’t think it ever would.”
“In an ‘I’m going to send you home right now’ way or an ‘I also think we could be good together’ way?” Perry asked, obviously aiming for teasing but not quite managing to hide his nerves.
“And where are things going, do you think?”
“It was a Muggle bar. And—” Harry was very glad that he wasn’t facing Draco for this part. “And I hit him first, anyway. It’s fine.” Draco was silent, and Harry babbled on, fueled by alcohol and anxiety. “You just got home earlier than I expected; normally I’d have—” He stopped abruptly. Shit.
“Fine. Let’s go on a date,” Potter said, as though the conversation had not been interrupted by nearly twenty hours of what Draco had to assume was an epic battle between Potter’s libido and his principles.
Draco had to fight hard not to grin triumphantly when Potter finally snapped. It was barely past lunchtime when the man spun his chair around to address Draco. Draco feigned interest in his work, studiously not acknowledging the sudden movement.
Calloused, curious fingers trailed through soft waves of deep cobalt, grazing his scalp and making him shiver.
Draco gave his sore shoulder a tentative rotation. “In one piece, as far as I can tell. Might bruise a bit, but I’m sure there’s a salve of some sort back at the house.”
“God, you really haven’t.” Sadiyah’s voice was somehow both incredulous and pitying. “I would have said something sooner, but the crew were always around, and I didn’t want to make things weird in front of the cameras. But at this point, I just assumed…” She trailed off. When he didn’t respond, she scooted closer, putting a hand on his knee. The touch was enough to shake Harry out of his stupor.
Harry obediently lifted his salt-covered skin toward his mouth. Before it got there, though, Hilde caught it and brought it back towards herself, holding her own hand out to him. Gulping, he listened to her count down from three and then licked the salt off her hand, chasing it with the burning liquor and then quickly biting into his lime slice. He was acutely aware of her tongue against his skin as she did the same. When they dropped what was left of their limes into their glasses, she grinned at him. “Well done, you. Come dance?”
Despite his own dislike of these types of events, Harry found himself enjoying watching Ron work the room. He’d come a long way since their Hogwarts days, confidently conversing with Important People—smiling, shaking hands, making introductions, moving from group to group like he was born to it. Despite how much he’d wished he could make it otherwise, Harry knew that Ron had frequently fallen into the shadow of his best friend’s fame, in school and after. It was gratifying to see him in his element, holding his own amongst people who would once have intimidated him, excelling in a role that he’d won entirely through his own hard work and passion.
“I know, I know!” Harry sat back up and gave them both a pleading look. “It’s just too soon to say, okay? I need some time to process tonight, first. It’s a lot to think through, and I’m exhausted.”
“I can— Ow, stop, I’m fine!” Harry pried himself out of Draco’s grasp, his shin smarting where it had hit the edge of one of the seats. Carefully, he levered himself out of the hot water, shivering and sitting on the side to hide the fact that he thought he might pass out if he stood up. “What’s going on? Am I late?”
past its expiration date. Anyway it’s not
He must have dozed off, because he was jolted awake by a loud, horrified voice.
The house was packed but somehow still managed not to feel crowded. From time to time, Draco caught sight of his mother or aunt subtly encouraging people to move from one room to another, skillfully balancing the populations of each space to avoid claustrophobic conditions without ever seeming like they were doing so. Draco was a bit in awe as he watched them work, not just rearranging guests, but directing conversations, pulling those who looked lost into nearby groups and making introductions, refilling wine glasses here and disappearing them there. He sometimes forgot that, despite her later choices, Andromeda had been raised with the same exacting lessons in propriety and social graces as his mother had.
“He’ll be fine,” she announced, causing several relieved looks. Turning to Draco, she told him, “Unfortunately, you seem to have broken several ribs, and you’ve rather shattered your tibia and fibula. It will require a bit more time to mend than is possible on the field, so we should get you to St Mungo’s.”
“Our third empty seat, however, I am delighted to tell you, will not be remaining empty,” Blaise went on, interrupting Harry’s musings. “Friends, it is my pleasure to welcome next season’s Bachelor: Peregrine Derrick!”
“Merlin, yes.” Ron’s voice came from the floor in front of the fireplace, where he was flopped on his back, looking exhausted. “Canoeing takes a lot of energy.”
They’d spent some time in the hot tub again the night before, blissfully easing the tension out of their tired muscles, before turning in fairly early. Draco had not joined Harry in his bed again, a fact for which Harry could not decide whether to be relieved or disappointed.
“I don’t think I’ll ever get used to that sort of thing,” he admitted. Draco just smiled.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment in abject mortification before taking a deep breath and reaching for the tie around his waist. He’d fought a dragon, he reminded himself. Surely he could handle being naked for a couple of hours.
“So you wanted to kiss him, as well?”
A smile began to spread across his Narcissa’s face.
Ron smiled fondly. “That’s my girl.” Harry bumped his shoulder against Ron’s and they continued apace.
Harry looked at him, confused. “I mean, it probably is, but does that really make a difference? You said you didn’t want to be a consolation prize.”
on your hair all through Hogwarts?” he asked as the full meaning of what Harry had just said sunk in. Harry shrugged, and Draco shook his head. “That explains so much,” he muttered. Harry elbowed him in retaliation, and the somber mood that had threatened to descend was dispelled before it could properly take hold. They teased and poked at each other as they brushed their teeth, and, eventually, made their way back to Harry’s bed, where Draco spooned up behind Harry and quickly fell asleep.
Draco did.
“Fine, I won’t.” Draco groaned at her smug smirk. “Be there at eight,” she told him. “It will be fine. You can always hide in a corner with me and Blaise if necessary. Don’t count on Greg, though; he’s dating a former Hufflepuff and you won’t get him away from her side.”
He was brought back to reality by his partner smacking him in the back of the head with a stack of paperwork. “Ow! What the fuck, Patil?”
? Why not, I don’t know, get one of those Muggle punching bags? Or spar properly, safely?” Harry clamped his lips shut, not wanting to let anything else slip out, but Draco kept going. “Why not come to me? I could have helped.”
Harry’s heart ached a little at her concern. He reached over and pulled her into a hug. “You’re not. It’s not the same at all.”
“I know.”
that I finished this show with some of my dignity intact.”
Draco bit back a groan. “That’s cheating,” he complained halfheartedly.
“About that.” Ron was smiling in a decidedly pleased-with-himself sort of way. “You should give Oliver Wood a call. Get a drink with him. We’ve been chatting, and he has an idea that I think you’ll like.” Pushing his chair back, he grabbed his plate and moved it to the sink. “Right. I have to head to work. Here’s Oliver’s floo address; you can’t show up at the game today, anyway, so you need a distraction. See you later, okay?”
They actually were in a group class today, but it was Muggle, so the ten or so strangers settled at cook stations around them weren’t a problem. Harry was somewhat curious at how the camera crew were managing, but figured that they knew what they were doing, so it was probably fine.
The conversation started out light, mostly centered around their work.
“Thanks. It’s fine, though. I’ve got a much nicer life now than I ever expected to.” Harry grinned.  “Also, I’m pretty sure my therapist bought a house off the fees I’ve paid him, so at least I know I’m doing some good for the world with my trauma.”
“That’s what Pansy said, too,” he said, trying to keep his voice steady. “Actually, she said we both were.”
“Village, actually, but yes, that’s the one. It’s lovely, but it’s too steeped in old magic for there to be an internet connection, even if the people who lived there had wanted one. I’ve been in withdrawal.”
“Seriously, though, how did you find yourself a toymaker, of all things?”
They stopped by Fortesque’s and had ice cream, after which Draco allowed Teddy to drag him through several more shops before finally saying that it was time for him to make some decisions.
Harry bit back a grin. “He really was.”
“Well, they did actually let me bring books and things, luckily, so I’ve done a bit of reading. Gone flying once or twice, swum, walked around. Dealt with a ton of invasive questions from Blaise in front of a whole camera crew. You know, the usual.”
“I didn’t, actually,” William told him, sounding as bored as ever. “My mother did. She’s been after me for ages to settle down, but I just never had the time, what with managing the manor. She was quite disappointed by my departure, but she’s delighted about dear Hilde, so it all worked out in the end.”
Harry let his arms drop and sighed, stepping back. Running a hand through his more-than-usually messy hair, he grimaced. “Not really. I just… lost my temper.”
Draco snorted. “I’ll stick to advertising, thanks ever so. As glamorous as that all sounds.”
“Sorry?” Harry asked.
“And Blaise admitted that he actually went out with Harry a few times,” Draco added, trying to hide his less-than-casual interest in the news.
Harry wrinkled his nose. “Is that really what you’re calling them? It sounds like a room that rents by the hour.”
Draco let his gaze trail obviously down Harry’s body and back up again before giving him a challenging smirk. “You’ll just have to stay quiet, then, won’t you?”
As he wandered, something niggled at the back of Harry’s mind. There was something about the day before that was bothering him, but he couldn’t pinpoint it. He was meandering through a beautiful rose garden when it came to him, stopping him in his tracks.
“Wretched. Where did you go?”
Draco finished writing a nonsense sentence that had nothing to do with his actual job before looking up. “Hmm?” he answered absently. “Sorry, what was that?”
“Wonder if it grows around here?” Ginny said speculatively, looking around as though expecting to see the rare plant sprouting from the nearby shore.
“Harry,” he said softly, stroking his hair. “Harry, come on, wake up.”
“What?!”
They chose a new animated film whose poster featured a house floating under a huge bunch of balloons, figuring that a children’s movie would be a safe bet emotionally.
Draco stared at the object in his hands. It was a gorgeous, obviously handmade picture frame decorated with an intricate pattern of delicately carved branches and leaves. The leaves were so detailed that they looked almost alive, and when Draco touched them, they fluttered as though they’d been caught in a passing breeze. At the bottom there was an inscription: ‘Black Family Christmas, 2006.’ Draco looked down in awe at the photograph contained within—a moving image of him, Andromeda, his mother, and Teddy decorating the Christmas tree together.
“Have a shield charm ready, okay?” Harry knew there was no sense in trying to talk her out of her explorations, but he hoped he could at least convince her to keep her guard up.
Briefly, he considered a portkey to New York.
Dinner’s just about ready; that sauce just needs another twenty minutes or so.”
Harry smirked before rolling his hips forward, grinding against Draco so that he could feel his hardness. “Not even close.”
“Dear, really,” Narcissa chided gently from his father’s side. “You must have known that the contract was in discussion; what else would the courting arrangements have been for?”
Harry groaned again. “Do I have to?”
you know what, nevermind.”
Harry grinned. “Hopefully that’s the only part of the family legacy she carries on.”
“Makes sense.” Harry laughed. “Anyway! Bit of a tangent we ended up on, there. I just meant it’s all been pretty crunched. So what else were you talking to your toad friend about?”
“Right. So anyway, my mum wasn’t sure either way, but dad’s a Muggle, so she decided it wasn’t worth the risk. She saw how it all happened during the first war, and it wasn’t a gamble she was willing to take. Correctly, it turns out. But she still had family in India, so we went to stay with them, and I went to an international school out there.”
Once she’d won, they split into teams of three, Harry, Ron, and Hermione partnering up and promptly crushing the others, of whom only Draco appeared to have any skill at all. While he grumbled about unfair advantages (“what, you mean having hand-eye coordination?” Harry had teased, earning himself a poke to the side that left him laughing and skittering out of the way) Ginny and Pansy wandered in, followed a bit later by Greg.
Once the doors had closed and Owen and Leela had returned to the group, Blaise addressed them all. “Congratulations on making the top twelve! But don’t rest too easily. You’ll have a day to recover, but after our next group date, two more of you will be leaving the mansion. Good night, everyone!”
, he thought, and then shook his head at his own sappiness.
“It is a bit unusual, I know, but I have always loved small luxuries. I met a lovely woman in Paris who designed the most poignant scents, and she agreed to take me on as an apprentice.”
They relocated, but as they settled in, neither said anything, Perry apparently just as unsure as Harry on how to go about this. They sat in awkward silence for a few moments. “So…” Perry finally started.
Really, Ron had brought the Xander costume on himself.
Draco’s head drooped in resignation. “I know.”
Harry thought, as they sat in the theater, that it was probably a good thing that he wasn’t much of a gambler. Before they were even fifteen minutes in, he was embarrassedly wiping away the tears streaming uncontrollably down his face, ducking his head in an effort to hide them from Draco. He was about to give it up for a lost cause when he heard a loud sniff from his left. Looking over, he saw that Draco’s face was blotchy in the flickering light of the screen and his cheeks were just as wet as Harry’s.
Harry watched from backstage as Blaise gestured to two tiered rows of chairs to his right, where eleven people sat and waved at a cheering, clapping audience.
“Me too,” she told him. “But thank you for being honest with me. I hope that you find what you are looking for.” Their hug was much more sincere. Harry kissed the top of her head once more before releasing her.
They whiled away the hours on darts and pool. Harry contemplated faking terrible form at the billiards table just to get Draco to curve his body over Harry’s to guide him—as he had for Luna at one point before she decided she preferred darts—but his competitive streak won out, and they ended up in a fierce best-of-three battle for domination. At some point, Blaise disappeared to play bartender, coming back with a variety of complicated cocktails tailored to each of their specific tastes, giving the room the air of a private club of some sort.
“Draco?” Harry asked, turning, and Draco realized that he had not, of course, been able to see the nod. He nodded again, trying desperately to ignore the drag of Harry’s clothes against his own as he turned back. Salazar but this had been an awful idea. Sledding was a terrible, uncivilized activity and he should never have agreed to take part.
“It’s just for the afternoon.”
After the debacle with Romilda, Harry was realizing that he needed to be more proactive in how he spent his time within the group, rather than just letting himself be pulled along by whomever was the pushiest. With that in mind, his first move on the boat was to join Perry at the front of the top deck, where he sat with his legs dangling under the guard rail, looking out over the water. His dark, wavy hair was pulled back in a knot, but a few strands had gotten free and were curling in the salt air, making him look charmingly disheveled.
“I knew you looked familiar,” piped up Hilde from nearby. “Didn’t you open for the Manic Mandrakes last year?”
You follow him out.
“Hope you weren’t fond of that jumper,” he managed.
“Bad luck.”
“I’ll put a charm on it to keep it steady while you get in,” Harry reassured him. “But it’s not a big deal if you do fall in. They’re designed to be easy to get out of if you roll, and we’ll use flotation charms for backup.”
Maybe, he reflected forlornly, if he thought it enough times, he would start to believe it. He soon felt the toboggan slide into motion beneath him, however, and as they picked up momentum, his discomfort was swept away in the wind.
“Come back to mine?” Draco asked, already envisioning the tantalizing planes of Harry’s body spread out across his bed without the inconvenience of cashmere and denim getting in the way. But although Harry’s pupils were blown wide with desire, there was a mischievous glint there that Draco did not like. Sure enough, Harry shook his head.
“Oh?” Sadiyah asked, sounding intrigued.
“—fucking joking, right? How long has this been going on? I should kick you off the team, you—”
“Yeah, I caught that bit.” Bizarrely, as the reality of the situation sank in, he found he wasn’t particularly upset at the rejection. If anything, he was almost… relieved. He wondered vaguely if he might be a little bit in shock. “Do you want to tell me why?”
“You’re ridiculous.”
“I’d never been on one before I finished school,” Harry confessed. “The closest I came was the Gringotts carts. But I still love them; it’s a different sort of adrenaline rush than flying, you know? Being completely out of control of the situation, even though you know you’re completely safe.”
, leaving Draco standing, stunned, on a deserted street.
The biggest surprise, however, came from Dermot. He and Blaise started out by talking about a new album he would be dropping soon, with Dermot in full media-charm mode, but when Blaise asked how he felt about his time on the show, he turned serious.
“Yeah.”
“Okay,” Harry told her, wishing he could make this easier but knowing he couldn’t. “If you need anything, come find me, okay? Or cross your fingers behind your back.” Lowering his voice, he told her “That’s what the crew has me do if I’m in need of rescuing. Don’t tell anyone.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You and Draco, you utter moron. Watching you two make sad puppy eyes at each other is
“Oh,” Harry said. He appeared to deflate slightly, obviously having geared himself up for a much more fraught conversation. “So… we were worried about the same thing, then? Nothing’s actually changed?”
“Really? Not at all?” Harry looked at him in disbelief.
“I’ll miss you,” Harry insisted with a pout, his eyes still closed, but he loosened his grip and allowed Draco to slip free.
“Not even a little bit.” Harry grinned.
, he supposed, but some of the people here were uncannily fit. The idea of Sullivan or Sadiyah, whose bodies were integral to their professions, spending hours staring at him while he was naked made him a little queasy. And that wasn’t even taking into consideration the fact that his dick would be hanging out the entire time. Although, at least he didn’t have to worry about getting an erection, he supposed; this was about the least sexy scenario he could think of at the moment.
, he sighed to himself.
Draco grimaced. “No.”
“Well, no, but he knows me.”
“What?”
He was surprised when he heard Luna call for a break, but when he moved to stretch his limbs, he realized that his feet were numb and tingly, and his back cracked alarmingly. He stood, wrapping the robe back around himself before jumping around a bit to get his blood flowing.
“Thank you,” Harry sighed as he curled onto his side, eyes already beginning to droop shut again. “Sorry I’m such a shit date.”
He sighed and looked away again, his gaze returning to the bare wall across from him. “Because by then, I knew that I’d rather be dead than live in a world where he won.”
On another note, Y’ALL, I WROTE THE FINAL CHAPTER LAST NIGHT! This story officially has an ending!
Leela’s rush of words stopped abruptly. She blinked at him. “It’s—”
Draco’s eyes fell closed, and he allowed himself to melt into it, letting his mouth fall open under Harry’s and wrapping his arms around him to pull him closer. He poured everything he had into it, trying to tell Harry without words everything that he wasn’t quite yet ready to say. Harry’s lips were salty with tears, and Draco kissed them away, wanting to take back all the hurt, to mend every little broken piece. He kissed Harry until he couldn’t breathe, and then a bit more for good measure, before he pulled back, resting their foreheads together.
Draco grinned. “Just trust me. Now, get your hair wet.” He guided Harry under the spray, watching as the water soaked his curls, pulling them straighter until his hair hung almost to his shoulders in the back. “Okay, now come here.” Harry turned obediently so that his back was to Draco, and Draco popped the shampoo open, squeezing a generous dollop into his palm before beginning to carefully massage it into Harry’s hair and scalp.
“We did,” he agreed with a smile. “They were beautiful.” Turning to his mother, he added, “
“Of course I do,” Draco muttered. He sounded tired. “Just not
“You’re not nearly as subtle as you think you are, Harry,” Sadiyah told him, sounding unnervingly like Hermione. “We
Draco collapsed onto his back with a whine. “Just take my fucking trousers off, will you?”
“Anything people want to make sure they do before we leave?” Hermione asked the group at large.
“Magic,” she said with a grin. “The cutter’s charmed.”
“It did,” Draco agreed. “I hate to admit it, because I don’t want to enable my mother’s neuroses, but she does have a knack for throwing an event.”
“What’s in it for me?” Draco asked, coy words belied by his slight breathlessness.
“Hmm?” Draco glanced up. “Oh. Checking in. But you seem cheerful enough, so I assume everything went well?” He went back to studying the pieces in front of him.
Harry’s hands clenched against Draco’s arse as he ground forward once more. “Fucking hell,” he muttered. Running his hands around and down Draco’s thighs, he dug his fingers in hard. “Wouldn’t have pegged you as the submissive type.”
“He’ll be okay,” he said. “He just…” He trailed off, as though trying to find the words. “He doesn’t have that much family,” he finally said. “And he really likes you. So he got attached quickly. But... he’ll adjust. He’ll be fine.” He paused, and then repeated it, quietly, as though to himself. “We’ll be fine.”
Turning to see what they were looking at, Harry’s eyes caught on a head of extremely familiar white-blond hair. White-blond hair that had been slicked back, not like it had been back in school, but in a way that managed to look edgy. White-blond hair that topped the head of a tall, thin man in a long leather duster, jeans, and beat up combat boots. “Oh no,” he said, eyes narrowing. “Absolutely not.”
Everything had come to a head in 2009, after Harry had been voted
Harry glanced down at himself and shrugged. The dark charcoal suit fitted him well enough, he supposed, but he felt confined and a bit itchy. Though, possibly, that was the nerves more than the suit. “It’s okay. Won’t be sad to get out of it later, though.”
“No worries. It’s nice to talk about something other than my career sometimes. It eats up enough of my attention as it is. I’m a Healer.”
Ron yawned and stretched. “Great, well, I’m taking a shower and a nap.”
Luna patted his knee comfortingly. “Would you like a cup of tea?”
“Much nicer than our last place in the woods,” Ron joked, coming up beside Harry and clapping him on the shoulder.
Sullivan nodded, looking mildly disappointed. “Yeah, okay.”
He could hear conversations happening around him as his companions wandered, opening drawers, pulling books from shelves, and taking art from the walls to look at the backs of the frames. Every so often, someone would shout in excitement as they found something that looked promising. Trying to shake off his discomfiture, Harry began searching as well, discovering a packet of Scrabble tiles inside the pot of a fake fern, followed by a pair of red-lensed glasses that he thought might be needed somewhere down the line.
recklessness—had been enough to win them the game.
Draco laughed. “Trial and error, I suppose.”
“I know, right?” Harry said, grinning. “Just wait until later. It’s horrible.”
“Don’t be difficult, Potter. It’s art, not pornography. Nudes have been one of the most prolific genres of fine art for hundreds of years.”
“How does New York sound stupid?” Draco asked in amusement.
, replied a familiar voice in a fond tone that still wasn’t.
An hour later, they were on their third cup of something that Draco found fairly odd-tasting, but not unpleasant, and Luna had somehow managed to get every detail of his burgeoning relationship with Harry—and its already-mounting obstacles—out of him.
He was distracted from his musings by a pair of long arms wrapping around him from behind and a pointy chin resting itself on his shoulder. He relaxed and leaned back into Draco’s embrace. “You’ll stay for awhile?” he asked.
Harry gave her a small smile. “Sorry, that’s just what we call children’s stories with magic in them. They aren’t about actual fairies most of the time, and as far as I know, they weren’t written by them, either. Some are still fairly gruesome, though.” He thought of the collection of Grimm’s fairytales he’d picked up to read to Teddy when he was little, only to slam it shut in horror when he’d gotten to the end of Cinderella. “Lots of mutilated body parts.”
“Yes, it should be under Malfoy.”
“Yeah, okay.”
He wasn’t terribly tall, perhaps a few inches shorter than Draco, but he had filled out significantly from the wraith of a boy he’d been at the end of the war; if pressed, Draco thought he might describe the man as ‘compactly athletic.’ His hands were stuffed sheepishly into the pockets of a pair of worn jeans that hugged his thighs in an extremely distracting manner. His thick cable-knit sweater was loose across his stomach, but clung nicely to his chest and shoulders, emphasizing their muscularity. His hair was the same disaster it had always been, and his eyes were still distressingly green behind his thin wire glasses. His apologetic smile, however, was nothing like the expressions Draco remembered having directed at him over the years.
Near them, Blaise and Pansy were deep in conversation about something, while Ginny and Draco seemed to be having some sort of very intense debate, if their flashing eyes and gesticulating hands were anything to go by. Harry watched them for a while, his chest feeling a bit tight at the way the firelight flickered across Draco’s almost-white hair and high cheekbones. It was really fucking inconvenient how beautiful he was.
Draco could barely form a coherent thought at the sudden onslaught of heat and wet and pressure, but it only lasted for a few moments before Harry pulled off and lifted Draco’s legs higher so that his knees nearly met his shoulders. Draco adjusted his grip to hold the new position, unable to do anything beyond following Harry’s whims. He peered down his torso, watching as Harry stepped back slightly to observe him.
Blaise smiled back at him. “Well. It’s been a few months since I’ve seen you, but for our audience, it was only last week that you gallantly put your own feelings aside to help Harry follow his heart. Can you share with us a bit what that felt like?”
“If you mean that I will bite if you piss me off, then yes, you are correct,” Draco answered, opening one eye and giving him an amused look.
know about that? I’d kind of hoped that the rivalries of younger students flew under the radar of the higher years.”
In the morning, after breakfast, they hugged each other goodbye and promised to get in touch once the show had wrapped and things had calmed down.
They ate and watched, making comments to each other as it went along. “Oh my god, what the hell, he looks
“I mean, not really,” Harry said, startling himself with his own surety. “He’s had my back the whole time I’ve been here. He’s done a really great job making sure I’m comfortable and managing things when they start to get out of hand.”
Harry looked down at the pristine white trainers and raised an eyebrow. “They’re… trainers. They’re supposed to get dirty. That’s what happens when you play sports.”
“Great! There’s a path to the gardens out this way.”
“Oh, yeah,” Sullivan answered. “My parents and I left when things started to get a bit out of hand. Didn’t really want to stay around if we could help it, you know?”
Perry closed his eyes again, covering his face with his hands. “I’m not going to say that this is the
“Good morning, Teddy,” he answered fondly, his voice rough with sleep. “Something you wanted?”
“No offence, but that sounds like a ‘her’ problem,” Harry replied. “I’m sorry her boss sucks, but not sorry enough to humiliate myself in front of the whole country.”
They were soon joined by the girls, followed by Draco, whom Harry had to force himself to look away from; his pale skin fairly shone against the darkening sky, and his shorts really were much shorter—and much tighter—than Harry thought was necessary. He was trying his best not to stare at Draco sliding into the water next to him when he was distracted by the sight of Blaise Zabini sauntering out the door, completely in the nude.
weirder than it needed to be.”
Draco wobbled and fell, barely catching himself on the edge of the table. “I’m sorry,
In the parlour, Draco encountered Mrs. Nott and Xenophilius Lovegood, arm in arm, along with Theo and Luna, who both seemed completely unfazed by the situation. Luna was gesturing enthusiastically while explaining something or other to Theo, who looked completely enraptured by whatever it was. Draco waved to them before wandering on. He steered clear of Augusta Longbottom, who was currently talking to his mother—the woman had, frankly, always made him incredibly nervous. Nearby, he saw an incredibly uncomfortable looking Neville Longbottom being aggressively flirted with by Cassandra Zabini. He was about to go try to redirect her attentions when he saw Blaise headed their way and sighed in relief. He had been on the other end of Cassie’s advances, and it could be quite overwhelming, especially when one was not inclined toward the female—or any, he supposed, in Neville’s case—gender.
Perry stayed silent for a moment. Then, “Was I being shitty?” he asked, quieter. “When the sprinklers went off?”
“You weren’t exactly over the moon yourself, Potter.”
He spotted him by the bar, near where Harry himself had been not too long ago. Harry approached, feeling almost shy. “Hey,” he greeted him. “Tired of dancing already?”
“Yes, I’m sure it will, once you spend the entire month planning and replanning every detail until you’ve got the whole household in tears.”
Sure enough, as the bridge came into view, Harry could see Malfoy’s white blond hair catching in the sunlight. He was leaning against the bridge’s side, looking down at the water below him. He must have felt Harry approaching, but he didn’t move, even when he stopped next to him. Harry didn’t bother to mince words, not even greeting him before asking, “Did you set off the sprinklers yesterday?”
“Draco Malfoy, you absolute bloody coward, get your arse to this bar before I show up and drag you here myself!”
“I think you’re a fucking sadist. You actually think that’s
“So, what’d you think?” he asked lightly, laughing as Draco groaned next to him.
. Who are you going to bars with that lets you pick fights with strangers?
“We actually have a surprise for you on that front,” Blaise told him, pulling a brown paper portfolio out of nowhere. “As a gift from the show and your suitors, you get to take all of their final works home!”
“Shh, don’t jinx it!”
The times in my life that I’ve known a relationship had staying power have been the ones where the mornings after were just as pleasant as the nights before. Just saying, Draco.
“Right.” Draco sighed. Four o’clock Eastern time. No wonder it felt early. As he attempted to wake up at least a little bit, he absently assessed the man standing awkwardly in his doorway. He hadn’t seen Harry Potter since he’d left for New York, and he was rather perturbed to see that the man had grown up to be incredibly fit.
Draco’s heart did something a bit funny. “I’m not sure,” he said, turning back, “but I suppose we’d best not risk it.”
“We could always wait until we get home?” Harry suggested, knowing, now, that there was no way in hell that Draco would take him up on that offer.
fault that the proprietors had chosen such a heinous set of robes to feature. Not for the first time, he wished that being advertising manager for
“Good night, Draco.” Harry stuffed his hands in his pockets, grinning giddily at Draco as he took a few backwards steps before finally turning to walk away. Draco watched him go, wondering just how badly this was going to hurt, in the end, but thinking that it would probably be worth it.
Draco shrugged unconcernedly. “It’s up to you, of course.”
The Ogden’s distillery is loosely based on a combination of the Jameson’s distillery and the Guinness brewery, which are both popular tourist attractions and therefore have exhibitions of the companies’ history which I thought were really interesting when I was in Dublin for the first time. Highly recommend if you’re ever there!
They’re
“Mmh,” Harry agreed. “Not particularly keen to kick off my return to England with another scandal, myself.” He nudged his knee against Malfoy’s. “I’d still like to see you, though. Maybe we could just… I dunno, keep it quiet? Spend a bit of time together; see if it’s worth the risk?”
“Yeah, he was. But I mean, that’s sort of his job.”
“I can imagine.” Blaise gave an obviously well-rehearsed (to Harry, anyway), genial little laugh. “Would you say that otherwise it was one of your better dates?”
“You look a bit familiar,” Harry told her as he shook her hand. “Have we met?”
Hermione took charge of the pizza cutter, carefully rolling it to slice the pie into ten even pieces.
“Cheers,” Blaise said, lifting his head from the ground just enough to take several deep gulps before collapsing once more. He had also stripped his shirt off, and Harry thought amusedly that this time it might actually be for practicality and not aesthetic. Even Ginny seemed tired, which was really quite an achievement. She was slumped on the ground with her back against the stump that Pansy had perched upon, and for once was not needling her brother or trying to get people up and moving.
From behind him, he heard Hermione sigh, “Oh, dear.”
Harry bit down on a muffled groan. “Just curious: are you actively trying to kill me?”
with Harry Potter. It was something he’d wanted since he’d been a child, but not something he’d ever thought he’d actually
Harry laughed. “Gotten a lot of ‘but where are you
“Ohhh. Yeah, there are potions that people sometimes use that are like that. They’ll get you kicked right out of whatever competition you’re in if you’re found out.”
“Mother, the jam star biscuits use the sugar dough, yes?” Draco asked as he finished rolling the dough into a perfectly even sheet.
“As long as you want me to,” Draco murmured, and Harry shivered at the caress of Draco’s breath against his ear. He turned, looping his arms around Draco’s shoulders.
Draco sighed and flopped backwards onto his bed. Maybe, by Tuesday, Potter would forget their almost-kiss?
“I guess sort of? It’s pretty strange to have technically gone out with each of these people a bunch of times but to still only know them a little bit. But I’m looking forward to it.”
“Testify?”
“Well, why not?” Draco asked, warming up to the idea. “Our relationship has been many things, Potter, but it’s certainly never been boring. And we’d make quite the picture together. It’d be fun.”
“Did they leave it the same between Leela and Sadiyah?”
“I—” His eyes traced Draco’s face—pale, furrowed brows over expressive grey eyes; high, fine cheekbones and porcelain skin, still slightly flushed; thin pink lips a worried line. Harry’s gaze lingered on them for a moment before he looked back up into Draco’s eyes. “I’m going to try something, and you’re going to tell me if it feels right to you. Okay?”
Sadiyah looked at him like he was stupid. “Not Perry, Harry. Come on.”
“Anything you like,” Harry told her. “You can just wander around with me for a bit; I tend to stop by a lot of the different stations and see what the kids are up to and if they need anything before I settle in with anyone. It’s all very casual.”
Draco glanced across the hall to where his own door stood open before raising a suggestive eyebrow at Harry. “Or you could stay for a bit.”
“Why?” Harry shook his head, attempting, in vain, to clear it enough to form more than one-syllable sentences. Was he dreaming?
Harry looked back at him over his shoulder and grinned. “Says the man wearing my bathrobe.”
He flushed at being caught out, but thankfully managed to bite back his instinctive response that there was certainly nothing that Draco needed to make excuses for. Instead, he cleared his throat. “Um, it should be fine now,” he said, chagrined at how rough his voice came out. “Sorry, I didn’t think to show you how it worked.” He stood there, dripping wet in his clothes, unsure what to do.
“What about you, Draco? Is… Max, right? Is Max coming with you?”
“But now I’m standing here, and all I can think is… ‘god, he would have
Harry let his mind wander as the minutes ticked by, the only sounds in the room those of brushes and drawing implements moving against paper and canvas. This was the last group date of the show; after this, he would be on to one-on-one dates with people. For some reason, the thought made his stomach drop a bit. It all felt more real all of a sudden. It had been easy to lose himself in the dynamic of the group, spending time with people here and there, but he hadn’t had to make any hard decisions yet. Rejecting people after really getting to know them felt more personal. And what if, when they spent more time with him, people rejected
Eventually, Harry mustered enough energy to sit up, and he and Sullivan scooted to the edge of the dock to dangle their feet in the water as the sun went down. Sullivan had once again wrapped an arm around him as though it was the most natural thing in the world, and Harry couldn’t help but lean into it. Sullivan was magnetic, he thought—kind and cheerful and easy-going—and the way his larger body fit against Harry’s made him feel safe. Plus, he was bloody gorgeous.
Harry laughed. “Fuck off.”
“Honestly,” Rose told him, laughing, “anyone who was at school with them could have seen it coming. They were so obsessed with each other that even people in different years and houses knew about it.”
enthusiastic about?”
He leaned in to kiss Harry once more. Despite their conversation, there was no urgency behind it, just enjoyment of the fact that this was something they could do now. Harry didn’t think he would ever get sick of it—Draco’s mouth against his, his tongue slipping past his lips, his teeth occasionally nipping at his bottom lip. Harry’s hand caressed up Draco’s chest, around his side, down his back, over the smooth skin of his buttocks. He hitched Draco’s leg, pulling it over his own hip so that he could tease his fingers up the long, firm thigh. Draco smiled into Harry’s mouth, pulling him closer with his foot, long fingers tracing patterns over Harry’s back and shoulders.
Harry huffed a laugh. “Absolutely not.”
Ginny had also spent a while longer trying to convince him, but to no avail. Harry did not want to gamify his love life for the entertainment of the masses, and no amount of guilt was going to change his mind.
Maybe it would be one of the rare occasions when he said yes to a few lines of cocaine, or a blunt with fuck knows what in.  It didn't really matter to him how it happened, he just wondered how and when. He could picture it already, his pale lifeless body found among the mess of sprinkles of cocaine, dirty needles and empty bottles in the clean up that always followed the morning after one of these goddamn parties.

The black skinny jeans that once hugged the mans waist comfortably now sagged and we're held up by a belt on its loop. The crumpled outfit, and a pair of nike trainers had been thrown on his feet when he left to find him six

Hermione, Ron, Pansy, Blaise, Neville, Luna, as well as majority of the Weasley's had came along to help, and though he was grateful, he was finding himself wishing they'd stayed at
He scanned the room for anything of interest when his eyes found themselves gazing upon a glorious sight.  A boy was talking to Harry’s friends, and from what he could see from the boys back profile he was glorious. He had fair hair, resting against his shoulders in loose waves, his figure petite. He looked around the same height as Harry, probably only a couple centimetres shorter than him. Distressed black skinny jeans hugged his legs, gloriously showing off his fucking gorgeous thighs, and a vintage rolling stones shirt covered his upper chest, cut off at his ribs, showing off his back and likely his midriff from the front too. He boy clearly worked out often to maintain a physique like that.
Harry imagined this was how he would die, at one of these stupid fucking parties that he didn't even like going to. Sure, he couldn't complain, it got him drunk, but he would much rather be back at his apartment, drinking until his liver gave out, alone.
The destructive pattern had left him much skinnier than before, his chiselled face now thin and hollow, his collarbones far too prominent and his ribs jutting out of his skin.
But yes, this was how Harry reckoned he would die, at one of these stupid fucking parties thrown by god knows who (if he remembers correctly, this party was actually thrown by matt, a friend of a friend). Maybe it would finally be the alcohol, he'd drink a little too much one night, and his liver would finally give out for good, or maybe it would would be a heart attack, asphyxiation when he vomited and choked on his own sick again, or anything else really.
Small, slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the side of the boat in an attempt to ease his anxiety, sending soft vibrations down the thin, metal barrier.
The search continued like this for four more days, until they caught sight of a fire, burning on a nearby island. Despite the weak protests of the others to wait for them, in case there was

He pulled it closer to his skin, wishing it was his husbands arms he was wrapped in instead of an old, oversized jumper.
"Don't you ever do that again, you asshole. I thought we lost you, I thought I'd lost you" he sobs into his shoulder, his chest heaving.
with his family after travelling abroad to visit friends.
There was a girl by his side, whispering in his ear and pushing herself as far as she possibly could up against his side, believing that she had seduced a celebrity as important and central to the media as this, just by taking off her shirt and flaunting what little breasts she had. not that her chest, or therefore lack of it, bothered him at all, though he wasn't exactly pleased considering he would much rather it be a man grinding against his hip.

"Shh, I'm okay see? It'll take more than a splinching and getting stranded to get rid of me. Lost my wand, getting up here away from whatever that thing is. I was just going to wait it out, had some food and water in my bag,

He hears a rustling nearby, and he grips his wand ready, a stupify falling from his lips as the werewolf-looking creature lunged towards him.

this wasn't the only body.
"Hey Haz, how you doing tonight man" he grinned, patting his back and offering him a hit of the blunt which was hanging loosely between his lips, to which Harry shook his head.

He would make every news station and maybe the front page of every magazine and newspaper for a couple of weeks, not that it hadn't happened before for other reasons, but god both worlds would have a field day with it.
"Oh baby, you wouldn't know the half of what to expect from me these days” Malfoy grins wickedly in response “Though I am a little tired of this party though, how about you take me to your place and we have a more private type of catch up?"
The twenty four year old was leaning against a wall in the far corner of the living room of some other famous celebrity's penthouse. Despite it being well past midnight, the party had barely started yet, but the flashing lights mixed with the intoxicants was enough to make his head spin.
"Took you bloody long enough" he groans, weakly attempting to climb down the makeshift den in the tree he was perched in.
He just wanted his family to have one moment of normality, one moment of peace and calm, was that really too much to ask? After everything they'd gone through to get here?
