“What happened?”
“I can assure you, you will be well remunerated.”
“Not even going to read it, Potter?” she smirks at him.
Harry returns a small smile.
He’s bone-tired from working too hard and fuzzy with cider, and he should go home and sleep. Potter’s stupid finger is teasing around his navel and tracing lower, dipping beneath his jeans. He’s an inferno against Draco’s back, wiry and strong. His magic, which becomes all too hauntingly familiar to Draco as each day goes by, rolls around them both.
Harry returns to the drawing room to find Ron. He and Cassie look up from their notes as Harry enters.
Harry sighs and heads after him, perhaps to apologise, he hasn’t decided yet. He finds Draco out on the pitch working on a move with Maxwell. They’re flying around obstacles set up on the ground, and Harry’s about to ask why they’re doing it down so low, when Maxwell slips from his broom and the reason becomes obvious. Draco must have charmed the grass spongy, because the young Chaser more or less bounces off one shoulder and gets back to his feet.
Harry feels bile rise in his throat.
“Of course, there’s no
Probably.
“I borrowed a lot of money, Harry,” Balham finally says, quietly, so that Harry has to lean forward to hear clearly. “And I thought I’d have been able to pay it back by now.”
thought so a little later in the alley out the back.
“Do you have a time of death?” Harry asks.
idea Harry had been spending time here at the cottage, he might have been better prepared.
“Well—!”
“That’s it?” Hermione looks outraged. “No explanation at all?”
Malfoy looks down at his lap.
“Cambie attended on Madame Narcissa at bedtime,” she says. “On the night that… the night that…”
So he has the Manor to himself for the moment, but he hates it. The halls feel lonely and echoing, and he decides to find the volumes he needs on the role of love in spell and curse casting and take them home to his flat.
“We did it,” Harry murmurs, unwilling to let Malfoy go. He leans in again, but is stopped by a palm soft against his chest.
It’s ridiculous, really. Malfoy isn’t going to be waiting for a coffee in Diagon Alley. He’d be hounded out by upstanding wizards, and that’s the least he deserves.
“Everything okay?” he asks, putting his notes aside and arching an eyebrow at Harry.
“Thank you for your time, Healer Danforth. I’m signing Harry Potter out of your care, against medical advice.”
“Why were you at the cottage?” Granger asks.
Draco flicks his wand at the present, vanishing the bag altogether.
Draco nods. “He’s turning ten. She wants to make it a whole thing.”
Malfoy’s first practice with the Arrows goes about as well as Harry expects.
Another hour and they’re ready to start practicing, pushing back the furniture to create space and drilling each other over and over again. By the time dinner rolls around, they each have the changes to their spells mastered and they’re all exhausted.
Ordinarily, Harry would be annoyed to find Hermione so predictably stuck on the point she’s been trying to make all weekend, but given the circumstances, he can’t really fault her.
Hermione is speechless. Luna’s confidence in them all in spite of themselves is always disarming.
So Harry repeats his version of events, this time including the mysterious glimpse of Parkinson in the East Wing.
“From who?”
Hermione looks offended. “Don’t be so condescending. Just because —”
"I don't think of you that way," Harry insists, and realises he means it.
“And all I had to do was get them to win a few games under new rules that I was uniquely qualified to coach, and that would be that. Feted and admired by English fans, I’d be able to come home. It was exactly what I wanted. So you can imagine my absolute horror when I got there and discovered who the existing coach was.”
“I don’t
It’s a lot, to be here in this house. To see Andromeda up close. He reaches past her to snag an apple out of a bowl on the table, needing a distraction. She raps his wrist fondly. “Let me get you something more substantial than that to eat. Are you staying?”
“It’s too generous,” Andromeda chides, but Draco just shrugs.
There’s a beat, just a flicker of something that crosses Potter’s face.
Hermione doesn’t answer; she steps up to the door.
Draco lets the last of his anger dissipate, Teddy’s good humour forcing a smile out of him. Then he catches sight of Potter, who is still standing frozen, his mouth is hanging open.
Harry glances at Ron, who is trying to school his face into a neutral expression, and Harry knows for certain without even asking that not one of them is showing a rune. It’s a crushing feeling that leaves him short of breath. To have spent so much time over the last few weeks with these people, day in and day out, thinking he was doing the right thing and have it turn out to have all been manipulated. Nothing but lies.
“Details,” Harry waves away the objection. “If you think someone has poisoned or cursed your mother, Malfoy, I want to help.”
“Behave, for even five minutes,” she mutters.
He can picture Ron clearly though, slumped on one of the chairs. Talking. To Harry, or maybe just to himself. “I had no idea. I knew she wasn’t as happy as she could have been, but I had no bloody idea.”
“Yes. No. I don’t know actually. This is what I saw, but Dumbledore seemed surprised when I told him that, so maybe he was somewhere else.”
The door to the office is standing open, and when Harry steps inside he has more questions than answers. Malfoy’s been back two weeks and it still looks like he’s barely set foot in this room, even though Harry knows he works long hours and is here all the time. Someone has brought in a filing cabinet, but other than that the bleak space remains unchanged. There isn’t even a chair on this side of the desk, as if Malfoy never has—or perhaps never
“Neither of them would usually care,” Draco muses with a frown. “And that’s more of an… intimate spell.”
“Nothing, really,” he demurs. “Once I’d worked out how to make it possible for the magic to bind equally between a pureblood wizard and a Muggle-born, it was relatively straightforward.”
“Salazar, it is you!” she exclaims, waving him in. “One of the Healers said that Harry Potter had been visiting me every day, and I thought she was pulling my leg.”
and flicking through the pages. Harry feels his face flush to the roots of his hair as he snatches it back off him, tucking it in the bottom of Seamus’ trunk and steadfastly not looking at the writhing male torsos on the cover. Draco laughs. “No need to be such a prude.”
“Well, what did you expect, Harry? Them to just sit there placidly and wait to be eaten?”
see is an abandoned bit of land beside a council estate. It looks like it had playground equipment on it once, but now it’s overgrown, littered with rubbish, and best avoided. There’s nothing to reveal the soaring wooden Quidditch stands just metres away.
“I could use
Harry’s mouth is still a thin, disapproving line. As if just the idea of pureblood
Harry is suddenly, viscerally aware of how close they are. His wand is still loose in his hand. Part of him wants to press it to the pale skin of Malfoy’s throat to support his threat. A smaller, more traitorous part of him wants to mark that same skin with his teeth. He glances up to find Malfoy breathing just as heavily, staring at Harry’s mouth.
“It doesn’t matter,” he manages, taking a large sip of wine, the rosé sharp and floral on his tongue. “I’m almost there. I’m going to have the rings stabilised in a few days, and he’ll be on a Portkey home straight after.”
And then later in the week, he can’t work out why the Beaters keep overshooting the charmed training Bludgers, until Morgan admits that Harry has them flying too slow.
They spend a half hour flying low to the ground, at Teddy’s height. The training Snitch is charmed to follow slow patterns to make it possible for a child to predict where it might go and chase it down. They both do a passable job of pretending that they have no idea where it might head next, narrowly missing it on several occasions so that Teddy can snatch it triumphantly out of the air. To Draco’s surprise, Potter turns out to be a patient, encouraging teacher, gently correcting Teddy’s technique and showing him new things to try that improve his stability and centre of gravity. When the score is five-nil, Teddy pulls up and lands.
, Harry thinks. He can’t understand why Hermione is being stubborn, particularly in the wake of very nearly losing Ron.
“Well, we have to get up that high either way.”
“None this week,” he’s forced to admit, thinking back to Malfoy’s pale, frozen expression. He snaps himself out of it and tries to think of a child-friendly story Teddy will enjoy. “But
“No change. Draco won’t tell me anything, obviously. But he doesn’t appear to be very optimistic.”
“It’s one of the things I asked Draco to consider for the grants,” she continues, ignoring the way Ron is fidgeting in disbelief beside her. “Muggle techniques for dealing with depression and PTSD. I think we could learn a lot.”
“I’ll go to see Kingsley on Monday morning,” Ron offers. “He’ll have Aurors he trusts and we can double-check they weren’t involved before lining them up to make the arrests.”
Harry shifts, looking away as he nods again. He’s always been a terrible liar.
Maybe he’ll leave that one to her.
“I got you a gift,” he says, suddenly uncertain. The gesture feels a bit much, but he’d seen it and known exactly what he wanted to do and it’s only now—faced with Draco real and vivid and in person—that he’s second-guessing himself.
A flicker of something passes across Hermione’s face. Harry tries to understand what is going on.
“Eggs if you want them,” Harry says, pointing at a laden plate under a warming charm. The scrambled eggs look fluffy and light, and there’s a pile of golden toasted sourdough that Draco’s pretty sure wasn’t even in his pantry.
Draco realises he was expecting to drop into the midst of a nightmare. To find Potter battling an Acromantula or running from Inferi. He’s confused to find him just sitting under a tree, relaxed and happy. Something about this doesn’t add up.
“And you,” Draco turns on his former teammate, who manages to stop laughing but is still smiling. “You need to go home. You know you don’t do relationships, and you’re only sticking around here because you think Luna’s lovely and you don’t want to break her heart by telling her as much.” Leila opens her mouth as if to object, but then closes it again and ducks her head with a smile.
“Just a day or two, at most. I’m at the Leaky,” he manages, around a mouthful of crisp apple. “Something with Gringotts.”
Harry sputters in indignation. Parkinson seems not to notice.
The Aurors bundle Dawlish and the others inside the house, and a few moments later Ron emerges and passes a piece of parchment to Kingsley. The Minister lifts his wand and with a few careful movements, casts up toward the sky over the centre of the garden. A shower of blue sparks explodes from the tip of his wand, showering down over everyone like rain. Harry feels them, warm and tingling against his skin, and then he blinks slowly, as if waking from an intense dream.
“But, I’m pretty sure—”
“It’s okay, we’ll fix it,” Luna murmurs, looking sadly at the ornament and patting the young Trainee on the back.
“No. Thank you.”
Then two.
Draco looks back at the photo in surprise. It’s still a picture of Potter, waving, but his arm’s around the waist of an equally indistinct wizard.
“I see.” Malfoy offers nothing further, waiting. It makes Harry squirm.
Merry Christmas to those who celebrate, and to those who don't I hope you have a wonderful and peaceful holiday. Come hang out on
As he pads back around the corner at the top of the staircase, Harry has the sudden feeling that someone is behind him, maybe coming from the direction of the noise he heard earlier. He whirls on his heels in time to see Parkinson, clad in a bright green silk robe, emerge from Ron’s room and disappear around a corner at the far end of the hall.
like you think it is appropriate to speak back to me in my own home. I’ve given my life in service of upholding the purest traditions of our history. And what have you done, exactly? Catch a sword when it flew your way?!”
“Why are you flying in an open V instead of an arrowhead?”
“You don’t know her last name.”
“We can’t
As he outlines his plan, Harry finds himself distracted by the long lock of blond hair that falls over his forehead. Malfoy’s haircut is so much more severe than the way he wore it at school, and yet without all the potions in it, it seems so much softer.
Hermione exhales heavily. “Harry, you’re allowed to come out however you like, to whomever you like, whenever you like. You know I believe that.”
Draco looks over at him, standing with his hands shoved deep in his jean pockets. He’s smiling. He doesn’t seem offended. But it
He finds himself turning to give instructions to a player only to find them at the other end of the ruddy pitch. He suggests combinations that no longer work because the corresponding players are yards ahead or above or below where he expects them to be.
Harry stares in shock at the alcove off the kitchen where they normally squeeze around a little square table designed for four with Hugo’s highchair perched on the corner. Now it’s an actual, functioning dining room, stretching out in front of him into wizarding space, with a table that could easily seat a dozen people.
“It isn’t the first time,” Harry finds himself saying.
The master bedroom is spacious. A plain oak bed frame sits in the centre, and skylights in the roof overhead make Harry imagine lying here and being able to look up at the stars. While he’s watching, the room seems to give a pleased sort of hum and the paint on the walls turns a restful shade of soft grey.
, Harry thinks again.
“And don’t even think about dressing yourself,” she snaps at him through the Floo. “I’m sending over your clothes.”
They eat the sandwiches in front of Harry’s television. Draco apparently got used to the Muggle technology in France but doesn’t have one in the Manor, so he’s content to tuck his socked feet under Harry’s leg while they watch a movie.
” under her breath.
. How does anyone still even
“You’re not trying to take that all through the Floo.” Draco stares at Teddy in horror, pointing at a growing pile of toy dinosaurs, a trainee broom, and a stack of comic books that comes up to his knee. Both his bedroom at home and his one at Draco’s are practically full to overflowing, and yet the boy seems to persist in always wanting something that’s at the other house. One day, Draco’s going to build him his own vanishing cabinet so he can just dumbwaiter the stuff back and forth.
Gradually Draco gets used to the idea that his sanctuary seems to have been permanently invaded by this bizarre alternate universe Handyman Potter, who crunches around the gravel paths peppering Jack with questions. He wears worn-looking clothes, but a new pair of workboots, and has started keeping his too-long hair out of his face with a baseball cap.
Banny gives a brief nod.
“Well, I can try… from what Draco has said, it traces back to the eighteenth century,” Luna says. “The rule in the Malfoy family, as with almost all pure-blood families, was
“Close your mouth, Potter, you’ll catch Doxies.”
Potter’s hair is still all over the place, but it manages to somehow look deliberate now, or at least as if fashion has caught up with him. And vice versa, it seems, if the thick cashmere pea coat and smart leather shoes are anything to go by. Draco always judges a person first by their shoes. He is, however, wearing a mismatched pair of socks.
, going to ignore the invitation, so it’s a formality more than anything. But there are so many others who he thinks about. Who he owes, not that a bloody dinner does anything to fix that. But what does anything he’s been doing at the Farm matter, really, if he can’t make it up to the people he hurt.
rush to confess to your friends about our late night activities as soon as they opened their investigation?” Draco gives him a mean-spirited glare. He knows for a fact that Harry had kept it to himself until Parkinson had dobbed them in.
Draco takes a shuddering inhale, and then shoves gently at Harry’s arms. “Get off me, you great pillock,” he murmurs gently, and Harry rocks back on his heels, giving him space.
Suddenly, a set of doors at the far end of the drawing room swing open and Malfoy ushers Luna into the room, his hand at the small of her back.
Harry startles, glancing at his watch.
Malfoy picks up the gloves and slides his hand into one. “My size,” he notes, flexing his fingers. “Not that that tells us anything. Beautiful quality. Maybe they were a gift?”
Harry gives her the basics, glossing over the parts about how it’s more or less completely uninhabitable and focussing instead on the mystery he’s tasked Malfoy to solve. It’s just enough of a distraction that she doesn’t ask him anything about his Christmas hosting plans, and instead keeps chattering away about ancient festival magic as she fetches him mixing bowls and spoons, and a stool for his quickly self-appointed sous chef Rose to stand on.
Harry waits for the team to dismount below before he descends, self-conscious about how off his balance feels today. It’s just the cold weather, he figures, ignoring a nagging sense of dread. His hip will adjust.
Granger and Lovegood have their patient propped up on a raft of pillows and are buttoning him into a clean pyjama jacket. Potter looks terrible — twitching and sallow.
Neville snaps his fingers, dropping the icepack in his lap. “There will be dried catildeweed in the kitchens, though! The house-elves used it for making that weird jam McGonagall always liked. I used to help Sprout pick it for them.”
. There is no
“Get up, you great Dugbog,” Ginny laughs, jabbing at his ribs where they’re hidden under the covers with unerring accuracy.
Malfoy slumps back in his chair in disbelief.
Harry gives a slightly strangled noise of objection and tries to pull him close again.
Hermione assures him that won’t be necessary, and heads out into the house with Gibbens on her heels.
“But what do you get out of it?” Ginny blurts out, breaking the silence bluntly.
“Could you spare him?” he hears Neville asking.
Later, Harry carries yet another platter of leftovers into the kitchen, trying to find an unoccupied spot of expanded bench space to slip it onto. He notices an extra place setting, unused, cloth napkin still tucked in its shiny ring.
The new concession stand is a gleaming overindulgence that stocks Arrows-branded merchandise no one buys and snacks that all taste like apples. Harry could have done without knowing what apple-flavoured hotdogs taste like, to be honest. Even old Jim Cranswick couldn’t find anything good to say about those.
“Harry!!”
Luna’s store is an absolute mystery to Harry. It glows like a calm oasis in the section of Diagon rebuilt after the War. Where the original buildings all have cramped lead-light windows reflecting the age in which they were built, Luna’s store is fronted with enormous plate glass, and the sign over the door reads “loop” in modern lettering. Inside, it always smells like fresh sheets, and the wide shelves have a sparse array of extremely expensive things that Harry can never understand. Tiny potion bottles promising Nargle-free sleep. Bunches of dried flowers and sage tied together with poems. Luna’s signature radish earrings.
. The children behind him start to fidget.
Harry waits for a second, impatient. When Malfoy doesn’t make a move, he pushes past him, reaching for the door. Malfoy grabs him by the arm with surprising force, spinning him off balance and shoving him roughly against the stone wall of the corridor. For someone so thin, he’s strong, holding Harry in place with his forearm.
“Not at the moment, it’s not,” Malfoy repeats. “And trust me when I say your colleagues don’t share your enthusiasm.”
foul-tempered?”
Harry looks at him in confusion, feeling suddenly uneasy. “I think you’ve mixed me up with someone else.”
“You misunderstand me, Mr Nightingale. These are not the Arrows’ results. These are the aggregate numbers for the League as a whole.”
Harry takes a couple of red apples and gets ready.
He lands on, “Nothing pertinent to your investigation.” It doesn’t seem to console Ron.
“Because I don’t know who I am if I’m not this,” he shrugs, finishing the water in a long swallow and putting the bottle aside. He immediately regrets it, wanting something to do with his hands.
Potter nods, distracted, still watching Teddy. “Nev wants me to go, give a speech, whatever.”
“Not a murderer then, old boy,” Zabini drawls, giving them both a smug grin. “That seems like good news.”
“Did someone …” he starts to ask, but Draco cuts him off, pointing at an empty plate on the sideboard. The first week he was here there were
Harry turns to find Pansy Parkinson, stacking still more shopping bags beside her stool and ordering a glass of red wine.
"Surely as Saviour of the Wizarding World and five-times Witch Weekly Bachelor of the Year you can light up a room wherever you go?" Malfoy gives him a wry smile, and Harry’s too startled by the joke to attempt any kind of a witty comeback.
She looks confused, and stubborn, crossing her arms over her unkempt robes.  “I don’t see that that is…”
Harry swallows guiltily, wondering how long Malfoy has been aware he was lurking there in the door like a creeper.
Harry left it to the adults to sort out while he led another round of skirmishes in Yorkshire, helping a small group of Squibs to safety, and returned to the middle of a blazing row about whether or not the only effective way to be sure that a Malfoy was truly a turncoat would involve a lot of
“I’m going to try the office again,” Cassie says. “Maybe MacArthur has finally deigned to turn up for holiday cover.”  She leaves them to it, closing the door to the study behind her.
“What a brilliant surprise!” Harry exclaims. “What’s going on?”
at the Department briefing. Even more so because he came home from St Mungo’s yesterday to discover that, now it’s officially December, Kreacher has begun preparing the house for Christmas.
, he’s coming to understand, the ruptures in the magic itself, have been caused by the
? The
Draco suddenly wants Teddy to hurry up, so he can extract himself from this whole situation. “I’ve looked at the rings,” he says, trying to shift the conversation to a more professional footing. “They’re in bad shape, but I have some ideas.”
“Well,” he says to Rose, defeated. “Shall we see what Kreacher’s made for breakfast?”
As if it can hear him, the calendar gives a sputtering, weak glow to the twelfth door, not nearly as bright as the others. Harry sighs. Door thirteen has children making popcorn strings behind it. Fourteen is a group of carollers on a doorstep; fifteen has a couple building a snowman together.
“Still, Harry?” Ginny laughs, and Harry feels his face flush red.
In reality, it feels almost impossible.
Hermione lifts Hugo off Harry’s lap as he starts to grizzle, giving him a slice of peach to quiet him. She looks at Harry quizzically, as if she’s waiting for the rest of the question.
“You wrote to Neville. You even wrote to Hermione.”
friend, not Draco’s. He’ll talk to her whenever he damn well pleases, about anything he likes, and certainly not because Draco tells him to. He knows he’s being childish, but he feels suddenly exposed. He doesn’t want Draco paying any attention to the way he can’t fly.
Both Teddy and Rose seem completely enamoured with Harry now, particularly when he uncovers an old motorcycle that belonged to Sirius Black in a garden shed at Grimmauld and announces that he and the kids are going to fix it.
Malfoy’s gaze narrows. “The day of the Battle? Or before that?” His tone is arch, as if he’s spoiling for a fight.
“You’re the one who just threw me into a fucking wall,” Malfoy sneers back. “I think you’re the one who should be offering explanations.”
The grand opening of the Hogsmeade Magical Integration School is held in the second week of September. Harry decided to wait the extra few days so that the Hogwarts term had started properly and both Minerva and Neville could make time to attend.
He jogs off down the tunnel, leaving Harry frozen in place.
Robert’s seen loads of pictures of Hogwarts, of course, in his textbooks and in the portraits that are up all around the school in Cornwall. He feels like he could close his eyes and draw a pretty good approximation of the towers and spires just from memory. He thinks about the giant painting that hangs in the dining hall at Canonbury, with the sun sparkling off the lake and lazy drifts of white clouds floating past. Tiny Quidditch players flying on a pitch in the foreground. It always seemed like something out of the good kind of fairy tale.
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” Harry shouts, rage flooding his bloodstream, causing his fingers to twitch and want to reach for his wand. “
Whatever the Room of Requirement has done, this is definitely not the place they want to start casting ritual magic.
Harry retreats back into his tent, showering quickly, his mind more alert now as he runs over their plans for the day. Hermione decided their most likely point of entry would be the boathouse, where as first years they’d come into the castle under the cliffs for the first time, wide-eyed and wondering.
“He’s family, Potter. I don’t have a lot of that left.”
sit alongside wizarding titles like
Zabini roars with laughter. “Too slow, old man!” he yelps, tearing away after the magical beast.
She gives him a strange look. “Harry, Draco is as gay as a maypole.”
He’s about to ask the others where he’s gone when he hears a noise from the entrance to the dorms and goes to investigate.
last saw Malfoy, and it’s making his blood boil. He shoves back his chair a little, unsure of whether he wants to confront him immediately, or just extricate himself from this situation altogether. Malfoy catches his eye and frowns, giving an almost imperceptible shake of his head.
“The bad news is the memory modification is irreversible.”
Finally, after almost a week, Harry comes out of his bedroom to a cheery, “Hello!” from his grandfather.
The room Harry’s been given is opulent and well-appointed, with a gleaming tiled ensuite and overstuffed armchairs by the fireplace. He toys with the idea of just having a hot shower, putting on his pyjamas, and getting into bed. But he knows Hermione will be up and banging on his door before he can even drift off, so instead he decides to just get whatever this hellishness is over with. Quickly: like ripping off a plaster. He’ll be damned if he’s going to dress up for it though, and goes downstairs in the shirt and trousers he’s been wearing all day.
Harry scowls at him, but it lacks any venom. He’s bone-tired, four years deep in a war he can’t seem to win, leading a meagre resistance against Voldemort’s overwhelming forces, the voices of the lost keeping him awake at night. Too fucking tired, in any event, to think of what bloody charm would nail a floorboard back into place.
When he lies down beside Potter, he doesn’t bother with the careful space. His arm lies alongside Potter’s own, and he can feel the heat of his fever even through two layers of clothing.
Harry was aghast, but Malfoy didn’t even look in his direction as he left, and Harry felt like it was probably a bit much to suggest he’d missed a curse twice in one day so he let him go.
He grabs a torch off the wall and storms through the portrait hole out into the dark of the corridor. The fury continues to surge through his body as he strides away from the common room. He wants very badly to hit something, but settles for finding the steps up to the Astronomy Tower, working out his frustration hurling bits of broken wood and stone out of his way. He’s longing for the feel of fresh air on his face, for some confirmation that the outside world even still exists. But all he finds at the top of the staircase are more blank, featureless walls. The Tower’s as closed in as every other part of the castle.
For some reason it hadn’t occurred to him that Potter would be here. A warm and hazy feeling passes over Draco at the sight of him, a rare combination of a very vivid memory of Potter’s tongue against his skin the night before mixing with a full day spent in a vault surrounded by traces of his parents’ magic. It wraps around him like an embrace, and he orders a cold cider instead of Madame Rosmerta’s mulled mead to try and keep it at bay.
Harry wakes feeling cold, even covered with an extra duvet he managed to drag out of the closet some time during the night. He’d woken in the dark with toes that had turned to ice cubes. He’d swear a window was open somewhere, but he checks and the house is sealed up tight. It’s as if Grimmauld Place has just fully let winter seep into the walls themselves. Kreacher enjoys his semi-retirement at Hogwarts during the week, returning only to make a perfunctory attempt at dusting on the weekends, so he’s not even around to ask. Harry figures he needs to make the effort to light the fireplaces in the various other, unused rooms more, but after Monday’s disaster, he probably needs some professional help with that.
“Did you see anyone else?”
Draco tries to encourage them to sit down, pulling up extra chairs from the opposite end of the room, but neither wants to. Cambie shifts her weight anxiously from foot to foot.
“But—”
, and
“Let’s hope the tapestry still works.”
So his techniques are more refined now. He has centring rituals and focussing spells. He no longer lumbers into someone’s mind like an unwelcome intruder, but slips in stealthily and without disruption. He’s able to take stock of what his patient is seeing and experiencing before deciding how to proceed. And yet even with all his years of experience, it’s still a shock to see Potter — as young as he was when Draco first met him — sitting under a tree.
“I don’t care who you’ve slept with, Malfoy,” Harry mumbles, which might be one of the more outrageous lies he’s ever told. It’s not that he’s envious, exactly. Or rather, he
“I can show you how to do fast turns,” Teddy mumbles. “Draco taught me.”
“I think the hard part is over,” Luna says serenely. “Now we can just focus on the team we have left and playing the best season we can.” Neville gives her a winning smile.
Draco laughs. “Nothing, calm down. I just…when I turned up here I thought you were this washed-up failure coaching a losing team because you didn’t know what else to do with your life once no one needed you to save the world anymore. It’s nice to see I was wrong.”
“What is it?” Luna asks, and Harry realises he’s stopped mid-sentence and is a bit frozen by the sight of Malfoy in
He gets out of bed and crosses the room quickly to Hermione, who is studying the sleeve of her own pyjama jacket with interest.
“Sleep well, Harry. If you’re up early enough you might get to open one of the Advent calendar doors.”
Harry closes his mouth. He’d thought he’d be able to persuade Malfoy to help based solely on the interesting challenge of an ice rink in his hallway and hadn’t really anticipated just how big a hole he’d dug for himself the day before. Plus, Malfoy somehow manages to deliver his dressing-down without raising his voice or getting so much as a single hair out of place, which Harry thinks is wildly unfair, because he can’t match wits with anyone who looks the way Malfoy does without being hopelessly distracted. He suspects even if he challenged him to something he’s good at, like duelling, he’d wind up disarmed with a bloody trip jinx because he’d be too busy thinking about how Malfoy manages to get his shirts so well-tailored and why he always smells like cedar and sunlight—a fate that definitely never befell him when they fought at school.
“Dinner is very formal, Master Harry,” she had said firmly, when he suggested that as long as he changed out of the dirty jeans he’d gone hunting in, he’d be fine. “Master Malfoy Senior will not allow informality at his table. Not on this auspicious occasion.” She trips a little over the word
What a confusing thought. Draco Malfoy, a French-trained Healer. On his way here.
The tree on the label is strung with brightly-coloured lights and looks warm and inviting.
“Just hear him out, Draco,” she says, taking a scone off his plate and ignoring his scowl altogether.
“Two drinks, and two circuits of the party?” he bargains, and Draco nods, clinking his glass against Harry’s before disappearing into the crowd.
It’s only as he’s falling asleep on his sofa that he remembers the lamps at Potter Cottage. The ones that were still lit when he left. He should make a note about it, to return and spell them off, but he’s too drunk and too tired, and his eyes are closed before he can finish the thought.
“I thought you’d be pleased,” he says, confused, after skimming the article. “It says here the viewing and attendance figures are up. Isn’t that what we’re after?”
“Really? And have you told him that? Or do you just go home and enjoy
Harry narrows his eyes at her. So far she’s given nothing of her own opinion away, but at this she cracks a little.
“Managing to stay on your feet, Potter?” a voice asks beside him.
Draco feels like the bed is shifting underneath him, and he can’t tell if it’s the after-effects of the dream or the incomprehensible words coming out of Granger’s mouth.
Harry is horrified. He can’t think of a single time that Ginny had tried to talk to him about what Voldemort had put them through. Had she been looking for empathy or understanding from him and he’d been incapable of offering it? “But it’s something we
They slide down the hill twice more, toppling on the third attempt into a laughing heap in the snow. When they get back to Grimmauld Place, the twenty-first door is brightly lit.
“Harry’s right, you know,” Luna says. “You’re not the same person you were then. None of us are.”
“Incredible,” he agrees. “It’s hard to believe just how good they are.”
Still, he can’t hold it against the little elf for long, because the Grimmauld kitchen is absolutely laden with preparations for Wednesday. Christmas cakes sit wrapped on a shelf side-by-side with bowls of stuffing under preserving charms. A dressed turkey takes up most of the space in the fridge and there are crates of peeled vegetables in the pantry.
Oliver slams his locker door closed with a ringing clang, glaring at Harry. The rest of the team freeze in shocked silence.
you….” He runs out of words. The entire situation is too weird.
“We need to clear out the air in that room.” Harry tries to think. “There aren’t many places for it to go.”
“I …”
“Thanks,” he manages, accepting the drink Potter passes over. He makes space for Draco to join him at the bar, the warm line of his body pressed against Draco’s side. It’s doing absolutely nothing for Draco’s equilibrium.
Ron looks a little sheepish, even as he scrunches another
“What do you mean you’re
Harry hears the insult for exactly what it is. He takes a deep, steadying breath.
Hermione rolls her eyes, screwing up her napkin and stuffing it in her now empty coffee cup. “You can’t. You’re suspended.”
Elsa’s teasing is good-natured, but it makes Harry uncomfortable. The truth is he
He turns on Hermione and it takes every ounce of willpower not to draw his wand. “
Harry is unable to absorb half of what she is saying, but he catches onto that last remark and clings to it like a drowning man, able to grasp this one thing at least. He remembers back to that night, remembers tossing and turning himself, and the way he too had been unable to stop hearing Lucius’ ugly diatribe long after it was over.
Prompt Twenty One:
“What, because you’re banging a Slytherin, you assume I am too, is that it?” Ron seems incredulous now, on the verge of being annoyed. Harry can’t understand why he’s being so defensive.
“Leila  gave it to me,” Harry says, and it comes out a little more defensive than he intended. The wand holster is a work of art. Supple Moroccan leather with runic designs and tiny wands and Snitches stitched into the bands.
The Portkey Station is right in the centre of the wizarding district, just off the Old Town Square. It’s crowded and noisy and much colder than Harry was expecting, even given Malfoy’s warning. He tugs his scarf tighter around his neck. Malfoy strides off into the throng of people, apparently just expecting the team to follow behind him like obedient little ducklings. Harry rolls his eyes and brings up the rear.
Draco laughs, his tears falling freely now.
“You’ve been in New York for ten years, Potter. I’m sure you could have frequented the same bar long enough for them to let up a cheer when you arrive.”
“Is it true, then?” Hermione asks softly. “About you and Draco.”
“This was supposed to build the team up,” Harry hisses at Malfoy, who is leaning nonchalantly against a hoop, face half-buried against the cold in a thick green roll-neck sweater. He watches the Arrows circle each other in confusion, helpless as Leila tosses the Quaffle cleanly through the unguarded hoop to score. “It wasn’t supposed to

noxious gas.”
The group is sombre and careful in their preparations, each donning transfigured wetsuits wrapped in as many heating charms as they can think of. They have no way of knowing if the magic will hold, or if the castle will turn on them, but it should buy them some time.
“Or?” Wood prompts finally.
Ron has quite a blaze going in the firepit. It’s going to take ages to die down enough to cook on without magic. Draco’s about to open his mouth and tell him as much when he realises what Ron is
fun things.”
“You were asking me about entails this morning,” she points her fork accusingly at Harry. “What is it? Did Draco kill him for this dreadful house? For money?”
The team looks to Harry for explanations, which he doesn’t really have. It made sense, last night in the fading light in his office, when Malfoy suggested they take the team to Prague and show them his old squad in play. It seemed like a good idea, that they should spend some time together, all of them out of their usual routines, working out the places where Harry and Malfoy’s coaching styles worked well together and where they clashed horribly. To try and chart a path forward. But now, in the cold morning and with Malfoy suddenly nowhere to be seen, it’s harder to remember why he agreed.
Malfoy and Harry return their young charges to their respective homes and head back to Grimmauld Place. To Harry’s delight and relief, the doors for all the days are now lit except one. More than that, the house feels incredible. Warm aromas float up from the kitchen, and decorative lanterns have appeared on the hall table. The sofa has a Christmas-themed throw rug Harry’s never seen before tossed over the back, and several cute reindeer-trimmed cushions. And there, above the doorway in the sitting room, tied with a red ribbon, is a bunch of mistletoe.
“Oh, Harry!” Andromeda’s voice comes up from the kitchen below, and he bounds down the stairs to meet her, sweeping her up in a hug. When he pulls back, hands on her shoulders, her eyes are bright with joy, showing the tiny crow’s feet that are the only real sign ten years have passed. Fire-calls don’t give so much detail away. “What are you doing here? Why didn’t you say you were coming?”
Harry lets his shields drop and sinks to the floor with a groan. Malfoy, opposite, tosses his apple up and catches it, studying it before taking a bite. “Not quite what I imagined when you extended the invitation, Granger,” he muses after a minute. “Fighting a kitchen armed with fruit.”
Luna is the only one in the common room when he comes downstairs, sitting in front of the empty fireplace with a mug of tea.
The memories of Malfoy that Harry’s been keeping firmly locked up keep pushing their way forward. A country inn in the Lake District with a bed barely big enough for the pair of them. A Muggle members’ only club in Soho with a ridiculous faux bearskin rug on the floor. Memorably, once, the gleaming tiled bathrooms on the second floor of the Wizengamot. He forces the thoughts back as he takes the stairs up to the East Wing two at a time.
“When my father was Kissed, the magic in my mother’s ring became unstable.”
“Back to the fling part of this story,” Elsa interrupts, abruptly changing course when she sees the half-angry, half-pained look on Harry's face. “Or not. So, Neville. Herbology, huh? What could we get the kids working with here that won’t bite their fingers or escape the school grounds?”
Hermione’s reaction is perfectly understandable. Of

“I have some Ogden’s somewhere,” Harry says, racking his brains for a way to get them a nightcap without summoning Kreacher.
Granger sucks in a breath.
In August, they took Teddy to Ollivanders to get his wand, and ever since he’s been practicing a basic colour-changing charm that turns all the bedding in his room to whichever house he decides is his favourite at the time. It makes Draco think about his own narrow-minded upbringing. The idea of sorting anything other than Slytherin would have been completely unacceptable. Harry shocked them both one night by telling them he was almost a Hatstall. The idea that

Harry echoes her incredulity. “Luna, he was vicious and destructive. We were all there last night. I don’t think

me,” Teddy yelps, but he has a smile on his face.
“Nice to see you too, Parkinson,” Harry sighs, waving his wand to clean up the mess. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”
Malfoy, though, doesn’t seem ready to enjoy the joke. He gives Harry a puzzled glance. “When would you imagine we’d have done that? Before or after I became an exile? Have you seen the rest of our classmates recently? Because I certainly haven’t.”
?! What’s
“Oh!” Harry laughs in sudden understanding, reaching into his satchel and passing over the novel. “You mentioned it the other day, and I’ve never read it through, so I thought—”
“I can’t think of anything worse than working for you, and I died once, so that’s saying something.”
They walk slowly back to the West Wing, past Narcissa’s rooms, and Draco opens the doors to his own. Harry’s first impression is of cool and quiet. The ceilings are high, floor stripped, French doors on the other side of the room thrown open to the night. There’s minimal furniture: a simple iron-framed bed and a sofa in emerald green velvet, curved in front of the marble fireplace. Black and white photographs adorn the walls, each designed, Harry realises, to capture a moment: the roll of a wave into shore, the movement of a shadow across a door frame.
Hermione sucks in a gasp. Zabini knocks over the milk jug he’d been reaching for. No one seems to know what to say, least of all Malfoy, who gapes at his mother. Bulstrode pats at the spilled milk with a wadded up napkin while everyone else stares.
He looks down at what he’s been drawing and starts. It’s a snake wrapped around a cup. The image is weirdly familiar, like he’s seen it somewhere recently, but he can’t think where.
Harry feels like bursting into a round of applause, but the other Curse Breakers simply move forward carefully, casting a full suite of diagnostic spells to be sure.
Hugo mouths happily at some dried apple treats Harry found in the concession stand downstairs, and Rose bores of the game quickly and starts working on a colouring-in book on the ground behind them. Ron, on the other hand—Ron is transfixed.
Actual Malfoy is staring at him, hand out for the scarf Harry’s holding. He passes it over quickly, and assures Malfoy he’s fine.
The office door clangs open and a parade of levitating shopping bags come floating through it, bulging with boxes and bright tubes of wrapping paper. When Hermione catches sight of Harry she startles, losing control of the spell. The bags slump to the floor in a noisy crash.
“And?”
Someone comes alongside him, fighting a lethal-looking sabre, spells clashing noisily off its blade. He feels the touch of Malfoy’s magic, boosting his shield the way Harry had done the day before. Harry is momentarily impressed that he’d been able to work out how to do it — combining magic is complicated — before the broadsword takes another vicious little feint and stab at him and he has to concentrate harder.
“James was my father. I’m Harry.”
“You really think so very little of me,” Malfoy sneers, a sarcastic edge to his voice.
to have had, with toy dragons, and a mother who baked, and a godfather who sent him postcards when he was on holiday.
After another endless, awkward moment of silence, Draco finds himself nodding helplessly, and Harry breaks into a blinding smile.
“Why.” Malfoy’s tone is just flat, like he can’t even muster up his usual suspicion.
Padma snorts indelicately beside him, and Harry feels his ears grow hot. “No. The glitter is … uh … unrelated.”
“Thank you for coming,” he says, extending a hand.
With a sinking feeling in his stomach, Harry somehow knows what Bill’s going to say before he even opens his mouth.
With every single one of the Wheezes decorations full-throated in song.

“What, you don’t
At this, Hermione gives him her full attention, prompting an “ow” from Rose as the dinosaur tugs free. “Ron said you’d been staying over. Is the house really that bad?”
Harry can’t believe his ears. Ron’s always been a dyed-in-the-wool Quidditch fan, and he’s obviously not someone who’s remotely swayed by the post-war trend towards all things Muggle. But even he seems to be giving the game away.

“Well, not
“Oh, that looks so good,” Hannah groans, immediately dropping her pack and tugging off her shirt.

Ron nods. “Fibres consistent with one of the cushions on the chairs in his office.”
“It was nice of you to visit him at home,” she continues, the line of little blue glass bottles following the gentle arc of her wand.
“Only if you promise to help me decorate the Christmas tree,” Harry offers seriously, as if she might turn him down. It’s true that he doesn’t actually
Hermione gives him a small smile as she walks him to the front door, Hugo’s cries increasing in volume. “Go,” he insists, “I’ll see myself out.”
He goes back into the shop and brandishes it at the employee who gets to his feet, but doesn’t seem particularly intimidated.
!” Harry glances in astonishment between her and Ron, both of whom seem unfazed by this clearly earth-shaking revelation.
Draco leans in and presses a soft parting kiss to Harry’s cheek.
Draco calls for Beely, who pops into the room with a crack. He'd given clothes to the Manor's house elves on the day that it sold to an American witch looking to spend, but Beely had insisted on sticking with him, Merlin knows why.
Draco shakes his head, glancing down at his lap, as if he can’t quite bear to make eye contact. “
“I went in first. Marsden was standing behind a brewing bench. He wasn’t brewing at the time, but there were cauldrons. Ingredients. Belle was sitting opposite him. Laughing at something. Behind her was a stack of boxes. And some of them had fucking
Hermione laughs softly.
he tells her this part.
Harry thinks about all the things he’s letting go of: his misconceptions about the purity of Quidditch, his belief that he’d never fly again, absolutely all of his ideas about Draco. Maybe he has been a little trapped by the past. But now he’s definitely only thinking about the future.
Harry laughs but it rings a little hollow. “It’s changed a bit. Even got a Whole Foods now.”
Harry takes the steps up to his front door two at a time, suddenly self-conscious about having Malfoy inside his home, which is ridiculous really. It’s not as if it matters what an exiled war criminal thinks about how Harry lives. But he finds himself nudging his boots into line in the entry hall and leading Malfoy into the front sitting room he hardly ever uses, rather than the kitchen, where he knows for sure that morning’s breakfast dishes and last night’s takeout containers are still spread out all over the counter. While Kreacher is at Hogwarts during the week, Harry tends to let things slide.
“Spoiling tactics,” Bulstrode explains, as she draws her wand and demonstrates the
“And, if you’re amenable Draco, I’d like to reopen your mother’s file. Harry tells me that you think she might have been exposed as well. I’d like to look into that properly, if you’ll let me.”
They don’t find a single non-regulation spell anywhere.
“Don’t worry, Potter. It’ll be added to your final invoice. I’ll begin work on Thursday. We’ll keep in touch.”
Ron lets out a chuckle. “What did you do, mate? Not a good look for someone running for Minister to be getting fined. You’re the law and order candidate!”
play Quidditch exactly the way I’d expect from someone who’s spent a lifetime cheating. Daddy had to buy your way onto your first team, you’ve had to resort to underhanded tricks and deception ever since.”
Thankfully, the conversation moves on around them, but Draco’s plans for leaving early seem to dissolve. Every time there’s a gap in conversation that he thinks about taking advantage of, someone comes back with another round and plonks a drink down in front of him. He makes noise about going when Ron and Hermione beg off to relieve their babysitter, but Potter gives him a deliberate and unfairly attractive pout and he finds himself ordering another round instead and wishing he wasn’t so very weak.
He climbs on the broom handle in front of Draco, who wraps his arms around him and wishes for the hundredth time there was a more reliable way to fasten the child safely to the wood. But Teddy’s grip is sure, and he’s already yelling and pointing to where Potter is looping the trees above, and so Draco sweeps into the air.
“Swear to Merlin, if you make a joke about liking them better on the floor I’m throwing you right through the wall of this tent.” Draco tugs his pyjama jacket closed, crossing his arms across his chest. “This isn’t really the time or the place for a quickie, Potter. What are you even doing here?”
“It was a long walk, we’re tired, and frankly, seeing the castle looking like that,” Ron waves over his shoulder at the hulking silhouette, “is a little bit overwhelming. I vote we rest up, eat a good meal, get some sleep and start fresh.”
She nods, with a small grateful smile.
“Chapter fourteen,” Malfoy says. “Your calendar is a binding magical contract, similar to…” he waves his hand around as if searching for an analogy. “When you put your name in the Goblet of Fire at school.”
“And you know what?” Pansy laughs again, though she sounds as though she might be on the verge of crying herself. “I think she was relieved. I think the idea that she didn’t have to keep concealing it from you any longer made her happy.”
The Weasley family Secret Santa draw was instituted the year Hugo was born and Ginny and Neville got engaged. The sheer number of gifts people felt like they needed to buy had become unwieldy, and even though the family was much more comfortably off than they had been in the past—given the success of Wheezes, and the Order of Merlin stipends—Arthur finally put his foot down. Molly sobbed for two days straight that he’d destroyed the spirit of Christmas, but now seems to have been won over by the ritual of the draw and the chance to host the whole family for yet another occasion.
“She’s been sick for months, Potter. Of course I reported it. I Portkeyed back here on my days off and sat through endless, pointless interviews, where the questions were all about me, and what
“God, that was grim,” Hannah sighs, as Harry carefully lowers Luna down again to sit against the stone wall. Hermione produces a handkerchief and passes it to her, and she blows her nose noisily. “You all really had a bloody terrible time during the war, didn’t you?”
Malfoy sighs. “Because she wasn’t there, and she doesn’t
Ron rolls his eyes at Harry, who manages a smile.
“Now, if you don’t mind,” Harry says, and leaves the room, striding around the corner to his office.
“I’ve told you everything,” he says, smoothing a hand over the map in front of him, weighted down at the corners with pebbles against the crisp spring breeze. “There’s no need for you to … If you come back tomorrow, I won’t have anything new for you.”
Hermione digs out her notebook and consults a small ornate dial in her hand: a kind of magical compass that no doubt does seven other things besides indicating their direction. She steps neatly around a patch of stinging nettles as she eyes each of the trees near them in turn.
“I know how you feel about me, Potter,” Malfoy says with a sad little laugh. “
Harry sighs, sending his stag back to explain haltingly that he’s unable to remove the baubles from his bedroom.
“Harry didn’t…” Hermione trails off. “Wait, what did you do for your birthday?”
Draco. The thought intrudes on Harry's shock, pulling him back to the present and the implications of the scene before them. How much more damage will this awful man’s death do to his already shattered family? Or will they feel on some level relieved?
that it made a keen ache start somewhere in Draco’s chest. These shallow, awful people, who were somehow managing a mere six months after their whole world was nearly destroyed to pretend as if nothing had happened. As if Draco’s father wasn’t rotting in prison and his mother broken-hearted in the ground.
“You don’t have to decide now,” Neville says diplomatically. “We can talk about it later.”
“I ran into Malfoy again, yesterday. Like, physically. Ran into him full-tilt coming back from a jog outside the Leaky. Bowled him right over.”
Hermione laughs. She gets out her wand and a small grimoire and heads upstairs to start inspecting the wards. Harry goes to find Rose.
“You kept that quiet,” he teases, sitting in Luna’s armchair the next morning.
Harry very much wants to kiss him. He finds himself staring at Malfoy's mouth and almost starts to lean in a little, but Malfoy’s expression clouds and he steps away.
“You need to be free to try...whatever you need to,” she says. “Merlin knows, we already have.”
Harry is puzzled. The elf didn’t seem guilty, so much as determined to follow instructions. It’s clear that the elf has been told to say nothing by someone in the Malfoy family. And with Lucius dead, that doesn’t leave many other options.
“I know, I know,” he says, getting up and helping her collect and stack the scattered purchases. “I won’t stay. Come with me, for a coffee. I’ll explain.”
seriously. And instead of hanging mistletoe and baking gingerbread, I’m contending with a house I can’t heat, mail that wants to attack me, and decorations that explode. You’re the cleverest person I know—other than Hermione, but I really cannot let her know what a mess I’m in because I’ve only ticked about three things off the list she gave me—and I
“Thanks Harry!” she says, gratefully.
“I’m not doing trust falls,” Wood snorts, gathering his gear bag and leaving immediately, which Harry supposes isn’t exactly an objection. The others seem to take this as a broad approval for the proposal, fetching their own equipment and following him out.
“Thank you.”
“We can’t
“Are you still very angry?” Hannah asks.
Granger bristles.  “You don’t
Harry rushes to shower and dress, and it seems like minutes later the Floo is roaring again, filling the house with the sound of laughter and carols and his family.
She looks from one to the other with just the faintest hint of a smile.
“People expected a lot more of me,” Harry says.
It’s more than he could have hoped for. Entirely more than he deserves.
New York that first summer was overwhelming in the best way possible. Loud and crowded, filled to bursting with people who had no idea who he was and didn’t care. In those pre-recession years it was a city focussed entirely on making things bigger and better and shinier and new, even in the wizarding sections, where he spent as little time as possible.
“Only me,” Dawlish reiterates, ignoring Harry’s dismissal altogether and folding his note into a crane that quickly swoops away.
“They’re such mundane items,” Hermione sighs, picking up one of the shoes. “Do they even have anything in common?”
Malfoy comes to an abrupt halt, staring down at Harry’s hand on his arm with an incredulous expression. There’s an awkward silence, and Harry lets go at once, irrationally hoping he hasn’t wrinkled the cuff in some way.
“But…”
Harry seems distracted, and Draco’s not sure he’s fully understood what he has achieved, which is, frankly, groundbreaking.
on the coffee table. August 28th. He tries to think back a month and it’s like trying to fight through a fog.
It’s clear that the trip to Potter Cottage is making Harry uneasy, even though he’s pretending it isn’t. He’s fidgety. Tugs repeatedly at the buttons on the cuffs of his jacket. Cracks too many jokes.
“Is it addressed here?”
Draco’s about to defend his Liberty Tana lawn cotton sleepwear, but Harry’s already waving a lazy wand at him to slide the buttons from their holes.
Hermione lets out a small sob. Parkinson ignores her.
Murmurs of disbelief and indignation spread across the garden, and Harry sinks gratefully to sit on a stone bench and rest. Draco comes to sit beside him, a careful distance between them, but somehow it’s still enormously comforting.
Draco stands, unwilling to carry on the conversation. “It’s fine. I’m a big boy, Hermione. The Chosen Prick isn’t so remarkable that it’s ruined me for other men.” He tugs the park map out before she can say anything else. “Look, there’s a Haunted House. That ought to be hilarious.”
“Get Ron to take the kids home to bed. I’ll open another bottle of wine.”
“She’s terrifying,” says Ron, and when Harry snorts, he grins back. It's the first moment of genuine levity they’ve shared all weekend, and in turn feels slightly more comfortable. It reminds him of the good memories he has of them working together as partners, too often forgotten among all the irritating ones. Besides, this is an investigation. This, he can do. And while the absolute last thing he expected from this bizarre weekend was to find himself in the employ of Narcissa Malfoy — or in any way worried about her son — at least this gives him something to do other than twiddle his thumbs and wait to be told he can leave.
“Really?” Pansy arches a perfectly manicured eyebrow at him, lifting the olive out of her martini and spending far too long drawing it off the pick into her mouth.
“So, we’ll be leaving soon?” Fleamont asks, when Harry’s deigned to shave and put some clothes on.
. Did you know that old Jim Cranswick comes to every game because his son was an Arrow, and he died in the First War against Voldemort?”
His finger slides up one of the thin white
Malfoy seems to want to be alone all of a sudden. The precise opposite of his younger self, who would have thrived on being the centre of attention. He retreats to his bed at the other end of the room. Hannah and Neville announce that they’re going to stocktake Pomfrey’s potion supply cupboard, but Harry suspects that they’re probably just hoping for a moment by themselves. Luna and Hermione clean away the remains of their picnic, levitating the plates and cups to the sink.
“When we came here, the first time. Before Hermione and I saw the sign. I wondered if maybe it hadn’t been repaired because it
“Might need a few more decorations though,” he says solemnly.  “I’m sure you can make some after lunch.
Draco tenses beside him, and Harry reaches out without looking to take his hand, lacing their fingers together. He waits for some sort of negative reaction from Ron, but Ron glances down and then just rolls his eyes at Harry, before his face settles into a more sympathetic expression.
Draco’s so close, is the thing. And the position is suddenly not remotely therapeutic, it’s unbearably intimate. All Harry can think about is the tired ache in his limbs, and all of the blood in his head rushing south, and the way Draco’s bright blond hair is a couple of shades darker when it’s damp with sweat. And Harry’s suddenly mortified, because if Draco pushes into the stretch even a few centimetres more he’s going to know
to Hermione?
“Well,” Leila looks around at the empty public pitch. It’s far too cold for anyone else to be here in the middle of a weekday morning, a fact Harry was counting on when he chose not to wear a Glamour. He doesn’t want to begin working on this at the club, and it was hard to think where he could go that would have space and privacy. “This will do for now. We start.”
personal experience.”
, he doesn’t say.
Malfoy doesn’t look up. “No, this was Vincent’s bed.”
Ron seems to gather himself, putting down his coffee cup and getting to his feet. “Mrs Malfoy, I understand that you’re trying to protect—”
“I’ve landed actually,” Neville sounds a bit sheepish. “I was hoping you could give me your address.”
“You look very distinguished, Professor Potter,” he says, glancing around to see if there are any students nearby who will wolf-whistle at them before leaning in for a kiss.
Harry thinks that sounds like a bloody terrible idea, but says nothing. His brain has stalled out at the thought of Malfoy not only seeing a Mind Healer, but being willing to try a Muggle technique, however daft. Hermione gave up pleading with Harry to get help of his own years ago.
Harry snorts, the sound coming out a little colder and more derisive than he intends.
“Don’t.” If this is going to work, if Harry’s going to be back here and part of Teddy’s life and turning up at the Burrow and just continuing to
Neville seems confused. “Who?”
“Isn’t it extraordinary?” Melinda agrees, her smile wide. “It just
we’re back with him and he’s furious we’re flying patterns from the eighteenth century and punishes us, and we have to start all over again.”
Harry frowns in concentration, trying to recall the list of approved broom spells. He’s pretty sure
“Don’t be silly, Hermione,” Luna replies loudly, ignoring Hermione’s attempts at tact. “I won’t be going anywhere. Now’s the time that Draco and Narcissa need our support the most.”
He’s already walking away down the hall toward his office. Harry takes a moment too long to appreciate the view. Draco gets almost all the way to the end of the corridor, far enough that Harry can only just hear him, before he calls out.
. We need to go!”
. If that means I die trying, then so be it.”
“Or if you prefer, you can hit the showers early,” Malfoy goes on.
In theory, the techniques should be the same. Potter knows, on some level, this isn’t his life.
Maisie Llewelyn, the no-nonsense witch who runs the place, is waiting for him on the top step, looking curiously at the shouting otter.
Harry runs his palm over the Gryffindor insignia embroidered on the back of the sofa. It’s quite a thought — trying to fulfill the founders’ hopes for the castle.
“So there might be something here that could help Belle?”
It’s an opportunity Harry should take. To explain to them both that it’s not a leave of absence. That it wasn’t even a formal resignation really. Just another foul-tempered fight with Robards; the last in a long line of them. But he’s not ready yet. To talk about how being an Auror proved to be nothing like he’d imagined. All the ways in which nothing about his post-War life has turned out quite the way they planned.
“Naturally,” Potter’s sneer is derisive. “Mustn’t tarnish the line.”
“Come here,” Harry cuts him off, pulling Draco into a kiss. For a moment Draco rests his forehead against Harry’s shoulder, and he can almost feel the tension and sadness drain from them both.
“No, absolutely not,” Malfoy says to Parkinson, his voice now bored and matter-of-fact, and Harry shakes his head abruptly in agreement, tearing his eyes away from Malfoy to scowl darkly at her.
“You’re not the reason they’re losing their jobs,” she says. “You can let me be the villain, I’m used to it.”
For just a moment, Harry thinks the scene will unfold like a cartoon, with outsized reactions — spit takes and gasps and someone dropping a glass. But there’s just an eerie, stunned silence. No one says anything, as if they’re all poised, waiting for some further elaboration. An explanation, the revelation that it’s all a prank, anything. But Malfoy just looks down at his plate as if he’s at a loss what to do next.
She plucks a parchment from her satchel and produces an ornate-looking quill.
“I’ve never been off it.”
“Yes,” says Harry. “Yes, I’d like to stay.”
“He goes down for a decent stretch at lunch time, if you want to come back tomorrow.”
“She sent the elves to get everyone. I don’t know what she’s doing,” Malfoy says with an annoyed sigh. He looks tired, like he didn’t sleep all that well. He also seems determined not to put himself in Harry’s orbit at all, carefully taking the seat as far away from him as possible in the room, nursing an espresso.
Everyone dutifully lifts their glasses. “To Draco and Luna,” the group repeats.
“When did we last see Dean?” Harry asks, trying to recall. He and Seamus came for dinner the week before last maybe, or….They were at Ginny’s last match at….
Draco puts them both out of his mind, lying down on the large mattress beside Potter. He keeps careful space between them, tries to ignore the clean scent of the pillow beneath his head, closes his eyes and begins his incantations.
“I didn’t ask you to do that.”
it’s crown moulding and a mitre saw.
“You’re not in trouble. I just want to find out what happened. Neville tells me that the plant that causes that can be very dangerous.”
This, of course, is Harry’s chance to back out and save face. He could immediately clarify that, no,
On Hermione’s count, he holds his wand as high as he can above the water and concentrates everything he has at the door. The tiny space is suddenly alight with flying magic and an extraordinary amount of noise. He hears the stone groan and reform, but tries not to get distracted, throwing his magic at the old oak and feeling a sense of satisfaction as either his spell or Malfoy’s, or both, send the enormous wooden panels splintering back on their hinges. The steps are holding and Luna pulls herself from the water, dashing up them to the entryway and across the threshold.
She meets him in the corridor and for a split-second looks so grateful to see him. For one horrifying beat he thinks she might be about to hug him, but then she seems to think better of it. Her expression closes in again. At the end of the hall he can see two more Aurors standing guard outside a door.
Draco leans forward. “What time did she retire?”
The unicorn turns and gives a disdainful toss of its mane and then proceeds to rear back and take off into the trees at a gallop.
It’s certainly easier with two of them, and before long they have a decent snow-person-shape, standing several feet high. Malfoy bends over to stick in the carrot nose, and Harry has to shove his hands in his pockets to keep from dropping a handful of snow down the back of his coat collar. It’s the sort of thing he’d do to Ron. The sort of thing he might do to Malfoy, if their relationship was different. If this were really the festive-fun date depicted in the calendar. Harry gets lost for a minute in the idea of knocking Malfoy into the snow and kissing him senseless.
Malfoy came to work at the Ministry a year ago after, by all accounts, an absolutely stellar run on the continent. First class Curse Breaker at the Berlin Ministry. Orders of Merit from both the German wizarding
Draco just shrugs. “So we even the score.” He draws his wand and proceeds to cast a bunch of incomprehensible spells at his broom, and then attempts a pattern. His movements are excruciatingly clumsy and slow, and he pulls a face. “That ought to do it, no?”
It’s almost two in the afternoon before he forces himself to have a lunch break, taking a clutch of campaign memos with him to read as he heads to a little hole-in-the-wall sandwich place he likes that’s a short walk from the Ministry. He nods at the guy in the open kitchen who grins broadly and gives Harry a thumbs up as he starts automatically making his order without even asking. Harry leans against the tiled wall, trying to focus on talking points for a speech he’s supposed to be giving later in the week.
Kreacher doesn’t even turn around, but Harry’s pretty sure he hears several approving mumbles about Blacks finally occupying the Black house that might account for the marked improvement in the quality of the food.
His tracking instincts kick in and he stops moving, listening instead to the sounds around him. His companions are not all being quiet, and he heads due west in the direction of branches breaking, grateful for whomever is being clumsy enough to give away their location.

“It’s
“You sit on your broom like a middle-aged lump of lead,” Malfoy steams on, undeterred. “You coach Quidditch the way Binns used to teach History of Magic. Like a droning, out-of-touch, dead-before-your-time—”
“I mean, if you want to,” Harry murmurs, suddenly uncertain. “You’re released from the Vow now.”
is possible.”
Harry looks stricken for a moment, and then like a puppet with its strings cut, collapses back down to sit on the bed.
If she doesn’t mean for it to sound like an accusation, Harry thinks, she’s fallen pretty short of the mark. Hugo starts to cry, and Harry decides to take the excuse.
All of sudden, he’s addressing thin air, Malfoy shooting several feet above him to where the team are forming up again.
“And so then I just went to bed.”
, Harry thinks,
She laughs. “I know a certain house elf who feels very
Harry falls asleep thinking about Malfoy’s pale body pinned beneath him that first night, his blond hair soft under Harry’s fingertips.
The word doesn’t sound right. Harry thinks immediately of horses, but he knows that’s not what she means. Even Hermione seems confused, her brow furrowed as if she’s trying very hard to remember something.
Harry’s stupid calendar seems to agree, brightly shining from door seventeen.
Harry scowls back. “That’s not my job.”
from murderous ghosts, fought by my side so that we weren’t all torn apart by swords, and found the room
His owl brings a stack of post carefully pre-sorted by his campaign assistant with the latest poll numbers clipped neatly to the top. It’s looking good, he thinks, feeling the last of his waking tension leave his shoulders. Three weeks to go and he’s on track to be the youngest Minister for Magic in wizarding history. He’ll finally be in a position to make real change.
ceremony. We were the very first same-sex couple to have one.”
“Send my love to your mother,” she calls over her shoulder as she stalks away, shopping bags swinging around in her wake.
“Didn’t you see, Harry? One of those ghosts was Colin.”
Cambie nods again. “Oh yes, Miss Auror Wong yes. She would have had to step over Cambie you see, I was right in the way.” The little elf’s expression is mournful, horrified by this perceived dereliction of duty.
Harry’s face feels hot. He decides he’s done more than enough skating to keep the bloody calendar happy,
“But —”
“Something funny?"
Parkinson snorts. “
Harry has just enough energy to be briefly horrified. Ron? And Pansy? But it’s too much to contemplate, too strange an ending to the whole unhappy day. And anyway, it’s not as if he’s really in a position to judge. He returns to his room and collapses back on the bed.
of their own, for Salazar’s sake. I know I can’t tell you where to go or what to do, but I’d sincerely appreciate it if you didn’t come here anymore.”
Draco had somehow managed to convince himself that the fantasy version of Harry plaguing his dreams was just an overly flattering figment of his imagination. Confronted with the reality of him, in figure-hugging skinny jeans and a black shirt with the sleeves rolled to reveal an enviable summer tan, Draco realises his fantasy was drastically underselling it.
“So, whenever this happened, it was while Neville was away. Are we thinking it was at the birthday party?” Hermione addresses her question to the group at large.
And someone brought him coffee, Harry remembers, hot and strong and full of sugar. It didn’t really help.
“No?” Harry asks, looking back at him in surprise, something sparkling and expectant in his expression.
“Stick it in the chiller over there,” she says with a smile. “We have plenty open already.”
“What is? Prague?” he hears finally, barely louder than a confused whisper.
like a vacuum cleaner!”
“No.” Draco swallows. His throat still feels scratchy and dry. “He was sixteen maybe. But no scar. No indication the Dark Lord existed. He was dating Cho Chang.”
a liar. Colour me wholly unsurprised.”
Harry has slowly renovated most of the old house over the years, but this might be the room he’s most proud of. Once the old Black library, he’d had Aurors take every one of the musty books away after the war—unwilling to even try to ascertain which of them were cursed and which of them were just boring. Now the shelves are filled, floor to ceiling, with Quidditch memorabilia. Harry regularly scours estate sales and attends auctions to add to his collection. He has the Snitch from England’s last World Cup victory in 1978 and Carter Mayfield’s racing gloves from the 1990 season. He has the oldest racing broom in private hands. And a Quaffle signed by every member of the national team since 1999. Framed on the walls are photos of teams and moments from significant games, including a truly amazing wizarding photograph of the very first time Wronski flew his now-famous feint.
“No, I’ve neutralised them. Stabilised the magic so that Bill can complete the vault clearing requirements and release everything.” Draco is beaming. It’s such a massive accomplishment that he’s still having trouble believing he’s actually managed it.
It seems Draco’s not that lucky.
Harry glances across at Malfoy, expecting him to shoot down the idea of serenading Harry’s ex-girlfriend immediately, but he just shrugs. “They’ll be a sympathetic audience,” he sighs. “Other wizards will recognise us, and Muggles will probably just have us arrested for crimes against Christmas.”
“Tell me more about his life now,” Draco asks, dragging his notes toward him. “I need to find anchor points. Things I can use to pull him from these childhood fantasies back to the present day.”
“You don’t know that. Even Ron doesn’t have the cause of death yet. What if… what if one of the elves...”
Draco looks so vibrant, tucked into the corner of Harry’s couch, the Christmas lights on the bookshelf behind him illuminating his hair. Harry wants to keep him. Just like this, his face open and his eyes bright.
“I don’t think I can...” Malfoy says quietly.
stamped on them!”
—after they died. He’s never had anything of his parents other than his father’s cloak and the album of photos Hagrid lovingly assembled for him when he was a child. Just the idea that their things are sitting in some vault gathering dust, that Dumbledore never told him, is overwhelming.
and his voice echoes eerily off the stands in all directions. The players are brought up short. Maxwell nearly slips off his broom again.
“I’ll stay with Hannah and Neville,” Malfoy says, dropping down to sit beside them, his back against a bookcase. “Let you all fight it out.”
“Stop.”
Parkinson wrinkles her nose in distaste. “That’s disgusting.”
Malfoy also seems satisfied, scribbling notes in his little book. He taps the twelfth door with his quill. “What happened here?”
Harry figures he’ll grab a couple of sandwiches and take them with him. It seems rude to turn up empty-handed a second time. If Hermione doesn’t want one now, she can keep it for a snack.
that causes Hermione to flinch, but she doesn’t back down.
“I don’t understand.”
Malfoy appears at a loss for words. He stares at Harry for a long moment. Harry feels self-conscious, as if he’s put too much of himself on display. Made himself too vulnerable to someone who, historically, would have only delighted in taking advantage of it. He feels his face heat, and snatches up his clothes, stuffing them back in the bag.
Then all of a sudden, he’s forced to focus for an entirely different reason.
“Godric’s Hollow?” Harry asks, surprised. So that’s what he’d meant about a ruin. “Was that where you were when this frame was in the vault?”
“Right, onwards and upwards.” Harry thinks Hermione sounds far too chipper for someone who recently had knives flying at her head, but it’s hard to argue with the idea of getting above ground, and so the group picks their way up the rubble-strewn stairs to the Great Hall.
ever been invited to his dinners more than once. He doesn’t have a good reason why Harry has. Not a reason he wants to discuss with anyone, anyway. Particularly not Harry.
Holber puts his arm around the younger elf’s shoulders. “You remember what Master Draco said,” he says encouragingly. “There are no more punishments in this house.”
Draco is staring at the Yule log sitting on the centre of his desk, the gentle scent of the wood and foliage suddenly more apparent in the small office. The ornament is larger than Harry had appreciated, and considerably more ornate. It looks beautiful.
Ron barrels on, undeterred. “They'll use these tests to identify possible murder weapons... and then look for this DNA stuff on them... and then," Ron breaks off, losing steam.
Her pursed lips suggest otherwise, but she immediately produces parchment and quill, just as Harry hoped she would.
“He doesn’t need to,” she retorts, provoking a howl of disbelief from Ron. “He
A sudden, stabbing headache overtakes him as he tries to think about it. He’s supposed to be out convincing voters to support him right now. And the very thing he wants their support for is kicking the man opposite him out of the country and denying him his rights. It’s outrageous. How can he have found himself in this position?
Harry looks at the names in turn. All of his close friends and family, exactly who he’d expect, but then he notices something.
“Thank you for coming,” he says sincerely. “I know this is against the rules.”
Harry lifts one thin arm and takes Draco’s hand, lacing their fingers together.
Harry tries to decide what to do. He
Worst of all, it doesn’t matter what Harry has them do, all of the players have adopted an infuriating habit of taking one hand off their broom every few minutes, touching their lower back and then returning to their grip.
Harry cuts him off with a kiss.
like he’s joking. His tone is as cold as ever. But there’s just the hint of something at the corners of his mouth. Just the tiniest twitch, that Harry swears could be somewhere on the way to a smile.
, no. That’s not what I meant.” Harry runs a frustrated hand through his hair. “Never mind. Thanks for your help. I’ll talk to Draco tomorrow.”
He gives Harry a long, serious look. “We all were, mate.”
“You’d have been good at this, Potter. Teaching, I mean. The way you were able to in fifth year.” Draco only knows bits and pieces about the famed army of Dumbledore, but he saw the way they fought. He knows how talented Potter is.
“That broom’s got more charms on it than those Valentines you used to get in school.”
“Oh my god,” Nott says. Zabini, for the first time this weekend, seems at a loss for words.
“So there’s no need to change plans.” Hermione says it with an overemphasised finality, as if she’s not interested in arguing about the topic any further. “Let’s have something to eat.”
There’s a name he hasn’t thought about in a long time. He knew Malfoy had left the country straight after the trials, but in truth the only time he’s crossed Harry’s mind since has been when he’s woken with the sulphuric scent of Fiendfyre still in his nostrils.
Ron succeeds with a spell that lays stone over water, something he’d had to perfect the second time George had mucked around with putting down a commemorative swamp in the Wheezes store. He makes it up two makeshift steps before they melt back into muck and he slips all the way down.
When he leaves a couple of hours later, the weather has improved. Hermione presses one of Molly’s lasagnes and the book he’d conveniently overlooked into his hands as he goes. He leaves them both on the little end-table in his room at the inn and heads out for a run. The pavements are slick and the wind whipping up off the river is just on the wrong side of unpleasant. He runs a giant loop, crossing over the Millennium Bridge and back along the south side of the river to the Eye. The queue of Muggles waiting for the attraction look miserable and hunched in their brightly coloured rain jackets.
,” Hermione says, passing Harry a mug of tea and sitting down as if that counts as a complete sentence. Harry ignores her in favour of sticking himself with the needle again.
The scotch now tastes sour on Harry’s tongue and he pushes the glass away, tossing some Muggle cash down and heading outside as fast as he can. He’s starting to feel like whatever elaborate prank is being played on him may actually succeed in making him crazy after all.
Harry helps Hermione make tea this time, and they take their plates into the sitting room, where Hugo is sleeping in a Moses basket. Harry makes all the right noises about how cute he is, but in reality he looks a bit like any other newborn he’s ever seen: scrunchy and red and slightly undercooked.
. Yeah, there’s no reason you would have known that. He’s a very specialised kind of Potions Master in France. Something
Harry cuts him off again. “Because I made a mistake! I said one wrong word, and it led to one of my best friends being tortured and another one being killed; you don’t think I’d give anything to take that word back?! Hermione’s up in her room somewhere, hung up on the fact that Parkinson suggested everyone throw me to the wolves. You know what I think? I think she was the only one in that room brave enough to say what a lot of people were thinking. Actually, giving me up was the smart choice, it’s what I should’ve done immediately. How many more people would have survived if I hadn’t left it so late? And what does Pansy get for seeing that clearly? Judged for the rest of her life; my best friend throwing away a perfectly good relationship with her because of some dogged idea about what we
He expects righteous indignation, a hex, or possibly a punch to the face. He doesn’t expect Malfoy to laugh and say, “I’ll see you ’round, Potter,” as he walks away.
“It’s as if it’s vanished from wizarding devices but not Muggle ones. If the party happened, and none of us remember it, then...” She pauses and takes a studying breath. “Whatever happened to Harry and Malfoy may have happened to all of us.”
don’t think for a second that the two of you, of all people, being BFFs isn’t a complete headfuck.”

?!” Hermione hisses, horrified.
“Henry Maxwell has been trying to get that manoeuvre right for weeks. Draco’s been working with him on it after hours and on weekends, but Maxwell lacked confidence. Draco was sure he was capable of it. He was fit enough and had the technical skill, but he couldn’t get the kid to trust himself enough to pull it off.”
Hannah screws up her face in discomfort, but Luna just turns the weed over in her palm with interest.
Potter laughs at something Jason says and Draco aches to feel that carefree. To lose the weight of the expectations he’s placed on himself over the years. The all-consuming need to do better. To

Percy is in charge of the draw, naturally. Over the years George has cheated in innumerable ways, including the Christmas he famously managed to get all the names in the hat changed to his own. It was only the fact that Ron and Hermione always tell each other who they’ve drawn—in flagrant breach of the lengthy (and growing) list of rules—that flushed out his scheme.
“I assume because she has nothing to tell them. She didn’t have anything to do with this. Whatever she says will be pure fabrication. If she stays silent, she can’t contradict the evidence.”
“It’s a joke,” Harry says. Hermione glances around the room, taking in the rumpled throw and pillow on his sofa, and the three empty coffee mugs Ninky didn’t get to yesterday. Her mouth thins into a disapproving line. Harry waves his invite at her to distract her. The last thing he needs right now is another conversation about his career choices. “It has to be a joke.”
There’s a long pause while they just sit, appraising one another. It’s Draco who breaks the silence. “Do you want to do that? The apologies and the explanations? We can, if you like.”
Draco blushes and ducks his head. “I won a little on the last game,” he admits, and Harry suddenly remembers forgetting to ask him anything further about the bet. But before he can say anything, the whistle sounds and the teams sweep into flight.
Ron shrugs and says he only knows

“He was irritated, but I think anyone would have been, given how his father had been treating him over dinner. He certainly didn’t seem like he’d just
“And we
Draco pulls a disgusted face.
“And how long were you and Parkinson together?”
Unfortunately, as he hops back and forth in front of the fire attempting to defrost his hands, it seems like the calendar doesn’t agree. He taps the edges of it, swears at it a bit, but nothing changes. Door fifteen does not light.
The Chaser looks affronted at being singled out. “But Harry didn’t—”
The elves have set up the picnic under the shade of an ancient-looking oak. Rugs and cushions lie artfully on the grass and the hampers have been unpacked to reveal low folding tables replete with savouries, stuffed croissants and cakes. The thermoses of coffee give off steam, but Zabini heads straight for the ice buckets of champagne, tearing off the foil on a bottle and firing the cork into the air with a flourish.
They eat while Luna recovers. Harry picks at the reheated lasagne disinterestedly. His impatience is returning. Ron is stuck somewhere several floors below them. They need to get out.
“That’s where you’re wrong. When it comes to trauma patients, I…”
—visitors.
“Well?” Ginny asks Harry, without preamble.
Ron raises his hands placatingly. “Alright, Mrs Malfoy, perhaps you and Cassie and I can go next door and you can tell us what happened.”
“Ron assumes she was worried about Zabini’s drunken cackles waking the rest of the West Wing.”
As she stands there, the soot stains begin to retract back on themselves, shrinking in toward the wood. The blackened oak wrinkles and rights itself, becoming smooth and polished again. And then, as if it had never been there at all, the door disappears altogether.
He made it through the wedding, and when Ron and Hermione left for their honeymoon in Majorca, Harry packed his bag, Portkeyed to New York, and never returned.
Neither of them mention the mistletoe.
“You and Ms Parkinson,” Ron clarifies.
“Oh for fuck’s sake,” Hermione says tiredly as she walks into the room and sees Harry.
“No, you don’t understand. I did what you said. I did

It doesn’t really seem like café conversation.
, our foundation class.” At this he turns his attention to the children in the first two rows, many of them tightly clutching their parents’ hands.
Blaise just shrugged and scrawled Harrison’s number on a cocktail napkin. Draco felt an absurd burst of pride that he not only owned a phone now, he also knew what to do with it.
“We can’t rule him out, though,” Cassie points out carefully. “By all accounts he was very offended by what was said at dinner.”
“Very well. Six,” Malfoy announces suddenly, striding back to his wall and scribbling a note below a line of runes.
“Brilliant, Hermione, what was that?” he asks, bent double, panting and exhausted but flooded with relief.
The dust settles, but it feels like the least of their worries as a rumbling sound starts to shake through the walls, rolling like thunder. Or an approaching earthquake. The stone floor starts to move underneath them and for a horrible moment Harry imagines it just melting away, leaving them to fall seven floors to their deaths. The walls around them feel like they’re bending inwards, as if they might just break loose and crush together, destroying them all in the process. Harry finds he’s yelling his incantations to be heard over the noise and he realises the others are doing the same. His mind races, trying to determine how he can hold a shield over all of them at the same time, but knowing he can’t.
“Look, I’ve never understood the pair of you. Not when you were pulling each other’s pigtails as kids, or stalking each other round the castle in sixth year. But Hermione says you’re the only one who can get him to wake up. So that’s that. You’re not bailing out on him now. Not after everything.”
Then, like Ron, she was gone.
“You must have had a right old laugh, with me here yesterday saying
The founders seem intrigued, watching Hermione’s ephemeral projection as Hannah leads the group in distracting the kitchen magic, sprinting past the knives to the pantry. The image shimmers and changes, and he sees Draco running full tilt through the Great Hall, eyes wide and terrified, yanking Harry to safety with only seconds to spare. It shifts again, and this time he sees himself exhausted and shaking, fighting with everything he has against the broadsword in the library. Another ripple, and Luna is bent over on her knees in the Room of Requirement, battling the demons of her own past.
? How many apologies do you need?”
Malfoy just shrugs. “This is bigger than all of us. Bigger than petty schoolboy rivalries. Too important to jeopardise when all Weasley needs is a nap.”
“Spare me the—”
Belle’s windows still show the low red-painted stables, covered in snow, but today it’s as if there’s been a snowstorm in the charmed landscape, and the panes themselves are covered in icy snowflakes. It’s a beautiful piece of magic, Harry thinks. Much more detailed than he’s ever seen in windows at the Ministry. The light refracts through the icy patterns casting a dancing rainbow of light on the covers of Belle’s bed.
Harry’s wearing jeans and a sportcoat, his shirt unbuttoned at the collar. He looks every inch the hot teacher, and it’s doing terrible things to Draco’s composure. He’s unfathomably glad that his Hogwarts professors never looked like this. He only had to suffer through a brief series of fantasies about Lockhart before the man’s sheer stupidity made him impossible to even dream about.
“Well, that must have made a tedious evening even worse,” Harry snorts sarcastically.
Malfoy’s shoulders slump for a second, as if defeated, but then he squares up, offering both his hands out to Harry without another word.
When Harry blinks his eyes open the next morning, the all-too-familiar surrounds of the Hogwarts hospital wing leave him confused for a second. His brain races to catalogue his limbs as if he might be injured in some way. It takes him a minute to realise that Malfoy is lying in the bed beside his, watching him.
Draco wants to cry. There’s a wellspring of emotion flooding up inside him that he hasn’t felt since the moment he restored his own parents’ rings all those years ago. It’s overwhelming, expanding in his chest. He hears himself let out a tired, choked sob.
. There aren’t words, Harry. To untangle all the ways we wound ourselves up with each other back then. The things we did right and the things we did wrong. Believe me, I know. I tried to find them.”
“I thought we were starting over. If we’re going to actually try to work together, the least you can do is use my name.”
“You won, mate,” Ron says, clapping Harry on the back as he gathers up the children’s toys and stuffs them in a tote bag. “Why’ve you got a face like a smacked bum?”
“No,” he hears himself gasp. “I didn’t—”
“Really?” Malfoy asks, puzzled. “Our dorms were all on the same level. The doors would grow strangler vines,” he goes on, by way of explanation.
“There’s a charm,” he explains, digging around in the box for the piece of folded parchment. “So you can change the location. You know, what stars you can see. I had them set it to start for—”
“Don’t,” Malfoy says quietly, his expression suddenly bereft.
Narcissa lets out a strangled sound and gets to her feet, hurrying down the length of the table and taking her husband’s elbow, as if to either steady him or steer him away, but he shakes her off with unnecessary force and she stumbles backwards.
“Puts itself together, I know. Somehow I think the calendar would view that as cheating.”
“But —”
“It’s Harry.”
“You brought me,” she points out.
Luna nods serenely. “She’s in room 43.”
He’s suddenly absurdly grateful for her. For her calm presence and canny intelligence and her unending optimism.
is it that you’ve dragged us here to propose?”
“Not me, mate,” he says with a baffled shake of his head and takes the BLT, leaving his Sickles on the counter, and trying to focus on his notes again as he makes his way out of the shop. The thing is, he must have read these talking points before. Parvati’s note at the top says this is the

Harry looks down at his doodle with a start. Once again, he’s drawn a snake coiled around a sort of cup or goblet, this time with a forked tongue licking out. He stares at it in confusion. It’s familiar, but it’s not the Mark.
The property, underfunded by the Council that owned it, and having passed through a sort of half-life as a museum and working farm for children to visit, needed a great deal of work. On his first foray into the nearest village Draco hired Jack, a builder who seemed to find him terribly funny. “Don’t know where you grew up, lad,” Jack would say, whenever Draco did something that revealed his lack of knowledge about Muggles, but he always said it with a smile and always explained himself, and for that Draco was unendingly grateful. Draco bought himself a pair of ridiculous rubber boots apparently called

Harry turns the pages slowly. The grants Draco has made are set out in careful detail, and the list is long.

“Maybe...
The thing is, Draco
“We were just talking about Luna,” she says, setting her book aside and gesturing at Ron to join them. He hesitates, clearly far more interested in finding a drink and the company of people who will praise his hunting prowess than getting drawn into this conversation.
“Oh captain, my captain,” he murmurs against Draco’s lips as he casts rapidly to regain his balance before they both fall out of the air, snatching the Snitch from Draco’s pleased grasp and setting it free.
“Absolutely not, Mister Potter.”
, but there’s no way Parkinson doesn’t know the full extent of Harry’s injury. Nothing else has escaped her immaculately manicured notice. So Harry doesn’t believe for a second that Malfoy doesn’t know he can’t fly an Annenbaum any more than he can transform into a cat or survive a Mandrake scream. Harry grits his teeth. Malfoy’s just trying to get a rise out of him.
Hannah sighs, stacking the clean plates on the sideboard. “I think I would have been, earlier. But Harry, being in the Room with you all yesterday — seeing what you went through during the War. I think I can understand why she wouldn’t have prioritised
He goes quickly before Malfoy can change his mind, and spends the rest of the afternoon interviewing a very confused old wizard in Telford who is convinced the missing witch is his granddaughter (she isn’t), that she’d popped by for tea yesterday (she hadn’t), and that she can currently be found working the checkout counter at the local Tesco (she can’t). Harry suspects it has rather a lot to do with the large glasses of mulled wine he keeps ladelling out of a sweet-smelling pot on the stove. “Sure I can’t tempt you with another one, Auror Potter? I have extra cinnamon sticks!”
“There is no file open, or not that they can find. Do you think Dawlish is looking after it himself off the books for some reason?”
what the castle’s doing, Granger. It’s trying to get us to turn on one another.”
When he opens the book at Belle’s bedside that afternoon, he thinks about the giant canes, and about Alice growing and shrinking. About not feeling quite like you fit in one place or another.
Harry chokes a little and tries to disguise it with a cough.
“I’ll do it,” Malfoy insists, taking the jug. “Your luck might have improved, Potter, but let’s not risk Weasley’s livelihood.”
in cahoots. “Do you really want to just give her whatever book looks most incomprehensible at Flourish & Botts?”
Hermione looks even more tired than the rest of them, but she seems unsurprised by his question. She pulls her hair back from her face and refastens the elastic. “We can’t eliminate the risk completely,” she says honestly. “Our magic is underpowered in here as it is.”
“Vanished without a trace. There was too much damage in the basement to leave any useful evidence.”
“You okay?”
“Absolutely not.”
“Potter,” Malfoy had said. As if no time had passed at all. As if they ran into each other in Muggle bars all the time.
He doesn’t recognise the restaurant, but it’s the sort of place he loves to eat at. Stiff white linen tablecloths and red wine in giant boat-sized glasses. The dessert in front of him is fussy and complicated, and when he takes a bite, delicious flavours explode on his tongue.
Melinda nods glumly. “I think he thought we were unprofessional. I’m sure it’s going to affect my evaluation. We were only having a bit of fun, you know.”
Malfoy’s answering look is absolutely withering. “With
Harry groans, exasperated. “Stop messing about, this has gone on long enough.”
“I hope so,” Malfoy says, as he opens the door.
In their third game the Arrows limp to a draw against the Catapults. Harry would consider the result fantastic progress, but actually, Caerphilly seems to be struggling to adjust to the new rules even more than Appleby is. Their ostentatious owner equipped them all with what he’d described as state-of-the-art wand holsters, but the contraptions protrude awkwardly from the players’ thighs, and they have to reach down each time when want to cast. Harry would probably be the last to admit it, but the one thing Malfoy has managed to drill into the Arrows is the ability to draw their wands seamlessly when they need them. Maxwell’s Stinging Hexes go completely unanswered, and the scoreboard stays level to the final whistle.
She closes her eyes and lets out a defeated sigh. “There is a risk —”
“They’re all Muggle items,” Malfoy says, and Hermione frowns at him.
“Really. And you’re only mentioning this now? That’s convenient.” Her steely stare doesn’t waver.
Harry bursts out laughing and gives him a crushing hug.

There’s a long silence. It’s Henry Maxwell who breaks it.
investigation.”
“Neville called me this week,” Harry says, sinking back on his elbows. “I guess he’s helping plan all this anniversary stuff.”
Andromeda shoos him out of the room with a wry smile.
He goes to Metropolitan Bar, a favourite since he’d started going for drag night with Nigel and Thomas years ago, which is packed with enough men to have already largely defeated the air conditioning. Although that might be on purpose, judging by the number of them on the dance floor with their shirts off. He pushes his way through the crowd to the bar and orders a drink. It doesn’t take long before a tall Latin guy presses up alongside him, suggesting they get to know each other. Harry lets himself be tugged through the crowd, surrounded by hot, sweaty bodies grinding to a thumping bass, and out to the shadowy back patio.
“Some warning, mate,” George sighs, sliding the last one into place as Harry dusts himself off.
can tell yourself whatever you like, mate, but it’s pretty obvious that you're not just shagging him. You should see the way you keep looking at his ferrety face. Turns my stomach a bit, but it also clears things up. No way you’d let him or his mum take the blame. In fact, no way you’d let anyone. You’re—”
“It’s a distraction,” Harry complains.
Luna laughs delightedly. “Oh, Leila's not interested in men, Harry,” she says, giving him a consoling pat on the arm. And then Harry finds himself sputtering even more indignantly, protesting far too much and tripping over his tongue as he tries to defend his interest in Leila as a
“Well, hopefully it won’t just be you. If this works, I plan to make it a regular occasion.”
Harry thinks about that. About the idea of just walking away and letting Draco Malfoy yell and snipe at his players, teaching them deceitful tricks and probably encouraging them all to get tattoos. Harry’s in this now, he realises. He needs to stay for his team, if nothing else.
“We don’t have good school memories, Harry. We hated each other. You fought and won a war I was on the wrong side of.”
Silence.
“Here we are then,” she says quietly. Draco takes her hand as they follow Harry through to Platform 9 ¾.
of all things. He’s at a table in the back with Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini and honestly, Harry could be forgiven for never wanting to know that Malfoy looked like that when he laughed. Carefree and happy in a way Harry’s pretty sure he’s
“Actually, yes,” Ron replies amiably. “More or less. We just wanted you all to know that we’ve brought in some Muggle experts — our counterparts in New Scotland Yard, the Muggle Aurors.”
“That’s a bit morbid, mate,” he says, pointing at the pad on Harry’s knee. “What is that, the Dark Mark?”
Hermione casts in a circle on the floor in front of her, and a shimmering pond appears, floating over the stone. Then she touches her wand to her forehead, drawing out ethereal strands of her own memory and dropping them into the pond. Her memories spring fully-formed into view, projected in the air like they’re all somehow suddenly
When he arrives, Harry’s almost surprised his Apparition worked, given the vast difference between the destination he’d held in his mind and where he’s landed. He expected it to feel the same as it did in third year, when he’d tumbled off the Knight Bus and right into Cornelius Fudge. The physical space is the same but the Leaky looks almost unrecognisable, the formerly dingy interior lit with modern lamps. The wooden floors have been stripped back and polished, the booths upholstered with a rich, creamy leather. The whole place has transformed from a grimy wayfarer’s tavern to something approximating a gastropub. He’s pretty sure that’s Sufjan Stevens playing in the background.
,” Casey smirks, hugging a file to his chest and leaning back against the desk. “He gets to the door and Hospital Security stop him.”
His players falter, slowing down and hovering to stare at him.
“Well?” Malfoy asks, and Harry’s eyes snap up to his. He’s going crazy. That’s the only actual explanation. Whether it’s the lack of sleep or the paranoia or a magical cause. That’s the only way to account for him sitting in his front room wanting to touch Draco Malfoy.
Wood is staring at Harry now, his lips a thin, angry line, waiting for him to intercede.
Harry’s throat feels tight. He hasn’t had this conversation with anyone, and he’s got no idea why he’s having it now, but there’s something nostalgic and out-of-time about being in this room. Something sheltered and private about being here with Draco in the half-dark.

“I couldn’t exactly surround myself with Fiendfyre, and ordinary fire wasn’t what was keeping me awake for days on end. So I had to tinker with the spell until I had something that worked.”
No one says anything.
Harry feels like he could level the exact same question at Ron in return, given Parkinson’s nonsense about being in Zabini’s room for

to countersign the requisition form for a new one. She threw a book of home repair spells at his head—and it was a good shot, he’ll give her that—and left him to it.
“I haven’t been here, on account of the ice and all,” Harry retorts, rolling his eyes behind Malfoy’s back. Malfoy reaches out and tries to open door twelve, but doesn’t have any luck.
“Alright. Show me this calendar,” he says, after a few moments, lowering his wand. Harry points in the direction of the sitting room, and waits while Malfoy throws more salt on the ground before leading the way.
“Harrods, it is then.”
“So what’s the plan for today?” Draco asks, emerging from the dorm rooms rubbing at his eyes. Harry hopes his head feels worse than his own, if only because wishing a hangover on Draco is better than thinking about how good he looks sleep-rumpled and straight from bed.
Draco sighed. “Potter, I was raised with an entirely flawed set of beliefs. I didn’t carry any of them with me after the war.”
Harry sags, as if standing up for traditional Quidditch has exhausted the last of his resources. His hip aches, Parkinson’s only been around two days and has already upended his entire world, and literally the last thing he needs is this impossibly-handsome alternate universe version of Draco Malfoy taking up space in his office.
Balham offers him a grim smile. “The problem is a little bigger than a bake sale, Harry.”
“It’s good to get things back on track.”
“Fine, I’m packing my bags,” Bulstrode announces to no one in particular and stomps out of the room. The rest of the group drifts after her, apparently with similar intent. If Harry was expecting someone to immediately dash off with a guilty expression, he seems to be out of luck. When it’s just the four of them again, Ron says as much.
The Head Auror’s expression gives nothing away. He straightens the post into a pile and tucks it into a folder.
Harry looks around his apartment. It’s small, sure, but it’s sufficed until now. It’s certainly bigger than a Gringotts vault. He’s not sure what the portrait means by a
. The icy draft that disrupted his sleep a week ago is long gone. Low fires burn in each of the bedrooms that he pokes his head into. There’s even long strings of tinsel wound in amongst the bannisters. Kreacher must have been decorating.
He’s about to give up when he hears a familiar voice behind him.
“Well, then,” he says conspiratorially. “We better make sure Hugo doesn’t find out for a few years yet.” Hugo is currently perched on Hermione’s knee sucking on a beer coaster so there doesn’t seem much danger of that.
There’s nothing but a counter with a magical inbox atop it, constantly receiving a flow of memos flapping their paper wings down from the rafters. And a small bell that has a sign beside it reading
“And then what?” she asks gently. He hates it. Her whole demeanor makes him feel fragile, like he’s going to fly apart at any moment.
After a lunch of overboiled hotdogs and sickly blue fizzy drink, Hermione spreads out the park map on the picnic table. “Where to next?”
“That’s just it, Harry,” Neville says with a shrug. “This broom is absolutely regulation, top to bottom. There isn’t a single charm on this that isn’t League-approved, and certainly no
“Think how impressed they’ll be when we come back, though,” Neville assures her, but is quelled with an exhausted scowl and resumes his foot massage in earnest.
“Oh don’t worry, Harry,” Luna giggles. “This diary is Muggle. I just like the colour.”
“Do you mean the League rules?” They’d spent considerable time in Prague sorting out what magic Draco’s old teammates could teach the Arrows that would be allowed back in England.
The founders look at one another and then back at Hermione.
Harry’s stomach drops. Belle seems exactly the same every visit. He always pats her pale hand and smooths out her covers before he goes. She always seems wan, but no different from one day to the next.
Granger had drawn herself up to her full height, craning her neck to look up at him yet somehow still making him feel like she was sneering down her nose.
The Arrows have a bye, and so Draco’s absence isn’t causing too many difficulties, but the players keep looking to Harry for explanations that he doesn’t have. Maxwell continues to insist that Draco charmed his broom before the game, and certainly has no reason to lie about it. And Harry’s frustrated because Draco owes him a bloody explanation himself, but is nowhere to be found and isn’t answering Harry’s owls. Which, if Harry was looking for more proof of his guilt, is frankly pretty compelling. He really should have seen this coming.
What a disaster it was, he thinks now with a laugh. He did everything exactly as his mother would have, planning the menu with careful attention to every detail and tradition. He had the right wines brought up from the cellar and the ceremonial linens brought down from the attics. After the War, the Manor had been cleansed from ridgeline to foundation by Ministry cursebreakers. The house elves had spent a full month repairing the damage, restoring tapestries and heirlooms. But in advance of the banquet Draco sent them through again, changing out carpets and drapes, polishing windows until they shone. He was determined that there wouldn’t be an ounce of dark magic to be detected anywhere.
It doesn’t seem like the right time to for Harry to broach the fact that he’s planning to invite a dozen people over for Christmas, so he lets him go.

Or the day after that.
him very much when they’re together, so he’s unlikely to put up much in the way of protest if Harry calls it off.
“I can’t use magic except to save my life or the life of another. And I get to wear this delightful advertisement that I’m not to be trusted. Just one more mark you’ve left on me, Harry. One more way in which I’m a pariah. It’s clever, really. Makes it very difficult to get by. I can’t live among wizards because they won’t deal with a contract-breaker, but the big glowing bracelet makes it pretty impossible to live with Muggles either.”
Ron shoulders through the door arms laden with oversized candy canes as large as golf umbrellas.
But nothing about that trip went right. The brittle way Molly still held herself, fragile with suppressed grief. The slightly puffed-up tone Ron would use when he said things like “as a married man.” The involuntary disapproving twitch of Hermione’s nose whenever someone asked Harry what he did in New York and he told them he waited tables. It had only been a few months, but the distance between them felt impossibly wide. Worst of all, everyone seemed to assume that Harry’s absence was only temporary. He lost count of the patronising claps on the shoulder, the knowing smiles about “gap years,” the insistence on talking about his inevitable return and his future as an Auror and defeater of Dark Wizards “once he’d gotten all this out of his system.” And then there was the nightmare of the family dinner.
“Does anyone know what all this is about?” Hermione asks the room at large.
Harry passes Sato as he heads toward the Curse Breaking department.
Hermione looks upset by this, but Ron gives her a one-armed comforting hug.
Judging by the way Draco surges up at him, he figures the sheets probably aren’t a deal-breaker, but he keeps his mouth occupied for quite some time, just to be sure.
“Your list of spells that are
that,” she insists. “He comes to the Burrow for Sunday lunch. Or I mean, he did, when he and Ginny were still together. He thinks it’s a bit awkward for now.”
“He was at a cottage by the ocean covered in shells.”
Poor Nev’s mouth falls open in horror.
The room is bare and functional, with diagnostic monitoring charms beeping quietly in one corner and a meagre bunch of peonies stuffed in a chipped vase on the side table. It all looks bland and institutional. The only thing out of place is the reclining lounger sitting where Draco imagines a bony plastic visitor’s chair would ordinarily be. He wonders absently how many nights Granger has spent in this soulless room. It’s almost fascinating in its ordinariness. He’d imagined that it would be bustling with Healers. Filled to overflowing with tributes and get well cards and balloons and well-wishers.
Luna still appears every now and again, without warning. She always brings him a thermos of dandelion tea, which tastes like boiled grass, but he appreciates the gesture. This time, when he lets her in, she looks at the elf heads in the entry hall.
Zabini, appearing not to have heard him, says, “Excuse me, sir? I didn’t catch that. Would you like to say a few words as well?”
of a reaction. He keeps turning it over in his mind as he showers and heats Molly’s lasagne for his dinner. Like a sore tooth he can’t stop prodding with his tongue. For the first time in years, he thinks about the Marauders’ Map, tucked away in a box in his closet at home.
After dinner, Andromeda sets the dishes to washing and goes upstairs to watch one of her murder mysteries. She always swears she bought the television at Teddy’s insistence, but Draco knows better.
They decide to divide into two groups. Hermione makes them all demonstrate their best door-opening skills, conjuring up a heavy wooden door in the front wall of her tent for them to practice on.
“We can’t get discouraged at the first obstacle,” Hermione insists, wrapping both hands around her mug and drawing closer to the fire. “We learned a lot today.”
used to bang on about how backwards everyone in London was.
every other day?”
“So what I don’t understand is,” Ginny goes on, “given that’s the case, why
Harry’s startled by the offered reprieve and it must show on his face.
Malfoy’s mouth opens and then closes again, as if even he’s not sure what to say to that. Curse Breaker Sato spends a few minutes setting up a double layer of protection wards around the door, and then she and Malfoy move within the safety bubble to open the door.
“He hasn’t even talked to Teddy on that stupid mirror since he left. I don’t know why I expected better, really. But I’m furious that that rootless layabout’s lack of attachment is affecting Teddy.”
“I think you’re doing a great job,” Harry assures the boy, pulling his thumb away before it becomes one with the pinecone.
“There you go,” Draco says, with a final flick of his wand.
“This is lovely, isn’t it?” she says, twirling around as she looks up at the decorative hangings. Harry takes another look at their surroundings, realising he recognises the carved Hogwarts crest over the glowing fireplace.
Harry starts to feel a little confused, which is probably partly the champagne, but also the fact that none of the three of them seem to be talking about today’s defeat.
“It’s okay if people know, Harry.” He says it as gently as he can, taking both of Potter’s upper arms in his own, and turning him to look him in the eye. Potter’s expression is wild, uncertain.
He hears Hermione start to cast, so he tries to muster up the strength for a final assault. His wand arm aches, and his magic is feeling shaky and less focussed. Beside him, Malfoy’s neat, orderly spellcasting has taken on a wild, frenzied air.
“You really are to the Manor born, aren’t you Potter?”
Unlike the damp passage outside, this unlocked space feels dry and dusty. The huge windows Harry remembers looking out under the lake are just closed stretches of stone now, making the space seem smaller and somehow less intimidating. Malfoy uses his fire spell to light a set of torches in sconces along one wall. Ron flops onto an overstuffed green couch, succumbing to a coughing fit as a cloud of dust shoots up all around him.
They pause as a bell sounds and knots of chattering students file past them outside for recess. A little girl of about six or seven has her hair up in vividly coloured pigtails that keep changing colour like Teddy’s. Harry feels something clench in his chest. One of her shoelaces is untied, and he stops her and helps her re-tie it, listening attentively while she gushes at him about her new friend who’s just started at the school and didn’t know that mermaids were real. She sounds outraged.
“Potter’s talking about an underhand cast,” Malfoy lies, cutting him off smoothly and directing an icy glare in Harry’s direction. “We’ll go into overhand and underhand casting once you get the hang of flying with your wand. Let’s start with some basic drills.”
The ear-splitting warnings sounding around them are making concentrating difficult. They’re taking up space in Draco’s head, alongside the pounding headache, making it worse.
“Okay, I’ve stemmed the bleeding and stabilised him, but we need to get him up to the hospital wing.”
Satisfied, Harry closes the door carefully.
be sure that we’ve made all the changes we need, but that’s okay. I’m prepared to go ahead.”
Malfoy looks at him, his eyes bright, and takes a shuddering inhale. But before he can say anything, the others surround them, helping them to their feet and bombarding them with questions.
Before Millicent can say anything, the doors to the room swing open and Narcissa Malfoy enters. She’s dressed head-to-toe in black, which makes her seem even more unwell than she had looked that morning, but her head is held high and her eyes are dry. She comes over to Ron with a purposeful stride.
“You too!” Neville says. “Feels like I’ve been gone for ages. How is everyone?”
Draco runs through a litany of possible excuses in his mind but takes too long, and Pansy’s expression starts to turn smug, so he does the only thing he can think of and agrees to the date.
“You fixed my window,” he says, without looking up, and seriously, Harry wonders if Malfoy’s tagged him with some sort of tracking charm because the way he can do that is creepy. And impressive.
“And did
He encounters Hermione coming out of the library, and seeing her, at least, gives him a moment of purpose. Hermione will know about entails, even if they are some sort of complicated pure-blood magic.
“Why would you say that?” he manages, clearing his throat.
“So let’s go back and get her, then. She’ll want a bath as much as we do, trust me. Besides, I really want to...” Hannah trails off, looking down at her hands, her lower lip quivering. Harry realises to his horror that she still has traces of Neville’s blood on her. “All the cleaning spells I know don’t work.”
what’s going on and it makes him sick to his stomach. Malfoy marries Luna and he keeps his poisonous father happy — the consequences for Luna be damned.
Hannah lines up little bottles of potions on Ron’s bedside table with notes about which ones to take. Luna finds a battered old alarm clock in Pomfrey’s rooms that still seems to be ticking. They have no way of knowing if it’s telling the right time, but it will give Ron a way to pace his doses.
“Will your mother be alright?” Harry asks Malfoy, as he returns his cup to the sideboard and walks with him to the front door.
Gringotts looks just the same, though, and Harry can’t quite shake a childish sort of guilt. The goblins treated him like he was something on the bottom of their shoe after the war, and while he understands that “sorry I destroyed a lot of your bank and made off with your dragon” is not really an apology you can include in a greeting card, he’s made a point of only dealing with them by owl until now.
“And even if it’s Gallagher’s, it doesn’t mean they made it into the grounds,” Harry notes. “They could just have easily been drinking here while they cooked up their story.”
He caught himself staring a moment too long at the advertisement in the window of an estate agents’ in Islington last week for an elegant three-bedroom terrace house. It’s not like he can’t afford it. Complete with a walk-in shower in the ensuite and flawless ceiling moulding. But he’ll be damned if he spends one fucking knut of Malfoy money on himself. His mother: fine. He’s made sure her home in the Paris wizarding quarter is comfortable and elegant, that the house elves know she is to want for nothing. But when they passed his father’s sentence and the ancient magic transferred the Malfoy entail to Draco’s shaking shoulders, he knew there was nothing in those vaults he wanted.
“You told us you only wake because he casts you out,” Granger interjects, annoyingly, from her perch by the window.
“I just want to help Draco,” Luna says simply. “I think marriage is a bit silly, to be honest. But I do like the idea of having a lovely party with all of my friends, and getting to wear a beautiful dress. And the flowers. I like the idea of the flowers. And so if doing that means Draco gets to look after his mother, well, that seems like a very fair trade. I care about him very much. I’d do the same for any of you.”
“Harry, be serious for a second. What’s keeping you here? I mean, apart from me, obviously. I’m pretty compelling. But in Britain you’ve got friends, family, a godson. A chance at a job you will love.
I’ve caused all of you?”
“And it nearly killed us,” Ron mutters mutinously.
“Yes. A No-Maj Integration School on Long Island. It’s to help Muggle-born kids before they reach middle school—Hogwarts age. We work on their accidental magic. A bit of history. That sort of thing.”
“Then why did you agree to help my mother?” Malfoy asks, puzzled. “You can’t think that you owe her anything, surely. After all this time?”
“I’m not really one for spending time around children, Potter. But I thought it was worth considering the opportunity.”
Hermione’s face flushes and her mouth thins into a tight line.
“I hope he enjoys the pie!” he hears Molly call behind him through the Floo.
“I thought that maybe this weekend would be different. Maybe Hermione would see that my friends are actually normal, not the villains from some fairytale. And we’d be able to socialise together like an ordinary couple. But from the outset it was clear she wasn’t prepared to make any kind of effort. So I went to her room to tell her that it was over between us.”
He digs around in the pile next to him for a flattish piece of wood, and casts the spell. Sure enough, the wood curls around on itself into a tight coil, with small steps cut into each turn.
The summer sun, which had heated the back of his neck as they’d hiked up to the boundary, now has a weak and faded quality to it, as if it’s trying to shine through some sort of magical barrier and just doesn’t have the power. Harry shivers.
, he realises with a start.
But then the letters came from Hogwarts, and while Hermione started to enthuse about eighth year and new textbooks and cauldrons, Harry felt his tenuous grip on reality start to slip.
“Goodness, what’s the occasion?” Neville asks, hugging Hermione and Luna, and clapping Ron on the arm as he snags a piece of cold toast from a plate. “Hello Draco,” he says amiably, and the look of shock on Malfoy’s face is absolutely mirrored on Harry’s own—he can feel it.
“Where’s the sign up sheet?” one of them asks.
He can tell right away that something strange is happening. As soon as he steps through the charms that keep the cottage hidden from the local Muggles, he feels the rings on his finger and on the chain around his neck respond. It’s as if something is clicking into place, like a key turning in a disused lock. The roof of the cottage is still collapsed in on one side, but the path to the front door has been cleared. Harry’s first thought is that someone has been here cleaning up the place. Maybe the Ministry has finally decided that letting it fall apart to its foundations is not the most suitable memorial. He feels a rush of possessiveness, that they’d start to do something like that without consulting him first.
“Being able to skate?” Malfoy looks baffled.
“Do you still want to go inside?”
Harry studies the wall-hanging again. Sure enough, the little doors marked One through Five are standing open, their cavities empty, but the closed doors marked Six on onwards have tiny little windows in them revealing their contents.
Hermione’s mouth twists.
Harry knew someone had to have overheard, but he wishes it hadn’t been Malfoy. He feels his face heat and picks at a loose thread on his blanket, refusing to look at him, not wanting to see his expression.
Draco sinks back against the pillows, taking another large swallow of water.
Spurred into action, Harry returns to Belle’s room, using a spell Hermione once taught him years ago to duplicate magic. Then he goes back to Malfoy’s office, vanishing the broken Venetian blind and sizing up the dull opaque glass behind it. He casts at the window. “
A flurry of activity from the library reveals the books reshelving themselves at a dizzying pace. A pile of textbooks near the door restack, revealing a copy of
“Fine. Good, actually. The crowd at Shout Out is bigger than ever. They’re planning to enter a float in the London Pride parade this year. Though I swear to Merlin if I have to listen to one more witch sing ‘I Kissed a Girl,’ I’ll hex her throat closed. I’m so sick of hearing about cherry chapstick, you have no idea.“
As the team part ways on the street, Harry suddenly finds himself fighting an irrational desire to ask Draco where he’s going. Whether he’s still staying at a hotel, or if he’s found somewhere more permanent. It seems odd after sharing a room with him for several nights to not know. But then he reminds himself that Draco signed a binding contract, and that’s the only reason he’s putting up with Harry. He waits a beat too long trying to decide what to say, and finds himself watching Draco’s bright blond hair moving away through the crowd crossing Euston Road.
could appear at any minute, for Merlin’s sake, Harry is surprised to find that he feels comfortable. At home. “Hey,” he asks, as they stack the last of the beams. “If I wanted to fix a wooden step, where would I start?”
His eyes are rimmed red and he’s staring at Harry like he wants to believe what he’s saying but just can’t. Harry very much wants to push his hair back off his forehead and kiss it, just to prove to himself that Draco’s really here: vibrant and upset and definitely not dying on a bathroom floor.
players your illegal fucking nonsense.”
Harry suddenly wants to know all of Draco’s stories, every last one. He doesn’t know how to ask. He hates how quiet it is in this room and how he can hear the water dripping from the shower and his own breath loud in his ears.
“A work day,” Malfoy cuts him off, “means that I need to concentrate on a cursed sarcophagus that the British Museum thought would be appropriate to haul out of a pyramid and put on display without any wizarding input. And that I don’t have time for your Christmas ornaments.”
amazing. With Draco’s help, the house now feels ready. Harry just has to make sure he is too. He unfolds Hermione’s list and looks it over. Unbelievably, it’s almost complete. Harry wishes that filled him with a greater sense of satisfaction than it seems to, but moping over Draco for the day definitely isn’t going to help.
Prompt Sixteen:
Draco nods. Ron keeps humming.
Neville looks like he might be trying to steel himself to continue the argument, but Malfoy intervenes.
He gestures to the rest of the team to grab their gear and head out. They follow him dejectedly, not one of them looking back at Harry. Harry feels shocked and saddened by the strength of Wood’s reaction. He’d expected the team to feel encouraged by how well they’d been playing together. Under the old rules, they’d have won that game handily. They really have improved a great deal in a very short space of time.
The owl is back promptly, and Harry tries to entice her to try the probably-kippers, but she flicks a wing at him disdainfully.

He kisses him.
“I’m not laughing at you, Hermione.” He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly.  “I’m not an Auror any more, and the idea that hunting Dark wizards might be my
The village of Godric’s Hollow is much prettier now that it’s coming into summer, Draco thinks. Even the riot of Potter Cottage’s overgrown garden has a certain amount of charm. That is, until he has to force his way through a particularly vicious patch of scratchy vines to get to the front door.
“It was so beautiful,” she murmurs, her hand flat on the unyielding stone. “You could see for miles. All the way to the mountains.”
“I can fully believe McCabe and Dillon half-assed it,” Hermione agrees, chewing on the end of her stirrer. “And I’m annoyed  they didn’t mention it when we discussed going to the Manor last week. But I don’t understand what you want to do now? Reopen it?”
“Harry, that chef, what she did with the plants was incredible. Wild jasmine flowers, and wood sorrel, and … did you know
“Duty calls,” Malfoy says, indicating where Parkinson is beckoning from the other side of the room, surrounded by goblins. Harry abandons his drink and goes to join her with a defeated sigh. The next time he looks around, Malfoy’s gone. Harry tries not to identify the feeling he’s experiencing as disappointment.
“Battery’s dead,” Malfoy says, holding up a mobile phone. Shiny, black, unlike anything Harry’s seen before.

“I’m planning a dinner, for charity. As you know, we’ve suffered through a terrible conflict,” Draco looked around at the other patrons. This hadn’t been the best idea. Harrison was clearly too recognisable for them to discuss his plans in peace. “I would like your assistance.”
“Yes, well. Well done. Good luck with your Christmas and so on,” he says in a rush, reaching for the Floo powder.
“Are you okay?” he asks urgently, sitting down on her bedside and reaching for her. She folds into his arms and gives him a warm hug, nodding against his chest. He feels something knotted tight within him start to relax. It’s a little easier to breathe. They’ve all made it through.
“But we know more than one wizard was behind this. It’s not as if we can just walk around casting at everyone we see in the hopes of stumbling across our villains.”
Hermione screws up her face. “I’m not changing a spell on the fly, Draco. We have no idea what that will do. It’s not listed as an accepted variant.”
Draco chuckles, but then his expression turns serious again. “Are we really doing this?”
Harry joins them on the ground.
“But our previous home was so inviting,” Harry replies drily. “It had Slytherin bedding
. He flicks his wand at Harry’s shirt. The snowmen do not budge. He casts again, muttering a different set of incantations. One of the embroidered Santas waves at him.
Harry had been so sure.
“Almost makes you wish your house was visible,” Hermione murmurs as they look at the sparkling decorations in awe.
“So, the scene gives us not much of anything,” Harry concedes. “What else do we have?”
Harry asks about breakfast, and gets one shrivelled finger pointed in the direction of the coffee pot.
“Then you’re a cheat

It’s only passing the boys’ bathroom that makes him uncomfortable, and he quickens his pace as if he can stride away from the memory even with Draco right there beside him.

Hermione makes a little noise in the back of her throat, like she wants to say something, but is holding back. Harry looks at her, raising his eyebrows.
“Keep your ridiculous hair on, Harry,” he sighs, scooping up the weights and the broom and returning them carefully to Neville’s bench. “I was just showing Neville something we used to use in Europe, so he could understand a point I was making about weight distribution.”
“You can’t,” she continues, her expression sympathetic but firm. “I’ll tell Robards about the breakthrough, obviously. Maybe he’ll lift the suspension early.”
They’re in a passage at the dungeon level. Ahead, where wide stairs once lead generations of first years up to their inaugural banquet, there is nothing but a pile of rubble. Everything smells damp: a dank odor of disuse that smells almost organic. Like the greenhouses used to smell after they’d been shut up during a winter storm.
Before Harry can get out a word in response, Draco is out of his office, slamming the door behind him.
She pushes a plate of muffins towards him, and he breaks off a chunk of one.
“Maybe it should be,” Zabini says, but more archly than unkindly. His tone makes Harry uncomfortable, and he shifts a little in his seat.
He drums his fingers on his knee. “It’s just a bit of fun,” he lies, looking up at the woosh of the carriage rocketing past them, all of the occupants screaming bloody murder. “People can shag without it meaning anything.”
There’s a very small part of him that wants to accept, knowing she’ll take charge and he’ll just have to do what he’s told and the whole thing will run like clockwork. But the much larger part of him needs to do this, to prove to himself that he can, as much as anything.
“How’s the sale going?” he asks Ron, hoping to prod some conversation into the silence, but Ron just shrugs.
Which is clearly what Molly is thinking as she clears her throat delicately and asks, “Do you mean at Grimmauld Place, dear?”
“Yes, yes, haven’t you made a name for yourself? Ribbons pinned to your chest. You’re nothing but a Ministry lackey. Just like your useless father before you. And
“Is it though? Only pictures anyone has of him now are in textbooks, and he looked like a scrawny kid back then. Definitely not like that trade
“Not at first. It didn’t occur to me that the rings would ever be of any use. I wasn’t an heir of Walburga’s, and I’d been blasted off the family tree the same as Sirius. Even if I ever intended to remarry, the rings weren’t available to me to use. But as Narcissa and I began to get to know one another again, she told me about the work Draco was doing. She was so very proud of him. And I began to wonder if perhaps he could help me.”
He’s lost both his suit jacket and his waistcoat at some stage during the night and Harry can see damp patches where he’s sweated through his shirt. His hair is all over the place, and he looks like he aches more than Harry does. He wonders if Draco’s been on his feet the whole time, casting and combining potions and Merlin knows what else.
On Wednesday night he gets to the Wand early and sits at the bar chatting to Jason, the sign-up sheet at his elbow. Kyle Travers nudges him as he scrawls his name into a slot. “Hey D, is it true?”
Her green robes today are offset with tiny charmed reindeer that chase each other around the hem. Her earrings are giant flashing stars. Harry absently wonders how she manages to avoid a deafening headache.
“You believe someone’s hurt her.”
Hermione didn’t disagree with him, but nevertheless decided that they’d follow the same path onto the school grounds. “It makes sense,” she said, pointing at one of her many maps. “It’s the shortest distance from the boundary and we can set up our base camp down here by the lake.”
“All I am saying at this stage is that she hasn’t told the truth about her movements that night.”
“This place is nice. Whose is it?”
Prompt Seven:
Draco rolls his eyes. He has a headache building in his temples that’s starting to throb.
It hasn’t worked, but Draco feels like he’s on the cusp of something. Now that Potter is dreaming at the right age, surely he can reach him.
Malfoy glances down at his chest in confusion and then back up at Harry, his eyes flashing. “You know this shirt?” he asks urgently.
Draco thinks about Potter, seemingly following Draco’s work all along. He thinks about the delighted look he gave Draco as he walked into the club. Thinks about the wounded, broken version of Potter lying beside him at death’s door.
“But they’re always bragging in the press about how amazing you are! How many dark wizards you catch!”
Not for long enough though, it seems.
Draco realises that Harry must have taken a place in Hogsmeade now he’s decided to accept the job. It makes sense, he supposes, but it leaves Draco feeling unaccountably cold inside.
It’s too hard for Harry to explain that the idea of actually actively choosing to have a pet had always felt like too much responsibility. And that Cassie had more or less adopted him, rather than the other way around. He hopes she’s doing okay.
Harry snorts in disgust. A fucking
Harry puts his hand on Draco’s arm gently. “That can wait for later. I’ll help. And Luna will. Your mother. You’re not doing this alone.”
“You’re good with children.”
“He’s been back for a while, six months or so. He contacted me about a junior academic position at the College. He wasn’t suited for it, but it meant I knew how to find him yesterday when Theo pulled out.”
“Wizards don’t know the first fucking thing about business.” She eyes the rickety-looking guest chair on the other side of his desk with suspicion, before taking a seat and crossing her legs. She’d be attractive, probably, if she didn’t strongly resemble a walking nest of vipers.
Draco writes the name at the bottom of the list. Her husband will be beyond irritated that he’s not invited, but the last time Draco saw him, sweaty and red-faced at the bar at the Opera House, his obsequiousness had put Draco off for life. Mabel, on the other hand, is interesting and capable. A publisher who capitalised on a new demand for young adult fiction in the wizarding world, with a sharp eye for trends that kept Crispin House’s books flying off the shelves at Flourish & Blotts. Merlin only knows what she sees in the man.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake, we don’t have time for this. Of
There’s an almighty bang. The floor rocks beneath him and Harry is knocked to the ground. An explosion of light and magic bursts out overhead, so severe it feels like it burns his eyes even though they’re closed. All the power leaves him in a final cataclysmic rush.
anything. It was just an ending. All I did was make it stop!”
“I have a suite,” he’d said finally, tossing some notes on the bar and getting to his feet. “I’m not slumming it in your room.” And then — well — then it wasn’t as if
Prompt Fifteen:
“It was a magnificent season, Harry, More than I could have hoped for.”
in this scenario.”
” Harry confirms, leaning in and kissing him soundly. “But you’re absolutely going to hate my flat.”
“Just go and explain. Potter’s used to that stupid old witch’s lies.”
Harry hasn’t experienced anything like the dedication and teamwork that the entire Arrows squad brings together in the days leading up to the final since, well…since the final days of the war.
Harry does it without thinking. Drops the shield he has over Luna and Hannah, striding toward Malfoy and the tornado of circling spectres, casting as he goes. He feels for the edges of Malfoy’s shield, picking up the quavering magic and boosting it with his own. It’s not something he’s done often and it’s an uncomfortable intimacy. Malfoy’s spellwork feels neat and precise, orderly. Nothing like the chaotic energy of Harry’s own.
“What did you forget?” he calls out.
“That was
“A box of quackers!” Casey announces, snorting to himself and reaching for another mince pie. The staff groan.
, show us your hands.”
“I’m bored now,” she announces, dropping her own crayon back in the pile.
Harry feels a twist of relief and something else — frustration perhaps at this stony-faced version of his childhood rival — as he enters his own tent alone. He doesn’t do much to unpack, pulling out spare sets of clothing and unshrinking them into a pile on his bed, and tugging off his sweaty t-shirt before throwing some cold water on his face and finding a clean one. He’d expected to feel energetic at this point, excited about the prospect of the challenge they were tackling. But being here now with the castle looming over them like this has just made him uneasy.
arrows into the air to celebrate a goal? Took that poor ref taking one to the nose in 1894 before that was banned, didn’t it? Or the introduction of the Pennifold Quaffle. Would you prefer to go back to the days when your Chasers had to keep nose-diving to the ground to get the damn things back? Would that be more
“Malfoy Manor,” he answers softly, hoping it looks just as optimistic there now as it does in this charmed imitation.
“Just. Promise me you’ll look into it,” he pleads.
“Harder for the Beaters to see and deflect,” Mina shrugs.
“You were going to have to let everyone go anyway,” Harry points out. “At least this way, maybe we will get an answer.”
The snow in Paris is falling like a fairytale, drifting in pretty flakes to the cobblestoned streets. Nothing at all like the grey sleet and the piles of dirty slush banking up in the gutters in London.
Hermione doesn’t seem at all convinced. She draws her wand and casts her Patronus.
Monday dawns bright and clear. Harry eats a giant pile of scrambled eggs at the Leaky and decides to get to the bank as soon as it opens. He feels a bit like he’s on borrowed time, before he sees someone he knows. Best to just get on with it as quickly as he can.
“... but it’s very distinctive, that star shape. We need to…” Neville trails off as he takes in Harry staring at him. “Oh hello, Harry. Have you been giving your interview?”
about anything.
“Eliminated every suspect,” Cassie says, and slumps down in her chair. “Godric’s balls, I hate this case.”
Neville tugs him away. “C’mon mate, don’t watch. Hannah knows what she’s doing.”
Harry ends up on a team with Ron and Hermione, which goes about as well as expected.
He broaches the subject with Elsa when he’s back in Brooklyn the following week.
Luna still seems blissfully unaware of the awful charade she’s found herself in. Instead of a hunting outfit, she’s chosen a yellow Mackintosh that wouldn’t look out of place on a children’s television character and chats happily to Ginny as she laces her boots over bright green polka dot tights. Harry feels an even greater sense of urgency about getting Malfoy to come clean. Luna deserves so much better than this.
(See the end of the chapter for
“There’s no curse,” he concludes, shrinking his pad and tucking it away in his pocket.
Hermione, who until yesterday had been so full of confidence — so
. Nev can look up his spell.”
Harry hadn’t even known she was at the game.
“There you are! Are you okay?”
Casey pats Harry on the shoulder as he leaves the station.
He looks good.
“Owl us tonight,” Draco says, fiddling with Teddy’s robes to try and get them to lie straight, which only makes him wriggle away from him. “And let us know what house you’re in.”
Luna appears to consider her words for a moment. “These spells aren’t a cure, Harry. They’re a way for you to have enough mobility on a broom to play again. And they’re not straightforward, or easy. Learning to use them would take time and practise and would hurt a lot to begin with. No one is saying you should do that if you don’t want to.”
“Good, considering,” Ron nods, as Hannah hands him another potion to swallow. “Have to replenish quite a lot more blood before I’ll be up to dancing on tables again, but.”
Most of them Harry’s never heard of, but a couple catch his eye:
“She didn’t want you all to know, because you’d think so much the less of her,” Parkinson cuts her off once more, pointing at Ron and then at Harry. “Ironic, really, when
It’s maybe-Tom’s turn to look confused. “But you always get both?” And now Harry’s sure he has him mistaken for some other regular, because Harry doesn’t like egg sandwiches and Ron certainly doesn’t and Harry’s never had a regular order for two sandwiches in his life.
Malfoy waves his wand. Dozens and dozens of tiny orbs, no larger than snitches, start to fly out of the chest and up into the sky. They swoop and arrange themselves, following the direction of Malfoy’s spell in regimented little lines, settling themselves on the eaves and windowsills of the house. Harry watches in awe as Malfoy’s spell sends a fresh wave up to the roofline, and another batch to rest in the branches of his front hedge. And then with a final flourish, Malfoy mutters one last incantation, and every single one of the orbs blinks into life, glowing like fireflies.
The plate of biscuits and the gingerbread house he arranges on plates on the coffee table. He adds the popcorn strings to the branches of the tree, draping them in amongst Rose’s previous efforts. Sure enough, the little lights behind the eighth, tenth and thirteenth doors flare to life. Better yet, the wilted branches of the Christmas tree regain their lush green sheen, stretching a little to better hold up the decorations. And even more miraculously, the fire in the hearth sparks, tiny licks of flame dancing among the coals. There’s a chance he’ll save Christmas yet.
Then he went straight to hospital security and said that Specialist Malfoy wasn’t to leave the building without Harry being informed, and settled into a chair to wait.
He snatches up his notebook and begins to write. Granger has the good grace to wait until he’s finished this time.
“Less drag on the rear Chaser,” Leila replies.
“I’m saying I’m not going to find out,” Harry says stubbornly. “I’m going to coach the Arrows to be the best flyers they can be. He can scuttle around teaching them to throw sneaky hexes like a bloody Slytherin if he wants, it’s nothing to do with me.”
“Of course. My greenhouse is the only licensed premises in the United Kingdom allowed to hold them in bulk like this. Potions Masters come to me to sign out what they need.”
Harry gives him an inscrutable look. “No, that’s okay. I know what I want to give him.”
