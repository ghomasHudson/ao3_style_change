Her smile reminded him of a hungry crocodile--but an oddly pretty one? “It’s a Muggle thing, you all get together and sing and drink a lot of alcohol.”
his brain whispered.
won’t stop babbling about it, even though it’s got to be old news by now. Arseholes. But Scorp was charming. Can’t imagine where he gets it from.
Ron saw Harry’s face pale drastically and elbowed Dean sharply in the side. Dean understood and hurriedly asked, “But Headmistress, the two of them? I mean, it’s Potter and Malfoy...you know what they’re like.”
Harry nodded emphatically, clapping her hard on the shoulder. Her slender frame rocked forward a bit before she regained her balance. “Of course it can. I mean, we’re still in school, we’re too young! You’ve got, what, another twenty years to have kids. That’s
“No. I want to talk.”
“I think this is the right place.” It wasn’t a chippy, as Harry had expected, or even a shawarma place, but some kind of cuisine he’d never seen before.
Isn’t that fantastic? I wonder how it intersects with Gamp’s Law…”
“I think Malfoy’s up to something,” Harry insisted, his eyes glued to the Slytherin table and aiming for his mouth with the muffin he held. He failed, of course.
“Good evening, Blaise. Hope you enjoyed the ball. Potter’s here, just for the night, so no need to talk,” Draco drawled, already rummaging through his trunk.
Harry barked out a laugh as he went looking for aprons. He found them in a tall cupboard next to the fridge and picked out a plain red one for himself. “Have you always been this melodramatic? Wow.”
Once he’d read it, Draco practically growled with frustration.
AKA the chapter where we all acknowledge that small talk sucks.
,” Draco grumbled. “Why’re the house elves still using the winter bedding? They should know better by now, they’re only millions of fucking years old.” He thought he saw steam rising from his skin, but dismissed it as his imagination.
Judging by the way Draco was nuzzling at his neck, he was thinking much the same thing. “Harry...I don’t want you to leave. Come, let me whisk you away to my lair to have my wicked way with you,” he chuckled low in Harry’s ear.
Draco sauntered back to the manager’s office, practically bursting with good humor. It was shaping up to be a wonderful day.
spread on a water cracker, and the flakes of salt are divine. Particularly topped with a sprig of rosemary, yes...” Malfoy trailed off as he reminisced. Harry was glad he’d stopped when he did; if he’d said one more word about eating slug smeared on a weird cracker, Harry would have projectile vomited across the table and all over Malfoy’s fancy suit.
“Draco--”
Debauchery? Where? That picture was perfectly appropriate; they ban you if they’re not. Seamus learned that the hard way after he tried doing “thirsty Thursdays” one too many times. He accidentally posted a video of himself showering and Dean had kittens.
“Cheers, Hermione,” a bemused Ron responded as she took another long sip.
Harry nodded. “Come on, Draco, show me what you can do.” Draco laughed and began to enter Harry. His eyes fluttered closed as he pressed slowly in. He looked like an angel on earth, all moonlight hair and carefully crafted features. He was almost more beautiful when he didn’t talk, but Harry liked mouthy, biting, opinionated Draco the very best.
She held him at arm’s length, inspecting him with obvious concern before she again took her place at the table. “Happy birthday,
Malfoy, ever punctual, had been waiting for him, reclining regally across a settee. He’d levitated a flute of champagne to Harry, telling him that “a nervous client does not a good fitting make. Drink, Potter.” Harry sipped his champagne slowly, admiring his surroundings as dry bubbles sparked on his tongue. "Quite the place you have here, Malfoy."
per se.”
Look, I replied. Even speccy gits can do that, you tosser. And it’s e-mail, not electronic mail. Everyone’ll think you’re a pretentious prat if you go around calling it that. They wouldn’t be far off, but still.
“Course, love,” Draco muttered. His jaw seemed tight, and he chugged the first half of his pint a bit quickly, but he soon loosened up nicely.
Harry rolled his eyes. He didn’t want to tell Malfoy
Ron fell right off the bed in his haste to correct himself. “Oh, bollocks! I meant like a hug! Mate, I wouldn’t snog you if you were the last person on earth. Just the thought of that...ugh!”
“I know. I regret how things ended. Believe me, Draco, I do. But I’ve grown up, and I want to try again. You don’t seem like yourself these days; I want the old you back.”
“What, you just woke up in the morning and half your hair was gone?!”
“Alright. Er, can I come in?” Harry asked, already halfway through the door.
So Harry was in high spirits when he knocked again at the wide oak door. When Malfoy answered, the first thing Harry noticed was the pout. Thin pink lips were twisted in a petulant sneer that reminded Harry unpleasantly of a pale outstretched hand and insults to his first friend. Bitter irritation rose in Harry’s throat until he noticed one other thing.
“--and either he’s a bigger bastard than ever, or he understood me when I spoke Parseltongue last week. He definitely didn’t in second year. I think he learned it just to fuck with my head.”
“Prick.”
Draco shook against him as he laughed. “Of course not. Happy Christmas, Harry.”
Harry worried his bottom lip between his teeth. “Probably not even that long, honestly. I don't quite know what I'd do with myself."
Harry
“Potter, this is Rod. Rod, Harry Potter.”
mate, ‘Arry.
! But--but ‘Mione, it’s Malfoy…”
“Which you do.”
“Pansy, Blaise, Greg--he adored them, you know, especially the Tex-Mex--but I digress. They would never lie to me.”
They lay still, catching their breath, before Harry smiled lazily at Draco. “Who knew? I like the way we fit.”
Before Harry could protest, a house elf appeared before Luna.
society pages, always on the arm of some strapping young wizard. Biceps the size of Quaffles, rippling thigh muscles, even a bloody cleft chin or two. These dates look like they could take Malfoy apart without a second thought. They probably did, Malfoy crooning and clenching around them as they took him to bed...no, Harry won’t think about that.
Okay, let's talk about the Slytherin common room. JKR didn't include the lake view in the book, but it's included in other descriptions she's written (see the house quiz). So, either Harry is an unobservant donk (likely), or JKR realized she did the Slytherins dirty with her lackluster description (equally likely). Whatever, I'm going with it because I like it. Enjoy!
is not a house, Potter, and does not care to be referred to as such. To answer your question, I’m uncertain how long the manor has been sentient, but I first noticed its
"Er...sorry, I just don't think we're each other's type! I have to go." Harry grabbed his pile of clothes, grimaced apologetically at Malfoy’s shocked face, and turned on his heel to Disapparate home. Still half-hard and only in his pants.
“Not one for the big picture, that’s for sure,” Draco murmured to himself as he watched the next employee attempt to upsell the customer from a drink to a full combo meal. At least Marta had promise, even if that permanent smile did seem irritatingly glued on. The customers seemed to like her. The witch currently at the counter had even gotten past the spider bit without running for the hills. She did still look a bit squeamish, though.
. It’s good, I learn a lot and I can still help people. Saving the wizarding world in a whole different way, and it’s one that has regular hours,” Potter explained with a wink.
To Draco’s surprise, walking with Potter in the cool embrace of night was almost companionable. They walked in silence, bellies satisfied and in no particular hurry. Whereas before Potter had obviously felt pressure to make conversation, the air between them was now easy and light. Draco almost felt a pang of regret when they arrived at his home. But to his surprise, Potter didn’t just wave and head off at their arrival. Was he expecting something?
Warm lips placed an open kiss on his neck. It was so tender compared to the filthy way the man rolled his hips against Harry’s.
It was Draco’s turn to roll his eyes. “Salazar’s sake, Pans, it won’t kill us to be genuine for once. Now the moment has passed, so back to our usual stiff upper lips and I’ll see you tonight,” he said, herding her out the door of his office. Pansy reluctantly allowed him to do so, accepting his goodbye with poor grace. She would reveal the identity of Draco’s mystery boyfriend, and she would lure Weasley to her. Like a delicious fly to a spider’s web.
Moments later, a red plastic tray was shoved in front of him, a miniature water cup waiting at its side, and Malfoy seated sedately across the booth. Harry took a deep breath, and lifted the crunchy, fist-sized spider to his mouth. He could see no way out but through. If he could kill Voldemort, he could eat some bloody bug without dying. Right?
...his mind was beginning to feel decidedly fuzzy. The rest of him was desperate for more. One of Malfoy’s enormous hands still held Harry’s wrists above his head, but the other slid between their two bodies. Finely manicured fingernails scraped gently at Harry’s waist, under his shirt, making him shiver. Heat trailed across Harry’s skin wherever Malfoy touched, the ache in his belly becoming unbearable, until the hand stroking his side unceremoniously cupped his groin.
Malfoy beamed in his direction, holding out one hand to grasp his. "There you are, Harry! I've been waiting for you."
“You’re telling me. This isn’t a dream, is it?”
Harry almost choked on the water Hermione had conjured for him. “Too right, mate.” He settled in to observe the Sorting, enjoying the looks of wonder on the new students’ faces. Surely he’d never been that small; they just looked tiny. Each of them trembled with anticipation and hope. They made him feel that all the fighting and death had truly been worth it, if each of them could attend Hogwarts and make friends and not worry about their safety or their friends’ deaths.
Hermione nodded, deep in thought. Somehow she didn’t seem surprised at all. Ron, on the other hand, stared at Harry with glassy eyes, looking like a toy someone had forgotten to wind up.
Malfoy practically spat the last word, seemingly ashamed to show any weakness despite the color rising in his cheeks.
Steam billowed through the chilly morning air at the Hogsmeade train station. Students chattered as they hustled aboard the train, swapping last-minute treats or owl post addresses before they left for the holidays. The cold nipped and tore at Harry’s exposed face, but the hand Draco held against his chest was warm.
“Draco?”
Malfoy’s pale face became waxy and hollow, reminding Harry of a skull. “As far as I know, that’s never happened in my family’s history. I’m inclined to believe my life would become rather difficult.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You pronounced ‘my love, my dearest, my only’ wrong, you absolute tosser. You’ll thank me later,” Draco declared, poking Harry sharply in the side.
Draco’s mouth twitched, suppressing a smile. “Sap.”
Sharp grey eyes rolled at Harry’s obvious faux pas. “The
“What--you--” Harry began, but then Malfoy literally swept him off his feet. At least, that was what it felt like. Harry felt like a leaf caught in a breeze as Malfoy guided them in a loose circle around the dance floor. Every place Malfoy touched him felt odd and tingly and warm, lovely and awful at the same time. How did he always smell so good? Malfoy sent him into a complicated twirl, and when Harry returned, they were both facing the other students. Malfoy’s arm settled around Harry’s waist again, and their hips kept brushing as they continued to dance. Harry was quite certain that Malfoy was showing off, but with trying not to trip over his own feet, he didn’t have enough concentration left to mind.
“Mmmpf--Draco I’m not gonna last if you keep doing that--” Harry managed.
“How fascinating. Our Saviour is a man of many talents. I would love to learn more about those, Potter.” Weirdly enough, Malfoy didn’t sound sarcastic at all. Maybe he’d been cursed. Whatever it was, Harry was determined to take advantage of it, if only to see what would happen next.
“Happy Christmas, Draco.” Harry swung his feet up onto a nearby pouf as he settled in for the long haul. He knew it would sound disgustingly sappy, but it was Christmas. With a lapful of blond boyfriend, he really had nowhere else he’d rather be.
Follow me, we’ll begin with tea.” Malfoy opened the door wider and gestured Harry inside. He stared at Harry for a beat, as though he didn’t know what to do with him, started, tripped a bit over his own feet, and finally led Harry to a drawing room down a long blue hallway.
Seeing that it was finally safe to continue, Draco did so. “So our favorite Golden Boy would like to know with which song I would have serenaded you, in front of everyone, after you publicly declared your undying love for me before all our friends?" Harry considered the question for a moment before he nodded. Didn’t seem like such a hard question to him.
“Malfoy, huh?” The name felt odd in Harry’s mouth, like discovering an old flavor that one had forgotten. “I don’t think their house was on the old list. What d’you reckon he’s been up to since I left?”
This thought made Harry unexpectedly sad. He hadn’t wished for a relationship or anything, but being kicked out while they were still panting and pliant hurt his heart. He nodded jerkily and rolled out of bed, quickly sliding on his jeans and searching for his boots.
The immense kitchen before them was larger than Harry had ever seen, even larger than the one the army of house elves inhabited at Hogwarts. Dark wooden cupboards lined two walls, and a large range and three ovens filled the rest. A fireplace large enough to roast an ox loomed at the end of the room.
“Yes,
Harry was so tired of being confused. He knew he had to make a choice sooner rather than later, knew he couldn't continue to hold Malfoy's heart in his dithering hands. But he'd done enough thinking, and it wasn't getting him anywhere.
Malfoy hid a small smile behind his teacup again. "How fascinating, Potter. I suppose you didn't peak in school after all."
Harry chewed thoughtfully on his own cheese and tomato sandwich before he answered. “I think I’ll become an Auror. Everyone expects it, and it’d probably be a good fit. They would’ve taken me this year, but I didn’t want to get in just because I’m Harry Potter. I want to apply and go through the training, just like everyone else.”
He shuffled awkwardly under her gaze, tempted to stare at the rows of corked indicator potions instead. “I thought we were just going to the pub again. Wait, what’s carry-oaky?”e
An exhausted Harry had had quite enough of museums by the time they left, but Draco saw a poster with a plesiosaurus on it and bolted for the Natural History Museum. Spending time around the looming, serpentine skeletons and realistically gory wall murals made Harry feel vaguely sick. But Draco resembled a kid on his first trip to Honeydukes, all bright eyes and overflowing questions. It was too precious for words. Harry did have to drag him away from a docent when he started asking how dinosaurs were related to dragons; they restricted themselves to reading the placards after that.
“Hermione, I love you, but please stop talking.”
Biting into the crust wasn’t so bad--it was evenly breaded, and the Cajun seasoning was pretty good--but, god, then he got to the actual
him,” Malfoy hissed.
When Harry was windblown and exhausted, he returned to the ground. His eyes were dry, but his heart was heavy. He didn’t miss the Malfoy he’d broken up with, but he did miss how Draco had been when they began. He had been almost sweet, and always surprising. Draco had become his best friend, the person he went to with every annoyance and every story. And then, things had irrevocably changed. Ironically enough, the dragon inheritance that brought them together had also been what pushed them apart.
Ronald?"
He couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy. Perhaps he hadn’t really meant to flirt with Harry? Tailors did have to get awfully close to their clients; Harry had experienced that before, but it felt
“Ron, listen. Honestly, I think they’ll be disgustingly in love forever, or the whole thing will go down in flames. But we just have to let Harry make his own decisions. Don’t interfere, alright?”
Harry chuckled and stepped closer. “I’m dating you, though. Doesn’t really matter what anyone else thinks.”
“Good. I like,” Potter grinned, leaning in to kiss Draco again
“This might sound dumb, but I think the manor wants us to play Quidditch.”
“Students, this painting is the entrance to your common room. Her name is Eirene. The password for this year will be ‘lotus blossom.’ Can anyone tell me the significance of this choice?” Professor Vector asked. She spoke slowly and clearly, each consonant clicking gently as it slid against another.
Harry automatically muttered, “Yeah, it’s a date.”
A pimply teenager in a neon orange shirt greeted him as he approached the counter. “Welcome to Spideys, how can I help you?”
“And you’ll forgive my life debt if I see you occasionally for the next six months?”
Rather than trying to boast about his family’s wealth, as the old Malfoy would have done, this Malfoy just sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Not again.” He turned to the wall and scolded, “This is meant to be an exit, not a display case, and you
“Good,” Harry beamed and took Malfoy’s hand. “You definitely don’t make me happy either. Not the way you laugh or those pretty lips or even your fetching new haircut.”
“Shh. Don’t care.” Harry heard a slight cough, but decided it must have been a branch popping in the fireplace. He was too involved in pulling Draco close and breathing in the jasmine of his hair to mind.
Contrary to what Draco had expected, Potter sighed in relief. Tension leached from his shoulders and he glanced at Draco with a lopsided grin that was not charming at all. “Oh, thank Merlin. I hate small talk too. Also handshakes. Really, I was just telling you about the Weasleys to be polite.” He paused, and his brow creased in thought. “What should we talk about then?”
“Good morning,
The second of Harry’s observations was the hair: or, more like, the lack thereof. Malfoy’s hair at Harry’s last visit had been a shining curtain of thick white-blond silk, practically begging to be brushed through or wound around one’s fist. All of that lovely long hair was gone, sheared off since Harry’s last visit. Now it was shaved short on the sides, and the longer hair on top was swept artfully to one side. Maybe his new haircut was why Malfoy was upset?
Harry laughed, long and loud, as tension leached from his body. “Thanks, Ron. That means a lot. Wouldn’t snog you either, but thanks.”
“Alright, I guess we have to do what the room wants,” Harry announced. “Er, what are all the bowls for?”
Scorpius grows jaded with the library’s book selection, so a mobile may very well be a good idea. If one so desired, where would one obtain such an item?
“Hurry up,” he whined.
“Of course,” Harry laughed as he shouldered his beloved burden again.
. It’s all about the lube.”
Entering Luxe was different from what Harry had anticipated. He had expected heavy dark wood and swathes of thick velvet, but the interior of Malfoy’s shop was charmingly modern. It felt like a breath of fresh air, done up as it was in shades of cream and grey. Modern art in muted tones shifted and danced on the walls, and the interior smelled pleasantly of cedar and lavender.
Still shaking with fury, Malfoy pressed his forehead against Harry’s and tried to take a deep breath. “Salazar, do you see to what you have reduced me? Damn you. If you haven’t figured it out by now, I’ll make you notice me.
“What? I didn’t see anything.”
After dinner, Harry raced back up to his dorm room and tore the Marauders Map from his trunk. He scanned it for Draco’s name, sifting through the hundreds and hundreds of people in Hogwarts, and couldn’t find his little dot on the map at all. Had Draco left?
P.S. This joke isn’t for Scorpius, just for you: your bed looks lonely. Can I Slytherin?
The witch cringed in horror, sparks shooting from her wand. “What? No! Just the soda, please.
“Harry, I stopped by the Owlery and look at all the presents!” Hermione called out gleefully, levitating a stack of paper-wrapped parcels through the portrait hole and neatly stacking them beneath the enormous Christmas tree in the corner.
“Oh of course,” Luna beamed. “It’s about time, too.”
After a few weeks of careful friendship, Malfoy invited Harry to the lake shore for a picnic. They met at the kitchens and coaxed the house elves into giving them a bulging hamper, replete with pastries, ice cold pumpkin juice, and interesting little sandwiches. Together they wandered the shore until they found a sunny spot under the boughs of a sweeping oak tree.
“You know, I’m ever so glad you decided to join me.” He smirked at Harry as he reached for the collar of his starched shirt. “Would you like to watch me disrobe, or would you prefer to turn and try to preserve my modesty? The former sounds far more entertaining...”
Harry thought for a minute. That seemed to make sense. “All right. I’m going to reject him.”
* * *
“Uh, bye,” Harry tossed over his shoulder as he practically ran back to the other Gryffindors. He personally never wanted to speak of this moment ever again. Neither did Ron, judging by the oddly green cast of his skin, but Hermione had other ideas.
me. A
Hermione finally finished her barrage of spells and sat back, looking rather like the niffler who got the gold. “Harry, there are
“You can leave now,” he said crossly. “No reply.” If an owl could scowl, this one certainly did. It chittered a bit and swooped back out through the cracked window. Draco settled back into the warm water and tried to banish the newfound tension in his muscles. Stupid Potter. Stupid Draco, as well. Replying to Potter previously had obviously only encouraged him; perhaps silence would better indicate his refusal to communicate.
“Dunno, Ron, but he’s definitely different lately.” Harry hesitated. “We’ve kind of decided to be friends? It’s a truce, anyway.”
Draco’s robe had puddled on the lush dining room carpet, leaving his delicious arse exposed in those tantalizing green knickers as he dropped it low. Merlin, Draco was gorgeous. Maybe he could ride him later, Draco’s cock buried deep in his arse, his legs still encased in those bloody stockings, moaning Harry’s name as that ridiculous silk robe creased beneath them. Harry wanted nothing more in the world, but had to quickly suppress thoughts like that or he knew he wouldn’t even make it through the rest of Draco’s performance. His boyfriend was sex appeal on long, lean legs, and he absolutely knew it.
Malfoy the Dragon Ferret,
The enclosed bracelet resembled a slender silver dragon made to coil about one’s forearm. The Malfoy crest, etched into a faceted emerald, nestled gently in its tail. Harry rolled up his shirt sleeve and tried on the bracelet, which magically adjusted to fit him perfectly. He admired how the silver gleamed against his tanned skin. He wasn’t much for jewelry, but this he could get used to.
If Ron had noticed Harry’s slight stutter, he was kind enough not to mention it. “Nah, but it’s usually involved, isn’t it? Eventually.”
I believe the word you’re searching for is
all the time, everyone’s, I dunno, friendly neighborhood saviour, and you can just be yourself. I might envy that a bit.”
“I remember. It’s the lake outside, right? I wonder where the squid is...are the merpeople in here real? They didn’t like me much before.” Long, shimmering tails undulated in the distant depths of the lake, barely grazing the expanse of kelp below.
Hermione scoffed and tugged at a long lock of bushy hair, making it even more frizzy than usual. “Tell that to Ron. He’s already trying to wheedle me into it. He even forgot a protection spell when we were--well--last week, and I’m not sure it wasn’t on purpose.”
The symptoms all added up, and his heart leapt in anticipation. He tried to focus on the pull, but the more he focused, the fainter it became.
style?" she asked skeptically, squinting up at the menu board behind the counter and tapping her chin with her wand.
“Even Weasley?”
“Wow,” Harry breathed. “I’ve never even heard of anything like that. I wonder if he’d let me study the house?”
McGonagall’s mouth twitched, either trying to suppress a laugh or a glare. “I appreciate your concern, Mr. Thomas, but I see no harm in it. It’s not as though they could incapacitate each other with a waltz. Come forth please, gentlemen, and decide who is to lead.”
Harry thought.
After what seemed like hours, Harry found him. At least, what was left of him. Draco’s crumpled form lay abandoned beside a trickling fountain. The husk that had once been his body lifted one fragile hand to Harry. Harry paused, then reached to take it, but--he had waited too long. Just as his fingertip brushed Draco’s, he began to disintegrate into dust. The last image Harry saw was confusion and anguish on Draco’s lovely pale face.
"--I can too, that was just a hard song--"
Harry rolled his eyes. “I want to see you too. I can’t be the only one that’s naked.”
purebloods.”
“Really?” Harry’s heart leapt. “I’m
Dusk had fallen when Harry finally emerged from his room. He scanned the eight year common room, wanting to avoid any curious eyes (especially grey ones), until he spotted his two best friends sitting beside the fireplace. Hermione sat primly in a large wing chair, which was worn with age but still irresistibly soft. Her knitting bag was at her side (it was constantly bulging with sharp little needles, which Harry always discovered by accidentally sitting on it). Her needles flashed in her hands as a long navy scarf inched its way into existence. Ron sat on a low velvet pouf at Hermione’s feet, his eyes crinkled with affection and good humor and his hands engaged in untangling a large skein of bulky, sunshine yellow yarn. The way he looked at her...Merlin, it almost made up for all the disgusting snuffling noises and uncomfortable bits of too-public affection that Harry had witnessed. Ron and Hermione were the very picture of contented domesticity, at least until Harry barged in.
“Hello?” he called out. “Ron! ‘Mione?”
“Right,” Harry said slowly, before he realized he was nose-to-nose with his strikingly handsome old enemy. He cleared his throat and stepped away. “Well, er, your home is a lot more active than most. And I’ve seen my fair share. If it’s alright with you, I’d like to return to study it further. How about Friday?”
“And?”
Seamus did indeed seem to be attempting to bend his spoon in half, despite Dean’s attempts to pry it out of his hand.
The taste itself wasn’t so bad, just a bit earthy, but trying to chew with the fuzz tickling his tongue was positively repulsive. Bile rose in Harry’s throat as he debated trying to swallow or spitting out the disgusting, hairy goop infesting his mouth.
So Harry slid on his tightest black jeans and a tank top that flaunted the glistening slide of his biceps. He knew what he had, and he knew how to show it off.
“Excellent, Louis. Say it that way to everyone, and we’ll have our first order in no time!”
Harry shook his head and stared at the hanks of yarn before him. Burnt umber, peacock blue, ash grey, pewter grey, fog grey… Grey, grey, grey. Just like Malfoy’s eyes. Not even pacing was enough to settle Harry’s mind anymore. Harry raked a hand through his hair and decided to go apologize to Malfoy. They did work across from each other now, and they weren’t school rivals anymore; they should keep a good working relationship.
Malfoy snapped out of his reverie, and his gaze caught on the dirty tray before Harry. The
While Harry had been staring at the room, Malfoy had apparently been staring at him. Harry glanced back at his host and he quickly looked away. His ears were very pink.
“It’s either that or murder. Go on, Malfoy. Cut me some flowers, so the manor won’t make me kill you," Harry smiled brightly at Malfoy and twirled his wand between his fingers.
but, whatever you need to talk about, we can.”
new personality when I returned after the war. It was throwing all the Dark artifacts and damaged furniture out the windows, and wanted to bury the items on the grounds in some kind of barbaric bespoke
“Owl when you’re ready for me, Potter. I’m very busy, but I’m sure I could fit you in.” Malfoy looked Harry up and down before smiling wickedly and pulling Rod after him back into Luxe. Harry huffed and strode back across the street. He waited until he’d returned inside to kick something, just in case Malfoy was watching.
“I am not
“I’m so glad it’s just you three,” Harry said, dropping his bulging bookbag on the floor and taking a seat. “You won’t have any questions about me and Malfoy, unlike literally everyone else in the whole school.”
Harry gulped his own tea and carefully set the dainty cup down on the table. It felt like it was about to break any minute, and the rug looked expensive. “So, about the house--”
“Come in, quickly now. Closer to the phonograph, there we go. I’d prefer not to shout,” McGonagall chided. “Thank you. As witches and wizards who will be mingling in society, it is imperative that you know how to conduct yourselves. It is normal for us to review these skills with graduating students, but due to the upcoming Yule Ball, it is particularly important that you know how to dance. Let us have two students exhibit a waltz for us.” She scanned the crowd of students before her for a moment. “Mr. Malfoy, and...Mr. Potter. Please come and demonstrate what you remember from our previous dance lesson.”
Harry, Ron and Hermione had again read Malfoy’s letter together. To Harry’s dismay, his friends didn’t seem to be disgusted or suspicious at all. He half-wondered if Malfoy was trying to court him or his best friends.
Dragon Heart, the next part of Dragon Mate, will begin posting in a couple of weeks.
“Yeah, let’s go.” Harry nodded. They had almost made it safely to the entryway when the floor rippled, causing Harry to stumble into Malfoy. He probably would have fallen directly onto the very hard parquet if Malfoy hadn’t reached out his arms and caught him. As willowy and, well,
Hermione glanced at him, crumpling her napkin nervously in her lap. “How long are you here this time, Harry? Until Christmas, maybe?”
“I think we did pretty well. Cheers, Malfoy!”
Ron shrugged. “Probably just sulking down in the dungeons. He’ll be back tomorrow, mouthy as ever.”
Draco seemed very satisfied by the full-body shiver that ran down Harry’s spine. “You’re staring at me like I’m an enraged veela in Lovegood’s absurd leonine hat. Come here, Harry. I don’t bite.”
The man turned a pale green and ran out the door as fast as his polished wingtips could take him. As the teen working the register sighed and scrubbed one hand against his sweaty forehead, Draco Malfoy slid out of the shadows. His three-piece designer suit seemed entirely incongruous with the image of a fast food manager, but the orange and black applique at his breast proclaimed him a proud member of the Spideys team.
“Sorry, what?”
Hermione tapped her chin gently with the letter as she thought. “Meaning, let me think...hmm. Black usually means death, but it can also mean a new beginning. Jasmine’s a bit easier; it means affection and,” she coughed delicately, “sensuality.”
Harry reminded himself. “What high praise. More for me, then.” He shrugged and took another large bite.
He was tempted to start dry-heaving right on the street. Just as he was leaning over to do so, dragonhide boots scraping against the cobblestones, another thought came to mind:
Draco smirked and prowled up the bed to meet Harry. He gave one long, lazy kiss. When Harry tried to force it into more, Draco pinned Harry’s shoulders to the bed and slid back down until his mouth was delectably close to Harry’s cock. He stuck out his perfectly pink tongue and licked one long stripe up its length, watching Harry’s intoxicated expression with hooded eyes. At Harry’s pleased moan, Draco took his cock ever so slowly into his mouth. Draco’s lips had been velvet-soft, but his mouth felt even better. Inch by inch, he engulfed Harry into wet heat until the tip hit the back of his throat. He sucked hard, humming all the while, as the vibration and sensations drove Harry mad.
Once Potter’s words had fully processed, Draco flinched. “You
“You remember our house-elf Dobby, don’t you?” Malfoy’s mouth made a slight moue of displeasure. “The one you
Hermione waved a hand irritably. “As well as can be expected. You know how attached wixen are to the subjugation of house elves. I hope bringing house elves into the legal office as full employees will turn out well, but it’s certainly an uphill road for the time being.”
“Jesus fuck! You’re so fucking tight!” He hissed, struggling to hold me in place now as I began to writhe and arch under him. “I’m so fucking deep in you, you’re not going to be able to walk for a week.”
“Fuck baby you’re good at that.” I gasped. He smirked, quirking an eyebrow at me as if to ask if I just figured that one out. I shook my head and laughed, placing a quick kiss on his lips before I sank to my knees to return the favor.
“That’s fucking it Malfoy!” He growled threateningly. “I’m going to fuck you so hard Hogwarts will have to buy a new bed frame.” He slid his dick up and down inside my crack— the excess lube making the friction feel wonderful for both of us— in what an outside observer would have thought was preparation. Having been his lover for so long I knew that he was surreptitiously giving me a chance to object if I wanted to be prepared more. Potter had a huge cock. The kind that you see and half want to sit on, half want to cry because you know it would hurt like a bitch. We were both well aware that two fingers was not nearly enough to get me fully ready for that monster and that if he entered me now the stretch would be intense and it would hurt. Most days he and I both loved that, him getting off on taking me relatively unprepared and me liking the combination of pleasure and pain he could bring me. Still, Potter always asked. Even if it was in a way like now that didn’t ruin the game of dominance we liked to play.
“Nah,” Harry shrugged from behind his dog-eared copy of
Zabini was already there when they arrived, unlacing his complicated robes. He hadn’t worn a shirt underneath, so each tug at the burgundy cord revealed another centimeter of satiny dark skin. Studying him, Harry realized he had never really thought much about Blaise Zabini before. Always lingering in the back of Harry’s school memories, shrouded behind Draco’s blustering, sharp-edged presence, Zabini was rather an unknown quantity.
Your son sounds great. I bet we’d get along well. And I suppose I could’ve just Googled what Cendrillon was, but I wanted to bait you into replying. Giving you the chance to insult me never fails.
Draco,
An awkward silence lingered between them, until Harry broke it. “Were you going flying too, then? Want to go together?” he asked gruffly, avoiding eye contact.

“Oi, Malfoy! I need your potions analysis for the Kemperton case--oh. Didn’t realize you had company. ‘Lo, Parkinson.” Pansy Parkinson sat perched on the edge of Malfoy’s ostentatious desk, one long dark lock twined around her finger. Ron assumed she’d popped over for lunch with Malfoy; her work at Witch Weekly didn’t usually bring her to the Ministry. Merlin, her legs seemed to go on for days. Ron remained trapped in the intricate pattern of her lacy stockings until he remembered where he was, jerking his face back up to Malfoy’s. He was as pointy and well-groomed as ever, and somehow not distracted by Parkinson’s legs at all.
Malfoy flinched and took a step back. “Potter. I understand you’re upset. I would like to apologize for my unseemly behavior. However, there are some extenuating circumstances I should explain--”
It wasn’t until he’d shaken Malfoy’s hand, said his goodbyes, and was a hundred yards away that it hit him: he’d agreed to go out on a date with
Ron guffawed, his pint glass clinking back onto the table as he was surprised into good humor. “No, but we still talk about this bracelet every bloody week. Think about when ‘Mione and I broke up eighth year: it was awful for a few weeks, but then we talked about it and felt a lot better. Closure and all. Maybe it would actually stay away if you returned it to the ferret in person?”
Harry was so excited he thought he might puke. A romantic dinner awaited him, with the man of his (literal) dreams. Hopefully meeting his boyfriend wouldn’t always feel as stomach-churning as it did now, but he really couldn’t be sure.
-John Clare, “Home”
“Harry?”
Potter knew Draco couldn't possibly care less, yet on he went.
Harry scowled and shook his head as if trying to shake out all his thoughts and leave his mind smooth and empty. Empty sounded nice. He knew he would just get tangled up in his own thoughts again if he stayed here on the ground. He needed his broom.
no matter how pretty he was. So Harry needed to get thoroughly fucked. He needed to get over Malfoy by getting under someone else. Such a cliche, but Harry hoped it was true. He didn’t know what else to do at this point.
Fire pricked in Draco’s veins, urging him on. “Yes. I will do what I must to find my mate.”
& & &
“Since when do you know how to make flower crowns, Malfoy?”
“What the fuck, Harry! Warn a bloke first,” Ron sputtered. “Are you sure that’s what you saw? We always knew Malfoy'd be a Keeper, not a Beater. He owns a fashion boutique, for Merlin's sake."
Smith smirked and tightened his grip on Harry’s shoulder. “Go ahead then. I’d like to see you try. Death Eater scum, you shouldn’t be talking to him anyway.”
, Draco. You and me, we’re still such a new thing, and you know how important Hermione is to me. If we’re still together next year, I’ll spend Christmas with you then, alright?”
“Gardenias,” Malfoy announced with a pleased sniff. He started to say more, but at that moment, one of the glass-paned walls began to tremble. It split and retracted into a million dazzling pieces and reformed into an opaque glass door.
I meant every word. I really have fancied you for years, even if it took me ages to realize it. You’re still as sharp as you always were, but now you’re trying to make me laugh and caring about what I think. You’ve raised your son beautifully; he’s lovely, and you are so tender with him. And your legs are fantastic. Won’t you give me a chance?
The one where Harry is a jerk.
“Like that, don’t you? Do you like my big cock up your arse, Harry?” He chuckled as Harry gasped and clenched around him. “You like it when I talk dirty, don’t you.”
Despite the awkward conversation they’d provoked, Harry was impossibly grateful that Draco had sent him those dress robes (though he’d never admit it to his face). For once, he rather liked what he saw as he dressed for the Yule Ball.
Harry nodded, and Draco Apparated them to his flat. He would’ve liked to look around some, but all he could see and feel was Draco. He steered them through a doorway, kissing and fumbling all the while, and up a few stairs before pressing Harry onto a four-poster bed.
“It was all wonderful! I never even knew Muggles collected and studied such wonderful things!” Draco’s eyes were wide and excited, his hair tousled and askew. “Did you know, we only have the slightest idea of what dinosaurs looked like. For all we know, they might have had hair, or even feathers! Like that great big beast of a hippogriff…” he grumbled into his drink.
The very next evening, Draco was trying to enjoy his bath when the same hyperactive little owl tapped on his window. Of course Potter would contact him after business hours, how uncouth. It was downright rude.
Hermione pursed her lips. “Well, actually--”
A wizard who seemed to be the proprietor stood behind the counter with his back to Harry as he spoke quietly to a cheerful employee. Harry admired the man’s slim-cut gray Muggle suit. Merlin, the man’s shoulders were so broad, but it was tailored perfectly to them. Watching the muscles below the cloth flex and tense minutely was intoxicating. The suit made his legs seem to stretch for miles, and the man’s arse was
“It is, welcome to Spideys! Can we get you anything, perhaps a spot of lunch?” Harry thought he said the name very strangely. Then again, on the scale of weird things happening just in the last thirty seconds, pronunciation was at the very bottom of the list.
Harry studied the tawny barn owl next to him. She was quietly preening her feathers and did not seem frightening at all. He shrugged and shook out a bag of owl treats on his kitchen table. The owl stared at him quizzically before abandoning all caution and diving right in. Harry chuckled. He would send her back to Malfoy, fat, happy, and without any answer at all. He could’ve replied, but he was lost on what to say.
(See the end of the chapter for
anymore. You just see your mate.”
. What meaning was he even
Hermione sighed. “I’ve suspected something strange was happening for some time now. With the way Malfoy’s been acting lately, and how off you’ve been feeling. So I decided to do some research.” She flicked her wand, and a pile of old books flew from the girls’ dormitory. The door smoothly opened to admit the books and they landed on the desk beside Harry’s bed with a dusty
fine--” Unfortunately, just as the front door closed behind Harry, it disappeared from existence. So did all the other doors Harry could see, each fading into the wall one after another. Only one solid gold door, carved with ominous sigils, remained.
Harry strode right to the edge of the lake before finally halting and dropping his school bag on the icy ground. He breathed hard for a moment, studying the choppy grey waters of the lake. He had no clue what to do next.
Now Draco’s eyes became serious, his hands tightening on Harry’s waist. “What if we don’t do anything? What if I just want to spend more time with you before my departure?”
Harry stepped back. “Look, this isn't real. It’s just a dream. It’s just in my head.”
Harry glanced at the door, and back at Malfoy. "I'm still up for that bath if you are."
Want to hear a joke about paper? Never mind, it’s tearable.
“Not again,” Harry grumbled. He had thought the gifts were over. He had been courted successfully, that requirement or ego trip or whatever it was had been fulfilled, and everyone could move on with their lives. But shortly after he’d agreed to attend the Yule Ball with Draco, another large white gift box waited for him on his messy bed, a crisply folded note resting on top. It read:
He turned, unwilling to see rejection or fear on Malfoy’s face, and continued undressing. He let his shirt fall from his shoulders and toed off his shoes. His jeans followed, puddling on the floor of the bathroom. It had been some time since he’d been naked before anyone else, so Harry removed his pants after a deep breath and stepped quickly into the tub. He settled into the bath with a sigh, warm ripples of water lapping at his skin. Lemon and orange and bliss perfumed the water, though Harry couldn’t imagine how the house had managed to put pure contentment in a bath bomb.
Unfortunately, Draco didn’t come down to breakfast the next day, either. Or the third day. He wasn’t in classes, or at any other meals either. Harry tried to ask Zabini about Draco’s whereabouts in Potions, but he gazed right through Harry as though he weren’t there at all. Greg was no better: he loudly announced he had to go to the toilet and lumbered out of the classroom as though being chased by an angry hippogriff.
“Well? What is your,” his mouth quirked into a smile, despite his obvious nerves, “your professional opinion?”
“Potter, I’m taller. I’ll lead.” Harry shrugged in agreement, knowing he wasn’t a good enough dancer to try leading anyway. He jumped as a firm hand circled his waist and came to rest on his back. Merlin, Malfoy’s hand was warm. Harry felt its heat seep through his whole body.
* * *
"So it is about the sex for you then." It wasn't a question.
“Potter, this would be far more satisfying in a bed. Come to mine, my bed is bigger.”
“Get out unless you want me to hex you into next week. I don’t share.”
Draco set down his wine glass without a sound and folded his hands elegantly in his lap. “Of course I am listening, Potter. It is only polite to do so.”
“Hmm. What happened next?”
Harry was beginning to feel the strain of keeping his hands to himself. He was dying to drag his teeth across the vast expanse of creamy skin exposed before him, even to lick just one pink, pink nipple. His arms shook with effort and his heart beat so quickly it was verging on uncomfortable. Was it even possible for wizards to have heart attacks? Harry had no clue, but he knew something awful would happen if he didn’t get his hands on Draco
She laughed, a bright, tinkling thing. “Darling, you know you love being one of my drunken monkeys.” She glanced back toward Ron, still standing frozen in the doorway. “And so will Weasley. Take your report and go, then; we’ll see you tonight.”
it. He threw caution to the wind and did what he could to kiss Malfoy back.
Draco rolled his eyes, a motion that seemed as natural for him as breathing. "For the love of… please shut your stupid, lovely mouth and let me finish my question before our beards are as long and grey as Dumbledore's." Harry shrugged and waved one hand about as if to convey that if anyone would be interrupting, it wouldn't be him, no sirree.
Hermione’s shoulders relaxed when she heard she was to room with Hannah Abbott, and Harry sighed with relief when he heard his name paired with Ron’s. It wasn’t as though he’d expected anyone to curse him in his sleep, but he had enough changes to worry about without having a hostile roommate. For a moment he wondered what it would have been like to share  with Malfoy, to trust his rival enough to sleep in his presence, to see Malfoy shirtless or even nude...but then he shoved that image away with both metaphorical hands. He was bent, but he was definitely not even remotely interested in Draco Malfoy.
unacceptable, and the offending party ought to be severely punished, but that trying to punish a house would be futile.
A smile broke through the mask of restraint that was his mother’s face. “What wonderful news, Draco. I had thought it possible for your magic to repress its mating instinct due to stress, but I did not want to give you false hope. I am relieved to have been correct. Who is she?”
his mind screamed. Suddenly, without quite knowing how, Malfoy was now flat on his belly on the ground, with Harry’s knee in the small of his back and a wand at his throat.
Ron choked on his pumpkin juice. “Merlin’s saggy jockstrap, Malfoy wants to shag you. I think my breakfast is coming back up…” He hobbled off holding his stomach, presumably to find the nearest loo.
again.
“We’re coming, ‘Mione. It’s just, a bloke never wants to embarrass himself in front of the whole year, y’know? Hopefully I don’t have to dance with McGonagall this time,” Ron rolled his eyes again. He’d been doing that all morning.
Harry had had quite enough and lobbed a flowery blue cotton apron in the blond’s general direction. “Shove it. Put on an apron, you can be my helper.”
Yours, Harry
First off, hang it all, Draco Malfoy was
“And as I’m sure you’re aware, I do not. Are you
P.P.S. This joke is the only one so far that requires a response. And isn’t a joke. You do seem lonely. And I rather fancy you, I have for years. Please write back quickly.
as Malfoy looked, the arms holding Harry were sure.
“They wouldn’t if you cared for them properly,” Hermione reminded him, exhaustion dripping from each word.
...I’m going to
Draco sniffed disdainfully and endeavored to stand up straight. He failed, of course, and slumped back against Harry’s side. “You can’t expect anything less. I am a Malfoy after all. Standards to uphold and all that.”
ed and threw open the lid of the gift box. Pistachio green dress robes gleamed lustrous within, accompanied by black dress shoes, an impossibly soft set of black trousers, and the crispest white shirt Harry had ever seen.
Draco’s jaw tightened. He looked like a madman, all disarrayed hair and white face, but his eyes were the clearest Harry had seen in a long time. “If you insist. Fine.” He turned on his heel and stalked away, muttering under his breath all the while.
Unexpectedly, Draco was a bit of a lightweight. One pint in, his speech began to slur. A visible flush crept over his pale cheeks after the second. Three pints later, Draco’s hand was heavy and solid on Harry’s leg.
Draco let his hand fall.
“Oh...well, did you like it?”
Harry Potter is perfectly able to take care of himself. But he likes it best when Draco cares for him.
ed to the floor as Draco struggled to sit up. Pain twisted and wracked his body as his bones lengthened and his muscles roiled. Innocuous scents he had long dismissed became impossible to ignore. His skin itched and burned as it stretched over the new contours of his body. Even his magical core writhed, deep within, as he became something strange and other. All he saw was shades of green and flame. Heat exploded around Draco’s eyes, and a strangled scream ripped from his throat. He lay sweating and burning on his bed, waiting for death.
Harry scoffed and tried not to flinch. He pulled his hand from hers and placed it back on his pint. That was a safe place, where no one could feel his pulse jump at the very mention of Malfoy. “Course. What feelings? I don’t talk about him anymore at all, haven’t seen him in years.”
The ink was beginning to run on the parchment clenched in Harry’s clammy hand.
“You like me best that way, admit it,” Harry said, sticking out his tongue.
His short lifetime of loneliness had been bearable because he had clung to the thought of finding his mate.
Long-dead hurt rose thorny and dark in Draco’s throat, choking him and stopping his breath. “Really, Potter? I know that our...tryst did not end well, but I’ve done as you asked since then and maintained my distance. Remember, you were the one who rejected me.
Harry thought, his cheeks flushing as heated memories came to mind. It was a nice feeling; it had been years since he’d felt truly warm.
“Must you? Well, if the Golden Boy calls.” Pansy groaned theatrically, but followed Harry outside the Great Hall all the same.
Neon lights slid lazily across the dance floor, highlighting a buff redhead here, a mesh shirt there. The air was thick with sweat and glitter. It wasn’t one of the nicer clubs, but Harry didn’t want nice tonight. He wanted someone who would slap and bite and thrust and leave. Despite the packed dance floor, pickings were slim tonight. Everyone else already had a partner. Harry sat at the bar and nursed his drink, glaring at the couples on the floor.
Harry screwed on his best smile and said, “Morning, Malfoy. Did you get my owl telling you about my visit?”
, more, yes,” was all that Harry could manage, but Draco seemed satisfied. He started thrusting even harder, snapping his hips into Harry at an earth-shattering rate. It was rough and exactly what he needed.
“Oh! There they are, come on.” Harry made a beeline for where Ron, Hermione, Luna, and Neville stood surveying the ball. Draco grumbled as he was tugged along by his (outrageously expensive) sleeve, but Harry knew he was only protesting on principle.
“Haven’t you ever heard of being fashionably late, Weasley? No wonder no one ever invites you anywhere, you’re terribly gauche,” Draco observed, flat gray eyes scanning the group.
Malfoy finally looked at Harry then, those sharp gray eyes almost wistful for once. “Please, Harry. I swear I shan’t touch you. But there are several things I must explain.”
“Checking for something?” Harry asked.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. "Wait, formerly? I thought we were together! Proper couple and all that--"
(See the end of the chapter for
said you did not want
“Is that right?” Harry asked, stepping closer.
Harry huffed, but Draco only took a few more moments to prepare him.
“My French is really only conversational,” Hermione rolled her eyes, obviously irked by this fact, “so I wrote to Fleur and asked her for words that sounded like
Draco was absolutely taking Harry apart, and Harry could feel himself becoming more undone with each thrust. Draco was all that he could feel; he was in him and around him and of him. Excruciating pleasure thrummed in Harry’s veins and made him come alive.
“I know what I saw, Ron. Malfoy’s definitely the Beater, at least sometimes. The big bloke he was with was an absolute mess. But in the best way...” Harry trailed off as he recalled the animation in Malfoy’s face. He had been strong and punishing and relentlessly alive.
Harry huffed out a laugh and stuffed the robes back into the box, his heart still racing a bit from the scare. “Yeah, I guess. I’ll buy you some as long as we never talk about Draco’s pants again.”
Draco frowned. “I don’t know who they are. I feel them, but it’s terribly faint. The more I focus on it, the more I fear it will disappear. I do know that they were thinking of Hogwarts…” His eyes cleared, and he laid one hand on hers. “Mother. I know that this was not our intention, but I have to return. I have to find them.”
“Think it’s big enough for me to even feel?” I shot back.
I hissed at the twinge in my scalp as he jerked my head back painfully using the hand he had wrapped firmly in my hair, exposing my throat as he bit down on the junction of my neck and shoulder roughly.
“Try me.” I challenged boldly, knowing he wouldn’t, as I drifted off to sleep.
“Come on Potter, you can do better!” I goaded him. “I had better fucks in 4
year!”
“Fuck, that’s hot.” He hissed as his free hand made quick work of my own pants. “As much as I’d love to fuck you on the counter love, we don’t exactly have the time for that.” He murmured, moving me so that I was on the edge of the counter and dropping to his knees between my legs. The height was so perfect I almost wondered if Harry had done this kind of thing before, his head was in the perfect position to take my cock into his mouth and the view it gave me was spectacular. I could see both his red swollen lips stretch to fit around my length and his lust filled eyes as they flashed up at me from underneath the messy fringe of his bangs. That alone was almost enough to make me cum and I moaned loudly and fisted a hand roughly in his hair as he took me in quickly all the way to the hilt. He hummed and swallowed around me in response to my moan and quickly began to bob up and down, using the flat of his tongue on every downward motion and taking extra care to lick the slit whenever he came to the head of my cock. Harry was fabulous at blowjobs and it didn’t take long until he was swallowing around me while I came explosively down his throat.
I’ll take care of everything. You need only attend.”
Malfoy’s fine-boned face is constantly present in
A shadow of grief darkened Hermione’s face. "No, actually. I restored my parents' memories, but the only way to avoid permanent brain damage was to do it gradually. They only remembered sending me off to Hogwarts in first year a few weeks ago, so they would be rather confused if an adult woman came home for the holidays rather than their twelve year old daughter.” She sniffed, and a watery smile took over her face. “Besides, one last Christmas at Hogwarts sounds rather cheery, doesn’t it?"
Luminous grey eyes studied Harry, making him feel rather like a mouse about to be consumed whole by a snake. It was not a feeling that he entirely disliked.
Harry was quite ready to go to bed. His limbs drifted with fatigue, weighed down by his leaden feet, pinched in the awful dress shoes Draco had selected. Even as exhausted as Harry was, he rather thought he’d like a bit of a snog behind a tapestry before he bade Draco good night. His boyfriend should be rewarded in some way by wearing those striking robes, right?
Harry coughed as he tumbled through the Floo into Ron and Hermione’s sitting room. The ash always caught in his throat and his knees seemed bent on making a graceful landing impossible. He brushed the soot from his jeans and glanced around. The sconces on the wall were lit and Crookshanks blinked grumpily at him from his cat tree, but his friends didn’t seem to be anywhere.
I had a great time this weekend. Couldn’t believe how fast the time went, though. Scorp is lovely, and the smile on your face when you talk to him breaks my heart with happiness.
“Louis?” Draco shouted. “We need to make some flyers!”
Harry sat waiting up for hours in the common room, just in case. No owl arrived, and Malfoy seemed to have made himself scarce. Ron and Hermione tried to keep him company, but Hermione began to nod over the thick tome on her lap and Ron helped her to her room. When the embers of the dying fire began to swim before Harry’s eyes, he decided to pack it in and go to bed. Harry eased the door open slowly, in an attempt not to wake a sleeping Ron. The grating snores didn’t cease, so Harry tiptoed to his side of the room.
“No, Blaise. It is spin the bottle, but you mustn't kiss anyone. At least, one is not required to do so. The chosen person has to perform a song for whoever the bottle lands on, expressing their true feelings towards that person.” She leaned over and tapped the karaoke machine with her wand. “Starting now. Who’d like to go first?”
“Hmm. Alright then…” Potter grinned and went on, weaving a tale about gum disease and secret informants that was surprisingly captivating. Draco listened carefully, asking questions in all the right places and seriously considering subscribing to the
Somehow, after only two weeks back at Hogwarts, Ron and Hermione had become too much to bear. They’d technically been together since May, but staying at the Burrow under Mrs. Weasley’s watchful eye kept everyone’s hands exactly where they ought to be (at least in Harry’s opinion). At Hogwarts, all bets were off.
Harry emerged and Draco’s deft fingers quickly adjusted the leather straps comfortably around Harry’s thigh. He bent a bit to test it, and it moved and flexed right along with him. The leather harness wrapped protectively around Harry’s thick thigh, almost like a second skin.
“Did you have enough to eat? Are you sure you wouldn’t care for more? There’s a divine pate I don’t believe you sampled...” Draco said, rifling through the hamper and finally summoning a small glass jar to his hand.
For the first time in years, Draco
Harry sighed in relief as he took a seat on a long velvet soft and got out his quill and ink. “This room should stay the same size. What with all the bookshelves, it’s harder for the walls to sneak up on us.”
? We don’t do that.”
Neville nodded, his tongue sticking out of his mouth as he worked on a very detailed botanical drawing of some plant or other. Something with lots of tendrils that one would not like to come across in a dark forest. (At least, anyone but Neville.)
Harry wasn’t entirely sure of the welcome he’d receive at Malfoy Manor, so he decided it best not to Floo right in. He Apparated to the house’s approximate location and landed with one foot in a rather boggy pond. Sludgy pondweed choked its surface, and a frog looked downright murderous at having its home disturbed. Harry was not pleased either. After a healthy bout of swearing, he dried his foot and whispered
Harry scrabbled around for his lost goblet and held it out for a refill. Hermione happily obliged.
"What is
Three things seemed to happen simultaneously: Malfoy spat sizzling sparks at Smith’s hand, Smith cried out in pain, and Harry found himself whipped over Malfoy’s shoulder firefighter style as Malfoy
Several hours later, Harry was pacing. This was nothing new; Kreacher had had to replace the hall runner twice, and complained about it to anyone who would listen. So Harry had taken to pacing in his shop instead, his heavy steps rattling the wobbly table on which the register rested.
“I can feel the life leaving my body…” Malfoy groaned.
A pillow
“I don’t even want to know where you learned to do that, but it’s
. So I can measure you properly. Trousers too. No need to worry, it’s a private room. No one but me will see our Saviour’s abs.” From Malfoy’s mouth, it sounded less like a reassurance and more like a threat. But surely that was just Harry’s imagination.
Incidentally, he adored your joke. It reduced him to uninhibited giggles for a full four minutes. I shouldn’t be surprised that he found your childish sense of humor utterly appealing.
while he’s strutting around the fucking foyer…”
“And, I suppose I rather like having you around. Teasing you these last few weeks has been the most fun I’ve had in years.”
?” Malfoy asked, glancing at Harry’s cold face with worried eyes. “The common room is ridiculously cacophonous right now, but we could always return to my room and cast a
Dream-Malfoy’s eyes sharpened, resembling his corporeal self much more. “Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But even if this is not real...it has the potential to be.” The image before Harry’s eyes faded as he felt himself waking. Soon he was back in his red-curtained four-poster, Ron snoring behind him and more confused than ever.
Awe softened Malfoy’s pointy face as followed Harry and stared out at the vast Quidditch pitch. “Well. This certainly wasn’t previously part of the manor. I may have to see about having one installed, it’s fantastic.” He was too entranced to notice the door behind him disappearing with a faint
Harry cocked his head to the side. “Hmm. And why would it want to keep me here?”
However, he somehow ended up doing none of those things. Harry visited Teddy, and let Molly cluck over how thin he was, and practically blew his eyebrows off product testing with Ron, but throughout it all Harry was thinking of only one thing: Draco Malfoy. And his house, of course. It was just returning to such an interesting and attractive
Potter’s eyes stared deeply into Draco’s. He felt like a small animal caught in a trap, unable to escape that green glow. “I want a second chance. I want six months of your time for us to love each other again. If after that time, you don’t want to see me anymore, I’ll accept your choice.”
Malfoy,
“So? You are the Chosen One, Harry. I doubt they’d begrudge you a single bath.”
“Come on, Harry! It’s the headmistress, you’re not getting out of this one,” Hermione reminded him.
“At least the punch is potable. As we are at a ball...Harry, may I have this dance?” Draco asked with a courtly bow.
“Hello, Pippy,” Luna said, winding one long blond lock around her finger. “Could you do us a favor and put these in Harry Potter’s room for us?”
“They? Hmm.” Narcissa pursed her lips, the rest of her face remaining still and solemn. “Yes, I know how you must feel. But it will be challenging for you to resume your education after the...choices our family made during the war. And the more time you spend around your mate without completing the bond, the more instinctual and volatile you will become. More like a true dragon every day,
Harry threw open the door and breezed in, broomstick thrown jauntily over one shoulder. “Hi Ron, it’s bloody freezing out--oh, hi, ‘Mione. Are you already all packed then?”
A soft whimper escaped from down the hall. Could that be Malfoy? He must have been in trouble or being shagged; either way, Harry had to see. He snuck down the hall, readying his wand as he peeked inside the room. He did see Malfoy, but not at all in the way he’d expected.
Harry stifled a groan as she tugged him into the Great Hall, Ron trudging along behind them. He’d tried to stay behind in the common room, but she had threatened to petrify and levitate him in “or so help me, Harry, I will ensure that you fail all your NEWTS and never get a proper job.” By Hermione’s standards this was a very serious threat indeed, so Harry had settled for some half-hearted complaining and grudgingly followed Hermione out of the portrait hole.
“Are you sure? He’s quite good. You looked a bit confused, but happy.”
means, right?”
It was a time for action. So Harry decided on the action of actually doing his homework for once. Procrastination wasn’t procrastination if one was doing schoolwork, right? And people weren’t supposed to talk in the library at all. He would sit and quietly finish his Charms essay for Flitwick and not think of anything else.
“Oh, and Teddy and Victoire are adorable together!” Potter continued. “They act like they’re not best friends, but the moment one of them is in trouble, the other would die for them. They’re going to cause so much trouble when they get to Hogwarts.” He guffawed before glancing at Draco quietly sipping his wine. He had ordered steak tartare, while Potter, the barbarian, had attempted to order fish and chips from the children’s menu. Luckily the mustachioed server had redirected him to the shepherd’s pie. “Are...are you not listening to me?”
Malfoy counted down for them. Harry knew when it was time to move, but he stepped forward and their bodies collided awkwardly and Harry trod on one of Malfoy’s long feet.
Pansy’s chosen web was deceptively innocent, indeed. Karaoke was fairly new to the wizarding world, so she was able to reserve them a private room at Siren’s Song with only a small bribe. The room was very pleasant, littered with squashy floor pillows in muted colors and intimate settees. A shelf of snacks, soju, and other liquors lined the back wall. The hostess witch led them in and showed them how to work the Muggle machine before leaving. The rest of the group seemed quite happy to slouch on sofas and chat quietly, but that wasn’t at all why they had come. Since she had been the one to invite everyone, Pansy strutted up to the small stage to kick off the night.
Regrettably, Malfoy was pants at baking. He confused the salt for the sugar not once but thrice and attempted to put the biscuits in the oven in one giant ball.
Ugh, he barely looked human anymore. Draco retreated back to his hastily-made nest to try to process what had just happened. He was still in one piece, even if that piece now looked very odd. And at least one part of the experience had been pleasant. He closed his eyes, trying to recall the voice he had heard, but he only felt something like a cool breeze as the presence left his mind. He sensed something sweet and sharp, like pastry and fire.
The last strains of the waltz faded slowly, and the phonograph came to a staticky halt. The room trembled slightly, as though holding its breath, until McGonagall’s familiar Scottish brogue broke the silence. “Well done, Mr. Malfoy. Mr. Potter, a bit more work and you’ll make someone a fine dancing partner.”
Draco pursed his lips and spoke very, very slowly. "Let me see if I understand you correctly. You would like to know what I, your formerly secret lover--"
Draco grinned, rosy and gorgeous against the pale, luxurious sheets he favored. "I did. I've had that ensemble picked out for a week now. I knew you’d ask eventually."
“Thank you for your glowing vote of confidence,” Pansy groused, rolling her eyes. Glamorously, of course, as she did everything.
Harry wanted to shag his boyfriend into the carpet right there, but he shut his gaping mouth and tried to chuckle casually. “As much as I like the outfit, this is already unrealistic. I don’t think you’d wear this to karaoke.”
Malfoy finally smiled, meaning Harry had probably just made an enormous fool of himself.. “You want me to be your boyfriend, Potter? A bit of a surprise, but I wouldn’t say no. That’s what
Harry was speechless. He didn’t really need the money, but having the Ministry fund his research was a huge sign of trust. Hermione’s thoughtful actions meant the world to him, especially if it meant he could stay in England and sample Ron’s culinary experiments regularly. Maybe this would be enough, at least for the time being.
Malfoy scoffed and glared daggers at the walls. “Malfoy Manor, of course. It’s a bit of a mouthful when one is in the midst of a scolding. Now you see here, Mal--"
fit, and the snogging is--anyway, then I get all cold and mad and Draco ends up with a black eye or bat bogeys or something.” He laughed shakily. “Kinda decided it’s just safer to not do much more than kiss.”
to vex me?” Draco drawled in his most obscenely posh voice. He was well-aware that Potter hated that voice, but if Draco was to be so annoyed, his pursuer was to be as well.
--and he called me his sodding
Joking, Draco. Unfurrow your brow before I have to come fix it for you. You’re much more handsome when you smile.
he thought.
“Quite,” Malfoy sniffed and perched on the sofa across from Harry’s. “We can discuss the manor now if you’d like. What questions did you have, Potter?”
Were you aware that Muggles have public libraries? Anyone can march in off the street and peruse the literature to their heart’s content. Obviously not everyone can possess a collection as impressive as the one at the Manor, but this may very well be the next best thing. My son Scorpius insists that the books in our library do not have enough pictures, so he has now thrice dragged me to the Muggle library near our home. After far too many hours of listening to a woman in a sparkly hat read agonizing fairy tales to squirming children (why are they agonizing, you ask? There’s no
“Listen to me for once, Draco. The way you treat me, I don’t think you really see
Harry’s breath caught in his throat. “D-do that again,” he stuttered.
“Yes, mum,” Harry teased, sticking out his tongue.
Hermione, entirely unruffled, only raised a hand. “It’s usually not, but I haven’t finished. That’s not all. While I was in the library, I also researched the Malfoys. It’s mainly old lore, far too old to be trustworthy, but--well, Harry, there’s something you need to know about their family.” She pulled one of the tomes from the pile, flipping through it until she found the correct page.
Draco-
“Lock…” I muttered against his lips as I stretched my arm as far as it would go to bat the lock of the door closed. That done I once more pushed apart his robes and attacked the button on his pants. I popped it open and yanked down the zipper so I could free him from both the offensive slacks and the boxers he wore underneath. I literally fucking whimpered when his thick length sprang free. The sound would have been embarrassing if not for the growl it produced from deep in Harry’s throat.
“You shouldn’t have teased me this morning, I told you I couldn’t wait.” He snorted a laugh and then suddenly placed his hands on my hips and lifted me clear off my feet.
“Easy Malfoy.” He said somewhat gently, picking me up bridal style and carrying me to my bed. I didn’t respond, remaining boneless and staying listlessly where he put me on the bed while he did all the work cleaning us both up. When he finally came back to bed I managed to find the energy to mutter:
His hand suddenly wrapping around my cock made my effort to keep silent all for naught as it forced a gasp from my lips anyway. He chuckled, proud of himself for eliciting such a noise.

“You said you couldn’t wait so…” And with that he was walking us the few feet to the bathroom and pushing open the door with his back. He spun as soon as we were in the door and placed me on the counter, shoving me backwards forcefully so that my back slammed against the mirror and he was positioned directly between my legs. His carefully placed hand behind the back of my head kept me from smashing it against the mirror as he roughly crashed his lips to mine and captured my mouth in a demanding, passionate kiss. His other hand kneaded my thigh firmly as my hands reached up and tangled in his hair, pulling harshly as I rocked myself against him, using him as leverage to slide myself back and forth across the counter. Despite how rough he was being the hand cradling my head never tightened its grip, the gentleness and caring reassuring me that this was Harry and that he would never hurt me.
“Oh, I can keep it Malfoy.” He promised as he pushed into me in one long, fluid stroke. I bit my lip hard and clenched my hands into fists, dropping my head to the mattress as he stretched me obscenely around him. It hurt, that was for sure, and I had the brief sensation of being cleaved in two, my muscles fighting hard to accept him as he just kept coming and coming, forcing his way into my tight channel and battering against my walls. I fought to control my breathing and not make a sound or tense up, refusing to give him any kind of upper hand. Once he was fully seated in me he paused, his broad hands stroking up and down my back and sides and rubbing soothing circles into my skin as he started speaking again.
Warning: graphic m/m sex
“Harry! Harry! Harry!” I chanted over and over as his thrusts became erratic behind me.
“Think you can take my cock Malfoy?” He challenged, running it along the inside of my thigh as one of his slick fingers pushed into my ass. I arched against him involuntarily due to the combination of the two sensations, getting impossibly harder as my want increased tenfold. We’d been playing long enough, I needed him in me soon and feeling him so close was maddening. Of course I would never admit that.
“Bloody hell, no fucking way I’m waiting that long for your dick!” He rolled his eyes at my language but the sudden spike of lust in his eyes proved he wasn’t really frustrated. I shrugged.
year standards.” He chuckled dryly and pulled me to him, spooning me and curling a strong arm protectively around my stomach.
“We’re in a public hallway Dray!” He warned as his eyes darted to the door to the kitchen on our left and the people visible at tables down the hallway to our right.
“We have to go back, it’s not like we can stay back here and—” His words cut off in a sudden moan as my hand found his erection through his slacks under his robes. I groaned when I felt how hard he was and palmed him firmly through the fabric, rubbing up and down his length slowly to really get him going. I realized that my window of opportunity was slim and I had to get him too worked up to stop before his common sense got the best of him. And I really didn’t want him to stop. It hadn’t been fair of him to tease me like he had that morning; going to work and leaving me all hot and bothered and begging him to fuck me. And now I wanted him too badly to put up with this business dinner shit, I needed him now.
“Draco…” He breathed. I responded by moving my head so that I could kiss and nip at his neck, biting down hard on his jugular like I knew he liked. Sure enough I felt his neck muscles move in a silent gasp and his head fell back and to the side to allow me better access.
I didn’t answer, just focused on breathing and relaxing under his gentle hands. He must have felt when all the tension finally left my body because he started moving after I had adjusted fully but right before I had to push back on him to get him to move, proving that he knew my body extremely well indeed. Within minutes we were really going at it, him fucking me fast and hard and deep, making the bed rock and shake and producing a loud slapping noise every time his balls hit my ass. We were panting and sweating and I had moved so that my hands were on the wall and I could slam back into him every time he slammed forward, making our meeting explosive indeed. He was hitting my prostate every time and frequently drew loud moans from the depths of my throat.
“Same as always,” Hermione shrugged.
there…it’s delightful.”
Ron frowned. “Fair. But Harry, it’s Malfoy. He’s always been the ponciest git around.”
Now that his holiday plans were set, Harry was well and truly chuffed. He still didn’t really understand how dating worked (it seemed to be just like friendship, but with lots more hand-holding), but he figured he should at least inform Draco of his whereabouts over the winter hols.
.” Entwined as they were, the two boys fell asleep quickly. Harry was relieved to feel so warm once again.
Harry’s mouth gaped open. What in the bloody hell was Malfoy
“Alright, I got it. Chair it is,” Harry grumbled good-naturedly, returning to the dining room.
Draco frowned and stepped closer, crowding into Harry’s personal space. “Having friends doesn’t mean you have to touch them, or they you. I simply don’t wish to share you with anyone else. I don’t think that’s too much to ask of my
“Oi!” he yelled, thumping Malfoy hard on the back. “Put me down! What the bloody hell d’you think you’re doing?”
and therefore
Choreography somewhat inspired by this YouTube video. Not the whole thing, just the bit at 1:40 that always makes me GASP 😊
Harry told himself.
“But we’re not prefects,” was of course the dumb response that fell out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop it.
“Now Harry…” Hermione began, laying a calming hand on his arm, but Harry cut her off again.
Draco raised one elegant eyebrow. “No? You may not know me as well as you think you do,
Harry didn’t know where to put his hands, and he had no clue where he ought to look. Malfoy settled one of Harry’s hands on his (suspiciously broad) shoulder, and took the other in his own. “Do you remember how to waltz, Potter?”
& & &
Harry slouched in the entryway, tracing the lines in one flagstone with the toe of his sneaker. It was the perfect fall day outside: the leaves were beginning to turn, Hagrid’s pumpkins glowed bright orange beside his cottage, and the air was beautifully crisp. Yet Harry was stuck inside the castle. For some barmy reason, it was barely October and McGonagall was already insisting on “special lessons” for the Yule Ball.
Draco rolled his eyes and pinched Harry, making him yelp. “I like you any way in my bed, but I am relieved that our preferences are so compatible.”
“We’ve only two weeks until exams! Shouldn’t you be studying for NEWTS?” a perplexed Hermione asked. Scarlet and indigo and chartreuse inks smeared the hands clutching the study schedule she’d made for Harry. (It was entirely unused.)
“Bad? With the dragon inheritance thing, I don’t know what’ll happen to him if I reject him. I...I think it’s wrong to not even give him a chance, and what if he needs me?” Images of Malfoy wasting away swam behind Harry’s eyes and caused him a surprising amount of pain.
Draco knew well the honor it was to take tea with his mother there every week. He breathed in with great pleasure as he crossed the threshold. The air was perpetually warm and humid (good for one’s skin and hair, as Narcissa insisted). Experimental breeds and carnivorous plants haunted the edges of the room. Poisonous oleander lurked in one sunny corner, luring unsuspecting visitors with its deadly white flowers. As one continued, the dangerous plants thinned, giving way to fiery bromeliads, hibiscus blossoms, and delicate clusters of orchids. An enormous magnolia tree stretched over all, like an arboreal guardian in tales of old. The center of the conservatory was a cloud of waxy jasmine bushes. Within these bushes lay Narcissa’s sanctuary. Draco relished the hints of fragrance they left on his skin and clothing as he stepped through the bushes to find his mother.
Hermione stared thoughtfully across the Great Hall at Malfoy, who was now taking very prim sips of his tea (black with two sugars, as Harry had noted. One less than usual). “Definitely not a ferret, Ronald. Harry, you know, it’s probably nothing but your own paranoia. But I may as well go to the library and do some research.” With that, she tucked the enormous book into her bag and flounced off, bushy hair bouncing behind her. Ron only looked at Harry for a beat, shrugged, and took a second helping of streaky bacon. Harry went back to watching Malfoy, determined that he would eventually figure him out.
A ginger head leaned close to his and whispered, “So glad I’m sharing with you, mate. Imagine having to share with a Slytherin! Ugh.”
“Er, thanks. You too.”
Harry scoffed. “Prat.”
“Good luck, Harry. We’re happy for you.” Ron was still motionless, so she elbowed him hard in the side. "
Harry stared at him in disbelief. “What do you mean, she says
He’d only been dancing for a few minutes when he felt a figure come up close behind him. Someone tall, at least a couple of inches taller than Harry. Questing fingers skimmed his sides, and Harry leaned into the man’s touch. Slim hips joined Harry’s and began rocking them in a sinuous rhythm. A familiar spicy scent rose to his nostrils, and he inhaled eagerly. Strong hands joined Harry’s and placed them on the finest arse he’d ever felt. These hands felt far too kind to punish him, but he hoped he could persuade the man to do so. His body felt too good against Harry’s to give up.
“That makes sense. You’ve been at each other's throats for seven years, it’s only natural to fall into learned patterns of behavior. But you said he’s changed. How do you feel about the new Malfoy, the one you got to know this year?”
Harry cackled. “Your place is a piece of work.”
Draco thoughtfully cocked his head to the side. “I suppose it would be entertaining to be a tourist for a day. A
Fearing what was to come next, Harry shut his eyes tightly. Surprise bloomed when the thumb moved and insistent lips pressed against his own. It was a fierce, desperate kiss, more that a beast than a man. A muffled
Draco’s irritation faltered. Did Potter know the gravity of what he asked? Life debts were ancient and powerful magic. Draco knew he would have no choice but to accept Potter’s request, even if it were for his hand in marriage or his vast fortune or his own death.

That certainly wasn’t what Harry had been expecting. His brain didn’t seem to be working anymore, and Draco scoffed. “Answer quickly, if you please. My trousers are beginning to crease.”
Harry pointedly did not wear the cloak, but kept it hanging in a corner of their dorm room. Where he could admire it, if he so desired. (Ron certainly did, and Harry caught him posing dramatically in front of the mirror with it more than once.) As irked as he was by the sappy letters and extravagant gifts, Harry had to admit a certain nagging desire to see what would come next.
Harry
“Well? How’d it go, mate?” Ron asked, putting away his wizard’s chess set. He must have beaten Dean soundly again, judging by the state of the black pieces.
They both regretted it very much the next morning. A mind-bogglingly hungover Harry and Hermione stumbled down from their beds around noon and opened gifts in front of the little tree. Christmas was not quite as much fun when one had a pounding headache and no stomach for the treats overflowing from one’s stocking, but they went through the motions all the same. Each present was more delightful than the last, but they’d only unwrapped half the pile when Hermione had put a hand to her mouth and mused that she might go back to bed after all.
