"You keep saying that, but he's a Healer in training now, Draco. Hardly the right qualifications to become a Dark Lord of any kind."
He remembers Harry's cold gaze during training, his words after that botched-up blow job in the corridor along the north wall on Level Two, and decides he can only piece his heart back together so many times before the cracks finally start showing. He still hates himself for never knowing what to say or how to act around Harry because Harry has always been far too important to risk.
Draco contemplates the greenish potion on his sink. It’s been standing there since yesterday. Why indeed wait longer? He grabs the bottle, all while his mirror self cringes and shows him an extremely emphatic thumb down. Draco, of course, pokes his tongue out at it.
to be tied up. He knows what some of his customers would do to him if they could, if they knew who he is, and after another swallow, he manages to mumble, “Yes, I do take it up the arse.” He keeps the
Indeed, Draco seems to have a hard time focusing on Potter these days without fixating on his nose. Or his mouth. Or his stupidly green eyes. As Potter chuckles next to him over something that still escapes him, Draco finds himself sliding a hand around his neck and guiding Potter's head closer to his own, until they're both breathing the same air.
Potter. Frankly, something good had to come out of all those years at school, sneaking glances at him across the hallway. Out of rivalry, of course—it’s not like he’d been drawn in by Potter’s charm, since Potter’s charm was never quite, never there. But anyway, the point here is he knows Potter, and he knows how he works. He’s remarkably easy to manipulate: present yourself as a victim, and he’ll set all else aside to help you, because he desperately loves being a hero.
"Come on in, you git," Potter says, grabbing Draco's wrist to pull him inside. "It's raining out there."
They're both quiet for a while, surrounded only by the sound of forks and knives occasionally clicking against plates. Draco has no idea what his mother is thinking, though she's obviously deep in thought. He's not entirely sure he wants to know either.
"Funny, I seem to recall you dropping by at two in the morning to tell me you just had," she says, "but I guess I could have imagined that."
“Bit of a snob, ain’t she?” Fred said. Harry glared because, well, because she was one of his best friends and whatnot. Not that Fred wasn’t, but Hermione came first.
He pauses by the door to his bedroom, after reading Scorpius to sleep. Touches his lips, thinking of Potter’s. The way his gaze touched his own body, and how it looked different than it did before, it looked better, almost as when he fell for him the first time… It’s just a thought, nothing more. But it does cross his mind for a moment.
But Potter just laughs. He laughs, propping his head up on his elbows and says, "We don't actually live together."
Draco tries to back off, but there's a wall behind him. There's nowhere to go and it's too warm with Potter near him and he hates it, he hates how Potter makes him feel even now. He hates himself for feeling like shit when
And it doesn't last. It doesn't take long for Harry's brain to catch up with him, for Harry to push him back, push Draco off him yet again.
They fall silent again, and the minutes pass, and Draco wonders if he could get away with telling her after all. This is Pansy; she's nothing if not tenacious. She's still glaring daggers at him over her takeaway cup, as though she thinks he's committed some sort of capital offence. Draco guesses Potter's girlfriend might agree with her, if she ever finds out—not that she
He remembers every instant leading up to that moment with a blinding clarity, he remembers the exact second he looked into Potter's eyes and could no longer recognise the person behind them. But he doesn't know how long he stood there after Potter shut the door in his face.
“Whatever. Just think about it, you honestly think Zabini is going to last much longer? He’s been shagging you, how long? Six months, and I’m being generous here—do you think he’ll stick forever and ever, take you as his wedded bride, or what?”
"I mean that. I could. In fact, I could probably have you sacked—they did ask me if I wanted to press charges after your stunt the other day."
Miller scratches his chin. It looks like he’s been growing that beard for a real long while. Somehow, seeing that forces Draco’s nose to crumple. He’s never liked bearded people too much, they mar his skin with tiny pink tears and he’s suddenly feeling quite glad Pansy thought to charge him extra.
Pansy is sitting next to him on the couch, playing wizard chess as they often do on rainy days, when she mentions—hesitantly—that she'll be hanging out with Potter and a few of their Healer friends the following evening. It's right then when Draco realises he might be keeping far too many secrets from her. He's been seeing Potter for over two months now—and even though he's still being careful, even though they haven't even slept in the same bed so far, there's no way he could deny that that's the way things are heading.
“Because,” Draco explains when he’s about to leave, Scorpius tucked against his chest, “we are not the same people that we were back then.”
,” she whispered. “Ron got so happy when he started dating his sister again, you should have seen him. He kept saying Harry was part of the family and… then they married, and I… I thought that was best for him! I honestly thought not remembering you was best for him.”
Hermione blinked. “Yesterday,” she said, extremely slowly, “was Sunday, Harry,” in a voice that kindly said
The only good thing that came from Draco’s time at Hogwarts was, possibly, Pansy. He couldn’t say she admired him because, frankly, she never did seem to give a damn one way or the other. But at least she was his friend. Even after uselessly crushing on him for all those years. He’s quite sure he broke her heart when he came out, that night when he got drunk and… well, that’s a tale for another time. Especially since it’s such a blur in his mind. He’s not even sure what he told her—though it was likely a crass spiel on his preference for prick over pussy. See, that would certainly explain her
“The Ministry… you were there when they read my sentence. They took all my parents’ properties. It’s not like I have a home I can return to.” He marvels at how easy faking truth happens to be, when it all comes much easier than the lies he has to tell daily. Please sir, fuck me harder, oh yes, I love it when you do that, do it again. It’s a complete mystery how lies jump to his tongue and out, how they won’t stop coming. He doesn’t even know how to
By the time Draco reacts, he follows him, running as fast as he can. “I’m sorry,” he says, apologises,
But Potter’s answer was vague enough to mean something else—quite often I think so, quite often I hope so—and saying that would mean admitting too much, too soon. Instead, Draco says, “Let’s go upstairs.”
But despite that, he does mention Potter—like today, when he comes back home in such a dreadful mood that Pansy actually asks him about it. "Merlin, what's up with you? You've been looking like a crazed Dementor all day, I swear I've been tempted to buy you a black cloak just to complete the look."
on it later," Potter says, hovering just above his nipples. "Honestly," he adds, before sinking his teeth into Draco's skin.
Partly glad, partly humiliated too. He doesn’t want to tell Potter that though, so he goes with, “Alive.” And a bit awkward, a bit confused. “Nothing hurts if I stay put,” he says, in doubt, figuring that might be the spell the woman cast on him downstairs. Then, he recalls reading Potter worked at Spell Damage and adds, “I guess you’re not too bad at this whole healing thing you do for a living.”
His father would have agreed. But Draco likes the other answers better, the ones that sound like stories, the ones about towers that grow while their owners are away. They make him feel a bit like he did when he was younger and Father would read him fairy tales before bed. Even now, they're the ones that allow him to dream.
Draco turns to stare at him. Potter hasn't moved. He's so still he looks like a breathing statue—only his skin is warm and soft, and in no way reminiscent of stone.
, and any second now Draco will be fine too. When he forgets about this, when he stops vainly hoping not to be sick on the floor. It took quite a while to clean up the loo last time, with his spells not working. He read somewhere it’s quite common during pregnancies. But there’s at least a tiny person growing inside him, and he thinks that’s good. Fantastic even, even though the Potter side of it is quite frightening.
They were just simple things at first; nothing major. As a fourth year, Draco used to dream Harry shook his hand on the Hogwarts Express. That he picked
—because they’re partly at fault here, his life wouldn’t be what it is if they didn’t exist. But somehow, he can’t quite get there, not right now.
He'd apologise to Harry on their first day, and Harry would chuckle quietly at him. "You don't need to explain that to me, Draco," he'd say. "I always knew. I know you better than you know yourself."
, his mind yells at him, and it’s right. The child is his and not Potter’s, Potter wasn’t even there when he gave birth. But by now Draco is contemplating banging his head against the wall, repeatedly, unendingly, and rather seriously too.)
“Good. Because to me, it doesn’t either. But that,” he emphasises, “that is what he’s going to hear, being my son.”
“No, I’d love to,” Draco says, though he’s not willing to admit how much. He’s not willing to admit he’s bonded. Just as he’s not willing to admit this is everything to him.
"Congratulations, Mr Malfoy," she says, giving Pansy an odd look before continuing. "Of course, we'll need you to come back next week for us to run a few more tests, but it would seem you're six weeks pregnant."
“I know,” she mumbled. Draco remembers thinking there about the look she gave him, back at the gala. It wasn’t pity what he saw on that glance. It was shame: self-shame, shame over her own acts. “Believe me, now I know. But now it’s too late to change it.” Understanding that much didn’t keep Draco from kicking her out.
, he thinks, because this is it, because now’s the time: it’s now or never, jump ahead or be left behind. He exhales slowly, until there’s nothing in his head but this, here, what he’s going to do. He moves closer to Potter, closer still until their bodies touch, front to back.
As Potter lowers his glass to the floor, Draco fervently hopes it's not answers that Potter's come looking for. He hopes the other night felt as otherworldly to him as it did to Draco—that
Dumbledore falls into an unending abyss. Only, it’s not unending, it just seems unending because time has slowed. Stopped. But it has an end, and Draco can see it. He can see the ground down there.
"Oh, that." Draco sighs, letting his eyes fall shut. "I'm going to keep it, obviously," he says, and Pansy's hand goes still—so very still upon his head. Draco blinks up at her.
"I thought—people talk, you know? I overheard the Weasley girl telling Lovegood about you at work, the other day, about how Potter has been spending more and more time at your place these past few months, and they just assumed . . ." She snorts inelegantly, slumping down further into her chair. "Of all things, they thought you two had somehow managed to become friends. Imagine my surprise," she goes on, in a derisive tone offset only by the pleading look in her eyes. "Only they don't know half the story, do they?"
"And you're such an arse." Harry shifts a bit closer then. He rests his elbows on Draco's bed, and stares fixedly at Draco for what seems like hours. Draco tries so hard to put everything he's feeling into his eyes—right there, for Harry to see. And he has no idea if that works, but eventually Harry crosses his arms and buries his face in Draco's blankets. "That's all you ever had to do, you know? Assaulting me in dark corridors is hardly conducive to getting a date with me." Harry's body shakes a little, as if he were laughing—or crying—and so does his voice when he speaks again, "All you ever had to say was that."
Draco drops his face into Potter's neck, grinning. He knows this isn't the past. He knows this Potter isn't the same one from eighth year—he's older now and ostensibly wiser, but most importantly, he's also Draco's boyfriend. And Draco, who's lived through a war and an unknown bonding spell that nearly drove him up the walls, is pretty sure he now knows everything there is to know about love.
, and he wants to cry, he wants to die. He doesn’t want Potter to look at him like that: like he’s hateful, pitiable, pathetic.
is the main reason Draco kept staying at that lovely gentleman’s place, the lovely gentleman whose fists sent him to hospital. Draco feeds that, of course.
"Good. So, er—" Potter's fingers flexed at is side, curling then uncurling in a mockery of Draco's memories. He had felt that same hand tracing the line of his jaw, making fists of his hair, and it had felt brilliant—it had felt so impossibly brilliant, "—see you around?" And this was Potter telling him that it was over—
have, if he'd thought this was even remotely possible. It's just male pregnancies are only supposed to happen when there are potions involved, or when a very specific set of circumstances is met—strong magic, intense emotions, a particular alignment of the planets . . .
A small piece of his heart dies in his chest every time, and Draco knows, deep down, that he should have tried harder to talk to Harry. Only he never knew what to say or how to act around him, because Harry has always been far too important to risk.
There's obviously no easy way to say this, so he writes, 'Mother, I'm pregnant,' and quickly ties the scroll to his owl's leg.
Draco thought about all the things he wanted from Harry—his cloak, his map, his friendship . . . a kiss. Not that he'd ever ask for one, but hell, yes, he wanted one.
Potter's eyes narrow. Draco doesn't actually know who moves first. All he knows is that they're suddenly kissing—
. He swallows, because perhaps a thank you will be worth it in the long run. Even if it’s to Potter, who he’s not too keen on thanking, considering he once slashed his chest open on a whim.
“Azkaban, I know,” Draco breaks in. “But I wasn’t one by choice. You, of all people, should know that.”
He’d have inherited it, if it weren’t for its last owner changing the will to include Potter. It’s always smelled a bit funny, like stale cloth and dust. He’s always assumed it must have been the emptiness: his first cousin once removed being locked up in Azkaban, the rest of the Blacks who ever lived here, dead, disinherited. Or perhaps like Mother or that mingebag aunt of his, both of them married to someone else. Now though, he’s assuming Potter might be the one at fault: it’s technically his, and it still smells ghastly. In fact, perhaps Draco should have a chat with him—or with his house-elf, whatever it is its called.
He stares at the clock. The hand that has Pansy's name on it is pointing towards 'LATE! LATE! LATE!' and he can feel her eyes on him all through it, as if she's trying to puzzle him out. The urge to break down and tell her everything—of baring his and Potter's sordid love story to her—is almost overwhelming for a minute there.
Potter shrugged, sitting on the other end of the bed—just across from Draco. He was eating treacle tart again; Draco thought it was quite a marvel his teeth hadn't fallen off so far, what with the amount of golden syrup he must have ingested on a daily basis.
Draco licks his cock in a long tease. Potter’s thighs shiver, spread out easy. It’s perfect, it’s absolutely perfect, because Draco’s world is now flawless, and finally moving
When he looked back up, he could see Potter's mouth moving. Draco had been so lost in his thoughts he hadn't even heard him speak, but Potter was still there, looking oddly amused in a way that could mean nothing good.
be around. St Mungo's has several floors and whatnot, and really, what are the chances of Potter constantly showing up at his? So there was that. And then there was the fact that the job seemed like a good opportunity to clear his name.
"Just go, Potter. Go back home, or wherever it is you go when you're not here breaking and entering."
"Hello," Draco greets him, pressing his lips together to hold back a smile. He can see Pansy leaning against the kitchen entrance from where he stands, blatantly eavesdropping, not even having the sense to look embarrassed.
"No. Salazar, no." Draco laughs, a dry laugh that sounds more like a sob than he wants it to. "I can't do that. He'll think I'm a circus freak, he'll—" Leave and never come back, Draco's mind fills in for him. Only Harry wouldn't do that, would he?
“Pansy,” Hermione said, “Ginny’s girlfriend, died in her sleep, without pain,” while “Lavender and Dean died in a car crash last Friday,” and “McGonagall mistakenly cursed herself, apparently she mistook her image to be that of an intruder. Such a shame, isn’t it?”
Potter's hands move lazily up the back of Draco's legs on the way up. His mouth is barely inches from Draco's crotch. "Because I quite liked you on your back," he says slowly, his breath ghosting hotly over the fabric on Draco's trousers as he speaks. "Because I have a proposal for you."
Anyway. Draco breathes out, slowly. It’s what he’s here for, isn’t it? A shag. Best to get it over with, then.
Potter seems to have reverted to that thing he used to do a few months back, criticising Draco's brewing skills as if he were just that much better at potion-making. And Draco . . . Draco has just about had it.
In the end Potter turns out to be right—yet again, about Weasel. When the second week drops by, he’s behaving more like a person and less like a rabid dog. Or a rabid weasel, in this particular case. Mostly. With the occasional exception of his, “Merlin saggy balls, Harry, you had literally the whole world to choose from, the
Later that night, as Potter is making good on his promise of pushing Draco yet again into the delicious abyss between orgasm and unconsciousness, Draco catches himself thinking he wouldn't mind having every single day end up like this.
"Leave, Potter." Draco takes out his wand, pointing it at Potter's chest. "And don't bother coming back, this is . . . we're done. It's over."
“I suspected, of course,” he hears Pans’ saying in the background, behind all the noise, the constant buzz in his mind, behind Mother, behind everything. “Not that you ever told me. Once a Slytherin, always a Slytherin, isn’t it?”
letting go, he’s letting go fully, and that’s good too. That’s great, Draco thinks, because at last he feels like winning might be possible in this game of theirs, and that his luck is not all lost.
"Oh, dear, I never . . ." His mother pushes back her plate. "I wasn't running away from you, you must know that. I was exiled," she says. She sounds sad, but that's hardly surprising. "There's a difference."
“Yeah…” Draco tries on a hesitant smile. “I know.” He thinks he does now, he’s never been sure before today. Harry doesn’t talk much, he just does—and fucks up more often than not when the things he does have to do with Draco.
They could stand here forever locked in a perpetual staring match, shooting questions at each other and having nothing come out of it—Draco may not know what they are now, not exactly, but he knows that on some level they're still enemies. They never really made it past that point. Neither of them is likely to give away more than they're receiving.
Potter will do, when he comes back. Draco hopes, wishes he won’t suggest an abortion. He thinks of poisoning, crushing, burning the little human growing in his belly and he really, really doesn’t want that. Not at all. Not for his son. He wants his tiny human born and growing, forever a reminder of these few months he felt content and relaxed, these few months when his life seemed for once worth living. No, if Potter even
Draco rolls his eyes, but stays there while Potter goes to pick up glasses. He stays there definitely not staring at Potter’s arse as he walks away. Potter brings back one of the bottles he bought for him, ages and ages ago, back when Draco still lived here. Draco’s heart aches with longing, aches with wanting, aches with… all of this. Aches with Potter down on his knees between his legs. Aches with the taste of his come on Potter’s tongue right afterwards.
He should Floo Pansy, let her know where he is, and that he’s whole and well and his spine is not missing. Let her know he’s still alive. She must be worried sick, he’s been missing for several days now. Besides, she might even be pleased that he’s at Potter’s. Just a few more minutes, he thinks, because he’s tired, because it’s calm and quiet and safe, and because Potter isn’t here. And because he can. Perhaps Pans was right, after all. Potter offered his place, he brought him here without waking him up. He let him sleep. Potter even thought to throw a blanket over him.
They'd be partners after that—both at work and under the secret softness of Draco's silk sheets. They'd work well together. Always. And Draco quite liked it like that.
He shakes the arm trapped by Potter’s hand until it’s free of his grasp, free of the pressure, free of the chains holding him down. Free of everything.
"I know you two weren't really getting along," Granger says soothingly, "but still, I doubt that's why he's leaving. There must be more to it."
at the remains of Draco's work. "Malfoy?" He places a hand on Draco's shoulder, shaking him, not roughly, but insistently. "Draco?"
"I meant what I said," Potter tells him, pushing Draco back until his spine is uncomfortably pressed against the armrest. "I'm really am sorry, I know I was an arse to you."
. He feels like he can't think, like he can't even breathe properly when every shiver, every single moan that escapes Potter's mouth is driving him wilder and wilder.
. But when? So he just averts his eyes, lets Pansy look at him until she’s figured out something here, because he can’t. He’s lacking info, too much info that he should have but doesn’t, and that itches the wrong way.
He's lying against Potter's chest, lulled halfway to sleep by the steady thrum of Potter's heartbeat and the gentle caress of Potter's fingers on his hair, when Potter says, "It's funny how things have turned out, don't you think?"
All in all, Draco thinks it's rather fitting: whoever they paid to make their banners obviously needed to see a Healer, light pink and coffee brown schemes haven't been called fashionable since the late fifties. But, whatever.
“I’ll work less when we’ve got cash.” He fills a glass with water and sits on the counter by the sink, because he’s tired, burnt-out and half-dead, and he really, really doesn’t want to talk about this. Not now.
there is doing something. Quite a shame he’s still not sure if this something is good or not. “A third chance, actually,” he answers. “You’ve had two already, and you blew them both.”
"You know," Draco said, leaning his head against Harry's shoulder, "I've never been to the cinema either."
over his shoulder. He doubts any of them hit, but at least they'll keep them busy—distract them while he catches up to Harry.
He basically broke her heart. He broke her heart, and he can’t remember it at all. Merlin, he must have been drunk off his arse. “I’m sorry, Pans. I’m so sorry…”
Fortunately, he never needs to figure himself out, because that's the last time Potter ever talks to him at work. Whenever their paths cross in the corridors, Potter simply looks down and away, and he even goes as far as to send Pansy to fetch his potions—which is so ludicrous it borders on pathetic, Draco thinks. But it's also a way out.
Harry just stares down at him, breathing hard, his eyes half-lidded and dark. So dark Draco would never guess their colour if it weren't already burnt into his mind—green like Slytherin, green like the glowing sparks of
“Oh, Potter…” Draco’s lips turn into a sneer. Inside him, there’s a distraught chuckle ringing constantly against the edges of his being. “You are so, so naïve. It’s not like he needs
"I don't know," Draco states, freeing his hand from Potter's grasp. He rises to his feet and starts walking back to the villa—away from Potter—as fast as he can.
All in all, most of that has created an odd mix of hate swirling into his love, that he’s certainly sure none of the men proposing to him deserves.
Draco shivers. He could send Potter away, he could tell him he never wants to see his stupid face again, he could . . .
He really should be working. He needs to finish fixing the Foe-Glass Mr Doge brought in this morning and then get started on the twenty or so Sneakoscopes the Ministry wants back by next week. But he's been in a shit mood all day, ever since he read that same stupid article this morning and . . . and it's so ridiculously hard to concentrate when his mind keeps going off on tangents, thinking about Potter and all the things he might be up to.
And Draco… Draco finds it hard to believe, especially to believe this is happening to him—him, the boy who lost his luck in a gamble for friendship that turned out wrong, and has been regretting it ever since. Particularly since he knows that brand is quite a bit more expensive than a mere bottle of beer, and Potter still bought it. For him. Because Draco likes it. Even though it was never on his shopping lists. For a moment there he recalls what he wanted as a child—friends, legitimate admiration. And this… this feels pretty close to that, doesn’t it?
Draco's breath is coming faster. Pansy is still standing near the door, but now she's biting down on her lip, looking back and forth between them as though she's sure they're going to start throwing hexes any minute—and Draco doesn't
Potter really sounds quite desperate. Why, Draco wonders, why indeed. Why would Potter be frenzied over an escort getting hurt on the job? It happens every day, especially when said escort just turns out to be Draco Malfoy. But then again, Potter doesn’t know the full story, does he? He’s such a… bloody Gryffindor, that’s what he is. Draco should hate them—hate
He doesn't look up. He carefully examines his fingernails as his mother's face flickers silently in the fireplace. He doesn't want to see the disappointment in her eyes. He feels as though he's sat through enough pitying looks from Pansy to last him a lifetime—and he's just fine, he's not broken, he doesn't even want to get married, for fuck's sake.
And Draco does. He waits one hour, two. Potter is gone. He’s not even sure he’ll come back. He doesn’t know if he’s…
Or, most commonly, when Pansy walked into the shop in the middle of the afternoon carrying a battered copy of the
He does visit that church his mother mentioned, and a bunch of other ones after that one. His mother was right, as usual: they are gorgeous. Besides, it's not as if there's much else to do. The town is some days full of Muggles; they walk around carrying their small clicking devices, and laugh and talk and shoot flashes of light at things.
"You know," Potter is saying, "I did notice you'd put on some weight of late but I just thought—I don't know what I thought, that you still looked good, probably. It didn't even occur to me you could be pregnant."
For a moment there, Draco can almost see the tiny wheels turning in his head. It makes him realise he’s almost fouled things up there. Merlin, Pansy would skin him slowly if she ever found out, so he tries, “I mean to work, I was late to work.” A little smile. He’s kind of trying to act like a newbie here when he barely recalls how that felt. Isn’t that a laugh? “This is really my first date.” Cross your fingers and hope it works. “I had to go to Gringotts first, sadly they kept me there quite a while.”
They stay near the back of the room, talking animatedly the whole time. Draco knows this because he's been watching them—because he can't take his eyes off Harry. No matter how much he tries to look away, his eyes keep focusing on the way the she Weasel pats Harry's shoulder as she speaks. On the way Harry slips an arm around her shoulders to guide her to her seat.
Potter. He’s just some random bloke. For some absurd reason, he seems to be trying very, very hard to look just like Potter, up there, not that Draco knows why or anything. But still, he’s definitely, absolutely, categorically not Potter.
Once, perhaps, back in first year, when he tried to shake hands with Potter. If he recalls correctly, that didn’t exactly work out well. At least not for Draco.
When Draco goes to Potter's house for the first time, Potter opens the door in a tight black t-shirt and a loose pair of grey jeans. "Hey," he says, smiling that smile he smiles for his friends, and Draco feels his insides tying themselves into endless knots.
"So . . ." Draco licked his lips, looking away. He could do this. Some risks were simply worth taking. "What if I did want you to? What would you actually do then?"
Furthermore, she’s the only one who’s always surpassed him back at Hogwarts, at least when it came to grades in subjects. He’s guessing there might be a slight bit of admiration within his rancour: he’s feeling quite resentfully respectful here and that, well, that is really saying something.
“I knew it,” he says, a hint of triumph in his voice. Thrusts coming down harder, thick and steady. “I fucking knew it. A Death Eater trying to charge me for… oh God… for shagging him, a fucking Death Eater!”
So he and Harry start training together—along with Granger and the Weasel—and Draco doesn't talk to him for a whole year. Not even once. He has no idea how to approach him. He has no idea what to say, or if Harry would even
"Fine, I'll go," Draco said, giving in, and Harry threw his fist into the air. "But you'll owe me for this."
On his fourth week there, Draco finds a bakery on the way home. Their windows are filled with bread, cakes and pastries, and Draco stares at them pressing his face to the glass, his stomach growling. But he knows he can't buy any of them without Muggle money.
Granger nods distractedly. "And what are you up to these days? It's been ages since we last heard from you."
"Weirdly Muggle, coming from you," Potter tells him, rather out of the blue. His mouth is twitching at the corners, as if he found this whole thing hilarious for some mad reason Draco can't quite ascertain. "I'd have expected a spell before a punch to the face, to be honest. But then again, it's not like it's the first time you've done this . . ."
He frowns. Suddenly his mouth feels dry, despite the water he’s been drinking. His hand feels cold around the glass, colder even than the glass. He thinks about the flashbacks he has at night. About how he messed up that day. He lifts his free hand; it runs shivery over his own face.
His brain is doing that thing again, where it’s both hazy and a mess and… and it won’t work right. He curls up next to the door, arms around his knees, his own head resting between his legs. He really, really wants a drink. Draco blinks steadily while his mind works to justify the need.
The girl Weasel catches Draco staring as she brings back drinks for her friends. She narrows her eyes suspiciously, and leans in close to whisper something in Harry's ear. Harry looks up.
“You need to have one if you want to apply for a job. It just turns out the nice lady doing mine wasn’t, how to say, extremely kind once she’d read my surname.” Yes, his visit to the Muggle’s Paperwork Department in the Ministry of Magic had not been particularly pleasant. With nerves licking his lips, Draco picks his teacup up, again. “A Squib, apparently,” he says, quite sarcastically. Also, quite aware he’s lying about his own feelings regarding Squibs. He’s been prompted to hate them—thanks ever so much, Father. He’s not sure he ever could, at least not since his own brain grew thoughts and tendons, and began walking on his own. He certainly can’t now, considering many of them live better lives than the one left for him: a loser, an underdog. Defeated. Best not to leave him air to breathe. “No wonder her lack of charm.”
He may have daydreamed about it on occasion, and not even all that often, to be fair. Just on those days when work was particularly slow, or when he walked past one of those huge Firebolt adverts on his way home; the ones with Potter shirtless, a light sheen of sweat making the sides of his neck glow warmly under the flash of the camera as he flew forwards in an infinite loop.
“The war did play some games with your mind, didn’t it? Either that, or all the booze you’ve been drinking since,” she says sharply. “You’re pregnant. Remember that curse on the Malfoy line?”
Later that day, Draco thinks about the whole conversation and regrets almost instantly agreeing to what Potter said. Agreeing to it might mean Potter not needing to drop by so often, a large step backwards on his whole wooing Potter plan. It’s just a shame his plan got somehow, someway lost during that convo, partly thanks to all the glaring that seemed to sway his mind elsewhere. More towards
Draco keeps hoping he’d chosen a different path to get here, wondering how to undo what has been done. It’s rather pointless, because so far his best conclusion is that some things are better done than undone, and that even
For a moment there, Draco contemplates losing all his clothes again, is not like his prick can stay down too long when this is the view he’s getting: Potter, still naked, still shimmering with sweat, all skin and those bloody green eyes and… those perfect lips. Merlin, they did feel great around his cock. Why not try that again, indeed, why not?
. “I don’t know. Maybe.” And he knows, he just knows, that his ‘maybe’ here sadly means ‘yes’. “You’re always a good boy anyway,” he says, with a shake of his head before settling back into the couch, next to Harry. He pushes Potter’s fingers off when they start climbing over his thigh, and adds, “At least according to the press.”
Potter shoves a hand into his trouser pocket, pulling out a small glass vial filled with blood-coloured liquid. Plumpton's Prenatal Devigoration Solution. It makes Draco's throat burn when he swallows it and his mouth tastes of mouldy cottage cheese and cheap liquor for hours afterwards, but it's the best—the safest—over the counter sleep aid for pregnant wizards. The only one specifically designed with them in mind.
"True," Narcissa says after a long pause. "You seem sad, I suppose I thought you might like it there. They keep several artworks from the renaissance—paintings, frescoes mostly. You always did enjoy a beautiful scenery."
It’s either that, or the bottles Potter paid for, or perhaps the touching, or sitting together on the couch. Or the way he treats him. It definitely has to be
"What?" Draco snapped. Forever trapped in Potter's vicinity. It would drive him insane; he could see it.
George. It couldn’t be. It just couldn’t be. Because if it was, well, if it was life didn’t look too great for Harry, did it? Or, for that matter, for anyone else.
“No, not yet. I have to pick up Scorpius first,” he says, with a smile. A smile he’s not feeling at all: dropping by Potter’s tends to make him more furious than pleased.
Draco wonders if the girl Weasley is looking after him now. If she's bringing him hot soup and tucking him up in his bed. If Harry has fucked her yet.
anymore. He still remembered lying awake late at night, listening to Potter's voice as he made up stories about the people on that map of his, as he chattered on, explaining some Muggle reference or other—and Draco never got most of them, didn't even care to know what they were, but still he'd listened. He remembered helping Potter with his Potions homework, trying to teach him to play wizard chess well enough to beat Weasley—not that Potter ever had, but it was the thought that counted.
A thought keeps creeping into his mind: it’s not his fault he’s here today. Draco chuckles lowly, like the maddest of the mad—it makes his back hurt a bit when he moves, he’s not sure why. Frankly, he’s not sure it’s anyone’s fault that he’s here, except perhaps Miller’s, and Miller is not here, the bastard.
"Okay." A light breeze blows across Potter's face, sending strands of hair whipping across his forehead. Draco itches to push them back, to run his hands through that hair. It feels so much softer than it looks.
Later that night, as everything inside Draco tightened, as his world melted into a blur of want and need and
“Why can’t we go back to how we were?” Potter begs. “I still love you,” his voice says, behind him, as he goes upstairs.
. He’s all those things at the same time, and for a moment there, he sort of feels like giggling inside because how on Earth is any of that fine? He’s not fine. They, together, are not even remotely
Pansy's head snaps to the clock, her eyes widening. "Shit. Healer Kaur is going to tear me to pieces, I keep being late to our Mind-Healing practices . . ."
Only Potter doesn't leave. He refuses to leave with that same stubborn set to his jaw Draco had come to know so well during their school days—the same one Potter always wore when Draco mocked him, or when the
It’s not quite an apology, but it’s certainly getting too close to one to feel anywhere near right for him. It’s enough for Draco to pull back and try to remember Potter is
under her arm. She'd sit down, sipping at her takeaway coffee, and proceed to read yet another article about Perfect Potter's not so perfect love life—loudly, and complete with dramatic hand motions.
"No, I meant . . . now." Potter chews on his bottom lip. "Would you be willing to come back to the UK now?"
working) he’s not too sure he’d be able to defend himself. For a moment there, Draco thinks things might be turning towards good. Perhaps. It seems likely. “I guess this whole thing has given me the push to sign the arrangement.”
"I never did like fame, Malfoy," Potter says, and of course he'd like Draco to believe that. It doesn't matter though, Draco knows better—it's not as if Potter needs to pretend to be all righteous around him.
So when he arrives home from work one evening to find Potter sitting on his couch, looking sullen, Draco just assumes he must have had a really bad day at work. Spectacularly bad, if the way he's drinking straight from Draco's bottle of Odgen's Old is anything to go by.
He really, really wants to punch Potter on the face, punch the stupid prat who’s not even aware of the damage he’s done.
"Sorry, dear, can't talk right now," she yells from the bathroom. "I'm so ridiculously late, Blaise is probably going to rip my head off as soon as he sees me."
“I mean we are too different. I mean it’s just not working. I don’t really know why. I tried, you know? It’s just
on his teeth. “Do you really think this is a good idea?” he heard Fred-the-ghost saying from the kitchen.
“It’s ancient magic,” Draco breaks in. It’s like a gate has opened and now he can’t shut up. Words jump out of his mouth. He tells Harry everything, all he knows, what Mother told him, what he found out afterwards.
For a second there, Draco feels as if he’s being studied. She’s looking at him with very serious eyebrows. He knows the room is quite hot, but he suddenly feels cold inside. Inhospitably cold. Almost as if his heart had been replaced with a chunk of ice. “What did I say, Pans?”
So, point here? None at all. Mister Potter, all hail him, knows no fear and knows no danger, and apparently knows nothing at all. It’s not like adding tiny lies to that massive one is going to somehow unbalance their universe.
“Yes, Pansy. I’m sure.” Terribly sure, sadly. After the great mess-up today, he doesn’t think he could be any surer than he is.
“That’s the thing.” Harry pressed the mug into his shaking hands, letting out a shuddering exhale. “That’s what
Hermione swallowed. “Harry,” she began, “say, have you considered seeing a psychiatrist? They deal with, well, with this kind of... issues.”
. He looked up. The waiter — hm, was he—no, he couldn’t be — looked down, said something that sounded quite a bit like ‘Salazar’ but it obviously couldn’t be. No, that was pretty much impossible since this was a Muggle establishment, so it might have been ‘soz’. Or ‘shite’. In all honesty, Harry quite preferred ‘soz’. It was much better than ‘shite’, he thought, because ‘shite’ might lead onto a fight, especially since it was his own
The villa is relatively small—when compared to the manor anyway—but it has tall glass windows and a large garden, and a small lake where wild geese swim during the winter.
He finds himself, unawarely, smiling even through the pain that comes with the change, his appearance turning into someone else’s. Perhaps his luck didn’t run out when he met Potter, he rarely makes this much in a single day. He doesn’t even have time to change or shower, so he just straightens his tie, kisses Pans’ cheek, and sweeps through the kitchen into the Floo.
Draco feels oddly lost amongst so many people, many of whom he's been avoiding since leaving Hogwarts. He guesses he should have known. It's a party after all, and everywhere he looks there are drinks, people dancing and colourful lights, there are even several giant banners floating up above him—offensively flashy things reading 'Healers' Graduation Ceremony'.
. Once he’s finished, he tells him, “I don’t know why you fret so much.” Fretting and fretting indeed, all while being everyone’s hero; it’s almost like Potter lives in a parallel universe, where he sees not what others think of him, the Lord of Lords. Merlin, Draco would give his life and more to have that much himself.
"Do you think they'll ever figure out a way to break the bond?" Draco asked, but Potter stayed silent.
"No." Potter lets out a slow breath. "I mean, yes, of course. But I also wanted to ask you, would you be willing to come back to the UK?"
, a tiny deal with Kreacher just so he takes the blame… why not, after all? Harry would look much better without them, and he caught Kreacher some days ago, glance full of want at one of Draco’s scarves while he was cleaning his—no,
was too big, and he was too small, and too much of a coward to stand by what he should have stood. “Who else could get such strong feelings out of you, strong enough to create a bond out of thin air.”
… just yet. But Draco thinks, slightly maliciously, that he’ll make that smile grow larger in time, have Potter gift his heart to him for he deserves it, as payment for the misery Draco’s life has turned into—which is not truly Potter’s fault, but some parts of it are.
look. Harry himself had not much of a clue of what she’d been saying, so far into his own imaginary world he’d been, so he basically lifted both shoulders, shook his head, and ordered two Mochas and a Caramel Macchiato.
“To think after all these years, you still can’t keep your eyes off him…” She chanced a grin, at Draco’s expense.
Draco stays quiet, a fake smile plastered on his face. He’s been trying hard to believe his pregnancy is not the whole reason why Harry hasn’t left him yet. Her words though, they seem to imply he might have been quite close to the truth.
“Hi,” Potter says, running a damp hand through his disorderly hair. Even his trousers are wet, he must have wiped them off against the fabric before opening the door. “How are you?”
And, honestly, he doesn’t think that tiny moment when shame ate him whole, is something he needs to share with Potter. He wouldn’t even be able to tell Pansy, and he trusts her much more than
"Well, someone has to." Potter shrugs, but his arms are stiff by his sides, and the look on his face is anything but relaxed. "It's not as if you can drink them, is it?"
“There’s a bug in your code, Hermione. You haven’t noticed it yet, but you will.” And she would, because at least now
Draco is stepping on his own t-shirt, fumbling with the waist of Potter’s pyjama trousers that won’t come
. “Signs that he may have been quite…” Draco pictures his brows puddled mid-forehead, that face Potter makes when he’s thinking hard about something. He guesses he’s trying to find a word here, one that would make that night sound quite lighter than it was—then again, Potter doesn’t know how it was. He doesn’t know how Draco feels about it.
Fenrir looked at him, a vicious smile twisting his lips. “You heard that, little one? We’re gonna have a bit of fun here…”
It was already quite late when he woke up. He’s showered and brushed his teeth, and he’s now trying to pick one among all the new polo shirts he’s been hoarding in Regulus’ wardrobe. He wants to wear the grey one on Monday, when Harry—bollocks,
Draco’s still not sure if it was the nerves or his day or what, but that silly comment had him bursting into laughter.
thoughts won’t keep him awake at night. Merlin knows it’s not the Firewhisky keeping his insomnia alive and kicking. No, the Firewhisky might actually be the only thing helping these days, lulling him softly to sleep when all else fails. It was all he could do to smuggle the case he had from Father’s cellar, before Aurors came to kick him out of his ancestral home. And he’s sure the absurd amounts of Polyjuice he’s been drinking isn’t to blame either. Merlin knows the mere thought of the vile concoction is enough to make him sick up; but, if the years under Snape’s tutelage taught Draco anything, it was that Polyjuice has no effect on one’s sleep patterns.
Harry puts the bottle down. Comes closer, sitting on the edge of the table in front of Draco. “I love you,” he says. One of his hands curls around Draco’s chin, lifting his head up, so there’s eyes on eyes. Draco looks at him for a moment there. Then his gaze shifts away, biting his lip.
Except Potter does still come often. Only, now he brings beers instead of shopping, and seems slightly put out when Draco won’t even open his. For some odd reason Draco doesn’t quite get, that mere fact seems to press him to offer an explanation: “It’s not that I don’t appreciate the effort, I’m just not all that into beer.”
“I confessed to you that night, knowing that there was nearly a hundred percent chance of you rejecting me. I guess, deep inside me, there was a tiny part who wanted to believe you wouldn’t.” She pauses, snorting. Draco doesn’t find it in him to laugh. Nothing out of what she’s telling him feels like it should be a laughing matter. “You did, though,” she goes on. “You even gave me a reason why. A good reason, too, I thought. I honestly felt I couldn’t compete with
situation has him more than a bit stumped. He’s still pondering that, when he hears an ‘ouch’ coming from downstairs.
that left him remembering nothing at all, not even the chat he had with Pansy a little while before that happened. Not to mention the constant headache he kept getting, whenever he tried to think about anything even vaguely related to it. “To make you forget. I thought… I don’t know what I thought back then, he said it was the best choice and I believed him. But when I saw him with you, the way he looked at you… He’s never looked at Ginny like that.”
He washes his face on Friday night, wanting nothing more than to vanish after this dreadful week he’s had. He just happens to look at his eyes in the rickety mirror hanging over the sink. There are dark smudges under them. His mirror self moves its mouth at him in a stutter.
“Ah. Going Zen on me, I see,” Pansy teases. “You are getting quite good at that. If I recall correctly, it’s been seventeen hours since you turned my burlesque hat into a yellow pickle.”
Draco swallowed against the taste of bile in his mouth. He felt empty, as if his insides had been carved right out and he couldn't
“I see,” Draco says, his voice somewhere between disbelief and disappointment. Her Reducto used to be quite powerful. “So, an argument.”
Draco tries to find the words, but they're elusive. He holds on tight when Harry tries to free his arm.
“Fine, whatever. Can I be your shag again?” Except Potter’s pity face is somehow tugging at the strings of his heart. “I’ll be a good boy. Fingers crossed.”
, that’s what he was. And if he was honest, said sycophants were just following the Golden Rule all Death Eater born sprog must abide to: obey their parents’ orders to death, or something of the like. Draco did deviate from that part of the script for as long as he could. At least up until sixth year. Then again, he must have done a crap job of it because, by the time he wanted to back out, he couldn’t. By that time, the Dark Lord and his cronies were already chumming it up back at his parents’ manor, and the consequences for disobedience were too close to ignore, not to mention way too horrifying to risk.
He takes Harry's cock into his mouth and bobs his head a few times, experimentally, gazing up at Harry the whole time. There's something stormy and unreadable in Harry's eyes, and Draco can't seem to look away from them. His own cock is impossibly hard, pushing against the fabric of his trousers, and he wonders momentarily if he could come just from this. If he could come in his pants like a teenager having his first time just from watching Harry getting closer. From knowing he's the one doing this to Harry, from turning Harry into this mess of a person who can only speak in strings of swear words.
“I no longer drink.” Draco lifts one eyebrow, mockingly. “What with the pregnancy and all, remember?”
The sheets drop off him. Potter is still covered by them. At least he hasn’t woken up, and that’s good. The air smells of morning, clean and normal and
"Well, then give the boy a break," Pansy tells him, resting a hand on his shoulder. "Come on, let's go get some coffee."
The next time he wakes up it’s because his hair is tickling his nose, and there’s a constant noise in the background that sounds quite a bit like the scribbling of a quill on parchment, so he rolls on his back, stretches, and sits up. The floor feels cold beneath his naked feet.
Afterwards, Potter gets dressed. He’s quiet, so quiet all through it. Draco watches his chest, sees the slow tense breath in. Then, he watches Potter’s face, that mouth, frowning. It really doesn’t look good. It doesn’t look good at all.
here, even if what he’s doing right is actually sucking some bloke’s prick, because at least that bloke is Potter and it’s been ages since he’s felt like this.
“Sure,” Draco answers, having no clue who this Lily person is. It seems Ginevra thinks he knows though, best to let her think he does. “I’ll let him know.”
He never expected Potter to turn away from him. He never expected to have to follow him up the stairs, to have to call out "Harry, wait!" just to get Potter to stop and look at him. And he certainly never expected to regret it. He never expected the unyielding ice in Potter's gaze—flat, colder than Father's cell in Azkaban. Good grief, Potter's eyes would have made the Dark Lord's glare seem cheerful.
“Oh, he has.” Draco chuckles. More than, even. Potter healed him, brought him here—but then again, Pans is excessively proud of herself when it comes to seeing through other people, and Draco’s not too keen on feeding cats that, to his view, are already quite chubby, so he swallows that, brings up something else, and remembers to ask for his laptop. They end up talking and talking for ages, until she has to leave to one of her dates.
. “Well, chop chop. Don’t just stay here, go on and fix it!” And as she turned and ran, Harry yelled, “And make it fast! I have a date this afternoon!”
“Aren’t I?” she says, smiling. “You weren’t so bad yourself, I have to admit, though I always stood behind Harry…”
He’s not even sure he wants Harry to know that. Ever. He’d give his world for it to be mutual, for Potter to feel the way he feels about him, but he can’t say that. Not with the future of his child up in the air and swinging, so he puts his hands on Potter’s shoulders, and kisses him.
They didn't know what it had been like, having the Dark Lord stationed in his family's home. They had never had to watch in despair as their parents were ordered around like servants, and while they might have occasionally gone to bed with the deep fear that they'd be murdered before they woke, there was no way for them to know that it'd been the exact same for Draco—every single night, he'd feared for his life. But they couldn't know that.
, but needless to say, he doesn't get that pleasure. As soon as he opens his mouth to speak, he's—again—too busy emptying his stomach down the toilet to try to make words.
Harry nods, solemnly. “Maybe. If you’d like to.” It’s obvious this tiny step means a lot to him. Draco can see in Harry’s face, how hard he’s trying not to let it show. He is quite content to go with that. It obviously means quite a bit to him, too, perhaps even more than it means to Harry.
why he's here now, that he wants that feeling again and again because at least that's something Draco is willing to give. Something he wants to give.
“So, he obviously cares about you, you twat. Granted, in some bizarre manly way that involves massive frowning-slash-staring contests between you two. Still, it doesn’t take a genius to see he’s interested. Honestly, did you sleep through your trial or what?”
"No," Draco interjects. "No, I wasn't the one who ran away. I wasn't the one who went around making promises I couldn't keep, you don't get to blame me for—"
It’s nothing but a suggestion. But somehow a suggestion that’s now stuck in his mind, and no matter how hard he shakes his head it’s… well, it’s not leaving.
his way and be done with him. It's absurd how much he wants that. In fact, Draco is quite sure he's never wanted anything this much.
He slides his foot a tiny bit to the right, just until it’s barely brushing against Potter’s ankle. Nothing but a light caress.
“Oof… I’m having an awful day,” she replies. “My washing machine started spitting water at me this morning. Just like that, out of nothing!”
bonded. That’s what you told me that night. Now, I guess,” she adds, mockingly, “we both finally know to whom.”
, not against the Dark Lord. He doesn’t even want to imagine a world where the Dark Lord wins the war. The Dark Lord
"Perhaps." Potter scrubs his face. "Only then I took it to Hermione and she told me this is actually a potion meant for pregnant wizards."
He swears to himself, that night, he’ll never let Pansy delude him into thinking his life can be better than it is, because it can’t. His life is never going to be better. He doesn’t even deserve for it to be better. What was he
“Really. He must be freaking blind. Even I can see it, and he gets to see you daily,” she goes on. “Puh—lease. You
They lay together in the foggy aftermath of orgasm, both of them motionless, both of them collapsed on top of Potter's shapeless couch. Draco can feel Potter's cock softening inside him, he can feel Potter's come sliding out of him drip by drip, and it's so close to perfection in every aspect Draco's almost terrified it'll have to end.
Draco’s too tired to have dinner—though he does, if only for the baby. He feels so sad, so empty, days grow longer and longer, and not even Walburga’s preaching or Kreacher’s constant bowing manage to pull him out of the emptiness growing in him.
He'd tell him everything. He'd tell him about the dreams and how he'd been in love with him for years. He'd tell him that there was no one else he wanted to spend his life with, that only Harry mattered. He'd confess he'd been far too scared, weighed down by his parents' expectations, by the war, by his own guilt. Far too terrified all along to ever really fight for what he wanted, but he'd be ready to do so then.
“I’m not trying to mess with your mind,” Potter tries to explain, even as Draco is backing up, trying to keep Potter’s hands off him. “I wouldn’t… look, if I could go back I’d change everything, I’d change it all. I’d do it all over again and better, but I can’t.” Of course he can’t. “All we have is now. I mean it, Draco, I really mean it, I still love you.” Draco really doesn’t want to believe that, believe any of Potter’s words. But Potter does look rather desperate, as if he’s the last string of sanity Potter’s trying to grasp, to cling to. “I love you as much as I did before.”
If he had, he might have gone about it a bit differently. There might have been apologies and late night dinners at expensive restaurants, getting to know each other—birthday presents, valentines, mistletoe kisses. There might have been, most importantly, a brief period called dating before the actual falling into bed together. Because Draco is most definitely not a cock slut. Even if he's feeling a lot like one at the moment because there hasn't been any of that.
"I thought I might as well take it with me and find out what you were trying to hide. You must admit it looks a bit suspicious when your supposedly gay lover keeps potions for pregnant women in his kitchen."
He goes upstairs then, to pick up Scorpius. On his way out, he kisses Potter’s cheek. “I’ll be back tomorrow,” he says. His cheeks aren’t red. He’s not feeling embarrassed here, not at all.
again, only looking up when he hears Harry’s footsteps coming closer. He pauses for a moment there, admiring the way his hips look beneath those awful torn jeans he keeps wearing. He could always set them aflame, he thinks, one eyebrow lifted. One little
The room falls into silence, nothing but their soft breathing to break it. It's the happiest Draco has been in years—here, collapsed under Harry Potter, in a room that smells like sex and sweat. Sure, it's far from a fairy tale ending, but it works for him all the same.
"Indeed, an easy win," he said, and Draco breathed out a sigh of relief. "Who would have thought you had a sense of humour?"
“Go then, he must be hoping you get there. Save him from that lass.” She smiles a smile tanged with sweetness, all while Draco tries his hardest to mutter the chuckle that comes with that image: Harry Potter, come buy now a new lady version of everyone’s favourite hero! “He’s a tiny little cherub, your son…”
“When you got sloshed up on the roof, after the Dark Lord ordered you to fix that cabinet. You tried and tried and nothing worked, and one day you lost it, you stole one bottle of Finnigan’s Firewhisky and dragged me all the way up to—”
“You look like shit,” Draco says, even though Potter doesn’t. Even being such a mess as he is these days, Draco would still gladly lick his feet and ask for more. He’d facepalm here—over his shame, over his rather stupid feelings that refuse to go away—if it weren’t too obvious a move. He knows he’s only said that because he wants to see pain in Potter’s eyes. He wants Potter to hurt, like Draco did, for
It’s what Draco has been hoping to hear for quite a while. It only hurts that it comes now, after his tiny fight with Weasel, after Harry fucked him like the whore he is—
“You don’t get to do that.” It’s a plea. A plea that comes out as a threat. “You don’t get to mess with my mind anymore.” Draco swallows. Not again.
"You're always talking and it's very distracting—" Potter says when he pulls back, but that's as far as he gets before Draco drags him back in, forcibly shoving his tongue into Potter's open mouth.
Draco watches through the window as white swallows the roofs, buries the trees outside one by one until they no longer exist. He's always cold these days, despite his magic—cold and lonely; at least the ducks had been company, even if they couldn't talk back. His mother talks to him, but all she has to offer are vacuous statements or questions Draco doesn't want to answer.
,” he hisses when a glass breaks, fractured pieces falling from his fingers. Dark red drops spot the table below him. It almost looks like Potter’s scar. Half a week has gone by now, and things here, are not getting better.
Potter huffs, looking away. "It'd better have, it's for my patients. Why did you have to go with one of your stupid variations anyway? Why not just brew the normal thing and be done with—"
"I know I did. I just—I never meant any of it, I was so angry that you'd been keeping things from me that I assumed—"
Upon Potter’s clearly audible gibbering, Draco shuts him up with a, “Is it my fault you prefer to remain oblivious to current events?” Mostly because ‘I like to pretend my life is normal’ isn’t something he’d like to share. At least not with Potter.
Draco clenches his hands into fists so hard his nails dig into his palms. "Mother, there will be no wedding."
Because he'd been in love with the prat ever since the day Potter had walked into his shop, claiming to be hiding from the press, or since he'd saved Draco from the fire in the Room of Hidden Things, perhaps even before that, "—because he wants to."
Draco and Pansy had been sitting side by side when Potter walked in. The eighth year common room was nearly empty, the fire crackled soothingly in the hearth, and Pansy might have been telling him about that girl in the Hufflepuff team, the one everyone thought was pregnant but no one actually knew by whom. Draco can no longer remember the details—in fact, he's not even sure he'd been paying attention.
"Well, she did have a few things to say to me, apparently." Potter pauses in his pacing to look at Draco. "I'm sorry about . . . I shouldn't have said the things I said to you."
Pansy is still looking at him with her mouth drawn into a fine line and a concerned look in her eyes. Draco licks his lips because they're suddenly dry, and then he just tries to breathe normally and not panic as he says, "If I tell you, you can't tell anyone about it. I mean that, Pans, silent as the grave, otherwise the—"
"I wouldn't actually need to say anything if he took his work seriously," Potter snaps back. Pansy's hand is gone in an instant.
Sure, he spends most of his nights thinking about it, but he doesn't mention that to Pansy—he never mentions that to
“Anything?” Draco asks, because this is too good to let go. He has a rather long list of things he’d like to ask for: love, cash, admiration, self-esteem… the luck Potter vilely stole from him, now eleven years ago. He’d like to have all that back. Sadly, Potter’s magic owns not fate, and fate is nothing but irredeemable chaos. Draco knows that much, his own life is more than proof of it.
Kreacher would probably never wear it, given what it means. But that doesn’t mean Draco could not try, does it? Not wearing something is not exactly the opposite of wanting to own it, and Kreacher clearly fits there…
When he finally manages to get a word in, he says, “I had a bit of a mishap,” and launches into a full explanation, (obviously leaving out all things on Miller and the gory details of his visit there), which only ends when he gets to, “I’m at one of his properties now.”
Draco wakes up all of a sudden, a taut shudder running through him. Pansy is caressing his hair. “You’re fine,” she keeps saying, “you’re fine. It’s all fine.”
“Or... oh, I know! Stories. Yes,” she paused, nodding, “that’s it. Stories are sort of a cycle, too. See, to start one, you need to have a premise. All stories start with an exposition where you introduce your main character or characters, their setting, et cetera.”
Whatever, Draco thinks, mostly because at least he’s not the one trying to pull one on someone here. Love-hate, he thinks. Lean towards love, Zen is the way to go, he thinks. Do not kill her, she’s still your friend. Be Nice to Your Friends is his new motto. It’s a shame he doesn’t have one of those ‘webcams’, he’d likely be quite proud of his troll video right now. Still, he goes to the Albany the next day, mostly because it’s either that or spreading his legs for Patterson, whose breath smells like a farting Kneazle.
Later that day, he finds out who Lily is. He also happens to find out that Harry can say goodbye to his Crup, named after his mother, for it’s never coming back.
’s a surprise, this is still England after all. Besides, they did mention it on the weather forecast this morning.
"Ow," Draco whines, "and now you're trying to maim me or some—" but Potter simply straddles him and cuts him off him with a kiss.
And Harry doesn't once touch Draco. Not even when he spills down Draco's throat, besting him by only a few seconds.
Potter shrugged. "Sort of. It's some sort of potion, apparently—Neville's potion. They just don't know what it was, not exactly."
It's only when he goes back home on Thursday night and Potter is there waiting for him that he manages to forget for a while—when he feels Potter's breath on the back of his neck as he slips inside, he gets to pretend everything is fine; as Potter fucks him over the kitchen table, he gets to pretend he's not completely, miserably alone, fooling himself into staying in a relationship that's not actually real, with a person who couldn't care less about him unless he's naked and spread out on his back.
And so while Pansy makes him a cup of tea, Draco sits up and puts on the blue cashmere V-neck Mother sent him last Yule, and a pair of dark trousers that now feel several sizes too tight at the waist—it's been happening so often lately that he's actually become pretty adept at ignoring it. The kitchen's floor is cold under his naked feet and yet his eyelids still feel heavy, so heavy, almost as though they're weighed down by boulders.
, Skeeter! He’s spent most of the evening following Harry around, saying hello to this and that person. Generally acting as his shield, at least whenever reporters come anywhere near them. He’s certainly missed this. Half his childhood was spent in parties like this one, along with his parents, chumming with the big boys at the Ministry. It’s been gone from his life for too long now. He thinks he’s doing quite well so far, so well in fact that Weasley is almost being civil to him. Quite a joke, if you ask Draco…
, and it hurts, it hurts so much. It hurts because Draco did have to work hard to land this job, and because it's true that Potter could have him fired. But most importantly, it hurts because Draco still remembers the warmth of Potter's ankle next to his back in eighth year, and he remembers how badly he'd wanted Potter to feel the same way. He remembers with remarkable vividness how he spread his legs for Potter back then, how he sank down on his cock, nervous like the virgin he wasn't. And he remembers how Potter never actually returned his feelings.
here, because it’s all changing too fast and he’s not sure he likes where it’s going. Not when it makes his chest ache.
“He doesn’t know?” Blaise asks, looking quite fixedly at Potter. Then, he turns to Draco, mischief glinting in his eyes. “You haven’t even told him, have you?”
He doesn’t even know what he’s asking, what right he’s got, and Miller blinks at him, slowly, like nothing here makes sense, until he sees it…
When he tries to wank himself to sleep that night, Potter laying naked next to him is all he can picture. "No, no, no," Draco whispers hysterically to himself, "bloody hell, fuck me," because he can see Potter's eyelids drooping as he pulls slowly at his cock. Because it's the memory of Potter's lips against his own what finally pushes Draco over the edge. Because he comes all over his hand while thinking about Potter, who could have had him fired earlier this month. Because, Merlin, he needs help.
Draco turns his head towards her. "Potter is a complete bastard and I hate his guts to the moon and back," he says swiftly, then takes a large swig of the firewhisky he's been nursing for the past half-hour, and holds his glass out for a refill.
“Let me do this,” Draco says. “I want to.” Oddly enough, he’s not lying this time. He wouldn’t now, he thinks he’s past lying; lying’s left behind last month, when he actually began caring. And he knows what Potter’s thinking and why his eyes look dark and anxious. But this is different. He’s not his wife, but he knows Potter wants him. He gives Potter a little stroke. His hips jerk before he makes himself still.
Potter's house isn't anything like what Draco had been expecting. It's dark, his shelves are full of old tomes and relics, and the curtains are a heavy green braid. "I wasn't expecting your place to look quite like this," he ends up saying, for lack of anything better to say.
"Well, go on then." Robards waves him off with an irritated frown, and Draco walks calmly out of his boss' office.
must have been messing with his mind at some point, and he can’t say who. It’s a blank spot, but a blank spot that
Potter's muscles feel tense under Draco's hand, but they soften marginally as his mouth brushes Potter's, and a lot more when his lips part. Draco does his best to pour everything he's felt these past few months into this kiss—all his hate, all his anger, all the love Pansy claims he feels. He thinks, when he pulls away, that he must have done a fairly good job—Potter is just standing there, panting, looking for all the world like he's just been handed a puzzle he's not sure he can solve.
Draco somehow manages to give her a small smile, but still, she doesn't seem entirely convinced he's all right when she leaves, and he's pretty sure he knows why. She's still his flatmate, after all. He knows she's heard him rant about Potter over a dozen times, about how unbearable Potter is at work and how determined Draco is to knock that contemptuous look off Potter's face. She must know Draco is determined to do his job properly. That he's determined to prove that he's better than Potter this time around—better than Potter thinks he is, anyway.
Draco heard himself say, "Sure," in a voice that wasn't even his own—a voice that sounded far too weak to be his own—and that was that.
“It will give you one male child, no more,” he recalls Mother saying. “It will go into effect when you are past eighteen, if you ever bond to someone while still childless.” He sees it now, that him being fond of boys never really mattered. At least not to her, not to them. Certainly not to the succession line. He can’t help laughing, a bit on the hysterical side. As long as he finds someone he loves, that ridiculous spell will do all the work needed, regardless of how he feels about it. The dismal bit of all this is he has no clue how he feels about it. Partly glad, partly bitter. Definitely heartbroken. Merlin, what will Potter do when—
"I never slept with anyone else," he tells Pansy, "not since that first night." When he panicked and fled to her home. When this whole mad thing was set into motion.
“See, I don’t think she does make you happy, I don’t think she can.” Wrapping his arms around Potter’s waist, Draco says, “I don’t think you are, I don’t even think she’s what you want.” Every syllable, every word, brushing his lips gently against one side of Potter’s throat. “I think you want this. I think…” Potter draws in air, his chest pressing against the skin of Draco’s arms. “I think you want me,” Draco murmurs against his neck. There’s a gasp for answer, and somehow that gives him the courage he’s always lacked. “You want
“Yes, come on.” His voice makes Potter shudder, either from the warmth on his neck or perhaps from Draco’s words—he knows what they mean, how could he not? It’s not like Draco knows which one it is, but regardless he’s quite pleased. He can’t help himself. “‘It’s cold out there, but it’s warm in bed’,” he croons, quoting a song Potter should know. Somehow, it doesn’t look like he gets it. “I need you. Don’t make me fuck myself.”
Hermione, the poor lass, stayed behind him, still trying to explain to Ron whatever it was they had her doing these days was. “Some curses work a bit like a cycle,” she said, “like, think of time, for instance. Time is a cycle.”
But at least they're kind to him, and they don't flinch away when his Dark Mark peeks out from under his sleeve. Draco guesses that's the best he could have hoped for, considering. Even if their speaking in hushed tones over his head is setting him a bit on edge.
"What are you going to do?" Pansy asks. She's sitting on Draco's couch with Draco's head resting on her lap—the exact same couch Potter had lounged on all those months ago, when he'd come back after that first one night stand that wasn't really.
He wakes up the next day, along with a massive hangover, and goes back to his life as it is nowadays. Yes, sure, Corbyn, labeled five. He’ll go to Walker’s place tonight. No issues, it’s all fine.
Draco stops abruptly when he reaches the backdoor. "You wanted an answer," he says without looking at Potter. "I don't know. That's my answer. I don't know if I should go back with you, it didn't exactly work out for me the last time I agreed to one of your ideas, did it?"
Harry looks up then, briefly, and Draco can't read him at all—but he figures the strong set of his jaw as his eyes meet Draco's can't mean anything good.
But, if Potter would rather believe falsehoods, Draco is certainly not planning to be the one to stop him. Then again, this whole relationship between them is based on a giant lie: Draco is clearly not an escort, and has never been one indeed! As a matter of fact, the only reason why he is still here is because—woe, poor self—his psycho boyfriend allegedly lost his temper, and somehow decided he might as well punch Draco’s face until his nose was pulped and he sagged to the ground, whimpering softly, his hands clenched around his chest.
One of his hands on Draco’s hip, pulling him back onto his prick. He feels a shift behind him. The angle changes, the pace speeds up and up. The hand on his hips lifts and comes heavy between his shoulder blades, pinning him in place to take the final few pushes inside him. There’s a cut-off moan. A sigh. Miller stills, and then there is just breathing.
Draco’s eyes fly down to his wrist. Potter’s hand is still around it. It feels damp, pressing into Draco’s skin. His whole body suddenly feels cold, colder than ice mid-winter, colder than he’s ever felt before and he can swear every living cell in him
to be. He has a long list of people he’s slept with; Potter is definitely not one of them, but to have him wriggle against him, pressing their hips tight together whenever Draco finds a good spot to suck on, Merlin. It’s pretty much like heaven rediscovered, and Draco is quite pleased with that. He’s only just found out Potter likes having his neck kissed—did he know that already?
Nearly four full months of memories in the room behind Potter, that were now worth nothing when all Potter could recall was doing what had to be done. Even the phrasing sounded callous.
He concentrates hard on the cracked plaster on the wall. He knows the room is hot, uncomfortably hot with so many people, but he feels cold inside, almost as if his heart had been replaced with an icicle. It's a mad thought, but some even crazier corner of his brain suggests it might not be an impossibility, and he wants to—
. Yadda yadda yadda, blahdy blahdy blah. Draco frowns, reaching for his cup of tea. For some odd reason, there has never been a headline reading:
, a bed. They talk little and shag much. It’s amazing, Draco thinks, because while the sex is breathtaking, he’s not too sure a chat would lead them anywhere useful.
Harry laughed, and Draco joined in his laughter—but deep inside, he felt hollow. He wondered if that wasn't exactly what Potter was to him. His very own cursed violin, the one who'd eventually ruin his life.
Days got shorter. He literally couldn’t remember that last time he slept and, apparently, the amount of ghosts in his house just kept growing and growing.
“I don’t want to hear your apologies now,” she hisses. “It was years ago and I’m over it.” And she might be, but Draco feels awful. She’s been letting him stay at her house, with that constantly hanging between them. He’s quite sure there was never an apology on his side—how could he even apologise for something he can’t even recall? “You know, now that I think of it, the funniest part of that night is that you can’t even remember it now, when it actually
“What?” he asks. At Pansy’s lack of reply, he glances up, only to find Pans smirking down at him like one of the pros online. (Draco has seen them on that YouTube thing Muggles watch. He quite likes it. They tend to call themselves trolls, Salazar knows why, especially since they’re all too tiny to look in anyway trollish.) “No.” Draco’s eyes narrow. He knows where this is going and, “Pans,
Somehow, his ‘nothing’ prompts Potter to snort. “Right. That must be the reason you wound up here. Because nothing happened, and life’s just peachy.”
. His entire world, reduced to bucking helplessly against Potter’s face, and it’s rushed, and sloppy, but he’s so, so close…
It's magical. They're nearly alone in the room, and Draco doesn't even balk when Potter kisses him, and he doesn't question it when Potter offers to walk him home. They're standing in Draco's doorway when Draco says, "You know, I used to call you the new Dark Lord."
them all. The acrid smell of smoke and burnt parchment fills the room, clinging to Draco's clothes as if it were a solid eroding presence, making his eyes itch as he dips his quill into the ink bottle.
Draco moved closer then, he moved until their lips were barely inches from each other. "So do Slytherins," he whispered, "we just like to call them threats."
Straightening his shoulders, Draco snaps out of his thoughts. His break has been over for two minutes. He goes back to the kitchen, rather sure Naomi in there has a few orders ready for him to serve.
“It’s all right,” Potter finishes his sentence when the pause gets a bit too long, “you don’t have to tell me. I was just curious.”
And that’s the last thing Draco remembers saying. Mostly because he was too tired, too empty. He’s not what he used to be—the fighter in him died screaming a long, long time ago. Let him do what he wants sang to him, so he shut his eyes and swang to the rhymes of nothing, till nothing becomes all in a world made of dreams. He wasn’t sure he wanted to go back there. Just as he’s not sure he wants to be awake.
Still, Draco guessed that would be the end of his and Potter's truce, and for a moment, he was almost too afraid to look back up, to see the disgust in Potter's eyes. But much to his surprise, Potter simply laughed.
Robards' Patronus would wake him in the wee hours of the morning one Thursday. "Auror Potter's partner has been injured," its thready voice would say, "we need you to take his place in the field."
It's almost as if time had stopped. Everything seems to have slowed down around them, making the silence in the room feel deafening. It's so quiet Draco can almost hear his own heart thumping away in his chest—too fast, too loud—and he has no idea how to stop this, how to make any of this better.
Harry rents a small studio near the Collegiata, but visits Draco everyday. He brings him sweets and flowers and chocolates, and takes Draco out to dinner almost constantly. In some ways, it feels a bit like a dream.
“Oh no, dear, trust me, it doesn’t. Not even in the slightest way. To you though, it might.” Draco’s gaze follows her movements on her way to the chimney. “You know what’s hilarious though?”
"But right now," Potter goes on, looking up at Draco with his lips slightly parted and an intense look in his eyes, "what I'd really like to do right now is bend you over the back of this couch. And then I'd like to fuck you, again. I'd like to—" his fingers slip into the gap between Draco's thighs. Every word out of Potter's mouth seems to drag along Draco's nerve endings, slowly, deliberately, sending warm shivers up his spine, "—make you come so hard and so often that by the end of it my name is all you can breathe—"
used to have such an ample variety of topics, whereas nowadays, since the Dark Lord’s offed, it’s been drastically reduced to one subject matter:
that got burnt, but whatever. In any case, his waiter was gone now, and Merlin, his hand really did hurt quite a bit...
"But . . ." Draco pressed his hand against the wall. It was still there. It wasn't going anywhere. It was tall enough that he couldn't even reach the end of it. "This cannot be happening," he mumbled, the beginnings of panic making his voice rise. "Where the hell is Pomfrey? Does she know what this is? Has she—has she told you?"
Zabini is smirking at him, the prat, like he’s the king of kings, like ruining Draco’s life is all he ever lived for. And perhaps it is.
“I…” Draco bites his lip. His world is sinking. He can feel it. “It may be, slightly? I mean, some parts of it”—and the words want out, dear Merlin. Draco, shut up. Shut up or lie, do
Draco certainly hopes he will, and deep down, he knows it's not the first time this has happened. But this time, he knows getting over Potter is going to be much, much harder.
“Oh. Morning,” says Draco, just pulled out of the mess that his mind is these days. He leaves his cup of tea on the kitchen desk. “I trust you slept well?”
"Unlike you?" Draco says at last, and he's caught off guard when Potter laughs and rolls them over on the bed, holding Draco down.
"You didn't just fuck him, Draco," she tells him slowly, as if she were disclosing one of the great truths of the universe, "you actually went and fell in love with him."
right next to him. Only he's not going to sleep forever. He'll wake up eventually and there'll be questions then, he'll give Draco his best apologetic look, all while trying to explain that this was clearly a mistake, that they'd been drunk out of their wits, that this means nothing.
. What better way to start the day? At least that’s what he thought up until Father’s name first showed in the cover, most often paired with the words ‘Death Eater’. (He’s not even going to mention his days in Azkaban, it’s just much easier to pretend they never happened.)
But there’s a glimpse of pain in Potter’s eyes. The shattered pieces of Draco’s heart ache burning with longing over the fling they had. They won’t let him do anything else but muttering, “Yes. All right.” After an unending sigh, he adds, “Yes, I’ll bring him back tomorrow.”
“Look, I’m not asking for him. God knows I already have, and what you said… well, it’s not like I can argue with that, can I?”
"I don't have a girlfriend." Harry bites his lip, looking down into his mug. "Ginny is just… a good friend. That's all."
"It brings bad luck to its owners. The violin . . . it's been varnished with the violinmaker's wife's blood. That's supposed to be the reason it's unlucky, why it brings tragedy into everyone's lives when they own it."
, he thinks. Confused, injured. He’s gotten his share of slaps and punches over the years, especially during the last one, yet he’s never looked quite like this. A bruised lip. He can’t even open one of his eyes. His skin hurts when he touches it—marred all over, he guesses. He also guesses he should be glad Miller mostly stuck to physical strength, glad the worst he got were a couple of stunning spells and a curse—which, luckily, wasn’t
He pictures them walking hand in hand through the Petit Trianon, toasting with champagne at midnight in front of the Eiffel tower's silhouette, and suddenly, none of this seems funny anymore. Suddenly, the pitying look Pansy is giving him makes all the sense in the world, and Draco grits his teeth and swallows against the persistent taste of jealousy trying to claw its way up his throat. Sharing has never been one of his strong points, has it? And right now, he hates that more than anything.
He has a job to do. He ought to be thinking about potions, about how to best brew them to increase their efficiency, and definitely not about how good Potter looks in his ridiculous lime green scrubs, or about how soft Potter's stupid hair felt against his fingers back in eighth year.
“Number eight. He quite liked the photo I showed him through the Floo.” She holds out a tiny piece of scroll. Doesn’t say what it is, but Draco’s guess is it may be Miller’s address—he has to Floo somewhere after all. He takes it from her on his way to the entry cupboard, where he contemplates the tiny stack of eights piled in there. No more than six.
The rest of this is, well… what it usually is. He’s done this so much and so often, it hardly matters anymore. Only, Potter feels good like this, and that’s relevant. It’s like their souls are somehow connected, he doesn’t know how, doesn’t know when or why. And whenever Potter makes that thin airless sound—like a gasp strangled, a moan stifled—Draco knows he wants more of it. He wants to hear it again, and louder. He wants Potter to moan, to let go. And Potter… Potter
“You can stay at Grimmauld for a while,” Potter offers. “Just until you’re back on your feet.” He looks a bit nervous, from the awkward tilt of his hips, to the anxious way he’s holding Draco’s chart. “I don’t know if you can cook, there’s a kitchen there… or, I guess, you can ask Kreacher to make you something edible,” he says, face screwed up. “Though I have to admit he’s not exactly good at it, most of what
And that would be fine. Not perfect, but it would work: Draco can at least do part of Pans’ shopping for her. It’s not like he expects Potter to read his notes after all, they’re not that interesting, so he says, “Yes, all right.”
"Took you long enough," Harry would say, and he'd smile at him—his real smile, the one that was a bit crooked around the edges and made Draco's insides melt like butter—and Draco would breathe out, and for once welcome the respite of honesty.
"I think . . ." Potter pauses, nervously biting his lip. "We need to talk. At least I'd like to talk to you, if that's okay."
It's like he's stuck in a Pensieve memory containing nothing but those two lines. They replay endlessly, again and again.
“Can you even get pregnant? Is that even possible?” Potter asks, lets a nervous laugh out, and Draco… Draco feels like laughing too because at least now he knows he’s not the only one at sixes and sevens here. Potter sounds as well. “I honestly thought only women could—”
If he's completely honest with himself, he's still a bit in awe that Potter would trust him to keep his mouth shut; half the Wizarding population wouldn't trust him as far as they could throw him and there are days when Draco himself isn't entirely sure he can be trusted—seeing how he can't seem to keep his past from fucking up his present even more. But apparently Potter does trust him.
Draco laughs sharply. He feels ridiculous. This whole thing feels ridiculous, and he's not even sure he's making sense. It's only when he looks up and Pansy is just watching him, brows furrowed, that it strikes him he might be making
Draco never gets invited to Harry's birthday, but he does go to Granger's in their final year. Harry is there as well, of course, but he seems intent on pretending Draco doesn't exist. And that, at least, is nothing new.
Draco smiles too, quite entertained himself because that’s all it takes to seal the deal. He’s in. Potter, apparently, is too, and perfectly aware of where this is going.
. Fenrir flashes by, Severus Snape—you can’t, you can’t, Merlin, but you want to. You want to be able to do it, to be able to cast the curse, to be able to keep Mother safe for she’s done nothing but…
"Nothing is going on, alright?" he cuts in firmly. "This is nothing like that." There's no Dark Lord, for one, and Draco hasn't sold off his freedom to anyone this time around, let alone his life.
“Oh, nothing. I’m just finding it hard to believe you managed to beat a vampire without even your wand. Are you sure you didn’t have a couple of trolls helping you?”
"I just couldn't stand it anymore," Draco says, and he's embarrassed by how desperate his voice sounds. "I couldn't stand
Potter smiles a small smile at him, and for a moment there, Draco feels so aroused, so desperately aroused it's almost surreal, and all he wants to do is bend closer for a second kiss—and likely a third and a fourth and a fifth.
Draco blinked. He pushed himself up on his thighs, moving to straddle Harry. He felt light-headed, so light-headed he could have sworn he was drunk—drunk with the knowledge that he was doing something unbearably stupid, making the one mistake that would condemn him forever. But somehow, Harry wasn't pushing him away. Harry was just holding his waist, rubbing his thumbs along Draco's hipbones.
“Rather intimate,” says Potter, finally, “with someone that night.” It puts a smirk on Draco’s face.
"Okay. So it's a potion. That's good though, isn't it? It means we just need a bezoar and then—then we can both walk out of here and go our separate—"
Harry, on the other hand, simply chuckles. “I highly doubt it,” he says. “That’s just Ron being Ron. Plus, he thinks you are.”
Sometimes, he takes a pause and compares what his life was like before the war—before everything went to hell and back, and everything he believed lost any kind of meaning it ever had to him—and what it is now. The more he thinks about it, the clearer and clearer it becomes that there’s only one single thing his current life shares with the one before. And that one constant, funnily enough, is his habit of reading the paper first thing when he wakes up. He reckons that the bright side (or perhaps the not-so-bright side) is that he still can’t seem to get his head around why he even bothers. He has a theory, albeit a flimsy one: he likes to read the
“Wait…” For a moment Potter tenses up, like he’s about to move away. Then, he settles, concentration showing on his face. “It’s not you, I just… I don’t think we should do this, not when she doesn’t know.”
“Oh, come on… please?” For a moment there, Draco hates his heart. It really should stop thumping like that, making him feel guilty over the tiny spark of hope in Potter’s eyes. He’s not the one doing something
It's true. Potter has always been, in some way, the focus of Draco's life—an anchor, keeping him grounded. He'd been someone to befriend and then, later, someone to compete against, and eventually Draco had fallen in love with him. It feels as if Draco's whole life revolves around Potter, but perhaps . . . perhaps it doesn't work both ways. Perhaps Potter has been all those things to him, but that doesn't mean Potter has to feel the same way about it.
Pansy answers the Floo call when it comes. "Harry? I thought you didn't have this—" Draco hears her says, and starts making his way to the sitting room, "—sure I'll . . . I'll let him know."
.” Harry lifted the drink to his lips. “And now he’s over there—” he pointed at them, though he was pretty sure Hermione saw nothing, or she saw him pointing towards the wall, or Merlin knows what, “—along with Fred. They’re discussing your poor taste in décor and the abundance of books stacked on piles around your floor, in case you’re even remotely interested. But you’re not, are you? Cause you can’t hear them. Because you can’t bloody
“Yes, just not with…” He makes a gesture, grabs his own wrist. He’s not even sure what he’s trying to imply here, other than anything, but please no ropes involved.
," he said, emphatically, and Draco rolled his eyes. "It was about a violin, a perfect, red-coloured violin everyone wants to get their hands on. But—" his voice lowered, "—there's a twist."
Draco sighs, putting down his wand and burying his head in his hands. "Not now, Pans," he mumbles. "Seriously, not now."
“Indeed,” he says. They both say their goodbyes, and she leaves. A while after she’s disappeared into the distance, Draco walks past the station and into the loos, where he Apparates to Potter’s doorstep.
“Like a hole within a whole,” Fred said. This time though, Harry was too slow, and he only recalled not to snort after he snorted.
"But then there are other times when you do things like my birthday, and they feel so wonderful I just don't know how to—"
Draco wants to tell him he'd cast an Impervius, that he's perfectly dry and nowhere near that useless. Instead, he finds himself being dragged to the couch, a soft mauve thing that feels oddly deformed against his backside.
Ignoring the bright glare coming in through the windows that’s beginning to hurt his eyes, Draco takes a few steps towards Potter. “What do you mean?”
“Exclusive news,” she yells for all the whole neighbourhood to hear and beyond, “Draco Malfoy stares longingly at Potter’s face all through his brunch!”
"Nothing," she says quickly, "nothing at all." She's quiet for a very long time—long enough that Draco has almost forgotten there was a conversation going on, lost as he was in his own mental replay of the previous night's events—before she speaks again. "It's just . . . he's always been special, hasn't he?"
"We're just going to the new pub across from the Hog's Head, and it'll be just for a while, we're not even going to be there that long . . ."
. “Morals, principles and all that bollocks. I doubt he’d ever let you starve. If only he knew what you’re doing with your life—”
All he knows is Potter is curled up at his feet, bleeding. He knows that, and he knows he's half-hard, and that none of this is anywhere close to normal.
And Draco feels so stranded as he pulls on last night's trousers. The clean shirt he grabs from his wardrobe feels like the last thread connecting him to reality. It's stupid, bordering on unreal—it's absolutely ridiculous—but he still finds himself standing there, clutching the expensive material in his hands so hard there'll probably be wrinkles when he wears it.
, Draco’s mind whispers, back to Weasel’s sis. But he smiles a wry smile, and says, “Sure. Don’t let me keep you.”
Miller gestures towards the couch. However, when Draco takes a couple of steps, he says, “No. Not walking.”
. The sad thing is, for once, Draco actually agrees with it. He doesn’t want to. He doesn’t want to go back there, but he can’t help it: he’s
Draco, however, still hasn’t forgotten Potter’s anger that night, as he hasn’t forgotten the motive behind it. He’s now turned to option two: if you can’t make them yours, make them at least join you. Pansy once said,
Pansy would look dashing in her too short dress, and Longbottom would look… well, some people were just beyond redemption. But Draco wouldn't care, because Harry would sit beside him at the ceremony, and whisper 'so, your place or mine?' as the couple held hands and the high wizard spoke the words of the bond.
“I’ve had to heal him all over. It was quite brutal what was done to him,” says Potter, a hint of concern hidden deep in his voice. “His muscles were—”
It's soon after that that the random vomiting starts. Morning sickness, Pansy keeps calling it, and Draco thinks the name is beyond laughable—especially when, as he soon finds out, it can happen at any point during the day.
“Good,” he says when Draco is done. For a weird moment there, Draco thinks of the sport horses for sale he saw back in Galway, when Father took him there. Oddly enough, he feels quite like one of them right now. Like he’s finally passed a trial of some sort.
“Cheers, Malfoy,” he said. His waiter stood still, then looked up, tense around the edges. “I see you’re still alive.”
It's really quite a long list: Draco's legs keep cramping, he keeps throwing up, he feels weirdly bloated most of the time—a little like a small whale to be honest, even though the weight he's gained is barely noticeable so far—and then, of course, there's the small matter of being pregnant.
“Really,” Pansy deadpans, all the while holding his gaze. “He spoke in your favour during your trial.”
Near the end of the second month, Harry goes back to England for a week. After taking a Portkey back to San Gimignano, he assures Draco—who has never even asked—that he's put all his affairs in order. He says he's talked to his team captain and told him he'd be prolonging his holiday.
He's been dozing on and off all night, cuddled up against the cold under his blankets. He wakes up when the morning sun starts drifting through the walls, but decides he's far too tired to get up. That the shop can stay closed for a day. Just one day.
makes him angry or anything; it’s nice, it feels great to be valued for something, though he’d much prefer if it were for anything else, and not his looks. He mostly thinks it would have been nicer if it had happened sooner—before the whole prostitute bit in his life, even before the bond took place.
… Draco shuts it up, shuts it down. He doesn’t yet know how right it is. “Let them dance,” he says, “we’re coming home afterwards.”
“Why didn’t you give him back his memories after the Dark Lord…” See, that part there, he didn’t get. He’s still not too sure he gets it. “Why didn’t you break the spell on me?”
Pansy's fingers comb soothingly through his hair—front to back, front to back. They're probably making a right mess of it, but right now, Draco couldn't care less. Right now, he needs her there to lean against. He needs her there to make sure he doesn't choke on the ball of sorrow that keeps trying to close up his throat.
talking to Harry, that now he can't seem to shut up. He just gets louder and louder, and he's pushing Harry back and telling him he's a bloody stupid prick with a massive death wish and a ludicrous hero complex, because
"Well, I did study Potions, and I know this particular potion will work better when brewed this way."
"Sometimes I get so confused," Draco whispers. "You really—you look so much like you did during our eighth year, only then I remember how you made my life miserable for years and . . . and we wasted so much time . . ." He sits there, toying with his sleeve, feeling mildly terrified as he strips his soul bare. "And all the while we were secretly in love with each other. How is that not stupid?"
There's yelling. There's so much yelling, and he's only vaguely aware of shoving Harry into a wall once they're back at the Ministry once the case is closed. He's gone so long without talking,
He knew he should have banned Potter from his Floo after that night. He just . . . never did. For some reason. And it definitely wasn't because he'd been hoping this might happen.
Later that evening, Draco lays back against the door to his room. The flashbacks, it’s been weeks since he’s had them.
That night, Draco lies in bed tossing and turning until the early hours of the morning. He can't sleep. He tries to, but he keeps seeing Potter's face whenever his eyes fall shut. He keeps seeing Potter looking up at him, with his lips parted and moist. He keeps seeing him spread out below him on his eighth year bed, thrusting upwards into Draco, and deep down, Draco knows he's completely screwed.
"I know it's going to be all over the papers, 'Harry Potter, getting it on with former Death Eater—"
. The Dark Lord laughs. Somewhere within his brain, Draco recalls the sound of grinding bones in Snape’s class—crash, crank, crash-crank-
, which Potter has somehow managed to get them to play even though it's been ages since its release—Draco guesses it might have involved a lot of cash or a lot of friends, or perhaps even both. Either way, he doesn't ask.
Fred rolled his eyes. “As if he’d even know who that is...” he said, and Harry had to shove back a snort as he moved forwards in the queue.
Draco's legs feel weak. He feels hypnotised, as though he can't run away fast enough from these images Potter's conjuring, as though he wants them more than anything. But he still manages, "I imagine we could come to an agreement."
Potter's hips are moving against his crotch, sinfully slow, and he'll never want to run away from this.
that’s not Potter’s choice. Potter has principles and all that. All he wants is Draco’s opinion and he’ll take it over anything else. “Do you want to have it?”
"He was just . . . he meant everything to me." Draco swallows. "Whenever he laughed, whenever we sat by his bed late at night playing wizard chess, he made me feel light inside, like I'd be able to fly without a broom if I wanted to. Sometimes—sometimes I even wanted him to stay away from me, though of course that was impossible while bonded to each other. He was just . . . horribly confusing. I felt so confused all the time."
Harry would reach a hand up, caress Draco's lower lip with his thumb, and mumble, "The Order would still have you. I'd always have you," and Draco would angle his head, just a bit, and press his lips to Harry's in a chaste kiss. He'd feel a light puff of breath against his lips right before Harry kissed him back, but Harry
Pansy, lovable twat that she is, chose that moment to enter the room, whilst Draco was in the midst of brooding over is woeful existence. She’s hit the showers already, her dark hair dried with hot air charms falls well-combed around her face. She makes a beeline for the coffee cup Draco left waiting for her on the desk. It’s takes effort not to roll his eyes at Pansy—she isn’t the only creature of habit in their shabby little apartment. Coffee is to Pansy, as the morning news is to Draco: an essential part of their routine. It should still be warm; Draco actually remembered to place a warming charm on it this time around. Her hand slides over his back on her way there. “Slept well?”
"Do not tell him I asked!" Draco yells, but it seems like he's too late as well. By the time he says that, Pansy has already left.
“You are not listening,” she explains—rather incomprehensibly, Draco thinks, since he’s been listening. “He’s a Gryffindor.” She points at Potter’s photo on the
The sky is dark on Thursday when he leaves work. There’s a chilly wind outside, blowing into his face in a quite unpleasant way, but at least it’s not strong enough to sneak under his jacket. The air feels a bit soggy, he thinks, as his hands pull the jacket closer to his chest. He reckons it might rain soon—not that
“I can’t live without you,” Potter tells him two days later. “Please, please, come back,” he begs, a week later. “What do I have to do to have you come back here,” he asks, two weeks gone by. “What do I have to do? I’ll do anything.”
"So she can parade me around town and try to marry me off to some rich pureblood or other?" Draco snorts. "I don't think so."
“He did say something, I just can’t recall what… hold on, it has to be around here, somewhere.” Searching through the stack of papers piled in front of her, she comes up with a card. She stares at it, squinting a little to read whatever’s written there. Draco is weirdly amused in his shivery state, he’s been telling her for quite a while she ought to buy a pair of specs, yet she keeps refusing. Last time he brought it up, she looked at him over her shoulder and sneered, “And throw all my glamour down the drain? No, thanks,” uptight like she is, a total berk.
Harry rang her bell a dozen times. “Open the bloody door!” he yelled, and then rang twice more before shoving his hands under his armpits. Merlin, it was freezing out there, he thought while bouncing on his feet. And anyway, what was up with her neighbour’s flowers? Seriously, those that didn’t look rotten were falling to bits. “Hermione! For fuck’s sake...”
“My, my,” she says, and maybe it is after all. My, my, release the grudge. Break now, or become stronger.
"Variations on potions brewing, particularly when it comes to the use of eel eyes instead of newt's while brewing Dreamless Sleep Potion."
"Yeah, yeah." Draco shakily rose to his feet. It was quite hard to maintain his dignity when he was still clutching his head like it was about to explode, but in all honesty, he thought he'd been doing a fairly good job. He was certainly doing a better job than Potter, who was just standing there with his arms crossed, looking for all the world like his soul had been sucked out. "Do feel free to bore me with your laments some other time, Potter. I'm out of here."
Pansy looks up at him. She chews thoughtfully. "I'm not telling you," she says, and then sticks her tongue out at him before taking another bite of her peach. "If you want to know, you'll just have to owl him and ask."
“Right, sure,” she says slowly, both her eyebrows raised in a pointed look. “Only, somehow, you don’t sound too thankful.”
"Ugh, you guys are so sickeningly sweet to each other," comes Pansy's voice from the kitchen. "For fuck's sake, Draco, just move out already."
"I could ask to have a different potions expert assigned to my orders and that'd be perfectly fine," Potter tells him when he drops by to pick up his potions. He seems so intense as he says it, so focused.
be bought, when he got kicked out for having been bought. “Those days are past, Potter. I’m not your whore.” In fact he’s not anyone’s whore, not anymore.
to do something, because he feels so fucking drained right now. He feels so wretched, and he's yelling at Potter when all he really wants to do is lie on his couch with his head on Potter's legs, and maybe talk to him about work or something—something dull that won't make Potter rage. And then perhaps Potter could tell him about his teammates, and Draco could nod along, and they could both be amused rather than angry, and wouldn't that be marvellous?
“Well, I wasn’t exactly cheap…” And there he goes again, making this all better. Go on, Draco. Why can’t he stay quiet when it matters? “… as he put it,” the last bit comes in a mumble, barely even audible to himself.
"You don't get to…" He rakes a hand through his hair, leaving it even messier than before. "You can't just do this. I'm not your bloody plaything, Malfoy."
Draco nods, and they both grimace at each other, though in truth behind Draco’s grimace hides the thought of how massively wrong they all are.
It’s stupid. He already knows what he’s done. It’s not like there’s anything he could have done to prevent it. It has nothing to do with him. Besides, Pansy sees him: she knows he’s not worthless, and that’s something. She would never blame him for what happened, even if she
On the sixteenth day however, either Potter is not on a very good mood, or his whole morning has been mud, blood and poppycock, (and therefore, not a very good mood), but when Draco reminds him, “You overlooked the sunglasses I asked for last time, remember? Classic style Aviators. Ray Ban sells them,” Potter grumbles, “What are you, an upper class hobo or what?”
Draco stares down at his hands. His fingers curl tightly around the warm china of his teacup, cradling it in his palms as his thumb strokes along the rim. He's always found Pansy's house comforting—it feels like home in ways his London flat doesn't yet, in ways the Manor hasn't in ages.
Draco never expects to hear Granger's voice coming out of their Floo room, but that's undoubtedly what he's hearing. He pauses, his fingers hovering right above the door knob as an uneasy feeling builds up in his chest.
on his laptop when she’s gone. He’s made himself a dark elf mage; it’s hilarious because it looks quite as angry as he feels, mostly at himself. (It’s also quite hilarious what Muggles think a mage can do, but that, yet again, is a tale for another time.) Twat or not, Pansy is by far the more organized of the two. Not that it matters one way or another. Even if he wanted to, Draco couldn’t take Floo calls without the risk of being recognized.
, and Draco, despite his unwillingness to defend Potter—Harry can do that himself, thanks; besides, it doesn’t look like he needs any outside help, he seems to be doing peachy at pretending all this crap is not happening—does have a bit of an issue with that last one.
, a Muggle magazine on how to work those pee-cee things they have, keeps reading. He’s quite stoked. He thinks he’s finally found out how those trolls he’s seen on YouTube record their videos. Apparently, and according to what this magazine says, he needs to check if his laptop has a ‘webcam’. He figures this ‘webcam’ thing must be some sort of camera—in truth, he’s a bit stumped: his laptop seems too small to have anything even remotely resembling a camera anywhere on it. Perhaps he should search ‘webcam’ on Google Images, just to know how one of them looks. Perhaps it looks nothing like a magical camera, who knows?
Harry's cock twitches, hard and hot between his lips, and Draco slips a hand into his own pants. He slides up and down on Harry's cock, all the while grinding hard into his own hand, and doesn't think about how he'd like to do this again and again and again until they simply
. Then again, when have they ever tried to talk before? Without spells, blasphemy and insults involved.
And eventually Harry would catch him at it. Draco's throat would feel parched, but Harry would just wink playfully back at him before mouthing 'later' and go back to work.
His hand tightened around his neck. Draco’s hands clenched around his fingers before breath ran out of him. His heart was thumping in his ears, panic rose with every heartbeat.
"I just . . . I don't understand," Potter is saying, "why didn't we use protection if you knew this could happen?"
Potter huffs then, his face contorting into an ugly grimace before he tears his eyes from Draco's. He bolts from the room. Draco stares at his leaving back before looking down at his own hands. He's trembling. He's not exactly sure what just happened, but he's trembling, alone in his lab, with a massive hard-on. At work. And he's got no idea what to do to keep this from happening again. He's got no idea how to get it to happen again either.
Pansy sits nearby all through it, apparently torn between offering encouraging smiles and trying to pat his knee whenever she can get to him. She looks about as nervous as Draco feels, and under different circumstances, Draco thinks he might have been amused—as it is though, he's mostly just grateful that she's there at all.
Harry turns on his side, his head resting on his hand. “I know. It didn’t take me too long to figure that out. My couch, down there, it never did smell of azaleas before you got here. Put two and two together and—”
“Merlin. You knew, didn’t you? The Wham song,” Draco says, covering his cheeks as heat flushes his face. “Yes, of course you knew. Bloody liar, you… you…”
"Malfoy," Potter repeated slowly, as if talking to a very small child, "somehow, I don't think this counts as a poison."
, the same green that shoots Draco’s heart dead. Except there’s a scar on his forehead, and it just happens to be lightning-shaped.
“Your wife doesn’t mind you coming here almost everyday?” he asks once, sprawling out on the far side of the couch from Potter. His feet are barely inches from Potter’s own. Draco wonders, could he, or could he not? Does Potter want to be touched? Should he… after all, it would only be a couple of inches. He could always pretend he didn’t mean to; we all make the occasional mistake.
Draco sips at his wine while he tries to imagine Potter at his job, which is what he usually talks about. Frankly, there’s too much blood in it to be anywhere near pleasant, so he tries other things, which tend to include picturing Potter naked and moaning all spread out on Regulus’ bed. He once tried to picture Potter as one of the trolls on YouTube, surprising himself when he ended up laughing. Potter produced one of his deep grins, and Draco raised his glass at him, quite glad no
“Dear God… do you have to be so harsh on me, every single time?” Potter pauses, one of his hands rubbing over his face, one of his tics when he’s nervous. It makes Draco’s chest hurt oddly. For a moment there, he rather wishes he didn’t know that much, that he’d been looking elsewhere for the few months they actually dated. Even the mere question asked makes his mind scream
Potter shrugs. "The Blacks used to live here," he admits. "I guess this might have gone to you, if Sirius hadn't left a will."
He’s alive. Alive and pregnant and alone. This time, Draco can’t hold back the sobs. Not anymore. They choke him, shake him, raking through his body as the perpetual threat he’s been living for months fades into nothing: the great lie that started it, finally exposed.
. Like something in there is missing, deleted, erased, something that used to be and isn’t, and he knows not what or when.
"… armed and dangerous, so keep that in mind," Robards is saying. "Do not take unnecessary risks. Do not engage them until back-up gets there, do you understand?"
. “To Weaselbee’s lil’ sister. It happened weeks ago, I’m quite shocked you didn’t notice. It was all over the
There's a blast of white light headed straight for Harry, and Draco knows that shade—he knows it well; he remembers it from sixth year. There's no time to counter it, and Harry's looking the other way. Harry hasn't even noticed the curse flying towards him.
Because he wants to. Because he wants Harry to want it too. Because he wants Harry to want to spend more time with him.
“You know what’s even harder to believe? That I’m still head over heels for the prat who keeps reading
Potter looks at his face then, and they share a small smile about nothing in particular, except perhaps the fact that they’re both out-balanced here, or the fact that he’s just complimented Potter on his job, and where the hell did that come from?
. He knows  he might be exaggerating here, but it seems as if every single day since the Endgame Battle all news stories posted seem to come back to Potter. He knows it’s ridiculous, but it bothers him.
“Really? And which parts exactly do you mean? Maybe the part in which he’s obviously shagged you, repeatedly, or rather the part in which you actually
Draco stays silent as well. He can feel Potter's gaze on his back all through it, but he doesn't want to stir up any more trouble. Particularly not at work.
"I could take you," Harry suggested. "I mean, it'd have to be during one of our Hogsmeade weekends, obviously, but I'm sure we could find a way to sneak out. Even with the bond still keeping us together, I'm sure we could Side-Along . . ."
Pansy shrugs. "Don't blame me, you're the one who's been acting weirdly. You were even humming some Muggle song earlier, while cooking—I mean, Muggle songs, Draco? For Merlin's sake, you don't even have a radio . . ."
That night Potter fucks him hard against the headboard, his teeth digging into Draco’s shoulder until pleasure melds into pain. Draco bites his lip and says nothing, but he curls up under the sheets when Potter’s done. When midnight comes, he’s up again, watching the pink marks on his shoulder in the bathroom’s mirror, keeping
"Seriously though, you should owl Harry," Pansy calls back from the fireplace, "he's not nearly as bad as you think."
“You don’t love me,” he tells Potter the next day. “You just want a family,” and he’s perfectly aware he’s repeating Weaselette’s words here. He’s still not sure they weren’t true. “Well, news flash for you: Scorpius is my child. He’s
“NO!” Harry shouted. “No, it’s not understandable, it’s not even... look, I saw him two days ago—yesterday, today—whatever. I went to his shop and he was
One year later, Draco is working at Morden Superstore, a small coffee shop in Muggle London, way after he’s finally managed to get his freaking passport.
“Yes, I’m sure he does.” She waves her hand in the air in dismissal. The nerve of her! “Especially on all fours, legs open. But he’s a Slytherin, love, and a smart one at that.” One of her eyebrows lifts and she adds, sarcasm implicit in her tone, “Much smarter than
“Okay. Okay, let’s.” Draco lets himself be pushed back, both their bodies molding into each other, as they always do. He can feel Potter’s already hard between his legs. He himself is quite hard too, and he’s quite aware Potter knows it. “Fuck me,” he says.
“Who’s the Healer on call?” he heard a woman saying, somewhere nearby. Another voice answered back. A man, he thinks, but it was too far and too diluted for Draco to make sense of diffident sounds and misheard words. He remembers blinking his eyes open then. The woman’s wand seemed to be glowing. Travelling around his torso, there was a warm ball of bluish light. It felt good. For a moment there, Draco felt so peaceful, unconcerned by anything else. “Well, tell him to get here
"You could come, you know? It's not like it's a private party or anything, besides, Harry will be there as—"
He reaches down, fumbling with the button on Harry's jeans. It's such a tiny thing, it slips between his fingers twice; takes forever to unhook without seeing, but Draco doesn't mind as long as Harry keeps doing that thing—that marvellous thing—with his tongue. He dips his fingers past the waistband of Harry's pants, and Harry gasps out, "Fuck," when Draco's hand wraps around his cock.
"If only the Dark Lord had known all he needed to do to take you out of commission was to give you endless supplies of treacle tart . . ." Draco trailed off then, he pressed his lips together into a tight line—it was just a stupid comment, words he didn't think through, but he'd heard them now and he could see how they could be taken the wrong way. And that was what they all thought about him, wasn't it? That Draco wanted the Dark Lord to win—only they knew nothing.
his best friend, so there's likely not much he can do about that—but still, he's on the verge of saying something cranky when a slow grin spreads across her face.
"But it's a trap! He's doing all those . . . all those good deeds—kissing babies and learning to mend bones and Merlin knows what else—but it's only so you can't see who he's become inside."
Draco can’t stop thinking about Granger’s visit on the way home. All through the night, it repeats endlessly in his head. He’s wearily conscious of every single second in it. It happens once and again, over and over despite his constant attempts to sleep. She removed her curse. She apologised miserably. “He asked me to erase your feelings for him.” A well-cast
“Would you, now…” A brief kiss. “And now you’re thinking about something, aren’t you?” Draco says, basically repeating Harry’s question back at him. “What’s on your mind?”
Pansy looks away. She reaches for the firewhisky, drinking straight from the bottle.  "Merlin," she says, "Merlin . . ."
He smiles back, tries for reassuring. He’s not feeling it yet—reassured, himself, but he’ll get there soon enough. Because he’s not going to break. Potter, however…
Draco wants to say no, he really wants to, but he's stunned silent by how much this Potter sounds like the one he got to know during their eighth year. Apparently, that's all Potter needs to go on. "Please?" he begs, reaching out to touch Draco's hand.
Draco isn't even sure he wants to anymore. He used to miss Potter so much, but he never missed him the way he is now, all anger and resentment and pretending Draco doesn't exist. He misses the version of him he got to know back then, the one whose laughs were contagious and whose smiles weren't all tight around the edges. The one he'd call Harry. But there's none of that in today's Potter—nothing for Draco to miss.
He leaves soon after. He goes back to his place—to his life—and Draco is left alone in the dark with his demons and his doubts, and every nerve in him flares with annoyance, and something else he can't quite name.
Draco drops the flask he'd been holding. He watches it fall slowly to the ground. He doesn't even react in time to cast a Levitation Charm before it crashes, falling to pieces before his eyes.
"No, I'm just telling you," Potter says. "Just so you know that actions can have consequences, particularly at work."
The Muggles talk to him sometimes, and Draco is thankful for the cold. He's glad he can wear his coat everywhere. Disillusionment Charms only go so far, and it's draining to keep them up when his magic is as unreliable as it is these days.
Draco doesn't often want to contemplate his thoughts where Potter is concerned, but right now, he'd really like to cast an
Draco rolled onto his side to look at him full on. It was funny, he thought, he'd had the Dark Lord living in his home for a full year, he'd put up with the Carrows, mad Aunt Bella and that half-breed Fenrir, and one way or another managed to survive them all. But somehow, spending the rest of his life bonded to Harry Potter felt much, much scarier than all that.
Draco never points out the faults in his reasoning. He tends to avoid introspection these days, mostly because he feels like a worthless whore, used up by everyone and…
Draco walked around, following the length of the wall—it appeared to be circular, it appeared to be built around Potter, and Draco had to fight back sobs, fight back hysterical laughter because Potter, Potter, Potter, why was everything always about him?
Tension seizes him for a split second, his shoulders going ramrod straight before going limp in his chair in defeat. The best defence he can manage is muttering a rather terse, “I didn’t exactly get to pick my side of the fence.”
“So, basically, you’ve been lying to her all along.” Draco’s not sure why or how, but something inside him leaps, quite pleased. Even the Bravest and Greatest Gryffindor still has some secrets to hide, and one of them just happens to be him.
which, thankfully, she doesn’t. For all she knows, he is just a tad unlucky in his choices, and that’s that.
them, even when I had no idea what they were about—because he was funny, I guess, or perhaps because he looked so happy then. I don't know." He takes a deep breath before saying, "And then one day, he was just . . . gone. From one day to the next, he was gone."
"I just fell asleep, Pans." Draco rolls onto his back, stretching his muscles until his back cracks and his shoulders tremble, and he's left feeling a bit light-headed. He's missed breakfast and lunch, and yet he's still so bloody tired. If he could, he thinks he would sleep all day—only now Pansy is here, and he's somehow managed to upset her. "I'm fine."
It didn’t seem incredibly relevant at the time though, so he moved on. “Hi, Fred,” he said to the ghost that (everyone else said) wasn’t but was often there. Or had been for quite a while. “Have a good night?”
“Yes.” Draco steps back, panting for air. “Yes, please. Fuck me here, fuck me against the wall, fuck me hard…”
to him, and that’s something he hasn’t found anywhere else. Even his coworkers are rather pleasant, none of them too bothered by his ‘failed relationship’ which, mystery of mysteries, left him with a child.
Harry hisses and moans somewhere above him, and Draco can hear the dull thud of his fist hitting the wall when Draco goes deep on him, another muttered, "Fuck," every time the tip of his erection hits the back of Draco's mouth. It's a manic dream, it's exhilarating, and Draco is trying his best not to come just yet because he
Pansy's lips tighten and her nostrils flare, but all she says is, "Oh, Draco," and then, "I still think you shouldn't have to go through this alone."
"And you're always so sweet to me, dear. I don't know what I'd do without you," she shoots right back, holding a hand dramatically to her chest. It's gone in an instant, replaced by her elbows on the tablecloth as she leans forward. "Anyway, do tell," she says, in the sort of lowered tone used for secrets and confessions, "how was it?"
Draco dares a little grimace back—it's not as if Pansy is going to think less of him; she knows him well enough. "I just wish you'd stay away from those Muggle acronyms."
There’s a long pause, quite a bit of glaring involved. But afterwards, Potter says, “I’m sorry. You can have your sunglasses, okay?” and, “Look, why don’t you give your notes to Kreacher. He’ll do the shopping, and I’ll pay for it.”
"Figures. And are you going to tell him about . . ." Pansy trails off, gesturing awkwardly towards his stomach.
“Oh, yes. She definitely has.” But lets not forget here that that spell was cast on Potter’s orders.
He guesses he should have, what with all the worrying he's been doing about this the past few weeks—at night, when Potter tiptoed around the flat; some mornings, when Draco caught him rummaging through the drawers in his potion cabinet, looking for a Hangover Remedy or a Headache Banishing Potion. And Draco took extra care to keep the cabinet well-stocked. He even went as far as to cast a Disillusionment Charm on every single one of the vials he got from the mediwizards at St Mungo's—even the ones that were just vitamins.
"It's madness, that's what it is! It's just—look, all I'm saying is that people don't go from being linked at the hip to hating each other in a matter of seconds."
After a long, long shower, he clears enough condensation off the mirror to be able to see his face—at least a tiny bit of it, he’s not quite sure he wants to see it in full detail. He’s aware he’s getting thinner. He’s perfectly aware the amount of Firewhisky he’s consuming these days only exacerbates the dark shadows under his eyes. He’s aware that it really needs to drop, but he’s also aware that that’s certainly not going to happen anytime soon. That it’s not likely to drop ever, and Merlin knows that if it does, he’ll start contemplating nooses as a chance-slash-possible way out, because, no. Plus, he’s sworn to Pansy no more Sleeping Draughts, not after last time…
—and that Potter's mouth is harsh against his own. Ruthless. Draco presses his lips against Potter's even more brutally, and just like that, Potter's lips part for him. Potter's tongue glides forwards, effortlessly into Draco's mouth. It's funny how everything between them keeps turning into a competition. Even now. Even this. It's funny how he's just as determined to win this one as he was all those times before. It's funny how Potter is as well.
Choices are such tricky business though. Every day brings new ones, and even now, Draco keeps making all the wrong ones.
“Oh, sweet Merlin…” Draco shudders, grips Potter’s forearms. Bites his lip again. Potter really looks quite focussed down there, but focussed in a good way, in a way that’s making Draco shiver all over when Harry licks one of his nipples. “Do that again.”
, like he’s a child who can’t sit still, who keeps asking for meat instead of vegetables, who can’t even look after himself. Like he’s a child, which he’s
So he sits there for ages, mostly watching, quite boredly. He looks through the menu—not that he’s going to order anything else, thanks—then fiddles a bit with the napkin on his table, mostly because
On the short walk from the Ministry to the nearest Starbucks, (only, Merlin knows why, but Ron had turned into quite a Huge Fan of them in the last few years, caps and all), Hermione kept talking about this new thing they had her doing all the way down there — in the Department of Mysteries, which is where she worked. Both Harry and Ron had gone mad the first few months, calling her Unspeakable and whatnot, but right now it was just old news is old.
Some of them notice anyway, and he once slips and tells one of them he's pregnant. The man seems shocked at first, but then he just laughs and slaps Draco's back like he's just heard a particularly good joke.
“Quite,” Draco lies smoothly. He’s never sure if Pansy buys it or not, what with her poker face, but takes it as a good sign when she moves on to change the subject.
"I don't know, Draco." Pansy sighs. "Obviously, you must know him better than I do by now, but I keep thinking—I know I told you he'd never leave his girlfriend for you, but don't you think he might now, if only you'd tell him . . ."
"Yes," Draco says, even though he really means no. So far, he's only managed to decide that the first love is the only one that matters.
, possibly a hand included palm inwards, sticking two fingers up at Potter. “I’m not getting rid of it.”
shut up and listen. I don’t want you to mess this up again, you already did once and it nearly—” She grabs his wrist, pulling him back. “Listen to me, you twat. Do you remember what you said to me back in sixth year?”
What happens is actually close to his dreams. Williamson lands himself in St Mungo's, and Robards summons Draco in the middle of the night. Harry is right there when he arrives, standing by Robards' desk. He looks tense, and normally they wouldn't send him back into the field, but they're horribly understaffed these days, and Hermione is on maternity leave and…
Draco nodded slowly, even though he was sure Harry couldn't see it—not in the dark, especially not while not wearing his glasses. "So now you'd like to try something new?"
Draco watches him, watches the uniform row of houses across the glass, under the sun that burns his eyes.
"Potter." Draco hangs his scarf up on the rack before turning back around to face him. "Is that my alcohol you're drinking?"
Begrudgingly, she admitted, “Yes. Not in full detail, but I knew you were somehow together back then. It didn’t even seem weird to me when Harry asked me to
But then Potter pulls back, forcefully pushing Draco into the wall. His eyes are dark, an odd mix of anger and want turning them a cloudy shade of green, and Draco feels himself grow even harder as Potter wipes a hand across his face.
“Over there,” he says, eyes narrowed, and that’s that. It throws him off a bit. He could have sworn her words were
Of course it's Potter's baby, only Potter doesn't know that. Draco never told him that he'd slept with no one else these past few months, he never wanted Potter to know just how much this little affair of his meant to Draco. He never wanted him to know it meant
He tries to Apparate away, but there are hands on him and pain keeps him still. It’s what Polyjuice does: hurts like hell, feels like a roll of fire burning up his spine and he hates it. “Let me go,” he says, voice cracking high and helpless. “Please, let me…”
If only Draco moved his foot a tiny bit to the right—just a tiny bit—their ankles would be touching. He wondered if Potter's skin would be as warm as Draco imagined it. Everything about Potter was so hot, so lively, so full of energy, it just felt as though his skin should be as well. But then, what did he know?
Honestly, with her hairstyle, a shoulder-length bob of bluish black, she’d look great in some of them. The horn-rimmed ones he saw this morning would make her look rather sexy, a bit like those Muggle teachers that came up when he searched Google for porn—he’s learned quite a bit since then, now he types ‘gay porn’, because it’s all great and fab when fannies are for others but, Merlin, they’re seriously not for him. He’s about to mention that, but then he remembers where exactly he saw them, and that Potter’s ugly face stood behind them. With a frown, he decides he’s much better quiet—Pans already thinks, silly of her, that he has a crush on Potter; far better not to give her more ammo, she’s done enough bad as it is.
tired of being the one who's only meant to be talked about in whispers, or better yet, not talked about at all.
"You walked away first!" Potter snaps, throwing his hands up. "You broke things off first and you won't even explain why you did that. You're such a self-absorbed twat, I don't even know how to—"
He's still got Pansy, and he'll always have Mother. He should write to her, though perhaps she doesn't need to know the whole story.
Instead, Draco wakes up alone. He only knows he's in St Mungo's because it reeks of healing potions and disinfectant—the smell so strong it's beginning to make his nose itch. He's only alone for a few minutes before Harry walks in, holding a mug. He looks tired. He's still wearing his uniform, and there are black smudges under his eyes. Dry blood splattered on his chest. Draco's blood.
Afterwards, he waits for his body to change shape. It hurts, but he’s sadly used to it. He can deal with it, and that’s that. Plus, if this doesn’t work, if Potter is somehow immune to escorts, principles with a capital P and all, he’d rather not have him knowing what Draco’s been doing these past few months. Spreading his legs for others to poke their tiny pricks in there. A cold shiver coils in his stomach—no, thanks, he’s had enough shame thrown at him so far.
“I should have. I promised him I would, if we won the war. I kept thinking about it, and I was planning to, but then…” She looked down at her hands, her face a dance of grievance. “I
"You know," she says a while later, "at the time I thought it was just your pride that got hurt. Like, no one had ever dumped you before Harry, or something."
Narcissa sighs, but her lips twitch into a mysterious smile. "And yet that's never stopped you before."
Sadly, the mediwizard picks that instant to push a tray shut, blocking Potter’s voice from his ears.
"Yes, you bloody well should," Draco snaps, and for a moment, he almost wants to laugh at the scene they must be making, fists clenched tight, eyes flashing with rage over something as meaningless as a Blood-Replenishing Potion. Only none of this is funny, nothing about Potter having the nerve to come into his lab doubting his work skills to his face is even remotely funny. "See, apparently, your boss believed it when she hired me. If you have any issues with her choices, I'd suggest discussing them with her."
Still, Draco doesn’t really think that’s the issue here. He rather thinks Harry’s got it all wrong, and the issue is something else, something having to do with the distracted looks he catches Potter giving him, a mixture of attraction and want hidden behind them, that he’s quite sure his wife is not getting. At least not from Potter.
“Not really.” Potter’s thick eyebrows draw together into a massive frown mid-forehead. “Well, perhaps. Maybe.”
Just like that, he feels his hand flying forwards, crashing against Potter's nose in a twisted repeat of the incident near the beginning of their sixth year, the same incident he's been reminiscing about for months whenever Potter got on his wrong side at work. He feels the bones crack against his fist. He sees Potter falling, slowly, a steady stream of blood turning his mouth red, red, red, and Draco doesn't know what to think about this, he has no idea what to do about it, how to fix this, because how is this not messed up?
He looks miserable, and a small part of Draco wants to feel glad, to gloat about being the one who's put that look there—
Draco waited. He waited until he could no longer take it, and then asked, "Well? You're not going to tell me what it is?"
"I'm merely self-serving," Draco says. "I'll do just about anything as long as it keeps you coming back to me."
Harry yawned. He pretty much knew the whole thing by heart now, mainly because he’d been living this day forever and, with Ron gone, there was no one else she could talk to, was there? So he yawned and nodded and ordered, “Two, sorry, one Mocha and a Caramel Macchiato.”
Draco, who was about to have a second sip, pauses abruptly, barely avoiding spitting all over his hand.
I’m sane, Harry thought when Ron joined the bunch of ghosts. “What, you forgot?” Hermione said. “Jesus, Harry, what is
Weasel seems to be quite pissed at Potter. Draco has to admit he found it rather entertaining at first, he’d expected himself to be the main aim of Weasel’s comments. Instead, most of Weasel’s jibes tend to be directed at his own best friend, and that’s all right at first: Weasel’s world is one where Draco is not. It would have bothered him any other time, he’s never been a great fan of ignorance towards himself. Now, however, it suits him just fine. It’s not like he’s particularly willing to waste a minute, even a mere second, in chatting up to a carnivorous mammal with brownish fur and tiny legs, especially not when that mammal is Potter’s friend, the one who once laughed at him and then kept calling him ‘Ferret’ all through Hogwarts.
See, normally Draco would have doubted it, but he really does trust Potter. A lot. “All right.” In fact, probably too much. Probably more than he should.
"I told you this would end badly. It'll end with you heartbroken, and, as usual, it'll be up to me to pick up the pieces and put them back together."
Before she left, however, she gave him the password to Harry’s home. Draco did consider dropping by, going to see him. He did want to. He missed him so much…
A couple of weeks later, Draco stops halfway through unwrapping his scarf to give the scene before him a moment of puzzled deliberation: Potter, sprawled over his couch like he owns the place—
“So just try to act like you are?” Draco completes for her, since he’s feeling quite witty. Subtext: ‘Relax, lass. I can do that’.
"I did want to stay here with you," Potter tells him, brushing a strand of Draco's hair back with his thumb. He sounds surprised. His lips are so close Draco can feel puffs of breath brushing his skin as Potter speaks. "You're gorgeous. You know that, don't you? You're even gorgeous when you're sick."
"And when exactly would that be?" Pansy snaps, crossing her arms over her chest, but then she catches the look on Draco's face and her whole countenance softens. "You know, you should probably go to St Mungo's. You're always tired these days, you're always moody, and I'm beginning to think you must have caught something from Potter."
, but out of reach. The fact that he’s thinking this now is even odder, because not something, but some
say he was caring.” Potter rubs his neck in a slightly self-conscious gesture. “I should have thought… they sent all Death Eaters to—”
Draco suddenly feels like a blushing boy again. It’s quite ridiculous if one considers what he’s been up to these past few months, but none of his dates ever cared enough to make him
Potter stays out of his way through the rest of the day, but drops by his lab again once his work day is over. He sits on one of the long tables near the door, watching quietly as Draco checks his potions and pours his Antidote to Uncommon Poisons into tiny vials.
“They call that the opening scene, you see, it’s the beginning of your tale, that then moves on to the...” Hermione’s hands were moving all over the place, and Harry took a step back, because, honestly, he was so done with the Macchiato falling all over his hand.
"What's really going on, Draco? Don't think I've forgotten the great mess you managed to make of your life the last time you—"
Draco never talks about their kiss in the lab. He never talks about the scent of disinfectant potions Potter carries in his clothes, or about how Draco's head swam with lust as he felt Potter's lips move against his.
Some of it must be still running to have even reached this point, where there’s no backwards and no off, only forwards,
plays on his laptop, and he’s all unwinded and loosed up, not in a hurry at all. There’s no rush, nothing to do today except maybe chill, and perhaps Floo Pansy. He does feel a bit lonely some days, and most weekends Harry doesn’t show. Unless he’s working, but Draco knows he’s not today. Which, he guesses, means the whole day for himself.
, though he has to admit all of that does cross his mind once or twice. “I was just thinking that this here is pretty close to that.”
Harry would lace his fingers through Draco's and lift his hand to his lips. "Don't ever do that again," he'd mumble into the back of Draco's hand. "Don't ever leave me."
"Right." Draco twirled his tie around his finger. "Still, you must have been to this cinema place in the past, right? I mean, didn't you grow up around Muggles?"
Potter grabs his face and kisses him. For a moment there, Draco is so afraid Potter will think twice and decide this is a terrible idea, that he'll push Draco away like he did before. But Potter just keeps kissing him, making soft noises into his mouth.
He ends up spending most of his weekend at Pansy's. When he finally goes back home late on Sunday evening, Potter is, unsurprisingly, no longer there. He's gone, vanished from Draco's life without so much as a note, and Draco's stomach plummets whenever he thinks about it.
“My point is you didn’t get one,” Pansy says, “and you can’t live like this forever. You’re taking too much Polyjuice, it’s dangerous! You could…”
Draco turns around, burying himself deeper into his blankets. It's warm there. Cosy. "I'd really rather stay in bed, if it's all the same to you," he mumbles, but Pansy shakes her head and gives him a long, even look.
Instead of friends, Draco ended up with two sidekicks that were more like chavish minions than they were confidants—one of them actually got the nerve to betray him, the… supreme
"You get all the dates you want," Harry says tiredly. "Just please try not to jump in front of more lethal curses anytime soon, yeah?"
while he arched up, wrapping his legs tightly around Harry's firm hips, Draco realised he would have gladly traded half his gold for this—the feeling of Harry's hips rocking up into him as his arse clenched around Harry's cock. But this . . . it wasn't all he wanted from Harry.
"I looked everywhere for you," Potter starts. "I even asked Parkinson, but she wouldn't tell me where you were."
He hopes Miller isn’t waiting for a show here, because giving him one is not even remotely among his plans.
here but not this, do not tell him the—“might be”—truth, for Salazar’s sake. Just shut the hell up—“true.”
He can’t risk that. He can’t put his child through that, he just can’t. But he has, and why? All out of love not given back and being way dafter than a cow. And now it’s just waiting until Potter says something. Pack your bags, grab your things, or perhaps this is all mine, you can go elsewhere.
. It makes Draco’s eyes stand out. He wants to look good for him, he wants Potter to be impressed, as in truly impressed, fascinated-level impressed. Honestly, he’s been longing for that for quite a while, he’s just missing the
They were both sipping their tea, quietly, when Hermione said, “I’m sure you remember that Fred Weasley died during the battle, back on 1998.”
Draco wonders how that didn't clue him in to what was about to happen. It wasn't even the first time Potter tore Draco's world to pieces and left him without a leg to stand on—oh no, not even close. Potter seemed to have made a fine art of it, perfected it to the point where he could likely do it in his sleep. He was that good—but it was that evening when it hurt the most.
He knew Harry was as straight as they came—even if the way he behaved around Draco had made him doubt that now and again. He knew that, and he had no idea why he'd even said those words when he knew the answer would just hurt.
Draco swallows. His throat feels dry, and the tingle of excitement is making his face burn. "Let's hear it, then."
. "Weasley," Draco says desperately, and Harry freezes. Holds onto his mug as if it were a lifeline. "Ginevra."
Harry's eyes are dry when he looks up, and Draco really wants to kiss him, but his back hurts too much to move.
Draco has only once felt somewhat close to this before—filled with lust and want and need, but also justified, as if everything in his life had been leading up to this one moment, to him squirming under Potter, giving in to him a second time, unable to think about anything but how much he wants this to go on.
Draco stares at his own face, reflected on Potter’s spectacles. He wants to cry. He wants to laugh. He doesn’t know what he wants.
“So you keep saying.” Her nose curls up in disgust. “Anyway, the waiters over there knew him,” she goes on. “They called him by his name and all. I really didn’t want Potter to see me, so I left. Plenty of cafés around that street, no need to stay in the one he’s in.”
Later, when they're both lying on Draco's bed, legs entwined, Potter's fingers tracing slow circles up the inside of Draco's thigh, he asks, "Doesn't your girlfriend ever wonder where you go at night?" Because he needs to know. Because the question has been eating at him for days.
Draco searches for it on Google Maps. He’s become quite a tech-savvy, considering, and no, it’s not the magazine he’s reading. He just (some days) has tons of free time (can’t sleep at all), and this World Wide Web thing Muggles have is really rather interesting. On his screen, it shows a pub in a Muggle part of London. No wonder Draco hasn’t found him yet. He’s been looking in all the wrong places. Turns out Potter wasn’t anywhere around Diagon Alley, after all.
Draco swallows. His mind feels muzzy and slow but he says, "No, sir, of course not," just like he's supposed to—like a professional; like the bloody consummate liar that he is, even though he's so far from all right it's almost frightening.
“I’m fine, Pans.” Draco looks down into his tea mug. There’s an uneasy swirl in his stomach, pretty much what he keeps feeling these days whenever he thinks about swallowing that bland green foulness. “There’s still one of you and not twenty. See? I’m perfectly fine.”
“I wasn’t expecting you,” he begins to say, but something about Potter’s posture looks… wrong. He’s too tense, too strained. “What happened?”
And Potter wants forgiveness now? Well, Draco isn’t feeling extremely forgiving these days. Potter can wait. (Wait forever with his pants on fire, for all he is is a liar and a cheat. A despicable cheat. Cheating on him with Weasel’s sis and then cheating on her with him.) Draco has to admit he won’t be too sorry if he waits until the end of times. It’s what he deserves.
Fear takes Draco's heart faster than a Seeker on a Snitch, making it turn to ice in his chest. He wishes above all things to be able to fabricate a credible excuse, one that'll allow him to vanish before Potter gets there—he wishes to be able to do that, and to be able to do it fast. However, his mind is silent, his body perfectly still, and Potter is like that prophesied catastrophe Draco can never seem to avoid.
Draco’s having none of it, clamping his hands around the newspaper in defiance and refusing to let go. What the hell is she on about now, the bint’s not playing with a full deck. “I should
Draco talks to Pansy, sometimes. Mostly through the Floo, though she has come over twice. He has to be careful though, doesn’t want Potter to see her here, or else. He’s stopped having those horrible flashbacks. He is finally off those potions, and his insomnia no longer forces him to call on sleep nightly with a glass of Firewhisky. Instead, he gets to sulk and laugh, and be extremely Ab Fab—like the Muggle show—by listening to Muggle classics from the ’80s.
. It just loops over itself repeating the same mistake again and again until you fix it within the code.”
"I think you should take a holiday," Pansy tells him as she walks in. She slings her cloak across Draco's worktable, knocking aside several volumes on numerology. Draco stares at them morosely, but doesn't move to pick them up.
Something fragile flutters in his chest, under Potter’s gentle prods, something he’s quite sure is long-term fatal. Draco has never been a risk taker, so he shoves it down and pretends its not there.
Draco’s lips nervously curl upwards into a smile, a smile that’s more of a grimace than a grin. “Excuse me?”
"This is my home too," Draco yells back. "Besides, need I remind you this is at least partly your fault?"
She follows him to the kitchen when he helps Kreacher clear the table—which admittedly Draco only does whenever Harry is around. If he’s off at work, Kreacher can do it by himself, thanks.
Pansy raises an eyebrow. "All right," she murmurs, reaching for the bottle of Odgen's Old. "Is this about him being the new Dark Lord? Because I already told you what I thought about that."
Draco laughs a bit hysterically as Harry delves into his mouth, dragging his tongue along Draco's teeth as if trying to taste every available inch of him. Draco's knees feel weak, and his nails are digging into Harry's shoulders, and Harry is moaning into his mouth. They're still in the middle of the bloody Ministry where anyone could walk in on them, and it's all so impossibly
It's ridiculous, and quite possibly driving Draco spare, and it seriously doesn't help the lack of control he feels over his life. Or the sense that his heart is going to stop functioning whenever Potter so much as addresses him—and Draco hates that, he hates it with a burning passion, but sadly, that never seems enough to stop Potter.
He turns around, knowing, just knowing, because that voice is still etched into his memory as if he’d heard it yesterday, even though it’s been six flipping months since the last time he did. If he’s quite honest here, he’s not looking forwards to hearing it ever again. He’s quite aware why he kept Flooing: just another way to show he could, holding his power over Draco’s head.
The hand on his back lifts, leaves a bit of sweat that cools quickly, and Miller finally pulls out. Draco backs away, edging towards the bed, snatching off his shirt and backing away again. Backing away until he’s trapped by the coffee table, and the hateful eyes that won’t leave his figure no matter what.
Draco's heart crashes like the glacial shard it is. This is why he didn't want to come. This is why he'd told Pansy he'd do best to stay at home.
“That would be great,” Draco says, his lips molding into a tiny smile. And that’s how it all starts. A thoughtful twist on the wheel of fortune, plenty of evasion, and a few fabrications on what’s true and what’s not, partly thanks to Potter, and to hope well-placed this time.
“Suit yourself.” She taps the ash off her cigarette into the small ashtray standing between them. Shoots him a grim grin while explaining, “It’s just, it’s never going to get better, you know? You’re still bonded to him…”
“I…” Merlin, if he gets it wrong once more, he’ll want to bang his head against the wall, painfully. Yet no one here will be particularly entertained by another display of lack of graciousness. Not him. Certainly not Potter. And besides, the wall is far too close. How did he end up there, anyway? Slouching against the loo’s wall, bathed in sweat…
“Evening,” he greets. Admittedly, he’s only acknowledging Potter’s presence out of respect for Mother. “Not greeting people is rude,” she kept telling him, even though Potter here, the Hero of Heroes—or, if you ask Draco, the supreme wanker out of all heartbreakers—barely deserves that much.
When Draco comments on the obvious growth of his vocabulary, Harry simply tells him he's learnt from the best. And that's the exact moment Draco comes to a decision. Only he doesn't get to tell Harry straight away because he really needs to use the loo—one of the perks of being an even bigger whale now, he guesses.
"They'll fix this though, won't they?" He lay back, staring up at the white ceiling. "Of course they'll fix this. They have to, they have to find a way to—they can't possibly leave us like this."
"And yet you let yourself in." Draco steps closer—closer still until he's standing between Potter's legs, feeling Potter's warmth through the fabric of his jeans as it radiates across his skin. "Why is that?" he asks, watching goosebumps rise along Potter's arms.
Anyway, a couple of minutes later, a new waiter — a girl, this time — came back with his Macchiato and apologised profusely and that was that.
He does have a plan. He figures that is what happens when he can’t put his brain on pause, not even at night, when pain is Death Eaters and the dark is way too dark to be good. It’s a great plan too, at least he thinks so. He
He pushes the blanket off with tired arms, without really knowing why: for some calm, for more air, for some reason that quite eludes him. It’s not like any of that matters, since at least the tears are in, not out, since at least Potter knows nothing, and it really should stay that way. Though he’ll find out eventually. Best case scenario, Potter will freak out, and then Draco can say farewell to this life, farewell to the giant pillock he’s fallen for. He can’t remember when nor how but, news flash, love lives in him, and it doesn’t look like it will be leaving anytime soon.
“Really?” Draco raises an eyebrow. “Am I supposed to be part of your work, then? Because last time I checked, this was not St. Mungo’s.”
“I see your standards have quite risen since the last time I saw you,” Blaise says, looking around at his partners. Draco doesn’t know what Zabini wants, why he’s even talking to him. Unless…
“I know you’re not, you pillock,” says Harry, massive eye-roll included, all while Draco dodges the popcorn thrown at him. “I wouldn’t be dating you if you were anything like you were back at school.”
Draco dreamt that night that he'd wake up in Harry's bed, stirred awake by the soft spicy scent of Harry's deodorant. He dreamt he'd blink his eyes open slowly, sleepily, and Harry would be there to run gentle fingers through his hair—to kiss him—and Draco's heart would for once beat at the right pace.
"I came over with Pansy." And then she grabbed her camera and disappeared into the crowd. Draco is still wondering where the hell she went; surely she must have taken a million different photographs by now.
Not any of them, please. He tries his hardest to crawl out of it, to come back to what’s real and what’s
And then Draco’s jaw snaps shut as a fist crushes the side of his face. He falls to the floor, cradling his chin. Stunned, wounded. Drained.
He's so bloody anxious all the time—whenever his shoulder brushes against someone else's in the corridors, whenever the door to his lab slides open. He's always terrified he'll turn around to find Potter staring back at him. Those unwavering green eyes are always on him, following his every movement like a Nundu tracking its prey.
. Both to those who won the war and to those who didn’t, as neither of them seem too happy with the path Draco walked.
how it feels, all right?” He grabs the fag off Pansy’s hand. “Merlin,” he coughs out, smoke riveting out of his mouth after the small drag he took. “Tastes disgusting. Don’t even know how you can smoke this crap.”
Draco beams a nervous smile. “Well, I’m here now not there, so…” So why not make use of this time? He wants to remember this. He doesn’t want it taken from him by yet another Obliviation.
Draco smiled into his pillow, a flicker of hope burning bright in his chest. For the first time since this whole thing had started, Draco couldn't honestly say he minded being bonded to Harry. They were better together than they ever were apart.
, he thinks, or else the bonding bit would be history never happened. It would have been a bad dream, another nightmare, like those he often runs from.
"Potter." Draco's voice sounds soft, far away. It sounds as if he's speaking through a mouthful of cotton. He feels oddly at peace. "Is she your girlfriend?"
"Because I didn't know, okay? Male pregnancies are so bloody rare, how was I supposed to know—but of course you're you."
“Nothing. He means nothing at all. Evening, Blaise,” Draco greets, and thank Merlin, Morgana and Salazar that at least he’s good at faking smiles, “we were just leaving.” Mostly because he has this awful feeling inside him, that Blaise is going to do something here that he might not like. It just keeps being there, not going away, and it’s driving him mad. “Come on, Harry.”
, because Potter might think it’s not ethical and whatnot, but Potter here is rolling in millions, and millions of millions, and he could certainly spare a few. Draco was merely hoping for some extra cash, mostly to pay back Pans for all the months she’s let him stay at hers. It’s not like he is going to ask
These days, Draco is not exactly looking to get laid—too little time, too much to do. Then again, it’s been a long time since ‘getting laid’ held any kind of promise for him. He’s already bonded to someone who quite mattered to him. None of them, sadly, will ever be able to replace the exact amount of love Draco had for Harry. Even the stars are too close to reach it.
“Absolutely.” Draco grins, as he bends his head slightly to kiss Harry, sucking at the tongue that invades him. It feels like a promise, a promise of lust and clumsy tumbles under sheets when sun goes down. “Granger said there’s a gala next week. She said you’re going—”
"Do you know what the worst thing is about all this?" Potter goes on. Now that the ice is gone from his eyes, he looks so much like the Potter Draco remembers from their eighth year, it's almost uncanny. Disconcerting. "I don't even know what I did to make you run away like—"
. That’s what the Dark Lord’s laugh sounds like. Like squashing your marrow till you bend and bow and say yes yes yes because, “You are mine.” The mark on his skin burns, itches. He yearns to scratch it.
Harry’s arm curls around Draco’s waist. “No, it’s not fine. It’s not fine at all. I care about you. You know that, don’t you?”
But Pansy is also Draco's friend. One of the few people who has never betrayed him, not even when her own life was at stake.
(A child Naomi seems to have a rather large sweet spot for. She keeps offering to stroll him around the park at noon, when she takes her midday break.)
His whole world moves fast and faster, on a spin forward with no stop. He hears the Dark Lord’s voice in the distance, kill Dumbledore or else… or else Mother, but
“What?” Harry asks, just as Draco says, “Nothing. He’s kidding, that’s all. He’s just kidding. Aren’t you, Blaise?”
. Draco turns around and leaves, cradling Scorpius against his chest. Potter is lying, he knows that much. That, and he doesn’t want the hurt back.
Draco's work as if he knew anything about potions. Draco is not entirely sure how to feel about that—amused, occasionally, but mostly just annoyed out of his mind. Over the past few weeks, he'd grown quite fond of the bittersweet oblivion that was being no one in Potter's book; at least it let Draco do his job. Potter's commentary, on the other hand . . .
Silence stretches long in time, scratching onto forever before Draco decides to break it. “Give me my child, Potter.”
"Are you sure that's wise? What if he sacks you?" Draco asks, but Harry rolls his eyes and says, "While I appreciate your concern, I'm not nearly as destitute as you seem to think."
“Oh, I’m certainly not kidding. You see, your boyfriend used to be a whore. For pay, too, and rather cheap. He stayed with me quite a few nights, didn’t you, Draco, dear?”
Honestly, he’d much rather they wouldn’t, mostly because he is no longer sure what he ‘wants’ them to do at all. Certainly not fucking. This bloke is huge, and keeps looking at him weirdly for some odd reason, and it’s kind of making him worry. Is his suit filthy or something? It shouldn’t be, he cast a Scouring Charm on it before he left his last date.
. He tries to say, ‘Hey, gorgeous’. Tries to say, ‘Can I just say, I love your eyes’, tries to say any of all those silly sentences he’s been practicing at home, because he
, you idiot. You're not supposed to stop before you've even—" He breaks off, moaning as Potter's finger slides in, flexing until it's pressing against Draco's prostate. "Merlin . . . Merlin," Draco says, his voice tight as he arches his back.
