“I saw it. I have this… link with Voldemort. I can see what he sees sometimes,” he explained and he stretched and smiled. “I can tell you this only because this is a dream. Dreams can’t talk,” he said firmly and Draco raised an eyebrow.
Whether it was the wine or the bolstered mood from the evening's events, Dean and Weasley managed to slip off to sleep easily enough while Draco still lay awake. He turned on his side, looking to where Harry lay and found that Harry was watching him too.
you,” Draco said back, wiping a hand under his eyes furiously. “He gave me hope,” and he hiccupped a sob, tears building and streaming down his cheeks now. “He saw that I was capable of the change he once underwent. He gave me hope and it was dashed a second later and I will never,
, actually. To a group of students. Back in fifth year?” he said, as though hinting and Draco was hit by the memory of Dolores Umbridge.
“How does he know that?” he asked and Hermione gave him a dark look.
“I’m still here. We’d better get moving. I’ll follow in your tracks,” he said and she nodded. He stood behind Potter and made sure to walk in Potter’s footsteps to disguise his own prints. Potter and Granger walked arm in arm down the snowy lane, Granger hyper focused on their surroundings, but Potter looking every which way. He couldn’t stop looking around, his mouth slightly agape as he took in the cottages and their lights. Draco wondered if he knew which one had been the one he’d lived in for that brief time with his parents.
“They can’t produce them. Though my mother always said that hers would be a snake and my father’s would be a peacock,” he said with disgust and he could tell Potter was trying very hard not to laugh as he schooled his face into neutral pleasantness. Potter nodded.
“I can’t see anything either,” he said and Granger shook her head, her nose wrinkling as she squinted even more.
It was Blaise. His face caught the firelight, shining golden, and his expression was a picture of disgust and horror.
They had accepted, and had been working at Hogwarts for the past 17 years, side-by-side. On one quiet summer holiday afternoon, nearly 6 years into their tenure at Hogwarts, Harry had taken Draco to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, and there, in front of Turner’s
He was just finishing off a report for the Minister that afternoon, when the floo in his office flared and his secretary Belinda's face appeared in the flames.
“Please,” Draco begged, on his knees on the recreated floor of Bellever Forest, dreamed pine needles digging into his shins. Potter looked at the forest around him, but was not moved. “Tell me where you are. Let me help you! I want to help!”
The barman was silent, as though processing the news, before he sighed. “I’m sorry to hear it. I liked that elf,” he said finally, before turning away to light some of the lamps around his room.
“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice through the new darkness of the evening. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you, and we don’t care who we curse!” and Draco felt a shock of fear go up his spine – Fenrir Greyback.
!” he shouted and Greyback staggered backwards but didn’t fall.
“I could ask you the same question,” he said icily and Potter gave him a warning look. Draco decided to charge ahead regardless. “Didn’t you walk away months ago? Why are you back now?” and Weasley gaped at him.
“Tea, Ms Granger?” the house-elf asked and Hermione gave her a smile and nodded.
“No idea,” he said coolly. “Maybe he was born that way? Merlin knows I’d hide in the woods if I was that ugly,” he said and a few of the Snatchers chuckled. “We need to go to Malfoy Manor, Greyback. I’m sure my father will reward you handsomely for taking me home to him, safely,” he added and Greyback’s eyes caught the light and flashed yellow. He turned and kicked Potter in the side, turning him onto his back with a gasp. Draco looked away.
“Give me Harry Potter,” the Dark Lord intoned from everywhere and Draco’s head whipped around, spotting Harry further down the table, his face tilted upwards to the ceiling which still calmly reflected the night sky, at odds with the words around them. “And none shall be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have until midnight.”
“No, no,
The song ended and they slowed, coming to a stop in the middle of the tent. Granger clapped and Potter stepped away, his gaze looking anywhere but at Draco.
“Indeed? How do you both do?” Travers asked, offering his hand first to Weasley and then Draco.
“What’s going on?” he asked, looking over Potter with concern but not panic. Draco felt instantly better for having him here.
“I was just sorting this, but it’s done now. Were Ron and Hermione on the platform?” Harry asked, stepping back from the luggage rack and pausing to kiss his husband.
When he wasn’t being pulled into mysterious conversations with the trio, Draco helped Fleur prepare food. It was obvious that she wasn’t used to cooking for this many people, and Draco had very few kitchen skills to speak of, but they muddled through it together, chattering away in French. Fleur noted that Draco’s accent was very Marseille and he explained that his paternal grandmother had been from the region, as one of the pure-blood Bonnet family.
"What do you mean?" he asked after a moment, and Dumbledore tapped his fingers together and frowned slightly.
“So those artifacts would be the wand, the stone and the cloak?” Draco said, his eyes going wide, remembering the story. He caught Hermione’s eye and she gave him a grim smile.
“Dumbledore’s mother,” Draco breathed quietly into the silence and Granger nodded.
“I dream… I have visions,” Potter corrected himself and Draco raised his eyebrows. “We have a link. I can see what he sees, though I don’t think he can see what I can. In moments of high emotion, it… overpowers me. It overtakes my mind and it’s all I can see. And last night, when we were so close.” Potter let out a breath, sounding suddenly very tired. “That combined with the Horcrux–”
“Draco, m’boy, well done on being named Head Boy!” he said jovially, reaching out a hand, which Draco shook reluctantly. “As Head Boy, you have the power to change the password on the common room entry, but I’ve taken the liberty of setting it for the start of term,” Slughorn explained with a grin, his eyes creasing in the corners. “
“I don’t make the decisions,” the gargoyle wheezed. Draco stepped through the opening it had created and waited as the moving staircase lifted him to the door in front of the Headmaster’s office. He lifted a hand to knock but then paused, hearing someone talking on the other side.
“You’re wrong,” Draco said and his mother stiffened, her hands tightening their grip on his robes. He pulled away from her embrace. “She’s not
Draco hesitated. Only for a split second, but enough. The Dark Lord’s eyes narrowed and he turned his attention to Draco, “Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!”
“Disgusting!” Ron shouted and Neville nodded weakly, before they abandoned the body to join another fight.
Every snap of a branch outside sounded like footprints, every bird chatter sounded like someone talking. He dragged over one of the armchairs to sit by the tent entrance and curled up there, dragging a blanket over himself as he read. The morning was chilly and his breath rose in a fog in front of his face as he tried to read and not panic as the minutes went by.
“Interesting,” Greyback said contemplatively. “That’s interesting…” He walked past them again and his voice was behind Draco’s now, where Potter was.
He had settled in for the night when the pain began again, burning at his forearm. He first tried to ignore it, hoping it would go away (though it never had any other night over the last few weeks), but eventually it grew into a searing pain. Screwing his eyes shut though tears streaked down his face, he balled the edge of the sleeping bag into his mouth and tried to muffle the screaming as much as he could. Another fresh wave hit him just as he heard footsteps pounding towards him and someone wrestling with the zip of his tent.
“Draco,” he heard someone call his name and he turned to see Blaise sat against the stone wall behind him. He looked bruised and a bit bloodied, but in one piece.
Harry gave a strangled yell that might have been relief, and might have been fury, but Draco was just relieved. They had their arms full of dirty, curved, yellow objects and Ron had a broomstick under one arm, but they both didn’t look any worse for wear.
“Oo does ‘e look like?” Fleur asked, leaning against her husband. Draco tuned the conversation around him out, staring down at the goblet of wine in his hand. Much like he had felt in the forest at the news of the death of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell, he again felt like the world had been crystallised around Shell Cottage, unchanged. But with death came birth and the cycle began anew. He looked over at Potter, who was still smiling.
“Congratulations, Professor,” He said and Lupin beamed down at him. Fleur had sidled round and was offering Lupin a chair, and he tried to wave her off.
“I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” he told her, a sharp edge to his voice that made Draco want to snap at him, but he turned and walked away before he could say anything, leaving them crouched in the snow.
“The name is ironic,” Potter said with a smile. “Witch Wood. Hermione says it’s not actually named for witches, it’s a tribe name that got turned over so many times that it became Witch, but I think it’s funny.” He offered a hand to Draco and pulled him to his feet. His hand felt warm and real in Draco’s own. “It’s dangerous. I don’t want you to find us. I want you to go home, and be safe. So many people aren’t safe because of me,” Potter said quietly, letting go of Draco’s hand and stepping away.
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” he said just as Malfoy joined them. He frowned at Hermione.
“I’ll be fine for a little while longer,” he said and she gave him an assessing look but didn’t argue. Harry turned back to Ron. “And the talk wasn’t anything we didn’t already know. Two papers on two subjects and then if we get short-listed, we have a
From outside, his office door was thrown open and Mulligan poked her head in, nodding at Harry.
Potter was lying on the floor of a dingy living room when Draco opened his eyes. He didn’t actually open his eyes though – it felt like he had just blinked into existence in that room as soon as he had fallen asleep in his own bed, exhausted, tear and blood stained.
’s no good! RUN!” he shouted, dragging Harry after him as the flames began to climb higher and higher, illuminating the shadows in the room's high ceiling. Crabbe quickly caught up with them, and so had the consequences of his actions – flames consumed the junk on either side of them, crumbling piles of centuries old debris into ash at the merest touch. It changed form, turning into a knot of serpents, a Chimaera, a dragon, all of them devouring anything in their path. Draco rounded a corner and spotted their salvation.
"They'll be alright, won't they?" Harry asked in a low voice, raising his hand to wave. Draco gave a small snort, lifting his hand too.
"I'll go help them, shall I?" he asked, putting his toast down on a plate and slipping through the open kitchen door, taking the stairs two at a time up to the boys' floor. It was Scorpius who was trying to move his trunk, his dark blond hair in his face, his cheeks flushed pink from the exertion. He had managed to get the trunk quite far, and it was now balancing precariously on the edge of the top step. Draco caught it on the underside and steadied it from rocking too far over.
“I’m flattered Cameron, but no,” he said quietly, but firmly, and Cameron all but deflated in front of him.
He stopped just off one of the paths for a sandwich after an hour or two of wandering aimlessly and snatched up a map that had been left on the ground. He scanned the map and key, trying to find a hint of where he was, but then he saw, labelled in the lower part of the map, ‘
Dumbledore stepped forward and touched his shoulder lightly, and Draco looked at the Headmaster and saw that although he smiled, tears ran down his cheeks.
“No, me neither. But if Harry says he thinks she’s got the sword to give to him–” she said, pressing a hand to her chest, as if trying to calm her rapidly beating heart.
"Do you have any idea how terrified I was?" Harry asked and Malfoy nodded. Harry was quiet for a long moment, gathering his thoughts and memories from that terrible day. "My husband tried to kill the children we tried desperately for. In our home. I did everything I did to protect them, to keep them safe - from you. Because you tried to kill them," Harry continued and Malfoy sat down heavily on top of the desk. Harry continued, "Because you hated them enough to want to kill them,"
“Did Dobby let you out?” Draco hissed at Potter who nodded, touching his shoulder to lean in front of him and look inside the drawing room.
But now, a year to the day since the boys had been kidnapped, he smiled at Harry from behind his toast and glanced up at the ceiling, where a muffled banging signalled that one of the boys was attempting to move his trunk.
“We don’t have time, Hermione, you heard what Harry said,” and Harry gave him a look, his jaw set in determination. “I’ll go outside of the cloak,” he said finally and Ron gaped.
’. He stared at it and then it clicked.
“Well, I don’t really know anything about him,” she admitted. “He’s not in any books other than Nature’s Nobility,” she added and Draco wrinkled his nose.
“He’s been obsessed with you since last year. Of course he does,”
“Hello, Minister!” Percy Weasley shouted jovially, sending a jinx at Pius Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and pulled at his robes desperately. “Did I mention I’m resigning?”
“Forest of Dean,” Hermione said over her shoulder as Potter stood in the centre of the clearing, his hands limp at his sides. Without his wand, he couldn’t help raise the wards, and Draco turned away, shame gnawing at his insides. It felt like a betrayal to use his wand in front of Potter, who looked awkward and a little sad. Hermione continued talking, as though trying to fill the silence. “Mum and Dad brought me here years ago. We camped for the weekend,” her voice caught a little but she continued with the wards.
“Well, well,” Greyback said, his voice a little less confidently now, almost concerned. Could Harry’s lies get them out of this? “If you’ve telling the truth ugly, you’ve got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father will reward us just for picking you up,”
“That’s kind, thank you,” he replied, pushing away from the wall and joining them as they left the bustling atrium and escaped into the cool September air. Hermione led them both back to the
"They were taken by a dark wizard. Death Eater, we think. Someone who lost a son during the War. Look, here's the message they left," and Ron conjured the same image that Thompson had shown the bullpen, the scorched writing on the brick pillar. Malfoy studied it, frowning.
He had been living in ignorant bliss, he could see that now. All this time with Potter and Hermione, he had thought that the world had just crystallised around them, breaking and reforming as they moved through it, fundamentally unchanged. He could see now how very wrong he had been. Muggles, wizards and goblins alike, dead at the hands of Death Eaters, who had once counted Draco in their ranks.
Hermione ate a piece of less burned toast and they both gulped down some tea before heading for the door, Hermione pausing to shout “Love you!” up to Ron at the bottom of the stairs. Ron yelled it back and then after an awkward pause said “And you, Harry!” to which Harry laughed and replied in kind.
“He’s taken the others,” he whispered back, and Potter jerked his chin towards the door. “Has Griphook told her–”
But the door had been tested more times than Draco cared to think about, always in the dead of night when the rest of the house was asleep. Whether they intended him mischief or harm, Draco didn’t want to find out.
"Put her through, Belinda, thank you," Harry said and the floo flared and crackled before McGonagall's head appeared. Harry smiled at her. "Headmistress. How can I help you? It's a bit early in the school year for the boys to be getting into trouble, isn't it? They've not even arrived at Hogwarts," he said, jokingly, but the humour died in his throat when he took in McGonagall's pale face.
“Why are you here, Malfoy?” she asked and Draco cleared his throat, masking a sniff as the cold air stinging his nose.
“Why, Madam Lestrange!” a voice called from behind them. They all turned and Draco’s heart lurched – he knew the man approaching them. He darted forward to whisper in Hermione’s ear.
?’ Potter asked, sounding incredulous. Weasley nodded, and Draco watched them both with curiosity. Could it be – had the Dark Lord taboo’d his name?
’. He brushed some snow off a wreath that had been laid at the grave of ‘
“Yeah, I was. Well, I broke up with him prior to coming over to the examinations. He tried to reconnect when I was back in Australia, but I put a stop to that,” he said and Draco nodded, a hint of colour rising in his cheeks. He leaned a bit closer, as if to ask something else, but one of the doors off the atrium opened and a Magical Fellow in a purple-piped gown stepped forward.
The first time Draco had been called up in Defense Against the Dark Arts (which many students were now just called ‘Dark Arts’ because there seemed to be no defense in the lessons at all), he stood at the front of the room while Amycus Carrow prowled up and down the student desks, all of them watching him with nervous looks.
They turned to Draco, who opened his arms, and the boys rushed in, falling into his embrace. He pulled them in close and took a moment to just breathe them in. His boys, his babies, the sons he had carried and nearly lost, not once but twice. He loved them so much it ached sometimes, and yet he couldn't imagine life without them. Taking a second to blink back the sudden sting of tears, he stepped away from them, his hands sliding to cup the back of their necks, giving them both a wobbly smile. Scorpius looked tearful while Albus' chin was wobbling, his lips pressed firmly together.
“Yes, please Mipsy. We’ve left the laundry in the basket by the staircase and the ironing is hanging from the wardrobe door, if you get round to it?” she said and Mipsy nodded, putting their mugs at their elbows and then leaving the room.
“Thanks for telling me, I was thinking of my Grandfather’s funeral just now,” he told him drily and Potter rolled his eyes.
! Draco felt a thrill at the realisation, which was quickly tempered by the Dark Lord speaking once more. “You have failed the Dark Lord, Rowle, and he does not forgive easily,” Voldemort continued, snapping Draco’s focus back to him, and Draco shivered. It was true. “What do you have to say for yourself, Rowle?” the Dark Lord said and Draco stopped the spell, dropping his wand to his side. Rowle gasped and coughed and wretched and still tried to mumble out apologies, words that did not make sense when strung together, but Draco could tell he was desperate. Draco’s hand shook as the Dark Lord hissed behind him.
They had parted so abruptly that Harry thought maybe he didn't really have enough of a chance to hate Malfoy long enough to stop loving him. He was there one minute and then he was gone, exiled to France with his books and potions and clothes and belongings all disappearing from Grimmauld Place overnight, leaving Harry with nothing but memories and two little boys who cried for their lost father.
“This way!” Harry shouted, and Draco seized Hermione’s arm and pulled her through the reforming crowd of goblins in Harry’s wake. Harry, in the lead, shot Stunning Spells left and right as Weasley brought up the rear.
“She did. She wasn’t pleased I was telling everyone the truth,” Potter said and he looked fierce for a second, his green eyes bright with the winter light. “I took that to heart. I must not tell lies. I never did,” he added and Draco nodded.
“He knows I’m after the Horcruxes – he’s keeping Nagini close beside him – obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near the thing–”
’, and settled himself into an armchair with it.
“Find the door!” Harry bellowed over the roar of the flames, and Draco pressed closer, trying to breathe. The flames had turned the air hot, almost too hot to breathe, and he coughed when he tried to take a deep breath. Harry wheeled around in the air, turning them in the direction he thought the door might be. “Hold on, Draco,” he murmured, and Draco tightened his grip.
"Where are they, Bel?" he asked her, sounding broken even to his own ears, and she clucked her tongue at him and patted his hand.
"You tried to drown them," Harry snarled, and the room went very still, as if cast under Petrificus Totalus. Malfoy's face was ashen.
The drawing room door was slightly ajar, and Draco pressed an eye to the crack to see in. Hermione was on the floor, quiet and still, and Bellatrix was looming over the goblin that they had been tied together with, and he had the Sword of Gryffindor balanced in his hands.
“Who is it?” Bill called towards the front door, edging out from his seat, his wand raised and pointed.
“You cannot change this,” Dumbledore told him and Draco blinked rapidly. The dream, the memory, swam around him and he choked back a sob.
“Well, my door is always open. Off you pop, Malfoy, don’t be late to dinner,” Slughorn said, waving a hand lazily to dismiss him. Draco turned on his heel, picked his satchel as he walked past and then was out of the Potions dungeon with a sweep of his robes.
!’ He echoed the spell, hearing twin shouts from Weasley and Harry, and the crowd of goblins staggered, some falling over, but they kept advancing. Draco adjusted his balance on the still moving mudslide of hot metal, and sent off another volley of hexes, Weasley and Hermione following suit. Behind the group, the tethered and half-blind dragon, a pitiful thing that they had passed on the way in, roared, and a jet of fire flew over the heads of the goblins.
“Malfoy?” he asked and Draco jumped a little. He had thought Potter was another vision, but Potter wasn’t disturbed by his appearance. In fact, he appeared like he had been expecting it. Potter blinked and rose to his feet. The room around them was fuzzy and vague but Draco could make out two other shapes, one sleeping on a sofa, the other on the floor next to Potter.
On the ground floor, he set them down by the front door and went back into the kitchen, where Albus had his arms flung around Harry, making excited noises about the Invisibility Cloak that was clutched in his right hand. Scorpius was smiling indulgently, but he grinned when he noticed Draco had entered the room.
“I should head off. I’m due back in France this week,” he said with a smile and Hermione nodded, reaching out a hand. Malfoy hesitated but then took it, and they shook.
, changes, to our teaching staff this year. As you may have noticed, Professor Burbage is no longer with us.” Draco flinched at the double entendre, the memory of the professor dying over his dining room table coming to the forefront. “She has opted to take a sabbatical this year, and her position will be filled by Professor Carrow.” He gestured to Alecto, who stood, though it barely made a difference as she was so squat. There was no welcoming applause, and a few whispered conversations struck up at the other house tables.
“Surely there have been whispers,” Blaise encouraged and Draco sniffed, shifting a little in the armchair, uncomfortable. There had been rumours all summer, but he had managed to keep Potter’s secrets so far.
“Wait, wait, let me check–” Harry said as they headed up the marble staircase, and he reached into the pouch around his neck and pulled out a tattered bit of parchment. He dragged them off the staircase into a quiet hallway and settled himself on a plinth of a statue that had obviously been called up for service. Draco lingered, bouncing on the balls of his feet, buzzing with nervous energy. Harry whispered something to the piece of parchment and writing bloomed over it. Draco frowned, recognising the map he had seen all those months ago.
“Who says I’ve given up?” Aberforth replied and Harry crossed his arms over his chest, obviously annoyed.
’,” Crabbe said in what Draco was sure was his best threatening tone. Draco stiffened for a second at the edge of his bed but then shrugged it off and clambered back in, pulling the duvet back down over his lap.
“I’m sorry, but to hear you talk about your research…” he said, leaning forward to pick the book up from where it had fallen on the floor. “When did you put all these notes in?” he asked, turning the pages carefully, each one neatly annotated.
“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Weasley shouted from the back and Harry turned his head to reply. His nose was smudged with dirt and there was a high flush on his cheeks, like he had spent too long in the sun.
“Lupin was the best Defence teacher we ever had,” Blaise said gruffly. “I saw him go down. Dolohov got him. Wasn’t
“Dumbledore is dead!” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry like they would cause him pain. Harry did not flinch, though Draco had to look away. Yes, Dumbledore was dead – and it was his fault. “His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, Potter, and he will not return!”
“An interesting choice,” she commented and Malfoy made a small noise of agreement, but didn't elaborate any further. Hermione paused for a moment, lingering a bit too long while waiting for Malfoy to fill up the silence, before she spoke again. “Well, I read Jurisprudence at Magdalen College, just down the road,” she said, making a vague gesture with her free hand to outside somewhere. “And Harry, well he-,”
Her face fell and she murmured something to Ron who looked stricken. Ron beckoned him over and he went to join them, feeling weighed down with the horror of the night.
“What is it?” he asked. Draco squinted into the darkness. All around them the edges of the graveyard were dense black, and Draco couldn’t see anything.
"They're missing. You have to help us. Please," he said, his voice trembling, and the Patronus stamped one hoof against the floor nervously before galloping away, disappearing through the wall.
“Do you have a date yet?” he asked and Hermione shook her head.
“They must’ve been here for weeks,” she hissed and Draco nodded. “The room must have expanded as more and more students needed it. Look-” she pointed at a hammock that hung under a Hufflepuff banner. “That one looks brand-new,” she said and based on the plump white pillow and pristine sheets, Draco agreed with her.
“And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?” Weasley asked with bite and Hermione, in her desperation, raised her wand.
“Wait,” Mother said, stepping closer. “Yes – yes, she was in Madam Malkin’s with Potter! I saw her picture in the
With a triumphant hiss, Harry swung forward once more and caught the cup. He looked down just as there was a scream of agony – Griphook had been swallowed by the rising tide of white-hot objects. Draco let out a yell as some plates pressed against his knees and thighs, and the spell holding Harry abruptly broke, sending him crashing into the wave of objects, which sprung up around him. He yelled and sprang back up onto his feet, dragging Griphook with him and the goblin clambered up onto his shoulders, out of the burning pile of things.
“Draco, what–?” she said, but he took her by the hand and began to run again.
Blaise was right, it wasn’t as bad as it had been. The ruined red flesh was gone, but his arm was still weeping blood from the lines carved there, dividing the Dark Mark. A large ‘T’.
Harry stepped back into the office and sunk into the sofa, half-listening to the broadcast as Lee Jordan, now the main voice of Magic Daily, the evening News broadcast, introduced Hermione.
“Pardon me, sir,” Isobel interrupted and Snape turned his cold black eyes on her. If she flinched internally, she did not show it. “But surely, if you were choosing the best out of our year, Hermione Granger would be Head Girl, not me?” she asked and Snape’s lips pursed, as if he had just sucked on a lemon. Draco leaned back in his chair, suddenly a little afraid for Isobel.
Luna and Ollivander exchanged poignant goodbyes and Fleur darted forward to kiss him on each cheek, asking that Ollivander return the wedding tiara to Bill’s Aunt Muriel and handing it over. With a final wave, Bill and Ollivander disappeared out the front door.
The seventh-year boys dormitory smelt of freshly laundered sheets and peppermint. It was laid out like a hospital ward, two lines of four-poster beds, three on one side and two on the other. Draco’s bed was nearest the door, and his trunk was already laid at the foot of the bed. He rummaged inside it for pyjamas and then went to light the lamp on the bedside table. He noticed a small note propped up against it and blinked when he realised it was Snape’s handwriting spelling out his name on the front.
“There’re spare blankets by the door if you want to grab one. Be quiet, though – Hermione’s sleeping after the night watch,” he said and Draco nodded. He stood and went over to the tent and pushed aside the flap to glance inside. It was warm and dark inside, and one section of the tent had its internal flaps unrolled, closing off the area – he assumed that was where Granger was sleeping. There was a simple but functional kitchen, a rough wood dining table that was strewn with books, another sleeping area and another closed off area, that Draco imagined was a bathroom. He found the stack of blankets next to the kitchen cabinets, and he took one, spun from wool, and draped it around his shoulders like a cloak, heading back to the fire.
“No, it isn’t,” Harry said stubbornly and Draco felt his heart swell with affection. His brave Gryffindor. “Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who, and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to keep going until I succeed – or I die. Don't think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years,” he said and Draco felt his heart skip a beat.
“I’m Draco Malfoy,” he murmured to their bones and the wind shifted, as though they could hear him. “I – I haven’t been a very good person. My family isn’t a good family. I’m sure we’re responsible, in some way, for your deaths. I’m –” and he gulped in cold winter air, tears stinging his eyes. “I’m so sorry. Your son – he’s
“Dumbledore had my Cloak, the night my parents died!” his voice was loud and shaking, and Draco reared back from him. He looked slightly manic again, as if he could see all the pieces lining up. “My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow!” He somehow got his leg free from the bench and now stood at the head of the table, his hands gesturing wildly as he spoke. “Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow…” Potter turned on his heel and wandered into the centre of the tent, turning sharply once more to cry out, “He’s my ancestor! I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!”
Potter, either unfazed or uncaring about Draco’s presence, stripped down to his boxers and waded out into the freezing lake, gasping as the cold water tumbled over his skin. Draco kept a lookout and occasionally snuck glances. Potter was lean in the way best suited to a Seeker, muscular but slim. The muscles in his arms flexed as he dunked himself under the water, washing away the dust and blood from the day, and as he reappeared at the surface his skin broke out into goose pimples.
Harry raised a fist and knocked on the door, tucking his chin down into his scarf to keep himself warm. There was a long minute where nothing happened and then the door creaked and groaned, pulled open from the inside.
“No,” he whispered, his voice soft and tremulous. “Severus… Severus, get up,” he said, reaching his shaking hands for the man’s shoulders. He shook them once and his head lolled, his dark, lank hair falling in front of his face. “You have to get up! Severus, get
"You want me to wait? In my office?!" Harry's voice became louder and more shrill, a feeling of sickness overwhelming him. "While you, what, wait for a ransom note to show up, demanding money or magic or
"The Headmistress reported them missing not five minutes ago, Sir," he said, with forced respect, "We've sent Aurors to meet the train en route, and another team to Kings Cross to check the platform, but we haven't heard anything back yet. Please - wait in your office, we'll come find you as soon as-,"
A year ago, he had received a Patronus. The large silver stag had barrelled into his workshop on la Rue de la Tremoille, and gave him Harry's message. "
“Let’s get lunch, I can sort it out later,” she said, striding off towards the sunlit outdoors. Harry and Malfoy followed, knocking shoulders as they went through the door, both of them squeezing inwards slightly. Harry felt heat rise on his cheeks, and mentally chided himself. He was not a schoolboy anymore!
Draco woke with a start, sitting bolt upright. Someone was pounding a fist on his bedroom door, the door shuddering with each blow. Draco gasped, trying to catch his breath from being woken up with a fright, and picked up his wand with shaking fingers.
Harry had gone to meet with Malfoy soon after he and his Mother had been sentenced. They had started off coldly civil and had ended with a raging argument, but Harry kept coming back for more, because Malfoy understood. He got what it had meant to look at the War, the casualties, and realise that all of it had rested firmly at his feet.
“Why would a symbol of Dark Magic be in a children’s book?” she asked waspishly and he frowned at her. He pulled the book closer and began translating.
He shook his head, trying to clear it, and looked up to see the snake on the floor, eyeing him hungrily. She curled around herself, an undulating mass, and Draco had to choke back the urge to scream. The Dark Lord stood next to her beside the fireplace, the only light source in the room, and before him, to Draco’s left, were two moaning figures, huddled on the floor.
“Where the Hell have you been?” Harry shouted, and Ron grinned.
“Leave it, Ron. Malfoy,” and the warning tone was obvious in Potter’s voice, and Draco waved a dismissive hand to let him know he didn’t need to say anything more. “I’ve got to try out this new wand anyway,” Potter said to Weasley, obviously changing the subject, and they went further into the tent, their voices muffled.
“I will. But as a favour to me, could you somehow get word to my mother that I got out? That I’m safe?” he asked and Dobby gave him a solemn nod. Relieved, he squeezed past Dobby and opened the door.
“I don’t know how you do it, mate. The idea of writing more essays after those years at Hogwarts is enough to make my stomach turn,” he said and Hermione huffed, though it sounded more like a laugh. “It still surprises me that you decided to go to University,” Ron admitted, running his thumb nail over the edge of the label on the bottle in his hands. “Thought that was Hermione’s area of expertise,” he added teasingly, and Hermione gave a playful tug on his hair. Ron turned to look at her and gave him an enamoured sort of smile, which she returned. Harry felt a pang of loneliness.
“I’m not supposed to… I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes…” he murmured and then he was a deadweight in Draco’s arms.
a second later.
Would they succeed? Historically, Potter had always managed to get away, but only a few days ago, Voldemort had taken his father’s wand to use against Potter – and then killed Professor Burbage with it. Draco shuddered and screwed his eyes shut at the memory. Her screams…
“What d’you mean, ‘
“You’ll have to close your eyes to get into the wards,” she said and he paused in lifting the backpack up over his arms. “It’ll be the only time you’ll have to,” she added and he nodded.
“We know,” she said quietly. “It's why one of the terms is that he can have it after we’re done with it, using it on the Horcruxes,” she explained but Draco shook his head.
Mrs Weasley, for all her maternal charm, was a fierce dueller. Her wand twirled and spun in her hand, and curses blazed before Bellatrix could ever think to respond. The air was alight with gold, green, blue, red streams of light and Bellatrix’s smile wavered, turning into more of a snarl.
’,” he read aloud and he frowned even more at her. “Why do you have The Tales of Beedle the Bard?” he asked and she sighed, reaching out to take the book back. He handed it over and she stroked a finger down the spine as if in reverence.
“Well it’s the Black house, innit?” asked the other Death Eater in a nasally voice. “Why not send in the Malfoy brat? He’s Black enough, right?” and his companion laughed.
Outside there was a clatter and a wave of noise, and Harry stood up from behind his desk, his heart racing. Had something happened? Had they found the boys? What was going -
"She's done her usual walk-through of the train, and couldn't find them anywhere. She triple-checked, Harry - they're not on the train," McGonagall said. Harry stared at her.
His hair was ruffled, like he had run his fingers through it too many times, and, not that Harry was looking particularly, his lips were flushed pink, probably from Malfoy biting them nervously. Harry had to look away before he embarrassed himself by staring.
“Good morning,” Draco said politely and Potter grunted at him. He lowered himself down onto one of the logs and raised his hands over the fire, which was gently smoldering. “Can’t you use
“He’s been
“Ok, ok!” she said, waving a hand to send him back into place. She withdrew Bellatrix’s wand as they came to the wall at the back of the small courtyard, tapping it in sequence until the wall unfurled in front of them. They stepped through into a much changed Diagon Alley.
’ and I thought – what does that matter? Why does that mean she has to die?” His words were slurred and thick with tears but Potter was stroking a thumb over the curve of his knee and Draco tried to take a steadying breath.
“Yeah, but your parents? Well, they’re in his inner circle, aren’t they?” Weasley asked and Draco sniffed.
“YOU-”
And they had
The elf led him to the very back of the kitchen, next to the large fireplace, where he pressed a little knot of wood on one of the towering jambs. It sprang outwards, revealing a tall but narrow doorway.
Anything in the compartment accessed by a false book in the third bookcase from the left? No.
“Of course. You know I will,” he promised her and she sniffed and gave him a quick hug. “I’ve got to get on the train now. I’ll send you a letter after the Sorting,” he told her and she gave him a wavering smile as he boarded the train and shut the door behind him, engaging the lock.
Breathing shakily, Harry looked over at the small alarm clock sat on the bedside table.
Potter turned his gaze back to Hermione, who took a step back. “The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer Muggles by force,” he ground out and Draco felt a spike of something like fear go through his spine. Dumbledore, conquer Muggles? Hermione’s lip trembled again and she sniffed. It looked like they were going to continue their argument despite his appearance.
“Yes,” she murmured, brushing away some stray snow that lay across the carved letters. “That sample in the
don’t think important enough to mention.” Draco’s heart felt like it swooped and he suddenly felt a pang of fear. To be as isolated as they had been, it felt like the war was something distant. They hadn’t heard of any deaths, but then they hadn’t had the opportunity either. Potter was leaning forward in his armchair, his fingertips pressed to his mouth, looking gravely concerned.
He tried to keep himself busy. He tidied the tent, straightening the beds and fluffing the armchair cushions. He set cleaning spells on every surface he could find, and when that was all done, he picked up a book from the pile on the dining table and set to reading it, or at least attempting to.
“As we progress through the school year, you may notice changes to your classes as we receive new guidance from the Ministry of Magic, which is now under the leadership of Pius Thicknesse. In accordance with his directives, all Muggle-born students must be registered with the Ministry. I have asked your Head of House to assist any students with the required forms,” he said and Draco glanced over at the other house tables. The Mudbloods sat amongst them paled and turned with frightened expressions to their fellow students.
The next morning started the same as the one before, though Mipsy wasn’t in the kitchen with a cooked breakfast for them. Harry, a little sleep-deprived from his early morning study session downstairs (though he had gone back to bed about an hour after Ron) burned a slice of toast on the Aga and scrapped as much char off as he could before lathering it with butter and marmalade while he waited for the kettle to boil, listening to Ron’s off-key singing from the shower upstairs. Harry was, in truth, very impressed that he could hear it at all, but judging by Hermione’s eye-roll as she entered the kitchen, her hair tied back in a bun today, she was used to it.
“The sword of Godric Gryffindor,” she told him and Draco burst out laughing. She looked offended and even when he looked at Potter for some sort of reassurance, he also looked confused.
Albus' football cleats were kicked into a corner by the staircase, still muddy even after Harry had told him repeatedly to put them in the utility room. A stack of Scorpius' books were piled precariously on the bottom step, awaiting their owner to return them to their place on the bookshelves in his room upstairs. One of their jumpers, knitted by Mrs. Weasley, lay crumpled over the banister. Harry reached for it, stumbling to take it down and bring it to his face, and he buried his nose in it. He inhaled.
“That would be great Hermione, thank you,” he said and then Ron’s voice reappeared.
“How was the lake?” Hermione asked as she fished out three bowls from the cabinets in the kitchen. She paused for a second after setting them on the side and then grabbed another, before reaching for the paper bag – she pulled a silver flask out and began to unscrew the lid that was inlaid with the Hogwarts crest.
He and Harry had had a fair few fights about giving Albus' the Invisibility Cloak (with the proviso that he shared it with Scorpius, of course). Harry thought it was useful for both boys, while Draco was convinced it was dangerous and would get them into more trouble. A fair few times Harry had thrown the fact that he had raised the boys alone (without his help, thanks) back in Draco's face, and a fair few times Draco had stormed out of the house and found himself drowning his sorrows at the Leaky Cauldron, but they had finally agreed that Albus could have it, as long as the Headmistress was aware, and agreed, to let him. And surprisingly, she had.
“Sorry, no, but look!” she said, pointing at the dark stone she was crouched in front of. Potter stooped down and Draco came in next to him, squinting into the darkness to see the name carved into the lichen-spotted granite. ‘
“-doe first, obviously-” Weasley was saying but then Hermione interrupted him.
Draco joined in the screams of elation, the noise torn from him without his conscious thought as Harry, alive, locked eyes with Voldemort, and then the air went silent and still.
“Accidents!” Voldemort screamed, desperate now, but he did not strike and Hermione’s hand tightened around Draco’s. He held onto her. “Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and snivelled behind the skirts of greater men and women and permitted me to kill them for you!”
Planning began again after that. The Ministry had to be put under the Dark Lord’s control, and they had to find Potter. Many suspected he had been secreted away at an Order hideout but no one could agree where, and it had been four days since Potter had slipped from the Dark Lord’s grasp. Many felt that time was running out, much like the Dark Lord’s patience.
Draco landed, coughing and retching, onto a stretch of damp sand, his trousers instantly soaked through. The goblin, still in his arms, groaned. He settled the goblin onto the sand, checking him for any obvious injuries. From the awkward angles they rested at, his legs were clearly broken.
“I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!”
Draco’s feet carried him where his mind could not and soon he was standing by his cousin's corpse. In death, her hair was light brown, and her face was serene. Her husband, who had been elated all those months ago, overjoyed at the birth of his son, lay next to her, his face turned to hers. He looked as peaceful as his wife, as though they had both just fallen asleep.
“Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die–” he murmured and the starlight caught the elf’s eyes and they glowed brilliantly for a second and Draco heard him whisper into the night.
“I’m going to see if Hermione’s finished planning,” he threw over his shoulder as he walked away. Draco lingered at the bottom of the clearing, spinning his wand between his fingers. He raised it once more and whispered “
His Patronus slipped out of his wand and the stag shook his antlers, and gave Harry a solemn look.
"Off home, Mr. P?" she asked, tutting at the quill as it jotted down what she had just said. It crossed out the last words it had written apologetically.
“Thank you. We can’t thank you enough. You’ve saved our lives,” he said sincerely and Aberforth grunted. Harry stepped closer, his eyes flicking over the man’s face with a frown. “It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror,” he said and there was silence in the room, Draco frowning from confusion as Aberforth and Harry studied each other. “You sent Dobby,” he said finally and Draco frowned even more.
"If anything happens," he started, but Hermione opened her mouth to protest, "No, Hermione,
“You don’t understand. He’s not what he says he is,” he tried to explain to them, but Crabbe shrugged one shoulder.
“Yes, Master Malfoy?” she asked, and he crouched until they were at eye level, her eyes wide in wonderment.
“I went to Australia. Birrarung Marr University,” Harry replied simply, and Malfoy raised an eyebrow in surprise.
“Darling?” Mother asked, cautiously pecking her husband on the cheek when he was closer to her. “Shall I get a Pepper-Up Potion for you?” she asked and even though Draco couldn’t see his father’s face, he still saw when the loose line of Father’s shoulders went rigid. His mother’s smile went taut at the edges, but she didn’t step away.
She unwound a foul-smelling black shawl from around her head and shoulders, revealing a small cap of thinning white hair, and Draco pinched his nose as she dropped it onto the floor sending fumes of stale food and unwashed bodies up into the air.
“Likely a Parkinson or a Greengrass. A great-grandmother was a Bulstrode, so that’s too close to marry into that family again,” he said primly and Potter looked up from where he was hunched over and grinned at him. Draco gave him a foul look too. “Oh, please. It’s not like I’m actually going to marry anyone,” he said waspishly and Potter frowned at him.
Silently, he and Granger stood and he put an arm around her shoulders and she an arm around his waist and they moved away without talking, but Draco didn’t follow them. He waited until they were out of ear shot and then shed the cloak, pulling it loose from over his head, standing before the grave of Lily and James Potter, wanting to stand before them as he was, not hide in the shadows.
“Do you know this place? It’s your Mother’s ancestral home,” Potter asked, turning in a slow circle around the room. Draco frowned – the conversation seemed disjointed, like Potter’s thoughts were three steps ahead of Draco’s own. Potter was still turning as he asked. “Hey, do you know who R.A.B is?”
trunk," he said and it lifted into the air and began wobbling towards him, catching briefly on the doorway to Albus' room. He cast the same spell at Scorpius' trunk and set off down the stairs, both trunks drifting lazily behind him.
“It was in their tent! Release me, I say!” Greyback growled and Bellatrix waved her wand. He sprang to his feet and looked like he was thinking about attacking her but thought better of it and went to skulk in the shadows behind an armchair.
They sat in silence for a while longer, sipping their tea. Hermione sighed and stood, looking at the clock on the wall.
There was a small noise from behind them and he turned to see that Harry had turned away from the group, one hand pressed to his head. He let go of Hermione’s arm.
“Harry,” he said, reaching out a hand. They shook, though it felt oddly formal after their weeks of letter writing. “Has Granger gone in already?” he asked, jamming his hands into his coat pockets, his nose pink in the cold.
As the hikers and the cyclists and the day-trippers started to appear along the forest trails, he strained to hear their conversation as he went past, listening for any mention of someone who might fit the description of Potter or Granger. He was about to head back down to the lake when he passed a young family walking in the opposite direction.
No more.
"Well, thank you. And yourself? From what I heard, you were studying just around the corner from here?” Malfoy asked, and Hermione nodded, looking pleased that Malfoy knew.
A house-elf in a neat dress and pinafore was humming to herself in the kitchen, and she looked up as Harry entered. She gave a quick bow and gestured for him to take a seat at the long scrubbed wooden table that had been in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place since he could remember.
“We were so worried!” she cried into his hair and he gingerly patted her on the back. “I know I told you to run, but where did you go? No letters, nothing!” she drew away and with a pang he had to look away from her tear-streaked face.
“Yes, sir,” he stood on weak legs and turned to leave.
"We came as soon as we could. We need to help," Ginny said by way of explanation, her eyes locked on Harry's. Luna sat down next to Harry and threaded one of her arms through his, leaning over to rest her cheek on his shoulder, humming quietly to herself.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world, Ron,” he replied and Ron gave him a relieved smile.
, fell in place in front of him, expanding in the middle of the hall and Voldemort’s fury was forgotten as he searched wildly for the caster. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw the air ripple and then Harry dropped the invisibility cloak and stepped out into the open.
“Penelope Clearwater,” Hermione said, her voice wavering but still clear.
Draco rolled one shoulder in a shrug. “I came across it in a book. I was just curious,” he added and she smiled. Her gaze flickered to the doorway when a shout sounded in the hallway and they didn’t speak again.
Draco did not take his seat yet. His father’s back was to him and he watched as his father pushed up the table cloth and dug his nails into the finely polished wood of the dining table, before he relaxed, and then dug them in again. The wood would be scarred now, but Draco couldn’t find it in himself to care. No one would ever see it under the pristine tablecloths laid out every night.
"I know where he might have them," he said in a trembling voice, and he set off into the darkened house, heading for the stone staircase. They all followed.
“Let’s talk about it another time, maybe?” Granger suggested. She picked up the book and went back to her original seat, picking up her mug of tea from where she’d left it on the ground.
“Am I dreaming again?” Draco asked, realising after it left his mouth that the question was stupid. Of course he was dreaming again, but what he had meant to say was, is this one of those dreams? The dreams that had led him to Harry. Dumbledore only smiled.
“I saw something move, I could have sworn I did…” she murmured back and she stepped away from Potter, breaking her hold on him to withdraw her wand from her jacket. Potter gave her an incredulous look.
"Pardon me?" he asked through gritted teeth. Luna's hold on Harry's arm tightened. Belinda left the room fairly quickly.
And if he had chosen to live in Australia for a little bit of anonymity, well, that was his decision alone.
“Dumbledore said it. He said fear of the name increases fear of the thing itself. I won’t be scared to say his name,” he said firmly and Draco’s heart swelled a little to hear it, and he nodded.
His whole body felt like it was in turmoil. His head was pounding and his mouth was dry, his heart was racing and the muscles in his legs twitched with unspent adrenaline, and every nerve was shrieking at him to go and find his children - to find them and rescue them and then kill the bastard that dared to even think about taking them from him.
“What do you mean?” he asked and Draco gave him a sombre look.
“Draco’s come home, Bella,” Mother began to say but Bellatrix’s attention had been caught by the group bound in front of the fireplace. Her eyes glinted manically in the light from the fire.
“This is a dream,” Potter murmured, almost like he was trying to convince himself that Draco was only a figment of his imagination. He blinked and picked up the conversation about Draco’s cousin. “Regulus Black swapped out the locket. He hid it from Voldemort,” he added and Draco frowned, feeling his forehead pinch together.
“Let me look,” Draco said, reaching for him but Weasley took a step back, obviously mistrustful. “Oh for Merlin’s sake – If I was here to kill or injure any of you, I would’ve done it long ago. Let me look!” he snapped, hand outstretched, and when Weasley looked to Hermione for reassurance, she gave him an encouraging nod. He still looked like he’d rather do anything else, but he lifted one side of his jumper and shirt and Draco saw some mottled bruises forming over his lower ribcage. “Episkey might take the edge off, but it’s not going to heal it. We’ll have to wrap you,” he said, and Weasley made a pained noise as he breathed in and out. “Hold still –
. Absolutely not,”
Harry’s eyes snapped open only a minute or two later, and he took a deep, shuddering breath. He pushed their hands off him and sat up, shivering still.
“But did you hear what Fred said?” he asked excitedly. Draco assumed it was a contributor that he had missed while being outside. “He’s abroad! He’s still looking for the wand, I knew it!”
“You wish,” he replied, trying to keep his tone playful and Potter smiled at him. Draco crossed his arms over his chest. “What’s your plan?” he asked and Potter looked away from him, back out the window.
"All okay?" Ron asked, eyeing the boys with a concerned look on his face.
“Looks like Potter, Granger and Weasley weren’t the only ones missing from the train,” he said with a vicious twist of his lips, “Thomas isn’t here either. Finnigan looks like he’s missing a limb, bless him,” Blaise said sarcastically and Draco did not comment, instead choking down the meal laid before him. Towards the end of the feast, Slughorn left the High Table and came over to Draco.
“Oh!” Granger said with delight and she fished one out and checked the label. “Tuna and sweetcorn. I’ve been craving one of these! Here–” and she passed the bag to Potter who took another out and smiled down at the label.
“I did know Mr Riddle, many a year ago,” the Baron acknowledged, gliding forward.
“That’s it, you’re done,” she said, releasing his hand and he opened his eyes as she stepped away.
After a year of being back in Grimmauld Place, Draco had long since gotten used to the boys' quirks and charms. Scorpius was a bit of an insomniac, while Albus slept like the dead. Albus was loud and brash and laughed hard, while Scorpius was quiet, reserved, and fairly emotional. Albus' anger burned hot and bright for a short amount of time, while Scorpius could hold a grudge like it was a sport. And some of these things, Draco had learned the hard way. When he had been cornered in the kitchen on Sunday morning, and had a very formal conversation with the boys about Harry, during which they both subtly threatened to make his life very miserable if he hurt their Dad, Draco had been left feeling both proud and fond of his boys, and could see exactly why the Sorting Hat had put them both in Slytherin. (He also believed every word they had said and vowed never to so much as make Harry a bit upset if it meant preserving his own life.)
Another Weasley appeared, judging from his red hair and he surveyed the scene with a stricken face. He was about the same height as Weasley – Ron – but his hair was long and tied loosely at the base of his neck. Draco realised that he knew this brother, he recognised him as the groom from the wedding – Bill.
“Fine, thanks. You?” Harry asked, trying to keep his voice neutral and light. Cameron squirmed in his chair a little and Harry felt his stomach clench. He knew what was coming. “Cameron-,” he tried to say ahead of his ex-boyfriend, but Cameron beat him to the punch.
“Are you done with your touching reunion?” Aberforth asked blandly behind them as they broke apart. Harry turned to him, looking relieved.
“And you won’t even talk to me,” Draco said thickly into Potter’s shoulder, and he stiffened slightly. “You won’t even
“We got out,” Draco said simply, putting the water back down. “You had… some kind of fit. The locket burned you. I’m sorry, but we had to use a Severing Charm to get it off,” he said, gesturing to Potter’s bare chest. He looked down at it and frowned at the oval mark left there. “It’ll scar. Dark Magic, you understand,” he added quietly, and Potter nodded, taking a steadying breath. “What happened, once you went upstairs?”
doesn't extend luncheon invitations often," he said, tilting his head back to look up at the winding staircase above him. Harry remained silent. "I'll sleep on the sofa, then, shall I?" Malfoy suggested eventually, and Harry looked over at him. He looked tired - exhausted, even, and Harry probably looked worse himself. Malfoy ran a hand over his face and breathed deeply, the inhale catching slightly in his throat, but Harry didn't comment. He was very sure that if he stopped for a minute, he would probably burst into tears himself.
“You were looking for me?” he asked, going for a light tone as he stepped out from between the statue and bust. Snape surveyed him, taking in his pale skin, the dark smudges under his eyes, the jumper he had worn three days in a row, despite the blazing summer heat, because it was all too much right now.
’ and ’
“What is all this racket!” shouted the tall man who had just come out of the door, and the Death Eaters turned to him.
He took a few steps forward and shook the Fellows hand, and then she led him into a room.
"Why aren't they doing anything?" Hermione muttered, annoyed, from behind Harry, and he resisted the urge to whip around and glare at her. If she thought she was feeling impatient-!
“Regardless, you have overcome so much. Your family, your ideology – it is very noble,” Dumbledore said and Draco blinked rapidly.
Around them, a chorus of “
“It is. An enchanted map. My dad made it with some friends while he was at Hogwarts,” he explained and Draco made an appreciative noise. It was an impressive display of magic.
“It’s about the mark, isn’t it? The one from the book and on the grave. Didn’t you say Viktor Krum had told you it was Grindelwald’s mark?” he asked Potter who nodded.
,’ he had snapped one night when Draco announced he missed Dobby.
“My cousin was Regulus Black,” Draco suddenly said and Potter frowned at him. Granger looked surprised at the comment but didn’t say anything. “Maybe I’m more like him than I thought. Maybe I’ve learned to keep secrets too,” he said and while Granger looked confused, Potter merely gave him another once-over look and then lowered his wand slightly, lifting his mug of tea to take a sip. There, they sat in silence, drinking their tea and letting the fire warm them.
Ron grinned and gestured for Harry to sit down. “How was your Portkey over? And the talk, how’d that go?” he asked and Harry settled back into the sofa to talk about his day. Ron was changed from the last time Harry had seen him in person four years ago, but for the better. Still tall and lanky with red hair and freckles, his eyes seemed bright and lively. Hermione had told him that Ron had completed his Auror training and then promptly quit to join George in running Weasley Wizard Wheezes and Harry agreed that this profession suited him better. There was colour in his cheeks now, and he no longer looked as haunted as he had at the age of 18, with the Fred’s death still fresh on all of their minds.
“Soup today. Oh, there’s some sandwiches too,” she added, tucking one hand into the bag again and pulling out some individually wrapped sandwiches. She gave Weasley a look and then removed her wand from where she had tucked it into her jeans and tapped one of the bowls, pushing it aside with a warming charm over it. She stepped away and let Draco and Potter collect their own lunch, and then they drifted to the dining table.
“Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for coming. Following a rigorous examination, and a round of enlightening Vivas, I would like to congratulate all of our short-listed candidates on having made it this far,” and he led the assembled hall in a round of applause. He then unfurled the piece of paper clutched in his hand. Harry glanced at Hermione, who was staring straight ahead, her gaze focused like a laser, her knuckles bleached white from her grip on Ron’s hand. He then glanced at Draco, who held Harry’s own hand in a firm hold but looked calm, serene even. Yes, Harry did have everything he needed, right here. The Fellow cleared his throat, and Harry leaned forward.
“They’ve cursed it!
He would.
“He has these… visions, and he just dropped,” Draco said, and Bill took out his wand, waving it in a complicated motion over Potter’s twitching form, frowning.
“No. There’s no way he’d have gone to the Forest. I’ll… He’ll be somewhere nearby,” he said firmly and then he turned on his heels and jogged away.
He let the stairs carry him down to the open corridor and then he pressed his face to the cool stone next to the gargoyle, which sniffed in derision at his obvious emotional state. His mother’s letter was still clenched in his hand, but he didn’t need to reread it to understand it’s meaning.
“Stand still, don’t move!” Hermione said just as Harry said “Okay, don’t touch anything!” desperately and Draco bared his teeth at them both.
"Yes, well, that's all a given, really-," Thompson cut in, but he stopped when Ron raised his wand again. Another Auror, Mulligan, spoke up.
“You’d need to ask Harry. I’m not going to be the one to tell you,” she said with a slightly petulant tone, as if he was picking up the thread of an argument that had been going on for far longer than he would ever know. He gave her a small smile and left her to the books and notes.
“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,” Granger said soothingly and Draco squeezed his shoulder slightly, acknowledging the statement. “It means… you know… living beyond death. Living after death,” she explained and Draco cleared his throat.
“I’ve been with them,” he said, gesturing around the room to encompass the trio.
They brought down the wards under the cover of darkness, huddled under the cloak together. As the magic melted away, Draco listened intently for the sound of anyone approaching. The forest around them had a thick layer of snow on the ground and still more fell, creating a strange sensation of being smothered and standing in a void at the same time. He turned his head sharply at the sound of a twig snapping behind him but then Hermione took his hand.
“- I meant to, and that’s what did it. I’ve done what my mother did. They’re protected from you. Haven’t you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can’t torture them. You can’t touch them. You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?” Harry said and there was a note of pride to his voice. Draco realised the same time that Hermione did that he was right – none of the spells Voldemort had placed on them all had lasted. The Silencing Charm broke twice. Neville could break free of the Body-Bind Curse placed upon him. Harry was right! Hermione’s hand squeezed his own tightly, and they held the truth of Harry’s words close.
“Yeah, Xenophilius Lovegood was wearing it around his neck at Bill and Fleur’s wedding,” Potter acknowledged. “Hermione, why–?” but she had turned on her heel and gone marching back to her bedroom, returning a few seconds later with a book in her hands. It was ‘
As night began to fall and the forest went dark, he avoided the park rangers and found a clearing. He charmed the small area around it with wards, lifting his hands and his wand and repeating “
“The wand. The Elder wand. It’s buried with Dumbledore at Hogwarts,” he said and Hermione gasped, rocking slightly where she was leaning. Ron went to steady her and Potter shook his head.
THE END
Snape held his hands up for quiet and the Slytherins fell silent. Draco looked over at the other tables and the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were still and silent – a few Hufflepuff students looked to be hastily wiping away tears. The Gryffindors were barely holding themselves in check. He could see tightened fists and murderous glances from the other side of the Great Hall – a few looked over at him in disgust. Overhead, the cloud covered sky tumbled and swirled, the moon hidden from their view.
“Isn’t that a Death Eater idea?” Potter asked and he glanced behind him blindly, unsure of where Draco had gone or if he was even near. Draco touched his shoulder to let him know and Potter seemed to relax a little bit. “Why is that there?” he asked both him and Granger.
“You certainly did. Now,” Harry closed the book and set it neatly down next to the tray of tea things. “Kiss me again,” and Draco was still laughing when Harry brought their lips together once more.
“When I figure that out, I’ll let you know.”
If Harry had to cast a Patronus, it would give him away instantly. Everyone knew about the beautiful stag… but no one knew what Draco’s was. No one knew he even had one.
die when there’s no one left who remembers them,” he explained quietly and Potter began to blink rapidly. Draco watched, his heart clenched in sympathy, as Potter’s borrowed face crumpled and the tears began to fall. Draco tightened his hand on Potter’s shoulder even as it shook with suppressed sobs. Granger, her own bottom lip trembling, reached out and took Potter’s hand and Draco longed to do the same, to provide comfort, but hidden under the cloak he couldn’t.
?” His voice was cold and harsh and Draoc had no choice but to lean to his other side and withdraw the holly wand from where it had been laid on Potter’s ruined shirt and jumper, handing it over. Potter’s expression went slack, like someone had just punched the air out of him, as Draco lay the wand in his trembling hand. Potter gulped, as though surfacing from underwater, and turned his wide eyes to Draco. “Mend it. Please,” he said quietly, his voice pained, and Draco pulled a face.
“We’ll,” and Potter blinked rapidly, swallowing around the emotion lodged in his throat. “We’ll find a way to repair it,” he said, as if convincing himself and Draco gave him a sympathetic look, his head tilted slightly.
“Well, what else can I say?” Weasley replied, his hands outstretched as if in surrender. Draco drew back even further and then slipped inside the tent. It was warmer inside, though not by much, and he sat down heavily on the bunk that Potter had claimed, fisting his hands in the fabric of his jumper as he sat. The conversation outside grew louder as the trio approached the tent.
The storm howled around them as Harry slipped his hands inside Draco’s shirt, stroking his thumbs along Draco’s ribs, sliding higher and higher until they flicked against Draco’s nipples, causing him to gasp into Harry’s mouth, pressing closer to him.
"What about us?" Harry asked, but Hermione shook her head.
places," she told them cryptically. Draco went a little pale but nodded to himself and thanked his Grandmother quietly. He turned to the Aurors, Harry, Ron and Hermione and nodded.
“Where did you get this?” Harry asked, pointing to the mantlepiece. Draco was confused for a moment, thinking that Harry was pointing to the portrait, but then he noticed the small rectangular mirror propped up underneath the portrait, wedged up against the frame. He frowned at it.
“I did. I didn’t want to. But He had – the Dark Lord – He had threatened my parents. He was going to kill them and me. I was – I wanted to save them,” he managed to choke out and his voice sounded strained even to his own ears. Granger’s gaze turned a smidge sympathetic while Potter still watched him with mistrust. “I regret it. If I could do it all over again, I would’ve taken Dumbledore’s first offer of help. I would’ve disappeared with him that night. But I made a mistake – a mistake that I will have to live with the rest of my life. I hate myself for it,” he admitted.
“Thank you Mother, I would appreciate the updates,” he told her and she gave him a watery smile.
He hadn't moved straight back in to Grimmauld Place, which he and Harry had agreed on soon after the boys had gone back to Hogwarts (only a week and a bit later than planned, and escorted by Aurors the whole way). He had moved back to London, though, and rented a flat for six months in Peckham, and then after his lease had ended, he had moved into a spare room at Grimmauld Place. And then one day, which hadn't been a very special day at all, he had woken up in Harry's bed in the morning, and went to sleep in it that night, and hadn't slept anywhere else since.
His pale face was serene, his red eyes surveying the room as though he could tell their innermost thoughts from just a glance. Draco forced himself to look upon the Dark Lord, though, with deference, for looking away would cause suspicion, and suspicion would lead to… many different things.
“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he said, his voice weary and quiet. He was talking about the Resurrection Stone, Draco realised. “I dropped it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?”
“They caught up with us at West Bilney Woods. Dirk got lazy, didn’t set up the wards properly. Him and Ted – well, they took the brunt of it,” Dean said softly and Ron patted his shoulder sympathetically. Dean blinked rapidly and took a sip of his tea. “What about you, Luna?” he asked.
“I would prefer to be in charge of all my faculties tonight,” he told her and she nodded, casting a long glance over her husband who was staring into the bottom of his wine glass like it held all the answers that had only so recently slipped through his fingers. “Has the Dark Lord arrived yet?” Snape asked, and his dark gaze flicked over Draco, who felt a chill go along his spine.
"What a name for a bear!" he said with a hint of delight and Harry smiled. From the frame, both boys waved at them, Scorpius lifting one of Aloysius' paws to make him wave too.
“It’s too dangerous. I can’t have any more people in danger because of me,” he said with some finality and Draco sighed.
“I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you and I shall punish every last man, woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour,”
The doors opened to the examination hall and the low rumble of noise cut off quickly. The Fellow who had given them the introductory talk yesterday began to usher the assembled candidates in and Hermione reached over to give Harry’s hand one final squeeze as they were swept away with the other applicants.
“Oh Ron – the Deathly Hallows can’t exist!” Hermione snapped, shucking her jacket. She took half a step out of the tent to shake it roughly, though it didn’t seem to do much good. Weasley huffed at her from the armchair.
"He is right," Malfoy eventually said, and Harry gaped at him. "If they're anything like we are, they'll have a plan all of their own," he continued and Harry shook his head.
“It could’ve been worse,” he said after a minute, breaking the silence. Weasley grinned at him.
Harry pulled his wand out of his inner jacket pocket and thought hard for a happy memory - the day the boys had been born. Squalling, pink, green eyes and dark thatches of hair, his beautiful sons.
Draco ducked his head down between Harry’s shoulders as he felt the air whip by him and then he was crashing to the ground in a tangle of limbs with Harry, coughing and retching.
“Well, I’ll just have to borrow one until we can fix it. Can I borrow yours for this watch?” he asked Draco and, painfully reminded of his father, Draco handed over his wand. Potter turned it in his hand but didn’t look at it, striding away for the tent door. A blast of cold air came whipping through as he stepped outside and Draco shivered. Whether it was due to the temperature or Potter’s departure, he wasn’t sure.
“He was duelling Dolohov! Haven’t seen him since,” he told her as he went and then Ginny was turning, her words dying on her lips as Nymphadora ran off after Aberforth. She turned to them, helpless, but Harry was already pacing in front of the blank stretch of wall in front of them.
“No, not yet,” he said, his voice a little hoarse. He cleared his throat as Fleur Delacour entered the cottage.
With his expression relaxed, Harry could see the boys in him. They had both inherited his blond hair (though Scorpius' was darker and Albus' curled), though both boys had Harry's bright green eyes. But there was something about their faces, sometimes - the catch of the light of their cheekbones, the curves of their smiles, that reminded Harry so much of Malfoy that it ached, just for a second.
“We don’t know what the questions will be. Besides, it’s a history paper - there’ll be one I can answer, I’m sure,” he said, and Hermione gave him a nervous smile. “Hermione, you know the Law better than most practising solicitors, I would imagine. You’ll be alright,” he said, reaching out a hand to pat hers comfortingly. “Shall I get us some drinks?” he asked and Hermione nodded, letting out a shaky breath.
He took the books and left the bedroom, cautiously making his way downstairs to the living room and shutting the door with a quiet
“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Mother said firmly in her cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that this is Potter before we summon the Dark lord. His wand Greyback, do you have his wand?” she snapped, holding out a hand and there was some awkward shuffling around the Snatchers as the wands were passed over. Mother rolled her eyes as she looked at them. “This one is my son’s…” she said, sliding Draco’s wand into her belt next to her own. “Now, this one, you are sure this was the one Potter was holding?” she asked one of the Snatchers, who nodded vigorously. She turned it over in her hands, studying it by firelight. “It does not resemble Ollivander’s description… If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing… remember what he did to Rowle and Dolohov?”
The Saturday morning before the Fellowship announcement, Harry invited Draco round to Grimmauld Place, which he accepted with some hesitation. In the library, they could be just Harry and Draco and Harry understood the reluctance of losing that - but it was important to him that his friends (mainly Ron) could see passed their childhood rivalry.
“Shall we split up to look for he–?” Ron began to ask but Hermione cut him off.
It had begun to show in his lessons. In Defence Against the Dark Arts the day before, he could barely keep his eyes open, even though Michael Corner yelped loudly when Amycus Carrow shot a Stinging Jinx at him for talking in class. The class had been shocked – the professors had never used magic on any of them before (except for the ferret incident in fourth year, though it had been established after that it had not been the actual Professor Moody who had jinxed Draco). Draco, scared into wakefulness, had kept his eyes trained on the desk in front of him and tried to avoid Amycus’ wrath.
“No, Sir,” he replied, surprised about how clear his voice sounded. The Fellow bobbed his head.
“Close your eyes. I’ll have to take you by the hand and lead you through,” she said, reaching out a hand, palm up. He hesitated, just momentarily, but if she saw him waiver, she didn’t comment. He screwed his eyes closed and reached for her hand. Her palm was cool as she closed her fingers around his hand and pulled in forward. He felt a rush of tingling, like being dunked into a pool of ice cold water, and then he was gasping on the other side.
“I hope you’re wearing enough sunscreen. You know what they say about the O-zone layer in Australia,” she cautioned and Harry bobbed his head, remembering the lectures he received when he announced he was going to be leaving England for distant shores. Hermione took her seat again and packed away her book, tucking it into the satchel bag on the floor beside her.
“Feel free,” it said with a groan. They shucked the cloak and Harry tucked it away into the pouch still hanging from around his neck, and then they clambered over the gargoyle, ignoring its huffs and puffs. They rode the spiral staircase up to the Headmaster’s office and then Harry pushed the door at the top open for them.
,” Draco murmured, holding that feeling tight in his chest and the silver mist swooped from the end of his wand, turning in a graceful arc, silver light forming into two wings and a beak and eyes that would have been amber if they hadn’t been made of starlight.
“Where are you?” Draco asked and Potter hummed, non-committal. He stepped around Draco and wandered out of the room. Draco followed him, the room around him dimming and growing dark as Potter walked away. Whatever place he was in, it must’ve been held together by Potter only, and as Draco walked in his wake, the house around them appeared and disappeared, slipping by in their path. Potter led him up some stairs and into another dingy room. It was decorated, Draco could tell that much, but everything was still blurry, like Draco was looking through a rain streaked window. If he had been awake, it would’ve given him a headache.
“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?” Draco shouted over the sounds of spells firing around the cavernous space. Harry skidded to a halt next to one of the dragon’s legs and gestured frantically at them. Draco swore loudly.
” the memory came unbidden. A round-faced girl with chestnut curls had been bouncing down the train corridor that first September journey, her face practically glowing with excitement. Draco remembered then, how his heart leapt with excitement and joy. Harry Potter, in his year? Maybe they would be friends? Maybe Potter would be in Slytherin and Draco could show him how to live in this world and they would be the best of friends until the end of time? How hopeful he had been, how ignorant, but that bright burst of happiness was enough, maybe.
“Hi Harry,” Cameron said with a smile, his warm eyes crinkling in the corners. Harry sat back in his chair, and tried to make himself smile in return.
Harry’s hand was nearly cramping when the Fellows called time on their SPECIALIST II exam. He shook his right hand as he stood, trying to get some feeling back into the tips of his fingers from where he had been squeezing his pen as he wrote furiously.
He wished he’d had the presence of mind to take the invisibility cloak, but with the school in darkness, it was fairly simple to skulk through the shadows down to the dungeons. He’d only had to hide twice, once when Mrs Norris came skittering up a corridor on the fourth floor, and once again in the entrance hall when the ghost of the Bloody Baron glided by. Thankfully, he hadn’t seen any teachers as he’d gone through the school.
who died in the War, no sons though… Shall we add him to the list?" Ron mused outloud, and Harry made a quiet noise of agreement. He wasn't used to this inactivity, but Thompson had thrown him out of the bullpen shortly after Mulligan had explained about the Golden Forty-Eight, and Hermione had agreed before she left that it was probably best if Harry didn't get overly involved in the investigation.
“Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had to,” he said. He hesitated for a second. “Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t all there. Muriel called her ‘gaga’,” he said and there was a low moan from the other room, which made both Draco and Granger jump, Granger clutching Potter’s hand. He eased her grip off and gave her a small smile. “It’s okay,” and he went to the sitting room, Granger following behind, Draco following after her. Granger's hand fluttered behind her back as though reaching for him, and he gently touched her arm as he squeezed past into a corner, making sure not to disturb anything, settling into a corner next to a chest of drawers.
“Come on Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it! Vol–”
But he never finished. As if being controlled by some other force, Potter’s wand moved as if pulled on a string, pointing to the Dark Lord. It let out a burst of golden flame which crackled like lightning in the rushing air of the night. The spell, though it wasn’t one that Draco recognised, met with the tip of Lucius’ wand, still held in Voldemort’s hand and the wand fractured, split down the middle. Draco gaped at it – Father’s wand, destroyed.
Harry dropped the two parts of his wand on the Headmaster’s desk and then stepped closer – Draco, Ron and Hermione shuffled forward to watch.
“To Godric’s Hollow? Isn’t it a wizarding village?” he asked and they both turned to look at him. “What’s in Godric’s Hollow?” he asked and Granger chewed on her lip for a second before closing her book, marking her place with a finger.
“I’m sorry,” Draco muttered stupidly and Potter laughed against his cheek, the sound a bit wet from the tears.
“Yes, Dobby is hearing about things upstairs, sir. Like Harry Potter is missing, and that Professor Snape is now Headmaster. There are many changes upstairs,” he added a bit sadly and Draco nodded. Dobby stacked the firewood next to him and looked around for any logs that might have rolled away and Draco remembered suddenly that his father had mentioned Dobby’s disappearance exactly once – ‘
