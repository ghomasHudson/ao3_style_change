“Harry?  What gives?” Ron said, finding Harry readying himself for a third round of headbutting the door.
Then again, he couldn’t see her spending months getting to know a bloke, wining, dining, and all that, if what she fancied was a simple shag.  She’d always been one to order off the menu straight away, not listen to the specials.
“Okay,” she said, brushing crumbs off on her trousers, “if I outrank the werewolf, they’d show their neck, and then I’d do what?  Lick it?”
Malfoy’s attention returned to the screen, and he realized Hermione’s tracking information had disappeared, and he was looking at a conversation between Hermione and Harry. Curiosity got the better of him, and he tapped “See Previous” in the window while keeping his attention on the conversation in the room.
Harry drew a deep breath and stretched, muscles shuddering and lengthening all the way down to his toes.  Draco nearly fell off the bed, squeaked and clung to him.  “Scoot over,
She shook her head and slid her textbook to the floor.  His lips had started working their way from her scar to the inside of her elbow, and she was having trouble focusing on his hyper rambling.
“S’locked.  Give it here.”  Her hand waited expectantly as he set her mobile on her palm.  “Says Draco’s alright.”
“Alright.  Harry, we’re just going to throw some variety together, mostly for stock.”  She fiddled with equipment.  “You know, because this is your
“No, I don’t think so.  Like, I can tell he’s asleep downstairs, and dreaming about something he likes, but only if I think about him.”  Ron’s face screwed up in disgust.  “It’s gross.  I’m not looking forward to knowing when he’s taking a shit or jerking off.”
Draco’s thrusts took on new urgency as his groans pitched higher.  Harry dug his thumb in above the other man’s pubic bone, pressing on the length moving inside him.
Slowly, Harry’s lips brushed Draco’s fingertips, and Draco’s breath shuddered in. Sticky sweet lips skimmed down to his palm, and Harry’s tongue darted out to lick sugary residue from Draco’s skin.
His nostrils flared, and he realized he was breathing too quickly.  He was tempted to run after her and ask, but long-practiced standoffishness got the better of him.  Malfoys don’t give chase.
It was oddly specific for the Ministry, which made Harry assume several such entanglements had occurred.  Strange bedfellows and all that.
“I love you, Harry,” Draco murmured softly, letting his hands wander up Harry’s thighs on either side of him.
Bleary-eyed, she looked up to find Harry waiting in the doorway in a gray bathrobe.  “What happened?” he whispered, looking over his shoulder as Ron stirred and yawned demonstrably.
“No, surprisingly.”  Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed.  “Later,” he whispered.  His finger and thumb pressed against his eyes, and Harry suspected he was hiding tears.  “I cheated on him, Harry.  Spectacularly.”
Janine reminded her of a subdued, Muggle Pansy Parkinson.  Her dark eyebrows were just as pointed, but rose in good humor rather than quirking in sarcasm.  Scarlet lips frequently spread wide in a toothy grin, never pursed in wry disdain.
Ron smiled softly watching him.  It was the happiest he’d seen his best friend in… ever, really.  A snort came from the bedroom, followed by a shriek, and Ron barked a laugh.  Damned if they weren’t kind of cute together.
The letters faded, and he pursed his lips.  “I’m Malfoy’s new… Auror nanny?  Robards foisted his parole oversight and case on me.  The bracelet reports ward crossings.”
“Hmmm,” he hummed, lips pressed firmly against her.  She bucked and groaned at the sensation, and he grinned.  “I think it would serve you right, you know…”
His gaze kept wandering to linger on Harry, and it was making him nervous.  In fact, he’d been staring at him quite a bit since he’d started looking tipsy.
Draco’s chin digs into Harry’s shoulder. “If you add a little sugar and let it rise again, it might be worth eating.” Draco presses his lips into Harry’s shirt and sighs. “I’ll see you next Thursday.”
,” Draco whispered as Ursella caught up to Felix.  She was halfway to the train before Draco tried to repeat what they both expected him to say.  “Home-  Home by-”  He sniffled and gave up.
Harry doesn’t laugh. He doesn’t. He really, really doesn’t. Until he does, and he buries his face in Draco’s jumper to smother the guffaws that won’t stop coming.
Ron skidded around the curve, mind anywhere but on the road.  Straightening the car out, he nodded to Malfoy in the mirror.
Rough, tanned hands skimmed thumbs back and forth over the velvet next to his legs, and he watched them with trepidation.
“To be fair,” Draco croaked.  “I thought you meant tie, like dress code.  Not Thai, like… this.  I was prepared to wear a restaurant loaner jacket.”
They’d intercepted over a dozen owls with hexes on the way across the bay, but at least he’d thought he was coming to her rescue. She didn’t need a white knight. She wanted a fucking gigolo.
“I suspect you spent the morning being distracted by a chair.” Draco rolled over to face him, winding an arm across his waist and up Harry’s back. “And that is dangerously close to engaging in
“Potter, we’ve got a wizard in Muggle police custody in Devon.  What do you want to do about it?”  Adams asked, chucking a stapled packet of papers on his desk unceremoniously.
He rose up to catch her lips, and she balked.  Rejection coiled, molten, in his gut.  The humor in his eyes evaporated, and she cringed.
“I was creative, at least.” Draco laced his fingers between the man’s and wiggled his wedding ring as the humor dissipated. “Tell me a story about you. Just you. Not me.”
“Once upon a time, the lying Auror said he wanted to spend Christmas in Spain, so the other Auror made plans, but when he got there, the lying Auror was nowhere to be found. And then, the lying Auror did what he always did, and reported in at the end of his leave and pretended everything was fine.”
“Summary of Pending Actions” grabbed his attention.  “Charges awaiting trial, pending statute clarification by Wizengamot Committee on Wizard Rights.  Scheduled September 30th, 2007.”
“Beer would be much appreciated if you have any, Potter,” Draco said over his shoulder.  Too softly, Harry thought.  He was too quiet when he asked for things.
The ledgers thunk down on Harry’s worktable, and sawdust puffs out in a cloud, some of which ends up in Harry’s mouth. Redwood smells better than it tastes, he concludes, scrubbing his tongue on his equally-sawdusty t-shirt collar.
Harry hummed as he chewed. “My new tent smelled like hot plastic for the first year, and it still gets a weird stink to it in the sun.”
That was nothing to sniff at.  Especially not when the Ministry itself had seen fit to track her down for an internship.  A rather well-paid internship, she reminded herself.  And they were paying her way through Cardiff University’s law program.  Not a bad deal, at all.
He sighed, deep and… done.  His body sank into the mattress in a way that made him wonder if he’d ever fully put his weight on it before.  As if he’d always held tension against it, and had just now truly lain on it.  He sighed again and hummed, low and content.
She looked away from him.  His piercing gaze was too close now that he’d drifted toward personal attack. She was willing to consider that her methodology was flawed, but mockery wasn’t helpful.
She bit her lip and hooked her thumbs under the sides of her knickers, slipping them down the first few inches.  Ron never looked away from her face.  She felt Harry fidget on the couch behind her.
He smiled, gently holding her head.  “I missed you.” He gave her a peck on the forehead, and let her go.
“Confidentially, he made Mum’s pot pie…”  Ron said, leaning in with a furtive glance toward the kitchen windows, “…better.”
If Connie, Hermione, and McGonagall ever found themselves in a room alone together, he wasn’t sure what would happen, but it would be something wonderful that changed the course of wizard history.  And that idea made him
“My, how the tables have turned, Weasley,” he hissed sarcastically, still clutching a handful of silverware.  “
They reached a crosswalk, and Draco stifled the urge to put his arm around the man’s waist, or loop it through his arm, and settled for stuffing his hands in his pockets.
”  Confused, he watched her gingerly slip her fingers in her jacket, only to come out with a mess of red petals. “Please tell me there’s no secret meaning to this?”
“Candy from strangers?” Draco teased.  He was met with silence and insistently-glowing orbs.  The blur narrowed.  Turning sideways, perhaps?
The walk from the public Floo to the station had taken up a fair chunk of his morning already.  He hadn’t actually read the report beyond the location until he arrived.
“I didn’t bring anything with me.  Well, other than,” she gestured with her now-clean fingers, “that stuff.  And I’m not leaving without this lecture, now that I know about it.  And I want to know why you’re so familiar with the nearly dead.”
He was going to come all over this dildo and watch Draco fuck himself with it.  He was going to watch Draco Malfoy shove his come up his ass and Draco would
The person in the hall knocked a second time, more firmly.  If he opened the door a crack, they wouldn’t be able to see Malfoy, he reasoned.  But he wasn’t sure at what point the other man would pull his head out of the Pensieve.  He couldn’t hold his breath all that much longer.
It was a stretch for them to torture their own war heroine to set him a trap.  They’d really have gone off the deep end.  But if Granger could stomach being a rogue anything, he’d eat his wand.  If and when the Ministry let him have one.
A smoldering towel burns through and falls from the towel rack, and Harry draws a deep breath and averts his gaze from the swollen splendor of Draco’s erection.
“And risk throwing the entire city of London into eternal darkness?” Draco rocks the sweet potato on the counter, tapping one end. “Very selfish.”
” he murmured.  Draco’s thumb traced Harry’s jawline, up to his cheekbone, and his eyes drifted shut.  “
And it was very happy and rubbing its purring orange head all over her rucksack.  She might as well have packed the bag with catnip, she thought.  Crookshanks was throwing himself on the bag with the kind of reckless abandon only feline substance abuse could warrant.
“How long have you lived here?” she asked, still stroking small circles with her thumbs, noting a growing erection behind the thin fabric of the shorts.
Malfoy shook his head, disappointed in his fellow menfolk. For as much as they likely built their lives around fucking, they didn’t seem to understand some basic biology.
He nodded for emphasis to Narcissa on the townhouses and her face fell.  Those had been her favorites.
He pulled Draco against his chest and sighed. He was quiet for several breaths. “Okay. So, four or five years ago, you had a pet lizard. I don’t remember what kind. But you named him Butterfingers.”
“I fucking love it.” Harry bites his lip and watches the clouds drift across the sky through the humid haze on the glass ceiling. “I love that you take what you want, and that
A grin spread across his face as he slipped a hand in his pocket for his knife. It would be an absolutely minuscule Healing, as far as they went. All the intricacy of making a sandwich, compared to the laborious coronation feast that was knitting one Ronald Weasley back together.
A tuft of white fur peeks out from behind one of the orchids. It’s too perfectly white to be Draco, and Harry wanders over to examine it. Harry snorts a laugh at the sight before him; the fur cape lays in a pile made of every bloody t-shirt Harry owns. A fur-lined nest that smells like Harry.
“No.” Draco sets the sweet potato on the counter and spins it. “Well, in part. The cottage was small to begin with. Tiny, really.”
Fingers gripped his lower thigh, tugging his knee up, and he let the hand raise his knee and set it back down onto something soft.  The hand, Hermione’s hand by the feel of it, did the same on the other side.  His anxiety abated slightly.
Both men’s ears perked up at the promise of juicy gossip.  “Ginny retired last year, so none for me.”
Harry levitated a wooden crate up out of the water in the corner of the spring, and dispelled the Bubblehead charm from around it.  It drifted above his head, and he sent it to settle on the dining table.
“Fuck the money,” Eric says with a derisive laugh. “You can keep your goddamn Galleons. I’m done. Sort the payment out with my lawyer.”
What if Narcissa had been able to send Liore to another family?  What if he had an older sister?  What if they’d met at Hogwarts?  What if they’d been sorted into the same House?
The envelope bursts into flames before Harry realizes he’s even raised his hand, let alone cast a spell.
Harry had never wished for someone to firebomb his locale before.  It had happened, sure.  Auror life being what it is.  But he’d never actively
“Me, too.  If it’s any consolation.”  Draco’s eyes glistened, and his throat worked to swallow down a sob.
“I wish I could say I was surprised.” The knife slid through the cake, halving each slice. “You know what Ron asked me the night before our wedding?”
Silently, he was grateful she’d anchored the footstool.  The urge to lean back and offer his hips up to Harry was overwhelming.  Doing so would have resulted in a probation-violating naked tangle.
Ron grinned, “I don’t know what they’re feeding them in Perth, but fit and ferocious, mate.” He shook his head, trying to clear the sound of her moans from his ears.
my body screams, but only I can hear it.  My arms give out, and I bury my face in the pillow as he moves in long, slow strokes.  Each pass makes my cock jerk, and I’m so fucking hard it’s torture.  But if I touch myself, I’ll come, he’ll come, and we’re done.
“Fourteen years.  I think.  Dammit, Potter.”  Draco drew a deep breath in through his nose, and sighed through pursed lips.   “It involves children.  Do you really want to know?”
Draco was too quiet, and Harry wondered if he should have just nagged Hermione again to get his post.  London simply wasn’t very Draco-friendly.  He’d let out a startled squeak when an ambulance drove by, flinched as Harry’s neighbor’s door slammed shut, and slunk behind Harry down to his post box and back without so much as a word.
He knew what she was trying to accomplish, and it had nothing to do with artfully-laid body hair.  Thankfully, his body wasn’t responding this time.  Might have something to do with him allowing her to give him an awkward, toothy blowjob last time.
Jealousy is for school yards.  I am an avenging demon who knows only high ground but will fight you in the gutter.  He laces his fingers under the back of his head, as if I can’t sink claws between his ribs and rip his heart out in shreds.
He rounded the sofa and sat on Draco’s feet, which earned him a half-hearted kick to the thigh.  His knee bounced excitedly as his hands went to work weaving a tale of professional espionage.
Slowly, he set it between his teeth, and Harry shuddered.  The memories of Draco getting his teeth knocked out on multiple occasions were too fresh. Grey eyes pinned him curiously.  He didn’t think Malfoy used the bond as much as he did, but maybe he was wrong.
Draco takes another oyster off the plate of crushed ice and tips it into his mouth, leaning back on an elbow in the sand.  Harry watches the cold mass slick itself through Draco’s lips and tries to not gag.  Draco examines the shell while he chews for what seems like a preposterous amount of time, and flings it into the sea.
With a flick, the paper spun through the air straight toward Draco’s face.  Inconsiderate, he thought as he snatched it midair.  Once a Seeker, always a Seeker.
“And the other…” Cassandra scoffed, leaning back in her chair.  “Or is it others?  Plural?”  Her eyes narrowed in accusation.
Ignoring her, he continued, coming to kneel between her thighs, hands firmly holding her hips down.  “You know about it in advance.  You may even know the menu.  And you starve all day in that anticipation.”
He’d gotten, at most, three hours of sleep the previous night, thanks to Potter’s existence in his home.  The man had rolled off the couch not once, not twice, but thrice.  He’d never once stuck the landing gracefully, and the resulting grumbles had repeatedly startled Draco awake.
Her mind conjured the memory of her otter while she tried to press the light to the size of the small creature.  It refused to condense, but took the correct form.
“Circe’s slit, Harry,” Draco pants, eyes glistening. He swipes his thumb over Harry’s forehead and leaves a smear of lube behind.
Draco gagged on the smell as he closed the door behind them, but the man pulled his wand out, and the air rushed out and back into the room through invisible windows. Under the real windows sat dead houseplants, the most vibrant thing about them the cigarette butts piled on the dry soil.
“Mm hm,” he hummed, sliding into a soft moan as she crooked her finger up against his prostate.  “Quick learner…”
A bedroom, most likely. Draco’s bedroom. Something scratches against the door, an uncoordinated, hasty sound, and he hesitates before turning the knob. It could be anything. A dragon, a Wampus Cat, or-
“Well, I’ll be a griffin’s gonads!” Hagrid says, sloshing stout over the side of his massive mug. “I can maybe getcha some bread.”
“I hadn’t expected dinner, but it smells wonderful.” He leaned down to kiss her cheeks in greeting, but his hands snuck around her waist and pulled her in. With a soft hum, she buried her face in his chest. Scents of teakwood mixed with browned butter and coffee made her breath shudder in.
Annoyance flitted across his features.  “I know, Granger.  You’ve made it abundantly clear,” he said tersely.  “And I’ve made it just as clear that you
Harry disappeared between the bookshelves, and Draco drew in a long breath before turning to Ron. “Bring the Griffin to the north edge of the wards at sunset. They’ll take him from there.”
Draco was absolutely having an existential crisis instead of a nap, and it was decidedly not restful.  The noon sun was usually enough to make him nod off, but today, sprawling in bed and contemplating his overall reason for living won out.
“Harry?” Draco sat up and mirrored his position, grey eyes gleaming. “What did you get me?” His lip caught between his teeth as a grin spread and he fought an excited bounce.
Harry fumbles a margarita to his mouth, but it doesn’t put out the bloody fire in his mouth, just vaporizes it up into his nose. He coughs into a napkin and breathes, open-mouthed and sweating.
, Draco thought.  He’d been afraid of rejection through this whole dance.  The awkward preceding days, the tense last weeks, the contention of their youth.
“Mrs. Weas-” he started, but caught her scowl.  “Molly.  I’m aware of what kind of person Narcissa Malfoy is.  Keenly aware.”
Hermione stopped, gaze flitting back and forth between them, absolutely baffled by Draco’s anger and Harry terror-stricken face.
“Ministry’s finest,” Burgock snorted, setting a small, white cardboard box and a business envelope on the table.
He shuddered, his fingers moved, and his body came undone in one sudden burst.  Hot slickness erupted across his hand, and his hips thrust up in response.  Groaning, he finally gave in, gripped his cock tightly, and milked the last few drops out.
The field was an absolute battlefield of man versus earth.  Heaps of soil and piles of rubble littered the plain.  Several immense pits gouged the landscape.  Dread crept through him as he scanned.  What the fuck had happened here?
“Cardiff Public Floo?  It’s about a twenty-minute walk.”  She shoved her feet in her jeans, eager to get away from Arthur’s uvular symphony.
Harry belted a laugh and snuggled down under the duvet, wrapping it around his shoulders.  “All the dirty pictures and videos on my mobile are of blond men.  Guess we both have a certain type, huh?”
Ron opened the door to let the steam out and tried to summarize.  “It’s the original Dark Art.  And it’s unTraceable.  So like, if you can figure it out, you can get away with a lot of shady shit.”
Harry uncrosses his arms and grips the edge of the counter behind him, and he expects Draco to close the small distance between them, but Draco’s teeth scrape against his lower lip, leaving lines in his lipstick. He glances around the countertop, eyes settling on a roll of paper towels. Draco rips one off the roll, folds it in half, and brings it to his mouth.
“Oh, yes, dear,” Molly replied, moving on to the next recipe.  “Draco dropped off a rather… intoxicated and talkative Harry a few nights ago.”
“I think we’ll make do.” Draco’s arm dangles off the bed, and it jerks, followed by a sly grin from Draco. “First things first. Why does
Cool skin slid over his own hand, and he yelped, room coming back in to focus.  Furious grey eyes scrutinized him, scowling.
Nothing.  Not even a grunt.  Harry’s fingers threaded through salt-roughened blond hair.  He’d stopped sweating that morning, but was still hot to the touch.
, Harry mouthed when Basilia’s back was turned.  Connie’s eyebrows rose in questioning.  She looked more than willing to throw another handsy witch out on the curb.
She scratched Crookshanks under his chin, much to his enjoyment.  “He won’t let us in the wards if he doesn’t want us there.”
Hermione caught Harry’s eye with a questioning smirk from the other side of the futon.  He licked his lips and let his fingers slip lower, just shy of Draco’s inner thigh.  With a wicked grin, Hermione crawled across the middle of the futon, nose to nose with Draco, who still bent over, silverware in his hands.
Harry realizes that when someone loves you, you can just ASK them for stuff.  Yes, Harry, even SEX STUFF.
Warm hands skimmed up to the crests of his pelvis, firm fingertips prodding and assessing more than teasing or enticing.  The satin tugged maddeningly against the leaking tip of his cock with every small movement.
With that in mind, Harry closed his eyes and reached for the luminous blue box Falk had left in his mind.  Briefly, he wondered if he should view this one in private, too.  Vanishing his pants and trousers had been a bit of a humbling experience.  But his office was private enough.
Ron wads a napkin up and throws it at Seamus, and Harry can’t help but wonder why Ron still comes to pub nights when he has a wife he loves. He could be at home with Hermione, cuddling on the sofa whilst she reads a book. Why bother sitting at this sticky table at the Leaky?
An empty tray sat next to the soap dispenser, and he wondered if the man took his ring off and put it there when he showered. Had he slipped it off his finger before he cupped himself with that hand? Did he think of Draco when he did? Or this lost husband?
Ron stepped out of the Burrow Floo, still picking Quintaped hairs off his t-shirt.  That thing was going to be the focus of all of his nightmares for the next year.  Bloody terrifying creatures, they were.  Like a starfish, king crab, and gorilla had a very fertile three-way.
Softly, Hermione opened the door to the tiny bathroom on the third floor, slipped inside, and immediately regretted it.  Quiet sobs came from behind the shower curtain.  Seizing the opportunity, she took his wand off the sink and set it on the floor behind the toilet, just in case this went exceptionally poorly.
He finished his announcement with more condescension than Harry had expected, and it was perfect.  Harry nodded in approval.
His new life goal had just become riding the gorgeous shining length till he came on top of it.  His breath hissed in at the thought of stretching around the slick shaft and sinking it in to the hilt.  Size for the sake of size hadn’t especially appealed to him, but this was sex and art and showmanship.  All of which he
“You said to tell you what I want…”  Draco sank down on the dildo, and the skin under Harry’s hand rose against his fingers.  “This is what I want, Harry.”
At 5:15, coffee and Daily Prophet in hand, he rounded the corner in the DMLE section to find Robards’ office wide open.  A rectangle of light graced the hallway floor like a welcome mat.  Or a trap door, he thought.
Draco’s finger glides down to Harry’s entrance. He clutches Draco and moans; guttural and greedy. “Please.”
What the fuck did I actually ask him?  What goddamn words came out of my mouth?  That he loves her?  That he loves Ron?  That they knew?
Harry lay on his side with the Kneazle purring contentedly in a crescent around his head like a ginger clown wig.  One tanned arm was thrown across Hermione’s waist, fingers brushing Draco.
Draco pulled his t-shirt up and almost off. He stopped and pretended to get his chin caught on the neckline, head still inside the shirt. Through the thin fabric, he watched the man’s tongue dart out to lick his lips as his eyes roved down Draco’s chest.
She yawned, her own eyes closing.  She’d have to ask him if her memories acted like fish.  He’d like catching them, maybe.
He threw an arm across Draco’s chest and rested his head on his shoulder.  On his own sweatshirt, which was getting less weird.  His cock pressed against the warm satin on Draco’s hip, and he ground against him with a soft moan.
Neve turned to regard him out of the corner of her eye as she poured the kettle, eyebrow raised.  She smirked at his discomfort and turned away.
His mum was trying to not watch him go and failing.  She pretended to putter in the kitchen, but her ear turned toward the Floo as he approached it.
He considered standing in a shallower part of the spring so she could watch him, but decided against riling her up.  She looked like she was barely awake.
orchestrate this whole house arrest situation, watch Draco from the shadows in the middle of the night, and then crucify himself on his own misinterpretations?
Gods, she felt good.  He’d gotten so used to only being touched through fabric, that he’d nearly forgotten what skin felt like.  Her tongue flicked out to lick his nipple, and he groaned.
Security inside the bank was guaranteed.  It was probably the only place he’d feel safe from assassination attempts, really.  Transportation was the real issue, but maybe he could work something out with Potter.
The Gringotts lobby reeked of acrid molten gold thanks to an enchanted fountain.  As much as he wanted to dip something to keep as a souvenir, as others were doing; he very much wanted to keep his fingers.  He also wasn’t entirely sure he wouldn’t get shoved into the bubbling smelting pot.
What if Harry asked him to give her up? Was he willing to give up a handful of visits a year for Harry in his bed every night? Seemed an easy trade. But would he ever stop resenting Harry for forcing him to make that choice?
His hips stuttered, vice-like grip on her wrists holding tight. He cried out and gave one final deep thrust.
He ambled through the living room, tapped each of the three dildos on the head in greeting as he passed, and started a pot of coffee.  The Kneazle followed him, chirruping a salutation, likely in hopes of a treat.
any corpses on that property,” Harry said candidly.  “Sure would be a shame if we couldn’t find Liore but had to let Lucius rot in Azkaban while we investigated all those other bodies.”
Sitting up against it, he inspected the clutter on either side of his shoulders:  Books in various stages of progress, his small blade for highly-dubious magic, his glasses, journals, pens, a jar of India ink, three sketch books, two half-consumed cups of tea, shiny rocks, shells, sea glass, candles, matches, and a few pearls.
The conditions of conditional love; candy coating on a poisoned apple.  Eventually, one grows to fear sweetness.
Harry crossed the room to inelegantly smash his face against Draco’s shoulder blade.  His arms snuck around Draco’s waist, pulling him in tightly.
His breath hissed in as she started stroking.  The woman was insatiable, and it was glorious.  She’d been rather amorous last month, but that was nothing compared to
“Alright,” the man said, brushing crumbs from his hands onto the side of the plate of toast. “Well, when they’re together like that, it’s not medic, and it’s not captain, it’s…”
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
Harry takes his outstretched hand and worries he’s going to break Draco’s skeletal fingers. He’s too light as Harry pulls him to his feet; as if he’s merely righting a kitchen chair or propping an umbrella in a corner.
A truck rumbled by, and he wondered if it was better for the potholes to have the asphalt crushed into them than gently tapped in. Probably not.
He took a few tentative strides into the room and inspected a vanity.  Delicately-carved ebony topped by… a pane of clear glass?  Glancing around, he noticed that every mirror was completely transparent.
“Earth to Wizengaswot…” Harry sang as he brought their hands up to his lips and grazed them along Draco’s knuckles, eyes intent on Hermione.  “
The fibres fan out over the towel as he presses, kneads, and presses again. A wide-tooth comb makes quick work of the tangles, and he wonders what Draco’s fur looks like when it’s wet. The strands will need to be woven and secured, so they need to stay pliable and damp, and he’ll have to come up with an adhesive base that won’t cause a reaction. Monkey puzzle resin is the most logical choice, but he’s out of branches.
Harry had unwittingly, as usual, chosen the worst possible day to proposition Malfoy.  Ron doubted Malfoy had told Harry about the whole adoption situation, what with a possible smuggling adventure in their near future.
Draco lay on his back and snapped the skirt wide, draping it over himself in invitation.  It was an enormous piece of fabric, Harry thought.  Practically a tablecloth.  Harry inhaled deeply and swallowed a sudden rush of saliva.
“And I want this hand,” she took his left hand, skimming it up and around to cup her left breast through her shirt. “Here.”
I could never do that to a child, but that’s a moot point.  I let the bitter smile creep across my face in the dark.  No matter how often we go through the motions, children will never befall two wizards.  What a cruel twist of natural selection, in that it hasn’t selected me.
It smelled amazing, and felt like enough food for a party. Granger’s phrasing came back to mind, and he wondered what he was heading into. A set of blue lace panties, with any luck, he mused.
Blinking away tears, a form took shape.  It was a fucking Patronus.  And a damned solid one, at that.  It floated on its back, seeming to enjoy his bewilderment.
Draco leaned back on his hands, still perched on the edge of the table.  He stared vacantly over Harry’s shoulder, and Harry waited.
Gods, he was as heartbreakingly beautiful as he’d always been.  The mist collected on the tips of his eyelashes, reflecting gray sunlight in stark contrast to his black irises.  The muscles in his jaw worked quietly, gum always present.  A fine coating of droplets dusted his dark hair, begging to be wiped off.
So, if he was interpreting this correctly, after this Committee decision, Lucius either would or wouldn’t be prosecuted for hundreds of additional crimes?  No wonder Malfoy’s file was in Robards’ office.  It probably took up an entire wall.
Hands skimmed up his chest and flicked his nipples.  She shot him a wicked grin and let her weight drop onto his hips, pulling a low groan and thrust from him.
“I didn’t know who to ask, because what am I going to do, go to Hogwarts and ask Snape’s painting? No. Terrible. For a lot of reasons. But the cinema down the block was showing an old movie about a godfather, so I took the afternoon off-“
“Granger!” Draco's voice echoed slightly through the rooms.  “Damn you, Granger, you’d better keep your sticky mitts out of those muffins!”
The door clicked, ruining his reverie.  Narcissa entered, Lucius on her heels.  The guards exchanged bored glances and a set of keys while his parents… no… The Malfoys settled themselves into horrible plebeian office chairs.
Harry had very vaguely warned her to expect Malfoy and Ron to be out of commission today, and it looked like he was correct.
He’d realized after the first few months of his sentence that he could probably melt the walls and fly away.  But then he’d be on the run for the rest of his life.  Another ten months in a cell had been the better choice.  Probably.
Harry could leave. He could stay at the bar. Or he could follow Malfoy. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s had sex in that lavatory. It’s not his preference, but it’s a quick answer to a too-big problem.
With that tidbit, she decided she was officially more interested in the Legilimency than the dream itself.  Why hadn’t they learned multiple methodologies in school?  Probably because it worked in places where the Ministry had warded against magic, she figured.  Curtailing their education again.
“Fuck,” the man sighed. He was close enough to touch, but unlikely to appreciate it. “You know, maybe that’s intentional. Maybe you threw yourself in front of that curse because you couldn’t live with it anymore.”
“Oh,” he exclaimed softly.  “I… congrats?”  She whistled softly as he took the small note off of her leg.  She made no move to bite him.  Highly unusual
The Ministry knowing Malfoy’s whereabouts was certainly news to him, even as a more senior Auror.  Harry nodded Malfoy into the room and closed the door behind him. This wouldn’t be a great way for Hermione to meet her neighbors. “I was betting against Hermione being able to find you,” he half-lied.
Hermione clicked the vibrator off and gave her clit a few last cursory rubs with the stilled silicon toy.   Her core tightened around the length of the other toy inside her as she moved, slowly drawing it out.  Her body quivered as the head of it withdrew to her entrance, but relinquished its grasp.
was better.  Better-served, too, he thought as he examined the mugs.  Nicer than the dumb, trendy blown-glass pair at his flat that had to be handled like… well, like glass.  His stupid flat.  His stupid, empty, boring, flat that he’d have to return to in two weeks.
Plenty of women had worn lingerie when they wooed him, but none had so effectively wielded it.  But they’d worn it as a passive enticement.  To play dress-up.  To fit the role. Just a decoration.
“Fill in the blanks, Granger.  You’re good at tests,” he announced.  “During the Second Wizarding War and his subsequent Ministry evasion, Draco Malfoy attained the status of
His fingertips trailed back down to her core, testing the swollen flesh.  In response, her hips stuttered and stilled, her body tensing.  He slicked his tongue up her clit, and she moaned, but she still didn’t thrust her hips down against his waiting fingers.
Draco’s brow furrows, and Harry opens his mouth to ask what’s wrong, but Draco turns and clicks his tongue. A thump and a skitter of nails on the floorboards comes from the living room, and the greyhound lopes into the room and climbs on the bed, head held low.
Hermione felt her face fall in shock.  She’d had this conversation with several Wizengamot committee members and other Ministry employees.  Never any Muggles, though.
Dove-grey eyes focused on the mug in front of Harry, still avoiding his gaze.  Harry wished Draco would just yell at him.  The suspense was awful.
Nimble fingers plucked a truffle from the box in front of Harry, and he followed their movement.  Draco brought the gold-streaked cube up to his lips, eyes on the Wizengamot.  He ran the bottom of the candy over his bottom lip and his tongue darted out to take in the pattern on the underside.
Her shoulders shook, and he assumed she was crying.  Legilimency could illuminate the situation wonderfully, but she’d fucking flay him alive if he tried it now.  The kettle whistled while he chose his words carefully, knowing she certainly had another tirade at the ready.
“I saw the headlines, Harry.”  She busied herself switching lenses.  “It would sure suck if Robards sent you back here for a full shoot.”
She didn’t answer, merely parted her lips, hesitated, and wetted them.  Ron’s palm clapped over her sex with a soft smack, and Harry’s cock twitched at the sound.  Hermione whimpered eagerly, and Ron smiled softly.  “She only came twice, Harry.  Better try harder.”
this man?  How could he shove Malfoy’s memory into someone else’s head without breaking their barriers?
through Molly to focus on that blanket she gave Narcissa.  She said she used charmed needles to do all the work, so with several dozen witches and a couple wizards who knit, we might be able to find it.
Lucius had been escorted out after the first few memories.  Several very nice hexes slipped past the guards as Draco’s memories played, and Codger had announced Lucius was being removed for his own safety.  Pity, she’d thought.  She should have gotten a stinging hex in while she could.
“Hey,” he muttered, running hands through his chaotic snarl of hair, “I heard a crash and then it got really quiet… So I… You broke shit already, ‘Mione?”
There’s a pile of clothes in front of my feet, and my soul and soles hurt from running.  The bed is soft when I sit next to him.
He huffed a laugh.  “It won’t.  You really will need a bigger table.”  He stopped to scratch his beard.  “Mum, you need a
The parolee line took a single step forward, and he died a little inside.  They were so damned close, but they couldn’t hear him at all.
Ron pulled his pants up and winced. Bit sensitive, he had to admit. Bit impressed with himself, though.
Narcissa tented her hands over her mouth, stifling her squeal.  “Oh, no, Lucy, I think Pansy would like the fire opal set my grandparents wore.”  She snatched the pen from him and slammed a magical signature onto the paper without consulting the guards.
He’s been hard too long already, and heavy heat builds in his groin as he moves in quick, hard strokes. Draco moans and presses Harry’s fingers against his lips. A slick, wet tongue slips between Harry’s fingers, and the tension breaks.
“I need… to know how to get semen out of satin. For later,” he mumbled drowsily, briefly considering asking her to stay, but immediately squashed it down.  Once bitten, he thought.
Ron scratched at the coating of rock dust on the back of a hand while he waited for the resident Seer to make his proclamation.  He wasn’t sure why he was nervous about showing the ring to Draco.  Maybe it was the name he’d thrown out,
“I wasn’t waving at the Chief Warlock, mum,” Ron whispered back.  “But his name is seriously Codger?”
“Malfoy, you nosy mother fucker,” she hissed, seething as she sat up.  “Didn’t know you were a Legilimens.  Hell of a way to find out.”
He grinned and put his fingertips to her head.  “It’ll feel cold in the corners of your eyes, but it won’t hurt,” he said in warning.
Ron shrugged and accepted plates from Draco, setting them on the corners of the futon.  “Want the blood for wards?”
Harry snorted a laugh and wrapped a hand around his cock, relieved by both the familiarity and pleasure of it.
An examination by Aurors at the scene had detected no magical cause for the man’s death, and the case was shelved in the UK months ago.
Adams nodded sternly, and Harry watched him, confused.  Adams was never serious.  Adams was an absolute fuckwit with little regard for professional behavior.  Why did he act like he’d chugged a pint of Sober-Up after being handed bodyguard duty?
“Why the fuck are my hands glued to a footstool?” he asked with an annoyed scoff.  “You know I can’t use magic away from home.”
A hot flush rises up Harry’s neck, and his hands wrap around Draco’s hips to knead his arse. “Uhm, something wandless,” he says, clearing his throat. “Don’t bring your wand into it just yet.”
Harry moaned as her fingertips guided him into her slick heat, but his hips stuttered, torn between thrusting into her, and driving himself back on to Draco.
He rolled off the ledge and made for the ladder.  Not sure if he was annoyed or elated, he settled on mild trepidation.
The door slammed open against the wall, and Narcissa rolled into the room like a storm front.  Lucius trailed behind her, lips tight, expression grim.  Dread clenched Draco’s gut.
fault she was crying on her bathroom floor waiting for a timer to beep.  Draco Fucking Malfoy’s fault, all of it.
, Harry,” he whispered against the other man’s lips, hips tilting forward subtly.  A needy whine trickled from Draco’s nose even as he clutched Harry close.
“Might I invite you to spend the night?” Draco holds Harry’s face, cheeks mushed against Draco’s palms.
Draco’s teeth dig into his lip, as if they can stop his spreading grin. “I simply value plant life too much to eat them. Carnivorism fights deforestation by ridding the earth of dangerous herbivores.”
The bathroom doorway filled with a gaudy American flag like a piped icing sugar cookie. A red, white, and blue comedic rendering. The man, very obviously a Bludger by the size of him, stepped inside.
“Medic,” Draco said, and took another long sip of tea. The man nodded and waited. Crossed wands had to mean combat. And the more of them, the higher the rank. “Some sort of… leader?”
“Yes, thank you.”  Metaxas’ hands patted his plaid suit jacket down for lack of a better purpose.  “The ICW travel sanction also applies to your Quidditch teams.  The British and Irish League will not be eligible for international matches or the Quidditch World Cup.  Not as participants, and certainly not as hosts.  Not until this… mess… is cleaned up.”
His weight lifts, and I can breathe, but I hide my face in the pillow.  He won’t make me look at him for this, because he knows me better than that.  Hard fingers wrap around my hips and he pulls me to my hands and knees, taking what he knows I want him to.
Ron was building him a home, and Harry and Hermione would protect it, and they’d fill it with children.  Children, and magic, and music, and food, and love.
The click of nails over the floor draws a smile from him, and a little foxy growl turns it into a smirk. Harry slides to the edge of the mattress and stands to peek between the ferns. He adjusts his boxers and considers getting dressed, but then he notices the pile of Draco’s clothing in the kitchen. A row of orchids near a wall of windows shudders as something brushes along them, running away from Harry.
For the second time that morning, Harry was aghast at Malfoy’s propensity for getting royally fucked over by wizards who were supposed to be guarding him.
Draco took a long breath, pen tapping against the notebook.  He’d said it like he was retelling teenage hijinks.  “And
The fingers in his hair tighten, and Draco thrusts into Harry’s mouth in quicker and quicker strokes. Harry’s hand around his own length keeps pace, growing slick against his palm as he tastes salt on his tongue.
The naked Goblin on the table was chanting something that was definitely in a different language.  Several others joined him in the chant.
He wanted to ask how Falk knew his mobile number, or that he was one of the few wizards who owned one, but answered his own question when he felt Falk’s amusement.  It seemed like an unusually fitting way to communicate with him.
She hadn’t actually expected him to receive her message, let alone show up and  tongue-fuck a damned ice cream cone.  Luna’s introduction would have been the better route.
Draco’s silence amplified the slick squelch of soap between Harry’s legs as he brusquely washed himself.
“Depends,” he said, washing a bite down with the tart tea and a smack of lips, “on whether a Wizengamot committee decides my upbringing should be considered a criminal offense.  Many criminal offenses.  For both of them.”
“Oh, and I’ve been bedding the Mudblood,” he said with an internal cringe.  “But don’t worry, there won’t be any children.  Ever.  With anyone.”  Standing to leave, Draco brushed off his black-on-black trousers and shirt.  It was going to be nice to not have to wear them so often.
Harry’s lips found Draco’s nipple, and gave it a hesitant nip. A warm, wet tongue lapped over the sensitive skin and pulled a surprised gasp from Draco, along with the realization that Harry still had years of memories, and he had only a few.
“I…” Draco started, no intention of finishing the sentence.  At least Molly had given him cake when she pinned him into this corner.
Harry grinned and rested his elbows on the table across from Draco.  Intent green eyes watched him.  “The twins?”
Maybe Ron was at the Burrow, and she could pop in and see him.  Probably get a real dinner, too.  If Bill and Percy weren’t moved into their houses yet, there might be some secluded beds to test.
Harry followed his gaze out the window, squinting in the early morning light as pieces fell into place.  Falk’s words came back to him in a rush:
Merlin, she patently didn’t want to ask him anymore.  But she couldn’t just tell him to disregard her reaching out, either.  Nor could she think of another excuse.
“I don’t think so.  The Mungo’s Healer already verified a death by natural causes, so it’s pretty cut and dried.  Not as much paperwork as deaths in the field.”
“Yeah, I guess.  But like, we’ve just been divvying them up kind of randomly, and this one is important.”  Adams bit his lip and looked down, cocky facade cracking slightly.  “And most of us don’t know a Muggle prison from a Muggle dungeon, if you catch my drift.”
“Oh! Yes. I-“ Draco blows out a long breath and bites his bottom lip. “They’re not earrings. They’re Hearrings. The Gringotts Goblins use them for audio surveillance. Or snooping. Sometimes insider trading. One time, murd-”
“It’s fine,” Harry muttered.  And it was, he thought to himself.  He’d had sex in front of Ron plenty of times before Hermione had returned home.
” Harry said incredulously.  He bit into a small red pepper, and Draco winced.  “Durmstrang is in the middle of nowhere.  No way did you have electricity.  Let alone Internet access.”
I spent that night at Pansy’s.  I didn’t bother asking him about surrogacy.  Ironically, Granger was the first womb on legs that came to mind.  We were friends back then, she and I.  But I didn’t ask him.  I couldn’t handle hearing him turn me down again.   Just one child.  It’s not so much to ask, is it?
Crookshanks chirruped a greeting from the balcony overlooking the downstairs. Draco tilted his head back to examine the room.  It had become enormous.  Empty.
“One way to shut that mouth up, hm?”  Draco’s arms wrap around Harry’s chest, and he sighs, content.
Soft, glossy fur rubs against his thighs. Draco’s mouth surrounds his cock; a hot, wet, too-good embrace. Draco’s hands pin his hips to the bed, and Harry moans at each pass of Draco’s mouth; body writhing as he tries to move.
Eyebrows raised in recognition, Harry watched Malfoy’s fingers experimentally pluck at the strings, launching into a few measures, then testing again.  It was nearly identical to the movements his fingers had made as he used Blood Magic on Ron.
He hummed in agreement and thought of Hermione’s wet pussy, but startled when a warm hand wrapped around his length and
Draco stood in the doorway holding a mug of coffee.   His eyes were red-rimmed, but heat filled his gaze as he took them in.  Harry wasn’t sure if he should apologize.  Had they upset him?  Should they have waited for him?  Or at least told him?
The tension easing out of Harry was nearly palpable, and Ron frowned, disappointed with himself.  Harry’s outburst would have responded better to hugs than hexes.  Ron regretted not picking up on it when Harry was shooting at him and generally being a prat.
“Good,” Harry blurted, shuddering at the thought of candy corn stuck to his teeth.  “Is it a food Ron and I like to eat?”
A Bludger bat leaning on the wall next to the door caught Draco’s attention. A freshly-oiled, iron-bound professional bat. On the floor next to it, half-obscured by a wadded bath towel, two more bat handles peeked out from the mess.
The grass over her grave is conspicuously lush. Harry wonders if her family has been watering it through the heat of the summer. Probably. Green blades shoot out of the earth, eager, as if they haven’t already been there for a decade, roots creeping slowly down toward the biggest mistake he’s ever made. Or . . . one of the biggest mistakes.
“Anyway, you’d just kind of tilt your chin down and look up at them.  Don’t show your neck.  Only wolves do that.”
Everything was smoldering, and Malfoy had left him alone at the squat table to sweat it out.  He tried to bend his knees, but they hit the underside, and he settled into crossing his ankles in the small space below the chair.
Draco gasped in mock shock.  “What have we here?  Oh, no.  It’s stuck.  Be a lamb, Harry, won’t you?”
Harry’s grin faded.  “Yeah, but if we’re going to my flat, I’m going to drop off my dirty laundry so I can wash it this weekend.  I don’t want to waste a trip.”
But her voice. He’d somehow forgotten what her voice sounded like. Or maybe it had changed. His certainly had.
“Great,” he muttered, hips still giving an involuntary thrust against her hands.  The last thing he needed was a mouthy Granger knowing his inner thoughts just then.  A Granger who was going to spend her evening under Potter.  “Granger, I didn’t.  I don’t-“
Murmurs of conversation, punctuated by whispered moans and low chuckles filled the empty air of the home as he made tea.
He took a long shuddering inhale and checked on Potter.  Demonstrably soaping up his backside.  His very lovely backside that really should have been more enticing.
Malfoy took Hermione’s chair and sat down with the book. “So, 28 days, regular?” he asked, again trying to tread lightly into the topic.
They’d been their usual hostile, sharp-toothed selves until he’d told them he was there to get the Black hearth rug out of the Prewett vault.  After that, they’d practically tripped over each other to ingratiate themselves.  Name dropping, he huffed.  Not just for Pureblood supremacists, apparently.
He hummed in agreement.  “I really do like a good pelvis.”  He punctuated the statement by burying his face in her waist and blowing a raspberry.
Ron’s head thunked solidly against the frame of the basement Floo.  What the fuck was he supposed to do with this?
His not-husband was almost certainly doing the same. Would he think of Draco while he did it? While he he pulled himself off? While his toes curled and his hips locked? While he came so hard he held onto the sink to stay upright?
So, Harry had been sitting alone at the low table, the shortest in the room, by Malfoy’s choice, sipping at the strange drinks.  They shone like oil slicks in the wavering lantern light.  In steadier light, they were an inky dark blue with sifting golden sparkles.
He slid it back to Ron over the shiny tabletop.  It looked like it’d just been polished that day.  Draco stared blankly in Ron’s general direction, and he waved a hand in the other man’s field of vision.
It didn’t hurt, which helped him relax.  But it didn’t feel good, either.  He drew in a deep breath and remembered Draco saying something similar about one of the dildos.
He stood uneasily at the head of the table and wrapped his hand around the red dildo.  Millicent really should have just named it after him.  “Harry cock” sounded terrible, though.  “Potter penis”?  Wow, no.  Maybe naming dildos was more difficult than he gave her credit for.
Harry’s jaw had dropped open, and he shut it with a snap.  He’d assumed Falk was a few years older than them, but he’d never thought there was that much of a spread.  Gods, that was a bit disturbing.
“Oh,” Harry said softly, as if Draco’s dashed future had never occurred to him. Maybe it hadn’t.  “Are you going to visit?”
She froze, his entire shaft fully seated inside her, and he waited for her reaction.  He expected her to move, but she just sat.  Faintly, he could feel the muscles near her opening erratically squeezing him.
“Aww, romantic,” Ron interrupted dreamily.  Malfoy paused, smiling.  Weasley was a bit of a softie, apparently.  Harry looked at Ron like he’d just admitted to
She thought back to the shredded pile of naan Ron had wasted the other night.  Maybe it hadn’t just been a way to occupy his hands.
But she could hold onto them, because Malfoy’s tear-streaked face didn’t look open to interview.  He wrapped his arms around his waist, suddenly feeling overexposed.
He’d been a little anxious when he’d Flooed home from… Amy?   …Ann?  …What’s-her-name’s flat last night that Hermione would still be in his bed.  Part of him found it exciting that she might have stayed, but the rest of him was terrified she’d ask where he’d just come from.
Ron had been considering offering to try to put Lou to sleep.  Somehow, he felt like he would just be inherently good at that.  He had a very calming presence, he thought as he picked at the soot on his shirt.  But Audrey had not only beat him to it, but was infinitely more experienced.
Tentatively, he leaned back onto his elbows, pretending to pay attention to their conversation.  They’d moved on to theorizing how much quartz was behind the quartz and Harry couldn't care less.  Quarts and quarts of quartz, he thought to himself.
In the adrenaline of yesterday’s political battle, they’d fallen into deadly, administrative lockstep like sisters in arms.  But in the hush of the Atrium, the chasm of authority lay heavy between them.
Draco shook his head and crossed his arms over his lower back. His ex-fiance was upset, and the urge to touch him made Draco’s fingertips hot.
Her hand drifted down his back to cup his ass, and his followed suit. Idly, she realized this is what he’d meant by telling her she was leading.
Harry watches him leave in a mess of leather, lace, and green flames, and a gust of warm, cedar-scented wind flows through the room. He shuffles up to bed and spends the rest of the night alternating between dreams of sparkling blue eyes and a churning nightmarish tangle of pale limbs that makes his soulmate mark burn.
“Uhm, alright.” Harry’s eyes wander back down to the bulge in black satin, but Draco shakes his head.
Adams was standing, presenting the last of the evidence they’d found at the Manor.  Fifteen human bodies.  Ten of them bore traces of Unforgivable curses.  Eight of those bore traces of magic that matched Lucius Malfoy’s signature.  The Kiss was inevitable.
None of it belonged in his home.  None of it meant anything to him.  None of it would be passed on.  None of it was worth even looking at, if an inspection hadn’t been required before transfer and forfeiture.
Wary confusion furrowed Harry’s brow, but Draco continued.  “A… friend told me.”  Harry’s steady gaze softened, and Draco hesitated to broach the more consequential topic.  He released a deep breath before speaking.  “What are the consequences?  For what we did?”
An embarrassed flush burned across Harry’s cheeks at the directness.  Sure, he was worried they’d slip up and make skin contact where they shouldn’t, but it was just so damn much fabric that it wasn’t likely.  He sighed and silently berated himself.  It was definitely a confidence thing.
if that hadn’t been the best fight he’d had in years.  He licked his lips and tried to not enjoy how cathartic it had been.
Carefully, he rolled them over, watching her face.  Being on top made him nervous.  He didn’t remember the last time he’d had a woman like this, but he knew it hadn’t ended well.
“Hm,” Ron hummed in appreciation.  “An interview with the Muggle-raised Head Auror would be a nice touch.  Probably sell plenty of copies, too.”
She wasn’t opposed to having children. Intended to, actually. But she didn’t want her entire life to be nappies, snacks, and messes. The Ministry probably wouldn’t appreciate footing her expenses in Cardiff for her to run off and whelp a passel of adorable ginger miscreants. And they
He chuckled and stroked her hair.  “Let’s find a bed,” he suggested.  “I can’t exactly reciprocate like this.”
He smiled softly to himself and leaned his forehead onto Harry’s dusty shoulder.  His Legilimancy traced Harry’s mind, gently offering up the dream he’d just had.  The girl with his eyes, with his accidental magical outbursts.  Harry’s barrier dipped, and he stilled under Draco’s touch as he watched.
“What the fu-“ Harry attempted, dreading evidence of his arousal being photographed, but the platform disappeared again.
The boy’s lips purse in a suppressed giggle that comes out his nose in an awkward wheeze. His little shoulders duck forward and lean back as he laughs to himself, unabashed.
“Mr. Weasley!” Jacinda’s shrewd voice echoed down the hall.  “The WonderWitch section is overrun by spiders!”
A brief wave of panic swept him as he mentally rehashed the evening.  She had plenty of reasons to not trust him, but no new ones he could think of.  But one date did not trust incur.  If this had even been a date.
Harry stepped out looking bewildered but relieved.  The paper ball skittered between his feet into Floos unknown.
Hermione’s heart sank.  She could just make do with Muggle men again. It had been… serviceable.  She’d gotten rather good at casting wandless contraception charms without men noticing.  It would have been wonderful to not have to worry about hiding the charms, and her wand, and all the other little things.
Draco hummed softly as he sank down on the thick orange length.  Harry watched it slowly disappear inside the other man as he fought his own appreciative moan.  It looked like it felt so good.  One of Hermione’s fingers had blown his fucking mind.  What did having an entire cock feel like?
Harry tried to fit the mobile into his hip pocket, but his jeans had gotten too tight, so he settled for tossing it on the sofa.  It bounced, and he held his breath as it ricocheted off the armrest to settle safely on a cushion.
Not willing to call his forfeited day a loss, his fingers walked further back in the drawer to a thick folder labelled “Malfoy, L.A., Sep. 8, 1955, #51487, 1 of 5”.
Lucius Malfoy probably had very little in the way of a soul to claim, so the Dementors would dispose of him in mere seconds.  Maybe it would be worth watching.
“Propaganda?” Harry asked.  Was he supposed to be censoring reading materials as an Auror?  He’d missed that memo, if so.  “How can dirty stories be propaganda?”
Hermione’s thumbnail clicked back and forth over a crack in her mug as she thought.  Ursella wasn’t ready to leave home.  But then, she’d also been a real pain in the arse as the sole child still at Wheal Elvan last year.  Moody, that one.  But powerful, and unpredictable, and stubborn as a little mule.
Draco stared straight ahead at the train and watched as a porter levitated the childrens’ trunks into the cargo hold.  He licked his lips, took a breath to speak, but shook his head.
Molly had done a better job explaining Blood Magic to Harry than Ron had, her grandfather being the last practitioner in the family.  Malfoy had been noticeably silent during her meager explanation.  Harry still had questions, but Molly had been reluctant to talk about it.
that this man’s mouth tasted like an August thunderstorm. He knew the feel of those teeth along his tongue like he knew his own. He knew how to whisper the man’s name into his open, gasping mouth… but not how to say it.
Squirming at his tickling, she shook her head.  “I did said I wanted you to bend me over and fuck me into the mattress, didn’t I?’
Her weight shifted back, then leaned forward again, eliciting another jolt and whimper from him.  She leaned in further to lick a smear of chocolate from his bottom lip, and settled her hands on his hips, pressing down.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
The walls are glass, the bloody ceiling is glass. The only solid walls are in the center of the space, with the kitchen against one, and, Harry assumes, a bathroom on the other side.
She squinted at him in challenge, but her spreading grin ruined it. He was too damned cute. Had he always been this cute? Somehow, she doubted he’d been like this with any other women, and she got the impression there’d been plenty of them.
“I… I was Initiated by my grandfather.  My parents never knew.  And I Initiated my children and grandchildren,” she rambled, grateful to finally talk to someone about her family’s secret history with Blood Magic.  “Audrey and Fleur know.  But Arthur and my children don’t know.  They’d be furious.”
“No, no kids.”  He raised his face, but rested his chin in his palm, fatigue evident.  “Mag knew enough Blood Magic that we, ah… got drunk, and uhm, made sure there would be no mini-Malfoys.”
is used in non-wizard circles.  It applies to anyone you’re romantically or sexually linked to.  But mostly, you’re my transportation.”
They still didn’t know the identities of the deceased, but it didn’t really matter.  No innocent person would use Unforgivables and hide the bodies.
“Oh,” Harry said, catching on.  “I guess he did.  But I hadn’t really thought of that as Legilimency.  It didn’t hurt.”
The Burrow had never been home, either.  Not really.  They’d tried, but he was the mis-matched mortar tuck-pointed between the stones of the foundation.  Not that he was ever one of the stones, himself.  Just someone they’d collected.  A patchjob person.
Harry picked at the crumbs stuck to his wrapper and avoided looking at him.  It was unlike him to only ask once, Draco thought.  Also unlike him to not at least smile a tiny bit upon hearing the words.  It felt like Harry was trying to taste a lie in his words.
Malfoy had some fucking explaining to do.  Rinsing out the mug, she tried to keep her hands from shaking, but it was no use.
“I minded.” Draco skewered a pearl onion and chunk of meat. “She wouldn’t have appreciated dinner in her current state.”
Despite looking fairly new, it was absolutely covered in sticky fingerprints.  He looked to the Unspeakable for an explanation.
He wondered if she’d still be up to visiting Wheezes and shopping in Diagon Alley tomorrow.  Plans that involved her having to walk much seemed unlikely to happen.  But if they stayed in, they’d absolutely end up fucking her to pieces again.  Or vice versa.
“I’ll just… get your robes, then?” Harry mutters as he picks up Draco’s clothes. More than robes. Shoes, socks, shirt, trousers, and silky boxers that Harry’s rather proud of himself for not rubbing across his lips.
Malfoy turned a page and grimaced. Wherever Salem, Massachusetts was, he wasn’t going there.  Coarse wetness scraped up the rim of his ear, and he flinched.  The fucking cat had moved from pointedly purring in his ear to licking him.  “Shoo.”
He was usually fully hard by this point, but his body was lagging behind today. Something felt off. Maybe he should have eaten breakfast.
“Honey, don’t play dumb.”  He props himself up on his elbows and slides closer, until his chin rests in front of my nose.  It might be my imagination, but I can smell my come on his lips.  “There is exactly one reason you grind your teeth.”
He paused, hand hesitating on the warm metal of the handle into the hatchery.  This thing could make them one of the wealthiest families in Europe.  There had to be a dozen eggs in there.  Each worth a lifetime of work.  King Weasley, indeed.
Draco’s breath came out in a rush.  What would he have done if Harry had had any other reaction?  Excused him from duty?  Bought him parenting books?  Signed him up for classes on changing diapers?
He’d picked those roses.  Inhaled their scent and let the particles stick in his airways till they were part of him.  Like Harry’s scent in this shirt.
“You’re lovely, too.” With a chuckle, Draco flops down next to him and settles his head on Harry’s chest, ear over Harry’s heart. “I’m a bit smitten.”
He opened his mouth, but couldn’t think of anything to say.  She absolved him of his response by claiming his mouth in a slow, deep kiss that made him moan in surprised reassurance.
“Alright. We can’t Apparate out. Hell, we can’t really use magic to get past the reporters at all. So… now what?”
Draco swallowed past a lump in his throat.  Ron knew everything about the twins.  Granger knew about the dreams, at least.  How long till they told Potter, anyway?
He slid silver wire-frame glasses and a pen out of his pocket and frowned.  Long, pale fingers capped a vial and carefully copied down an identification code and date.  Harry frowned.  That was technically his job.
That sounded very ominous, Harry mused, fully aware Falk could hear his thoughts.  This couldn’t be worse than burning a terrified teenager out of a forest with dragons.  Faintly, he felt Falk’s cynical amusement.
“If you’re ready then, my jailor,” Draco said wryly.  Foreboding tickled through him, and he hesitated.
Malfoy looked at the thin blade and worn, ornate handle in his hand and the fine white lines that melded together between his fingers.  Harry squinted through dusty glasses, not sure what the other man was doing.
“We’ve been discussing lighting this room on fire, little trickster,” Odbert replied dryly.  “That’s how little value it holds to Goblins.  In fact, you can help yourself whenever you like.  The ward will admit you.  We have better things to do.”
“Didn’t expect you to disappear for a whole fucking week,” came the man’s gravel-rough voice, syllables spat through a New York accent. “Not after
The ward delivered the signature. The magic was a rubbery, amorphous, warm shape. She felt like the center of a loaf of sourdough bread, and his mouth watered.
Draco rolled his eyes and adjusted his swollen cock inside his pajama bottoms for the umpteenth time.  He mentally added six months to the grudge he was planning to hold against Percy Cockblocker Weasley.
“So… Did Connie warn you about Basilia while she gave you the tour?” Harry asked, still impressed by how he’d absolutely shut her down.
”  Draco’s eyelids fluttered, head tilted forward, as he watched his fingers disappear between Harry's lips.
She hummed in consideration, hands drifting back to his cock.  “We’re going to run out of hot water soon, too.”
Perhaps.  If they’d gone out to dinner, seen a show, maybe engaged in other activities, and had just recently gotten around to fucking and finding that egg.  And his… gift.
Relaxing into the companionable silence, he scanned the library patrons for anyone noticing him, or pretending to not notice him, and opened the book.
Maybe Harry will be the one to waste away this time; life drained out of him by his own stubborn self-denial. Maybe Jensen will go back to the States never knowing why his soulmate mark briefly appeared. And maybe that’s the best solution.
She knew it was a weighty proposal, and both an unorthodox but very traditional one.  It had only taken her a decade to finally approach him about it.
He follows Draco’s blurry form toward the kitchen, and breathes in deep lungfuls of air that smells like forest floor.
Draco’s hands spread her open as she slid down, taking his length. She heard Harry let out a surprised huff behind her, and Draco blew a raspberry, she assumed against the inside of Harry’s knee.
“Hang on,” Ron said, hearing a welcome voice out in the hall.  He wheeled himself over to the door and stuck his head out.  “Jacinda!  Wanna be floor manager?”
Harry checks his watch and wonders if it’s too late to Floo back to Andromeda’s. It really is too close to Teddy’s bedtime, but she might forgive him. Then again, it had cost him five toffees and a promise of more Hotwheels to get Teddy to let him leave in the first place. Harry slips a hand in his pocket and counts the remaining toffees.
“There was a long cord that went out the back of the cottage, across a field, to a petrol station, if that helps.  The old man that owned it always gave me homemade pickles.  And not pickled cucumbers.  Pickled… everything.  And vodka.  And magazines of naked women.  Russia is an interesting place, Harry,” Draco drawled, satisfied with his own emotional evasion.
That tongue of his may not be able to tell lies, but it's adept at spinning promises like candy floss.  His hand sneaks under me, around my cock while he licks my entrance, and I can't stay still.  He may as well hold my entire body between his fist and his lips, and my pillow barely muffles my sobbed moans.
“She knows I’m an Unspeakable,” Luna said.  “Family is allowed to know, in case we go missing.  Why did you need an Unspeakable, though?”
Harry sighed and pressed the button for the lobby, wishing he’d used the DMLE Apparition point to transport him near a liquor store.  He wasn’t sure what kind of booze to bring to Malfoy’s but he figured expensive wine would be a solid choice.
He smirked and knelt on the edge of the bed, water coursing enticingly down the planes of his chest, over his trim waist, and down his hips.
He was gorgeous, Draco had to admit. Every bit of him honed for sport. Close-cropped brown hair. Thick, square jaw. Crooked nose. A scar on one earlobe from a ripped out earring.
Harry’s hand wrapped around Draco’s slick length and squeezed, drawing soft moans from both of them.  His hand slid down the thin covering, testing, relishing the heat soaking through.
Ron broke first, and she felt him giggling against her back while he gripped her breasts.  Harry leaned forward, loud guffaws erupting from him, till one finally ended in a snort.  He wiped tears from his eyes.
It had been cowardly of him to not answer Harry in front of Granger.  The poor bastard had apparently worried about him shagging other men for a solid day.  And all night, by the look of it.
Harry managed to get his mug to his lips, which required two hands today.  The poor bastard was entirely too upset.  Did his friends never tell him they loved him?  Or the Weasleys?  If not, when was the last time someone had?
“Right,” she said, turning her attention away from Malfoy. “That’s honestly about as much as I’ll be able to spare when my classes and Ministry internship start in September.”
And a small envelope with her name and address, but no return address.  An early birthday card, maybe?
Draco shudders against Harry’s back, and slow, gentle movements inside Harry taper off as he finds his breath again.
She groaned and thrust her hips back against his waiting fingers, driving them in deeper.  It wasn’t enough.  Hot threads of pleasure gathered, but she needed him to
The dread seeped into Draco’s brain and connected too many dots. The fist-sized hole in the hall wall. The blood on the doorway. The bitten cigarette butts. The earring. The shoes. The fucking
It was an abrupt stretch, and he swallowed the hiss of his breath as not to startle Harry.  The wide head pulled a soft moan from him as it passed inside.  His hips tilted back, drawing it just slightly forward, just perfect.  Fingertips on the table kept him upright while his other hand wrapped around his own length.
Ron took one last appraising glance at Draco as he stepped back to the Floo.  Definitely going to talk to Harry about leaving him in such a state.
Harry’s voice rumbled from below her. “You’ve got a cock to ride before you can sleep, greedy witch.”
Harry sighed.  “Yeah.  Yeah, I did.”  He considered telling Ron about looking through the Malfoys’ files, but decided against it.  They’d left Hermione’s flat on decent terms a few nights ago, and he wasn’t eager to ruin that.
Draco follows the yawn with a long, back-arching stretch, and Harry tries to not peek over the counter at the exposed sliver of his abdomen but fails immediately.
Godric, how he loved the Burrow.  Someone was always home, always doing something, family always coming and going.  There was always someone to talk to, something to eat, somewhere comfortable to relax.  It was the exact opposite of the Dursley’s.  And his flat.
Harry rose to his knees behind Draco, letting his hands wander the expanse of pale skin and black lace in front of him.  Soft, eager moans and the skim of slick lips came from in front of Draco.  Hermione had seated herself in front of him, hands threaded through blond hair, holding him bent at the waist and ass on display.
“Cruel,” he replied.  One word.  One exhale.  And Draco’s breath hitched at the brevity.  Perhaps Magnus had been exceptionally brusque.  Judgmental.  A little harsh.  But cruel?
Draco sighed and rested his chin on the armrest of the sofa and spoke toward the kitchen doorway. “How long have you lived here?”
“Draco,” he whispered.  “You’re fucking gorgeous.  And I want you.  And tomorrow, I can have you, and it scares the
Harry climbed up to kneel on the table behind Draco, fisting his cock over the other man’s open mouth, free hand knotted in blond hair.  The tension broke more suddenly than it built, and Harry groaned as he painted Draco’s chin and mouth.
Harry narrowly stopped himself from looping his arm through Malfoy’s.  His hand very appropriately gripped the other man’s elbow to lead him to the lift.
“Fast food.  Pub fare.  You realize you’re very hungry.  It’s there.  It tastes good.  You eat it.  End of story.  Or fuck, as it were,” he explained, letting just a little condescension leak through.  “Now, the opposite would be a formal dinner.”
Giving him the memories of Malfoy at Hermione’s and healing Ron at the Burrow had been disturbingly easy.  Falk had found Malfoy barreling into Hermione’s couch in eagle form absolutely hilarious.
“We don’t think so.  I’ve no reports of a reply,” he said leaning forward over the counter.  “I’ve heard tell of one wizard in Liverpool who paid for ten owls, one after the other, all with the same message.  Nothing.”
Harry’s confusion kept him quiet, despite the urge he had to slam the door to protect… everyone, really.  That amount of anger would usually result in hexes and curses.
Several of the men in the Wizengamot box straightened and paid attention at the mention of Quidditch.  Pitiful, Harry thought.  Abuse, torture, and international sanctions galore; but what got their attention was fucking Quidditch.
“Who’s willing to go full monty today?” Basilia oozed, licking her lips.  Gods below, Harry hated this woman.  He glared at her and stepped away from Falk and off the platform.
think of it, ‘Mione?” He watched her, still turning to assess the room, and took the opportunity to strip naked while she wasn’t looking. Harpies love surprises.
“I need a shower,” Harry murmured, the beginnings of a smirk growing.  “Don’t get married without me.”
“I’ve texted with Pansy about it, actually,” she said with a touch of hesitation.  It was a little dodgy of her to go about mapping out family planning without consulting… well, the rest of the family.
He flicked the skirt out flat on the bed and rolled over onto it. She laid on her side next to him and stroked his back until his eyes drifted shut.  He didn’t generally fall asleep after a single round, but gods, that had been… something.
Harry scoffed, looking up from the Head Auror application that had appeared earlier without warning.  Had it materialized because he’d used Robards’ Floo yesterday?  Or because he’d been taking over some of the more banal administrative duties since the man had left?
“Oh, Draco!  I think you’re sunburnt!”  She tut-tutted and shooed him inside.  “No, really!  You’re quite flushed.  Ron, don’t you think...”
She groaned and he heard her joints crack as she sat heavily back down in her chair.  “You really should use a different name, child.  Truro’s not as isolated as you think.”
The hours he’d spent filtering through her uni memories had been… endearing.  She was the same swotty girl she’d been as a child, but with the maturity and passion of a grown woman.  And her ability to link philosophical discourse to archeology in obscure, tangential ways made his cock throb.
to torture and kill a Muggle-born war hero.  And they’d likely invite him to the party, the disgusting fucks.
“Merlin’s tits, Harry,” Draco grumbled.  “Do I have lusty, amorous feelings toward Magnus Falk?  No.  Fond, resentful, mixed-up, occasionally sexual feelings?  Yes.  Do I plan on fucking him?  No.”
Ron gushed, “We still have a painting of my great grand-dad and mum with theirs, Lucy.  Lost a good bit of her hand, but she got her man.”
Harry almost offers to bring some to Gringotts, but pauses to analyze the statement. “Are you inviting yourself to stay for breakfast?”
Hermione’s shoulders rose, and she laughed again, spilling more onto his hand as he stared on in shock.
“Okay, so the first basement is storage for Ministry-ordered supplies.  I got us into defense charms in a big way about five years ago.  The level below that is… a dragon egg hatchery.  It looks like a boiler room.  Just… with a lot of boilers.  And sometimes hatchlings.  Charlie brings the eggs in and takes the hatchlings back to the reserves.  I get to keep the shells to sell to apothecaries and whatnot.”
“Excellent,” he said, wandering to the counter to start the coffee.  “And you’re on day 13.  And I’m not sharing the coffee, so don’t ask.  I think we’d both agree it’s better for you if I just drink the entire press.”
Harry opens his mouth to declare he’d be a terrible tour guide, but Blaise clears his throat and launches back into their conversation. “Moving out was
Hot streaks landed on his lower back, and he gasped, turning to moan into the leather.  More drops trailed down the cleft of his cheeks, sliding over his hole and making him shudder.
The tattooed knuckles distract Harry for a moment, then he reaches into his pocket. He snaps a plain silver key down on the tabletop to draw Draco’s attention.
Seeing her own tear-streaked face somehow made her sorrow real.   Her hands clapped over her mouth to quiet the lone sob that wrenched up out of her chest.
.”  His arms slid up along Harry’s shins against the table, and he turned to kiss Harry’s inner thigh.  “No idea, at all.”
Ron disappeared, and Harry heard him brushing his teeth.  Almost certainly with Harry’s toothbrush.  A bit disgusting.  Or maybe not, considering how often they’d shared women.
Her hand slowly skated down the curve of her breast, raised goosebumps as it trailed the slight hollow of her waist, and settled on her hip bone.
So, maybe this level of intimacy was foreign and got under his skin.  That wasn’t so uncommon.  Not for somebody with his upbringing. And Draco understood.
hexed out of you for eating soup too loudly.  Repeatedly.”  He said it like he was reading fucking Quidditch scores.  Just a fact.  The sky is blue.  Water is wet.  Narcissa Malfoy tortured her son for slurping his soup.  Grass is green.
She picked up her pace and gathered speed, approaching her fifth orgasm.  He felt her muscles tense around him, and thought of the least sexy things he could.  Eira in a bikini.  Portkey nausea.  Azkaban.  That tamped down the threatening roil.  For now.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” he exclaimed, as blue-white light drifted in through his window, coalescing into a stag.  “Potter, you utter fucking tosser!”
She shook her head.  Playing with detonators in a cave sounded like a man date if ever she’d heard of one.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
“There it is.  Right the fuck there, Potter.  I’m standing here, telling you I don’t want to see you, and you’re eye-fucking me like a witch in heat.”
It smelled even better laying down, and Harry wondered if he could get away with rolling over and burying his face in it.  Maybe run his lips over it.  Press his hips against it while his hands skimmed up-
He needed to be going over Malfoy’s records for the Wizengamot Committee meeting in a couple weeks, not dealing with this dumb-fuckery.  Especially not from Ron, and not for something this idiotic.  He had absolutely no patience for this caliber of bullshit today.
“Anyway, he sent them in February.  All proper,” Malfoy continued, vowing to give Granger an antique courting book, “and Narcissa slit the Thestrals' throats and-“
Without looking back, he stepped up onto the windowsill, gripped it with his toes, let go of the frame, and dropped out.   Hermione let out a startled squeak.
Harry shifts his hold, one arm under the fox’s hind legs, one under his front paws. Draco sighs and rests his muzzle on his front paws. The heartbeat thudding against Harry’s hands slows, and the fox’s black-lined eyelids flutter shut. He’s even more monochromatic than Draco as a human. Black nose, pure white fur, fine black whiskers, grey irises with rings of near-black around the outer edges.
“I want to talk to Neve when she gets back.”  Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and thought.  "About plants, too.
,” he whispered, eyes vacant. His tongue ran the full path of his upper jaw, and he let Harry see the gesture.
Grey eyes squinted in doubt before he spoke.  “Could Adams take pictures of Lucius getting the Kiss?”
Through the bond, Harry felt Draco’s resigned disappointment, but he hoped the other man felt his resolve.  It was far too heavy-handed, and it looked like Hermione agreed with him.  She was busily chatting with the Committee members around her.
“Mm hm,” Draco hummed, praying to every pantheon he wasn’t getting hard again.  Lace fucking knickers.  Terrible choice.  Incredibly awkward.
He finished ruffling his hair, roughly toweled off his body, and wrapped the towel around his waist.  Still entirely too vulnerable to attack, but better than cold and naked.
“And me,” Malfoy acknowledged, also proud of Harry for using words.  “Heals his players up mid-game with Blood Magic, too.”  Malfoy had to look away.  Harry’s gaze had gotten too intense.
My blood turns golden-sticky-thick-sweet, heart valves churning.  It clogs my throat, viscous and vicious. His favorite treat.
“I’m sorry, ‘Mione.  You didn’t know.  Ron did.  Or should have.”  He stood in front of her, uneasy.  “Dinner?”
A splintering crack interrupted him, followed by a tumble and squawk as the bench collapsed. His breath thudded out in a rush, and she briefly caught herself, but crashed on top of him, pinning him against the wood.
At Ron’s nod, they both stood and hustled up to the bedroom Molly had turned into a nursery.  Audrey was clutching a wide-awake toddler Lou, who was trying to get his chubby fingers on the eagle’s face.
“Probably unregistered,” groused Ron.  Malfoys earlier jab sank in, and he turned to her.  “Did you seriously send him a Patronus about this?”
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
Sorting his hand as Ron dealt, Harry muttered, “She’s right, Ron.  You’re just going to have to burn that shirt entirely.”
A dozen pairs of eyes glare at Harry, angry at being startled, and he busies himself smoothing out the wrinkles in the blanket.
The script was the same as the front of the envelope, and it gave him pause.  Where was Malfoy’s elaborate scrawling calligraphy?  And he was inviting him to a formal dinner?  Like the ones he’d seen in Magnus’ memories?
Harry’s voice had a sleepy drawl to it when he spoke. “You had a bit of a tantrum about it, and-” He yawned and Draco did the same. “You used that curse and fucking flayed yourself in front of the DMLE administration. And me. Entire chest, and the one arm. Just… poof, nothing but one big wound.”
She brushed off his shock with a shrug, having had more than enough chastening on account of her communication methods.  Letting Ron rip into her all over again was the last thing she needed.
Shacklebolt slowly rose to stand behind his podium and raised his wand.  Rather than quiet the crowd, most of them went for their own wands, as well.
And for the familial finale, the last heir took out several major institutions on his way.  Kaboom!  Curtains on the Malfoys!  There will be no encore.
He slid the card back in the stack with the other four, examining the pictures of the men in their uniforms.  With a sigh, he inspected his attire.  This visit had to happen soon, anyway.  And Azkaban wasn’t
The ward shook again, this time shunting forward a magical signature.  Somebody was pushy.  Rolling it around in his mind, it took a while to place.  Cracked leather?  No, vellum.  Cracked, flaking vellum.  Granger in distress?
“Cool. Don’t be a narc.” Jensen snorts at his own joke and pulls a Bic lighter out of his pocket. “See you in the morning.”
“Malfoy,” Harry says, zipping up his trousers. “If I keyed my Floo for you, would you want to make this a regular thing?”
But if you can’t yell about sex at a baby shower, where on Earth can you?  And I don’t think I yelled, anyway.  But, seriously, it’s a party because somebody made a baby.  A fertilization festival.  It’d be like going to a wine tasting and forbidding the discussion of grapes.  Dirty, dirty grapes, all seedy and gooey, just dangling there for anyone to lick.  The horror!
Harry tapped distractedly on the mobile screen.  “It’s only three weeks.  You’ll find something else to do.”
The camera splinters apart against the marble floor, and the man’s screams echo down the empty halls before they’re filled with bellowed shouts. The fox growls and tugs, teeth latched on the reporter’s trousers. With a loud rip, fabric splits and peels down, Draco tumbling with it.
Relief and anxiety twisted through him in alternative waves as Magnus started toward the stairs at a run.
Drawers slammed in Harry’s room as he grouched about.  Cautiously, she cracked the fridge door open, breath held.  Instead of slimy lettuce and moldy cheese, she was greeted by a round mouth lined with rows of sharp teeth and bare-knuckled, furry hands on severed limbs.
“You’ve been here before.” The door code, the keys, the scratched lines on the door frame, the thermostat, the dried-out sink drain trap. “You’ve been here quite a bit.”
“Jace, round up the older staff and have them circle the building with that charm.  Tell the younger ones we’re working on a new spider illusion,” he instructed, shoving his way down the hall to the basement door.
Hoping she’d take it as a cue to leave, he cleared the table.  The window over the sink was open, the cool breeze raising goosebumps as he washed the mugs.
A tap at the window was a welcome distraction.  Crookshanks agreed, skittering over the table to hurtle across the living room, investigation already underway.
“Let him stay there,” she said, laying her head on his chest.  He hummed hesitantly in warning, but wrapped an arm around her and nodded.
“I think,” she mused, rubbing her chin against his shorts, “that you may have to take these divine little pants off.”
“Taking a nap. Apparently.” He stretches, and his jeans, possibly the same black jeans he’d worn before, slide down his arse.
His eyes settled back on her, having examined the kitchen and living room to his satisfaction. It was almost unnerving how accurate his mental image of her was. He’d always fantasized about her as more voluptuous than she had been in school, both because it was logical, and because it was sexy as hell. And here she was, the full-breasted, round-hipped version of her, clad in a tank top and little shorts.
Harry’s cock and “thumbs up” didn’t look any more dignified in India ink than it had on Hermione’s phone, but Draco was rather proud of it.
“I suppose,” she said with a sigh.  Her mobile buzzed against her thigh in a summoning call.  “You’re sure?”
thinking it was because they could smell Griffin or Runespoor on him.  Or his rucksack, more likely.
in a way that made him eager to divest himself from his trousers.  Pity.  Potter was gazing upon him in pity.  Ugh.
But the Ministry schedule was primarily evenings and weekends, the opposite of Cardiff Law.  So, in theory, and in white-knuckled forced reality, it
The whole Muggle communication system seemed incredibly complicated.  For as often as he saw Muggles frustrated with them, he wondered if even
Harry chuffed a laugh.  No wonder Falk had said to not view this in front of Malfoy.  He’d be absolutely incensed at being called a pet.  Probably.
Harry breaks away for a breath, but Draco’s lips find him again. Draco’s hips grind against Harry’s, and a hand threads through Harry’s hair. Draco grabs a fistful of hair, and Harry gasps as sharp pain rips an eager whimper from his lips.
“Peace of mind, I suppose.” Draco lays back down, cheek on his folded arms and arse hanging half out of his jeans. “
His own mental voice chided him in Magnus’ accent.  It wasn’t her fault he’d overshared.  Again.  A sharp inhale from her caught his attention.  She’d slid back from the table to lean her elbows onto her knees, eyes level with her tea.  Her head drooped.
“Oh, God, Harry,” Jensen whispers, stricken, eyes on Harry’s arm. “I had no idea you two were . . .”
“You dreamt about kids.  And kids exist,” Ron summarized poorly.  “I’m missing a lot of pieces of how you’re involved here.”
“Circe’s sideways slit,” Draco mutters, waving a hand through the glittering mass. “Bloody nonsense.”
“It’ll be more than enough.  I put so many on Bill and Fleur’s chalet that they couldn’t crack eggs for breakfast their first morning.”
“It’s just…” he trailed off, a faint shaking of Harry’s ankles against the insides of his knees drawing his attention.  “…dangerous.”
He leaned against the bookcase, careful to stay in the shadows.  Harry looked away from Draco’s jarringly tender movements to take in the rest of the room.  Draco’s pajamas were neatly folded on the arm of the sofa.
“Those were banned by the Ministry fifty years ago.  Dangerous propaganda,” he chided.  “I have the whole series.”  He waggled his eyebrows at Ron in the mirror.
He sighed, grey eyes turning to her as his shoulders relaxed down. “Luna and I have been meeting sporadically for three years to either play-hunt as Animagi or fuck in a somewhat spectacularly elaborate fashion.”
The window scrapes open with no small amount of force on my part, weathered wood sticking against the frame.  My fingers leave tacky watermelon juice fingerprints.
His fingers slid down over his nose, as if blocking out the memory of the smell.  Harry’s heart dropped, and he fought to keep his face from showing it.  He’d really thought he’d seen all the misery Draco had lived through, but he’d only seen what his
The bus pulled up to her stop, tearing her away from her examination.  Leaving the paper in its sheath of envelope, she slid it in her planner and set out toward her intended campus building.
Hermione froze as a leather pouch plopped onto the counter.  A familiar leather pouch with a big “W” pressed into the front.  Harry stared at the pouch.  His brow slowly furrowed as his lips turned down in a scowl.  She smelled ozone as his back straightened.  His whole body tensed, and his gaze burned a path over the floor on its way to her.  Her breath came fast under his scrutiny.
The arachnid cavalcade seemed to be tapering off as he descended into the furnace-filled hatchery.  The dozen oven-size metal drums all glowed steadily through their grates, and a quiet crunch alerted him to a soon-to-be hatchling.
Only people born into that kind of legacy got a life like this.  A life where you could love who you wanted to and have them love you back.  Even print it on the front of a fucking magazine.
It was incapacitating, the touching, but a little less with every casual affection.  And maybe he’d screw up his courage enough to reciprocate.
“I wasn’t sure if you were falling asleep or working on an orgasm,” he whispered, lips descending to graze along her shoulder.
His skin burned to be touched, having been denied in the bath.  His cock throbbed in the pants he’d hurriedly stuffed it into, and Harry just
“Sorry, I…” she started.  “You didn’t say anything when I asked if you were okay, so I wanted to check, and I… sorry.”
Harry hummed low and eager, fist around his cock as he moved to straddle Draco’s torso on hands and knees.  Slate grey eyes watched him coolly and fluttered shut as he leaned down for what he’d thought would be a soft, reassuring brush of lips.
Against his protests, she hoisted the bag onto the kitchen table and began unpacking.  Not ready to admit defeat, he hopped onto the table to scrutinize this unpacking.
Some of the tension in Harry’s shoulders eased. He’d been grateful when Draco had handed her a big bowl of stew and rice and scooted her politely out the door, but it felt selfish to admit it out loud. But it wasn’t her, or their
“And then you just…” Harry quarters the potatoes with ease, and shrugs. “You just chop them up without making it into a sword fight.”
“I…  Yeah.  I can make you dinner.”  Everything felt fuzzy, and he wasn’t entirely sure what she meant.
Belinda glared at the Supreme Mugwump, who was busily popping bubble wrap on her phone again.  Draco hazarded a suspicious glance toward Hermione as she openly admired the older woman.
Malfoy’s trousers hit the floor, and he stepped out, pulling off his socks more gracefully than any man should be able.  Hermione pursed her lips and hoped he was going to remove the dark green boxer briefs that were standing between her and a full show.  No such luck.
Eric has a dab of chocolate on his bottom lip, and Harry sucks his own lip under, licking along it. “He grew up rich.”
A sick, deep hum started at the cut in his thumb, and he nudged it over the front of him.  It crescendoed in a squalid whine and dropped.  A ward.
“Mum, what are they doing, exactly?”  Ron finally leaned over to ask.  His mum had been following the proceedings with a level of attention that only the informed could maintain.
Draco nodded vacantly, and Harry wondered if this was really the best course of action.  He looked like Harry had felt when Ron had made him talk about his attraction to men.  It had been awful, but he’d been immediately better for it.
The loose tendrils of pleasure weaving through her snapped into a humming rope, and with his next thrust broke, sending her moaning, her body clenching around his cock as he groaned against her shoulder.
Time spent in the library was as much a refuge as it was a fire walk.  There were no wards here, but the cathedral across the street provided enormous tree cover and a very convenient updraft.
How he’d ended up both these men’s personal confidante, he had no idea, Ron thought.  At least Hermione had the decency to just boss him around.  With a soft smile, he hoped she was in an especially bossy mood tonight.
The hairstyle was apparently due to her role in a friend’s wedding later that afternoon, and she’d spent her early morning hours in a salon.  It did explain the two enormous cups of coffee she’d arrived with and summarily guzzled as if winning a bet.
Fifteen minutes.  A wicked grin spread, and he licked his lips.  This Auror was going to find out just how filthy Draco Malfoy’s mouth could be.
Harry grins and finishes his tacos and his margarita, then leans back in the booth to watch a grown man dig into a culinary inferno like a child with birthday cake. Under the music, he can hear Eric humming between bites, a tuneless, content sound that Harry wants to feel against his body. A sound that he wants to be the cause of, because Eric deserves to be this happy all the time.
He smiled, leaning back in his chair, thinking about the possibilities.  Dates?  Was that something he could do now?  Go out to dinner with a man?  He hadn’t yet let himself think that far into the future, but that future was rapidly approaching.
Startled by sudden illumination, he sat up, watching Molly walk into the kitchen through rapidly-blinking eyes.
Their eyes met, and they both smiled.  Him, nervously.  Her, expectantly.  She lifted her head to nip his ear and whisper, “Fuck me, Harry.”
Finally, he steps out into his dark living room and fumbles his jeans open. He groans as his fist wraps around his cock and decides the tea towel is closer than the bathroom.
Ron stood and nodded to Harry to follow him outside.  Harry huffed and obliged.  He led them out to the rubble field, which was somewhat more organized.
Harry nodded and leaned back, reaching between them for Draco’s cock, grateful he was still hard after what was hopefully Harry Potter’s last round of
Having her over did sound like a good plan, but they’d never once simply spent time together.  Only briefly, both of them exhausted and sated.  What would they even do if they weren’t playing games?  Talk about Nargles and the weather?  Pass.
“Yes.  That’s accurate.” Falk stated blandly.  “The only hostility I’ve experienced was from Muggleborn and half-blood Brits.  I blame integration.”
“I… I want…” Harry stammered, not really sure how he was going to finish the sentence, or if he could.
This was a safety net and a soft landing.  This was the uncomfortable scrutiny of being seen with the bone-deep gratitude of being understood.  This was a laying down of the sword and collapsing into bed.
He considered ignoring him, but Potter knew he was here.  There was little privacy inside a Ministry ward.  Best send him off quickly, he thought with a sigh, and granted him passage.
Of all the breakfasts he’d skipped in his life, Draco was most grateful to not have eaten today.  Not that Potter hadn’t tried to feed him, but even coffee hadn’t smelled good.
Feeble light cut shafts through a series of high windows, providing ample dark space for an Auror’s imagination to run wild.
The bed had come out of the estate vault years ago.  The Ministry appraiser had deemed it worthless, and thus available to him.  He’d actually been prepared to negotiate with Robards after seeing them pull it out, and maybe Robards had picked up on that.
He watched her stretch, arching her back, and he froze as the urge to cover her slick, wet skin with his body rode him.
Ron was breathing steadily, and some color had come to his cheeks.  Malfoy still wouldn’t look at him for confirmation, but a sob of relief was building in Harry’s throat.
“The bodies they found near the tree line at the Manor all show evidence of trauma and residual Unforgivable curses. I haven’t asked for them to be screened for any kind of Blood Magic, because I’m not sure we need to, and because I have no idea how to even do that.”
Harry cracked an eye open, and his hand lifted from under Ursella to give Ron a middle finger salute.  “Yes, Freckles?”
But that’s not what this is, he reminds himself. Draco draws one last breath against Harry’s skin before he pulls out, and Harry’s soulmate mark burns as they part. The tea towel against his tender backside is an immediate distraction. As is the attention Draco pays him.
Worth a try.  And texting Harry was a hell of a lot faster than waiting in line for the Truro public Floo to contact Ron.  And then what, have that conversation within earshot of everyone in the Weasley kitchen?
Draco watches him, lips parted, and Harry waits for him to lean forward. Hopes he’ll lean forward. But Draco merely swallows thickly as a uniformed employee enters and begins sweeping the aisles.
Harry wasn’t sure whether he was glad he’d already seen these memories or not.  On one hand, he wasn’t surprised when Draco spit his teeth out in a sink.  On the other hand, he’d known it was coming when the memory started with Draco’s hands holding a peacock egg.
A faint dust seeped out from under the door, and she wiped it up with a finger, rubbing it against her thumb.  It felt like paper pulp.
Probably not so different from Harry wanting to check the fridge and cook dinner but not doing it. Was it moving too fast to wander into Draco’s flat and whip up dinner? They hadn’t actually talked about keying their Floos; they’d both just gone ahead and done it. Tricky, that.
Licking the last of the ice cream from the top, he began delicately working the edges of the cone with his lips and teeth. Small nips carefully removed precise sections, slowly spiraling down the cone.
Ron gasped in mock shock.  “Filthy, filthy Wizengamot.  Let’s hurry.  Gotta be at the store before noon.”
To his relief, Draco merely shrugged and scratched the stubble along Harry’s jaw.  “Human children are exceptionally freaky.  Umbilical cords.  Soft spots.  Deciduous teeth.  Macabre, really.”  He grinned and waggled Harry’s chin.  “But they smell good and are very snuggly.”
Easing back from Ron, she lifted forward up Harry’s cock and sliding Ron back into her throat.  She shut her eyes, sinking into the feeling of them both moving inside her as she rocked in short motions back and forth.  Ron slipping along her tongue, and Harry’s cock brushing nerves deep inside brought a moan from her, and Ron gasped.
The boxes were there only when he thought about them, and he seemed to be able to interact with them.  Interesting.  They were like layers of Occlumency with Legilimantic content.
Potter shuffled around his kitchen, putting seemingly random items in the rucksack.  Pot holders.  A can opener.  A handful of forks.  A corkscrew.  Tea towels.  Draco frowned.  His own kitchen was actually lacking all of those specific items.  And Harry had apparently taken inventory and made a list.  In addition to the dishes.  Those stupid, thoughtful, perfect dishes.
Leave me comments.   Please.  Holy fuck.  It's literally the only way I know anyone reads past the first chapter.
“Har, it’s inhumane.  To both of you.  I’m not saying you need to have a heart to heart about it tonight.  Especially not with me here.  But sometime soon,” Ron suggested.  “Alright?”
Narcissa’s response had been devastatingly perfect in its precision.  Falk thought he could take the Heir to the Malfoy Misfortune, make an honest man of him, and fly off into the sunset?  Oh, no, no, sweet Swedish child.  Watch your man dance.
Harry’s teeth dig into his bottom lip, and he hums as heat from Draco’s skin sinks into his groin. “Yeah?”
Doling out a generous palmful of shampoo, he replied, “Marks, rumors, and lies don’t paint much of a picture, do they?”
Long hair suited him, Harry thought.  He didn’t look as much like Lucius as he would have expected.  And Malfoy seemed to enjoy fiddling with it.
He didn’t reply, studying his hands on the bench between them, instead. She rubbed her palms up and down his thighs, keeping his attention in the room, and in the present. Forehead softly furrowed, he looked up, grey eyes a mix of emotions.
“So, you don’t have a wand.  The Ministry ward voids all magic, how do you… live?” she asked, bordering on what looked to him like actual concern.
The thumb stopped, and Harry’s back tensed.  Draco held his breath, waiting.  Harry’s hand slid up behind Draco’s head as his shoulders rose.  Their lips found each other in a slow slide of warmth and soft seeking.  A quiet, tentative, giving and receiving.  A mutual respite for consideration.
Harry lingers next to the Potter-scented nest for a bit, smiles to himself, and strips his shirt off. He rolls it into a small pillow and sets it at the edge of the cape, then pulls a scrap of paper and pencil from his pocket.
She frowned, remembering Molly asking her if Muggle women ran fevers related to sexual activity.  It would have been smart to ask questions when she’d had the opportunity, but it had all been so supremely awkward at the time.
“What?”  Draco laid flat and let the fly of his trunks pull tight around the base of his cock.  “You also didn’t think I knew what a computer-“
could stop.  Harry was having as torturously wonderful a time as he was.  Gods below, the show he’d put on in the spring this morning of slicking himself up with Draco’s shampoo had been beyond indulgent.
Malfoy caught the pity in Harry’s look.  “It’s not like they hexed me down to a table, Potter.  More of a To-Do List of tedious, but acceptable shags for a few weeks.  Till the Ministry showed up to torch Durmstrang to the fucking ground.”
Draco took a slow, quiet breath and willed the pooling tears from his eyes. Had he ever been the target of that love?
She groaned, “Mm… incorrigible.” He chuckled and pulled out. Sliding her shorts up, she leaned back to plant a kiss on his chin. Or the beard covering it. “I guess I’m going to change.”
She sighed in concentration.  “Okay,” she said resolutely.  Harry pulled again, and saw a glint of gold between her parting folds.
He twisted in mid-air and broke the fall with his face; blood blooming between his teeth like climbing roses. A shadow loomed over him, half-obscured by dancing silver spots.
, that could actually fucking happen.  But not with Granger behind bars.  He held one muffin in his teeth, tucked the leather pouch in the side of his knickers, and disappeared with a crack.
Harry’s cock presses into him, and they both sigh, chests rising and falling together. “Slow, then?”
A subtle shaking in her back alarmed him.  Fuck, was she crying?  Had he misread her groans and shouts?  Was she hurt?
The willow leaves cast gentle swaying shadows against her eyelids, lulling her. She imagined Ron turning into Arthur and back into Ron until she dozed off.
His hands loosened their grip, and she slid hers around to his hips, steadying herself.  With a long, last final suck, she pulled back, licking a single drop off the tip of him.
Hermione gulped.  This would be the part where Molly told her to stop sleeping with Harry and Malfoy and marry Ron and move into this house and spit out little Weasleys.
“I think I kind of want to apologize for scaring you,” she whispered, and licked the tip of his growing erection.  “Like this.”
Draco dropped his head back, body one long line of hard, pale flesh, soft to the touch, but hot and unyielding.
Harry gingerly sipped from his bottle.  Last night’s hangover was a doozy.  “Percy, how’s Level Six treating you?”
“Well,” Narcissa huffed indignantly, “I just think we ought to know why he suddenly wants access to…” She trailed off, leaning over to inspect the papers.  “… to our
Maybe he could have driven John away. Maybe John would have recovered if he’d rejected Harry. Maybe Harry could have saved him by breaking his heart even more than the secrecy did.
Draco cleared his throat and inhaled deeply.  “I may have been in the wrong in blaming you.”  He bit his lip, gaze intent on the center of the table.  “Possibly motivated by jealousy.”
Harry sat on a dusty office chair, taking in the tissues on the desk, and his friend’s red-rimmed eyes.
To either side is an entire wall of windows, one with dense forest immediately outside, and the other with a sweeping view of a lush valley below. A modest, if messy, kitchenette takes up the far wall, and a meticulously-organized office space next to it.
“I’ll kill you,” Draco said drolly. “His last words to his son, heir, and self-purported reason for being were, I kid you not, ‘I’ll kill you.’”
She grinned, and slid his head to her opening.  The tip fit easily, but getting the girth of his head took her hand easing one side, then the other, until the crown slid inside, passing the tight ring of muscle at her entrance.  Her whole core spasmed deliciously in response to the stretch, setting off a small orgasm.
“Really?” the boy whispers, eyes drifting up to Harry’s. Unshed tears shimmer against his lower lids, and Harry wonders how long it’s been since someone looked at this child and truly saw him.
“No, I don’t mean the case,” Ron said, sitting down at the edge of the ledge, surveying his work and choosing his words very, very carefully.  “I mean that it’s okay if you find him attractive.”
Vague recollections of green-fire curses and wailing agony echoed in Draco’s head. The healers had told him about the war, but not in detail.
Harry rolled his eyes at his mobile and snuggled back down.  “In the dreams, do you understand the twins’ language?  It’s weird.”
The other trick was to spend as long as possible flipping them, so he could forget why he was all dressed up and holding a Portkey.  It had been a while, and he figured it was about time to put on a show.  The Malfoy Heir Song and Dance.
He had a best mate, a best girl, a boyfriend, and realized maybe it didn’t matter how Draco would have answered his question yesterday about dating.  He arranged a hasty tray of tea, lost in his own thoughts.  Draco didn’t seem eager to be out on the prowl.
With a strained gulp, a deep breath, and a flick of his wrist, the sheet snapped back to reveal the top half of the body.  She didn’t jump up and screech at him immediately, so he relaxed just a bit.  Her hands lay next to her on the cot, and he turned her right palm over to inspect her fingertips.  Sticky.
“Blimey, but that’s direct.” Ron sputtered.  “It would be like her to have an actual application process.  Series of interviews.  Maybe a proficiency test.”  He snorted at the mental image of her issuing marks and “needs improvement” stamps on naked men.
Harry still knelt on the bed, Draco’s face lost under Harry’s ass, neck straining with his movement.  Draco’s shoulders were propped on one elbow as the other hand held the head of Harry’s cock loosely, not moving.
“Yeah, I suppose.”  Ron agreed before continuing.  “Blood Magic is what all the wars were over.  Basically.  I do know that much.”
The bed glows in the sun; a white comforter heaped at the foot, white sheets, white pillowcases, and a pallid, nude body curled around the dog. Her tail thumps against the mattress as Harry approaches, and her front paws scoot forward, eager for attention.
