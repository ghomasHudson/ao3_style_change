Harry wished he had the energy to roll his eyes. "I don't want to talk about my nightmares. If I have to relive them whilst I'm conscious then I don't know how I'm going to deal with it. I don't even think I can write them down for you. They hurt too much to even think about. They frighten me so much, that if I tell you, I'm afraid you'll judge me."
Pansy furrowed her brow, looking between her blonde friend and then over to Potter who was conversing with Granger and Weasley most likely about something to do with their current workload, which had double in the last couple of weeks. She hummed to herself, "Well I suppose you could. Is it a date, or just to hang out together?"
There were no objections and so within a few moments Harry found himself walking alongside Lord Malfoy, feeling as inferior as humanly possible, as they walked out on the outskirts of the garden of the hotel. They walked in silence for a little while and with no champagne flute in his hand to distract him and fumble with, Harry felt a little more vulnerable than he had been for the entire trip so far. "Now Mister Potter, I know that you did in fact say something that upset Draco last night and I would like to enquire as to what it was."
Harry turned onto his side and propped his head up with his arm, "Why
When he pulled away Harry was breathless as he slid down the stone wall and onto his knees. He tugged Draco's trousers down and pulled the blonde's cock out of his boxers and took it into his mouth. It was awkward at first, but once they found a rhythm it felt amazing as Draco leaned forward against the wall and reveled in the burning wet heat of Harry's throat.
Turning back to the bed, he tugged the cool duvet back and slid into the bed with ease, wriggling in discomfort a little, before grabbing the television remote from the white bedside table and began clicking through the channels of the free-view T.V. that sat perched high on the wall. He really wanted to get the healing salve he had brought with them but he really did not want to disturb Harry whilst he was showering. The thought of watching the water running over his bone-thin lover made his stomach knot.
Draco smiled gently up at him, "After father's will was read out and his belongings divided between the benefactors, it turns out that I got this ring. It is a family heirloom passed from generation to generation. This is my way of promising you that you are not alone in any of this anymore. I will be here by your side no matter what happens. I have seen you at your worst and, even though it took some time, I am still here ten years on and I still love you. I want to be with you for the rest of my life, Harry James Potter, and by accepting this ring, you are declaring that you will love me for the rest of your life and will stay by my side for as long as we both shall live. You are my husband and with this ring, I am declaring that you are officially part of my family. Forever more."
He opted to run out and grab some take-away food. Then they could go straight to their apartment and eat it in front of the T.V. they weren't that far from home by this point, anyway. Only about twenty minutes or so. He pulled into a parking-lot outside of the huge, brightly lit florescent McDonalds and nudged Harry awake from his nap.
Harry blinked. He hadn't exactly been expecting such a response. He would have expected the need for more details, so why was Draco focusing on his age? "Um ... Yeah you know when my birthday was ... is."
Harry hummed lazily and burrowed closer to the blonde's chest. He felt so comfortable. He wished he could have this moment for more than just a few scattered nights during the month. "Didn't mean to leave you on your own," he whispered gently.
Harry couldn't hide the flush that crept up onto his cheeks as he followed Draco along a maze of marble corridors and towards his bedchamber. His bedchamber was dimly lit by two tall narrow windows on the wall opposite the four poster bed and the large ornate desk pressed up in the wall space between them. Walking over to the large wardrobe with wide oak doors, Harry watched as the tall blonde shifted through its contents before pulling out a few bags that contained beautiful dress robes that Harry found his mouth hanging open at the mere sight of them. A few maids wandered into the room and all too soon Harry found himself on a small stood having the smallest of the three dress robes, pinned and altered around his shorter frame and numerous jittering instructions to tell him that he needed to stop moving about. Harry watched as amused smirks played on Draco's lips as he sat in a chair and watched it all with delight playing in his grey eyes.
Potter snorted with far too much confidence for a scar-headed idiot, and smirked up at the blonde, "Bring it on Malfoy!" he jeered loud enough for passers-by to hear. And so the challenge really begun with several eye-witnesses.
Despite the shortness of the letter itself, only taking up about half a sheet of paper, Draco had found himself unable to stop smiling when he'd first read it and even now as he read it on the train home many years later it still brought a wistful smile to his lips. It must have been very dull at Severus' house with nothing to do all day for three and a half months straight. He also wanted to cry a little. The hopeful note in Harry's words had struck chords within him he hadn't known were there until that letter was open.
"Did you plan any of this?" Harry breathed softly.
Draco glared up at the dark-haired man from over his shoulder before guiding his gaze back to the swirling amber liquid in his glass. "Don't taunt me with your jibes, I want to know what the bloody hell you think you're doing, just wondering in here at this time of night and thinking you own the goddamn place!"
Nuzzling his face into Harry's damp neck he suddenly felt his eyes burn with the promise of tears, "Forgive me, Harry," he panted in his ear, his sweat cooling on his skin as he shivered lightly. He squeezed the younger man tighter and pressed a kiss to his forehead, "I'm sorry. I ruined you!"
Harry shrugged, "That's the problem. I have this whole new life, and a whole new take on it to come to terms with. A year on and I'm still struggling. I haven't even thought about what I want to do."
Staring up at the ceiling, Draco drew in deep slow breaths, focusing purely on Harry's touch.
He didn't know if Potter did masturbate, but something was making him far too tense and it was getting ridiculous, seeing the tendons in his neck throbbing with suppressed anger and, no doubt, fear.
He snatched his lovers hand in his own and drew it to his lips, "Hey, hey, it's alright. I'm here okay? I'm not going anywhere just yet. I know you tried. I'm glad that you tried." He leaned over and cupped Harry's face in his hand and stroked his thumb over the bristled cheek, "I'm
The silence was nothing but a smothering darkness that seemed to seep into Draco's mouth and nostrils, slinking down to flood his lungs and stomach making him feel empty and desperate for air. He clung even tighter to Harry his dry eyes burning with raw emotion. "I know, baby, I know," Draco hushed with a trail of furious kisses along Harry's narrow throat. He heard a soft moan as Harry arched his neck against the hot mouth pressing upon his skin.
Without a backwards glance to his friends, Harry followed the blonde man out of the Great Halls and out onto the frosty grounds, the grass crisp and crunchy under their feet. The chill in the air made their breath rise up in front of them but he couldn't deny that he was glad for the escape from the Great Hall. His heart was still stuttering in his chest at the fact that Draco was the one to provide the reprieve, as he'd previously wanted to keep their friendship to themselves. He was glad that Draco was becoming more confident with their friendship, despite how he had often dreamed that maybe they would be able to grow even closer.
Harry was still quite tense as Draco leaned further in between his legs, breathing heavily against his skin. "There's still a chance to turn back from this, you know?" he murmured gruffly.
Unfortunately for Potter, Draco was on point on the morning before the First Task as he brushed by Potter rather forcefully and quickly hissed in his ear, "Since you're such a Quidditch player maybe you'd fancy a ride on my broom?"
Instead of staring at him like he had last time, Draco was left speechless as Potter grabbed his wrist and thrust into his hand. "Oh Malfoy, I'd let you handle my wand any day."
He took a while before he inhaled deeply, the tremors fading slightly. Harry did not relinquish his soothing caresses, for which Draco was immensely grateful. He reveled in the sandy smell that clung to Harry's shirt and the warmth that clung to his lover's soft, smooth skin.
Draco gave a wry little smile, his first in ages it would seem, "Maybe I wanted to see if staying here could make me feel the magic again. But there doesn't seem to be any hope for me in the regard. Not sure I even know what happiness or merriment is anymore. Or if I ever did in the first place."
Harry turned to look up at the expressionless man and felt weak at the prospect that he certainly had indeed insulted Draco into not attending that evening. "Forgive me, Lord Malfoy, I had merely stated that I could see that he was wearing make-up to conceal how run down he was looking at the waxy quality of his skin and naturally he seems to have not appreciated such comments on my part."
The silence reigned between them as the ticking of the clock on the mantel grew ever louder between them. It was Draco who finally broke the silence, his voice tight and cold unlike it had been the other night. "I see my father managed to cajole you into keeping me preoccupied while he goes about his political drivel."
"They're arseholes who would gain more publicity by a brave organized rescue mission for Harry rather than admit that they were so negligent that he decided to leave of his own free will!" Hermione snorted, clearly not believing a word that was coming out of his mouth, "just go, please? We have a lot to do today"
Guilt pinched lightly at Harry's heart as he drank in Draco's words, slightly muffled as they were through the fog in his mind. His throat felt tight and dry as he looked as the small meal Draco had prepared for the both of them and instantly he felt bad for taking on longer shifts as the hospital just so that he would be too busy to think about anything other than the matter at hand. He had been running himself ragged and he knew it. It was only when he saw Draco's angelic if slightly damp features that he felt that annoying pinch of his guilt in his chest. It twinged and would soon burn up throughout his chest by the end of the evening. He looked up at Draco and forced another tight little smile. "You honestly didn't have to go through all this trouble just for me," he managed to rasp out as his blonde companion poured him a goblet of smooth, light wine and he sipped at it. His throat instantly felt better. He winced inwardly as Draco pressed his lips against his hair and the warmth spread down through his temples.
"Is that what made it so easy for you to do it?" Draco murmured softly. "The fact that you had mentally numbed yourself to the world you loved, psychologically erasing everyone and everything that meant something to you so that the last thing you would see was Him -the man you had all this unfinished business with. Did that make it easier for you to die?" His eyes refocused so that he could look at Harry properly.
He had missed it; snuggling up with Harry on the sofa in front of the television, program or not program to fill the whispering silence that encircled them. He pressed his warm mouth against Harry's bald head and then rested his head against the back of the sofa and closed his eyes to sleep.
"Not until next week. Next?"
He felt shivers running through him as he watched Harry lower himself down onto his knees and spread his pale thighs open even wider. He let out a shuddering sound when he felt the hot wetness of Harry's tongue sliding over his nether regions and slipping between his buttocks. He tried to relax his muscles and keep his breathing in time to the gentle licks that danced over his cock, scrotum and then his puckered entrance. He could feel himself started to sweat already and grimaced at himself. He had done this to Harry countless times, had the younger man ever been this tense?
"I decided to come back," Harry murmured, twirling his wand around in his lap again. "To be honest, if I didn't who else would've had the balls enough to kill him?"
Draco peered around the banister to make sure that no one was watching, before pulling his wand out of his sleeve and casting a weightless charm on Harry's body, "up you get, scarhead, time for bed" Looping an arm underneath Harry's body, Draco hauled the younger man to his feet and helped to guide him up the staircases to their room. Harry did not protest as he was guided.
And with that last final thought, Harry let the darkness engulf him, praying that he would remain on the lakebed where he belonged.
Bracing himself on Draco's raised knees, Harry continued to piston himself inside Draco's body, sweat running in rivets down his tanned body. He had to keep refocusing his attention on getting Draco off too. His lungs didn't seem able to hold any air; it was like he was sucking fire down his throat. He was starting to see stars, and judging from the way those silver eyes were rolling back in Draco's head, he was teetering on the edge too.
Through a shaking sigh of relief –it was always hard to read but it hadn't been as grotesque and frightening as his mind had made out –Draco replaced the letter inside the envelope and then slipped it to the back of the pile before picking up the next one and slipping it out.
"Well initially I had meant to start two years ago but due to my mother's poor health I had to postpone until this year. I have only been with him a few months, since January, so not too long really. However, in my last review he did mention that I have progressed a great deal more past the others and he feels that I may be able to take on a few more duties once we return back to Calais." He turned to look Draco up and down and didn't know why he found himself surprised at the expensive cut of his dress robes and the expensive snake signet rink adorning his pale finger. "What is it that you do? Have you ever thought to study under your godfather and learn the trade of being a Healer?"
Harry looked up in surprise before a look of utter adoration melted onto his features, "you -you don't have to, you know."
Standing outside in the cold corridor and clenching his fingers into fists over and over, Harry looked up at the door with its charred frame and blackened wood. He was surprised some of the magic was still intact considering the cursed Fiendfyre that had disintegrated almost everything within. Drawing in a deep breath he turned the doorknob slowly, straining his ears for the sounds of rusted iron grating, or even that of approaching footsteps. There was nothing but the drumming of his own heartbeat. With a deep breath he pushed the door inwards and stepped inside.
The silence was deafening.
Draco shook his head, hesitating briefly, before edging his way over to the armchair that was bedside Harry's bed. With the way their relationship had been going lately he didn't think it would be wise for him to slip into the bed like he desperately wanted to. He gave his own disapproving frown at Harry and nodded towards the oil lamp and the book in his lap, "You need to sleep at night, Harry. You've been running yourself ragged for weeks and I'm scared that you're doing yourself more harm than good." He sank down into the armchair and pressed his back into the soft cushioned back, his hooded eyes peering over at the dark haired man.
"Stop it!" he heard Granger shout at desperately, "Stop it all of you! Professor do something!"
Draco, who had been ready just to kick back with a mug of tea in front of the TV, was suddenly hardwired and pressing up against his tightening trousers. "Don't keep me waiting, Potter," he growled.
He waited for the anger to cloud his mind over, but nothing happened. He waited and waited but the only thing that grew was the headache behind his eyes. Why couldn't he get angry about the whole thing? '
"Draco, this chocolate nemesis is gorgeous!" Harry moaned as he devoured his chocolate cake greedily. Draco grinned brightly as he watched Harry's old appetite wake-up within his lover.
After they had gotten something to eat in a small cafe, they crossed the road to wait for a tram to travel up to North Pier. They would have walked but Harry had started to look a little weary. They were reluctant to let Seeker onto the transport however Draco explained that due to some of Harry's 'conditions' Seeker was needed to alert them when near a certain type of magnetic equipment. With a frown the ticket-marshal had nodded and allowed it. It was a load of crap but as it had gotten Seeker onto the tram, Draco decided to remember the tale as much as possible.
The ride into Hogsmeade passes by quite quietly and soon the carriage pulled to a stop at the edge of town. They settled for just milling around the shops for the most part, sharing sarcastic jokes and lightly taunting one another merrily. It was just when they were settling down in the Three Broomsticks -much to some surrounding Gryffindor's chagrin -that Harry remembered the tonic in his pocket. As soon as they'd ordered their lunch and some drinks, he reached into his pocket and handed the phial to Draco. "What's this?" the blonde asked with a frown.
After the initial shock wavered a little, the two moved forth into the hall and took a seat at the far end of the Gryffindor table, right under the professor's noses. All eyes were on them, the hush in the hall was startling. Nothing seemed to move. That's when someone moved -or rather, two people moved. Hermione and Ron stood up from the middle of the Gryffindor table and edged down the aisle, and after a few hushed words, settled down opposite Draco and Harry.
Once he was dressed he went over to the hair-dryer to dry his hair and couldn't help but notice Harry watching him in the mirror. "I really miss having hair," Harry stated as he stood up and ran a hand absently through Draco's damp locks. "I miss you teasing it, curling it, tugging it ... even washing it for me."
Harry chuckled. It was a sweet sound. The waves whispered in front of them, frothing weakly upon the sand. "I love you, Draco," he breathed against the shell of Draco's ear.
Harry frowned. That hadn't been an answer he'd been expecting. Surely he should be encouraged to get all of his education and a job afterwards. Why was Draco saying the opposite? "Um ... Why do you say that?"
"Oh would you just shut up for one moment, Potter, and not be a total arsehole for once this year!" Draco sneered, suddenly not in the mood to be joked at. His fingers clutched his glass tighter as he sighed and dropped his head into his free hand. "Where have you been 'till this hour? It's far too late."
Draco shook his head with a smile, "Oh, Mister Potter, I should tell you that I never lower myself to making compromises," he stated and then bit his tongue when he saw the downward turn of Harry's smile, "But," he continued in a light tone, "I am more than willing to say you've convinced me to thinking that there may be something to it. So yes, it does sound fair to me."
Draco nodded in understanding, "I do not wish to lose correspondence with you, Harry. You seem to be one of very few people who don't bore me … How did you put it? Into a coma?" Harry nodded with an abashed smiled and Draco returned it before sipping from his flute, "Would you write to me when you are not too busy studying for your exams?"
As he lifted himself over to the edge of his bed he couldn't help but feel nervous, his muscles tensing and beginning to dampen with sweat. He flexed his fingers and stared down at his bare knees as they peeked out from underneath his nightshirt. He was really worried about getting caught wondering around at such an early hour, toward Harry's bedchamber no less. It wasn't as though he was in his twenties again, he was nearing his forties and he needed to watch himself around his parents. Severus was alright, the man tolerated more than he let on, but Draco didn't want to encourage a lecture from the older man, especially concerning the misplaced rumours that had first circulated when he and Harry had not only gone into business together, but opted to share an apartment together. To anyone who asked, they lied and said that there was more than enough room for two people to live side-by-side comfortably without invading on one another's space. In reality, they simply used the smaller bedroom for extra storage.
Perhaps that was all he'd needed.
Draco snorted as he took a sip of his pumpkin juice. Narcissa seemed to ignore him but Severus had been scrutinizing the both of them since Friday night when they had both arrived. He knew that something was going on between them, and he'd be damned if he wasn't going to get to the bottom of it. He cleared his throat and in his usual lazy drawl, addressed Harry. "Forgive me, Harry, but August is rarely the time for such things. Usually such madness occurs in October but rarely earlier. I'm sure you can spare a week or two to relax and decompress your mind. I know I needed some time to myself. You look as though you're about to faint. You clearly haven't been resting and by the looks of it Draco could be on the verge of an illness very soon," his words may have been slow and drawn out on purpose, but the gasp and widening of Narcissa's eyes happened instantly.
He blanched, "You really think there'd be back lash if I asked him?"
Could he do it? he wondered as he stroked the smooth wood and shifted his feet closer to Seeker's warmth radiating from the other end of the sofa. Maybe he could. He would need a distraction. The empty apartment was a constant reminder of the long, agonizing months away from his beautiful, beloved Harry.
," he choked out as he dropped his head down onto his weak arms folded awkwardly under his body. He could feel hot tears mingling with the greasy lake water trickling out of his wet hair. He shivered as he gasped for air and pounded his fists into the wood again. It should have been him. They should have fished him out last, or better yet even left him down there on the lakebed to get strangled by the slimy black weeds. They should have fished him out last, or better yet even left him down there on the lakebed to get strangled by the slimy black weeds. He shouldn't be allowed to
The boy across from him hummed and jerked his head at the door, "Well Pansy's here. Bitch to her. She might have some more information for you anyways."
Harry shook his head, "To be honest, I'm sort of glad that it's you who knows and not the others." He dropped his head forward and twirled his wand around, "I've just been thinking a lot about exams and graduation. I can't help but feel it's all so pointless."
"How come?" Theo asked.
He shook his head suddenly aware that he had been standing in Snape's doorway and was staring over at him with his dark features drawn into a frown. He cleared his throat and looked Snape dead in the eye, "Don't worry, Professor. I have learned my lesson from Arthur Weasley and I can assure you that my friendship with Draco Malfoy will not affect how I treat him as a patient."
As soon as Draco was ready he grabbed a light jacket and opened the door for Harry to walk out. The staircase was a little narrow so the blond man followed his lover as they descended the four staircases to the lobby. Oli and Cass were looking after Seeker for the evening, for which they were thankful.
Harry swallowed thickly before sighing and gingerly placing his wand on the floor, the hairs on his neck standing up on end as he straightened up, Malfoy's glare and wand still aimed at him, burning through him, and making him flush. "I wasn't stalking you, Malfoy," he finally stated, his stomach flipping as the lie left his lips. "I couldn't sleep. How was I to know you'd be in here?" Malfoy clearly had no answer for that, so Harry drew in a deep breath and took a step closer. Malfoy's wand arm readjusted, the wand aiming at Harry's head now, "Malfoy ... Why were you crying?"
Without a backwards glance, he turned and fled from the classroom.
When the sound of panicked footsteps rushed up behind him, creaking on the floorboards, and the door slamming loudly in its frame, he flipped around in his chair ready to shout at whoever it was when he felt his chest loosen a little and his heart to calm down. "What the bloody hell do
Blaise nodded, "We might as well before the Weaslette decides to make a scene. At least this way they can have some more support."
"Like you were complaining," Potter ground out, "Come on, let's finish this."
Only a couple of more stops until the train reached the terminal in Brittany central. It had taken a lot to convince Narcissa and Lucius that going into business with Draco was better if they started somewhere well-known but not as raw and open as Paris. They needed to start small just in case that it didn't work out, then at least not many of their social circles in Paris would know about it, only rumours. When faced with this predicament, it was only a matter of a couple of weeks before Draco's inheritance had been signed over, secreted in several discreet banks. Harry had been made to swear an oath that unless it was stated so in Draco's will, he had no say or claim over what happened with the blonde man's money. Luckily for everyone involved, Harry had made a decent amount of his own small fortune as a Healer and also brewing potions for some of his own private clients, those of which were now clients assigned to their apothecary. It was also a huge improvement that the apothecary came with a large apartment right above it, so finding somewhere to live hadn't been a struggle for either one of them. Draco had taken a little while to adapt to the smaller size of the place, but after a while he decided he preferred a 'cosy' home than a large, empty one.
He shivered suddenly, though he did not feel cold at all. He did not feel anything, if he was being painfully honest with himself. Every day both indoors and out, he had slowly felt the life being sucked out of him, as though there were a dementor lingering around every corner but refusing to show itself. He reached up over the cabinet for the light switch. He wasn't in the mood for 'light' but he would need it if he was going to read or write anything. He flicked the light-switch and winced as the offensive light momentarily blinded him.
A weight settled heavily in his stomach.
Draco made him another mug of chicken noodle soup, and let him watch the television, whilst he packed everything with a flick of his wand, and added a weightless charm so that it would be easier to carry everything to the car. He decided to leave Seeker behind. Harry could bring him out once he drove around to the front of the hotel. He pressed one last lingering kiss to Harry's lips before leaving the hotel room.
Eventually Harry
Harry tip-toed up and pressed a kiss to Draco's lips, "there's no rush, take your time."
As soon as the realization settled like an iron weight in his chest, he choked on a few strangled sobs before wrapping his arms tightly around him and bowing his head. He was cold and shaking and wished more than anything to be wrapped up warm. But he knew that if he even dreamed of venturing to go to the dorms early he'd be ridiculed even further for not being manly enough.
Draco was only too happy to oblige, with the aid of a slender ash cane, and soon he was walking around with Harry through the hush of green grass in the manicured manor gardens and loved the feel of the sunshine adding a gentle flush to his pale, waxy skin. He looked almost angelic as they strolled along the pathways, his chiselled features gleaming in the afternoon light. Harry forced himself to look away, not wanting to be caught staring. He didn't think that the blonde had noticed, but he had. Conversation didn't stray from having tea with his mother a few days prior and the upcoming exams that Harry was almost certain that he would fail. As soon as they came to a stop underneath the shade of some blossoms trees, the cool air surfing off the top of the pond soothing their heated skin, Draco rested down among the knotted roots on top of the blanket Harry had brought with him and opened his book in his lap. Harry mirrored his movements. "You're going to do fine you know?" Draco stated after half an hour of silent reading, as he glanced sideways at Harry, their shoulders so close to brushing against one another.
Harry whipped around, his hand straying to his wand. Draco couldn't help but feel and no doubt look hurt. His brain screamed 'WAR WAR WAR!' and he knew it was right, but it didn't matter. How could Harry regard him as a threat so easily? Harry relaxed when he saw that it was Draco and offered a weak smile, "Sorry about that," he mumbled. He looked around them and then stepped out of the way of the door, dragging Draco back along with him. The blonde's breath hitched as Harry's fingers lingered on his wrist. His skin prickled and burned pleasantly at the contact, but before he could indulge himself, the hand was gone. "Did you need to speak to me about something?" he asked gently.
"I just wanted a holiday, is that so bad?" Harry's voice broke and cracked sharply in Draco's ear as he gently rocked his lover against his chest. He knew the holiday was not Harry's idea, but he was pleased to know that Harry wanted the holiday instead of feeling as though he had forced the younger man.
"It was definitely different."
He glanced down at the book in his hand; an old time favourite of his and well-read if the dog-eared pages were anything to go by. Harry had scowled at the condition of the book and told Draco to use a bookmark. That had been the morning before they went down to Brighton for the weekend. Seeker had enjoyed it -bounding along the beach and harassing the sea-gulls. He and Harry had thoroughly enjoyed chasing after him. One of the tokens of that mini-break was now staring him right in the face; there, wedged in the place he had last stopped reading, was the white framed strip of photographs taken in one of the muggle photo-booths.
And that chapter included Harry at all costs.
Stepped up so that they were a few inches part, Harry moaned low in his throat. "Well ... it was our twelfth date and you didn't want me to go home so ..."
He was so absorbed in his own thoughts that he didn't hear the footsteps coming up the spiral staircase, or approach him across the stone balcony. He wasn't even aware of the other person until a hand rested on his shoulder and he lurched around, his eyes wide and wand jabbing into the shin of the sneak. "Merlin, don't do that!" he hissed out as his heart skipped a beat before calming down in his chest.
Draco released his cock with a soft 'pop' and crawled up Harry's body and spread his naked thighs on either side of his lover's. He ground their erections together as Harry's nails raked ridges down his back. He arched heavily into the clawing and felt heat pool heavily between their bodies. "Draco -I -I want to -b-be in you," he rasped as he thrust his cock against Draco's abdomen.
However, now it would appear that said cause for Draco's own happiness was suffering and there didn't seem to be anything he could readily do to help him.
Draco nodded his head and couldn't help a small smile grace his lips as he fingered his glass and sipped at it, "Despite everything back then I kept them, mainly to track your progress and see how things were doing, what topics I should avoid until you were a little stronger and new and interesting things that I'd need or want to ask about at a later date."
Harry had fallen asleep in the Passenger seat a while ago, as had Seeker in the backseat, his paw dangling just over the seats edge, the sunlight catching in his golden fur. The car was peaceful as a radio station playing out the muggle top hits of the week softly into the atmosphere around them. The traffic had not been too bad and Draco prayed that the good weather would last for the remainder of the long weekend. He hadn't stirred up just a fuss for them to be cooped up in a hotel room for a few days.
Draco let out a humourless laugh, "Yeah sorry about that. But I've healed you and there shouldn't be any scarring. I learned it from Severus, so if there is any scarring it should be minimal."
"And what is exactly is your reasoning behind this?" Draco snapped, "if he wants to leave he had every right to. You have no right to speak for him!"
Harry rolled his eyes and kicked his shoes off to get a little more comfortable. Their legs touched and they were squished fairly close together in the armchair. The tension was back but Harry tried to ignore it as they continued to talk about everything and nothing, their hands brushing and chests colliding every now and again. The evening was slowly passing them by and it got to the point where Harry was feeling worn out from a long day. He was glad that the next morning he had a free period, so he could sleep in as late as he wanted. He didn't realise he was nodding off until he felt a warm arm wrap around his shoulders and cuddle him a little closer against a strong, firm chest. He hummed and blinked in surprise, "Oh gosh I'm sorry," he mumbled, trying to pull away but Draco wouldn't budge. He held him fast and continued the soft carding of his fingers through his hair.
There was nothing wrong with what he'd done. According to the textbook he had brewed it perfectly. So why hadn't it worked?
? Why? What sort of world would it be without Draco in it? There was no reason for
As soon as Draco had prepped Harry enough with three fingers slipping all the way up to the knuckle, he released Harry with a wet pop and smirked as Harry gasped and looked down at him. Draco smirked, "Are you ready, Harry?" he growled in a husky voice before nipping at the brunette's thighs.
The blonde man nodded, "I know, Harry," he murmured as he looked up, "I know."
Harry knew though. Deep down they both knew exactly how the other felt. And it didn't scare either of them like it should've done.
Harry nodded, "yes, because at least at home we can both fit into our lovely claw-footed bath-tub."
you decide to be on the bottom tonight? Usually you just take charge."
It was on this evening when Draco had been faced with shutting up the shop on his own and had looked forward to eating some cold cuts –another thing Harry had gotten him into –and then collapsing into bed. He hadn't been expecting to open the door to their apartment and find a fat candle perched on almost every available flat service, flickering in the cool October breeze that drifted in through a crack under the windowpane. His mouth had hung open in surprise, something he never would have dared to do if his father had been in the vicinity, and gaped at the room that was bathed in the golden light. Harry stood there in absolutely nothing. He was stark naked, with soft shadows rolling over his stomach and chest muscles. He'd felt his knees go weak beneath him as he drank in every inch of his handsome lover. "Harry," he breathed in awe, "What are you up to?" he couldn't help the smile that teased at his lips, his breathing coming out in short, rasping spurts.
He ground his teeth together as Draco awkwardly edged into one of the long boats, Harry clumsily shifting in behind him and taking the oars offered to him by an older man on the pier who then gently eased the boat out onto the water with his foot. It took a little while for him to work out how to row the oars but soon their boat was gliding out into the beautiful glassy surface of the lake, reflecting the bright blue of the sky and the vibrant greenery spiking out from the river banks and drifting down from the willow trees. Dappled by the sunlight, it really was a beautifully tranquil place to glide through on a lazy afternoon. The water trickled gently as he dipped the oars up and down through the glassy grey surface. He couldn't keep the darkness from swirling in his chest when he glimpsed over his shoulder and watched as Draco leaned over the edge of the boat, trailing his fingers through the rippling water as they glided along. A shiver ran through him as he steered the boat along. He didn't realise that the boat had veered off towards a deeper stream that branched off around an island, their boat and bodies becoming shaded by the dense willow branches entangled overhead.
"You're Harry fucking Potter. You're going to come out of it." He raked a hand through his blonde hair, trying not to let any of his emotions show. He was anxious and worried but he couldn't show Harry that. He flinched a little when Harry reached over and pressed a gentle kiss to his cheek.
Harry nodded and felt his heart skip in his chest, "Till death do us part, my love."
Three hours later he was forced back into the world of reality by dry hands sharply smacking him across the face and a deafening scream vibrating through his skull. It wasn't until he was more awake did he realise that the screaming was coming from him. After one final slap he felt the scream die in his throat and slowly began to feel the rest of his body awaken. He was drenched in his own sweat and the sky was darkening outside. He felt his body spasm as he rolled over the edge of the bed and dry heaved. His neck muscles strained and he could feel the evening breeze chill the sweat over his body. Nothing came up his throat, despite the burning sensation, and he felt a hot hand pounding his back until he'd stopped gagging on his own saliva and curled up onto his side, tucking his throbbing head between his arms. He swallowed and tried to get his breathing steady again. He swallowed and tried to get his breathing steady again. "Harry what the hell is going on?" Severus snapped as he whipped away from the bed and bent low beside the balcony door and picked up the discarded phial. "You took dreamless sleep?" he asked as he sniffed the empty phial. His dark eyes fastened on Harry slumped over in the bed on his side, his skin waxy and his eyes red and bloodshot. "You stupid fool!" he spat out, throwing the phial out of the window. "I told you to get some proper rest, not delude your body! That potion will only make you worse! You need natural sleep you moron! I can't believe I even trained you up to be a healer when you can't even see that you're endangering yourself and all the patients in your care!" He was snarling now but he didn't care. The satisfaction he was getting from seeing the younger man flinch and cower at his words was only too gratifying. He strode over and loomed over the shattered man before him and sneered, "And what about Draco, Potter?" he spat out, "Do you regard him so lowly that you would rather kill him than admit to yourself and to me, that you're not well?"
Draco shrugged a stiff shoulder, "Those letters, I think. I read them and realised just how one-sided our relationship had been before that summer and I just –felt –like I needed to let you take the lead once in a while. More often than before at the very least."
' tucked under his blankets to find some really cheesy chat-up lines to use on Malfoy the next moment he got the blonde alone.
Draco was left standing there, shivering and confused. He raised Potter's shirt to his cheek and felt how soft it was. He quickly slipped it on, revelling in the warmth still clinging to every stitch and shuddered. It was the closest he had gotten to a hug in months. He hugged his arms around his middle and bent his nose to inhale the scent on the collar before he snapped himself out of his musings, gathered his sodden jumper out of the sink before slipping out of the bathroom and heading towards the dungeons, replaying what had just happened over and over in his head.
He strayed back from everyone else on the way to the carriages; it chipped away at his heart at the amount of students who could now see the Thestrals and were in awe at staring up at them. He turned away from them, not wanting to look at them. As he moved along the line of carriages people turned their heads away and whispered in hushed voices. Eventually he had to surrender himself to getting into a carriage with a bunch of third years that, thankfully, ignored him for the entire journey up to the castle.
Draco pursed his lips together in thought. How long had it been going on? He wasn't too sure because at first it had only been a couple of nights a week and he could easily brush that to the back of his mind, or simply explain it away, as Harry had done. When he first did notice it, it was virtually too late anyway. By that point Harry only came home 'early' on two nights a week. Not too long after that it had gotten later and later until he just didn't bother coming home until Draco was asleep. It had gotten rather lonely; falling asleep alone before Harry got home and waking up alone when Harry had scurried off to work, earlier and earlier every morning until Draco calculated that he only got around four hours of sleep at night. Did he take nap breaks at the hospital? He must have done, otherwise by any logical means he would have had a breakdown by now. Clearing his throat he mumbled, "A couple of months, I think."
"See that he does," she said, as she inclined her head with a firm look before turning on her heel and walking out of the castle. Harry watched her go and only relaxed when she had disappeared down the stairs. His shoulders slumped a little as he waited for Draco to come back to the entrance hall and start the date.
He groaned and cracked an eyelid open the fire burning low and keeping his body from freezing over completely. His body felt heavy and his brain felt as though it was spinning inside his skull. Something was warm and draped over his body and he curled onto his side and into a ball. Then he felt something cool stroke his fringe out of his eyes and realized, with a jolt, why everything was blurry. Someone had taken his glasses off and placed them somewhere safe ... safer than on his face.
"We could always sleep naked if you prefer," Harry replied slyly as he turned over onto his back and smoothed his hands down his front and watched as Draco's molten grey eyes followed their trail.
"Don't be sorry, Harry," he murmured against the raven-haired boys' forehead, "You can sleep a little longer. It's only eleven."
Harry eyed Draco for a moment but could not suppress his smile any longer. He grinned and nodded and melted as Draco pulled him against his chest and pressed a warm kiss to his forehead, before the continued on their way to the restaurant.
Draco wasn't aware that he was crying until a choked sob sounded out through his mouth. He sobbed and choked and cupped his hands over his mouth because every emotion possible came flooding to his head. Of all things, he didn't think Harry would ever do such a thing, especially if anyone were to find either of the rings. The risks were too great, the catastrophe it would cause would force them both into exile, or even a prison, and they would lose everything they'd worked so hard to get. He knew it all, it took a while to sink in, but he did. And yet –when he looked into Harry's gleaming green eyes, his toned naked body, and that simple band of pure gold lying in a velvet box, he couldn't help but feel every part of him go weak, almost as though he was suddenly floating in the air. Wiping roughly at his face he dropped himself onto his knees in front of Harry, his cane clattering to the floor as he cupped Harry's face in his hands and started pressing warm, wet kissed against his lips, brow and cheeks and nipping at his throat and mouth. "I'll be your husband Harry! I will, I will, I will!" he gushed through wet sobs as he pressed himself against Harry, their arms snaking around one another and clinging to one another as much as they could. He pulled away, his head dropping down against Harry's shoulder, "W-what am I supposed to do? I can't wear it around all day. Mother would get suspicious."
His bed was calling to him and he was desperate to answer that call after such a long horrible day. He wanted to change into warm, dry clothes and curl up with a book in front of the small fireplace in the lounge area of his apartment. He took his pocket watch out of his waistcoat pocket and grimaced at the time. He hadn't realised how late it had gotten but then it did make sense with how dark the sky had gotten so quickly. As the wheels creaked and chattered along the cobblestone road, he felt his fingers itch to slip another letter out of his satchel and read it to take his mind off the long journey still to be had. He finally sighed and berated himself as he dug around in his satchel and unfolded a letter out, peering closely to see it in the blooming light of the streetlamps. He swallowed thickly and began to read.
Harry peered up over the top of where he was over-checking some of his work and frowned heavily, "No, nothing's bothering me why do you think there is?"
Draco snorted, "Minister Fudge was supposedly a professional! So was Umbridge, apparently! And they did was use their power to screw us all over!"
He cuddled Harry even tighter.
Despite Severus' words Harry didn't feel any better. He slept a little more than he had been and he was able to keep the older man's suspicions at bay for the most part. He forced himself to eat a little more despite how sickly he felt afterwards and he refused to go near any alcohol, even at dinner. He had been shaking with nerves and withdrawal for the first couple of days, but with nothing else to focus on except his own health. Severus for his part was making sure that Draco and Harry were spending as much time together without seeming too suspicious. At first Harry had simply thought it was coincidence, but the more time he spent with Draco the more the nightmares cropped up to the surface. Sometimes it simply got too much and he would run up to his bedchamber and lock the door behind him. He'd shake and whimper and scream into his pillow until his head was throbbing with red hot pain that it made him slip completely into his nightmare. It was a never ending cycle.
They walked in silence for a little while before they decided to settle down on the grassy banks and dig out their textbooks just to have something to do. They stayed that way for the rest of their lunch break, only moving and talking about nothing in particular when Ron eventually found them, having looked everywhere else, and joined them on the bank until the bells chimed out the five-minute warning for their next lesson.
Those words sent a shot of panic through Draco's nervous system. Was it their anniversary? Surely he hadn't forgotten one? Harry wouldn't be acting so calm if he had. Licking his lips, he straightened. "Remember what?" he asked.
Blaise slammed his fist on the table, "I already told you, I didn't miss anything!"
In the few weeks that followed Harry cherished his time at the manor, regularly checking up on Draco and detailing the blonde in his findings. Due to several new diagnostic spells with the aid of a new sensory potion, Harry had been able to determine that the pressure being felt on the blonde's already weak lungs was in a very weak state now and was not being caused by a virus. This had puzzled him greatly until he'd read a medical journal sent to him by his father about a man named Robert Koch who had identified that the bacillus causing diseases identical to Draco's as
Harry nodded so hard that Severus feared that his head would fall off his shoulders. "Would it be possible to send him a telegram straight away? I know there may not be a response until tomorrow evening, but as it's Tuesday morning I can easily get started on preparing any potions I can take for the rest of the week."
Harry returned the smile, looking radiant as he did so, "Much better. And I am now all cum-free for the evening," Draco chuckled as Harry bared his body, the towel pooling around his feet. He clapped and grinned as Harry grabbed a pair of boxer-shorts and gently slid into the bed alongside his partner. Draco looped his arms around Harry and pressed a kiss to the bald head now nuzzled against his chest. "So what are we watching? Crap?"
He don't know how long he was crouched down on his knees and working Draco wider and wider, but as soon as his lover was ready and waiting for his throbbing member, he stood up and straightened the sore muscles in his knees before slicking his own cock up and positioning himself up between Draco's quivering thighs. "H-Harry … Please … Need more," Draco panted, his chest rising up and down rapidly.
Harry breathed through a smile and leaned a little closer to the blonde. Now that there were no eyes, it was easier to feel relaxed with the older man. He couldn't deny the way his stomach flipped when they were together, and in recent meet-ups in the Room of Requirement there had been a tension thrumming in the air between them. A tension that surged through him and made him ...
He did not want to give up but how -in the name of Merlin -was he supposed to write about their life together? Where would he even START?
Draco rolled his head to look down, his cheeks flushed and his eyes heavy lidded. He stroked Harry's cheek, "Let me make love to you, Harry. Let me show you just how much I love you."
"No, baby, it's not bad. You deserve a holiday after being cooped up for so long" Draco crooned softly, as Seeker padded up, his ears and tail drooping as he placed his muzzle on Harry's lap. Harry allowed his hands to automatically bury itself within the golden fur. Draco rocked back and forth until Harry sniffled and coughed and wiped at his eyes.
Blaise nodded as he checked over the list, "Yes that's all we'll need for now. Pansy can you start chopping the peppermint for me?"
"I came back for you here, didn't I?" Harry rasped out, his throat husky from where the wand had jabbed into it. "I couldn't have left you here then, and I'm not leaving this room now. Not until we sort this all out!"
"M'close!" the blonde grunted loudly. Mere moments later his orgasm ripped through him and came hot and heavy in Harry's aching, sweating body. He tremored as the orgasm crashed over him with wave upon wave of pleasure, before he was emptied completely and collapsed down onto Harry's naked chest. He leaned up on his arms and stroked a stray strand of Harry's dark hair out of his eyes, "Mmm you're so beautiful, Harry," he murmured, feeling utterly exhausted.
"Are useless and the same as they've been up until this point. Next?"
He watched as Seeker bounded along the expanse of darkened, damp sand that stretched forth. The middle pier and North pier were long, thin planks stretched out over the sand. Harry was dressed in a pair of trainers, light grey and blue lumberjack shorts that came just above his knees, and a red hoodie over a plain grey T-Shirt. His glances reflected the pale sky.
wouldn't forgive myself for this!"
Harry licked his lips and gave a shaky nod.
Harry had scanned his eyes to see if this was a joke. He knew deep down that it was not but he had still done it until he was one hundred percent positive. "So ... we're getting a puppy?"
"Mr. Malfoy?" he startled out of his reverie, the irregular crane clutched between loose fingers. A nurse was hovering beside him, frowning down at him. He swallowed and nodded. "You can come in and see him now"
Harry smiled as he opened the book and flipped through to the column of photo's used for a bookmark, "it does get pretty boring here" he smiled as he slipped the column of photos out and replaced a piece of tissue as the bookmark. "I like these photo's" he smiled, "it was a beautiful weekend."
"What –What happened to Draco?" he managed to rasp out, not daring to look at his old mentor for fear of the bone-crushing disgust no doubt evident in his eyes. He didn't know why he asked. It would torture him to know but if he didn't, it would merely suspend the impact when he eventually found out.
As he opened the driver's door and slid inside rather awkwardly, he vaguely registered that Harry was awake and staring bleary-eyed at his lap. Draco closed the door with a 'clunk' and deposited the food and drinks in the cup-holders and placed the bag on Harry's lap. He reached over and stroked his fingers through Harry's hair, forcing the younger man to blink wearily and smile as he turned his cheek into his lover's warm palm. "You okay, love?" Draco asked softly, his brow furrowed with concern.
What he saw on the other side of the door brought fresh tears to his eyes and made his stomach knot in a pleasant manner; tinsel was draped in silver and red and green strands around the smaller area of the room, and adorned the fireplace. Candles stood in small clumps on a few battered old tables in a couple of areas and a large, plush rug had been dragged into the room in front of the fire. Harry sniffed and rubbed at the back of his neck as the door closed behind him.
His keys felt foreign to his hand, as though they did not belong there any longer. He closed his eyes, savoring the icy cold touch in his palm, before walking over to the small porcelain bowl on the little cabinet beside the front door. He dropped the keys into it, almost wincing at the harsh clattering sound that echoed within the bowl. It echoed throughout the entire apartment. Not that it mattered to him anymore.
Blaise cocked a black eyebrow and bowed his head. It was decided; the following evening would be when the potion would be completed. It was only a matter of time before they could sneak the potion to Draco. The only question was how would they do it? The potion needed to come from Potter's own hand, to make it work properly. One of them needed to approach Potter in an nonthreatening manner in a public place.
Draco nodded, "Yes, I need to feel you inside me. I need you to dominate me. I need you to make me scream and beg and lose myself underneath you." He pressed his hot, hungry mouth onto Harry's and moaned low in his throat as he clutched Harry tighter, "I want to greet the sun tomorrow morning still screaming your name over and over into the pillows with you buried deep inside me."
. He loved his father dearly for the love and pride he had for his family. Sometimes he was a little too pragmatic, but he did love them. That was the main thing about everything.
"I daren't say that if it does not interfere with your work, then Severus would be more than happy. After all, you will be spreading the things he had taught you, and I don't doubt that there will be some other people around the manor who wouldn't mind enquiring some things of you. And you would be able to recommend them all to Severus for help."
That sounded good. Maybe he would try and win Harry one of those massive Teddy Bears that some kids had been carting around. He smiled softly as the salted wind raked his blond hair out of his eyes. Harry gave his hand a squeeze and leaned closer against him as they walked through the damp sand, the soft shushing noises of the waves breaking on the banks. The salty air awakened their numb senses, the sleep last night having been deep and heavy.
Draco chuckled, a low rumble in Harry's ear, "and why is that?"
"Come on."
He went to bed late that night. Later than usual for the past few months, at least. Seeker was already lying in the very middle of the bed, like he had done when he was a puppy. He swallowed thickly; it had seemed so long ago. He sighed and rubbed at his eyes, before slipping in between the cold sheets. Had they always been that cold? He rolled onto his side and gaze out over at Harry's side of the bed, the pillow still upright, the covers pulled taut.
Draco nodded, his eyes heavily lidded and his lips parted as he breathed roughly and leaned in to press their mouths together, hot, wet and arousing. Harry let the warm mouth kiss him, fighting through the fog in his mind that was numbing his senses. He let out a soft hum of pleasure and let his eyes fluttered closed completely when he felt a sharp tooth graze across his bottom lip and tug gently. Draco pressed another kiss to his lips, and then another and another until he pulled Harry closed towards him with such hungry urgency that it ignited something within the younger man as fingers threaded through his thick, dark hair. "Take me to bed, Harry," he growled low in his throat despite the constrictions in his chest brought on by the weather, "Make love to me. I want you to make love to me all night and long."
"So what?" Harry countered, straightening up as best as he could. "Is it so bad for me to look out for you? Is it so bad for you to have someone giving you a help in hand once in a while?"
Harry felt the corners of his mouth turn downwards at the corners. "It took you that long to want to hear from me?"
The thought alone was enough to make his stomach churn and knot inside him, but he forced himself to ignore it. It was growing more difficult, the closer the day drew. Regardless, Draco was determined to keep his cool.
"To tell you the truth, Harry, I think it was a mistake for you to come back to Hogwarts. I know Hermione persuaded you and to be honest, if you didn't we wouldn't have reconciled our difference. Whilst I am grateful for that, and for you helping the Slytherin's get some measure of respect back, I don't think Hogwarts is a good place for you to be right now."
In the end it was Pansy who came up with a plan and had thus appointed herself to be the one to approach Potter, despite the resentment that still hung between the two.
Harry shook his head, "I want to sleep here with you," he managed through a yawn.
"Wha?" Harry grumbled swatting at Draco's hands.
When he got back to his room later that night, the steep staircases making his legs ache even more than they had earlier, he went about packing his trunk with the few potions he had researched and found in storage, including the one he had brewed after hours, and piled a few medical journals inside to read if Draco was feeling too weak and needed some company, as well as a new bound journal of his own to start recording his findings and research. He hadn't added everything he'd already researched as yet, because he wanted to cast some diagnosis spells on Draco's chest to see if he was able to detect the areas of pain and compare it to the diagnosis chart he had copied down during his lunch break. Kneeling back on his haunches he felt satisfied that he had everything and then settled down to sleep.
Harry snorted weakly, leaning sideways into the warmth of Draco's body, "Maybe if the food wasn't so awful, I'd have more body fat and energy to bloody talk."
"Alright Potter, you have yourself a deal." He placed his hand into Harry's and tried to ignore the jolt he felt as his first skin-on-skin contact with another human being in months, as it ran through him. Taking his hand back, he stood a little straighter and inclined his head, "See you soon then, Potter."
The silence between them was like a barrier of ice.
Harry chuckled lightly and then slipped his hand under the velvet of the ring, and drew out a gold chain with the ring looped on it, "You can wear it around your neck. I know this may seem mad but I just wanted to show you just how much I love you. Sometimes I get worried that one day 'something' may happen and you wouldn't know just how much I do love you." Draco felt his eyes drop and then felt Harry hook a finger underneath his chin and tilt it up, "I promise that I will love you and care for you for as long as either of us shall live."
Grey eyes met green and two hearts hammered in separate chest. "I'm worried about you, Harry." There. He'd done it. He'd admitted at least the tip of his iceberg of worry. It was a pathetic excuse of all that he could have said but couldn't find the energy to say it. He clenched his fingers around the ends of the chairs arms. He dropped his gaze to the floor, not bearing to look into the eyes of the man who had all but vocally rejected him. "I don't think you should work for a while. I think you should stay home and relax for a little while, maybe run the shop with me. You have an assistant; they could take care of things for a couple of weeks or so."
The long weekend at his parents Manor was a nice change of pace from the hurly burly world of running the apothecary and Harry disappearing to work as soon as he could get away from their apartment. It was refreshing to be able to sleep peacefully beside a large fire, whether it was a light or not. He did miss the fact that he couldn't sleep beside Harry's warm body, although he wasn't sure what he missed more; sleeping beside Harry or how he used to be at night sleeping with Harry. In truth the memory was a lot more appealing than their current reality but he never voiced it aloud. He didn't mind having all the space to roll around in but he had grown accustomed to reach out and lightly touch his hand along Harry's, who would entwined their fingers lazily in his sleep. Those moments made Draco's eyes tear up. The fact that, even in his subconscious, Harry
She rolled her eyes, "Oh please. Like you haven't noticed." She cocked an eyebrow at him.
"I don't think I can do this!" he choked out as he turned and tried to hobble past Severus. He didn't even make it two steps as Severus gripped his arms and spun him around and pushed him closer to the communal ward where Draco was staying. Narcissa had insisted to pay for a private room, but Draco had told her to shut up and stop fussing over stupid things. When Severus had told Harry this on the train, the younger man had cracked a smile at Draco coming back to his old, snappy self when he awoke.
Harry nodded, "yeah I'll be alright. Just need some food in me."
"You know I'd love it, you dirty tease!" Harry grinned. His anxiety lifted off of him like a weight. With a content sigh, he lowered his head back onto Draco's chest and wrapped an arm around his waist. His stomach was full of butterflies as he let his mind wander. There were so many other muggle things they could try -providing Draco was feeling adventurous enough.
Draco inclined his head, the dark circles under his eyes looking like deep holes by candlelight, "Yes, I want us to go on a boat ride tomorrow afternoon. I want us to talk; about anything, nothing if you'd prefer, but I just want to spend some time with you, where you don't go running off like you're afraid to be near me."
"You can and you will," Severus stated as he strode out of the ward, leaving Harry standing there awkwardly in some borrowed clothes and edging weakly down the aisle between the beds of sick patients until he came around the pale curtain and his eyes landed on a pale Draco sitting upright in bed against his pillows, looking grey in the late afternoon sunlight pouring in through the high, narrow windows. His eyes flickered up when he saw Harry standing awkwardly at the end of his bed, but his expression didn't change when their eyes locked onto one another.
Clearly he wasn't the only one who wanted to spend more time with the other.
Severus pursed his lips, as though he were debating on whether to tell Draco his suspicions but decided that he may as well be truthful, or at least partially truthful. "I have a suspicion as to what might be afflicting Harry, and I have to say that if you don't watch yourself, Draco, you could very easily see yourself going the same way."
Draco hummed in response before he flicked Harry's cheek, "By the looks of things I gave as good as I got."
Harry looked impressed as Draco paused for a breath. He couldn't help but smile as the blonde flexed his arm muscles. "You really are a great motivational speaker. Maybe you should get a job where ninety per cent of it you give speeches."
Harry shifted away, "Nothing is ever going to happen again Draco!" he retorted tartly.
Severus shrugged, "I don't see why that would be a problem," he gave a weak smirk, "Besides, I haven't seen Draco this relaxed in months."
Draco had played CD after CD to fill the gentle silences that would occur when Harry would exhaust himself and fall into a small slumber. Draco did not mind. It was a pleasant day, despite the weather changing dramatically on the journey to Blackpool, from drizzly grey London weather to bright sunny, Blackpool weather, it stayed more-or-less the same on the journey down. Even as the evening drew near and they entered the busy streets of London, the temperature was still surprisingly warm.
"And what of you?" the brunette man asked softly not wanting to upset his companion any more than he already appeared to be.
"No," he drawled. "It's Snape. I'm back from the dead. Boo."
Draco hummed. "Of course it does. You've not given me a pounding in a while."
Besides, Seeker was waiting for them both at home.
He tried his best not to let those moments distract him but it was extremely difficult when Draco stood before him, braced against the engraved bedposts in only a small towel wrapped around his hips, it became increasingly difficult for the brunette man to breathe. Even if Draco was on the skinny side, there was no denying he had some vague semblance of muscle from the effort of having to move himself around in such a weakened state. Over the course of the rest of the week that he had stayed on an emergency visit, Draco had made a marked improvement already and Harry had been really impressed and excited all at once. It amused the blonde man to no end to see how excited his companion would get. However, they were both unusually silent in the hour that Draco was naked and being examined over and over by the brunette, his calloused tanned hands running over his pale muscles, his nimble fingertips brushing gently over the contours of his torso that always made him shiver. The feeling wasn't entirely unpleasant. He didn't say anything though, but Harry didn't seem to mind to touch him once he got the confidence brought on by at least two glasses of rich wine.
Draco leaned backwards and braced himself lightly on Harry's thighs and eased himself up and down along Harry's thick, pulsing erection. Harry's skin felt soft and sweaty beneath his hands as he quickened his pace, moans escaping from both of them. "D-Draco ... think I'm gonna-" The sound of Harry's orgasm ripping out from his mouth was enough to send Draco over the edge as well, hot, white cum exploding all over Harry's chest.
"Perhaps to most others, but I woke with people and bodies in all walks of life every day so don't think I won't notice an unnatural complexion when I see one staring me right in the face."
He didn't want to be around anyone, not after last month and what Severus had made him write down. According to the greasy haired man he was suffering from a severe form of depression and at that Harry had snapped and thrown the man out of his bedchamber and spent the rest of the night trying to diagnose himself and trying not to be biased. A voice in the back of his mind told him how much that he failed at that one simple task, but he ignored it and decided that with a little extra sleep, he'd be perfectly fine and back to normal. If only he could get to sleep, then he'd be all set. He had no idea where Draco and the others were and it wasn't like he even cared anyway, or would seek his 'husband' out to talk to him. He didn't feel like he could talk to the blonde anymore, but he didn't know why. He couldn't pinpoint a moment where it had all gotten so hard for them to live together.
Harry shook his head, "We shouldn't have kissed," he breathed turning away and making to move out of the large four poster bed and away from the warmth of the man he spent every week with. "I shouldn't be here. Not in your bed and kissing you. I'm sorry, Draco I –"
Upon exiting the hospital and into the muggle world, Draco stopped off at the small shop at the bottom, where relatives usually bought magical balloons and teddy bears for sick loved ones. Draco decided to buy a small beanie hat, lined with cotton so as not to irritate Harry's bald head. He paid the woman behind the counter, who gave him a sympathetic look and added a small 'get well' cake in a box to his bag, free of charge. Draco thanked her and then turned to Harry, tugging the price tag off of the hat.
Every now again he sighed to himself and leaned this way and that, his eyes never straying from the horizon that glimmered with the promise of a clear night sky.
It also seemed to help that, since the war had ended along with the trials, pureblood tradition was widely disregarded at present, so it wasn't like same sex relationships would be terribly frowned upon. He couldn't deny his annoyance that the blonde wouldn't just get up and kiss the stupid boy yet. What was stopping him? He was the Savior of the Wizarding World, The Boy Who Lived Twice, and had so many people falling all over themselves just to sit near him. So what was Draco so worried about? Well that wasn't difficult; he was an ex-Death Eater and a Slytherin not to mention a Malfoy.
Harry blushed and ducked behind his fringe, "I know I -I'm sorry I get carried away."
He had wanted to bring Seeker along after their morning walk, but he had decided against it and had returned home to lock the sorrowful brown eyes behind the familiar blue door.
He collapsed back against the chair, his face in his hands once again. All the memories were washing up in his minds-eye, melting into one another, in one big happy blur that consisted of wagging tails, giddy grins, bright green eyes and tender kisses. All of it was over-shadowed by that dreaded day when they had gone to the hospital seven and a half months ago. The call had come completely out of the blue. Neither had been expecting it. Even poor Seeker could tell that something was up once Harry had replaced the receiver on the hook.
Harry let out a grunt and collapsed bodily onto his lover.
The grandfather clock down the hall chimed loudly through the empty rooms and Draco winced that now he would have to leave. He really didn't want to leave the place that he watched his father work on important cases and meetings whilst he'd sat in the overly stuffed chairs by the fireplace and played with a model train. Blinking black the tears that he refused to shed more of since the funeral, he turned his back on the room and closed the door behind him. He leaned back against the door, grasping the head of his father's cane in his hand, before forcing his legs to march him out of the Manor and into the grizzly damp Parisian day. He stepped up into the coach, tugging the collar of his travelling cloak tighter around him, before sitting back against the seats and resting his cane beside his leg, the silver snakes head gleaming in the overcast light.
Severus stopped from his pacing in front of the young man and whirled around to face him, dark eyes like bottomless pits burning with fury. If Harry had had any more energy he would have flinched. As it stood he could just about focus on his breathing and murmuring a little. That alone was exhausting him already but if Severus wanted answers then he'd give the man some damned answers. "What do you mean?" Severus asked as he drew the chair away from the balcony, shut the doors against the night sky, and seated himself at the head of the bed, leaning back so he could analyse the young man before him.
Why did he never remember to close the floo network? After the war he would have thought it would be on his main priorities every night; he double bolted the front door so why not check the floo network?
Draco shook his head, "No, actually, he is my godfather. He did use to teach me potions before I was accepted to Beauxbatons School. So how long have you been studying underneath him?"
Harry nodded his head, "Yes I must return to Calais and complete my studying for my exams in June."
With a breathy laugh and pressing their foreheads together, "I don't care about any of that Harry. I am going to spend every last breath in my body loving you as much as possible. Those letters today, they reminded me of what we had and how long and hard it took to get us back to somewhere a lot better. I love you, there is nothing more to it, do you understand me?"
Harry chuckled to himself, "I know you do, baby, I just miss holding you in my arms whilst we sleep -it feels so empty each night, lying alone."
Harry snorted in the back of his throat but he had the decency to close the book, his thumb hooked in the page he'd stopped at. He leaned his head back against the pillows and focused his gaze on the blonde. "What are you doing here, Draco?" he breathed softly, no conviction present in his voice.
Harry felt something stir painfully in his chest. He didn't want to think about poor old Arthur who hadn't made it, no matter what he had tried to do. It was hard not to become friends with the elderly red-haired man. He was ever so charming, always prattling about how fascinating the muggles were. Harry had enjoyed taking care of him until that ground breaking morning when he had gone in and found a nurse stripping down Arthur's bed and vanishing the dirty sheets with a lazy flick of her wand before casting another spell to have clean sheets and pillowcases onto the bed, ready for the new patient. It had hurt as he'd watched the nurse carry on about her day as though Arthur had never existed. He shouldn't have let it affect him so much, especially when he dealt with dead peoples bodies every day, so why did Arthur make him suffer so greatly? Maybe it was because despite being old and frail and suffering from something that had turned out to be incurable, he had taken every day with a pinch of salt, enjoyed everything around him and never ceased to find something wonderful to tell Harry about, even if it was simply how wonderful the porridge had been that morning.
Draco hummed, "I wouldn't have let him. We put so much time and work into this place; I couldn't just let it go to someone else."
Draco exhaled and slumped back against the stone pillar. As blunt as Harry had been it was still a lot to take in. He rubbed the back of his neck until the skin burned with the pressure and his stomach lurched uncomfortably. Harry had died. He could've stayed gone. Voldemort could have won after all. He felt nauseated but then another thought entered his head that made him shiver with the cold.
"Yeah right," he scoffed.
Draco peered down at Harry, a weight unwinding from his chest and then rested back against the pillow, stroking the brunette's soft skin as he relaxed gently in his arms. Silence stretched out between them for a while before Draco decided to break the silence again, "You know, when you stopped writing to me, I thought you wouldn't appreciate me coming to congratulate you," he murmured softly as Harry shifted onto his other side, his face pressing lightly into Draco's chest. "I know you still probably don't but I needed to see you. It had been so long and Severus hadn't been forthcoming with any information." He paused and drew in a deep breath, "I wanted to see you one last time, even if it was the last time that I could."
Harry limply took one of Draco's hands in his own, laced their trembling fingers together and squeezed, "You've only ruined me for everyone else, Draco. I don't think that's going to matter anymore."
The following morning Draco woke up alone. He loathed the feeling of waking up alone and neglected in the late hours of the morning. He sank bank down into his pillows and drew his sheets up around his shoulders not wanting to seem as vulnerable as he felt.
He let his hands fall to his lap and his body started to shake with tears, but they weren't of sadness, not really. It was the shock that anyone else had actually noticed just how ill he'd been making himself. It wasn't on purpose but if no one took him seriously then why the hell should he give a damn about his health? He slipped into his bed without changing out of his uniform and curled into his pillow, still sobbing dryly for a little while and trying to take deep breaths to calm himself enough to sleep. He reached out and placed a single spot behind his ear and was soon falling asleep, feeling relaxed, full and honestly ... touched.
be fine Italian silk –and ease his breathing before clutching the over-stuffed pillow in his hands. He could take the two steps to the bed and gently ease the pillow over Draco's face, so gently so as not to start him awake too soon. He could wait and enjoy the sensation of playing God –of having a life in the palm of his hand –and relish in it. Then, ever so slowly, he could apply pressure to the pillow, his hands sinking into its softness, and feel Draco's bone structure through the feathers. Draco would realise his air was seriously lacking and start to struggled when he realised the pressure of Harry sitting on his chest, but that was to be expected. Harry could envision the flailing limps, the muffled cries and the short, rapid breathing until finally, everything could become still and silent and frightening.
Draco nodded his head, "I'll be sure to do that."
The groans that Harry made in the empty classroom were the sexiest sound Draco had ever heard as he prepped the younger boy. He tried to be as gentle as he could but at the same time get the foreplay out of the way so that they could finally have a good rough pounding.
Harry blinked a few times, the words still spinning around in the air with almost no real meaning to them. He focused his eyes on the blond towering over him, his silver eyes sparkling with anticipation and determination. He was serious. This was no joke. Though the last few months had been rather strenuous on them both Harry had never thought that -in a million years -Draco would propose.
Harry was eager to show his independence as soon as his bath was over, he insisted on shuffling to the bedroom, wrapped in a towel, leaning his shoulder against the hallway walls for support as he maneuvered himself to their bedroom in order to dress. Draco had insisted that he should help but Harry had thrown him a weak glare over his shoulder before continuing. Draco had swallowed thickly, a small breeze whispering around his ankles before he turned to the now empty bathroom, the steam drifting about the atmosphere above his head. He removed the plug from the hole in the bottom of the bathtub and watched as the pipes gurgled and slurped the soapy water down greedily.
"Well since this is my decision of what we do tonight I want us to do something we've never done before."
Lucius smirked a little wider and then moved his cool approval over to Snape. "You have done well in training this young boy, Severus. I daresay he will be your greatest accomplishment. He is certainly a credit to you." Severus inclined his head in much the same cool manner as Harry was accustomed to. "In fact, if you do not mind losing the company of young Mister Potter for a few moments, I would like to talk to him in private."
But he couldn't.
"Er ... yeah?" she asked nervously, self conscious that the blonde man had heard what she'd been discussing with Blaise. She needed to watch herself. They were too close to accomplishing their scheme, so they didn't need anything disrupting them.
A knot of uneasiness settled in his stomach when he saw Pansy Parkinson walking up to him, a determined expression on his face. He tensed his shoulders, prepared to either walk away briskly or reaching for his wand. Despite what Draco said, Pansy had still wanted to give him up to the Dark Lord. Scared or not, she should have known that handing him over wouldn't have ended the war, it simply would have made it easier for the rest of them to fail and die. He cleared his throat and stood a little straighter, "Parkinson."
Draco hummed, "That's not what I meant. I meant that at the age of seventeen you were ready to give up possibly the best years of your life and just die like that. For a world who, for the most part, have slandered you and your life."
That had left Harry and Draco alone on the other end of the table.
He felt heat pool in the pit of his stomach and his school trousers grew a little tighter. Thank goodness for school robes! Dipping his quill into his inkwell he quickly scratched out a note underneath the original and took the next five minutes carefully folding the paper crane back and sent it flying back around the room.
"I'm trying but sometimes I really wish I could just stun some of them, or spell their mouths shut," Hermione muttered, hanging her head and sighing deeply.
With his mind made up he stood up and performed his nightly rituals before tugged his nightshirt on over his head and climbing into the rickety bed and pulling the sheets up to his chest. Draco's letter rested on his bedside table where he kept the rest of them, stacked neatly together and tied together with a silvery hair ribbon that he'd found in the old dress robes Draco had insisted he keep as a gift. The next morning he would go to Severus and ask for the rest of the week off and explain everything to him. No doubt he would already know that Draco had taken ill, but regardless he was going to explain everything including what he intended to do as the personal assignment for the exams. He just hoped that any potions he created wouldn't discredit his research should it fail.
Greasy water poured down his gullet and rushed up his nose and into his ears and he was sure it even leaked under his eyeballs and soaked through into his skull.
"Just get on with it Malfoy!" the brunette grunted.
"I understand that Lord Malfoy but I do not believe I was deceiving your son. Potions and medicine have developed at such an alarming rate recently that I do believe, given some more time, there will be something to at the very least ease your sons discomfort and to perhaps give him a better quality of life." He paused and licked his lips, "I assume that is why he isn't here tonight. Did he take ill since last night?"
"I actually remember the day I realised I was looking forward to your letters," Draco mused as he leaned over and placed his glass on the small table beside his armchair, "It was the morning that the post was unusually late and I had a small moment of panic and then suddenly, I was handed your letter and I felt so much joy in that moment," he sighed with a wistful smile, "It really was the brightest morning in May."
He knew Slughorn wouldn't. None of the professors could be bothered with Death Eater scum like himself. The water clouded his vision and for that a part of him was grateful. "Come on Malfoy!" someone taunted, "Where's your precious Daddy now?"
The pattering of the rain was the only sound that accompanied him for the next hour and a half along with the beeping of Harry's heart monitor.
The little images made him smile.
"Well, if we're going to do this again we're going to have to be better prepared." He cocked a blonde eyebrow at his perplexed lover and smirked. He loved teasing Harry so much. He always had.
He felt his chest constrict as the words and the memories assaulted him. He pressed his fingers against his temples, clenched his eyes shut tight and when that didn't work, he stood up and went over to his decanter of whisky and poured some of the amber liquid into a glass and down it at once, the burning liquid surging down his throat and lighting his chest on fire. He choked out a couple of coughs before pouring himself another two-fingers of whiskey and taking it back over to his chaise and slumped down in it, the fire heating him from the grate and his eyes slightly unfocused as he drifted back to that summer.
Harry shook his head before giving a stiff laugh. "How can I? Even if I told you, you would judge me nine ways to Sunday. It's a lot more darker than just not seeing the point of life anymore. Because I don't, Draco, and that scares me. If I don't see the point in life then how am I supposed to get through the next -Oh, I don't know -the next sixty odd years of my life finding everything tedious and menial? No one can physically live like that and be happy with it."
"Well I should avoid that short woman over there who looks a little bit like a bloat bullfrog," Draco stated in a cool manner indicating a rather rotund woman in a set of flamboyant pink dress robes, her brunette hair tightly curled on the top of her head, outlining the rather lumpy edge of her skull. Harry was momentarily captivated, wondering about the muscles that must strain to work as the woman rambled on at such a rapid pace that he couldn't help but wonder what kept her jawbone connected. "That's Dolores Umbridge, she tends to sneer down at a lot of people who don't meet up to her rather impossibly high standards."
No wonder his father had finally agreed to let him go back to Hogwarts.
"You were only seventeen," he finally breathed into the still air between them.
A variety of emotions was racing through Draco as he helped Harry slip and slide over the linoleum flooring to the wheelchair, where he was propped up like a doll, a small fleece blanket wrapped over his legs, despite it was nearing the end of summer.
He shuddered and went to lean against the sink and rake his hands through his wet hair and scrub his face down with some clean, warm water and breathe a little easier. He tried to clear his throat but it was hard, not to mention how raw it felt after all his screaming. He wiped at his eyes and shivered as goosepimples appeared all over his naked, damp chest. He looked down at his shirt and frowned. He could just charm it dry but that would itch his skin and make everything even worse. He needed to get down to the dungeons and shower properly.
"I know you did," Harry soothed as he reached out and gave Draco's shoulder a squeeze, "Try not to dwell on it too greatly, alright? Not on your own at least. Severus will be more than happy to help you or even listen to you if you feel you need someone to speak to."
"What was dying like?" Draco asked softly, his words whispering out into the air.
Later that evening the two met, as usual, in the Room of Requirement. As usual the place was sparsely furnished with nothing but a single large armchair and fireplace in the small space. They rarely needed much else between the two of them. Harry couldn't help but wonder what they would get up to that evening; another duel? No, that seemed unlikely. What else would they get to do then? Of course he had a few fair ideas of what they
Harry shook his head a fraction, not knowing the answer. What could he say? He knew it wasn't going to be that simple and he didn't know if he wanted to go through such lengths to get him anywhere relatively close to how he was last year, "Do you mind if I try and sleep on it Severus?" he muttered softly, "Let me think about it."
To say that he was surprised to arrive at Hogsmeade station in one piece, would have been an understatement for Draco Malfoy as the train rattled to a stop, plumes of white vapour streaming past his window.
Draco seemed to listen to the words, his expression never wavering as he soaked it in. He lowered his eyes and seemed to take a deep breathe, "I can't forgive you for this, Harry –"
"Oh, Draco!" Harry panted out harshly into the blonde's ear as he buried his nose into the mattress, "I've missed making love to you."
Draco stretched himself out on the bed beside his lover and played with the damp strands of hair curling up from his temples, "By remembering all of the things that you have done
As he clawed his way closer through the forest of weeds, Harry squinted and reached out for the limp pale hand that was floating aimlessly through the slimy black tendrils drifting lazily around them. Draco's mouth was still open; water would be leaking into his lungs slowly and filling him up. He'd soon bloat and be completely lost to Harry if he didn't get him out soon. He grabbed the flaying cloth of Draco's garments and shifted his dead weight off the sandy lakebed, a few pebbles rocking and clicking together as the lifeless man shifted a little higher, making it easier for Harry to wrap an arm around the blonde man's chest.
Draco glared and continued, "And I think its best that you stay with Severus. You need help and you
Harry offered his own, weak smile as he leaned forward into Draco's opened arms; the feel of security that washed through him as those two, sculptured arms wound around his shoulders was enough to make him sigh with relief and contentment. "Thank you for helping me Draco," he murmured in the blond hair that tickled his nose as he was lifted up, away from the softness of the mattress.
Draco ignored the question, after having the discussion with Harry the previous night he wasn't up for discussing
"I don't care what the nurse says!" Harry snipped, his breathing harsh to Draco's ears. "I just want to have some good memories before ... if I ..."
On what would initially be Harry's last weekend at the manor before he needed to buckle down and study for his exams, not that they had known it until the following Monday, Harry had been in a bad mood for some reason or other. His physical examination seemed cold and almost foreboding as he helped Draco slip back into some fresh clean clothes, and then stationed himself at the ornate oak desk and buried himself in his work of sketching out Draco's body once again, an image that was always freshly engrained into his subconscious at the end of every day, before he took a break from his writing, to read to Draco and update him on any developments with his body as well as make sure he took his vital potions, no matter how bitter they tasted. Draco didn't necessarily like when Harry was in that particular sort of mood, he knew it was bound to have come to light sooner or later, but he didn't know the cause of it –unless it was himself –or just that the brunette man hadn't slept well. At around two o'clock in the afternoon, he'd had enough of the self-enforced silence on Harry's part and decided to ask. "Harry is there something that's bothering you today? You've been unusually quiet," Draco stated in a quiet tone as he read through one of his own books, comfortably propped in his armchair.
"Lord Malfoy, this is my protégée who I was telling you about last night. He is the only one out of my new apprentices who has managed to surpass the average standards of our work at the hospital. I am going to hire him as a part time assistant after this weekend as he is absolutely invaluable to the progress of our research at the hospital."
He let the note drift out of his hands and spiral down onto the floor. It was Potter. Potter had been doing all of this for him. He should have expected it truth be told but he hadn't and that should have made him feel pathetic.
Again, something twisted inside Draco. Normally, he was the one who topped since that was just how their relationship had started. He wasn't opposed to Harry topping -it just too a bit for him to adjust to being dominated. He got defensive sometimes, tried to wriggled out from underneath. Not to mention -as reluctant as he was to admit it -Harry was thicker than he was. It literally took him some getting used to, having Harry fill him up to breaking point.
, and had been identified and described on 24 March and then sent to press. Harry had then informed Snape and together they had begun creating weak vaccination salves to rub of the chest. Initially it was to help stop the disease from getting worse, and in time reduce the risk of it. Naturally, they still worked on creating an all-time cure but for that particular summer the salves and later a mild potion helped many people literally breathe a little easier. Draco had been most impressed that he didn't get breathless as easily, not even from coming up the grand staircase to his bedchamber. He knew he had been right to trust in Harry's judgement.
Harry watched him for several moments before edging a little further into the room and standing a few feet from where Malfoy was slumped over; he really did look utterly defeated, with his dishevelled hair that used to be so sleek and perfectly placed, and his pale skin that used to glow once upon a time now looked dishwater grey and taut over his bones. He looked like everything Malfoy would have hated to have been. "Malfoy ..." he started to say but there were no words to follow that single name, so he let it hang in the air. He swallowed thickly and turned on his heel to leave. There wasn't much else he could think of doing really.
"I am not so rich that I did not bother to read, Potter," the blonde man snapped irritably, his cheeks beginning to look a little clammy.
She sighed and after another ten minutes in silence she decided to leave for The Burrow. "Alright, well, you know where to floo whenever you want company," he nodded his head but did not turn to face her as she threw a pinch of floo-powder into the fireplace fixed into the wall behind the armchair she had been sitting in. She made one last attempt at getting him to talk, "so what do you plan on doing for the rest of the day?"
He had wanted it. Of course he had wanted it! He would have been a fool if he hadn't, but he should have showed some restrained in the matter and let Draco lead things the way he wanted to. He had ended up apologising profusely, backing away from their blanket in the shaded grass and turned from the blonde and hurried back across the lawn to the house. Draco wouldn't have appreciated being left behind in the growing darkness but he had needed some time to distance himself and gather his thoughts before letting himself run rampant again. He didn't have to wait long to know how Draco felt about it all, as that night the blonde aristocrat had snuck up to Harry's bedchamber –the one with the balcony looking out over the gardens and the lake –and had demanded to be let in.
"Here we go," Draco murmured to his lover as they stood up and waited for the tram to screech to a halt. Harry blinked through his sleepy eyes and stood to follow Draco off of the tram. The early evening air was so soothing on his suddenly flushed skin as they crossed over from the North Pier and started walking up the high street that led off of the promenade, past the city hall and a few large bank buildings. Draco made sure to walk slow so that Harry did not exert himself before the meal.
"-I took you up to my room in the manor," Draco smirked, his stomach flooding with warmth at the memory.
"Are you sure?"
He had written letters to his blonde friend but had only gotten sporadic responses at best. These alone had worried him, especially when another letter from Pansy did nothing but complain about how Draco was being friends with Harry bloody Potter of all people, and how things for the entire Slytherin house had improved piece by piece. It still wasn't perfect, but he doubted that it ever would be any time soon. Maybe in a few years, but at present it still seemed a long way off.
He couldn't relax throughout his bath until he was let out and allowed to dress in a nightshirt and a summer dressing robe that he cinched tightly around his waist and paced his room back and forth for a while, even going as far to as ignore the call for dinner. He told the maid that he wasn't feeling too hungry and the enquired as to how Draco was fairing up. The young maid bowed her head and stated that the young master was asleep now and seemed a little on the warm side. Harry slumped down in the armchair in his small bedchamber –one of the guest ones –and watched the clock as it ticked another half an hour of his life away before he felt as though the coast would be clear outside for him to creep along to Draco's bedchamber and check on him. He wanted to persuade himself that he was merely curious as a physician, but a sickly fear swelled in the back of his mind and he found himself holding his breath as he inched closer to Draco's door, knocked lightly, and then walked in uninvited.
He couldn't deny that he was glad that it was Hermione who brought Malfoy up over lunch one afternoon. She had just returned from an Arithmancy lesson and the sound of her thick tome crashing onto the table was enough to make several people look up from their plates. "I can't believe how immature some people are being these days!" she snapped as she slipped into her chair and started forcefully loading food onto her plate.
Draco shook his head, "Not at all, Harry. You are passionate and intriguing, two very important things that I need in my life," he looked down at the brunette, "I think you would be good for me."
Like Ginny Weasley.
"Thought you wanted to make me squirm?" Draco bit back, feeling relax and excited all at once. A swift smack to his pert arse shut him up.
"Severus let me in after he went to bed from the party," Draco stated before coming over to the brunette and placing both of his hands on the brunette's tense shoulders. "Relax, Harry," he breathed gently, "Nothing will happen that you don't want to happen, alright?"
Oh yes, he decided, this was going to be fun!
Harry stared up at the blond with wide eyes as they walked, "Are you serious? Draco, you didn't need to go through all that trouble just for me."
They broke apart and both of them were reluctant to shift away from one another. Harry rested his forehead against the blonde's and sighed shakily. "Nothing's going to change between us after this is it?" he asked, his mind over-turning with the possibilities of losing his friend.
"It's just sweat ... mostly."
The funeral itself had already been pre-arranged by Lucius, since he had claimed he needed something productive to do on his deathbed. Narcissa had tried to talk him out of it, but eventually she'd conceded and helped him with some of the planning. It wasn't the happiest of times in her life but it seemed to help Lucius' psyche to be able to make life after his death easier on his beloved wife. Draco hadn't been there for many of the discussions as it seemed like a private matter to be left between husband and wife. Not that he minded. He didn't really want to think of his father not being there at all times. It had been distressing enough with Severus telling them the diagnosis but have to sit there and plan the funeral? It had all gotten a little too much for him.
He wanted to see Draco smile at him one last time …
Harry had stayed awake for another hour, tracing the contours of his lips as though Draco's own were imprinted upon his skin, before drifting off with a smile hiding behind his hand.
Harry's eyes were downcast as he nodded his damp cheek against Draco's palms. He blinked up and looked anywhere but at the blonde man leaning so close to him, his head was starting to feel hot and he wanted to let the tears out but why did they have to come
"Shut up!" Draco snapped roughly, "don't you dare go down that road. You're a survivor, Harry not because you're the freaking boy who lived, but because you're brave, you're strong, and you're determined."
It did not take long for Harry to silently slip into the world of dreams yet again. Draco was glad he had been present for the brief period that Harry was awake. It was a rare occurrence these days. He gently eased Harry back onto the pillows, drawing the blankets high up around his chin and pressed a kiss to his mouth. He took the book and placed it on Harry's bedside cabinet along with the column of photo's. It would make Harry smile when he woke up. He walked over to the door, his gaze lingering on his lover's sleeping form before walking out into the sterile corridors.
"Why would you ask that?" Lucius enquired with a cool expression and an eyebrow hitched into his hairline.
Harry still seemed unsure but was placated a little when Draco leaned down and rested back on the pillow getting his breathing evened out before slipping his hand down between their bodies and entwined their fingers together. At Harry's quaking, he gave a reassuring squeeze and smiled softly. "Just relax Harry," he breathed as he finally felt his eyelids grow a little heavier and soon he had drifted off to sleep, the weight of Harry's body against his reassuring and soothing all at once.
Lucius nodded his head and then left the room barking for the young maids to get back to their work. Harry flinched a little, having not heard Lucius raise his voice before, even if he had only met the man the night prior. Harry seated himself down his slim satchel pressed against his leg.
As they had arranged between that evening and that of Christmas Eve they two boys met up in the Room of Requirement to duel with one another. It wouldn't be all night long, although they both tried to go long enough until they were exhausted. They made it a rule that they could curse and yell and scream whatever they wanted during these sessions when they were duelling with one another. In doing so they found out a lot about one another, indirectly of course; Draco found out that Harry hated that Ginny was still sending him letters and many hints about them getting back together and that Harry was far beyond caring what anyone else thought -he didn't want to be with her and that was that. Likewise, Harry had found out that his testimony had kept Narcissa out of prison and had stopped Lucius getting a life-sentence, however the house arrest and restrictions to his magic had made Draco so emotionally challenged that he had now been registered as suffering from clinical depression. Draco had then found out that Harry felt lost with what he was meant to do now as he had been so sure he was going to die, at the same time that Harry found out that Draco's parents had been in talks in marrying him off to some pureblood girl in the year below him, called Astoria Greengrass. Her family had a better social standing at the moment and they hoped she would be a good influence on Draco.
That's when he heard the soft sounds of the blonde boy sobbing.
"At the rate you're going, I'm going to be judging you regardless, Harry," Severus stated blandly.
"Oh, and you do, do you?" she snarled in his face, "Why should I believe anything that some little Death Eater scum like you has to say?"
On the 23rd of June Harry Potted had his photo taken for passing his exams and being employed full-time at the hospital. He even had to make a speech and got to meet the muggleborn doctor, Robert Koch, from whom his personal assignment had been based upon. To Koch he was simply a devoted fan still in University, but to Harry he felt like he were walking in a dream. Despite not having found a long term cure for TB or Consumption as it was more commonly known, the disease that Draco was currently suffering from, his salves and potions that he'd concocted with Healer Snape were selling all over Paris and preventing a lot of premature deaths, if only by a few weeks in some severe cases.
The smallest of groans emitting from Harry's soft lips. Draco looked up from his paper crane he was making out of a tissue -Harry's head had lolled to one side and now a frown was marring his forehead. Draco frowned in distaste before leaning forward and smoothing the pad of his thumb over Harry's forehead, earning him a soft sigh and the fluttering of black eyelashes.
he muttered under his breath as he glared out of the window at the bleak weather. He had to wait another twenty minutes in the biting wind and cold rain before a coach pulled up on the uneven cobbles and Draco pulled himself up into the cool dryness, shaking greasy rain water out of his hair and scrubbing it out of his eyes. Once he had given his address to the driver, he closed his eyes and listened to the pattering of the rain on the roof above his head.
Draco?
No; that heart in his chest? That belonged to Draco. It always would be.
Severus smirked, "Naturally. Now for the next six months you will be living here and when Draco is discharged he is going to be placed in the care of his parents for the time being. Now, I have already made arrangements for my old colleague, Horace Slughorn, to take over your duties at St. Evangelina's and also have said he can live in your apartment for six months whilst he settles back down in France and saves up enough for his own place. He will take care of your stock and replace anything he uses or takes. I have a full inventory already taken down so we will see if anything is missing later. When you eventually go back to work, I've established that Horace will be there to help you out. Sort of a partner, if you will. Nothing will be affected, just you will be working four days a week, instead of whenever you're called in, and I think, for now, the four-day-week will be good for you. You need time for yourself to decompress but we'll get to that stage," he stated as he waved the matter aside, "For now I will get you into a routine and get you healthy again and when I feel you are up for it, I'm going to slowly integrate you back into work and evaluate you progress."
Harry shook his head and let out a watery sigh as he buried his face into the goose-down, "How can you ask me to do such a thing after everything I have done to you?"
"I love you too!" Harry whimpered back, tears burning in his eyes. He was at the height of pleasure and was so close to tipping over the edge that he had to clutch the armchair so hard he heard stitched pop. "Oh, Draco! I'm coming I'm -!" He didn't get to finish his thought as a warm stream of cum shot up over his stomach and chest. He felt his cheeks burn with embarrassment but soon dismissed it as Draco picked up his pace even more.
It was along this hallway, as Draco slipped his arms out of his waistcoat that he let his eye drift over the photos mounted on the walls in black, matte frames. They were four moments that Draco adored and couldn't help but smile at every time he walked by. They were of their best four dates -so far. There was the one where Harry had somehow convinced him to go ice-skating in muggle Paris. That had NOT been fun, despite how cute they both looked clumsily skating, with ear muffs and thick scarves.
At the time he had had everything so he had given the wish no extra thought. However, now, as the days grew longer, darker and a whole lot lonelier, he would have given every spare penny he owned to getting Harry back into his life. The way they used to be. Happy.
Back in the hotel Draco tried his best to ignore his screaming calves as Harry finished up in the shower. He could not remember a time when he had done so much walking in one day. As the shower was snapped off and Harry walked out, two towels wrapped around him, Draco curled up from the bed and hauled himself onto his feet. "I'd best shower too before we head back out."
Draco shook his head, "Why should we let it change anything between us? We're still friends first and foremost."
"Have you been to one of his lectures in Calais before?" Harry asked as he drained the rest of his champagne and then set it back behind him on the bar.
Draco looked up at him smiling gently and stepped forward to stroke his fingers against Harry's cheek. The brunette man shivered involuntarily and averted his gaze before licking his lips and forcing a smile onto his mouth. His eyes drifted over to the candlelight that was flickering over the softly painted walls. Draco's eyes shone with a hurt glint but it was gone within a moment as he turned with a smile on his pale pink lips, "Well you have been working yourself ragged these past few weeks and I just didn't want you to come home another night and have to struggle about cooking, so I thought I would sort it out for you." He hesitated for a moment before shifting a little awkwardly, "I know things at work are difficult for you and I know my bought of illness are hardly what you want to come home to, and I'm sorry for that. I just wanted to make some of it up to you, in any little way that I can."
Draco gnawed on his lip and straightened his back over his lover before spreading his thighs further and felt Harry's head push against his tight entrance. His mouth opened automatically and a symphony or moans trilled from his throat as he eased himself on Harry's thick, dripping length. It had been so long since they had made love -or had a good randy fuck. "Oh Merlin! Harry -when did you get so thick?" Draco whimpered as his back arched into Harry's gentle rocking rhythm.
Shaking his head, the older man took harry's wrist and drew it to his mouth. He pressed a kiss to the flushed flesh before guiding Harry down. Shifting over, he made room on the edge of the bed for his lover. Harry gratefully crawled onto the damp duvet and sigh contently at finally getting to relax. "I love it when you go wild," Draco mumbled into the black hair tucked under his chin.
Draco grimaced at coming home to a darkened place but at least he could move around once he lit the fires and set his clothes out for drying. By the time he'd get changed the place would be warm, he knew it.
Harry was extremely vocal even over the squeaking of the desk against the stone floor as Draco dominated the brunette boy and made true of every one of their maddening innuendos.
Lucius shook his head, "Do no worry, it almost takes something as simple as the weather changing to get him worked up. Although I wish he wasn't so exhausted afterwards. It's almost as though he must live a passionless life in order to live longer."
That evening, Harry returned to Calais.
Harry looked down at their entwined fingers and then up at the warm smoky grey eyes that were boring down into his own. The proximity and his gaze combined made Harry suddenly feel exposed and vulnerable, almost the same way Draco was when he was bared and naked for Harry to examine him. He swallowed past the lump in his throat. A shadow passed over the sun and a cool breeze made Harry shiver, unintentionally leaning closer to the blonde. "D-Draco …"
to one another.
The Notebook.
"Why?"
"I want you to enjoy every moment of this Harry," he breathed steadily through the gloomy air.
Draco turned his attention to the corner and a happy smile spread of his mouth, "Wow that's beautiful."
"Draco," he breathed out in a quiet voice, "Why didn't you go home for Christmas?"
There was no denying that there were feelings there, and they both knew it in the gentle moments of the night when they stayed later in the Room of Requirement than they were supposed to. The warmth of the fire and growing magic of the room, helped them to relax with one another and tentatively touch one another. It hadn't escalated past brief hugs and gentle hand-holding but Harry wasn't about to complain about it. They both knew the other was gay, but after everything that had happened before the Christmas holidays, he didn't want to ambush the blonde with emotions.
Harry frowned, pressing himself further against the blonde's chest. Had he completely miscalculated this? With a resigned sigh he said, "I guess it was too out of the norm, for you. I'm sorry. If you prefer it could have just been a one time thing."
Draco felt his nose grow hot and tingle as the promise of tears grew ever stronger in his eyes. He felt a large pearl cascade down his cheek and watched as Harry's eyes followed it down to the base of his throat. He sniffed loudly. Harry looked momentarily shocked before he reached up with heavy arms and cupped both of Draco's cheeks in his hands, his thumb wiping away the smooth tear-track from Draco's cheek. "There," he smiled, his thumb continuing to stroke Draco's baby-soft skin, "still as beautiful as ever."
Draco excused himself, his voice no more than a whisper, as he went into the kitchen to cook Harry something to eat. He looked as though he had not eaten in weeks -possibly more. The bags under his eyes were rough and heavy. His cheekbones were more prominent, and this worried Draco immensely as he boiled the water with a flick of his wand. He stared down at the bubbles, thinking that perhaps he should run Harry a bath. He was practically frozen to the bone. He sighed and added the chicken stock to the boiling pot of pasta, before bending down to put some food in Seeker's bowl.
As he brushed his teeth that morning, he ran a hand over the bristles now forming on his chin and around his mouth -he had not felt the need to shave recently. He did not want to end up getting wavering hands and slicing his jugular. Harry wouldn't appreciate bloodstains on the fluffy bath-mat on the floor. He dressed in a casual pair of jeans that did not cling onto his leg muscles too much, shrugged on a plain grey tee and threw on a random lumberjack-checked long-sleeve of the top. He was not in the mood to be ogled on the way there.
Draco felt a flush creep up his neck as he grasped his empty flute in his hand, his face devoid of colour, even more so now. "How on earth can you tell that I have powder on my face?" he hissed, "I bought it for the sole purpose that I was told it was undetectable!"
Harry let his eyes drift shut for a moment before opening them again. Everything felt so heavy and he didn't want to focus on the nightmares. He didn't even want to share them with Severus even if it did mean he might get some proper rest. He wanted to shake his head but he couldn't even do that. Should he tell Severus about the reasons why he didn't want to sleep? Or the reasons why he would wait until he was exhausted to the bone before dragging himself home to bed? Could he really reveal how messed up he was in his mind that his old teacher might even section him for some new experiment on the demons of his own psyche? He didn't know how he would cope if that happened. He didn't know how he would cope if that happened. And what about Draco? What. About. Draco? What was he doing risking Draco's health and everyone's else's something was clearly playing on his mind. He sighed and rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling his eyes raw and shining with a dampness. "I have been having nightmares that are making me not want to go to sleep. Since I've been working longer hours they sort of crept up on me and now … I can't sleep without seeing them play out in my eyes."
It wasn't that he doubted Draco's word, it was just he was so used to people coming up to him and saying
They were even starting to take more and more risks with one another.
"Yes!" he smacked a hand over his mouth and gave another shaky laugh, "I mean, yes of course I will." He held out his hand and let Draco slip the signet ring onto his left ring finger, "Are you sure you want to give me this ring, Draco?" he breathed as he traced the snake and large 'M' engraved into the antique silver.
Harry looked up at he approached the table and the surprise was bright in his eyes. It softened his stormy features for a moment as he swallowed, "D-Draco? What're you doing here?" he asked as he leaned back in his chair.
Behind them a chair manifested thanks to the room. The fireplace continued to crackle merrily, warming Draco's naked thighs as he pushed Harry down into the chair and dragged his trousers off his legs. He pressed long, passionate kisses over Harry's mouth, neck and chest as he ripped open his shirts. Buttons teetered over the flagstones, twinkling in the air. Harry panted and tugged at Draco's shirt, his legs spread and quaking with anticipation as Draco leaned over him, finally completely naked and highlighted with the glow from the fire. "Fuck you're sexy," he panted as he reached up and ran his hand down the blonde's muscled stomach.
As they lapsed into silence a hum ran through the room and something sparkled in the corner of the room. Harry turned to look and smiled at what he saw. He nudged Draco's foot with his own and pointed over to the corner, "Hey Draco, look what the room's given us for Christmas."
"How's that working out for you?" Draco asked, the sarcasm bringing a weak smile to Harry's mouth.
The grin that spread of Harry's face was more than enough compensation for it. His stomach flipped when he saw it. "I love you too!" he called back with a wink, before he turned on his heel and hurried back to Gryffindor Tower whilst Draco turned and quickly descended the stairs to the dungeons.
"It's natural to be afraid of the things that we don't understand or fully know about," he stated matter-of-factly, "If your son is afraid then it might be partially psychological and he hinders his own progression with medicine by his mind rejecting any help without intention."
It was sickening.
Harry waited not wanting to break the monologue of his companion –lover? –because he so desperately wanted to hear what the older man needed to get off his chest.
As he left the Entrance Hall and made his way along a hallway. He'd just turned a corner and yelped in surprise when a hand snatched his robes and dragged him along into one of the many alcoves dotted about. "Unhand me Potter!" he griped as he jerked his robes free.
Harry felt the heat on the back of his neck increase a little as he, too, inclined his head. "Your son very much flatters me, Lord Malfoy. I was merely explaining to him that he need not give up on modern medicine for we are now leaps and bounds ahead of where we were not three years ago and that if he had a regular physician there would be no need for ill-health for the majority of the year. He didn't seem particularly interested last night to continue our conversation though, so I am surprised he so much as mentioned me to you, your grace."
Draco frowned at the words and then found himself laughing, a bright chiming sound that startled Harry into a somewhat better mood, with his blonde head thrown back and his lungs aching sweetly at the effort. "Oh, Harry!" he gushed as he tilted his head to one side and stared intently at the brunette man, "If that's all you wanted you only had to say. Everyone judges what to do with me based on what you tell them. If you'd simply said so, it would have been established!" he wiped at his eyes of the weak tears of mirth that had trembled out, before swallowing and taking a long swig of iced water from his goblet.
. Magic
A shudder of tears and pent-up anguish were roiling around inside Draco's and he was struggling to contain it. He sniffled again, "Oh, Merlin, Harry -do you have any idea how much I miss you?"
Draco gave a weak smirk, "You really do think of everything, don't you Harry?"
Harry couldn't help the wide smile that spread across his face. He ducked his head shyly to control his features before peering back up at the blonde, "Yes, I would love that. I'll meet you here in the morning at about ... Eleven?"
Not that it made the occurrences any better.
As Draco returned to placing a few cautionary jumpers in one of the bags, Harry caught the sleeve of his hoodie, making Draco stop mid-motion. Draco looked down at his lover with soft, concerned eyes. He stroked a finger down Harry's cheek, "what's bothering you, love?" he asked in a soft, forcibly controlled voice. Hermione had shaken him that much was clear. When Harry did not immediately speak, he settled himself on the bed, the mattress dipping under his weight, and pulled Harry to his chest with a protective arm, the pile of jumpers forgotten for the moment. "Hm?"
He didn't mind the work or the familiarity of classes being back, but it still left him feeling a little hollow whenever the bell chimed for the end of class. It was strange seeing Hogwarts rebuilt to its former glory, especially when the last time he'd been there the stairs had been bathed in blood and the walls had been crumbling around his head. He had only returned to the school after the Christmas holidays. His mother had insisted on taking extra time to let him gather his thoughts and make an informed decision about his last year of education. He opted to go back as soon as the January term commenced. Pansy had returned much the same time as Draco and despite being shunned, it wasn't half as bad as the letter's she'd written to him, about the punishments Draco was forced to endure.
Draco lifted a corner of the towel and brushed it away, exposing Harry's skin to the cool air floating around the apartment. Harry shivered under his soft touches once again, before tensing and trying to reach for the covers, the towel -anything to cover up the obvious deterioration of his body. Draco stopped. He frowned before eventually emitting and soft sigh and reaching down on the floor beside him for the soft pin-striped blue and lilac pyjamas that Harry had removed from the dresser. They were soft under his fingertips. "You've made a good choice with these, Harry," he breathed as he took one of Harry's wrists lightly in his fingers and guided it through the sleeve of the open shirt. He did the same with the other arm, the weight of Harry's gaze upon him the entire time. Nimble, talented fingers skillfully slid each pearly purple button into its respective hole before the blond man leaned back to look at his handiwork. "Very nice," he smiled, straightening the collar around Harry's neck. He then stood up, and offered his arms out for Harry to mirror his actions.
The next day he couldn't deny it anymore. He was weak, as weak and pathetic as the Dark Lord always declared in front of his inner circle of followers. He was the weak link in the Malfoy chain and it had been his fault that they had fallen from his good graces. As insane as it all was coming from the flat lips of the snake-faced maniac, those words still haunted his mind now. He couldn't run from the worlds nor could he erase the imagery from behind his eyelids. It was all too much. Every shadow held a Dementor ready and waiting to suck what was left of his broken soul, every person's eyes would flash red for a brief moment. Their whispers were like the hissing of a thousand snakes ready to coil around him and suffocate him.
It was over almost as soon as it had begun.
He snapped his head up and mentally cursed his luck. He groaned and clenched his jaw tightly, "Stop trying to be a damned hero Potter. I get it. You won. No need to come and gloat."
Draco's expression was soft, a mask-less face he only let Harry see and only when they were completely alone together, as he waited for the brunette to speak.
Draco reached out and grasped Harry's hand in his own, "Don't doubt yourself for a moment. You are the smartest person Severus has ever taken on, and I should know. I've seen the letters he sends to father. You are going to be fine, I promise you."
"And those riddles, what were those, eh?"
The words had dropped through the air like rocks into a well. The image of Harry's broken body in his arms whilst they both sank to the hardwood floor -tears trickling from their eyes -was forever engraved into his mind. It broke his heart, that day, to know that he was powerless to mend Harry's pain. He should have been able to do something -anything to make it better. But there was nothing he could do, except eventually help Harry summon enough strength to travel to the hospital to talk further about the diagnosis.
"Won't it feel weird?"
"Malfoy?" he murmured, trying to catch the older boy's attention.
On the sixteenth of December the second incident occurred; Draco had slept late and missed breakfast and missed lunch due to trying to catch up on his assignments and redoing a potions essay that he had all but demanded back from Slughorn so that he could redo it. He had practically finished it when he traipsed back to his dorms before realizing why it was so empty; everyone was in the Great Hall having their dinner. He'd groaned and rubbed his hand down his face and collapsed onto the bed and dozed off. When he woke up around forty odd minutes later he was so hungry he felt practically crippled with the hunger pains. He'd stumbled out to use the bathroom and when he came back he was stunned to find a plate of smoked ham and mustard sandwiches and some salmon and brie sandwiches stacked high and the mere sight of them made him salivate and dive for the meal.
,' he reasoned with himself as the knot in his chest reappeared and he coughed against the back of his hand. Damned damp weather! Slipping the leather flap back he pulled out the first bundle out of one of the pockets unknotted the twine and then slipped the first letter out of its thick envelope. He wasn't quite sure what he'd been expecting –after all it had been ten and a half years ago –but he had erased the brutality of the first few letters and the main that those words had caused him just by reading them over and over again by candlelight. The writing was scratchy and manic, veering off from side-to-side of the page, no eloquence to the letters at all. Not like the writing style in all of Harry's old medical reports and patient files. Swallowing thickly, his eyes flickered to the date in the top right hand corner and frowned, taking a deep breath to prepare himself.
By the end of the day, leaning over a bubbling cauldron, he felt exhausted but there was a small encouraging voice in the back of his mind telling him that it was worth it. He could be on the verge of a medical breakthrough for the wizarding community, and if he were Draco would be a part of that discovery. He couldn't deny he was excited about it. As the night wore on and the deadline for the potion was drawing to a close, he couldn't help but let Severus' words echo in his head. He was going to be professional when it came to Draco's health but at the same time he was a friend now and that meant doing whatever it could take to ensure that your friend got as good medical attention as possible. And if he was the one to do that then so be it. It just meant that he knew the job would be done well. As soon as the potion had brewed, he lifted it off the burner to cool and cleared away his appliances before ladling the contents of the cauldron into several phials for Severus' stock and a few for him to take in his trunk to the Manor.
Theo held up his hands in surrender, "Hey calm down, I'm trying to list off the possibilities here."
Draco clenched his thighs together and panted heavily in the crook of Harry's neck, "are you sure baby?"
For his part Harry felt such great relief that he had been able to aid in Draco's good health and found studying and working on his personal assignment almost 'fun'. He enjoyed it and the research was lodged in his brain from having reiterated to Draco two weekends in a row. Not that he cared. He loved to spend time with Draco and travelling to Paris was a nice change of scenery from Calais, especially the hospital and his gloomy little room.
"He was going to let me die!" Draco spat out, his fair features flushing scarlet. His fingers tightened into fists, his knuckles flashing white, "What would you do?"
Draco waved his hand, "Nonsense. If you'll allow me I'm sure there is something of mine that would fit you. I haven't cleared out any of my smaller robes, so I am sure one of them would fit you perfectly."
His skin looked so pale, like the starched sheets he was lying chemotherapy had removed all signs of hair from his face and head -no unruly mop of black hair, no 5 o'clock shadow, no eyebrows either. Just an unnaturally bald head that made the lightning bolt scar on his forehead loom bold and devilishly red against the pale canvas of his lovers skin.
Harry chuckled but obliged as he turned back towards the direction of the hotel, his fingers entwining with Draco's own as they walked.
"I shouldn't have to spell these things out for you, Draco," Harry snipped irritably as he wriggled further down into the last clean sheet over his body. "If you wish to continue this then I see no reason in denying you now."
"And why would they do that Draco? They're professionals!"
Draco smiled and disappeared into the bathroom.
Something flickered in his chest and he was snapped back to reality, the heat of the sun and the fizzing of the bubbles before his eyes. Panic spiked through his mind and he lurched to his feet, his arms flaying out as the boat rocked under him. How long had he been daydreaming? Was it too long? Too late? It couldn't be –he wouldn't let it be. He wasn't about to give up on Draco and risking the rest of his life without those tender soft moments that stopped him from putting the pillow over his face.
Nodding his head, the younger wizard brushed his hands under Draco's shirt, giving his tight shoulders a squeeze. "Positive. And this time ... I want to make love to you."
He couldn't.
Harry grinned broadly as he toyed with Draco's collar. "Well ... I think it's time I collected on this years promise."
"Are you trying to kill me?" he asked as his hands came to rest on Harry's neck.
As they took their seats on the tram Harry rested his weary head on his lover's shoulder, grateful that they were able to use a tram instead of having to walk. His eyes were half open and staring blankly as they traveled along the promenade, the sun glistening off of the sea and through the long windows. It was truly a beautiful place to be. He was grateful that Draco had gone through all of this trouble for him. He had no idea where they were presently going but he did not mind. He was happy to go anyway as long as he held the food down for the remainder of the evening.
Harry blushed and closed his door and placed the items in his hands on the small desk. "How did you get into my room?" he asked a little tightly.
"You really think it could be worse?" the blonde man asked as he wrapped a sheet around his shoulders, a cold shiver passing through him. He watched Harry's honest face betray his ignorance.
They'd been dragged all the way up here on the pretence of relaxing and to watch the boating festival on the 29th of August. He was pretty sure that Severus didn't care about the boats either but he refrained from saying so. It wasn't really his business. And he had to admit it did feel cooler near the lack than in the thickly packed streets of Paris and in the suffocating corridors of the hospital. Not that he'd really been going there until midday most days anyway. He felt as though he didn't have the courage once he'd stepped off the train every morning. He always went across the road from the station to a low rent bar and drank a couple of rounds of gin or whiskey and drown the throbbing in his head. He sighed through his nose and ran a hand through his hair, tugging slightly to waken him up a little more. Sometimes, when he was in the bar, the barmaid –Hermione –would lend a tentative ear and offered her opinions but sometimes he didn't even want to hear that. Sometimes he simply wanted to drink. He'd gotten quite drunk on the Sunday night when they'd returned from vising Draco's parents and Severus' little revelation that he knew about his and Draco's sordid little love affair –not that is was benefiting them at the moment. It didn't take too long for Severus to diagnose him with depression and had offered some therapy and some mood balancing potions, something Harry had been avoiding like the plague. He knew Draco had packed them in his own trunk but he still wasn't taking them. He'd take them into the bathroom and tip it down the sink and rinse it away.
Since then he
And there it was –the final nail in the coffin.
Harry grunted low in his throat. "Like I've been drained," he muttered bitterly.
The Easter holidays were almost over, the next month would be swallowed completely by their NEWT's exams and then applying to numerous jobs over the summer to start building their paths in the world. He knew he should be over-joyed by the prospect of it all, but in all honesty it just left him feeling incredibly hollow. As though life was suddenly to fickle and meaningless at this point. It was another one of those things that he kept to himself, mostly because he didn't want to depress his friends with how morbid his own thoughts really were. Even as close as he had gotten to Draco in the months following Christmas, he wasn't sure that he could trust himself to find the right words.
No one cared about him.
Severus sighed but inclined his head, "Very well if that's all I'm going to get from you, then so be it."
Harry was a little surprised but tried not to show it too much. He swallowed thickly and thought back to that night a whole year ago and tried to think of the words to describe just how ethereal it had been. He chewed on his lip and was grateful that Draco didn't stare at him until he fessed up like Hermione would have, or been humming with dread like Ron.
Harry swatted his chest. "Behave, or I'll dump this on your face." Draco scowled but didn't say another word. "Does it hurt?" he asked somewhat cautiously, as he finished drying up the damp patches with the left over tissue.
"How did you know where to find me?" he asked quietly as he fiddled with his wand in his lap.
The motorway was endless but the bright blue skies that stretched far and wide above them were something to be admired. His favourite colour was blue -most assumed it was green because of him being in Slytherin and the colour of Harry's eyes. But it was blue -the perfect blue of an unspoiled Summer sky.
He hated hearing those words. Whenever they'd tried to do something without magic, it had always left Draco feeling ... like he was lacking something. Most of those experiences had been limited to cooking and travel but sex ... that was just too intimate to tamper with, surely? Leaning back, he regarded Harry with scrutiny. "Are you sure?"
Once he was focused purely on getting head, Draco was able to relax and ease into the rhythm of Harry working his entrance. He had about three fingers inside him now, which was usually more than enough. His stomach flipped at the thought of being filled up! Usually they'd be done with foreplay and into some deep serious love-making right about now. There was usually very little focus about lube or protection charms of potions. It was all there within a snap of their fingers.
Slipping into his own nightshirt he went over to close the curtains and then returned to his own single bed on the other side of the room and crawled in between the cool, clean sheets and settled down to sleep.
"Why not?" Draco countered softly, picking at a frayed thread on the armchair, "You're the head healer; just tell them you're cashing in your time for a holiday, a break. You deserve it more than anyone."
"I'm sorry I hurt you last night," he finally sighed as the chill rising from the lake made his skin break out in goosepimples.
Draco rolled his eyes, "Do whatever you want, Weasley, but I for one, am going back to my bedroom to pack."
Of course, their budding friendship didn't mean that it was all smooth sailing from there. Many people were in uproar when they found out and tried to break the companionship apart with hexes, and threats and even a statement in the prophet raised a lot of queries of their saviour turning 'dark'. Despite the fact that both boys said that they didn't care what people said about them, it was hard to keep all the emotions locked up for too long. It got to the point where they would even ask Ron and Hermione, as awkward as it was at first, to help chaperone their duelling stress-relief sessions. Hermione called an early start the first couple of times but soon she got used to it. She didn't agree with it, or condone it, but when it came down to it she ground her teeth and bore it as she watched the two boys vent.
