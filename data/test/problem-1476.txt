Malfoy tells him about his cat, Artemis, that he picked up at a Muggle animal shelter. He’s got pictures in his wallet, and he shows each of the tiny polaroids to Harry with a look of paternal pride that makes Harry laugh so hard he nearly cries. (Artemis is a very beautiful cat, of course.)
Draco smiles, looking up at the ceiling as his eyes begin to sting. He really did think he was out of tears.
Draco groans again. ‘Ugh,’ he whines. ‘The next time I ask you to pound my arse into next Sunday, kindly remind me that I am no longer a flexible little twink.’
The master bedroom is just as lovely as the living room. The furniture is made from a pale wood, and there are hand-woven rugs spread out underfoot over the carpeted floor, likely to protect Narcissa’s feet from getting cold on the long winter nights.
Harry opens the door to his suite and utters a low curse. Clearly, he’s going to have to have a conversation with hotel management about their security policy, because Daphne Greengrass is sitting on his hotel bed, looking very cross with him.
He is here to help, not hinder, so Draco takes a deep breath and says, as calmly as he can, ‘Harry has never been very good at sharing his burdens.’
Malfoy looks down at his arm. ‘It always hurts,’ he replies softly. ‘He cuts a piece of you open and sticks a curse there, makes it bind with your flesh and bone and soul. Some nights I can feel it worming its way into my blood, waiting for its master to yank on my leash.’
‘Nothing,’ Harry says. ‘Nothing in Brussels, nothing in Paris. No one’s seen or heard from Draco in over a week, and there’s no sign of a struggle, no trace magic anywhere. And in my experience, there’s always
Harry holds out his hands and lets the ledger fall into his palms. He gives its contents a brief once-over. The writing is printed by typewriter instead of by hand, each section organized chronologically and then alphabetically. It will be hard work, of course, given Harry’s shortcomings with numbers, but an organized ledger shaves off hours -
Once Ron clears everyone to go back on the roller coasters, Hugo decides that, actually, he’s done with the rides, thank you very much, and would prefer to go see the botanical gardens. They agree to split up and meet by the gates at closing. Teddy and Victoire take charge of Rose, heading back into the park to use up their fast passes, while Ron takes Hugo off to the botanical garden, leaving Harry and Draco a few hours of peace.
‘You will hand me that volume this instance,’ Daphne demands, ‘or I will ban you from the Yuletide Wizarding War Orphans’ Benefit this Christmas.’
Draco sighs and leans his head on his fingertips, his elbow propped on the arm of his chair. ‘He wanted me to fix a modified Time-Turner for him. Or rather,’ he clarifies, ‘he wanted me to fix it, then modify it further. The Time-Turner he gave me was capable of turning back weeks. He wanted years. Decades, actually. I refused him at first - I only gave in after he threatened to turn his wand on my mother.’
Draco pulls away first, his breath falling raggedly against Harry’s swollen lips. His hand hovers above Harry’s thundering heart. He opens his eyes slowly, and they are luminescent.
‘You’re sure you’re up for this?’ Blaise asks, his voice lowered as he squints at the bottle of wine in his hand. ‘That’s some complicated enchantment you boys cooked up. It’s not going to be an easy one to cast.’
Draco sighs, closing his eyes momentarily. ‘I see that you still aren’t above conducting diagnoses without your patient’s consent,’ he says, but it lacks bite.
Stephen bares his teeth in a viper’s smile. ‘Auror Smythe,’ he says, cordial as ever. ‘I suggest you comply with my wife’s request now.’
A few students are caught in the storm as it descends upon the sloping, green hills. They come running up into the castle, their shouts of surprise and laughter nearly drowned by the torrential rain. One girl - a fifth-year - shoves her wand in the air and casts a particularly impressive umbrella charm, modified to fit all her friends underneath. Harry watches the rain bounce off the invisible dome around the young witch, takes note of the colour of her tie, and waves his wand.
They stand in companionable silence for a while, watching the stars. The moon reappears from behind a cloud bank, and it bathes the Forbidden Forest in a wash of silver.
Harry pushes down a tide of bitter irritation at Blaise (he’s just doing his job, after all) and helps Draco back into the armchair. He hands Draco his array of potions.
Harry thinks about warm looks over dining room tables and the taste of champagne and fireworks exploding in the sky and the way people lean together when they yearn for one another, and he doesn’t even know why he keeps holding himself back, why he doesn’t just reach forwards and ask.
‘Of course,’ Draco laughs, a little watery, and extends his arms. ‘There’s no one else I would pick, love.’
lunch,’ interjects Ron, snatching the tickets out of his niece’s hand. ‘I promised your parents I’d feed and water you properly.’
After Harry’s last day as an Auror, his friends throw a surprise party at Grimmauld Place. They hit him with a shower of confetti as he enters through the door and he nearly hexes their faces off for it. There’s cake and takeaway (much to Kreacher’s disapproval) and there are ugly paper streamers hanging off every surface. Luna makes something that she claims is salad, only, no salad should be
I don’t know why I’ve decided that grown-up Harry’s response to emotional meltdowns is to make tea, but that’s what my friends used to do all the time when I was sitting in the living room having a stress-meltdown.
‘Really sorry about the intrusion, Headmistress,’ apologizes Proudfoot. He sounds sincere, at least, but he’s avoiding Harry’s eye. Maybe he’s disappointed in Harry’s wasted potential.
She lets him press a kiss into her cheek, her eyes crinkling as her face lights up with a wide, genuine smile. ‘Blaise,’ she says, looking him over as they draw apart. ‘You look well. I’m so pleased you came to see me. And with Mr. Potter, too.’
Harry looks up from where he’s sitting on the floor of her bedroom, scanning through letters and notes Draco’s owled Pansy over the past few months. She’s sprawled across her bed with a heavy volume sitting on her ribcage, an empty bottle of Ogden’s lying beside her.
He rubs the Anchors on his forearms and huffs out a soundless laugh. Pansy was right after all. Harry found Draco because he loves Draco enough to imprint him on his skin.
‘I worked as slowly as possible,’ Draco continues. His smile is a wry twist of the lips. ‘My father is talented when it comes to manipulation and petty politics, but he is rather lacking in magical knowledge. I was able to sabotage myself plenty of times.’
It’s from a charming Muggle film he saw a million years ago when they were still Malfoy and Potter, their hands spaced politely apart in the dark, in front of the bright screen and amidst the sweeping score rising all around them like an unstoppable flood.
Harry frowns. ‘Hey, I know about time magic,’ he says, feeling a little defensive. ‘I’ve done some research.’
). Harry hates the spinny rides so he sits them out, sharing ice cream with Rose on the benches. Draco, however, takes to it with childlike glee, his arms stuck in the air as Teddy spins their seat around and around and around with sadistic delight. At some point, Rose tricks Ron into getting on a ride featuring a very large, very unrealistic spider that makes him shriek so loudly it nearly deafens their whole troupe - which, in Harry’s opinion, is probably his penance for letting George-fucking-Weasley babysit the kids during their formative years.
‘I’ll try something different.’ Harry gets up and pulls a set of cards from one of the drawers in the living room. ‘Let’s say each card is one hour. If I turn back the clock one hour, I get two cards. I can only arrange two possibilities with two cards.’
‘Easier than breathing,’ he whispers, and Harry realises that he’s tired of running from what he wants.
‘Oh, that’s very kind of you,’ Charlie says, his eyes flashing up to Blaise’s face. He raises his eyebrows. ‘I don’t think we’ve met before.’
‘Why the hell does anyone read this?’ he says aloud, waving the book at Draco. ‘This is twisted stuff.’
‘Two weeks?’ Harry repeats. He’s losing his mind. He has to be. Or else he inhaled a hallucinogenic spore in Neville’s greenhouse and is now having a very bad trip.
Narcissa nods sagely. ‘Draco takes care of me,’ she responds. ‘He always takes care of me. He’s a good boy.’
‘Look,’ she says, shoving his shoulder with no small amount of force, ‘it’s my wedding, so I’m going to do and say what I bloody well like, and you’re going to have to put up with it.’ She glares at him through narrowed eyes. ‘You tell that man you love him, Harry Potter, because if I get to have a happy-ever-after, then you’d better get off your fucking arse and get yours too, or else I’ll feel like an absolute cunt forever and be forced to resort to Pansy Parkinson methods of redemption.’
Acquafredda narrows his eyes almost imperceptibly. ‘Of course, Professor,’ he replies. ‘I am paid very well to assist Master Malfoy and his family, which, as I understand it, includes you.’ He rises from his seat, sending the rest of the ledgers back to their place with another wave of his wand. ‘I will be in the next room with my clients. Please, feel free to use my study.’
Charlie shows up by the time half the pie is gone, looking weather-beaten and travel weary. He drops his suitcase by the umbrella stand and comes over to kiss his mother on the cheek.
Draco looks like he wants to say something, but he bites down on his lower lip and smiles a strange, sad little smile, and then doesn’t say anything else at all. Instead, he sits there, folded into Harry, pressing closer than they really should, and Harry’s heart is too bruised-knees-tender to regret it.
I actually really like the vegan places in Soho. I went to Mildred’s for a friend’s birthday and it was so very good.
. Ginny treads on her own dress halfway through the vows and falls into her bridesmaids, losing the bouquet and ripping her dress all the way up to her waist. Neville nearly cries, he’s laughing so hard. He ends up dropping the rings and Hermione has to Summon them back from the mud again.
‘What the actual fuck, Potter?’ Pansy says, a groove appearing between her eyebrows. ‘That’s not normal.’
Malfoy just sat there, mutely accepting all the ludicrous charges against him, shackled, and shoved into a warded cage as though he were some dangerous criminal. Harry couldn’t peel his eyes away from Malfoy’s hands, twitching and jerking helplessly in his lap. His wrists were so thin the shackles didn’t even fit.
‘What is she doing?’ Ron asks, looking quizzically over at Malfoy. His shirt is now a painful shade of fuchsia, peppered with vomit-coloured polka dots, which adds to the effect somehow.
It is the witching hour, and Draco looks drunk. His eyes are smudged and soft like headlights shining through a rain-damp windshield. A blush spreads from his cheeks, down to his collarbones and over his chest. Harry traces his hand down it, fascinated and a little bit possessive.
‘Your record will be clear of all charges,’ Kingsley says, lowering his wand. ‘You are free to go. The DMLE will leave you in peace. And, Harry, by my wife’s life, I swear I will see this investigation to the end. This ends here.’
‘Right,’ he says, tucking his chin almost imperceptibly, as though readying himself. ‘So. I had this bizarre and clearly unfounded belief that you would be entirely inexperienced. I had myself entirely convinced that I would have to show you where everything was.’
‘What do you mean, Draco’s missing?’ Hermione demands, striding out of the fireplace in Harry’s study. She’s still dressed in her formal robes, with her hair pulled back into a severe bun.
While it can’t hold a candle to his greenhouses at Hogwarts, Neville’s back garden holds an impressive array of magical and Muggle plants, with a meandering stone path that works its way from the conservatory at the back of the house down to the stream that separates Neville’s property from the forest.
‘Oh, for Merlin’s sake, man,’ Kingsley says. He waves his wand in a complicated motion, and the restraints fall away from Harry’s limbs in harmless strips of metal.
Hermione’s eyes flick back and forth as she scans the document at an alarming pace. Her lips grow thinner and thinner, her expression pinched, which can only mean that everything is in order.
I've been so tired recently I end up writing bullet points like EMOTION HERE and MAYBE THEY KISS GOD I NEED SLEEP. Why do I have a day job? I should just sit at home and write fic all day.
‘Then he shall be counted as a war hero for his sacrifice,’ the witch states with firm authority, ‘as Severus Snape was.’
‘Did you have a nightmare?’ Draco asks his nephew. Teddy’s hair only turns that colour after a bad dream.
He looks down at his fingers and wiggles them experimentally. They seem fine enough, but maybe there’s residual curse damage from the last duel that didn’t get picked up by the Healers. It’s happened before.
Draco leans into Harry’s side, his forehead wrinkling with worry. ‘Should we perhaps inform them that we don’t actually have wedding plans?’ he asks in a lowered voice. ‘I truly don’t want to disappoint them - it’s just that I haven’t even picked out a ring-’
Harry lifts his hand in defeat and pulls the nearest tray towards him, ignoring the curry chips in favour of what is attempting to be fried chicken.
Harry’s just returning from the bar with a drink for himself and Luna when he sees, belatedly, that Luna’s already got a new drink in her hand. A very tall, almost Luna-esque woman is standing by her side, balancing a glass of peach Bellini in the cradle of her fingers. She’s dressed in long, flowing robes of silvery lilac, and her long, golden hair is wound up into a messy bun. There are multi-layered hoops hanging from her ears, and they spin in mesmerizing patterns as she moves.
Harry fetches the stemless glasses from one of the cabinets and pours the Merlot. Draco prefers white wine, but he always buys them red when Harry comes over, the same way he always makes Harry’s favourite things for dinner. They move out into the living room and sit on the sofa, Draco curling his bare feet beneath him while Harry lifts his feet up onto the footrest. They talk for a while, Draco rambling on at length about a new potion he’s developed that keeps hair tangle-free for weeks. He’s particularly proud of creating solutions to innocuous, everyday problems - it's what makes him different from every other Apothecary.
A white peacock-feather quill lies next to the letter, alongside an ink blotter, all laid out in preparation for the completion of the letter.
‘Yes, precisely.’ Marsters drains the last of his coffee and sets it down on the table. He gestures at the waiter, summoning him over to collect the bill. ‘Tread carefully, Mr. Potter,’ he says, his eyes fixed on the approaching waiter. ‘The DMLE is a dangerous enemy to make.’
Acquafredda pulls a small silver flask from the pocket of his waistcoat and tips a tiny bit of it into a cup before handing the coffee to her. ‘I can go through it with you if you like,’ he offers.
Ron wanders over to the mess scattered over the bed, squinting slightly as he scans over Harry’s scribbled notes. He should really get himself a pair of reading glasses, but Ron’s as stubborn as they come.
‘Then he shall be counted as a war hero for his sacrifice,’ the witch states with firm authority, ‘as Severus Snape was.’
According to Draco, they can’t stay upstairs avoiding their teenage nephew/godson/adoptive son forever, so Harry drags himself out of bed. He has a brief, very professional meltdown as he gets dressed and then they both head downstairs for breakfast.
Harry rests his head against his knees, his palms braced on the tops of his shins as he keeps his eyes fixed on Draco’s face. ‘Alright then,’ he says.
Harry sits on his desk, thighs spread and arms folded over his chest. ‘Well this is a bit familiar, isn’t it?’ he asks with a slight grin.
Harry perches on the side of Draco’s chair, feeling too unsettled to sit on the couch. This is going to be a difficult interview - and not just for Draco.
Harry arches his eyebrows as he lets Neville’s words digest. ‘That was actually quite solid advice,’ he remarks. ‘I’m very proud of you.’
‘Professor Harry James Potter,’ says Smythe, enunciating each syllable loudly enough for the entire ballroom to hear. ‘By order of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, you are under arrest.’
Malfoy sneaks down into the dungeons later, his eyes dark and his cheeks sunken, and he presses chocolate into Harry’s palm. The fingers of Malfoy’s left hand twitch uncontrollably, and he nearly drops the tiny packet of silver foil and coloured paper.  ‘It’s all I have left,’ he whispers. ‘I’m so sorry.’
to the traditions of yesteryear-’ - and Harry thinks he should feel bad for Blaise, probably, but then Draco bursts into a fit of giggles, and then Harry’s laughing too, smothering his guffaws with his hand, so they stand in the kitchen, clutching each other and trying to be as quiet as possible.
Harry cups Draco’s face, guiding his trailing gaze back up to meet Harry’s eyes. ‘Don’t set yourself aflame,’ he says, a little bit teasing and a little bit solemn. ‘You promised.’
Neville pops by later that afternoon, to Harry’s great surprise, seeing how it’s a weekday and the middle of the summer term.
‘I’m sorry,’ frowns another member of the Wizengamot - a witch with cranberry-shaped earrings. ‘I thought you said he helped kill Voldemort.’
Pansy stares back at him defiantly, arching her eyebrows. She transfigures Harry’s saucer into a fork and stabs it into the chips, pushing the steaming tray over to Harry’s side of the table. She reaches into her jacket pocket and pulls out a folded-up square of lilac paper.
Harry shakes his head in response to Neville’s question. His now-empty bottle is still collecting moisture on the low table sat between their respective chairs, and he is already pleasantly buzzed from the sugar and low alcohol content. He lifts his feet up and crosses his legs, finding a more comfortable position on the padded seat.
His father is locked away in prison. A horrible, angry part of him wishes his father had died in the Battle of Hogwarts. But his father was never very good at fighting someone who could face him as his equal. He lives because he hid.
. Harry remembers him at the funeral, ruddy-faced and red-eyed, standing at the edges of the gathered crowd with flowers bunched in his fist as he stared helplessly at Andromeda, holding Teddy in her arms. Harry remembers how Andromeda looked then, too, standing quietly beside her sobbing husband, full of so much rage and grief that it seemed like her slender bones had no space for it.
Proudfoot frowns heavily. ‘That’s a coincidence,’ he says. ‘And besides, how were we supposed to know about, er-’ he waves his hand in a broad stroke, ‘-the possession thing? Quirrell came back, said nothing was wrong. He seemed normal enough.’
‘Meaning,’ Guy interjects with a broad grin, ‘for the purposes of cooperating with official instructions, we
‘We’ve sold emergency portkeys, impenetrable doors and windows, wearable wards, protective charms - you name it.’ Angel counts off his fingers as he reels off the list, rings shimmering as he moves his hands. Harry can feel the quiet hum of the protective magic woven into them. ‘We try and keep a varied price range. People should be able to afford to be safe, y’know. But not everything we make is within the average witch or wizard’s budget.’
‘- but you’ve turned out just fine,’ Hagrid continues, dabbing at his eyes with a lace-edged handkerchief. ‘Just fine. You’ve done a good job caring for him and protecting him when he deserves protecting, and I can tell you love him just as much as I do. Ain’t a lot of people in Harry’s life I would trust, but I would trust you.’
‘I don’t suppose you tell me where the panic room is located in Narcissa’s apartment?’ he asks tentatively.
Narcissa stares at Harry for a while, blinking too few times for his comfort. ‘He doesn’t come round on weekdays, he sends Pansy. He visits on weekends. He never wants me to be afraid or alone. I wish he wasn’t such a good boy, Mr. Potter. You know that. You must know.’ And, then, again: ‘I love him more than anything.’
He tilts his body towards Harry’s, and instinctively, Harry tucks his hand at the curve of Draco’s waist and pulls him until they are pressed close against each other. Draco’s scent is imprinted on Harry’s skin - and his sheets, his pillows, his whole life.
Harry notices, then, that Draco has gone very still. His hands are clenched so tightly his knuckles have gone pale. For a moment, Harry is worried that Hagrid’s broken some sort of archaic wizarding tradition or insulted Draco in some manner, but then Draco vaults off the bench and goes running towards Hagrid, tackling him in what looks like a bone-crushing hug.
He’s just about to sit down and tackle the next stack of papers when the door to his suite swings open. Pansy strides in, sporting extremely large sunglasses and an armful of what appears to be takeout.
So he finishes his espresso and gets up, striding out into the street. Above him, the colour of the sky deepens and Paris is aglow with silver and gold.
‘Imagine if they’d got along in school,’ Ron says to Harry, nodding at the two of them whirling around the dance floor.
‘If you require any assistance, please do let Antimony know,’ Acquafredda says, indicating the snake. ‘He will come fetch me.’
Malfoy shakes his head. ‘I can’t. I can’t go on like this.’ His eyes are as bright as starshine. Everything else about him is coloured in ash and bone. ‘You don’t know what I’ve done. You don’t know what he’s made me do.’
Narcissa takes the stand first, as the only person witness to the whole kidnapping. She sets one hand on the railing while the other clenches around an embroidered kerchief in her lap. In her silver-and-eggshell robes and with her hair pinned neatly back, she looks the perfect aristocrat.
Malfoy punctuates his declaration by shoving the spoonful of whipped cream and marshmallows into his mouth. A tiny bit of whipped cream clings to the corner of his mouth, and it stays there for a while until Malfoy takes another spoonful, and wipes at his mouth with a napkin.
The shop assistant stands up, a jar of preserved newt eyes cradled in his hands, and Harry’s eyes widen as he recognizes him.
Malfoy hands Harry a drink that’s two parts vodka and one part lemonade. ‘Brace yourself, Potter,’ he says wearily. ‘It’s all downhill from here.’
‘You wanted to try the eggs benedict at that place - the brunch we were supposed to go to,’ Harry explains, nodding at the near-perfect eggs benedict on the plate. There is also smoked salmon, and kippers, and bagels spread with cream cheese, and strawberries with the stems cut off. ‘I looked up the recipe a while ago. Pretty hard to make eggs benedict, as it turns out,’ he adds, chuckling.
‘Don’t make me have feelings, Potter,’ he says archly, gesturing at Harry with his usual aristocratic flair. ‘I know you’re rather good at it, but I will not have feelings. Not tonight.’
‘I do recall peripheral vision being part of the average wizard’s biology,’ he sighs, when a witch happened to figure out Harry’s blind spot and used it to nearly incinerate his arm. ‘Congratulations on evolving out of such primitive things.’
Despite the amount of champagne she’s consumed, she is actually a rather good dancer when she’s not paired up with Ron’s shoddy footwork.
Teddy makes a soft little humming noise in his throat. ‘Okay,’ he says, sounding significantly more lucid. ‘I’ll stay with you then. D’you want fancy tea or normal tea? I can put the kettle on.’
can’t it be this combination of spells?’ He jabs his finger in the general direction of the glowing sphere in the middle of the room. ‘It’s what I would use.’
He tries not to sleep. Instead, he lies in the dark and stares up at the ceiling, trying to recall the weight of Draco slumbering beside him, or the hum of his magic perfectly aligned with Harry’s Anchors.
The tattoos took a total of five hours to complete. Harry recalls falling asleep halfway through the process and then waking up to the bizarre sensation of another person’s magical signature thrumming in his veins, skittering over his own magic like snowflakes drifting over dark water.
Harry stares at the glowing sign hanging above the tall, glass door, wondering if he’s managed to fall into some alternative universe where Draco-sodding-Malfoy frequents Muggle coffee chains.
Acquafredda seems to notice Harry’s expression of abject horror and seems to take pity on him. He waves his wand and spells a volume over to Harry. ‘This particular ledger will be of interest to you, I believe.’
To mark the start of summer holidays, Teddy decides that Rose and Hugo need to experience the Muggle-made wonder of Alton Towers. Harry isn’t entirely sure how Teddy manages to convince anyone that this is a good idea, but the end result has Ron waking up at the crack of dawn to shove them all into his minivan and drive them into the heart of the country.
‘I was wondering if you’d be able to answer a few questions,’ Harry says. He pulls his Unspeakable paperwork out of his pocket and un-shrinks it before handing it over to Angel Lopez.
‘I can’t believe you made me wait nearly half an hour, Potter,’ Malfoy grumbles. He’s sitting with his knees pressed up against his chest, his fingers interlaced as he hugs his legs close. A fit of trembling makes him shudder, his face creasing with the force of it.
He doesn’t tell Malfoy about the way he can’t sleep anymore, or that he sometimes loses his temper with the people that he loves, that sometimes Ginny says something careless when they’re bickering and it digs under Harry’s skin like a poisonous barb, and he has to go somewhere quiet and just wait for all that anger to boil away. He doesn’t tell Malfoy that, since he died in the Forbidden Forest, he’s not quite so afraid of death anymore and maybe that’s a bad thing, because sometimes when he’s on the hunt he feels like a weapon instead of a person but he kind of likes the emptiness of it all, except when it’s all done and he’s back in his cubicle with a stack of paperwork all he can think about is the way that a curse just tastes different to say out loud, so he spends his sleepless nights learning how to do them all wordlessly.
Harry leans over towards the fallen Auror, resting his elbow on his knee. ‘Auror Smythe,’ he says, still smiling, ‘I’d like to remind you that this is school property, and that while you have a warrant to ask me questions, you don’t have a warrant to tamper with any of my belongings, personal or otherwise. So, either get on with the investigation, or get the hell out.’
Harry nods, the movements slow. He feels as though he is still in freefall, and so he clings desperately to Draco’s forearm. ‘I know,’ he says, as winded as though he were punched in the gut. ‘Draco, that was - that was -’
Lucius Malfoy gave him an armoury of weapons. It gives Draco a strange sense of satisfaction to use them against him now. His gift at letter-writing is some parts talent, some parts a very thorough education in diplomacy and bureaucracy.
Harry catches him by the waist and presses open-mouthed kisses against Draco’s neck. ‘What have I done to deserve such cruel words from my beloved?’ he sighs in mock despair. ‘All I do shower him in love and admiration.’
Proudfoot, apparently remembering the same incident, turns a delicate shade of puce. He coughs and shifts his weight from foot to foot. ‘That was an honest mistake, Potter.’
He is dressed in indigo, his robes cut severely close to his figure, displaying his height and lean strength, the breadth of his shoulders and the sharp cut of his jaw. A silver starburst rests at the high collar of his robes, shimmering with protective magic. Harry remembers gifting the pendant to Draco last Christmas, wrapping it up in the silent
Harry lifts his chin and catches Draco’s mouth instead, delirious that he can do this now. Draco makes a soft, pleased noise at the back of his throat that is the most beautiful sound Harry’s ever heard. Harry pulls him down onto the bed with a flick of his wrist, flipping them neatly over. He hovers over Draco, forearms braced against the bed above his head.
An unpleasant tingling spreads from the base of Harry’s spine, eating into his stomach. He clenches his fists and unclenches them.
A Tempus tells him has just gone seven-thirty. He gets into the shower and cleans himself up, makes himself presentable, and then Floos to the Granger-Weasley residence.
He lurches out of the memory as a hand tightens on his shoulder. Neville’s anxious face swims into focus, lit by the radiant glow of his wand.
Harry presses his palm against his sternum, where a faded, pink lightning-bolt spreads branches out toward his ribs - the old Killing Curse blow that helped him win the war. ‘I’ll try and be more careful.’
Harry helps Draco outside, sitting him down on a bench. He can’t even begin to imagine what that must feel like - to have your suffering picked apart and displayed like an artefact in a museum. He pulls a thin chocolate bar out of the pocket of his robes and breaks off a small piece, offering it to Draco. It’s a meagre measure of comfort, but it is what he can do here, with all these eyes on them and all those reporters with their cameras and their quills.
‘Thank you for your kind cooperation,’ Smith winks, and then heads out, the flock of Aurors following him.
‘Madame Pomfrey said you dropped by to ask her about alternatives to Dreamless Sleep,’ Neville says. There’s a streak of soil on his nose and he looks so fucking earnest Harry wants to punch him in the face. ‘I’m growing something for you to hang by your bed. It’ll do the trick - I still have mine up by my bed.’
Harry sighs. It’s really hard to explain something this complex to someone who doesn’t have the context. ‘Time is both fixed and ever-changing. It works a bit like the water cycle,’ he offers, gesturing vaguely.
Harry drops by the Burrow for dinner on a weeknight to find Malfoy already there, wedged between Ginny and Ron. At some point in the night, Molly shoves Malfoy into one of her handmade sweaters. It’s cornflower blue, which Harry has to admit suits him ridiculously well, and it makes him look like someone who grew up in a warm, overcrowded house instead of a cold, empty manor.
The Aurors raid Draco’s office on what, by all accounts, should be a happy day. It is a mild, sunny afternoon in late July, and there are roses blooming in Draco’s garden. They confiscate all his expensive, rare ingredients. They tear apart his office, confiscate all his ledgers and books and recipes. They take his cauldron - the one Goldren gave to him, the one made from the shimmering inside of a meteorite.
It’s been kind of a year, huh guys? Please enjoy some escapism with me, stay hydrated, take your meds, call your loved ones and your found family, and remember to be extra kind to yourself. Love you all.
‘He’ll come back to you,’ Luna promises, wiping his face with a handkerchief embroidered with tiny radishes. ‘He always does.’
Ron turns around to look at Harry bemusedly. ‘Didn’t you have a problem last time getting him on the team?’
‘Last time I didn’t have Blaise Zabini in my corner,’ Harry says. He gets up from his table, the motion making him sway somewhat. He needs to eat, or sleep, or perhaps just drink something other than coffee, but first- ‘I have to make a call.’
. He has other dreams too, dreams of things that seem so real that they burn like acid in his lungs when he wakes up and makes him feel even more hollow than usual - but he cannot help but linger on the echoes of these dreams, languishing in
Harry swaps over to typing with one hand, jabbing his finger in what he thinks is the general direction of Neville’s smug mug. ‘Peach fucking Bellinis, Nev.’
Harry wakes with a jolt to find Ron and George looming above him. He rubs the fatigue out of his eyes, still bleary from sleep, and adjusts his glasses. Ron’s hair looks like it’s been attacked by a small cyclone, and George is grinning maniacally.
Harry feels a rush of something rising up within him, something not quite like anger, but deeper than it, darker than it. As dark as a train compartment, as violent as the snap of cartilage breaking, dark as an angry curse scribbled into the margins of an old textbook -
He does remember Astoria, sort of, but she’s a dim smudge in his memory, a flash of dark hair and delicate cheekbones and haunting eyes, a quiet shadow at Luna’s elbow at the Ravenclaw table. He can’t recall seeing her at all in sixth year.
) and normally it should make him irritated or flustered or even a little amused, but right now it is a sick, cold stone sitting in his stomach, because despite everything, after this is done, Draco will go back to Belgium, and Harry will return to Hogwarts and his grindylow-loving students, and somehow Harry had forgotten all of that.
‘I need a cigarette,’ Draco declares. He wraps his fingers around Harry’s wrist, a movement they’ve repeated so often at this point it feels like second nature. ‘Come with me?’
‘As much as I’d love for you to throw me onto the rug and have your wicked way with me, you’re absolutely intoxicated. And you’re heartbroken. And sad and drunk sex is never a good idea.’ He looks up at Harry, his brow wrinkled with concern. ‘I’ve never had drunk sex, but I have had a lot of sad sex. It’s shite.’
Draco makes an ugly, gurgling sound in his throat. Crimson seeps from his lips, stark against the pallor of his skin. He peers up at Harry as though through a thick fog. Harry’s hands are trembling even as he begins to cast. He needs to move faster, to complete the countercurse before it’s too late, before Draco loses too much blood.
‘I never meant to let myself get so close to you,’ Draco says, like it’s a confession, and maybe it is, but the meaning of it keeps slipping through Harry’s fingers. ‘You are a landslide. A veritable annihilation. I put my very best efforts into behaving respectably, and yet when you are in my grasp I lose sight of my intentions and all I have left are my
‘What happened?’ demands Pansy, breathless from chasing him downstairs. ‘What were you doing up there when you zoned out? Potter, what the hell
Blaise’s smile is a lazy, slanting thing. As bedraggled and tired as he is, Blaise still is a little too handsome to look at for very long. ‘It’s no skin off my nose, Potter,’ he shrugs. ‘I don’t think they should exist anyways. They’re too dangerous if used in the wrong hands - and looking at history, all hands can become the wrong hands.’
Ron Transfigures one of the tables into a cot as Harry modifies his Anchors, feeling the sweetwater magic rise up over him, cooling his too-hot blood. As he lies down, he feels sleep drag him under before his head can even hit the pillow.
Hermione tries to get up from her seat but is halted by her husband’s broad hands on her shoulders. ‘Can we do anything?’ she asks anyways. ‘How can we help?’
‘Now this,’ says Draco, twisting his wrist in a movement akin to a conductor’s flourish, ‘is my favourite part.’
Blaise sighs resignedly, seeming to give up on his Saturday lie-in, and drops into a cross-legged position in front of his fireplace. ‘Alright,’ he says. ‘What did you find?’
‘You’re going to regret this,’ Robards tells him with what is probably meant to sound like concern but ends up sounding patronising.
The member of Wizengamot smiles in what he probably thinks is a pleasant manner. ‘How interesting,’ he remarks. ‘Wouldn’t you say Mr. Malfoy demonstrated the same level of barbarity on those victims?’
Harry doesn’t quite have the words yet to explain to Draco what it’s like to be able to sink your fingers into the earth and feel the ley lines hum beneath you, deep and resonant - to know that you can drag that power up and let it pour into you, or to fall into it and let the current carry you away.
‘Someday, Harry,’ Draco says, ‘I will sit you down and tell you my side of the story, and you’ll see how much you’ve done for me.’
‘But,’ Angel continues, holding up a hand, ‘as American wizards operating a business registered under MACUSA, American wizarding laws apply to us.’
‘Well, we’re only patrolling the shopping district,’ Harry says with a shrug. ‘I sincerely doubt we’re going to be seeing much action.’
‘One week after each payment made by Lucius to Selwyn Thestral Stables,’ Draco says, ‘an order of ingredients are imported into England from an East Asian apothecary, delivered to Selwyn Thestral Stables.’ He tucks his wand away into his sleeve. ‘The ingredients seem harmless at first glance, but when all twelve orders are combined, it appears that someone has plans to brew fuel for Chimera’s Flame.’
The young one puffs himself up to his full height and pulls a scroll out of his jacket. They’re all like that in the beginning - arrogant. Self-assured.
He asks Andromeda when he visits. Teddy is old enough to sit up now, and he grabs fistfuls of Harry’s hair and tries to eat Harry’s sweater as Harry tries to focus on their conversation. Andromeda tells Harry that Narcissa’s moved to France and they’ve sold the Manor - apparently Narcissa wants nothing to do with her husband’s name or assets anymore. Malfoy, however, is still under parole, and cannot travel or use magic until his sentence is done.
Harry opens his mouth to protest and Ron throws him a look so thunderous that Harry quickly thinks better of it. He drops into the nearest chair, pulls off his glasses and rubs at the bridge of his nose. His eyes feel red-hot in his sockets, and a nasty migraine is threatening to split his skull open. He’s been exhausted for days but now it’s getting to the point where it feels like his muscles are woven from lead.
Malfoy’s hands still tremble slightly as he works, but he punches the numbers into the cash register with practiced ease. He doesn’t even wince when Harry drops the galleons into his palm, doesn’t fumble once when he hands over the small, hand-labelled bottles.
Somewhere in the endless days of being trapped at the end of Lucius’s wand, his mother had latched onto Harry (or perhaps the idea of him being, once again, symbolic of their deliverance) and used him as a barometer for how fucked up the world was. She is, unsurprisingly, not taking the news of Harry’s arrest well.
‘No, I mean-’ Ron peers closer at the jumble of spells circling the golden orb, long threads of runes weaving in and out of one another. ‘I recognize some of this. Listen, George and I worked on some of this for our Undetectable Box of Delectables.’
Christ. Merlin. He’s a teacher, for fuck’s sake. And he’s got examinations to oversee. He can’t just go traipsing off to Europe on a wild goose chase for a wizard who probably isn’t missing anyways. He’s got
Harry foregoes the delightful-looking baths for the shower cubicles. He keeps his wand in sight, his holster hanging from a peg on the door, because he can still feel the ringing of Lucius’s severing curse in his ears and he can’t help but resort to old habits.
British Aurors too - but he’s still stopped by to see Draco before going home to his family. Harry feels a rush of affection for loyal, lion-hearted Ron.
The back of his nose burned from the emotion that was wracking through his body. He was lucky to have soundproof walls in his room. If he didn't, his father would most likely use the Cruciatus curse on him again for causing a scene. So he used this to advantage. He picked up the nearest item and threw it at the wall. Luckily, it was only a pillow.
He tore the greenish-blue shirt from off his back before leaning back into the pillows with a satisfied sighed. He would have passed out right then had it not been for Draco's sharp curses.
Somehow his father had somehow dragged one of his favorite things down into the pits with him and he didn't even know it existed. Draco could taste the irony bubbling at his lips in a laugh.
"Draco, I get it. You dislike Dumbledore. He's shady, I know. But either way he's going to be the one to help me end this war. I don't really have much of a choice but to trust him."
"Oh hello! I was about to start studying up on my charms theory for next year. It's a little advanced but Flitwick always did tell me I was bright for my age."
"Dudley, please go away," Harry whispered. He didn't have the energy to deal with him. Merlin forbid Petunia come back and see him not at work. He just needed to get back to Malfoy.
Draco tilted back his chair a little and his head fell back in a short laugh. "Probably. Those idiots don't even know how to cast a simple locking charm."
There's a silence Harry can't decipher. Harry stares transfixed at his hands as if they're the most interesting thing he'd ever seen. Suddenly there was an arm around his shoulders that pulled him close, gently rubbing his arm.
Yatin only hummed. "No, not yet. Maybe in the future though. I heard it can be sold in some countries for quite a catch. Of course I couldn't be caught dead doing the dirty work. I'll be willing to hire you of course. If you desired."
He sighed, regretting allowing Malfoy to share a room with him. The blonde git would probably murder him in his sleep and wouldn't even have a wand to defend himself with. If anything, that was probably exactly why he was here in the first place.
"I don't know." Draco hissed. Blaise helped him back in his chair gently. The three scanned the room for suspects. No one had seemed to notice Draco's slip-up being too absorbed in their work.
Malfoy huffed. "For your information, I was thinking about how to fix our situation. Now, if you would stop being such a
"You ready?" Draco whispered to the smaller boy beside him. Harry was looking down at his feet with his jaw clenched and hands shaking mildly as they gripped the edge of his shirt. He was obviously nervous about returning to that ghastly place so soon. Draco couldn't blame him, he felt the same way about returning to the Manor. His stomach dropped at just the thought.
to see him even if it was childish. What he told Draco was right, Dumbledore was the only way he was going to have the slightest chance of filling the prophecy, but he had planted a seed of doubt in his head that maybe that wasn't so true after all. Besides, the headmaster had a habit of finding out things Harry didn't want him to know. He looked up to him and didn't want to be seen as a disappointment in those eyes yet he couldn't stop it if he didn't stop poking his nose where it shouldn't be. He also would want to send him back to the Dursleys next year where he'll no doubt be killed. He had every right to be terrified of being back in his office. He stomped his floor on the ground in frustration.
"I'm getting there. Now, blood magic is vastly different from normal wand casting and highly advanced. The night at Godric's Hollow your mother did not cast any wards herself and instead, her magic made it's last imprint on you which fulfilled an ancient ritual."
He was hesitant to tell Draco this information. Draco guessed he felt odd about sharing such personal information to a person he would be normally glaring daggers at. He couldn't blame him.
"I didn't go through all this trouble to get you out of that house for you to wallop in your pain. What hurts?"
to make sure he was punished because of it. That's where he and his father separated. He would do anything to avoid getting what he deserved like the coward he was, or because he simply thought he did not deserve it (which made his stomach turn). It was kind of a fucked up way to look at it, but the logicality of it was clearer than anything else lately.
Remus nodded and busied himself in the small kitchen that connected to the sitting room. Harry watched awkwardly and sat down on one of the patched armchairs right to the fireplace. It was odd. He never had imagined in the days contemplating whether or not he should come what Remus' home looked like. He just assumed the man still lived in Grimmland place, though now that he thought about it, it was quite a stupid idea. The place had to hold more bad memories for him than it did Harry.
and it clicked to Harry. Ron and Hermione increasingly broke out into conspiracies about what had happened to Katie and if Draco was involved. He wondered if he should mention it to the blonde.
Malfoy looked over at him. "What's so amusing, Potter?" He sneered but it only made Harry want to laugh more. How had he never made this connection before!
Ron scratched the back of his neck. "I thought you were sneaking out to meet someone. I figured you probably wanted privacy about something like that. But yesterday I saw something on Ginny's neck, and earlier today..."
Draco looked up from his book and threw back the rest of his hot chocolate. (He was addicted. Harry tried to voice these thoughts but only was glared at and told to pour another glass). He looked just as exhausted as Harry felt.
Harry thinks back to all the times Remus had stopped everything at the hint of Sirius' name in his third year. The way Sirius sat so close to him during Order meetings and the looks they shared when they thought no one was looking. Merlin, how could he have been so
Remus urges, making him wince. He was once again unwillingly reminded that telling would have been what Sirius would have wanted. Harry takes in a long breath before sighing deeply and closing his eyes. There truly was no way out of this.
He was used to being in this position of helplessness, but that didn't mean he was any less numb to the frustration that piled up within him. He shot a glare behind him to see who had shot the tripping hex. The trio had stopped near the opposite end of the hall, Weasley with his wand out and Hermione looking at him with a mix of shock and dismay. He knew it wasn't for his own sake. Behind them was Harry, his focus centered on Draco laying on the floor. He didn't move to help him. Draco didn't expect him to. It was obvious the brunet was torn.
Harry was staring up at it nervously. He was cradling his right arm as if old memories were resurfacing. Draco went to place his hand on the boy's shoulder to get his attention but stopped himself. Maybe that wasn't the best option right now.
Harry looked down. He was still mad but he begrudgingly had to accept the fact Draco was actually right in this scenario.
There was also the issue of the curse. It had spread up to his sternum a couple days ago after Hermione had wrongfully thought she had finally found a counter-curse. Harry doesn't think he had ever thrown up so much afterward, not even when his uncle had forced him to eat year -expired soup.
He's pulled into a bone crushing hug once again. The back of his eyes burned slightly in response and he squeezed them shut. It was kind of awkward considering the height difference and Harry's sore stomach but he didn't dare speak that.
Harry huffed but otherwise stayed silent as Draco took the rope from his hands. He analyzed how far it was up. He didn't have much arm strength himself but if he stood from the top of the stepstool he just might be able to make it.
Remus shakes his head. "It's my fault. I shouldn't have told you. Sirius didn't want to tell you cause he feared how you would react. He knew the muggles you grew up with weren't likely to be particularly fond of that kind of thing and he didn't know whether you took on the same ideas or not."
Draco rolled his eyes and looked at the wall but opted to stay silent. Two weeks' detention was already bad enough. He doubted he would be able to see Harry at all with everything he would drown in.
She is here. The chapter you've all been waiting for. It has only been 120k words and forty-three chapters! But it's here! I apologies :) Just kidding, no I don't, but you can imagine I do. I should say I wasn't going to have them kiss this chapter, but the next on Christmas Eve night by the lake. But I have no impulse control whatsoever and figured this was probably cuter SO-
Sorry folks. I can't tell if I made them both a little too OOC in this... but it would make sense for Harry to tell Draco what bravery is and Draco himself finally have his Breakdown™ after all this time. Also, shorter chapter but it's been only three days since the last update so.
Draco stiffens. He clearly didn't want to think about it. "Obviously not. We both knew what would happen eventually, yes? Then I have no reason to be upset. And I am not."
Draco flinches slightly and pulls the blanket tighter around his shoulders. He could practically feel the dark ink on his forearm moving with a mind of its own. Merlin, he was disgusting.
Draco closes his book then gets up off of his seat to put it back on the bookshelf. It was ten in the morning and the two still had half a pile of books to comb through about wizarding traditions and permanent dark magic curses.
He looks around the room, just now realizing how clean it was compared to its usual state. "Did you clean all of this?"
Severus waves his wand to vanish the bottle. With another wave of his wand the cure is disillusioned, something he idiotically never thought of before. "That is none of your business and I advise you to stay out of it if you knew what was best for you."
hand, touches his wrist and Harry flinches back wildly. He doesn't remember how but his body was suddenly bunched up tightly and his arms wrapped around his head. Flashes came to him - Remus' shocked expression, a bottle being pushed to his lips, whispered assurances - but they hardly register.
For the first time in the past couple of days, Draco is at peace. There's no buzzing where there usually would be stress eating him alive. No one was right next to him glorifying murder or spitting insults right into his ear. Everything had just turned off for a little bit and it was nice.
Kinda boring chapter again sorry lads. Have some self-destructive Draco Malfoy as a filter because how else do I cope other than project myself on my favorite characters?? His thought process is probably confusing af for other people but it’s exactly how I think so??? Next chapter is when things start picking up again.
"Can I get ten chocolate frogs, a bulk of sugar quills, a couple licorice wands, five packs of Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, and a stack of acid pops? Oh, and as Caramel Cobwebs as you can shove in the bag."
Draco rolls his eyes before entering fully and shutting the door behind him. His glamour from the platform had run off now and his hair was once back to being slicked down. Harry guessed he probably stole some hair gel from one of the other Slytherin's. Harry had surprisingly almost gotten used to it being loose and oddly found himself missing it.
He grabbed the soap and furiously started scrubbing his body until his skin felt rubbed raw. He knew he was free of them, for now at least, but that didn’t stop him from wanting to remove every trace they ever existed from his skin. Sadly, a bar of soap wasn’t going to be able to do everything. Too many bruises and scars littered his small-ish frame for it to ever return back to normal.
The brunet curled himself up in a ball under the thick green comforter with a contented sigh. The morning light from the open window shone through the curtains followed by the sounds of birds singing and kids laughing.
"Are you sure? Mum had the idea that we should let you be and take your own time. I thought it was rubbish of course. I think you've had more than enough happen for someone to acknowledge what you've been through."
"I didn't know, Draco. Maybe ask the mark on my stomach. It's didn't exactly to fall in your arms like a fucking damseal in distress.
Harry shrugs and pushes himself back up into a sitting position. "I don't know- it's just a nagging feeling I have I guess. You're not like your father is what I'm trying to get out."
Harry looked down at his feet and hands, not leaving but contemplating something. Draco's fingers twitched in annoyance and humiliation.
Harry opens the candy box with a raised eyebrow. The figure jumps out and almost lands on the blonde's face had he not leaped for it first. "You've been acting like a kicked puppy all week."
Book forgotten, he pushed his face in his hands to hide his increasingly blotching face. He just wanted to crawl in a hole and die from embarrassment and shame. He also just wanted to scream until his throat went raw. He hated himself so much. He shouldn't be here. He shouldn't be alive. He should be someplace suffering for everything he's done. He deserved so much more pain; he should be welcoming everything happening to him. Yet some greedy part of him just wished for it all to go away and become the same ignorant twelve-year old he once was. If only he could just smother it to death.
Harry nervously let out a low laugh. "No way. You should know that. She's like a sister. She's your sister. That's... No. No way. Besides, if Ginny heard you just now she would probably be sneezing bats for a week."
He stands up as fast as he can, chair falling behind him, and makes for the door. He slams it shut with as much force as he can manage before practically running down the steps. It was pathetic and he knew that, but didn't stop the urgency to get as far away from Potter as humanly possible.
The clattering of a saucer being sat down in front of him startled him out of his thoughts. Remus was sitting on the chair across from him and was saying something.
"So you're in the black and white and your father isn't? You have to be on something, Malfoy." He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath with a slightly pained expression. "We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are. And I think you can change."
Snape lets out a growl of frustration. "Do you have any idea of a mess you have caused? Selfish boy. Did you think of the consequences? You've done nothing but delay the inevitable. He will get what he wants and you will suffer for it along with will the hundreds of others because of
Draco's head whips around fast. There's a mix of pain and anger in his fiery, narrowed eyes. "Yeah I noticed asshole. You don't have to remind me."
Draco goes toward to door once again but Harry blocks it with his body. "You can't." Potter spits out quickly. "Not right now at least..."
Draco doesn't correct him on how wrong the statement was. There was no point. He would only hear what he wanted to hear, just like his father. He knew fair well what a life was worth to the person he had been forced allegiance to. The memory of tortured screams from the cellar as he ate his dinner still haunted his dreams.
he care so much? He was putting himself at risk just by being here. He could have just left as soon as he got Potter to safely yet he hadn't. If he was being honest with himself, he could have even alerted the Deatheaters to Potter's location if he wanted too. His father would even be proud of him for once.
Beside him, Pansy made a face of pure disbelief. "You? He accepted you? You're- well you. What the hell do you have to offer? You're a half-blood! You're not even of age!" She whispered yelled. Her fists were clenched at her sides. "What do you have-"
Against his will, he turned and leaned his head on Remus to catch his breath as he was the closest source of heat. It was returned with a tight hug and a tissue which he accepted graciously. Harry knew he would faint when his stomach gave out. It felt like his innards were being replaced by some kind of black hole. And yet, it was still oddly unnerving when the nausea crept from his abdomen to his head causing the world to go black.
"No thank you." He laid his head on the counter and rubbed his temples before pausing. "Actually- do you have hot chocolate?"
Harry had talked under his breath so no one would question their conversation. Draco shifted uncomfortably on their bench, crossing his arms over his chest. Harry noted he still had his sleeves pulled down despite the heat. Again, Ron and Hermione's suspicion snuck its way into his brain.
Harry wanted to feel mad at the boy but he couldn't stop himself from smiling at how much the blond prat looked like a pouting six-year-old who just got told off for being up past their bedtime.
Draco pushed past someone roughly on his way out the door. Only when he looked back halfway down the hall did he realize it was Ginny Weasley. Harry was with her, smiling as if she said a joke. The cherry on top of the cake was when the girl laid a hand on his arm. If Draco's face could have hardened any more, it was definitely in that moment.
want to earn a place in this delicate new world that is growing out of the rubble - this place where a boy with a love for flowers might find a small corner and grow.
‘The year is 1997,’ continues Draco. ‘The Ministry belongs to Voldemort. Lucius Malfoy makes an enormous payment to Selwyn Thestral Stables. Snatchers suddenly have money for food, clothing, buildings, potions. There is plenty of reward money available. But, strangely enough, at the war trials, nobody can seem to figure out who funded their activities.’
‘I work at a bookstore on days I’m not at Goldren’s,’ Malfoy replies. ‘And sometimes I pick up hours bartending. It pays the rent. Keeps me fed. And I don’t have to deal with, you know, the general aversion and disgust people have towards me.’ He gestures at his forearm, where the Mark is hidden under his clothes. ‘As far as the Muggles are concerned, this is just a tacky tattoo.’
Draco is still generous with his affections, but they are a quieter sort - a hand on Harry’s lower back, guiding him through the flower market, a meaningful smile shot over Teddy’s head as they walk through the Muggle museums, a brush of the hand when Draco hands Harry his tea, Draco’s fingers lacing through Harry’s as they watch the telly when the weather’s too poor to venture outdoors.
As they come to shackle his wrists and take him away, Lucius looks up into the stalls and meets Harry’s eye. A leisurely smile sprawls over his face.
Harry lies down the rug in front of his fireplace, and he stares at his ceiling and wonders how he can feel so fucking tired. He closes his eyes, hoping that sleep comes, even though it never does, but in the darkness he sees the faces of all those he’s loved so fiercely, all those kind and good and brave people who’ve left him behind.
‘It will be extremely hard to bring those charges,’ Blaise warns her. ‘The Wizengamot cares more about the nature of spells cast than what happens at the receiving end - look at our laws, Mrs. Granger-Weasley. They do not prioritize what is easily fixed with magic.’
Neville shakes his head, releasing his grip on Harry’s shoulder. ‘It just seems horrible, Harry. It’s awful that this is who you had to be - that is the life they forced upon you
Daphne sighs and waves him off with a curt flick of her wrist. She doesn’t quite move in the same languorous motions as Pansy or Blaise - she’s brutal, precise, and a little more than a little frightening. Harry finds her instantly likeable.
That night, Harry can’t sleep. He wanders into Draco’s room to find him still up, reading in bed with only the bedside lamp on.
Pansy’s eyes flash in recognition, and she grins slowly. ‘That sly bastard,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘That was Blaise, Potter. As in, Blaise Zabini, procurer of the fancy champagne we always have for Draco’s birthday.’
Harry pushes himself up out of his chair and crosses the study. Kingsley walks around the broad girth of his desk and comes to stand facing Harry, placing his considerable bulk in front of Proudfoot’s frozen figure. He presses the tip of his wand against Harry’s neck, over the tattoo that marks him as a prisoner of Azkaban. A sensation like trickling icewater spreads through Harry’s skin, leaving behind gooseflesh.
They both turn, then, just in time to see Draco walking down from the tent, the twinkling lights of the party turning his white-blond hair silver. He’s got a bottle of champagne tucked under his arm and his waistcoat is unbuttoned and there is pink in his cheeks.
He doesn’t really agree with Daphne. He doesn’t deserve more than this. He wants to end in the ashes of the Manor. He wants to let himself be swept away and locked in a cell and forgotten about.
‘We must ask that you cooperate,’ Smythe attempts, his voice sounding somewhat wobblier than before.
Harry hums in agreement. ‘Right, thank you very much,’ he says. ‘That was actually really quite helpful.’ He presses a kiss onto her powdered cheek. ‘
‘You like Pansy,’ Harry reminds him. He decides not to mention the other couple now entangled in a passionate embrace beneath the lemon tree, lest Ron have a complete meltdown.
‘He and Astoria should be here in the next few minutes,’ Blaise tells them both, his gaze lingering on Draco for a breath longer than it should. ‘Pansy owled to ask if she should take a portkey from Paris, but I’ve put her on Narcissa watch. Hope that’s alright with you.’
Ron shrugs. ‘That’s more Hermione’s area,’ he replies. ‘To be honest, I can’t wait to go home and sleep for three days straight. I’m knackered. I don’t know how you’re still upright.’
When Draco passes out one day at work, he comes to with Mr. Blake crouched over him, attempting to call the ambulance on a mobile phone that he definitely does not know how to operate. Draco manages to convince him not to call emergency services after all, explaining that this happens all the time, that it’s the same problem he has with his hands shaking all the time.
‘It’s just,’ Harry sighs, rubbing the back of his neck tiredly, ‘things were just so shit for him in England. And I was so wrapped up in my own issues that I never really noticed - or rather, I didn’t do anything about it even if I
Pansy grins wolfishly and flips him off. Her nails are painted midnight blue and filed to a threatening point. ‘Next question,’ she drawls. ‘Have you been consuming any substances - coffee? Alcohol? Dreamless sleep? Oh, I can answer that - coffee
‘Aliens are climbing out of a little girl’s mouth, or something,’ Potter says, and then winces. ‘Actually, I’m not even sure what the plot is anymore.’
‘Babe, your plant-based food is amazing,’ Ginny says, giving Neville’s arm a mollifying pat. ‘It’s Soho that I don’t trust. Harry, we’re doing Taco Tuesday, if you want to stay for dinner?’
They both chuckle a little. It’s weird how they’ve spent so many years as friends and still only ever called each other by their last names. It feels like the end of an era, in many ways. The world pivots onward.
‘I don’t know about that,’ Hermione frowns. She pockets Harry’s letter and folds her arms over her chest. ‘He hasn’t been returning my letters. Normally he’s really good about writing back.’
He buries his head in his hands and the world comes crashing down, it all comes crashing down on him, because they were supposed to have more time, they were supposed to have the rest of their lives, and now-
‘At any rate,’ Blaise continues, ‘my sources say that Lucius took the modified Time-Turner with him to Brussels. My best guess is he’s kidnapped Draco in an attempt to drag him into the fold, same as before. I don’t know why though - Draco’s made it abundantly clear that he wants nothing to do with Lucius or his fanatic tendencies.’
Harry pulls away slightly, just so he can lift his hands from Draco’s ribcage to brace the base of his skull, so Harry can track his thumbs over the rise of Draco’s cheekbones, to feel the warmth of his skin and to know that he is alive.
‘Circe, Potter, don’t pass out on me,’ Prentis frowns, leaning over to peer into his face. ‘I’ve got some Pepper-Up left if you want any.’
,’ Harry says heatedly. ‘It’s not something edgy that should be celebrated - it’s a fucking blight on Draco’s life and it causes him actual pain every single day and I swear to Merlin’s fucking eyeballs if I see a single kid out there with a skull-and-snake tattoo I will hit Skeeter over the head with an anvil.’
‘Obnoxious little cunts, aren’t they?’ Pansy says with brittle, forced cheer. ‘They told me I couldn’t complain because you were locked in that room for much longer than a measly twelve hours. They told me, you know,’ she says with a sharp laugh. ‘How long you were in there for. They were even so kind as to tell me the exact number of times I was in the same room as you.’
Harry swore he wasn’t going to cry at his own sodding wedding, but now Hermione is handing him a tissue and Ron is thumping his back and saying,
Malfoy arches an eyebrow, managing to come off cool and aristocratic despite resembling a very well-dressed Inferi. ‘Yes, quite.’ He turns towards Hermione. ‘Granger,’ he says stiffly. ‘Would you mind if we had a word? In private,’ he adds, ‘if you’re amenable.’
Malfoy seems less than pleased at being ordered around, but he takes a dainty little bite of chocolate. There is an absurdity to all of it that makes Harry want to laugh. Instead, he sits down next to Malfoy, holding both their wands in his left hand. Something feels like it’s shifting under his feet, like the whole world is tilting in a different direction, and he doesn’t know what to do with the enormity of it all.
‘Yes,’ Harry says slowly. ‘Are you alright, Pansy?’ he asks. They were clearly arguing about something important before he walked in.
Narcissa blinks, and nods slowly. ‘Well, Mr. Potter,’ she says, her voice soft and light. ‘You may as well come in. It’s a nice day for entertaining guests.’
Harry drums his fingers against the tops of his knuckles. His mouth is a sandpaper-dry, and he’s not entirely sure how he should respond to Proudfoot - or if he could find the mental energy to deliver it.
He shakes his head once, then twice, and then looks at Harry pleadingly. ‘Merlin’s beard,’ he utters. ‘Potter, I - I am truly sorry. I had no idea.’
The scar runs from Draco’s collarbone down to his hip. Harry reaches out and splays his fingers over Draco’s heart, relishing the feel of its steady, strong beat. The curse missed it by an inch. Lucius did not mean for Draco to survive.
Neville steps away from the table and peels off his gloves, tucking them into the back pocket of his trousers. ‘Yeah, go on then,’ he says, nodding. He squints at the dark sky. ‘We should be heading in too. Looks like it’s going to get nasty in a bit.’
The fireplace lights up with a sudden flare of Floo-green, and Hermione steps through with a giant hamper of food, her hair twisted up in a loose bun, curls falling down around her face.
‘Welcome to Lopez & Lopez,’ the man with the braids says in a velvety-smooth American accent, flashing Harry a pearly smile. ‘I’m Guy and this is my brother Angel.’
. In a different world, Harry follows that rising darkness and does something irredeemable, something unforgivable.
Draco thinks of a conversation he once had with his aunt - a sad, honest conversation, about the other love of Remus’s life, the beautiful boy with a dangerous smile. He was the only other person in their family who managed to break free of the dark, insidious web of the Black influence. His absence is a yawning cavern in Andromeda’s heart, even if his loss meant Tonks and Remus could find each other (because love is not a finite resource, and Tonks also knew how to love Remus as he deserved to be loved, and knew how to heal the ragged wounds torn into the both of them by an unkind world). Andromeda showed him the letters she and her cousin exchanged, when the world had not yet tasted the bitter devastation of Voldemort’s first war.
And suddenly it is done, and they are pressed together on the ballroom floor and there are people clapping, and the music is changing now, into something slow -
Malfoy stares up at Harry. His eyes are so pale they might as well be transparent. He says nothing as he pulls his wand from Harry’s fingers. Somehow, his silence proves more unnerving than his usual biting remarks.
Ron pats him on the back with an audible thump. He has large hands to match his ridiculous height. ‘Catch some shut-eye, mate,’ he advises, standing up. ‘Or one of the frightening women in your life will make you.’
Harry presses his thumb and forefinger on Malfoy’s pulse, and then begins waving his wand in the first of many complex motions. Colours dance over the other man’s body in ribbons of light. Vivid green curls around his wrists and shoulders, and a necklace of scarlet winds around his neck. Bright crimson slashes over Malfoy’s forearm, where the ugly bruise of the Dark Mark sits beneath his sweater.
There are dams built around each person’s magical core. It takes a lot of time and effort to learn how to siphon off a witch or wizard’s power into a spell - usually through gestures with a conduit, such as a wand, and a few syllables. That is why wordless and wandless spells are so difficult. But Harry… Harry’s
Two Aurors step forward, reaching out to separate Harry from Draco’s grasp. Harry shakes his head at Draco silently as he tries to resist.
‘Oh, not at all,’ she says, shaking her head. ‘Regulus Black was a Death Eater, and it is how he is remembered to this day.’
I'm thinking we'll probably get to read Draco's lovely letter to Harry in the interlude. (she says, as though she's formulated any sort of plan for the structure)
‘He knew,’ Draco said aloud. He opens his eyes and uncrosses his arms, leaning instead on the dining table as the others turn to look at him. ‘Harry knew this was going to happen.’
It would have certainly been a difficult task for eighteen-year-old Harry to learn the motions of the spell, but he’s been doing complex spellwork for nearly two decades. He memorized the lock-picking spell in the space of one evening - tracing the motions of the spell with his fork through dinner, familiarizing the muscles in his arm and chest with the precise pulses of magic that course from magical core out to his fingertips.
From across the table, George winks at Harry and flashes him a thumbs-up. ‘You heard her, Harry,’ he grins. ‘No winter weddings.’
the way magic-wielders of the West do, and while do not they care much for the rules of aristocracy and lineage that Wizarding Britain is so obsessed with, they still own the entire import industry for potions ingredients. One word from Stephen, and the Lius could put the economy of Wizarding Britain in a chokehold.
‘I’ve got some funds to invest,’ she tells him excitedly, swapping his wine with her flask of vodka. ‘Let’s draw something up.’
Draco lets out a scoff. He gestures at the silvery scar peeking out from beneath the collar of his shirt, and then at the open ledger.
Blaise waves his wand at his face, dropping the cosmetic charms and revealing his handsome features. ‘Didn’t mean to insult, Professor,’ he grins, flashing very white teeth. He jerks his head towards the door. ‘
(It is, in fact, impossible to forget Harry Potter. Draco has wonderful, devastating dreams where he stands in the Astronomy Tower and has his wand ripped away by a boy with an angry mouth and lightning-green eyes, a boy who pushes him up against cold walls and tells him to
Harry whistles through his teeth. He hasn’t really considered that option yet. ‘I don’t know, mate,’ he says. ‘It’s not an easy commute, is it?’
‘We’re very happy to see you,’ Draco says, laughter colouring his voice. ‘Are you going to be staying at Grimmauld Place for the summer or with Andromeda?’
‘Hey,’ says Neville in protest, grabbing his wife’s arm. ‘Plant-based diets are an extremely important component to building a sustainable future.’
‘I was jealous of you, you know,’ Harry confesses. ‘I had it in my head that you’re… that this is what the Chosen One is supposed to look like. Not like me. Not…’ he trails off and waves his hand over the general vicinity of his chest.
Harry raises an eyebrow sardonically at his friend. ‘You’re taking the piss,’ he says. ‘I look like an under-budget uni student.’
‘It’s okay,’ he lies. ‘It’s going to be okay.’ And then, with all the truth in his heart: ‘I love you. I always will. I always have.’
Harry wants a lot of things. But he’s not had a great track record at getting any of the things he wants, and standing here in Draco’s kitchen, he thinks he has more than he deserves. So, he holds his love in his chest and smiles wordlessly at Draco. He doesn’t need a forever, when they have a
Harry scrunches up his face as he searches for the best way to explain. He knows, from working on this case together, that Blaise’s expertise in time magic is limited at best - his education has largely been on the magic that comes from witches and wizards. If Harry succumbs to the temptation to slip into technical jargon, Blaise will be as hopelessly lost as he would be in the Forbidden Forest on a moonless night.
She’s gotten a lot more cool-headed since the war ended. Harry thought the same would happen to him, but he feels like a bomb ready to go off at any moment, full to the brim with sharp, hot rage. The one thing that got him through the worst of it was the promise of peace. But the wizarding world seems to enjoy lingering in the shit and quagmire of the war, dragging on the war trials in a disgustingly public spectacle, throwing overpriced memorial balls and shallow benefits. Meanwhile, nothing is being done about the wandless families, the injured, or the decimated homes. Hogwarts is still in ruins - no reconstruction can be carried out until the Ministry issues the appropriate approvals, but of course they’re too preoccupied with prosecuting anyone remotely related to a Death Eater.
Harry laughs quietly and looks up at the sky. He thinks he might split open from the beautiful agony of it all. ‘Sure,’ he says. ‘Every Christmas. Forever.’
‘Your hair,’ Neville replies. He spoons a helping of roast potatoes into Harry’s plate. ‘I managed fine with the bonsai.’
They join the others in the dining room. Luna makes tea and miraculously produces ginger biscuits and Biscoff cookies. Hermione stares listlessly into her tea, dipping her biscuit into it until it breaks apart and floats in scattered clumps.
Harry wants to laugh. There is no extent that the DMLE would not go to, if it meant acquiring a new weapon - especially one as powerful as the Elder Wand itself.
Draco’s fingers trace slow circles over Harry’s Anchors, then trail down to his wrists, to his hands, where he interlaces their fingers and holds tight.
He wishes he had one of his father’s cursed Time-Turners. He wants to spin its chambers between his fingers and watch time retreat to their moment on the balcony, when everything was wonderful, and the world had not yet ended.
Harry watches Lucius’s face as shock and fear morphs into wild, desperate rage. He sees it before it happens,
Blaise pours the wine into crystal glasses. ‘This is really quite a lovely year,’ he announces, turning the bottle over so that Narcissa can read the label. ‘Though it was an absolute disaster getting these grapes harvested that year - Paul insists on never using any magical creatures to work on his farm. I’m not sure if that’s bigoted or not, but well, it reduces the process to something almost Muggle. Do you want to hear about it, darling? It’s hilarious.’
The night sky shifts from dark cobalt to midnight blue. Someone charms Draco’s wireless to play music for dancing, and Harry extends the tiling of the back porch out into the garden, so nobody trips on a stray root or tumbles into a molehill. Andromeda and Narcissa do a very impressive polka for two elderly witches cavorting around a garden.
‘Aw, thanks mate,’ Harry says sarcastically. He sits back down in his chair. ‘Hadn’t noticed ‘til you pointed it out. Cheers.’
‘Whatever,’ she says, rolling her eyes. She points at the phone in Harry’s palm. ‘On the wotsit. Tell Draco there’s plenty of food left for him if he wants to escape the Slytherins or Soho.’
‘Right, I’ve got bad news,’ Hermione announces, shoving the hamper at Harry. ‘I dropped by the Burrow to pick up food from Molly and ran into Percy and - oh,’ she says, cutting herself off. Her eyes widen as she takes in the other visitor. ‘Blaise Zabini, right? Slytherin? Are you visiting Draco?’
He shakes his head. ‘I came to see how you were doing.’ He glances through the open archway towards the empty dining room. ‘Where are Ron and the children?’
They do the dishes together afterwards, like they always do, standing side by side at the sink. Artemis winds himself around Draco’s bare ankles, attempting to purr and meow at the same time. Draco’s laughter is as light as eider-down, and he leans into Harry’s space as he places a dish on the drying rack. He smells like mint, lemon and cedarwood. Like books and wool and fresh laundry.
I ended up breaking this chapter in two. It became a bit of a behemoth and it was too much of a roller coaster to keep in one chapter. It’s going to be a real good chapter next, you’re going to have so much fun (she shouts into the quiet auditorium with only three people in the audience).
Malfoy sips his tea, his eyes dancing with wicked amusement. ‘You’ll have to figure that one out by yourself,’ he tells Harry. ‘Or suffer in your delightful ignorance. Either way, do let me know which you’ve decided on.’
Harry’s partner leans back in her chair, a fat case file balanced on her knees as she props her feet up on her desk. One of her feet is wrapped in a cast to keep its shape steady while the bones grow back. She was hit with a particularly nasty marrow-eating curse a few days back, and Harry ended up removing all the bones in her leg in a desperate attempt to stop the curse from spreading.
, and Draco changed, and that’s the whole fucking reason Harry fell so hard in the first place, because when someone who cuts like a knife learns to be kitten-soft it hits hard like a freight train.
‘Bloody hell, Daphne,’ Harry chuckles. ‘You know I hate it when you manipulate me into feeling positive about life.’
- who was constantly vying to get Harry in trouble. He knows the angry, dangerous boy from sixth year. And he knows the fear-wild creature from the War.
The wards chime, ringing out an inappropriately cheerful tune, and there comes a knocking on the door. Ron squeezes his wife’s shoulder once and heads off to answer the door.
‘I know,’ Harry says. ‘I know- it’s just.’ He swallows thickly around the jagged stone lodged in his throat. ‘I can’t lose him. I never even- I can’t.’
Ron drops by in the afternoon, looking extremely rumpled and stinking of Portkey magic. He and George have been through two full days of debriefing by the Unspeakables, and the Belgian, French
Harry presses the palms of his hands against his forehead and tilts his head back towards the sky, fastening his gaze upon the moon and all the stars beyond. He fills his lungs with clear, cold air, and thinks of the strange poetry of all the things that tie him and Draco together - the grandeur of the stars, the rituals of Christmas and birthdays, the absurdity of confectionery. The years of fighting and squabbling and death and torture and delicate, wonderful hope.
‘I just… okay, fine, maybe I do, but what else am I supposed to do?’ he sighs. He turns Draco’s palm over and traces the callouses and burns left from long hours of potion-making. ‘I’m hardly a genius like you or Hermione. And I’m not very creative, like Ron and George are. I’m not good with plants or animals. I’m just good at fighting.’
‘Harry!’ shouts George, suddenly materialising above them. ‘Seamus has set himself on fire, we need your help with- oh, shit, sorry lads.’ His eyes are wide as he takes in their tangled bodies, Draco’s rumpled shirt, Harry's swollen mouth and the hand still cupped at the back of Harry’s neck.
In books and films and songs they have wonderful, romantic ways to say it, but Harry’s never been good with words, so he takes another breath and says, ‘I love you.’
, Harry’s heart leaned towards Draco like a sunflower following the sun’s path through the sky. He knows that now.
‘Yeah, and I felt that,’ Harry replies. ‘But you’re… your magic is soothing. You’re like a meditation melody or something,’
The hand on Harry’s waist is an anchor - a firm presence that pushes and pulls and guides him through the swift rhythm of the song. Harry is aware of the trip of their feet over the floor, aware of the giddiness of the ceiling as it whirls above them, aware of each sweep of the music as it rises and rises - and yet, at the same time, he is elsewhere, flying through autumn-chilled air, far above the Quidditch stands, above everything and everyone, tilting his broom in preparation for the nosedive after the glittering wings of the Snitch. Draco lifts their clasped hands and turns him, spinning him out and then drawing him back in, never once falling out of beat. Together they perform a different type of magic, one where Harry
Draco knows that Harry is a dangerous, powerful man, with many powerful, intimidating friends. He knows that Albus Dumbledore made Harry that way - moulded him and manipulated him into just the right circumstances, rewarding him when he made the correct connections, gently nudging him away from any less-than-favourable ones.
Draco nods. He ducks his head under Harry’s chin, his fingers curling between their bodies as Harry pulls him in close. He smells of soft mornings and Harry’s favourite coffee, this precious thing between them that is too new, too fragile.
He holds the warrant up for inspection. ‘We need to speak with Mr. Potter,’ the young Auror announces. His voice is deafening in the terse silence, and even Singh winces.
‘Oh, whoops,’ says Teddy. ‘Sorry. I’ll leave you to it.’ He steps back out of the bedroom, shutting the door with a firm
‘I sincerely hope not,’ Draco says into Harry’s collar. ‘I danced with Longbottom’s grandmother. It was a waltz. I was very sloppy. Mother would have been appalled. Potter, you won’t tell her, will you?’
. Luna thinks things are better in the open, but she doesn’t know what it’s like to be desperate enough to butcher your heart to keep a friendship alive.
Harry drops into one of the seats facing the brothers. ‘I suppose you could start with explaining to me what Lopez & Lopez does,’ he says, pulling off his sunglasses and tucking them in his shirt pocket.
‘Yes, it’s very much the rage,’ Narcissa replies, brightening visibly. ‘Draco bought me a lovely set by a Muggle lady - Austen, I think.’
From beyond the island that separates the dining room from the kitchen, Daphne makes a soft sound of agreement.
There is a noise in the hallway beyond the kitchen - a scuffling of slippered feet against the rug - and Teddy wanders into the light. His hair is rumpled, dyed an odd shade of purple, and there are pillow-creases on his face. He looks so young, so lost and confused that it makes Draco’s heart ache like an old injury.
that Harry makes as Artemis’s considerable weight hits him in the chest. He sits up in bed, suddenly and hideously aware of his bedraggled appearance and the swollen shape of his eyes.
‘I honestly don’t think so,’ Neville replies. He pulls his legs back up, planting his feet firmly on the ground so that he can lean his elbows on his knees. ‘Dangerous creatures are just a part of the wizarding world. You can’t wrap children up in a safety net and hope that they’ll figure it out when they graduate. Besides,’ he adds, ‘we went through far worse when we were their age.’
They honeymoon in Nimes. They eat honey-soaked cheese on the balcony of their hotel room and drink pastis in the late afternoon as the dry heat of the day is at its most brutal point. They go to vineyards and markets and hike through ancient olive gardens and follow the lines of old aqueducts from town to town. Harry learns to kayak, and Draco gets horribly sunburnt and Harry rubs soothing salve onto his reddened shoulders in the safety of their room.
- and he haggles shamelessly over the price of antiques at the flea market every week. He was so quiet in England, so subdued, so
people’s awful, vindictive birds. He gives her three jellied mice as a reward, and then allows her to groom his mane of messy hair. He feels a strange twist in his gut as he watches her fly off into the night, and wonders if it’s in anticipation or dread.
Another member of the Wizengamot rises out of his seat, slamming his hand down on the railing. ‘We cannot consider justice a crime,’ he thunders. ‘Draco Malfoy deserves what was done to him.’
They wander along the border between solid ground and murky water for a while, just beyond the sweep of light spilling from the Burrow, shoes sinking into the damp soil. Music warbles from an open window. A cool breeze whispers through the rushes, kissing at Harry’s temples.
It isn’t the done thing for anyone aged under fifty, but the old-medicine taste of pastis has sort of grown on Harry.
‘Yeah, she was off. If I didn’t know better I’d say it was some kind of mind-altering curse - not Imperius, because we’ve got a track on those now.’ He shakes his head. ‘But there’s just so much background noise in that apartment. I can’t pick it out.’
Harry grins broadly. ‘I’ll bring the wireless in here so you can listen to your programs while I cook, yeah?’
Harry wishes he was a little less sober. He’s standing in line to get into a Muggle nightclub with a pack of pureblood Slytherins, who are wearing Muggle clothes and talking excitedly about Muggle things, and it’s just so fucking
‘Pest control,’ replies Harry gleefully. ‘And Neville’s the same with his plants as Hagrid is with his animals.’
Malfoy glances at the fence, at the glowing red handprints on the metal that are only just starting to cool. He looks up again at Harry, his expression unreadable, before he waves his wand at the fence, erasing the handprints entirely. He vaults gracefully over the fence and into the field on the other side - more gracefully than Harry’s ever seen him do anything - and takes a few steps into the field before sitting down in the tall grass. After a moment, Harry climbs over the fence and sits with him.
Draco feels a smile pull reluctantly at his lips. He glances towards the dining room, where Luna has managed to coax Hermione into a chair. He can hear the boiling of the kettle and the soft clinking of cups being set on the table.
The window is slightly ajar, allowing a soft breeze to sneak in through the curtains. Tufts of cream-white clouds dust over the cornflower sky. There is a bird singing in the garden, and the sound of the city is a whisper beyond the walls and wards of Grimmauld Place. The air smells faintly of Draco’s citrusy shampoo and summer flowers, and wet grass. The cruel chill of Azkaban seems nothing but a distant dream.
- he can find the magical signatures hiding in this room, no matter how faint. And if he can find Lucius’s magical signature, he can find the general location of the Panic Room.
Draco’s thumb is a butterfly’s kiss on Harry’s cheek. He presses his lips to Harry’s forehead, feather-light and silk-soft, and asks for a forever-everything-happy-ending.
Harry reaches for the rage that’s been feeding him all these months, that monster created from grief and loss and pain, but it’s gone. Fizzled out.
Harry’s hand is hot like an iron brand when it touches Draco’s cheek. He guides Draco’s chin upwards until their gazes finally meet. His eyes are the same devastating green as that fateful day in the dungeons.
She was one of the first to receive a letter. It arrived with a bouquet of white orchids and a box of Turkish delight - which Luna adores. They’ve been writing to each other almost every day, and Luna usually offers to visit Malfoy’s apartment to clear it of Nargles. Malfoy always declines, though.
‘We just need to know if you know where he’s gone,’ Proudfoot interrupts, drawing Harry’s attention back towards him. He looks apologetic, which Harry supposes counts for something.
‘He has to take me to dinner first!’ shouts Charlie from the bar, and Blaise trips over his own feet, careening into a nearby waiter and getting red wine all over his expensive suit.
He spends most of his time in the Muggle world. He talks to his friends (the few that remain in this country, who have not fled their persecution following the trials). He picks up bartending. He goes for coffee with Luna and visits museums with her, and even when she tries to persuade him otherwise, he keeps his distance.
After the War, Harry went to Andromeda to tell her what had happened to Regulus. It hurt him to have to hurt her, but she deserved the truth - just as Regulus deserved someone other than Kreacher to mourn him. He deserved to be more than a name on a tapestry, more than a school picture of a solemn-faced boy posing with his broom in his Quidditch leathers. When he told her about the cave, the potion, the Inferi - she buried her head in her hands and wept.
It is nearly two in the morning when Harry pushes his work away to roll the tension out of his back. His limbs feel leaden and his face feels slightly numb - all signs that he’s pushed his body too far with too little sleep. He leans back in the kitchen stool and closes his eyes, listening to the gentle hum of domestic spells rolling away in the different points of his house.
‘If you’re making an attempt to shake your moniker, Boy-Who-Lived, you’re doing a terrible job at it,’ he grins. ‘Valiant effort though.’
Harry thinks that maybe they’re still dancing, spinning out over the ballroom floor. He should say something - but he is too breathless to speak, too giddy to find the right words. Instead he leans forward and presses his lips to Draco’s. The garden in his chest is aflame with golden marigolds of happiness.
‘I need a better angle,’ Ginny tells Harry gleefully. ‘I’m going to play this for George in the pensieve when I get home.’ She detaches herself from Harry with a peck on his cheek, claps Malfoy on the back, and heads over to stand beside Ron.
They have a bit of a family discussion about it after dinner, which quickly evolves into the Black family inquisition against helpless Potter. Draco’s been pushing for this since, well, forever, and Teddy’s delighted at the idea of having his extremely famous, ex-Auror godfather around all the time to impress his friends.
Harry perches on the edge of her desk and flicks her brand-new shinbone. ‘Don’t be a smarmy git,’ he says.
‘That’s very likely,’ Draco says, looping his arm through Harry’s. ‘But at least I got you out of the house. And you look fit.’
Harry leans forward against the tiles and tries to remember how not to collapse beneath the weight of it all, but the world is a heavy, awful place and he is buried beneath the shock and the grief and the long, abysmal years of his life that will yawn before him if he is without Draco’s light.
alcohol. But no Dreamless Sleep - otherwise you wouldn’t look so shit.’ She flashes him a cheeky wink.
She tosses a hand skyward. ‘Honestly? I don’t know. It was so fucking unsettling.’ She peers into her empty glass and frowns. ‘I’m going to make some more. D’you want any?’
But Harry is so fucking happy anyways. He spends every minute so happy he doesn’t know where to put it all, so one evening he drinks a whole bottle of wine and cries into Draco’s shoulder because he’s just so overwhelmed with how he’s allowed to be happy now.
‘You know what I have to say about the matter,’ Draco hums. He tucks a loose strand of hair behind Harry’s ear, his fingertips brushing over the delicate spot there. ‘But you’re as stubborn as they come, and I’m not equipped to deal with that nasty saviour complex good old Albus instilled in you.’
(Harry, a broken doll stitched together with gauze and thread, unable to breathe without assistance, and then, later, attending funeral after funeral on crutches, so many friends gone in a splintering second.)
Andromeda’s lips thin out into a hard line. ‘No,’ she says. ‘I am going to tell you about my cousin. You might not have heard of him,’ she says, casting her gaze over the other members of the Wizengamot. ‘His name was Regulus Black. He was one of the people who helped kill Voldemort.’
People stop Draco in the street to fawn over him, press letters and gifts into his hands, tears streaming down their faces -
‘Yeah, I said the same to him,’ Ron nods. ‘It might’ve been a while since I was on the force, but I still know Ministry procedure. He can’t talk to you unless an Unspeakable gives him clearance, which I told him, except then he was stupid enough to put his foot in it and file his application with Blaise.’
George hurries over to them, grinning broadly. ‘I’ve got it!’ he announces. ‘We’ve been coming at all wrong.’ He waves his copy of the manual at them both. ‘You don’t
Harry loves him and hates him in equal measure. Nobody should be so unbearably annoying and charming at the same time. He sighs and gathers himself.
Harry moves onto the bedroom. Draco’s suitcase is still on top of his wardrobe, and his clothes are all hanging neatly inside. A dog-eared book is perched on the bedside table, a ribboned bookmark peeping out from its pages. A peep in the en-suite confirms that Draco’s toothbrush is still there, along with his home-made, incredibly fancy hair potions.
He finds it almost instantly. It’s in the same place, hidden in the walls behind the settee. It feels weaker than before. Bile rises in Harry’s mouth, but he bites down any kind of reaction.
Harry feels a sudden stab of guilt, and an old, grey tinge of loss for the closeness they once had. He misses her - not as a lover, but the person who would giggle and joke and lounge around together on late Sundays, arguing about Quidditch while the dishes do themselves.
didn’t you?’ she accuses, pointing at his chest. Her voice rises in cadence, growing shrill and shaky. ‘Oh, fuck.
‘Honestly, his attention was absolutely focused on this Time-Turner,’ Draco sighs. ‘But maybe you’ll pick something up in the pensieve that I missed.’
Things are a little different after the trial - or rather, after the trial is published in all the papers.
all the patterns. Otherwise it’s kind of like sitting on a bus and only being allowed to get off on a predetermined station.’
Draco’s smile slips off his face, but he steps towards Harry, and in his face, Harry can see all his love, as vast and inconceivable as the number of stars that glitter in the sky. ‘I want forever,’ he whispers.
‘Did Draco tell you where he was going on Friday?’ Harry asks, hoping to distract the middle-aged witch from her tirade.
Harry wants to touch him so badly the force of his desire makes his palms burn.  ‘Do you need any help with dinner?’ he asks.
But Potter is a storm breaking in the sky above him, the mud and rock and silt sliding from the mountain and rolling into the river, and he can’t help but let himself be swept away.
The door squeaks softly as Harry steps into the bedroom. Artemis makes a soft, purring meow, and he takes a running jump off the bed into Harry’s arms. Draco can hear the soft
‘Yeah, sure,’ he says. He pulls out his mobile phone from his back pocket and types in the passcode to unlock it. ‘I’ll shoot Draco a text, let him know I’ll be late.’
It’s stupid. It’s impossible. He doesn’t even know if the Order will give Malfoy sanctuary - not with the Dark Mark twisting on his forearm, not with the people he’s tortured, possibly killed. He doesn’t know if they’ll even make it off the grounds of Malfoy Manor. But he’s so fucking tired of being the Boy Who Watches People Die.
Blaise sends over the Department’s files on Lucius’s involvement with the Time Turner in a shrunken filing cabinet, delivered by one extremely irritated eagle-owl that looks to be Blaise’s personal bird rather than a Ministry-allocated one. Harry has to appease her with jellied mice ordered up from reception before she’s willing to stop pecking at his fingers.
Far above him he can glimpse a narrow tunnel of light, a patch of blue sky. But it is distant - torturously unreachable.
Draco turns Harry’s hand, palm-up, and buries his face in it. Harry feels the cup of his hand grow damp and his chest aches with a deep, throbbing pain that has nothing to do with his ruined organs or his broken ribs. It’s not a confession, not quite, but it’s the only thing he knows how to say, the only thing that feels true enough to be permitted to see the light of day.
‘Everyone has reasons, Harry,’ Draco says. ‘Let me put it this way. If it meant saving the world, would you take Teddy away from Aunt Andromeda? Would you give him to the Lestranges? Or maybe a Malfoy?’
‘You look remarkably sober, Potter,’ he declares. He sounds posher than usual, which is a good indication as any that he’s three sips away from being face-down-in-a-ditch drunk. ‘I insist you get horrendously inebriated, this instant.’
A relieved smile flashes over Draco’s face - a devastating flash of teeth and the corners of his eyes crinkling just enough to make Harry’s heart flutter - before he schools his expression into a calm mask. He stands to his full height, brushing his hands down the front of his immaculate robes. This is neither the vibrant, jubilant creature that Harry knew in Belgium, nor the soft, midnight secret who lived within Harry’s bedroom walls, nor is it the cruel-faced boy with a mouthful of razor-sharp slurs and insults. This version of Draco is new to Harry - and yet there’s just
‘Myself included,’ Marsters nods. ‘We were responsible for tracking down the ministry officials who were working for Voldemort during the war. Since we’d already worked Lucius’s case, Kingsley assigned us to investigate the people he had dealings with. Lucius had his claws in many, many important people.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘I’m at the week’s limit for potions,’ he replies. ‘The sugar should help me. I think.’
Blaise doesn’t come back for the rest of the night. They have no idea where he’s gone until Draco returns from the restroom with a look of horrified disgust, from which Pansy deducts - correctly - that Blaise is fucking said twink-bartender in a bathroom stall. Loudly.
,’ Harry says exasperatedly. He’s running on empty at this point and he hasn’t got time for this. They used to have this argument all the time.
The door swings open with a near-inaudible creak. Harry scrambles off Draco quickly, but not quickly enough, apparently, because Teddy is standing in the doorway, his eyes nearly ready to pop out of his head as he stares at them.
Potter finishes his ice cream and continues ranting, waving his spoon emphatically. Draco is a little out of his depth - Potter’s knowledge of defensive spells is somewhat beyond the scope of Draco’s apprenticeship and Hogwarts education - but he tries to keep up as best as he can. He retrieves Potter’s cup, fills it with more tea, and drops another scoop of vanilla ice cream in it. He should know better than to enable the Auror’s insatiable addiction to sweets, but he is a weak, weak man.
I hope you all enjoyed this chapter and are having fun with me so far. Sometimes I feel like relationships arrive at times when we aren't ready for them, and really that's what this fic is all about.
. All I want is to do the same.’ His touch drifts over the interlocking spheres inked onto Harrys’ skin. ‘If this is what you want from me, it is yours. Anything you want from me is yours.’
‘Ooh, fancy,’ Neville whistles, admiring Harry’s wandwork. ‘You took a shortcut there somewhere. Should I expect Aurors showing up and poking at my plants again?’
He drops by the bookstore that Draco works at, on rainy weekends after his shift when all the lights have come on in the street and the store is empty but for a few stragglers. He leans against a bookshelf, reading a paperback edition of
‘Yes,’ Harry frowns. ‘To share with Teddy. Don’t change the topic. Why didn’t you just tell me what it meant?’
Harry finds himself wandering into their restaurant, mostly out of habit, and orders his usual from a young waiter he doesn’t recognize. It’s really been years since he’s been to Paris, and though the bones of the city haven’t changed much, everything else has. He sits at the small circular table, watching the pedestrians hurry home as he feels a hollow in his heart that grows and grows and grows because he knows that he can only linger in memories for so long before he finds himself courting ghosts, and he promised Draco he would stop doing that.
Draco hums in agreement, patting Harry’s shoulder. ‘I suppose we were going to have to talk to him eventually about this,’ he reasons, sounding not even half as panicked as Harry is feeling right now. ‘No time like the present.’
Draco’s living-dining space is cosy and warm, with the sofa tucked away just to the side of the dining table. With a good charm it can stretch to seat six, but tonight the wooden table is set for two. Rugs sprawl out over the carpeted floor, and an array of portraits and photographs hang from the wall. On the furthest side of the room, sliding glass doors open out onto the back garden, where Draco has his herb garden.
‘Lucius is taking a plea,’ she says. ‘He’s taking house arrest in exchange for the names of everyone involved in the neo-Death Eater scheme. He won’t be going to Azkaban.’
, Professor?’ she purrs, dropping to her knees next to the fireplace. ‘I was just about to close up for the evening. How can I be of help?’
It’s not really allowed, but the nurses and the Healers can’t seem to find the heart to separate the blond man with the chest wound and his dark-haired hero (the one that even the youngest apprentice recognises, the one whose face used to be in all the papers, the one that they’ve stitched together more times than any single person should have to be).
There are other spheres floating above them - all prior failed attempts at recreating the Lopez Panic Room - close to the high, arched ceiling of the laboratory. Harry’s hotel room became too cramped for three people to work comfortably in, so Blaise arranged this place for them through the Ministry. The laboratory is on the top floor of an old villa belonging to one of the professors who teaches part-time at Beauxbatons. The house is just outside the city - in what Harry would probably call a quaint country town - and just far away from other wizarding houses that Harry doesn’t have to deal with the white-noise-feedback of background spells.
The theme park scene is a bit jumpy, ugh, I’m sorry. (Are Teddy and Victoire an item? Or is it just disaster bi solidarity? WHO KNOWS. Harry definitely doesn’t.)
Instead, on an insignificant November night, Ginny hugs Harry, tells him she’s really sorry, but that it’s over between them, and Floos to the Burrow.
Harry saw a portrait malfunction once, when he was still an Auror. It had been hit by a stray curse, and instead of reacting to the person standing directly in front of it, the wizard in the portrait kept repeating a number of answers to a person who was no longer there - as though he was trapped in a series of motions. In the end Harry had sent the thing off to a Cursebreaker for processing, but the damage was permanent. Harry never found out what happened to the portrait after that.
Harry’s had his Anchors modified to their lowest setting for three days now. Daphne is vehemently against it, but he’s desperate not to count corpses again - he’ll do anything, absolutely anything to prevent another attack, even if it means burning himself out.
He tries to run - even towards the roaring, unnatural flames now eating up the street, but the ground opens up like a mouth beneath Harry, cobblestones dropping away into the vast emptiness. His foot hits thin air and he plummets down, down, down. The last thing Harry sees as he falls into the pit is the world toppling inwards like a house of cards, buildings shaking loose of their structures and tumbling after him with all their stone and brick and splintered wood, and beyond that, green fire eats the stars.
Daphne migrates around the dining room table and gently guides the youngest Weasley sibling into one of the seats at the table. ‘Cream?’ she asks. ‘Sugar?’
At the reception, Molly gets horrendously drunk, so Arthur ends up dancing with Professor Sprout, who’s nearly as drunk as Molly but better at remaining vertical throughout. Teddy and Victoire both take turns dancing with Rose, because she’s absolutely determined to make this
. There are pieces missing from the puzzle - chunks of information that have been redacted or else not included. The documents keep referring to the records of the trial -
Blaise drops his hand from the fireplace and rubs his hand over his face tiredly. ‘Right,’ he announces. ‘I am in sore need of coffee. Would either of you like any?’
Draco bites down on his lip to keep from bursting into peals of laughter. The bartender gives him a confused look as he sets down Harry’s drink at his elbow and takes away the empty glass. It’s a mild reaction, compared to what they’ve gotten in the Leaky Cauldron. Harry and Draco have a habit of going to Muggle establishments these days, just to avoid the crowds and flashing cameras. Harry’s still a good sport about the whole Chosen-One, star Auror fame, but it can get a bit grating when people keep demanding to know why he’s hanging around with
Draco seems about ready to chastise Teddy for calling himself a burden (they agreed a long time ago never to use that word with Teddy, not after the cupboard under the stairs and bars on windows, not when they both love him so much) when Healer Thompson walks in.
Warnings: description of prison confinement, abuse and use of restraints. To avoid the Azkaban scene, skip ahead to ‘Take this abomination off him…’.
Behind him, the Floo flares to life. He turns in time to see Luna and Daphne step up from the fireplace.
It is sweltering hot and the sky is determinedly cloudless. Ron forces them all to line up so he can slather them in sunscreen while lecturing them on the dangers of melanoma. He blackmails Draco into agreeing to hydrate every two hours -
Pansy looks the way she always does - fishnets and stilettos and vampy makeup - and there’s some safety in that, but she’s giggling and leaning heavily on Blaise Zabini. He’s dressed in a black turtleneck that makes the cut of his jaw more devastating than usual, and there are diamond studs in his ears. Blaise is so handsome that it’s a little uncomfortable to witness. Theodore Nott stands just behind the other two, smoking a stolen cigarette. His hair is very intentionally windswept, the collar of his extortionately expensive shirt rumpled and unbuttoned. They look like spoiled, rich kids - but in a Muggle way, and it’s
Hermione bursts into loud, ugly sobs, and Ron hugs him so hard his rib cage nearly breaks a second time. Draco watches silently from his seat, but then he smiles at Harry, all tender and sweet, and Harry knows he’s made the right decision for once.
Above, Hermione screams, and both Harry and Malfoy grip each other tightly. The War is a gargantuan, bloated creature that hovers above them, and they are small, helpless, and afraid. Harry knows he is meant to be noble. He is the Chosen One. But his best friend is being tortured, and he doesn’t even have his wand.
But then he thinks of Malfoy’s hands shaking as he presses his own wand to his neck. Malfoy’s lopsided smile in the flat light of Costa’s, Malfoy laughing, pink-cheeked in the snow, Malfoy stacking books, hair curling from the heat of the tiny store. And then he thinks of Malfoy smiling gently down at Teddy, slumbering with his head buried in Malfoy’s shirt.
Ginny extracts herself from her husband’s grasp. She throws Harry a mock salute. ‘Hiya, Harry. Still here?’
‘What are you really doing in Paris, Potter?’ Pansy asks, when they’ve finally managed to escape Narcissa’s apartment.
Draco drops his gaze to the glossy surface of the table. His lips pull outwards into a bland smile. ‘You underestimate my father, Harry. In the end, Lucius always gets what he wants, regardless of what he has to do to achieve it.’
In the kitchen, there is water in the kettle, and the tin of earl grey is half-empty. The cupboards are still full of food. A bouquet of dried lavender and feather grass leans in a tall, green bottle on the dining table, and a stack of letters are placed neatly at its side.
‘I’ll head there after this, actually,’ Teddy tells them both. ‘I owe Gran a visit. Gran’s been complaining that I’m shit at letter-writing, and to be fair, I am shit at letter-writing. Oh, and I reckon I’ll pick up a part-time job while I’m here as well. I don’t want to be a burden on any of you.’
A bulb goes off from the stalls as a reporter snaps the scene. The room is silent but for the swift scribbling of quills against parchment.
He clenches his fingers and feels the Wispa packet still locked in the vice of his hand. He hears Draco’s voice in his ear, soft and sweet, like a trickle of springwater falling down through the rubble.
Draco’s mother has settled down in Paris - it reminds her of happier times, apparently - but Draco prefers Brussels. The Statute is interpreted a little differently in Belgium than it is in France. It’s a small country, and many of its cities were built long before the Statute of Secrecy came into inception. Buildings are made of stones that are magical and mundane, and the Muggle laws strictly prohibit any alteration, so the wizarding world sits right on top of the Muggle world - sometimes literally.
‘It really isn’t, Potter,’ Pansy says, sounding choked. When he looks back up at her, he can see that her eyes are bright with tears. ‘You don’t get it, do you? Of course you don’t - you’ve always been the most oblivious of the lot.
‘Take a look at that and tell me if you see a troubling pattern,’ he says, jerking his chin towards the table. He takes a step back with his arms folded over his chest, allowing for Stephen to scan the figures properly.
What a long-ass chapter, oh my god. Between the length of this thing and work/life growing steadily more chaotic, I barely have enough time to sit down and write anything. Bear with me pls thank you ily.
Rose pats her mother’s hand and says, rather dryly, ‘Mum, it’s okay, Hugo learned his first bad word when he was five from Dad.’
Draco tilts his head the way he always does when he’s trying to figure Harry out. ‘Well done on following DMLE protocol?’ he guesses.
Harry turns his head, burying his face in Draco’s hair. It smells like mass-produced hair potions (something that Draco would
‘When he finally saw how they had poisoned him,’ Andromeda continues, her voice ragged with old grief, ‘he had already devoted himself to a cause from which there is no escape. So, he did what he could. He stole a Horcrux from Voldemort, and it cost him his life.’
They do Christmas at Andromeda’s. Harry thinks it’s best that he gives Ginny her space, even though Ron keeps insisting that it’s fine,
Narcissa nods, looking down at her cup. She lifts it again, and then sets it down on the tabletop, saucer still balanced in her left hand. ‘I love him so much, you know,’ she says. She lifts her gaze and stares at Harry, her forehead creasing deeply as she leans forward in her seat. ‘Mr. Potter. You must know. I love him more than anything.’
idea.’ He pats Harry’s upper arm fondly. ‘I adore you, but you have the observation skills of a rock.’
Malfoy presses his fist against Harry’s chest. ‘You’ve got to stop this,’ he hisses. He pulls out his wand and presses it to his own neck. ‘I’ll make it look like you attacked me. Overpowered me.’ Malfoy takes a deep, shaky breath. ‘You can still make it out of here alive.’
Harry reaches out and pulls Pansy into a tight hug. Her shoulders are so much smaller than they look, but that’s because she always stands taller than she really is. Pansy is a paper mache monster easily crumpled in the rain, but she bites as hard as she can so you never know how much she cares. Harry feels a surge of gratitude for this prickly, aggressive witch and the depths of her love for her friends.
There’s a summer storm sliding in from the East. Harry watches the dark clouds cover the late afternoon sun, dragging shadows over the shining city. The air is laced with petrichor. A memory comes to him, unbidden, and he recalls a flash of cold hands and breathless laughter and standing pressed up against Draco beneath a copse of trees as sheets of icy rain come crashing down. Harry presses his fingertips against the corners of his eyes and takes in a deep breath.
Ginny whacks him with the bristly end of her broom, which, in Harry’s opinion, is a damn waste of perfectly good equipment. But, well. When you’re sponsored by the top broom-makers in the continent, you could probably spare to waste one or two expensive brooms on pummelling your ex-boyfriend on your back porch.
Blaise blinks slowly and scribbles something in his notebook. ‘That was probably the best course of action,’ he says, his gaze dropping to the sprawling marks of his handwriting. He lifts his eyes to meet Draco’s. ‘But do you think that you could have done what he asked? Could you have modified the Time-Turner to turn back decades?’
actually work in your favour. In the meantime, though,’ he adds, tilting his head slightly, ‘you just get really good at writing letters. Though as far as I can tell, you two have that down to an art form, so you really shouldn’t be worried.’
Draco is the first person Harry sees when he wakes up, after the Diagon Incident. He doesn’t say something funny, or make fun of Harry’s full-body cast, or even insult his hair. He just looks at Harry with swollen, reddened eyes, and lets out a little sob. That’s when Harry knows it’s enough.
‘You’ve saved mine hundreds of times,’ Draco replies. He shifts further down the bed and lies down next to Harry. The light dips him in purest gold, lavishing its gifts on him with a love that feels as reckless as the love that burns in Harry’s chest. ‘Maybe more, I don’t know,’ Draco says. ‘I’ve stopped counting.’
Draco’s lips quirk upwards. ‘Let’s not resort to violence, Harry,’ he says, his voice light with amusement. ‘I do appreciate the sentiment, though.’
‘Well,’ says Draco, trying very hard not to think about the inherent eroticism of being hit on the leg with a
Harry is helpless as warmth pools in his chest. Even now, even after what happened, Draco is tender, and Harry simply does not know how to bear it.
Harry stares at the half-eaten Wispa in his hand as though it might give him some sort of revelation. He can feel his brain struggling against the heavy weight of fatigue. His face feels mildly fuzzy. His fingertips have a tingling in them that makes Harry worry he’s given himself temporary nerve damage from overwork. He wants nothing more than to crawl into bed and pass out - but he’s got three hours left on duty, and they’re nowhere closer to catching the orphanage bombers than they were last month. Or the month before.
, Harry thinks viciously. The whole wizarding world is disappointed in the Chosen One’s wasted potential.
The lawyer nods in quiet confirmation. The movement startles his milk snake from its slumber, and the creature winds its way down from Acquafredda’s collar and into his shirt pocket.
It’s arduous work, looking through the files. It reminds Harry of those long, dreary days on desk duty before he got assigned Prentis and was transferred back into the field. Blaise’s notes are well recorded, at least, and more thorough than anything he’s seen come across his desk during his days as an Auror. But these are Unspeakable files, so they focus more on the technical aspects - the particular spells used, the technical work, the ingredients and components that failed to stabilize. The neglected mug of tea grows cold at his elbow until he has to Vanish its contents and brew himself a new mug, only to forget its existence as the hum of work drags him under once more.
Neville presses a palm over his heart and shakes his head despairingly. ‘You’re a cruel man, Harry.’
He is here to help, not hinder, so Draco swallows his burgeoning grief and steps aside as Luna hurries over to Hermione.
He’s placed the oak leaf in a glass panel and framed it, hung it on the wall above his bed, and he’s got Draco’s picture on his desk, and some of his clothes still smell like the detergent Draco likes to use - but Ghent feels a million miles away.
‘You suffered a lifetime of hero worship,’ he says. ‘It ruined your childhood. I can understand why watching the same thing happen to me would make you uncomfortable. To be honest,’ he adds, smiling crookedly, ‘it makes me extremely uncomfortable too. Pedestals are dangerous things to fall from.’
She sits with Harry for a while, holds his hand even when he’s unresponsive to her gentle nudges towards conversation. She doesn’t say a word when he finally breaks down crying, long hours of frustration and fear pouring out of him in soundless, heart-wrenching sobs. Her arms have always seemed small and delicate, but they hold him fast as she hugs him tightly through it, until he is done and empty and left with nothing but the gaping hole in his chest and the deep pit of his exhaustion.
Harry opens his eyes slowly and turns to face the source of Draco’s magical signature. There is nothing there but a wall - a wall that’s always been there, behind the sofa in Narcissa’s living room, no different from any others. Nothing to indicate the presence of an enormous, fortified room hiding behind it.
She stands, leaving Harry with only a view of her ankles as she walks briskly to her desk. He hears a cupboard slide open and click shut, and then Michelle’s feet make a return to the fireplace. She kneels down, places a card between the tongs, and tucks it expertly behind Harry’s ear.
Harry turns back to the windows. He waves his wand, racing through the long list of spells to protect the glass from the worst parts of the storm. The charms protecting the Herbology greenhouses are old and frayed. He’s been meaning to replace them for a while now, but in between grading and helping with quidditch practice, he never really got round to it.
Harry and Draco take up a place by the entryway, close enough to their friends but far enough to let the families have the front row. The bride and groom make their way onto the floor for the first dance, and a hushed awe falls over the crowd.
Draco couldn’t come. One of his patients came down with a bad case of Spattergroit. As an apology he’s sent a case of champagne that has erupts with tiny shooting stars when it’s poured. Harry feels his absence like the crushing heat of a dead sun, but it’s a good day, and after everyone’s left, he goes upstairs to his bedroom and Floo-calls Draco.
‘I suppose there’s nothing quite like the thrill of being able to sexualise something taboo,’ Luna remarks thoughtfully, ‘morally illiterate as that might be.’
‘I’m fairly sure I do,’ Harry groans, shifting his hips so that Draco can feel just how much he wants.
Harry reaches out between them and takes her hand. The ring on her finger sparkles as it reflects the brilliant moonlight. She squeezes his hand in response, and then releases it from her grasp.
‘He’s got a life sentence,’ Harry says gravely. ‘Lucius Malfoy will die in Azkaban, just as he deserves.’
Harry recalls liking Neville, once. In the early days, before Ron quit the Aurors, they used to meet at the pub every weekend to catch up. But that was before Harry ended up tunnelled under work and whittled away into a walking shell of a person. He knows Ginny’s been dating Neville for years now, and it shouldn’t matter, not really, because Harry is irrevocably in love with Draco - only it does, somehow, because Neville’s life resembles that childish, stupid everything-forever-happy-ending, and Harry has nothing but a broken heart and an eternity of sleepless nights and a faltering
‘Per-fect,’ the Healer says again, giving the chart one last tap. She pulls a small token out of her pocket, squints at it, and the line between her brows deepens. ‘Right, I’ll leave you boys to it. Do let us know if there’s anything else we can get you to make you more comfortable, Mr. Malfoy,’ she adds, flashing a warm smile at Draco.
The room beyond it is small and unassuming. There is a waiting area consisting of a leather sofa and a coffee table covered in generic-looking magazines, and beyond that a large wooden desk, behind which sit two identical-looking young men. The man on the right has his hair twisted back into neat braids, while the other wears his curls cropped close to his skull, his face partially obscured by a well-maintained beard. They both look up at the same time as Harry closes the door behind him.
Harry cannot move, cannot even take a single breath without the restraints digging into his ribs. It is ugly. Claustrophobic.
"The other wizards at the inn I mean." Harry lies quickly, hoping he doesn't pick up on the lie with his wolf instincts. Remus gave him a look that lasted a beat too long in his opinion before looking back over his shoulder where now crowds of last minute students were climbing aboard. The Hogwart Express horn went off twice telling others to hurry up.
Draco pulled up the door from the ground and headed down the twisted stairs that were in a perfect spiral like a child's slinky toy pulled from each end. They went straight to the bottom of the tower, nearly ten flights of stairs standing alone without any other rooms. He mumbled something unintelligible under his breath before hiking the bad up his shoulder and continuing down.
Remus looked as if he would rather be anywhere else than where he was. Harry knew the man wasn't one to confront hard subjects as he learned from third year. "He was very special to me." He finally says, cutting into the thick silence. "I cared for him."
I think I'm going to continue most of this story from Draco's third-person limited P.O.V guys. I find it much more intriguing to write in. Also, pleaseee spam me with comments. They make my day :)
Draco wasn't as blind as he was making himself out to be. Potter's torso was incredibly thin and his clothes were absolutely dreadful. Holes and dirt covered the rags and not to mention they were nearly seven sizes too big on him. He had already commented on the bruises on his face but it was clear he didn't want to talk about it.
Harry whipped around to see the professor walking down the empty corridor scoring bright green robes. The feast had just ended he supposed. He had left early due to his stomach still in the process of stretching itself back to size after the summer. He had eaten more than he should have under Hermione's watchful eye and ended up being sick.
He looked up without moving his head to glance up at Draco. He'd be lying if he said he didn't expect Draco to start breaking down. Last night he looked so incredibly fragile, almost as if you could bown a leaf at him and he'll shatter. It was eye-opening, really. This was a whole new side of Draco that Harry didn't think anyone had ever seen before. He felt honored but also great a responsibility not to break it.
I think I'm going to continue most of this story from Draco's third-person limited P.O.V guys. I find it much more intriguing to write in. Also, pleaseee spam me with comments. They make my day :)
Sighing, Harry bends over to dig in the bag filled with acid-pops and Draco smacks his hand away. "Back off before I take your voice away for good. Those have to last me until the first Hogsmede trip."
Vincent took his chance to shake his wand violently and tossing Draco around like a game of hacky sack, a few times which made Draco exceedingly close to banging his head back on the floor. He could have guessed they were trying to knock him out.
Merry Christmas babes! If you celebrate, that is. And if this is posted then,,, I have very bad impulse control. Anyways, what's the tea? Two cliffhangers? Merlin, I really am a garbage fire of a human being.
Gregory, the smarter of the two, elbows his partner in the ribs. He shoots the wand in Draco's hand a glare before looking up and into Draco's teasing eyes.
Draco looks up at the large builds of Vincent and Gregory. They both had the stupid grins on they still hadn't grown out of that showed they were up to something. An ugly sneer that disfigured their already disfigured faces and a taunting raise of eyebrows that showed more confidence in their magic than near-squibs should. He almost made a smartass remark about it before remembering that harming him with magic probably wasn't the intent.
His knowing he deserved it was the only barrier between the two and it was thin. He didn't know if that scared or relieved him.
Yatin shrugged tauntingly and went back to his work. "I suppose your mummies hadn't thought you important enough to tell you yet. I'm sure he'll have room for you somewhere if you beg. I heard the official boot-polisher job is up for grabs."
The next wave of nausea that hit him was so intense that they hardly made it to the toilet bowl before Harry emptied his stomach. Porcelain clashed with olive green which only made more vomit stream from his mouth. Vomiting was already a nasty thought but actually seeing it only made it worse. It burst from his throat, practically choking him.
Draco's digging through his school bag for something so he has to look up to see what he's talking about. "Research."
Harry's mind automatically flew to Draco. They had snuck out a few more times since the night at the lake and he was finding himself to become increasingly addicted to the blonde's presence. He was smart, witty, and surprisingly mischievous after Harry had finally cracked his goody-two-shoes shell. Their midnight visits had quickly had become a highlight of his er- well, night.
Draco tilted his head upwards, the way he did when he wanted to sound more confident about something. "Perfectly."
"Mr. Potter! What were you thinking! A dark curse and you never once sought to tell anyone? You're lucky if I ever let you leave this room again-"
"Holy Merlin," Blaise replied, "you're even worse at comebacks that Draco is. Just get on with it, please. I have places to be."
"You're early," a voice sweeps in from behind him. His coughing had covered up the sound of approaching footsteps.
Finally, Harry's head pops out with a small grin. He was holding a rope and a small step stool in either hand.  He briefly handed them to Draco as he relocked the shed to erase any evidence they were there.
Blaise snorts next to him. "Your only future prospects are a couple self-pleasuring spells that will remain unnamed for the sake of Draco's innocent ears."
"Did you see who it was? The portkey you sent with the death eaters had us worried. The order has Lucius Malfoy and Antonin Dolohov captured. If it was one of them we might be able to question them before sending them off to the ministry."
Expecting a blow to the face and actually receiving one were two different things he's learned through the years. Especially with Dudley.
He stands up angrily and stomps his way over to Harry. One large hand grabs his arm and the other pins him against the wall.
Harry glares at him and makes a gesture suggesting a very violent action if he didn't give it back within the next half-second.
anything! He was still mad at Ron for hexing him out of nowhere, not that he could express it without both his friends thinking he was possessed.
Draco reluctantly held out his arm for the older man to take. He has to look away as his sleeve is pushed up so the man can apply the paste. The only ever time he looks at it is the darkness of the night when the self-loathing kicks in.
"Did you not hear what I said?" Draco seethes. "This is my goddamn house. Leave me alone. I don't need
Harry fell silent. He hadn't thought of that. The thought of never doing magic again was almost as terrifying as being with the Dursley's until he could move out. He would have to watch from afar as Ron and Hermione studied for their N.E.W.T.'s and graduate without him. Voldermort would find him one day and he'll be left defenseless to die at the same hand who killed his parents. Or he could live in hiding the rest of his life. No one would ever know where he was. He'll be safe and so would everyone he loved. Either way he'll be in exile the rest of his life. Could he ever handle that?
Draco's gut plummeted as soon as he got back to his room. He knew it was to happen eventually, but not so soon. Couldn't they have at least waited until he was out of school? Or when he was an adult even? He gripped his blonde hair and let out a choked sob. He wouldn't-, No he couldn't do this. It was crazy. He was only sixteen for Merlin's sake.
Harry pulls his arm away. "No, I don't think I will. You don't get to start fights and not finish them. "He pushed the boy's shoulders back for emphasis. "You don't get to decide that.”
"Aw, who are you gonna go to Malfoy! Daddy? You gonna go tell your daddy on us? You can't, can you? He's in a little bit of a problem now, isn't he?"
The blonde was still surprised by how much their behaviors had changed around each other so quickly in a span of twenty-four hours. One thing he learned after all these years was that your behavior was fluent on who you were with. With father, he was so uptight, focused on being the perfect son. Pansy and Blaise, although they were different, he still had to keep a reputation up around. Harry...was different. He didn't force him to change at all, nor molded into what he should be. He could be himself for once without any barriers holding him back.
"I don't know much about your home life Malfoy but I know he's wrong. Truce or not. People like that...I don't think they have much humanity left in them to realize what they're doing. They're blinded by hate."
Malfoys don't cry, his father's words rang in his ears from when he was five years old and just fell off his quidditch broom. He didn't understand the tone and threat in his voice at the time but more so when he grew older. Malfoys don't show emotion.
Harry gave a small nod. Remus stood up where he was crouching slightly and gave him a genuine smile. He messes up Harry's hair again.
He closed his eyes quickly and thought of a wish. It wasn't hard, really. The real problem was picking only one to act on.
Granger steps in before Ron could draw his wand. "Don't you have someplace to be, Malfoy?" Her stare is piercing and unforgiving.
They joined Ron, Hermione, Luna, and Neville in the library after that. Ron's eyes narrowed slightly when the two of them came in together but whatever he had in mind he didn't comment on it.
"Harry!" A voice breaks through the chaos. Harry whips around just in time to see a mass of bushy brown hair tunneling towards him.
My heart shrank a little more at her words. He could hardly believe this was the woman who was protecting him. Seeming to do more harm than good, wasn't it? At least she never purposely hit him like the others. That had to count for something.
He took in a long breathe before placing one foot on the wall and pulling himself upwards. Draco just hoped there weren't any noisy neighbors watching from there windows or they would be in much more trouble than he had signed up for.
He grabbed the nearest coat off the rack and went out the backdoor where the garden was. He would leave the property if there wasn't the risk of death eaters finding him again. His best hopes were to hide and hopes that Harry wouldn't be coming after him. Salazar's name, he felt like a four year old.
Draco stared at her as if she'd grown a secound head. She out of all people must know taking your own life couldn't be beautiful? "That's... horrid. And disgusting. Taking your own life like that isn't beautiful... It's cowardly. How can you romanticize something like that?"
"Sometimes war needs conflicts-of-interest." He says looking down into his cup of tea. The lines in his face were pulled tight as it looked like he was in deep thought about something. "It allows people to fight more passionately."
Snape slams down his wand on his desk. Draco doesn't even blink at the man's calm but collected anger. Instead, he takes the option of looking up at bookshelves surrounding them in the candlelit office.
"Yes please." He said and laid his forehead on the counter and closed his eyes. His head was pounding for some reason. Probably from the stress from yesterday catching up on him. Aunt Petunia always forced him to make some for Dudley when he was suffering from one. He'd hoped it would have the same effect on him as well.
The footsteps came closer and stopped within a couple feet in front of him. He refused to acknowledge his own existence and instead took to glaring at the Gryffindor's shoes as if they themselves had wronged him.
Harry grumbles something under his breath. The potion from earlier was starting to kick in and he found himself feeling slightly taxed out. Perhaps he would be able to find more of it or owl order some from Hogsmede.
You have caused people to needlessly suffer for you. Your ignorance of life frankly appalls me. Stop playing the victim card because you have no right. "
He thought back to that night and shivers went down his spine. The day he didn't even put up a fight in getting the dark mark. When his cowardness shown through.
Also, sorry this is sorta a filter?? I PROMISE a kiss is coming very soon... I just can't say when yet.
Harry was glad that even though the building looked to be falling apart, there was still hot water beading down on him from the showerhead. The warmth was comforting after the frigid temperature outside.
"I sent you a letter though- right before we were attacked. You didn't get it?" Harry frowned. Harry knew random owls were being checked but Hedwig had always been able to avoid being caught before.
. He doesn't think there was ever a time in his life since Voldemort walked in that the answer to that was a definite yes. But that wasn't really what he was asking though, was it? It was just another form of greeting used when they wanted it to sound like they cared, maybe sometimes people did, but never actually wanted to stay long enough for an answer other than 'good'. Besides, he had just killed his best friend. He shouldn't be causing him more grief than he already had.
Draco covered his mouth with his hand to hold back a sob. Right on his forearm was the one thing in his arm he despised the most. The black ink danced on his ghost-like skin. It was a sore thumb to the rest of him and would be for the rest of his life.
He shoved Harry's body into a lump on the floor then stormed over to the front door and left, slamming the door in the process. Aunt Petunia came in a minute after and pinched her lips at the scene.
"She's You-Know-Who's right-hand servant, but she's also a Black and she's very proud of that. She's been trying to claim Sirius' fortune for her own through various solicitors
Harry takes another step forward, not hearing the sharp edge in his voice. Draco bit back his tongue and clenched his hand on his thigh hard enough to leave bruises from under the desk. Draco was already teetering on the edge of a mental breakdown when he came in. If he didn't leave soon he would either start crying or screaming. Or both. It wasn't an order, it was a warning.
Draco subconsciously rubs his left forearm and winces at the pain. It was covered up by his usual dress-shirt and robes. There hadn't been a single time this year he hadn't been seen wearing anything other than a long-sleeves. He was hyper-vigilant about it being seen at all times. It was his biggest insecurity drawn where anyone could see it. As of now, the mark was irritated. A normal occurrence in the past weeks. It happened every time he ignored a call. It rose above the skin and the edges around it were bright red. Touching it sent a pulse of agony into his bones.
Tears racked the boy's small body as his back slid down the wall and to the floor. He was no longer the pristine boy he pretended to be and he knew it. Everything he ever did was to please him, never himself. Yet it was still never enough. No matter how cold or crude he became to be, his father would still have something to criticize.
He didn't know how true the statement was. Draco didn't take the time to find out. He wanted to move on from the conversation as it was rapidly becoming too personal.
"The blood wards on the 25th of August broke," Dumbledore explains, taking Harry by surprise. He knew he ran away but
Draco nods slightly, causing her to chuckle. “I’ve been there too. How do you think I got all these white hairs?”
"Your foods done," he stated to the fat pig sitting on the couch while making his way back upstairs. Dudley's nose scrunched up in disgust.
Ron grabbed his bicep absentmindedly to steer him toward wherever they were meeting him which caused Harry to instinctively pull back roughly. If the other noticed he didn't say anything. They knew Harry was always a little jumpy at the start of every term and Harry always had to put it down as his cousin's cruel behavior. They had no idea what really went down in Privet Drive and Harry was hoping to keep it that way.
Draco was bottling up his emotions and he didn't want that. He also didn't want to destroy Draco's good mood. Perhaps it was selfish but he missed talking to Draco about random things, even if it was only a couple days. He didn't want to scare that away now it seemed like he had it back.
She pulled away after a long moment and gave him glare then could quite frankly freeze someone down to their underwear if they hadn't been subjected to it since they were eleven. "Merlin and Morgana- Crowley- fucking hell. Where have you
"Dumbledore told you that, did he? Well, it's rubbish." Harry can hear the traces of Draco in his voice. They had spent a lot of time talking about the headmaster and only now it became clear hearing the words come out of Remus's mouth how much the Slytherin might actually be right about things. "Dumbledore doesn't know the value of people so don't let him tell him where your emotions should go. War is important but there is no point in destroying yourself when it can be avoided. You can't chase after Bellatrix just like you told me I couldn't."
Draco sighed and looked out the window where the Gryfindor team was soaring above the pitch. Harry was probably one of them. He had heard Theo go on a rant about 'the bloody scarface' getting promoted to Gryffindor team captain. Draco's team had unanimously agreed to kick him from the position of seeker this year. He could find himself caring less honestly. He had too much stuff to worry about anyway.
Harry finds himself smiling too against all odds. This 'getting along' thing was weird and new but he definitely wasn't complaining. Sure, he had to fight back insults sometimes but that was out of habit, not spite. The more they would sit together in silence he found himself
Draco caught up to him easily seeing as he was taller. He had been expecting the boy to stop when he got under his bedroom window, but no. He had continued to the gate leading to the yard behind the house.
His throat felt clogged and his brain was racing. He didn't know if he had just overstepped or not. Draco refused to think about what Harry and his next conversation would include.
"Y-yeah. I got cut from the Quidditch team until I 'get better'. It didn't matter that I was the captain."
?" Harry fumed. His hand went instinctively for his wand in his robes only for him to remember they were still on the floor. He reached for them quickly and Malfoy's cold fingers grabbed him by the shoulder and pushed him back down into the seat.
He rubbed his arm self-consciously, suddenly feeling out of place. He had almost managed to not think about his godfather this entire summer but now seeing his old professor standing in front of him was making it all come back. He gulped nervously and clenched the edge of the loose muggle jumper he was wearing.
"I told Dumbledore we shouldn't have let you go back there. It was too soon- I should have known. I'm so sorry."
His mother and he had still made short visits to her in secret when his father wasn’t home. Although she still believed in blood purity, his mother also believed that it wasn’t worth losing a valuable friendship over. That is until the war resurfaced. They couldn't risk being spotted with her now. He was on the very edge being here as it was now.
He was sitting on top of his tower, an unusual addition to the architecture of Hogwarts. He had discovered it by accident in his second year when trying a way to escape his goons to take a breather. Draco genuinely had no idea how the spot wasn't already taken by dozens of students. It was well hidden (you had to pull a brick in the wall on the third floor behind the tapestry of Sir Elwin) but not enough that it would escape the notice of centuries of Hogwarts students. The magic had to be insanely complex because the tower easily had to be one of the tallest in all of the grounds but was invisible if trying to find it from the outside. It was small though; roughly only four meters in diameter all around and took countless flights of stairs to get all the way to the top. It was peaked with large white granite pillars, each inscribed with elegant runes, that held up a domed glass roof. Draco had since then made the very peak of it practically his second room at Hogwarts. There were boobytraps, hexes, and wards he set every year so if anyone else suddenly got the wrong idea they would whimper away with their tails between their legs.
Draco recoiled slightly at his words. Did Potter really mean that? Did he really think he deserved that? He couldn't help but feel as he was shot with the killing curse. It was partially his fault that the raven-haired boy in front of him felt that way. Once again, Draco hated who he had become. Or, who his
He shoves a chocolate frog in Harry's hands with a demand to eat. In his other is an already opened envelope he seems frantic over.
"Fine." Draco huffs but still watchful of Harry's sudden change of behavior from this morning. "Take off your shirt."
There was a collective groan. Everyone knew partnering the two rivals would only result in a fight. No one would be getting work done if they so much as even looked at each other funny.
"Fat chance," Draco snorts. "You're playing with fire, you know. How do you know it won't kill you before then?"
Draco had never been much of an affectionate person. At age five he'd demanded his mother stop kissing his cheek because he was 'too grown-up'. Perhaps it was his father's blood because he sure as hell didn't express his emotions either (he debated whether he had any to begin with). Draco liked to think of himself a bit more formal or reserved than that. He was much more accustomed to exchanging pleasantries and saying what he meant without physically acting. He didn't like impulse. He was a Slytherin for a reason.
"Salazar's name you're annoying." He says though it doesn't take much damage with the tiniest hint of a laugh pulling at the corner of his mouth. "It builds up your immune system from unexpected curses or hexes. Might help with whatever if with your stomach until you decide to man up and go to the hospital wing."
"Stop asking that way. It's weird." Harry grumbles, his face burning with a faint pink over the bridge of his nose. Nevertheless, Harry pulls off his robes and unbuttons his shirt so he can see the inky mark on his stomach.
Draco didn't have the heart to tell her he probably wouldn't be coming back if all went to plan. He was going straight to the Manor after he was done. He was a deadman as it was already. He didn't want to drag on his punishment more than he had too.
Harry gave him the bucket filled with the chunks of meat and started to feed it. To his surprise, the creature took an odd liking to the blonde. It bowed it's head to Draco in an act of respect, much like a hippogriff, then pushed it's snout up against his pale hand. It even neighed in comfort. Harry watched the exchanged very carefully as he started to groom the miss-shapen horse.
It was Harry's turn to be embarrassed as his eyes flew open to see what he was talking about. He glared at the other when he felt nothing there. Draco only gave a mischievous smirk back.
Harry immediately takes notice of the dozens of books covering every piece of furniture. They were scattered all over the place like a tornado had ripped a library and tossed the remnants here.
There's a deep understanding when their eyes meet. "Ok. As long as it helps. Try to come back at a reasonable time, though, okay? There's no point if you miss out on your sleep entirely."
Remus rubbed his back and said some things that Harry guessed were supposed to be comforting if they didn't go in one ear and out the other. He knew the cycle by now. The headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, then exhaustion. He cursed his stupidity for not realizing sooner and leaving Hogwarts without thinking about the consequences.
Oops! Sorry for the long wait uhhhh I kinda have no excuse for this. This chapter is the longest ever though being double the size of the earlier chapters??? Tbh I shouldn't even be writing this its 11 pm and I gotta study for my drivers test tomorrow hahaha I'm screwed.
Draco felt himself panic a little. He knew these were symptoms of a panic attack from his own experience, but what the bloody hell was he supposed to help another's?
"You're what now?" He seems surprised by Harry's sudden action and even more so by the statement. Merlin, he was absolutely clueless when it came to anything outside the wizarding world.
Both of them turned and gave him a searching look. Draco hadn't told them about that. He saw no point.
Hagrid pulled Harry aside after he finished reading off the list. Ron and Hermione gave him a sympathetic glance. "Sorry abou' this Harry. Have ter keep an eye on 'im, yeh know? Can' afford ter have the ministry on me back again. . . Dumbledore needs me. I can' be leaving jus yet."
For the millionth time, he wondered if his parents would even notice his absence. The clock on the nightstand read five. There were only a few hours until they ate dinner and his father definitely know by then. Draco's blood was cold at the thought of his reaction. Why couldn't bloody Potter let him go home when he wanted? He was smart enough to could have figured something out. Draco had to stop himself from jumping out the window.
It was distant to him. He wanted so badly to be a part of it. How could you miss something you never truly had?
His muscles ached as he pulled himself up on the window seal. Thankfully, all he had to do was slipe the panel up to get in. Five years of Quidditch and not a single muscle built. Bloody unfair, he thinks, throwing himself on the hard floorboard.
was the fair? For anyone? Yes, there were always the Weasleys, but even then he felt like he was intruding on their family when they invited him over for long periods. Especially Christmas.
"If I had my wand this would be much easier. I could just do a delusion charm and we would be right in." Malfoy went on, "We might have to reply on a potion or pre-charmed item. Polyjuice would be ideal but I doubt we'll be able to find a store selling it. I might be able to brew some? No no, the recipe takes over a month..."
Despite the house being empty, Draco couldn't help himself to try to make his steps as quiet as possible. Nonetheless, he opened the door and tipped toed through the dark hallway. The cool banister at his fingertips as he went down down the stairs sent shivers down his back. It reminded him of the time he had tried sneaking out when the abuse first started. He had been caught and not let out of the darkened dungeons for days.  Maybe it was his paranoia, but he felt the same eyes on him as he did that night.  Fear built up in his throat.
Ron sputters next to him before Harry can think to. His mind is still frozen from the topic of Draco. "B-but that can take forever! What about lessons?! And quidditch?!"
"Are we not talking about the same old, manipulative bastard? You said it yourself, Dumbledore knew exactly what was going on inside that house and despite your desperate pleas he left you there."
Draco's trolley squeaked next to Harry's as they made their way towards the loading dock. He was fitted with the same glamour  as a few days before to not bring attention to himself just in case there were death eaters on prowl. Harry wanted to point out if there really were death eaters he would probably already know and that their main focus would be on the Boy-Who-Lived, not the blonde. Then he realized that probably made him sound ignorant - that Draco was fine and had perfect reason to be worried- and he should keep his mouth shut before he started sounding like Professor Snape.
"And why exactly not? You left school grounds without permission. If I had any right of mind I would have contacted your father immediately."
Harry stumbled out of the room with Draco's help, and with each step his stomach tightened and ached all the more. The wave of nausea that hit Harry was so intense that he hardly made it to the toilet bowl before he emptied his stomach. Ashen faced, he clung to it as a life raft. His stomach felt like the bag in a set of bag-pipes being vigorously squeezed. With a heaving lurch of his stomach another small mouthful of bile dribbled from his quivering lips into the waiting pool of rancid vomit.
"Come, Harry. In my office please." Dumbledore turned to the statue blocking the entrance. "Crunchie."
Heyo- I know this is quick but I'm trying to apologize for my two weeks of not updating this month. I also wanted to have a certain number of chapters posted a month so I crammed a sneaky one in today, o0ps. AND I wanna hurry up and get to the kiss scene ;)
It was only seconds later after the brunet took it did he notice the burning comet soaring over both of their heads.
It was Ron. His eyes captured Draco's own and he seemed just as panicked as he was. He hadn't accounted for Ron's low attention span and need to annoy Hermione. A part of him almost wanted to laugh in payback.
Harry had gotten a note, an origami crane like before, last night while he was getting ready for bed. Draco wanted to talk to him in the tower before the feast seeing as it was the one night in the next couple of weeks he wouldn't be gone for detention.
"Your mother's magic was in charge of the wards holding up Privet Drive. For the wards to snap her magic had come across the conflict of the wards doing more harm than good. It refused to use itself to cause damage to you, and ultimately, resulting in the collapse."
Luna hums some off-tune song down at her homework. "I don't think so. He was rather upset. I think you should steer clear of him. Gulping Plimpies are contagious. They can make you say do things you don't mean."
Draco stares at him as though he just stabbed him through the chest. He looks back down at his book as if he is contemplating something. "I don't understand how you can be so selfless after everything. You've never had a break. Don't you ever want to hold on to something? Give people who've wronged you a taste of their own medicine?"
"Nice shot, Weasley. Didn't know you had it in you. How about a one-on-one? I can keep my back turned if it's easier for you," said Draco. His eyes met Harry's for a brief second before he tore them away harshly. The words weren't nearly as sharp as some other words that had boiled up inside him he could have chosen. He would have shoved the whirlpool of emotions someplace where he could have disposed of the property later on, but he supposed if he didn't say something it would be more suspicious than not. Instead would harness them. It wasn't
Just then, his elbowed jerked again and knocked over the inkpot. It spilled over the text and over the table, causing Pansy to shriek and jump back. A couple students stopped to look at them.
Draco held his breath. There were at least one or two bruised ribs he could see. Some of the cuts looked like they were affected as well. His ankle could be broken yet he couldn't be sure yet.
"I'm serious though! You would be safe at Hogwarts. You don't have to go to the headmaster I suppose, but you have to think about it. Do you want to be on the run the rest of your life with no more than a 5th year education against Voldemort's merciless army or do you want to help get rid of him once and for all?"
Harry frantically started to button up his uniform and slip on his robes that he thankful already had on. By the time he slipped on his robes, Draco had already unlocked his trunk using Harry's wand on the seat.
Ron nodded understandingly, looking down at his hands. "Then... who are you going to? If you are, I mean."
"I think others would disagree," Harry managed through another fit of coughs. Draco grimaces and casts a wordless less. Immediately Harry's lungs begin to feel better.
Getting on his knees, he examines the cupboard Harry had described. It was usually small with golden vent gates. He could barely make out a child's handwriting that had been painted over.   He quickly tried the handle to find it locked. He cursed. Of course the blasted muggles had to go and make things difficult for him.  It was one of those rare moments he appreciated his father's countless lessons on wandless magic as a child.
Harry seemed to completely forget that Draco was even in the room so he got up and wandered slowly to where he was sitting. Watery green eyes met with his own. Draco felt his heart squeeze.
The stench of mead and firewhiskey hit him as soon as they entered the small pub. It wasn't as crowded as the night before but still proved to be a challenge to navigate. Especially with both of them trying to keep their identity secret.
Life is meaningless to him. You out all people should know that! You knew that when you took the part and you knew that when you decided to cowardly run away."
Harry's fingers subconsciously reach into his pocket for the glass mirror shard he'd gotten used to carrying around with him. It kept him grounded any time the topic of his godfather came about.
"You remind me of a goldfish Dudley. It can fight but it won't have enough IQ points to remember it ten seconds later," he smirks.
He watched as dark storm clouds blow in and cover the sky. His mouth formed a frown. He had made sure to read the paper beforehand. It wasn't supposed to rain for nearly two more days.
- It'll be a disaster. Harry was failing most of their expectations of him, especially with last year's catastrophe, but to see their disappointed faces in him would make it so much clearer. Harry supposed the only reason why Draco knowing was different was because he never really had high expectations of him in the first place and vise versa. But that was changing rapidly as time grew on and he was gaining more and more respect for the other, so could he even say that was what it was truly?
The chill is like a drip of freezing water running off his stomach, jangling his nerves, setting his teeth on edge and marching it's way from his stomach to his arms and legs.
"I'm fine." Harry shuts the book a little harder than necessary and looks up to where Remus was holding a cup of tea and leaning against the kitchen island. The man had been treating him like a ticking time bomb since his outbreak yesterday morning. It almost made him wish he
Draco looked up at it with wide eyes. His throat nearly closed up. Instead of pushing it away like every reasonable part of him wanted, he grabbed hold of it desperately with shaky hands still refusing to meet Harry's eyes.
Hedwig hooted again and flew toward a plate of food he had just realized was there. His stomach rumbled at the thought of a hot meal. Harry stood up, wincing as his foot made contact with the ground, and walked over to it. The plate was filled with sausage, bacon, fried eggs, toast, and even some treacle tart. His mouth watered at the sight of it.
"That's what I thought. And besides, they would have no idea where to cross at. You would need me. It's just easier if we ask the neighbor tomorrow. If you can survive until then," he sneers.
he might be wrong about that though. Draco knew what he was doing was wrong. He didn't want to watch people be tortured in front of him, or murder muggles, or serve as the Dark Lord's right-hand man. His father did and lost his sanity a long time ago because of it. Harry's words come swimming back to him.
Harry stares at the man in front of him for a second before it sets in. Sudden years of weight on his shoulders crumble into dust underneath his feet. He almost cries in relief.
But the tiny voice in his head had given him a little bit of hope. Perhaps this is the miracle she had mentioned? If they could find you they would have already. Going back would be such a waste, wouldn't it? To finally get your dreams fulfilled to foolishly throw it back at the universes face. Maybe you could be safe. Safe with Potter.
"Fine," Harry groans. He honestly was getting anxious about that. Last year they were only there for about thirty minutes. Surely they'll be back any minute now?
The headache only worsened as he stood up. Flecks of darkness flashed in his vision and his feet felt like jelly. Before he could fall he grabbed onto the counter but not without a loud bang that alerted Remus.
"Believe it or not Potter, I'm not a complete ignorant prat. I know when there are boundaries and when or when I haven't crossed them. You just happened to be passed that point."
"Ok, I'll climb up first and just open the door for you, okay?" Harry asked. Draco was hesitant. Harry might looked healed but he doubted he had regained enough of his strength to climb the rope. Draco had seen how much he had struggled to carry his books back to the inn earlier that day. He was still weak and no doubt suffering some sort of fatigue from the fast-paced medicine.
"Jumpy, are we? I told you not to eat all that sugar. If I ate like you my mother would have a fit!"
Harry was as red as a Bubotuber and radiated heat like a hot pan. You could have cooked a three-course meal on his face. No-one, not even the innocent trolley lady, could have missed it. He wanted the earth to open up and swallow him whole. Harry never wanted to slap Draco so bad. He was getting a kick out of this, watching Harry squirm in embarrassment. He was purposely trying to take as long as he could and he just knew it.
OK SO. I T H O U G H T I POSTED THIS CHAPTER BUT IT DIDN'T APPARENTLY AND I ENDED UP POSTING THE NEXT CHAPTER BEFORE THIS ONE AND I'm so sorry I have brain damage. I'm so sorry for everyone who was confused. yikes. Thanks to xmaude_maryx and YourBubblegumPrince for helping me realize my Big Dumb move.
"I thought you were just scared as I was! Apparently fucking not. And you're not even worried! You probably planned it all out, didn't you! I should have guessed. Can't I just have
Harry nodded stiffly. He had honestly no idea why this topic of conversation was being brought up now.
Harry had never said the words out loud before. Nor had he ever talked to anyone about Cedric other than Ron and Hermione either. It felt strange and he didn't know whether he enjoyed the weighted that crumbled off his shoulders with it.
... He needed to talk to Dumbledore. He was the only person who could sort all of this out. He voiced his thoughts to the blonde who shrugged. "Fine, talk to the crazy bastard if you insist. Use an anti-tracking charm on your owl. I don't want anyone to find us after we just escaped. Also-" he lifts up his mug with a pout that resembled a kicked puppy. "More please?"
Draco growled and turned away with distaste. There was no point, they weren't going to get any information anyways. Yatin was just the type of person who would make up such a lie to make himself look good.
Draco continued down the hallway with his head held high, completely ignoring the trio. If he was going to make a change in his life, he had to start somewhere. Even if it was small, even if it was the appalling baby steps, he would get through it.
Harry sets the plate down next to him and stares at him expectantly. Draco takes one glance before turning back to his book. He could hardly pay attention to what it was saying.
Ron shifted awkwardly. "Well, I may be a heavy sleeper but I'm not that dumb... I hear you sneak out some nights. I, uh, just didn't comment about it because it seemed kind of... personal. There are somethings you don't even tell your best mate about."
Harry holds his arm to the light, his skin ghostly in the glow of the moon. On each arm, there are great purple welts that will only deepen over the coming week. Bruises and cuts were scattered across his abdomen like a disease. The worst of it was on his back. There were years worth of scaring hidden underneath the freshly made gashes and swelling.
He couldn't control his actions after that. It happened so fast the other poor boy could barely process what was happening before it was too late. Harry had Malfoy pinned up against the outer bathroom wall with his forearm on his throat, anger clearly written on his face despite the pain from the sudden movements.
The previous tension between the two was now gone. Though Harry would be lying if he said he still didn't feel anything between them. Until now, Harry always thought it was just because of the rivalry they had, but as he thought about it more, it was always there. Since the first day they met in the robe shop, Harry knew.
Harry shrugs awkwardly and looks up at him with a sheepish smile. Draco wondered how he was talking so casually. "Not the first time I've been told that. I'm serious though. You're wrong. I don't know you. I thought I did, but I don't think that was ever you."
He knew he didn't deserve Harry's forgiveness. He had done so much to warrant his hatred, so what did he do to warrant his apology?
Draco glanced back at the guitar. He hadn't touched it since he'd come back to school. There was an uncertain, looming darkness around it that warded him away. It was too tangled up in his inner turmoil now. It was a perfect representation of the two wars inside his head. One that his father's opinion shouldn't matter after everything he's done and was the spark of rebellion that led him to learn in the first place. The darker part of him doubted his defiance, that his father really was looking out for the best of him and it was his fault he couldn't be the son that he wanted. Was it crazy to believe in both things equally at once?
Draco looked down at the curse swirling on his forearm and grimaced in disgust. His father was a horrible person. His opinions shouldn't matter. But then again, why did Draco's own? He was a horrible person as well and making the exception for himself would only prove his point further.
Harry looked back to where Draco was standing a couple feet behind him. It surprised to hear him speak up seeing as it seemed he was being ignored. He was more distant today than he had been all year.
Have you looked into a mirror recently? Because I think you’re the one who needs to keep their trap shut. Your whole family at that.”
Harry eyed the creature carefully. It reminded him of his stunt last year. It's boney frame sent chills of guilt to line his stomach. He cursed Hagrid for picking one of the worst animals possible.
“A fight," he chooses his words carefully like he was trained to do. "And I regret it. Don't mistake me as petty, though. But if he hadn’t commenced it, I wouldn’t have been incited. My words were vile and I think I might have gone too far."
"Magic is instinctual and very possessive of the wizard it lives inside. It's a living thing seeking to protect itself. Therefore it protects the wizard from harm. I'm sure you've already figured that much out for yourself. It's why we heal faster from ordinary humans." Dumbledore elaborates as he unwraps a candy from the bowl on his desk. Harry nods for him to continue. "So, naturally, magic refuses to hurt itself. Same reason you cannot cast an unforgivable without the real intent to do so or you cannot turn your own wand against yourself."
