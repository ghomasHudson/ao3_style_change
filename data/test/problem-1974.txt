Draco forgot how to breathe, his gaze fixed on Potter’s shoulder as the edges of his vision blurred with panic. Had Potter heard everything? The room started to fade.
“I have to go get some help,” Draco rasped, leaning against the gurney with a grunt, his arm limp. “I can’t do this alone. I’ll be right back.”
“Draco, stop. You don’t understand,” he says, his voice rough. “All I could think about the whole drive home was getting you in the backseat and fucking you.”
“I’ll try to get your hair clean before they come to collect you,” he said softly, still avoiding those eyes that had haunted his dreams for what felt like his entire life. “I don’t know if you’d planned to be buried or cremated, but the people at the funeral home usually just style it for the viewing. And, not to be rude, but it looks like someone doused you in soot. I’m guessing you were chasing someone through the Floo earlier. I got it off your face, but getting it out of your hair might take me longer.”
Sure enough, inside were full-size photos of Harry exiting the back door of the club, his head ducked down but still completely recognizable. He had most assuredly not been wearing any leather in that picture—but his jeans left very little to the imagination.
No longer could he imagine bumping into Potter and striking up a conversation. No longer could he speculate on how he might ask him out. No longer could he pretend there was any chance, no matter how farfetched, that the man he’d been dreaming about for the past ten years might want him back.
that awful racket? Through the front window, I see a dated car pulling into our driveway. It’s hideous. Some American monstrosity. Expecting it to back out and turn around, I’m shocked when the headlights flick off and Harry pops out the driver’s side, glasses glinting in the setting sun.
Stumbling over to the chair by the worktop, Draco collapsed into it, holding his head in his hands. The tension in him snapped, and the sobs that had been trapped in his throat erupted in a crackly bawl.
Draco’s hand started to tremble, the palsy traveling up his entire arm. Gritting his teeth, he strove to ignore it, but denial had a way of breaking the man who abused it. He could talk till he was blue in the face, pretend Harry was still alive, pretend he would find something else to look forward to. But the truth always came out in the end.
After two more dry heaves, the tension faded to a dull ache, and Draco pressed a hand to his stomach, gingerly testing for any adverse reactions. When the acidic roiling slowed to a churn, he spat the bitter coating from his tongue and wiped at his sticky mouth.
“Harry,” Hermione said, leaning forward and piercing him with a probing stare to rival the ones Dumbledore used to give him. “Breaking into Gringotts and escaping on a
it, because thinking about other people is second nature to him. He’d never needed telling the way Draco took it: he’d simply picked up on it.
“Why do you …?” he began, but found he couldn’t finish the sentence. Thankfully, Potter didn’t need him to.
to be having fun, Draco," says Hermione, sidling up and nudging him with her elbow. And in a lower voice, "You know you didn’t have to come. Ron’s got more than enough people here."
Agonisingly gentle fingers stroked across the jagged line of a faded white scar which stretched from one side of his abdomen to the other, crisscrossing near the end with another, this one shorter but thicker, having been much deeper.
“Draco, where are you going?” Pansy demanded when he’d stood up suddenly from the table. But he ignored her. He didn’t have Potter’s uncanny ability to track people down, but Draco was determined to find him. He’d start somewhere around where Gryffindor Tower was supposed to be, and if he couldn’t find him there, well … he’d corner him somehow.
“Fuck you!” Harry yells, tugging again at his ties and shouting at the futility of it. Draco’s watching this with glazed eyes and wet lips. “Fucking just — god, just sit on my cock, you fucking inbred little cocksucker!”
, yes,” Draco breathed. He only had a moment to prepare himself before Harry’s middle finger was breaching his entrance and pushing inside of him. It was utterly unlike anything he’d ever experienced before — similar in nature to the way it felt to be fingered in his arse, but at the same time wholly different in a way it was difficult to pinpoint. He could feel the sponginess of his walls contracting around those thick fingers, and of course, it was instantly frictionless in a way getting his arse fingered never could have been thanks to his brand-new self-lubricating abilities.
“Oh, believe me, I considered it,” Adrian laughed. “Only my sister-in-law’s going ballistic and I feel sort of bad.”
— had caused it, yet he couldn’t find the energy to be upset. Not when he felt better than he had since … well, he couldn’t really remember the last time he’d felt this good, actually. When he was fifteen, perhaps.
“I’m yours,” he said, lifting a hand to cup the back of Harry’s head, fingers threading through his hair. “And you’re
, but it tingled. This alone would have been enough to make his throat close up. The whole classroom went quiet, but Harry couldn’t tell if that had actually happened or if it was just because his ears had started ringing. Everyone was looking at him, he realised after a moment. Like someone turning up the volume, he noticed suddenly that Professor Boothby was talking to him.
what it was doing, and jumped out of the way to avoid a collision. He stared at it blankly, not recognizing the owl and unable to understand who in the world could have been bringing him a parcel for Christmas other than his mother.
Malfoy nodded. He stared at Harry another moment and then slid back down in the bed, blond hair splaying out around his head on the pillow.
,” Draco said. His voice was thick with barely-suppressed emotion, cheeks on fire. “Not when I know how completely ephemeral this is.”
“Yeah,” he says. “Probably.” And then, not really sure where he’s getting the bollocks, “D’you wanna get a drink with me tonight at the Three Broomsticks?”
Leaving Draco feeling puzzled indeed, Granger walked off presumably to find Weasley. Her kindness was entirely foreign to him, particularly because he knew well that she was doing it solely for Potter’s benefit, not because of any desire on her part to help out. That was what made it so baffling — Draco had never been acquainted with anyone before who would have put aside their own animosities just to make their friend happy.
“Why are you so determined to believe that’s all this is?” he questioned softly. And what right did he have, really? Sounding so sickeningly sincere, so utterly laid out for Draco’s perusal? It was something Draco himself had never been any good at — it was perhaps the reason he’d excelled in Occlumency. Shutting down his emotions was second nature. Potter was, of course, just the opposite. He seemed not to be afraid of emotional pain, and that fact never failed to leave Draco feeling completely out of his element.
The door opened and Pansy strolled in already dressed for the day, eyes stuck on what was presumably the front page of today’s
“Library,” he says mildly. “Hitting dead-ends at the Ministry one so I thought I’d give it a shot here.”
“Er — hello,” she said, and Draco could only gape. “Pansy — erm — she didn’t look like she was going to come help you. I … I thought …” And to Draco’s utter astonishment, she held up what appeared to be a small cotton pad. “They’re not hard to use. The back is sticky. And they’re charmed so they’ll last longer.”
Draco looked up at him, eyebrows drawing in. “You really believe he’d want to keep it? We’re not even nineteen.”
His hands shook as he stood outside the Great Hall as dinner was starting, letting the stares of the student body roll off of him like nothing more than water, feverishly searching for that black shock of hair.
mean that I’m going to get down on my knees and do the same!” His chest was heaving, and although he hated it, Draco wasn’t surprised to feel the wetness of tears stinging his eyes.
“You asked me about the Map and I showed it to you,” Potter said reasonably — except it wasn’t reasonable
“Brilliant. Take my hand.” He pulled away and held his palm out, meeting Malfoy’s eyes challengingly with a smirk — after a moment of hesitation Malfoy took it and they spun on the spot, Harry leading him through the unbearably tight pressure of time and space to his flat.
, too tight to open him up much more than that. Malfoy made a high keening noise that brought a satisfied smirk to Harry’s face.
Draco, emotion making his throat tight and tears itching his eyes, searched for any sign of uncertainty or hesitation on Harry's face and saw none. He meant it, he meant every word, right down to his bleeding-heart bones. Draco's brain tried to remind him for the millionth time that that promise couldn't be made until he was back in his old body, but his heart wouldn't hear it. In this moment, he believed Harry utterly.
“I can’t talk about this right now,” Harry said suddenly. There could have been nothing Draco had expected to hear less than this sentence; if he
“Hufflepuff doesn’t stand a bloody chance against you, eh, Potter?” he grinned. “Maybe if Diggory was still around. Good luck out there. You too, Weasley.”
try to let yourself heal. I know you, Draco, and I know that you’re probably holding him at arm’s length as hard as you can. If you think he loves you back, then
“I, er — suppose I should be going, then. It’s a quarter of four already. Are you … you’re okay, yeah? That was all right?”
,” his voice rose to a high, breathy pitch, hips twitching involuntarily when Potter’s lips closed around his clit and sucked. His fingers dug into Potter’s head, grounding himself, feeling quite as though his body had caught on fire. He’d had his cock sucked, of course, but this was …
"Draco," he whispers, bringing one of those hands around to cup his face, to make Draco look at him. "Relax. You're shaking."
“Guess I’ll see you round, then, Malfoy,” he said. With a last infuriating look, he followed after Sprout, probably to try and catch the last of the Quidditch match.
And he did — he let go of his thigh and curled his slim hand around his cock, keening. It took only a few strokes before he threw his head back, mouth open, and the muscles in his stomach started contracting frenetically. He came all over his chest with Harry fingering him through it, his hips bucking frantically and then slowing, until he was twitching and shaking and pushing Harry's hand away. Harry laughed softly and kissed his cheek.
What he wanted now, more than anything else in the world it seemed, was to tell Hermione. He hadn’t any real clue as to how she would react, but the exhilaration of the whole thing was so great, Harry felt he might explode into a million pieces if he wasn’t able to gush about it a bit.
“Wait,” Draco managed at the last second, getting Weasley’s attention before he disappeared around a corner. Weasley turned around with an eyebrow lifted, and Draco had to fight off his hackles from raising. “Why did you do that just now?”
“I beg to differ,” says Potter. His grin is shit-eating and much too smug for Draco’s taste, more of a
“Ron’s told me about Malfoy,” she said candidly, making Harry’s stomach do a strange sort of startled flip-flop. “I’m not here to yell at you,” she added quickly, probably having seen the apprehension on his face. “I’m a bit disappointed and very,
Death Eaters were captured and put behind bars — every few years like clockwork some neo-Death Eater faction would pop up and cause trouble until the Ministry put a stop to it, usually with Harry in charge. He wasn’t even Head Auror (although at just twenty-nine years old he was well on his way) but he invariably led those missions. Perhaps because he managed to get it done so efficiently.
“I’ll always care about you, Harry,” she said quietly, and his heart felt as though she’d grasped it on either side and ripped it into two bloody pieces. “If this is what makes you happy, then I
“Here,” said Malfoy, and he went to a door a few yards further down the corridor, away from the blasted wall where Fred died (Harry had to forcefully shove this thought away) and the Room of Requirement. Harry followed him inside and found an untouched classroom, western-facing and thus still somewhat dark. When the door was closed Malfoy turned back to him and reached immediately for Harry’s shirt, which Harry let him pull over his head.
— he dropped his lips open and sucked it into his mouth, earning a high keen from Draco. It was mortifying how quickly he could feel his cunt starting to leak.
“I know Harry seems like he’s unbreakable, Malfoy. And for the most part, he pretty much is. But he’s gone through some seriously fucked up shit in his life, and if anyone deserves something good, it’s Harry. Whatever you decide to do, just make sure you let
“Let’s go,” he said, nodding in the direction of the cemetery’s kissing gates. “There’s a pub me and Hermione saw last time. We can go there after, have lunch before we go back.”
"Just give it a chance," said Harry. "I'm not gonna stop talking to him, Goyle. You might as well quit making it so hard for me."
Draco stops praying. November comes and is unseasonably warm and wet. He goes through the motions of his days and rarely talks, so that on the rare occasion that he does it always sounds disused. There is no pleasure in food, reading, learning, sex. He thinks wistfully and often of being dead.
He has his fingers in the powder when Harry finally joins them, verdant eyes finding Draco and settling there. His hands are shoved modestly into the pockets of his jeans and there's a look on his face like he knows it was audacious to come in here, yet he'd done it anyway. Draco misses him so fiercely in this moment that he allows himself a brief fantasy where he goes over there and lets Harry wrap him up in one of those big stupid bear hugs he'd always loved so much. He gets the unsettling feeling Harry knows exactly what's going on in his head just as clearly as if he'd written it out on a piece of parchment for him.
A burning warmth made Harry’s insides feel fuzzy and he laughed again. He kissed Malfoy on the mouth, then on the cheek, and then trailed a line of them down to his chest, where he slowed down significantly as his lips moved over the supple skin where his breast began. Malfoy heaved a deep breath, squeezing the hand Harry was still holding. Heart pounding out a tattoo against his ribs, Harry finally moved his mouth over Malfoy’s small pink nipple and sucked lightly. Malfoy’s chest arched and a gasping sound left his lips. Encouraged, Harry worked it over with his lips and his tongue. At the same time, he snaked both his hands beneath Malfoy’s arched torso and — thanking Merlin for the amount of times he and Ginny had indulged in an impromptu hookup, forcing Harry to learn how to fumble open a bra clasp in a hurry — undid Malfoy’s silky brassiere.
“Holy shit, Potter,” Draco said shakily, trembling against the door and sobbing out pitifully at the first press of Harry’s tongue worming inside of him. His thumbs were still spreading Draco open immodestly, and he distinctly felt Harry pushing his spit inside with each stab of his tongue deeper inside, along with the slippery slick dripping from his pussy. His rim was loosening rapidly beneath Harry’s relentless tongue-fucking, and at some point he felt one globe of his arse released only to have Harry swipe his fingers through Draco’s cunt, gather up his juices, and slip the longest into Draco’s arse.
and he realised suddenly how good it would feel to fuck someone, to have that release, to be able to pour everything he'd been feeling the last twenty-four hours into something so raw and simple, something that needed no brain-power, something he’d never even done before.
no," Harry muttered, already up from his seat with a hand on his wand. "All right, I've had enough of this —"
By the time April rolled around Draco's and Goyle's presence had become so normal that there had been occasions where Harry slept late on weekends and went downstairs to find Goyle and Ron playing Exploding Snap or chatting about Quidditch on their own, or else Draco and Hermione doing homework together, just as if it was the most natural thing in the world. A few times people like Dean, Seamus, and Stephen included Draco and Goyle in their "hello"s, and once Harry could have sworn he saw Parvati smile at Goyle.
, Harry thought. That’s what that was. A guilty conscience. As if Harry had needed more proof than the terrified look in Malfoy’s eyes. Kenny’s friends let go of him, albeit hesitantly. Kenny had risen onto his arms, propping himself up despite his useless legs, and even tried to back away when Harry stepped forward.
it as he jerked and quivered through an orgasm, but Harry had to muffle his own cry in Malfoy's neck when he came. He ground his pulsing cock against Malfoy's arse until he was trembling and out of breath and realised he was gripping Malfoy's waist so tightly his nails were pinching the skin.
“Yeah, and when Harry decides he wants to talk to you, skiving off all the lessons we have together isn’t going to stop him. You know that, don’t you?”
Draco had to clamp his teeth shut when Potter finally spotted him and landed, windblown and breathing heavy with exertion.
“Oh my goodness,” Harry heard Hermione breathe, and if he’d been able to form words, he might have told her that this was a drastically under-exaggerated reaction. The girl with Malfoy’s hair and a radically more feminine face was wearing robes that were too big for her, and she was standing beside Pansy Parkinson, who was shooting death-glares at anybody walking by who stared too long. Malfoy — or whoever was wearing Malfoy’s robes — had their head down and was fiddling anxiously with their fingers in front of them.
Potter crawled on top of him, between Draco’s legs. He could instantly feel the hardness of Potter’s cock when their hips slotted together, making him pull in a shuddering breath as he pulled Potter down to crash their mouths together again. But Potter only indulged him a few moments before he was breaking away, hands tugging Draco’s shirt off and then removing his own. They came back together messily, and broke apart once more with panting breaths to remove the rest. It didn’t even seem to occur to them to hesitate, and it was only a feeble voice inside his head that made Draco wonder whether he was comfortable being completely naked in front of Potter in this new body — or at
Potter smiled, the ambivalence melting away from his face as quickly as it had appeared there. “Well, it was probably Lupin, mostly. But I think my dad and Sirius likely were the ones who knew the most about the castle. The names came from their Animagus forms. They learned it when they were in school, so they could … help control Lupin during full moons, I guess. Prongs, that was my dad. A stag. Same as his Patronus.”
” He tries not to sound bitter and scared and worst of all, pleading. He doesn’t think he’s all that successful. “I don’t even know what that means. A chance at what?”
"Yeah, that's Draco, Ted, that's your cousin," Harry said, kissing the baby's soft cheek. "You wanna hold him?"
As soon as he noticed Potter stand up, Draco did as well. Across the room, Draco saw him look his way again, and Draco caught his eye for a moment before Potter was out the door.
.” Draco huffs out a frustrated breath. “I think it looks nice. The … design of it, you know? It’s pretty.” The blush from his face has reached his neck.
But at that moment the doors to the Great Hall opened and Goyle walked inside, looking tired and extremely grumpy. At first he seemed not to notice anything, and then all at once he did.
In only his bra, Draco looked in wonder at his reflection, one hand planted firmly on the small but definitely-noticeable bump where his flat belly had once been. Across the room, Harry sat hunched over the desk, scribbling frantically as he tried to finish an essay due the next morning.
“Then you know you need to be on your best behaviour if you expect it to be hosted here again within this
"Yeah. Twice. I guess I'm not totally surprised how demanding you are —" Draco kicked his shin and Harry broke off with a shout of surprise. "Ow!"
“Kick me out?” he repeated, pulling his legs in closer, away from Potter, his back straightening in a defensive posture. Potter appeared to read something of Draco’s disquietude on his face, because he, too, seemed to stiffen a little bit. When Draco spoke next, he heard the barely-concealed suspicion-cum-accusation in his own voice. “Why would my own
For the rest of the weekend and into the following week, Draco kept even more unusually quiet than he had since the first day he’d returned to lessons after the hex. That night with Potter had felt so monumental, had impacted him so deeply, left him so emotionally stripped and bare, that it seemed strange he hadn’t been marked with some sort of physical evidence of its having happened. But there was nothing — just his puffy red eyes the next morning when he woke up to another note from Potter (“
“When you kill someone,” Potter explained, “it damages your soul. A Horcrux is when you put a piece of it that’s split off into an object, to make you immortal, you know? Voldemort made six of them. Well, and, er — a seventh one, too, by accident. One of them was a diary, I guess he left it with your dad before he disappeared the first time. Your dad — erm — he didn't know what it was, he just knew it had something to do with the Chamber of Secrets, is my guess. He stuck it in with Ginny’s books when we saw you at Flourish and Blotts, do you remember?” Jaw clenched, skin crawling, Draco merely nodded. He’d always known the Dark Lord was psychotic, but this… “Right, well … a piece of his soul was in it. It possessed Ginny, she brought it down here, I came after her. It was using her for … I don’t know, her life force. What I saw, what I spoke to, it was kind of like a memory. He was sixteen. Using her as bait to get to me and to bring himself back to life.”
With a great huff, Malfoy pulled his wand out of his robes and, with a rather lot of attitude, waved it and said the incantation.
“Darling, let me tell you something very, very important.” She stood up from her chair and lowered herself in front of his, something that brought him immediately back to his childhood. Whenever he’d been in trouble with his father, done something seemingly harmless which had earned him a spanking or a smack across the face, his mother had always come to find him much later, when his father was locked away in his study with his mind a million miles away. Draco had almost always been sitting at his desk and scribbling away in a diary, and his mother would kneel beside his chair, and take his hands, and implore him to remember how much Mummy and Daddy loved him, even when he got in trouble.
“Suck me first,” I hiss back. “Make it good, or I’ll never set foot in this disgusting heap of junk again.”
Draco looked into Harry’s eyes and smiled. “It’s all right. You’re going to be fine. Someone hit you with a Paralyticus curse. It paralyzes the body and blocks any magical means of resuscitation or detecting life. It’s like an Imperius that mimics death. I know how to reverse it, but it’ll take some time to work. Fucking hell, you could have been buried alive! This is seriously dark magic. Who the hell did this to you? Never mind, never mind! I’ll find out later.”
He rubbed at the ropey line through his robes. “Is it wrong that I don’t hate you for that?” he whispered. “I thought it was hideous when it happened, and I was pissed off that you’d scarred me, but now … I look at it in the mirror … and I see you. It’s like this weird connection between us. We were both forced to do things we didn’t really want to do, and we both came out on the other side completely different than we went in. We both survived.”
Draco looked up at Potter’s placid face, and another lurch of regret gripped his insides. He didn’t want to be wanted by just anyone. He’d been holding out for the one person who might understand him and what he’d been through.
That wasn’t really better; he was still talking to himself. But he often talked to himself while working, so that didn’t concern him. The morgue could be a lonely place, and a person did what he could to fill the silence. Walter, who worked nights, could often be found bopping along to the wireless, humming under his breath as he cleaned and cataloged the bodies.
Having worked Curse Reversal for six months, Draco scanned the pages that followed for more clues, but he saw no further notes. Emergency always did the shoddiest paperwork. They claimed they were too busy, but those prima donnas just thought proper procedure beneath them.
And that was at least partially true. He wasn’t stalking Potter or plastering his image all over the walls of his flat; he just had a fictitious romance with a wizard who probably hated him.
When it’s over, I pull out and rest my forehead on the seat beside him. We’re both out of breath, and he clamps one hand around the back of my neck to keep me where I am.
He lunged for the bin attached to his supply cart and grasped its metal rim with one sweaty hand. Retching, he expected to see a repeat of his lunch, but nothing emerged except a wad of stringy mucus.
Pressing his fist to his mouth, Draco fought to maintain his composure, but the prickling behind his eyes proved too hot to withstand. Clutching his tender stomach, he doubled over in an attempt to smother the howl before anyone heard. But he needn’t have bothered. His throat had closed too tightly for any sound to emerge.
Except it couldn’t be anyone else. Only the savior of the wizarding world would dare leave the house with his hair looking like that. And those glasses—they hadn’t changed since Hogwarts. Draco would recognize them anywhere.
“Oh, bloody hell! Yeah, that’s great! I’ve never seen such a perfect fucking smile! Just sit tight, all right. I won’t be a minute.”
And it would explain why he’d been seen coming out of Hannibal’s, a gay Muggle club in London that drew a fair amount of BDSM devotees. Draco had almost fallen out of his chair when he’d seen the picture pulsating at the top right corner of Witch Weekly’s July ‘04 cover with the caption:
We near the end of the road, and Harry pulls his hand away from my thigh to shift and steer. The logical side of me is relieved, while my baser instincts claim disappointment. A couple more turns later, and we’re bumping along some heavily wooded “lane” (whatever it is, it isn’t a proper road), and then he eases into a deserted clearing. I’ve had enough. As soon as the car stops moving (and my head stops spinning), I intend to get out and Apparate home. This is insanity. Harry throws the car into park and starts grinning at me again, his hand falling right back to my thigh.
“I’m not moving,” Potter responded mildly, and he even had the audacity to lift his hands up beside his head in a gesture that was supposed to be suppliant, but on Potter it only managed to look chivalrous. “Malfoy, I swear I wasn't taking the piss when I ..." He broke off, looking tense. "I had no
“If you want to talk to somebody about it,” Harry began carefully, unsure of what Malfoy's reception might be to the idea of Mind Healing, “I could ask Hermione to help find —”
“Harry knows you’ve been watching him, you know,” she said suddenly. Draco turned wide eyes on her, feeling remarkably like he’d just been caught red-handed. Perhaps he had, in fact. Perhaps his staring hadn’t been quiet as sneaky as he’d have liked to believe.
"Yeah well we figured you being the Chosen One and all we'd reap the most reward from using you," said Ron with a shrug.
“Really, though, Potter,” he went on, moving to sit beside Harry where he’d taken his place at the edge of the tub again. With the colder weather, he’d abandoned his shorts and was wearing a pair of light blue, silk pyjama bottoms that he rolled up to his knees. “Can we start soon? I need enough time to practice before exams.”
It was Slughorn who had escorted him, because his mother had not been granted another day of freedom. Harry had not been permitted to join him either, and while a part of him
He tried to turn back away, but Harry grabbed his arm again and held him in place. There was a look in his eyes that turned Draco’s insides to liquid. It was dark with nascent understanding.
Draco drops his hands to the ground and digs his fingers into the soft earth. He can feel it under his nails. There’s more lightning and another cataclysmic roll of thunder and he opens his mouth and screams with it, shredding his lungs, tearing his throat. He draws in a gasping breath and does it again, without the thunder this time. The rain drenches him, saturates his clothes and his hair, and when he can’t scream anymore he tilts his head back and speaks whispered apologies to the heavens.
, I swear to god. ‘Mione told me that’s where it got its name, because of that laugh. People think they’re bad luck, but that’s because they don’t have the chance to see the rook’s real colours. It’s like … like they don’t care. The rooks, I mean. Like they’re laughing at everyone else, because they know something we don’t.”
“We’ll just be going to the hospital wing,” he said, and shot warning glances at both of his friends. With one last cautious look at Harry, he scarpered, disappearing around the nearest corner.
, yet different in some important ways. Foremost, he thought, was that he'd never felt so in love with anyone who'd ever fucked him before.
“He can’t help himself, Malfoy,” said Weasley grimly. “Injustice and slights against his friends make him completely irrational, he’s been like that since we were eleven. He’s not
"Go get McGonagall," he told the Friar without looking up, "I'm gonna take him to the hospital wing."
?” he repeated, and his voice had risen, making Harry’s teeth clench. This had been precisely the reaction he’d been avoiding. “You’re taking the piss, right? Any second now, you’re going to start laughing. Are Seamus and Dean hiding somewhere? In on the joke? I s'pose Hermione’s waiting downstairs to join in?”
when she finds out about this. Harry with a kid? You'll be lucky if you can pry it out of her hands once in a while."
There had been two other times Draco had stayed at Hogwarts over Christmas holidays: second year, when the Chamber of Secrets had been opened, and fourth year, for the Triwizard Tournament. Both of these things were linked inexorably to Potter, and it was with a sour taste in his mouth that Draco contemplated the castle’s silence.
This last put a startled look on Goyle's face, as if he hadn't expected anyone else to notice how frightfully skinny Draco was these days.
It had been more than a year. Sex hadn’t even been on his mind during most of that time, but as soon as they’d started kissing behind
About a dozen house-elves rushed up to them offering snacks, pressing cakes and biscuits into their hands, Harry laughing while Malfoy stood there and allowed himself to be weighed down with it.
“I fancy him —” Harry began, but his sentence fell short when Ron stood up from his bed, towering over Harry with his face splotchy-red and his chest heaving.
“Help me,” Draco says after a silent minute. The rain picks up a little, disturbing the surface of the lake and forcing Potter to raise his voice when he answers, “How?”
These perplexing thoughts had Harry in a contemplative and slightly sombre mood when Ron pulled him aside Saturday morning in the Gryffindor common room.
It was about an hour later that Ron and Hermione decided to go up to bed and Draco declared himself exhausted as well.
When he was studying with Granger, the matter of where they sat in the library ceased to be a problem. When he was alone, however — like now, because the Golden Trio had a lesson — Draco had taken to sitting in more obscure corners of the library to avoid either confrontation or blatant staring. The staring in particular, which had gotten ten times worse since his and Harry’s relationship had gone public.
“He lived in my house,” Malfoy went on once Harry had stopped chuckling, and the words made any trace of humour left die on his tongue. “Pansy, Blaise, Vince and Greg … all of them. They didn’t even
Draco, eyebrows furrowed, looked from the plate of food to Theo, who had sat down nearby and looked pleased with himself.
It was the Dementors who brought Draco’s father, looking frightfully pale and even more frightfully thin as he was led to the room. The guard took him to his chair on the other side of the table and then left again to stand outside with the others, a wolf Patronus separating them from the Dementors, who were waiting to return his father to his cell when they were done.
Draco thought about making a snarky comment, and then decided he didn’t much feel like it. Instead, in a low-pitched voice, he said, “It was more than okay, Potter.”
“And during my last physical they said they hadn’t really gotten anywhere, but they’re still working on it,” he finished, shrugging helplessly. “Mum … how did you find out? Was it Acacia Parkinson?”
“To talk to him,” he said tightly. As if this whole thing wasn’t bad enough, now he had to pass a test to get past Granger the bridge troll. “I thought he told you —”
That was when Harry walked in. Draco leaning back against his desk, eyes bright, laughing. And Adrian, a little bit too close, a hand on the edge of the desk and creeping closer. He wouldn’t have done anything — Draco was
“Malfoy,” he says in what is clearly supposed to be a tone of warning but comes out slightly strained instead.
When he’s finished, Dean removes the tray and all the scattered, ground-up weed on its surface and takes the joints, lighting them both and handing one off to Seamus so the rounds can begin again. Harry wonders vaguely how long it would take for the whole room to fill with smoke and eventually suffocate them.
all of Hogwarts gets their bloodthirsty claws on the information.” He paused, felt his hands trembling, and tried, unsuccessfully, to force away the anxious buildup of energy that was causing it. “I can’t deal with this right now. I can’t
Suddenly he could feel not only his father’s gaze but Harry’s on him as well. His palm was slick where it was pressed against Harry’s.
In September, Narcissa was released from Azkaban. Draco was spending the night with her at Andromeda's and had convinced Harry to do the same. In truth, he wasn't much looking forward to seeing Narcissa, but he hadn't said this to Draco. It was mostly that he was afraid to see her; he hadn't faced anyone who'd been in that clearing in more than a year (besides Hagrid, but that was far different) and he didn't like to think of the way that might trigger something.
been for a while before coming to Draco’s room, because it took him very little time to start up a punishing rhythm; he pulled out slowly, letting Draco feel every vein and ridge, and then slammed back in, wrenching feeble, whimpering noise out of Draco’s throat.
“You know I will.” Potter’s head was tipped back against the headboard, gazing pensively up at Draco. He wasn’t sure how long they sat that way, Draco drawing idle patterns on Potter’s much-darker skin while those green eyes stayed unwaveringly focused on him. The only sounds were that of their slow, whisky-scented breathing, and the occasional rustle against the sheets when Draco inevitably fidgeted. It was chilly with his shirt off, but Potter’s fingers felt soothing against his skin, and anyway, he was starting not to mind quite so much, being topless around Potter.
it. Being used like this by Potter, knowing he was quickly pulling him towards some invisible edge, it was like nothing Draco had ever experienced before with any of the other blokes he’d slept with.
“You’ve been incredibly brave, Draco,” Penbroke said softly. He dropped his gaze and squeezed his eyes shut, feeling the hot trickle of a tear roll down one cheek. “I’ve seen more than my fair share of witches and wizards come through here with any number of ailments and disfigurations, but what you’ve gone through these last five months has been a test of character not many people could have endured so gracefully. Before I say anything else, I want to make sure you know how far you’ve come, and how proud of you I am.”
“I hate to break it to you, Malfoy, but I don’t have any secret fetishes for Slytherin arse. Mostly it’s just yours.”
of it. He could feel that in it, feel Harry's hunger for him, and it was with a surge of emotion so poignant it was painful that he realised he could feel himself getting hard. That was what made him pull away finally. "We have to go see my mother," he whispered, barely more than a few inches from Harry's mouth.
“I’d really rather avoid having to find out either way.” Moving off of Draco, Harry fell onto his back with a sigh that sounded deeply content. Draco smiled to himself and curled into Harry’s side.
The cool air of his dungeon dormitory hit his wet pussy and made him gasp, but before he had time to really register the sensation, Harry was already on him again, slicing his tongue through Draco’s pussy and flicking at his swollen clit. Draco’s hips twitched and one hand grasped madly for Harry’s hair, but by then he was already kissing his way back up Draco’s chest, and suddenly there were fingers rubbing against him down there, slipping easily between his labia and dragging across his clenching hole.
It's very late on Sunday evening, just past eleven, when Draco glances up from a book he'd been engrossed in to find that it's just him and the trio in the common room. Potter looks up from a game of chess he's playing with Weasley as if he'd felt Draco looking, stares a moment, and looks away again. Draco's face heats up and he lowers his gaze back to his book harbouring under no delusions that he'll be able to find his concentration again.
a girl, Hermione. He keeps saying that, like I’ve forgotten. How could I forget? I mean, he … like you said, he’s really beautiful as a girl, but I haven’t —”
him to say anything. They didn’t want an apology, they didn’t want to hear him say he regretted it, or that he believed his father was better off locked up.
Instead of answering Harry leaned in and kissed him — Draco pulled away with a little gasp and looked around, wide-eyed, but Harry pulled him back in with a hand on the back of his neck. He was tense for a few seconds before relaxing into it, his free hand lifting to skim his fingers lightly along the line of Harry's jaw. He was just beginning to work Draco's mouth open and get his tongue inside when the portrait hole opened again, and suddenly he heard Ron's voice:
“Yes, sir. Sorry,” Harry said, but Draco looked over and saw that several glass vials near him had apparently exploded of their own volition, and he was yanking a shard out of his exposed forearm.
It’s on a cloudy evening with a prematurely dark sky that he goes out to the lake again for the first time in weeks. Potter makes an appearance not twenty minutes after he’s sat down in the grass and begun feeling pinprick raindrops on his face, as ominously omnipotent as ever.
"If you don't fuck me pretty soon, Potter," Draco started, moving his hand to Harry's stupid wild mane and tugging a bit at the back, but Harry cut him off before he could finish.
“You don’t have to watch,” Harry tells him, ripping his hand out of Draco’s grip to squeeze his thigh this time, delighted by the squawk of indignation.
He came a second time without even bothering to touch his cock, because he just didn’t fucking need it. His body thrummed and vibrated like a snapped rubber band while Harry coaxed him along his high and back down again. When he finally pulled his fingers out he leant forward over Draco’s back and kissed the side of his neck, then the corner of his jaw.
They took their drinks outside, Draco privately hoping the cool autumn air would lower his body temperature a little bit (Harry’s shameless idiocy always, unfailingly, made him hot under the collar, he didn’t for the life of him know why), and no sooner had Harry pulled out a cigarette than he’d stuck it absent-mindedly in his mouth the wrong way and lit the filter.
When it was over, Harry’s come dripping messily out of his sore cunt, Draco simply lay there, boneless, stretched out naked across Harry’s bed, enveloped in the smell of him that was so pervasive here, and let himself be consumed by it. Harry Vanished the mess before pulling the hangings mostly closed around them and gathering Draco up in his arms.
he is. It’s just … the only part he ever showed us. There’s something else there, really deep down, that I’m trying to find.”
“Not to murder you in your sleep every time you steal the covers,” Draco says. “Since I quite like you, actually.”
He fell silent, thumb smoothing over the soft skin of Malfoy’s wrist while he watched his face, waiting for him to choose a memory. Harry let his eyes roam across that perfect, milky skin, across his high cheekbones, and thick lashes, and pink lips. There was a tiny scar just below Malfoy’s ear that he’d never noticed before; Harry burned with curiosity over how he’d gotten it. He was achingly beautiful, and it left Harry feeling a bit breathless.
to notice, isn’t it?” she laughed, eyes twinkling. It occurred suddenly to Harry the amount of observational prowess it required to be the sort of gossip queens Lavender and Parvati had always been. He wondered vaguely what kinds of wild secrets she had tucked away in her head about their peers. “Just watch him in the lessons we have with the Slytherins, his eyes nearly
like you did. I’m thinking now that … I don’t know, that maybe sometimes passion can be expressed in unexpected ways.” Hermione must have seen the utter bewilderment Harry was feeling written plainly on his face, because she continued carefully, “What I’m saying, Harry, is that you and Malfoy have always had a … an
Draco takes a seat on a sofa, and Harry, after some deliberation, sits next to him. Not too close, not enough to be presumptuous, but enough so Draco can sense how bad he feels. How guilty. How much he loves him, even after such a short time together. The thing is, it’s felt like ten years compressed into two months. They’ve fought and fucked and delved into each other’s minds, divulged secrets into each other’s mouths like whispered oaths; he feels sometimes as if he’s somehow reached right inside of Draco’s body and felt his living organs, caressed his fingertips along every muscle and artery and blood cell and unifying atom, learned the ridges of his lungs and the shape of his beating heart. He feels as if he knows Draco better than he’s ever known anybody in his life, better than he knows himself, maybe. And he thinks that Draco definitely knows him better than he knows himself. In two months they have become a part of one another.
"I don't care," said Goyle flatly. It felt a little like arguing with a troll, except some part of Harry couldn't help but admire how much unconditional loyalty Goyle had towards Draco. "You'll only make it worse."
“Well I haven’t. And you know, I’d bloody well appreciate it if you’d extend me the courtesy of being allowed to make my own sodding judgments. I mean, yeah, I think you look bang tidy in this body, but that’s got fuck all to do with the way I feel about you.”
Wrists screaming and starting to bruise, his ribs sore where he’d been thrown into the wall, Draco pulled the sleeves of his robes down further as he walked into the library, past Madam Pince, and spotted Pansy sitting at a table with Blaise. Tracey, Daphne, and Theo were at another table nearby. Theo’s head was bent over his parchment; Tracey and Daphne seemed to be gossiping in low voices.
Jaw clenched again, Draco looked away from Theo, feeling all over again the enormity of what Potter had done for him. He knew Theo must have been thinking about it too — it hadn’t been a secret that Lucius Malfoy’s sentence had been overturned thanks to the Chosen One. The part that remained a secret was
“Mm,” Harry hums against his throat, and he slides a hand over Draco’s thigh, squeezing. “I’m glad to hear it. Don’t mind me.”
wet, that was the thing — he could feel it making his knickers damp, something he’d begun to desensitise to the more often it happened. It was still utterly foreign, but far less terrifying and unimaginable than it had been that first long, agonising month.
harassment, anyway. He was still deliberately bumped into in corridors, mutterings and whispers continued to follow him most places he went, but Harry thought he seemed to be, if not learning how to
? The Malfoy name is as low as it gets these days; I knew he was fucking Potter and I intended to exploit that to save my father, you daft twats! You Gryffindors can never see past your own self-righteous morals, can you?”
“And he’s really witty,” Harry went on. “When it’s not being directed at you, you start to realize some of the things he says are actually quite funny. The best thing, though, I guess, is just … this way he has of being so cold and arrogant and unfeeling for the world, but lately, when it’s just us, when it’s just
written on it in careful script. And because he couldn’t tell by the look on Potter’s face alone whether or not he was open to the idea, Draco was forced to rely on blind hope. This was excruciating, because it was entirely possible he wouldn’t come.
Harry and Ron groaned simultaneously, and at least for the moment the subject of Malfoy and his new body stayed on the back-burner of Harry’s mind.
“Maybe I should go,” Granger said. She started gathering up her own notes until Draco stopped her with a fierce look.
"I knew it was you the way you said my name," says Potter, warming Draco's cheeks. "But mostly it was a thing you did with you hair, pushing it out of your face. You've been doing it since we were eleven, as soon as I saw it I knew for sure."
He lies there panting and limbless, and when Draco releases his bonds, his arms fall to his sides and he groans at the soreness of his muscles.
Potter stepped closer again, this time until he was able to slide his hands onto Draco’s waist, tugging him closer. Potter’s unique scent made Draco’s gut twist painfully.
go. Granger and I are studying, a concept that while utterly foreign to you should still be easy enough to respect.”
thing,” Draco told her, eyes darting to the door again. “I pulled him out of the common room. I was trying to get as much distance between us and Theo as I could when you spotted us in the entrance hall.”
Harry stared at him. There was an impossible stirring in his groin, and for a confused couple of seconds he tried to force himself to think about it objectively, just for the hell of it, as a concept, a concrete idea, fucking Draco Malfoy. He could see Malfoy watching him, frowning a little like he was trying to discern Harry's thoughts.
The unmistakable note of poutiness in Malfoy’s voice struck Harry in such a way that left him aching to get his mouth on every possible inch of pale skin. He walked over to him and slipped his arms around Malfoy’s small waist, pulling him close and catching his lips in a deep kiss that Malfoy melted into.
“Draco,” said Theo, standing up from the chair in which he’d been lounging with an unreadable gleam in his eyes. “I was wondering where you were.”
Draco, who had said nothing so far, merely nodded his acknowledgment. It was a clear attempt at engaging him in friendly conversation, perhaps because she was feeling guilty for having avoided him like everyone else until now, but if Harry knew anything about Draco it was that he would accept this very Slytherin form of apology in his own time.
“Go on, Malfoy, keep talking, I fucking dare you,” the Gryffindor boy spat out, looming closer, dull brown eyes gleaming with something that turned Draco’s stomach to ice. His pride wanted him to fight back, but it was Draco’s self-preservational instincts that kicked into high gear and made him decide on the spot to abandon his book and get the hell out of there. However, before he had a chance to put more than a foot of distance between himself and his attacker, the boy had grabbed his arm —
Harry pressed his lips together, torn between laughter and wanting to tell her to shut up before someone heard them and came down into the common room.
Curled up together under the duvet, bare naked and with perspiration drying on Harry’s back, he thought again of their trip to Godric’s Hollow.
Finally he pulled out (smiling at Malfoy's small whimper) and stuck two fingers in his mouth to wet them, then returned them to Malfoy's arse. He pushed in with both of them, a little less careful than he'd been before, and Malfoy seemed to like it because he closed his eyes again and whined low in his throat. Harry couldn't help himself — he leaned forwards and pressed his lips to Malfoy's neck, tasting its sweetness mixed with the tang of sweat and arousal.
After another few seconds of panting breaths and heaving chests and the rain beating the window, Harry starts laughing.
But in the middle of this sentence, Harry’s words broke off, for he’d been nearly slammed backwards by the force of Hermione flying into him. Her arms went around his neck, squeezing tight, and all Harry could do, all that made
“Well, Harry, I’d be lying if I said I’d seen this coming,” she said carefully, “but … I’d also be lying if I said it doesn’t make some sort of sense the longer I think about it.”
couldn’t believe he was beginning to cry, and then turned to Harry with an expression that was as cold and unforgiving as the winter winds that plagued Hogwarts in February. Harry’s stomach twisted, and he felt his throat tighten with another emotion he couldn’t identify. “You’ve had your look, Potter, would you mind
Was this supposed to be some sort of cosmic joke? Perhaps the universe was spiting him, Draco supposed, for what he’d said to Potter on the Astronomy Tower.
McGonagall gave a long speech that was at times sombre but ended on a hopeful note, and after a feast in the Great Hall that followed there was a student-organised party in the Gryffindor common room that lasted well into the night. With all the other students having left that morning on the train they managed to fit the entire graduating class and it was like nothing Harry had ever seen. At some point he found Seamus and Parvati snogging.
“Jesus, Potter,” he exhaled, a whiny quality to it that made Harry’s cock twitch in his hand. “What the
“Better?” says Harry drily. Draco’s jaw clenches and his eyes blaze. If he’d known how obvious he was, how clearly Harry could read all of his emotions on his face, maybe he would have gone to some trouble to take it down a notch. He tugs lightly at his bonds, testing them though he doesn’t plan to break them. He simply wants to determine whether he could if he wanted to. To his fascination, he’s not totally sure he could. They’re incredibly strong, which means there had been significant emotion behind the spell. “D’you feel like telling me what the fuck this is about yet?”
doesn’t have to choose between killing it or staying a bloody woman for nine more goddamn months. And
“I dunno what you thought you saw,” Harry bites out, tugging unconsciously at his ties, “but I wasn’t planning on fucking Jenkins. But it’s good to know you’re keeping a jealous eye on me at work, love.”
At some point Leo climbed off Harry's lap and waddled his way over to where Ron and Hermione were sitting on the sofa together, lifting his arms in front of Ron and saying, "Up." Ron was beaming when he lifted the little boy into his own lap. The way he'd taken to Leo over the last year had been one of the most amazing things Harry had ever seen, and he knew Hermione and Draco felt the same way. Ron could often be found explaining Quidditch to Leo and talking him through the names of famous players that Leo repeated but clearly meant nothing to him. Draco's mini Firebolt gift was used often, and Leo loved it.
“Hey,” Harry said, smiling brightly, and abandoned the last desk to go over to the blond and steal a kiss.
Draco looked positively startled as he watched Goyle steel himself and get up from his seat. He ambled over to Daphne, who looked at him apprehensively at first.
Ron and Hermione stayed back when they went to visit the manor afterwards. Draco knew why, and they didn't discuss it. He'd felt Harry tense when they approached the door, but he'd been adamant about coming. Maybe one day they'd be able to talk about it, but it wasn't now.
that speech, in fact — what little of it anybody remembered, anyway. “I just know that when he hit the floor of the Great Hall, you were holding my wand.”
She says, “Tell Kimball to go fuck himself,” in her groggy sleep voice, and Harry laughs as he’s pulling on his shirt.
"Draco," he says. His voice is deep, touching something in Draco that makes him feel like he's a dam about one second from bursting. He looks into those green eyes and thinks that maybe he's been insane to try and convince himself he could live without them. "Tell me what you're afraid is gonna happen."
The words shocked Harry so thoroughly that all he could do in response to this was blink owlishly at Ron, left speechless by his astonishment. His expression seemed to answer the question for him, though.
He pushed inside again, meeting much less muscle resistance this time, and Draco kept himself propped on his shaky elbows so he could watch Harry. Harry watched his cock disappearing over and over again into Draco for a minute before lifting his gaze and meeting Draco’s, then bending forwards and kissing him.
feel reverential. How could he not, after all? He’d never experienced sex the way he had with Harry just now, and he knew, deep down, that this had nothing at all to do with the body he currently occupied.
him that Draco comes to an understanding of how broken he'd been without it. It can't be healthy, to need someone this much, but god, he does. He needs Harry like he needs his wand, like he needs his arms and legs and his furiously beating heart. He's trembling with the weight of it, and he knows Harry can tell because of the way his hands move up Draco's back, sturdy and soothing.
Leo, Draco had insisted, because it was a constellation like his name and not only Harry's zodiac sign but the Gryffindor mascot.
Potter had sat up, no longer lounging back against the bedpost, and said carefully, “Never mind. I shouldn’t have said anything —”
It was almost entirely students tonight — all fourth-year and above — but there were Ministry officials dotted here and there as well, not to mention a couple witches and wizards who were clearly from the
“Relax, kitten.” Harry’s hand slid across his lower back, a soothing, warm, heavy presence that Draco nearly arched back into in spite of himself. “You seemed to be enjoying it well enough.” He leaned closer, and to everyone around them, it would merely look like Harry kissing his cheek, whispering something in his ear. Draco thought it severely unlikely any of them had even an inkling as to the kind of filth being crooned at him: “Don’t even think about going down to your room and putting knickers on before Defence, Draco. I want you dripping all over yourself through the lesson for me.”
"Draco." It was Harry's voice. Draco spun around and looked at him, seeing Harry's wide eyes and slightly pale face, and it was almost difficult to wrap his brain around the whole thing. Here they were, after a year of leading up to this, a year of learning one another and fighting and fucking and being terrified it could never last, not once this happened. Harry came over to him, eyes looking Draco up and down like he'd never seen anything like him before.
He was pretty confident Kenny wasn’t likely to start giving out details about “what he’d done,” as Harry had so cryptically alluded the other day, and with the real story contained to himself, Hermione, Kenny, and Malfoy, the issue should have been laid to rest.
“Good morning,” Draco says finally, when the silence stretches on too long, and he can no longer maintain eye contact.
He fell asleep in Harry’s arms, and it seemed not a moment later that he was being woken up again to Harry whispering in his ear.
Harry's stomach dropped and he turned to look at Draco in shock. His cheeks were flushed and his eyes were shining and he didn't look embarrassed in the least. He brought a hand to Draco's cheek and kissed him, first on the lips and then the cheek, back to his ear.
, irresponsible idea. It was lovesick madness to have believed Harry would react any differently. Teen pregnancies were taboo enough on their own when they happened to regular people with regular lives.
“I’ll get mine for you,” Granger offered quickly. She spared a last glance at Harry before hurrying from the room. Lips pursed into a flat line, Draco finally stood up and moved towards the door, deliberately keeping space between himself and Harry. He saw, peripherally, Harry and Weasley glance at each other, clearly having picked up on this.
Strangely, a quizzical look passed across Hermione’s face. Maybe nobody else would have noticed, but Harry could plainly see her start trying to put something together quickly in her head. This meant that either he hadn’t picked up on something obvious, or else he was missing an entire chunk of the story.
handle was examining his feelings, and he knew that if he was alone with Boy Wonder, it would be impossible to push them back down again like he’d been doing the past month of the holidays.
,” Hermione whispered fiercely, pulling away from him and pushing some hair out of her damp face. “You have nothing to be sorry about, Harry, not one bit. I didn’t mean to get so
Hermione shrugged. “I think maybe it affected his body's bone-structure and most likely that’s all it did. If Professor McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey saw fit to release him from the Infirmary and rejoin the rest of the school, it can hardly be anything permanent, anyway.
“Why do you need a reason for everything?” Potter’s voice was deep and scratchy-sounding, like he was just barely containing himself right now. The idea made Draco’s knees feel weak. “For some things in life there
Potter flipped Draco’s skirt back down and stood up from his chair, an annoyingly pleased grin on his face, mouth glistening obscenely. He skimmed his nose along Draco’s jaw, breathing hot against his neck, and for a few long minutes he didn’t say anything at all while Draco came down from his high. He dragged his lips in idle patterns across Draco’s skin, and when Draco’s breathing had returned to a semi-normal level, he kissed the corner of his mouth. Draco felt he could have died right then and been pretty much all right with that.
"I could do it myself if you like," she offered, making Draco's heart feel suddenly heavy. "The number of times I've cut the boys' hair!"
“Well, that’s good to hear, because one more comment like that and I’d have to check if you weren’t Professor Boothby Polyjuiced to
In lieu of an answer, Malfoy merely tucked his head beneath Harry’s chin and curled up against him. Harry laid an arm across Malfoy’s waist, pulling him close, deciding that was a better answer than any combination of words could ever have been.
. Seeing his parents’ house again was different in the daylight, without the fear of being seen and captured, and especially with Draco next to him, holding his hand. Draco had gone very quiet and pale, and when he’d seen the little sign pop up with messages from well-wishers, Harry had seen tears welling up in those usually cold grey eyes. It had been unexpectedly emotional, and in an unexpectedly wonderful way.
“I have a fantastic memory.” Potter raised an eyebrow, and then both hands were on the bench behind Draco, trapping him between them. “For instance, I remember that you looked almost exactly the way you do now last week when you thought I was going to kiss you in the supply cupboard.”
in a different-looking body, I dunno …” He shrugged and let out a humourless laugh. “I just wanna help, Malfoy. I know you think humans are incapable of doing things for other people without having ulterior motives and selfish intentions, but I swear to you, that's all I want. Even if that just means, you know, hanging out or whatever. Talking. I never offered to defend you because I thought you weren’t capable of doing it yourself, I offered because that’s what I would have done for anyone in your situation. This year is supposed to be about unity and forgiveness, right? Well, there’s nothing more unifying than helping an old enemy out in a sticky situation.”
him, Ron,” Harry said a bit awkwardly, shrugging his helplessness. Ron didn’t seem to process the words, however; his face was entirely blank, expressionless, impossible to read. Tentatively, Harry added, “I mean … I have feelings for him. We’ve been, er, meeting up in secret ever since he got hexed. At first I
attracted to him because of the way he looks, but …” Harry felt his voice die out, words tapering off as the implication behind them caught up with him. Hermione had an eyebrow raised, as though she was waiting for him to catch up.
“I was only going to say it would look nice with a skirt.” This was breathed into Draco’s ear, sending a chill down his spine. He swallowed hard and deliberately let his breath out slowly, trying to hide its unsteady quality, and knew he failed. Harry’s fingers toyed with the waistband of his pyjamas.
, was good to hear, but “alive and conscious” weren’t necessarily hopeful adjectives when the person in question had been absent from school for a week after being hexed in the back. He’d tried his hardest to wheedle more information out of her, but she’d sternly shooed him out of the Infirmary, thanking him again for having brought Malfoy to her in the first place and reminding him once again that that was where his involvement in the matter ceased.
Taking Malfoy’s (unnecessarily sarcastic) point, he leans back against the workstation with the pot on it and crosses his arms. He watches Malfoy finish washing and when he shuts it off, he turns back towards Harry, drying them on a very clean and soft-looking towel.
“I’ve always found that having someone to talk to helps.” Malfoy’s eyes rolled at this statement. “I’m actually quite a good listener, you know.”
information was contained between himself and the Golden Trio. And for as many things as he could say against Weasley and Granger, there was no part of him which believed either one would ever do something as horrible as snitch to his mother.
“Why aren’t you in class?” Draco demanded before Harry could say anything. He was determinedly wearing his most disapproving expression, although being able to feel the slick mess under his thighs and between his legs made it feel silly at best. He was grateful all over again for the school robes, which would cover not only the pleated skirt that covered hardly
“I …” Harry’s voice sounded strangled, he had lost colour, and his eyes were wild behind his glasses. “You … mine?” he stuttered. Teeth chattering now, Draco nodded. He wanted to stand up but didn’t think his legs would support him. They felt no more substantial that warm jelly. “You’re … you’re pregnant with ... with
But Harry didn't hear the rest of whatever the Friar was saying. He darted around the corner with his wand out and saw Malfoy on the ground, twitching and jerking and screaming, and a few feet away stood his tormentor, wand aloft, a crazed look on his face.
Potter leaned forward, and with his hand on that upper shelf, Draco felt effectively trapped beneath him. He was suddenly close enough that his warm breath drifted maddening across Draco’s cheek, and with a hard swallow and a lot of internal bracing, he turned his head just enough to meet Potter’s eyes. He wondered vaguely what Potter would do if he knew Draco’s cock was now stiff and aching.
He bottomed out and brought their mouths back together. It was everything he could do not to pull out and slam back into that tight channel of heat.
The sight of Malfoy spluttering incoherently was so satisfying it nearly made up for the destroyed flat that morning.
Draco had stood him up last night, and he wasn’t entirely certain how the hot-headed Gryffindor war hero was going to deal with that. Shouting, perhaps? A hex across the Great Hall? But no … even when Potter looked up and spotted him, the most he did was stare for a moment before returning to his food. This irked Draco in an unexpected way. It had been satisfying last night, knowing he was standing up the Golden Boy. To see this lack of a reaction, well … it negated that satisfaction quite a bit.
"You're ruminating," Harry says against his skin. He slides his hand over one of Harry's and scratches his nails lightly along the top. "You're still not sure."
“Angry?” she repeated, swelling indignantly even as she stroked a gentle thumb across his cheekbone. “Darling, I’m
He was silent when Slughorn escorted him back to Hogwarts — nothing more than Draco’s Head of House, Slughorn had not been told a thing, but had gathered from Draco’s face that the news was unpleasant at best. He tried to be comforting, but Draco shrugged it off with a blank face and numb limbs.
Perhaps it was time for a holiday. He could lose himself in a string of strangers who wouldn’t know who he was, fuck himself raw until he forgot all his foolish dreams of love and redemption. There would be no expectations or commitment. Just one and done—a new admirer every night. Someone to want him.
Even though he knew his fantasies weren’t real, he found comfort in them as if they were. He’d read that the brain didn’t really understand the difference, and Draco considered himself a prime example of someone taking advantage of “perceived reality.”
“Holy fuck!” Draco whispered into his palm. “What the hell did they do to you?” He staggered to the foot of the gurney and fumbled for the chart. Underneath all the scribbled procedural notes, someone had written:
Draco turned his head, side-eyeing the body, praying the man was just an uncanny look-alike, nothing more than a case of mistaken identity.
He had to be dreaming. That would explain why the atmosphere felt artificially compressed and why the silence had begun to throb with an ethereal, high-pitched hiss.
That desire had only become more complicated as he got older. Whoever said there was a fine line between love and hate had been more right than Draco could ever admit—at least out loud.
Draco touched his wand to Harry’s Auror robes and muttered a seam-splitting spell. His clothes might be needed for evidence, so Draco repeated the procedure and watched as they lost their shape and fell into pieces.
Draco’s lower lip began to tremble, and he had clamp his teeth together to make it stop. Brushing his thumb along Potter's forearm, he answered with his own squeeze, unable to speak with his jaw locked.
In what he could only describe as a fugue state, Draco began casting diagnostic charms on Potter’s body, robotically following the procedure he’d been taught while working Curse Reversals. Thoughts racing, a slew of possible curses, hexes, and jinxes fought for consideration, but he dismissed them quickly, knowing it had to be something obscure to have gotten past the healers upstairs.
A surge of rage began to build in Malfoy’s core, pent up anger at a world that sometimes seemed overly cruel. “It was wrong of me to want your forgiveness; that was greedy. You’ve already given more than anyone should be expected to give. I wish I could thank you for everything you’ve done for me. But that’s life, isn’t it? We never see how the things we do affect people in the long run.”
Draco’s hand went to his head, as if he could hold in his sanity. “It’s just an involuntary muscle spasm,” he whispered. “Stop scaring yourself.”
A stack of fresh towels had been left by the cupboard, and Draco grabbed one off the top. The cotton muffled his hysteria and helped stem the snotty tide pouring from his nose. Jesus, how he hated crying and the mess it left.
Draco stared, slightly horrified by the timing of the tic. He’d had dead bodies do all kinds of spooky things—wiggle their fingers, get an erection, moan at him—but to be blinked at after confessing his deepest secrets felt like a message from beyond the grave. “For instance, you’ll never know that I might never sleep again after seeing that.”
He paused and stared at the abrasion on Harry’s side. “It’s hard when you don’t know who you can trust. The whole time I was growing up, I could never tell if people really wanted me or something I had. Slytherins can put on a good show when they want to, and they have all kinds of reasons for the deception.” Draco smiled fondly and glanced up at Harry. “I can’t tell you how weird it is working with Hufflepuffs who go around saying and doing everything with absolutely no pretense. It’s actually a relief to know exactly where I stand with them—even if they hate me.”
His laugh sickens me, and I’m already sick enough. My stomach rolls as he makes the center of the road his own personal lane (the only consolation being we’re no longer inches from careening off the edge of the pavement).
. “Now that I think about it, we’re kind of alike in other ways, too. We both took jobs that involve public service, we both despise dark wizards, we’re both targeted by the press—for entirely different reasons, mind you.” He broke into a grin. “And we both secretly send money to Granger’s Help the House-Elves Fund. I saw you sneaking in that cheque at the last charity ball.”
After he cleaned up his face, he spent some time staring at the supply cabinet, his back to the body. He felt absolutely insane talking to a dead man, but at the same time if felt good to finally get everything off his chest. Words had power, even if no one else heard them, and he knew he’d never get the chance again. It was the best he could do.
Several more seams pulled free, but Draco couldn’t stop destroying the sheet one stitch at a time. “I thought it would be easier to tell you how I felt now that you can’t reject me, but honestly, it’s still nerve-wracking. I’ve never even admitted it out loud to myself. I guess I thought that would make it easier to live with. And maybe it did, but … regret might actually be worse than humiliation. I should have said something while you were alive. There was so much I wanted to say. You’ll never know how much I wanted to thank you for pulling me out of the Fiendfyre.” The tears came faster then; Draco used his free hand to push them away, unwilling to give up his hold on the thread. “I’ll never get to tell you that you pretty much changed my life.”
Just when I think things can’t get any worse, Harry grins and turns the key. An obscene roar nearly deafens me. We’re backing out of the drive before I can object. Once in the street, Harry shifts gears, and we shoot off down the road, tires pealing sharply in my ears. I’m sure to have hearing damage.
Beneath the tears, Draco’s face burned with chagrin, knowing he was no better than the common mob. The memory of offering his hand to Potter on the train—and being denied—sprang into vivid detail, the embarrassment and hurt he’d felt in that moment just as fresh as the day it had happened. What hubris.
Harry Potter couldn’t die, not the Boy Who Lived. Living was right there in his title. And wasn’t that the rumor, that he’d survived death in the Forbidden Forest, that he’d come back to save them all?
Potter’s breath was warm but ragged, his lungs still partially immobilized by the curse. “Thank you,” he puffed.
Draco watched her for several moments, waiting for a crack in the façade, except that none came. Miracle of miracles, Pansy was apparently being genuine. For just a second, the idea of telling her about the pregnancy occurred to him, but he stifled the urge. He would tell her at some point, but not now.
Which was all well and good, except that seeing Goyle doing homework and studying and hanging around Hermione in the library seemed to have shaken the foundation of fear he'd spent so long instilling in the students of Hogwarts, who were becoming less and less wary of harassing Draco even when he was around. It was nothing physical (not since the Cruciatus incident), but Harry could see it in Draco's eyes and body language that the constant reminder of Azkaban, of his parents, of the Dark Mark and Voldemort and the war — it was still getting to him.
“Right …” Harry stole one last intoxicating kiss from that addictive mouth and finally let go of Malfoy’s hips. “I’ll see you some time tomorrow, then. When you’re least expecting it. Stay on your toes, Malfoy."
His mother nodded. “Pansy said something to her while she was home for the holidays. Don’t be angry with her, love … she was looking out for you.”
What would have happened, he wondered vaguely, if he hadn’t left? Or worse — if he hadn’t shoved Potter away? Might it have gone on even longer?
Draco’s insides froze. Panic began to make his brain feel cloudy and an animal instinct had him struggling against the large boy’s grip, his brain focused on nothing other than the need to escape this situation before it got to a place he didn’t even want to
“I was only going to say that I’d, you know, be happy to help you do some research if you wanted. And …” He paused, not sure how to go about saying the next part: “Well, I know people have been sort of …
“It’s Pansy,” Draco said. He stood up from his bed, pulled Harry’s jumper on over his bra, and went to the door. “She’s been harassing me all bloody day.”
“Blaise,” Draco said, more in an effort to distract himself than because he felt like having a conversation. Blaise made a noncommittal noise as he began transferring the flies into a mortar. “Have you noticed Pansy avoiding me since term started?”
He’d been in the library with Ginny, though they hadn’t really been studying. With her, it had always been about more than just their romantic or sexual relationship, and that was what he’d come to love so much about her. They could just talk — for hours on end they could seamlessly flow from one topic to another, from laughter to gossip to more serious topics; nothing between them had ever been uncomfortable, and for that Harry was eternally grateful. Ginny had only left when she’d told him she was supposed to be meeting up with her Herbology partner to check on their project in the greenhouse, and Harry had packed up all his books (none of which had been cracked) with the intention of grabbing his broom and hitting the Quidditch pitch for the first time all year. He’d recently been contemplating asking Madam Hooch for his spot back as captain, and if he
"Enjoyed yourself, have you?" says Draco in a slightly strained voice, pushing his fingers through his sweaty hair. Potter gives him a funny smile, eyebrows drawn together.
"Clearly he can do whatever the hell he likes," Draco snipes at her. She looks sad and exhausted and he feels a nauseating pang of guilt once again. Harry still hasn't said anything. He's just staring, brow slightly creased, as if he's trying to work something out. The only thing more unbearable than avoiding that heavy gaze, Draco thinks, would be meeting it. "Mind your fucking business, Weasley." And, turning to Hermione again, "We can go over that list this weekend. I'm leaving."
"Wait, Harry, wait," Draco said frantically, breathlessly, tugging at his hair just to get him to stop. Harry complied with a frown, fingers buried deep in Draco's arse, curled against that sensitive spot. "Please, I'm ... I want you to fuck me."
“Both,” Harry said smoothly after a moment, gaze unwavering where it was stuck on Malfoy’s. This answer seemed to startle Malfoy as much as his earlier question had. “I
His first tip-off that an invisible Harry had joined him was the ghostly movement of the chair next to his. Quill suspended above a sentence he’d been halfway through, Draco turned to look at it suspiciously. A moment later, the quill was plucked from his fingers and, seemingly of its own accord, spelled out “hi” on the corner of a page of Draco’s notes. Draco fought a smile furiously.
“Right, yeah,” said Adrian, taking it from him with shining eyes. “Well it was some bloke getting in pub fights, so …”
"Erm — yeah, right, me too." He tore his eyes away and cleared his throat. Simply for something to do, he reached for his previously abandoned mug of tea on the table, which had begun to go cold, and still he took a sip. "Bollocks McGonagall banned eighth-years from playing on house teams."
“That I’m gay, yes.” For the third or fourth time today, tears began dripping down Draco’s cheeks. His chest felt on the verge of simply collapsing in on his lungs, but he gathered courage from Harry’s presence beside him. “And as I said, he’s not my
Harry didn’t answer, and he didn’t need to. The look in his eyes was enough on its own. Draco swallowed arduously and looked away again; he couldn’t stand to see that doubt, that horrible scepticism.
Draco said nothing to this at first, merely observed Theo through slightly narrowed eyes, as impressed by this pronouncement as he was resentful of it.
that's it, that's the one." He slid it off the shelf and handed it to her, and Harry saw her smile up at him. "Thank you. I appreciate it."
Looking grim, Slughorn confirmed that Draco’s mother was indeed at the school because she had heard about the hex, although he claimed, with apologies, not to know how she had found out (not that he needed to hear it from anyone else — suddenly he knew perfectly
who Malfoy was. He’d known this whole time. He simply hadn’t heard Malfoy use that snobbish tone of voice or sound that infuriatingly haughty and obnoxious since they were sixteen years old, and it had startled him.
“An honour it is finally to speak to young Master Malfoy!” said Kreacher earnestly, creeping closer to the bed with a distinctly servile look in its round eyes. “Master is looking much healthier than last time Kreacher is seeing him!”
"D'you really think you're going to want to keep doing this after we leave here?" he asked. Taken aback, Harry lifted onto his elbows and gazed up at Draco with his brows drawn.
“Isn’t it obvious?” But when Harry gave her a dull look, she explained, “I wasn’t going to tell you that and get your hopes up when I thought for
“Careful… I mean, surely you realise with this one here,” he gestured at Draco. “You could absolutely
I couldn’t stop the laughter that bubbled up in my throat at that, and I had to agree with Harry for the moment; there was something almost comical about this entire situation.
“Well, I’ve been up at Hogwarts, but then I felt this pull to come back home… I hadn’t been able to find it before… someone here cast quite the spell.”
Draco allowed himself to be towed out, turning to give us all one last beseeching glance before the pair disappeared out the door.
“Harry,” he managed around another giggle. “Honestly, love, please, consider everything you know about me, my personality, how I operate….”
“I mean, Harry, honestly,” he chuckled a bit. “I feel as though you ought to be more concerned if you’d somehow ended up dating a man who’d spent nearly three years with someone and had felt absolutely nothing for him…”
It was a concoction of Hendrick’s gin, rose liqueur, jasmine syrup, pomegranate juice, fresh lemon juice, and raspberry
It was a tube of Jean-Paul Hévin’s dark chocolate-caramel spread that already had me salivating as I prepared my tartine, with just a smear of butter, a generous amount of the chocolate-caramel, all topped off with fresh raspberry jam.
Like, way unrelated, but someone tell me this isn't our dear Bill Weasely masquerading as an absolutely amazing Muggle dancer.
“Cause you’re a bastard,” I mumbled, still rubbing my face into his palm, mouth nipping gently along his palm and the side of his thumb.
He responded by grinding his arse back up into me, forcing my tongue in deeper, as though I minded. I allowed myself the pleasure of losing myself in eating him for a few minutes before pulling back, spreading him wide.
“You sound like a right nice bloke,” Tristan commented off-handedly, and I made sure the stupid oaf dropped his beer all over himself.
“I’m fine with literally kissing your arse and swallowing your cum, but borrowing a pair of pants? That’s where I draw the fucking line.”
I’ll admit I’d been a bit wary when Callum had first come home, excited at having toasted his own bread around the campfire, but two children later, I now placed full confidence in the teachers and my children near an open flame.
This sickening display of cute along with the complete lack of physical awareness all toddlers demonstrate (if I can’t see you, you can’t see me, right?) continued on endless repeat, and I could hear my squeal of delight echoing from Mum’s mobile every fifteen seconds or so.
I allowed myself a smirk in Draco’s direction and felt relief as the glacial coldness in Draco’s eyes began to thaw and he allowed himself a brief abashed chuckle and shifted his gaze to stare out at the hedge maze again.
Bessie paused then and glanced at me cautiously, as though realising she might be giving away a secret of Draco’s.
“And Mione’s always had a knack for conjuring warming spells,” I added, remembering the bright blue flames Hermione would conjure during our first year at Hogwarts to keep us warm.
I raised my glass to take a sip as I made my way over to the couch and sat down, waving my hand to signal to Potter that he should do the same.
“Brilliant, Potter,” he snapped, stormy eyes practically shooting icicles at me as I continued to stare up at him innocently. “Very astute.”
“Those are Teddy’s parents,” I explained to Micah, and she looked back at the photo with renewed interest, having met Teddy several times already.
White rice, pickled veg, and a steaming bowl of miso soup with several pieces of pork floating in it.
she was frowning somewhere beyond Harry’s and my head, as was everyone else on her side of the table.
“Do you think I overdressed a bit?” I asked nervously, stepping back and taking in both girls’ jeans and jumpers.
“Hello, darlings,” she sighed. “I’m so glad you invited me. Really needed a night out after the week I’ve had.”
“That’s incredible,” Draco breathed, one hand reaching out hesitantly as though he wanted to touch the scene playing out before him.
I looked down at him, sitting on the ground before me and once again, allowed my drunken brain to take control.
Reluctantly, I removed my mouth from his arse and slid three fingers back in, noting that Potter’s eyes were practically rolling back up into his skull.
I hadn’t even realised I’d been cold, and the combination of the tea and the warming, savoury broth worked wonders to both relax me and pique my appetite.
Draco had been glancing over at Harry, hands still working to disentangle himself from Ben, when they stilled suddenly.
“Really, it was nothing,” I insisted, staring down at my empty pint, wondering if I’d be able to buy a second round and hope the conversation had passed by the time I got back.
“Dobby, take Draco to his rooms. He’s not able to join Mummy and Daddy for a proper lunch this afternoon.”
“I… just stubbed my toe,” he lied, eyes sliding shut as he lay back down, sliding his free hand down to tangle in my hair.
“Harry, dear,” she turned out of Draco’s embrace to fix me with a warm smile. “It really was such a pleasure catching up with you today.”
Because I’d have had to be dead or an idiot not to want more of that slick, warm mouth swallowing me down.
,” he countered, still feigning innocence, because Draco had known exactly what the fuck he’d been doing when he’d decided on the size of those damned things. “I believe we went with… ‘just right’.”
“Everything else, we could find easily enough at the supermarket or any Asian market back in London.”
He groaned and pulled back, ignoring my noise of protest, as he sank back to settle himself in my lap, still focusing on slowly releasing each button down the front of my shirt, leaning in to tease at my mouth with sweet, gentle kisses, tongue barely peeking out to lick softly at my top or bottom lip in what had to be the sweetest agony anyone on this fucking planet had ever experienced.
Department Head Bones took her seat, and I was about to take my place beside her when Draco reached out and grabbed my arm, pulling me back towards him.
He continued to drag those wicked fingers along that spot on every thrust and I was, literally, panting and screaming with need.
“I take it none of you has eaten breakfast yet?” she added, looking at us over her shoulder as she emptied the sausages into the pan.
His grey-blue eyes were still a tad unfocused from sleep, his hair was a rumpled, adorable mess and I suddenly felt very privileged to be amongst those who’d ever seen Draco like this, still tousled and soft from sleep when he’d first woke up.
“Sorry,” I added, trying to smile at Williams, but failing as he popped another bite of sandwich in his mouth and my face twitched in dislike again.
“You know exactly why we first met up,” I reasoned, brain thinking quickly because Draco’s eyes were still glaring at me fiercely.
“Pulling blokes,” Ron answered for me, smirking. “Then complaining they don’t measure up to his standards.”
His gaze narrowed, then widened as recognition set in and he continued to stare at us with a frankly disconcerting, almost gleeful stare, the wide grin spreading across his face only making him look a bit mad.
“A walk through the park to work up our appetite again,” I replied, beginning to pack up our picnic.
“I’m not sure if it’s one of those olives or your mouth that I want, Malfoy, but I’m about to help myself to something from that side of the table.”
“Harry?” I questioned again, and he sighed quietly, lifting his lips to my own, pressing soft, little kitten kisses to my mouth.
“It’s wonderful to see you,” he continued as I stood and turned to face him, smiling even as I felt the tears prickling behind my eyes.
And, as Hermione had pointed out, with Harry becoming a more permanent fixture in my life, also seemed destined to become my new signature style.
“Your Uncle Draco’s told me you’re quite the flyer,” Harry tried again, smiling. “Maybe we can go for a little fly later tonight?”
“I’m really glad you agreed to meet me for a pint, Harry,” he told me earnestly, and I couldn’t help but smile back.
, he licked a long, slow path up my cock, stopping every once in a while to suck and gather the pre-cum that was dripping down the shaft, eyes sliding shut, a throaty moan adding to the sensation.
“You have an invisibility cloak?” I demanded, still not moving to close the gap between us and Potter’s face finally showed that he’d registered my upset.
“I work with Blaise,” I added, figuring Ben probably knew Blaise. “And this is my wife, Hermione, and my sister Ginny and her partner, Micah.”
“Wow,” I sighed again, trying to imagine what it would have been like to have someone like that as a school headmaster.
Harry will spend at least three-quarters of the evening snuggled against Draco’s side. Under or over.
Harry immediately set his bowl of eggs aside, completely forgotten, as he reached excitedly for one of the flaky, square morsels, tearing it in half and dunking it into his cappuccino.
And, despite his earlier chiding for shedding tears, Fred’s face fell and his smile faltered as he stared at his brother.
Harry had already let on that his Muggle family had been less than keen on him being a wizard, but surely he was being dramatic about no photos existing.
“My two favourite customers,” he exclaimed, clasping them both in a quick hug. “What is it I can do for you today? New glamours that need to know what wand would suit them best?”
A clockwise turn to call Fire’s passion, energy, and protection — a wall of flames springing up around us, slowly extinguishing around the perimeter until just one fiery pillar stood guard at the South.
Draco groaned, shutting his eyes and throwing his head back, almost in defeat, pulling at his bottom lip with his teeth.
Baby Harry in this photo was just a few months older than he had been in the last, and he was sitting upright in the middle of the reception, staring up at the adults before him, babbling and cooing.
Just for fun, I yanked one of the table lamps from its cord and heaved it across the reception, anticipating the crash as it connected with the wall.
“Let’s be serious, Harry, like there was ever any doubt which way I pulled.” His grin turned predatory, and he propped himself up on one elbow to leer at me comically.
to the exquisite torture of every touch of his hands and stroke of his tongue ghosting themselves across, around, and inside me on loop, as though I were being taunted and tended to by twenty Dracos for nearly two hours before he’d returned, only to watch, mesmerised, as I’d continued to writhe and beg on the mattress before him, finally declaring that he hadn’t known it was possible to be jealous of himself before cancelling the spell and taking over the ghostly ministrations himself.
“Is there anything you would like for me to arrange for you today?” he asked, standing and looking at me expectantly.
“Sorry,” he muttered, “I just… I guess I just assumed that you had…” he broke off and looked at me helplessly.
Potter stared at me, confused. I was sure he had no recollection of me asking when he’d realised he was a cock-whore.
“Harry, love,” he sighed, pressing a kiss against my temple before releasing me and cupping my face in his hands once more.
All from the master chocolatier Jean-Paul Hévin, and I couldn’t help but feel especially lucky with Pierre-Yves, knowing that he’d gone and searched these out after learning both Harry’s and my preferences this morning.
The Ministry had decided that the motive was self-serving and that the attacks on Gringott’s and Shacklebot were an indicator that the entire thing had blown up into something larger than the perpetrator could control.
“I have face wash back home,” I assured him, reaching out to grab his hands and pull him closer, wrapping his hands around my waist, hoping he wasn’t about to work himself into an apoplectic wreck. “I even have moisturiser. With SPF.”
“Couldn’t find a big enough ego, either, apparently,” I shot back, turning my attention to the little slatted screen that I had thought was just part of the wall.
“The dangers of pulling a wizard,” I conceded, nodding in mock-seriousness, earning me another glare from Harry.
“Ah, I don’t think it’s anything too serious, yet,” I assured her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders and drawing her closer. “Just fun to tease Pans about.”
“Draco,” I managed, staring up at him as his own clothing disappeared and he crawled up the mattress, mouth seeking mine desperately.
We passed by a leafy park full of children playing and couldn’t help but grin and imagine both Blaise and Anaïs’ and Bill and Fleur’s children playing here before we crossed another large intersection, continuing down another little street, me still gazing upwards with rapt attention, taking in the stone buildings with their wrought-iron balconies and slate-blue roof tiles.
“I know exactly what I want,” he replied, sitting up a little straighter and smiling at me with almost the same proud smile Hugo used when he’d accomplished a new feat of magic.
“A bit jarring?” I asked with a grin. “I remember the first time I walked into a potions classroom. All the cauldrons bubbling… looks exactly like what you’d imagine a
His brows shot up in surprise over his teacup, and he was grinning again when he set it back in its saucer.
flashier than what all them Muggle gentlemen wore to the movies, but I liked it and didn’t see what was
Harry, like the habit-forming drug he was, continued to moan and press closer and all but surround me with him so there was absolutely no way I could have escaped.
“Is that a baby Longbottom?” he demanded, moving towards the couple and their young daughter with a look of absolute glee on his face, brows raising and smile widening as though he were addressing the young tyke herself.
Harry’s gaze hardened as he tried to straighten up, clearly not happy with what Hermione had just revealed.
by the gorgeous mosaic floors, the handsome wood details, and the soaring glass ceilings — and Harry and I poked about in a few shops as we meandered through the elegant passage before exiting onto the rue de la Banque, heading north and taking a left towards the Place de la Bourse then rejoining the rue Vivienne, Harry taking in the typical Parisian architecture along the way.
nervous. Like, what if I absolutely hate it, or feel like I might be sick and then have to run for the toilettes, or offend the sushi chef for hating it?”
And maybe it had been mostly my subconscious whispering to my drunken self that I had to keep touching him to make sure he was still there — that he was still mine and I was still his.
Once back in our room, I began to get ready for bed, but Harry, apparently, had very different ideas.
I couldn’t help but wonder if he’d actually just tucked his shirt in at random or if he were, perhaps, more like Draco, and had taken five or ten minutes to get the “look” right.
“What do I even pack?” I wondered, stumbling down the hallway, turning to give Draco a questioning glance.
“Because,” Malfoy said, filling his glass once more. “That’s what Grindr’s all about. It’s finding a hook-up, for just the night.”
“But nice,” she added, raising her teacup to her mouth with both hands, as she always did, which I still found to be adorable.
I allowed myself another nip at Harry’s earlobe before sliding back down, wrapping my mouth around Harry once more.
, Draco,” he sobbed, finally giving in and settling himself above me, hips rolling as my tongue withdrew from his body so that I was licking greedily and sloppily along his entire crack, from the top, along his sweet pucker, over the sensitive patch just beyond, all the way up to his bollocks, before his hips changed direction and I was allowed the entire process in reverse.
“I most certainly do not support anyone stupid enough to follow a dead, megalomaniac, madman,” I soothed, lowering myself so that I could watch my fingers being swallowed by that mesmerising pink pucker more closely.
, you devious, conniving, positively beautiful human, and when you finally let that stupid Southie brute cum, it sounded so spectacular, I’m still not sure where I’d like to be in this
“He looks like a model, straight out of a bloody magazine these days, not all pointy and rat-like, like how he was at school.”
“Oh, well, erm. I don’t really live there anymore,” Harry explained, looking away from Dudley to glance cautiously at the blond man.
“Is that whiskey you’re having?” Malik asked, his eyes sparkling with interest at the amber liquid in Draco’s glass. “I’ll take one neat, please.”
“How your back arches,” I continued, still working, drinking in the groans from Harry as he, presumably, followed my instructions.
“He’s my cousin,” Harry continued. “My Aunt and Uncle hated anything to do with magic and he was their spoilt son who got away with everything.”
I mean, I’d known since the first time we’d fucked that the obvious spot where neck meets collarbone was
“But when you went to reverse it,” Draco continued hesitantly. “Did they… did they recognise you at all, you think? Before you
“And… whatever it was that you’d made, no matter, but Hermione said ‘Wow, do you know what would go great with this? Some avocado!”
I still worked there, and Malik and I had just bought our first flat together a year ago, literally across the street from the pub.
and grinned over at us, introducing himself as Ron, and a memory clicked into place of Harry reluctantly leaving his schoolmates behind each summer when we came to collect him at the train station.
“Seriously Potter,” I snickered. “You moaned so loudly whenever it was served, all of Hogwarts knew exactly how much you loved it.”
“Shh, stop talking nonsense,” Draco scolded, smacking my arse just hard enough for there to be a little sting and make me gasp.
Harry nodded again, smiling up at me happily, then turned, practically running back to his parents and their two friends with all the eagerness of a puppy making a beeline for its favourite human.
I closed my eyes and could almost taste the gooey egg yolks running over the crispy bacon and generous spread of avocado that could chase the deadliest of post-night-out maladies away.
“How much I just love staring at that lovely, blushing pout of yours,” I continued, ignoring Harry’s jibe.
I groaned as his mouth found mine, nipping at my bottom lip, tongue sliding in just to dart away again.
“I’m a right mess,” he admitted, stretching out along the entire couch, tossing an arm over his eyes.
I reached up and shoved two of my fingers into his mouth, groaning at how eagerly he sucked them in and at how my brain instantly threw me a visual of Potter being fucked by a cock on one end and swallowing another greedily at the other.
“For what?” I asked, pressing back, feeling the teasing bulge in his trousers, already knowing it would be far too long before I’d feel it slide deep inside me, and I groaned a little, my breath hitching at the anticipation already.
“My personal favourite was when we made a rhyme just before the Christmas holiday,” Blaise had to pause again around another fit of laughter.
Hermione looked equally distressed and reached out a hand to pat Ron gently on the back while Pansy had her pint paused halfway to her mouth, a look of concern on her face.
“Took you two long enough,” Draco huffed, deftly grabbing the flute of champagne from my grasp and taking a sip. “I thought I was going to
"His family were… on the opposite side during the war, and I was… kind of leading the good side, so, erm… you know. Not the best formula for a friendship.”
But, as Malfoy had so eloquently pointed out, I was wrecked beyond caring what I sounded like so long as he didn’t fucking stop.
Potter continued to fuck himself, up and down my entire length. One. Two. Three more excruciatingly slow slides before I grabbed those damned hips to stop him.
George was now making a big show of draping an arm around Pansy’s shoulders and she snuggling into his side, and Charlie shrugged.
“My theory involves an old classmate. From Hogwarts,” she clarified, as though we had attended more than one school together.
“I assume a redirect charm redirects my thoughts so I’m not asking questions you can’t answer?” I asked, watching as Draco measured out a few drops of the liquid into the potion.
charm lest the tables near us wonder what we were talking about. “I knew they would assume it was you. You were set to play them that weekend, after all.”
was much nicer in the spring and summer, so I led Harry down to the riverside, where there were other couples enjoying the relatively mild Parisian winter day.
Harry had then remained in Edinburgh all of Sunday because he’d made plans to have Sunday lunch with Oliver Wood and his family weeks ago, and, while he, apparently, felt fine standing up the Weasleys to laze around in bed with me post-shag, the Woods were another matter.
my first instinct was to say large, because,” he shrugged and pulled an exaggerated “you-know-what-I-mean
I latched on to his mouth again as I pressed in, just to the first knuckle, before withdrawing, Kitten mewling and scrabbling at me in protest, as I pressed in again, this time allowing my lube-slicked digit to slide in halfway before withdrawing again.
I watched, mesmerised, as he plucked at his left nipple, back arching off the bed, a quiet moan escaping his mouth, while his other hand reached down, fingertips barely touching his cock, trailing up and down lightly.
Next second my entire body was stinging from the effects of a stinging jinx, and I shoved at Draco half-heartedly.
I was barely conscious of my hands roaming Harry’s body, first kneading and squeezing his luscious arse as I groaned into him, then smoothing up his torso to tweak at his nipples, groaning again as one of his hands twined with mine to twist and tease at the hardening nub.
“Mum, no,” Dudley groaned, putting his teacup down and rubbing at his eyes. “You spoil them rotten. It’s too much.”
On the contrary, all three were sweet, delightfully silly, and socially adept in a way Harry and I could never have been, given our sorry excuse of an upbringing — and I again thanked whatever deities that we’d both managed to overcome said upbringing and seemed to both be living our best lives, happily in love and surrounded by a great group of mates.
“That’s why I thought it best to talk about little Teddy. I know he absolutely adores the boy, and with it being his first week at Hogwarts…”
“I’m so fucking happy to see you, I don’t even care,” Harry declared, righting himself and turning to grin at the man.
We stayed like that for a few moments, tongues tangling languidly, hips rocking gently against each other before Draco tore his mouth away.
“I wanted you to fuck me,” he explained again, sounding helpless as his head tilted up and back to glare at me accusingly.
she greeted me, stepping forward to grasp both my shoulders and kiss first one cheek then the other. “So pleased to meet you,” she continued, in what I now knew to be a very thick French accent.
“Hermione, Luv, your guess is as good as mine,” I sighed, wiping the crumbs up from my desk and looking her in the eye.

That exquisite mouth of his wrapped longingly around the head of my cock, tongue pressing at the sensitive joining of head and shaft.
“Oh! And our server’s a wizard! Recognised Harry and I, somehow…” he paused a beat to let us all laugh.
“No, silly,” I replied, smirking as I threaded my arms through the backpack straps. “What would be the point of walking it off if I carried you?”
“Well,” I murmured, eyes still on the entrance to the pub where Harry and this Tristan bloke had just exited. “I had no
“I’m sorry about the other night,” Tristan seemed to have recovered somewhat, and he turned to give me a look of chagrin. “I didn’t realise you two were… you know.”
“Because, there’s no damned way I could last hours with that damnable mouth of yours on me,” he sighed, hips rising slightly, almost hopefully and I couldn’t help but smirk up at him.
sure you were about to Apparate back home,” Ginny replied as Blaise appeared at Draco’s side, another bottle of champagne held up.
“Yes, but maybe on a different day,” Ginny replied. “Or just for my more advanced classes, so you two don’t terrify the first-years.”
“What was it they taught us at that silly school, again?” he mused, still pretending to think. “Something cautionary about waking dragons?”
1. I don't know if this needs to be explained or not, but Draco seeming a little less... dominating in his relationship with Ben, and thus Williams seeing him as more submissive, is because I figured he would have been a lot younger then and was a) maybe still figuring himself out and b) I like to think of Draco as someone who really enjoys giving his partner what they want/need from a relationship... like, ultimately, that's what gets him off, and Ben would (obviously) be very different from Harry so their relationship, even physically, would look very different from his one with Harry, and c) just further highlights how much of this is inside Williams' head and he's insane and he has no idea what Draco is actually like... he's just created this fantasy version of him in his mind for the past six years but doesn't actually know Draco outside of pining after him at work.
“I think he had a bit of a late night last night,” I informed Blaise, smiling sweetly as Draco shot me a murderous glare.
“I’m sorry,” I interrupted suddenly, face turning up in a sort of curious disgust as I focused in on the sandwich Williams was breaking a piece off of to bring to his mouth.
“I don’t know why you want to hurt me,” I sniffled, wiping the back of my hand across my nose, not even caring what I looked like or the fact that probably every Malfoy to have ever existed had just shuddered in their tombs, because had the reigning Lord Malfoy
The same reason why Dudley dreaded the obligatory visits for tea with Mum and Dad and didn’t like bringing his children there, although he, also, couldn’t explain why.
In it, a large telly showed what seemed to be a giant pitch, each end holding three large hoops that sort of looked like those wands you blew bubbles from as a kid.
“Mmm,” Harry agreed, flicking his wrist lazily and evaporating the mess from both our laps and my eyes widened.
hard and fast, his hands still exploring my back, my chest, everywhere, his hips snapping up to meet mine, moans spilling from both of our mouths, our motions becoming almost frantic.
“Potter, do I really need to explain to you why this would be a horrible idea?” he asked, lolling his head over to look at me pointedly.
“If I’m following correctly, Draco’s supposed to toss Harry aside for me or something, and then what?”
“Excellent, you’re here!” she exclaimed, rushing over to him excitedly. “That means the department's already aware.”
All three of them, even Callum, ran up to their parents with their little phials once they’d finished, and I couldn’t help but glance over at Draco, heart
Writing Instruments just outside the entryway to the alley, we busied ourselves with peering at the variety of scales and telescoped in the display of Wiseacre’s Wizarding Equipment.
Then I remembered I had a very keen Harry, looking as much like his teenaged Gryffindor self as he ever would, pressed up against a wall.
“What? Why? The fuck, Malfoy...” I groaned, only to groan even more loudly when I felt his tongue licking hungrily at my hole again.
“Well, blimey, Malfoy, I’ve got that, too,” Bill laughed, plucking another thin sliver of wood from his mouth.
“Is that why you’ve brought me here, Mr Malfoy?” I asked. “To be your naughty, little, paid trick for the evening?”
I wasted no further time stepping into the steaming spray myself, reaching for him, running my hands down over his pecs and around to caress his back and squeeze at his arse, his skin slippery from the water.
My musings were interrupted by Draco bursting through our office door, at 8:56, once again taking his seat across from me, unpacking his briefcase, eyes glancing up to mine momentarily.
“Malfoy!” I gasped, laughing along with the rest of them. “That face! You’re going to get your face stuck if you’re not careful!”
Of course, he hid it spectacularly. Had those walls of his built up, the exterior disdainful sneer nearly permanent and a plethora of snide comments always at the ready.
My throat was raw from moaning and crying out, not to mention swallowing around the black dildo as it slid entirely down my throat every few thrusts.
“How you take care of me,” he said, those bloody eyes of his staring straight at me like he knew exactly what his words and gaze were doing to my insides.
“Yes, darling,” Mum’s voice cut through the roar of laughter. “Molly, Andromeda, and I have been planning it for years.”
How helpless he’d felt and how he’d hoped to just bring the man a small bit of comfort before the Unspeakable had arrived to take the man away.
“Please,” Harry moaned, hips working his cock in and out of my mouth as I greedily continued to suck him down, hands still roaming to touch every available inch of skin I could reach.
“How so?” I also reached for another sandwich, selecting a prawn mayonnaise, and looked at him expectantly.
“I could ask you the same question,” Harry replied, grasping Draco’s hand and tugging at him once more.
How dare you, you ungrateful, unworthy…” Father trailed off and turned to sneer at me, my hand clutched tightly round Harry’s. “Now I know where our son gets it from. This
“Honestly, I want to tell you to do it because it’s the best decision you’ll ever make but at the same time tell you to run in the opposite direction because only a fool would willingly give up that much sleep for two screaming little monsters.”
“A very important decision,” I added, kissing him again, losing myself in this leisurely exploration of lips and tongue for a few moments.
Narcissa gave an actual giggle, and the camera turned towards Draco, seated on the floor, surrounded by what had to be at least fifteen different types of cheeses.
And, if I were being entirely honest, I was expecting an announcement from Hermione earlier, rather than later, in the year, thanks
He picked up the pace again, finally fucking me and allowing the dildo to follow his demanding pace into my arse.
Draco was going to absolutely make me pay for this, and Merlin only knew I deserved it half as much as I wanted it.
“Turns out, he was always on our side, but could conceal his mind and manipulate the minds of others so well, no one on Voldemort’s side ever questioned him… actually…”
He finally released the dildo with a pop, hands running up and down my thighs a few times as he pressed gentle kisses into my arse and across the tops of my thighs.
“Erm… Mione said Draco went home for lunch. And that this is the first time he’s ever eaten lunch at home?”
. Gods, please,” he begged, hips canting upwards, legs wrapping around my head so that he could get a better angle to fuck himself onto my tongue.
His grey-blue eyes seemed to be smiling down at me, and his mouth was also curved up in an actual smile, hand still continuing with its purposefully unsatisfying wank job.
“We went out for pints last night,” I blurted finally, and she nodded, dabbing some makeup onto her face
and any other words that flashed through my mind that I hoped would keep Draco fucking me absolutely senseless until I came all over his stupid, goddamned table.
“Malfoy-san, Potter-san, I apologise. I should have told you two not to dress up!” he called out by way of greeting.
“You can make it stop,” he sighed, arms pulling me close, his face burying itself in my neck, and I wished to fucking Merlin I understood what he was talking about.
on Pansy,” Draco assured me, smirking down at me, then making his way round the table to take the empty seat between Hermione and Ron.
“I know,” he replied, still kissing and pressing and threading his hands through my hair as though I hadn’t said a damned word.
1. I don't know why Harry and Draco arrive last, but I just liked the idea of them appearing and Draco's in full-work defence mode and casting spells? Maybe they apparated to the London flat for something or other first? Walked further away before apparating? Who knows... reader's choice, lol.
,” I suggested silkily, leaning down to brush his lips with my own, delighting in the way his eyes immediately slid shut and the way he leant forward, looking to deepen the kiss and chasing my lips with his own as I pulled away.
I would have thought him maybe a salesman, but they didn’t exactly go round door-to-door anymore these days.
His head dipped down to place a gentle kiss atop Harry’s head, although his eyes and signature smirk informed us all that he was relishing this moment all too well.
“You are both extremely powerful, wonderful wizards, in your own right,” he assured my younger two, taking their little hands in each of his
“I’m well aware, being his partner, and all, but,” Blaise turned his hazel gaze to Hermione, who was also giggling maniacally, “we all know Hermione’s as mature as they come, yet she’s over there giggling like a horny sixteen-year-old about to meet Alistair Fawley (Fawley was the newest wizarding pop sensation, taking the wizarding world by storm), so I’m inclined to overlook Ron’s emotional immaturity and agree that this
“Maybe we can fly the next time you come over,” Hugo said finally, the intimidation of Harry’s international fame having finally
He moved so that he was sitting beside me on the sofa and I turned so that I could study his face, more specifically, his mouth, at close range.
“Sirius!” Harry exclaimed, dropping my hand like a bloody hot potato and throwing his arms around the ghost that had just appeared, only to stumble straight through him.
made me laugh about being caught bent over the bannister overlooking the massive entry hall of Malfoy Manor.
“I’m supposed to be angry with you right now,” Harry was murmuring, and I could feel him grinning even though his face was currently buried in the crook of my neck.
My bravado fell away completely the moment he looked up at me, those goddamned eyes of his full of questioning and hurt because of course, Harry had no idea what the fuck was going on, and that was all my goddamned fault.
“I thought you might be a bit jealous, maybe,” I went on, as though he hadn’t made a sound, still working myself up and down my fingers at a steady pace, eyes slanting open to ensure that Draco was still watching with rapt attention.
He pulled back slightly, then began to tease, capturing first my bottom lip, then my top lip gently between his own, sucking gently, but not quite enough, alternating back and forth. Just tasting, teasing, tempting, and I whimpered.
“Harry,” he sighed again as I leaned down to nip gently at his neck, my hands now moving to his trousers.
“Close your eyes,” he instructed, pulling a wide, satiny band from the pocket of his pyjamas and running it slowly between his fingers.
Our picnic continued, both of us munching happily, the conversation following the mundane and lazy as we chewed.
He continued speaking with the receptionist in French, reaching out an arm to wrap around me, drawing me close and
Draco had followed shortly after me, his hips still moving, still sliding in and out of me, hands gripping my hips as I wrung every last drop from his spasming cock and he collapsed with a shudder, face collapsing between my shoulder blades, where he placed an absent-minded, sloppy, somehow tender, kiss.
He glanced back at me and said something completely unintelligible, but clearly meant to be his attempt at one of the many phrases on the wall.
Some alone time with Draco — somewhere where people didn’t know who we were — sounded like just the ticket.
But I remember him laughing gleefully, eyes glinting impishly as he would play pranks on Blaise and me, sometimes even going so far as to rifle casually through our minds, showing off his wandless magic and ability to do any number of hexes and charms without leaving so much as a trace.
“He will,” Draco insisted, still sounding very far away, and I would have bet several Galleons that he hadn’t even heard what I’d just said.
I paused my steps up towards the back row and glanced over at her and the sofa she was pointing at curiously.
His eyes dropped down to watch as I gently plucked it from his fingers, tongue gently brushing against them as I did so.
A statistic appeared stating that I had, apparently, spent seventy-eight per cent of the evening burrowed against Draco’s right side.
I averted my path to avoid the still-squawking bird and allowed my thoughts to stray, once more, to the events of this morning.
I still used my wand when I needed to do more powerful or precise magic, and sometimes just out of habit, like now, when I flicked it lazily towards the door to undo the locking and silencing charms.
Ron assured me, coming up behind me and slinging his arm around my shoulders as Hermione threw her arms around me and pulled me in for a tight hug.
I returned my one hand to card through his hair, the other settling at the small of his back, my mouth breaking from his to trail kisses down his neck, licking and sucking at the sensitive skin there.
“You should probably head back to your office,” I added, glancing at the clock on the wall. “We wouldn’t want our little Dragon getting suspicious of your own lunchtime whereabouts, now, would we?”
At one point, apparently because Potter had always been a show-off on a broom, Baby Harry lifted his hands up in a triumphant gesture before he gently toppled off the side and onto the grass, only to bounce softly and land on his bottom, one hand coming up to rub his head.
I shook my head, ignoring Draco's off-hand, most-likely unintended slight that it'd be a stretch anyone would try to put the Erised app on either my or Ron's mobile.
I’ll admit, it had been hot beyond belief when Harry had thrown me down on my bed that day, telling me exactly how I was going to pleasure him, and now, I suppose, I just wanted him to take that control once more.
“Like Leadenhall, for example,” I continued. “Basically a covered passage that gave people in the Victorian age shelter from the rain or a shortcut, and they lined it with shops and restaurants to lure them in.”
just as the boat came into view of the Eiffel Tower with its lights sparkling, and I don’t know what I enjoyed more — the positively deliciously creamy nougat of the dessert cut with the sharp tang of the raspberry and gingered caramel, or sweet Harry’s face as he tried
the leap and also try the sushi, while Draco and I ordered some of the fatty tuna, shrimp, ikura, salt-water eel, and, of course, uni, to round out our meal.
It was less than an hour before we’d finished stacking the firewood, explaining to Micah the significance of the ash and blackthorn woods that Bill and George had spent the morning seeking
I popped his prick out of my mouth and continued as though I didn’t have a delicious cock belonging to an utterly delicious man standing before me.
Draco grasped my hand and tugged me along towards the entry, our weekenders clutched in our hands, as we turned left onto the street.
Harry finally opened his mouth, and I gently nudged the biscuit into his mouth only to yelp in surprise as Harry’s teeth snapped down around my finger, not with his full force, but enough for me to drop the
“As are all of our mates,” Draco continued, glaring at us even more ferociously. “Because they’re insufferable, nosy bastards.”
And while I would still keep an eye on Alfie, the last few times we’d been camping, Callum and Violet had roasted their own marshmallows over the fire while Alice and I cleaned up after supper.
moment, then you let yourself come completely down, then build it up again,” he continued, as though this horrific-sounding explanation might ring a bell.
I flipped him over, rearranging the pillow beneath his hips, pushing his legs to bend up and open at the knee, staring down at the sight he made, spread out before me.
Well, those ran the gauntlet from adorable and endearing to positively smouldering, and, frankly, I’d been surprised breakfast had lasted as long as it had.
Seconds later, a tall glass floated its way towards Harry, who took it, albeit a tad apprehensively, and took a sip.
each word with a thrust in and out of those said few centimetres and Harry was a whimpering, begging pile of goo.
“I think you could do better,” he replied, hips thrusting lazily in time with my hand, and I chuckled.
“This is all fake,” I reminded him, gesturing at the flat, the pile of notebooks, the open window behind me.
“Well, they’ve both got very significant birthdays coming up this summer,” George reasoned, also ignoring Harry and Draco, who had switched their glares over to him.
into Slytherin where these sorts of rapid-fire, hidden-meaning conversations seemed to be commonplace.
He glanced back over at me and offered a small smile of apology, clearly not having understood what he was getting me into.
“I asked if you’d found a book you liked, Luv?” he asked again, staring very seriously into Alfie’s eyes, and I suspected that he was telling Alfie, with his mind, not to let on to the other man that he could read minds.
Aside from looking a bit haggard, Harry’s eyes were anxious and when he smiled, it didn’t quite reach his eyes.
“Why would I cook, anyway?” she continued, glaring at Blaise and Draco, who were still sniggering around their mouthfuls.
I’ll admit, I had been apprehensive when Harry had finally revealed his mystery man to me one weekend when I’d gone down to meet him in Edinburg for a match.
Also, thanks to EmmaGraceWinchester for the lovely idea to have Narcissa catch Draco having his way with Harry bent over the bannister overlooking the entry hall at the manor ;)
Toshio’s eyes remained focused on his tattoo, his finger still tracing along the path of the waves, the koi, and the cherry blossoms, looking to any casual observer as though he were still explaining the design.
“A child could have a wonderful talent for football, but you’d never know if you never signed him up for the local kiddie league….”
“So… you were married to someone you didn’t want to be married to, working a job you didn’t want to be working at…” Draco trailed off and gazed at me above the rim of his wineglass as he took a sip.
“But he keeps glancing this way is all,” he finished, leaning forward and resting his elbows on the table, earning him an undignified glance from both Draco and Blaise.
“What wizards have you been pulling?” I asked, distracted from our little game as I pondered this. “I always thought you pulled Muggles to stay in the closet.”
"It'll get worse if she tells everyone to stop picking on me." He brought his knees to his chest and wrapped his arms around them, looking heartbreakingly vulnerable. If he hadn't known perfectly well it was Malfoy he might have thought it was somebody Polyjuiced to look like him. "When Greg's around it's just the verbal taunts, I can deal with that —"
