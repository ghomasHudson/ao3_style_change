in a relationship.
Malfoy is staring up at me, his cheeks pink. I'm not really sure what to make of it, so I chalk it up to George teasing him. It would be ridiculous to think I brought the blush to his face. Then, I remember what I just told him.
"Fine, sir. The bees are doing well. I harvested more wood for you." She looks up at me with pale green eyes.
The child Harry bends over a flower patch in someone's yard. He picks a flower and straightens, his small fingers clutching the stem of a red lily.
My mouth falls open. She sits in the sand, her hair flowing around her. "Luna! When have I ever openly flirted with him at all?"
"That's fine. We can stop off there and I'll bring you to your mother after. I'll go send George back in."
"Harry, I don't care about that. I don't mind having Hermione as my healer at all." I smirk. "At least she is competent."
"Have you gone mad?" Ron demanded.
I quickly move to straddle his hips, conjuring lube and watching as his hand smears it over his erection. Gods, I can't remember the last time I was this aroused or eager to be fucked. I take his cock in my hand and guide him to my entrance.
Ron, red faced and standing closest to me, whirls around. I can't tell if the blush on his cheeks is embarrassment or anger from the fact that Blaise has George - who looks like he's just been snogged - pinned against a wall. Going by the way his wand is shaking in his hand, it's both.
"Potter is the embodiment of good. He wouldn't just let me die. His conscience wouldn't allow it." I try to sound indifferent, but Luna sees right through me.
I open up the door to see our little girls, black hair in identical braids and grey eyes bright. Maia looks ready to cry. I pick her up and hold her close.
He's definitely crying now. I can feel the shuddering gasps of his breath against my skin. It breaks my heart.
Harry smiles slightly.
"I… I don't know. Harry has an idea." I swallow hard. "He's trying to make me believe that him seeing my memories won't change anything between us."
He yelped as Malfoy bit him, his teeth sinking into his flesh. It hurt, but only for a moment. A warm feeling spread from the bite, filling Harry's body. He could feel Malfoy's magic. It was flowing from Malfoy into him and lighting him up. Harry felt like he was glowing too.
"I think I was five."
"Draco, how are you feeling? Should I call Hermione or Avery in? How is your heart?"
"Not exactly. I did consent… but, well, you'll see." He flicks his wand, looking nervous.
I head upstairs and find my owl, Hermod, sleeping on his perch in my study. He is so lazy, but I love him. He's a cinnamon colored barn owl with big dark eyes.
"It's okay, dear," a motherly voice says soothingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Look how well that turned out," he mutters.
fit. I've known that since third year when the wanker grabbed my broom while we were playing quidditch. I think I have a thing for quidditch players... but my heart has never reacted to his good looks before. This is still Malfoy. I don't like him. At all.
Someone is shaking me. Worried green eyes fill my vision. Harry. Warm arms wrap around my shoulders.
"Harry, I know you can't help being an oblivious idiot sometimes, but do you really think hearing all of that would make me want to be with you any less?" I ask, raising an eyebrow.
"Can you break it?"
"You're missing the point which is
Apparently, the cursed memory in my bedroom is directly linked to this one here.
"I know… but I really hate snakes now." He wraps an arm around me, as if trying to ground himself.
I look up at Harry tiredly. "Did you sleep at all?"
"I agree." Narcissa wipes her eyes. "Besides, I’m rather good at tracing magic. I can track down the people sending my son howlers. Lucius can help me."
"Yeah… maybe." I squeeze back and knock on the door.
"That is ludicrous. Your morality doesn't have anything to do with your sexuality," Draco fumes, folding his arms.
"Get us out of here!"
I feel sick suddenly. I recognize those scars now. Bill was hurt when I let Death Eaters into the school. Greyback clawed him. That was my fault.
There are only a few inches separating us when Potter yelps and steps back, his hand flying to the back of his neck.
"I don't see how those two things add up at all. Not that I've ever tried either, but I really can't see how any sort of lovemaking makes anyone less of a man." I kiss the top of Harry's head.
Ginny and I never got back together after the war. She started dating Luna the day I defeated Voldemort. It stung a bit, but I was happy for them. I still am. We were in the middle of searching for the dead and wounded, when Luna caught sight of Ginny. She ran right into her arms, making Ginny fall over, and then kissed her right in front of everyone. It was actually really sweet.
"Was that your first kiss?"
"Believe me, I'm not blasé. This just isn't new to me. I've already lived it. As a kid, I never understood why they hated me so much. It was lonely and awful."
I make us toast with fresh honey and tea. I'm hoping that it will be light enough that Draco will be able to eat it all. When I'm finished, I bring everything upstairs. The shower is running.
"I haven't seen you in ages! I thought for sure you wouldn't make it!"
I've woken up numerous times to find him with his head buried in a book, a quill and parchment taking notes next to him.
"What do you mean?"
"He's missing? How?" Ginny hisses, blanching.
If you liked this chapter, feel free to leave a comment! I love it when people say hi ♡♡♡
The great hall went silent. No one could believe Voldemort was really gone. The remaining death eaters surrendered.
"Was that before or after we kissed?" I ask quietly.
He turns to her and swallows audibly before pulling his wand out of his sleeve. With a wave, the chains release the girl and she slumps forward into his arms.
"Gods, Draco," I moan, pressing back against his fingers.
Or tries to at least. The memory doesn't want to form. It's blurry lights and muffled sounds. I glance at Draco, but he seems as confused as I am. Then, I remember the thick, almost solid strand of memory that Draco put in the pensieve.
"Potter…" I jump as I hear my name murmured from across the room. "Win… please. Save us."
"What I don't understand is how he managed to work around DAISIES." I glare at the paper on the desk. "He shouldn't be able to speak about me."
I look at the object she's given me. I've never seen anything like it before. It's a dark brown, almost black, stone. Something is glittering like stars across it.
"Draco is fine. He's just worn himself out," Luna says gently. "We brought him home to rest."
"What is going on?"
In the sunset, it almost seems like Potter is blushing. He certainly appears uncomfortable. He keeps rubbing the back of his neck and shifting his weight.
I glance at the clock. It's four in the morning. He's here six hours early. I study his face, not hiding the fact that I'm doing so. He has bags under his green eyes and he's pale.
"If he has gotten worse, we're going to the hospital," Hermione says grimly.
(See the end of the chapter for
I feel my cheeks heat. "I know. I don't know what came over me."
"I love you." Harry smiles, breaking the kiss. "Instead of an engagement, I have an idea of what we can do with this ring."
Harry straightened his back. He had a meeting with Death that he couldn't be late for.
I forgot she was here with how worried I was about him.
"What is this?"
"Really, Harry. You're the only person I know who would sleep in trousers," he huffs, finally loosening my belt.
"Not all abuse is physical. You know that. The Dursl-"
I've never used a pensieve before and it's a bit disconcerting because I know this is Harry's memory. Still, I look around. We're standing in the middle of a nice living room and it feels real.
"Be safe, Draco," Faye mumbles, her face turned in his direction. "Thank you for saving me."
She has a point. I can prescribe potions easily, but actually making them is another matter entirely.
Edit: please read the beginning author's note.
Hermod flies out the open window. I watch him go until I can't see him anymore.
Not able to hold it back any longer, I fill his mouth with my seed. Draco swallows and then sucks my cock clean before catching every last drop with his tongue, licking his own lips. I gaze at him, hardly able to breathe, transfixed by the picture before me. He looks so fucking hot when he does this. Knowing exactly what he does to me, Draco throws me a wink before slowly standing up, still panting. Nevertheless, he catches my lips in a filthy kiss, letting me taste myself on his lips.
I force myself to close my mouth. I look at my feet. "That's just it though. Malfoy may have changed, but we're still... we have only treated each other as enemies. It's a huge gamble to throw away what I have with Anthony on the chance something might work with Malfoy. Besides... Malfoy lives in seclusion. He wouldn't want to be all over the press for dating me."
I know he's not going to get dinner ready, so I go into the kitchen.
"How can you be sure?"
The second he notices I'm awake, Harry sits upright and cups my face in his hands - still holding the box.
"When I was at Hogwarts, the Carrows kept an eye on me. They reported every move I made to the Dark Lord. If I was caught talking to or associating with anyone who might be connected to the Order, they tortured me. It was hell. Every break I would go home and wonder if my parents were still alive. A few times, the Dark Lord or other Death Eaters tortured me all day long if they were in a bad mood. The only comfort I had was sneaking to the cellar to spend time with Luna."
"Tired... but better. Blaise said a woman named McHale saved me from cardiac arrest... and you kissed me?" He sounds so unsure of himself.
"What is wrong with my son?!"
All it took was seeing him defend Harry from his bitch of an ex.
"How? You can't just cast a spell, Harry."
if we aren't sure. He doesn't want to be disturbed… if it's not the Potter boy, he'll be angry."
Zabini looks dubious, but after Draco weakly shoves him, he gets up and follows Luna out of the room. I take his place on the bed beside Draco, helping him to sit up.  He leans against me.
Draco blinked and his eyes lost that silver glow. "Does it bother you having me for a mate?"
"The lighting is off." He hesitates. "No… everything is tinged with brown."
So I did. I clung to that thought and the fact that I'm hopelessly in love with him. The only person that knows about my feelings is Luna. I let it slip when I was visiting her in my cellar. Ginny probably knows as well come to think of it. I don't think Luna is capable of keeping a secret from her.
Seeing him shake, I catch him before he falls and hold him tightly. As the light fades, I notice that the colors in the room seem normal now. There's no sign of the smog or Nagini.
Hermione and Harry glance at each other. I can read the answer on their faces.
"Read this!"
"Well... when your blood came into contact with Malfoy's system..." She cleared her throat. "You said he looked beautiful when he was glowing, right?"
"I want to know exactly what is going on."
"Happy Mother's day," the chubby kid says, smacking a kiss on the woman's bony cheek.
Harry stared up at him blankly, feeling mildly rejected. He wanted to kiss him until their lips were bruised and chapped. He wanted to know how Draco felt under him... or over him. Either way worked fine for him.
"Yeah… what's next?" I ask, not looking away from the young boy.
His bedroom is the whole loft. A massive bed with purple and grey sheets is taking up a lot of the room. There are a couple armchairs and a desk. Books and art line the walls.
"I have to vacuum and mop again! Stay in your cupboard for the rest of the night!" she shrieks, opening a small door under the stairs and all but tossing her nephew inside.
Anthony looks ready to argue, so I walk away. Kreacher has made dinner and the kitchen is spotless. The house elf comes hurrying up to me.
I swallow. I can't bring myself to talk about this. Not with him. Not now. "No. Nothing whatsoever. Shut up and go to sleep."
"I don't know fully. It's something that is attacking my mind and heart. I came here to try to find more information."
"He really is free," she says through her tears. "He's finally free. My son."
"If you do, I'll forgive this. I'll let you come home right now and we can pretend none of this happened."
"I'm still not sure. I asked him if it was real, but he just said something like, 'just because it's happening in your head it doesn't make it any less real'. Something like that." Harry rolls his eyes. "I swear that man was barmy, but it made sense at that time."
"Oh, honestly! Shut up, Ron! This was inevitable after Malfoy bonded Harry." Hermione threw a throw pillow at her boyfriend. "All that matters is that Harry is happy."
"Draco is in the library. I assume my wife gave you her permission." Lucius points up the grand staircase. "Take a right on the first floor. It's the fourth door on the left."
"To them, none of that mattered. The fact that they're my family made them hate me more. They couldn't stand being related to a bunch of freaks." Harry glances at me. "I haven't seen that expression on your face since we were in school."
He tells me about when he first met Goldstein after school. How Goldstein brought him to an aquarium... how they grew close. Harry tells me that Goldstein was charming and kind at first.
"Because she asked me if you and I would go out with her a couple hours ago. Apparently, Zabini gave her a potion that forced her to ask out the person she liked most, but she likes both of us."
"You saved my life," I point out. "
I stare at him, feeling my heart ache. Has he been living with that weight on him this whole time? It's been five years since the war, but it seems like it just happened yesterday with the guilt written plainly on Draco's face.
Everyone who knows that we're dating has assured us that they won't say anything to anyone. The list is pretty small considering Draco kissed me in front of my coworkers and a couple visitors. Elliot insisted on erasing that small moment from their minds. It was dangerous to the health of his patient was the way Elliot put it.
He bit his tongue badly, which is where the blood is coming from. His body is sore from the curse. His heart though... it's grown worse. It's barely performing.
I know George too well to trust him not to eavesdrop. I cast a repelling charm to keep away any extendable ears. Then, I cast
"I'm trying to find the door," Harry called back.
Ron cuts off whatever Hermione is about to say. "Dinner is just about ready," he says, poking his head through the door.
"You're here to research the curse right?" Harry asks, glancing at the shelves of books surrounding us.
I carry Draco's limp body inside, exhaustion tugging at my eyes. A squeak comes from the direction of the house elf and Minty rushes to us.
Harry didn't pay any attention to Draco's struggling. He didn't even know where his mate was carrying him. He hadn't looked at the room Draco had summoned yet.
Draco smirked and kissed his forehead.
Luna listened to me explain about Draco as she worked on the potion. She didn't say anything, just frowned a bit.
The silence is broken only by Draco's breaths. As he regains control, his breathing quiets. If it wasn't for his hands fisting in my shirt, I would have thought he had fallen asleep.
"Well, what?" Harry asked.
"I'm fairly certain that's because I was malnourished and wearing Dudley's old clothes."
That surprises me. I always thought Draco hated me in school. I can think about that later. My priority is the man in my arms here and now.
Ginny has the decency to look ashamed. She runs her fingers through her ginger curls as she takes a deep breath.
"How much you what?" Harry prompted him when Draco fell silent.
This has been confirmed by various sources who wish to be unnamed. It is said that there were a lot of bitter altercations between the Gryffindor and the Slytherin - some even ending in blood or with broken bones. Can someone really fall in love after such a past?
"It's supposed to be my worst memories causing this, right?" Draco grimaces and shifts closer to me.
"It's your family."
With a start, I realize that I'm looking at Harry's family. The family he should have been raised in. Lily Potter kneels next to her son and wipes his tears away. James Potter hugs them both.
I believe him. I feel exhausted suddenly. I notice for the first time that the pain is gone. It has been for a few minutes.
He just won't kiss my mouth. I wish he would, but I understand there's a line right now that we can't cross. We can't be lovers until I'm healed. Granted... it feels like we are lovers already with all of the affection and time we spend together.
"I'm going back to the dorms. I need to study for our Charms exam tomorrow. See you at dinner."
"I forbid it! You're not going by yourself to her wedding!" Goldstein thunders.
If he survived that long, he would be.
Draco's arms slide around my neck. Pulling me closer to him, his lips find mine. I kiss him carefully, forcing myself to stay under control.
"I didn't know. I didn't know what he would do," he says weakly as Amycus turns to the other Draco.
Around them the battle had begun, McGonagall leading the way.
"These are the ones of Anthony, right?"
"This wasn't the first time I watched someone die… but it was awful. Before, all the deaths had been in duels or… Dumbledore. This wasn't like that. It was merciless and cold."
"Malfoy?!"
Draco's breaths stutter as I brush my thumbs over his nipples. "Merlin, yes."
Draco murmured something breathlessly, still moving at that slow torturous pace. Harry felt the hot coil of pleasure inside of him finally snap. Draco muffled his scream with his lips as thick ribbons of cum painted their stomachs and chests.
"I think I found it!"
I still hesitate, searching his wary eyes. Sighing, I finally hand him the
"I thought she sold her art?" Potter tilts his head.
"What task?" Hermione asked sharply.
"Faye, this is a blood replenishing potion. It will help you feel better." Unstoppering it, he puts it in her hands. "Drink it."
Harry catches it easily, reminding me of how he always beat me in quidditch. He hands me the treat. I think he knows I'm not eating well. I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Art by
Someone slaps me upside the head. I jerk up, my ear ringing from where Pansy hit me.
Ginny had one more quidditch match after the reception. Really, she shouldn't have had a game then, but the Wimbourne Wasps were disqualified at the last minute, moving the Holyhead Harpies up to face the Montrose Magpies.
dense," she criticized him quietly. "It's obviously Draco. You know? The guy you're in love with."
My mother loves Luna as if she were her own daughter. If Luna and I weren't both hopelessly gay, I'm sure my mother would have tried to arrange us to be married. She did try once, but Luna had hugged her and started calling her mother as well. Apparently, that was all my mother wanted. Now, Luna and I are like siblings.
"She said all she remembers is a man in a mask and black robes. He was average height and stocky... but she didn't recognize him."
Hermione shoots me an appraising look. I think I can almost see approval on her face, but she turns to Ron too quickly for me to be certain.
"You can't." Narcissa grabs my arm. "The manor is enchanted to keep anyone who isn't a Malfoy out. You can only get in if you have permission from someone in my family."
"She can't harm you anymore. She's an echo of a memory," I tell him firmly, praying I'm right.
Kreacher bows his head. I feel like an idiot. Even Kreacher could see what I didn't want to. "You're right. Ron talked sense into me earlier. I was so desperate for companionship that I let him get away with too much."
"I wasn't aware you were faking that." My father's eyes narrow.
I am never going to lose myself in someone else again. I'm never going to allow myself or Kreacher to be mistreated again.
Draco didn’t say anything to his arguments, but he also didn’t leave. He was still there, so hesitantly, Harry dared to ask, "If you don't hate me - which I don't sense coming off you - then why have you been avoiding me? Why the stoic act?” Shyly, he added, “I've been... worried about you."
"Well… I guess the first thing we need to do is warn Draco's parents. They can turn away any owls… or I'm sure someone can open the howlers in a way that won't disrupt your healing." I glance at Ginny. "Do you think Ron or George would be willing to open the howlers?"
I hear Harry murmur spells. A few moments later, he relaxes.
"Draco…" he breathed.
"Where is Potter?" I trust him to keep me safe at least.
"I'll keep him safe." Potter smiles kindly at Minty. "I give you my word."
"You have enough scars," Malfoy murmured. "I can't do anything about the older ones."
He doesn't answer. I check on him and find he's sleeping. That's good. He should rest until tomorrow at least.
A thick yellow puss starts leaking out of the envelope and I drop it in disgust. Vanishing the puss, I turn to Ron. He's gone from green to red again.
Thankfully, this potion doesn't need long to brew. It is already light blue, shimmering steam curling in the air above it. Once the steam turns yellow, it will be done.
"To protect us. If the death eaters or the Dark Lord found out about our bond... I don't want to think about how they might use me against you. They might use me to hurt you or lure you to them." Draco narrowed his eyes. "I can't keep you safe if they find out."
I feel my chin pull back. Ron is sitting with his hands braced on his crossed legs. He looks as uncomfortable as I feel.
If I was being honest, I would admit that even after reading about
"A few days ago. Before Crabbe tried to poison you." He rubs the back of his neck. "I thought you knew."
Draco's breath is cool against my lips. He's so close to me, I can see little flecks of green in the gray of his eyes. He pauses just before our lips touch.
"Bit confident that a bed would be needed," Harry teased, turning his face back to Draco.
Pink was rising in Draco's cheeks. "I think… it was the veela magic. I'm sorry."
With a wave of his wand, we're standing in a hallway I recognize. A young Draco is standing outside his father's study, his fist raised to knock. Raised voices are coming from the room.
The fight that followed wasn't what Harry expected it to be. He had expected more death. Bellatrix and Greyback were the only people he saw fall before he confronted Voldemort.
Ron rubs the back of his neck. "Uh, well... yeah. I think we've come to an understanding actually."
"Yes. Luke is watching for Anthony in the lobby. He will remove him if he shows up here." Elliot checks his clipboard. "You really need to do something about him. He can't keep turning up here like this. I hesitate to ban him from the premises... but I might have to if he keeps disrupting the place."
This time, I go alone. I'm a bit nervous approaching the gate of the manor. A small part of me is worried the wards won't let me through just like earlier. A larger part of me is worried Draco won't be there or he'll be- I shut down that train of thought.
Harry tore the page about veela out of the book, ignoring Hermione's squawk of protest, and left with his cloak and map.
"I'm fine. Lucius brought me coffee."
"You need to sleep."
Harry goes still. "You what?"
"That… that's fair. I was pretty spoiled and cruel," I acknowledge, feeling a little guilty. The whole time we went to school together, I made it my goal to make him and his friends miserable. I added to the hurt he had already experienced… and all because I was jealous and angry at him for snubbing my friendship. "I'm sorry. I didn't realize."
"I didn't... I didn't want to see pity in your eyes. I thought... you would think less of me. That I'm weak. That I'm not your equal. I didn't want you to see how big of mess I am."
"No more. No more fear. No more threats. My family is safe. Luna is safe and happy. Harry is alive. I love him more than ever. He defeated you and you can't hurt anyone ever again."
Taking another deep breath, I force myself to recall the week that the cursed memories took place so far. The Dark Lord and my aunt had been gone for most of it. I don't want to do this. Except… I have to swallow my fear.
I open my mouth, but Harry taps his finger against my lips.
"I love you. Haven't you ever been jealous before?" Goldstein has a look in his eyes that makes me feel uncomfortable. Like he thinks he won.
Harry taps the book with his wand. It falls open with a reluctant flutter of pages.
I stare at him, starting to doubt myself.
And with that, Hermione hurried out of the classroom.
If you liked this chapter, please consider leaving a comment. I love it when people say hi. ♡♡♡
"Well, it's not like you did it to hurt him." Ron shrugs. "I mean... the you I knew in school probably would have tried to get Harry fired, but this you.. you're more mature and nicer."
"Who?!" I demand impatiently.
We kick off the sandy floor and start swimming to shore. I swim faster than I usually do. I need to see him. I want to know if I really do have a chance with Potter.
I glance down at Luna who is smiling serenely at her wife. I should probably be angry or at least upset with Ginny for the things she said, but I'm not. Her words hadn't been said out of maliciousness. It was the opposite really.
Then, Draco jumped into the air. Flying must have been instinctive because Draco didn't seem to be having any problem with it.
I expect Harry to need to go to the hospital or summon the potion, but he just walks to the closest desk. His lime green healer robes are hanging over the chair.
I force myself to say the words that Pansy, Luna, and Ginny have repeated to me over and over during panic attacks. The constant reassurance that the war's over feels like a weapon now with the way I spit the words at the Dark Lord.
Given how close the start of your new relationship happened to your former, it begs the question: Did you cheat on your former boyfriend?
"You didn't allow it." I frown, pulling him down to kneel beside me. "You left him. You took steps to keep him away."
"Why don't you look happy? This is progress." Harry's arm slips around my shoulders.
"Thank you," I mumble.
Harry shrugged out of Ron's hold and glared. "This isn't like when you drank that love potion, Ron. I'm not about to confess my undying love for him. I'm just going to tell him what Hermione told me."
I hate to think of how my heart must have caused her to be late and interrupted her and Luna's time together.
"She what?!" he demanded, a strange mixture of horror and embarrassed pleasure on his face.
Harry grins and cups my face in his hands. "And somehow I'm still attracted to you."
"We will never speak of this," Draco warns her darkly. "Where have you been? Why are you here now?"
have noticed it."
"He did
I feel myself tremble. The idea of someone transfiguring my heart is terrifying. I absolutely do not want it to come to that. What if it goes wrong? What if I die? I
"It sounds like he left on his own," Luna finally says thoughtfully. "He isn't the type to go quietly and he can resist the Imperius curse. He's clever. If he was taken, he would have left an obvious sign of it. Lucius would have raised the alarm too."
"I'm going to call everyone in."
Draco and I both jump at the shout. Arthur rushes over to us, holding a book open.
"I think so. My father was very…" I pause, trying to find words. "Concerned about my well being. It was odd, but I think he's starting to understand how his actions impacted our family."
"Did... did anything occur during that time that might have caused strain on your body?" He is talking gently, as if trying to coax an injured animal to come to him.
I glance up at Harry. His mouth is moving. I can't hear him. His eyes are blazing.
"Of course, my love. I'll always be by your side to help you fight your demons."
"I… don't know any French," Harry mumbled, as Draco's teeth scraped over his clavicle.
"Uh… can I have your permission?" I ask, trying to keep the impatience out of my voice.
Shaking my head, I sit up straighter. The familiar sensation of Hermione’s magic flutters over me. Her mouth twitches into a smile after a moment.
"Ah, one last thing." Hermione mutters a spell and something thunks on the table in front of me. "Drink this before having sex. It should work preemptively to keep your heart stable when you, er, finish."
Harry cups my face in his hands tenderly. "Are you ready?"
"Yep." The bastard actually sounds smug and I have to stop myself from breaking his nose. I probably would have tried if Goldstein were actually here. Or I would have used the dickhead curse.
It feels like no time has passed at all, but it must have because when I open my eyes, Bill is talking in a low voice to Hermione and Luna. I don't even remember falling asleep. After the past few days of no sleep, that's not surprising. I am exhausted. Sitting up, I fix my glasses and rub my hands over my face, trying to erase the bone tiredness I feel.
I find myself laughing. "Don't worry. He'll behave. Just to let you know, if you run with his teasing, he'll stop more quickly."
"Harry!" Draco threw Harry a wand as Harry scrambled off the ground.
"Those aren't bad, actually." I blink. "I really like Rigel."
"Enough. Goldstein, you will remain silent until Harry is finished talking or I will silence you myself." Kingsley's face is neutral, but I can see a flash of anger in his eyes.
"What do you mean?" Ginny slips off the desk and takes a seat in one of the chairs.
Once, we went to Australia. I was helping Luna search for a gulping plimply.
Actually, I think it was Luna's way of getting me out of my cottage. It was right after I was released from house arrest. She absolutely demanded my help searching for one once I was healed. I guess she wanted me to go because I was so depressed.
I return my focus to Potter. He looks like a confused fish with his mouth hanging open. Maybe I hadn't kept my concern hidden as well as I thought.
"How is that different from normal?" Ron snorted.
To my surprise, the blush on his cheeks deepens slightly. I can see the smallest of smiles on his lips. It doesn't look like a malicious smile either. It almost looks shy. There is no way Draco Malfoy is shy. I change the subject.
Morgana. He is so cute when he's flustered.
Yet it was also never ruled out?
"I am assuming you're going to explain what happened with Goldstein." I look at our hands. His darker skin contrasts prettily against mine.
"It's not your responsibility. Goldstein is responsible for his own actions. Not you." Draco gives me a measured look. "You couldn't have predicted this. No one could… and if I recall correctly, you're absolute shit at divination. At least everyone here knows that this article is essentially all slander."
"No, I just really like you." Harry laughs.
He used to curl up in my lap sulking, but Hermione decided that it was best for him to get mild exercise. Now, we go for walks around the hospital when he needs fresh air.
Blaise pulls my hand away and stares at me. "Wow, Goyle is a really lucky guy."
"It's going to be okay, love. It might have been irreversible back in... well, whenever that was written. That doesn't mean we can't break the curse now.... and Cor Ejus is a newer spell. That book wouldn't know if it works or not."
"She is like a muggle private investigator," I explain, "but without morals."
"Do you want me to teach you the dickhead curse?" I offer, a grin making its way onto my face.
Again, both my Draco and his memory self have the same reaction as Nagini slithers onto the table and opens her mouth to start swallowing down the body. They turn their heads and throw up on the floor.
Cupping his jaw, I discreetly feel his pulse beating strong and steadily against my palm - a habit from when we first started dating. The beating is a sure rhythm that I've grown to rely on.
The mark is completely gone.
Draco pulls his mouth off me with a little pop. "Are you going to fuck my face or not?"
"Honestly, if you really want to snog Malfoy, I'll support you... just... Harry, he's a downright git. I still don't think he's a death eater, but he is a prick. What if he hurts you?" Ron sat on his bed, chewing on his lower lip.
Malfoy's face surfaces in my memory. I let myself remember how he made me feel as he laughed and healed my sting. I remember how he gripped my hand when we apparated to his cottage. I remember how he made sure I slept after I had a fight with Anthony. Malfoy has treated me with more kindness and compassion than my boyfriend ever has.
"I do. Faye almost died that night because I refused Amycus's order. Torturing her would have been better than bleeding out… this was the night I turned it all off."
"I'm not going to let you die," he says, his voice shaking.
Harry takes a deep breath. He tells me about the abuse next. About how Goldstein would withhold affection to punish him. He tells me how Goldstein would show up at his work if Harry wasn't home by a certain time. He tells me about the time Goldstein was mad and punched the wall next to Harry's head. He tells me about how Goldstein cursed Harry's house elf.
"You... you want to be friends then?" I ask carefully.
"I'll tell you later, love." She flicks her wand at the desk and the food vanishes.
A bit of tension leaves her shoulders, but Ron is folding his arms.
"Ters... what?"
The paper slips out of his fingers and under the door. Draco hugs Faye to his chest and leans against the wall. "Don't worry. Help is coming. I can't do this on my own, but that guy who's coming to save us? He has a fierce girlfriend who goes to school here. She'll come."
"What has he done?" Kingsley prompts.
Harry waits until the door is closed firmly behind him before taking me in his arms again. Finally. His warmth is comforting.
It takes a lot of restraint to keep myself from rushing through this. I want to make sure I'm completely ready for Draco's cock. This is his first time. I want it to go as smoothly as possible. That means being stretched well enough that he isn't worrying about hurting me.
Harry was relieved when he saw Malfoy's dot walking down one of the corridors. He was making his way to the room of requirement. Thankfully, Harry was closer to the room than Malfoy was.
"Is there anything I can do to help him?"
There's a soft rapping at the door and Harry pokes his head in. My father gives him an appraising look.
The child is standing so still and is so small, I didn't even see him at first. I take an unsteady step towards the dark-haired boy. Harry's hand slips out of mine.
"What gave you that idea?" I'm not really paying attention. I'm focusing on the diagnostic spells I'm going through.
Draco is getting restless being stuck in the hospital. He complains often about wanting to go back home. Where I once would have found that annoying, I now find it cute. I like seeing the pout on his lips. I like kissing it away.
"Malfoy? We need to get you to the hospital wing. Can you stand up?"
I run to her, wrapping my arm around her waist. "Luna, what's wrong? Are you okay?"
Malfoy's lips turned up in a smile. He kissed Harry again, letting go of his wrists to tangle his fingers in Harry's messy hair.
I look up at her and see her worried eyes are shuttered. I've never seen Ginny look this closed off.
"Well, I am a bit surprised to see this, but I had a feeling it was only a matter of time." She sits on the bed facing us and takes out her wand. "Anything new?"
Casting the lubrication charm, I circle my hole slowly, giving Draco a show. It feels different with him watching than when I am just getting myself off. His gaze feels like hot coals raking over my body.
Blaise is really fucking smart. It only takes him a handful of seconds to understand.
"I just wanted to give you this. It seems my lovebird was overly aggressive about me showing what lies in my heart. You might find it amusing."
Bill comes forward and shakes it. He's so relaxed. He looks confident. He even has a piercing. I've considered getting piercings, but haven't been able to go through with it yet.
Obviously I am going to. Harry is my best friend. So long as he's not in a bad situation, it's my job to support him and love him. That doesn't mean I have to like his boyfriend though.
"Gods…" Harry breathed. "We'll do it your way this time."
"There would be no reason to take Lucius," Ginny adds, her brow furrowing. "Besides all that, if it is Crabbe's father, he's trying to kill Draco. And he's getting more determined or desperate considering he tried to poison him. He would have just killed him there, I think."
"Draco..." he breathes.
My father stops. I don't.
Harry nodded quickly, his messy hair falling into his eyes. "Yes! Please!"
"You can take your sweet time tonight," Draco whines, his fingers fumbling with my belt. He doesn't even bother taking it off properly. Instead he pulls my cock out of my trousers and strokes it. "Our kids could show up any minute and I want to be dicked down."
"It's fine. We know he's not Crabbe." I frown. "Please. I haven't seen my father in five years."
"It's really going to be okay,” Hermione assures as well. “It's a scary thing, but I'm here for you. So are all your friends and Harry." She squeezes my shoulder. "You're not going to be alone."
Draco holds out his hand. Everything in me is screaming that this is a bad idea, but he's right. I can't protect him from this. Even if I didn't give him this paper, he could buy his own copy. The hate mail will be arriving soon as well.
"It will be fine, love," Harry murmurs.
Harry is sitting beside me, dozing in a chair. There are smudge marks under his eyes and his hair is even more messy than usual. I wonder how long I've been asleep.
Harry felt Draco's dick nudge against his entrance. He took a deep breath and relaxed as Draco pressed inside.
There's a crack and someone opens the front door. I spin away from Anthony and look at the person stumbling in. It's Luna.
The door is locked. I quickly cast a charm to unlock it and throw the door open.
Focusing on Luna's warmth against my side and her arms around me, I know I'm not alone. Luna, Ginny, my mother… and Harry. Harry will be by my side through the whole thing.
"Hermod is at my house. Send a letter with him if you find them or if you hear anything about Draco."
"What's going on?" I ask carefully, feeling like I'm missing something important.
"Listen, I'm doing this because I want to. Your life is worth a lot to the people who love you. Your parents, my sisters, your friends... and Harry. They care about you." I hear Bill sigh. "I don't know what you lived through or how painful it was. I do know that you're worth saving."
"I know you're having some internal crisis, but we need to take care of that."
My hands are still being pressed into the bed, which is mildly frustrating. I want to run them over Draco's body. I want to tangle them in his long hair that's curtaining our faces. Instead, I grip his hands in mine, sliding our fingers together.
There’s a short pause, and then the voice speaks an incantation I’m not familiar with.
"Daddy? Papa?" Lyra's voice comes from the other side of the door. "Maia had an accident."
"For my what?" I prompt.
"Harry will be back before you know it," Ron says after a long moment.
"I'll still ask George to help," Ginny says. "He knows how bad Harry's fans get… and I think he's been working on a charm to destroy howlers anyways."
An arm slips around my waist. I glance at Harry who is smiling. That smile is enough to make me melt. More than that, I feel safe when I see it.
Almost immediately, Maia and Lyra start jumping excitedly. Maia nearly bounces herself out of my arms. I tighten my grip on her.
His skin stopped glowing. His eyes returned to their usual grey. He didn't look heart-stoppingly beautiful anymore. He just looked like Malfoy.
Draco is shaking beside me, so I pull him into my arms. He buries his face in my shoulder.
She wraps an arm around Hermione's shoulders and steers her out of the library. "Come and tell me more about the curse."
I know he's trying to research the curse.
"Are you serious?"
"Thank you," I say, getting to my feet tiredly.
To his surprise, Hermione laughed into her hand. "No, she's definitely not into Malfoy."
"I'm not leaving you here… but that reminds me."
He squeezes my shoulder. I blink up at him. Ron is staring at the ceiling. I think I see tears in his eyes.
Amycus grabs Draco's frozen arm and forces him into the room. "You can watch her bleed out tonight. Maybe next time you'll do what you're told."
"No. I won't be able to force myself back."
Groaning, Harry rolled onto his stomach and buried his face in his pillow. He wondered if Draco knew they were fated mates. If he did, he hadn't even hinted at it - probably because he didn't want to be bonded to him. Maybe that's why he had been avoiding Harry so much.
"Draco, it's me. It's Harry... you made me sleep here when I came in for my shift early. Remember? You used my wand."
"Of course I still love you!" I say, almost indignantly. "You're still Harry! You're still the man I've loved most of my life!"
I hate myself in that moment because even though Harry just kissed me so close to my mouth and said he likes me, I still doubt myself. I still can't believe that it's happening. I want to reach out to him and kiss him, but the fear of being wrong... the fear of being rejected is powerful.
Harry opened and closed his mouth a few times, tasting words, but unable to push them out. Hermione wasn't wrong. Ever since Draco had returned to school, he had been putting up a farce. Harry was desperate to get him to show anything real. Anything at all. And he did love him - Merlin knows why.
"I was getting worried," Harry says carefully.
"Well, he brought it for us. I told him to let you sleep and you shouldn't be drinking caffeine with your heart condition. He drank your cup and went back to the study after."
"It's not?"
"I need to go to him." I stand abruptly. "He's in danger."
I am hurt that you would imply that I would be negligent about something like this!" I add, folding my arms.
"I was surprised too," Ginny tells him, looking up from reading the paper. "But you have to admit, it's about fucking time."
"Because I had the same dream… and you said that my dream was no less real just because it was happening in my head." I shift my weight. "Luna thinks we shared that dream because of the
. Fucking hell. We need to set this right. The only thing I can think of is releasing our own article with the truth. That will have to wait until after we break the curse though.
"To be honest, I really don't care. I like you. The press can say what they want to, so long as we're happy." Harry shrugs.
"Your heart hasn't gotten worse. I'm going to get your potions."
My stomach clenches painfully as it tries to empty itself into the toilet, but I think there's nothing left in me anymore. When I'm finally done heaving, I spit out whatever is left in my mouth.
I check my own watch and hurriedly kiss Hermione on the cheek before walking out of the changing rooms. I power walk down the two flights of stairs to the ground floor. I wave at the Welcome Witch, I think her name is Olive, as I pass her.
There's a brown haze here too. This is the only other traumatic thing I can remember happening that week. I hope it's done after this. I close my eyes to steady myself.
"No. Absolutely not," Draco says flatly, backing himself into a corner of the window seat.
It’s quiet between us for a long time, content and calm. I’m sure Draco is already falling asleep again when he speaks up, surprising me.
"Right after Harry left."
"You are insatiable."
"Perfect. Can you bring them here?"
"Malfoy must love you. If he didn't, the process would have taken a lot longer. He would have appeared... horrifying at first. Like those veela at the World Cup. He wouldn't have been able to bond you. At least, that's what happened to one woman in Bulgaria."
Luna gestures to the loft and follows Minty to the kitchen. Taking the hint, I carry Draco up the stairs.
Draco finally meets my eyes. He looks sad. "I can do that, but he needs to be honest with me first. I need to understand the situation."
"Hey, are you okay? You look a little green." Bill crouches in front of me, looking concerned. I don't deserve it.
"Shut up," Draco says, elbowing him again.
"He… er, may have coerced consent from me," Harry mumbles.
Ginny flushes even darker and punches me in the arm. "Oh, shut up."
I grip her tighter. "We're going there now."
Harry's hands tense around mine. He's staring at me with a tenderness I've never seen directed at me. "He won't show up again. He can't come near us anymore. I filed DAISIES. That's a-"
I feel some of the tension drain from my shoulders. "Thank the gods."
"I don't know who my fated mate is, but apparently I want to free them?" Harry pushed his fingers through his hair.
I run my hands down his back soothingly and rest my cheek on his head. The next memory starts and I hug Harry tighter to me. We're in a bedroom.
Minty nods once, and then she's gone. The door shuts. Ginny grabs my arm. This time, I apparate us.
"Coming, sweetie," I say after removing the
"How are you feeling?" I ask him, my anger fading with him in my arms.
His fated mate, no less. How was he supposed to do that? He didn't even know who… oh, who was he trying to kid? He had an idea of who it was, even if he wasn't entirely sure.
Sucking harder, I move my hand down to cup his balls, carefully running my fingers over them. My original intent was to show him the pleasures of his perineum, but before I can make it there, he comes with a strangled shout of my name.
"How old are you?" I ask weakly as he walks outside.
I am anyways.
Draco is still buried inside of me, holding me to his chest, when I finally blink my eyes open again. His fingers are running over my back in gentle patterns.
"I need to go to France. Can you try to find Blaise Zabini and Pansy Parkinson? They might have an idea where Draco went."
"But... why would he say that Harry is cheating?" Draco is staring at the floor, his hands clenched in front of him.
"Lucius sent me a letter this morning. I'm so relieved there's a chance of healing you, love," she says, pulling back and cupping my face in her soft hands. "I'm sorry it took me so long to get here. I had to find something."
Ginny pulls a potion out of her robes, handing it to him. "Just stole it from the hospital wing."
Hermione pulls out her wand and starts running through the diagnostic spells. Truthfully, in this moment, I'm glad I'm not his healer anymore. I can't even focus on the results of her spells with how worried I am.
Tears threatened to form in his eyes. He blinked them away. Draco was getting worried. Pushing back comfort and love, Harry tried to soothe him and in return Draco sent a wave of love.
" he hissed.
"Master Draco wasn't the one being cruel to house elves, sir. Master Draco treated us with indifference."
"I like it... you humming it anyways."
Harry glances at me, looking worried.
"You don't want to get hurt. You're new. They might think of you as a threat." I pull out my wand and cast a protective charm on him. I developed this charm myself. "
For some reason, Anthony is jealous of Gin, I think. I've only been dating him for five months and I guess Ginny intimidates him. He said it's because I'm bisexual and it's hard to trust bi men. I don't understand it. I just try to appease him.
Pulling the talisman my mother gave me out of my pocket, I shift my weight anxiously. "Yeah, but I need the potion first… and I need to send a note to Pansy."
"Draco! I need to show you something," Harry grumbled, squirming in his arms.
I open my mouth. A look of relief washes over Harry's face. I drink the potion he gives me.
"Harry, have you thought this through? You're my healer. I might die soon. I'm a dis-"
Hermione pinches the bridge of her nose. I can tell I'm about to be lectured, so I open the book and shove it under her nose. A look of exasperation crosses her features, but she takes it and starts reading.
Death Eaters are sitting at a massive long table. I pinpoint Draco immediately. He looks uncomfortable to say the least.
Draco reaches down and pulls up his sleeve. The dark mark is there, faded. It's surrounded by flowers. I have no idea what they are, but they're beautiful. The mark is almost hidden by them.

Now that I think about it, I'm certain she planted the idea in my head on purpose. Thank magic. She's clever. I'm buying her that magical encyclopedia set she's been eyeing. I owe her a thank you present.
“Of course I would,” he says with a sad smile. “I love him still. I know, deep in my heart, that this is not his fault. Malfoy has done something terrible to him and I cannot wait for the moment that he is brought to justice for that!”
"I thought you had never done any of this?" Harry asked, settling back on the pillow. "You seem like an expert to me."
"I made the curry sweet this time… as a peace offering." Ginny wraps her arms around herself. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you or said the things I did."
Of course, Luna noticed. She's made it a point to bring me to a sea or ocean three times a week since. At first, we just watched the marine life. We explored reefs and swam with turtles and dolphins.
I'm surprised to see Hermione's shoulders sag. Relief washes over her features. "Thank the goddess. I was worried Harry would never file for DAISIES."
My hand flies to my arm, nails biting into the skin as the impulse to destroy the mark takes over all my senses.
It's kind of nice having more friends that are comfortable just coming into my home. My only regular visitors have been Luna, Ginny, and Pansy. Harry and Hermione both look completely at ease here. I like that.
"They really do," Harry replies, amusement coloring his tone.
I stand up abruptly. Luna blinks, her blue eyes watching me curiously.
"Malfoy, just let me do the damn diagnostic spells."
After I showed Malfoy the note from Luna with his mother's address, I brought him there. I watched as Luna and Narcissa hugged him. Then, I had said goodbye and left.
"Mm… well, I'll be ready for another go soon enough." Draco pulls me down to kiss him. "Until then, I should prepare you, right?"
"Never do that again," I say, pulling his lips down to mine.
"Because I trust you. I trust you enough to allow myself to be vulnerable. I trust you enough to show you things that I've barely even spoken of." I press a kiss to his forehead. "All I'm asking is that you consider changing your mind and allow me to heal you."
There was a rustle and something was placed by Harry's arm. A piece of parchment.
He felt something wet pressing into him. Draco's fingers. Two of them. Harry might actually die. He would have survived for so long just to die from Draco Malfoy's fingers in his arse and his mouth around his cock.
"I love you," I whisper hoarsely, downing the contents of the vial.
"You don't actually believe that?"
For most of my life, I have been like a drum beating out of time with my surroundings - not really fitting in anywhere. I didn't fit in with the Dursleys. Hogwarts was filled with times when I was ostracized. Even as an adult, I've been treated differently because of my fame. Draco has confided in me that he has felt the same since sixth year. But here, holding onto my daughters' hands and hearing Draco curse as a wand explodes in his hands behind us, we have a place where we're completely in sync.
The last scene in this chapter was very personal and difficult to write. This is an argument I have with myself daily. I want to take this moment to reiterate that if any of my lovely readers are struggling with mental illness, it's not weak to ask for help. Therapy can be an amazing option.
"Down by the Welcome Witch!" Ron says urgently. "Harry, please hurry!"
"Hello. Draco Malfoy, right?" A man says entering my room.
Ropes shoot out of Alecto's wand, wrapping themselves around the girl. She casts a silencing spell on her next and drags her off.
"I did." I brush his hair out of his face.
"Think nothing of it. Also, call me Molly." She smiles and gestures for me to eat. "I checked in with Luna while you were sleeping. She says your mother is doing well."
"Zabini, stop stressing out my patient."
I hug Ginny as I pass her and take one of the four plates on the tray. It smells wonderful. I'm still not quite sure why she can't cook anything else. Curry doesn't seem easy to make, but I've seen Ginny ruin tacos before.
The thought makes me uncomfortable. I tend to avoid thinking about the time I nearly killed him. I bury the memory now.
"But this is Malfoy," Ron said, watching Harry worriedly. "He's a slimy git. Besides, I know Harry is bi, but isn't Malfoy straight?"
"He needs to go to St. Mungos. Now."
Kissing Draco reminds me of sunshine on a spring day. It feels like warmth and light is filling me.
It took him a moment of struggling with the urge before he realized he didn't
"I need to go to my home first," he says. "I have to get my supplies for work."
"Why?"
A thought dawned on Harry. He was fairly certain he and Malfoy had just agreed to be boyfriends.
Whoever impersonated Lucius is long gone. I fight the instinct to chase after him. I have to check on Draco first.
I know just how much my husband can take. I know his limits. I know his boundaries. So I fuck his relaxed mouth as he thrusts his fingers into my hole.
I feel my body tense again. "Was it a Death Eater mask?"
Your magic is intertwined. You
"You're definitely not getting any worse. I've scheduled you for the heart transfiguration. Healer Avery Powell will be the one to perform it. They're the best healer who specializes in this magic in all of Europe."
"It's gross. I'm sorry, Kreacher, but this is the most disgusting thing you have made in years." I wipe my mouth, trying to get rid of the taste. "I prefer my turtles alive."
Draco adjusted his angle slightly. Harry nearly sobbed in pleasure as he pushed back in and nudged his prostate. The pleasure was getting to be too much. It was almost painful.
The sound of the door opening fills the room. Faye whimpers and presses closer to Draco.
"But..." I swallow. "That means Crabbe was here impersonating him before."
"You're not a Death Eater," I say, hugging him closer to me.
Kingsley produces a clear glass vial and hands it to me. I touch my wand to my temple and focus on drawing out the memories of my relationship with Anthony.
"P-Potion," he rasps.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
He smells like the sea. I wonder if it's his shampoo. His head falls to rest against my shoulder.
, no. I would know that voice anywhere. Potter's wand rises and the light expands to fill the whole room.
I open my mouth to defend Harry, but Draco holds up his hand.
"Did you mean what you said to my father?" I ask breathlessly.
I stay quiet for a moment, trying to process what he is saying. It's difficult to wrap my mind around. He's watching me, giving me time to think. I don't want to think anymore.
Luna looks thoughtful, her finger tapping on her chin. "Do you know where Harry was in the waking world?"
"Hermione, isn't there a spell we can use instead?"
"Draco," Harry murmurs, "your heart."
The memory falls away. I feel Harry tense in my arms.
Malfoy licked the bite, soothing the leftover sting. Harry shivered, pressing up against Malfoy. He tugged on his silvery hair until Malfoy's lips met his again.
I suppose that's to be expected. Anthony does take up a lot of my time. He likes to be first in my life. He doesn't like it when I hang out with friends or ex-girlfriends... which means, every time I hang out with Gin, he gets upset.
Draco sat up. He gently guided Harry until he was on his back again.
Ron nods slowly, still looking like he's going to be sick. I lead him to the closest room which ends up being the kitchen. After casting every silencing spell I can think of, I take the howler from Ron's clenched fingers. It has begun to smoke.
I see a camera flash out of the corner of my eye. A flush creeps up my neck. Suddenly, the hospital seems inviting. I walk quickly inside, pulling Harry in too. Reporters aren't allowed in the hospital unless they have special permission.
"Master Harry." Kreacher croaks, bowing.
"But we already tried the manor," Ginny reminds her.
"Not yet. I just got here. Sorry to wake you." Bill gives me a reassuring smile.
Ron looked ready to protest, but Harry beat him to it. "Why did he tell Snape that I gave him a lust potion?"
"Just don't let anything happen to him until Ron gets here. Narcissa and Luna will have our heads if something happens to him after we convinced them to go home."
Draco removed his fingers, muttering something under his breath. He stroked his own cock a few times. Harry wished he was wearing his glasses so he could see it more clearly.
"He spoke in Parseltongue for the first time since the war. Ginny said he didn't even know he could still speak it after Voldemort's soul was killed, but he ordered that snake away from you. He kept promising Mother that he would keep you safe."
Harry hesitates. I see the answer in his eyes and in the books stacked around him. I push him back into the makeshift bed.
"Okay. Can we drop the subject now?" I ask a slight whine in my voice.
: the Boy Who Lived has chosen a path in the medical area and is a healer at St Mungos. This reporter has found out that Mr Malfoy is currently a patient at the hospital and - as it seems - one of Mr Potter’s patients - a relationship as such would, therefore, break hospital rules!
I feel exhausted. This is too much for me to deal with right now. I am cursed. This curse is going to kill me unless we can find a way to break it.
He tried to give Voldemort a chance. He really did. Voldemort refused to show any remorse. Then, it was over.
"And Theo Nott or Gregory Goyle will announce their love for you." I grin weakly and watch Ron turn pale.
Luna's tattoos are gone! Every line, every color, every carefully chosen, beautiful flower of my tattoo - just… gone.
Thank magic that bee stung me when it did.
Draco glances up at us from under his pale eyelashes. I should go to Ron, but I'm worried Draco won't eat anything if someone doesn't encourage him.
He doesn't have to say who abused Dobby. Which reminds me to ask myself, what the bloody hell I'm thinking. Lucius Malfoy is still Malfoy's father. His parents would probably hex me for trying to kiss their son. Lucius Malfoy fucking hates me.
"It's okay. Draco, you're safe. You made it through this."
"Fine. I'm… fine. Don't stop," he gasps, even as he rubs his head. He must have hit it on the headboard. Seeing my reluctance, he continues, "Please, Harry, don't stop."
The second Draco sits up, I follow him and leave a kiss under his ear. I wait until I hear him swallow to tug his shirt off.
He probably realizes what a mistake he almost made. If he was about to kiss me. I honestly don't know. I can't decided if I would rather he had been trying to kiss me or not.
After a moment, the memory stops rewinding as if someone hit the play button. My seventeen year old self is standing outside of the largest parlor room in the manor, hidden by a statue. There are voices coming from within.
Luna, Ginny, and Hermione walk inside. I'm relieved to see them. Hermione will know what to do. She always does. Luna might even be able to convince Draco to try the mind walking thing.
I feel Harry's lips press against my forehead. I smile and look up at him. Harry's been kissing me a lot since the day we talked about being together. It's always chaste. Little kisses all over my face. My nose, eyelids, cheeks, chin, eyebrows, and forehead have all been graced by Harry's lips.
"You're a lot bigger than anything that's been up my arse before," I admit, sinking down a few more inches.
"Draco, what are you doing? You shouldn't be straining your body."
Harry had a brief moment to wonder what Malfoy was doing, but then the door was there and Harry was being pulled inside.
Hermione barely glances at it. She is much better at dealing with poisons and potions. She casts a charm on it. Her face turns dark.
"Where is she?!"
"Neither do I… but you're terrified of Nagini. Maybe if you confront that fear, you'll break the curse on this memory." I wrap my fingers around his with a reassuring squeeze.
My mouth falls open. Harry's eyes flick down to my lips, but he doesn't lean in like he did when we were at my cottage. He seems to be waiting for something.
a desk in our library has never happened before. We always took our meals in the dining room as well. My parents have always been strict with manners and rules in their house.
I feel vaguely jealous, but I know it's irrational because Harry is right here with me. He's not with Goldstein.
"Okay… you're right. I wasn't thinking. I'm sorry," she mumbles. Then, she puts her hands on her hips and glares up at me. "Are you seriously dating Draco? What about Anthony? What about all the history?"
"Fifty points from Gryffindor and detention every weekend until the end of term, Potter. I don't want to listen to your excuses. Mister Malfoy, come with me so I can give you an antidote."
He's reading a book next to me in his room. George is sitting upside down in a chair. He and Arthur are talking about something in one of the books Ron brought from my place.
I'll be safe here. Crabbe can't get through the wards now.
DAISIES stands for Domestic Abuse & Invasive Stalking, Immediate Enforced Separation. It is a protective order meant to magically separate an abuser/stalker and their victim.
"Did Malfoy give you trouble?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He sits up with me half in his lap before realizing we're both naked. Wrapping the sheet around us, he flushes crimson.
I've been stuck in the hospital for two weeks now. Harry and Hermione are worried that I'll be attacked again and I still won't agree to stay at Harry's place. There's also the alarming problem that my heart isn't working without several potions and spells a day.
Now, I have to ask myself something else. Can I face reliving what happened to me?

I carefully wrap my arms around his shoulders. I'm half expecting him to push me off him, but he just strokes my hair. This feels surreal.
"About that..." I stare into my cup. "I am sorry. I wasn't kind to you or anyone really. I fucked up a lot. If it weren't for me... Fred might not have died. Dumbledore would probably still be alive too."
Disclaimer: I am not well versed in how to write like an American Civil War wizard.
"Finally, Rosenbush is responding to treatment. They will be ready to go home as soon they stop sneezing sparks," she finishes. "Malfoy's heart is doing better as well. He should be ready to leave this evening."
I suppress a sigh. He won't stop until I try it. So, I sit down across from him and carefully taste the soup. I immediately spit it out. It reminds me too much of marsh water.
I take a deep breath. I try to focus on the water. The way it cools my body. The fine sand against my skin. It's a little rough. It reminds me of Potter's calloused fingers. Fuck. I can't get him out of my head.
"What happened then? Where is Harry?"
I crouch down behind the younger Harry and look into the mirror. It's strange that I can't see myself in it at all. Instead, I just see Harry, invisibility cloak pooled on his lap. He's staring at his knees and crying silently.
"I love you. Nothing in your memories will change that. It won't make me pity you or anything. I swear."
I that used to it?
"This?" I put the potion Hermione gave me on the desk.
"Yeah, I am. I have no idea how this is going to work… but I am happy. I don't think he wants to be a death eater either. He said Voldemort was threatening him… that he'll kill him and his family if he fails a task."
Harry tenses beside me. Ron jumps to his feet and pulls out his wand.
My heart leaps. I can see someone with messy black hair striding down the sidewalk.
I take a sip of the tea Harry gave me to hide my grin. Ron looks torn between defending Harry and being proud of Hermione... and Harry's mouth is opening and closing. Its highly amusing.
"Are you happy now?" he asks, cupping my face in his hands.
I clear my throat, letting my mother know I'm here. She turns around and a smile lights up her face when she sees me. All of the tension leaves my body.
He felt terrible. We all had to assure him that he was not to blame. Only Mr. Goldstein is to be blamed for his actions, not Harry.
"Anthony is fine. I'm sure this is just a phase. He was perfectly good to me when we first started dating." I look at a spot over Ron's shoulder.
"Are you sure I didn't put you under a love spell?" I try to joke, but it comes out sounding weak.
I cast my mind around quickly, not wanting to say what I had been actually thinking about.
"He's abusing you, mate."
"No, of course not. Molly will be here in four hours to relieve Ron." Granger smirks, looking quite happy about this.
His eyes remain closed for a moment, looking like he doesn't want it to be over. I don't either. I have to prioritize his health though.
It takes longer than it should for me to notice Draco is about to cry. He's staring at the floor, so it's hard to see his face, but I recognize the slight tremor in his shoulders.

Every kiss we've shared so far has been gentle and slow. This kiss is different. There's an edge to it as if Harry's holding himself back.
"Uh… should I just pick something up?" I ask in amusement.
"So, is this really happening?" Blaise asks, drawing our attention to him. He gestures between Draco and me. "You guys are finally dating? It's not just a scandalous rumor?"
Harry waves his wand and the memory shifts. We're standing in an empty classroom now. I recognize the child Harry as the one I knew in first year. He's sitting in front of an ornate mirror.
"You shouldn't be. Blaise is a hussy." Draco rolls his eyes. "He's always kissing or fucking someone."
"Then, yes! Maybe I would rather die than relive what he did to me!"
The spell cuts through the air. At first, I'm expecting Draco to scream, but the spell wasn't aimed at him.
"Ah, according to the book, the veela will use their magic to give their mate the ability to bond with them? That part is kind of vague." Hermione looked a little helpless. "Harry, I promise this isn't as bad as it sounds."
How have you dealt with that in the past?
I nod, watching Malfoy for a moment. He is all sharp lines and angles... but sleeping restfully... well, he looks soft. I really want to tell Hermione about everything Malfoy did before I fell asleep, but there's no time now.
Bill comes closer, pulling out his wand. With a swish, a golden mist surrounds Draco. It's actually kind of beautiful, but anxiety constricts my chest as the mist sinks into his skin.
Harry and I follow his younger self back to the house while I think over what Harry just said. Remembering what Harry looked like when I first met him, I realize he hadn't looked like he was my age in Madam Malkin's. Baggy clothes, too skinny, and so nervous… malnourished and abused.
"Yes, I'm sure. I want you to know my past and the things that shaped me into who I am." I press my lips to his forehead again.
Arthur gently pries my fingers off the book. I had been clutching it so hard, the delicate pages are tearing. I take a breath and let go.
"Bill Weasley."
(See the end of the chapter for
Flying? Harry resisted the urge to rub his eyes. Draco had wings. Long, pearly white wings. Their eyes met. Silver and emerald. Draco was glowing. Everyone else seemed to freeze and Harry realised this was the first time they were seeing Draco as a veela.
Harry's grip on me is a vice. "You didn't…"
"I can't." I feel a lump in my throat and try swallowing.
No. Harry wouldn't love me less. If he was going to hate me, it would have been for things I did of my own volition… not for things that the Dark Lord did or forced me to do.
"Well... the good news is, your heart hasn't grown worse. It's stable."
Narcissa bursts in moments later as Nagini slithers under the bed. She immediately wraps Draco in her arms. "What's wrong, little dragon?"
"It's going to take ages to make this place livable," my father mutters.
"Everything is fine," I say after a glance at my father.
My blood runs cold. Something is terribly wrong. I turn on my heel and start running up the stairs again. A noise catches my attention. Someone is hammering on a door and shouting.
I feel my father tense. He hugs me tighter to his chest.
"Yes, my Lord. I did just as you asked and followed the Malfoy brat everywhere. He never even noticed me. I heard him say it, my Lord. He told the Lovegood girl he's in love with none other than Harry Potter himself," another voice squeaks.
"More like it's the only thing she can make," Draco mutters.
"When was that?" I ask, trying not to squirm under his intense green gaze.
I feel a vial press against my lips. I don't want to drink it. I shake my head.
Harry looks confused, but then understanding crosses his features. He just seems sad now. I kiss his forehead.
"Are you telling me, I'm to be left alone with Weasel for the next eleven hours?" I ask suddenly.
"That song... it sounds familiar."
"Is he okay?"
I'm definitely sending Pansy an owl about Goldstein.
"Holed up in a flat in Knockturn Alley. What do you want me to do about him? Light him on fire? Cover him in boils? Vanish his lungs?"
I kiss him back quickly before pulling away. "Anthony... I need to shower. Work was exhausting and I feel gross."
When I told her, Luna had given me a smile and told me she was in love with Ginny. That had been the end of the conversation. She hadn't laughed or said it was impossible. She had just accepted me and I had accepted her.
"Thank you. Kreacher, is... did something happen while I was in the shower?" I ask, watching him wearily as I summon a bottle of butterbeer.
"Draco," I say, looking around carefully. "Something isn't right. Do you see it?"
"Your hair is so long, dear." I hear her conjure a brush. "It's longer than Bill's."
Potter rolls his eyes. "Fine. Just drink the potion.  If you need anything, say my name. Hermione will be taking over soon."
"Harry!" Arthur jumps to his feet.
Nagini slithers towards Draco slowly. It's like she's reacting to him. Every step he takes, she moves closer. Draco is squeezing the petrified wood in a death grip.
"You probably won't need to. The potion should prevent it from getting any worse. Just make sure you avoid cholesterol and sugar. Exercise... er, but not strenuous exercise, of course."
"I'm not sure. I thought it meant pensieve. Either way, Draco is refusing to do it. He doesn't want anyone to see his memories." I rub my hands over my face, willing all my exhaustion away.
Closer to the bed, I see Draco's sleeping face. He looks restless, still mumbling in his sleep for me to save him. I want to. So, I step back and pull my boyfriend into my arms.
Draco presses into the kiss as my fingers run through his long hair.
"Harry, you know how you get with him!"
"How can it not be?! He hated me before all of this! And I hate him seventy percent of the time!"
"Uh… no. I came straight here. Wait, are you actually mad at me for this?" I demand.
