“It was really hard for me too,” she said, waving away his half-hearted, half-formed
"I'm sorry," Harry says, in earnest, his tail thrashing against the blanket Draco's wrapped around him. "That was insensitive, but if it makes you feel better, I’d say there’s a reason I haven’t got a home."
The Shaman placed her hand palm-down upon the poorly sewn wound, then declared after a minute, “There aren’t additional jinxes in it; at least I can't detect any. But this is a centuries-old dragon heart. How did you two come into possession of it?”
“We’ll see,” Harry said softly.
“You wouldn’t believe it anyway. If I told you my guess.”
Harry wanted to tell him about what had just happened at the stone well, that it had more than proven the Shaman’s theory. But Draco was shaking his head at Harry, as if no more words were needed because he already knew, as if he had no qualms about loving Harry centuries ago, far before they were born, as if being loved by him naturally entailed that love to bloom and die over and over again.
Neither Malfoy’s suspension nor their visit to the Shaman’s yurt had seemed to throw him off his equilibrium. He went about his life until Charlie finally came round the first time after the attack.
The crinkles gathered deep; there was a sparkling quality to them now. “And it didn’t occur to you that maybe they called you a Solomonar because you already are one,” she said, almost flatly. Harry felt extremely stupid. She hadn’t even framed it as a question.
, Lockhart had written,
Across the waist of the mountain they went, the sky a rain-washed swathe of beryl blue on their left; not a cloud in sight. From time to time, her lurching little trot would send Malfoy tumbling softly into Harry’s back, and when Malfoy spoke, his warm breath tickled at Harry’s earlobe. Harry could feel the shape of each syllable upon his skin.
“Say something,” Draco urges as he takes a few steps over, earnest. “Anything.”
Harry complied. At first, he simply nipped softly at Draco’s lower lips, but after a couple of gentle, explorative beats, Harry moved up; dragged his mouth against Draco’s, coaxing it open with persistent attention.
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “They’re freakishly good at this.”
She must’ve heard Malfoy’s voice and, on instinct, came to stare him down. But instead of a greet-or-grapple situation, she found herself facing an archnemesis of the dragon community—a Shapeshifter; or as Harry had finally understood—a dragon Animagus.
Draco closed his eyes under the overwhelming pain … or was it ecstacy? He had no way of knowing. Everything seemed so similar when swung to the extremes. Blinding and scary.
“I got the heart,” Draco said, wide-eyed, as though he wouldn’t have said it without a little aid from the alcohol.
Harry wishes that Draco has come in spring instead, when foolish cherry-pink hope blossoms back in full; or autumn, when the dying leaves, dry-veined and wild red on his heels, will fall from their cradles just to take his weight away; or winter, when the overarching branches are lit silver—this way, Draco will know what it’s like for Harry whenever he’s staring right into Draco’s eyes.
What he did not understand was the spite that rose from his chest, bitter, when he saw Harry riding up the trail, a duffel bag slung over his shoulder. On Harry's face, was a grin as sweet and tentative as the young sky.
Maybe they were, because Draco was kissing him softly. Quilt-warm.
Charlie and Yulia had been one of the leading teams, and this HoverAid Station followed them along with three other teams flying at a similar speed. They were estimated to arrive at Lake Issyk-Kul two days later. Harry couldn’t bring himself to look forward to it, now that the following events were officially bollocksed up by Malfoy and his wonky shield.
Malfoy’s little growls swelled and loudened into a roar—a distinctly non-human sound. Harry jumped, but Malfoy’s grip was vice-like around his wrists, and he was brought back down onto Malfoy’s lap in no time. Malfoy roared again, his voice sounding unproportionately deep and thunderous, and damned Harry if he couldn’t recognise it when he’d been living with those beautiful, dangerous creatures for the past several years of his life.
Unfamiliar with English, the woman gave an uncertain laugh, and then bid the Shaman goodnight with noisy kisses on her cheeks. Soon, all they could hear was her footsteps, light but measured upon the gravelly trail—almost lupine—as she pattered into the shadow. Her voice was cotton-soft, husky, when she sang an old ballad for her eaglelet.
Surrounding them like a school of curious tropical fish, numerous rainbow-striped, feather-clad bodies twerk and swish and glide about the gleaming asphalt roads.
Like dominoes, a tap of Draco’s wand sent the dried leaves and shrivelled stems catapulting into the boiling liquid.
Draco wondered how much he could wrangle out from Harry in twenty minutes.
She looked at him with pity. “Draco, it’s for your own sake to understand what might be going on. Before the wizarding governments collectively classified it, this was common knowledge: when the heart could not rest in peace, dragons would sometimes reincarnate as Shapeshifters. They did it in the hope of meeting their bonded ones again, in another lifetime. And these strange cycles will only end when their heart is returned to where it wants to be, or when the dragon Animagus has successfully found their way back to their partner—to whomever they might have become by now.”
At that, Draco gives Harry a strange look.
They were high above the clouds, now, and Harry was surprised at his own lack of exultation. He was … he felt calm, instead of triumphant. The shoulder of Khan Tengri hunched up before them, smooth and round and white like the belly of a snowman.
Draco’s mouth was barely a line, and his eyes a hard-set silver, defiant.
From the valley some miles off Karakol, they journeyed east, manoeuvring their way so they stayed safely off the winding Muggle roads. They tore through the rough brown terrain, Draco in sync with Harry—his fleeting thoughts, his abrupt change of directions. It was a giddy fizz that had only simmered down once they reached the mountain range.
“Malfoy.”
Draco looked like winter in-waiting.
Draco slowly backed away towards the entrance. Then, “You don’t, but I think I do. I think I can show you what I mean.”
"Please refrain from doing stupid things just to go on another date with me."
“Harry, where are you?” Charlie’s voice was almost frantic, and his message came like a blunt nail. “I’ve been trying to locate you for some time. Get back to me as quickly as you can. We’ve a lead on the poacher—I’ll tell you the rest when you get back.”
“Right.” Harry felt himself flaming from toe to hair. His body did that whenever Draco threw the word “bonded” out in between them so carelessly. He didn’t have time to decipher the feeling yet. It wasn’t exactly guilt, which was a ubiquitous fever, always there, waiting to bring Harry to a simmer. “Exactly.”
Draco elbowed him.
Setting portable wards around competing Flyers was part of an Arithmancer’s job in the race. On the night before, however, Malfoy’s
Harry’s magic slid across Draco's tongue; it was scorching and red-hot—all burning ashes from which rebirths came easy. Draco felt his core responding, loosening; his magic was soon seeping out from its restraints and into every nook and cranny of his body … into his trembling cells … into the tears that were sliding down his cheeks and melting into the warmth of Harry’s lips.
Dinner was the only time Harry would peel himself away from his routine and have a pint in the common room. While Malfoy would slink about the canteen, get one of the sandwiches he’d vehemently bashed earlier, some coffee in his Thermos, and would then hole up in their shared cabin for the rest of the night.
But Malfoy gulped down another puff of smoke, seemingly unaffected by it just as Harry was—or rather, he seemed to be enjoying it as much, if not more. When he lifted his face, Harry saw that his eyes were glazed.
“I don’t think I want to know what you mean by that,” Draco replied, his voice still matted from sleep.
“Sixty four, but yeah, I must be,” Harry murmurs, stoppering Draco’s anger by printing a quick kiss on his lips. “I must be mad, exposing myself like this in broad …” Harry glances around. “In broad streetlight.”
Harry might have romanticised the process of the Hunt a bit, being a Gryffindor at heart, still. But all that would not happen now, unless Harry could find his own dragon to take Charlie’s place in the game.
It was three in the morning when Harry enquired about the firework show; Draco simply rolled his eyes before blasting a jet of Red Sparks through the white bow window. “Happy?” he said, having the audacity to sound exasperated, but Harry’s snark was soon melted into an unintelligible puddle by the heat of Draco’s mouth.
It was like being wrapped up in a storm of fire and ice, and Harry could only blindly guide Draco this way and that, relying solely on instinct. Finally, Draco—still a Slytherin at heart—gouged out a large scoop of grit and rime from a nearby crevasse with his claws, before hurling it right into the Ridgeback’s face. The angry yell of their opponent soon became indistinct, scattered by the raw violence of nature. As Draco's looming shadow approached the highest point of Khan Tengri, Harry felt like they were leaving everything else behind: the race itself, the doubt that used to follow them around like a scent, and the bed of clouds that fluffed up like candy floss, girdling the snowy ledges.
“Ghosts are not the only mechanism that can haunt the Earth,” Madam Cholpon was saying, and Draco wondered how much he’d missed during his migration. “And death is only a door. That’s all I have to say, young Solomonar.”
Struggling against Malfoy’s hold, Harry brought a hand up to Malfoy’s face—wet all over. Perspiration and tears mingled damply upon it. His skin was cold, thinly sheathing those sharp cheekbones, sharp nose, sharp jaws. Malfoy protested against the loss of purchase by wrestling Harry to the ground with his legs, locking him in between his thighs.
Today, the rain has further polished the sleek buildings, and the glassy world has been divided into two—the avenue trees above; the avenue trees upside down. As if Harry’s life hasn’t already been split in half by his missions, by the batches of Polyjuice, by the luck of the day, the risks of the night, by the feverish mirages of Draco and the barren wasteland below.
Harry returned a wry smile. “Of course Charlie was overreacting, but I was … I was raised in a cupboard, you see; my aunt and uncle treated me no better than a servant, and they often hit me. It was unfair of me to be angry at Bill, at Mrs Weasley … they were the ones that took me in, after all. But Charlie’s anger … ”
Malfoy had been the one to share the news with Harry. Evidently he’d been checking on Charlie every once in a while, and had, without delay, hurried from the Healer’s Quarter all the way up to the stable to get Harry, whom he studiously avoided looking at. “Thought you perhaps would want to be the first, Harry,” Malfoy said stiffly, toeing with his brogues the bristly fringe of Yulia’s empty nest. “To hear Charlie’s first-hand account of the attack.”
Draco clutched the soft silvery equipment, tight, as though it was his only solace. “I’ve—it’s been so long, Harry, and I always thought it was one of the purest parts of me—wanting to be good for you, wanting to transform into someone who can stand side by side with you. Wanting you. But now …” Draco shot a glance at Harry’s face, quick and almost hysterical. “It’s all tainted. I don’t want to be tethered to you like a fucking donkey by
And they aren’t afraid, even though Fudge’s brought Dementors this time, a starved army, a yearlong inertia rolling strong. (The war cannot be disarmed by a spell.)
“Whatever you say. We should head back, though. Can we Apparate—”
It was two thirds into the semester when the shapes from Harry’s past rose into Draco’s night. The trapezium under the stairs, Draco carried in between his ribs. Scant in dimensions as it was, within it lay the exact square metres of tolerance Harry’s relatives had been willing to spare.
“I guess it’s not for me. It’s too grand, and I tend to fuck up important things—don’t give me that look. It’s just how it is. I’d be happy, I think, if I’m able to—” Draco broke off. Looked around. They’d followed the foot path to an intersection, and as they turned left he felt a prickle of intrigue at the back of his neck. It was a demure tug on his magic; rather harmless, but enough to catch Draco’s attention.
Although Draco might not be the hot blade that had branded Yulia’s face back when she was still chained to the darkness of Gringotts, or the call of the clankers that still haunted her in her sleep—he had been one to benefit from it. Their wealth and lifestyle were the burning coals and relentless hammer that forged those weapons. The Malfoy vault and the Lestrange vault slept soundly at night as though the dragon clankers were their lullaby. Draco had always been there, at the apex of this bizarre hierarchy which wizards had charted down and declared law out of an overdeveloped sense of entitlement.
“Harry, I’m glad you did, and it’s not really a chain or a restraint device, is it?”
“Why does anyone do anything anyway?” Malfoy huffed, and he must be leaning closely forward, because there were strands of pale gold teasing in Harry’s peripherals.
Draco’s lips are pressed together into a thin, wobbly line. Harry maps it tentatively with his thumb; adds, “Just bring an umbrella next time, yeah? You know how your migraines can be bastarding bastards.”
Once, on the weather deck, Malfoy had come to him, looking fresh in cloud-white. Unguarded. It was the morning after the ward incident, and Harry had been knackered, having not slept a wink after he saw Charlie’s limp form being rushed through the portal on a stretcher.
“You don’t,” Draco repeated, and got up to his feet. There was grass in his hair. Harry thought his waist looked really slim with the mussed-up folds of his cloak hugging tightly around it.
If this was indeed a trap set up by poachers who were counting on the pull to lull dragons over—a common trick the participants in the Retrieve Hunt often had to deal with—they’d relocate the heart, once they realised that their bait did not attract an ideal target.
At their Station, however, the investigation into Malfoy’s ward incident was still being carried out by his inspectors. The process was slow and lousy, even though Malfoy had once joked to Harry that this was the most efficient and structured mission he ever saw them conducted.
The second time Harry went to the Shaman, she was waiting for them at her Apparition Gate, like she knew they were going to seek refuge in her mountain at that precise moment. Second time round, Harry thought hysterically, and it hadn’t even been a week.
—Not a ghost, the Shaman had concluded. A projection of magic.
It came easy to them—both flying and speaking into each other’s head. Harry didn’t know how much of it was because he had spent his youth watching Draco fly and talk, vice versa, and how much was because this was “meant to be”. He’d stopped thinking about this question entirely at some point—a circle has no beginning, Luna had once said.
“Ah, right.” Draco snapped his fingers to extinguish the fire. They still resembled dragon claws more than they did human digits. Scooping the potion out into several flasks, Draco turned hopefully to Harry. “This afternoon, do you think we’ll be able to go for a walk in the garden together?”
and his magic found Draco’s in no time, latching onto it. Even so, progress was still slow and frustrating; Harry looked around in desperation. Aside from the three or four nearby trunks, weedy and skeleton-white, he could not see through the confusion and take in anything further than that.
“So, do tell.” Finally, after a series of Apparition jumps, Draco picked up the loose thread of their conversation; he was working to renew a Self-Whetting Charm in an heirloom sabre, in return for a couple of beautiful, patterned head scarves.
It is simultaneously too much to take in and yet still barely enough, Harry thinks with growing frustration as he staggers towards the door, determined to get away from all this madness before he loses his mind. He pushes through the crowd muttering apologies and profanities, depending on whether their eyes are glued to Draco as well.
But this might just be the place to start, with humans who were able to respect, and dragons who were able to love back. Draco glanced around, and found nothing but harmony. He had the stupid urge to Transform back into human, to show them who he was—what he was—but he knew it wasn’t time yet. There was still more he could do. Harry was able to tolerate Draco because he was a saint, but with the others, Draco wanted to earn it so that when he lay himself bare it was without shame and remorse, especially in front of Yulia.
The Shaman ignored his pathetic attempt at acting all breezy. She said tersely, “There are ways to test, but I do not recommend doing so. It is not the point, especially when all you want is to move on, Draco.”
“Not even with a Pensieve?”
“Splendid. So you’ll think about it.”
“How—erm, well.”
During the final leg of the race, the attendees would sprint in eight heats, with five pairs in each. It was a glorious day. The afternoon sun glazed over the snow; over the dusky rivulets, turning them silver; and over Draco, who was stretching lazily before the starting line. He took his time arching his back and shaking out his wings. His movements softened the sun’s glare on his scales, watered it down into a mother-of-pearl sheen that flowed gracefully about.
These memories were once lost and now found again. They had been hidden beneath some hundred-years worth of debris, but as the familiar hand of Draco’s old magic rifled about, turning inside out the pockets of Harry’s soul, Harry remembered
“She’s probably a Betty, and a Hufflepuff,” Malfoy had told Harry suddenly. “Don’t you think?”
Harry sighs, but instead of trying to make Draco see sense, he simply asks, “Alright, then how did you end up exactly where I was? I might really need to retake Concealment and Disguise, considering.”
soon followed by a little tune Draco’s repotted time and again into the neat blocks on his calendar, hoping it might one day unfurl its leaves, grow into a song.
Harry pulled himself out from the basin— “Malfoy,” he bit out immediately, not even taking the time to reorient himself.
“What—” Harry gasped, but his fingers felt it before his eyes caught on to the change. Along the vulnerable planes at Malfoy’s temples were no longer soft human skin, but scales, pearly white and shimmery with faint patterns.
Around him, flashes of spells sopped up little sparks of Yulia’s Dragonfyre as they tore their way across the powdery air. Harry—Yulia—could smell them, coarse and acrid as they ricocheted off Charlie’s Protego. Underlying the burnt, fuzzed out noise and the gritty wind, was a vaguely familiar hint of … something …
“I’m not trying to guilt you into anything,” the Shaman said. “On the contrary, I’m telling you not to. This relationship will be yours as much as it will be Draco’s. You don’t have to feel obliged to pile everything upon your shoulders just because Draco isn’t the sole focus of your life.”
“Alright,” Harry said easily. “What about you? Where are you heading?”
he mouthed at her.
Harry’s heart stuttered at her casual mention of it, but his attention was quickly pulled back to their conversation. “What do you mean?” Draco’s face was scrunched up. “My magic? Why’s my magic suddenly everywhere? Is it some sort of a slag?”
“Alright, Christ, fine.”
“P-haps not,” he said, still not meeting Harry’s eyes. “Sorry. I’ll–erm–catch up with you at lunch.”
Draco’s departure might be inevitable, but it could be held off if she was willing to take him in.
come to Ginevra’s party with me afterwards.”
Absently, Harry felt the rolled realgar in his pocket. It was encased in Preservation Charms, and buzzed against the pulp of his fingers. Charlie’s gaze followed the movement.
Again, he was treated with silence. “I don’t understand,” Draco said, frustrated. “Is it because of financial problems? I’ve got loads of gold, if that’s—“
The Shaman reminded him of McGonagall, and Draco was sure she enjoyed his company too, if her wistful smiles at the mention of Draco’s eventual departure were anything to go by.
“You must promise me you will never leave me again, all alone.”
“Sorry,” said Harry easily. “You have a soul?”
All that had happened during the first stage of the cross-country dragon race—a marathon flight from Romania to Kyrgyzstan.
“When it comes to finding your bonded dragon, that's your biggest motive? To complete the race for your mentor?” The Shaman asked Harry. She was only in her forties, yet with a time-worn calmness she looked at Harry. He struggled a bit before it, searching for words. None seemed adequate. “Well ... yeah? I mean, no. Probably not my major motive, but it’s the reason why I’m here. It's the least I can do for Charlie, and I wasn’t actively searching for my dragon before. I was … bumbling about.”
He had to … he had to … Harry thought about Draco. But somehow, surfacing from his memory wasn’t Draco’s twisted face as he suffered an erratic, early change. It was Draco on the weather deck, by the stable, pulling Harry’s weight onto himself. “Not to worry—I’m here,” he’d said, and Harry’s cheek had fitted snugly onto his shoulder, like it belonged there all along.
Harry spots him in the midst of work; he should be focusing on tailing his suspect through this crazy peak-hour throng in Shibuya, should be avoiding whomever might be surveilling him in reverse … except he no longer cares. He follows Draco into a spacious, LED-bright bookshop to wait out the drizzle, which unfortunately, is slowly rising to a crescendo.
“No,” she said, eyes unusually bright. Even though the sun hadn’t risen up enough to rouse the hut, Draco knew it would soon flood the room until their surroundings were awash with colour and sound. “I won’t.”
“But I’ve failed. Why did you still …?”
“What now?” Draco asked. He swiftly shucked his large white body, and got to his feet. He was wearing mismatched, woolly socks underneath his hiking boots.
The Shaman’s thick shell of Protection Charms around her mountain must’ve kept the buffalo Patronus hovering before the Apparition Gate, until it finally found a way in.
Malfoy cocked his head, a gesture that somehow filled the barren caves along Harry's chest with brimming hot guilt. “Oh, Harry,” he said, a dimple ghosting his cheek. He took the cig in between his two long fingers and told Harry happily, “You’re the bee’s knees.”
Harry snorts. “Talk about situational irony.”
She’d hovered like a hawk by the pile of throws and pillows she heaped up for Draco, shooing Harry away whenever he tried to check in on him.
The unease became sharply pronounced when Draco still hadn’t resurfaced about half an hour after his reckless plunge.
Draco laid down the blade. “That wasn’t a logically coherent sentence.”
“Christ, you’re such a prat.” Harry laughed, giving him a peck on the nose. “It’s you. It’s just you that I want.”
accidents in a row, but careful scheming, a planned attack in which Malfoy could easily have been involved, given his rather undesirable past.
hung nonchalantly before Harry—a make-do lantern, bobbing—and it called to Draco as though he were a desperate moth. The mellow orange glow had thawed upon Harry’s skin, his forehead; had melted into puddles against the hard set of his face. And then there were lambent strands of sunset in Harry’s hair, which, when he moved, evanesced like epiphanies.
While Harry, despite his claim, continued to stalk Draco without letting on anything important. He skimmed over the history of dragon-wizard politics with an empty promise that—
Harry was about to say something, when, from behind, the Centaur grunted and coughed loudly. Draco turned around, and saw a shudder spasming across the Centaur’s greyed, blood bay flank. They shared a look. Harry broke into a jog, hurrying back, and held out his arms so that the Centaur could support himself by gripping onto Harry’s elbows.
In times like those, Harry knew he’d see himself exactly as he was—as
Draco sealed the “me” in between their lips. Under the heat, it melted pliantly, and got crushed into a weak “mmph”; Harry felt Draco smirking against the noise. His strong fingers were pressing through Harry’s hair, knuckles deep into the tangle; he tugged, and it felt heavenly.
“How…” Draco wheezed. “It’s a miracle you can find your way back every time.”
He came back stumbling through the glass sliding door, shaky and giggly like a glass of champagne; invited splatters of mud, the fusty smell of cardboard boxes, gusts of rain—all that together, with him, steamrolling into Harry’s flat.
Having wrestled enough Mandrake roots out from their cradles, Harry Silenced them, and moved along towards a coppice of walnut trees, whose leaves were flittering down in a shower of red and gold.
Draco would look strange in any standard—be it wizard or dragon—Harry supposed. There were glittery stripes of scales covering the sides of his neck. Drooping down behind him were two flimsy bat wings. His arms and chest were bulging with lean stripes of muscles all of a sudden. His digits had sharpened dangerously, talon-like.
“No.” Harry snorted. “I did a Downward Dog in a red glowing five-pointed star and performed a satanic lap dance to summon you.”
“Clinging on to the remembrance of things past is the typical act of the spiritually weak, say I,” the young man drawled, but he looked thoughtful. “Yet, most absurdly, my mantra used to be as such: my soul is a grave where I wander and dwell eternally.”
It wasn’t as if Malfoy had been more productive as a team member in general. As their assigned Arithmancer (the last of the pile, Harry wagered), all he did throughout the day was chat with Charlie through the two-way Wireless earpiece, reporting back and forth nonsensical things like “Yulia is flying at 179 mph, southeast of our HoverAid Station, while a 20-knot wind is blowing at the bearing of 340.25°,” or, “The Muggle-repelling shields are functioning just fine,” or sometimes, “No readings, no readings,” when Malfoy simply couldn’t be bothered.
How else?”
“So,” Draco drawled. From the feeble, flickering lamp lights, Harry caught sight of the deepened, mischievous lines on his cheeks. “A berkutchi? How’s she doing? How’re
Wordlessly, Malfoy had sat down beside him, pulling Harry’s weight onto himself. Harry couldn’t resist the safe steering of Malfoy’s hands. Couldn’t resist being held, and being told, “Not to worry—I’m here, aren’t I? Get some kip, Harry.” The lull to sleep was dewy and sun-paved, pillowed by the timbre of Malfoy’s voice.
“That’s a smelly heap of dragon dung and you know it.” Harry sighed. “I was scared—I dunno. I think part of me refused to believe that I deserved the things I wanted. You were there when I asked Madam Cholpon about it, weren’t you? And you heard what she said.”
“I very much can
Harry laughed then, without a particular reason, and could not stop even as they soared up higher. “Dear Lord,” Draco said into his mind, when Harry gave another breathless giggle. “Get a grip, Potter.” Harry wanted to kiss him, so he let his magic do it. A breezy brush that could go easily unnoticed among the blizzard, the snowdrift forming in mid-air, and the strident wind slapping against them from all directions.
“Fine.” Draco harrumphed back. He cast a Sonorus on himself to yell at her, trying to make her understand the danger of infection and sepsis. She grunted noncommittally, scooping from the cask of ointment and slapping it thickly onto her bloodied skin.
Nonverbally, Draco Summoned a bottle of Firewhisky from a nearby Station and two tumblers. Harry laughed as Draco immediately downed what he’d just poured out for himself. Draco then got them both another slosh, but this time, he sipped it slowly.
—the first blast of pistol signalled. Harry swung himself into the saddle, gathered the reins. Beside him were two Fireballs, two Ridgebacks. On the second gun sound, all five dragons kicked off, then with a lurch, they halted in mid-air.
"Harry?"
The Centaur ignored him, propped his forelegs up and stood from the soft spread of leaves by his writing log. Draco suppressed an urge to bolt when the Centaur loomed over them, his wasted torso tall yet crooked, his shadow stinking of alcohol and overnight sweat. Harry gave Draco’s fingers a reassuring squeeze, which only served to startle Draco out of his own skin.
“Knock knock,” Draco says softly, stupefying Harry's legs and lungs with just one swift look: an accurate one; not an inch out of kilter.
“For sure.” Harry was aware of the stirrings of murmur around them, no doubt from the Arithmancers and apprentice Flyers who were listening in out of a sort of malicious nosiness.
“I just don’t want you to go through something that’ll drag you back again.”
Immediately, Draco makes for the impressive rows of stationery, not even bothering to spell himself dry in a covert corner. Silly sweet, Harry thinks, what’s he doing here?
Thinking of Draco, Harry added slowly, “I’ll always prioritise them and my friends. Even though I—my life doesn’t revolve around Draco. I’m afraid it never will, not completely. What I’m saying is, I’m glad you were on his side, wholly, when I had difficulty doing that.”
“They aren’t chains, and I’m not here to arrest you,” Harry muttered in a surly manner. At some point, it seemed that he’d finally found his words, but then trailed off again.
Over the weekend, an unexpected guest has left a message in his recorder. Draco's fingers fly to his speaker just in time to catch sparkles of buzz that tumble out like nervous
Draco simply watched, even though there had been a small spiteful thing digging around inside him.
Harry, too, had wanted to ask the same question when he was at the well, even if he knew that the apparition of Draco’s old magic would not be able to answer. Maybe Draco wasn’t asking Harry now; maybe he was asking himself.
“They don’t.” Harry looked a bit helpless. “They’re just afraid.”
“No.” Harry was horrified. “No it’s—in dragon riding, Flyers mostly apply tack so that they can hold onto the reins, especially during emergencies. You know how dragons are. They aren’t to be tamed, and the regular bits we use will not be remotely painful against their mucosa—they breathe fire, for fuck’s sake. It’s mostly for mutual communication and for the Flyer’s safety.”
Infinitely alarmed, Harry hurried over to get a better look at him. A groan rasped through Malfoy's throat, but then it soon turned into a growl as he tore it out like a bloodied tooth. He was squeezing the juice carton forcefully and its sugary purple liquid spilled out everywhere. Harry crouched over him, tipping his face upwards. His pupils had blown wide into two black discs, leaving only a ring of silver around them.
. “I saw too much of my younger self in Draco that it clouded my role as a Healer, a neutral mediator. I protected him not just because we Shamans take it as our responsibility to protect lost souls, but also …”
There was nothing sweet about Draco, and tasting him, Harry felt idiotic for thinking that he had a sweet-tooth. The lure of the night was cool upon Draco’s skin; Harry pressed his warmth into it, leaning into the kiss some more. It was sweet in Draco’s own un-sweet ways.
The clouds were leaning down from the long, meadowed ridge above, and the afternoon sun had stopped heating the forest floor altogether at some point. Draco’s nose felt numb from the sharp, icy nip, but Warming Charms were still off-limits. They would at least have to walk for another twenty minutes before they entered a wizard-friendly environment.
The dull pulse of magic pushed against Draco rhythmically, stronger and louder as he advanced further down. His own core vibrated in resonance. Eager and throbbing. Draco followed it.
“But,” Harry said, a little confused, “dragons are the ones who make the final decisions. Of course, bonded pairs can communicate without words or physical cues, but Flyers can only offer guidance, and the rest depends on—“
In the garden, there were no rose bushes growing rampantly on his heels today, but the arrangement of the garden was still wildly different from what Harry had once described—a circular path, with the trees on both sides in gradual transition from late summer, to autumn, to winter, then to spring again.
“A list? I would get you a Portkey ticket and a collar with a leash, if you’d let me.”
“Quit yelling! As if you aren’t one of those ‘pervs’,” Draco hisses. “And you look
they could head home.
The Centaur’s voice took on a pleasant baritone, which was completely incongruous with his appearance—all ragged old bones and flabby skin. He continued, oblivious to Draco’s inner turmoil, “Solomonar, do not wander from the circumpolar lights, even when fog comes.”
The rain in Tokyo is never fresh, and Harry feels like an onsen egg in his Muggle three piece suit, in the heatwave, gently simmering—whereas the thunder rolls crisply down from the night sky, untouched by the sticky fingers of the typhoon.
Back in Romania, the Hags, with their leathery wind-dried mouths, had called him a Solomonar—a dragon rider that is, and more specifically, one with a bonded partner. It was the main incentive that had kept Harry searching on, praying that his dragon would simply turn up one day before his doorstep. After all, Hags were always right, weren’t they?
“I won’t kill him,” Harry assured him, a dark sense of humour finding its way to the back of his throat.
She stared quietly at a spot over Draco’s shoulder, expressionless. It was almost like Draco had cast a
“What’s that?” Flicking her gaze down to the cloth-wrapped parcel in Draco’s hands, the Shaman dropped the indulgent smile, her brows knitting tight.
He looked blearily at the scenery beneath: sandstone outcrops lumped and gathered round the shores of Caspian Sea, receding beneath the aircraft; Kazakhstan’s crumbly terrain rolled before Harry’s eyes as if on film. In his peripheral, Caspian’s tide ebbed with a sapphire sway, then back it flowed, with a glittering stroll.
What if—
The tension, previously coiling within Draco’s muscles, slowly drained away. Draco boggled at him. Fucking Centaurs.
Draco laughed. “Of what.”
Draco links the earpiece back into place. The weight of Harry's gaze takes on a curious quality, and Draco knows what's coming.
Harry dipped his face into the Pensieve, and let the drizzly cold breath of the stone basin licked tamely his cheeks … the tip of his nose … then, he was zipped away from the dusty, sun-drenched aisle of the archive room, and right into the midst of the fight.
“No!” Draco stopped Harry before he could yank them both into the strangling vacuum of Apparition. The Centaur hated any unbidden disturbance of magic in his forest ground, and to run the standard health check on him already required extensive cajoling. Draco normally Disapparated once the footpath had brought him far enough.
Harry was terrified, but he crunched tentatively up the Shaman's mountain—a road to somewhere.
“I told you her leopards would be guarding all possible exits.”
A consuming second later, Draco looks away. Carelessly he sends a
Draco gave him an insouciant shrug. “Mountain Trolls are excellent beekeepers,” he said loftily, even though his reaction had been way more indecent just days ago. In
There was a signpost before them, a modified Tempus floating atop it. The glowing dots rearranged into numbers that showed their speed, their team’s ranking so far, and that they could go ahead for the Return, which was to be done one team at a time.
But—Harry was struck by a wild flash of shock. Draco was lovely, he thought, like this. And it was the very first time he found Draco other than … just, Malfoy, even though he’d quitted calling him that for a while.
His relationship with Harry was always disastrous, which he used to relish as a teenager who often trotted proudly about, wearing his inclination towards the melodramatic like a badge. But he no longer retained the blind confidence to fuel him through such things; a Harry-shaped storm might easily destroy him at any moment if he weren’t careful enough.
But—right now, Draco’s gaze is a piercing gimlet, pinning Harry into the sultry density of the night.
“My thoughts?” Harry picked at a thick woollen pebble before him absently. “Er—I sort of adopted this mentality of what will come shall come, because it's how it should be, isn't it? It’s like … finding a soulmate, I've heard. You can’t rush it.”
magic, sweet dear, and I thought you were amazingly hopeless. I must tell you; I was affronted, for you were unfazed by me.”
Once underwater, the scenery became even more bizarre.
Finally, ascending to a plateau where a thin glacier cut through from the middle, they caught up with two other Solomonari—Ivan and Reni, if Harry remembered correctly. Ivan was a first-timer, while Reni had made a name for herself in the previous race. Her performance was stellar in both the cross-country section and the final summit attack, but had been dropped to seventh place for accidentally exposing herself to the ambushing poachers during the Hunt.
of a Centaur’s bow, the whoosh of an arrow, the splash of solid flesh against water … and that the dusty tinge of old dragon magic felt frighteningly similar to Draco’s signature.
“Malfoy—”
“It’s not like we can tell them there are werewolves around, and one of them might or might not have been terrorising the poor horses during full moon,” Draco told Harry, who was dogging him all the way down to the Apparition Gate. “Madam Cholpon told me she normally brewed as much Wolfsbane as she could and would hand barrels of them to their leader, but last month, someone must’ve missed a bolus and turned. She will be checking on them today.”
The dragon stable was a semi-open space on the Station’s weather deck, sheltered only by a free-standing canopy. It meant that wind and rain could gouge about the stalls and turn them into chilly seaside caves during the colder hours.
“I’m not like other saviours.”
“And whatnot?”
The world stills; flooding the hills is the vital sign of hours, minutes, seconds—regurgitated. Harry blocks the sunlight with a hand as he turns to face the forest, burning; autumn has set fire on it, like Fudge’s minions once did to Hagrid’s home, and the land still remembers the cold push of Macnair's axe against its flesh, the land remembers everything.
The parcel lay at the corner of the table, near at hand, literally. Harry picked it up. It was heavier than he thought. Draco was frowning at his feet, visibly deflating; the Shaman was pinching the bridge of her nose, looking drained. Harry cleared his throat quietly to gather their attention, and asked, “What’s the simplest method?”
Draco woke, one morning, his skin grazed upon by an unnamed thrill. A bluish sheen of light was flowing down through the window and towards the foot of his Transfigured bed. The clock sitting on his apple box told him it was five to five. Blearily, he wiggled his toes; they were cold from being left out from the reach of his quilt cover, cold from being soaked in the blue break of dawn.
“Gods, Harry.” Malfoy huffed out a small sigh when he saw him. He leaned closer, head cocked to the side, taking in the way Harry slouched against the metal posts, the stubble on Harry’s chin and the bluish shade beneath his eyes. Then closer—“You’re shutting down like an old Charm. Poor brain.”
Already, Harry had faced rejection from the majority of the dragon population in their sanctuary, although they were mostly oblique about it: a nervous swish of their tail followed by an apologetic nudge on Harry's bum, which he at first mistook for affection. Harry could not be more embarrassed when he finally figured out what they meant.
Draco ran the limited context he managed to garner in his mind again, then again, as he picked up the sabre, re-examining it carefully. “Chains”—they had argued over this word, and Harry had denied whatever Madam Cholpon had accused him of. Harry had also been showing an alarming amount of affection towards Draco today, which had never happened before, and had nearly made Draco lose his mind. Maybe it had. Draco should’ve known better.
“Can we get you anything?” Draco asked as he covertly slid the hard wood of his wand smoothly into his grip. “Water, perhaps? Hangover Tonic? Or something from the farmer’s market?”
Draco shuffled closer, and pressed his nose against Harry’s cheek. It felt warm and wet—Harry was crying silently, he then realised himself, but didn’t know why.
Draco sniggered, huffing out wisps of smoke through his nose. Rather comically, they curled into grey mushrooms before his face. Exasperated, Harry bent down and gave him another peck on the withers, this time doing it properly, without magic. “A Solomonar,” Harry then answered Reni. “Just like you.”
“There is no solid evidence to support this, but it would make perfect sense,” Draco continued, as if he hadn’t noticed the look on Harry’s face. “The herbal filling might have absorbed some of your magic as you smoked the cigarette. When I inhaled the fume in, part of all that was released alongside the realgar powder into my core. With you being my bonded wizard, the combination must've somehow stimulated the transition.”
, I’m not a sociopath. You literally recorded your own voice and charmed it into that cursed thing! Won’t you feel creepy if I let your voice remind me to buy lube every now and then?”
Harry grimaced, marching away in furious, long strides. If he were moving faster, he’d be bolting off into the Arctic tundras in no time.
“Better be on our way, then.” Harry did not phrase it as a question, but Malfoy shook his head jerkily, and backed away from the shelter Harry’s body provided. Back into the wind.
Harry shifts on his seat. Apart from being damp and unpleasant, the timber beneath him scratches through the tight fabric of his trousers, itching at his skin.
The slimy sensation intensified. Harry felt dirty and vulnerable. “Let’s go,” he told Draco hoarsely. Static droned among the mist and gradually towards the underside of their raft—a developing Anti-Apparition field, Harry recognised, and jumped to his feet. He hoisted Draco up, who blinked at him, confused.
“Not much, but yeah.”
“Oh, horrid. Indeed I do not wish to take recourse to philosophy, now.”
“Your mantra might be doing its job for you now, but I’m afraid it won’t last as long as desired,” the Shaman said, shaking her head slowly. She waved her thick hand at her hut; three cool glasses of
“What?” Malfoy snapped, then deflated. “… Oh, no. There’s nothing wrong with me.” Harry glared at him. “I’m simply here for some, ah, academic discourse.”
Through the spruce forest, Draco headed straight down towards the centre of the basin, ignoring Harry and his paranoia. The trees were dense; he could not see clearly through it, but the calling rang loud and clear, and every step forward was a step closer towards home.
“Side-Along me, will you?” Malfoy said, stepping forward. He gripped onto Harry’s elbows with both hands, and as Harry spun them round, he could catch the faintest whiff of medicinal herbs from Malfoy’s collar. It was a bitter smell, almost sardonic, and it reminded Harry of an old, haunted apothecary.
Harry rolled his eyes, lips twitching. “I was really scared, actually.”
The trace was at least a century old, and had faded greatly over time, buried deep beneath the echoing footfall of fae folks. But somehow, it pulled at Draco just as strong as a new tow rope. A dragon heart was lying at the bottom of a lake, wrapped within layers and layers of Protection Charms.
“What were your thoughts then? When you were back in Romania. I assume that was when you were less proactive.”
The crew on board HoverAid had told Harry, stuffing the thin roll of paper into Harry’s palm.
They climbed the heights in zigzags and spirals, so that Harry could physically get used to the insane altitude. Even with the Oxygen-Replenishing Potion coursing reassuringly in his bloodstream, dizziness still lurked in the background.
Madam Cholpon nodded at him briskly, double-checked the prescriptions she’d instructed Draco to deliver later today, and then left the hut without saying another word to Harry. There was a team of possessed horses running amok on a neighbouring hill. The Muggle farmers had come earlier complaining about their trampled fields, and that they needed her to perform a rite of exorcism on those “prancing fiends”.
It was midnight when Harry accompanied Draco back to the Shaman’s mountain. Harry had meant to Apparate back to the Station afterwards, but Draco—all dimples and swollen lips now—insisted that he stay for the night.
“That was a disaster.” Draco is clearly struggling not to laugh as he wipes off smudges of cat treats from Harry’s face.
Draco went on, “I won’t be bothering you day and night if you’re worried about this. I could build a cottage nearby—keep you company, learn your magic, and continue to take care of your people. Isn’t that what you want, too? I have nothing to look back to now. I’ll be mourning for nothing from the past, and I want to live a future that’s mine and only mine.”
He wondered if Harry ever felt good like this, helping people and feeling grand, but that twit was probably too noble to allow himself any ulterior joy from his charity acts.
“Chains.” Draco uttered, carefully releasing the word into the low-hanging silence. He heard Harry knocking off a ram’s horn from its shelf. “Am I about to be arrested? I thought you were a mice-catcher, Harry; not an Auror.”
While dragons wanted to be remembered, wizards chronicled history with their sanctimonious quills. The list could go on.
Draco remembered his third night in the Sanctuary, before the dragon race had begun. The milky way was visible, sprinkling carelessly along the night sky. He wandered along the hills, and found Harry by a dark pond, its face wrinkled by the wind, its ripples streaked silver by the moon. He remembered being jealous.
Grappling at Harry clumsily, Malfoy burrowed his wet face into Harry’s neck. He alternated between whimpers and roars as his bones twisted on itself, reminding Harry of a werewolf during full moons.
Within minutes, Draco is sauntering out again with a plastic bag crammed with sets of stickers, at least a dozen highlighters, a paperback Murakami novel and, still, without an umbrella or a Rain-Repelling Charm
It wasn’t the same for Draco now, but Harry reckoned it wouldn’t be too pleasant to know that an organ of your past self was in circulation, and the next person with a dragon heartstring wand might just be carrying a part of your ex-body.
“Exactly what are you?” Draco presses his forehead against the aftershocks in the glass. Through his monitor spells, he also notices that the currents are rushing every which way, like they are expecting a change, a takeover. There is no way a regular Sea Merx can do this to their environment, even though their magic cores are uniquely phonic: through echolocation, they navigate the vast sea fluently.
Harry smiles. “Assassinating Robards might be a more fundamental treatment for our problems. I’ve heard that he’s retiring soon, though. I’ll request a transfer the millisecond that old fart's gone, I promise.”
“Well, partly, and good strategy on my part to be honest, but you know I could’ve just hexed you.”
“Not your magic, strictly speaking, but a predecessor of it. Just like this heart could be seen as a predecessor of this still-beating one behind your ribs, if my deductions are correct.” The Shaman gave them an inscrutable glance; commented offhandedly, “I told you earlier this morning that ghosts are not the only mechanism that can haunt the Earth, and that to some of us death is a door that would merely lead to another open door, and not an afterlife.”
Harry tapped his wand to cork up the glass flasks one by one. “We’ll see,” he said, as the same brimming hot guilt slid along his throat; like lava, it then pushed its way down towards his stomach, hardening into a heavy rock there.
"Alright …?"
“I don’t understand.”
After the board members authorised Harry's status of a Solomonar, there had been a short hiatus in which they waited for other teams to return from their Retrieve Hunt. It gave Draco enough time to master his skills as an Animagus. Not only that, by the summit day, they’d practised flying together several times, and had learnt how to properly communicate through their bond.
Betty loped across the leaf-paved earth, dropping an apple before him. He picked it up, tossing it up in the air with a bored hand. When the Bicorn snuggled up by his leg, resting happily there, a bemused expression crossed Draco's face.
“… Because.”
It was utterly hypnotic, like an oscillating pocket watch, held by a stage magician.
“Especially dragons,” Harry supplied murderously.
Harry shrugged, and Malfoy continued in that same nonchalant tone, “Just for the record, I’m not fornicating with the devil, even though that might make even better gossip material than what they've got. Those
“I don’t just want that.”
Try as Draco might, not even the penumbra of Harry’s shadow was touchable.
After Draco made sure he had his weekly insulin potion taken and a well-stocked tree hollow, Draco rounded on Harry again. “Well? Don’t keep me in suspense.”
The roses were in full bloom, soft faces blurring together into clouds of orange, woody stems interlacing with their path forward. Strangely, however they tried to circumvent them, the bushes would sneak out from absolutely nowhere to besiege Harry and Draco over and over again. They spent the first fifteen minutes trying to outstrip the overgrowing bushes, sweaty and laughing, until Harry thought to throw himself onto the Mandrake patch, letting the muffled screams of the roots thwart the stalker roses.
Harry’s other hand came looping under his chin—
She sighed. “I don’t think you do, Harry.”
Harry’s dumbfounded. “… Say what?” The splattering downpour easily scrunches up his words, his thoughts; pelts the wood beams and the concrete until the water stains become raised scars, silvery and many, like this cocoon surrounding them, made of silky raindrops. Draco’s voice is a slosh of fresh draught beer splashed through the muddy racket, when he whispers, “Oh my days, it’s really you.”
“You know he’s alright.” Harry was almost tempted to take another drag off the cig. Just to retain that feeling of hope in his body a while longer. To catch another glimpse of heaven, the valley wind, ripe grapes and herbs—things that simultaneously reminded him of Romania and a life he dreamt about.
Harry shrugged, heading down to the Healer’s Quarter without a second glance backwards.
and make sure Harry didn’t end up a complete loser, which Harry currently identified as.
“You told me it’s not worth it,” Draco suddenly said, looking stricken. “It is, Harry. It’s worth more than a try. This is worth everything I can give, anyway.”
There was another tug on his magic core, different from the dragon heart’s. This one was tentative and explorative at first, but Draco had no strength to resist anything anymore. He let it rummage about. The ghost before him was himself. He didn’t understand how it was possible, but there was little doubt as to what it was … who it was ….
Last Draco came, he insisted on “taking a quick peek” at the eye of the typhoon, which was at least half an hour away according to the meteorologists. He stepped out onto Harry’s balcony anyway, barefoot and without an
Then, out of nowhere, the wisp of light drifted faintly forward, grew brighter as it settled before him. The blurry glow gradually took form. A torso … the flat plane of a chest … two arms … a semi-transparent hand, extended towards Draco.
Half shrouded by the dark, the muscles in Harry’s arms and back were strong. All shifting ravines and well-bordered dunes, upon which lake water flowed. Harry had finished cleaning the tack, and was working his way down along Yulia’s forelimbs, scrubbing off debris and the blood of her prey.
But the idea of retrieving the heart was a heady flush—the thought of
“I’m sorry” was the doxy that had been gnawing at the back of Harry’s neck for the past two days. Before the makeshift mattress, Harry rocked on his heels, only managing to get out, “Are you—”
It took them to yell the same word a few more times for Harry to understand.
“You did that just to stop my whinging.”
They were content like that for a while, half-reclining on the lawn, feeling the dampness seep into the back of their trousers, listening to the indistinct chatter and the rapid-fire narration of an ongoing Hunt from a distance.
Harry opens his mouth; no sound comes out.
“Good thinking.”
“But it—” Draco was worrying his lips with his teeth. “But neither of us remembers anything. What’s the point?”
She grazed her thumb along the rim of the bowl, pensive. “I understand if you feel frustrated interacting with me,” she started rather abruptly. “I’ll admit, I’ve been seeing things from a partial view—from Draco’s standpoint, really, and not yours. It wasn’t fair.”
Around them, sunset became an incandescent deluge that flooded the pyramid.
“You did…what? How did the Summoning work, exactly?
Draco wants to tell them,
Tonight might be their only chance in this race to contribute something substantial, but Harry wasn’t too concerned about it. They had so many years ahead of them—even if Draco found his Animagus form off-putting and never made any progress on it afterwards, he could still participate as an Arithmancer, and Harry as an apprentice Flyer.
Harry Transfigured a pile of leaves into a raft, which pressed slowly towards the centre of the lake under the steady push of his Locomotion Charm. Around him were dead tree trunks rising from the water, reaching all the way up into the sky.
“Mandrake, Moly, apples and—”
“You think …?”
Draco chose to return then, his face blank with a false guise of calm. In a dull, drawling voice he asked the Shaman, “How do I know whether your theory is correct? I’m rather fascinated. Are there paternity tests for souls? Or magic, in this case?”
“Not really, I don’t.” Harry inhaled a lungful of smoke. The realgar powder deposited into his magic core warmly. It was a substance chronically toxic to Muggles, lethal to Shapeshifters (if the myths were anything to go by), and psychedelics for wizards. Harry felt it swirl inside him like fine wine in a glass, releasing a bouquet of provocative images.
“Just like that?”
“Because normally,” Draco prattled on, “before their transition, an Animagus would have to undergo a month of realgar micro-dosing during their final stage of training, so the high-level realgar I unintentionally took must’ve served to thrust me through that process—”
Harry took his hand, and predictably, was met with empty air—but from there, a warm current rushed up along his arm to his chest, where it foamed and sizzled in his lungs, then to his entire body, and in him the merciful spell resided.
Easily, Draco slots his final destination against the shape of Harry’s body; his streams of breath searing the skin at Harry’s jaw—like a shaft of sunlight burning through a magnifying glass, or an eye of a storm, lingering, torrid, upon an acre of its favoured land.
, the sliver of his chest an offering to the dragons who stirred up the storm, his glowing skin misty through the V of his bathrobe.
“Fine,” Harry laughed, “let’s go.”
The important thing right now was to make sure that Draco was safe.
Harry’s landlord was not impressed.
At some point, Malfoy even launched a debate about the chicken-and-egg paradox. Probably. Or maybe he was really concerned about barn animals. Harry wanted to focus on contemplating his conversation with the Shaman. What she had told him to do: to be introspective, which did not last long anyway.
were—if, instead of gazing idly into the lake, he were gazing into the Mirror of Erised.
Malfoy took a sip through his straw, eyes wide. “Unless I’m reading into things,” he said, hitching up his shoulders.
“Had your coffee yet?” Harry asked, not unkindly.
“How so?” Draco’s brows were knitted as he stirred the Mandrake root about in one of the bubbling cauldrons.
Softly, she added, “This whole time, for whom have you been searching, Draco?”
In the Shaman’s hut, several cauldrons were placed neatly in a row, simmering above fire pits, with egg timers set up and cast into the bubbling liquid. On the work table, knives were commanded to chop, dice, or slice up potion ingredients upon wood cutting boards, and a tattered tome of Potion recipes shouted instructions from upon a brass book stand nearby.
Draco wasn’t sure if he was allowed to retain this anger. He’d spent the better part of his youth antagonising Harry when all he wanted was to be his friend, and look how far it had gotten him. But still. Harry was not just an idiot, but also a constant reminder of Draco’s inability to do good.
Draco felt his heartbeat speeding up clumsily. Every single movement felt laborious.
“… my soul is a grave where I wander and dwell eternally.” Malfoy’s voice had jolted him out of the depths of his thoughts. Harry glanced up, but Malfoy was paying him no attention. The parchment paper before him was already splashed with messy hand-drawn diagrams and bulks of handwriting—hurried, but still cubed and decidedly upright like miniature Roman temples.
Harry huffed a laugh.
Charlie was watching him with flecks of worry surfacing from those deep-set brown. Harry now understood why Charlie had to call on Yulia’s perspective; dragons were much more perceptive when it came to picking out magic traces.
In short, Harry loves that he can safely hide behind himself at Pride.
The feeling had haunted him afterwards, for years, as though he was constantly living under penetrative lights and invasive scrutiny. He wished there was a way to make sure there wasn’t someone else living in him, because … who knows? The choices he made might’ve never been truly his own.
As Draco makes his way down their research station, he lets a draughty darkness contort around him, morph into one corridor after the next, into staircases that bump past his soles, then a narrow landing, smoothly expanding into a circular observatory lined by glass. There, at the lowermost level, he can catalogue the deep sea by its hues of blue, yet to be named, and wavelengths, old friends travelling from afar with new stories to tell.
"Is this what it is, now?"
“That would never be the case.” Harry rested a hand upon the rope that hung down from the pulley. The texture was rough against his palm, which was already sweaty and itching. If he hauled the bucket back up again, would this shadow of the past evaporate in bright sunlight?
“My past is merely a reservoir of growing pains.” Like that, Draco released his new mantra into the air. In no time, along with the bitter smoke of the burning herbs, it was taken away by the fae folks who strolled down the winds.
her leopards on you.”
Even after Drying Spells and Scouring Charms, Draco still smelled like forest and lake water, yet his own bitter tint of freshly-picked herbs stood out among it—a sprig of wormwood in between Harry’s lips.
There was a jagged scar on the front surface of the organ. It wasn’t mummified and had retained the wet, blood-red appearance under the work of some Preserving Potions. It looked almost fresh, as though it might start beating again at any moment.
When he blinked his eyes open again, Harry’s lips were no longer on his, their hands unfastened—because … well, because it was anatomically impossible. And Harry was on his tiptoes, pressing his cheek against Draco’s neck, murmuring mundane yet potent things in his ear. Telling him he was beautiful, that he was good, that he was his dragon.
“I did,” Draco mumbles, finally lifting his face, allowing a hesitant tug from his cheeks to smooth out the wobble in his lips. “I bought one at Haneda. I just Shrank it so you won’t leave me alone.”
Night had settled into a vast stretch of darkness above Lake Issyk-Kul. Harry Side-Alonged Draco to the campsite as a waypoint on their Apparition multi-jump; he didn’t want to risk the chance of leading some unexpected guests back to the Shaman’s place.
“I don’t think I’ll ever be smart enough to answer that question,” Harry said. “But I do remember something.”
"Physically it was an entirely different person, but it was me nevertheless. I wonder if it’s what my soul looks like? Anyway, I think it tried to touch me, or something, but I passed out. Delicate lungs, you see.”
Harry as a Merman, Draco with low vision. They find each other in the deep sea, where the world ends, and the rest begins.
After that, the Centaur hovered back to his bed of fallen leaves and paid them no notice as they departed. Just off the clearing was a winding footpath that crawled down along a forested slope. They set out for it.
“They aren’t chains.” Harry’s voice was full of anger, also a rare display these days.
Harry unclenched the vents of his lungs, letting oxygen in. Finally, when the back of his neck began to stiffen into the position, he backed away, glancing up.
“Come on, I don’t- I haven’t got any nice outfit for it, really, and I hate parties.”
“Of course, because apparently I have such low self-esteem.”
“Good thing I’m here to save the night,” Draco announces scornfully. Frowning, with one hand he interlinks their fingers in an almost careful manner, and with the other he leads Harry’s hand to his waist; places his own on Harry’s shoulder, as if they were to dance …
Harry laughed. “God, I missed you.” He crowded Draco against the vine-carpeted wall of the stone hut, still grinning. Draco squeezed his eyes shut. They were so close now; Draco could feel the tip of his nose brushing against Harry’s, could feel, as he leaned back against the wall, the dampness clinging onto his hair, seeping into his shirt. The bridge of Harry’s nose was cool, too. His skin was an analogue of the air before dawn, but his ribs were a cage of pulsing Fiendfyre. Draco bet kissing Harry would be like smoking realgar—an ecstatic sunset before the storm.
“Yes, because Giants mostly did the work themselves by warring against each other and Trolls are easy to manipulate, but every bit of a dragon is valuable—profitable. Dragonhide, dragon heartstrings, dragon blood, claws for potion-making and eyes for decoration.”
Malfoy’s lips adopted just the subtlest touch of an upward curve around the straw. As if on autopilot, Harry relit the cig wandlessly. He passed it over to Malfoy. “Have a puff,” he said in a hollow voice. Also on autopilot.
“Fuck, Harry,” Malfoy moaned, “it’s so fucking…nngh, undiluted. Fucking hell. It’s like I’m drinking from your magic.”
The warmth had retreated from his core, but Harry felt like a sandy shore with many sharp seashells trying to burrow into his body, and without the waves to sweep away his pain. He thought of the young man he met at the well, who was also a dragon, and all the other faceless ones before him. “And you asked me what it is that I want,” he said softly.
After Harry had done gawping at the bee-keeping Trolls, Draco led the way towards a clearing that was the only place safe from all the rampant stinging and stamping. He piled the herbal patches and ointments upon a raised rock plateau, which was large enough to contain ten Slytherins on a dance floor. There, pots of honey were laid carefully at the centre, waiting for him to collect.
Their journey from the Apparition Gate to the Shaman’s hut was a short but bumpy one. They had to ride double with Malfoy perching awkwardly on the pillion. Somehow, all other available mounts had refused to come anywhere near them. One of the unfriendly Bicorns even attempted to gore Harry the instant he edged a bit nearer.
“Well, then, where’s my dragon?” He asked, well aware of his petulant tone.
Harry shot a surreptitious glance at him. “There’s a bit of everything in the bag, really,” he said. “A tent. Your tablet and monitor set—you left them in the cabin, and I thought you might want to keep them. Some basic supplies and whatnot.”
“Pet,” the young man said idly, “you ask whether I possess a soul, but that is all I can tell you. The rest, I can show.”
Harry was muttering out loud now.
you.”
Not tearing her gaze away from Draco, the Shaman replied in a careful tone, “Most likely, that wasn’t your ghost. It might be a projection of the magic stored within the heartstrings, and it was merely reacting to your presence.”
Draco shrugs. "If you think it's weird, I can reset it."
“Draco, I thought you said this way’s to the top?” Harry said, once he caught up. Without a word, Draco had doubled back to the fork and jogged down along the right branch. That feeble flicker might die away at any time. Draco was just going to sneak a look, satisfy his curiosity, and
Harry didn't know how Draco did this, making him feel this way just by printing his lips gently against Harry's. Didn't know how this was possible, being so alive, yet so, so vulnerable.
Harry groaned. “Merlin, he’s gonna kill me.”
Harry ignored him, and went on quickly, “It’s natural that you can feel the pull of a dragon heart—that’s where their magic is stored, and your core might still be affected by your partial transformation, which was my fault, by the way, not yours. You’re not responsible for the Shapeshifter myth, either. It’s unpleasant, but it doesn’t mean you have to … react, like this.”
, Potter. I bet if you ever try to escape, Ginevra’s going to set your fanboys
While Harry was being Harry, Draco was rather occupied himself. Was busy strutting along the shores of the lake, showing off his sharp elegant spikes and frost-veiled wings. Yulia, who'd soaked herself in the warm water, snorted at his endless posing, but Draco saw her staring other dragons down whenever they made to approach him.
“Do I?”
“I assumed my saviour status would allow me to cash it in,” Harry grumbles drily, “
From Kyrgyzstan to Uzbekistan, they often found themselves zooming through the maze of vales and along the grey scrappy ridges. Found themselves evolving along the imperfect landscape as they flew.
They chased all the way up the South Face, where Draco and the Ridgeback opened fire on each other. The Fire-Resistance Charm woven into riding suits prevented the Flyers from being harmed by dragon fire, but the sensation had been equally intense.
“Yes.” The Shaman acknowledged with a quick nod. “But it would make more sense if what you recognised within that apparition was your own magical trace, rather than a segment of your entity. This heart,” she poked at it lazily with her forefinger, “is not a Horcrux, as far as I can tell.”
Harry once woke up to the obscenely gyrating pipes on his Windows screensaver; clicked his mouse; decrypted 140 drunken emails and gleaned from their exchanges that he might’ve at one point been pressured into promising Draco a private firework show at Disneyland. During the first night of Draco’s stay, however, Draco spent most of his time trying to encase Harry with his odd-looking limbs, and would drag Harry back under the musky sheets whenever he made for the minibar.
“No,” Draco cried.
“Until they were almost extinct, and had to concede to the terms,” Harry went on, grimacing. “So that the wizarding governments would stop their propaganda and leave them alone. That happened. But the hunting never stopped, even though it was finally pronounced illegal because the wizards realised it wouldn't be a good look in the long run. But in the end the hunting just took on a different name. Poaching.”
Her openness astonished Harry. He thought about all the times she tried to shield Draco from him like a mother dragon protecting her egg. Harry had assumed she despised him because he pushed Draco into the perilous process of an unprepared transformation. Harry supposed it made sense that it was more than just the realgar incident.
Malfoy set up a translation zone around them, so that they could throw English, Kyrgyz and occasionally Russian back and forth during their conversations without concern. Malfoy’s configuring was accurate and neat. There were rarely phrases or concepts that got lost in translation.
"No, no, don’t. I can hear it from miles away, you know, and it’s always quite nice to have someone finally talking back. Keep it, if you want."
Draco Side-Alonged them onto the rounded rim of a forested basin, and Harry stomped down immediately along the slope without thinking. Draco grabbed him by his wrist, exasperated.
doing, my dear? What angelic voice she possesses! When’s she moving in?”
His dragons felt immensely sorry for him. For days he'd been waking up to fresh carcasses of deers and rabbits, all laid carefully before his little cottage; the unanimous verdict within the sanctuary seemed to be that they shall spoil Harry with more dead animals than he normally would’ve liked, but no more than that.
“Yeah, a bit, but what could I do? It wasn’t like I could dose them up with Veritaserum and demand what they meant.”
Draco clambered away from the warm, sturdy plane of Harry’s chest. Too busy doing that, he was unable to suppress a smile when Harry made a noise at the scene before them, accusing—“I thought you were joking about the Trolls!”
“You can’t now, perhaps.” Her gaze pierced directly through Malfoy’s eyes. “But one day, you might find yourself in a position of needing a new one. Be prepared for that. Equip yourself so that you will be able to evolve when push comes to shove.”
There could be only so much coincidence in one day—with the Centaur’s unbidden words, the pull on Draco’s magic and now, the fog, unfolding one after the other smoothly like a theatre play, it reminded Harry painfully of Sirius’s death. Harry himself had walked willingly into a trap, and he was afraid that Draco might be doing the same.
“Dragon Animagi were the first group of people who tried to protect the dragons from the blood sports of their fellow wizards.” Harry came over to the brook, shoulder to shoulder with Draco. They were roughly of the same height. “They set up wards around their habitats, making those locations unplottable to wizards but visible to all dragons who wished to seek refuge.”
