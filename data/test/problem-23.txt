“Well—” he bumped his hand against Draco’s on the table. “He’s very funny, you know, and he lets me talk about work all the time.”
He shifted uncomfortably as Dean threw him an assessing look, his gaze softening after a moment. “I know a little something about what it’s like to realize you have feelings for your best friend, you know.”
“I don’t think it’s insane to contemplate the questions you asked the universe to answer,” she replied.
'Welcome to the Black Parade' by My Chemical Romance is the song mentioned at the concert/the single Harry and Draco listen to when it first gets released
Harry had been terrified, that the weight of what they’d done would infect everything, make every moment thick and loaded. But he had been wrong, yet again. There was still lightness between them—still ease. The shift Harry felt, the frisson of heat low in his belly, the thrumming possibility, it was different (and it was
. But he was also here gently mending Harry’s face, standing so close in this filthy stall. He had also brought Harry here, shared with him this new language, offered him release in the violent throng of thrashing bodies. Harry frowned. What were they to each other, now? His lips parted.
Harry’s knees went fully weak for a moment, but when Draco set him down he found he could stand even straighter than before, and even more of the shake was gone from his fingers.
Draco was out with Greg and Neville when Harry got back after dinner, and the next morning he slept in late, while Harry went flying with Ginny for most of the day. By the time he got back it was late afternoon, and when he emerged from the shower and made his way to the kitchen to search out some food, he found Draco making an afternoon cuppa. He waited in the doorway, watching Draco’s nimble fingers as he shut off the kettle, poured out the water, added two spoonfuls of sugar. He kept staring, silent, his very bones humming as Draco turned around with a smile, took a sip, set his cup down on the table and leaned back against it, crossing one leg over the other.
He closed his eyes for a moment, tipping his head up. The tempo shifted and slowed, tension building, and he flicked his eyes back open, swaying in time with the bodies beside him, anticipating the violent release. The guitars came crashing back in, the lead singer screamed, and Harry felt his adrenaline spike. In front of him, someone shoved the person standing next to them, and a space opened up on the floor. Immediately, it filled with bodies, people pushing each other
It had been a good year. Harry was quite happy to usher in the new one wrapped up in Draco’s arms, out in the garden at Grimmauld again. They were all back under Hermione’s stargazing bubble, getting cheerfully smashed and counting down the minutes to midnight. He twisted his face around, tilting his chin up for a kiss. Draco tightened his arms, obliging, murmuring in his ear, “You’re very affectionate tonight.”
big an idiot of himself for Draco, it would certainly be worth her time to get to know him better. So they sent Glenlivet off with a note after dinner, retiring in front of the fireplace with another bottle of wine.
“Well,” Draco backtracked, “you can certainly leave, if you like. But it’s late, and you’re welcome to stay as well.” He arranged his expression into one that would not betray which of those options he preferred.
“Besides,” Draco flicked his fingers in a quick gesture of dismissal, “I like my men tall, dark, and handsome,” he winked at José, “And Harry here, unfortunately for him, is short, dark, and handsome, and I simply won’t settle for two out of three.”
Malfoy was quicker, and Harry watched him take the first bite, parting his lips, welcoming the succulent pastry into the darkness of his mouth.
Eventually, Draco broke the silence, “So what do you think? People say it’s one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world.”
I know this is mostly an ode to pop-punk, but the mid-2000s were also, in my humble opinion, a golden age for hip-hop, so I was psyched to throw it back for that club scene...
José laughed, and Harry wondered how his teeth could possibly be so white. It would probably be rude to ask.
In the early morning of the second Sunday in July they headed into the San Francisco International Portkey Station, the bike and their bags and everything they had bought shrunk down into their traveling cases. In the station, Harry's throat went tight as a wave of melancholy flooded his chest. He didn't want this time with Draco to end—it was silly, he knew, since it wasn't like he wouldn't spend time with Draco once they got home. But he didn't want to leave the bright sun of the beach, didn't want to go back to sleeping in his room alone. Before the Portkey activated, Harry drew Draco into a tight hug, as if he was seeing him off, as if they weren’t going together. Draco huffed and squeezed him back, and Harry murmured, gruff into his ear, “Happy birthday.”
too tired for sex, but he had been looking forward to having Harry in his bed, curled around him, warm and comforting.
He snorted, stretching his legs out on the sofa and poking his toes into Draco’s thigh, “Yeah, perfect.”
When they had shown up arm in arm, tattoos and piercings on display, hair sideswept and spiked, muggle suits pressed, the media and assembled guests had gone wild. There had been an absolute firestorm when the tabloids had gotten word of the fact that Harry was bi a few years back, but he had always refused to comment on his personal life and had never taken a date to one of these events. So, the fact that he was making his debut with a man, a man who happened to be Draco Malfoy... well, it was a bombshell. (Harry might have conveniently left out that they were there as friends, just to fuck with Rita Skeeter specifically.) Harry had smirked all night and given a speech on the importance of tolerance and open-mindedness in all corners of wizarding society. After that, he took Draco as his date to any fancy event, and Draco did the same.
“Fair enough,” Ron grinned at him as they stepped off the pavement where Harry had parked his motorbike, “And who knows, you’re the one who said you might find your own hot healer?” Harry made a noncommittal noise as Ron clapped him on the shoulder. “Thanks for coming with me tonight, mate. I think we did good work.” Ron drew him into a one-armed hug and apparated away.
all the way down the stairs. But he hadn’t ever seen Malfoy in muggle clothes; he was always wearing his uniform robes when Harry visited the shop. He’d put on a nice pair of trousers, the sort that hugged his lean legs in a very inviting way, and a dark forest green jumper that was probably made of cashmere or something equally luxurious—Harry didn’t know much about fabrics, but it looked very soft, much softer even than the walls in Malfoy’s flat. His fingers ached to reach out and touch it, touch Malfoy. And
, she had said before she began chanting, so Harry couldn’t really blame her. He loved Reading when it stormed, everyone slick and uninhibited, the rain cool on his skin. Then again, he loved Reading when it was dry too, so he wasn’t complaining.
! Oh my god, Harry, I can’t believe…” Draco let out a slightly hysterical shriek of laughter and took another swig. “He told me to see a fucking mind healer. He honest to Merlin was like
He was gorgeous; there was no getting around it, no point even trying. Distinctive, with his pale coloring and facial piercings and tousled, sideswept hair, his tattoos and tight jeans. Not everyone’s cup of tea, to be sure. But he drew the eye. Men were always interested in Draco. Women too, although he was never interested back. And José wore his good looks with the sort of effortlessness that betrayed a very concerted effort, so Harry wasn't surprised that he would have a keen sense of aesthetic appreciation.
Harry grinned mischievously as he turned the handle, stepping back into the hallway. “Haven’t you noticed, Draco? I’m
nice, putting their lips together, tucking himself in under Draco’s arm on the couch, wiggling his toes under Draco’s thighs, leaning into him at the bar. All of that felt good and right, and it was even more than he shared with his other friends, Harry knew that. He knew he felt
Draco nodded tightly, crossed his arms protectively over his chest. Here it was then. It was all going to come out now, why Draco was so stuck on Potter’s little jokes, why he had reacted so excessively just then, and it was almost funny, really, because Draco had kept his head down and buried his attraction to Potter for
Draco nodded, heading toward the refrigerator. They had the hangover routine down pat by now—Harry cooked something terribly unhealthy and Draco made a smoothie loaded with fresh fruit—a habit he had brought back from California, an attempt at nutrition and hydration.
Greg shrugged and took a hit, squinting at José. “You know what’s not polite? Coming here on 4/20 when you don’t smoke…” he shook his head morosely. Harry and Neville broke out in twin peals of laughter.
“How can you—” He looked down at the tabletop, twisted his fingers. “I know him better than either of you and I’ve never once thought—”
“God, yeah,” Harry slumped against the doorframe, running a hand through his hair, “Massive smuggling ring bust, loads of inventory and paperwork to sign off on, warrants, intake, the lot of it—I’ve been in the office for sixteen fucking hours, Malfoy, I am— I am
“What the fuck was I thinking? Draco, what—how did you let me agree to do this? Is it—fuck, it’s too late now, I’m going to lose my head completely! What if I forget my lines and end up spouting off about blibbering humdingers? What if I sick up all over Hermione’s dress? What if—”
Finally, Harry moved over him, Draco letting out an appreciative sigh at the feel of Harry’s skin on his.
rang out, Draco slid his hand into Harry’s and squeezed. Harry squeezed back, looking straight ahead, blinking into the blinding stage lights. The day the single dropped on Myspace Harry had pulled it up on the modified muggle computer they had managed to rig up in one of Grimmauld's back rooms. Draco had been leaning on the wall waiting for it to load, chewing a fingernail in anticipation. When it ended, he cleared his throat and said lightly,
“Listen,” Eric said, “If you want to get out of here when you’ve finished your drink, I don’t live too far… I’ll make it worth your while,” he winked.
“My turn,” Hermione declared, setting down her drink and sitting up straight, leaning over to poke Harry in the chest, “Harry, you’re an idiot—”
“No,” Potter responded, “No, you’re— good, it’s just, you know, I haven’t done this before? And I don’t want to make an arse of myself, I meant what I said before—” he looked down, chewing his lower lip for a moment before forcing his gaze back up, “You can tell me what to do, a bit, if that would be—”
Harry brought his fingertips up to ghost against Draco’s chest, spread them wide, flattened his palm slow as molasses. “I feel it.” He let the weight of his hand settle slightly and felt Draco’s breath hitch. “Draco, I feel it. I feel it, but it’s ok if you don’t or if—”
“Very well,” Healer Andrade chuckled and turned to Harry, “Good morning, Mr. Potter,” his eyes slid to the cot and back, “I didn’t expect to be seeing you again so soon.”
“Oh,” Draco’s mouth fell open. That hadn’t occurred to him. Or rather, it had, but only in the secret thoughts he indulged in occasionally when he went to bed alone, wondering how Harry’s day had been.
Draco’s mind and body snapped back together, heat flooding through his veins. He lifted slowly off the table, straightening up to his full height, looking down at Harry, waiting.
But Harry grinned crookedly, “No, not at all, just it’s one thing being alright with muggles and another thing, shagging them in the loo.” Draco sniffed, pleased. “Besides, why even go to muggle pubs? Surely there are wizarding places? You’re, you know,” he gestured up and down at Draco, “fit and,” he hastily gulped some of his drink, “and you’re actually not half bad to talk to.”
Harry shook his head in exasperation, laughing as he dried his hands, “You lot really won’t give up, will you?” He lobbed the crumpled towel into the wastebasket. “Did you grill Draco about his holiday history too? Has he confirmed to you that he doesn’t want us to be
“And you’re so predictable,” Draco shrugged, grinning. “Here, allow me to hasten your journey out of the maudlin phase and into the
Susan’s birthday was at an old divey pub in wizarding London, the kind of place with grimy windows and a repurposed muggle jukebox in the corner. The bartender was an old, gruff woman with spiky hair; the drinks were strong. Harry was distracted, gaze flickering towards the doorway incessantly, compulsively, like scratching an itch. When he finally saw Draco’s blonde head bob through the door he felt a wave of relief immediately followed by a wave of nerves so strong it bordered on nausea. His head spun. When Draco crossed the room to him, Harry pulled him into a hug, recklessly pressing the side of his face into Draco’s neck.
good, do you know that?” Harry punctuated this with a single hard thrust. “Fuck,” he groaned, burying his head in the curve of Draco’s neck, teeth grazing against the soft spot under Draco’s jaw. “It’s honestly unfair, Draco, it’s—”
Harry snorted as he righted both himself and the cot, as Draco was saying, “Am I so lucky to have you assigned as my healer?”
An hour later found them squeezed into a small booth with Ron and Hermione. Draco’s thigh was pressed up against his, and Harry’s arm was slung round the back of the bench, his fingertips grazing Draco’s shoulder whenever one of them moved. He felt warm and content, remembering how Draco had leaned in and asked Harry back to his flat last year, and thinking about what he could say to Draco at the end of the night. Ron was asking Draco enthusiastically about gay wizarding clubs, kicking Harry’s shin repeatedly under the table and saying “eh?” in an increasingly suggestive manner.
“We’re doing this,” He brushed his fingers through Draco’s fringe, trailed them over his cheek, settled his palm, warm and possessive around the curve of Draco’s neck. “We’re definitely doing this.”
He was grateful Malfoy had remembered to suggest it once they were down in the pit. The music was so loud, Harry could feel his sternum vibrating. He wanted to thank Malfoy for the suggestion, but he would have had to scream in his face to be heard, and he didn’t really fancy that. Anyways, he was too focused on everything else happening. Malfoy had woven them through the crowd up towards the front of the stage, and now they were packed in close enough that the air felt humid. A slimy, sweaty arm was rubbing up against his, and people kept stepping on his feet. Someone had cheered a little too enthusiastically right as the band came on and sloshed their beer all down Harry’s side.
He broke off. Potter hadn’t started that. He was still on the wall where Draco had left him, wild-eyed, chest heaving. Draco had slammed him into the wall. He had grabbed his face and stuck his
Draco awoke slowly, to a snuffling sensation along his neck. He opened his eyes slowly, cautiously. A wild nest of black hair was tickling his chin and attached to it was a mouth trailing down his neck—Harry’s mouth. Harry paused at Draco’s collarbone and nipped gently, and Draco inhaled sharply. The nest of hair tilted up and back, and bright green eyes looked down on him, twinkling mischievously.
“Was it going to California?” Hermione cut in, her tone decisive and knowing, “A romantic getaway… Getting to know Draco’s past like that… Sharing a bed in that, shall we say,
The Ministry Halloween party was an extravagant affair, held in the atrium. In the post-war years, there had been a push to encourage costumes in the muggle tradition, and now the Muggle Liaison Office played a major role in the planning. Harry and Ron had dressed as muggle policemen, in embarrassingly tight
, exactly, or at least not on his own behalf—shouldn’t José want to see Draco’s home? It was a pretty nice home, after all. Harry had worked hard on the restorations and Grimmauld Place was comfortable and well-lit and harbored far fewer cursed objects these days.
Harry huffed, covering his face with his hands and groaning, “Yes, I’m going to a muggle music show with Draco Malfoy.” He peeked out through his fingers, “Am I insane? Is this a terrible idea? I don’t know what I was thinking, he just asked, and I said yes—”
“A bit stupid! A bit–!” Harry threw his hands up and raked them through his hair, emitting a strangled sort of noise. “Everyone on the team makes fun of me, d’you know that? How fucking desperate I am to get your attention, how much of a fool I’m willing to make of myself,” he laughed again, slightly hysterical. “I thought if I made it so painfully obvious you’d have to crack eventually—I see how you look at me sometimes when you think I’m not paying attention, you know—I thought if I acted absurdly enough you might finally react, and instead I find out you actually deluded yourself into thinking that I’ve just been
“I mean it,” Harry said, “I never said that; those were Ron’s words, he’s drunk you know—” He ran a hand through his hair. “I didn’t say that; I just said that it was a bit… messy. Which it was!” he finished plaintively.
Harry Potter desperately wanted Draco Malfoy to be his friend. He could hardly believe it himself—Malfoy, of all people. Of course, Harry had known that Malfoy had changed after the war, everyone knew that, but Harry still hadn’t expected to want to be his
—he heard himself make a distressed sound, a high panting whine, and that was a relief because maybe Draco would hear him and realize that he was paralyzed, and he would know what to do like he always did. Everything would be ok, if Draco could hear him; he would take care of him, Harry just
“Want me to shove my head up your arse, Potter? Want to try right now? I know where you keep your lube, I’ll just pop inside—”
He swiveled around to see a man smiling at him. He had a friendly-looking face, all freckles and crinkly hazel eyes. Harry considered him. Maybe this was just what he needed.
Finally, no more Potter. No more Potter showing up late for Friday morning team meetings, dashing in with his jumper crooked and his hair on end, a half-eaten energy bar in hand. No more Potter rolling his eyes and signing off on whatever papers Draco shoved under his nose without reading them, then storming into his office two days later insisting that he would never have agreed to that photo shoot with
and Luna had regarded him steadily for a moment and then drawn him into a hug, and he had buried his face in her fresh-earth-after-the-rain-smelling hair and taken a few shuddery breaths. But what really got the waterworks going for him when he stopped to think about it was that they had asked him to officiate, because they couldn’t agree whose side he would stand on otherwise.
“Oh,” he exhaled, “This is much softer than the wall. I don’t think I’ve ever felt something so soft.”
again, so he dipped back in to kiss Draco on his mouth, plush and tasting of lemons, and under his ear, velvety like the skin of a peach, and down his neck, hot and damp with sweat.
she positively swelled with indignation—she was a junior editor at Witch Weekly, so she took it a bit personally on top of the insult to Draco’s character—and offered to run an assortment of vicious hit pieces speculating about various aspects of Potter’s personal life. At the end, she sat across from him, knees touching, took his hands in hers, made him say five things he liked about himself, and then take ten deep breaths with his eyes closed. And when he opened them, she told him that it was time to snap out of this funk, no more feeling sorry for himself, she’d be damned if he ruined New Years by moping about pathetically, and frankly, Potter wasn’t worth it, the speccy git, and there were going to be loads of better-looking blokes at Blaise’s that night, so he had better take a shower, for Merlin’s sake.
Draco toured Harry around the campus at the Los Angeles Institute for Research of Dark Objects and Occult Magic (or the
The morning of Christmas Eve, Draco awoke to an insistent scratching on his window. He’d declined to go to France again this year, preferring to wallow in equal parts self-pity and self-loathing. He’d resolved instead to spend the holiday in bed, getting drunk, just as he had the previous year, only this time he got a couple of days head start. There was something poetically just about it. The seasons might pass but he was still Draco Malfoy, and he always would be, and it wouldn’t do to forget it. No one else would, after all.
Draco wrinkled his nose, “Absolutely no class in this joint, honestly—Blaise, at least spare a bit of our dignity, would you?”
“Of course you didn’t,” Harry said brusquely, “because I didn’t tell you. I was afraid to tell you. He called me a coward, just now at the bar. I’ve fucked up everything haven’t I?” He looked desperately at Hermione.  She reached across the table gently and took his hands in hers.
Back at his flat, Draco showered, brushed his teeth, dressed carefully (fitted grey trousers and a slate blue cashmere jumper that brought out his eyes), fixed his hair, brushed his teeth again, contemplated a quick whiskey—though it was only 11 am—but ultimately decided against it when he realized he would have to brush his teeth a third time. He walked into the sitting room. He looked at the fireplace. He took a deep breath, and, before he could think better of it, stepped into the flames. He emerged into a dim parlour. Before he could take in any of it, Harry was striding towards him—it appeared Draco had caught him pacing back and forth across the room. His hair was a wild mess, of course, and Draco noticed his socked feet, of all things—another strange new intimacy, this year, seeing Harry Potter in his home, in his socks, on Christmas Eve.
“Boys!” Hermione shouted, “I, for one, would like an answer as to whether the universe takes wishes literally,” she turned to Luna, who blinked serenely and said, “I imagine it couldn’t hurt to clarify… Gregory, did you mean your wish to be taken literally?”
Harry clambered half up onto the bed next to Draco, brushing out the fine, soft strands with his fingers, sweeping the long fringe across his forehead.
all throughout the house, and then the rest of the album as well. At work, they refused to go out and do any recon or recovery, unwilling to take the risk that some complication in the field might muck up their plans for the night. Finally, after a long day of air guitar and finger-drumming on the desks—
Harry thought about Malfoy a lot. The sound he had made when Harry pushed into him, and how Harry had looked down and
Harry squared his shoulders, pointing at Draco across the room and wiggling his shoulders as his cracking voice rang out, “
Harry turned back toward the hob. “Don’t think you can curry sympathy with me when you’ve had morning sex and I haven’t. You know the rules.”
Getting ready for work the morning after Potter's overture, Draco tried to work out how royally fucked he might be. Truly, he was surprised that Potter had come to his office. He had, of course, been avoiding Potter like the plague. Much to his own chagrin, he’d been aware of Potter’s rough schedule for about a year now, on account of having a gigantic crush on him, so that was finally put to some good use by allowing Draco to effectively evade Potter in the Ministry cafeteria and the break rooms and the hallways and the atrium and the queues by the lifts. He’d known it couldn’t last forever. But he’d hoped that seeing less of Potter would help him move on. He certainly hadn’t expected Potter to ask to be
Harry looked up, catching Draco staring and throwing him a crooked grin. Draco stomped on the urge to cross the garden and ravish him where he stood.
Draco did buy the next round, and Wood was quite cordial to him after that. Of course, everyone else at the table was delighted that Potter had brought him along, particularly when he absolutely decimated the other teams in a round of questions on British League history. Wood appeared to be some sort of quidditch savant, spouting off statistics and rosters and all-time great plays with a truly insane gleam in his eyes. Or perhaps he was extremely sane and Draco was just biased. In any case, Draco was soon significantly more drunk than he usually got at trivia and expending a considerable amount of his mental energy avoiding looking at Potter and ensuring that their arms didn’t touch whenever either of them moved. In his distraction, he missed an obvious question on the prehistoric troll wars and, frustrated, got up to go to the bar again. To his even greater frustration, Potter joined him. He bumped their elbows together as they were waiting on their drinks, and Draco stiffened.
When he was ready, he kept his eyes locked on Draco as he positioned himself, sinking down. He wanted to see it across Draco’s face, that ecstasy so sharp it shares an edge with distress, writ in the soft
, you’ve got something good with this one…” He laughed again, shaky as the low buzzing in his limbs started to fade.
, Potter, and leave me the fuck alone.” Potter was panting wetly around his fingers and Draco pushed further back towards his throat, wanting to make him gag, wanting to feel his breath stutter, “I’m not your fucking
As they headed back out, Harry asked, “What was that, by the way? With all the—punching? Is that normal?”
Harry drew back, elbowing him gently in his ribs—the non-injured side. “Course I missed you, you prat. Now come on, food’s here.”
'I’m Not Okay' by My Chemical Romance is the song they're singing while jumping on the bed on the night Draco moves into Grimmauld
By the end of February, Harry had started to wonder whether he might need to find another date to Ron and Hermione’s wedding, after all. Draco and José had been dating six weeks and by all accounts it was going well, although José hadn’t been to Grimmauld yet. He lived alone, so he and Draco always went back to his flat. Apparently, that was preferable to a house with a roommate, two cats, and a floo that was liable to shoot friends through without warning at all hours of the day and night. Was Harry, possibly, the teensiest bit offended that José hadn’t asked to come over yet? Possibly. Well, not
When his thigh muscles started to protest and he felt the knife edge of a cramp developing in his right lung, Harry stumbled off the floor, depositing his aching limbs in a fold-out chair. Damn, he should have stopped at the bar for a water first; he was parched. He interlaced his fingers behind his head and leaned back, his eyes immediately finding Hermione and Ron. They were breaking it down in the middle of a circle of cheering friends, Hermione with her arms in the air, head thrown back, shimmying her shoulders, Ron bent low at the knees, twisting his hips and pointing his fingers at her, catching her around the waist, the two of them whirling together, mouths open, rapturous.
“I dunno what game you’re talking about,” Potter gasped, breathless, “but I think I’m winning right about now, wouldn’t you say—” and he was still
Draco looked over at Harry across the back garden at the Burrow. He was lounging against the low garden wall, chatting with Ron, his hair mussed and sticking to his sweaty forehead, a smudge on his glasses. When he lifted his beer to take a swig, Draco could see a dusty scrape on his elbow from when he’d gotten a bit rowdy during their pickup quidditch game earlier and crash-landed out of a dive. They weren’t teenagers anymore, Draco kept trying to tell him.
“Oi!” Neville broke in, “It’s not just the shagging! It’s all the…” He waved a large hand vaguely at them, “Compatibility. I wish you would shag
Malfoy smiled then, his teeth extremely white, shining out of the raw inside of his soft mouth, and he said, “I’m so glad, Potter.”
Harry came slowly into consciousness, his first clear thought a resounding rejection of the concept of being awake. His head pounded, his tongue was glued to the roof of his mouth, his stomach roiled, and Merlin, he couldn’t breathe—he blinked his sticky eyes open to a faceful of fluffy white fur.
It was already the best Christmas Draco had had in years, and when said it out loud, Harry looked at him all soft and sleepy-eyed, and said, “let’s go to bed.”
, but he had let his hair loose so it hung around his face, grazing his jaw, and Harry was finding it increasingly difficult to think about anything other than twisting his fingers through those luminous strands.
” and as he started coming, Harry followed him over the edge, and then they collapsed on the mattress together into a sweaty, sticky mess.

“Gorgeous,” Harry murmured again, sinking his fingers in, “you have no idea how much I’ve thought about this… getting you ready for my cock, fucking you,” Draco’s hips jerked back, and he moaned, “I’m ready, Harry, come on.”
Inside the building was close, and dark, and the ceiling was lower than Harry expected. He wasn’t sure what he had expected, really, but certainly something larger? They’d walked down a short, cramped staircase and emerged at the back of a poorly lit room, with a grimy bar on one side and a stage at the front. The floor in front of the stage was sunken into a shallow pit, fenced in on the sides and filled with scrappy looking kids around Harry’s age—most of them, he noted with satisfaction, wearing black. They stood there for a moment, Malfoy stiff and Harry unsure, hands in their pockets.
He stayed for a few moments, swaying on his feet, catching his breath, and then he slid his arms under Harry’s torso, leaning over to fold himself over Harry’s back, “Are you alright?” he murmured, and Harry nodded, slurring,
, so he had simply resolved to be very friendly and amiable when he saw Malfoy next, and then they could get back on alright terms. The trouble was that he hadn’t seen Malfoy since.
. And then, the unthinkable happened. Draco leaned around the bloke grinding up on him to yell in Harry’s direction, “I’m hungry!”
They had a shot, and Draco, feeling warm from the whiskey and Potter’s undivided attention, cracked a joke about how it was even more depressing to be alone on Christmas, and Potter said, “Isn’t it? I’m surprised you haven’t asked me back to yours yet—" and broke off, coloring.
From Big Sur they kept north, heading to San Francisco, where they spent three days before their return portkey to England. On the first night, the sky was lit up with fireworks over the Golden Gate Bridge, and a drunk woman on the street stumbled into Draco and slurred at him that they were celebrating their victory over the Brits. Draco drew himself up to his full height and very politely told her to fuck right off into the sea, Harry tugging him away and snickering. During the days they walked the steep hills of the city, narrow wooden houses brightly painted, tall and thin and stacked close together. They rode the quaint-looking cable cars and poked around head shops and ate artisanal vegetarian food. Draco took Harry to the Haight-Ashbury, where the hippies and queers had held court, making way for Harry and Draco to show up on their streets decades later, intact, at ease.
“Yes,” said Harry. He threw some money on the table and got up, wobbly on his feet, reaching out for Malfoy’s arm.
Harry awoke in his bed, still dark, the first fingers of dawn creeping over the horizon. He was sprawled out over Draco, a leg and an arm thrown possessively across his body. He raised his head up slightly, watched the steady rise and fall of Draco’s chest. Lifting his arm, he trailed his fingertips over the hawthorn branches inked under Draco’s collarbone, the runes stacked on his sternum. They’d slept together, here, last night. He brought his fingers up to Draco’s slack mouth, touched his parted lips, the soft skin high on his cheekbone, the blue lid of his eye. Draco stirred, mumbled an indistinct noise, turned toward him.
He was flushing, and he looked a bit twitchy, nervous even, which Draco wasn’t used to, so, unable to think of anything else to do, Draco joined him as the chorus swelled, throwing his hands in the air and shouting the words, feeling the stress of the week leak out of his muscles as he summoned his wine and they danced around the kitchen.
It was brilliant. Everyone was shouting, and Harry was shouting too, and no one could hear him over the music. Everyone was jumping and flinging their limbs around and Harry lost himself in the tangle, jerking his shoulders and shaking his head with the rise and fall of sound, just another writhing body. He was grinning uncontrollably, wide and open-mouthed, and yes, this had definitely been a good idea, how could he have ever thought this was a bad idea?
Draco allowed himself to be led, still unsteady on his feet, up a flight of stairs and into Harry’s bedroom. He let Harry maneuver him onto the bed, where, still limp, he closed his eyes as Harry undressed him slowly, lifting each of his limbs in turn as he divested Draco of his clothing piece by piece. Draco finally fluttered his eyes open when he felt Harry move off the bed, and he watched as Harry stripped himself equally slowly, staring at Draco the whole time, intent, hungry.
“Draco, baby, shh, it’s alright,” she murmured, and then pulled back, looking him dead in the eye. “It’s true.” Draco made a half-formed questioning noise, and she shook her head. “I’m serious Draco. You know I would
Draco made a soft noise, tilting his chin forward, and their lips met. The kiss was tentative at first, and then desperate. Harry pressed Draco bodily against the wall, fisting his fingers in Draco’s hair. The blood left Draco’s brain shockingly quickly, leaving him dizzy and breathless, and before he knew it, Harry’s hands were at the buttons of Draco’s trousers and he was gasping, “Please, Draco—can I—”
Harry laughed nervously, eyes darting to the floor and back up, “Well you’re always all—” he gestured at Draco’s sharp suit, “tightly buttoned, and like, when I don’t fill out my equipment reimbursement forms on time, or when I’m rude to the press, or something— you get all—” he flushed, “frustrated and stern about it.” He sucked in a deep breath, “It’s um, it’s really hot?”
Malfoy grinned, “Oh, I might have just the thing for you—are you willing to be my lab rabbit tonight?” Every so often Malfoy let him test new products in the evenings after he closed up. They would draw the shades and sit on the shop floor, giggling and passing a bag of crisps back and forth.
Harry huffed a fond laugh, kissing his way to Draco’s ear and whispering in it, “Turn over, I want to fuck you.”
Harry’s eyes stung. It was too smoky in here. The silence felt thick, anticipatory. No one moved. Harry felt a faint buzzing sensation, a tickle on his skin that he couldn’t scratch, a sound too low to make out, a ripple wavering just outside the edge of his vision—he broke the moment.
problem either, apparently. Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy in three years, not since the trials after the war. He’d testified on Malfoy’s behalf—his mother too—shared what they’d done for him at the end and argued for leniency. He’d gotten what he asked for—the Wizengamot gave him everything he asked for, that summer. Malfoy had been acquitted and promptly fucked off to America, apparently to pursue his Mastery in Curses and Dark Arts. Now he had been at Gringotts a year already, meaning he had just graduated his own trainee period. Just in time to supervise Harry for three months. Harry gritted his teeth.
“I mean, I just don’t know what to think!” Draco continued, “he fucks me, then acts like he wishes it never happens, then asks to be friends, then asks me to call him Harry and when I do he about has a heart attack, then he shows up to this party ogling me all night—it was
Ron snorted, “It’s obvious why, innit? You’re a bloody idiot and you’re actually scared he might not feel the same way.”
“No, you don’t get it—” He shook his head, swallowed. “Just because you’re always on us about getting together, and just because I might have realized some things, doesn’t mean that Draco’s going to magically wake up and be in love with me or something. It’s the same between us as it’s always been... Just, a bit trickier for me now, I guess. That’s what I need advice on. I decided I want to tell him. I want to see if he’s interested, but I keep chickening out and I don’t know why.”
Slowly, carefully, he wordlessly summoned his wand, and then two vials of hangover potion from the medicine cabinet, trying his utmost not to disturb Potter. He’d just managed to uncork his vial and tip it back when Potter started to stir, groaning. Draco tightened his grip around Potter’s torso, dipping his head to nose at the back of Potter’s neck, trailing his lips along to softly murmur “good morning” in Potter’s ear, then gently nipping his earlobe. Potter made a pained noise, and Draco quickly brought the second vial of hangover potion around. Potter swallowed, heaved a couple of deep, deliberate breaths, sighed in relief, and then—went completely stiff in Draco’s arms.
Draco signed gratefully as he shut his office door behind him, scrubbing his hands over his face and loosening his tie, stalking over to the corner cabinet and pouring himself a finger of scotch. He drained it and sagged into the dark leather wingback chair behind his desk, running a hand through his hair, tipping his head back, allowing his eyelids to droop.
And then the music started, and Harry was caught up amid the sweaty press of bodies, alongside Malfoy. Draco Malfoy, who had tormented him and his best friends, espoused the worst sort of prejudices, sworn allegiance to a genocidal fascist. They had fought on opposite sides of a war, saved each other’s lives, and here they were, shoulders jostling together, arms in the air, shouting
Harry clenched his teeth against yet another reminder of why he had ended up here, sad and alone at the bar, left ogling his best friend because everyone else in the world just wanted a piece of
Harry wanted to find out, but his body wasn’t yet responding to commands, suspended in the amber of half-wakefulness. Draco made a soft noise, blurred with sleep. His arm tightened over Harry’s chest and his hips rocked forward, and the low buzz of
“Of course he looks good,” Harry muttered, “Tosser always looks good.” He allowed his gaze to roam up Draco’s long legs—the skinny jeans left very little to the imagination—over the sway of his narrow hips, the sharp planes of his back, his tattoos visible through the fine mesh of his shirt.
Harry had looked up at him silently, jaw set tight. Draco reached out, wrapping his fingers around Harry’s and shifting off the wall to knock their shoulder together, drawing Harry back with him.
“Oh yes it is; you’re just embarrassed to be caught out in front of this lovely gentleman—” he flashed a winning smile at Healer Andrade, who was watching the exchange with the vague alarm of an authority figure who hadn’t yet figured out how to intervene.
“Come around then,” Malfoy strode out from behind the counter, beckoning Harry into his seat. “Make yourself at home and I’ll close up.”
By the time their names were called, Draco was properly sozzled and more than ready to unleash the Rihanna impression he had been working on in the shower since the year 2005. Harry grinned at him as they clambered up, handing over a microphone and winking.
“Excuse me?” Draco spluttered, “We’ve been dating four months; how could you possibly think that question is appropriate?”
“You do that,” Draco replied, spinning Harry around so they were face to face, winding his arms around Harry’s neck, leaning down and weaving his head side to side, body undulating like a snake, smirking at Harry and crooning,
.” And Harry said, “Right,” and took a swig of beer, and then when Malfoy walked in a couple of minutes later Harry loudly called him over to their table and told Ernie, who was in charge of teams, that they would both be playing on Hermione’s team that night. Most everyone in earshot raised their eyebrows at that, including Malfoy himself, but Harry just shrugged and scooted over to make room next to him in the booth. Malfoy was fantastic, and they won, and at the end, Hermione (after a whispered conversation with the rest of the team while Malfoy had been at the bar) graciously asked Malfoy whether he’d like to join their team, and he accepted in a rather stilted, formal manner, but Harry could tell he was pleased. Harry didn’t mind at all that Hermione hadn’t asked
Potter wrapped his arms around Draco’s torso and lifted him upright, back flush against Potter’s chest. Intertwining their fingers, he braced Draco’s hands against the wall above the headboard and thrust in again, a little harder. Draco gasped and whined, and Potter wrapped an arm around his chest, nuzzling into the crook between his neck and shoulder.
pretty. “Yeah, I mean it,” he paused, cocking his head to the side and meeting Malfoy’s gaze head on. “Do you want to fuck me?”
“No speech this year,” Draco said, squeezing Harry’s hand hard and digging deep to keep the tremor out of his voice, “Just this.”
Draco’s breath caught and he looked down at Harry, trailed his fingers across his chest, “Yes, I want to,” he replied, kissing him again and rocking their hips together. When Harry pressed up against him with an urgent whine, he drew back, questioning, “How do you want it?”
Draco rolled his eyes, “Honestly, the real question is why did you ever date Meg in the first place? She was practically a child.”
Harry burst through the back door of Grimmauld after work, shouting “Hermione! Where are you? I need help!”
“I’ve thought about this every day,” Draco said quietly, and Harry’s eyes widened and his mouth opened soundlessly. “Every time you walk by in your leathers, every time you sit on my fucking
different. His clothes were different too—Harry could only recall Malfoy swanning about in his school robes, every inch the imperious pureblood, but now he was wearing muggle clothes—his feet on the desk were tucked into black high-top Converse sneakers, paired with skinny black trousers and a black
“You should see yourself right now,” he murmured, pressing back in a little more insistently, “You’re so gorgeous, you’re driving me mad—”
“Cassie,” he groaned, “gerroff,” shoving the cat away from his face and rolling over, closing his eyes again. Cassie had a sixth sense for whenever Harry was going to wake up with a raging hangover, and she invariably perched right on his pillow, practically suffocating him. When he protested, she fixed him with a reproachful gaze, as if to say
“I wouldn’t have done it if I didn’t think you’d be a good sport,” he grinned, “You’ve got to back me up and tell Pansy I did it, now, she owes me fifty galleons.”
Everyone seemed to assume that partnering up with someone meant loving them a lot but also needing to be away from them approximately half the time. Frankly, it left Harry less than convinced that it was even worth it, trying to find love. Could it really be that good, if he would want to be around his partner less than he wanted to be around his best friend?
“My point stands,” Ron continued, “That the two of you have been disturbingly handsy since you got together—”
It had started at the five-year anniversary War Memorial Gala. The two of them were fast friends by then, working together at Gringotts more often than not, going to shows and dragging their friends out to pubs. Harry of course was the guest of honor, had been asked to give a speech and everything. He was dreading it. Draco hadn’t been invited at all. He pretended like he didn’t care but Harry could tell that he was miserable, wracked with guilt over both his past and the fact that he was upset about still paying for it now.
. They got stoned and walked the Venice Beach boardwalk, watching the street performers, the buskers and circus acrobats, speculating which ones might be using a little bit of magic.
Harry frowned. He hadn’t expected Malfoy to be this standoffish. He suddenly remembered that they had hated each other for all their formative years, only cooling off into mutual dislike after the war, and finally settling into bland politeness since Malfoy had started at the Ministry. Maybe Malfoy had regretted the whole night? He took a deep breath.
Downstairs, the kitchen was a disaster, strewn with the detritus of a wild gathering. Harry swept a pile of dirty dishes out of the way, clearing just enough space on the counter to prep a fry-up. He needed something greasy in his stomach. Just as he was putting the finishing touches together—buttering the toast, lifting the eggs from the pan—he heard Draco shuffling into the kitchen, groaning out a greeting. He turned, wielding two full plates.
She squeezed his hand. “Potter’s an idiot, we’ve always known it,” she sniffed, “If he had half a grain of sense he would be groveling at your feet right now, offering to suck you off every day for the rest of your lives to make up for how he treated you.”
“Mate, are you serious?” Ron looked at him, incredulous, “This is the most intelligent thing you’ve said regarding Draco since sixth year, probably.” Hermione nodded emphatically.
of his mouth, the slight furrow in his brow. It made him weak to see Draco like that; his muscles shivered, threatened to give out, but he kept moving, rolling his hips slow and languid, bending to press his lips to the center of Draco’s forehead, just over the wrinkle he had put there.
José adapted well to that, smiling good-naturedly, and he was quite nice during breakfast and offered to help clean up afterwards, so Harry was feeling very charitable towards him when he said, “What are you doing next weekend? You should come over for brunch before the Harpies game on Saturday. We’re going to Seamus and Dean’s to listen, too, if you want to join.”
The garden erupted, everyone whooping and wolf-whistling, but Draco could barely hear them over his heart thudding in his ears and, of course, the dulcet tones of his old friend, Scrawny Ginger Muggle.
Hermione’s laugh brimmed back up, warm and familiar, “No offense taken, dear.” She sighed, “I only wish Ron weren’t working late.”
“Oh god, I—” his voice cracked, and he drew himself up, smoothing over the lines of his suit. “Please allow me to apologize, Harry. I should never— I shouldn’t have lost my temper like that, that was absolutely inexcusable, no amount of provocation could— I’m really, I’m so sorry—"
“Well… thank you,” Draco forced himself to look at Harry as he said it, feeling the color rise in his cheeks. “I probably wouldn’t have eaten anything at all; this is much better.”
“Another point in favor of muggles—good luck getting one of your adoring fans to honestly tell you you’re
Harry pulled his gaze away and spotted a man eyeing them from across the floor; a very attractive man—Nordic looking, all tall and broad and blond.
The first week, Harry went by Draco’s office, but the door was closed and the window shuttered. He couldn’t bring himself to knock. Obviously, Draco didn’t want to see him. Harry spotted him a few times—across the cafeteria or the atrium, down a hallway—but when Draco noticed him approaching he turned swiftly and walked away. Finally, Harry spied him in line for the floos at the end of the day. They always used to chat for a few minutes when they ran into each other there, stepping out of line and waving their colleagues forward. Hope tingled in his fingers as he quickened his stride. “Draco!” he called out, smiling hesitantly, reaching out to touch his arm—and Draco turned towards him, paused, pulled his arm away, nodded curtly, “Potter,” and disappeared into the flames.
“Shut up,” he grabbed Potter by the jaw, digging his thumb in, and when he opened his mouth to protest Draco slid two fingers in, pressing down on his tongue so he couldn’t speak. “I said shut
Harry sidled up behind him as he was waiting for the water to heat up, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and tucking his head over Draco’s shoulder.
Neville nodded solemnly in agreement, “I mean, he doesn’t smoke? Could you date someone who doesn’t smoke, Harry?” His eyes widened in horror at the idea and Harry was forced to concede the point that José was perhaps a bit of a tight-arse.
Draco looked at him gratefully. José looked at him too, but less grateful, more assessing. “But what does this have to do with me? Or what you were asking about
, and suggesting that a pub night might be good for his nerves. Harry couldn’t think of any excuse, despite his firm conviction that it would only make things worse, which was how he found himself crammed into a booth at The Hawthorn and Holly with all their friends. It wasn’t that great, feeling vindicated, he thought as he sucked down yet another gin and tonic, eyeing Draco from across the room. He was chatting up some bloke at the bar, gesturing vividly as the other man laughed and called the bartender over for another shot. Harry had been watching Draco all night as he flitted about, carefree as anything, perfectly oblivious of the turmoil going on in Harry’s brain.
He tuned back in just in time to hear Potter say, “As you know, I am deeply committed to ensuring that
Harry lay there for a few moments, panting, reeling, before deciding he was simply not going to think about the implications of what he had just gotten off to. Instead, he flicked a hasty cleaning charm over himself, rolled back onto his stomach, and fell asleep.
Harry made a strangled sound. “Wait a minute—” he choked out, “Are you— are you fucking rickrolling me right now? Are you rickrolling your own marriage proposal?”
Yes, we slept together. And afterwards, you made your feelings on the matter quite clear. I, considerate partner that I am,” Malfoy’s face twisted, “was perfectly willing to indulge your need to maintain your pure and righteous savior reputation. Thus,” he gestured between them, “I act as if nothing has changed between us, as I gathered that was your wish.”
Draco felt it in the back of his neck first—the icy sting of dread, working its way down his spine and twisting his gut. He took a deep, steady breath. “Alright?”
For the rest of the weekend, Harry felt on edge and off balance. He kept thinking about Malfoy and feeling that odd panic again. On Monday, he stopped by Malfoy’s office, hoping to ease the tension in his chest. Malfoy greeted him with a snide remark about how perhaps he ought to submit a recommendation to decrease the funding for the Auror Department, since it seemed like Harry didn’t have enough work to do. Harry thought about his smooth, posh voice and the way it had broken, hoarsely forming the word
“No, it’s alright,” Draco was laughing now too, albeit wetly, and he buried his face in his hands. “It is a bit funny, isn’t it…” He sniffed. “We weren’t really that great together anyways, I knew it. We didn’t have that much in common. We just talked about the latest news out of the ministry, or whatever wholesome muggle film he wanted to watch. It was nice. But I knew it wasn’t going to be…” he shrugged.
, he told himself—and now he was going on two years as a regular customer. The muted olive-painted walls were lined with wooden shelves sporting glass jars full of fresh herb and psychedelic mushrooms, but what really set Malfoy’s shop apart were the edible and apothecary products. Potions, lozenges, gummy sweets and chocolates, tinctures and lotions and body oils—Malfoy infused them all with marijuana and mushrooms and magic and over the past two years his humble shop had become Harry’s safe haven, his respite from work and fame and the brooding emptiness of Grimmauld Place.
The smile splitting Draco’s face was contagious; Harry couldn’t help mirroring it, and he wanted to say more, tell Draco everything he had been thinking about the trip and all the reasons he was excited for them to go together,
Harry frowned at him, waving a questioning hand in the direction of the very fit and now rather confused looking man who was still doing his best to keep Draco’s attention.
Every morning Harry woke up resolved. He would open his mouth when he walked into the kitchen to the sight of Draco busying himself over the teakettle, feelings clawing their way up his throat, and then Draco would turn around, yawning, holding out a mug, and the words would die in his mouth, and Harry would take the cup from his hands, mutely grateful. At any moment he feared a torrent might burst out of him, yet he was frozen.
But sleep was tugging at the edges of his mind, dragging him back down. Anyways, it felt obvious, understood in everything else they had said and done, in everything they already were to each other. He turned into Draco’s arms and let an untroubled slumber claim him.
“Can I—?" Harry couldn’t finish the thought; all his awareness was throbbing around the feel of Malfoy’s hair in his hand. But then Malfoy said
Potter blanched. “Well, this is actually the first time we’ve really gone out in public, so I suppose you won’t have long to wait.”
“Merlin, you’re gorgeous,” he breathed, and kissed him, slow and filthy. Draco swayed, woozy, and he could feel where Harry was hard, pressed up against his thigh. He moaned weakly and Harry pulled back, resting their foreheads together. “Let’s get you to bed, shall we?”
Draco’s healer was paused, one hand around the curtain and the other folding a clipboard against his chest. Harry had met him the night before, when they’d finally let him in, jittery with guilt and free visitor room coffee. He had been soft spoken and reassuring, saying to Harry with a faint accent he couldn’t quite place,
album with the windows thrown open. Draco came storming in, banging open the doors of the liquor cabinet with a flick of his wrist, zooming a bottle of scotch and two tumblers into his waiting fingers, sweeping across the room and kicking Harry’s legs off, plopping himself down in their place. He unscrewed the bottle, pouring two generous measures and levitating one over to Harry. Harry took a cautious sip, peering over the rim of his glass as Draco knocked back half his tumbler in one. Draco shuddered, letting out a low, raw sort of noise before bringing the glass back up, sipping it quietly once, twice, as he sighed softly, deflating a little bit into the cushions.
Potter snorted into his drink and blushed quite fetchingly, so Draco couldn’t really regret his brazenness. And in fact, he found himself simply telling Potter all about his miserably lonely Christmas, and Potter’s face softened, and his eyes went all sympathetic and understanding, so Draco couldn’t regret that either. He somehow managed to restrain himself from asking why Potter was there alone, instead turning the conversation to Quidditch, and then the interminable frustrations of the Ministry bureaucracy, which they both had quite a bit to say about.
The week before the Ministry closed for the Holidays, Draco worked grueling hours, getting ahead on all his projects so he could take two full weeks off without any niggling guilt. He didn’t see Harry all week, and he hated to admit that he’d gotten used to sending interoffice memos back and forth to arrange times to fuck or have a drink after work, or, usually, both.
“Mmm,” Harry caught his mouth, murmured into it, “So are you. You love it. And you love me,” he kissed Draco again, “So much.”
, and stayed very still as Harry brought his free hand up to brush across the material covering Malfoy’s chest.
On the morning of Ron and Hermione’s wedding, Harry woke up sweating and feverish, weak and nauseous. His first thought was that he had better not be sick on the day he was set to officiate his best friends’ wedding, and that thought sent such a wave of fear and anxiety through his gut that he staggered up, half expecting to heave the contents of his stomach out right there over the edge of his bed.
“Ok,” he breathed, “Ok. When you imagine what it could be like—you know... love, or whatever—what do you think about?”
excellent,” he grinned, “But it’s not just that... Just being in your shop feels good. Being in your flat feels good; seeing you feels good. I always feel good when I’m with you.”
Draco hadn’t even stepped away from the mantel before Harry was crowding his space, backing him up against the wall beside the fireplace. He stopped short of touching, inches apart. He could see Harry’s chest heaving, hear him breathing—a desperate inhale and a short exhale. Harry was practically vibrating with tension. It was radiating off him, his jaw clenching and unclenching, hands twitching and fisting at his sides. Draco felt suddenly lightheaded.
He lifted his head and reached for his wine, draining it and setting it back on the coffee table. Pansy promptly refilled it.
Ron had taken on the wedding planning in good spirits, but he hadn’t exactly been excited about coordinating table and chair rentals. Here, though, he was in his element. Leaning back and rubbing his belly, he let out a contented sigh.
. All their friends had commented on it over the next few weeks, Circe’s resemblance to Harry, until finally Harry had marched himself into the nearest shelter and picked out the blondest, floofiest-looking cat he could find—Cassandra had soft, lustrous white fur and pale blue eyes, and the way she pranced about with her nose in the air, swishing her tail back and forth, put Harry in mind of a prissy kitten character in an animated muggle film he had watched as a child. Harry brought her home with his biggest shit-eating grin plastered across his face, and Draco had taken one look at her, barked out a laugh and said
Harry chewed on his lip. He knew what Draco meant, when he said normal. Easy, uncomplicated. Harry had tried to find that too, over the years. It never worked. “Fuck normal,” he said.
“God,” Harry said, tipping sideways in his chair to knock their shoulders together, “Wouldn’t that be something.”
Harry laughed shakily, a bit too loud. He was still feeling a little wobbly about the knees but with every bite of hors d’oeuvre and every fortifying sip of whatever punch they were ladling out at the bar, he felt the stress leeching out of his skin. And then he looked up and Draco was striding over, sleek grey dress robes billowing, smiling with all his teeth. He swept Harry into a crushing hug and whispered in his ear,
Days in LA slid by in a bright haze of sunlight and smog. They spent long afternoons at the beach, wading in the cool shallows, striking out to the surf and tussling in the waves, flopping down onto their beach towels where Harry basked in the sun like a lizard while Draco compulsively cast and re-cast sun protection charms on himself. Draco took him to the grotty, sweaty venues he had haunted, to the hole-in-the-wall restaurants he’d loved best when he was a piss-poor student saving his money for shows, to the bars where they could get a cheap beer or a crisp, fresh margarita. Harry had a practically religious experience with some fish tacos sold out the side of a van parked next to the beach, the juicy flesh bursting in his mouth, tortillas hot and steaming in his hand, Draco watching him eat with satisfaction sparking in his eyes, saying,
José laughed, “I’ll probably have to pop into Mungo’s during the afternoon to check on patients anyways, but brunch sounds lovely, thank you.”
And of course, they were in Harry’s earlobes every day now. So yeah, Harry wanted to get Draco something special this year.
Another nod. Dropping his hand, he walked back and sank into his desk chair, fingers steepled, knees spread.
? He shivered. A small giggle burbled up from his chest. His senses were blown open, endorphins flooding his bloodstream. He felt brilliant, blissed out and fuzzy. He looked down at his trousers. He hadn’t actually ejaculated, although he was half-hard now, just as if he had. In fact, every sensation in his body felt like he had just come harder than he could remember in a long time. He laughed again, sated and languid, as he slowly dragged his eyes up to Malfoy. Malfoy, who was chewing his own lemon bar contentedly. Except, Harry noticed, his cheeks were a blotchy red, and his breath was quick. He stared at Harry for a moment, then his jaw flared, his throat bobbed.
“Well there you have it,” Hermione said with a grin, “Ron’s walked us through your options and it looks like you’ve got no reason to keep quiet.”
“Really? I honestly wasn’t sure it would go anywhere—when I talked to him at Mungo’s he seemed so… clean cut.” Ron laughed.
“God no,” Hermione snorted, “I’d just love to see his reaction to you fretting over what to wear to a rock concert with Draco Malfoy,” she grinned.
“You’re ready for more?” Draco asked, soft and dangerous, withdrawing and pressing two fingers up against his entrance, just the slightest pressure, and when Harry groaned
Greg chortled, inhaling deep and exhaling slow, shrouding them all in smoke, “Nah, man, I don’t give a shit. I was just curious.”
“Merlin save me,” Draco shoved him down the hallway toward the bedroom. “I’d better adjust my expectations for romance—no flowers or chocolates or weekend trips to Paris in my future, it’s spag bol forever, now—”
Draco leaned around Harry, fixing Ron with what he probably thought was an imperious stare, but his eyes kept slipping around his face.
Chuckling himself, he responded without thinking, “I’ve got you and Ron both for regular quidditch talk and it turns out I actually can’t take much more.”
Hermione darted a frown at Ron, then fixed her eyes back on Harry with a sigh. “Alright then. Just, for what it’s worth, I think you’re wrong. You’re not unloveable, or whatever rubbish you're on about. Someone—whether I’m right about it being Draco or not—is going to be over the moon about being with you, baggage and all.” She reached across the table and squeezed his hand briefly.
Draco took a long hit, dropping his head back and exhaling toward the ceiling. “Nothing’s too bad when there’s curry chips involved,” he said, reaching his hand out, popping another hot morsel into his mouth and licking his fingers.
. In a moment of weakness, Harry grabbed him, hauled him in and kissed him. Just once, hard, eyes open. He broke away laughing, still singing, like it was just a joke, just good fun between them like it always was, like his heart wasn’t in his mouth, choking him. Draco grinned, slinging an arm around Harry’s shoulders and turning his face back toward the stage, belting out the words, blissfully unaware that the world was tilting on its axis. Harry wanted to bury his face in Draco’s neck, clutch his face and kiss him again, apparate them home and fuck him in the hallway between their bedrooms. Why the fuck had he been puttering around,
Potter nodded. Draco couldn’t stop himself from asking, “Are you really so surprised? I mean, did you think I still hated muggles?” He felt a small twist of sadness in his chest—he knew he couldn’t expect it, but it still hurt never to feel redeemed.
,” Pansy pointed up at the countdown clock floating above their heads, waving her sparkler aggressively, “One minute!”
Draco brought a hand up to Harry’s face, tilting his chin back up, “No, Harry,” he laughed gently, “I mean, it’s against policy for team members and management to… fraternize... If anyone finds out there’ll be a humiliating inquiry and we could both face sanctions.”
Harry had been so fiercely happy for them in that moment he thought it might be enough, just to stand by their sides.
And it was true; Draco was right, of course, Harry almost laughed a little through the haze in his brain. So he tilted his chin up, kissed Draco again, breathed, “Yeah, so much time, god—” He dropped his head, pressed his forehead against the jut of Draco’s collarbone, the flats of his teeth against Draco’s chest.
Draco knew that knock. He also knew that the person on the other side of it wasn’t going to wait for a response before—
running through Harry’s head. Harry had tried to calm down a bit, these last few weeks, tried to stop staring at Draco all the time. He figured that he had plenty of time to think this through. It wouldn’t do to rush things. About halfway through the set, Motion City Soundtrack played that song, and Harry looked over at Draco, at the tight stretch of his t-shirt across his chest, the arch of his left eyebrow with the silver barbell through it, the jubilant stretch of his mouth as he formed the words
“Somehow I really doubt that,” Ron said, “But alright, let’s play it out. Worst case scenario: you tell him how you feel, he vomits all over you and jumps out the window—”
“Alright,” Malfoy placed one into his own mouth, “They should take about 20 minutes to hit. Do you need anything?”
“I wish,” Luna began, her lilting voice sending a pleasant tingle down Harry’s spine, “I wish for you two to look within, to recognize how deeply and completely you already love each other,” Harry swallowed. Luna sounded pretty serious. “I wish you the strength to consider the source of your fears and doubts, and to face them. And of course, once you do that, I wish you a lifetime of joy together.”
“Oh my god— Are you serious? But you were so—” Harry swished his chopsticks around in a vaguely accusatory manner.
“Oh,” Harry interrupted smoothly, “I won’t be done with you then, if that’s what you’re worried about. I’m going to make you come now, right here, in my mouth, and then I’m going to take you to bed, and rim you until you’re hard again, and then I’m going to fuck you into the mattress, and you’re going to come
Harry curled in on himself with a low, pained noise. He knew, theoretically, that he simply might not be able to fix things. But he tried not to think about it. Hermione gently combed through the tangles in his hair.
Sometimes he wanted to throttle Potter, wanted to throw him bodily out the office window overlooking the training pitch. Other times he wanted to call Potter’s bluff, push him up against the desk and get his mouth on him, pin his hands and fuck him into submission, into quiescence. But he never gave in, of course. He betrayed not the faintest hint of emotion; nothing cracked his façade. And now, finally, he was almost free—
), but the friendship he knew was still there too. When the pizza arrived, they set upon it ravenously, and Draco made a terrible joke about having worked up an appetite. The relief Harry felt went bone-deep, that they didn’t have to change, didn’t have to recalibrate who they were together.
Harry grinned sheepishly, “Alright, yeah, I don’t think that’s going to happen. I guess the real worst case is he doesn’t feel the same way and just wants to stay friends?”
Draco did his best to look very put-upon, “I suppose I’ve endured worse than your plebian sense of humor… If you truly cannot control yourself, I imagine I’ll manage.” He couldn’t keep the fond note out of his voice. He didn’t even try.
Dean shrugged. “A bit yeah.” He took a swig of his beer. “I do think you two would be great together, you know that.” Harry nodded miserably. “But it’s not always that easy to make the jump.”
The next morning, they took the drive Harry had heard about, north up a motorway called Highway 1, winding along the coastline, ocean on their left, sun on their skin. Harry had updated the bike’s stereo system a few years ago, and Draco insisted on playing
“You’re alright,” Harry was already at his side. “There was an embedded blasting curse concealed under the floorboard behind the desk but they’ve patched you up, you’re going to be fine.”
He turned. He hadn’t even noticed the wizened old woman sitting on the other side of the table. Stark white hair piled into a neat knot on the top of her head, knobbly fingers clutching a glass of dark red wine, she sat ramrod straight, chic plum dress robes buttoned all the way up, brow stern, lipstick crisp.
'I Will Follow You Into the Dark' by Death Cab for Cutie is the song playing in the background during the flashback scene (from the 2005 album Plans, released during the month in which this scene is set)
—ok fine, so there had been some days in their lives more important than this one. But this was still pretty fucking important. And Harry—
Draco laughed wetly, and Pansy smiled softly at him. “I jest, but in all seriousness Draco, I don’t want to see him hurt you again. Best leave it alone.”
“Shut it, Draco, you’re just as bad. The two of you, attached at the hip, disturbingly obsessed with each other, completely blind to the fact that you’re already in a relationship—”
Before they left, Pansy had warned Harry about the high concentration of models, aspiring models, and generally fit people in Los Angeles.
Or they might find themselves how they were now, Draco on his back with his knees fully spread, Harry settled between his thighs, touching his face, gazing into his eyes.
“Harry,” Hermione said, “It’s going to be best case. Draco already loves you, even if he’s farther behind than you are on seeing it.” She sounded so earnest, so sure, Harry wanted desperately to believe her.
“Or,” he continued, undeterred, “You could follow me to the loos in a minute…” He grinned, crooked and lewd, “I’ll give you a first-class blow job, I mean, you’re Harry Potter, obviously you’ll get my best effort…”
“Harry?” Malfoy had appeared directly in front of him, frowning concernedly. “Are you alright? I was going to say you can call me Draco, but I don’t want to trigger an aneurysm.”
It didn’t take long to devolve into committed, fervid debauchery. Blaise looked like he was on cloud nine, sandwiched between Neville and Greg with a rapturous expression on his face. Ginny and Luna were wrapped around each other like squids, making out ferociously. Draco was bent low at the knees, dancing up on Pansy. Harry backed up into the cage of his limbs, wiggling his hips and slurping his drink. Seamus immediately plastered himself against Harry’s front, pushing him closer to Draco. Behind him, Dean winked at Harry as he nibbled on Seamus’ ear. Harry leaned back into Draco’s chest, really committing to it, arching his back and rolling his hips sinuously. Seamus whooped and backed off a little, and Harry grinned. He handed his drink off to Draco and leaned forward, putting his hands on his knees and bouncing his hips on Draco’s crotch. Draco’s hand was hot on the small of his back, sticking to the sweat soaking through his shirt. He threw a smirk over his shoulder and saw Draco leaning back and looking very self-satisfied. Pansy was peeking out from behind him, spreading her fingers over Draco’s chest as he reached back and fed her the rest of the drink.
He had just plotted out an apparition course that would get him—exhausted and irritable no doubt—to his mother’s doorstep in time for Christmas dinner the next day, when the door of the pub opened. Draco turned, and started. Harry Potter had just walked in, and he looked…bad. Haggard, with red rimmed eyes and the kind of slouching posture that practically screamed “I want to be left alone.” So naturally, Draco heard himself calling “Oi, Potter,” before he could stop it. Potter turned and caught his eye, surprise registering on his face. He frowned momentarily, as if considering whether to ignore Draco completely, before shrugging slightly and beginning to make his way over.
The pale, cool light of the early morning filtered in through the window. The sheets felt smooth under Harry’s skin. He was still half-asleep and cozy, spooned up against a warm chest, feeling the languid rise and fall of breath against his back. Distantly, he heard himself let out a low, contented sigh as the body behind him shifted, pressed closer. Harry was dimly aware that it was Draco’s body, and also that Draco was
think it’s nice,” Draco said, squeezing José’s hand with a smile, “That he’s still spending his day off with me, even if it means having to put up with you lot.”
“Hands behind your back,” Draco growled, and Harry obeyed, clasping his hands together, another soft noise escaping his throat.
Draco reached for the speaker on the side table and a moment later Harry heard a high, clear voice, belting out,
“At my birthday party next weekend,” Susan cut in, throwing him a knowing look. Harry made a mental note to buy Susan an extremely nice vintage for her birthday.
“Are they asking for all of us or just you, Draco?” Anushka called over, swiveling around from where she was absorbed in the gears of the backwards-ticking grandfather clock looming in the corner.
Later, in bed, when Harry got his mouth on Draco, and his fingers inside of him, and Draco’s hands were fisted in his hair, his voice a cracked whimper over the blood rushing in Harry’s ears, he wondered how he had ever been afraid it wouldn’t be good between them. And then, when Draco bowed up off the bed, crying out, and Harry swallowed his release, coming into his own hand just at the feeling of having Draco like this, he decided it didn’t matter. All the fear and the doubt—they were choosing to leave it behind. And all the time he spent never realizing they could be
“Oh my GOD!” Ron bellowed, slamming a hand on the table, “All those things the universe lined up for you—you’re welcome, by the way—and it’s actually down to some blokes with spiky hair whinging about their feelings?”
Draco whipped around, cheeks slightly pink. “Could you pick up the pastries? I’ve called in our order at Laughlin’s, it should be ready by ten.”
Harry made a sleepy noise, snuggling into Draco’s chest and then laughing, “Well, as much as I’d like to stay here for a quick nap, you’re actually quite bony,” Draco could feel him grinning and pinched his side gently, eliciting a little yelp. Harry pulled back and turned his face up, “And I’ll be missed, so I suppose we’d better go back to the party soon?”
It was going to be a good year; Harry could feel it. Or at least, he felt good, right now. He and Draco had invited the whole gang over to Grimmauld to ring in the New Year, and they'd all drank too much, and smoked too much, and certainly danced too much. Hermione and Dean had passed out a haul of muggle accessories, little silver and gold top hats, brightly colored noisemakers that trumpeted when you blew into them, sparkly glasses forming the number
Draco swallowed, and brought his fingers back, gentle, into Harry’s hair, nails scratching lightly at his scalp. Somehow, although he wouldn’t have thought it possible, Harry relaxed even further, humming appreciatively.
She beckoned him frenetically, backing out of his way. “Come on, come on,” the note of anxiety rang clearly in her voice. He stepped into her sitting room.
So together, in the cosy flat above Malfoy’s Mellow Medicinals, they drew the starry hangings around the bed, and sheltered under the downy duvet, and wrapped their limbs around each other. And it was almost unbearably easy for Harry to fall asleep, just like that, with Draco's hand in his hair and the taste of lemons in his mouth.
Neville snorted. “Sure, Harry, for a weekend, to see a quidditch match, or whatever. Have you taken an international portkey across an ocean for two weeks of gallivanting up the California coast with Ron? No?” Harry spluttered. “See,” Neville nodded, sure and solemn, “That’s something boyfriends do.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed, scanning across the bar. “Fucking wanker. He’s still over in the corner—shall I hex him?”
Harry had noticed that Malfoy was good-looking before, of course, but he hadn’t really stopped to think about it; he just noticed it and went back to work. But now he was wondering whether it would be possible to call in sick from work indefinitely and spend all his days in Malfoy’s flat instead, held in by the soft-looking walls, the twinkling bed hangings; held by Malfoy himself, his bright, soft hair falling around Harry’s face.
And then Ginny was clapping him happily on the back and Luna was pressing a single-use packet of glittery lube into his hand, so Harry had to yell back, “No! We’re not fucking! We’re getting chips!”
, and winding an arm around Potter’s waist and pulling their bodies flush together, and tangling his other hand in that infuriating hair, and tugging just slightly, and then Potter made a
“It’s just…” Neville cocked his head to the side, leaned his hip against the sinks. “A two-week international holiday? That’s something boyfriends do, yeah?”
“Was it him dating José? You couldn’t stand to see him with someone else because you wanted him to be yours?”
On Friday evening, Harry grabbed a couple bottles of wine from the cellar and headed to Ron and Hermione’s. Draco had been getting ready for his date when Harry left—he had begged Harry for help, throwing on and removing outfits with increasing frenzy until Harry sat him down and made him wear the silver-grey silk shirt with skinny black trousers. He looked fantastic, of course. The shirt brought out his eyes and the glinting silver of the rings in his lip and the barbell through his eyebrow. Harry imagined José, with his strong, clean-shaven jaw and neatly parted hair, picking up Draco, with his snakebites and black nail polish. He grinned to himself as he threw the powder into the flames.
“No!” Harry yelped, “Finding out your schedule and making you dinner! That sauce took me all afternoon!”
“Yeah,” Harry shifted back and forth on his heels. “Yeah, it probably was, but, erm, I really— I really liked it…”
“Really, Ronald, all of this nagging at us to settle down—” He shook his head morosely, “And when you take into account those delectable pasties you made earlier… you’re becoming your mother, it’s undeniable.”
Draco huffed softly, “Of course I’ve thought about it. Been thinking about it more, recently. Maybe that infernal wish put it on my mind... Anyways, I tried not to, of course. That way lies madness, et cetera,” he gestured vaguely, eyes wild. “You’re already my best friend. It’d be a bit silly of me to want anything more. Greedy, really.”
Draco pressed just one finger inside and Harry moaned, rocking down insistently, but he kept his pace slow and languid, until Harry was begging, “More,
After they left, Neville clapped Harry on the back and said, “You alright?” And Harry had to roll his eyes and assure them both that he was in fact perfectly fine, even as he was thinking about how he could convince Circe and Cassie to get into bed with him later so that the house would feel less empty. In an attempt to deflect from his own misery, he launched a rather over-enthused defense of José and how nice he was to Draco, in response to which Greg grunted, “Seems like a bit of a tight-arse, though.”
“Fine!” Harry choked out, his voice strangled and oddly high-pitched. “Urgent Auror business! Must be going! Bye then!” He backed out of Draco’s office as Draco was making a deeply perplexed goodbye, chest heaving as he fled toward the lifts. He ended up back at his desk with no recollection of the return journey and spent the rest of the afternoon staring blankly at his mound of paperwork, considering and reconsidering and arriving again and again at the inevitable conclusion that he fancied Draco Malfoy.
“Shut up,” Draco huffed, swatting him on the arm, tilting his hips up so that Harry slid in a little deeper. He whined again, clenching around Harry and bucking his hips up.
“You can hang your robes here,” Malfoy indicated a coat stand by the door as he crossed the room to grab some clothes out of a wardrobe next to the bed, and retreated into the loo. Harry remained, blinking slowly at Malfoy’s flat. It was a small studio; the walls were painted a soft, silvery sage; Harry touched the pad of his finger to the wall next to him but to his disappointment it felt utterly like a wall, and not at all like a sage leaf. He turned sadly away from the wall, his gaze drawn to the bed tucked into the far corner, plush and heaped with pillows, draped in gauzy hangings embroidered with winking silver and gold constellations. The bone-deep exhaustion of Harry’s day thrummed through his veins and he wanted desperately to throw himself across the room and collapse onto that bed, draw the hangings around and burrow into the fluffy duvet. He actually took a step forward before he realized that might be considered less than polite, particularly since he had never even
“Slow down,” Draco squeezed his wrists tight, “And keep your hands behind your back, even when I let go.” Harry nodded, biting his lip. Draco settled his hands on Harry’s hips. “Go on,” he said hoarsely. Harry sucked in a breath, and Draco watched the muscles in his thighs rippling as he slowly levered himself up and back down, letting out a soft, shuddering
He cleared his throat. “Right then. Can we talk about something else? How about you two and your happy, successful relationship?”
Harry nosed up the column of Draco’s throat, slid his other palm up Draco’s chest, kissed him once, soft, then again.
“Harry,” he said slowly, hesitantly, flushing radiantly, and Harry swayed on the spot with the sudden force of revelation. He wanted Malfoy to call him Harry. He
“Ordinarily I’d be—ah, pleased to hear that, Potter,” Draco bit out, breathless, “but is now really the time?”
But on his way out, as he was passing a rather noisy group in the break room, he noticed the closed office door directly opposite (bit of a shitty spot for an office, right across from the break room, no wonder the door was closed) and through the window, a flash of pale blond hair. Malfoy’s office. Harry knocked. The door clicked open in front of him right away; Malfoy must have opened it without even looking up to see who it was, as he continued scratching numbers onto a scroll of complicated looking equations while Harry stood frozen in the doorway. After a moment, Malfoy looked up expectantly, surprise flashing across his face before he schooled his features and cleared his throat. “Potter. Can I help you?”
He looked down at his plate, where one last bite of lemon bar remained. He hesitated for a moment, then lifted it to his lips. He heard Malfoy’s sharp, quiet intake of breath across the table. He looked up, straight at Malfoy, as pleasure burst across his tongue and sang through his veins, not enough to send him over the edge again, just enough to feel lush and easy, like gentle fingers curling through his hair, warm ocean waves lapping at his toes.
“I guess. I would just feel a bit… nervous. Since I don’t know what I’m doing at all,” he went red and took a swig. “I’d want to know the other person would tell me if I weren’t doing it right, or something.”
“Ah, before I forget,” Draco pointed his wand at the fireplace mantel and fat joint came zooming into his waiting hand. “The gentle giants left us a few holiday presents.” He took a drag and burrowed further into the couch, passing it to Harry. “Nature’s best hangover cure.”
“Very funny,” he palmed Draco’s arse as he pulled out almost all the way and stayed there, teasing, moving his thumbs in little circles against Draco’s skin, “I’ve been thinking, since we’ve been fucking—” he thrust all the way back in, long and slow and torturous, “And it’s good, yeah?”
. Harry fitted their lips together and breathed into Draco’s lungs. The twin silver rings in Draco’s lower lip pressed into Harry’s mouth. When they pulled apart, Draco held his breath for a moment, eyes closed. Then, he blew a smoke ring directly into Harry’s face.
José blushed and protested, and Harry thought he seemed good for Draco, in a way, steady and sure. He seemed like someone who had always known what it was like to be loved unconditionally, who probably had no problem opening his heart and holding someone else there. It made him happy, to see Draco have that, and if his own scone stuck dryly in his throat as he swallowed, he wasn’t going to dwell on that.
“Oh no, no, no,” Pansy held her hands up, shaking her head, “You’re not pulling this matchmaking shit on me, now—”
“It’s true,” Dean piped up, carding his fingers through Seamus’ hair, “I wish you could see how happy you make each other.”
Harry gulped. The truth was that every time he had thought about the ceremony over the past couple of weeks, even as he was writing down the words he would say, when he considered actually
—Merlin, where had that image come from? He cracked through the thick crust and brought the spoonful up to his lips. At the first taste, Harry heard himself whimper, realizing belatedly and trying to choke himself off, turning the sound strangled.
Harry gaped after him for a moment and turned to Draco, who said tightly, “Don’t mind Theo, he’s just taking the piss.”
They didn’t wait for Ron and Hermione before making their way to the kitchen and serving up some fruit salad. Fifteen minutes later, Ron came huffing through the doorway carrying a steaming casserole dish, shouting,
The other eyebrow came up. “Not everyone my age is a sorry bigot, you know. I’m not going to faint away at the idea of two blokes together,” she took a sip of wine, watching them, “You should have seen what we got into, back in my day at Hogwarts—"
Ron laughed, “Alright. That’s—I know I mess the two of you about a lot, but—you’re a good friend, Harry.”
Malfoy looked very concerned at this revelation, and asked whether Harry had eaten dinner, which of course he had—at his desk hours ago. He wanted something sweet now.
. He slid his palms over Draco’s pale skin, flushed from the heat, flushed from Harry’s hands on him. It was something reverent, bathing Draco, tipping his head back to keep the shampoo out of his eyes like he would a squalling infant, precious and new, holding him up as he washed his feet one at a time, like a crinkled grandparent, dear and familiar. Or at least, that was how Harry had imagined those things would feel like. He had never had a grandparent, never had an infant either, obviously. He hadn’t thought he ever would.
He was fresh out of the showers, wearing a clean kit. Draco swallowed and gestured with his scotch, “I’ve got my own party right here, thanks.” He had stuck around in the lounge just long enough to clink glasses with the executive team and clap Wood on the back for a job well done. By this time, he knew exactly how long Potter took in the showers and had departed the festivities just in time.
“Oh, Potter, it would be my absolute pleasure to tell you what to do,” he murmured, and then they were kissing again, and Draco was walking Potter backwards down the hallway and into his bedroom. And his head was spinning, and he couldn’t quite believe this was happening, and all of a sudden Potter was naked and laid out on his bed looking up at him like any number of Draco’s recent fantasies come to life and it was all so improbable he couldn’t help it, he started giggling. And then Potter was laughing too, and Draco collapsed on top of him and their limbs tangled and Potter flipped them so he was on top, panting and grinning down at Draco, and he wondered for a moment that it was so
Potter rolled his eyes, groaning. “And you, you go about shagging muggles in loos?” Potter asked. “I truly never saw that coming.” He laughed, then sobered. “Does that ever feel… I don’t know, weird?”
“Did you see that—” Harry gestured vaguely, “He just offered to suck me off in the toilets, special because I’m,” he hiccupped, “because I’m Harry Potter…”
He staggered backward and felt a strong arm wrap around his waist, “I’ve got you, come on,” Malfoy’s voice vibrated against his ear. Dazed, allowing himself to be led, he stumbled along in Malfoy’s grip, out of the press of bodies, out of the heaving pit. Harry brought a hand to his face—his nose was tender and sticky, and his fingers came away wet and red. Malfoy guided him into the grimy, dimly-lit loo and ushered him into a stall, locking the door behind them and muttering a few privacy spells. Harry breathed thickly though his mouth, tasting blood. The pebbled plastic walls of the stall were covered in lewd graffiti and band stickers. Harry’s calves were pressed against the toilet. Malfoy was standing close, looming over him, a hand fisted in the side of Harry’s shirt. Harry’s head was spinning but he felt good, exhilarated; he wanted more, wanted to throw himself back into the crowd and loose his fists, wanted to bare his bloody teeth and fling his elbows into something solid.
As usual, Harry noticed when other people’s eyes were on Draco too, which was often. When Draco took him out to the bars in West Hollywood, the looks he got were positively indecent. But Harry didn’t mind, because he was getting a fair bit of attention himself.
They hike they take on the Big Sur coastline is called Soberanes (and if you've ever done it, hopefully you can attest that I'm not exaggerating how steep it is 😅)
“Yeah,” Harry said, “I’ll hang out here a bit before I go home so you can see what you’ve done to me,” he grinned, “but you’ve got to take one too or I’ll make a complete fool of myself.”
He felt the muscles of Draco’s stomach clench as he said “God, Harry, ok, yeah.” He rolled over and stretched out, long and languid and content, and Harry pressed alongside him, kissed his shoulder blades, rutted against his hip.
Draco frowned. What kind of stupid question was that? “What else would you expect me to think?” he asked flatly.
Harry flicked a piece of bacon at him. “Piss off. I just don’t see why I should be fussed about being a bit short? Like, I’ve never known any other way of being.” He shrugged, then grinned rakishly, “I suppose Draco’s right, I do think I’m extremely fit.”
“I’ll find my own good-looking healer, then,” he grumbled. Hermione and Ron let out twin shouts of laughter, as if he had said something utterly ridiculous. What did they know, anyways? Draco wouldn’t
Harry grimaced. Ear protective charms were surprisingly finicky, at least if you wanted to get good sound quality through them. Luckily, they were standard for Cursebreakers (and had been in Auror training too) for jobs likely to involve explosions or background auditory interference, so he had gotten pretty good at them by now.
Bonus points if you read Draco saying “I self-medicate with drugs and alcohol” in Max Bemis' voice from the Say Anything song 'Admit It!!!'
“Are you serious? We fuck in the loo at the Ministry Singles Happy Hour and I don’t hear a thing from you
deep end, like, deeper than Harry had bargained for. He hadn’t even known Malfoy worked at Gringotts until someone mentioned him last week. It wasn’t a surprise; no one else would hire him, not with the Dark Mark and the memories so fresh. Gringotts didn’t particularly care, though, and fuck if that wasn’t what brought Harry there, too.
“I, er—” Harry flushed deeply, steeled himself with a breath, “You know how I needle you, I mean like, you’re so unruffled all the time? And how I’m always baiting you—” he broke off, biting his lip. “I mean, I was trying to get a rise out of you, to get you to admit you wanted me too, to get—anything, really, but…”
Back at Grimmauld, at the door to his bedroom, Harry once again fought down the urge to invite Draco in. Instead, he slurred his thanks when Draco summoned him a hangover potion, and stumbled through the doorway alone. In bed, his head spinning, Harry allowed himself to think about how Draco’s hair had glinted in the dim, warm light of the bar, how his teeth looked sharp when he threw his head back and laughed. He allowed his hand to slip into his pyjamas. He shouldn’t do it, he knew. Surely there was some ethical rule against wanking to thoughts of your best friend sleeping just down the hall? But his better judgment had been lulled into quiescence by liquor and he sighed as he slicked up his hand and let his thoughts wander. He turned over onto his side, curled up like he had been that morning in Big Sur, imagining it was Draco’s slim fingers that had slipped under his waistband, firm and sure. He wondered how Draco would have fucked him. If they would have moved slow, weighed down and drowsy, careful with each other. He shuddered. He imagined Draco hitching up his knee, holding him still, pressing into him, slow and dizzy in the morning fog. Maybe—maybe he would have heard Draco’s smooth, low voice in his ear, quiet and raspy with sleep, whispering,
But Cassie was lovely, despite her insistence on torturing Harry at his lowest—she was soft and sweet, with a bottomless appetite for affection—so pretty much like Draco in that way, too. She woke him up again, a bit later, nuzzling at his neck. Sighing, Harry resigned himself to the day ahead—the sun was already streaming in through the gaps in his curtains. He stretched hesitantly, hissing at the throbbing in his head and ache in his muscles. Flopping over, he reached for the vial of hangover potion Draco had set out for him yesterday, downing it with a grateful moan. It wasn’t industrial strength, what Draco brewed, but it was a damn sight cheaper than what they could buy at the apothecary, and it took the edge off well enough for Harry to haul himself out of bed and limp into the shower.
Harry slumped over the bar, steadily draining his drink. As he slurped at the ice, he felt a hand on his back.
At his touch, Draco let out a strangled moan, arching back, and Potter was fucking into him, panting harshly into his ear and Draco was dizzy with it, his breath coming out in high-pitched whines. And then he was spilling over Potter’s fingers, wound together with his own, and his entire body tightened around Potter, and he heard Potter cry out hoarsely as his hips jerked and then slowed, and he collapsed forward onto Draco’s back, dropping them both down onto the bed.
'L.G.F.U.A.D.' by Motion City Soundtrack is the song Draco queues up in the sitting room on New Year’s Day
“Shall we go then?” He stuttered, and Malfoy acquiesced, following him out the door and locking up, very politely not mentioning if he had noticed Harry goggling at him like a goldfish, open mouth working, forgetting his entire life before the last seven seconds since Malfoy walked out of the loo. He tried not to stare at Malfoy’s back (
. A little bubble of reassurance had swelled up in his chest, that he wasn’t wrong or naïve about Draco, that his friends could be friends.
Draco chuckled. “You, of course—” He blanched, blushing, “I mean, I think it would be like what we have, except... romantic?”
, throwing elbows, even punches. Harry didn’t think. He launched forward into the fray, spinning as a shoulder caught him in the chest, shoving back, a wild energy singing through his veins.
“Alright then,” he drew a small wooden case out from a hidden drawer behind the counter and opened it, revealing a row of cabochon-shaped lozenges, deep red and shining like glass. “I’ve been working on these for weeks. They should be extremely relaxing—high THC and valerian root, with a bit of ginger for zing and just a touch of psilocybin to ensure a positive mood—would you like to try one?”
“Oh shove off,” Harry clambered off him, laughing. “Alright then, I’ll be there in, say, thirty minutes? What’s your address?”
Draco couldn’t respond. He couldn’t move. Harry said, “I mean it. I meant everything I said. I hate— I hate that shit, telling everyone my business, but I thought it might— I don’t care if they know. I want everyone to know about you,” he moved even closer, their chests barely touching, “I want you,” he whispered, and Draco closed his eyes. “Can I?”
Draco threw his head back; his laugh was bright. “Motion City Soundtrack? I should write them a thank you card. We’ll make it the first dance at our wedding.”
Draco elbowed him, a gentle nudge, “Don’t be silly,” he replied, “You’ve taken me, don’t you remember?”
“Are you sure?” José was looking between them, an amused glint in his eye, “This isn’t all just some elaborate plot to seduce me as a third?”
Harry fisted his hands in the hem of his shirt. “You know how— how we always say we’re not capable of really loving someone or being loved—” he didn’t dare look up, barreling on, “What if we are, and it’s—it’s us, it’s what we already have?” He took a deep breath and forced his gaze up. Draco was staring at him in a dazed sort of way, his mouth parted, the faint shock of a frown creasing his forehead.
Draco raised a brow. “Really, Harry? You can’t wait to give me… a card? Did you include a voucher with your promise to pay for my birthday dinner?”
Draco’s eyes snapped up. “Yes, I can see that, I just… Los Angeles?” He frowned, scanning the page, “Departing in two and a half weeks? Harry, what?”
—” as soon as he said it the pleasure spiked, exploding through his chest and down his spine, pulsing through his limbs, leaving a shudder in its wake.
Draco hummed, kissing him soundly, and pulled back slightly to say, “You didn’t warn me about your morning breath,” grinning impishly.
Harry looked up and Draco was standing over him, holding out a cup of ice water. Harry clutched at it gratefully as Draco sank into the chair next to him, smoothly turning and introducing himself to the ancient woman, whose name was Ethel, and who was apparently a distantly related Prewett, Harry didn’t quite catch it.
Draco took one long, measured breath. The base of his skull was tingling. “And why did you think I would be… like that?”
“Everyone’s going to be smug,” Draco continued, “Insufferable, the lot of them. I assure you they won’t let me recover from this breakup in peace; it’ll be right back to business as usual, trying to lock us in broom cupboards or set us up on blind dates with each other…” he shook his head, laughing, turning his head into Harry’s chest with a dramatic groan.
“It’s nothing, just—long week,” Harry replied, but he was just on the other side of too drunk to stop his eyes sliding over toward Draco, flirting with that bloke who, Harry couldn’t help but notice, had very nicely sculpted arm muscles.
Harry hummed in agreement, his body starting to settle. “Put on some music, will you? Something happy? Good spirits for the new year?”
“I don’t really want to talk about it,” he said. Ron’s eyebrows shot up and Hermione frowned and opened her mouth in a way that Harry just knew meant a question he didn’t want to answer was coming; he held up his hand to stop her. “It’s nothing, just, we were drunk, and I—” he rubbed the back of his neck, “I’m not sure,” he said honestly, “it’s a bit of a mess.” Hermione nodded and asked a question about the muggle bars and Harry took a sip of wine and thought about Malfoy’s low voice asking him,
“Passing out sounds about right,” Draco responded, tipping back the last sip of wine in his glass and stifling a yawn.
“You…” Hermione cocked her head to the side. She was making the face she reserved for when Harry (or Ron) did something particularly stupid—her brows frowning at him but her mouth working as she tried to suppress a smile. “I’m sorry Harry, I thought I just heard you say that you were going to a muggle music show with Draco Malfoy? Surely I misheard? I was quite absorbed in my work…” She trailed off, barely containing the mirth in her voice.
“That’s alright,” Harry smiled beatifically up at him. “I want you to.” He dipped his head back down, brushed his lips against the head of Draco’s cock, still gazing up at him over the rims of his glasses. Draco shook his head frantically, “But I want— I want you to—”
“Hey!” Neville leaned forward, “I have very nice skin.” It was true; despite all the time he spent in the greenhouses, Neville’s skin was clear and smooth, and extremely soft.
“Yes, well,” Draco stiffened in his seat, “Some of them wished that, in addition to shagging, Harry and I would also date, yes.” He flushed deeply. “But it hasn’t worked, has it!” He nodded triumphantly.
Draco reached out, brushed a thumb across Harry’s lower lip, grazed his fingernails along Harry’s jawline. “You want me to be…
Malfoy looked nothing like Harry had expected. He was lounging back in his desk chair, feet propped on the desk, scowling down at an old, dusty scroll in his lap, chewing on a thumbnail—and Harry had never seen Malfoy doing
The man flagged down the bartender and turned back to Harry, extending his hand. “I’m Eric,” he said.
Ron roared with laughter, wrapping an arm around Hermione, “How’d you like that, love, me becoming my mother?”
He didn’t quite admit it out loud though, just cracked open his eyes and gritted out, “What do you think?”
Draco closed his eyes for a moment, savoring the prickling heat spreading down his spine. Then he smiled, predatory, sharklike.  “You like my buttons, do you?”
Yes, Harry knew Gringotts threw their new trainees right into the deep end—he had been looking forward to that specifically, in fact—but Merlin, Malfoy was a
, and Harry was struck with the absurd realization that he and Draco Malfoy were friends. He laughed out loud at the thought and, grinning wildly, shoved Malfoy square in the chest, and Malfoy shoved him right back, his mouth falling into a surprised smile. And when the show ended and they were drifting toward the exit, Harry turned to Malfoy and said, “I’m starving, want to grab a bite?”
Harry gasped and his eyes snapped to Draco’s for a moment, his body rocking forward and then stilling abruptly, “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
Malfoy looked down at the countertop, his mouth quirking to the side, “Would you mind? Or at least, if you can’t stay, could you report back to me what you think? I haven’t sold these yet, I’ve only tried one last night—”
. Draco, on the other hand, loved to dip into his prior skin like this, to try on what could have been and discard it when he walked out at the end of the night. Once he had told Harry, whispering low in his ear,
Ron leaned forward, an avid glow in his eyes. “Right then, what was it that finally made you figure it out? Was it when he almost died and you realized you couldn’t live without him?”
He and Potter had been shagging for a couple of months now. They hadn’t talked about what they were doing, exactly, and Draco had no idea whether Potter was seeing other people, but Draco certainly hadn’t had the time nor the inclination to sleep with anyone else since Conference Room 12F. And recently, Potter had started asking him to do things other than sex, things like proofreading his speech for the upcoming fundraising Gala for the Ministry Summer Quidditch Camp. Obviously, they were going to fuck after they finished with the speech, but still, if Potter had only wanted sex from Draco, he could have practiced the speech with Hermione and then asked Draco over afterwards. But he didn’t.
“Yes,” Harry nodded emphatically, “And if we have to keep this a secret you’d better not come back to the lounge with me right now because I won’t be able to keep my hands off you. I’ll just go and make a quick round of goodbyes, say I’m feeling tired. Yours or mine?”
Harry nodded mutely. Malfoy’s finger was still touching his nose, and Harry had a sudden, shuddering desire to nuzzle his face down into Malfoy’s hand like a dog, to rub his cheek against Malfoy’s palm. But then the finger withdrew, and Malfoy was taking his arm and leading him inside, and saying words in a calm, measured tone to the host, who was quite possibly giving Harry a highly suspicious look as he led them to a table in the corner and handed them menus. Harry slid gratefully into his seat, blurting out a sudden “Thank you!” just as the host turned away, so that he had to turn back around and then most definitely
Harry walked out onto the deck, shivering in the chill morning air, drawing the robe tighter around him and breathing hot on his fingers. He looked out over the cypress trees and blooming wildflowers dotting the cliffs shrouded in mist. The edges of the coastline disappeared into the heavy pearlescent fog, the ocean and vast horizon stretching out beneath the pale white glow of the morning sky. Harry could smell the salt on the air, cool and damp on his skin, everything silent and still but for the waves crashing on the rocks below, a low, distant rumble.
Harry gasped into it, pressing their bodies flush. Draco’s lips were familiar; the fit of their faces together, the feeling of his breath—it was nothing new. Harry knew the outlines of his body, the ways they slotted together on the sofa, waltzed around the kitchen, pressed together at the foot of a stage. He had thought that he already knew how Draco would feel, how he would make him feel. Well. It wouldn’t be the first time he’d been an arrogant fool.
Harry backed out and closed the library door behind him, heading up to his room. What did one wear to a rock concert, anyways? He didn’t own anything particularly
Draco was silent for a moment. Harry looked up at him to see his eyes were closed. “Can you?” He asked finally, and Harry was surprised to hear his voice choked with fear. “What if— what if you can’t feel that for me?”
“But it’s Christmas,” Harry pouted, “and you’re in my house, so you’ve got to suffer all my awful Christmas-themed innuendo.”
The street sign they take a picture of, Ocean Avenue, is actually a main street in the town Carmel-By-the-Sea! It's referenced in the song 'Ocean Avenue' by Yellowcard. (The hat shop and the Cottage of Sweets are also real stores in Carmel)
They made their way north, stopping before San Francisco to spend a couple of days exploring the Big Sur coastline. Harry had put Draco in charge of hotel booking, so he followed Draco’s directions to a place called the Post Ranch Inn. It was quite posh—apparently Draco had dreamt about staying there when he spent weekends in Big Sur as a broke student, camping or crashing at the cheapest hotels. Each accommodation was freestanding, built into the cliffside overlooking the ocean, fencing and natural architecture rendering each one completely private. A winding, wooded path took Harry and Draco to their suite, a tiny chalet with a garden in the back and a deck suspended over the cliff, framed with sheet glass railing, lounge chairs beckoning next to a stainless-steel hot tub. Inside was all rich wood paneling, heated floors, a wood-burning fireplace, a single king bed in the center with crisp white bedding. Harry padded through slowly, openmouthed. He had never stayed anywhere so luxurious. Draco was grinning like the cat that got the cream, exhausted exhilaration shining through his eyes as he tossed his bag onto the chaise and flopped onto the mattress, stretching languid and satisfied.
Draco’s face went soft for a moment and he twisted his fingers together over the thin, scratchy blanket. “Thanks,” he said, accepting the glass and gulping down half of it in one. When he emerged, he eyed Harry up and down.
“Hmm,” Draco chuckled, “We wouldn’t even have to change anything; we could just continue on living at Grimmauld, except everyone would leave us alone.”
“Ok?” Harry zoned out a little as Ron explained the benefits of heavy hors d’oeuvres and light main courses, ranked his top five appetizers (bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and blue cheese, smoked salmon crostini, pesto bruschetta, deviled eggs, and crudité cups filled with lemon-rosemary hummus), and concluded that they should pick just one pasta and the fish as main course options. Harry made an indistinct affirmative noise in an attempt to signal his agreement.
“Draco,” Harry was in front of him, all of a sudden, reaching out a hand, fingers brushing tentatively across Draco’s shoulder. He swallowed. “I’m sorry too, I shouldn’t have— I think… we need to talk.”
humble—and wait a minute, who said it would be my head in your arse? Why doesn’t the universe want you to shove your head into my arse?”
“Don’t be silly, there haven’t been any shooting stars tonight,” Luna said, very seriously. Ginny kissed the side of her head.
“Look,” Ron broke in, and Harry’s nervousness did not abate. “I started it, I suppose. We were right pissed on New Year’s and there was a star shower. I’d just been winding up Harry and Draco, you know how they are—” José stared at him flatly. “Erm, right,” Ron plowed on, “Anyways, Luna said we should make a collective wish and I said I wished they’d shag,” he grimaced, “Sorry, mate, I mean you weren’t even in the picture, you know, it was just a joke…”
, even—if he had touched Draco’s skin, breathed his air. He hadn’t felt hot with self-consciousness, or petrified by the prospect of baring himself, or worried that he wouldn’t be good, that they wouldn’t want the same things from each other’s bodies. But now, as the sleep-haze was receding from his mind, he felt the fear creeping back in. God, what if he hadn’t come to his senses when he did? His stomach twisted as he recalled that sharp instant when he had rocked back, desire singing in his veins—he could still feel it in his mouth now, his tongue thick and heavy with it. He could have gone too far, made a mess of himself in front of Draco, made things strange between them. And he definitely didn’t want that. No, Draco had been right—it was just the morning, just the clinging vestiges of a peculiar dream state. He heaved a sigh and slipped out from under the duvet, rolling his shoulders, physically shaking the lingering restlessness from his body and shrugging into the plush hotel bathrobe thrown over the armchair next to the bed, sliding his feet into the matching fluffy slippers.
“Ugh, that’s disgusting,” Draco bumped their shoulders together. Harry looked up, blinking the shine out of his eyes. “Ah,” Draco shifted and threw an arm around his shoulders, “I see we’ve reached the maudlin stage of intoxication?”
“Fuck off,” Harry muttered through a mouthful of sandwich, “I’m going for a shower and change in a bit, pack an overnight bag and some breakfast. Obviously I wasn’t going to leave until the healers got him stabilized and let me in to check on him—”
He stepped through the floo in his flat, exhausted and ready to throw back a liquid dinner and collapse into bed. Except—there was music playing from the kitchen. Draco felt one moment of sharp, exquisite fear, before his ears processed the sound and he realized he knew the song. He sagged against the mantel in relief, and something else.
Harry followed Dean’s eyes over to where Seamus was chatting with Blaise at the end of the bar. “Took a war for me to figure out I was mad about Seamus, and even then I was scared,” he laughed. “Can you imagine? A year on the run without my best friend, didn’t know if I’d ever see him again, and I thought I might sick up from nerves, wondering whether he wanted to kiss me too.”
been talking for hours, and that stopped him in his tracks. Sure, he and Potter had interacted plenty over the past few years, mostly at Ministry functions, but they’d certainly never spent an entire evening alone together, and on Christmas no less. As if they were friends, or something. Draco was surprised that they were getting on so well; he couldn’t imagine that Potter had expected it either. And then Draco got back to the bar, and Potter abruptly drained his drink, cleared his throat loudly and said, “So. You’re gay.”
“Anthony’s very nice,” Hermione said, tilting her head and leveling Pansy with a considering look, “He might be good for you, actually…”
Neville held out the spliff to him, and he shook his head quickly. “No, thank you, I don’t smoke,” he said, voice laced with the barest hint of tightness. Harry arched an eyebrow at Draco, who responded with the tiniest eyeroll.
, so this morning it was just Ron, Hermione, and Blaise. Harry couldn’t argue with the logic—José was sure to get along with Hermione, as they were both wicked smart, and Blaise, as they were both incredibly posh.
Harry dipped his head, dropping his gaze down, “Fuck, ok yeah, I— I used to think, if I came in here and got you worked up enough, you might—” he broke off, arching his back and bearing down, “
So on a balmy Friday in late September, Malfoy strode into the pub and took his customary seat beside Susan Bones (his favorite teammate—she didn’t talk much, she had a very dry sense of humor, and she was a dab hand at spell trivia). She caught him up on the latest goings-on in the Auror Department and he regaled the team with an incredibly boring story about that month’s budgetary numbers. He’d just sat back with his whiskey when Potter walked in, followed closely by the Gryffindor who’d been their quidditch captain before him–Draco was sure he knew the man’s name, but a strange weight had settled in the base of his brain, radiating static and disrupting the rest of his thoughts. To his horror, Potter slid into the booth next to him (despite not being an official team member, he simply always sat with Granger and no one protested), grinning shyly and saying, “You all remember Oliver, yeah?” And then everyone was playing catch-up on their lives since Hogwarts and Draco was sitting extremely still and wondering when was too soon to get up and go back to the bar.
Harry smoothed his fingers down Draco’s hairline, tucked some strands behind Draco’s ear, settled his palm on the side of Draco’s throat. He leaned in, panting hot against Draco’s mouth, and kissed him. Draco whimpered into it, and felt himself flush. He wasn’t quite used to the tenderness, yet. They
Back at his flat, Harry sat at his desk once more. Glenlivet eyed him warily. He pulled out a quill and parchment and wrote:
like that as he pushed inside him, and he saw clearly the source of his fear. He didn’t just want to bend Malfoy over his desk and fuck him again, right then and there (although he certainly did want that). He wanted to call him Draco. He wanted to snog him in the Ministry lifts. He wanted to take him home after pub quiz and suck him off on the sofa. He wanted—
They went up to the shower together, and washed each other, hot and close in the steam. Harry let himself lean back into Draco's chest, closed his eyes as the water ran over their bodies. He let Draco wash his hair, the pads of his fingers massaging Harry's scalp, drawing a low groan from his mouth. He let Draco's hands make him clean. Then, Harry turned around and said,
Over the next week, though, thoughts of Draco wouldn’t leave him alone. At work, he found himself staring at Draco’s hands. Out at a site, he couldn’t tear his eyes away from Draco’s long, dexterous fingers, bony knuckles flexing as he plucked at the threads of a curse. When they got home at the end of the day and Draco cracked open a bottle of beer, bringing it to his mouth with a low hum of pleasure, Harry found himself distracted by the way his snakebites scraped against the lip of the bottle, wondering how they would feel grazing up the underside of his cock. When they parted ways in the hallway before going to bed, Harry was possessed by the mad urge to invite Draco into the master suite, brush their teeth side by side in front of the double vanity, crawl under the covers together.
