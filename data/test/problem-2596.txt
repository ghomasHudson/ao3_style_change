‘But that’s slavery!’ Draco exclaimed.
It was nearly 4 a.m. when Draco woke up. He was never so cold in his life. He sat up and rubbed his eyes desperately hoping that it has all been a bad dream and he was still in his bedroom at the Malfoy Manor. The realization that he was in fact sitting on a park bench somewhere in London (he wasn’t even sure where he was, he didn’t recognize any of the buildings nearby) hit him like a bag of bricks. He knew he needed to do something, anything, to find himself a more suitable place to stay – staying out in the open like he did was not safe. He didn’t know anything about Muggle culture, he wasn’t sure he would even be able to interact with the non-magical people without it being apparent that he had no idea what was going on around him. And that, in turn, meant that he was practically defenceless if anything was to happen to him. His stomach grumbled. He realized he hadn’t eaten since the previous morning, but it wasn’t like he had any Muggle money (or any money for that matter) to just go into a store and buy himself food. He looked around. Nearby, he spotted a man pulling a cart of freshly-baked bread. The smell was so delicious that Draco practically whimpered. He had to swallow his pride and do something, he couldn’t just sit there staring at the man, it wouldn’t accomplish anything. He braced himself, stood up, and approached the man.
- What do you want me to do?
to use your keys every time?’ Harry spat. ‘I gave you those for emergencies, not so you can waltz in here like you own the place!’ It was safe to assume he was still angry at the redhead, for whatever reason.
year, nobody asked your opinion, and last year it only escalated. And from what my instinct tells me, that is not your personality.
It was Sunday, so they all had the afternoon free, but Harry didn’t want to join his classmates in hanging around in the common room. He was lying on his bed trying to finally get done with all his homework that was due next week, but as soon as he figured out a particularly tricky question on his Charms worksheet there was a knock on the door. Malfoy raised his eyes from his Herbology essay and called for whoever was on the other side to come in. It was the first break in silence in the room since they finished their last night’s conversation in a fit of laughter. Harry didn’t know how to act around his roommate anymore (at least not until he finally figured out what the hell was he feeling), so he decided it’s best to just stick with ignoring each other.
‘What happened when? This year or last?’
Alone. That seemed to be the theme for his life right now. He had nobody by his side. Potter was forced to take him in, like he was some shelter dog, but it was clear he didn’t want him there. Sure, they managed to act like adults around each other, there wasn’t any hostility between them anymore, maybe even they had some fun working the case for a couple of brief, fleeting moments, but that was no friendship. As soon as he was cleared, Draco was planning to get the hell out of Potters apartment and never return. He would go… Well, where exactly? The bitter realisation that he had no
‘Fine. If you want to sit here and mope, go ahead. I, on the other hand, am fully set of getting you this job.’ With that, Harry marched over to the living room to try and find Ron and Hermione by way of Floo network.
But despite his best efforts, the question came back to him throughout the whole week, appearing in his head seemingly out of nowhere at the least convenient times – Hermione must have elbowed him in the ribs at least three times during Charms the following Wednesday because he had been so lost in his thoughts he stopped paying attention.
- That you’re in love with Potter! You certainly proved this last night. – Nott looked him with the same “I told you so” expression Draco received from Pansy before.
‘Me and who? Me and Harry?’ She was getting clearly irritated. ‘That’s ancient history. And I was against this, but I talked to Ron and he opened my eyes to some things. I don’t care who’s with whom, as long as they’re happy. Oh, anyway, guys, I believe I never properly congratulated you both! I’m really happy for you!’ She hugged Harry and after a brief moment of hesitation, flung her arms around Draco’s neck. ‘What are you doing here anyway? I heard through the grapevine you’ve fallen off of the face of the Earth!’
And now he was back at Hogwarts. Harry really hoped his last year would be peaceful and that he would be able to just concentrate on finishing his education and getting a job. Or actually, finishing his education and figuring out what the hell to do with himself – he wanted to be an Auror ever since his 4
- But I have friends to help me figure things like that out. – That was a good enough lie for now. – You’d be surprised, but Slytherins are pretty good with the feelings stuff.
- Yeah, and? What does this have to do with anything?
‘Come on, just shut up and kiss me!’ Harry laughed and pulled Draco’s t-shirt off.
‘And in simpler English, please?’ Draco understood Harry perfectly, but some part of him wanted to hear it again.
‘Nothing special. Eating, sleeping, mostly ignoring each other.’
But it appeared that not even sleep was in the cards for Draco. He tossed and turned for the whole night and when he finally, miraculously, managed to drift away for what seemed like a fraction of a second, he was woken up by none other than Harry bloody Potter making himself a cup of coffee.
‘It’s nothing like that one, you know it. Treat it like a witness’s testimony – that’s essentially why you’re here, you’ve done nothing wrong.’
- Since when do I take any orders from people? I’m the one that gives orders around here. – He briefly glanced at Harry. He thought he saw just a hint of scarlet on the Gryffindor’s cheeks, but he couldn’t be sure.
- That I did. – He was still cold towards Harry after their lack of communication that morning. He didn’t want to get hurt by rejection. – What about it?
‘I want to know why you stopped me from asking that one question. And as for trust, it’s coming to me, I’m not completely there yet.’
- But…
Draco turned his face away from Harry. ‘I don’t believe you.’
(See the end of the chapter for
A narrow black door appeared in front of him. At first glance, it looked like it was just a storage closet, but Harry felt the dark energy radiating off of it. It was only when he looked at the doorknob, he saw a bloody handprint on it. He reached to turn it, but when he touched it, it burned. He pulled his hand back instinctively.
- Oh, nothing, I just find it ironic that you seem to display the same propensity for switching sides as your boyfriend. Two peas in a pod, you know what I mean?
‘We did it!’ He exclaimed excitedly.
‘Told you, Potter, I’m smart. Frankly, I’m surprised you haven’t managed to figure this much on your own, it’s the only logical conclusion.’
Three days later, Harry, Draco and Narcissa woke up early, ate a hasty breakfast and set to travel to London completely relying on Muggle means of transportation. Draco was still convinced the idea was ridiculous, but he stopped complaining loudly when they were boarding the train from a nearby town. Since neither him, nor his mother have ever dealt with Muggle money (Harry considered himself quite insightful to pack whatever he had left over from years prior,
Draco climbed up, wrapping Harry in his arms. Harry was shaking and panting. It was clear he hasn’t come like that ever before.
The whole 8
‘Yeah, mate, no problem!’ Ron was beaming with excitement. ‘But honestly, I think it’s better if you have Hermione do it, she’s way better than me at this sort of thing. Tell you what, why don’t you two come over this evening and we’ll work this out? MOOOOOM!!!’ He bellowed into the house. ‘Can Harry and Draco come over this evening? We have something important to do!’ He waited for a second and turned to Harry. ‘She says it’s fine. So, come by around seven and we’ll talk?’
- If that’s what you need to tell yourself, then fine. – Malfoy mocked-shrugged. – Although you don’t sound like you’ve convinced yourself. At least not judging by the groaning that comes out of your bed every time I leave the bathroom in the morning… - he raised his eyebrow and smirked knowingly.
It was almost nightfall when Draco was escorted through the corridors of Azkaban to his father’s cell. When the iron door shut behind him, he shivered – even without the dementors there, it was the last place he ever wanted to find himself in.
- RON! – Hermione was shocked. – You can’t say that! Obviously something happened, they’re both distraught and someone needs to do something before it’s too late! Are you sure you have tried everything?
That night Harry couldn’t sleep, he needed to know if he can actually trust his boyfriend to be the person he was so convinced he was. I was nearly 6 a.m. when he finally came up with some form of plan on how to achieve it. It was no use to try and fall asleep now, so he got up, took a shower and headed towards the common room. On his way there, he bumped into Hermione.
Harry made his way to the parlour where he thought Draco might be. Upon arriving, he asked Jeanelle if Yasmine was working. To his surprise, Jeanelle looked at him sadly and handed him a sealed envelope without a word.
the body?’ Malfoy was back to mocking Harry. ‘Don’t play dumb, Potter. You’re under arrest for suspected murder of Neville Longbottom.’
- WHAT?! – Few birds that were still looking for worms on the ground took off startled by Draco’s scream.
‘It didn’t occur to me for some reason.’
- God, you’re massive… - He breathed into Harry’s ear. – You’ll feel so good in me one day…
- How would you know? I told you what I wanted, it was all the information you had. You had no way of knowing my intentions. I’m not sure I even knew them. It was just what felt right in that moment. And besides, if I was ever going to be ready, it was that night. I felt good, I was on a high from what we did before and if anything, waiting wouldn’t have made me more prepared for this. The only thing waiting would accomplish was getting rid of that high and then I would be less ready if that makes sense.
‘You.’ It was barely audible, even in the complete silence of the apartment. Potter was once again refusing to look up at him, focusing instead on seemingly trying to burn a hole in the floor with his gaze. Draco was completely shocked by Potter’s confession.
‘Well spotted, Potter.’ To his relief, Draco noticed a complete lack of arousal on his part, although the sensation of Potter’s body against his own still burned. ‘It wasn’t my campsite, so there must have been someone else. But why would that make a difference? We know the snatchers were there, so it doesn’t change anything.’
‘And where is that
‘Mr. Potter, can you hear me? Mr. Potter!’ Harry was too weak to answer. He tried to do something to indicate that he knew what was going on around him, but to no result.
, you weren’t convicted and your parents have nothing to do with it. If anything, your perspective could be useful. And on top of that you, on your own practically, cracked the case neither me, nor Ron, had any idea how to solve. The office has been talking about it for weeks, everyone’s impressed with how you did it.’
‘Well… yes, but…’
‘What do you have? Give me something, anything, there needs to be a link somewhere in there!’ Harry said desperately, handing Draco a mug of cappuccino.
- Oh, look at you… - Ron laughed, clearly amused at Draco’s enthusiasm over Muggle food delivery. – A couple of months with Harry and you’re becoming a fan of Muggle lifestyle!
‘Well…’ She didn’t look at him.
- Mhm, yeah?
‘Predictable.’
Back in the room, all six of them crammed onto the bed. Harry and Draco were sitting side by side on the pillows while Ron, Hermione, Pansy and Nott were at the foot of the bed, facing them. Draco sighed and retold the whole story of what happened between him and Harry in the shower. When he was finished, Ron and Hermione were staring at him in disbelief while Pansy and Nott shook their heads, all colour completely gone from their faces. After what felt like eternity of silence, Nott spoke.
- Well, there you go, Hermione, I tried to talk to him like you said and I can’t even get through the door. – Ron Wesley was visibly angry at his girlfriend.
have sex with Malfoy and therefore there was nothing to dwell on.
- So… so this is why you wanted to be hurt?
- Yeah, he’s like that. He’ll help you if you put the work in. You know, “teach a man to fish” kind of thing. – She smiled.
‘Last I checked, they were testing antidote combinations. We don’t know what that potion was, there is no sample, so the healers can’t curate an antidote for it.’
‘No. He’s not dead, but…’ Hermione was still looking at her hands in her lap. ‘He’s really out of it. They’ve put him into a coma, but nobody knows what’s going to happen. He cut his hand with a broken vial, on accident, and some potion got into his blood. We don’t know what it was and what damage it did, but the guys thought you were both gone when they got you back here…’
He saw Harry drop one of his arms down, reaching for his own cock. Draco reacted on instinct, he grabbed the wrist and pulled Harry’s hand back up, locking it above his head. –
‘Something came for you an hour ago.’ Draco didn’t even look at him, but those the first words he spoke in nearly two weeks and Harry felt a pure, warm sensation spreading through him. He unrolled the parchment and gasped.
!’ Ron was flailing about raising his voice.
It all started with a sudden impression, that he smelled, very faintly, whatever it was that hugged him when he used to fall asleep in Potter’s bed. He opened the window to get some fresh air and felt a cold, winter breeze prick his skin – and that all of a sudden led to a flashback to how it felt when Potter stood from the couch after they managed to make some progress in the case. And how he felt before it. He hadn’t even registered it then, but now it was crystal clear – it was the same sensation as what Potter’s fingers closing on his wrist days prior gave him. What in Merlin’s name was going on with him? It wasn’t that he was falling in love with the git, that much he knew for sure, because no matter what people said, Draco knew how love felt. It wasn’t burning, it wasn’t leaving him unbearably cold when it went away, it was more of a sense of safety and tranquillity that spread through his veins. But if not love, than what? Hatred made no sense, because there would be relief the moment Potter’s bedroom door shut behind him and there wasn’t any of it – he would just feel cold and alone.
‘You know, Draco, sometimes I think we ought to have introduced some Muggle styles of parenting when you were growing up…’ Narcissa and Harry laughed. Draco looked taken aback for a second, but after a brief consideration, he joined them.
‘Minister, distinguished judges…’ She began, and Harry had a sudden premonition that he was not going to like it. ‘On the basis of what we’ve all just been told, I move to question Mr. Potter as a witness in this case before we move on to Mr. Malfoy.’ There was complete silence. Ron looked shocked – not even he was expecting this.
‘I see you really are moving on with whatever this is.’ Dean said. ‘And I was so naïve I thought it was just a phase…’
year ex-Gryffindors shaking their heads in disgust. Hermione looked like she was slapped in the face, Dean and Seamus exchanged pointed looks and Ron was bending his fork in his fist. A couple of feet away Ginny looked like she was petrified. So Ron must’ve talked to her about everything, Harry bitterly concluded.
Pansy stormed into their bedroom.
‘Well, he claims that my idea that Malfoy’s implicated in the case is why he’s stuck with him.’
- I’m sorry Mr. Potter, but Normani went back home for Christmas already… - Jeanelle was sincerely sorry, it was all over her face. – But if you’d like, we have a new girl here, you haven’t met her yet. Her name is Yasmine and she just started here around two months ago. She’s very different to Normani, but I think you’ll like her. All her clients speak very highly of her.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Fine, Malfoy, have it your way. Tonight – you, me, Harry and Neville. I’ll bring it – I don’t trust you enough to drink anything you give me. Grimmauld Place?’
- It worked.
‘You’re a masochist, Potter. This crap is more painful than the cut itself!’ The stinging didn’t go away at all. ‘Fine, have at it, try and seal this. But if I end up with even a scar, you’ll regret it!’
‘But… but why did you come up with this idea in the first place? You know that Ron will not hesitate to ask about everything!’
Someone had to be assigned a room with a student that used to be a different house. And that student sadly had to be a Gryffindor, since both Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws returned in even numbers. – she explained like she was speaking to a child.
- I do. And I remember you trying to convince me I was trying to kill myself. And now you’re hovering over me like some bloody dementor shoving God knows what down my throat!
- Exactly. If there was no last will and no living wife, her father’s money would have been split 3 ways between his daughters, so a third of it would be your mother’s. And just as with the money she had before, your father has no right to any of it. But then, it’s a double-edge sword. – She saddened. – Because that same lack of agreement that lets your mother keep the money, means that the Manor is owned only by your father and he can do whatever he wants with it. Well, you could look into other laws, there might be something that prohibits evicting your own wife, but as for you, I think it’s a lost cause…
- But that much? Draco, you wanted to kill him! – Pansy was visibly panicked.
- It’s ok, I know, we talked about it. – Harry was trying very hard no keep it casual next to Nott. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Nott visibly shaken. – Continue on, please.
‘As ready as I’ll ever be’ Harry smiled and they went through the gate, holding hands.
That was all he needed to say apparently, because the next thing he experienced was a lightning in his head when Draco pushed on finger into him. His head fell back and a cry ripped through him. He didn’t even care that he was being loud and they were still standing by the open window, all he was focused on was Draco placing open mouthed kisses on his neck, sucking at his pulse point ,while stretching him more and more. Harry never wanted this to end, but the need to actually feel Draco inside him was too strong.
‘But how do we even do this?’ Ron’s voice came from somewhere behind them.
No, God, not the ‘instinct’ again! Why was it that any time the ‘instinct’ came up, it always had something to do with Malfoy?
- Guys, there is a situation… - Draco mentally scolded himself. There was no time to start with a lengthy introduction, he needed to act fast.
‘Turns out not everything was according to procedures, so Wizengamot might throw their confessions out. And without them, they don’t have enough to keep you here for much longer.’ Seeing his father’s expression he quickly added: ‘Now, I don’t know what went wrong there or if it will even be enough to disregard their confessions. As I’ve been informed, the Auror office is still trying to assess the risk themselves. Which gives us a fighting chance.’
- Fuck, hell, fuck, shit, fuck…
‘Has the Dark Lord ever told you anything about this?’
- No, Theo. Don’t. Make it hurt. – Draco knew deep down he deserved the same pain he caused Harry, he wanted to feel it.
‘Not particularly.’
‘I do, but can’t I just lock him inside Grimmauld Place and go live in my apartment?’
‘Well, hello, Potter. I heard you thought I’ve offed myself after our little encounter last year, so here I am.’
- Back in the 6
- Hardly half. It was just a couple of bottles.
- That last one you’ve been reading. I borrowed it.
- You’re right Theo. – Draco sounded scared. – After I blacked out it stopped hurting so I wanted more.
‘What?’
‘Ok, maybe.’ Harry sighed in resignation. ‘Let’s assume for now you’re telling the truth. But how do I find those guys?’
On the other side of the door, Harry was not sleeping either. All is previous determination to not dwell on the ‘did I have sex with Malfoy’ issue was gone the second he remembered pressing himself against the blonde’s back. Why exactly did he do this? He could’ve just as well passed him the parchment. And why did he lean on Draco that second time? There was no logical reason for it.
‘You don’t…’ Harry was clearly shocked.
- Love, I want it too, but… - Draco sighed. He knew what he had to say, but it wasn’t easy. He had been picturing fucking him even before they got together, so it took all his willpower not to do it right then and there. But he knew Harry was far from ready for it just yet, he knew he would hurt him and possibly scar him for life doing this right now. If it was anybody else, what he heard would be all the consent he needed, but he didn’t want to do it to Harry, not to him. – We can’t do it right now. You’re a virgin, you aren’t ready for this yet. It takes time to prepare.
- I swear, I’m not lying. Why would I be? Does this mean something? My friend brought the sketch one day and we all liked it, I don’t know where he got it from.
The moment he stepped foot in Diagon Alley he started looking for any stray copy of the Daily Prophet he could snag, figuring that if he’s been outed it would be all over the front page. He had no luck however, the Diagon Alley seemed unusually clean. He sighed and decided to go back, he’ll need to try his luck elsewhere.
- What the bloody fuck was that? – The door to Dean’s and Seamus’ room opened and the two ex-Gryffindors ran into the common room. It was clear that every 8
- It was, he shouldn’t have inserted himself there. Seamus wasn’t offended by Malfoy’s comment, he actually found it funny. It wasn’t Ron’s business. But even so, what Malfoy did was way out of line. Turns out you can get out of being a Death Eater but you can’t get the Death Eater out of you.
‘So, boys, Ron’s telling me you two are… how do you young people say it?
- YOU HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING?! God, and I thought you two were going to be good for each other! You dumped Draco, he’s worse than ever, I haven’t seen him sober for days, and now he does THIS and you’re telling me you haven’t done anything?! How much of a thick, self-centred arsehole are you?!
‘I swear to God, if you finish this question, you will not get out of here alive…’ Harry’s voice was barely audible and his face was completely white. He reached for his wand and pointed it at Weasley’s face. For the first time in his life, Draco was actually terrified of Harry.
‘I am ashamed, yes. But I love him.’ Draco didn’t even know where it came from. But now it was out there and he was horrified – not because the other two knew, but because Harry knew, and Draco’s heart was now completely at his mercy.
‘I don’t know. I’m just saying, first you
‘We are Mrs. Wesley. In fact, we’re getting married.’ He noticed the expression on her face and quickly added: ‘We talked a lot, both with Draco and Mrs. Malfoy, and they have really come a long way since the war. I know you probably have your reservations and I understand them, but I’m happy and I’d really like for this to work out, you know?’
‘Jesus, how do you not know this?’ Harry laughed slightly. A little bit of the bitterness lifted. ‘It’s like friends who have sex without actually being together.’
‘Oh, Drakey, you’ll always be my little baby boy. What took you so long anyway? I was worried sick!’
‘His hand! I didn’t do it!’
Regardless of the fact that Harry Potter was now apparently both the reason (well, one of the reasons) for Draco’s failed suicide attempt, as well as the reason for him not to try it again, Draco was firm on ignoring Potter for the sake of his own (incredibly fragile, it appeared) mental stability. On his part, Harry didn’t look like he was too keen on even making conversation either.
- I’m fine with it if Draco is. Theo, if you want, you can come too. It’s only fair for both of us to have equal support through this. Draco, are you ok with them being there?
They walked up to the house in silence. When they got to the door, it opened soundlessly and this time, thankfully, all of them were able to step inside without issues.
- Since when do you even take into consideration how I’m feeling? – Harry had to concentrate very hard to not ask Ron why on Earth would he take his feelings into consideration when his happiness didn’t hurt anybody.
‘Why? Any experiences you’re willing to share?’ He tried to shake the bitterness of, but it didn’t leave him.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. ‘You don’t realize how good you have it until you think what you’d have to go through without magic, do you? I used to have to do all those things back at the Dursleys.’
‘Hmmmm… I don’t see any pattern…’ Draco muttered, studying the list.
‘I figured it was better to live in Azkaban than be dead anywhere else.’
‘What?!’ Ron was shaking his head. ‘No, there is NO way I’m agreeing to this! She can’t be locked up somewhere with this lunatic!’
goes wrong, you run, understand?’
Draco, on the other hand, once he snapped completely out of the daze the room at the Manor put him in, wasn’t showing any signs of improvement. The gash on his arm was still open and the only reason it wasn’t bleeding was copious amounts of various potions and spells, and nobody seemed to be able to close it. Even Hermione, who showed up the same day Harry said his first full sentence (apparently the nurse found her petrified on the floor just minutes after Draco ran out), seemed at a loss of ideas on how to deal with the injury.
was out of the question entirely – he didn’t have his wand, he left it in Scotland, and he wasn’t going to off himself with Potter’s one. It seemed inappropriate and he knew that it would be rather difficult for Potter to prove that he wasn’t the one to kill Draco (although why that particular aspect of it stood out to him, Draco had no idea).  Then, there was a possibility of poisoning himself – that would prove rather difficult, he concluded, since Potter seemed to rely heavily on Muggle medicine, at least judging by the contents of his bathroom cabinet, and Draco had absolutely zero idea what any of the little white pills might be for – they all looked the same to him and the names (or what he assumed to be names, for they were displayed on the labels of the bottles) gave him no indication whatsoever. He immediately disregarded any of the methods he considered ‘violent’ like shooting (why did Potter keep a Muggle gun in his drawer anyway?) or hanging himself – he knew he looked bad enough already, there was no need to do any more damage than strictly necessary. By sunrise, Draco came to a conclusion that the only viable option was slitting his wrists.
- You need to get out of this rut you’ve been in, Draco. – Nott said, handing his friend a bottle of Firewhisky.
- Okay now, close your eyes and take a deep breath. Try and relax. I’m going to go slowly, ok? – Harry nodded and closed his eyes. He was tense, but it wasn’t entirely unpleasant.
‘So he says. I’ll need to question him formally, but as you can see, he’s denying everything. And if we just let him go, he’ll just fall of the grid again.’ Ron looked worried.
‘I don’t know! I haven’t been here, I got an owl from Ginny and…’
‘Once again, Ron, he did not
- There aren’t. And I can’t go on like this, I haven’t eaten anything besides bread for days now, I can’t do it any longer.
- Come on, you can tell me. We’ve been friends forever, if you can’t tell me stuff, who are you going to turn to?
- no, not that voice again! He was in no shape to talk to himself right now, he needed to get rid of that voice immediately. Ok, breathe in, breathe out, focus. You’re into women and Malfoy, that much is safe to assume. But what about other guys? Harry tried to imagine his other friends in this particular scenario. Neville, Seamus, Dean, Ron… Oh God, not Ron! No, definitely nothing.
The coma didn’t work exactly as the healers would’ve expected – actually, it did at first, but the more time has passed, the more Harry became aware of what was going on around him. He heard the hushed voices of people in the room, he felt the cold from the open window bite him, he knew that Draco was next to him. The only thing he wasn’t able to do was to tell, or even indicate in some other way, that he was fully conscious under the appearance of sleep. So he laid there, taking in all the sounds of his hospital room, trying to shake off the last remnants of whatever potion he’s been given, to fully wake up and tell everyone he was ok. He felt weak, but luckily there was no pain, so he was more concerned about Draco than himself really.
- I knew that. To me it doesn’t matter, I ended up alive because of what she did and that’s all the Wizengamot needed to know. If I told the truth, she would end up in Azkaban with your father and I knew by then that you were getting off, so I didn’t want you to end up an orphan like me.
- I can’t tell you, I’m sorry. But I wouldn’t wish it upon anybody to be in his position right now.
- Enough, Draco. This time you went too far. – He whispered. – Come on, we’re going.
‘Sure, of course, I’ll go see some mediocre shrink and tell him that I’ve made a guy I hated, who has been missing for months, kill himself by the virtue of my very own existence!’ Harry snapped. Ron didn’t exactly understand his best friend – if all Harry did was stumble upon Malfoy somewhere in Muggle London, why would it be his fault that Malfoy decided to off himself? There must have been something else, something more, but they went over this dozens of times by now, and Harry insisted that they only talked briefly. At some point Ron came to a conclusion that Malfoy just must have been ashamed of being seen by someone from the Wizarding community and couldn’t live with it, but it didn’t make sense why Harry would blame himself.
He didn’t. In fact, he was determined not to know why.
‘Your guess is as good as mine...’ Harry hesitated. ‘He’s clearly out of his mind.’
‘There has to be something in there, I know it. We just can’t crack it.’ Draco was determined to find the answer. He
For a second everything went completely dark as Draco felt a searing pain tearing along his spine. He didn’t know where it came from or what was it, it was like nothing he could even imagine. He didn’t know if he came right then and there when he screamed just as he felt whoever was fucking him came inside of him.
Draco was back on the windowsill again. Why exactly did Potter’s confession shock him like that? He knew he was good at
- More or less. Usually they would ask if you have a clientele you attract, you know, to see if you’ll be a good fit for their profile, but since you haven’t done this before it’s not an issue.
‘I’m sorry Draco, it wasn’t my decision. And I swore I wouldn’t tell anyone, not even you.’ Lucius hung his head. ‘I don’t know how to open it, I don’t even know if the Dark Lord opened it himself after he created it. All I know it was sealed with my blood and enchantments in parseltongue. As to what’s inside – I have seen several things like potions and vials of blood, a couple of books, but I don’t know the details.’
- You’re a lunatic Potter! – Draco didn’t register how, but he was on Potter’s bed checking his pulse. It seemed fine, thank Merlin. – You need to go to the Hospital Wing now! Or better yet, to Slughorn!
- No, no, no. – Draco sighed. – It has nothing to do with being a pushover. It’s just that sometimes a person, an otherwise very well-functioning, independent adult, gets into this mindset where they need to relinquish all control over their lives to someone else. It can happen on its own or because of something that happened to them in a particular situation. Sometimes, if they are in a long enough relationship with a person that is willing to gain that control, which is called a “dominant”, the other person can provoke their partner to get into that headspace with particular actions or words.
‘God, I’d never tell you this if I was sober, but…’ Draco didn’t look at him. It was clear he was embarrassed. ‘but yeah. I mean, I saw you in that towel that time and…’
- So you say, I would like to give someone full control over my life? – Harry didn’t seem convinced.
- You all right sweetheart? – He asked casually. Draco’s heart jumped up to his throat. He was desperately trying to not show how panicked he was.
‘Will you all stop with the accusations?! Is this going to go like that EVERY case?!’ Harry blew up. He couldn’t stand it anymore.
‘No buts, Draco. Screw all of them.’
‘And how exactly are you going to accomplish that? You’re stuck here with me until I give my deposition, they won’t let you leave me alone. And besides, Weasley will not even consider you questioning these snatchers, he thinks I messed with your head and he’ll think you’ll do anything to protect me.’
‘No, I don’t have that.’ Potter said, disappointed. ‘But I might recruit some trainee to compile a list! Merlin, this is exciting, I need to talk to Ron about this!’ He jumped to his feet. Suddenly, it occurred to Draco how close to each other they were sitting – he felt a chilly breeze lick his side where it has been pressed against Potter.
I hope you'll enjoy what I've come up with :) There is going to be more Ron, Hermione and the others later in case you wondered!
- What are the last two anyway? Your handwriting is atrocious!
– a voice in his head said. He shook his head trying to silence it.
‘He did. He never should’ve talked to you about this case. Why did he anyway? Was Ron right? You never answered.’
They talked for hours that night, Draco crying and trying to convince Harry that he really loved him, that he never wanted anybody to get hurt. It was almost sunrise when he managed to fall asleep, still not knowing if Harry believed him that he was ashamed of himself and terrified of his recent actions.
That night, lying in Draco’s bedroom, wrapped in his arms, Harry felt like he might after all fit in with Draco’s family, regardless of what Lucius thought about it – they had a plan, after all, and they didn’t need his approval when all the love Narcissa has shown them so far was more than enough to feel supported.
- It’s obvious. Malfoy is still, and if you ask me, he will always be, what he is. He was always a bully and last year he probably became even worse. You can’t change that, not even with whatever the two of you are doing in your room.
‘I’m not an idiot, thank you very much. I’ve added flour, eggs, butter and water.’
Through the sound of distant cheering of the group of Slytherins by the Lake and the feeling of pure bliss that seemed to hug them both in a pleasant mist, neither of them heard a muffled “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me!” that came from the direction of the castle, where Ron stood rooted to the spot in pure disbelief.
‘You want this?’
- Trust me, hardly anybody would want to be in your situation. You’ve been shoved into being a leader practically since you came to Hogwarts that 1
‘What do you mean
‘Ready for this?’ Draco asked warily.
- I know, I know. What you’ve been through would discourage anyone from being in charge, and the fact that I’m most likely right about who you are only amplified that.
Two days later, it turned out that he was right. He was just getting ready for bed, when Ron and Hermione stepped into his living room. He was about to tell them to leave him alone when he saw Ron had a black eye.
‘There, the second line from the top. While he was spying on you, Ron found the remnants of what looked like a campsite. At first we didn’t consider it because we thought you were the one to make it. But then you told me you’ve lived in that hut for a year, so the campsite must be somebody else’s…’
‘Oh my God, you ARE suicidal! You were planning to cut your own wrists right here right now!’
‘You’ve put me in an impossible situation! I’m locked in here with Malfoy, I’m going stir crazy! I can’t fucking sleep because of it and now apparently I’m drunk at 7 a.m.!’
- No, no, it’s not her. She was actually really sweet. I told them about the sub thing and she completely understood what I meant. She seemed ok with it all, me being what I am, you explaining all of this…
his unhelpful brain prompted) was just the testament of how good he’s gotten at managing his own orgasms over the years. But then, why would he find Potter’s enthusiasm over the case that much endearing? And what was with the instinctive agreeing to Potter’s offer (because no matter how much he didn’t want to admit it to himself, if he was to refuse it, he would’ve done it flat out, not said he was going to think about it). He groaned and got up from the couch. He needed to figure this out, and figure this out quickly, because those sleepless nights didn’t agree with him. He was rapidly loosing weight again and his brain was getting all foggy. So once again, Draco was back on the windowsill, smoking and trying to analyse what on Earth was going on with him.
- Well, if you put it like that, maybe we ought to help. Regardless of what he’s done, he’s one of us and we had it bad enough already.
‘Something happened.’ Draco was suddenly petrified with fear. Potter was going to tell Weasley all about his state…
- No, I like it, but why?
Draco’s throat closed up. He couldn’t even force himself to look at any of the people in the room. He dropped his head and managed to utter only ‘I did.’
- So far! You don’t know if you’ll wake up tomorrow after what you downed! – Draco was frantically leafing through the book to find the chapter Potter “consulted”. If the list was taken from his book, maybe he would be able to figure out what the last two ingredients of Potter’s little cocktail were.
- Yes it is! Merlin, of all people, he is the one I can’t see you with. It’s one thing to support your friend when he’s gay, but you falling for this… tosser – Potter winced at what Wesley said – is a whole other barrel of Acromantula eggs.
- Hi Neville, is Ron there? – Harry tried to be as calm as possible, despite his heart practically crushing his ribs.
- Sorry, teach a man to what? – Draco was visibly confused.
- I got it. – Pansy looked flushed and out of breath. – Slughorn wasn’t even asking too many questions, he just wanted to know who was stupid enough to take this.
‘You know, your behaviour back in the…’ Potter sighed ‘back in the place. I saw you were terrified to be found there, at what must have been your lowest, and I just thought that nobody needs to know that. That nobody needs this sort of thing being put on blast about them.’
‘TOILETS?!’ Draco looked appalled. ‘With your hands?! Merlin, no way! Never in a million years!’
- Well… - Harry hesitated. He wasn’t sure that pouring his heart out to the blonde was the best course of action, but somehow, at the same time, it didn’t seem like a completely idiotic idea.
‘I know, but MALFOY?!’ Weasley seemed outraged. ‘Don’t you think it’s irresponsible to trust his ideas?’
- Do you want ME to cook? I have never held a frying pan in my hand!
‘Wait, you don’t mean…’ Harry looked frightened ‘…you don’t mean they would attack a person?’
‘Actually, you.’
- I don’t know, I just… I just don’t. I have no idea how to explain it, it’s weird to me too. I was so used to hating him for over seven years now that I can’t wrap my head around it.
At any rate, do let me know what you think! Like I said, this is my first fic and I'll be really grateful for tips of what you liked and what you didn't!
came back.
‘Withdrawal…’ Draco managed between sobs. ‘I can’t take it… Please… Help me…’ He didn’t even care how pathetic he must look.
‘Fine, I’ll gladly go! Believe me, I have no interest in staying here!’
- I think I should be the one to explain this, actually. – Nott looked up at Draco searching for permission. When Draco nodded, he continued. – I never said I wasn’t into it, I said Draco takes it much further than I do. At least on the receiving end of things. – He sighed. – Merlin, I would’ve never thought I’d be explaining my sex life to my friend’s boyfriend, let alone with an audience, but here we go: we both like hurting people during sex. Now, don’t panic just yet, it’s not like getting fucked without lube or getting sliced up is a normal occurrence for either of us, tonight was way beyond anything I have personally ever done to another person. When I said we’re “not compatible” I meant that when Draco’s the top everything is, well, pretty normal, at least for people like us. There is some pain, because that’s what we like, but he hasn’t done anything I wouldn’t agree to or I would regret agreeing to. There wasn’t any serious or permanent damage, if you know what I mean. And I knew he wouldn’t go further without my permission. Now, when we switched, it was a whole different story. I don’t know if it was this particular situation, both those 2 years ago and tonight, or if he’s always like that, that’s for him to explain, but he wanted much more pain and, well, frankly, abuse, than I was comfortable with. Honestly, I don’t know if I should or shouldn’t be telling you this, but the only reason he ended up with only that one gash tonight, is because I forced myself to come earlier than I would’ve normally, because I could feel he wanted more than that. – Silence fell over the group. Everyone was looking at their own hands not knowing how to react. It took a couple of seconds for Draco to speak.
‘Minister, they can’t! You just said it, Malfoy’s involved! AGAIN!’ Ron was flailing his arms and screaming.
Harry didn’t even register his journey back to Grimmauld Place. His head was throbbing and his thoughts were all jumbled up – Neville was dead, someone killed him in Harry’s own house, and now Harry was the main suspect of the case. And as if that wasn’t enough the case was being investigated by Malfoy. He was just reaching the conclusion that things couldn’t possibly get any worse, when he heard tapping on his living room window. He approached and saw a small barn owl sitting on a windowsill, holding a piece of parchment. With a heavy heart, Harry opened the window and took the parchment.
- I bloody live with you, they’ll blame me! – That was only part of the reason Draco was freaking out, but Potter didn’t need to know that.
- Jesus, what the fuck did you do?!
‘Yeah, but it doesn’t mean they would do this!’ Draco was fully crying by now.
‘It’s not true!’
‘Harry, don’t be ridiculous! Of course we’ll do it!’ Hermione interrupted.
‘I don’t know. You might.’
- Hey Ron, I actually really have to discuss something with you. – Still calm, ok, so far it’s not entirely bad.
until you crack the case.’ And with that, Kingsley left their office. All Harry could manage after being ordered to basically be Malfoy’s nanny for the foreseeable future was a very loud, and very work-inappropriate
‘I’m fine. And besides, it’s not like we have that kind of relationship…’ Draco felt a wave of bitterness filling him. After all the events of the recent weeks they didn’t exactly have
- I am. Completely. I love you, you know. – He leaned in to kiss Draco and moved his hand down, below the waistband of Draco’s sweats.
- That’s the second comment about my arse you’ve blurted out since you decided to grace the world with your presence this morning, Potter. Are you gay for me or are you just now learning how to appreciate the finer things in life? – Draco decided he wasn’t going let that slide. It was his time to have some fun for once.
Draco decided that he needed to be honest with himself for once. There was no need to keep up appearances in his own head – nobody was exactly there to probe around in his thoughts anymore, not with Bellatrix dead and his father in Azkaban (he really should be more upset by the fact that he probably won’t see Lucius ever again, but somehow it didn’t bother him – his mother got out on the virtue of saving Harry Potter in the Forbidden Forest and that was all that mattered. He had all he wanted.), so what was the point in burying all he truly felt somewhere deep?
With his mind mostly at ease about this, Harry started to think more and more about the physical aspect of his relationship with Draco. He knew Draco said they were going to take things slowly and Harry was grateful for it, but some part of him was starting to wonder if Draco wouldn’t loose interest in him. After all, it was December, they’ve been together for three months now, and so far they’ve only gone as far as kissing. He was mauling this over for a couple of days before deciding he needed to broach the subject himself – he figured Draco was probably waiting for him to do that. So one Friday evening, two weeks before Christmas, Harry decided to take action.
‘Harry, please, don’t. I’m not going to fall apart.’ Draco tried to smile, but he was too scared of what Shacklebolt was planning. ‘What is it, Minister?’
‘You’re lying.’
- No, Ron’s just being stupid. So what if you’re gay? I don’t care. My uncle is and he’s one of the funniest people I know. Of course, I’m kind of worried for you with the – Neville was visibly searching for words and Harry was starting to feel uneasy – other stuff, but that’s your choice. No one can tell you how to live your life, you know?
- Oh, don’t be so dramatic, not now.
‘Yes, they’re in the garden, I’ll have Ginny fetch them. Is everything all right? Where are you anyway? I thought your house wasn’t hooked up to the network…’
Ron wasn’t sure if his conclusion that he didn’t, in fact, stumble onto Malfoy’s path, made him relieved or worried – there was some hope in him that maybe if it in fact was Draco, there would be a chance for Harry to snap out of his mourning. But that wasn’t possible – the longer Ron looked at the person, the more he was sure that if he saw his left forearm (still invisible to him, buried in the tall weeds) there would be no Dark Mark there.
He was walking through the grounds alone, thoughts swirling in his head. His discussion with Ron and Hermione only proved one thing – he was right that Ron wouldn’t understand. Hermione seemed supportive, but it was hardly any consolation. Halfway through the grounds he realised something surprising – all his heated hatred and disgust at Ron’s comments didn’t stem from feeling betrayed, like it would make sense, but from the fact that Harry couldn’t understand how could Ron be so blindly against Draco. The accusations he so freely threw and the Slytherin were what made Harry so livid. Couldn’t Ron see that Draco was a different person now? That he had changed? That he had dropped all of his previous self-absorbance and aristocratic tendencies and  was actually revealing his true self? And that that other side of Draco was actually a good person that was forced into a bad situation he didn’t see any way out of? Harry stopped dead in his tracks. The comprehension hit him over the head like one of the branches on the Whomping Willow. He really was falling for Draco. It wasn’t just that he needed someone to be there for him and Draco was conveniently there. He somehow, subconsciously sought him out and that was why all of his bottled up feelings from the last couple of months came pouring out last night. It wasn’t because he nearly died and he needed to vent to someone. It was because it was Draco. And Harry loved him.
‘Merlin, do you HAVE to be so loud?’ Draco spat. ‘I’ve just fallen asleep!’
‘It sounds like Muggles spend a lot of time in school…’ Narcissa remarked. ‘I wonder if maybe we should try and borrow some of that for our system. Clearly, judging by you two, we could use some more general survival courses…’
It took some time for the person to be done with whatever it was he was doing, so Ron waited patiently on his scour post on the boulder. He decided that confronting whoever this was right there in the middle of the field was a bad idea and it would be much safer to just follow him home and talk then. He was wary of the possibility that there might be the rest of the snatchers there, but he was certain that he would be able to defend himself if that was the case, and accidentally attracting Muggle’s attention with a confrontation out in the open wasn’t worth the risk. So he sat there, almost until sunrise, not letting himself look away from the figure in the field. Finally, when the bottom of Ron’s robes was completely soaked through by morning dew, the person collected his herbs and turned around, seemingly heading to wherever it was he was living.
‘Keep talking.’ Ron’s voice was uncharacteristically quiet.
‘Exactly, Dean, why do you care?’ Suddenly Ginny seemed to be on their side.
‘Why what?’
‘I’m really sorry for this. I shouldn’t have. I’m really grateful that you invited me here with Harry but I think you’d rather spend this evening without me.’ He pushed his chair back to leave, but was promptly stopped by Molly standing up.
Draco thought he was going to pass out. There was no way out of this, there was no way he could fix this. He always thought he would be able to rise to a challenge in a time of a crisis, but this was a fuckup of utterly epic proportions and he had no idea how to handle it, short for reaching for the razor again. But this was not an option right now, at least not with Granger sitting there looking at him. He was just starting to think that maybe if he somehow got hold of her wand there would be a chance for him, when the door opened and the small wizard came back again to escort him downstairs to listen to the verdict.
‘Of all the nights you chose tonight to go out? You couldn’t drink at home?’
‘On what grounds?’ Kingsley was sceptical.
‘Muggle thing. They sell whipped cream in long thin cans that come with a nozzle and you can spray it onto whatever you’re eating, already whipped.’
‘You mean Potter? That whole thing a year ago was his fault. Although I suppose he sold you a completely fabricated story…’
An hour later, Harry had an entirely different set of problems on his mind – he presented his proposal of employing Draco Malfoy, as his assistant, to his boss, and he thought it was going well, until the Chief announced that before he could make a decision, he needed to talk to Ron. Harry knew that, since Ron and him were partners, Ron’s opinion of Draco might be a potential issue, but he was hoping the Chief wouldn’t directly involve him in the process. But he did, and now Harry was sitting in his office panicking – with Ron’s attitude there was no way this was going to work out. He was just starting to go through every other potential job for Draco, when the door banged open and Ron marched inside furious.
‘Draco, please… I’m sure they know what they’re…’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Would you be prepared to confront your father?’
- Well, it is Malfoy. But… - He decided to tell them both the whole truth. It wouldn’t be fair to force Hermione to keep secrets from her boyfriend for him, and besides, Ron might actually have some good insights, if he managed not to blow up like he often did.
‘Draco Lucius Malfoy, do you mean to tell me that you have proposed and it was not the first thing out of your mouth when you saw me?!’
- No, I’m not ok! – Harry bellowed – Bloody McGonagall won’t let me switch rooms! She says it’s the “safest option”, because apparently I’m the only one that can defend themselves against that fucking pathetic excuse of a Death Eater!
‘Yes, I know, you’re innocent, blah-blah-blah…’ Malfoy rolled his eyes. ‘Lucky for you, someone recognized you at Hog’s Head, so for now, your alibi checks out. At least until we get a more detailed report on the autopsy that would tell us specifically when Longbottom died. Or until the almost-widow is finished answering questions. In any case, as much as it pains me, I can’t keep you locked any longer, so for tonight, you’re free to go.’ He turned around to leave. ‘Oh, almost forgot – you’re not allowed to leave London. There will be seals placed on your house in the morning and someone will come to put a tracker on you around 8 a.m..’
- Yes, I do know, but why me? And with Malfoy?! That seems hardly fair!
- And why is that? Why is Malfoy more trustworthy than me and Hermione?
‘I don’t know. I presented my point of view and he believed it.’
Silence fell between them as they smoked. It wasn’t exactly uncomfortable, but Harry felt something weird, something like longing, rising in him. He decided he needed a drink.
- Harry, please… - Hermione tried to plead – people are staring…
He took a deep breath and made up his mind – his fellow ex-Slytherins were still up, if he asked one of them to go find Slughorn and ask for help, they will surely lend a hand. On shaky legs, he made his way back to the common room. Zabini was no longer there, but Nott and Parkinson were still sitting by the fire discussing something.
‘That I wasn’t what, Potter?’ Somehow, flustering the other man like that seemed funny. ‘Jesus, don’t be a prude, spit it out.’
‘Have you read Skeeter’s bullshit?’ Ron asked.
‘Weirdly, he seems tamed. He’s still walking around like he owns the place, but he doesn’t insult people. For now, at least. Once he gets comfortable, or, God forbid, actually becomes an Auror, he’s going to be insufferable…’ Ron scowled.
- Boyfriend? – Harry looked at Draco hopefully. – Does this mean we’re working this out?
‘Draco…’ Harry forced his chin up. ‘Draco, I love you. I have for a long time. I was just scared you didn’t, so I didn’t say anything.’
So, how's my attempt at writing safe and fully consensual sex? It's the first full scene of this particular kind I have ever written, so do let me know :) I might go back to the severly-more-rough practices at some point, but I'm thinking that's more of a sequel material after I wrap up this one (I kind of have a rough idea for a part 2, but nothing's set in stone yet, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated!)
year was wondering what was going on with Potter and Malfoy. It was Friday by now, and Potter was nowhere to be found since Wednesday morning – nobody has seen him in classes or the Great Hall and the door to his room was permanently shut. Malfoy didn’t seem like he was doing well either – he was sitting in the back staring blankly at the wall during every lesson, seemingly oblivious to the world around him. Even while being yelled at by McGonagall for failing to turn in his essay on safety procedures in human transfiguration, he didn’t react.
The thought of house elves was like a sharp pain. All of a sudden he remembered Dobby dying in his arms not even a year prior and his eyes started to sting. God damn, this was no time for crying! He barely managed to compose himself, but as soon as he felt strong enough to walk again, the memory of empty Grimmauld Place 12 ended up in his head. He didn’t know why, but somehow it was even worse than what happened to Dobby. Maybe because he didn’t have a clue what happened to Kreacher?
‘Trust me, they are. And besides, if I was part of that scheme do you honestly thing I would do it for free? I wouldn’t be living in that God forsaken place if I had a way to make money and get out of there.’
‘It’s… it’s normal, I guess. Just sex. You do it, you feel good for a second while you come and then you just go back to your life.’ He glanced up hesitantly. ‘I’m sure all sex works that way if you think about it.’
Harry was dead. His parents were dead. He was completely alone again and everyone knew it was entirely his fault. Everyone knew what he had been all his life, and where his choices led, not only him, but anyone he ever loved. The only option now was to just vanish, cease to exist, erase himself from all history and everyone’s memories. If only he knew how to do that, how to go beyond simply killing himself, and how to create a world where he never existed in the first place, he wouldn’t hesitate to do anything necessary to achieve it. He would’ve sacrificed his own soul for it – except he didn’t have a soul anymore, he was just a body. Or did he never had a soul in the first place? It didn’t matter, tearing himself to shreds wouldn’t accomplish anything – something, he didn’t know if it was inside him or somewhere outside, told him, that the only way to achieve what he wanted, what he
about it.
- Yeah, I’ve known him since I was 14, he’s like a father figure to me. I come here every morning to hang out on my way back from work. Of course, Henry doesn’t know what I do, he’d throw me out if he knew. He thinks I’m a night receptionist at a hotel. You saw his attitude towards, well, our line of work.
the events?’ Potter’s face lit up. Surprisingly, Draco found this image absurdly sweet. ‘Consider this: they go to a location. They select the victim and they need to find out if it’s a viable target. We already established that the potential victim’s reaction to some sort of magical incident would prove if they are a witch or wizard and if they have someone to talk to. So they provoke a reaction themselves!’
- What the hell was that?! – Zabini exploded once the doors were locked and protective and silencing charms were in place.
He turned to the side, pressed his chest to his boyfriend’s back and lightly ran his fingertips along Harry’s bottom. When he heard Harry breathe out, he brushed his lips on the Gryffindor’s ear and reached for his wand. He quickly muttered a lubrication spell and began circling his boyfriend’s entrance. “Tell me how you’re feeling…” he whispered, but Harry could only manage an encouraging moan. “Tell me” – it wasn’t an order anymore, he just needed to make sure Harry was okay with what they were doing. He felt the brunette’s hips push back against his hand and understood everything. There was no greed in him this time, he wasn’t doing this for himself, but to make Harry feel just as he felt minutes ago. They both went slowly, pressed together, Draco’s right arm wrapped around Harry’s chest, fingers entangled in Harry’s own hand, while his left delicately stretched his boyfriend out. There was no need to rush things this time, it felt so right doing this this way that Draco was happy to wait for each squeeze Harry gave his hand before adding another finger. The room was filled only with the sound of their breathing and Draco was listening intently for any hitch, any sign of distress from Harry, but they didn’t come. Instead, Harry turned his head, looking Draco in the eyes and whispered “I’m ready”. Draco leaned in to kiss him and removed his fingers. He flipped Harry on his back, and wrapped his legs around his own waist, not breaking the kiss. “Are you completely sure baby?” he asked, looking down on his boyfriend. Harry seemed certain, but he needed to be extra careful. “I am. I need you.”.
‘I tried to kill myself a few months ago.’ It didn’t matter to Draco that they knew. Harry still hasn’t said anything about his love confession and that was making him afraid.
? Without magic? Like, no brooms?’ Draco clearly didn’t understand.
Ok, so as you most probably gathered by now, I have zero knowledge of dom/sub relationships. This is just how I understand it - if any of you feel offended by my take on it, I sincerely apologize, and feel free to explain in the comments.
‘But… but how?’ Neville was the one to break the silence.
‘Well then, remember how Ron told you I wanted to help you over a year ago? I thought that maybe if you had a place to live and a job you’d be willing to come back from the Muggle side, so I came up with the idea that… that I would give you keys to Grimmauld Place, you know, since I don’t use it anyway, and that maybe you’d work with me in the Office. You were acquitted, but you still were a part of, well, that side, so I thought that your perspective on some things might be useful.’ He had the same expression on his face as when he admitted Draco was the best sex of his life.
When he first woke up, Draco didn’t recognize the room. Everything around him was starkly white and completely silent. When the initial shock passed and his eyes got used to the light again, he looked around. It looked like he was lying in a hospital bed –
‘And what would you do if I said yes?’
‘Well, you’ve been sort of…’ Ron hesitated ‘used by a band of snatchers running a scam, trying to convince elderly wizards that Death Eaters were on the rise again and that they, those snatchers, would provide protection against them. And they’ve been pointing you out to people as evidence.’
- It’s a poison you stupid wanker! If you dilute it enough it would just numb everything or possibly knock you out, but you can take just a couple of drops per gallon of water!
‘Spare me.’ Draco laughed dryly. ‘You know as well as I do there is no coming back from this. I might as well just end it all now and be done with it.’
- Somehow I don’t believe you. – Draco thought his hand on Harry’s shoulder must’ve done the trick, because Harry was way calmer now.
‘I know! I think this calls for a cherry!’
‘Dunno. I told you, I’m rubbish at this sort of thing.’
It didn’t help that his carefully selected combination of herbs, designed to make him forget about everything he has ever experienced in his life, was far out of his reach, left behind in his hut in Scotland when Weasley came and forced him to come back to London. And to think the damn redhead showed up merely weeks after Draco managed to perfect the blend! The first attempt made him jittery and anxious, the second rendered him unconscious for days, the third made him excruciatingly hungry and the fourth seemed to set his lungs on fire – it was only after months of trial and error that he finally figured out the correct ratios to just feel calm, collected and – for once – not in pain. And now it was all gone – just like everything he ever had, he concluded bitterly and sighed. The universe seemed to be conspiring against him, for as soon as anything even remotely positive shined on the horizon, it was promptly snatched away, sending Draco into complete darkness over and over again. He groaned and turned to the side. He was too exhausted to battle all the crap that his life has become, so it seemed like getting some sleep was a reasonable idea.
year all over again and Harry didn’t trust him enough to share how he got his name into the Goblet of Fire. He felt completely stupid – it seemed like he hasn’t matured a day since then, just like all those years ago he lashed out on his best friend out of something that wasn’t even there. Because if he really focused and tried to understand what Harry was
Draco’s heart stopped. So Potter really told everyone how Draco was getting by on his exile. His mouth became dry and his vision got blurry. He ran out of Diagon Alley. He was never coming back, the last remnants of hope he kept alive deep down died. There was truly no place for him in the wizarding world anymore.
‘Sod off, Malfoy. It’s a difficult case and me being stuck here with you doesn’t help. If I was able to go into the office at least I would have someone to bounce ideas off of.’
Catching Kingsley’s glance Harry tried to silently plead for the Minister to let them leave the pensive. Kingsley seemed to understand because he nodded and the next thing Harry registered was all of them landing back in Ron’s and Neville’s office.
- You didn’t need to go there with Potter, you know? – Fantastic, Zabini was on Pansy’s side.
- Uh, okay… - Harry sighed. – It’s just that… We’ve been together for some time now, and I know you are willing to wait for me, but… - He didn’t know how to put it without causing a problem. – But I thought you might loose interest, so I acted.
- Don’t interrupt him! – Hermione decided to reign her boyfriend in. – Go on, Harry.
‘It means a lot to have your support in this, honestly.’ Harry smiled, trying to convene how grateful he was. ‘But what about you, Draco? Have you thought about your career?’
- What?! Did you not hear me when I told you this could kill you?!
‘That was actually Harry’s idea, Minister.’ To Ron’s right, Draco was looking like he was about to say something, but he was promptly silenced by Shacklebolt’s raised hand.
‘Fine, let it be. You two keep your secrets. But let me ask you this, Malfoy: how can you even touch him knowing what you were before? Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?’
Draco, on the other hand, had no idea why Potter went back to being so guarded after their conversation.
