"What?" Draco asked blankly. "Are there sides, Striker? Why are there sides?"
It was hard to imagine that Black would have been let back into the fold with the Order if he had really been the one to betray James and Lily Potter. Either he wasn't guilty, or he'd at least managed to convince the side of light that he wasn't. His redemption in their eyes must have come years too late, though, with one of the Order, Peter Pettigrew, challenging him to a duel over the Potters' death. Poor old Uncle Sirius would have been forced to fight him, and the duel had gone bad. Yes, killing Pettigrew and twelve Muggles with a single blasting curse was a bit excessive, but Draco couldn't say it wasn't the kind of thing he himself might end up doing by accident sooner or later, with the overpowered talon wand.
Luna nodded bravely, and let him braid her hair while she put on her Sleeping Beauty necklace, with the matching pair of spiral turquoise earrings he'd made her this Christmas: what he pretentiously called her parure already, with the hope of many birthdays and Christmases to come to add more matching pieces.
"You."
into coming back, at least. You can be really persuasive when you want to be."
In the chaos, it had been easy to forget the promised date was fast-approaching. Draco would be disappointed if the attack on Mr. Weasley kept Sirius from proposing before the students had to go back. He certainly had no intention of handing over the rings without being sure he'd be there to watch. If Remus tried to say no, Draco had thought once or twice, he wasn't above a sneaky Imperius curse or two under the table.
"Protego horribilis!" Draco cast, before a flurry of curses flew down red and green over him, battering at him with no concern for Lucius's body beside him. Maybe they thought Draco had already killed him. Draco looked up and every one of the Death Eaters had been drawn by the screams like sharks to blood, advancing closer.
"I don't tell my mother anything anymore," Draco sighed, and Hermione propped up her chin on her hand.
boy. Consider this my consultation with one of Hogwarts' foremost experts on dark magic- save, of course, for that expert's godfather-"
"Deletrius!" Mr. Diggory shouted, and the smoky skull vanished in a wisp of smoke.
Lupin seemed to relax at that, as if he was getting away with something. "Yes, I knew him," Lupin said, with that tragic look that made Draco think, for a second, that Black might be wrong about telling Lupin after all.
"Oppugno!" Harry shouted, and suddenly, improbably enough, Draco had to deal with the one other object in the room, the glass observation cage, attacking him. "Expelliarmus!" Harry shouted, ganging up on him along with the rolling cage, and the red light hit the top of the glass and exploded it over Draco as he ducked.
cheering from Slytherin, namely by Blaise in the front row, beside Luna in her snake hat. But there were far more boos and hisses from that direction. Not far behind Blaise and Luna were Bletchley, Montague, Pucey, and Warrington, hulking forms instantly recognizable, even if they hadn't been yelling out taunts to draw attention to themselves. Much of their sixth and seventh-year classes seemed happy to join them.
"Why, Striker?" Draco whined, the
"Oh, you think once we've got it," Ron caught on swiftly, "Draco with his possessed dragon-fancier wand will be able to
After that, Potter proved surprisingly willing to drop everything, even his fully-piled plate, for Draco's summons, following him around the corner with a smile dawning on his face. Maybe he could guess which couple was in need of help. "Okay, I need the Marauder's Map for Luna," Draco blurted, and he had never seen anyone's face fall apart so quickly or completely.
some inconveniently optimistic voice in his head piped up, the opposite of his internal Severus. This one sounded more like Luna.
"Can we go to the Room of Requirement now?" Harry whispered, green eyes huge behind his glasses. He pushed them up and stared at Draco all the more intently.
"Draco, why didn't you tell us-" Hermione sounded so dismayed, Draco felt a wave of guilt.
"When you put it that way, I guess I'm being stupid. Just... what do they make you hear, Draco?"
was the angel, this young wild creature that seemed to radiate light himself rather than merely be touched by it. The familiar feel and Amortentia scent of Harry had driven every thought from Draco's head other than that angel, save that he had been upset about something, but it didn't matter anymore. "
Murder
She hadn't seemed to like him since the incident in flying lessons. Rather hypocritical, when it had single-handedly delivered her a Seeker. "I had a question, Professor. Not about Transfiguration," he said, with his best air of innocent first-year, "But I didn't know who else to ask about it. See, my ambition for the end of my studies is to become an Unspeakable."
Ron considered, lowering his voice, before making an observation that earned him a whack from Hermione, and a groan of unspeakable mortification from Harry. "I don't know. Do you think Draco knows how often Harry goes off to lock himself in the dorm bathroom for a suspicious length of time at night? Especially on days we've had Potions with you," he added helpfully, and Hermione whacked Ron once more, which he looked to be quite pleased by.
"Sorry," Gilderoy said quickly, "I just want you to believe me-"
. That let Draco drift off complacently, staring at himself. He really had thought he took more after his father's side than his mother's, that he was the spitting image of his father, but if you changed his coloring, he really was a Black. Well, a Black bastard...
"What," Draco breathed, letting the book fall from his hands. He had read the entry twice, and still didn't think he understood. "The talon wand- you don't even think it's a
"The Healers said to try not to dwell on it, Mum," he said anxiously. He seemed as protective of them as he had been despairing before, something in his bearing like he was the parent. Augusta nodded approvingly at the advice.
"Oh, sorry," Harry said quickly, "I didn't think you'd still be..."
"You love it," Draco teased.
, you must know what an Ouroboros is-"
? What about my life these past years has been
"I can't," Draco said numbly. The word, the thought just wouldn't come. He could barely recall the syllables of Sectumsempra.
"Yes," Hermione said intently, conviction shining from her pretty brown eyes. She smiled when she saw Dumbledore reach under the defense's stand and produce Mr. Wilberforth's case.
He would be waiting for quite a while. Draco didn't know what he'd been so scared of. Ollivander had found a solution, like hell. When they even approached the shop, the wand wouldn't let him within a block.
"Luna," Draco said quickly, "The Wrackspurts, the Wrackspurts have gone to his brain-"
"I'm trying to explain to Harry," Hermione sighed, "Why Ron doesn't believe that Harry didn't enter himself in the tournament," and Potter looked over and went stiff at the sight of Draco.
Lupin shook his head, looking more tired but also more pitying. The incongruity between the man Black had spoken of with such reverence and the man before Draco was almost beyond belief.
"LACARNUM INFLAMARI!" A fireball larger than Draco flew out of his wand and crashed into the chain, ripping it from the floor and off its hinges from above, the chain and the manacles crashing to the ash-covered blackened ground where they began to crumble. Draco raised his wand again, only for a distant voice to call, "Enough! Young gentleman, enough! Incendium glacius! Incendium glacius!" Periander had to cast the flame-freezing charm time after time, to very little effect on the gathered fire before them, taking up more than half the room now. Draco himself had little more success, until finally Maledictum had flown forward and beaten her wings over it. Where their beating had seemed to produce heat before, to dry the water, now it was merely air that beat out the flames.
Black's reflection looked appropriately remorseful. "I couldn't help it, Draco, after I saw him fall, and his broom blow away into the Whomping Willow. I saw the chance to do something for him, and to use the Black fortune for good for once. I didn't think to tell you before. I'm sorry. But if we can clear my name, I can tell everyone I got it and that it's safe..."
When Draco opened his eyes, Potter was watching him. "I wish I was allowed to go in your common room. It's mad just sitting out here when we could be near a fire."
Draco had dissolved into messy sobs. He didn't think she was right, but if she wasn't, why was he crying like this? "I'm not," he said, and she hugged him tightly enough that it was easy to pull her down to cuddle, burying his face in her thick hair. "I'm sorry, Hermione, I'm sorry..."
Unexpectedly, rather than looking pleased to have settled this mutual misunderstanding, Granger's face crumpled. "What do you mean,
"It happened!" Luna persisted. "Tell them, Draco!"
Explaining that he'd threatened essentially to burn off Umbridge's hand wasn't great, but it was better than Harry thinking he'd performed ungodly favors for Theo to weasel his way out. "You don't have any trust in me at all, do you?"
for-"
. "Here it is, the book we used for the Naufragiam. I don't know what Luna's told you." Draco rifled through the pages, sitting beside Severus again, and opened it to the page. He handed it to Severus, who just looked at the word Naufragiam, and put a marker in the page and put it aside. "It was me and Luna, we made it in fourth year for Harry."
But what had felt like the draw to some incomplete, selfish form of salvation proved instead the transformation of the world, from imagined nightmares to the completed article. The woman he stood above had been sleeping, but his voice calling for Harry Potter awakened her.
You wore the rose. My favor." Harry squeezed Draco's hand with a show of surging affection that almost put... questions in Draco's mind, but there was nothing to question. He wanted to be near Harry, and that was what he was doing. Getting Harry as close as he needed...
"He told me about you!" Draco called. "About what happened! Fifty years ago! With the Chamber of Secrets!"
That was the trouble with a person being a weapon. Any weapon could turn in the hand.
come in handy for Quidditch. Draco had already noticed a greater difficulty keeping it out of his face at practices this year, especially at the chin length he intended to keep it, rather than properly long hair that could be kept in a real braid or ponytail. Strands had been escaping no matter what he did, which would have incensed him if the ever-palpable presence of Dementors in the air hadn't made it hard to care. But this looked like it would do the trick.
Neville agreed, though when Draco advised that he do it publicly, Neville almost looked like he would prefer to climb into the Great Lake himself and inquire after the Grindylows' diet.
Draco's hand ran reflexively over the claw-shaped wand in his pocket. "Moony was Lupin. And the others?"
but gibberish the mirror had lit up quite brightly between those triangles. That gibberish was far more attractive than his post-Azkaban reflection.
There was indeed a small pebble in Harry's left and not his right hand. "Oh," Harry said, flushing, and it did not seem these Occlumency exercises were destined to go very well. Draco had learned to lie to Aunt Bella seamlessly at that, after only a handful of sessions. But he and Harry been doing the lying game for far more sessions, and Harry was still transparent. "Was that just a lucky guess? I didn't feel like you got very deep in my mind that time, and I did try and empty it..."
Draco's usual path out of Transfiguration went to the library, but he couldn't gather himself enough to choose between library or dungeons. For some reason, his steps took him to the charms classroom. It was only upon arrival, watching a stream of red and gold scarves pour out from a class that ended after his, that he realized it was because Gryffindor had Charms in the same period.
"What d'you reckon?" Ron asked the cat. "Definitely an owl?"
? That I'm just worried about being teased or an outcast? Newsflash, Potter, no one's going to mess with me, because they think I can send a troll after them, and as for being an outcast, I don't have any friends anyway! Do you think I care what any of you
Once her screaming and the smell of burning ceased- it seemed to be far, far more severe than it had ever been for Sirius, despite Draco's lazy casting, likely because of the target- her beady eyes were the helpless eyes of an animal with its foot not only caught in a trap, but mangled by it.
"Sirius said to me," Draco sighed, "That what ifs are no good. That we have to just face the future. Because the future..."
family-"
So when you said that- you
"What on Earth could be the matter?" McGonagall sniffed, before looking mollified by the presence of three of her Gryffindors. "Mr. Potter, what is the meaning of this?"
The feast was pretty much over then, with the other Slytherins generally agreeing that Draco was four for four in ruining Halloween, since it was Draco's friend Potter to have caused the trouble this time. Draco didn't bother to disabuse them, just went over to Gryffindor, ignoring house boundaries for once and sitting beside a distressed Hermione, putting an arm around her.
"What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?"
"There you are, son!" Mr. Granger enfolded him in a bear hug. "Look how you've grown!" He had a whole bag of presents. "So which of these townhouses is yours?"
"Okay," Luna said. "Expelliarmus!" Draco's wand flew neatly towards her, and she stopped it in the air rather than touch it. As Draco had suspected, she was already beyond the magical level of this club, at least at the start. Draco was as well, and the hardest thing for either of them was just making sure Luna remembered not to touch Draco's wand.
- Draco, it's Orpheus and Eurydice, I'm surprised you don't know. You like other Greek mythology, don't you?" She held up her bracelet, indicating the Medusa head. This myth did sound vaguely familiar, though Draco couldn't place it.
you are, to deal personally with
"Yeah, I've been thinking about them, too," said Ron. "Harry, you've got to come and stay with us. I'll fix it up with Mum and Dad, then I'll call you. I know how to use a fellytone now-"
"I'll keep making you the Wolfsbane," Draco promised bravely, though of course he had no idea where he would supposedly be doing that, if alive to do it at all. "So that should help..."
Her lower lip started to quiver again. "It means you've had a head start on me in studying magic and magical history," she said loftily, "But I can assure you I've already learned-"
"I'm sorry," Draco said, and closed the door behind them, feeling only slightly less anxious than last year, when he had hallucinated being chased down the corridor of the train by Fiendfyre. "I'm sorry, okay? My father was out of line, I know that. I'm sorry I didn't step in." He looked at Potter as he said that, since Potter had seemed the one to most expect Gryffindor heroics out of him. Potter had been staying at the Burrow this last stretch of summer, and him and Ron would have had ample time to work themselves up into a lather about Draco if they wanted.
"What? Hey! What's that supposed to mean?" Draco yelped indignantly, but she and Ron and Luna just laughed at Draco all the way back home.
Their friends began showing up, first Ron and Luna and Neville, exclaiming how much bigger Draco had conjured this room than the one for their duel. Then the guest of honor himself appeared, and then it was Gryffindors incoming, and other houses- perfect attendance, after Draco made a stack of his Polaroids and put each in another stack once their owner arrived. Enough of them oohed and ahhed over the room that it became too much trouble to try and explain to each one, no, he hadn't personally created this room, just showed it to the others. If it made everyone feel better to think Draco that powerful, let them.
Eventually, they had to detach, though Draco's mind had gone to ungodly places. It only left them when their circuit of the room had them stumbling upon the man of the hour, the purported second vampire. With Scrimgeour's ungracefully graying hair, black robes, scars, limp, and the dour look about him, it would be hard to imagine a vampire would
Remus came the next morning, carrying breakfast instead of Kreacher. He'd brought his own, and set Draco's tray on his lap in bed before pouring them both some jasmine-scented Earl Grey. Draco hadn't had the energy to feel upset yet, but nothing was more guilt-inducing than Remus's calm non-judgmental exterior. "I'm sorry," was forced out of him before even finishing his almond croissant. "I shouldn't have gone behind your back- shouldn't have involved Harry-"
"Yeah, it was wonderful, Draco," he lied rather poorly. "Just what I wanted."
"I know you'd all rather think it was me," Draco sighed, sagging back against the stands with a bleak look out at the February sunlight. "But I don't know
think it made me stronger?" she asked, a ruefulness in her pale eyes that made her look more rare and unusual than ever, as separate a changeling in the riotous waking world as he was. He put an arm around her while keeping her hand in his, and tugged on her long pale green hair.
you let me get away with things?" He tugged Harry's Gryffindor tie out of place, winding it around his hand. "You're not even mad at me, admit it. You just wanted an excuse for us to be alone. And now we are. What are you going to do about it?" He pulled off Harry's glasses and put them aside on the mantelpiece, as if Harry needed him to be any more obvious. "It's not been two weeks. It's been exactly twelve days. I counted."
a visitor there, right before the turn of the century. 'Grandfather said he would never forget him. Blond and tall and terrifying, without the ability to hear the word no.' It's not clear why the grandfather did it, whether it was fear or bribery or trickery, but he took the foreign wizard to the site of the massacre, and the wizard unearthed the corpse of Astaroth and took what little remained of the rotted heart. 'He said he would take it to the wandmaker Gregorovitch in Germany, and inquired of how to preserve it for the journey. Grandfather advised him, he obeyed, and before he departed, he cast a terrible spell to destroy the rest of the corpse. That was the last he ever saw of the man more fearsome than Astaroth.'"
"Why?" Dantanian turned to eye Dorian with more complete contempt than almost anyone could have deserved. "Why would you
"Malfoy." Dantanian pulled from between Dorian's fingers. Their hands had to brush, untangling it carefully finger by finger. They both stared where their hands touched, before Dantanian pulled his away. "I'm not interested. Look elsewhere, to your many, many,
"I was glad to get a letter!" Potter protested. "And I- I
"I just thought about you and Hermione," Harry said earnestly, "And how if I died, I'd never see the two of you again."
"Professor Snape showed up," Hermione said, with apology in her voice. "He thought Sirius was guilty. He wanted to catch him and protect us. Pettigrew turned back to a rat and escaped."
"Right," Draco drawled. "But aren't I too
"It's a dump," Luna said brightly, and Neville changed his tone.
going to have a Very Harry Christmas. That was what he was afraid of.
"Harry, are you coming?" called Luna.
Draco had no intention of joining up to the Potter cult. But observing the sign-up session could hardly hurt. Apart from one or two security procedures Draco had insisted upon for the occasion, he had resolved to keep himself a silent observer to the side, as if he was still in the blue loop looking into Hermione's Pensieve or something, and enjoy witnessing a slice of history in the making. And possibly see if he could weasel some more satisfying beverages out of Dumbledore's goat-fancying brother than Butterbeer.
Dantanian rolled his eyes, another startlingly young expression on that world-worn face. "Of course. That's what you're here to show off and gloat about? Why are you talking to me anyway?"
"You're so," Draco moaned, laughing, "So
"None, sir," Draco said, keeping his gray eyes wide and pure and childish. Severus began to laugh, a rare deep sound that always made Draco's heart feel warm.
Ginny laughed louder, kicking out her foot at him. "You forgot Neville, you arsehole."
"What?" Severus barked, impatient at any unnecessary delay, and Draco couldn't tell him.
when he was angry.
"I'm sorry," Draco said again. He did not know if he had ever done this much apologizing and meaning it in all his years in the blue loop. Nor did it seem to be much help.
"After the lesson," Severus snapped, and if they hadn't been in a lesson, Draco gave it even odds that Severus would have already cursed Karkaroff.
"Oh, hell," Draco hissed, and looked reflexively towards the toilet stall where they kept their cauldron hidden. But Krum didn't catch his stare. He only had eyes for Hermione. "Viktor, this isn't what it looks like..."
about me," Draco agreed, smiling as if it was a compliment. "But when they call me a dark wizard, what they really mean is that I'm powerful. It's a common weakness in perception, to mistake power for evil. Common to those who are jealous because they have no power of their own. 'I am envy. I can't read, so I want all the books in the world burned.'"
, Draco. Not at a remove from yourself, watching from the outside. Not from behind a wall. And in order to produce a Patronus, which is an expression of your truest self, you need to be able to conceptualize a vision in your head, of a world where the beautiful, happy things you imagine belong to you, rather than being stolen or conned from the world." He looked down at Draco's palm, and Draco could tell they were both remembering the brand of THIEF that had been written across it for half a year, before Remus had removed it from him.
The Lovegoods weren't exactly made of money. Luna had been happy to repurpose her robes from the Heart of Winter gala with tailoring charms. Draco tried to forget they had originally been Mother's. She was dazzling in layers of glistening, filmy white tulle, hair in a braided with a snowdrop flower crown Draco had ordered. Neville had nearly fallen down the stairs at seeing her.
Draco was proud of her habit of always saying Voldemort's name, like Sirius and Remus did. If he wasn't quite at that point, it was an aesthete's disdain, for a name from an imperfect anagram.
, it's so funny that I'm so
"And there was an argument... and I pulled out my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother's best friend- and Albus was trying to stop him, and then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't stand it- and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't know which of us did it, it could have been any of us- and she was dead. Gone. Gone forever."
Potter turned and walked away, and Draco stroked his wand twice. "Great Hall," the wand told him in the eerie low female voice it used, which he told himself had nothing in common with Aunt Bella's. He looked up and there was Granger, standing not 15 meters away talking to Ron and Potter. He heard her telling Ron she'd accompany him to the game, of course she would, but Draco wouldn't have needed her to tell him that.
," Draco insisted, only for Luna to turn her gleaming eyes on him more squarely. She looked him over thoughtfully as if evaluating the worth of the product on offer.
"Harry is going to be so bitter he didn't get to see this," was Ron's first comment the next week as he surveyed Draco's room upon arrival, watching fondly as Ginny went through the line of hanging dragon necklaces and tried to identify each in turn. She seemed to think Astaroth one of the prettiest. The sight of him did always make Draco think of Theo. "You really have gotten yourself a sweet set-up here, mate."
It didn't smell like anyone had been inside Grimmauld for a long time. Draco remembered a smell like this in Azkaban, the rotting sweetness of decaying flesh and souls, attenuated by the constant soft pull of Dementors, feeding through walls at the edges. Creatures as dark as Dementors had a smell that added to the sweetness, the chill to an icy licking languor that had never settled at Hogwarts, but seemed to have accrued over centuries of dark magic present seeping into the stones of Azkaban. There was that smell of old dark magic in these stones, along with the reek of physical erosion.
"And she tells me, Harry, that you wish to become an Auror..."
"Well," Draco said, "It seems my friends are more merciful than I. You ought to thank your nephew with that uneducated tongue, for still
Except it didn't turn out that way. With the mirror dropped on the center of the floor and flames dropped upon it, what rose from the contact almost seemed water- but no, that crystal-blue alpine clarity belonged more precisely to stronger flame, along with a broader haze of distortion above. Another rivulet of yellowish fire down upon the unchanged mirror, and it poured off it in brighter blue- not the heatless, eerie sterility of a blue Protego Diabolica or Patronus, but real fire that seared the floor and could have easily gone out of control without a pyromancer's grip upon it.
Dumbledore's face didn't change. "Mr. Black, I fear I must be the one to disillusion you. The Deathly Hallows are no more than a fable, written to advise children of the fallacy of not accepting the reality of death-"
saw all that... wait, what do you mean, a
"Kreacher," Black repeated. "He was my family's house elf here when I was growing up. He should still be living here, though I haven't seen his ugly mug. Must be, if things like that are disappearing. Never too fond of me, that miserable old rag. Why do you think I haven't used this place more? Can't trust him not to try and get me caught or done in. He was loyal to my mother-"
She was already on the warpath. She'd marched up to the Gryffindor table, banning Harry from Hogsmeade, docking a massive number of points from Gryffindor, and giving another week of detention, which thankfully would end before Ron's birthday. And she put up her decree that anyone in possession of the Quibbler would be expelled, just like last time, but Draco had failed to appreciate before how counter-productive that was. Hermione said they couldn't have had better marketing if they put up a billboard in the Great Hall. That launched him into a minor panic over his Muggle Studies OWL prospects, from not knowing what a billboard was. But she proved to be right, as no less than fifteen students sidled up to their library table just that afternoon, asking if there were issues of the Quibbler they could borrow.
"Well," Draco said with satisfaction, "That should be them sorted. And it wasn't an empty threat. You won't dump me if I leave your best mate mouthless, will you, Harry?"
"Once the Slytherins arrive," Hermione sighed, and stuck her head over to where Ginny and Luna were setting up extra balloons in the corners of the cleared trophy room. "Fourth-years! We're done all the scary OWL talk! You can come back over now!"
"You don't need to go all professor on them," Sirius complained, but took Harry's shoulder and marched him down the stairs all the same. And then the three adults, who had apparently worked out their grievances enough that none of them were
Draco raised a hand as if in class, and with a frustrated sigh, Severus called on him. "Should I start Vanishing them, sir?"
"You loved her," Draco observed carefully, "Even with what she was. Her limits. You loved her anyway."
mind.
Draco only saw Ron's face contort in terror before he was swept up into the air and set hanging there. He looked over, and the same had happened to Ron and Potter, and he told himself everything was still fine, he still had his wand, until he began to realize how
"Whose house is this?" Hermione whispered, shivering as a brisk night breeze whipped through and blew her thick hair in her face. The dog had stopped across the street from them, a great silent beast. Maybe it thought it could get some kind of treat, although it was rather shy in asking for it. Instead, it just settled there to watch them, like some kind of sentinel.
"We're coming!" Harry yelled back, and they sprinted with renewed energy.
"Yes," Gilderoy said with a strange look, "But it's gotten on fine without me, you see. In a way, it's disappointing. I wasn't- necessary here either."
"Or is it just that there's something wrong with
"Just the man," Severus said. "The very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last."
He must have fallen asleep, because he had to be shaken awake by Severus, asking him if he had packed. By then, Karkaroff was nowhere in sight. On the way down the stairs after he got dressed, Severus explained that Father had taken Karkaroff away, but had still agreed upon Mother's insistence to let Draco return to Hogwarts that night.
Harry made a muffled sound. Draco could see him staring at the Dark Lord returned, the man who had killed Harry's parents, who had put that scar on his forehead, the scar Draco had affectionately poked so many times. It had to be burning again. But he wasn't cringing, wasn't crying. Behind his gag, he didn't look afraid, just angry. Draco had never seen anything so brave.
No, Harry would never know, nor Severus, nor- Merlin, nor would Hermione. Or at least Draco wouldn't be there to see them learn it.
It was Pansy's voice, he knew it before even turning to see the shivering figure she made in her thin, floaty light blue designer robes. They were the same she had worn in third year the first time, when she'd attended as his date, as she had every year until the galas at the Manor stopped, and the hanging of bodies began. She was pretty despite the pug shape of her nose, with white roses in her hair, already starting to grow into her distinctive Parkinson features. Though in truth she had never been, nor ever would be, as pretty as Luna. He might have understood her jealousy, if he had been his old self once upon a time. And if she hadn't come with
me- fear me, despise me,
Gilderoy tried weakly to smile. "I am quite a bother, aren't I? I know myself a burden, but I am trying- you don't know how I'm trying, Severus-"
It was déjà vu up to a certain point, having been coaxed here by Hermione once before, to show them all her book which told about Nicholas Flamel. And he had to wait in the Gryffindor common room, despite his attempts to follow her past it, because as she crossly told him, just because everyone in school knew he was gay, still didn't mean a boy should be in the girls' dormitory.
He ignored his inner Severus, telling himself his back wasn't fully healed yet, but felt an anxiety grow in his own stomach as potent in its own way as Neville Longbottom's palpable terror.
to make it. You're too talented not to. The only one who could ever stop you is you, Millie."
"I did it, so..." Draco began, and then Harry made a concerned sound and walked over.
Frederick looked at Elizabeth for a moment pleadingly, but she shook her head hard. "No, Daniel, you shouldn't keep dwelling on her like this. It's not healthy. And you're British now, and you're
"I love
Lucius Malfoy's son Draco, sixteen, was adopted this summer alongside Mr. Potter, by the notorious ex-fugitive Sirius Black. Mr. Draco Lupin Black was disowned by the Malfoy family after his role in the Battle of the Ministry, in which he used an unknown cutting curse to end the life of Mr. Cantankerous Nott. A former Ministry employee, Mr. Nott was the seventy-two-year-old father of a classmate.
"What would it have showed him?"
Draco conjured a dummy and did it to it a couple times to show Harry. Then he Vanished the dummy, remaining sitting up throughout on his pile of soft green pillows. He made sure his wrists were exposed, sleeves still up, and turned them forwards to show Harry. "If you do it right, I should be pushed onto my back, and my arms should be pinned above my head. Like this," Draco said, leaning back, and stretched his arms high above his head, pushing his wrists together.
seemed to be his favorite. Just as then, Draco's wrists were thrown over his head and pinned by invisible hands.
"Did you not hear me cast a muffling charm?" Draco flopped back down against the pillow.
," Draco jibed, and Ron rolled his eyes but grinned at him. "You should see it, Potter. This lot's family are so covered in spots, it's like they've declared war on a bubotuber farm."
"Theo?" Severus called in shock, over the murmurs and cries of his fellow Death Eaters. That precluded any doubt Draco might have had as to lies on his godfather's part. The most unbelievable thing of all, in this scene Severus had been Apparated into in media res, seemed to be the presence of one of his Slytherins in the midst of the combatants. Severus's eyes went with baffled incomprehension, for everyone to see, to Theo's exposed arm, the sleeve still rolled up showing off the Dark Mark.
"There is, actually," Luna said brightly, "Quite a lot. Please don't curse him, he means well."
"Urgh, no, Harry won't want one of those, they're for vampires, I expect," Hermione was saying, and Ron offered a jar of Cockroach Clusters, while Draco offered a whiff of Fisheye Flippers.
Grindelwald gave a politely appreciative smile at the implicit promise, though he did not speak so lightly of this. "None of the results. From start to end. I was arrogant and short-sighted, and I lost everything."
"Did you see me kick Dean?" Luna was asking Neville excitedly in the background, while Neville seemed to lack the nerve to explain to Luna that she shouldn't exactly be proud of kicking shins instead of the football. Seamus had taken some of the ice from Neville's cup and made an ice pack for Dean, rolling down Dean's sock and holding it to his calf, but Dean hardly seemed to feel it, gloating there in his dirt and grass-covered West Ham shirt to his exhausted friend.
Hi, to answer a question, as to the whereabouts of Imoogi, she currently resides with Hagrid in his hut. Draco is free to visit her whenever he likes ^^
"Who are we spying on?" she asked brightly, and clasped both of her own hands over her mouth when she saw it was Krum and Hermione, and heard what Hermione said.
The Healer led them across the ward, which Draco tried to pretend he was seeing for the first time. He nodded politely at the patients. None of them seemed coherent enough to say anything to give Draco away. Including Neville's parents.
Did this girl ever shut up? "You're being rude," he whispered, "And you've only got half your inches done for Potions. What is going on with you, Granger?"
But he could hardly even hear Weasley then over the blood rushing to his head, the sudden pounding in his ears. "What do you mean, an enchanted mirror?"
? Before that, we have yet to have any useful update on the progression of the healing project. Very well, if you are incapable of articulating, I will inspect for myself."

And the dwarf delivered that last line with a macabre little bow, tossing off his wings and grumbling as he trudged off muttering about not getting paid enough for this tripe.
"Cool," Luna said happily.
"Harry..." Draco wondered if Harry would welcome or flinch away from a kiss right now. "Harry, you know... you know my childhood wasn't exactly..."
"Oh, I'm sorry- I'm Neville- I'm looking for Harry Potter- do you know what's happening-"
"Come, Draco," said Severus, dragging him away.
to you-"
"I'll have you know," Lockhart was saying loftily, "That whatever its
"She ought to know this stuff, you know," Draco whispered to Ron at breakfast. "She's Luna's age, and Luna's known all about it for ages. Boys are going to be after Ginny soon if they aren't already, she's a pretty girl- hey! Don't whack me!"
"Long meeting with Voldemort?" Sirius asked sharply at the sight, and Remus sighed.
Harry extended a hand stiffly for him to shake. "Goodbye, Draco," he said, with heartbreaking formality.
"If there is no reason for me to search," Severus said silkily, "Then why do you wish me not to search it?"
"You were not supposed to be there," Severus said, finally looking him in the eye with grim resolution, "Or I would not have tipped them off. You were never supposed to be in harm's way-"
Luna seemed most interested, as he had feared she would be, at the reports he'd managed to secure of a sexual relationship of some sort between Riddle and Abraxas. Abraxas had denied it thoroughly at first, but eventually the temptation of nostalgia had won out. With Draco's promise of secrecy, he'd waxed poetic about the many attractions of young Tom Riddle, both as a wizard and a man, until Draco was hard-pressed to get him to stop. It was clear by the end how much of Abraxas's initial loyalty to the Knights of Walpurgis was from a personal hold of Riddle's over Abraxas, as opposed to mere ideology or political ambition.
Phineas walked back, with a condescending affection in his gaze that was chillingly new. "Dante," he said indulgently, taking his hand. "No need to look so surprised. It is just as I promised, is it not?"
"I don't know," Harry said slowly. "I would define blood magic as just

say you'll partner with me today," Luna said, linking her arm with his and dragging him over to the board at the back where newspaper clippings had been accumulating. They had to avoid the sprigs of white-berried mistletoe that Dobby had hung all about, but they managed, with Luna still glued onto his arm the whole time. There went leaving before the meeting started.
"Gilderoy," Draco said with his best ingratiating smile, "Do you remember when you told me you would keep my secrets? Whatever they were? That your loyalties were unequivocally to

fire-based spell without her supervision. Luna was the one who had to be dragged out by Hermione, once Draco asked Neville to stay behind after practice formally ended.
"You are seventeen now. Officially come of age. Maybe that can mean something, magically. My God, this place..."
"I don't think it's, er, anything like that, mate," Ron said uncomfortably. "The whole, um, situation you've got there, with..." He seemed to be having the same difficulty saying the name as he would have with Voldemort.
The surprise had worked. When Dobby Apparated in, looking at the turquoise watch on his wrist, he looked around confused for a moment, then cried out in shrill surprise when he saw the HAPPY BIRTHDAY DOBBY banner in red and gold overhead, and the cake that said the same. Belatedly, the five of them jumped up and shouted, "SURPRISE!" just like on the Muggle television.
Draco found out the next morning that the trio had stayed up past two in the morning, summoning everything to them in the common room that wasn't bolted down. "He's still totally out of it," Hermione said with a sigh, and when she demanded Draco come sit with them when they watched the Task, Draco didn't protest, just trying to tell her that Potter would be fine.
"What requires explanation, Potter," Draco sighed, "Is why someone not licking your boots for once is sufficient proof that they're a dark wizard at large, bent on the downfall of civilization-"
"We came on the Knight Bus," Hermione told them, as Sirius wandered by singing God Rest Ye, Merry Remuses so loudly, Remus wasted yet more popcorn tossing it at Sirius's head.
to give them the right rings.
Draco opened his eyes wider, regarding Potter with the baleful stare that deserved. "Potter, I want as little to do with my father, let alone with any Death Eater or dark wizard or
what belongs to you."
"Lord Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time... You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure... do it, or feel my wrath yourself!"
"Sounds like wings to me."
with you?"
"Why won't you teach me?" Draco interrupted, not caring how rude he was being, and a hair's breadth already from taking the step he'd told himself was only a last resort. "Because I'm not a Gryffindor, or not as important as Saint Potter?"
say it at Easter. They were talking about her cousin, Sirius Black, and Father said that he wasn't the one to be the Potters' Secret Keeper and turn them in to the Dark Lord, it was Pettigrew, and that Pettigrew had framed Black of his murder and fled in hiding, probably in his Animagus form as a rat- Mother had already known the first part, but she didn't know Father still thinks Pettigrew is
The ripple was felt instead in the wider berth granted him, including by the other Slytherin first-years, though Draco couldn't tell how much was fear and how much a practical unwillingness to associate with a potentially disgraced pureblood. Very few had the nerve to openly accuse him, and so a reputation already growing from unsociability, along with an uncanny level of knowledge in classes for a first-year, was polished by a darker tinge. It turned to something that made many of the lower years, and some of the upper ones, act like he was some dark creature stalking the corridors for prey.
"Well, that was anticlimactic. Open the book for me to copy, to make sure I get the Wheel of Hecate exactly right. That is one place Dantanian had me beat." After a second, to be clear, Draco added, "Painting like a Muggle, you know?"
do that again?" He gestured vaguely in the direction of the destruction they'd wrought, as best as he could with both wrists bound. "I don't think Potter would be too pleased. I mean, granted, right now he thinks you're a meandering schizoid, but it's not like he has any other family, is it? Those purple-faced Muggles don't count. Even a meandering schizoid godfather is better than no godfather at all-"
Potter was off in the champion's tent, probably dying of nerves the same as Draco, and so none of them got to see him until after the Task had started, and all three champions went before him. Diggory was first with his Swedish Short-Snout, and Draco stared balefully down at him, telling himself he wasn't rooting for the dragon here. If Hermione knew what he was thinking, she'd nag him endlessly about it. Diggory succeeded, but at least his marks weren't splendid. Draco remembered Potter and Krum being tied for first after this task over. He'd been senselessly annoyed by that in the blue loop, given that in Potter vs. dragon the first time, he'd been whole-heartedly rooting for the dragon.
"You two are so cute," Hermione laughed as she and Ron passed, "Such a romantic pair," and oh, she was asking for it.
"I can fix your nose, young man," Remus said, and Theo nodded respectfully. Draco remembered that Remus had been a very respected Defense professor for a year, as Remus stepped forward and performed Episkey for Theo's nose, and then for Harry's busted lip. "Mr. Nott, what could possibly justify using that kind of language?"
, and the influx of them was increasing. When there began to be screams from the lower levels of the castle at night- levels that Lockhart had been advised never to enter- well, Lockhart had began to make noises about needing to move along elsewhere. Much as he had enjoyed his time with the dashing and mysterious Senyor Seguinus.
This time, though, Potter wasn't trying to patch things up with Finch-Fletchley. The Hufflepuff had fled too quickly from the fearsome Malfoy's snake to make it look like Potter was setting it on him, and so Potter wasn't in the vicinity when it happened. Draco might not be stopping the attacks on Muggleborns, which could lead to Hermione's death at any moment. But at least this time around, he was bettering Potter's
, Draco thought, and felt a wave of need so unmistakable it shook him. Harry's arms were steady around him, not something Draco could panic within even if he wanted to. Harry's chest was against Draco's, his fuzzy Weasley jumper doing little to hide the lean athletic feel of his body. And his lips were hot against Draco's cold throat, rubbing at his hair affectionately and then at the skin beneath, grazing over the edge of Draco's chin before inhaling the scent of Draco's hair again-
"This is the vial-"
"Mr. Potter," Scrimgeour said, facade of paternal helpfulness falling. "This spite is extraordinary. Try and control your temper-"
Draco was happy to seize that gorgeous face and kiss it. Even in a sea of the best and brightest of the wizarding world.
"But," Draco went on charitably, "I will take responsibility for visiting Grimmauld Place again, where I happened to make the acquaintance of my Uncle Sirius, who may be less
"The rightful heir, who would kindly thank the Prisoner of Nurmengard to keep from dragging his big feet in the ritual site," Draco appended.
Theo's face twisted in understanding. He turned his head away and began to walk again. "Show me your left wrist!" Draco demanded, pursuing him, the kind of single-minded fury in him that had the talon wand purring hot in his pocket. "Show me
"No, a body is a body," Grindelwald coughed impatiently. "Do with it as you wish- bury it- throw it in the lake- feed it to dogs for all I care, I will be dead, what is it to me? What you must do is- forgive me for my lies to you. I wanted to live. And I must ask- ask much. And Albus. And
He'd used it to find her in the Malfoy cellars, after one of his fellow Slytherins had blinded him. But that was not the memory from the cellars he had before him. He knew where he had seen that symbol: on the Mirror of Erised, copied in his notebook so he would never forget. And not just
Dantanian smirked. "Do you want to tell
"Oh, that's a shame," Draco said brightly, "Since that's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. It'll just be a bit more time spent as an intermediary on my behalf. You have the ear of Dumbledore, whatever price you pay for it-"
"Oh," Mrs. Weasley said, hand over her mouth, relieved by the sight of her children safe and sleeping. "Oh, there they are. All four of them. Oh, and they're sleeping, the dears. Bless them. Oh, bless them." She grabbed onto the wall for balance, and Draco wished he knew her well enough to offer some form of reassurance.
Luna poked her head up from her arm cocoon. "Oh no, they don't mean
Draco
Potter twisted his head to look at Draco's hair, looking at the S in the back, and Draco stopped breathing. "You- you're wearing the new clasp I gave you, though," he whispered plaintively, and the world narrowed to the sight of those lips-
"No, Hermione, you look so, so pretty," Luna said earnestly, and at her assistance, she and Hermione began to work on fixing each other's hair and make-up. Draco was of no help in that department, so he set about browsing through Grindelwald's manifestos until he was called to have his hair done in turn. He clasped his hand to his face and pronounced himself astonished by the fairytale transformation of his cousin and sister, even more drastic in a newly elegant Hermione in ethereal, glittering periwinkle-colored dress robes. Her hair was pulled back in a knot, while Luna's was braided into a crown around her head, spell-curled ringlets escaping around her face. "See, isn't Hermione pretty?" Luna beamed, and Draco nodded with all the enthusiasm in him.
"No," Draco laughed unsteadily, "No, I don't, I know I'm a hypocrite, but Luna- if you want me to, I'll try, if you say you will. He could have come to life as a person and done
There was no doubt what Dantanian remembered.
"You can't just solve all of our problems with that-"
Sixth year.
"You were right, I did it, I did it, wasn't I marvelous," Ron babbled up at Draco, and Draco smirked over at Harry.
What could be more like winning than having Harry standing here with him, face to face, hand in his coaxing out the last bit of sleepy fuzziness and making it perfectly alive again? Those green eyes full of delicious repentance... those pretty pink lips gone white with tension, only to loosen as a slight pout crept in... the curl of his dark hair which was getting longer again, thick around his face, and this close there was that Amortentia smell...
She let out a short, surprised laugh, which she seemed to try and take any curt irony from. "No, my little prince," she said, and knelt down there for that moment on their stair step, in between the many people streaming up and down past them. "We live in the Muggle world because we are exiles."
But now he had set his son another task. "He's been practicing his flying all the time for Quidditch, you know. I'm sure you've been as well," Nott said, with a warmth that seemed to confirm Severus's reading of the Death Eaters, wanting to pull Draco back into the fold. Punishment might come later, when he was too firmly ensnared again to run from it.

," Lovegood said sadly. "But it had such lovely
Draco smiled down at the paper and pocketed it, only to hear a small uproar coming from the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw tables, as from the marble stairs descended two slight, long-haired figures, one taller and sleeker, and one with a bushy brown halo of hair-
Draco wilted under that frank stare. "Like, nowhere. Just, um, at Hogwarts. The Divination Tower and Gryffindor Tower...
Still in the murk and swimming lake-light of the dungeons, Dorian exited from Severus's old office- no, the current Potions professor's office, the disquietingly-named Abernathy Nott per the old-fashioned nameplate on the door. Dorian was sulking mightily as he stalked out, though a brief glimpse of a pale and rather sweaty Professor Nott showed that the rebuke had not been as one-sided as one might suppose. Then Dorian caught sight of someone waiting for him, right around the corner towards the stairs, but still in a length of dungeon labyrinth that placed him almost entirely in stone and shadow.
have left the wine cellars open- but it wasn't like Kreacher was deviating from his usual personality. He just had liquid courage in those ancient veins, his unpleasant visage contorted in the purest of hatreds.
"I don't know," Luna called. "I know the students at least are all supposed to get out... Draco, there's so many of them, I went looking for you and I nearly ran into some..."
He slipped into a carriage with the Slytherin second-year boys, and only when the carriage had lifted off did he realize the air of petrification that had taken over the carriage upon his arrival. Theo in particular looked queasy, while Blaise had the same wariness as when he'd fled the compartment. Vince and Greg looked scared, in their less expressive way, of being tainted with guilt by association. Draco was filled with exasperation at himself, for finding no better way to clear himself a carriage than going right back to menacing his housemates. That item of
Dantanian's lip twitched, misery in his eyes complete. Then his gaze lowered, lashes lowering with it, turning his stare half-lidded and heavy. "You can do it, Black. I won't stop you. If you'll just promise, that tomorrow, when the term is over, you'll take me to Citadelle Xaphan."
"It's not that," Gilderoy groaned. "Oh, alright, you've dragged it out of me! He's helping me with my scars!" Gilderoy wilted at Draco's skeptical look. "He- he came to the citadel, a few days after Christmas, and offered his Potions expertise to assist me."
"No time!" Harry called. "We run for the lift we came in. NOW!"
Draco grabbed his shoulder hard. "Look at me.
"Yeah, I know," Harry said affectionately, stroking his hair some more. "Remus said you've had to sleep a lot since you got back, exhaustion and all... I'm sorry, baby..."
"It's more a form of psychological rather than physical torment," Draco said brightly, and Hermione looked askance at him and Luna both.
reason to let girls on the team."
," Harry said, and smiled at Draco's quizzical look. "I just remember Hagrid telling me about this place. This is where he..." Harry lowered his voice so Luna and Neville couldn't hear, and whispered with a fond light in his eye, "Won Norbert, you know..."
Frederick looked annoyed, but Elizabeth touched his elbow and forced her own smile. "Neither could your father, sweetheart."
"Hold your tongue, Karkaroff," Severus hissed, and this seemed to spur Karkaroff on like nothing else.
"And who was this man?"
the famous welcoming inscription over Nurmengard, he scarcely seemed able to add that into his calculations.  So hazardous already was the current inconceivable arrangement of players and dangers on the board.
"I don't- I'm sorry, I didn't..."
"All night," Potter said guilelessly, and now he
"We have a deal," Draco warned him, stepping in the way of the fireplace to make it explicit before he made the trip. "Even if this doesn't work, you
"Oh," Dorian gasped, hands to his mouth, covering very pretty flushed lips. He had somehow contrived to become lovelier since the start of fifth year, which seemed impossible. "I'm so sorry. I didn't know they'd passed-"
"Sweetheart," Mother said, pushing her hair out her eyes with her branded palm, "Your aunt couldn't have done those things. She wanted to. But she can't penetrate the House Black wards anymore, let alone bring them down. Nor will the castle respond to her. You blasted her from the Black tapestry..."
Potter cut off Draco's uninspired attempt at a jibe to explain. "I don't know where I am, we were taking this powder thing through a fireplace-" Sweet Merlin. Already a second-year, and the savior of the wizarding world was still calling Floo powder
. He could see so clearly the version of him that had been brave or stupid or selfish, whatever you wanted to call it, that had taken the kiss as just a beginning, that had made sure he could get the feel and memorize it not just of Harry's lips but his skin, everywhere, all over. His own skin felt throbbing with the need for Harry to touch it.
"Don't ever say that again!" she screamed. "It's not true! Demon child- devil! DEVIL CHILD!"
Draco had worse things to worry about, than lack of understanding of himself. When in doubt, blame it on Dantanian.
"It's a pleasure to meet you. The others will want to-"
Apparently, there was something: move himself at a moment's notice to a better vantage point, so he could see the intruder before they saw him first.
Hermione listened to his rendition of Black's incredible tale with a patience Draco knew Ron and Potter would never have shown, though he could see in her eyes the one question that was the hardest to explain, without being able to admit he had future knowledge:
Dantanian smiled ironically. "I have hated few things, more than I hated going to
"Potter," Draco began, stepping close and lowering his voice so no gossips at nearby tents would go making a mountain out of a molehill. "At lunch- what did you think you were-"
When their lips parted, Alice was not the only one watching. Narcissa Malfoy was standing behind them with a set of dress robes in her arms, waiting to check out. She must have already been inside the shop before they came. She did not have Alice's surprise on her pinched but lovely face. There was no expression at all in her light eyes.
Draco arrived there on the team bus with Viktor, which proved a mistake. For the occasion of a European quarterfinal, the Ministère des Affaires Magiques seemed to have gotten overexcited and gone overboard- as if they didn't have these, like, every two or three years for the Panthers- and closed off the entirety of the Saint-Germain-en-Laye area to Muggles, with visual as well as physical blocking and masking, and many officials manning borders with great aplomb. That was, except for during the arrival of the team bus of the Murmeltiere, which received the traditional bus welcome from the Parisian ultras, the so-called
Griphook shot them a suspicious stare, before pressing his hand to the vault to open it. "Did you know," Draco said brightly by way of distraction, "Harry once fought a dragon? A Hungarian Horntail, not an Ukrainian Ironbelly like this one. It was in the-"
shows of weakness. "He's- he's not someone you can easily throw away, okay? But I'll have to choose, me or him...
"Me too," said Ron, and Draco nodded.
Quidditch training ramped up in intensity as they approached the Ravenclaw-Slytherin match, coming up on the 20th. Flint had them meeting three times a week, which combined with Draco stubbornly sticking to his weekend night flights had his body sore and exhausted half the time. He would have been stealing all kinds of potions to assist him, had Severus's storerooms still been open to him. As it was, he saved the second Draught of Peace he had received at Christmas, same as the other Slytherin boys, and hoped he wouldn't need to use it against Ravenclaw.
"The Pic de L'Infern," Draco answered automatically, remembering the article. "It's in the Pyrenees. The Spanish Pyrenees," he added, at the bound and tired Karkaroff's face of growing despair. He seemed unwilling to ask any of the obvious questions, beginning with,

"To date?" Harry said, still so adorably innocent. "Publicly? To be boyfriends, for real?"
Mr. Weasley hadn't noticed the improvement, in his rush to get Draco out of the way of any other wandering Death Eaters. But Harry did.
"Hermione," Draco said, stopping her at a landing. "Did you- did she show you the memories?"
Severus looked frustrated to find Gilderoy so well-prepared with words, where perhaps he had hoped to break him down and dissect him for some deeper truth. "But you have the ability to learn a discipline and excel in it. You have shown that not just with memory charms, but with castle-building. Yes, under unimaginable duress, but you must not truly be the
as the world swayed and dipped and lifted around him. He had to only trust now that Ron and Potter were being taken in the same direction.
Draco felt himself blinking rapidly. What had been in that booze? "Why are you calling me master anyway?"
"Of course it wasn't true!" Harry said hotly. "That last part? About how blokes have, like, youthful indiscretions, and this is probably just that, just an
"Try me," Severus intoned flatly, and began to nibble at one of seven almond croissants.
Hermione thought arranging an actual meeting was a terrible idea, and talked him out of it in minutes.
In the meantime, Luna took her first ever breakup as an excuse to turn to dark magic. Really.
"You know," he heard Ron say to Neville, "Sometimes I wonder why the Slytherins in his year call him Grindelwald these days. And sometimes I, like,
"Oh, he won't be sacked."
happy he's here," he said with blunt honesty, and smiled weakly over at Severus. Severus gave Draco's red Arsenal hoodie an unimpressed look, and then began to shovel lamb into his mouth at a pace of real hunger.
"Hear it?" said Myrtle.
Delacour struggled to compose herself for a moment. Like Severus said, Draco was certainly making friends this year. "Bonsoir, Ronald," she finally said in her most polite manner. "I am very 'onored to be asked, but I 'ave a date already. I am sorry. Best wishes and au revoir."
"Then vat is it?" Krum asked suspiciously.
my nights brewing angel's infusion."
Severus used to be-"
It was harder than Draco would have thought to overpower the raw force of Ron's magic then. Ron was putting everything into it, beads of sweat rolling down his wet face, shards of exploded ice melting all over him, and cast a surprisingly heroic figure, anticipating the boy he would be, fighting alongside Potter in the second war, in that disheveled young frame.
He sniffed the air, saying, "I smell guilt. There is a stench of guilt upon the air," and some part of Draco's mind, from the security of lack of choice, reflected that if
"Didn't get much out of Dobby. Only that I had to wait- he was
Except he'd heard about Diggory nobly offering to have the match replayed. There was no chance of Draco doing that. Even if he would have so much as considered it, he would never have been able to set foot in Slytherin House after, for the rest of his days at Hogwarts. He wasn't a
"That was dark magic?" Potter gasped.
"I'm sure you have!" Draco started away from Severus. "How much time have you spent looking at me seeing him? Cataloguing similarities, trying to see if I'm myself and not him? I thought
Draco had to execute a complicated roll and swerve to avoid crashing, but it worked. Krum went slamming into the hoop face-first and just barely managed to keep hold of his broom to fly himself dazed to the ground, where he fell on his back looking half-unconscious. The Snitch was obliging enough then to show itself glittering near the ground, and Draco could swoop down in a leisurely fashion and snatch it up. He sauntered over to Krum and held it up over him. "Guess that's 1-1, huh?" The Bulgarian's nose was broken, much as in the cup final, and he looked dazed. "Unless you need to resign, you know, from injury, I'll just count this set as my victory..."
"Option three would be terribly exciting, if that's a point in its favor." Luna clapped her hands together. "Oh, what a feat to achieve!"
"Where did they come from?" Ron yelled, panicked, and Dolohov cackled.
But only days later, opportunity came unexpectedly in the form of Dean Thomas's latest footy magazine arriving, which he begrudgingly came to share with Draco anyway, although in the courtyard instead of the common room after dinner. And when Thomas seemed less interested in taunting him about Arsenal's recent poor run of form- perhaps because West Ham's had been even worse- than grilling him about his invasion of their dorm, Draco blurted, "Alright, Thomas, you want to know what I was really doing there? I was going to try and steal Ron's rat."
It felt so good it brought tears to Draco's eyes, actual fucking tears, his hands going up to Harry's messy dark hair and knotting, pulling Harry's face against his neck so he wouldn't stop moving his teeth against it. "You... Harry, your
And then they were both startled by a loud shout. "I'm hungry, Vince! You want to head down and see if there's any leftovers in the kitchens? Draco's house elf will give us some!"
He would have almost preferred walking in on some passionate tryst, rather than what he found as he busted into the trophy room: Harry and Diggory standing there a few feet apart, the air calm and civil, with Harry saying, "I really appreciate the help you gave me with the egg, so I wanted to tell you what I've figured out about the Second Task since then. See, when the song says what you'll miss the most, we think that means..."
Something in her weary, burdened manner made Draco defensive. "What? I know I was unprepared to deal with all of these machines, but I've made it to your home without breaking the Statute of Secrecy. Nor have I infuriated your parents or disturbed your shrine. I even wore this bizarre thing," he said, tugging at the chest of the sweatshirt, whose striped red-and-white arms were matched there with a strange family crest of arms across the navy blue front, above an incantation of
never
"Her name," Draco said indignantly, cuddling her to his chest, "Is Imoogi, if you must know. And she is a very
"What she means to say," Sirius said bluntly, "Is that it probably worked for you and not Ron because you're loads more powerful. Or dark. That too."
"Really?" Harry yelled, and Draco let out an elegant surge of flames.
It was the first time Draco had ever caught the Snitch against Harry with both of them conscious, though admittedly Remus's lawn chair had provided a confounding variable. But the rush of it, even the rush of winning for his team and giving Sirius a victory, temporarily went up in smoke when he saw the look it had put on Harry's face.
Bellatrix had stolen their lives, Bellatrix had driven them mad,
And Severus did, taking the situation in hand. He seemed to sit and talk with Theo far longer than needed to just fix his eyes, but their conversation was muffled magically, and Draco fell asleep long before Theo left.
It was lucky this was only his back-up plan. He was looking forward to trying this, as if he needed more hobbies to take up his spare time. All he could say was thank Merlin there was no Quidditch this year.
"There is a presence in that wand that I do not yet understand," Periander said grimly. "The ritual should unveil the future crimes of the murderer. You must stop using that wand, Mr. Malfoy. You must not cast a single spell more with it. It will poison you. Not like it poisoned Maledictum, but it
why you had to talk to me?" Potter asked plaintively, staring at Draco like he was a horrible person. It was a look he gave surprisingly infrequently to Draco in the red line. It made Draco especially uncomfortable right now, without knowing why.
or other such nauseating tripe, show forbearance at such an ungodly hour for a Sunday, and kindly explain instead posthaste what current crisis has led to you skipping meals in the Great Hall."
You would have had to be deaf to miss the loathing in that voice. "No," Dantanian said, with utter conviction, and pulled himself back from Elizabeth. "She wouldn't lie. Not to me. She never lied. You're the liars. You probably aren't even my real
"Waiting for you, actually," Weasley said sheepishly, and held up his hands. "Please don't hex my tongue!"
"No, if it's my birthday then it's your birthday too," he said stubbornly, and held up the bottle higher. "I made this for you. Happy birthday, Maman!"
"Okay, fine, you're right," said Draco. "So I went back on Christmas and I managed it-"
"You're boring," Draco said, waving a hand to dismiss him, only for Blaise's face to remain, with a bleaker one fitting in place behind it. Theo's lovely blue eyes were clouded with concern.
! Not that bloody
"'M fine," Draco slurred, and she sat down beside his bed with an awful shudder, wrapping her arms around herself. Her eyes were red, her face swollen, clearly from crying. A role reversal, he supposed, from just around this time last year, and she stared over more incredulously as he began to laugh. "No, sorry, 'Mione, 'm okay, Striker, promise..."
"Do you mean Terry Boot?" Draco said skeptically. "Or Tony Goldstein? They're both sixth-year Ravenclaws. You have the right age range, give him that at least, Severus..."
"I don't know," Draco said, and crossed his legs, leaning back and turning his head around showily to display it. "Do you think it suits me?"
There was a collective series of groans above him, Granger's the most amused. "He's fine," she said, and stroked his hair softly.
"Come, godson," Severus called, then beckoned him back. "Talpa," he called, swirling his wand around himself before tapping Draco, and making the Disillusionment charm envelop him as well. "We must not be
Although that didn't keep both Draco and Luna from exchanging a sour look at the mention, remembering their escapade with the potion in fourth year and the eventual result. Well, it wasn't the potion's fault they'd taken it too early to get the job done. Still-
Draco's twelve-year-old frame was laughably easy to dodge Bludgers with. Sometimes, he didn't even have to fly to get out of the way, when a twist of his narrow body or a press closer to the broom would do. He loved the mounting frustration it put in the Beaters each time they failed to hit him.
They watched each other, for a very long and protracted moment of suspension, and then Dantanian leaned forward like he couldn't help himself, and pressed a kiss to Dorian's cheek. "Congratulations, Dorian."
"No," Harry blurted, "Nothing is, you don't understand, it's my fault, I might as well have done it to him," and Draco pulled back to try and read his troubled face. There was a seething chaos there, like something had been pushed over the brink, or taken away that could not be taken back, and even the touch of Draco as his anchor was nowhere near enough to put Harry back on his feet again.
"Oh, and there's the blackmailing the Pensieve memories from Professor Snape," Luna sing-songed merrily. "And what that letter proves about the headmaster, and no, Draco won't tell me that part either... but anyway, Professor Snape, as far as we know, still hasn't even told the headmaster of any of this. And really, you should talk to him, Draco..."
And what of Potter's did you see this on?" He snorted at the look on Draco's face. "Ah, perhaps this Potter story of yours is true. You look conflicted enough at the thought of having to
"I wasn't sure. Some form of poison by all appearances. Perhaps a variety of snake venom."
"As is only appropriate," Draco preened.
"You are indeed the rightful owner of this wand," he said, and the first stepping stone was cleared. "But you are a minor child. And the account is not in your name, nor do I recall any reference to you in the account-"
, Draco. I know he's dead, the diary's destroyed. But when I looked down at my reflection on the water, he was there behind me, in my ear, whispering promises..."
It was child's play to beat Diggory, when playing against a Seeker who had not already played out this exact match. Draco had caught the Snitch the first time, and he did again, although the score of 210-80 didn't exactly bode as well as it could for their overall points tally. But from the looks of the match, things would only have worsened for the Nimbus-less Slytherin team.
to wise up and take Ginny out of the pool, he'd be an even bigger fool than he already was. "I can't let him think I don't care. I do. I do! I just-" Hermione gestured to lower his voice, and Draco wished he could just lower himself through the floor and disappear. "I just didn't want him to know about Dantanian. I didn't want him to think I'm a monster."
It was what he always did with danger, freeze up if not outright flee. He didn't think he had in the Forbidden Forest, but the centaurs had saved him before he would ever know, and now he could see his own true colors. With meticulous planning, he could accomplish things, like with the Vanishing Cabinet, but in heat-of-the-moment confrontation, he was worse than useless. The passive approach had suited him best, because that was what he was-
"Yes," Hermione said, and put a disgusted look on Umbridge's face as she answered, "Because he had been the Secret Keeper who knew the location of the Potters, not Sirius Black."
"Oh, Draco, you needn't be so afraid of everything," she sighed, fondly exasperated. "Is this the boy who walked right into the Forbidden Forest without a second thought? Don't worry. I know you're not familiar with technology, but I promise I won't let you get hurt."
"Enough of this," said Lupin. "There's only one way to prove what happened. Get out the rat."
"We must be miles under the school," said Potter, voice echoing in the tunnel. Say one thing for following Gryffindors about, it did give a more expansive tour of the attractions of Hogwarts.
"Out," Draco laughed, throwing his head back and closing his eyes so he didn't have to look at Severus anymore. "Out, Severus! Out! Get out of here! Get away from me, you fucking traitor, get away from me- why, why is this so
Lupin touched Draco's shoulder, and gave him a smile like the softest and sweetest of moonlight. "But it is true, Draco. I love Sirius Black. And I'll tell him myself."
"Traitor," Draco hissed, and poked a finger at Potter's shoulder. Once his fingertips grazed the smooth hollow of Harry's collarbone, he found them disinclined to push with as much force as planned, or leave anytime soon. So he rested his hand on Harry's shoulder with a purposeful air, as if squaring up and presenting them as a united front against the intruder.
Draco directed them to fly down to the pitch and sit, with Blaise coming over from the stands with a look like he knew what this was for already. Dobby, Wooky, and Nissy showed up with seats and refreshments, but the air was no less strained from it.
"You see!" Father exclaimed, ecstasy filling his eyes, as if he believed his own lies, as if his son had finally turned out to be everything he was expected to be. "Draco, you have brought pride... great pride to the name of Malfoy... my clever, clever son..."
"Pavo stayed- I imagine out of amusement if nothing else- and Luna made him the Mirror of Espilce, which she said would render the invisibility cloak a perfect Hallow, and truly protect him from the eyes of Death and his grasp. She aimed high, for a mirror that could not just absorb light from the world around it, but pull light from the sky, the sun and the moon and stars. As her name suggests, she seems only to have succeeded with the moon. Perhaps she should have consulted with Sola.
at Xaphan, where had Hermione and everyone been?
They looked soothed for him to have finally said something remotely normal, until they heard Draco smugly tell Hermione, "I can't wait to tell Ron I won the favor of your family beast."
"She's not into anyone but you," Draco said. He should have seized the chance to talk up their budding relationship, but found his guilt too strong to think of anything else. "And your love life is not what I'm worried about right now."
"Three... two... one... go!"
Draco's hips tilted back further, a bodily ache he didn't register at all. The angle made Harry's next hungry thrust drive
"Give it," Draco said, and took the smaller-looking coat and demanded Luna hold out her arms. She put her arms in the sleeves, then let Draco put the coat on her. It was shabby enough that even if he hadn't seen Ron wear it, he would have known it was a Weasley's. He snapped all the clasps to close it, and took a scarf from Potter to wrap around her neck, before holding up his arms for another coat. Potter handed it down, and Draco had the same relief as Luna, even if it meant he'd had to once again expose his face to Potter. "Thank you, Potter."
How did you solve a problem like a clingy Potter? Draco held up a finger, then pulled Potter over to the side of the hall, giving him a stern look. "Will you stop moping around and feeling sorry for yourself, Potter? You're going to take all the fun out of it for Ron and Hermione. If you want people to start treating you like an adult, start acting like one."
you, you stupid-"
"It was a lie, though," Gilderoy said anxiously, as soon as the memory had ended and Draco pulled his head out of the Pensieve. "I tried to avoid it- tried to dig under it- but I didn't get far enough, and in the end we had no choice but to risk it. And myself and all those little girls swam and struggled through half of that terrible lake and its cold, but once I was out of it, in time, my magic returned. I can't remember how long. Only that they wanted me to make a fire, and I could. So I told the Catalan ministry, but they don't
"I think she heard you," Potter said guiltily.
"You know you'd be luckier," Draco said expressionlessly, "If the Dark Lord has his way with you and kills you first, than if you're first in the hands of my charming and hospitable Aunt Bella."

"I know, Williamson, I know, I saw him too!" Fudge whimpered incoherently, still in pajamas under his pinstriped cloak. "Merlin's beard- here- here!- in the Ministry of Magic!- great heavens above- it doesn't seem possible- my word- how can this be-?"
Severus looked as though he was once again contemplating Langlock. "If you imagine impassioned pleas for

Millie saved most shots.
Which was fine and good in comparison with the final piece of the puzzle she insisted on imparting, which was the supposedly suspicious presence of Severus, heading towards the room with the three-headed dog that the Gryffindors had discovered after their midnight duel. Draco was subjected to the whole beastly story about Potter seeing Hagrid get a package from Gringotts in secret, which they thought the break-in at Gringotts had been a tardy attempt to steal, as if the largest Wizarding bank in the world was some schoolchild's cupboard which could only hold one large item inside. They didn't have any real theory as to what that item was, other than something magical and dangerous, but they seemed convinced Severus was evil and trying to steal it.
"I don't want to, please," Gilderoy gasped, and this was not exactly calculated to entice Grindelwald to cooperate.
Phineas sunk back to his knees of his own accord. "You got into Azkaban. You never stopped trying, even when you said you did. You spoke to
does sound more appealingly archaic-"
Friday night at the Three Broomsticks proved happening enough that Draco was glad for the relative disguise, and glad for his growth spurt over the summer to keep his youth from standing out too much. He didn't go anywhere near the bar, just looked around for Skeeter's blonde head, and found she had done him the favor of securing an isolated corner behind a set of columns for her interview. Figured, she would be trying this transparently to isolate and trap her prey.
glad Ron got it and not you- don't pout. Yeah, rejection feels like shit, but this means so much more to him than it would to you. Don't you remember what he saw in the Mirror of Erised?"
, he couldn't do this, he was just a coward...
, go or I'll-" Draco reached for his wand, and his hand dropped. "I'll-"
what he is. Your wand, boy!"
Draco couldn't believe how calm and almost commanding Potter seemed, even through his obvious fear, looking up at that insane beast, green eyes almost iridescent in the moonlight.
Taken all together, Sirius could not have looked handsomer if he tried. The photographers for the papers outside must have loved him, with that swaggering, arrogant Black stride. But Draco was most proud of the finishing touch: hung prominently from those crimson robes, glinting in the torchlight, was the unmistakable sight of Cornelius Fudge's pocket watch.

"Gather round, all, if Professor Moody wants, let's take a look at the Order of Phoenix together!" Draco barked. "See, here's Hagrid up at the top, can't miss him, there's our professor himself, can't miss him either! There's Albus Dumbledore, there's Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Peter Pettigrew- there's James and Lily Potter, you might have heard of them- and there's Frank and Alice Longbottom back on the other side! Look at them, they do look a bit like Neville, don't they?"

laxly these days." He earned such a cold stare from Mother, for his temerity to speak to her, that he scrambled into his own seat red-faced, like a mole popping its head back underground. The Weasley twins cracked up in unison, as did their other older brothers. The younger Weasleys, though, came over with their guests to examine the flowers Draco had embellished. Draco explained why he had conjured it up for Winky, which she enthusiastically endorsed from behind her cocoon.
Severus pinched his forehead. "A Basilisk, you say? And how have you come to this
. As if he ever could have been a match for this.
Draco didn't know what was going on his head, as the bliss was gold and yet as rotten a clay-red as in the cauldron, self split in two as he laughed, Harry's eyes trained not on the abomination below but the laughing Malfoy, face wracked even now in not hatred but doubt...
"No, no," Grindelwald laughed, swatting a hand playfully through the air, as if all of this was child's play, purely intuitive. "There is a Muggle term- see, I am well-versed in the works of those such as Freud, whatever you think of my believes on Muggles- known as
Oh, Draco
Seeing Draco get fancied up, Luna had insisted on doing the same, perhaps suspecting what Sirius was about given that she'd been the one to make him the initial suggestion. But Draco hadn't accounted for the effect that might have on poor Neville. The bloke had enough to worry about already.
When the bell clanged, Father told him, "Touch
"Come on, Hermione, he's lucky I didn't make him do this the last full day of term," Draco laughed. "Everyone isn't even going to see him on the Hogwarts Express."
"I told Ron and Hermione already," Potter said, ignoring his sarcasm. "And Sirius and Remus. Talking to Sirius through the mirror you gave me really helped, so, um... thank you?"
can make your life more difficult. Flagrante," he said, and tapped her Quick-Quotes Quill. "Are those expensive? I wouldn't advise touching that, ever again- come on, why did you have to touch it?" Draco complained, as she reached out to feel it, only for a scalding heat to sear her palm. She shrieked, but no one could hear her.
Draco hastily stepped back out of the line of fire behind Luna, which sent him near Potter. "Draco," Potter said grimly, "I never thought you were a bully, but-"
Aunt Bella sat there in the chair where she had taught him, an obsidian dagger between her pale hands that reflected the fire.
"Are you mad?" Voldemort asked with contempt, and Luna nodded brightly.
And that's it, everyone! Thanks so much for all your thoughts and comments, they really mean the world to me! Now I'm excited for the changes to come in the next book, which will start in two days! :)
"See, Hermione's right," was all Harry whispered, while Mr. Weasley queried a bewildered-looking pair of nearby elderly Muggles about what their walkers were for. "I bet you could pass a Muggle Studies OWL if you tried."
"Rude," Draco sniffed. "My best friend is no one's
He must have spent longer than he realized talking to Dobby, because they were interrupted finally not by another elf but a human. "Draco," the voice said, and it was not nearly lilting and cutting enough to be Severus's, the only person Draco would have thought could have the temerity to come drag him out of here. "Draco, you have to come to bed with me, it's well past curfew."
Draco let out a wordless shriek and sprang forward, almost falling out of bed before Luna could run forward to steady him.
, with a very fine sparkly drawing of a Basilisk beneath the red and gold letters. How had he missed her making and bringing that? He'd really had tunnel vision on Harry, and then on not seeing anything at all.
He thought he remembered covering the bubble-head charm in sixth-year with Flitwick, but he hadn't exactly been all there back then. It wasn't like he'd been planning to sit his NEWTs either, or expected to live long enough to have the chance regardless. So he didn't remember the incantation, but he'd been determined to have this charm since yesterday afternoon. Thinking back to the night Severus burned the diary had triggered the recollection of Severus putting it on him, when he'd thought Draco meant to stay.
that?" Draco prodded. "That

the dark side. I have two goals for this year- to do well enough in my studies to one day become an Unspeakable, and to end your pathetic existence at Quidditch. For anything else, Draco Malfoy is not at home. Capiche?"
"Confringo!" Bellatrix yelled in pure rage, seeming to think anyone on the other side good enough prey to be blown to blood and bone. The curse exploded just in front of them as Draco seized Gilderoy from Severus's feet and tried to drag him backwards. Severus cast Nebulus, joining with the smoke and debris thrown into the air from the stony mountainside to turn the world ashen charcoal-grey. It threw the immediate stream of exploding rock from him, Draco, and Gilderoy to behind them. Dobby lifted a hand and snapped his trembling fingers and shield came into being just in time to protect himself, Harry, and Grindelwald. Then Father cast some curse that flew past Draco's face in the smoke. Draco would never know what it had been.
"No, you would be welcome as well, I am sure, in Care of Magical Creatures. I would have to speak to Professor Burbage about Muggle Studies, but I would expect so. It is only, for Divination... there is a note here that Professor Trelawney would
Draco's mouth had gone dry. He had to lick his lips several times to wet it enough to speak, and Theo's sideways glance at him was just white noise with the thrumming in his veins of possibility. "It's temporary, though, right? Two sunsets. So I don't know how useful..."
Draco left Ancient Runes the next day, happily anticipating an afternoon off now that he'd been banned for life from Divination, only to find Cedric Diggory waiting for him. He pulled Draco around the corner and behind a statue, before Draco could protest.
"It was only fair," Draco said uncomfortably. It was true, even if he would never have thought that back then. "I had been the one to order Dobby to do it and get him in trouble. It wouldn't be fair to let him take the punishment. I didn't know my father would just
Draco must have turned red enough to look guilty. "People like Potter," Severus said, voice rising to a vicious pitch, "Father
"It's not just romantic," Draco explained. "It's the greatest desire of your heart, whatever that is. For Harry, it's seeing his dead parents, alive with him again. For Ron Weasley, he was Head Boy, Quidditch captain, winning the House Cup, all that. For Hermione Granger, it was defeating the Dark Lord and all of us living through it. You get it?"
knew about Draco, he likely did, better than Harry himself.
"Jackson Shaw."
it. Just don't go haunting me if it gets you killed."
"Minotaur!" Millie yelled, and the three Chasers zoomed out wide, switching positions and interlocking each other's flights in a beautiful green-and-silver impression of the grid spell in the air.
"Sure, Potter. We can go with that explanation. Well, Dementors are dark creatures. The darkest of dark. Silent and hooded and faceless all in black. They're sort of like ghouls, they're very cold. And they feed on human souls."
"You don't need a Draco translator!" Draco exclaimed, though he saw humor in her sleepy green eyes. "And it's not a bad favor. I think you'd enjoy it. You have thought about playing professional Quidditch, haven't you? Well, it would be a favor for you as well. It'd involve the material Viktor Krum sent me last year. And he's sent me more since.
," Karkaroff said pointedly. "I read about it in a book I found. I have been collecting them from the ruins." At Draco's half-incredulous, half-accusatory look, wondering what plotting had led Karkaroff to want to stay here, Karkaroff raised his hands defensively. "Why not? What else have I to do here all day? Some men are intelligent enough to
"This should be an isolated incident," Remus said grimly. "The Dementors are still faithfully guarding Azkaban. You must have heard Sirius's suspicion that they were sent not by Voldemort but by the Ministry, in an attempt to draw this very response from Harry. He is known to be proficient in the Patronus charm- I've heard you may have written a song on the subject." That gentle barb didn't even draw a smile from Draco. "And with this hearing, they would have gotten what they wanted, though immediate expulsion would have been more ideal. It has become too public, if it was them, for them to try again..."
And then came touch, at the Slytherin green of his tie. "My eyes are from my
"It was all the pain at once, I think," Draco sighed, "But I'm glad I got it over with. I couldn't have lasted much longer, I'm glad I passed out from it- thank you, Dobby, you saved me again, so you don't have to punish yourself..."
"Draco," Hermione said firmly, "There's nothing to be ashamed of, falling in love," and hugged him so tightly he felt they both would burst, before rattling her bracelet in his face. He flicked the H for Hermione, and watched her stride back alone towards the castle.
"Mother," Draco said, voice cracking. "Mother, no. Please don't make me do this, Mother. I don't want to. I don't want to hurt you."
in his head, but it made Hagrid laugh, at the acknowledgment of his nickname for Draco. "That's almost as rude as saying there aren't any Horklumps at Hogwarts, when Potter's standing right next to me."
"I'd like to think surviving it made you stronger, Luna," Draco sighed. "Though more often having something terrible in your past just makes it harder to keep moving forward."
"Borgin & Burkes," Potter said with a grim smile, and with the hand not holding a blood-stained sword, held up the diary before Father's face, showing him the hole seared into it. Then he held it out to Father, and Draco held his breath. "You can have your diary back if you like, Mr. Malfoy. It's of no use anymore."
"He'd had a lot of mead first, I think," Neville said, wilting under Hermione's glare. "He really was nervous about your first date. I don't think he knew how drunk he was getting, and then this Slytherin drink..."
The way Wormtail cringed and shied away at that reminder, making Potter the one to snag his shoulder and drag him back before he stepped into the green fire, was proof yet again that Black had him caught.
"One less time than I'd like to," she said, and so he began to tell it again, in all the painstaking detail she could ever wish for.
And the correct response to that was playing the innocent victim, but Draco was fifteen now. A little old to keep playing possum. And his resolution not to make an enemy of the woman had gone up in smoke, the minute she spoke the way she had to Luna, fake tears or not.
It was just Finch-Fletchley and Nick for now. He was left waiting all day to hear, without doing a thing other than bask in double the stares after the duel with Potter. He'd considered asking Dobby to follow Finch-Fletchley, rather than spending his free time watching over Potter like he usually did. But if Dobby got petrified or worse in the process, that was just one more failure to add to the list. Dobby, Hermione, Ron and Harry and Severus and everyone he cared about- even the other second-year Slytherins, they were all at risk, and Draco wasn't doing a damn thing-
He'd also learned a thing or two about handling Draco. By the time the first hour had elapsed, Draco was beginning to despair of drawing blood after all. Or rather, drawing
It did kind of feel like that.
"And whom," Dumbledore said quietly, "Do you believe he would send to replace me? A returning Dolores Umbridge, perhaps?"
spent enough time tracking Draco's movements around the castle for Draco to notice him. Time for the magic words. "Scared, Potter?"
"I could kill you so many different ways," Dantanian said softly, "Before you came close to making the call."
save you quite easily, couldn't I, Uncle Sirius? It's a pity you had to try and
Luna was so good at acting like her first year hadn't affected her, so good at making a joke or a non-issue about what she had experienced with Riddle's diary, that it hadn't even occurred to Draco as a potential stumbling block for anything romantic. The memory cut through Draco then, though, and made him feel like the worst cousin in history. "What kind of dreams?"
"Cousin!" Draco yelped in panic, waving his arms, but Luna just waved and kept chanting as his Beaters carried him about the pitch. He couldn't imagine the professors overly approved of some of the lyrics, but there was one who seemed to: Severus, who came forward and let Vince and Greg know that had been more than enough carrying, and if they dropped his godson, they would be forced to look for a new house... perhaps Hufflepuff had space in the dorms...

"Did I really
"His cousin?" Riddle asked in mild surprise, and looked between them. "I suppose I can see the resemblance. Although you were a stranger to
the voice said, and a wave of bliss swept through Draco so much he began to eagerly trace out the shape on his arm. "That's it," Crouch said aloud, "Draw it, show everyone exactly who you are," and his voice in Draco's head said,
"Don't be ridiculous, Ron," said Mr. Weasley, who looked no happier than Hermione at the thought of Ron playing rogue vigilante. "Black's not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard. It's the Azkaban guards who'll get him back, you mark my words."
Draco smiled at Ron to show he meant it, with a poke in Ron's ribs. Ron enfolded Draco in a half-armed hug, and Draco leaned against him with the guilt of a relief he didn't deserve to feel. "Bloody hell, Frankenstein, I'm so glad you're alive."
Fiendfyre left Draco's head after a time, drowned out by the rain that poured down on Slytherin during nearly every practice that autumn, merciful only to the extent it seemed to pour down the same on Gryffindor as well. Draco's prowess with cleaning spells was not one Potter shared. It was more than a few times that Draco caught the memorable sight of him with his crimson robes drenched right to his body, a second skin like he would molt into a phoenix, or more comically tracking mud into the castle, dirt and grass and rain covering him even after changing out of his robes and showering.

"I'm not a hero."
Harry contrived to look resentful even of that magical object, if it were to get a kiss from Draco. "No," he muttered, shifting, the fate of the world on his shoulders and yet as artless and open when it came to his feelings as the day they met. "I didn't mean to. I just- I mean seeing you happy, or even just seeming a little happy, for a moment- that's gift enough."
"Well," Draco said, with that false childish optimism he knew infuriated Father so, "She stayed at Malfoy Manor for a week last year, and I stayed in Hampstead a week, so that's two. And since Hermione visiting
Draco fought the urge to throttle the life out of her with his bare hands, no spells needed this time.
He stared at his round baby-looking hands, waiting as silently as if all the other first-years were invisible, only for Hagrid to start forcibly herding them into the boats. He made the mistake of stopping to look up, and there they were this time, the great dark wings of the Thestrals pulling the carriages above them, as visible as a dark rain emptying out the sky.
"Hey," Draco said, "Great news," and drew his wand. "I just came up with a plan to get the Muggles out of the way. What can I say, I'm a genius. Come on, let's go-"
His eyes weren't leaving Draco for a second. Just the sound of his voice tied Draco's stomach in knots. It was like after so long apart, turning over the idea in his head everyday of breaking it off, it was back to when they were first getting involved, the same suspicions of his own insufficiency. But Harry's gaze held him just as spellbound. Maybe more, now that he seemed was Draco was bound to and yet refused to lose.

of fire.
Draco thought intently in his direction, willing him to realize that if Voldemort had wanted him to talk, he would have bloody well acknowledged him already. No good could come of inserting himself, and yet Father did.
"Do you know," Hermione said fondly, "I used to think you acted so
Ron got into the spirit of things, piling on. "There's Draco stealing the bloody Mirror of Erised straight out from under Dumbledore's nose."
"That certainly narrows options," Draco said coldly, "Unless Dolores Umbridge has been

Dantanian instinctively pouted at this question. "Yes."
Gilderoy Lockhart
Krum seemed to be drawing some invisible armor around himself, there in the shed's close dim light. "I have been afraid of this," he said, and drew his wand. "You might best me, Draco Malfoy, but you vill not best me easily."
"What's the point distinguishing between light and dark?" Luna complained. "If a spell is useful, it's useful. We're up against Death Eaters,
Draco looked down at the water, embarrassed to be spoken to in so kind a tone, even if it was only for his likeness to Hagrid's actual friend. "I just want everything to come off smoothly. I don't want anything on fire." He remembered Aunt Bella setting Hagrid's hut on fire, after Draco let her into Hogwarts. He fought off a wave of nausea, trying to push the thought away before dwelling on it could make it hard to breathe. "I don't want to see your hut or the castle burn."
"Seeking slaves does seem to be a natural progression for you," Theo quipped, and Draco grabbed Theo, kissed him hard enough on the cheek that the sound echoed throughout the dorm, and then shoved him straight out of his bed and closed the curtains between them.
Everything around them was eerily silent. Harry's muffled gasps against Draco's mouth echoed in the chilled air, the damp profaned feeling of the night around them not seeming to touch Harry and his warmth. Inside and outside of Draco was warm as he let Harry press him back, press him down, even against a gravestone-
"You're loving this, aren't you, Theo?" Draco laughed. "Maybe you can write a book about all this when it's done." Theo gave him a startled look. "That is what you want to do after Hogwarts, isn't it? To write books? Be a real author, histories and legends like that?"
Father insisted on stopping in Knockturn Alley before anything else, which left him standing outside Borgin & Burkes for a stretch of time alongside Mother, trying to remember whether this delay had happened the first time, and whether putting up with it made it more or less likely he would run into Potter after all.
"Did you mix this?" she marveled, "It's perfect, you're getting better than your maman already," and he shook his head honestly.
," Harry gasped, gripping onto the arms of the chair hard enough that his knuckles were white. He looked rock hard now, as was Draco. Harry made a sound like he was being strangled once Draco was naked before him. One of his stiff hands shot out to loosen his tie, like he could hardly breathe at the sight. Draco pulled it off for him, tossing it away before reaching for Harry's glasses.
Far more imposing was the prospect of detention with Crouch. He was ready for a veritable torture session, and all the warier when Crouch just set him to copying lines, telling him to spend the full two hours writing
Heir to House Black
"Well said, well said," Ron said, and Draco gave him a surreptitious little high five behind Luna's back.
This was one of those nights to store up for the war to come, where there was no immediate threat hanging over them, and everything on the surface seemed alright. Neville even managed to get Luna back from Dobby after a few dances, standing up bravely asking if he could cut in. And Draco gave in to Harry's whining and danced with him more, a couple of faster songs and another slow one. For that night, surrounded by fire and flowers, he could believe everything was going to be alright.
, Draco, it's like you
"I would be so happy," Draco whined, "If no one ever said the word Boggart around me ever again-"

"The diary?" Potter asked, eyes going to the diary behind Draco and Luna like he was considering springing for it, if Riddle hadn't had all their wands.
"We're going to have a conversation," Draco said, and Neville stared in incomprehension. "A discussion, man to man. We're going to sit down and talk about
"No," Draco whispered. "
the last chance for Draco Malfoy to see the decorations," Dobby said brightly. "Dobby knows that Draco Malfoy will like them very much."
There was no time to dwell on the past night's revelations, in the chaos of Weasleys on the move. Draco was called upon to cast Featherlight charms on suitcase after suitcase, with Ministry employee Mr. Weasley happily turning a blind eye to Draco breaking the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery. The most confronting bit of baggage was Crookshanks, who did not appreciate a carrying basket after his long stint in a cage.
"Of course," Dantanian said calmly. "I'll go get paper."
Trust Severus to instantly hit at the true source, whereas even Dumbledore had not realized, or at least not confronted Aberforth about it. Draco had been in contact with Aberforth regularly, mainly through Dobby, and a confident false smile and a nod in Aberforth's direction were all it took for Aberforth to let his ally, and his ally's godfather, walk right up his steps and into his private domicile.
It had been Ron's idea, naturally, always the one to think of practical things. It had been for the football matches, and the natural fear that going somewhere so public, away from Britain and all his friends, would be unnecessary exposure for Voldemort's nemesis par excellence. Space from Harry didn't mean Ron didn't count Draco his friend. The very day Harry and Draco fell out so spectacularly, Ron came to him with a very nervous suggestion.

"I don't care."
"Here, I'll fix it," Sirius offered, and Remus cut his palm for him, with an apologetic kiss to the back of his hurt hand. He healed it for him once he'd used the blood, with another kiss.
It wouldn't be the first time he'd snuck out of Hogwarts, just far enough to Apparate, and gone to the outside of Grimmauld, though it was the latest time at night. He would have at least considered obeying that caution given out of godfatherly protectiveness, but Severus didn't know that Draco hadn't told Black who he was meeting. Draco was not about to let that meeting unfold without him there to break up the fireworks if necessary, like the world's most awkward blind date. He changed from wizard clothes to Muggle to help him blend in, since it would be optimal not to let them know he was there until necessary. He'd follow them into Grimmauld Place with the Sanguirenere spell, and listen in, and maybe they'd never have to know he'd broken his word.
"It wasn't how he looked. It was his presence. His aura. His
Before taking his bath, he took a Polaroid down off the wall to sit with him. He had his long angel's infusion then, with the one picture of Harry Potter with him, to sit beside him on the rim of the tub. In it, Harry was still and unmoving and confident, in his Triwizard champion robes with Draco a nervous wreck fussing over him to the side. Hermione had taken it before the First Task, and if Draco folded over the half with him on it, that was the beauty of Muggle photos. He could erase himself, without fear his image would just cross over to the other side to get nearer to Harry again.
"I am," she said proudly. "I'm loony. And I have something for you, Tom Riddle."
"Elizabeth, don't," Frederick said, his voice half-hearted, as Elizabeth raised her hand to backhand Dantanian once more across the face. The second sent him to the ground. He let out a muffled noise and pushed his hair out of his eyes, looking up at his guardians with cold resentment.
Luna got that darkness in her pale eyes for a moment that mention of Tom always seemed to put there, before she put on her usual false cheerfulness. "Tom didn't corrupt me," she said brightly. "He educated me and expanded my mind. And made me a murder puppet, but no one's perfect."
The strangers were speaking as they appeared in their robes with their wands out, two wizards and a witch, one wizard with a long blond ponytail and the witch with short-chopped bright violet hair-
"I didn't mean to," Black began. Thinking of the words seemed a real effort, let alone forcing them out. "I thought of it as- it was like it was just another prank. A clever way to scare you and get you to leave Remus alone. It never entered my head you might die."
With Severus's guidance, Draco remembered the night of the 21st, from the beginning of his duel with Bellatrix, and pulled a silvery thread from his head. He had misgivings whether this would work, given how airtight his Occlumency had become in that mental Langlock. He placed in the water anyway, and then submerged his face there. It worked just the way a Pensieve was supposed to. Maybe it would only malfunction when it came to the blue loop.
"It made me more powerful, but it also... I had to think about what I want for my life. And it's
"I don't care," Harry said, and took his hand. Draco let him hold it, heart gone to his throat.
Draco nodded, eyes going back to Sirius's part of the tree. "Oh, yes, Great-Aunt Walburga. She must have been so
so he just drawled, "You'll never know," and earned a very impolite gesture before George let him be.
"Maybe," Gilderoy said with that unimpeachable cheerfulness, catching Draco's drift, "It should be on how many times that Lestrange woman tortures you. Although I don't know how we could
Ron just got madder at Draco when he and everyone else saw him continually intervening in Potions to try and draw Severus's attention away from tormenting Potter. Normally Draco would just sit by and let it go. Let Severus have his fun, he deserved it. But it was hard enough for Potter with his brewing partner not speaking to him. Both of them were liable to melt their cauldron at any moment without Draco keeping a sharp watch on them.
Draco had gotten the distinct impression it was Quirrell, but it wasn't like he was an expert in these things. "Why, Potter," he intoned, rather incoherent, but not stunned enough to not take this chance to get something legendary off on Potter. "Not dead, is he, then? Slacking on the job that day, were we? My, my, could it be the Chosen One has been a fraud all along?"
of Harry indisputably belonged to Draco now.
"If it was this quick," Ron said, "It's Harry for sure."
Draco felt like he was going to be sick. At least she said Riddle hadn't played into it too much. But even how much he had made Draco want to find whatever remained of that diary and bring it back to life to kill it again. "Luna, that's normal when you're in love. Even if you're super young, if you like someone a lot, you'll get curious, even if you don't know what it means-"
, and protects you from the children who call you
"Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset," Hermione whispered frantically. "I didn't mean it, I don't mind her- er, hello, Myrtle."

"And you'll be around to help me get ready for OWLs!"
"A vampire whose years have taught him there are places where humans must tread lightly," Seguinus said with benign enjoyment, "Or be tread upon. My home is such a place. And it is not the Castell and its faded glory but the Estany de L'Infern at the center of its malignity. Have you questioned yourself
"No!" Hermione shrieked. "Frankenstein, no, you can't! What's wrong with you, you can't-"
Which meant Severus had all the more reason to reject the proposal Draco made next session about Wolfsbane out of hand. "No," he said, as firm and definitive as he always got when Draco asked to spend the summer with him. He said no when Draco repeated the question, no when Draco argued it would be good practice, and no when Draco resorted to whining. "The answer is no, and will remain no. If you persist, I may be forced to hand your remaining detentions over to Professor Moody, and see how dedicated you remain to producing Wolfsbane for your cousin's lover."
"Thank you," the voice said. "Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes." Draco handed them out as the voice instructed, "Visitors to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wands for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium."
okay? Because it's just you and me."
from the Langlock?" he purred, and licked all around Harry's mouth and along his recently cursed tongue, intertwining it with his.
"Why wouldn't you want Luna to have it, then?" Harry interrupted. "You'd never take back something that would keep her safe-"
promised Dumbledore he would pay, for keeping Draco Black in the dark.
Draco handed over his wand with a slowly fading sense of hope, telling himself there was no way Dumbledore could prove Draco personally had not
It would have been nobler if Draco could say he made that journey up the stairs to go find his mother, wish her a belated Happy Christmas, hug her and make sure she was doing well and tell her that he loved her. But he climbed them for a far simpler reason. Father's genealogy register had yielded unexpected fruit, in the presence of birth and death records of Malfoy house elves, and given Draco a fast-approaching birthday for Dobby: January 29. And he had a present in mind. It was one of the few, if not the only thing, about the Manor that Dobby had ever told Draco he liked.
It thudded through the Burrow, making the very walls shake to their foundations. Thankfully, the place did not fall apart over their heads. But it felt a close thing.
getting in the way of passerby. Even saving the school can only buy you so much goodwill before the first-year Hufflepuffs begin the stampede."
Dantanian considered. "Would you mind if we spoke a bit? Alone?"
"I only gave that bloody interview to try and look like I was totally against you. To keep up my cover after I
"I have contacted Madam Pomfrey with the Floo," Severus told him, "And Potter will be just fine. He's awoken, not much the worse, even from the Dementors, so you need not castigate yourself with guilt if this is the root of this miserable silence you maintain." Draco just stared over the mug of tea at him, pressing his face close to inhale its warmth without feeling the right to actually drink it.
"Why wouldn't they take you at Hogwarts?" Draco interrupted, wiping his face and leaning against the table to sit up, though it would have provided better support without the indentation of Dobby's head in it. "Did they speak to the headmaster? Is there still no room in the kitchens?"
History of Magic
"Draco, do you think that after what you did for my parents, if you're in trouble, I would ever abandon you?" Neville seemed to steel himself. "And you're my friend, Draco. If... if it's to protect my friends, I can be brave."
Neville's big brown eyes widened in horror. "I can't let you all go off to fight for your lives without me-"
"Doesn't miss a trick, your father," Ron said quietly in Draco's ear. Draco bit his lip to keep from grinning. Since seeing Potter pull the sword from the Basilisk's mouth, he had been riding a high like he was untouchable, Malfoy Invincible, like catching the Snitch a hundred times in a row. Even Father's rage was unreal in comparison to Potter's victory.
Harry was breathing hard with a face like thunder, though neither had their wands drawn. Somehow, Scrimgeour was the one with a look on his face like he was guilty.
"It might not be so significant. Dantanian lists L'Infern as one of his seven great fortresses of Europe, and he has insider knowledge of all seven, without specifying how. There could have been limited contact, between Dantanian and someone else who knew L'Infern, or even just letters, or a third party between him and Seguinus. My idea that Seguinus could have been the practical founder of House Black as an institution was ridiculous-"
incredible. I was just ashamed of
"If you don't want me to joke that you fancy me, Theo," Draco said equably, beginning the climb up the stairs, "Then stop acting like you fancy me. What?" Theo had remained at the base.
"Name one of your sons and I'll spare them. The others die. You pick who gets to live, at least for now. Unless you waste time. Then I'll just pick for you."
There was the sound of cracking and breaking all around, all at once, from the gargoyles and statues on the walls and towers above them, obsidian wrenching violently away from crumbling stone. Dark wings took to the air, with the bellows in the hands of the gargoyles already alight with waiting fire, bellows flashing as they worked, advancing out past the castle towards the tents and lights towards a wedding that erupted with screams and crashes and then flames, even in the deluge gone quickly alight. Draco could only stare helplessly at that sparking orange overhead of more and more gargoyles coming to life and flying, before it was dust blocking out all light from the sky, the impact of the statues taking flight to defend the castle sending the castle itself falling-
likely less than the one between Groundhogs and Panthers. He imagined Millie's sharp-eyed impatience, wanting to believe behind her feigned full cynicism, Vince and Greg competing to hide behind each other and making the other guffaw nervously, Blaise's showy arrogant overconfidence making Pansy whimper but giggle, Astoria staring fixedly at a small photograph of her sister from her pocket- and Theo, yes, Theo, Theo watching him with those brilliant deep blue eyes that held all the unwarranted faith in the world. Because they
are our future. And we will try to protect them, to stop them from repeating our old mistakes-
Draco had no idea what for until Harry reminded him, as much for Sirius and Remus's ears as Draco's, "They were supposed to be waiting here, in case Dobby came back to bring more help. But they got a letter from Bellatrix Lestrange- everything the same as the letter you got from her with the Black Dagger, except no dagger-"
"Count me out," Draco said hastily. "I'm going to send an owl." When the Slytherins protested, Draco quipped, "Very important blood magic to perform, you know, the Yule is
is in this castle-"
"Wait, what? Lucius Malfoy did
Draco's grin wouldn't leave his face until he fell asleep, even with the petrified face of the other boy staring right at him.
Harry shrugged, not indifferent, but truly unable to provide reassurance, when put so far out of his depth. "This looks just like in the memory. I watched it a lot, you know. Trying to understand you, what influence Dantanian might have had on you-" Draco tried not to flinch at that. "But I kept coming up empty. You two react to things so differently. What I did notice was this place. I've wanted to come see it. It felt... I don't know, like somewhere where..."
"This is us, boys," said Mr. Weasley. They headed into a corridor that Draco had gotten all too familiar with post-Azkaban. "My office is on the other side of the floor."
"Mmm. Be soft. Good. That's good. Mmm... don't stop..." It was incredible, how the rage seemed to subside, just from the comfort of Harry's touch. Draco's eyes shut, and stayed shut. Harry really was a dragontamer.
Hagrid looked thoughtful. "Well, I have missed Fluffy somethin' awful..." Padfoot looked enraged. "But I always thought, if I were gonna get another puppy, I'd be callin' him Meatball."
He parted from the DA outside with swift hugs, the twins included, and ran into the Room of Requirement as commanded. It was the Room of Hidden Things, with the line of children leading from the door right to the entrance to the secret passage. There were Ravenclaws near the door, telling the more hysterical-looking youngsters to keep calm and be patient, once they got past the threshold and saw the door to salvation just a few dozen heads before them.
Please, Mr. Black, never hesitate to make use of this channel to request any favor. I am anxious to repay you however I can. Even if it would be impossible, even were I not an exile, and- one must admit in good faith- an individual with a more narrow skill set than alleged in my published works. Severus has informed me that any assistance of mine is "less likely to improve than imperil"- such a way he has with words!- but I fear his assessments seem colored by a distinctly personal dislike. If you have any advice how to redress whatever wrongs I may have done Severus, I would be anxious to follow it, and languish in his displeasure no longer.
He tromped around taking pictures of the worst damage, then began attempting his best magical reconstruction, or at least patching the most gaping holes and sweeping the debris away. That gave him the excuse to make visits to Grimmauld every day of break, making very little progress on repairs in the truth, with memories of Dumbledore's ease at wordless instant repair serving for nothing other than to frustrate him. He made some half-hearted attempts to research in the Manor library, easy to hide from his parents when they were angry enough about him about the gala anyway, but ultimately that frustration led him to leave a note for the other party at fault for the destruction, and put it in one of the few undestroyed places in Grimmauld, the kitchen table:
"Yes," Dantanian said with a shudder of revulsion. "I suppose I do. Now tell me who you wish to spare."
He didn't know if she and Ginny were still training together, let alone whether she retained her cautious ambition of playing professionally. He snuck out after curfew in the cloak regardless, to see with his own eyes what was becoming of the girl whose hopes he had so treacherously raised in fifth year, only to send them crashing down as swiftly as Cantankerous Nott.
Draco pushed the door shut as quietly as he could. Then he rushed away from the tower, taking refuge in the closest section of castle that put a roof and walls around him. He grasped onto an unlit torch and felt his nails slide over the old wood and threaten splinters. He was more worried about getting glass in his other palm, as he forced down the draught of peace from his pocket.
Draco wondered if Luna's newfound friendship with Tony Goldstein was flitting through Neville's poor insecure head. "Neville," Draco said firmly. "How many people were in Dumbledore's Army?"
? You might as well call it Fluffy. What, is it because it's alliterative? Norbert, Norwegian ridgetail? No, surely Hagrid can be made to see reason-"
It didn't matter it was quick. It was still a feeling to savor, the pulsing of Harry growing bigger and exploding in his hand. It was because of
"I do," Potter blurted, "Challenge you. To a duel," and when Draco turned to be sure it was a joke like he had thought, his face was embarrassed but determined.
"I don't think it's humiliating," Potter protested. "I care about Hermione too, you know. Well- as a sister, I mean, like you do. Just-" He seemed to have lost his initial train of thought entirely. "Anyway, Hermione says you're not going to Hogsmeade with them this time, so maybe we- um, you and I could..."
"Finish your story first," Severus said, with a tightness in his voice that indicated how very much he indeed wanted an explanation for the Naufragiam.
"But isn't the problem there," Hermione argued, "The distrust of the wizards, rather than anything untrustworthy in the nature of house elves?"
It couldn't have been more familiar to her.
"Why do I have to-" Gilderoy began nervously, only for his eyes to dart about and go over Harry and Draco in reluctant understanding. He had to know that despite their ages, he'd be so much less useful in any fight, should Grindelwald prove difficult outside Nurmengard, once his magic- likely quickly- returned. "But-" He swallowed, and the memory from the Pensieve shot through Draco at once in an aching chill of sympathy, the sort he'd never used to feel for anyone in the blue loop but himself- he remembered Seguinus Sade playfully tormenting Gilderoy with the threat of the hellwater, and felt ill.
"Almost," said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.
"Grandmother was a py-ro-man-cer," Dantanian announced, prompting another finger to the lips from Astarte, as the French
Draco put his head in his hands, feeling like the worst idiot in the world for blowing up at Dumbledore, when he had been so off-base in his suspicions. "I understand why you wouldn't want to hire him, then, Headmaster, but I-" Draco bit his lip. It was more of a sacrifice than he might have expected to grudgingly force out, "I'll start eating all my meals in the Great Hall again. And I'll make more of an effort with the other second-years, I promise- I don't know where else Dobby
know about Dantanian- Severus, how am I supposed to look him in the eye again, knowing everything, and- I called you here because I think when he visits tomorrow, we should
Draco rose to his feet. "Speaking of my godfather," he said with a forced smile, "I think you've been right, Hermione, that I should talk to him. Bury the hatchet and all. It's bury the hatchet or bury the hatcheted, right?"
"Is that supposed to be music?" Ron whispered. Nearly Headless Nick was standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes, and seemed ecstatic to see Potter, though he tried to play it off calmly, and put his solemn face back on soon enough.
Severus turned to follow them along with Draco. They were heading not towards Hagrid's hut but making for the willow. When Draco turned back towards Severus and saw his half-doubtful, half-hungry expression, an unsettling feeling went through him, some presentiment of calamity from this happenstance encounter, as Pomfrey and the Gryffindor disappeared from view.
When Blaise shook his hand, he imagined Blaise meant it just about as much as Draco did.
Hermione's silence told the whole story there. "I knew it!" Krum cried out, voice agonized.
Draco shrugged. "Perhaps I've matured," he said loftily, and did not earn impressed looks, or even more of the intimidation he was beginning to take as a sufficient substitute, just disbelief. Theo in particular was looking at him like-
. Not just a master of strategy in chess but at life, the inimitable Sir Ronald, best and brightest of the Weasleys..."
At least one would assume. But lacking a wand had little to do with Draco's (Dantanian's) innate skill of pyromancy. There were no bluebell flames in the facsimile of Draco's (Dantanian's) ceiling light display that Remus had provided. But Sirius had surreptitiously given him a set of tapered silver candles in their stead, after extracting a promise to be sure not to burn Grimmauld to the ground.
"Let's question him, then," Draco said, and waved a hand to the other two. "Hermione?"
"Making it safe," Draco called back. "Keep watch, will you? Holler if you see them coming... stall if you have to... try and talk to them about being Famous Harry Potter, that might help..."
"Okay," said Draco, and took a deep breath, conjuring them cushions. She sat down on the ground with him warily, and he began. "So basically, yes, I went back to Grimmauld Place without you, but I had a good reason. Do you remember when you asked why Aunt Bella hadn't been blasted from the family tapestry? I got this obsession in my head that
"Alright," Remus said, voice cracking. "Yes. Yes, Sirius Black, you horrible bastard, yes, I will marry you!"
"Then why is it like you're trying to get yourself killed?" Hermione gasped out. "I need you, Draco. Even if you feel like we'd be better off with you gone, you're wrong. I swear to you,
Naufragiam carried on, as did the Wolfsbane, both with apparent success, while investigation with Theo fell by the wayside. The success of Draco's other major new extracurricular endeavor, the dueling lessons, was more up for debate. Harry certainly seemed to look forward to them, and would tell any of his friends who'd listen how amazing they were. And Draco had legitimately worked on trying to make them useful, outside of as a blood-stealing pretext. He'd consulted with the textbook, Sirius, Remus, Hermione, and on one occasion even attempted to with Severus, before a sallow hand went up and Severus intoned, "You can hardly
, and that she would never hear from you again. You will be pleased to know she did write that the article about Hagrid has been scrapped, thanks to your... heroics."
interest you?"
"How many things have you not told us-"
Gilderoy smiled then too, and together, with Severus still laughing in the background, Draco and Gilderoy began to rebuild the tower.
Draco couldn't follow what dark places Potter's mind was taking him. "Potter," Draco drawled, putting on his best expression of arrogant nonchalance, "Are you trying to tell me
"Okay." Hermione pressed her wand between the letters, one by one. Nothing happened. "Should I be doing some spell?"
"You're kidding?" Ron exclaimed, and they all raised their wands for Potter to look over the ground, but in vain.
old office at Hogwarts, as a caution for students who would do well to learn to be wise, before they are too old to learn-"
Draco feared that Lupin might kill Black then. But Lupin only wiped at his eyes, looking angrier at himself than at Black in that moment.
"What?" Draco hissed, wondering if Potter expected some kind of apology as well, some admission he was indeed the greatest at all things. He fixed his Slytherin tie with only a few tries, smoothing down his robes with the ostentatious propriety of a civilized being outraged by an animal, only for Potter to wince and point to his face.
Draco had been awed by these surroundings on his first couple visits, but thus preoccupied with his company, he was hardly impressed by the cracked open roof, or the wind it let in slapping tangible ice crystals against his lips. It would have been expedient, for him and Harry to warm their chapped lips on each other's, but not yet. Maybe soon, maybe never again. That was what hung precisely in the balance, above the small matter of Grindelwald's life and death, and a mirror.
Upon the restart, Draco had to grudgingly acknowledge that Potter's sense for the Snitch was sharper than his, so tracking Potter might be the best strategy to find it. He had to get close for that blurred dark red shape to notice him, but when he did, Potter appeared before him with photographic clarity, with the strike of a bolt of lightning just behind him: his hair swept back by rain, in that lightning whose thunder seemed to rumble from beneath them. They were so high in the wind and gale now, the thunder was below that would roll everyone playing beneath them away like a hurricane, and leave only the two of them, locked in the struggle that Potter would always win, if something darker even than Draco didn't send him falling...
"I don't care what he thinks. Did he tell her any of his theories?"
"You were always looking for the biggest bully to follow around, was it?" Draco said with a shudder, "To pretend you were as strong as him..."
, let alone want each other-
"Harry," Draco said coldly, "You're fourteen, not four. You can handle binding a bloke a little without losing your nerve like this. Now stop acting like a Hufflepuff and tie me up properly."
"Depends," Draco said absently, "I mean, this is the first place they'd look, so maybe not- except if it can only be accessed by members of our family, I don't know... but I don't think he'd trust Mother... here." They walked up to a long and very faded old tapestry, ragged at the sides, which Mother had talked about but he had never seen. Aunt Bella had used to joke Draco would be blasted from the family tapestry any day now, but it was her wand he raised to find his own name, at the bottom of the centuries-long trail of incestuously crossing gilded threads. "See, look. Draco Malfoy, 1980 to... hopefully not anytime soon." He traced the thread up. "Narcissa Malfoy..."
"I had a model to work from," Severus said without expression. For the first time, Draco noticed the deep, dark circles under his eyes, like he had pulled more than one sleepless night.
It did take a few more minutes of sweet-talking Grindelwald and both him and Gilderoy drying for things to get back in order. But with the promise of an explanation, along with warm clothes, warm food, and a warm bed where they were going, they had Grindelwald walking alongside them underneath the open roof of the entrance hall, marveling at its disrepair. "Goodbye, old bones," Grindelwald intoned to the broken stone. "Goodbye, my first and only castle."
after what happened in the graveyard, but I just..."
Nothing. Okay, maybe more formal still. "Demon goddess Hecate," Draco prayed, and his mind wandered wishing Luna was here. She'd do this part better. "Please let me speak to my kinsman, my- coreblood giver, Dantanian Noir. I bear his blood, and the blood of his beloved, in my veins." Draco cast a wordless Diffindo and opened one fingertip, smearing it over the bend of the wand. He remembered bringing the minds of the Longbottoms back, and smeared more.
"She's Muggleborn," Draco said, "And better with a wand than anyone."
, where he had put the name in anticipation of this. And now it was coming true.
"What the hell?" George complained. "Wouldn't have thought you all of people would be this squeamish-"
as interesting as Harry Potter?
"That obviously stands for Felix Felicis, for the record," she whispered, and Harry managed to get his mind out of the gutter long enough to agree to put Ron's plan into action that night.
Gilderoy jerked in shock, prattle cutting off. He darted to pull on a robe, a one of Remus's borrowed plain black dressing gowns. It was too late to hide, though. All the motion did was show a back covered in more marks.
It wasn't Draco's best comeback, not by a long shot, but it did the job.
That brief grim answer gave Draco a possible additional motive for Harry's avoidance, apart from the events after the Third Task. He'd promised Harry he would give him a godfather, gift him a real home and family. Now it must feel like Draco had stolen them for himself, as if the brand of thief  had been taken off Draco's palm somewhat precipitously. Draco would understand that resentment very well.
"I think I'm going to be sick," Draco gasped. "Where- is there a bathroom- never mind, I'll find one." Or a convenient potted plant, if the impending fit ended in puking.
"Riddikulus!" Luna shouted again, and with a twisting sound, Tom Riddle turned to the blinking, bewildered figure of Harry Potter, staring down at his tie looking dismayed to find himself in a Slytherin uniform. "Back!" she shouted at Harry, waving her wand and sending him stumbling past the cup. "Draco, disable the Portkey!"
"You're like Cinderella," Hermione breathed.
Draco was left for last. He might have been insulted, if he hadn't spent so much of the red line working to be considered a fearsome dark wizard. Really, he could only consider that decision by Dumbledore an example of successful branding in action. So he sat there a mess of nerves, one side smushed to Luna's and the other to Harry's, willing his friends to be as brilliant as he knew they could be, when the fate of a man as brilliant as his uncle Sirius hung in the balance.
Draco could feel the tension in the air as Vince quickly stopped banging his plates together.
What is it of mine, Draco Malfoy, that you have in your
Viktor blinked at him. "I vish you could give the speech."
"Draco, you haven't eaten," Mother called.
He didn't remember if he'd recognized Nott as Theo's father at the time, but he should have. They'd spoken last year at the Ministry, and right before, in that brief time Draco had spent pretending to be back on his father's side. Yet his old self didn't seem to care.
The best description for either, at least at this distance, seemed only to be
, her captor. She had spoke to him and smiled at him in her cell and been calm and patient and kind...
"And here it goes. Here's the real reason you're here.
Draco remembered the day he met Potter easily enough, because it was the day his parents were already planning to take him to Diagon Alley. Draco pleaded and pleaded to go a day or two earlier, secretly to avoid Potter, but they seemed too used to his whining to give in and shift their schedules. It had them going a week after he had arrived to find his Hogwarts letter, which meant a whole week of wrestling with the urge to tell someone. It was a measure of how unhinged and desperate Draco found himself becoming in the privacy of his own head, that for a split second, it occurred to him to use the Imperius Curse to get his parents to keep him away from Potter.
Draco was tempted to comment it must be easy for Father to make plans, since his removal as Hogwarts school governor meant he had much more free time. "We can do that," Draco agreed pleasantly, "
He added,
Practical
Harry laughed after saying so, embarrassed even after the lulling effect of all their kissing, and made to play it off like it had been a joke, even though it clearly hadn't been.
He should just be grateful the silvery lines of scars Potter had left on his body that year hadn't followed here too.
look terrible! I just know- with the magical exhaustion, they said you were practically in a coma-" She stopped once she saw him looking around at all the elves. "I've been so worried about you, you can't imagine. We weren't allowed to come see you. But I've heard about everything... everything that happened..."
"Typical," Ron laughed, when he looked over Harry's shoulder upon the trade and saw Draco had been less forthcoming.
Draco's own breath went shorter as it was cold and dark he had to breathe in, the Dementor seeming to emerge this time with a particular viciousness, memory sliding through his head, of all things, of Potter sliding his wand into his hand outside the courtroom, Draco opening his mouth and trying to speak to him, and Potter turning on his heel and leaving without a word-
"What was my mother called?"
"Well!" Hermione declared with forced gaiety, getting to her feet. "It's time for presents!"
"Professor Snape!" Harry exclaimed loudly. "Of course he fancies him! It all makes sense!"
. You did not put this on my arm."
Hermione was fool enough to react honestly. "Oh, Draco, you finally managed one?" She detached herself to run over and hug Draco excitedly. "Frankenstein, I can't believe it! That's so wonderful-"
"Don't worry," Draco sneered. "I have perfect control of it."
"Sometimes," Neville said softly. "I say a prayer for them to speak my name. I'm sure they said it all the time... before, but that's before I can remember. I can't even remember hearing my mother or father recognize me. So I used to pray for them to get better, but it never happened, so I just started praying for my name... I would try and bargain, if I could just know they
, he reminded himself, trying not to stare at his mother's name on the family tree, right above his own.
He didn't know who he was more terrified to be leading Aunt Bella to.
Draco took a deep breath. "Um, hello, Mr. Longbottom, Mrs. Longbottom..."
"Wait, you think Ron fancies
"It doesn't
And Potter wasn't there either. Draco's heart stopped until he heard a sharp wet sound of metal, and turned to the front of the beast to see Harry covered in ink and blood, Sorting Hat under his arm with his wand back in his hand, pulling a sword back out of the mouth of the dead Basilisk.
In their exile as social pariahs that followed, Hermione made the point that it would have been handy to know the spell Black spoke of planning to use to unmask Pettigrew. That was an anti-Animagus charm, which would make it necessary not to kidnap the rat, but only to get near him.  Draco would have spoken to Sirius about it as soon as possible, but Severus had confiscated Draco's two-way mirror upon finding it on his disgraced person in Gryffindor Tower, clearly believing it some manner of secret communication device with Potter.
"Will you help me pick?" Neville asked miserably, and Draco talked him up as they went into Dogweed and Deathcap.
"Run!" Severus ordered, and they all followed Severus's lead, the previously encircled combatants racing down from the stairs and literally over the Death Eaters' bodies as their final steps, Harry's shoe satisfyingly trampling the unconscious dark head of hair of Bellatrix, who it seemed Draco's spell had caught instead.
"That deal," Father said, "Was for the summer only. Your behavior during second-year was such as to make impossible any such leniency-" Draco could see he was about to finally attack Draco for ignoring his command to stay away from Weasleys. Draco's correspondence with Ron over the summer had given that fully away, even if nothing else had. To speak nothing of helping Dobby find a place at Hogwarts, and assisting in the defeat of Father's plot for the Chamber of Secrets.
Draco hadn't seen her since his mother disowned him. He hoped she wouldn't feel compelled to make some gesture. But thankfully, she treated him the same. Her attention was taken up by Fleur Delacour, who had made her move and attached herself to Bill Weasley. Her mere presence seemed to be driving Ginny and Mrs. Weasley mad.
They led her out, and Draco was startled to find all their faces looking mortified. "What if it's about the Wolfsbane?" Harry hissed. There went keeping that from Ron and Luna.
"Lumos maxima!" Draco yelled, and the brilliant light exploded in both their eyes, letting Draco take the roll to the side he had already mentally calculated, and done well enough that when he dropped his shield, no spell hit him. "Serpensortia," he could finally call, having to pull forcibly at his magic to make the snake come out, with how drained Potter had made him. At last it slithered out, long and glimmering and green. And, if his eyes weren't mistaken, bigger than last time. Far bigger. It always
"You are such a stupid prick!" Draco screamed, lunging at him again.
"Hey, you still with us?" Ron asked, waving a hand in front of Draco's face. "You've been spacing out staring up there all night." Luna nodded, looking unoffended.
of them are odious. It's like they were specifically designed to be as irritating as possible- their garish hair, their insipid attempts at humor- their
It sent a hush around the party when they got up to slow dance together. The silence was so profound that Draco had to recognize, maybe fewer DA members had known about them than Draco had given credit for. That didn't make Harry slow to pull Draco against him. Draco let him, resting his hands on Harry's firm chest, while Harry's went to his hips. Draco was the better dancer, but they were barely dancing, just stepping and swaying together, so it didn't hurt to let Harry lead. Or to let Harry nuzzle into his hair, lips hot against his ear. "Stop trying to turn me on," Draco whispered, and Harry laughed breathlessly, hands threatening to travel lower.
"Yeah," Draco muttered, "My godfather," and paled when they all looked at him expectantly. "Oh, you have got to be kidding me. If you think I could convince him to teach
Ron's eyes flashed, Gryffindor courage surging up and serving him predictably ill. "Fine! Hope you're ready to get destroyed! I'll pulverize you!"
"What does it matter?" Hermione snapped crossly. "OWLs are this year, that's the priority!"
Even if it was something he thought he'd never see again: those green eyes, brilliant above him in piercing worry.
"If you're supposed to show me my heart's desire," Dantanian complained, "Show me my mother. I want to see her face. Maybe then I could finally paint her properly this summer." But the Mirror of Erised, as many would testify, did not bend to any entreaties, nor threats or even attempts at destruction. Nor did it even when encased in what seemed to be
"No wonder, then," she said with a queer smile, "He cowers like a little worm. And what is this?" she squealed, as Draco placed himself in the way between her and Grindelwald. "What value has his life to you, hmm? Well, we'll have all our answers soon enough, my love." She turned back to Theo with a bright light in her nasty dark eyes. "Bring them."
Sirius smirked and twisted to show off the pocket watch, come loose from under the chains. Everyone leaned in to see. "I fail to see how this is relevant," Fudge said sourly.
Soaked in formaldehyde and displayed on the desk of
There was
Potter showed up, at least, to Draco's match against Hufflepuff, though Draco didn't have to ask Hermione to know who Potter was rooting for. Draco had worse things on his mind than Potter wishing him ill, things heavy enough to make a schoolboy Quidditch match seem as absurd as Black's wild snowdrops. He had sent three owls so far, and Black hadn't sent an answer to any.
"It's not that," said Harry, and was merciful enough to be the one to reach out and touch Draco, pushing some of his hair out of his eyes and behind his ears for him. The feeling of his fingertips against Draco's scalp had the same addictive quality he remembered, the same sensation of pure magic waiting there right at the end of his fingers. As much as Draco could want, if only he asked for it.
Luna sat down beside him, looking pouty. "Why is it alright for you, then?" Hermione sat down on Draco's other side, and he ended up glowered at between them. "Why, Hermione? Why will you let him get away with it and not me?"
The calm after the storm ensued, as most all the school but Draco's Slytherins had seemed to come around to Potter being a champion. Potter now had more energy to devote to sulking that Draco hadn't come to the tent after, or to any of the celebrations. To Draco's reminder he wasn't allowed in the Gryffindor common room anyway, Potter just heaved a dramatic sigh.
If he'd had to arrange the moonstones in the shape of the wheel of Hecate, then he could have been worried.
Draco tuned Theo out, staring frantically at the page. Three months total to make, with one month brewing, then a blood ritual, and two months of brewing after that. The ingredients were ones he could theoretically get, as a Malfoy.
"Research!" Gilderoy yelped. "We do research! Nothing wrong! And frankly, it's no concern of yours-"
Draco resisted the urge to clap. He had to resist the urge to cry a moment later, when he looked over at his uncle and saw tears in his eyes. Remus had them as well. Draco leaned around Severus and squeezed Remus's shoulder, thinking,
They arrived at Misuse of Muggle Artifacts, which could only be called a department in the same way a puddle could be called a body of water. It competed for prominence with the nearby broom closet, its brass plaque was shamefully tarnished, and could barely fit two desks inside. Mr. Weasley foffed about, showing off his bizarre Muggle collection. The other wizard misused enough to be assigned to the Misuse department was an old codger called Perkins, who rushed in to let Mr. Weasley know the time and place for the hearing had been changed.
, Draco could safely conclude, and settled on the guest bed with satisfaction.
Dumbledore's mouth creased. "Severus

to. "Oh, hello," Harry said, and then jumped in shock when he looked up and saw Draco was the first arrival. "Draco! Oh, God- oh my
"Right, Astarte, I remember," Berfrid said, eyes running over Astarte's body shamelessly. "You have her look. Though not that golden hair of hers. She was fair, you're dark. And she didn't have a body like yours," he leered, eyes burning into her shapely figure, settling for a time on her full breasts beneath her dress, then on her corseted waist and broad hips. "She was more beautiful," Berfrid concluded after, despite his visible appreciation. Astarte suffered this remark along with his inspection in silence, though she looked to have experienced it more than a few times. "And she could look in the fire and tell you what was coming for you-"
this?" Hermione exclaimed, tossing the book away in repulsion after only a few pages. "I know the Black family practices dark magic, but this is... this is just beyond the pale! I've never
Draco's wet gloves lost hold of his broom and he fell the remaining ten feet. When his body hit the grass, a pain surged instantly in his ankle so badly he screamed. He tried to clutch it, but found himself so dazed he couldn't move enough. He tried to look up into the rain for Potter, but he wasn't there anymore. Potter had landed to the ecstatic screams of three-fourths of Hogwarts, on the ground, on his feet, with the golden Snitch held up shining from his red-gloved hand.
Poor Potter. Draco had really thought he put it in the first time. He'd been so bitter, having fantasized about being chosen himself, and would have put his own name in if he'd been able to think of a way. Seeing Potter get the spot had made him feel vindicated in all his worst beliefs about Potter being a fame-hungry, arrogant egomaniac. He must have looked at Potter just like this in the blue line. But he didn't know how, even then, he could have missed the utter shock and despair in Potter's perfect green eyes.
"To Paris?" Dantanian said bleakly.

"I know he deserves better than me," Sirius said, tearing both hands through his long dark hair in frustration. "Believe me. I know he spent so many years thinking I was guilty, and being involved again and committing to forever are two very different things... I know I'd be doing a terrible thing saddling him for life with
"Nearly the entire school has stayed this year," Severus scowled. "I will not be having a celebration with the Slytherins this year. Nor had I expected you to come, let alone your cousin."
The first time he saw Harry again after his exile in the dungeons, he wanted to fling himself to his knees and tell Harry absolutely everything his tongue would allow him. He wanted to tell Harry he loved him and would kill for him. But this wasn't a fairytale. Draco was not about to be so naive as to let himself think it one. He was stronger than that. He was Severus Snape's godson.
man was about as likely to get the man talking to them as casting Langlock. "I apologize for my companion, Grindelwald. He's a bit overawed by your castle."
form of manipulation. It turned his stomach, with the associated memory of the noseless wonder he had known at Malfoy Manor, and the aunt who had adored him much the same in her time as well...
- and Slytherin are continuing their strategy of their Beaters exclusively targeting other Beaters. Samuels takes a solid hit, hacks a Bludger back at Crabbe- it hits him in the side, and he doesn't budge! Are these animated garden statues even human- oh! And there's Theodore Nott, speeding towards the hoops- pass to Parkinson- Bradley tries to intercept, and oh, he's collided with the Ravenclaw Keeper Page- that's 70-20 to Slytherin! A fifty point margin! The Slytherins have made up their deficit from the first match with Gryffindor already! What a terrifying lot of green gargoyles- sorry, Professor McGonagall, just being descriptive..."
?" Hermione said impatiently. "
"Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid," said Weasley, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. "I bet there's a book somewhere in here, telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?"
"And where," Severus said, picking up
"I thought you liked me helpless." Draco opened his eyes. Harry had taken off his glasses. Perhaps his mind was not so pure as Draco had been imagining. "Manibipiscatus."
"Dorian Malfoy," Lamia delivered, with audible excitement, "
Draco shrugged, refusing to let himself or Luna wilt under the pressure of a gorgeous, inexplicably distraught Potter, who had abandoned his date as if she'd vanished into thin air. "It may be unusual, Potter," he drawled, "But you can't say it doesn't
Severus slammed his hand down on the table. "AND THEY ALL KNOW THAT!" he bellowed. "This risk is ridiculous- for a ceremony with no legal stature to begin with-"
"No, um, I'm okay," Potter said, voice nearly breaking, and Draco turned to pout at him from very close.
And so it was that Draco spent the morning exploring the vast spread of tents over the moors in the capacity of paper boy, teaching Luna the charms and motions to send the papers spiraling in a green cloud around them. On the way, Draco bought himself a long, lavish deep green Ireland scarf worth three galleons, four separate rounds of candy flosses for them, and charms to temporarily turn both of their hair a delicate, pale mint green for the occasion. Luna declared it suited him, with his scarf and dark green robes. It certainly suited her, her waving pale green mane flowing free behind her in the breeze like a flag, drawing the attention of more customers. By the time Draco's watch read noon, they were both so sugar high their hands were trembling. They both kept dropping coins into the grass, trying to fit them into Luna's overflowing purse.
And left alone, it all unfolded the same. The Goblet of Fire was in its place in all its defective glory at the front of the high table, and Draco seemed the only one to have enjoyed the Halloween feast, with everyone else waiting on bated breath to hear the champions announced. He obligingly applauded when the blue tongue of flame spat out the name Viktor Krum, although it felt wrong now for him and Karkaroff to applaud for the same thing. "Bravo, Viktor!" Karkaroff called. "Knew you had it in you!" And Draco knew it was probably unfair, but that booming show of nauseating paternal pride made Draco disinclined to cede his best friend as a ball date to that strutting star.
no. Draco had never been happier to cower behind Potter.
She had done this more than once in the blue loop, but it had usually either been to give him a kiss, or berate him for his rank neglect of his
He opened his arms, and Theo hugged him, quick and fierce and full of fear, before letting him go and running back to Slytherin.
Potter heard him, elfen young face never more ethereal than now, bathed in fury and green fire. "Why did you do it? Why did you betray my parents?"
That Viktor's club happened to be in Bavaria, not too far from Austria? That was just the kind of coincidence that indicated the universe
"Yeah," Draco said, "From when we were trying to help Uncle Sirius."
this?"
"I'm sorry," Gilderoy said sadly. "What you must think... I never wanted anyone to know."
Dumbledore broke the silence after some time, without warning. Not looking up at Draco, he said, "You did warn me."
"Next you'll be taking your cue from Longbottom," Draco drawled, "And shooting your wand off at

Miss Alba holds hands with her friend as they speak of their ordeal. "It came out in the middle, and we all had to swim. It was very cold. Paula and our friend Núria nearly drowned, and Gilderoy swam them on his back to the shore. Then he cast spells to warm us all. It took us days to make it down to the town of Lleida. We were all so exhausted we could barely walk. Sometimes we had to carry each other down the steep bluffs. The vampires were on our trail the whole time, but when one caught us, Gilderoy used the Obliviate spell and stole the memory of finding us."

Luna went down to her common room, rushing to avoid breaking curfew, and Hermione and Neville took Ron into the common room. But Potter caught Draco by the arm. "Shouldn't you go take care of Ron now that he's your friend again?" Draco asked, and Potter looked shifty.
Eurydice."
"Are you gloating about that?" Harry asked in disbelief. "What Voldemort did to me? Are you proud that your father is, what, a glorified lackey, for that murderous madman-"
"Miss Lovegood has given a narrative of its creation to the Order, as well as to Potter," Severus said, and Draco's heart sank. "I will confirm it with you. She says that in the early spring of 1995, you enlisted her help in the protection of Harry Potter against dark forces, which you feared would attempt to use the Triwizard Tournament as an opportunity to hurt or kidnap him."
"Theo," Draco breathed. This was clearly a box for a proposal, which Draco had never thought to get. In the short time leaving the finished rings in a box of his things under his bed, and Theo sending off the bag, he had somehow managed to get this together, the most thoughtful of gifts. Or Draco
Harry's jaw set stubbornly, that jaw that seemed to look more hewn and perfect every day, less of a child's face and more masculine solidity. "It's just something else you left me out on. You always do that, Draco, you leave me out on purpose. Except if you need something-"
. I know you probably wanted to be alone, but..."
The memory ended very quickly, as if the one remembering had not wanted to linger on it a second longer than he must.
"As blond as yours?" Ginny asked, and Luna nodded. "Oh, that would be Draco. Draco Malfoy.
Draco had been making that mistake since the day he met Potter in the blue loop, up apparently to today without ever learning. He kept thinking things that would impress
"Look, food!" said Ron, and Draco had to admit the Halloween feast did have this party beat on one front. It showed a singular lack of hospitality towards living guests, the rancid smell it put off: large, rotten fish besmirching antique silver platters, maggoty haggis, burnt cakes, furry cheese, and of course a cake for the Deathday boy himself. It was a huge grey monstrosity in the shape of a tombstone, which read
"It has been a year and half now," Remus began seriously, "Since our lessons ended, really before they began. I have given it a great deal of thought, Draco, why you were so incapable of the charm, to the point of never even producing sparks." Draco had already heard mortifying tales of Hermione's otter and Ron's terrier Patronuses chasing each other about Grimmauld, though he had made sure to be high up in his room reading whenever that was likely to happen. "I have read a number of books involving the nature of the charm and of Dementors, as well as more books on magical theory..."
He led her to the place their cliff met another, looming so far above it shadowed them. In the furrows of the ancient water-worn stone, there were many turns and holes and hollows. Dantanian found one by memory, and pressed his wand against it. "The password," he said, "Is

"No." Augusta's hands clasped hard to her mouth, looking ready to hyperventilate. "Oh, Merlin, this is a miracle. I can't believe it, I'm going to faint..." She seized her grandson around the waist and buried her face in his shoulder, her earlier bluster silenced.

, Draco?"
Potter looked around himself instead, with a face like he could easily imagine all the sand turned to blood, and ripped sacks to torn flesh. "I thought you must be upset, after what Percy said in front of everyone. We all know it's not true, Draco. You should have heard how Ron screamed at his brother... and the others thought you'd be so angry that I'd better be the one to go..."
"That is not true," Draco whined, tossing his head, and Harry pulled his hair in playful argument. He undid the clasp on Draco's hair to get two full handfuls of it. It made Draco melt, the casual presumptuousness in that gesture, like it was up to him to decide about how Draco's hair should be, whether he wanted it free to hold in his hands.
"I'm kind of relieved not to be a prefect, honestly, you know?" Draco added. He found he was, without the prospect of having to face his father and explain why he hadn't been chosen. "So much bloody

only twelve years old."
"But I love playing Quidditch against you," Harry wheedled, green eyes brimming with sincerity as he leaned forward. "It's the best thing in the world. Draco, you can't give up. At least try, before stomping off to your godfather, okay? Promise me you'll try. And don't just go in screaming at your friends. You can charm them somehow, you're smarter than that- except, um, not the, uh, the way you said, not the bribery or the... uh, the... yeah."
"You should not have been able to block
Then again, maybe not. Ron's hand had gone to stroke along her forearm, leaned against her side, eyes fixed on her. And it was only what Hermione deserved.
He decided five out of ten could be worse, and moved on. This year's list read as follows:
He kept a nervous eye on his watch, patting his pocket to make sure his wand was there. Then he shoved item after item into the bag: notebooks, books from the Restricted Section, pocket money, leftover Murtlap Essence, Draught of Peace, and on impulse even Imoogi, before going under his bed to look for the books he might want. There, he discovered two small packages, sitting unseen until now. One was a perfectly wrapped present, with a tag marked as 'From Mother to Draco'. The other had Muggle-looking wrapping that told him it was from Granger. He hadn't been without presents after all. He just hadn't found them. But he didn't have time to open them, just shoved them into the bag and ran out.
he was- and the best thing he could give Harry was just his protection. And when the time came, letting him go to someone who actually deserved his devotion.

did to stop the monster?"
"Kaktusblüte," Grindelwald observed, "I fear you are becoming a bit agitated."
"Ron says he believes me now," Potter told them all happily, "That I didn't do it," and Hermione let out a shriek of happiness and threw herself on Ron, wet robes and all. Ron made protesting noises as Hermione grasped him around the neck, but Draco could see his ears turn red.
"Dean and Seamus said..."
. You said we needed Ron but we didn't need you. That you were just useless, and it was always going to be the three of us, not you. You don't still think that, do you? I thought you didn't, but... oh, Draco, don't cry..."
Luna cracked up, her light giggle filling the corridors as they escorted Hermione up towards Gryffindor. Eventually, Draco explained in the most euphemistic terms possible. Hermione's ears still went red, especially after Luna made an indiscreet remark, about how Hermione might wish to use the room with Ron before long. At least Ron's drunkenness didn't seem to have disillusioned Hermione enough to flatly disavow the prospect.
"But you're a pervert. A lunatic. You raped her, because you do that to women. You did it to some Muggle girl-"
"This is your doing, isn't it?" Hermione said, whirling on Fred and George, who protested their innocence.
Lupin buried his face in his hands.
Granger looked up from her Charms textbook. "Yes?" she asked with perfect innocence.
"I didn't mean- I just thought I should, since I was the one to cause-"
"And what," Father hissed, "Makes you think I would ever have any desire to protect you anymore?"

I don't
"The truth..." Draco closed his eyes, letting his voice trail off. He felt himself at risk of waxing poetic, but it was hard to even think before speaking when he was this tired. "Potter, you don't know how many things can be true at the same time, things that all mean different things and contradict each other. And yet they're all just as true. At the very minimum, there's always two different truths existing at once, even if everyone can't- can't see them..."
badges. At least Hagrid believed Potter, bless his heart, and so did Dumbledore.
"She went to the library," Ron told him, looking baffled. "She said she'd just figured out something. What, did she say something to-"
For Salazar's sake, the man had gathered him
in the medical sense. He informed Draco that these were called panic attacks, common among people who had suffered terrible things, especially at a young age. He said he'd known more than a few people with them, and that Draco shouldn't have been ashamed to ask for help. But Draco was mortally ashamed, all the more so when Severus said those brutally kind words. This was
