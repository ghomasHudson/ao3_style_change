Pansy stepped forward and gathered Draco into her arms, nodding furiously. “I’ll see to it, Master Potter. I won’t let him out of my sight. Thank you.”
Harry was still for several beats and then began to undress until he was only wearing his dark briefs.
Even if it hurt him more than anything else in the world, he would stay away from Harry Potter this time.
“Will you hold me, Harry?”
“Just
“But it is the man who lives that is the heroic one. Martyrdom to Muggles is like what
Harry licked up his hole, his tongue laving Draco’s perineum with long, wet licks and then doing the same to his swollen sac.
It was like nothing he had ever felt before. There were no more walls between them, no more lies. It was just Harry and Draco, sharing their bodies and their hearts.
This was it.
For right now, it was just the two of them and that was how he preferred it.
The man scoffed. “It says here you have ten years’ experience in household work, but you’re only seventeen?”
“And I’d give my own life to,” he swallowed thickly before saying, “free my mother. She was untruthful to me about her past, but I’m not angry with her. I’d forgive her a thousand times over if I could just see her again.”
between himself and his rabbit.
The Aurors he’d stationed at their home gave him a report each day and nothing of consequence had happened yet. Harry had just barely been able to stop himself from going there himself and demanding that Draco talk with him.
Draco snorted delicately. “My father and I aren’t exactly on speaking terms right now. I’d rather not worry him anymore than I already do…”
Draco’s slick was now dripping to the plush rug beneath their feet and Harry fought the urge to get to the floor and lick up the sweet nectar.
He was admittedly not used to physical labor and he was quickly realizing that he did
Alpha,
The man sighed and sat up, pulling a stack of papers from the drawer of his desk. He turned to face him fully and that was when Draco got his first real look at his face.
“I’m not sure. I just don’t feel safe at the manor now. At least, not until I know for sure they’re not coming back. The wards are back up, but I guess I’m just being paranoid.”
The thought of getting pregnant by that
After retrieving his bag from the carriage, he turned back around to survey the land.
What if they
Draco furrowed his brows, the abrupt command taking him by surprise. “Why?”
When the years continued to pass and he had never taken on a mate, Hermione had chalked it up to his inability to commit, but had it been something deeper?
Draco tipped his head back, keening at the feeling of Harry’s cock ramming against that euphoric spot inside of him.
again tonight?”
He raised one of Draco’s slender wrists to his mouth, sliding his tongue over the now bleeding, circular abrasion. He did the same to his other wrist, laying licks and fucking apologetic
“He is my business. Let him go, or I’ll tell Mr. Potter you were touching his Omega without permission.”
Harry climbed over top the boy, lowering his head until his mouth hovered over one of Draco’s leaking nipples.
Harry leaned down and pressed his lips to his mate’s, sharing a short, tender kiss.
He pressed his leg upwards, bending it until he was spread wide open. He kept one hand on the bed beside Draco’s head, his other hand holding him open as he began snapping his hips into Draco.
Harry hovered just above him, gazing down at him with hooded eyes. “If I untie you, will you play nice?”
He thought of Narcissa’s memory of Draco by the ocean, smiling and
Harry glared down at him, looking as if were on the brink of losing it. “Fuck,” he grated, turning away from Draco. “Even now, my instincts are clamoring at me. They recognize my Omega is in
Harry’s lips smelled of Draco’s cum and slick and Draco felt a twisted sort of instinctual satisfaction that his Alpha smelled of his juices.
“Is-is this okay, Harry?”
And he was scared.
He knew that it wouldn’t be much longer before his body won out and he would be reduced to nothing but a keening, begging
Harry was the first to pull away, his emotions quickly erased from his face and that damnable wall sliding into place between their bond.
Draco slammed his glass down on the table. “You are a monster! You’re using my mother’s
He had missed Harry.
“Harry, stop,
Draco stiffened on Harry’s lap. ”My...my

“Perfect,” he whispered.
”So good, sweetheart. Dada’s sweet boy, my
pleasure from this little ritual of theirs...could he?
Would his dada…
Harry immediately recognized Narcissa’s regal tone and stepped into the office of one of the Aurors on his team.
In reparation for Draco’s suffering, the Ministry had begun sending him funds each month to help with his relocation and life adjustment.
Harry was on his feet and making his way to the lift before the door to his office had even closed all the way, Draco’s bottled memory clutched tightly in his fist.
Draco reluctantly lowered his gaze to his exposed stomach. Beneath the tip of Arlen’s wand, was a fluttering thing resembling a miniature silvered jellybean.
And he wasn’t sure how
was what he wanted. He wanted Harry to hold him. He wanted his Alpha to make love to him and ease the burning hurt in chest. He wanted—
It made him whine around Harry’s cock, wanting their connection back with a vehemence that frightened him.
Draco nodded dazedly, his leaked slick coating his inner thighs and creating obscene wet, squelching noises as Harry pounded into him.
He knew that some of the Aurors that took shifts watching the boy’s home were Alphas.
Harry sat down in the chair next to him, pushing Draco’s plate closer to him so that Scorpius could reach his eggs. He even drizzled the syrup over their pancakes for them.
Harry grabbed Draco’s throat above his collar with one hand, lifting him from his seat. Draco clawed uselessly at the strong fingers around his throat, his airway cut off.
Harry let his knuckles brush against the boy’s flat stomach, imagining it round with his babe.
When he felt the boy’s wet scut press against his hard cock, he groaned low in his throat, exhilarating in the feel of the boy’s wet, downy fur caressing his shaft as he slid down to a sitting position.
Draco looked up and Harry gave a curt nod. “I will.”
Harry clicked his tongue, holding his fingers in front of the rabbit to smell.
An exam table had been set up in the middle of the room next to a table filled with magical medical instruments. Diagnostic spells in spindly, luminescent script floated in the air above the exam table.
Draco cast a surreptitious glance down, his eyes following the thin line of sparse dark hair that traveled from Harry’s navel and down, to his erection.
He gritted his teeth, yanking down his jumper.
The fingers around Draco’s wrist were warm and calloused, pleasantly rough against the smooth underside of his wrist. He idly wondered how they would feel against other sensitive parts of his skin.
Harry let out a strangled growl, repeatedly slamming his cock into Draco’s hole, chasing his own release.
In his pale arms, he clutched the stuffed wolf Harry had bought him to his bare chest. He was curled around it, most of his fair skin flushed as he panted in his sleep.
Maybe it was too soon for them. Maybe they couldn’t—
Their pup woke up, shifting restlessly within him at their Alpha’s touch. The pain in his lower back slowly waned, replaced by his Alpha’s euphoric magic.
Like a festering wound that continued to pulsate within him, the resentment and anger made the edges of the wound throb, begging to fed.
Arlen laughed. “I don’t think they like us talking about them like they’re not here, Draco.”
“There’s something else I should tell you,” Harry said, running his fingers through his hair in a gesture that Draco was beginning to recognize as nervousness or anger.
“Oh,” Roland said without inflection. “Let me get the server.”
euphoric spot inside of Draco. Harry released his nipple and pulled back, staring down at Draco with hooded eyes, his maddeningly slow thrusts never faltering.
the boy’s hair, wanting to inhale his intoxicating scent once more.
,” Draco sobbed, his body jolting with each punishing stab of Harry’s cock.
And in his heart.
“Now,” he said. “Get on your hands and knees.”
There was nothing left to do but wait.
Draco opened his eyes, the familiar feeling of anguish and hopelessness slowly overtaking him.
Draco reluctantly tucked in, choosing to eat the oatmeal first. The warm food against his tongue reminded him of how hungry he actually was. He began eating in earnest, ignoring Harry’s unnerving eyes on him.
“Oh,” he said dumbly. “I was going to—I came in here to—to dry them.”
Harry stopped in front of the armchair across from the bed. He sets Draco back on his feet, his unbridled expression of anger making Draco shrink back with fear.
Draco was at Potter Manor under the guise of looking for work to make money for his family back in London. His mother had given him faux paperwork with a pseudonym in place for his last name. While he was working and living in Potter Manor, he was to go by Draco Avery.
did you just call me?”
“I am,” he said softly. “Have you seen him since he’s been admitted?”
Hermione reached down, grabbing a small, gift-wrapped box from her bag and setting it on the table in front of him. “I hope you don’t mind. I asked Harry when it was so that I could surprise you.”
Draco lowered his head, tentatively daubing his tongue against Harry’s erection. The salty tang of his pre-cum had him lapping at the bulbous head, moaning softly.
?” he hissed, unable to keep the annoyance from his tone. “You didn’t have to accept!”
Scorpius’ eyes drifted close, his mouth going slack around his nipple.
Draco attempted to compose himself before replying. Nervously clearing his throat, he straightened to his full height.
“I’ll ask again since you seem to be incapable of answering simple queries,” he said coolly. “
Draco felt an unwanted stab of jealousy in his heart, his ears burning with mortification at the realization.
“No one,” Potter said flatly.
Harry smirked and sat in the armchair in front him, his legs lazily spread.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Come here.
Draco bit his trembling lower lip between his teeth and nodded, pressing closer to him.
There was a metaphorical line drawn between them and they were about cross it.
Scorpius huffed and reached up with one small hand to tug at a lock of Harry’s sleep-mussed hair.
Harry clenched his jaw, his fingers digging into the skin of his hip.
you!”
His skin looked slightly ashen, but other than that, he looked unchanged. The only noticeable difference to his appearance was the mating bite on his neck. Harry’s teeth marks on his throat had healed over, silvered indentions against his pale skin.
”Cover yourself,” Potter ordered as they walked.
Draco’s heart clenched, hooking his feet around Harry’s waist. He wrapped both of his arms around Harry’s neck, pulling him down to press his lips against his ear.
Suddenly, he felt irrationally angry.
A Healer sat off to the side, a quill in one hand and a notepad in the other. She was furiously scribbling notes onto the pad of paper.
He couldn’t
Harry arched a brow. “What?”
When they parted, Harry grasped one of Draco’s small breasts. Kneading the firm swell, he lowered his head and sucked Draco’s wet, pink nipple into his mouth. He groaned from the delicious taste of his Omega’s breast milk splashing across his tongue, sending a bolt of desire straight to his cock.
He remembered the taste of the boy’s blood, sweet and heady. His reddened hole beckoned him, unable to stop himself from wrapping his hands around the boy’s upper thighs.
He had never made Draco happy, only miserable.
Harry stood, holding his hands out. “Draco, please. It was my fault. Come here, come here, sweetheart—“

His shift at the hospital started in thirty minutes and he didn’t have much time to spare. He hoped this would be over quick.
They’d acquired a negative stigma after the War and the carnivores of the Wizarding World hadn’t forgotten the herbivores who so badly wanted things
As if conjured by his thoughts, Harry stepped up next to him, placing a large hand on his shoulder. “Go ahead, Draco. Sit down.”
Harry took a napkin from the table and gently wiped some of thrown food from Draco’s cheek, making his chest bloom with warmth at the affectionate gesture.
A pang of discomfort in Harry’s stomach made him pause.
“I can’t even be properly upset with you due to our bond,” he finished hollowly.
Draco felt resentment and longing burn deep inside him, Harry’s pheromones making his head fuzzy and light.
Hermione and Ron sat next to him on the lumpy sofa pictured, wearing wan smiles, their eyes bright with hope and possibility.
Draco loathed that look. He was tired of those inscrutable expressions. He would never give his pup that face, he would always be open and honest. Even if he didn’t want to be.
Harry cleared his throat, shooting Jack a withering look.

It was as good as being neutered. He felt like dog, a
“You know, you can make this simple or difficult, Draco. If you do as I want without putting up a fight, I’ll reward you. If you continue to defy me at every turn, I can make you suffer.”
His mother, Narcissa, still watched Juniper while he worked long shifts at St. Mungo’s, but he knew when his baby came, he’d have to rely even more on his parents’ help if Theo didn’t…
She grinned and pushed the present towards him. “Go on, then. Don’t make me beg. Open it up.”
In Harry’s presence, he felt unfamiliarly
Draco’s eyes shone, his throat visibly contracting.

Harry pinched Draco’s chin between his fingers, tipping his head up. “What is it?”
those words correctly, Mr. Potter?”

Draco spluttered. “Y-you are so

“Take your trousers down and get on your hands and knees.”
Draco thrashed in his hold, glaring up at Harry with undisguised malice. “I
He wanted them to move in with him so they could be a true family. It felt wrong that his mate and pup left him each morning. He wanted them in his home, where he could provide for them always.
He paused, the phial in his fingers, ready to let it spill over into the black marble basin below. The shallow basin swirled with wispy vestiges of memories long forgotten, beckoning him.
“What do you mean by that, Draco?” he asked carefully.
“I just need to…
”Why don’t you use complexion charms?” Draco asked softly.
Harry thought he had known happiness in its purest form at certain points in his life, but nothing compared to
Harry left him alone in the study, hugging himself and missing the familiar presence of his Alpha and their mating bond.
Hermione smiled and nodded.
he was a fool.
Would Harry notice? What if recognized...
“Hello again, Scorpius,” Harry cooed, offering him a tiny wave.
Hermione smiled down at Rose. “You can go say hi, but don’t bother him too much, darling.”
Draco giggled softly. “You’ve done it now. He loves when we play werewolves.”

Harry flicked his gaze over to her for only a moment before returning to Draco.
He knew it was insane to want such a thing from a man like
A small stoppered phial rolled out, landing in his open palm. A silvery thread of light was ensconced in the phial, shimmering as it undulated in its glass container.
It was all dreadfully bleak as of late.
for them.
for the boy. When he had smelled the scent of another Alpha on his sweet rabbit, he’d seen red. He admittedly overreacted, and his behavior was starting to become worrisome. He couldn’t become too attached to the boy.
His raven hair was pushed back from his face, his cheekbones two sharp slashes beneath his olive skin. His cheeks were covered in a few days’ worth of black stubble, giving him a rakish look.
Draco begging for the life of his mother, begging for the safety of their pup, begging for Harry to see things as they really
Arlen glanced up at Harry, giving him an indulgent smile. “I know it sounds concerning, Mr. Potter, but I assure you we’ll continue to monitor it closely.” Arlen pulled his wand away and murmured a cleaning charm, the gel and image of Draco’s jellybean disappearing.
After some coaxing and petting behind the ears, the rabbit allowed Harry to pick him back up.
to get to Draco.
“Oh, I almost forgot. I thought it would be fun to look at some old photos of us when we were younger. I’ll show you that Harry wasn’t always so serious-looking,” Hermione said, laughing softly.

He would be a slave to Harry.
Draco sighed, running a hand through his wayward hair. “I know, Pansy. It’s just been…difficult. Ever since Theo’s…disappearance, I haven’t been able to think about much except taking care of Juniper.”
Ya'll thought I was done?
The clock on the mantel in front of the portrait of Sirius wasn’t working, it’s hands forever frozen in place on the numerals they had stopped on. Draco felt a lot like the clock, hidden away in this room, hidden away in this
It was almost hypnotizing.
”Dada, Dada,
Harry remained stoic about it, refusing to broach the subject if Draco brought it up during their visits. He hadn’t realized how much he would miss Harry’s attention as an Alpha, but now that he was withholding his emotions from Draco, there was a void inside of Draco that
“Are you Potter’s new pet?” she asked in a cynical tone. “It’s all my owners have been blabbering about the past few weeks.”
Draco reared his hand back and slapped Harry across the face. It sounded deafening in the bathroom, accompanying a niggling ringing sound in Draco’s ears even though he wasn’t the one who had been slapped.
She was dressed in a grey, long-sleeved linen dress with a white apron over it. The thick black boots on her feet were splattered with dry mud. He realized she must be one of the servants.
“She’s with the neighbor, Mione. I thought it was best if she wasn’t home for this.”
Draco cut him off by reaching down between them and clumsily trying to undo his belt. When he was successful at that, he unzipped the front of his trousers and yanked down the front of Harry’s briefs, his erection springing out, the flushed head of his cock already leaking pre-cum.
Harry stood, his heart leaping in his chest. “Draco?”
“W-what’s going on? I came as soon as I could, but Draco’s condition still isn’t stable, and St Mungo’s told me—”
If Draco had trusted him enough to risk sharing this guarded secret, then Harry could be strong enough to view it.
“Look at me,” Harry ordered, his hips snapping forward to press his cock as deep as it would go in Draco’s mouth.
between us—it can be forgotten. We have to move on. For Scorpius.”
He roughly slammed him back against the wall, glaring down at him with undisguised hatred burning in his eyes.
Harry thought they had been making progress. After telling Harry his real name, Draco had seemed to be warming up to him enough to talk more. He only said a few words, but at least he was
A black riding crop was visible beneath his open jacket, hanging from the side of his tapered waist.
The boy’s face was pressed against his bare chest, a little dribble of saliva trickling from the side of his full, pink lips. His long, light eyelashes tickled Harry’s skin as his eyes moved restlessly beneath his lids. He murmured something and shifted on top of Harry, attempting to bury his small nose into Harry’s armpit.
The boy struggled fruitlessly against him, the tips of his long ears brushing against the underside of Harry’s jaw.
Maybe he thought he would try to escape? Maybe he

Draco huffed and turned to begin wiping food from Juni’s fingers with a washcloth he taken from the sink. “Well, I can’t Apparate while I’m pregnant, so it’s been difficult to lose you every time I notice you following me like some
“Good news? Ever since your existence was made known to me, it has been nothing but bad news for me and my family, Potter.”
Harry narrowed his eyes. “Tell me the truth, Draco. Are you nervous about tonight? I promise it’s just my closest friends.” He sighed, hugging Scorpius to his chest. “If you don’t want to go through with it, we can just tell them—”
Draco sucked in a sharp breath. “N-nothing, Harry. Just—Just about the baby.”
Draco let out a small whimper, bending in on himself.
. No one could ever hate you and if they did, I wouldn’t want them in my life. You and Scorpius will always be a part of my life and if someone can’t accept that, I wouldn’t accept
Draco swallowed thickly. “T-that’s ridiculous, Harry. I told you, I was in heat. I probably wasn’t making much sense at all last night, let alone enough sense to string together a sentence like that. There was nothing behind it.”
,” the man hissed.
The words felt brittle on his tongue, hollow and meaningless. It was as if he were being held together by rickety supports, the fastenings around his soul fraying and tenuous.
“Hope we’re together forever,” Draco mumbled against his lips, his eyes drifting closed. He turned his head, tucking Scorpius’ head underneath his chin as he settled in for sleep.
Harry dropped to his knees in front of Draco, his eyes riveted to his chest. “You’re so fucking…
The boy’s unique scent had been overpowering as he had sat next to him, even masking the scent of the roses that had surrounded them.
”Dada...”
Harry wedged himself between Draco’s legs, his erection pressing between his cheeks.
Draco’s throat suddenly felt tight.
Instincts and arousal controlling him, Draco tugged Harry’s head back up to take his mouth in a slow, languid kiss. Harry didn’t reciprocate, leaving Draco to clumsily lick and suck at his mouth, his inexperience painfully apparent.

not being able to be with you to help with your discomfort.”
Draco let out a relieved hiccup and burrowed closer, feeling some relief as Harry’s pheromones calmed him.
Ginny startled and turned, a sauce-covered utensil in her hand. “Harry!”

Harry pulled the boy back against him by his hips, his neglected cock pulsing with desire as the boy settled between his legs.

Harry cleared his throat, picking at his food with his fork. “I’m sorry, Draco. I didn’t mean to overstep. It’s entirely up you, whatever you want to do.”
His memories, his trauma, and his pain would still be there—
Harry made him feel like the lowest, most degraded piece of filth there ever was.
A mate meant emotions and emotions were terribly messy. Watching Ron act barbaric over Hermione during her pregnancy had put him off to the whole idea entirely.
If Draco’s scent had been overwhelming before, it was
He burrowed his tongue inside of that tight heat, curling and twisting it from side to side as far as he could reach. Excess slick poured from his hole and Harry eagerly lapped it up like a man possessed.
Potter gave a derisive snort, eyeing him speculatively.
Harry was what every Omega dreamed of in a mate: strong, attractive, and virile.
His ears still tingled from the boy’s touch. His tail was gently wagging behind him, but Harry grabbed it, digging his claws into his fur to stop it.
“I know how this must sound, Mione, but there’s…evidence. Along with Harry’s confession, Kreacher corroborated his story after Harry released him from his servitude to the Black family. Draco was not Harry’s mate; he was his prisoner.”
“He’s inside, Auror Potter. He’s been inside since yesterday. He hasn’t left, I’m sure of it. His mother took the baby and left two days ago. There hasn’t been anyone in or out.”
The command made Draco look up, meeting the man’s cold glare. “Why?”
Navigating through memories was extremely difficult. He had to get out of Narcissa’s memories and the only way to do it was—
The boy let out a cute sniffle, playfully nipping at one of Harry’s nipples.
His father. Lucius.
He hoped that Harry’s seed hadn’t took. He hoped that his seed
”Yes. There’s something else we found, well, erm,

Sirius remained silent, that same taciturn look smoothing his features into one of indifference.
When the mare gave a soft snuffle and shook her head, Draco giggled.
Every inch of his skin had been covered in Harry’s cum and pheromones. It was almost like Harry had left him a humiliating message:

Harry turned, giving Ron a quizzical look. “Underage magic?”

In the mornings when he would wake up, covered in Harry scent and cum, his pup growing inside of his womb, he would become hopelessly depressed.

the boy.
,” he stammered weakly.
A small nudge against his stomach from his pup reminded him of why he had wanted to sit down with Hermione. Harry had gone to the Ministry that day for some unknown reason and Hermione had stopped by to keep him company.
He looked furious.
As if he didn’t have enough to worry about, now he had a hefty dose of
“S-sorry!” Draco stammered, trying to cover his chest with his free arm. “I haven’t nursed all day and I start to leak if I don’t let him feed regularly throughout the day.”
Harry stood up straight, his brows drawing together. “You’re staying with Lucius? Is Draco doing all right?”
Draco sighed, shoving his freezing hands into the pockets of his jacket.
”I’ll try my best, Hermione.”
Roland had graduated from Hogwarts several years before him. They had sorted him into Slytherin and he came from a long line of pure-blooded witches and wizards.
He nudged at the rabbit with nose after finishing cleaning his top, wanting to get to his lower half.
Harry chuckled softly. “I forgot about that. I barely remember what was said that night.”
The slick leaking from the boy’s hole paired with the water, easing the glide and making his rabbit emit needy sounds as Harry leisurely fucked between his cheeks.
She let out a delicate snort. “I suppose. Between my job and Rose graduating from Hogwarts, I haven’t had much time to myself lately. But anyway, how are you doing? How are you
Scorpius giggled and reached for Harry, making frustrated noises when he realized Draco wouldn’t put him down.
“No,” Harry whispered. “I’m not angry with you, Draco. I was at first, but I know you were scared. Seeing you with Scorpius these past few weeks and being with you both...I couldn’t have asked for a better mother for him. I’m tired of denying us both. Even though you hurt me, Draco, I
But Draco
His Alpha was angry with him. If he was angry, he wouldn’t fuck him.
It was the most erotic sight Harry had ever seen.
A hot trickle of blood slid down the side of Draco’s throat, becoming trapped under his collar. Harry pulled back and lapped at the droplets of blood, the chemicals in his saliva closing the wound as he laved it with his tongue.
“I do understand. There are a lot of things I

“For fuck’s sake, that means

”Of course,” Draco said softly, stepping closer to him. “Anything.”
from you. I want to go with Hermione. I want an Alpha who cares for me and my pup,” Draco whispered, unable to stop his tears from falling now.
Draco had made a mistake. He knew he had made a mistake.
Narcissa’s pupils burst at the edges, becoming an obsidian vortex that sucked Harry in and covered his own vision in a miasma of suffocating black. The black slowly bled into flashing colors: gray, white, and then the colors slowly took shape.
“I love you,” he whispered, making Harry’s heart soar and his cock
Draco startled and stepped back, fearing corporal reprimand.
“I’d forgotten what it was like. Christmas when you were still a student at Hogwarts, I mean.”
Draco and Harry didn’t speak for a beat.
When they reached a lower level, Harry steered Draco into a kitchen.
“He looks so much like you, Harry. He even has your eyes,” Hermione said, holding Scorpius close to her. “I love when they’re this young. So cuddly.”
Scorpius clapped his chubby hands and babbled happily, some words more coherent than others.
Standing under Jack’s arm was Draco Malfoy.
Draco flinched, realizing that his still wet hair was indeed dripping water.
Fuck their differences. Fuck societal rules. Fuck their
“Harry?”
After graduating from Hogwarts, he’d focused solely on his career.
He reached down and cupped Draco under his arms, pulling him back up to the sofa. He helped him lay down on his back and got to his knees overtop him, his heavy erection bobbing as he repositioned them both.
He was restless, pacing in front of the sofa.
Draco startled and stumbled backward.

His mother never allowed him to see any pictures of him growing up, but he could see the resemblance in himself.
“Here you are, Draco.”

Draco keened, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck and trying to tug him closer to him.
Harry nuzzled his lips against the dripping bud, tasting Draco’s sweet breast milk on his tongue and lips. “So
He looked up, determination settling over him.
“Me too,” he answered quietly.
When Kingsley had stepped down, the new Minister of Magic had begun to rectify his mistakes. The first thing she’d done was repeal the barbaric breeding law.
Harry couldn’t remember crossing the room, but he was suddenly on the bed and pulling Draco into his arms. As he pulled the boy up, two trickles of milk leaked from his swollen nipples and slid down his abdomen.
Some features were similar and some different. His father’s short white-blond hair was the same as his, but Lucius had an aquiline nose rather than a pert one like Draco had inherited from his mother. His eyes were the same shape and color as his father’s, but that was where the similarities ended.
mate and no one else’s.
”Have you thought of any names?”
“Like that, do you?” Harry murmured, holding the boy tighter against him.
Harry wasn’t providing him any. Perhaps he never would as a mate.
Surrounded by his Alpha’s scent, he would sit on the black leather chesterfield sofa and read through one of Harry’s novels. The antique grandfather clock in the corner of the office was charmed, the face changing from a bright morning sky to starlit night depending on the time of day. The steady tick of the pendulum within marked the passage of time while he lounged in the office, lulling him to sleep one evening as he read.
Draco flushed, wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist for support. “I…I-I

“Just wallowing in his own self-hatred,” Theo bit out. “April is approaching. You know how he gets.”
Although Harry had to feel their pup’s kicks in reaction to his touch, he never reacted to it.
It had to be fixed from within first.

But Harry didn’t care. He just wanted the boy to be drenched in his fluids, inside and
Draco cast an apprehensive glance at the open double doors again, waiting for his mother to come back in. They were seated in the parlor at Malfoy Manor.
Harry clenched his jaw and nodded. “It can wait. Do you mind if I come with you to get Scorpius?”
Even though the thought of Harry fucking him made him recoil with disgust, his body anticipated it. He was an Omega, and his body naturally yearned for an Alpha’s attention.
dragging down his image and putting a damper on his life.
At night, he would take a Dreamless Sleep potion, trying to escape the incessant thoughts and urgent need that all centered around his captive Omega.
, boy.” Harry folded himself over Draco’s struggling form and sank his teeth into his scent gland on the side of his neck.
When he had explained why he was weaning his pup, Harry had felt a surge of anger towards Lucius for even suggesting he quit breastfeeding Scorpius.
Harry turned to look at Draco, a compendium of emotions shining in his emerald gaze that had Draco’s heartbeat quickening again, but anxiety was the furthest reason why.
to anyone who will listen?”
”Do you intend to bludgeon me to death, Draco? By all means, have at it.”
Draco smiled and laid back on the bed, pulling Harry overtop him. He had a blissed out expression on his face.
“I’ll stay,” he whispered, pressing a quick kiss to Harry’s lips. He then hugged his arms around Harry’s neck, nuzzling his throat and kissing his scent gland.
infuriating your father? Don’t tempt me, sweetheart.”
Draco could see it now: Harry’s respected reputation dragged through the dirt and his father looking at him with nothing but familiar disappointment…
(I’m sorry, but I’m in love with the Harry I’ve written in this story. He’s so...ARF ARF BARK BARK. 😏)
It was either his revenge or Draco.
Hermione pulled a stack of photos from her bag, setting them on her lap. “Well, knowing what your mother has been through, I’m not surprised she wanted to you to remain hidden. I suppose I understand her need to protect you from certain things, being a mother myself.”
The boy’s pleas seemed to reverberate throughout his fucking skull, coaxing him even from such a distance.
woman. You have no idea how obstinate you sound, protecting that wretch of a woman.”
The smell of Draco’s cum, slick, and breast milk permeated the air around him, an intoxicating scent that had Harry tenting his trousers.
“Y-you said your girlfriend is in Romania visiting her brother. What does she do for work?” Draco asked, mentally chastising himself.
in Harry’s green gaze, but it was gone before he could decipher what exactly it was.
Harry did come back one night, however.
Draco was loath to admit that the cruel man was roguishly handsome. His hard features and imposing presence
Draco released a strangled whimper, feeling as if his insides were being rent apart by the dildo.

“If you
Draco wrapped his arms around himself, letting his tears finally fall, quietly sniffling.
He walked over and climbed beside him on the bed, pulling his back against his chest. He whispered a cleaning charm, the boy’s sweet-smelling slick and cum disappearing.
speak properly.”
Harry seemed relaxed, having already had a few drinks of Firewhisky with Ron. Draco couldn’t stop stealing glances at him, averting his gaze when Harry would catch him staring.
Draco shook his head, biting his lower lip between his teeth to stave off anymore embarrassing sounds from leaving his throat.
Draco looked up Harry, flushing under his intense gaze. He knew that Harry was upset, his anger being stoked by Draco’s alleged flirtations with Arlen.
“You shouldn’t listen to him, Draco. You’re nothing like him. You’re a wonderful mother and a good person.”
“No one had been home, but his wife, Narcissa, decided to report it to us. I think she’s being cautious because their son has a baby living there with him.”
Omega. I’ll touch you whenever I please.”
Draco whimpered. ”Stop it, I know what you’re doing—“
“Come here, baby. Let Dada kiss it better. He’s sorry, baby,” Harry cooed, holding out his arms.
Harry grabbed the bottom of Draco’s pyjama top and tugged. “Take this off. Let me see,” he demanded.
“That doesn’t make me hate you any less,” Draco said icily, still not looking at him.
When he would take in the familiar dark décor and soft black sheets beneath him, dread would skitter up his spine, quick and sinister.
Draco bristled, not liking being ordered around like a dog.
“What in Salazar’s name are you doing here?” Draco hissed.
The most recent memory in Harry’s mind was of Draco on the floor in front of him. He saw himself, a cruel smile on his face as he held Draco’s head up by his hair.
He found a secluded area in the middle of the garden where a short tree provided some shade. His mother’s pale pink Constance Spry roses were in full bloom, threaded throughout the wrought-iron fence that bordered the garden. They emitted a lovely myrrh fragrance, calming Draco’s frayed nerves.
, Draco. I want to be with you.”
“Come on, baby, come for
Harry felt a growl trying to claw its way up his throat, his hands tightening into fists against his thighs.
Would that be his last memory of him?
Draco looked up at him with bemusement. “That wasn’t nice, Harry.”
Draco shot him a baleful look, his eyes brimming with tears. “Don’t.”
Harry barely restrained a groan, shifting Draco on his lap so that he couldn’t feel his erection prodding his arse. “You mean, you want me to…spit on them?”
Draco had let out a whine, shifting restlessly on the bed, seeking out more of Harry’s comforting licks.
He didn’t turn around, hearing Harry stand and walk over to him.
Draco continued pressing soft kisses down Harry’s throat, stopping to briefly nuzzle his scent gland.
Harry’s whole body was taut, his full lips clamped shut as. Draco nibbled at his skin. The salt from his tears flavored each kiss, making Draco’s chapped lips burn in a delicious sort of way.
“My home?” Draco asked dazedly.
Even though he was able to resist calling out for Harry, his body was emitting pheromones against his will in heavy, hot waves. His body was calling out to his Alpha— soundlessly
Harry picked up his pace, delivering brutal slams of his cock into Draco’s hole, his slicked channel gripping Harry with unrelenting pleasure.
Harry playfully nipped at the air in front of her elbow, earning high-pitched squeal from Rose.
Herbivores were steadily taking the place of house-elves and he didn’t know how to feel about that.
“Well, I already love him,” Hermione cooed, smoothing back some of Scorpius’ blond hair as he finally shut his eyes and succumbed to sleep against her chest.
“I know, love, but you’ll have to learn that magic isn’t supposed to be abused. Magic is supposed to be used for
He left, walking down the corridor quicker than necessary.
He no longer attempted to use his magic. The collar proved to be a strong magical deterrent, too advanced for him to try to figure out on his own.

Draco gritted his teeth, tired of everyone around him treating him as if he were made of glass. His parents had wanted him to move back into Malfoy Manor at first, but he had vehemently refused.

A week went by and the rabbit still hadn’t changed back.
”Are you even going to tell me how you got in?”
“You know you have to be careful, Jellybean. We don’t want a repeat of the waterpark fiasco.”
Draco’s face flamed, shaking his head. “Why should I?”
Alpha’s scent.
”Take my knot, sweetheart, take it
Draco didn’t want to push her into speaking again, so he didn’t try to coax words out of her. He knew she would speak when she was ready.
No, he couldn’t let the media outlets find out about Harry and him.
The past eight months he’d been fighting what he was feeling, and now…
His words were cut off when Harry put the tips of his fingers in his warm mouth, licking around his fingertips. His warm, wet tongue against Draco’s cold skin sent a bolt of desire straight to his prick, emitting a tiny whimper as Harry languidly sucked.
He looked down at Scorpius, smiling softly. His mother had dressed his pup in a small, white short-sleeved button-down with a plethora of dinosaurs adorning the entirety of it. His blond hair was getting longer, curling slightly at the ends around his small ears.
A small white poof was at the base of the boy’s spine, directly above his arse. His tail.
Maybe one day she would understand, but not now.
This was his fault.
It was dark out now, silvery moonlight spilling across the manor’s triangular rooftops and pristinely manicured lawn.
Harry liked that idea,
“Get on your knees.”
“It’s because of you, you know.”
Unable to help himself, he began to fantasize that the dildo was Harry, his large cock splitting him open as he snapped his hips in and out. The fantasy seemed to lessen his discomfort, slick gushing out of his hole and covering his trembling fingers and the dildo.
“You don’t have to look so disgusted,” Harry said gruffly, tightening his arms around him.
“Promise?” Harry asked, letting his rough pad of his thumb rub over Draco’s lower lip.
“Mum started giving me suppressants early on. My heats can get...overwhelming.”
His body
“Why in Salazar’s name did they send
It was embarrassing to Draco. He didn’t want to rely on some strange alpha for such an intimate thing. He had only been with one man his entire life and couldn’t imagine letting some stranger put their hands on him.
He knew that as an Omega in heat, nothing would be able to satisfy him except his Alpha’s cock sliding against his inner channel, those veins and ridges catching against every euphoric spot inside of him that incessantly burned with hot
Unable to help himself, Harry pulled the boy closer to him. “It’s not off-putting
Surely his Alpha wasn’t letting his lovely breasts become painfully swollen with milk?
Draco pulled back to whine, “Harry, I-I need—”
“Forget about it,” Harry bit out. “I’m taking you home.”
Hermione must have noticed, placing one of her warm hands on his shoulders.
Harry released his hold on the boy’s wrist and slid two of his own fingers into Draco’s stretched hole, curling them alongside Draco’s own fingers inside of his wet heat.
Harry was next to him on the sofa, staring straight ahead. His arms were stretched out on the back of the sofa, his legs lazily spread. He knew that Harry had a few drinks in him, too, and his demeanor was much more relaxed than usual.
When he began pumping his finger in and out of his rabbit’s tight hole, the boy’s eyes popped open, meeting Harry’s when he looked down with a gasp.
His heart clenched, guilt roiling within him.
Maybe even lower.
“You know, I really need to give you a name. Unless...you want to
Draco had fortunately not come into contact with the manor’s cruel master again. Their first meeting had left him unnerved.
Potter leaned back, his eyes widening fractionally as his nostrils flared, presumedly scenting Draco’s mortifying arousal.
The boy whimpered, trying to pull away.
Draco wanted to scream. Well, scream or cry, he wasn’t quite sure.
When he felt Potter’s large hand come down on his backside with a resounding crack, Draco let out a strangled whine, biting down on the glove clenched between his teeth.
He’d decided to retire five years ago, choosing instead to finally pursue his dreams of becoming an author.
Apparently, the low number of magical pregnancies in the past five years was beginning to become a growing concern for the Ministry.
Draco set down the potatoes and looked where she pointed, spotting a row of unopened wine bottles on the counter. He went over and picked one up.
Frustrated tears pricked Draco’s eyes. “You are not the only one who was left with scars, Harry.”
He had been just a boy back then, only seventeen.
“I don’t know,” Draco answered, his voice sounding breathy.
”May I have my kiss now?” Harry husked, his eyes flitting down to Draco’s lips.

”Don’t pick an alpha yet. I’d have to clear anyone you pick, anyway. For safety reasons, of course. Just—wait.”
to read a sodding book about his own anatomy, but he couldn’t let it get to him too much.
The boy shook his head, blushing.
Harry trailed behind the young man, his faux smile slipping from his lips.
The flames licked at all of his erogenous zones: his pert nipples, his swollen lips, his aching cock, and his
Harry had thought it was his instincts pushing him towards the boy, but he realized it wasn’t that at all.
Draco wanted to ask who Voldemort was, but there was one thing he wanted to ask about above all else.
“I-It’s normal. I read about it. It’s not because of you or anything,” he whispered.
After standing there for a moment, trembling and trying to accept the fact that he may have made a horrible mistake, he raised his head, his eyes narrowing.
Harry released his nipple and lowered his head, sticking out his tongue to softly lap at the swollen nub. Draco whimpered, the sensations of Harry’s tongue and his dark hair brushing against the sensitive skin of his chest overwhelming him.
But there were flashes of himself inherent in her too. One of the biggest traits being her ability to easily forgive.

Harry’s face became shuttered of all emotion, his green eyes frosting over. “
“I understand, Harry,” he said softly, Harry’s commanding tone quieting the doubts that always seemed to loop in his mind whenever they were together.
by your doting parents.”
The small rabbit had fallen asleep in his arms on the way home, so he had placed him in the cage atop a small pillow he had found in one of his closets.
Hermione cleared her throat, breaking Harry from his thoughts.
“You have to hurry, or he’ll be cross that I didn’t bring you quick enough,” she breathed, grabbing his forearm and tugging him towards the door.
“I-I want you, too, Harry,” Draco whispered, lowering one his hands to sift his fingers through Harry’s thick black hair.
He didn’t touch Draco. He didn’t speak to him. He didn’t
He would do anything for any children he was able to grow inside of him. His Omega nature would make him immediately love it and want to protect it.

Harry shook his head. “No, no. Go sit down with Scorpius and I’ll serve you both.”
Once he had emptied himself completely inside of Draco, Harry gently pulled out of him, his cum and Draco’s excess slick gushing out and soaking the sheets beneath his hips.
“What kind of friend?”

He grabbed Draco’s throat above his collar, pressing down. “I didn’t
Harry set down case file he had been reviewing, quirking up a brow. “What do you need, Jack?”
Harry sat in his office at the Ministry of Magic.
Harry’s little rabbit had been hiding from him since he had changed back that morning.
Draco was rendered momentarily mute, unsure of just what to say.

Harry stiffened.
Fuck meant copulation, but toy? Like a
Harry stopped sucking and began kissing down his chest, halting when his lips reached his stomach. He pulled back; his black hair mussed from Draco’s fingers. His intense gaze was almost
Potter dragged him outside by the arm and he struggled to remain upright, his traitorous body still trying to catch up to his mind.
“You don’t have a choice in this—” Harry said roughly, attempting to place a hand on Draco’s waist to pull him back. Harry had reached down just as Draco had turned, his large hand ending up on his bump.
Harry felt a curl of anticipation in his lower stomach.
His revenge was still a barely stoked ember inside of his heart, but for the life of him, he couldn’t incite it.
Draco was crying, hot tears sliding down his cheeks and sticking to his blond lashes. “I-I don’t belong to you,” he sobbed brokenly.
He gave Harry a small smile and nodded. “Okay, Harry. I understand.”
Harry arched one dark brow, smirking down at him.
It was almost too much, the sight of his Omega wet and tight around him, begging to be fucked. Harry let out a low growl and gave a brutal thrust, the small sofa jarring with the harsh movement.
, but he was unable to repress it.
“Draco?”
Did that mean he’d been watching him all day?
“G-get off me!” Draco shouted, struggling against his hold and huffing in frustration. “Arlen is gone, so we can stop
Harry’s hands traveled down to Draco’s hips, rucking up his jumper and digging his thumbs into his hip bones. Draco eagerly pressed his chest to his, slick starting to leak from his hole due to his Alpha’s attention.
It would make sense for him to choose Roland to be his alpha substitute for the duration of his pregnancy.
Arlen let go of Draco and stepped back. “It’s no trouble at all, Draco. Take care of yourself and I’ll see you at your next appointment. It won’t be long now until you’re holding your pup in your arms.”
Harry sat next to Draco, making sure there was a sufficient amount of space between them that would be deemed appropriate. He tucked his notepad away and faced him.
would you believe it if I told you I listened to Christmas music while writing this chapter? 😏
“I thought that was you. Almost didn’t recognize you. How are you doing?”
Harry viewed Malfoy Manor as a gaudy Gothic tribute to the Malfoy family’s namesake, a stone erection that bespoke Pure-blooded superiority.
He smiled and pulled the boy closer, nuzzling into his hair, inhaling.
His white-blond hair was soaked from the rain and his pale skin looked ashen.
Narcissa was staring at Draco, her full lips pressed into a thin line. He knew that his mother could see beneath his façade.
Draco looked back to Potter’s retreating form. When the grey moors swallowed his figure from view, Draco realized he still held Potter’s glove in his trembling hand.
Ginny giggled softly and her pressed closer to him, her arm touching his.
Perhaps a cantankerous old man with grey hair and a distended stomach, but this man wasn’t
Harry glanced over at Ginny, who was walking next to him. Snowflakes were interspersed throughout her red hair, her pale cheeks flushed from the cold.
He dusted off the front his trousers, already used to wearing soiled clothing from all the cleaning he had been assigned to do.  The smell of soap and other cleaning chemicals seemed to cling to him, even if he washed himself off each evening before bed.
Draco gasped, arching up. “
Harry sighed and helped the boy to his feet. “I suppose we can work on that.”
Harry was trying to force him to be his mate, force him to carry his child. It was all so fucked, and Draco let out strangled sob, his eyes filling with unshed tears.
How badly he had wanted to pull Draco into his arms and comfort him even back then.
“How is he doing with sleeping at night?” Harry asked, pressing one last kiss to the tip of Scorpius’ nose as he attempted to wriggle away. He walked over to where Draco stood wringing his hands.
While Roland was classically handsome with perfectly acceptable manners and an impeccable magical background, he was…
When his jellybean remained still inside of him, he turned off the water to the shower and pulled back the curtain.
He knew he had to get a grip on his self-control, but with each passing day, it seemed as if his grip only loosened.
Harry’s familiar term of endearment for him made him whimper, sucking more of Harry’s length into his awaiting mouth. Before long, he was bobbing his mouth on Harry prick, his own saliva sluicing from the sides of his lips.
Harry pinched his leaking nipple between his thumb and forefinger, making milk spurt out.
And when he would look up Harry from under his lashes with those startingly silver eyes, putting all of his vulnerability into those pale gray depths…
After he had come, he had been disgusted with himself. He’d let his baser urges take over and for none other than the bastard child of Lucius Malfoy.
Draco burrowed further underneath his covers, screwing his eyes shut in frustration.
“I am, too,” Draco said coyly, reaching up to swipe up some syrup that had landed next to Harry’s dark nipple. He popped his finger into his mouth and sucked, holding Harry’s gaze.
...hurt.
? What did that mean?
“I suppose I want some closure. If I told you I was completely healed from what he did to me, it would be a lie, Hermione. I guess…I just want to see if my memories reflect the man who held me captive all those years ago. If he’s still as…”
Draco felt numb as he slowly ripped open the yellow wrapping paper. He opened the small box revealed under the paper with stiff fingers, going silent upon seeing what was inside. He reached in and lifted it up.
Something inside of him was screaming
The house-elf, Kreacher, had given him a thin pair of white pyjama bottoms to wear, but nothing else. After Kreacher would escort him to the loo and try to coax him to eat, he would use his magic to tie him to the bed again.
Draco let out a choked whine and lunged at Harry.
He had to survive Harry. He had to do as he wished.
. He smiled, lifting one of his hands to smooth back some of Draco’s sweaty hair.
Harry grinned and stood, watching as the effervescent child disappeared around the corner.
But what if they missed something? What if Draco and his pup were caught unaware one night, all alone in that large mansion? Without his Alpha there to protect him, Draco would be a sitting duck, a vulnerable Omega, still lactating for his young pup.
His small, leaking hole looked irritated from his claw, the rim slightly reddened. Clear slick seeped from his hole, trailing down his inner thighs. Droplets of water clung to his twitching tail, his tight, pink sac drawn up below his tiny, leaking Omega prick.
”What else are they good for? They’ve no way to defend themselves and most of them were forced into labor or subservient roles after the War anyway.”
me and depriving me of my
Draco glanced at Harry, noting his rigid posture and clenched hands. Even though he was scared, he knew Harry wouldn’t hurt him. He was his Omega, and an Alpha was instinctually wired to treat their Omega with care.
Harry stood and walked over to their side of the table, holding his arms out. “Please, Draco. I don’t mind at all.”
Draco quickly took both ends of his gaping shirt and pulled them together with his free hand.
Draco’s begging made the Alpha within him snarl with desire, tearing and clawing at his mind in an attempt to rend his self-control apart.
Draco
“Show me.”
“I wanted to protect my baby from Lucius. Don’t you see? I live with what I have done
Harry loosened his hold enough to allow Draco some air. He sucked in a deep mouthful of oxygen, a choked sob escaping him.
Harry took pity on his rabbit, running one of his claws against the velvet edge of one of the boy’s ears. “Dada isn’t cross with you with, sweetheart. It’s just bath time.”
Arlen shook his head, crossing his arms over his chest. “No. I don’t want to see him. I read about what he did to you, Draco, and the Ministry gave me enough information to make me sick.” He paused, sighing before continuing. “Listen, everything you had to endure during your pregnancy—”
,” he barreled on, ignoring Draco gaping at him. “I have a job to do, and I intend to see it through. That means you’re under
“Is the pup okay?” Harry boldly slid his hand up to Draco’s covered stomach. “I’m taking you home to rest—”
Even though Draco continued to spread his legs for his Alpha that night, in the back of his mind, there was a niggling feeling of
callous man as their only intimate company—
He hated what
“Let me,” he said, stepping toward him until they were uncomfortably close again. Harry pulled his wand from a hidden pocket in his jacket and aimed it at Draco’s clothes.
Draco giggled, feeling the soft bed beneath his back as Harry gently laid him down. He turned to his side, seeing Scorpius sleeping soundly next to him.
Harry’s heart tripped.
Draco had never even been
Harry had begun coming to his room regularly at night.
“You’re pregnant?” Harry rasped.
Harry searched his eyes with his own, leaning down until their breath intermingled. The scent of Firewhisky was evident on his breath and Draco wanted to
”Please, no, Harry,” he begged. “I’ll be good. I’ll do what you want.”
spot deep inside of him. “Are you sure? Look how loose you’re becoming, so stretched and hot around me.”
Draco’s lips parted in shock.
And who else would do it but his owner?
The surrounding sounds of the city and the people seemed to disappear, a dull roaring noise edging towards a crescendo in Draco’s ears.
Draco grinned, cupping his small bump with one hand. “Scratch that, make that
His rabbit’s breathing picked up, his arm speeding its movements.
you?” he scoffed, “you need my touch, Draco. Don’t be obstinate.”
Draco stopped reading for a moment, blinking rapidly as he realized that he had begun to cry. His tears fell to the parchment, smearing some of Hermione’s finely written words. He swiped at his eyes with the back of his hand, continuing to read on.
“Don’t put yourself in unnecessary danger,” he said instead. “You were right to come to me. I can protect you both. You can trust me.”
“All right, then. I suppose I should stop in and check on your father. I’ll be back later tonight. If you need me, Draco, just come by Floo.”
He held the photo out in front of him, dangling it between his fingertips. The photo ignited at one corner, flames beginning to devour it whole. Draco’s angelic face disappeared from view as the fire consumed.
“Please, Draco. Call me Harry.”
“If you’re in there, I’m sorry, baby. Your father is a horrible man and I’m...”
Draco’s mother, Narcissa, stood on the other side of their kitchen island, her blue eyes narrowed with concern.
The smell was coming from the lone bundle.
that it would have alerted Hermione to anything out of the ordinary when it came to Draco and their visits over the past few months.
Something that was so
!” Draco shouted, pushing away from him.
He didn’t want anyone else.
Draco’s heart felt too full at that moment, his adoration for his Alpha spilling over and traveling throughout him. It warmed him from the inside, the Firewhisky he’d consumed only heightening the effect and making him ache for Harry.
, I’m just saying—"
“One drink won’t hurt, Harry,” Draco mumbled, not backing down. “He’s already sleeping, anyway.”
An Alpha was supposed to be in constant contact with his Omega during pregnancy. Praise and physical touch were encouraged.
“You’re so perfect for me, sweetheart,” Harry panted, driving his cock into Draco’s hole as he chased his own orgasm. “Fucking beautiful and all
Draco set the lunch container he had brought on the floor by his feet and turned to face him, giving him a shy smile.
It held detained suspects that were awaiting trial and also kept convicted witches and wizards who were awaiting transportation to Azkaban. It was heavily guarded. Two Watchwizards standing guard at the entrance gates hastily stepped aside when they saw Harry and Ron striding towards them.
He rearranged them on the bed so that they were both laying on their sides, Draco’s back to Harry’s chest.

Draco was stymied, frozen in place. He was unable to process that the portrait was actually
Draco shivered, not liking the strange man’s lips against his ear. It didn’t feel like when his dada touched him. It felt…
Harry knew his Omega had ruined all others for him. It was hopeless.
As Harry watched the memory play out, he
He was beginning to realize that their bond was formed through heartache and pain, and Draco had become conditioned to respond to Harry’s cruel treatment.
The only light being emitted in the room was a small fire that was lit in the fireplace behind the desk, lining the man’s distinguished profile in a reddish glow. He turned slightly, his eyes briefly flickering over Draco before returning to stare across the room at nothing.
Harry grinned and lovingly smoothed back some of Draco’s sweaty hair.
Harry shook his head, inwardly fighting his instinctual need to dominant the small Omega.
”Alas, I’ll have to operate another day,” Harry sighed exaggeratedly, placing Rose on her feet.
His friend was telling the truth, though.
Jack stared at him for a moment, crossing his arms over his chest. “The kid with the baby whose home we had been surveilling. He stopped by today. Gave me something to give to you.”
He pulled his fingers out of his mouth, a thin trail of diaphanous saliva still connecting them before he flicked out his tongue to lick it up.
Their combined pheromones were drenching the air around them, making Harry feel as if he were
Draco nodded, his eyes still on their hands over his bump. “Yes. I haven’t felt them move in a while and I was beginning to think…”
something
Draco released a shuddering breath before responding. “It upset me because I wondered what the hell happened to you. You were happy in the photo, I could tell.”
Upon pulling off the thick covering, he had been met with a dark, haunted gaze.
Roland’s eyes widened in what looked like horror before he gave a sharp nod. “Of course, Draco. I’ll wait for your return.”
The sodding house-elf had allowed him to take a shower the day before, supervising his every move. When he’d been brought back to his room, he’d been denied clothes.
“Has Potter broken you in yet? Have you gone into heat while under his care,
Draco shook his head, his tears falling endlessly now. “It’s not that, Harry. You don’t understand. Your life is so…
The sight was sweetly innocent yet obscenely erotic to Harry.
Draco arched his back, his scut meeting Harry’s coarse pubic hair when he was finally fully sheathed within his rabbit.
Draco looked up and hiccupped softly before throwing himself forward and wrapping his arms around Pansy.
Draco’s brows drew together in confusion. “To my

The collar around his neck wasn’t heavy, but he could feel it steadily draining his inherent magic.

When Draco licked his suddenly dry lips, Potter’s eyes tracked the movement.  He could feel a flush crawling up his neck and blooming hotly over his cheeks.

ache for you?”
Harry reached into the pocket of his black blazer and retrieved a slim collar. He clamped it around Draco’s slender neck, giving it a experimental tug from behind.
When Draco had been spread out beneath him, his lids lowered to half-mast over his sultry gray eyes, begging for Harry to bite him while his cock had been sheathed inside of his beautiful Omega…
Harry froze, stilling his finger in the boy’s tight hole.

“Still as sweet as I remembered.”
Harry cleared his throat, drawing Draco’s attention back to where he was seated.
Harry gave a derisive snort, flicking his cigarette ash into the crystal ashtray on the table in front of him.
Draco Malfoy’s mother, Narcissa Malfoy, forcibly shoved his arms into the sleeves of his jacket, her movements fast and jerky.
Draco tried pushing away from him with his hand. “If you keep doing that, I’ll c-come. Stop,
Potter Manor was located in the Yorkshire Moors in England, away from virtually everything else, it seemed.
”So wet,” Harry hissed, sinking two of his fingers in.
Harry was sleeping soundly next to him, his arm curled protectively around the swell of Draco’s belly. Their pup bounced around in his stomach, blissfully unaware of what kind of person their father was.
Maybe he was predictable.
Cross-breeding had happened in the past and to this day, but it was now considered explicitly taboo.
The room it was kept in held a number of confiscated magical baubles, weapons, and artefacts that the Ministry had acquired over the years.
—I can’t see you like that.”

Harry returned his smile, scooting a little closer to him on the bench.
“Werewolf!” Scorpius squealed, reaching for Harry.
“Dada...” Draco whined, rubbing his cheek against his stuffed wolf.
