Snape glared at Harry, but Harry didn’t turn his gaze away. “You’re so much like your father, so arrogant, so full of yourself. He also cared only for himself and look what happened to him.”
“Actually, I could come too,” Ron said, irritated, as he got up off the couch.
Harry didn’t seem to be alone with his thoughts as most of the eight-years seemed to go home or somewhere else on weekends if they only had the chance. Harry had also started to consider going to his own flat in London at least for one weekend, but as if reading Harry’s thoughts, Molly had decided to invite Harry, Ron, and Hermione to visit at the Burrow over the weekend at the end of October. A day after that Andromeda had owled Harry and asked him to visit her and Teddy, and so Harry got a chance for a much-needed break from the castle. At first, though, Harry had thought he would skip visiting Andromeda and Teddy as he knew Draco would be staying there as well, but when Draco had reassured him it would be completely fine with him if Harry stayed at Andromeda’s too, he had decided to sleep one night at the Burrow and one at Andromeda’s.
Draco didn’t answer anything. Instead, he turned his gaze back at Harry, giving him a hesitant look.
“Not so fast, Draco,” Snape snapped. “You must have already heard from Potter what we’re doing here anyway. He actually just showed me some rather interesting images of you two.”
Harry waved at Ginny and left hastily, not wanting to be called back by anyone. As soon as Harry was out of the Burrow’s wards, he Apparated to his own living room and slumped straight on the couch.
As if getting angry because someone had thought it to be ‘just a could’, the green stripe got brighter and faster, starting to wave slightly as it moved forward. Little by little, more and more stripes appeared in the sky, filling the sky with green, red, and purple as they made their way through it, some of them going almost straight, some making curves, and some making even some odd circle-like forms.
“Harry!” Myrtle cried, surprised, but both Harry and Draco ignored her.
Draco was completely lost, not at all aware of his surroundings. When Draco arrived at a bridge that crossed over the Thames, he stopped in the middle of it. As Draco looked at the river flowing slowly underneath, he felt like his mind came back to his body, bit by bit. He had even forgotten he was crying, but now he could feel warm tears running down his face and see them fall down into the river. Suddenly, Draco had to gasp for air as the realization of what had just happened hit him. He had just been disowned. He was no longer regarded as his parents’ son.
“Well, yeah, I – I just don’t think there’s anything between us. At least nothing more than a friendship.”
Harry looked like an utter wreck. His clothes were dirty and torn, his hair was even messier than usual, his eyes were red and swollen, and he was shaking violently. He looked so small and weak as he stood there, shoulders drooping and arms folded across the chest.
“So, you were studying Arithmancy? Would you like to study together in the common room? I haven’t done the homework for Thursday yet, it’d be nice to have someone to compare the results with.”
“If you don’t want to save yourself for your own sake, do it at least for your mother’s.”
“Oh, so a couple of Death Eaters just took a hold of you and kept you still while Voldemort printed the Dark Mark on your arm?” Harry asked, making Draco flinch and look panicky around to make sure there were no eavesdroppers.
Harry snorted. At this point he was ready to do almost anything just to irritate Snape as much as possible, so he closed the door after him again and walked to Snape’s desk, only to find out the odd light coming from a Pensieve.
“Malfoy, we really should go now.”
“Harry, please, could you just listen to me for a moment?” Draco asked, sounding devastated.
“Let’s just walk around the courtyard?” Harry proposed, and Ginny nodded curtly at him.
Potter drew his mouth into a thin line, marched to the bathroom, and opened the faucet to let the water run into the bathtub.
“How can you know all this?” Harry asked, still surprised about how much knowledge his friend’s brain was able to hold.
Ginny looked at Harry, narrowing her eyes suspiciously. “Of course,” she said finally, smiling faintly and giving Harry a hug.
“So, shall we see if there’s been any progress? Which I, personally, doubt,” Snape snarled, without really expecting Harry to answer his question. “
Harry’s mind was whirling. The snake (or Harry?) attacking Arthur Weasley, Harry’s desire to hurt Dumbledore, arriving at Grimmauld Place, visiting St. Mungos… Everything had happened so fast he hadn’t had time to fully understand what it all meant. Besides, the fear of being possessed by Voldemort, the possibility of Harry being some sort of weapon of his, had made Harry feel somehow so filthy he barely could stand being in his own body at that moment. What if he really was possessed? What if he, somewhere deep inside, was the one who attacked Arthur and wanted to hurt Dumbledore? What if he was somehow inherently and irreversibly evil and hadn’t just realized it yet?
“Harry, you’re surely well aware it’s not even December yet?” Draco asked, raising an eyebrow as he sat up.
“I think you’d better go,” Harry said stiffly.
“Harry, what was that about?” Hermione whispered worriedly when she stepped to Harry’s side and put her hand tenderly on Harry’s left shoulder. Harry hadn’t even realized that other students might have noticed the little interaction between him and Malfoy.
Malfoy laughed softly against Harry’s neck and let finally go of Harry’s arms. Harry put his hands instantly to Malfoy’s waist and started tugging the hem of Malfoy’s shirt. He laid his hands against Malfoy’s warm, soft skin, feeling thin hairs below the Slytherin’s navel.
Harry chuckled, feeling suddenly hot all over despite the coldness. “Your fingers will fall off if you don’t put your mitten back on,” he said. “And give me my glasses back, I want to be able to see the Northern Lights.”
“Yes. Why?”
Once more Draco watched himself in the mirror with a satisfied grin on his face. This night was going to be something so much better than his Potter Stinks badges.
Harry started stroking Draco’s hair as he studied the other boy’s face. He was sure he had never seen Draco this serene and exposed at the same time, as if Draco trusted himself completely in Harry’s arms.
“Doesn’t make a difference to me. A Muggle contraption that flies even though it shouldn’t be flying.”
Harry felt his face turn red. “Erm, maybe,” Harry said, fiddling with his sleeves. “If you know Malfoy that well, why don’t you ask him?”
Harry hadn’t known about Draco’s plans for that evening and he hadn’t had that much time to check the Marauder’s Map that day, so it was a huge surprise when Draco made an appearance at the party. He tried to pretend he had only wanted to come to the party so desperately he had decided to try to gate crash, but Harry could see immediately there was something else to it. When Snape made Draco leave with him, Harry sensed there must be something ominous going on, and that Snape was certainly more aware of Draco’s doings than Harry. After having pondered for a few seconds what would be the best course of action, Harry made his excuses to Luna, pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket, and dashed to follow Draco and Snape.
“Potter is still on his little trip with Headmistress and miss Granger,” Snape said coolly.
“C’mon, you can come back to your room as soon as you want to if you don’t like being there,” Granger said encouragingly.
“It was Blaise, actually,” Harry said, his face turning a bit red. “And I wasn’t ready to talk about this earlier. I think I needed a few days to, erm, cool down a bit.”
Harry took a deep breath. He had prepared for this and gone through the conversation countless times in his head. Still, it always seemed to feel so much worse in reality.
not Malfoy’s.
Harry had been right; it did feel bad to go through the courtyard and see everybody being so happy and excited. That made Harry feel all the worse because he really didn’t want to be someone who’d be bitter about other people’s happiness, but, apparently, he was. At least at the current moment. All he wanted now was to go back inside, preferably to his own bed behind the curtains.
The paperwork ended up taking three whole days as the Ministry seemed to be in no hurry with letting Draco go. He didn’t know how many times he had counted the grey stones on the wall before he was freed, but he was sure the number of them had imprinted in his mind for the rest of his life; there had been 127 of them.
Draco was completely quiet and compliant as Harry led them out of the castle and towards the lake. Now, though, Draco being quiet and unresponsive didn’t make Harry as anxious as before as the warmth of Draco’s body reminded him that Draco was alive. No matter how thick walls Draco had around him, he was still there, and it must still be possible to reach out to him.
“Yeah. I want this to work out, but I don’t want us to hurt each other. I’m fine with casual taunting, you know, Scarhead, disturbed and dangerous, Potter stinks and stuff like that, but not with… personal things. Do you get what I mean?”
“You really did have quite a Christmas,” Draco said blandly. “If it’s of any comfort, Snape hasn’t let me go that easily, either. His favourite pastime at the Manor seemed to be to try to convince me that you’re evil and only want to enjoy me for a while until you get bored and dump me.”
“So, how has your weekend been? You went out with the group?” Harry asked, trying to change the subject.
“Erm, I’m not exactly an expert on technology, but I reckon it goes through telephone lines or something.”
“Mate, what took you so long? I’ve been waiting for ages,” Ron said, rushing excitedly to his friend and throwing his arm around Harry’s shoulder. “You never guess what, I actually did it! Here you can see Gryffindor’s new Keeper!” Ron continued, grinning widely.
“I know,” Narcissa said. “I don’t want you to come back, I know you’re doing so much better now and that you’re safe,” she went on, her voice so full of pain and vulnerability Harry wouldn’t have believed it to be Narcissa if he didn’t see her right before his eyes. “But I miss you so much, my son.”
“What?” Malfoy asked, confused.
Draco telling Harry how the War wouldn’t have to break them apart, and how the War wasn’t theirs at all, to begin with.
“Er, right. Thanks?” Harry said, not knowing how to take Ginny’s comment.
“I can see that, you twat, you know what I meant. Who did this to you?”
“I get it,” Draco said. “But I want to see you soon again. And if you need me at any time, just send me a message by a school owl or through Blaise.”
“Oh, how nice of you to finally admit it, Ronald,” Hermione said, smiling at Ron teasingly, meanwhile Harry started to pack his bag.
“Could I talk to you?” Harry asked, biting his lower lip nervously.
Harry turned to his back, starting to stare at the ceiling and listen to Ron’s even snoring. Merlin, how would he get through a day with an overenthusiastic and energetic baby on no sleep?
“Malfoy?” Harry whispered back, his hands cautiously trying to grope his surroundings. Again, in vain.
“Erm, yeah…” Harry said, nervous.
Draco yelped and jumped as Harry tried to muffle his laughter.
“Hi,” Granger said cautiously. “May I come in?”
“You’re going out again?” Harry asked in a somewhat strained voice.
“I think I know what you mean,” Draco said, pensive. “I did have parents, but they were mainly so distant, and I had to pass most of the time alone. Quite often, I didn’t have anyone else to talk to than the portraits on the walls and the house-elves,” he continued and grimaced. “Merlin, that sounded pathetic.”
Draco looked at the horizon and said nothing for a moment. “I don’t know, Harry. Everybody around me has always said Muggles and Muggle-borns are a serious threat to us. And that we’re better than them. I’ve never even considered it could be otherwise.”
“A pre-Christmas party?” Zabini asked, confused.
” Weasley said, distaste in his voice
“We’ve talked about this before, the mead was an accident, he didn’t really try to kill Ron. And not even Dumbledore, not truly. And what could he have done to help me at the Manor? To attack against all the other Death Eaters all of a sudden? That would’ve gone well,” Hermione said, a bitter tone in her voice. “Actually, considering his position during the War, it really was a big thing he didn’t hand us over to Voldemort. It would’ve made Voldemort see him and his family in a good light again,” she went on. “All I mean is that he couldn’t be on Voldemort’s side, not wholly. But he was young and didn’t have much of a choice.”
Suddenly, the door opened, and Draco peeked into the room. “Professor Snape, Headmistress is looking for you, she – oh,” Draco said, look on his face turning uneasy as he saw Harry sitting in the room. “Sorry, didn’t mean to interrupt,” he muttered, trying to leave hastily.
“Dunno,” Harry said, shrugging and feeling uneasy. “Don’t think he’s going to be too delighted.”
“So, what do you think?” Harry asked Draco, nervous. “Thought we could practise using this together before Christmas, I’m not that good at using a phone, either, because I’ve never had one. But I thought it’d be nice to be able to communicate somehow during the Christmas holidays as we can’t firecall or send owls to each other. Phones just don’t work in places with lots of magic, so we should go a bit further away from home when we want to send a message. But if you don’t like it I can return it, maybe it was a stu –” Harry went on babbling until Draco cut him off.
Not that time, or rather the lack of it, would’ve been the only problem. Harry felt absolutely exhausted when the first school week came to its end. After the first DA lesson Cho had neared Harry and hinted quite clearly she wanted Harry to ask her on a date to Hogsmeade on Valentine’s Day. At first, Harry had tried to pretend he was too thick to get the message, but after a while, he could’ve done nothing but take a long breath in and tell Cho he actually didn’t want to date her. Nor anyone else, for that matter. He had tried to tell it to her as gently as he could, which probably hadn’t been gently at all as Harry could’ve seen Cho’s eyes filling with the tears even though she had tried to say it was okay. After that Cho started to ignore Harry quite studiously, which made Harry feel even more uncomfortable. Hermione, on the other hand, was really proud of him as Harry, according to her words, had ‘handled the things maturely and uprightly, as an almost-adult wizard should do’. Although she thought Harry probably should’ve chosen his words a bit better. Ron hadn’t been as convinced as Hermione, because ‘making a girl cry couldn’t possibly be the right way to handle things, not even in the name of honesty’. Harry couldn’t really figure out what he had been doing wrong all along as Cho had seemed to be crying almost every time they had met alone, but now that he thought about it, Hermione might’ve mentioned that Cho was crying all around Hogwarts this year, anyway. And at least now the whole situation was (probably) over, at last.
When I can’t feel the ground beneath my feet
When Harry had just seized the door handle, someone opened the door from inside, making Harry jump a little.
Harry’s face went bright red. “Shut up you wanker and sit down,” Harry snapped, sitting down on the rug and starting to slice the shepherd’s pie quite violently. “And I’m not a sap,” he continued as he handed Draco a plate with a slice of the pie.
discreet, I can give him that. Harry, you should check your gaydar if even you didn’t realize,” he went on, laughing.
“So, er, are we alright now?” Harry asked, looking nervously at both his friends.
“Shit!” Harry cried out. He had been so lost in his thoughts he had managed to cut his finger while chopping the ingredients.
Ginny burst out laughing. “Merlin, I would’ve paid anything for seeing Snape’s face.”
“Draco, are you alright?”
“Where did you meet with Malfoy?” Hermione asked.
“Sorry, sorry. C’mon, let’s try to walk at the same pace,” Harry said, wrapping his arm around Draco’s waist and trying to steer him.
“As if I didn’t know that,” Harry snapped angrily, jolting his arm free and hiding the wound.
“And where are you goin’?” Harry asked, still trying to find the balance.
What is this feeling
“You know I’ll never forgive myself if Voldemort gets to know about us and does something to you,” Harry said. “Draco, I want to help.”
“That you’d call me Harry and I’d call you Draco.”
“Thank you,” Blaise said simply as Harry gave the package to him. He opened the package, took one of the Chocolate Frog boxes and put the Frog instantly into his mouth. “It’s been ages since I ate these the last time. Didn’t remember these taste this good.”
They went to the kitchens, and Dobby, as always, was beaming as he got to be of help to ‘Dobby’s friend, great Harry Potter’. Harry’s face turned red as he thanked Dobby and other house-elves who had gathered to stare at them with adoring and marvelling glances.
It was weird to see Draco there. He seemed to have his Malfoy mask on as his voice and gestures emanated haughtiness and coldness when he talked with his friends. It made Harry get goosebumps; it felt as if it was a lifetime ago he had seen Draco like that, without any indication of humanlike emotions. But Harry could still recognize him under all the layers. There he still was, his Draco.
“Dobby,” Harry said. “And I don’t trust Snape.”
“We – er – I mean, I didn’t want to cause any trouble,” Harry said a bit awkwardly, running his hand through his hair that was sticking out to all possible directions after the floo ride. Even though all the Weasleys had shown so much fondness towards him and called him a family member already for years, he couldn’t help but still feel a bit outsider anyway, and he wasn’t sure if that feeling would ever leave him properly.
“Draco, what is it?” Harry asked, worried as he held Draco close.
Harry petted Draco’s hair, comforting, as he bit his lip to be able to refrain from laughing. He had to admit that the whole situation had started to seem a little hilarious a couple of hours after the episode.
When even the Milky Way isn’t enough
seemed suspicious and Malfoy
“Yes,” Draco said in a painful voice before both he and Harry fell into silence for a moment. “You know, I’ve thought a lot about why I was always so mean to the Weasleys, and, um, I think I might have envied them a bit. Probably still envy, to be honest. I could always get everything I wanted, or, well, at least materialistically, but I still felt like I was never enough. Like no matter what I did, I was always a disappointment, whereas whatever the Weasleys’ kids did or however badly they screwed up, their parents still seemed to love them.”
Harry snorted. “We’ll see about that. Having private lessons with Snape doesn’t sound like a good start for the year.”
“How do
“Fine,” Draco gave up. “But I definitely won’t be there for more than an hour.”
“Draco, could you just call my friends by their real names like I’m calling yours? You don’t hear me calling Zabini, erm –” Harry said, trying to come up with something that would rhyme with Zabini’s name.
“C’mon, this is what we need, what we
Harry stepped out of the Room of Requirement with a tentative smile on his face. The Room was beyond all the expectations, and it was definitely perfect for their practice lessons. And, as Dobby had said, there were only a few people who knew about the place, so they should be able to keep it as a secret if they planned everything carefully enough. For the first time, Harry had a feeling their lessons might actually work out.
After half an hour, Harry and Ginny arrived at an almost empty playground. The sun was already setting, casting its last rays of the light for the day. They went to a bench, put their mittens on it and sat down. The bench was so wet and cold their arses would’ve gone numb in a matter of minutes if they didn’t have anything keeping the dampness and coldness away. Oh, the joys of being an underage wizard.
“I know,” Harry said slowly. “I get it now why you can’t tell me everything, and I understand why you had to take the Mark. But it doesn’t make you belong to him, to Voldemort.”
Hearing Draco fall, Potter turned quickly around, came up to him, and raised him gently up. He placed Draco’s arm on his shoulder and wrapped his own arm tightly around Draco’s waist so that Draco’s whole weight rested practically on him. Luckily, Potter knew better than to say anything about Draco’s state of degradation.
“I take that as a yes then?” Harry asked, breathless, when they had broken the kiss. He started running his hand gently in the other boy’s hair. Draco’s hair was full of glistening snowflakes by now, and Harry was amazed by how breathtakingly beautiful they made Draco look. He looked somehow ethereal, as if he wasn’t from this world at all.
She couldn’t help feel disappointed—and for what? She’d hoped her parents would be writing to her but why did she hope so? For them to take her away? They left her on the doorstep of her aunt’s home. They didn’t want her—she didn’t belong to them. They were strangers to her—just because she looked like her mum didn’t mean there was any connection between them but the name she’d given her. And who names their daughter Persephone? Was her mother’s name Demeter? Was that it? She might as well go by Lilith—or by
"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore."
"I think…thank you…what—what was that thing?”
"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said. "First o' September -- King's Cross -- it's all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, Pur’sephenie."
“Very good, Ms. Potter—take ten points to Gryffindor,” Professor Sprout said. “Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.”
“Does anything…weird happen to you…in the water, I mean?”
was, was that she had planned on brewing a potion like that upon their arrival to school. “Come on, we’d better get up to the school…”
Plan B was Dean.
She smiled to herself in the mirror.
"P for prefect!” Fred glanced at Persephone. “You two match!”
"And so he and his wife will die then?"
“Oh come on!” Sophia, another older girl, said. “It’s rude to reject free beverages, you know.”
break from applying.
“Well, as fun as this has been—” He turned to leave but froze as a hand came down on his shoulder.
"It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you."
Over the course of the school year, Persephone’s skinny, small body had grown. She’d gained weight during her time at Hogwarts and it was only now that she realized she looked almost normal. With her history of ballet training, she’d always been showing the curve of her hips and the toned contour of her legs. Now, she could no longer count her ribs and she found her shirts began to feel slightly snug around her…chest.
Again, for the third time, she told the story—About Dobby’s first warning, blocking the barrier, not letting them send an owl, Apparating them and the car that she had built to Hogsmeade, and then the car going haywire.
“Er, yes, sir, he is.” She nodded, “But I…”
she thought.
She waited until no one was looking so she could slip into the closet that the first years had waited in before being sorted. She closed the door quietly behind her and breathed in the cool air. Good—no ghosts.
Something clicked in the back of her head and she gasped—that was the motto for Ravenclaw. She had read about how Rowena Ravenclaw, the founder of Ravenclaw house, always wore her diadem. Was this a copy? What did it do?
“Mind if I…?” He was gesturing to the bed and she nodded. He came slowly, hesitantly and sat on the very edge, as if he were nervous. “I…I just wanted to say that I’m…sorry.”
Her legs were painfully sore so even getting dressed was terrible. She did the routine Oliver had them do with the boys and then collapsed next to Cedric. Cedric sat by her and glanced at her several times.
“Oh, come off it, Pansy,” Daphne said, “Lily Potter wasn’t a muggleborn.”
"So—after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating—”
She read through the book titles, though some did not have any. While some were written in Greek and Latin, languages she could recognize, some were written in alphabets she didn’t even recognize. One of them had a title written backwards, even. Another had a horrible stain that looked suspiciously like dried blood.
“Isolated?” She said through clenched teeth.
"Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "We've come ter take some money outta Ms. Persephone Potter's safe."
"Storm forecast for tonight!" Uncle Vernon said too joyfully to be sane. "And this gentleman's kindly agreed to lend us his boat!"
His siblings would definitely do that. They would even eat what they weren't particularly fond of just to get on James’ nerves, let alone what they actually liked, for example, chocolate treacle tart. To be exact, his entire family loved chocolate treacle tart, save for one - Draco.
There’s no need for a wedding for Draco to know: he would never be able to leave Harry, until death do them part.
Draco was desperate. He would even beg, just so that James would believe that he’s treasured. A Malfoy should never beg, his father used to say so, but to hell with that! He’s also a Potter now, and Potters would beg if necessary, like how Harry practically begged Draco to marry him. Harry still complained about how difficult he was from time to time. It’s not Draco’s fault for being scared of one more relationship ruined after marriage though.
Harry is caressing his cheek gently. He kisses Draco’s tear stained cheek then his forehead, his earlobe, his hand before kissing the corner of his lips.
Draco loves it. It’s his mother’s gift when he moved in with Harry. It was such an elegant tea set, decorated with golden flowers and leaves. Even someone who has no taste in art like Harry agreed that it was beautiful.
James stomped his feet. There’s ‘
Draco looked at James thoughtfully, his hair shone brightly under the summer's light. He then raised his eyebrow at his stepson,
Wow. Draco gasped. Just, wow.
Albus asked, looking disgusted.
Albus shouted. Scorpius and Lily followed right after him.
That is, to never leave each other alone.
”, James admitted with a little smile which didn’t please Draco, before his face turned into a grimace, “
Harry.
James was silent for one full minute, and that surely said
A question. Even James himself wasn’t confident in his answer. It’s understandable though.
“I can’t live without you either. And you know it’s the same to you.”
Maybe that flame would really never burn out. Maybe it would be still as bright as ever. However, sometimes, it burns a bit too brightly. Too fiercely. To the point it burns them out.
said James decidedly.
' written all over his face. Draco just sighed.
Draco practically jumped at the chance. Once again, to hell with shame and dignity! His son was more important.
It’s James, after all. His energetic, confident, over-optimistic and stronger than anyone else, son.
James grimaced before his father's wink.
Draco coughed, and shrugged his shoulders in front of a perplexed James.
To be fair, there’s actually a promise they have kept till now. A promise which sometimes, feels like a curse.
Draco tried to not wince seeing how James’ smile dropped. His son started to wince again.
They continue kissing, only breaking up for air long later. Draco is sobbing out loud now. His hands fist in Harry’s shirt. The suitcase is lying on the floor, forgotten.
must keep an eye on James.
James folded his arms in an annoyed gesture,
James mumbled while purposefully scattering the weeds he had pulled out all over the ground. Draco rolled his eyes. James should know that would do him no good.
. However, it’s true Granger earnt more than Weasley did.
Harry.
He can hear Harry’s footsteps are nearing. They stop right before him. Draco looks up into Harry’s emerald eyes.
And now, it has changed into something ugly. There’s no “them” anymore.
It seemed his kids had a different idea though.
Granger? Marrying Granger is
for his pranks which often ended with the cry of one of his siblings, sometimes, all of his siblings.
Draco cut in firmly. He could not let it progress into a real fight.
James huffed loudly, purposefully expressing his displease of his younger siblings.
Draco agreed. He actually thought Granger was too soft on him though. Ronald Weasley should stop consuming that much sugar if he doesn’t want to die soon.
Draco just rolled his eyes.
“’Our best’? What’s best when you’re gonna go and leave me alone?”
Draco had always been a bit nervous while being around the children. He was worried if the children would hate him for taking up their mother's place. When the Potter kids greeted him enthusiastically and welcomed him and Scorpius into the house, he was seriously overwhelmed with relief and happiness.
, Draco deadpanned. He noticed there was no actual punishment for the stepmother and step siblings in James’ story.
James growled, curling his hands into fists,
And here he thought James was totally immune to that kind of talk. Draco couldn’t help but burst into laughter while James was looking at him with vengeful eyes.
” James groaned. He was quickly losing his calm in this hot weather, not that he had much from the start, so he didn’t want to have to deal with his stepfather's questions. Especially when he often lost in a debate against him. James was simply not very keen on losing.
James grudgingly returned to working. He looked like he wanted to say more though.
while pointing at James. Lily nodded at that and let her two (more) favorite brothers have some popcorn.
Draco choked at James’ words. He looked at his son who was grinning from ears to ears. That child always got him off guard at the most unexpected moments. It irritated him to no end but, honestly, he kinda liked it. It never failed to remind him of Harry. Like father, like son.
And so, Ashley, or little J, or James Sirius Potter, lived in luxury forever after.
Draco chuckled, looking back at James over his shoulder. James grinned back.
They both know it’s a lie. Just like the many lies they have said before.
Just like Draco and Harry.
continued Albus, following his brother’s example of stealing popcorn from Lily’s bowl while Scorpius was telling her
Right before he closed the door, James shouted.
” yelled James, throwing his arms in a gesture Draco couldn’t quite comprehend.
James had been doing his job properly. James would have almost done by now if he had worked instead of spending time to be such a dramatic
Draco said, voice soothing.
, yelled James, which only earnt him a glance from Scorpius before he returned to his sister and said
“I won’t.”
That was
Harry kisses him on the lips. Draco kisses him back, fiercely. At that moment, he knows the decision has already been made for him.
James mumbled while pulling out weeds with such force that it felt like what he wanted to pull out was actually the ground itself.
James wailed. He really had a lot of energy compared to a boy who
Apologizing was never his strong point, but he was really in the wrong this time. He didn’t want to give his stepfather the feeling that he’s upset with him in one way or another. He was happy when Draco and Scorp appeared in their lives. He didn’t want them to leave like his Mom did. It’s fortunate that she didn’t totally walk out of their lives, like how parents who didn’t have the parental responsibilities did in other families. James knew even though his Dad and Mom remained on friendly terms, there’re still some awkwards between them.
It wasn’t just ballet—it was an assortment of different dances. Hip-hop, contemporary, ballroom, waltz, swing—it was a lot of fun. It was a class Persephone greatly looked forward to, though unfortunately it only came every second day.
“Well, we’ll manage,” said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. “I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot of Gary’s things second-hand.”
“No, I—I’ll be fine.” She winced, touching her knees. How had she not noticed this? Hermione pursed her lips, looking at Persephone. She glanced from her legs to her face, obviously wanting to say something. “What?”
She jumped, looking back. She already knew about who it was because no one else took a hobby out of startling her as he did.
With a beckon to the boys, the three left the shop, one cousin casting an impressed smile at Persephone, while the other glared.
“This morning—I forgot to mention it, sorry,” He leaned back on his chair and for the first time she saw him properly.
“Poisonous?” She mouthed to herself incredulously.
Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Lily.
"She’s not going," he said.
Before she knew what was happening, a whole stack of the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart was being presented to her. She was finally able to escape the spotlight, stumbling hurriedly back to the Weasleys and she tipped the books into Gary’s new cauldron, “You take these—I need some air.”
“Wait!”
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Persephone. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go—cupboard—stay—no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Persephone noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:
“Oh, Will!” Estelle chided, sighing in a light tone. “Leave the poor girl alone!”
Persephone thought about this, a really long moment, before replying, “I understand that, as girls, we need to work harder than any boys do, and because in this school, we’re from a non-magical world, you and me, which makes us need to work even harder. And I get that it may seem like I’m not struggling, but, trust me, I am.” She looked at her, “I mean, I’m famous for doing something I don’t remember or know how to do, so naturally people expect me to be brilliant and have all these expectations. And trust me, I try very hard to learn everything I can, because I don’t
“Our common room is very near the kitchens, in the basement, but I have no idea where,” Susan told her as they strolled the basement, passed some barrels. They’d just come from a lunch time rehearsal. “Some older students won’t let us know—apparently its initiation to find out where the kitchens are.”
Snape said nothing, only lifting his chin just an inch higher, staring down at her in…approval? Suspicion? Whatever the look was, she didn’t have enough time to figure it out, as he turned and called to the rest of the class, “Why is no one copying this down?”
Persephone reacted quicker than Hades, running at him and pulling him along by the arm, and under the desk, hiding from the door. They listened carefully, holding their breath, as the footsteps came and then went. For a moment, they listened the silence, and thanked their lucky stars—usually when they were up to no good and there were footsteps nearby, it meant someone would catch them. Or reveal an evil plot of some sort. They were safe in this case.
Hermione paused only to shoot her a look of distress, “Don’t you think if I could, I would?” She glanced around the common room. Lavender had looked up at the sudden rise of her voice.
“Have you guys lost enough points to make most of the school hate you and call you names?”
“…I will cheerfully beat you to death with a paper napkin!” Hades at some struggled with George on his back.
"Well, now, Mr. Malfoy, that is no way to speak to a young lady!” He squeaked. “Apologize this instant or I shall be seeing you in detention!”
George grinned, “Thanks, you just saved us a bloody mess.”
“Not your American school house!” She snapped, opening her eyes. He was smirking, still reading.
"That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year," Wood said happily as they trudged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons."
He didn’t look at her, “Well, I don’t have that first one—”
"Dunno what Lily thinks she's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. "If I didn' know better, I'd say she'd lost control of her broom... but she can't have...."
“God now I know why you’re so annoying,” She stretched out on the floor. “You go through hell and back every month.”
“Be my Valentine, Persephone!” It was the first time anyone had used her first name in such a long time—someone who had known her personally, at least—and she nearly had a heart attack. She stared at George for a very long time and he betrayed a sentiment of a grin and she pursed her lips.
It seemed like the second she saw him, he saw her. He stared right past Quirrell’s turban to catch Persephone staring. In the few seconds it took for her to realize he’d caught her, to see his eyes widen in the slightest as horror (?) before she registered the sharp, hot pain across her forehead, right through her scar.
She started making a list of questions to ask, and the list just kept getting longer, "So—wizards have banks? They have an economy?” She thought of asking him if owls had an economy too, but thought that best for later.
“He isn’t that great,” Ernie muttered and Persephone snorted. He looked at her and they laughed. “Pass the grapes, would you?” Hannah passed the little jar filled with grapes to him. He grabbed a handful before Hannah offered Persephone some. She took them gratefully.
“Mate…she’s kinda hot…” A guy in the front that Persephone did recognize said in a dazed voice.
“It’s for witches and wizards—Sinistra is supposed to have us all sign permission forms to be allowed to audition here at school in January. Did Cho not give you the permission form?”
-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long."
"I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on," said Professor McGonagall. "It doesn't take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I've already caught him.”
A sudden realization had hit her—her
It seemed like no one else knew of how the sorting worked. Even Hermione Granger, the girl who’d asked around about houses and decided which one was best didn’t think to ask how the sorting ceremony proceeded—she was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need, as if the school would make them do magic right as they entered through the doors.
She took another aisle down and continued on her way and nearly screamed—she bumped into a gargoyle statue. Trying to control her breathing, she stared at its dead eyes and found it was staring back at her. Her heart racing, she ducked under its wing and passed it, never taking her eyes off it. When she did snap her eyes away to check the four way passages, she’d been looking away for too long. It was gone when she looked for it again.
She giggled, “The school was built because the spell had yet to be created and magical children were being burnt alive all over the country, so no, I don’t believe that. I do believe that you must be rather willing now, knowing I’m not a foolish girl.”
Persephone was strongly reminded of Dudley but her interested peaked at the words of racing brooms. She wanted so badly to play a sport, but most teams didn’t allow girls on them. It was merely the least of the sexist things she endured in her school—
As she wandered cautiously, she came upon many cages in various sizes. She opened a cabinet and screamed as she jumped back as something fell out—her blood ran cold as she recognized it as a 5-legged skeleton. She went the other direction when she saw this.
“Got the seeds and cores?” Someone suddenly asked.
Persephone stared at her before nodding, “Of course…”
He almost smiled, “We both know you wouldn’t have done it. And besides—what’s a little motivation hurt?”
“Your family?”
“Shirt off, arms up.” Armand suddenly said to them and she did as told. With the amount of times she’d changed in front of her teammates, she didn’t mind changing in front of her cast mates. If Cedric didn’t mind, neither would she.
She’d been kept in the hospital wing overnight, though Madame Pomfrey had healed her broken bones in minutes, apparently. She was unconscious for it. Oliver Wood had been her very first visitor, coming into the hospital wing in hysterics, asking if she was still able to play right on a broom. It was much like how the student director of the play had come up and checked out if she could still dance.
Persephone’s hysterics rose a little higher. “Really?” Fred was right. There was no mistaking that iconic silver beard.
It was some sort of soft rustling and clinking that was started to grow louder up ahead.
“Oh, come on!” Susan urged. “One Hufflepuff to another?”
“Are we ready, folks?” Fred called from the back, his wand steadily held out to cast the spell that would send them flying down the stairs. Percy didn’t admit it and no one saw his smile, being as he was in the very front, but Persephone could feel his excitement, as he was sitting between her legs. “Three…two…” She leaned back against George, feeling his arms tighten in anticipation. She brought his arms up around her, as to hold them in anxiety before Fred called, “One!”
He stared pointedly at Cedric and he shifted uncomfortably, “Uuummm….”
When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.
Persephone then recounted what had happened in Potions and remarked how unfairly he treated all the Gryffindors. “I think—is it possible that Snape knew my mum?” She knew how everyone saw Lily Potter—okay no that didn’t work if Persephone went by Lily, okay, she knew how everyone saw her mum when they looked at Persephone, but could it be Snape saw her too?
“Er, you guys go ahead,” She told to the Weasleys. “We wouldn’t fit in a cart anyway.”
“You watched?” She asked as he came to stand a good distance away in front of her. She tucked her baby curls behind her ears as he nodded.
“Hey, I got to go—see you around,” He said suddenly and rushed away, leaving her flabbergasted. She stared after him, wondering what had gotten into him. She ignored his sudden mood change and pulled her necklace out of the box and put it on, smiling. Another few minutes to put eye drops in and she could see—really, beautifully see!
“Er…” She thought for a moment. What house would he be in? He was a sarcastic, moody boy that appeared in random places and seemed to stalk her at times. But none of the houses had such characteristics. “I…”
So Persephone had to stand next to Pansy and listen to her sing her part flawlessly. She was basically being told by her stage director to take notes from Pansy freaking Parkinson. She stood and tried to remain pleasant and nodded politely when Pansy told her how she should practice her octaves more.
A different emotion churned in her chest that caused for a terribly disgusting taste in the back of her throat. She thought she would be sick.
“Well, we’re alright, so,” She shrugged, being interrupted when Lee Jordan yelled,
It was raining—she was in Potions class but she could hear it. The patter of the rain, of water. It was distant but her ears picked it up and wouldn’t let her ignore it. She found herself transfixed by the sound and Ron had to kick her under the table several times.
,” She said through clenched teeth, “Has
They made three of these cakes, laughing as they thought of the results.
"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.” Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to seal her fate and tell him exactly how to use the curse, but Persephone shushed her and beckoned them all forward.
He blinked slowly, a silent denial of complete calm,  “Hades Black is a very unique student, presenting unique situations, including his sorting, which I may remind you, does not concern you,” He had never been such a…headmaster, an authority figure, never to her. “Now, if that is all, I suggest perhaps you get some sleep. It is rather early and those extra minutes of slumber do unimaginable wonders.”
They got an answer nearly an hour later when they knocked on the gamekeeper’s hut’s door. They had to wait a good few minutes, exchanging confused looks while someone shuffled heavily around inside, making a racket of noise. Finally, Hagrid peeked out of the window, through the closed curtains to ask, "Who is it?"
"A Merry Christmas to you, my lady!" George said, bounding right up to Persephone to pull her up and kiss her cheek. Fred kissed her other cheek and she screamed in surprise, laughing, turning a deep red color. “And a heartily thank you for our gifts—”
“I’ll take Gary and you two come right after us,” Mrs. Weasley told Persephone and Ron, grabbing her youngest son’s hand. As the others had, they were gone in less than a second.
She blinked, almost awake, and she put on a concerned face, “Owls are nocturnal.”
“Mail’s due any minute—I think Gran’s sending a few things I forgot.”
Professor McGonagall seemed pleased with her answer and gestured for her to attempt again. She let Lavender’s wand hover above the match and repeated the incantation, now keeping the wand above the match as it tremble once more. Slowly, it turned into a needle and she broke into a smile, looking up to McGonagall, who was nodding approvingly.
“Oh my—Astoria! I am so sorry, Lily, truly, my
“I heard, of course. I blame myself for this spasm of behavior.”
“So,” She said following after him, “You’re being really quiet. On the night of a full moon.”
They had to double back and get under the cloak once more and finally quieted down, slipping down the spiral staircase, feeling a lot lighter—Norbert gone, Malfoy in detention, her favorite person in Privet Drive a witch (!). She would look forward to the letter.
She shrugged, “They’re not all mine.”
Her heart thundered but she couldn’t dwell on her being a witch—a witch!—when the owl clawed at her. She yanked her arm back, “Ow!” Why did owls hate her so much!?
“Percy! Long-time no see!” Diana cried swooping in for a surprising hug. “I did not think you would be breaking so many rules your first year!”
She was not very nice to Lockhart in her mind and Tom was familiar with the turn in her mind at the sight of him—he was dressed in sweeping robes too nice for the grounds, in a color of vivid turquoise, his golden hair under a perfectly positioned matching turquoise hat with gold trimming. Next to him, Professor Sprout’s usual demeanor looked worse. She was a squat little witch how wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair and as was usual, she had a large amount of dirty on her clothes and under her nails.
"Now who’s the liar?” She said through a clenched jaw.
“Oh, I can—”
"It’s a Nimbus Two Thousand, sir," Persephone smiled at her favorite professor, ignoring the look of horror on Malfoy's face. "And it’s really Draco’s fault that I’ve landed myself so lucky,” Her smile turned to Draco, who stared at her in a colder sense.
As always, she exited the Gryffindor common room early to head to the library and return a book. Ben had been waiting by another painting, staring off into space when she had passed him. She hadn’t even realized she’d passed him until he suddenly jumped to life, calling her name. She turned in surprise.
Fred, who had finished his own list, pondered out loud, “This lot won’t come cheap,” He glanced at his parents. “Lockhart’s books are really expensive…”
“Well, I actually didn’t have to use money at all as a friend of mine from the group, Chris, demanded to buy me drinks when he heard I had never tasted any of the stuff they were selling there. And it wasn’t that bad! Not at all as bad as the stuff that Finnegan made us drink,” Draco said, grimacing.
Harry started drawing circles on Malfoy’s cheek with his fingers, and Malfoy leaned immediately into Harry’s touch, closing his eyes. Harry moved his hand to Malfoy’s forehead, trying to smooth the Slytherin’s worry wrinkles with his fingers. Then he lowered his hand to cup Malfoy’s other cheek and rubbed the frostbitten and red skin as he saw the other boy relaxing and starting to smile slightly. Finally, Harry put his fingers under Malfoy’s chin, tilted it up a fraction and leaned slowly against Malfoy.
“Well, then there’s probably something wrong with his phone,” Ginny said firmly. “Aren’t you going to open his present?”
“Are you going somewhere?” Ron asked, confused.
A few days after Katie Bell’s return to school, Harry could no longer come up with excuses to ignore Draco’s role in the cursed necklace or the poisoned mead. At first, Harry had sighed of relief when Katie had told him she didn’t remember who had used the Imperius Curse on her and who had given the necklace to her. No evidence, no crime. However, when Harry was heading alone to dinner one day, Draco’s dot being in an unusual place on his Map drew his attention. Actually, the place wasn’t that unusual at all, there was hardly anything suspicious about Draco being in the boys’ bathroom, but rather the company he had made it feel like there was something strange going on as the only dots in the sixth-floor boys’ bathroom belonged to Draco and Moaning Myrtle. The curiosity won over Harry, so he decided to make a detour along the sixth-floor corridor.
“Are you coming or not?” Harry asked, lifting the corner of the Cloak.
“It wasn’t that bad, was it?” Harry asked, smiling.
“Okay, okay,” Ginny said, smiling all the time more and more widely. “So, you really like this boy? You wouldn’t come up with a gift like this to just anyone.”
But Draco couldn’t stay conscious. He tried, he really did, but the darkness was far too inviting as it dragged him slowly into its depths.
“So, how many options did you actually give him?”
The following weeks were easily ones of Harry’s favourites in his entire life. For starters, Hermione had managed to organize Harry an interview for The Quibbler, and it had been a far bigger success than Harry and his friends could’ve ever anticipated. The malevolent gossiping about Harry lessened notably, and Umbridge was fuming with rage as she didn’t have any actual tools to make students stop reading the article. The article had made even Seamus apologize to Harry and tell him he believed him now, which finally made the Gryffindor fifth-year boys’ dormitory living much more comfortable again.
Draco smiled warmly. His eyes were sparkling and his face relaxed. James secretly heaved a sigh of relief.
Of course.
Draco stopped James, then turned to his other kids,
Harry is serious. Harry has always been serious about their relationship. That’s one of the things Draco likes about him. Now it’s just killing him.
This time James didn’t yell or even pouted. He only quietly murmured but his voice showed that he was upset. Draco looked at his son, alarming. He was seriously worried now. That boy who was always full of confidence, saying he’s the most lovable being in the world, said that he’s loved less than his siblings. His baby James felt that he’s not loved! By Harry – his biological father, on top of that!
"It will be fine. I will make it fine. We will be fine."
. But that’s a story for another day.
Draco sighed. Again.
One again, why a fairytale? And
That’s why, right now, even though he said those words in a monotony tone and feigned boredom, he was in truth dreading the answer. The word ‘mistreating’ cut deeper than he wanted to think about.
”, Draco went on, ignoring James’ statement. He knew James was trying to make him feel guilty for not believing in him, and he’s not gonna be swayed in this game with James, like how Harry sometimes did.
Still didn’t forget to express his displeasure though. He was working so there’s definitely some progress at the very least. Draco sighed, turning his back to go in. He had been out there longer than expected.
James gritted his teeth. His face was red and he looked as if he’s gonna strangle all of his siblings. Draco could feel his headache’s coming.
When it’s good, it’s great. When it’s bad, it’s awful.
At least, the children had reluctantly done as he said this time. Draco returned to James. Now let’s get things back in order.
And now, he’s going to break it.
The game console Seamus and Dean had bought them just so they could play whenever they visited was broken. An ashtray had collided with it. Everyone had had so much fun playing video games with it, even Pansy and Hermione had played. The girls turned out to be pretty good at it. Draco still hasn’t gotten even with Dean for their last game together yet.
Draco closed the door. A gentle smile bloomed on his face. James’ voice still echoed.
Sometimes, Draco still couldn’t believe how well his second marriage was going. When he started dating Harry, he was scared of how their relationship would affect the children. He would never forgive himself if because of him, Scorpius lost his first and closest friend. Thank Merlin that James, Albus and Lily were all generous kids.
! Or Cinderella Boy, apparently.
James heaved a breath of relief, thinking he had been off the hook now. Or not.
The only man he has ever loved, still loves, and will always love.
, thought Draco, although he still let nothing show on his face. He didn’t really mind, he knew James didn’t do it with much thought, let alone bad intentions. Besides, even though he would never admit it, James’ story was quite interesting. Just as creative as his pranks were. Why a fairytale (
“I’m gonna kill you and then kill myself if we break up.”
Harry is here.
There used to be a beautiful tea set made of white porcelain in the cupboard.
A strand of hair covers Harry's left eye. How Draco wants to touch it and tuck it behind his ear, but he knows he can’t. His will to leave would be crumpled.
Draco shaked his head, a bit amused. He should have seen it coming. James made his biological siblings into stepsiblings after all.
Maybe this is just inevitable. Maybe Draco should have known this would happen. Harry may not, but Draco should have known. He’s a Slytherin, and Slytherins don’t act before they think. He shouldn’t feel hurt or surprised now.
“’The best’? Whose best? Your?” Harry is angry. His magic is simmering. It’s not like he doesn’t know. He just doesn’t want to accept it’s the only solution.
Scorpius clapped.
“It’s for the best.” Draco just shrugged. It’s really for the best. He doesn’t want more things to break, whether it’s Harry or himself.
One day, a messenger from the castle came to his house with invitations to the Princess’s birthday party. That year, his kingdom's only princess would be coming of age, so the King decided to hold a party to choose a partner for her. Every gentleman in the kingdom was invited to the party, and whom the Princess fancied shall become her husband. His step brothers were excited, anyone who held the Princess’s interest could become the next King, who wouldn’t be excited? Even his step sister was, despite the fact that she wasn't even a boy! Ashley, or mysterious little J, wanted to come to the party too but his cruel step mother and step siblings prevented him from coming by forcing him to do more houseworks and tearing off his dress robe.
Draco simply nods.
James yelled triumphantly. Lily immediately turned her head and glared at him. Albus and Scorpius just looked at them amused.
“Our best.”
James smiled confidently, then after thinking for a few minutes, he hastily added, “
Many things had been there. Many things had broken.
Draco tried his best to contain his laugh. All boys are scared of their mother, for whatever reasons. Ginny has always been his card specially reserved for dealing with James. Maybe he shouldn’t enjoy teasing the poor boy that much. Oh well, trivial details. Now, return to the main topic.
, Draco fought to keep his voice neutral but still ended up grinning a bit, “
James cringed at Draco’s words. His father could hold grudges for
fairytale!), though, Draco didn’t understand. And so, he decided it was all Harry’s fault, just like how everything else that he didn’t understand was. At least, Draco wasn’t the one who read the kids Cinderella.
Lily stopped on her track and swallowed loudly.
Once upon a time, there was a little boy whose mother died when he was young. His father then remarried with another woman. His stepmother brought with her two sons and one daughter into the household. They were living normally until one day, his father who was a merchant died in an accident. His stepmother and step siblings suddenly changed their attitude toward him and started mistreating him. They forced him to do all the houseworks, starved him and made him sleep in the kitchen while they were doing nothing but spending all the house's wealth. The little boy had to work from morning till night, which made his face always covered in dust, ashes and mud, so people called him Ashley, although his name actually started with a “J".
James raised his head curiously at Draco’s voice,
!” James protested.
“You can’t!”, yelled Harry. He looked like he’s gonna go insane at any moment with bloodshot eyes and disheveled clothes.
? James should revise his definition of ‘easy’. Draco hated to admit it but sometimes, he truly sympathized with Weasley. No offenses. She’s a wonderful woman (which, again, wasn’t what Draco would ever tell anyone) but
Draco and Harry had told James to stop with his pranks, at least while they were home, away from Hogwarts, but as if James would follow anyone’s order. That’s why James was there, weeding their backyard. As to why Draco was there too, well,
That seemed to disencourage James in one minute.
James blinked his eyes before a broad smile broke on his face.
muttered James.
James yelled, “
. Draco swore he could even hear the regret in James’ voice. By the way, the ‘handsome’ part was stressed. And it’s not like Draco didn’t know what Granger’s current name was. She married Ronald Weasley so now she’s a Weasley too but the name Granger just stuck and there’re already too many Weasleys so Draco still called her ‘Granger’. And she didn’t mind anyway. At least he stopped calling Weasley ‘Weasel’ so let him have something familiar
“I don’t want to hurt you.”
James begged. His puppy eyes made Draco’s melt a bit. Just a bit.
Seriously, this child.
answered Scorpius, throwing popcorn in his mouth in his sister's indignant yell of
Albus shouted cheerfully.
”, Draco just rolled his eyes. As if anyone would believe that. James had always been
, Draco coughed, not looking at James,
James raised his head so fast Draco was scared that he would hurt his neck. He was excitedly talking nonstop about how his afternoon would go without weeding the yard.
And those dungbombs James threw at them were pretty nasty. It took Albus and Scorpius the entire morning just to get the smell off. Must be new products of Weasley’s Wheezes. George Weasley should stop giving his nephew those things if he didn’t want to see more of his family crying and screaming.
“The weird one, the one with dark hair—the American,” Tracey filled in the blanks for Persephone.
"So, Mr. Ru—” She tried to start but he cut her off,
George stiffened at this but Fred started smirking, “And…do you?”
“Fred? George?” She called in surprise.
The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer full chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.
They stared at each other for a long moment before he looked sharply away, “If that is all.”
“Really? You seem to fit the protagonist requirements—you’ve got a rather interesting and complex background—”
He laughed loudly, making her jump, “I wouldn’t worry about spiders—werewolves wouldn’t come close to us either.”
“No idea,” She said, in a hushed voice. “I just remember seeing a pair of great, big yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up and then—I was floating away…” She looked almost dreamily at Persephone.
“McGonagall’s offering extra practice next month, I think,” Persephone said. “I’m mostly having trouble with history of magic. All those dates—” She started rolling her eyes backwards, “Ugh, I hate it.”
This was another reason why Persephone spent as much time as possible out of the house, inside the Johnsons’ home and in Diana’s room. A few years ago, she’d attended a boarding school out of London—now she’d been packing up her trunk of old school things in a trunk, some clothes, a little badge with the letter P on it, etc.
“Miss will not put herself in mortal danger?” He asked.
“Family stuff,” he shrugged.
She felt her way in the complete darkness and found a softer fabric that was definitely not apart of the stone wall. She stood on her toes to reach to the ceiling and found the frame part of the picture and traced it from corner to corner, jogging to side and down then up, trailing her nails to the entire frame.
She was sat in a circle with the twins on either one of her side, both sitting in the same position, legs crossed and hands on their knees. In front of them was a plain piece of parchment and three candles, lit and moving.
“Underwhelming,” He muttered, removing whatever was covering her eyes. “Room of Requirement only appears when someone really needs it—hence the creative title. And right now, I really need to help you—I just need to figure out how…” He muttered the last phrase.
As she examined her reflections—her face seemed so strange with sharpened eyebrows—someone walked in, startling her. She jumped as Aunt Petunia walked in, setting fresh, folded sheets on the bed. She stared at her for a moment, not expecting her aunt to linger but surprised to find her lingering, closing the door and standing in the room for a moment before placing something else amongst the sheets. Persephone looked away, “We’re going up to London tomorrow, so we’ll take you to King’s Cross. Here’s the rest of your medication,” She nodded to the bottle she’d dropped on top of the bed.
"Bones, Susan!"
“Well, now, don’t be so ridiculous, Fred,” Mrs. Weasley said, though her cheeks flushed. “All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.”
The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank’s underground tunnels.. Persephone would have enjoyed the breakneck journey down to her vault, but instead had nerves bubbling in her chest at being almost alone with Hades.
"We've already told him we haven't seen it," Ron said, but the girl wasn’t listening, ignoring him when she looked at the wand in his hand.
“Weird like…like you feel different?”
“Oh?”
Oliver would march his troops out of the castle and down to the yards where they’d start off with doing laps around the lake. It didn’t matter the conditions—rain, wind, sunshine, early morning chill. They would be running. Persephone enjoyed the run—it made her breath easier later on in class.
Upon seeing the first question, she scolded.
“Oh, pish-posh! She was the one who suggested inviting you in the first place before she knew you were on the list.” Persephone wasn’t sure if she believed her, for Daphne was known to be nicer than Pansy, but then, she felt as though she were being watched.
"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
Apparently, Wood was a person. A burly, fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused. Was…was this going to be a person who was going to punish her?
“Now that’s debatable but what sort of motive would he have? He’s a professor, Lily, and he’s scared of everything! I highly doubt he would do something so crazy.”
"What if he's—?"
“I cannot imagine you’ve come across too many decent people, then,” She said, in hopes of getting a laugh. He shook his head and then he got up and started banging his head down on the bench. Persephone shot off it as he started shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!”
“Petunia!” Aunt Petunia came over to him and gasped at the sight of the letter.
She choked, “Really?”
He rephrased it, “You’re always with someone. You’re never alone—whenever did you find the time to be popular, Potter?”
kind of magic!”
He glanced at her, smirking, “I happen to be here because I’m good at potions, Potter.”
She was disappointed he didn’t. She wished he would confess and apologize already. She missed him, and to this she’d admit to no one. He looked as he usually had—dark messy curls, pale skin, stupid, tatter book bag he carried everywhere with him. He was wearing his glasses today as well. He, like her, had recovered from the horror of the full moon. She could barely remember it now. All she knew of it was that it was painful. But, she looked better. Her skin wasn’t sulky and she felt better too.
Hermione hesitated, “Sure…but I’ve actually always wanted to try mascara but was afraid people would call me a ‘girly girl’.” She admitted. Persephone straighten.
"Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. "That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!"
“What happens now?” She asked when he wrote something down on the chart.
“I was in Wampus house,” He told her cheerfully, with a tone of mocking her.
With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, the car hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; she could hear Salem snarling in terror; she kept running, the adrenaline pushing her forward and finally slid to the side of the car, falling as she did so.
“By the American no less,” George grinned back.
“Are you free tonight?” He asked. She raised a brow.
It was nicer than most things that her aunt did, but nonetheless, nice.
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.
“You said what?” Ben—Hades exclaimed, stopping their walk. She was explaining the conversation to him and his sudden outburst made her look at him in surprise. “Say that again?”
“Okay,” She gasped, adjusting herself. Fred started to drive again as she reached to grab Salem from Ron. “Alright,” She and Ron grinned at each other.
And then she realized Draco Fucking Malfoy was standing amongst the boys, looking bored. She stared at him for a long moment and Daphne nudged her, sending her a questioning look. She stared with wide eyes between her and Draco and Daphne shrugged, “He’s good.”
She nodded awkwardly while the professor smiled at her, “Well, we’re all very happy you are here with us.”
Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family—in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.
It was most certainly not a good night. She was unable to sleep. She was hyperactively aware of every sound in the house. It was as if he hearing had gone into overdrive.
“Right, sorry,” He looked down to his arms and then he was gone. He was back before she could blink and she took a step backwards at what she saw in his hands. “I’ll help you put the shackles on.”
"Sir?” She spoke again. “Is Vold—sorry, You-”
There was a dotted line by their names, descending to another name, a familiar name that she couldn’t quite place—Sirius Black. She identified the line with the legend at the bottom as ‘adopted’. She narrowed her eyes, reading a little printed star next to the name. The paperwork apparently went out but was blocked by a third party. Strange.
What she did not expect were people coming up to Hades congratulating him on the inheritance. He was now the only living Black heir, eligible in both youth, law and blood for the inheritance. It was a strange occurrence the first time but even weirder the seventh.
For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
Heavy silence followed and Persephone leaned forward in waiting for more. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead. Neville was looking nervous.
place?”
“I—told—you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, "I—told—you."
It wasn’t just her hair—should she want to, she could make her nails grow longer and arch her eyebrows differently and even sometimes make herself taller. When she was a girl, she believed that her hair became redder and redder because of the exposure to sun and would darken in the shadows of her small bedroom. Now, when she wanted to, she would will for it to turn black and then red. A pretty color, too, her natural hair, though sometimes she does make it turn redder and lighter in the sun. But she liked being natural.
He tried jumping out of the way but it didn’t work out and then suddenly, Hades, Hermione, Ron, George, Fred and Persephone were fighting with water, causing people around them to laugh, cheer and back away.
“Yes.”
Persephone, on the other hand, had the strangest idea that she was able to change her appearance at will—at a very strong will, that is. Usually, her hair was a dark red, curly and thick and too long for aunt Petunia’s liking. Sometimes, if she concentrated hard enough, she could make her hair darken to a coal black.
They encountered one obstacle and that was Mrs. Norris, who could not see them but could probably smell them.
Confused at where this conversation was heading, she nodded.
“Have you ever wondered how it would’ve been if it had been considered normal to befriend with the Slytherins before the War?” Hermione asked out of the blue, looking pensive.
When Draco had made Harry lay down under the covers, he changed his clothes, too, laid down on the bed and pulled Harry into his arms again. Harry was still crying a little, some single tears running slowly down his face.
When they had eaten, Arthur went to the shed on the garden that was reserved only for his Muggle items, meanwhile, Ron and George went to the living room to play Wizard’s Chess. As not the most eager chess player, Harry decided to stay with Molly and help her to clean the kitchen as Molly made them some tea.
Ginny nodded. “He told me about you two from his perspective. And even about the time before the thing between you and Malfoy officially started. It’s good for Malfoy to have a friend like him.”
“She may have been young and braver back then. Now there’s no way I could see her doing anything behind my father’s back, let alone fraternizing with an enemy,” Draco said sullenly as he drew lines on Harry’s stomach with his finger.
“I don’t get it at all. We’re superior to them in all the possible ways. Your relatives ought to be grateful to even know we exist.”
. Harry knew he had a lot of people who liked him, but he had never experienced someone caring about him on such a deep level as Draco did. Actually, he hadn’t known that kind of caring even existed. Draco was being so gentle with him, always telling him how wonderful he was and making sure Harry was okay and liked what they were doing. He let Harry see him in a totally new light, showing how much he wanted to be near Harry and how much he enjoyed Harry touching him. He let Harry see also his agonizing moments when the fear of other people’s thoughts about them and what they meant to each other pulled him into the darkness. Draco didn’t flee anymore, but Harry could see the pain and the fear creeping onto Draco’s face, making his body tremble slightly and his breathing getting ragged. When that happened, Harry used to wrap Draco tightly in his arms and whisper comforting words into Draco’s ear until he calmed down and melted into Harry’s embrace.
“Smileys?” Ginny asked, raising her eyebrow, and looking confused.

“That I understand if you can’t wait for me. And I’m not asking you to.”

“I’m afraid that trick won’t work after the first Christmas,” Andromeda said, laughing.
“I know that, or, I mean, I know it wouldn’t be easy. To be honest, nothing is ever easy with you, I don’t think I even want easy. But I don’t want to let go of you. I won’t,” Harry said stubbornly.
,” Granger said sharply.
But then, the doorbell rang again.
Mentioning Dobby twice in a row made him remember he actually had brought food and presents.
“You’re right, Harry. Death Eaters are something too horrible. Malfoy’s annoying and a huge git, but he could never kill or torture people the way Death Eaters do,” Hermione said.
