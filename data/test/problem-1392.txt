Harry flushes. ‘Shut up,’ he mutters, looking back down at the photos. ‘I wonder what was on the one he took.’
Draco’s gaze narrows. ‘You could’ve fooled me,’ he says sharply, turning away from Potter and rummaging around his bedside table.
With a start, she realises he’s watching her. Waiting for her to pick up his gift from her own pile. Though she’d told Thistle to skip their tradition of “giving” (knowing that it would not be the same with Bella there, and Lucius gone), Draco still wants to watch her open her gift, as he’s always done.
Later, much later (when his brain isn’t clouded by the fog of a potion trying to drag him to sleep) he’ll marvel at the implication of that comment.
Potter and Malfoy stop for more coffee as Hagrid scopes out a spot that will fit them. As the boys are heading back (and Tonks is settling herself into a small table three spots over from Hagrid), five small crups burst from some nearby bushes, snarling and biting at each other, and stampede through the seating area.
from within followed almost immediately by a shrieking sound. A cold feeling wraps around Ginny’s heart, catching her breath, and she turns back, staring into the smoke strewn room with wide eyes. Enormous heat radiates out from the room, and yet, she shivers, caught in a numbing chill. The smoke swirls almost taking a shape. An instinct takes hold of her, and without pausing to wonder why, she steps back into the room, grabbing the door and yanking it shut. She takes two steps back, just as something large and solid slams into the door. She shudders.
Harry blinks, eyes wide and bright and hopeful. ‘Well,’ he says, cheeks flushing red as he shoots another quick glance over at Malfoy. ‘I mean…’
He turns on his heel, cloak billowing out behind him. Ron shuffles over to Harry’s side and watches the man go.
‘Hello Luna,’ says Hermione with a smile. She takes Ron’s arm and pulls him into the room. ‘Hello Harry,’ she says, sitting down in one of the spare visitor chairs by Harry’s bed.
‘Er, yeah,’ says Potter, wincing. ‘But we’re in the same year, so classes and what not. Did you not go to Hogwarts?’
‘You’re clearly not cut out to be captain,’ Malfoy continues. ‘At the very least take a little damn pride in the job. You looked like a bunch of ants in a rain storm up there. All of you flapping about without a clue of what was going on.’
’Nymphadora Tonks,’ says Minerva, cutting off Albus with the first name she can think of before he dismisses the idea entirely.
‘We aren’t going to the Hospital Wing,’ says Draco as he passes through a startled group of Hufflepuff third years that scurry to get out of his way.
He slides his fingers into her hair, his fingers tugging on the strands as they get tangles in the curls. She winces, distracted from the kiss that she’s longed to have for so long. A kiss that tastes too bitter. His breathe smells like coffee, and yet he tastes sweet, like chocolate and strawberries, and—like that—something clicks in her brain.
His face flushes red, and Draco can’t help but grin. He bumps Harry’s shoulder with his own. ‘Me too.’
Without preamble, Pansy’s wand is in her free hand, and she shoots a sharp stinging hex toward Blaise. He deflects it easily—not even bothering to reach for his wand—with a flick of his hand. Draco rolls his eyes. Show off.
Ginny pouts, slouching down more firmly in the bed next to Harry. ‘But I’m not tired,’ she objects. ‘And he still needs me.’
There’s another, much more comfortable, silence as they stroll along. Theo shifts, glancing sideways as an amused (for him, anyway) glint enters his eye.
He opens his eyes. Eric’s stuttering chokes off. Draco raises his wand. Eric sucks in a breath. He’s going to beg, or shout, or maybe even scream. Draco doesn’t know, and he doesn’t
‘When you were in that fire, he wouldn’t leave you. The others all went. But me and him stayed. If it wasn’t for him, I’m not sure I’d have got you out on my own. I…I know I’ve been a right git about it all but, look I think he actually cares about you and—I can’t
‘What do you think about?’ asks Harry, his voice so quiet that Draco—lost in the motion of scouring the cauldron—almost doesn’t hear him.
Harry flushes, his spoon stilling in the mixture. ‘I just…’ he turns to her, his eyes wide behind his glasses. ‘He’s always so confident, and I’m…I’m not like that. I can’t just…’
‘Oh leave off Ginny!’ Ron snaps, turning away from her. ‘It’s none of your bloody business. Never mind that I was defending
Luna tilts her head. ‘That’s why we’re here,’ she says and holds up a hand, ticking off her fingers. ‘Neville knows plants. Ginny and Draco are both good at potions. Blaise has the grimoire. You’re exceptional at research. And Ron is good at puzzles.’
Severus glowers, but Poppy sees the way his eyes flick over the results, and how his shoulders tighten.
Potter looks up, his chest heaving, mouth slightly parted as he gasps for breath; and stares bug eyed at Lestrange. He gulps and straightens up (still hyperventilating) and raises his wand. His hand trembles and he curses.
Potter emerges, his robes bunched up under one arm and his new shirt proudly on display. Tonks muffles a snort of amusement.
The nearest prefects bathroom is only a short walk away, and he slips into the room with barely a sound, his pattering footsteps echoing softly in the quiet of the halls.
‘I confess I don’t really understand. You love going for a ride,’ she says, frowning at him in concern. ‘Are you not well?’
stupid decision to make. Maybe she was disappointed, sure, after all she expected more of him. But it certainly wasn’t any reason to cry. She certainly didn’t care who he spent his days with. Why would she? It wasn’t like she—
‘Oh,’ he says, calling out to the class as he remembers that he’s supposed to assign homework. ‘Er, I expect an essay from each of you on how Thestrals are misunderstood by next lesson.’
He shrugs. ‘McGonagall says this training thing will help but…what’s a leaf under my tongue supposed to do? And all that meditation crap? I don’t get it. How is that supposed to help me if…if I…’
‘Couldn’t be helped,’ says Potter, his voice indifferent. ‘My usual babysitter was out of action. They had no choice to bring me. Not that they were pleased about it. Not that I blame them.’
‘Fuck,’ he jerks his wand sideways, trying to cut off the spell, but only ends up sending flames towering toward the rest of the room. Fire catches hold of everything it touches and Harry can only stare at it all, his chest heaving again as panic officially takes hold of him.
‘A tripple nonfat what?’ Tonks mutters, shaking her head and wondering what the hell happened to plain old coffee.
When Hagrid finally drags them out of there it’s definitely passed lunchtime, and Tonks—on her last prepared snack of the day—is desperately hoping for a food stop. Or the very least another coffee break.
She turns to the tree, large—but not overpoweringly so, decorated to just the right degree in traditional greens and reds and golds. She pretends not to notice Bella throwing herself casually into the chair by the fire.
‘’E’s a Bauxbaton boy,’ says Hagrid, shooting Archie a small smile. ‘Pity, coulda made a great addition to Hogwarts.’
Yes, people think he’s big and bulking and stupid, but because of that, they do and say things they would take more care not to do around others. They assume he’s not paying attention, that he’s too
Anger flashes across Theo’s face, but guilt and shame are quick to follow and Blaise suspects those emotions are the only reason the room doesn’t erupt into hexes. Theo instead surges to his feet and, in an almost exact imitation of Draco, throws himself in bed and whisks the curtains closed.
He thinks he hears a familiar cackle of laughter as the Death Eaters push through the street behind him. Glass shatters. Explosions shake the ground. People scream. He sees a flash of red as auror’s begin apparating in to defend the street. He hears a shout he recognises, and turns to see one of the Order darting out of a side alley to join the fight. He could stop to help. He
Harry shifts, his shoulders hunching as he sniffs heavily. Ron frowns and leans forward. Harry swipes at his face, ducking his head so Ron can’t see him properly. It doesn’t matter though.
Potter sighs and looks down. He glances over at Malfoy and, with a reluctant smile, pulls his hand free and steps away from the wall.
The thing is, he can’t let it go. Aside from the satisfaction of beating Granger in this bet (which, yeah okay, had started out as a joke), he can’t help but feel that if he is right, if Draco and Potter have somehow managed to put aside their differences and become friends, then there might actually be some hope for the rest of them.
She thinks back over her housemates recent conversations and remembers the lingering taste of smoke and ash that had drifted through the castle the day before yesterday. ’You mean the fire?’
Draco lifts his chin, though the pink across his cheeks deepens. ‘Yes,’ he says imperiously. ‘Now. It’s…important.’
‘Merlin, Cissy, leave him be,’ says Bella, rolling her eyes in amused disdain. ‘Have you looked outside lately? It’s no wonder that he doesn’t want to go out in this weather.’
Draco shakes his head, holding up a hand, ‘Wait, hold on a second,’ he says. ‘What in the blazes are you blathering on about.’
enjoy reading, she had to wonder what was so special about these books that they’d brought forth such a smile, when all the other presents (like a
Without meaning to, Molly glances toward the clock hanging up by the entrance of the kitchen. Five hands point Work, three to home, and one…Molly swallows and looks away sharply, refocusing her gaze on Harry.
He casts a water charm, flicking his wand toward the burning couch. Flames spew forth. Harry gapes at it.
Malfoy and his goons are arguing, but Ron isn’t paying attention. He yanks his arm free from Ginny and turns, his wand raised.
‘Gryffindor’s and their bloody self-righteous martyrdom,’ he mutters, and glowers at the fading sun outside his window. ‘Where
The upside of all this trouble with Weasley is that Harry has been more attentive than ever. Draco relishes every minute of it.
He just watches. Hagrid steps away from the booth, three tickets in his hand, and gestures the boys to follow. They do, and Tonks peels away from the wall and falls into step several metres behind them. Malfoy is fixated on Potter, watching expectantly as they step through the gate.
Draco glances up from his eclair and blinks. Taking a deep breath—as if preparing for battle—Draco pushes up from the couch and approaches the presents.
Ron shuffles nervously by Hermione’s shoulder. Ginny shoots him a sharp look, gesturing to the other chair with her eyes.
‘We aren’t in a relationship,’ says Potter in a small (and pathetically miserable) voice. ‘You don’t have to fight. We aren’t together.’
?’ asks Potter, staring at Dean in stunned disbelief. ‘Jesus Dean, that’s not…God believe me there is
‘Don’t worry,’ she whispers down at the little book. ‘I’ll get you back to your owner. I’m sure he’s missing you. And we don’t want him to miss anything more than he already is.’
‘You do have a problem saying no,’ she says, thinking of the other day when George had convinced Harry to “endorse” some new item of his to “boost sales”.
He’s leaning over the equipment box and, as Draco tears his gaze away from Potter (disappearing into the lockers) he sees that, yes, the snitch is indeed missing.
Harry takes a deep, shuddering breath. He doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t tell him to stop, so Draco closes his eyes and keeps going. The next part is harder. He’s never thought about how it feels to actually get an erection. He just gets them. So, he sinks back into the grass and pays attention to his own body.
Ron scoffs and continues on, shaking his head and seeming unbothered by the complete lack of response from Malfoy. Hermione glances back at the blonde once more, seeing the tautness to his shoulders, the shadows under his eyes. Eyes that meet hers in the reflection of the window. His gaze narrows, then flickers and drops.
Harry glares at him, his face turning even more crimson, until he turns, scoops up a handful of fertiliser from a nearby pot and dumps it over Malfoy’s head.
Minerva restrains herself from rolling her eyes and sits up a little straighter. ‘Actually,’ she says, ignoring the sigh from Severus (who was readying himself to make his escape no doubt). ‘I’d like to discuss the matter of the Zoo Excursion.’
The keeper smiles. He steps up to the Runespoor tank, where the snake has slithered closer to the glass and was trying to catch Potter’s attention.
He’s not sure what exactly he’s trying to say, only that he’s having trouble focusing on anything except Malfoy’s lips.
I've been feeling a lot better lately and, encouraged by all the lovely reviews you amazing people have left me, I wanted to get something out nice and quick. It wasn't quite what I'd planned, but I hope you enjoy it. Thanks so much for sticking with me guys, you're all awesome.
Potter stares at him and shakes his head. ‘If you don’t know, I’ve no idea how to explain it to you.’ Then he turns to Archie and gestures at Pod. ‘Hagrid said he was only a baby, how old is he?’
Cold seeps into Harry, spreading through his limbs and chasing away all feelings of warmth and happiness. He frowns.
It takes Neville a moment to realise what it is, but when he does he wonders that he didn’t see it earlier. There’s no hostility. They’re arguing, yes, but it’s almost like they’re having fun. There’s a faint smile tugging at Harry’s lips, and a gleam in Malfoy’s eyes, like they’re playing some strange game trying to see who can out-insult the other. Yet none of the insults are serious. They don’t mean them. Even Malfoy’s voice isn’t as barbed or cutting as it used to be.
capable of listening after all, Potter,’ Snape says. He glances around the room. ‘What are you all waiting for? Class is over. Get out.’
Draco flushes bright red, squeezing his eyes shut and shuddering. ‘Ugh, Mum! That’s not something I needed to know.’
‘No. I, uh, I heard that you don’t really have any Christmas traditions and well…I thought…’ Draco shrugs, gesturing around at the park.
The first boy with messy, thick black hair and bright, emerald coloured eyes rimmed by thin wire frames. Harry Potter. A faint flicker of something like a heartbeat flutters in Myrtle’s chest as delight swarms through her.
‘Shit are you okay?’ asks the Girl, starting forward and then halting abruptly when Blue turns her gaze toward her.
Draco peppers kisses along his jaw, his neck, nibbles on his earlobe. Harry makes a small noise of pleasure in the back of his throat and Draco feels the rumble of it through his chest. He presses closer, practically crawling into Harry’s lap, straddling his hips in an attempt to be as close to him as possible.
‘Well I would—after all those brownies smell amazing—but I’m a bit worried that if I leave you unsupervised you might murder someone.’
She looks up, startled by Malfoy’s voice, having forgotten all about the almost fight between him and her brother.
Poppy pauses, glancing back over her shoulder at the four students and debating whether or not it’s safe to leave the room unattended.
The reaction is instant. Malfoy shoves up from the table, sending it crashing backwards as he crosses the space between them, stopping short just out of reach of Potter. ‘Of course I’m afraid! Merlin, do you know how hard this is? Do you think I’m
Harry doesn’t say a word, he simply shoves his hands in his pockets and heads toward the doors—where Draco and Blaise are still standing.
Harry nods. ‘Yeah. I…I freaked out. At Slughorn’s compartment. Then I ran into Malfoy. He was trying to calm me down, so no one would see.’
seeing the Medi-Witch look tired before. Her hair falls in wisps out of it’s customary bun, her shoulders are tense, and she holds herself with a strained kind of exhaustion.
She reaches up and sweeps her hair back from her neck, swishing it back and forth to encourage the thick, dusty air of the room to cool down the back of her neck. She sighs and drops her hair back down.
Narcissa breathes slowly, keeping her posture still until she’s sure she has a handle on her exasperation. Draco doesn’t quite manage as well. He stares after Bella in a strange mixture of bemusement, irritation and—Narcissa frowns—fear?
Albus places a hand on his shoulder and gently steers him back from the bed, allowing Poppy access to the boy.
Draco grips his forearm, staring down at the mark, fingers digging into the scars. He shakes his head.
She sighs and turns away, but just before she leaves she turns back and says, ‘You know, it’s kind of funny. Potter and Malfoy…they’re almost like opposites. Funny what can happen when two people put aside their differences, isn’t it?’
Potter turns back, and in a rush of movement, Malfoy is there, grabbing Potter’s robes and yanking him close, slamming their lips together in a kiss that is more desperation than passion. Phineas raises his eyebrows.
Nothing really changes in Draco’s expression, except that nothing really changes. There’s no shock, no comical widening of the eyes at Blaise’s suggestion, no embarrassed squawk; but then there’s no outrage either. No flush of anger or indignant screech of protest.
Potter’s jaw clenches. He’s not as good as Draco is at hiding his emotions, and Draco knows that he’s found the trigger. That if he keeps pushing at it, Potter will crack, and things will slip out from beneath the mask. But one look at the hurt lingering just beneath the surface of that blank expression and Draco finds that he doesn’t really want to.
would realise that throwing a person who saved your life across a room isn't a very good show of gratitude.'
‘For a lost cause?’ Ron asks, rising to match Harry. ‘You’re not a lost cause. And if Malfoy wants to change sides and help you then I’m all for it. Let him.’
Her dark eyes gleam with excitement and madness, her manic smile turning her face from a beauty to someone dark and twisted. She steps forward, her eyes fixated on Potter, her wand raising.
‘Watch your step, yes, yes, alright now…’ as Professor Flitwick began to explain their task, Harry hovered in the doorway, not quite able to bring himself to step into the room proper.
‘There’s no point,’ says Harry, that broodiness creeping back into his expression. ‘He’s made it pretty clear he doesn’t want anything to do with me.’
Potter sits up. ‘That…would actually explain it. You know…I think I remember Ron and Ginny acting all weird to. I mean, it’s hazy, but I’m pretty sure Ron and I ended up in a fist fight over…her.’ He shudders again, and runs a hand over his face. ‘As if we hadn’t had enough fights lately.’
Hermione’s gaze narrows. ‘Well if he’s getting annoyed, then that doesn’t bode well for you, now does it?’
‘C’mon Weasley,’ he says, flashing her a grin. ‘You’re not gonna let one more push get the best of you, are you?’
Poppy snorts and summons Malfoy’s file with a swift swish. ‘Hardly. In all honesty I’d forgotten it was an issue in light of Potter’s…’ She trails off.
‘It can’t be Molly or Arthur,’ murmurs Poppy, eyes distant as she thinks. ‘Not with Draco going. Perhaps old Kettleburn? Though he
Draco’s voice cuts off in a rustle of sheets and bed springs. The whole room freezes in static tension. Draco is on his back on the bed and Potter is leaning over him, magic curled around one raised fist, eyes wide with fear.
Hagrid pushes up to his feet and turns to look at them, smiling even though he has to duck in the low ceilinged room.
A wry smile twists Harry’s lips. ‘Uh, yeah, something like that. Look, I’m gonna go for a walk, okay?’
‘She started yelling at me, calling me names. Pervert…and stuff. She said if she ever caught me doing it again she’d throw me out. So I didn’t. Anyway. It’s not a big deal. I just…I don’t really know how to…I mean I’ve tried but when I do I just kinda, freak out I guess. Jesus you must think I’m such a freak.’ He buries his face back in his hands.
He slides down the wall, sitting heavily on the floor and wrapping his arms around his knees. After a long moment in which Ron isn’t sure what to do, he pushes himself up from his chair. His knees wobble, but he holds himself together long enough to settle down on the floor next to Harry.
He’s still getting used to his new wand, and as his worry sores (twisting around his stomach like Devil’s Snare) he jabs at the items a little too hard.
He swallows and takes a step backwards. ‘Sorry,’ he says, but it comes out kind of croaky and he drops his gaze.
Greg isn’t sure what the pair plan to do about those letters, only that—if Blaise’s family Grimoire is involved—that they plan to do
‘Yeah, we see that,’ says Ron. ‘With who? Wasn’t Malfoy was it? Hope you gave the git as good as you got.’
Light bursts through the hallway, blinding all of them. Ron cries out. He grabs at Ginny, pulling her behind him and throwing up a shield to protect them from whatever attack Malfoy has made.
Somehow Greg doesn’t think that Draco will want any of the others knowing that he’s been sleeping in the souvenir shirt he got with Potter.
‘Hey Potter,’ Malfoy calls after him. ‘You might want to work on your shields. I’d rather all my hard work not go to waste, you know.’
A flurry of whispering hisses are exchanged, the strange, hushed language slithering over Draco’s ears and making him shiver. He sees a flash of Blue’s tail as she slides out of Harry’s sleeve, and doesn’t waste another moment.
He steps back, bumping straight into Malfoy whose fresh cup of coffee is knocked out of his hand and all over the front of his uniform.
She spots the rest of the sixth years over by the corner bookcases and trots over, disappointment making her sigh as she drops unceremoniously onto the couch.
It’s not until Potter and his two sidekicks show up that the situation resolves itself. Granger takes one look at the waiting crowd and rolls her eyes.
Hermione does the same and as she watches, Zabini leans over to Malfoy and says something. Malfoy glances up, grey eyes flashing over to their table. His gaze finds Harry’s with unerring accuracy. He frowns and both boys look away quickly.
On instinct, Draco’s fingers brush against the outside of his inner breast pocket, feeling for the stiff edges of the photo inside. He takes it out. A rush of warmth surges through his insides, making him feel gooey and utterly stupid seeing the photo.
Glasses in place, he pushes his blankets back and pads across to the window, his pyjama pants pooling around his feet and almost tripping him up. The night air is cool and his breath puffs out against the top pane of glass. He ducks his head to peer out into the frosty street, his breath catching in his throat in a way that isn’t entirely due to the cold.
Harry feels hot. Too hot. His heart is racing, his ears ringing with rushing blood, and his hands burn.
Harry shivers again, a whole body shiver that sends a burst of pleasure rocketing up Draco’s spine. His eyes flutter shut, and he allows himself to stay pressed close to Harry for a moment longer.
‘Merlin no. Apparently it wasn’t received well. Cindy says the whole thing has rather put Eric off. Apparently Potter tried to set him on fire.’
‘No!’ shouts Draco. ‘I think it’s pretty fucking obvious that you didn’t. What if Brown had touched it? What if
‘Oh really? That’s not what Neville said,’ she says contemptuously. ‘He says you tried to start a fight and Harry tried to stop you, so you
Thistle’s huge eyes dart over to Draco and her face goes grave. ‘Of course, Mistress,’ she says in a quiet voice. ‘I’s understands. Master always enjoys gift giving, we’s shall do our best to cheer him up.’
He tries to distract Severus, tries to swamp him with memories of horses and essay writing and potions practice, and for a moment it works. Until Severus catches a glimpse of Potter in one of the memories, and he grabs hold of it.
She smiles, closes the books, and runs a fond hand back over the spine, glancing back down the aisle, the delicious scent of citrus still tickling her nose.
He watches the diagnostic spells light up around him, various colours highlighting different parts of his body. His hands, the lighting streak scars along his arms, his stomach and his head. For a moment, the only sound is the scratching of the quill, furiously scribbling the results of Poppy’s spells.
He traces the scars back down Harry’s back and settles his hands on Harry’s hips, pulling him closer.
. He’s confused and wants answers, but before he can even get the words out, he starts thinking about what happened. About
The siblings stare back at her, each eager and expectant. Annoyance curls along Romilda’s spine. Ron Weasley has never exchanged two words with Romilda and Ginny? Well, Ginny has shared a dorm with her for five years and has
He smiles and for the first time all day, a little of the gloom washes away from his face. ‘I’m glad,’ he says, and gestures at the painting still in it’s box. ‘I was a little worried…’
Poppy sighs and glances back at her file. How was she supposed to answer that question? She wants to tell Minerva what’s on her mind. After all, Minerva is not only a respected colleague, but her friend. They’ve worked together over twenty years, and there is no one else whose opinion Poppy valued more (not to mention the fact that—being Potter’s head of house—there was no one better suited to give Poppy input on Potter). And yet, patient confidentiality prevented her from discussing anything regarding Potter’s situation with anyone except the Headmaster—and quite frankly, with the state of Albus’ own health, Poppy doesn’t see him as a viable option. She resists the urge to sigh.
Harry makes for the pile of clothes on the bench next to Malfoy, but Malfoy catches his arm as he tries to pass.
of them before, either. But Luna is a sweet girl. She reminds Hagrid of many of the lost and wandering creatures he’s found under his care. Like baby Norbert or Fang or Fluffy. Lost, misunderstood creatures in need of care.
‘We are! Sort of. Look we didn’t start the fight it just…happened,’ he sighs and runs a hand through his hair, wincing when his hand brushes passed a cut above his eye. ‘Can we do this later? I just…I really need to talk to Ginny right now.’
Madam Pomfrey steps over to the bed, placing a hand on Ginny’s shoulder. ‘I won’t let him break,’ she says softly.
There’s a moment of tense silence and Neville just wants to shrink back into the foliage, carnivorous flowers or not.
‘That’s not surprising,’ says Luna in that airy way of hers. ‘I was down at Hagrid’s earlier, and all his creatures were quite fidgety. They felt your magic all the way down there.’
Draco is only half erect, but it doesn’t take much from Harry to get him stiffen fully. Harry’s face is bright red, but for once his embarrassment doesn’t seem to deter him. His brows furrow, and he doesn’t look at Draco, instead, he fiddles with Draco’s trouser button.
The street curves around a bend and they pass by a few shop fronts in comfortable silence. Still, Harry’s insides squirm. Draco’s coat is warm on his skin, making him feel almost flushed, and he shoots sidelong looks at Draco every few moments, wanting to keep talking but unsure where to go from there. He bites the inside of his mouth, screws up his courage, and opens his mouth.
The water shuts off. Draco pulls on his shirt, turning away so as not to cause Potter any anxiety (although the temptation to stand on the other side of the curtain and tease the Gryffindor is hard to resist).
‘His name is Eric,’ she says plainly, not in the mood for games that are no longer any fun. ‘He’s a seventh year. Gryffindor. That’s all I know.’
‘Since the Zoo trip,’ she says, smiling. ‘They were flirting something fierce. But, when Christmas came around, it was obvious they were still dancing around each other.’ She sighs heavily. ‘Stupid Kingsley.’
’Now,’ he says slowly, ‘think about how your body shifts its attention. How everything becomes tense, but in a good way. It’s slow at first. A kind of stirring. The way your insides start to coil. How everything seems to tighten and grow. Everything else goes out of focus, you know? You want more. More tension, more friction, more touching.
Harry’s mind short circuited. He licked his lips, his mouth suddenly dry and tried to think of something to say that didn’t make him sound like an idiot. ‘Maybe.’
Ron freezes halfway through the act of opening the dorm door. For a moment he thinks it’s Dean whose shouted the words. Partly because he’s the first person Ron sees but also because the idea that his best friend likes
‘We’re already altering the plan, so why not mix things up a bit,’ she says, and offers Draco a warm smile, hoping to draw him out of this strange mood he’s in. ‘Do things different this year.’
Harry swallows. ‘I…no. I don’t know!’ he scrubs a hand through his hair and drops his head. ‘I’m so confused.’
Ron turns away from the window, leaning back against it and shrugging half-heartedly. ‘Nope,’ he says. ‘Was probably Malfoy.’
Two boys crash around the corner, landing at Harry’s feet in a tangle of flying limbs and grunts of pain, scaring the absolute shit out of him. His heart pounds and it takes a moment for his vision to clear—flashes of a different kind assault him. Red and grey and a rubble strewn street obscuring his vision.
They converge on Zabini. Ginny and Goyle from one direction, Ron from a second and Malfoy from a third, all of them coming to a stop at the sight of the large pink dome shrouding around a prone Harry on the floor.
‘He’s not making it easy,’ she says to the photo. ‘He never does. But I’ll do my best. I can do that much at least. For whatever that is worth.’
berating her for the habit. It was one of the main reasons the other ghosts didn’t like hanging around her much.
The headmaster nods, apparently not noticing (or ignoring) the thick sarcasm in Madam Pomfrey’s voice.
On the other side of the room, Malfoy is pretending not to watch. He trails around passed the enclosures, glancing into each one with mild disinterest, but his gaze is drawn each time to Potter and the Roonspoor.
from that book, maybe we’ll be able to get through a single potions class without you trying to kill us.’
Albus watches them go and, as they reach the door he adds, ‘I’m sure I don’t need to say this, however, a bit of discretion also would not go astray.’
Malfoy gives him an inscrutable look, before rolling his eyes. ‘As apposed to that?’ he asks, gesturing to Potter’s cup in disgust. ‘Let me guess, black, no sugar?’
As he trudges down to Slytherin dorms, Theo feels the panic subsiding. He isn’t out of danger yet, but at the very least he hasn’t been discovered. Not by anyone significant anyway.
Potter frowns, stepping away from Draco, but this time his gaze stays on Draco’s face. ‘Who says it’ll have to end.’
As Draco watches, a tall brunette seventh year approaches, a shy smile on his face. Harry looks up, eyes wide behind his glasses and dread clearly written all over his face.
Harry is in there. Harry is in there with Malfoy and—the spray of water echoes in the background—either one of them is in the shower or they’re not alone in there.
He groans. ‘God, don’t remind me. Him and me and Hagrid for a whole day. I can’t think of anything worse.’
Draco splashes mud everywhere as he heads toward the only other place he can think to look. Blue’s enclosure.
Yes, okay, so I fell off the side of the Earth for a little bit. I've no excuse, life just got crazy for a bit.
‘Kingsley asked me about the Slytherins,’ says Remus, shrugging with his hands. ‘He made it sound like there was a romance involved.’
‘Muggle technology doesn’t work well around magic because of how it functions,’ says Malfoy in a bland, bored voice, staring at the back of the room without interest. ‘Magic interferes with the energy source, disrupting the normal flow, and making Muggle items go haywire. Runes can be used to dampen this effect, and allow muggle items to function properly.’
Tonks, running out of groups to mingle with as people vacate the enclosure, steps back into a nearby wall and casts a disillusion spell on herself. Cold trickles down her spine and she prepares herself to stay immovably still for what could possibly be a long period of time.
Blaise raises an eyebrow and glances over at him. He’s still perusing his magazine, but now his gaze keeps flicking over to Draco.
‘Sitting outside in the middle of a storm? Yes, yes it is weird,’ says Draco. ‘But that’s rather par for the course with you isn’t it?’
Tonks shuffles along the aisles, careful to keep her arms firmly by her side whilst also pretending to study the various knick knacks on the shelves—not an easy feat mind you. She spies them in the back corner, looking over the shirts on offer, most of which boasting some claim at having visited Scamander Emporium.
‘Oh, nothing important. Just a little bet we have going,’ says Kingsley with a smile. ‘Hope your paying Tonks well, Alastair. She owes me quite the hefty little fee.’
‘Thanks Harry,’ says Neville, beaming. He looks past Harry at the boy behind him and nods. ‘Hey Eric.’
Severus frowns. ‘Of it’s course not. But I always know what’s going on with my students. I assure you, I may not be very approachable, but I have ways of ensuring I known whats going on.’
Harry clenches his fists, gritting his teeth against all the words and insults he wants to yell at this guy. ‘Realised what? What the hell did I do to make you think—’ he cuts off and shakes his head, his heart pounding against his chest. ‘You should go.’
Malfoy pauses on the next tank. He leans a hip against the rail and turns to watch Potter, his eyes shifting back and forth between Potter and the snake with more interest than he’s shown to the rest of the exhibit and it’s only her Auror training (and the thought of what Mad-Eye would do to her if she messed this up over something as stupid as laughing) that keeps Tonks from smiling.
‘Talking about Draco,’ he says, all but shredding the sandwich to pieces. ‘With you. I mean, considering…’ he trails off, shrugging one shoulder and frowning down at his sandwich. ‘I’m sorry. About how things ended with me and Ginny.’
For a brief moment, he contemplates following that familiar scent. The wolf is buried deep, but he’s sure he could do it. Even without the moon’s presence, his sense of smell has always been superior than others.
He ignores her, brushing her hands away as he glances blearily around the room ‘Harry,’ he mutters. ‘Where…is he okay?’
An odd silence falls over the room as Draco dresses. The rustle of his clothing is oddly loud, even with the other shower still running. Draco can’t help but glance toward the closed curtain where he can just make out Potter’s shadow on the other side.
Hermione grits her teeth, but nods. ‘Alright,’ she says, and lays a hand on his arm. ‘You sure you’re okay?’
Draco straightens up, his expression going flat. ‘You’re wrong,’ he says, his voice hard and cold. ‘You haven’t been here. You didn’t even
Potter shrugs. ‘Not like it’ll make her less effective to hang out with us. Besides, it’s got to be boring as hell watching us all day.’
‘Because it’s true,’ says Harry, a smugness to his voice. ‘Obviously the plants like me better than you.’
Draco sighs and without looking at Potter, trudges back to their desk. Frustration tightens his shoulders and the scowl is back at full volume, but there’s still that lingering confusion in his gaze.
‘Well you can relax,’ says Ginny, glowering. ‘Because that’s not something you’ll have to worry about anymore.’
‘I love him,’ says Draco, his voice low, the words bitten out through clenched teeth. His gaze is hard and furious. ‘Are you satisfied?’
Daphne casts him one last bemused smile, shakes her head, and veers off to the back corner of the classroom.
Harry chuckles, low and a little sad. He trots over, and lifts the scrubbing brush out of the cauldron. ‘You have already,’ he says, and flicks suds toward Draco. ‘Hence scrubbing cauldrons, remember?’
‘I…’ Ron takes a shaky breath. ‘I need you to help me steal Madam Pomfrey’s patient notes. Harry’s, that is. I don’t think Hermione will let me do it. She’ll insist we figure it out by doing research, or by asking someone, but Pomfrey won’t tell us and I know she’ll have made notes. She has to have, and if we could just see them, maybe we can, I dunno, put our heads together and figure something out. I mean, you’re clever I guess, and Hermione is brilliant. Surely we can think of
The reptile exhibit is a strange mix of bright and dark. The room, dimly lit, has a faint dusky smell to it and in the brief moment it takes for Tonks eyes to adjust to the subdued light she almost looses sight of Potter and Malfoy. Almost. But there’s Hagrid’s bulking form, already finding a seat at the edge of the cramped little theatre.
It took me so long to write this that I managed to completely forget that I'd used Poppy last chapter as well, so, I apologise. You get her two chapters in a row. Also, sorry for such a short chapter. I'm hoping that next chapter is not only longer, but lighter too but it's proving a little difficult to get into the right headspace considering Harry's mood atm. He is being difficult, and I apologise for the wait as I try to wrangle him into co-operating.
The wolf reappears, sagging back on it’s haunches, it’s head raised in a mournful cry that cuts off with a whine. He ducks his head, curling up and burying his nose deep within his fur.
At least then he’d have an outlet for all the nervous energy keeping him awake at night. He runs a hand through his hair, and instantly his mind flashes back to one of the dreams. Soft caresses and touches and Harry groans, scrubbing at his face.
He runs a finger along the half dozen books crammed into the box (strange and unfamiliar titles like
‘You don’t have to yell at her,’ mutters the Pale One, stepping forward to peer in at her in concern. ‘You shouldn’t have let her into your robes. She’s not a pet.’
‘What’d you say about Hermione,’ Weasley all but shouts, turning around sharply at the sound of Granger’s name.
, Potter is worried about fighting classmates on the other side. He was dating one. Or at least (what with her bet with Kingsley) she
On the other side of the square a young (from it’s size) Antipodean Opaleye lets loose a fiery, scarlet flamed roar in greeting, startling several groups of patrons.
Draco snorts. ‘It better be,’ he says and shakes his head, glancing at Harry. ‘Only you could end up getting black mailed by a bloody ghost, Potter.’
Harry bit down on a snort of laughter. Smith, predictably, gathered up his things and stormed out of the room.

Ginny looks up at her, chewing on the inside of her mouth. ‘Draco was good for him, wasn’t he? Harry doesn’t realise it yet, but you see it too, don’t you? Harry needs him doesn’t he?’
anything to her,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘I mean, credit where it’s due, the girl is brilliant, but she’s a little too highly strung for my tastes.’
Silence is not an interesting way to spend the class. Still, Blaise works on his wandless magic and is surprised when McGonagall announces the end of the lesson sooner than he’d been expecting.
‘Good,’ he says impatiently, gesturing to the couch. ‘I’ve been here too long as it is. What’s this about?’
He’s so wrapped up in these thoughts that as he pushes his way into the vine covered door of Greenhouse Four he forgets that it isn’t empty.
They stare at each other for a long moment, smirking at each other, their eyes speaking despite the silence. Hermione raises her eyebrows and glances over at Ron. She’s not sure when this development started between Zabini and Ginny, but she certainly hopes that Ron doesn’t notice.
‘Why aren’t you—ah, sorry, Longbottom,’ she shakes her head, and pulls a sheaf of paper from between her stacks. ‘I thought I’d laid this out. Professor Sprout wrote this on your behalf.’
The keeper blinks, teetering on the edge of excitement and hesitation. Eventually, excitement wins out.
Everything, that is, except the thick, red-leather bound book that remains on her desk. She steps over to her desk, looking down at the copied book and thinks about the identical one now in the hands of one of her students.
Draco raised an eyebrow and, pulling his arm free from Harry’s grasp, smoothed down the front of his novelty t-shirt. Harry had no idea when Draco had found time to buy a souvenir shirt already, but he’s not surprised. It’s tightly fitted and damnit, but Draco looked good. Not that he didn’t
Draco looks down at Scorpius, handing him a block to chew on. ‘Scorpius is back with Astoria tomorrow,’ he says, still looking steadfastly down at his son. ‘I know a place off Carkitt Market that does quite a good vintage whiskey.’
Harry returned it and found that he suddenly didn’t care that he was practically holding hands with Draco Malfoy in front if everyone.
!’ she shouts, her voice sharp and shrill. ‘He was twelve Ron! Didn’t you ever make a mistake when you were a child? Merlin you act like one enough as it is. Why can’t you just move on?’
From the way he stares off toward the forest, Draco doesn’t think he means for any of them to hear it. Harry takes a deep breath and shakes himself.
He turns for the door and walks straight into the pink shield, bouncing off it with a startled yelp. His heart stutters, his breath catches. His hand comes up against the shield.
‘A love potion cannot change the sexuality of it’s consumer. It can, of course, still cause an obsessive behaviour, such as Miss Weasley displayed, but not in a romantic maner.’
‘Sorry, but I don’t understand,’ he says, reaching in to pull her out. ‘I wish I did, but I don’t. I don’t speak parseltongue.’
‘Mock him all you want,’ says Zabini darkly, ‘but you’ve never seen him loose his temper. He’s scarier than he looks. Besides, that’s not the point.’
Dora’s eyes change colour again, this time looking rather like Dumbledore’s when he’s up to something. ‘He said no,’ she says again, slower.
Potter raises his eyebrows, but there’s a growing smile on his lips. ‘Alright then,’ he says and Malfoy starts to
‘Yes,’ she says. ‘I do. You seem perfectly happy to choose and pick which details of Potter’s schooling Potter’s relatives need to know about. Not that I blame you, mind. They’re the most
‘I did,’ says Zabini, not moving a muscle to retrieve it. ‘Though I’m not sure what you want with it. There are few potion recipes in here. None that would be any use to us I’m sure.’
She wants to talk it over with Parvati—has, in fact, discussed it at length late at night—but now Parvati, at a table across from her, might as well be in another country, and well, there’s no chance she’s even
A/N: Yes, it's late. Life happens. But I've got the next four chapters lined up so we're good for the next two weeks at least (and there's even some forward movement in the next two chapters! Hazzah!)
‘Hang on a second,’ says Potter, grabbing Malfoy’s arm. He nods with his head to a group of shops just off from the food vendors. ‘I’ve got an idea.’

He shrugs, drops the ladle he’s using to stir a potion on the table, and casts a stasis spell on his cauldron. Then he edges out of the room.
All of a sudden Ron knows that he can’t say anything. Whatever he says while this hot burning feeling is sweeping through him won’t be good and he knows he’ll never be able to take it back. He clenches his teeth over all the things threatening to spill out. All the anger and hurt and fucking
They stumble into the wall, and Harry grins and happily complies. Malfoy is a strange mixture of soft and fierce, trailing light kisses across Harry’s bruising jaw, before coming back to Harry’s mouth and snogging him soundly.
‘If you’re going to be this dense then we’re never going to survive working together long enough to do anything useful,’ Draco mutters, rolling his eyes.
She glances toward the back door, wondering which of the fields her reluctant visitor is roaming about in this time. For the briefest moment, she considers sending for Arthur, or even Bill, but she dismisses the idea as soon as it occurs to her. Once upon a time, Malfoy—
In which Draco wakes up with company, Harry has a crises of identity and things hit boiling point for Theo.
The click of the camera shutter had almost surprised Colin, he hadn’t even realised he had his finger on the shutter. The soft glow of the setting sun, casting shadows of light over the two of them, seeming to amplify their laughter. The natural, easy way they sat together in the grass, the snitch fluttering between them. The composition of it had called to Colin and he’d snapped the shot on instinct.
Harry nods, feeling a tiny surge of guilt. The guy just wanted help. There was no harm in giving him some advice.
‘Perfectly horrendous,’ says Draco matter-of-factly. ‘Somehow, Pansy’s mother managed to talk mine into horse breeding, so I came home to find my horse pregnant and unrideable. Not that she bothered to talk to me before getting my horse knocked up. And, of course, Winter needs constant attention so we’re stuck at the Parkinson’s—not that she bothered to tell me
Those of you who follow my tumblr will know that a few months ago my dog was diagnosed with cancer; so we had to go through all the (expensive) things that go with surgery and recovery. I am happy to say that she is fully recovered and cancer free (YAY) but it was a stressful time for my family and I had very little time to write as my dog is very stubborn and required almost constant supervision to make sure she didn't re-tear any of her stitches.
did she think him any sort of role model? Every choice he has made in life has led to nothing but disappointment and, in some cases, death.
‘If you recall,’ Minerva snaps. ‘Potter’s been attacked several times of late. Not to mention the fact that his
She sighs. When he’s ready he’ll tell her what’s on his mind. For now, she’ll just have to settle for helping him with his homework.
Worry tightens Ginny’s chest and she struggles to control her breathing, to not let the dark thoughts surge up through her and slow her down. She keeps the boys just within her sights, her legs burning, her feet pounding against the marble floors.
Of course, when the Gryffindor’s show up, the impasse breaks. Most of them reach the group already milling about and slow to a halt, glancing between the students and the door curiously.
His voice cracks over the word, but it’s enough to bring him back to himself, just a little bit. His breathing evens out on it’s own. Malfoy raises an eyebrow, studying him.
‘Uh, I’m not…sure,’ says Potter, glancing around again—as if he might find the answer to Draco’s question in the furniture around the dorm. He rubs the back of his neck. ‘I think I was in the hospital wing.’
Confusion burns through Ron. He frowns, unsure what to do—he’s never seen Harry like this before. ‘But you broke up with him?’
‘Don’t sneer at me, Severus,’ she snaps. ‘You of all people should know how long a “crush” can burn.’
‘Say,’ says Potter, peering curiously at Malfoy’s shopping bag. ‘What else did you buy at the store?’
Draco rolls his eyes and with a wave of his wand, puts the fires out again. ‘Harry, calm down. You’re setting everything on fire.’
For once in his life Ron doesn’t react. He doesn’t yell, doesn’t threaten, doesn’t even move. He sits back in his bed, frowning over at them, not saying a single word.
Potter laughs, quiet and mirthless. ‘You don’t know why I’d save you?’ he glances up. ‘You haven’t been listening to me at all, have you?’
He eats his pastry and drinks his chocolate, embarrassment clawing at him. How is it that despite the fact that they’ve agreed to get along (as a condition of them coming back to school), every time Harry tries to talk to Draco—to
Malfoy closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. ‘But you are going to fight, right? You’re not just going to give up.’
of the matter is a much easier question to ask. Books are not usually the sort of gift that draws a person out the kind of slump that Draco has been well and truly entrenched in. The only reason they
Blaise rolls his eyes. ‘No,’ he says. ‘I’m not upset. I just don't understand. I guess things are just different this year.’
The life of a painting is a fairly boring one. Even more so when that painting is tasked with spying on a sixteen year old boy. Phineas scowls.

Hermione frowns, biting her lip again. She wants to offer some word of encouragement or comfort, but since Ron’s awkward and rather public breakup with Lavender, she finds herself hesitating whenever she wishes to speak with him. Her voice betrays her, stuttering and catching in her throat so that she is suddenly unsure of how to act around him.
‘Fuck,’ Draco growls behind her. She hears his footsteps crunch through the birdseed on the floor, and then his voice right behind her. ‘What the hell do you want? I’m not really in the mood to listen to you gloat so if that’s what you want kindly fuck off.’
He sighs again, and places her gently into the new home he has built for her. ‘Merlin knows it would be useful if I
‘Relax, I don’t mean right now,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘But soon. We can’t have you thinking that Hogwarts is an adequate home. There has to be
She casts a quick glance over the pile, ignoring Bella as she tears into the small pile of carefully wrapped gifts (that Narcissa had
Hagrid is beaming, bright and watery eyed. ‘Always knew you’d be great with the creatures ‘Arry. Ever since Buckbeak. An’ I know yer want to be an Auror, but give it a think, will yer? I reckon you’d be a great Dragon Tamer.’
You're getting this one a day early this week, because I'm exhausted and might not be up to posting it later. Hope you enjoy!
Instead all he can focus on is the utterly miserable look on Harry’s face as he sorts through the copious amount of red, heart shaped letters that have landed in front of him. People stare at him and whisper—as if none of them have ever heard of subtly—and Harry’s shoulders turn inwards.
Harry all but dragged the two of them there. With all their deliberating, they weren’t the first ones to get there. There was a small crowd of Hogwarts students already gathered at the base of the monstrous ride, gaping up at the contraption that so many Muggles were lined up eagerly to ride.
She makes a small noise in the back of her throat and finally glances back. ‘What makes you think I have one?’
Hermione frowns. She’s about to say something about getting along, when Luna reaches over and lays her hand on top of his, stilling the restless drumming of his fingers. He swallows and glances up at her. His expression is tightly controlled, and yet there’s an emotion in his eyes that Hermione isn’t used to seeing there.
‘You know,’ says Draco, turning around to face him. ‘You think you’re so heroic and so self-sacrificing but you’re really just selfish!’
Harry looked back at him, only to find Draco far closer than he had been a moment ago. He blinked and swallowed nervously. ‘Right?’
‘Do you feel exposed now?’ Draco half thinks he means to tease Potter, but instead it comes out curious, with none of the usual sting.
Harry watches him, trying not to be obvious, but unable to keep from staring. As unable as he’s been all year so far.
‘Just leave me alone,’ Ron says, looking away again and turning back toward the stairwell. ‘I’m not in the mood.’
‘Not that I blame you,’ she continues, as if he hasn’t spoken. ‘He’s certainly nice to look at. I mean, he’d have to ditch those
‘I hope you don’t mind a detour first, little book,’ she says, her footsteps light as she heads out of the library. ‘But I have a feeling that you’re important to more than
The air shifts again, sending static tingling along Luna’s arms. Draco is staring down at one of the pages, the colour draining away from his face and leaving him ashen and shaking.
‘Well…uh, this thing with Malfoy,’ Ron breaks off and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Look I’m not gonna pretend that I understand, okay? Maybe you can forgive everything he’s done and all the shit he’s pulled—’
Harry slips a hand up his shirt, nails catching along the healed claw marks there, and Draco momentarily forgets his frustration.
Harry pushes himself to his feet. ‘You know, you didn’t have to drag me all the way out here just to—’
He pulls Harry closer and kisses him soundly. He feels Harry grin against his lips, and the pent up worry and frustration and anger culminates into a want so fierce, that Draco is pushing Harry down into the grass, desperate to be closer to him.
Just like that, she has her boy back, and though she’s relieved, she can’t help but look back at the small box of books sitting on the couch, and feel a lingering tinge of jealousy.
She gets up, gesturing at Draco with a tilt of her head. He follows, trudging unenthusiastically into the lounge and over to the couch. Narcissa purses her lips.
anyone, just…’ Harry glances at Neville and runs a hand through his hair again. ‘I didn’t want you to hate me.’
‘Well I dunno,’ says Ginny, finding her voice again. ‘When your friends take it so well, what’s there to be ashamed of?’
‘What’s wrong with you this fine winter afternoon?’ Blaise asks, his voice entirely too cheerful for Draco’s liking.
To be honest I’m not really satisfied with this chapter. It’s not quite where I wanted it, but I’m sick of looking at it so I’m moving on. Next chapter will be out on Sunday, and I think you’ll all enjoy that one.
‘Young Mister Malfoy,’ says Albus and, just to see how she reacts, adds, ‘though I’ve no doubt Harry will be along to make sure he is well tended to.’
Silence. He keeps his eyes screwed shut, bracing himself for the laughter or the scathing insults. Except they don’t come.
For a moment, he’d even smiled, not realising at that moment what it was he had captured. Not until he’d glanced up from his camera to see Harry lean over and press a soft kiss to Malfoy’s cheek.
Longbottom, always twitchy in situations of potential conflict, clears his throat noisily. ‘Er, see you, I guess?’ he says, though Theo doesn’t know to who.
from the kiss. He looks at Malfoy’s lips, and the slight part. His breath comes in short sharp bursts and he can smell the lemon and honey scent again and it’s at once calming and terrifying.
‘I…yeah, I guess we do,’ he says in a quiet voice, running a hand through his hair again. ‘I just…he can be so, I mean…ugh. Why is this so difficult?’
Potter jerks, seeming to only just see the magic he’s summoned, and sits back abruptly—all but scrambling off Draco. He shakes the magic away from his fist, his eyes larger than usual without his glasses to obscure them. He mumbles something, his gaze flickering around the room in confusion.
Before either Poppy or Minerva (or Harry, for that matter) can object, Severus expertly manoeuvres Mr Nott from the room, ushering him out quickly no doubt before Albus changes his mind.
‘When I woke up from that nightmare,’ says Malfoy. ‘When I thought you were really dead…’ he swallows audibly. ‘I don’t know what to do anymore.’
The air is thick and hot—even through the bubble charm around her head—and a thin layer of perspiration coats Ginny’s skin, making her clothes stick to her back. In the distance something fizzles and pops and the acrid smell of something metallic tickles at her nose.
hands through Draco’s hair (and yes, Harry is aware that fantasising about dishevelling a man while he’s fretting about his son is an all new low but, hey, it’s been a while).
Harry’s chest heaves, his emotions warring over his face plain for all to see. Worry, fear, relief, guilt, and a fierce desperate wanting that has him leaning forward, as if on the verge of rushing to the young Malfoy’s side, only held in check, it seems, by the fear and guilt warring for control of his emotions.
‘Of course,’ he says and then smirks. ‘We can’t have our beloved saviour falling on his face at the Christmas Fair, can we?’
Draco flushes, silver eyes flicking away quickly before resettling on Harry’s face, his expression set in embarrassed determination.
of course. After all, she’s always been a little doubtful the whole “Chosen One” thing. Did people really expect a sixteen-year-old to defeat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? At least not until he was older. And she rather hoped they wouldn’t be fighting this war for that long.
Katie smiles and throws her leg over her broom, balancing the quaffle in her hand. Best to just forget she ever heard that conversation. At least she now she knows that Harry isn’t upset with
She takes a deep breathe and begins. ‘To put it plainly, Harry has an illness that is making him lose control of his magic. As things stand, his accidental magic is going to get worse and worse until—’ She hesitates, stumbling over the words, unable to speak them allowed in case they solidify Harry’s fate. ‘—Until he loses control. As it stands there is no known cure, no remedy, no spell that can reverse it. At least not yet.’
’N-o,’ says Poppy slowly. ‘I think…oh, to hell with it. To be quite frank, I think this display of magic was caused by something else. An underlying condition.’
‘You might as well be!’ Potter exclaims, cutting her off in sudden burst and his expression is so frustrated and imploring and stubborn, so
Draco looks back. He dunks the scrub back in the cleaning solution and says as casually as he can manage, ‘you.’
Harry shifts his weight and glances at Hermione. Impatience flashes in his eyes, and something else. Something rather like desperation. A desperation Ginny recognises.
Malfoy stands up, glaring at her, affecting an air of disgust and disinterest. ‘Keep your saviour on a leash,’ he snaps. ‘The rest of us don’t need him causing catastrophe everywhere he goes.’
‘It’s not just your lack of guardian approval,’ she says to Potter. ‘There are a dozen other perfectly good reasons that you shouldn’t go.’
. You insult me, but somehow, that makes me laugh. What the fuck is wrong with me? And what the fuck is wrong with you? And why, why do you
The chorus of cheers turns into groans of displeasure and Professor Sprout smiles indulgently as she waves them off.
Minerva rolls her eyes. ‘Not that that’s ever stopped them before,’ she says dryly. ‘You do recall their little trip over to the Department of Mysteries last year.’
‘Yeah, and why do you think that is? It’s been like this all year, and Potter has to be the reason.’
Poppy nods. ‘Oh, Minerva?’ Minerva pauses in the fireplace. ‘For heavens sake don’t mention Potter and Malfoy to Albus. Or to Severus for that matter.’
Malfoy stared at him, bewilderment flashing across his face. Though after a moment of hesitation he pushed himself away from the wall and stood next to Harry.
She runs the tips of her fingers along dusty book spines, her fingers pattering along the soft fabrics and hard covers. She rounds the corner and almost runs headlong into Malfoy and Harry.
Harry winces. The quill he is in the process of pulling out of a junior Auror’s cheek twitches and the boy sucks in a sharp breath.
He rolls his eyes and tries to shake away the disconcerting feelings. He doesn’t succeed. As he heads back out into the cold, collecting the snitch from the floor and his broom from the door, he feels every spot where Potter touched him like a firebrand burning hot along his skin.
And Ginny marvels at the lighthearted banter that flows between the players that, only a year before, would’ve been at each other’s throats.
for heavens sake? So Ron wanted to spend the day with a girl instead of fixing his friendship with his best friend. That was
Potter slips off his bed, crosses the two steps between them and kisses Malfoy right in the middle of his rant. It’s short, and Malfoy is clearly surprised, but Potter still smiles when he pulls away.
. Hermione. She always smells so nice. Like…like warm hugs and hot chocolate and you know what I mean?’
Madam Pomfrey huffs. ‘Honestly,’ she says, flicking her wand and Draco. ’That man is utterly insufferable.’
Ginny throws him an apologetic look as he gathers up his things and packs them carefully into his trunk. She notices that it’s been expanded on the inside, and that the plants he’s placing neatly back into place aren’t the only ones in there.
Except, and she pauses in her speculations, falling a step or two behind him, why would he call a girl he’s seeing, a jerk?
he’s trying to figure out if he knows what a toaster is. Blaise, for one, doesn’t have a fucking clue.
Then he’s off, sauntering through the crowd toward the broom display, easily manoeuvring his way through the bodies—as if it were his born right to be at the head of that crowd.
Ron finally stops staring dejectedly out the window, turning his head in a long, slow movement to look at his sister. Ginny’s face falls, reading his answer in his expression.
He grins at her. ‘I hear there’s a bet going around. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas are taking guesses on when they irritate a Professor into expelling them.’
Also time for a warning: This chapter contains sexual material, there is a chapter summary at the end for those who would prefer not to read.
Finally Potter stops his restless pacing and sinks back into the bed with a heavy defeat. He stares at the floor and mumbles something incoherent.
Malfoy opens his eyes, and Phineas is surprised to see pain clear in those blue eyes. Malfoy eyes inherited from his father. Everything about the boy is his father, and yet, the expression on his face makes Phineas think of Narcissa. She always did get too emotional attached.
Blaise looks up from his languid inspection of the ceiling to see Draco step through, not even bothering to close the door behind him. He makes his way across to the group of sofas recently acquired by the sixth years (an acquisition that resulted in a rather vicious scuffle between Pansy and two seventh years and yet another restructure in the power hierarchy that ruled over Slytherin house).
A surprising burst of pleased gratitude rumbles through Molly at that and she finds herself feeling almost affectionate towards the cantankerous young man now in her charge.
He chuckles. ‘In all fairness, I probably wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t already been looking for someone following us. I
McGonagall waits. She stands stoic, one eyebrow slightly arched as she stares down the entire hall, as cool and unyielding as any Slytherin. Blaise shifts uncomfortably, and glances across at Snape. The man glowers down at his food, stabbing his fork at his sausages and Blaise wonders how many arguments this “rule” caused during the night.
‘You didn’t have to pay for the shirts,’ says Potter for perhaps the tenth time since their food arrived.
The shout comes from the family room, drawing Molly’s attention away from the meal she has been preparing. A stunned silence follows that seems to echo louder than the words themselves, and, before she can even process the situation, Draco Malfoy comes storming out through the kitchen.
‘So,’ says Harry, glancing sheepishly at Draco and hoping that he attributes the delay to Harry’s clumsiness. ‘That was…fun.’
He scowls, and yanks on his sheets. The same sheets that are twisted tight around his middle, pinning him to the bed. He sits up, running a hand through his damp hair. His shirt is soaked through with sweat and his scowl deepens. He casts a quick drying spell, followed swiftly by a cleansing spell, but it’s not enough to get rid of the nightmare still clinging to his skin.
He flicks off the water, runs his hands through his hair to rid it of the extra droplets and steps out of the shower, his gaze flickering sideways to be sure Potter is still in his cubicle. Not that he has a problem being “exposed” as Potter put it. In fact, Draco has always been quite comfortable with his body. But the fresh scars on his arms are still red and angry—making an ugly mess of the black blob on his left forearm that used to be a tattoo. Potter’s seen it before, of course, but Draco has no desire to remind him of it.
‘Every day,’ says Harry, a smile in his voice. ‘Though if I’m honest, I mostly only wear it because he does.’

She shoots him a wink, before turning and heading for the door, leaving him with his tea and his toffee and his wistful sigh that she might come back.
‘No! I mean, I guess? I suppose. I mean I have to, right? After all, normal people don’t just go around flirting and kissing guys they don’t like so…’
have an ulterior motive. How positively Slytherin of you. I suppose next you’ll be leaving out some of these books in conveniently placed locations for them to stumble upon?’
When they get to the right corridor, Harry paces back and forth along the wall with practiced ease, the annoyance fading away under the familiar motion. He thinks of the room the DA had used, and before he’s even made the third pass the door appears. Harry grins, and steps in, almost forgetting about Eric until the boy follows him.
Draco has a strange sensation of their roles being reversed. For the last several weeks, it’s been Potter asking
She thinks about the souvenir shirts and the framed map that Malfoy hadn’t yet given to Potter by days end. Wistfully, she wishes she could be there to see Potter get it.
She raises an eyebrow at him, stepping across the threshold with the same poise and dignity as she had almost six months ago. Although this time she is, mercifully, alone.
‘What, hand jobs?’ Blaise asks, scoffing. ‘I’m sorry but in what universe are handies better than sex?’
She raises an eyebrow, noting the action with interest. It wasn’t one of his usual tics, and she wonders where (
With a sigh he reaches out to pick up the little owl carving and set it carefully on his bedside table. Deciding that he’d rather bear his housemates curious glances than risk sitting alone thinking about Potter and his irritating habit of defying expectations for even a single second longer, Draco swings his legs over the edge of his bed and pulls open the curtains.
‘And what of your mother?’ Severus asks. ‘What will you tell her when your actions put her in Azkaban?’
She finds Harry back at their table (Ron has disappeared somewhere with Lavender) finishing off his essay. There’s a small smile on his face as he works, and Hermione pauses before she joins him at the table.
Smooth and swift, Theo magic’s some of his and Daphne’s potion straight into Blaise’s cauldron. Daphne—studiously perusing her notes—doesn’t seem to notice. Neither does Slughorn.
Later, after Harry has fumbled his way through the rest of the days classes (drawing more attention to himself since the start of the year), Ron and Hermione sit waiting for him to get back from his second mysterious meeting with Dumbledore.
And why, exactly, has Potter taken the time to memorise the obnoxious coffee order of someone he supposedly hates?
Dora rolls her eyes. ‘Okay, once again, didn’t one of your best friends marry a girl who hated his guts through most of school? And secondly,’ she whacks him upside the head. ‘Don’t be an arse!’
The adrenaline that was starting to fade kicks back up a notch, and Harry’s heart thuds painfully in his chest as Malfoy reaches up and brushes a finger across the bruise that’s already starting to form on Harry’s jaw.
‘I didn’t make the songs,’ says Harry, sighing. ‘I just stuck them on the CD. It’s really not hard.’
Colin glances down. He sees one his favourite shots of the week. Two figures spiralling around each other, like a dance of red and green across the sky. Colin swallows nervously.
Welcome to the Scamander Emporium: Home to the Beautiful and Misunderstood Magical Creature, in which Harry is clumsier than ever and Draco does something unexpectedly nice.
Harry, leaning over his ingredients slicing carefully, looks up. He takes off his glasses and wipes the goop off, glancing over at Malfoy who is covered head to toe in bright blue potion. The boy is scowling furiously, glaring at his cauldron. Harry winces.
Potter’s grin broadens, looking back and forth between Draco and Pansy. ‘Do you guys practice your outraged responses?’ he asks, reaching for some bacon. ‘Because they’re eerily similar.’
Anyways, I'm back and determined to finish this. This story is by no means over - I plan to go all the way through to the end of 7th year and considering 6th year has 46 chapters so far and isn't even finished...that's still a lot of story to cover.
He offers Malfoy a sad smile, and turns and heads toward the door, weaving through the tables in the room. Malfoy stares after him, conflicting emotions warring across his face.
‘Well, seeing as your decision directly affects the rest of my year in muggle studies, I figured I have a right to know.’
She suspects, from the unchanged expression on Hagrid’s face, that he doesn’t hear the comment. He waves he two of them ahead, seeming pleased that they’re having such a good time.
Hagrid rubs at his beard again. ‘Mebbe, hard teh say though, they been ‘ere so long now. They’re not used teh flyin’ out fer the season.’
‘They aren’t talking about Romilda anymore,’ says Hermione, frowning as Ginny rolls over to stare over at Harry in the next bed (completely oblivious to everyone else in the room).
A bright splash of colour catches Luna’s eye and she turns, spying the corner of a red, leather bound book beneath the nearest shelf of tomes.
Hermione watches them for a moment, carefully placing her own handful of gathered ingredients on the table with deliberate slowness.
Potter gapes at him and then, to Deans furious surprise, he starts to laugh. Ginny shoots him a glare.
They stare at each other for a long moment and Theo’s heart starts up again. It doesn’t beat fast, but the steady rhythm intensifies against his chest.
‘I…I was looking for Malfoy,’ he says, faltering as he peers past her into the shadows of the owlery.
‘Merlin Potter, you are a walking catastrophe,’ groans Malfoy, but there’s a smile on his face that Neville has never seen before. He leans down and finishes the kiss that Harry started.
She doesn’t look at Bella. Doesn’t think of what’s to come. Doesn’t even wonder what Lucius would say to her offering Draco an escape route. All she’s doing is giving Draco some privacy. That’s it. That’s
‘Surely,’ says Albus, with as much a significant glance at the rest of the room as Poppy had given him. ‘There is a better alternative? Something a little more moderate, perhaps.’
Two auror’s are engaged with Bellatrix, who is still laughing like a madwoman, and beyond her, in a widening pool of blood, lay Harry Potter and—to Severus’s horror—Draco.
Colin takes the photos, clutching them back to his chest as if to protect them from any sudden hex of retribution.
She smirks. ‘Oh darling, since when has evidence ever mattered in this school? You and I both know all it takes is a single rumour to take down an enemy.’
Ron sighs and starts toward the door after Luna and his sister. Hermione, however, lingers. She’s watching Harry. Seeing the tension in his shoulders, the pain in the way he holds himself, and the deep misery in his eyes. As if Sirius had died all over again.
‘Zabini?’ she asks. ‘Merlin, Ron. Zabini is harmless. And whatever he said about me, I can take care of it myself. You think I can’t handle Zabini? I don’t need you to fight my battles for me Ron, and I certainly don’t need you beating people up.’
Malfoy’s muscles tense, and Harry makes to grab him a second too late. Malfoy launches himself at the Ravenclaws, slamming into the group and sending two of them sprawling. Somehow he stays on his feet and takes a swing at a third.
No doubt worried that she was going to start grilling Harry about this like she had about Harry’s missing hours in Diagon Alley.
Surprise shoots up her spine like an electric shock, rattling her down to her bones. ‘No,’ she says. ‘What happened?’
Draco leans up on his elbow. Harry’s gaze flickers over to him, squinting in an attempt to make him out without his glasses. Draco sits up. He pulls on his tie, tugging it loose and undoing it completely.
‘That’s because you only think about yourself,’ says Vince, managing to sound confidently superior, even as he flicks his magazine back open to a double page spread of a woman’s bare chest.
‘Very well,’ says Minerva. ‘In that case, seeing as you two can’t seem to behave in an adequate manner when separated, you can now look forward to getting better acquainted. Consider yourselves partnered in all subjects from this moment on.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘No,’ he says. ‘And that classroom, that was my fault. I, er, I messed up a spell. Lost control of it.
‘And I told you to stop being such an idiot!’ she snaps back. She points at Malfoy. ‘At least he’s trying.’
Severus rolled his eyes. ‘Sorry Narcissa,’ he mutters under his breath. ‘But there are some things even I cannot undo.’
It takes saying the words out loud for him to realise. He’d said it himself, hadn’t he? Draco could have used the door. But instead…instead he threw rocks at Harry’s bedroom window. In the middle of the night. To drag him off for a midnight skate in the park, just the two of them. With hot chocolate and warmed danishes and a sunrise to boot.
‘Don’t worry, Miss Granger,’ says Madam Pomfrey, tucking Ginny in with expert hands. ‘They’ll be asleep before long, and by the time they wake the potion will have worn off.’
Ginny’s hands tremble. A touch startles her, and she looks up at Zabini, tears stinging her eyes as he takes her hand and squeezes.
Her lips quirk and her eyes take on a spark of cheekiness that is all to reminiscent of her brother’s.
She raises herself up out of her stall to get a better look at them, trying to decide whether or not she should hide or attempt to scare them off. Boy’s taunts were always the worst.
Seeing that Draco had changed his mind four times over the course of the morning—and once more in the half hour before class—Blaise isn’t sure which book Draco had actually chosen.
Draco rolls his eyes, irritation curling around his spine as he tries to remember where the bloody hell he put his towel and whether or not he can summon it without this interloper noticing.
Harry sighs. Quick footsteps approach, but he doesn’t look up from the piece of armoured fabric he’s working on.
Out of reflex, Draco glances up, dragging his thoughts away from libraries and fires and the warmth of someone sitting close—
Cold slams into her, and it’s all she can do to keep hold of the breath in her chest. She can taste salt on her lips, but she braces herself and opens her eyes. They burn instantly, but she squints against the salt water and sees Harry floating in the water just feet from her, his heavy quidditch gear dragging him down.
‘You’re right,’ says Zabini, and Lavender glances back in time to see him withdraw his wand. ‘It is.’
Malfoy merely raises an eyebrow at him. Somehow, unkempt and with the dirt smeared across his face, he still manages to terrify Neville.
A huge shimmering dome stretches high above them in an arc. Heards of flying horses swoop overhead, braying and calling out to one another as they glide gracefully once, twice above the entrance square before disappearing over the tops of a line of trees.
The quiet stretches out between them. Malfoy continues to stare up at the ceiling while Potter stares off into the distance with a slight frown. Phineas is getting ready to leave, eager to give Albus this news so he can at least have a break from spying on teenagers, but then Potter breaks the silence.
‘What the hell are you doing?’ Peakes yells at her and she hangs by her hands off her broom, her feet brushing the water.
He stands and she follows him, depositing the ingredients back on the table. Harry glances at Malfoy, flushes, and drops his gaze back to his notebook.
sex?’ scoffs Blaise, and he shakes his head. ‘Isn’t the whole point to…catch the snitch, as you so eloquently put it.’
What Blaise wouldn’t give to have a couple of those handy Extendable Ears he’s heard the Weasley twins selling.
Hagrid, taking notice of the conversation behind him, turns slightly to explain with a chuckle. ‘Can’ have signs up ‘ere, ‘Arry. It’s London. I reckon them muggles’d get a fright if they knew what was in ‘ere.’
She levels him with her sternest, no-nonsense glare. ‘Quite frankly, if I have to put up with one more day of your moping, I may very well punch you,’ she says, and then offers him a quick smile.
’I’m sorry!’ Harry shouts, and there’s more than just anger in his voice, but Ron can’t focus on it, he can’t focus on anything except the fact that Harry was once again keeping things from him. ‘I’m sorry I told Ginny and not you. I’m sorry you found out this way. But I can’t help it, Ron! This hasn’t exactly been easy for me to deal with you know!’
‘Hey,’ he says, and gestures to his parchment. ‘Think I actually did a good job. You might be proud of me.’
She waits for him to speak, to break the quite scratch of her quill with whatever is bothering him. She knows better than to push him. He’s like a thestral. Quiet, mistrusting and easily spooked. He has to come to her. Just like with the panic attacks, and the crush on Malfoy.
it’s hard not to notice), Draco doesn’t look away from Theo. Theo keeps his breathing even, his expression carefully neutral but for the slow, deliberate smirk he gives Draco.
Harry finds a spare pillow somewhere around his midsection and, braving the cool night air, flings his arm (and the pillow) out of the scratchy warmth of his blankets. His aim (if wildly throwing a pillow out into the air can be called aim) is true, and it lands with a satisfying thump, punctuated by yet another tap on the window.
Luna hides a smile, turning away so Draco doesn’t see. He’s too focused on insulting Ron to realise that his words are betraying him. All this talk of “we” and “us” only serves to reaffirm what Luna already knows. No matter what Harry has supposedly said, Draco cannot leave him.
The trees themselves are ancient and enormous, reaching up toward the peak of the dome and blocking out most the light. Their branches are adorned with hundreds of floating lanterns, each coloured with a different coloured light, casting a multicoloured glow on the ground below.
Draco sits patiently in front of him and waits. Waits until the boy’s eyes are open. Until the realisation and fear flash across his face as he tries to move his arms and finds them tied to the chair. Until he looks up and sees Draco. Sees the wand and Draco’s hand, pointed levelly at Eric’s chest.
His muscles tense, though the answer isn’t wholly unexpected. There are few reasons that Narcissa Malfoy would owl him to meet her alone on the last day of Christmas Holidays, and they
Harry jerked awake, gasping as something sharp and stinging dug into his hips. He scrambled to get away, only he was trapped, caught in something tight around his chest—something that constricted the more he struggled.
Theo abandons his essay, turning to look at Vince full on. ‘Millie is giving you blow jobs?’ he asks in surprise.
’We don’t always get what we want, Potter,’ says Malfoy, taking a pointed step back, pulling his arm free from Potter’s grasp.
, and he wants to be able to do stuff for her. Open doors, carry her bags, hell he’d even be happy with a picnic or afternoon stroll. But Ginny doesn’t seem to want to do
She only hopes that, whatever form the afterlife has taken for Lily Potter, that she’s out there somewhere, watching over her son.
Minerva’s interest pique’s but she lets none of it show on her face. Her gaze flicks around, scrutinising the room.
Hermione, too, glances at Luna. The girl looks so sure, so confident in her assessment. For once, rather than annoying her, Hermione takes comfort in this. At least there was one of their number who was optimistic.
Potter glances back up, a faint flush spreading across his cheeks. He turns to face Malfoy, leaning only his shoulder on the wall. ‘Yeah,’ he says and drops his gaze to his feet. ‘I wish things were different.’
? Are you joking? Merlin have you and Harry just lost your minds, have you? Forgotten everything that happened in the past? Did that whole business with the diary just slip your mind did it?’
‘Fine,’ says Draco, straightening up. ‘Like I said, it’s a complicated spell. Not that you’d Know anything about complicated spells.’ He adds under his breath.
He shoves them down, burying the memories of Lily telling them off, laughing at something James said, cooing at a newborn Harry. He swallows.
He shifts in his chair. Cleaning cauldrons. Just think about cleaning cauldrons. Except, that makes him think about Draco soaking wet. He sighs and shakes his head.
‘Yes,’ says Narcissa, trying not to frown. ‘We’re ready, Thistle. I think this year we might skip the giving gifts, and just open our own.’
‘Perhaps if someone can go along with them?’ suggests Poppy, seeing Albus’s obvious reluctance to agree. ‘Will that ease your mind?’
‘If anyone wants to listen to Potter’s love letter to me,’ says Malfoy with a smirk as he dumps the walkman back on the table. ‘Feel free.’
She tilts the book this way and that, but no, there’s definitely no title. She flicks it open. A journal?
The room goes quiet in shock and they all stare at Draco. At the destruction. He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. He’s visibly shaking, his hand clenched around his wand so hard his knuckles are white.
Blaise wonders if the boy realises how readable his expressions are. He tries to catch Theo’s gaze, but the boy is still staring morosely at this food, so Theo kicks him under the table. Theo winces and shoots Blaise a sharp glare. Blaise widens his eyes and tilts his head ever so slightly toward Potter. Theo’s looks and his eyes narrow.
Harry almost chokes on his coffee. ‘My—er.’ Harry clears his throat. ‘He’s not…er, well that is, um. Lemon slice, actually. I mean, you make a really nice one, and I think…well, he’d like that.’
‘Why didn’t you levitate him?’ she asks, ducking under Ron to slip an arm around Harry’s waist and prop him up.
Suspicions form in her mind, sifting through the recent events, the things she’s heard, making connections that seem absurd and unlikely, and yet—her gaze flicks to the book she’s just pushed aside—more and more troubling.
Potter grins and turns to the rack. ‘I don’t know which one to get. They’re all so good. What do you think?’
She waves a hand at him. ‘Oh, that was different. Your father and I were intended. That’s not to say that I didn’t do a little shopping around myself.’
‘Shut up, Greg,’ snaps Malfoy, pulling out his wand and turning back to Ron. ‘If you hit that shield, we’re all going to get thrown back into that fire.’
Still, he supposes it’s better than Pansy, whose wound up stuck next to Weasley. Which is yet better than poor Theo, who is looking horrified by the prospect of sitting in the only vacant seat remaining—next to Lavender Brown.
He shifts his gaze away from Theo, glancing around at each of the others. Greg and Vincent both go still, staring at him with identical expressions of shock.
‘Tonks is one of my usuals,’ quips Potter, and throws Tonks a grin. ‘Glad it was you and not Mundungus.’
Draco snorts and looks away quickly. He takes a more reasonably-sized bite of his own pastry and sips at the hot chocolate.
‘Ri…Riddikulus!’ he falters over the word, and the spell bounces uselessly off the skirt Bellatrix Lestrange’s robes.
‘I mean, at first she wasn’t so sure,’ admits Vince, shrugging. ‘Can be a bit much for a girl, I think.’
Theo, too, when he isn’t so self-occupied, has a mind sharper and brighter than anyone Greg has met. Not to mention Daphne, with her studious nature.
Harry’s face is crimson, and he stutters out a half hearted apology, already ducking down to grab at the things he’s just dropped everywhere. Hermione raises an eyebrow, her gaze going almost instinctively to Malfoy who is, curiously, staring at Harry with caution—as if he’s worried any sudden movements might startle Harry even further.
He frowns, mouth pulling down at the edges, and doesn’t look at her. ‘You can’t make me,’ he says softly. ‘I’ll come back.’
changed him. All week I have watched him grow more distant and ill at ease. I tried to advise him, but all I did was push him further away. He’s has
‘I thought,’ Harry gasps pulling back just long enough to ask the question nagging at the back of his mind. ‘That you didn’t approve of my “silly little crush”.’
Albus just manages to keep control of his expression and is working on a response when another voice speaks up.
‘It looks like a unicorn threw up a rainbow in here,’ muttered Ron, glancing around the room with a wrinkled nose.
Without meaning to, his gaze flicks over her shoulder to Harry. He’s watching them, an oddly unreadable expression on his face. He meets Draco’s gaze and blinks, seeming to shake himself from wherever his mind had wandered. He offers him a wan smile and gestures his head toward the castle, lifting his hand in a slight wave. Draco frowns, but doesn’t get a chance to try and keep him from leaving.
Ginny laughs and rolls her eyes. ‘You said, “she always smells so nice” but you didn’t say who? You mean Romilda? Or Lavender?’
The two boys make their way to the front of the class, neither even looking at each other. Malfoy picks up the little device off the table and turns around. He weighs it in his hand, purses his lips and glances sideways, not quite looking at Harry.
‘Abraxan are powerful horses,’ says Hagrid, impressed that the young Mr Malfoy could manage such horses.
Draco nods. ‘Thank Blaise. He stopped me.’ He takes a deep breath and looks up at the sky. ‘I knew I should have just stayed in bed.’
‘Sorry!’ he shouts, the words whipping away from him as he twists sharply to the left and dives hard after a flash of gold.
She chuckles again. ‘If you like,’ she pauses, and then adds in a slightly more serious tone. ‘Though, perhaps we keep this just between you and me, hm?’
Weasley takes a step back, his face white beneath the angry red blotches on his cheeks. He glances at Draco, and Draco lifts his chin, putting as much disdain and contempt into his expression as he can manage.
Draco rolls his eyes. He glances back over to the rest of the class, only to accidentally meet Weasley’s gaze. The red head is glowering in their direction, his fists clench. Draco merely raises one eyebrow and takes a pointed sip from his coffee. Weasley’s scowl deepens and he turns away, kicking at the grass and ignoring the panic around him.
‘An Occamy,’ repeats Hermione, surprised. ‘Those are rare. And aggressive. I do hope you were careful.’
The wrapping paper splits, tearing down the middle, exposing the light silver and soft gems of the necklace hidden inside. No.
‘Oh, hello,’ he says with a smile. ‘Sorry, I wasn’t expecting anyone to be here. Usually people clear out pretty quick. Did you have questions?’
Not to mention putting Potter in the mix. The boy attracted trouble no matter where he went. Sending him into the midst of some of the more dangerous (and, yes okay Newt,
Her lips purse, though she seems unsurprised by his knowledge. ‘Yes,’ she says curtly, and glances at the other occupants in the room pointedly.
He shakes his head and heads into the locker rooms. The showers are going and Ron’s about to call out to let Harry know he’s there, when he hears someone who is not Harry talking.
He’s stopped slicking it back, and it falls around his face in fine, loose, white strands. Harry, despite his flair of temper (or perhaps because of it), has the sudden impulse to run his hands through those strands. To tighten his fingers through them and find out what Draco Malfoy’s lips
The door bangs open again, and Poppy glances toward it, unsurprised to see Minerva stalking into the room. Surprisingly, there’s no sign of Albus. Poppy glances across at the two files—Malfoy’s is open as the results of Poppy’s spells self-record in the file—and recalls all the times she’s tried to approach Albus about the issue of Potter and Malfoy. An idea forms in her mind, and suddenly she’s quite glad that Albus hasn’t bothered to show up.
‘Yeah, but this was like, a full on fight. Malfoy tried to take out Potter, only Potter got to him first.’
Malfoy sits against the headboard of his bed, his knees drawn up to his chest, staring fixedly at the end of his bed. He hasn’t moved or spoken since they got there and Ginny isn’t sure if he’s in shock or if he’s just trying to keep his emotions from showing.
Draco raises a brow and then winces. Along with the split lip, he has a cut across his brow and the start of a black eye. Harry leans forward to inspect it, frowning.
at Harry. There’s a moment of silence. Harry sighs, but he says nothing, just turns and shuffles away. Draco glances across the room, watching him go. Harry’s shoulders are hunched and taut, and something heavy and uncomfortable settles into Draco’s gut. He clenches his teeth.
‘But he’s sad,’ Ginny mutters. ‘You need your friends when you’re sad. To hold your heart together so you don’t break. I don’t want him to break. He’s my best friend.’
Malfoy and Potter both look surprised. They glance at each other, baffled, but the minute their eyes meet they look away again.
It’s the wrong thing to say. He knows it the instant the words are out of his mouth, and it’s only years of knowing Draco, of seeing how he operates, that allows Theo to throw up the shield in time. Draco’s spell—nonverbal and invisible—slams into with with enough force to send Theo stumbling backwards.
Potter laughs, surprise making his voice carry, and Blaise sees several students from other houses turn to stare.
That’s why, when Harry’s gaze flicks away from Malfoy with that nervous tightening across his shoulders, she begins to worry. She can’t help it.
He stares at her, arms still crossed, leg jigging restlessly as he leans agains the doorframe and considers her conditions. ‘Fine,’ he says.
Bit by bit the rest of his house trickles down into the Common Room, but no one seems to notice Draco’s absence. No on, that is, except Blaise, who looks around the common room with a slight frown.
The spell holding Theo snaps and he staggers forward, almost falling on his face. Draco turns abruptly and flings something vivd and red at the nearest bed. The room explodes into feathers and bits of tattered fabric.
Harry merely twitches in response, the well of magic circulating him in fluctuations mirroring his conflicting emotions. It shows itself in flickers of sparks and little embers of fire spilling forth from his hands. Albus watches in morbid curiosity, at once impressed by such a sudden eruption of power, and concerned by how obviously little control Harry has over it. He had thought the situation more under control than it apparently is.
The whole situation is baffling. Here he is, trying to make amends with Harry and show him that he can support this stupid relationship, and now, after
kissed you. That kinda voids his little “it’s not going to happen” speech, right? Obviously he likes you, otherwise he’d have just kept flirting with you to mess with you. The fact that he told you it was a bad idea means that he
Potter is sitting cross legged on the end of his bed, watching as Malfoy works on some device or other with his wand. He has a frustrated expression on his face, but he grins when Potter laughs.
Narcissa’s progeny isn’t much to look at up close, but seeing as he and that Tonks girl are all that’s left of the Black family line (excluding Potter, of course—he doesn’t count) Phineas can only hope that the boy has
Somehow he manages to hook his foot around one of the visitor chairs sitting against the wall. He pulls it toward him and falls in. In a slow, clumsy motion that takes far too much of his energy, he swoops his blankets around so that they manage cover him sitting in his chair, and Potter curled up on the edge of the bed. The last of his energy seeps away from him and his head drops back onto Potter’s arm. Darkness clouds his mind and, though somewhere at the back of his mind—very far at the back—his brain is telling him that this is a
‘I…Sorry. I mean, you know, if he’s caused you any trouble or anything. I know he can be, er, difficult.’
‘You know I didn’t mean it,’ he mumbles, casting his eyes off to the side, resting his wrist on his leg and twirling the leaf between his fingers.
‘What? The train? He didn’t do—oh,’ says Harry, straightening up as some of the embarrassment dies away. ‘He didn’t do anything to me on the train, he helped me.’
As he suspects, she rolls her eyes and gives him a real answer. ‘Ten galleons…and your mother’s rune book. One day, no questions.’
I have just started back at work part time but I am hoping to keep up the posting pace of 1-2 times a week for the foreseeable future (but, as you know, life can sometimes get in the way so there may be the odd week where I don't post at all). My aim is to have the rest of the story written before the start of November and continue posting at least once a week until it's all uploaded; on that note, do you prefer once or twice a week posting?
‘Mr Potter,’ she calls and he whips around so fast she’s surprised she doesn’t hear the crack of a broken bone.
He shakes his head and grins to himself. ‘Sorry Harry,’ he mutters under his breath, and continues on his way.
The one on the right glances about with Potter’s curious expression on his face. Malfoy’s disinterested on glares at Hagrid’s back and mutters something under his breath. Potter glances sideways at him, a small grin quirking his lips until Malfoy catches him looking and then Potter’s gaze snaps away.
‘No,’ says Poppy her voice heavy and tired. ‘No, not yet. Not until I’ve had a chance to assess his mental state. He was managing the PTSD, but I fear this will only exacerbate his panic attacks. Now that his magic has linked into the attacks, we can’t very well send him back into a potentially volatile environment without a strategy in place.’
That relief had been cut short the moment she began to read in earnest. The moment she began to understand.
Thoroughly done with this conversation, Severus turns and stomps across the room, his fury peaking too high for him to deal with Albus’ nonsense.
Especially seeing that Blaise has taken to noticing every little thing Draco does now. Not that Blaise notices the things that Greg notices. No one does.
By the time Draco steps back into the kitchen, Harry has managed to calm down. His hair, as usual, is a mess, and throughout the entire slice-baking process, Molly has to resist the urge to Scourgify flour from the wayward tangle of almost-curls. When Draco pauses in the doorway, one hand still on the door as his eyes latch onto Harry and go wide, she suddenly finds herself very glad that she didn’t attempt to clean the boy up.
Colin flushes. He thinks about that moment, seeing the boys land, seeing them roughhouse, bumping shoulders and shoving each other as they walked back to the locker rooms. It had surprised Colin, to see them this way. Playful, not mean. Then the snitch got away from Harry, and Malfoy had taken off after it, abandoning his broom in the grass. They had chased it for ten minutes, laughing and cutting each other off until, in one big stumbling moment, Malfoy had gotten hold of it, only for Harry to trip and send them both crashing to the ground.
Weasley’s fists are clenched, and despite Potter’s restraining hand, he leans forward toward Malfoy.
Hogwarts is full of melancholy. As if the castle itself is crying out in sorrow. It follows Luna, like the shadow of a raincloud that won’t be dispersed no matter how hard the sun shines, how brightly the birds sing, or how sweet the soft breeze smells.
He does, awkwardly dropping to the chair. He glances at Hermione, making a face. He hasn’t seen Harry since that morning, when Madam Pomfrey kicked everyone but Harry out of the Hospital Wing. Hermione knows they haven’t had a chance to talk. She also knows that Ron is still worried that Harry is still angry with him.
He tries not to think too much about the content of Draco’s note. In fact, he tries not to think about Draco at all. Ever since the afternoon by the forest, thinking about Draco tends to lead to trouble. The kind of trouble that results in Harry have to stay seated for longer than necessary. It’s awkward to say the least. Still, he doesn’t regret. In fact, they’ve repeated the incident three times so far and every time Harry is surprised by how much he enjoys it.
Potter when he’s tasked with the mission of killing Potter’s mentor? It’s so absurd it’s hysterical.
‘What is that?’ asks Ginny, her voice soft, her face understanding that there is some significance to this book.
Earnie leans over to her and says in a low voice. ‘I wonder if we can ask Professor Burbage for copies of those books. I’m interested in how dissimilar they are.’
When she looks back at him, he flushes crimson and concentrates on his coffee, taking a sip with far more concentration than is required.
It goes through. She smirks, sending Zabini a return wink. He shakes his head, but offers her an impressed smile. The score lights up 80-40 to Gryffindor. The crowds are cheering—most of the stands in favour of Gryffindor—and somewhere above her she hears Harry’s familiar whoop of delight.
Draco flushes, but his shoulders stay stubbornly straight, his jaw set in determination as he peers up at Harry. ‘I found a way for us to fix the issue with our potions experiment, but I need your help.’
Summoning his wand, he levitates the parcel out and then, carefully, with dragon-hide clad hands, he peels back the paper.
‘No, not quite a journal,’ she says, peering at the first page. ‘A book of letters.’ Her eyes catch the familiar scrawl of elegant handwriting and she knows, despite there being no name printed on beneath the “this book belongs to” marker, exactly who this book belongs to.
‘We’re not,’ she says. ‘Not really. But you forget, I’ve spent a decent chunk of the last year basically stalking him.’
Ginny shoots him a grin. ‘Gee really? I’d have never guessed,’ she says with a teasing smile. ‘C’mon Harry, lighten up. It’s Halloween.’
Harry dropped his hand away from his face and sat up. Smith glared at him from the next bed over, his wand in his hand.
He doesn’t respond. He doesn’t even look up. She flicks her tail, irritation tightening along her scales. She taps her horn against the glass. Annoyed, she sends a burst of magic into the glass.
Surprise makes Draco jerk and he gapes at Severus, clearly stunned by Severus’ accurate knowledge—ha, so clearly he wasn’t honest with Albus about
‘Hm, there was a student poking around after visiting hours the other weekend,’ she says, tilting her head, her gaze flicking up to the ceiling as it does when she’s pretending to think about something important. ‘But he scurried off fairly quickly when I approached.’
Slughorn coughs expectantly and Potter’s head snaps back up, as if he’s only just remembered they’re in the middle of class. He blinks owlishly and rubs at his glasses.
Blaise’s eyebrows shoot up. Considering this is probably the longest conversation the two of them have ever had without it coming to insults, Blaise has to agree with that statement.
Hermione frowned down at the map in her hands. ‘It’s all the way on the other side of the map. I think we should go through Carnival Lane, working our way up to—’
Back in reality, the girl stalks away from the table, her face flushed red. Behind her Malfoy is smirking as he watches her go. Harry casts him a grateful look, his shoulders relaxing in relief now that the unwanted advances have been deterred.
‘You do realise that’s what the souvenir shop is for, don’t you? So you can keep something other than that flimsy bit of paper.’
Draco raises one eyebrow and uses a thumb to clean away the smear of lemon curd. Harry swallows, red swarming up his neck into his hairline. ‘That’s because no one ever taught you how to be clean,’ Draco says dryly. ‘Well, that is, until you got here.’
‘Just, not concerned enough to take him to a hospital,’ Harry points out, unable to resist the opportunity to make a dig.
‘So, you see,’ says Harry, his voice thick and tear choked. ‘It’s too late. I can’t let him be a spy for me. I can’t let this keep going when I’m not even going to be around…’ He scrubs a hand over his face, sucking in a sharp gasp. He shakes his head and laughs again. ‘I can’t believe I thought I’d get through this alive. I was so stupid. How could I ever believe I might actually get what I want.’
‘Here,’ she says, fishing a potion from the various pockets in her robes. ‘Drink this.’ She tips the potion gently down his throat and too late he realises what it is.
Potter’s gaze snaps back down, and he lowers the bloody cloth he’s been holding on his nose to stare at her.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. ‘Of course you haven’t. C’mon, let’s keep moving before you get anymore job offers.’ He shakes his head and mutters something about needing coffee and Potter laughs and follows diligently behind him.
They fall into a comfortable silence, and even though she’s resolved to wait until he’s ready, she can’t help but wonder.
It’s spotless, but that doesn’t stop the suspicion from whirring in her mind. Malfoy’s behaviour is just too odd. Something else has happened here tonight.
Draco swallows and closes his eyes to the outside world again. Trying to stay locked into the moment without actually letting himself play any of it out. His own erection is growing, and his shifts, rearranging before his trousers start becoming uncomfortable.
She starts to hum, closing her eyes, but she stops, eyes flying open again when she hears a mewling, anguished cry, followed by a muffled thump. Images flash through her mind—a crying kitten, a hungry child, a wolf howling it’s despair at the moon, a lovesick man waiting for…what?—and before she can reel her imagination back in someone is brushing past her, storming off through the aisles with barely a muffled apology.
He doesn’t realise he’s spoken the words aloud until Seamus replies. ‘Whose fault?’ he asks, looking up from the essay he’s working on and following Dean’s gaze. ‘Ah,’ he says, catching sight of Harry. ‘Is that really fair though?’
‘There’s no way it was working,’ says Potter. ‘As awesome as that would be, Hermione has told me a thousand times that Muggle technology doesn’t work at Hogwarts.’
Harry blinks, his eyes wide in the darkness. Him? His dream lurks at the back of his mind, taunting him as his chest tightens in disbelief and hope.
‘No,’ he says miserably. ‘I tried to ask him, but he just told me to shut up. Then he kissed me again.’
Thistle reaches for the last gift and pauses. ‘This one has no names sir,’ she says, holding it out to him with a little frown. ‘There’s no nasties on it, though.’
Malfoy looks at her, blue eyes frowning but not in his usual way. As if she is a puzzle he can’t quite figure out. As if he hopes she is right, but doesn’t quite dare to believe she is.
Theo rolls his eyes and resumes getting ready for class, deciding that the best course of action is to pretend that none of them are there. After all, that’s how Draco has been treating
Harry glances around the busy common room and grimaces. ‘Yeah, I suppose you’re right,’ he says, and pushes up from the couch. ‘Gin, I’ll be back in a bit.’
Hermione stills, her focus pinpointing in on him. ‘A curse,’ she whispers, her thoughts racing ahead, rearranging what she thought she knew into a new pattern.
Draco is frowning at Albus, an almost offended look on his face if not for the wary doubt colouring his colourless features.
‘We were supposed to pick one after Christmas,’ says the Boy, his eyes narrowed. ‘But someone has been too busy to bother showing up.’
‘That’s alright,’ says Daphne. ‘I think the fewer eyes involved the better. I wouldn’t want my judgement to get clouded.’
‘What just happened?’ asks Harry, uncrossing his arms and staring after Mr Nott and Severus. ‘Did you … did you just let him go? Without even punishing him at all? You are going to punish him, right?’
The floor is cool against his bare feet, and he hurries to the showers, stripping off his clothes and ducking under the already steaming water with relish.
‘I...oh. Thanks,’ says Potter, his voice low and guilt-ridden. ‘You can have them back once I find mine.’
It was so awesome to hear from everyone, I was so thrilled to see so many of you still reading this story - I appreciate it so much and I'm so glad you're enjoying it as much as I am!
He sighs. ‘Dora,’ he says, and sighs again. ‘Okay, no. We don’t talk about this stuff. But even if he
Zach’s face turns beat red, and Hannah can almost hear the grinding of his teeth. ‘I have done research. Extensively. Guns are no laughing matter, you know. You know more Muggles die from guns than any other cause? They’re dangerous! And they all have them. It’s almost scary, actually. I did a thorough work up. I found how they were made, what they were used for, how many people have them, where to access them—‘
Every now and then Blaise or Daphne glance back, asking Greg a rather pointless question about homework, but really keeping the younger years within sight. By now it’s tradition. The older years protecting the younger. It’s not like the other houses, where the years can roam freely on their own, confident they won’t be targeted. In Slytherin it was different.
He rolls his eyes and stomps over to the tree, flicking the shield charm back up by way of answer. Harry settles back down on the ground beside him, leaning into Draco with his shoulder.
Potter, ever the hero, crouches down, reaching for the paper and Theo’s mind is screaming. It wasn’t supposed to be him, damnit. It was supposed to be—
Something unspoken passes between Potter and Draco, and the expression on Draco’s face eases somewhat. He takes a pointed step away from Brown—still blinking in confusion—and says,
Draco grins, glancing back at him. ‘Oh yes. I don’t think you realise how fit you are right now. Thing is I
Harry doesn’t answer. He stares up at the sky with a brooding frown, an expression that has barely left his face since his row with Weasley. Draco sighs. He’s never been very good at comforting others and for the life of him he can’t think of anything to say that won’t make the situation worse.
Pulling her thoughts away from speculations on who could possibly be more qualified to raise his spirits than his own Mother, Narcissa puts on a bright smile.
, okay? McGonagall said I could come and look at the greenhouse if I told you your detention was over so I wasn’t trying to, to, to interrupt…or anything. I wasn’t spying.’
Draco groans, relishing the sound of his own name on Harry’s lips. He leans forward again, pressing into Harry, only for them to overbalance.
almost exploded and I did it! I even went to Pomfrey!’ He takes a deep breath, lets it out and leans back against the wall, running his hands over his face. ‘Oh this is a disaster.’
She turns on her heel and runs. She’s not twenty steps away from the others when someone grabs the back of her shirt and yanks her back, just as a crate of glass potions bottles crashes to the ground in front of her. She shrieks, staggering back as liquid splashes everywhere.
‘It was? Oh your Mum was a black, wasn’t she? So that means…oh. Er. Sorry about that.’ He flushes, and rubs the back of his neck.
‘You cast a diffindo on your curtains,’ he said in a low voice. ‘That’s when the silencing charm failed.’
Malfoy’s hair is in disarray, there’s a gash on his temple, he has two black eyes and a swollen lip.
Harry nods. ‘Yeah, it’s a handy room, if you know how to use it,’ he turns and pulls out his wand. ‘Right, the basics.’
A glass jar on a nearby shelf explodes, sending a spray of whatever potion was inside all over the shelves and floor beneath it. Ron stares at it, and looks back at Harry.
‘What in the name of magic am I going to do with a pair of glasses with your prescription?’ asks Draco archly. ‘What are you even doing wondering around the castle and breaking into other house dorms without your glasses?’
As they pulled back into the station, Harry glanced across at Draco’s windswept face and saw those bright silvery eyes gazing back at him alight with fire and excitement, and suddenly wanted nothing more than to sit right where he was all day long.
‘Of course he means together,’ Malfoy says, reaching over and yanking Harry out of his seat. ‘Fear not Potter, I’ll keep ten metres away at all times if it helps keep you calm. Heavens knows I can’t afford to catch anymore of your clumsiness than I already have.’
‘I think,’ says Poppy, once they’re out of hearing range. ‘That we’ve come to the point were detention and point taking isn’t working.’
He shrugs, gaze darting away from her, like it always did when there was something he didn’t feel comfortable saying. He reaches up to adjust his scarf—the only sensible thing he’s wearing—and a faint red tinge crosses his face.
Urquhart sighs and stands up, eyeing Draco critically. ‘Zabini’s got a point. We can start practice without you, but there’s no point you being here if we don’t have the snitch.’
Potter pants, sucking in sharp but full lungfuls of air, and runs a hand through his hair. He turns and trudges toward his usual bed (bypassing two others on the way) and sits down heavily, his shoulders sagging. He leans forward, his elbows on his knees, and lets his head fall forward.
‘Much better since the phoenix tears,’ she says. ‘His core is stable. I’m…fairly confident he’ll still have use of his magic.’
Potter sighs and glances around the room, as if searching for words. ‘I didn’t tell her,’ he says, looking back at Malfoy. ‘I swear. She…she had an idea of what was going on and when she asked me about it…I just…I needed someone to talk to. You’ve been so confusing, bouncing back and forth and I, I didn’t know what to do. I’m sorry if you’re upset that she knows but she won’t tell anyone. I swear.’
Ginny waves her off, already engrossed in fixing her essay and Luna leaves her to her task, wandering off into the shelves.
‘Funny, I seem to recall you hoping I’d get eaten by giant spiders two weeks ago,’ says Harry, but he’s smiling.
She shrugs, dragging her answer out, watching for Harry’s reaction. ‘He didn’t say anything when we walked passed. Ron, of course, made some snide comment—‘
‘No,’ says Potter, his voice filled with such mortified horror that Theo can’t help looking over at them again.
did a good job? Or stuttering Quirrel who we could barely understand? Or maybe you preferred Umbridge, I mean, you
‘It’s okay,’ he says. ‘We’re gonna work it out, okay? There has to be answer. I’m sure of it. There’s always an answer.’
With tickets in hand, Zoo-goers bound passed the coffee hut and through the small gate leading into a nondescript looking park that—to any Muggle—might look like a nice place to drink a coffee.
Muffled laughter echoes out from the main wing of the Infirmary. Poppy leans back in her chair, casting a watchful eye at the mirror placed strategically in the corner of her office in order to get a better view of the main room.
‘So, I’m not an idiot. Something’s obviously got you in a twist,’ says Draco, rolling his eyes. ‘Did something happen when you got back to Gryffindor tower?’
And when he gets up the next morning, having barely slept a wink, Draco realises just how royally screwed he is.
Malfoy glances across at Harry as he straightens back up, and there’s the slightest flash of worry in his expression that looks completely foreign on his face. Something uncomfortable squirms in her gut, and she fidgets in her chair, nails drumming faster on the desk. She’s jealous. She’s jealous because—just for a moment—Malfoy had looked worried about Harry. Not worried about any rivalry. Not worried that Harry was going to mess up the class for him. Worried because Harry is quiet and upset and hurting.
‘Well,’ says Zabini. ‘That explains everything.’ He rolls his eyes and doesn’t seem to notice the glare Malfoy shoots his way.
there are pebbles being thrown at his window, only that they’ve interrupted his sleep and (more pressingly) his exploration of fine, silky hair and a sweet, smirking mouth.
Potter groans and runs a hand through his hair. ‘Well it is! But I won’t complain if that’s what it takes!
Theo looks back. Draco’s expression is stony and defeated, and yet there’s that edge to his voice and a glint in his eye and a determination that Theo has seen only once before. The only time that anyone ever stood up to Theo’s father.
‘Yes,’ says Malfoy, and a flash of that familiar disrespectful ire crosses his face. ‘Like I said. He…wasn’t feeling well. He left.’
‘What are you all still doing up? ‘ she asks, staring about at them all. ‘You’re supposed to be resting. Lay down and go to sleep, all of you. Malfoy, I mean it, if I have to cast a ward around Potter’s bed I will.’
‘You know, Mum and I used to do this all the time,’ says Draco quietly, holding his mug tightly between two hands.
‘Milly and Ginny,’ says Ginny, her eyes going faraway, even as she squeezes Romilda’s hand. ‘Oh that has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?’
At least the panic has subsided, he reflects. Belatedly, he realises he can hear more than his own grumbles of pain. Malfoy, wherever the stupid sod is, is swearing.
Poppy nods at him in gratitude, but Albus ignores it. He has already lost a child on his watch once. He has no intention of losing another.
Harry raises an eyebrow. ‘I came to see if you wanted some help,’ he says, pushing off the doorway and trotting into the room.
Hermione pulls out a book from her bag, placing it neatly onto the table in front of her, both hands resting on the cover. ‘Because,’ she says softly, glancing down at the book. ‘She can’t.’
No one did. Apparently Muggle camera’s weren’t different enough from Wizard technology for anyone to show an interest in. Hannah sighs in relief, and retakes her seat.
Theo rolls his eyes and pushes up out of bed, not in the mood for any of Draco’s relationship drama.
Draco glances across at him. He shrugs. ‘I don’t think I did, either. At least…not like this. And I wasn’t worried, at first. But then I couldn’t find you and I guess…’
She does. She tells him everything. Sitting there in the dark and the quiet, while his friends sleep, she gives him the answers he doesn’t want. Answers, that are not answers, but sentence. A life sentence, set to destroy him.
Professor Burbage closes her eyes and Lisa wonders if she’s counting to ten. When she opens them, she says, ‘Punishment or not, you are expected to listen and participate, Mr Malfoy. It’s been over a month and you’ve yet to hand in any of your homework.’
It’s only as they’re being strapped in, the attendant tightening their belts and ensuring their harnesses are locked in, that Harry felt a flicker of doubt.
Tension rolls through Draco in waves and he paces back and forth along side the magic crib. He runs a hand through his already dishevelled hair and Harry’s gaze fixates on the motion. Suddenly all Harry can think about is running
‘Neville,’ says Harry, eyes wide. ‘Erm, mind if I use the dorm for a bit? I need to talk to Gin. Alone.’
The ride dropped away from them as they plummeted back down to the ground. They twisted upside down, glided through two loop-de-loops, twirled, spun, were thrown from side to side and all throughout Harry’s heart was pounding in his chest, but not from the ride.
Potter grins, grabs Malfoy by the arm and starts toward the beast (that is at least double his size even if it is just a baby) without a hint of trepidation.
Every year Narcissa spends weeks preparing for Christmas, ensuring that every minute detail, every decoration, every event is planned to utter perfection; and every year she is rewarded with the praise and envy of her guests and friends. Most of all, she is rewarded with the happiness of her one and only son.
She saw the way his jaw clenched when he was frustrated; or the way he chewed on the inside of his mouth when he was confused about classwork or puzzling out some problem or another. She saw the quizzical lift of his brow when he was being sardonic, heard the sharp wryness of his words when he was being sarcastic or impertinent, and the cheekiness that shone from his gaze when he watched his two friends bicker—no doubt thinking of all the ways to tease them, but not going through with it as his father would have done.
He’s bloody cold damnit, and if they don’t start moving soon he’s going to freeze over. Besides, Potter’s stupid antics in the air have irritated him. Surely Pomfrey hasn’t approved him for flying yet? Three days ago the stupid sod could barely stand up let alone operate a broom in mid-air.
‘What?’ Draco blinks, his attention refocusing on Blaise with a tad of irritation and more than a little distraction. ‘What do you want?’
follow him out into the corridor, back to his dorms and into his dreams, plaguing him worse than any nightmare.
‘I said,’ says Blaise, affecting an air of aloof superiority. ‘That Granger is not my type. Your sister, on the other hand…’
Things should start to pick back up again, updates wise, so keep an eye out. I'm hoping to be back on regular weekly updates, if not more. As always, thanks for sticking with me, you guys rock, and I love that you love this story as much as I do!
‘These,’ says Professor Burbage, ignoring Potter. ‘Are two fantasy novels. One, is written by a wizard. The other, is written by a muggle. If you can tell me which one is which, with adequate reasoning, I’ll pass you for the entire year.’
and not straight up evil…well, then they might actually have a chance at getting out of this war alive.
Ginny laughs again and he sighs, running his hand through his hair and mussing it up even more than usual.
The tables aren’t visible from where they stand, but Luna can picture to two little tables shrouded in low light where she has often seen Malfoy studying, a multitude of books sprawled over the tables.
Malfoy turns around and they’re a lot closer than before, standing far closer than rivals, or even just friends. ‘Yes,’ he says in a tight voice. ‘Oh.’
Yet, over the last few months of sharing Muggle Studies with him, Hannah has begun to notice something else. Something less hero-like and more approachable.
‘Yeah, badly,’ says Harry, flushing red. ‘You make it look so easy. How did you know, you know, that you wanted to be with Dean?’
Harry stands on the threshold of the Entrance Hall, guarded gaze jumping back and forth between Hermione and Ron.
Blaise nods, but his shoulders are tense and Greg understands why. He understands that they aren’t really talking about homework. They’re talking about Theo. They’re talking about the letters Theo’s father is still sending him. The letters that have put Theo in this mood. The letters Blaise secretly made copies off, slipping into his Mother’s Grimoire to pass on to Daphne.
Draco sighs and glances back at him. ‘Potter, if we’re going to survive tonight, can we just assume that whenever I suggest something that, yes, I mean
Good luck to everyone else soldiering on through NaNo, I hope you have far more success than I am haha. Enjoy!
Ginny makes to follow him. ‘Oh,’ she says, turning abruptly and leaning over to place a quick kiss on Dean’s cheek. ‘Back in a minute,’ she says brightly before disappearing up the stairwell.
‘Reward them for doing what they should have been doing all along?’ asks Severus as if they’ve all lost their minds.
He turns, starts toward the boys dorm stairs, halts and teeters for a moment. He glances back at them, flushes again and heads for the common room door, shaking his head.
‘Pansy,’ he says, and takes a step toward her, bringing them far closer together than they’ve been in months. ‘I’m warning you. Drop it. Potter is nothing to me.’
Minerva raises her eyebrows. She hadn’t heard of anything going on with Malfoy, but then apparently neither has Severus.
Malfoy laughs, and Tonks is surprised by the genial nature of it. As if the boy—who Tonks has been led to believe doesn’t get on well with Potter—is enjoying Potter’s obvious excitement.
Greg shrugs. ‘Okay,’ he says complacently, the bag of marshmallows crinkling as he digs back through it.
Potter groans and pulls back, dropping his forehead against Malfoy’s. ‘We can’t keep doing this,’ he whispers. ‘You said it yourself, all we’re doing is going around in circles. If this is what you really want, I’m all in. But I can’t keep thinking this is happening only to have you pull away again.’
Potter trails behind her with that beseeching look on his face that is both pleading and stubborn. The pleading expression is all James Potter, from the messy hair right down to the little quirk of his lips, but the stubbornness shinning out of those green eyes is all Lily Evans.
Bright sparks of red flash across the sky in Potter’s current path and he comes to an abrupt stop mid-air, slamming on the brakes in an entirely too forceful manner. His head swivels, and then pins on them down below.
The day before Valentines Day Lavender is still stewing. Ron hasn’t apologised to her yet. He’s so distracted by whatever disagreement is going on between him and Harry that he’s barely said two words to her. Instead, he spends most of his time glaring furiously at Harry.
Both boys tense at that, and Potter ducks his head, running a hand nervously through his hair. Malfoy rolls his eyes.
Harry sighs. ‘And what will people say if you’re suddenly going around hexing people in my defence.’
Ginny steps up to the shield, careful not to touch it, and looks in at Harry, searching for any sign of injury or burn. He’s lying half on his side, pale, his wand a few inches away from his outstretched hand. Ginny swallows, her throat tight. What happened to him?
‘What’s wrong?’ Hermione asks from where she and Ron are hovering over his shoulder, (not that Ginny blames them when he’s come in looking as he is). ‘Who did you fight with?’
‘I’m afraid not,’ she says, sidling around him, letting her hand trail from his chest, around his waist and to linger on his behind. ‘I have a few errands to run,’ she murmurs in his ear. ‘But maybe next time.’
He slides a hand up the back of Harry’s shirt, fingers tracing the thin rivulets of raised skin that he’s grown to know so well. They’re a map of chaos across Harry’s back, but also a reminder of everything that’s changed between. Draco feels his pulse jolt through each of his own scars as he drags his fingers along Harry’s back.
Sorry I was late on this one. I will try to get another one out tomorrow before the weekend, though no promises.
Luna blinks, her vision swimming momentarily. A large white wolf stands in the centre of the room, shaggy and thin-looking, with an air of loneliness that clings to it’s fur, making it’s beautiful blue eyes sad and hollow. Wolves are not meant to be solitary creatures.
Both teens wince. They glance at each other and away again, neither one saying a word. Poppy raises her eyebrows at the unusual silence that stretches between them.
Draco tries to deal with his frustration at Zach Smith for outing Harry, and the resulting interest from both boys and girls.
Blaise narrows his eyes at her, wondering what exactly she would want from his mother’s grimoire. Deciding that there wasn’t much in there that could cause any harm (unless one were married and needed to get rid of their spouse, which Daphne wasn’t), he sighs and gives her a slight nod.
Dean pauses. ‘No,’ he says. ‘But I can’t just sit here while Potter’s off having secret conversations with
Tonks grinned, turning to admire the beast. It’s iridescent, pearl scales glitter under the ambient light the dome casts.
Potter jerks. His eyes go bright and wide behind his glasses. Glasses that fit his face nicer and don’t look old or broken or pathetic and Theo’s hand clenches around his wand remembering a time when Draco had given
Harry grimaces. ‘Few days ago,’ he mumbles. ‘I ran into him…well it doesn’t matter where. But he pretty much told me it wasn’t going to happen. That we should just pretend I hadn’t kissed him.’
Harry jumped, turning and finding Draco sodding Malfoy right at his shoulder. Though he had that familiar smirk plastered on his stupid pointy face, he leaned back against the rail outside the door and watched Harry, his gaze watchful and appraising as he waited for a response; waiting to see how Harry would handle this.
Ron shakes his head. ‘No, no this doesn’t make any sense. Harry, mate, what about…what about Cho? You liked her didn’t you?’
Lavender spins around. Dread drops like a heavy stone in her gut. Behind her, eyebrows raised and a grin that is more than a little malicious spreading across his stupid face, is Zacharias Smith.
Potter chews on the inside of his mouth and Poppy gets the distinct impression that he had expected this answer. That this was not the real question on his mind.
‘He’s not,’ says Potter, stepping closer to Theo. ‘We aren’t together, okay? There’s nothing—’ Potter’s voice catches and he swallows hard, shaking his head, ‘—nothing between us.’
‘You being a jerk. I mean, sometimes you really are just being a jerk. But sometimes I think you’re really just worried.’
‘Oh yes,’ says Earnie seriously. ‘I’d have expected broken bones by now. They’ve truly started to show some restraint. Harry especially, but then, that
Snape narrows his eyes. Behind him Ron is grinning, giving Harry a thumbs up and across from Ron, Hermione is giving Harry one of those “don’t-do-anything-stupid” looks that she thinks works. Around them, their own duels forgotten, various members of Harry’s House and year are watching. Most of them (the Gryffindor’s and DA members) are nodding appreciatively, never doubting in Harry’s ability to always defend.
‘Your relationship,’ says Theo and levels Draco with a faint smirk. ‘Have you told your parents yet? They must be thrilled—,’
‘Theo don’t,’ warns Blaise in a low voice, and there’s Greg right behind him, shaking his stupid head anxiously, both of them so nervous of upsetting Precious Potter and His Highness Draco Malfoy that it instantly sets a fire burning through Theo’s skin.
‘Lovegood,’ he says, and flicks a smug look across at Harry. ‘Kindly remind Potter who is the superior student here?’
She turns to face him and waits until he’s looking at her before she says, ‘If you have to really hurt people to beat
Potter, who (like everyone else) is still frowning at Draco. Draco glances down at him, his face too-pale, and seems to get control of himself. He manages to school his expression into a sneer of annoyance. Ignoring the curious gazes of their classmates, he sidesteps Potter and scoops up the ruined parcel from the floor.
Narcissa, already up on her own horse, glances across at Draco. He doesn’t notice. He shuffles around in the straw, his feet scuffing along the stone beneath as he gives Winnie a good scratch along her neck. He presses his face in close to her neck and murmurs something into her fur.
She turns and stalks out of the room, her heels clacking against the marble. Out in the Entrance Hall, footsteps echo behind her.
‘Oh for Merlin’s sake, Potter,’ says Draco, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms. ‘You really need to get better at this. Look, Myrtle, was it? We’d appreciate it if you didn’t say anything.’
‘Oh really?’ Draco asks disbelievingly, narrowing his eyes, ‘So then, you must get a lot of action?’
‘Draco?’ asks Luna, handing the book off to Ron without looking. She reaches for Draco, but he brushes her off. ‘Are you alright?’ she asks.
Remus winces. ‘Yes, sorry,’ he says, and takes the remaining seat, glancing sideways to his left. ‘Hi,’ he offers, with a tight lipped smile.
Harry frowns and presses closer again, trapping the blond between him and the sinks. ‘That’s never stopped you before.’
‘Yeah well, it’s not like a had a choice in that matter,’ Malfoy mutters, rolling his eyes. ‘And just because I’m not taking the class doesn’t mean I’m an idiot. I still have the books. Making Muggle technology work with magic is a pain in the arse, and so inconvenient.’
For a moment Neville has to be sure he’s really awake. As subtly as he can, he gives his arm a pinch.
She offers him a reassuring smile, gathering up several of the ingredients. ‘I think most of them are still usable at least.’
‘Yeah,’ he says. Whispers. ‘I…’ he licks his lips and tries again. ‘Could’ve been worse…if you hadn’t…’
Harry shrugs. ‘No.’ His gaze drops to the table, and Hermione purses her lips, frustrated that he’s once again lying to her.
‘You know,’ says Blaise in a contemplative voice. ‘There were several rumours not that long ago that some girls in our year were planning on slipping you love potions. And you did say you were eating chocolates.’
When he turns back to Harry, he pauses, as if making sure Harry has his eye son him before he moves. Hermione doesn’t hear what he says, but she sees the way Harry’s shoulders relax and assumes that whatever is going on between them they’ve decided to do what they always do and ignore it in favour of classwork.
‘Don’t,’ he says and throws Potter a shrewd look. ‘I’d rather not have anymore experience with your habit of blowing things up by accident.’
‘Draco,’ says Luna. ‘I finished that book you lent me. It was quite interesting. I certainly enjoyed all the little notes in the margins. It was certainly quite different from Scamander’s book.
Draco steps up onto the footpath on the other side and stops, turning to face Harry, one eyebrow raised in that infuriatingly familiar expression of scepticism.
‘Relax,’ he says, and brushes Harry’s hair out of his face. ‘You wanted me to find a way, and I did. So,’ he leans forward and, almost nose to nose, he says, ’stop complaining and kiss me.’
Harry disappears for the day to escape the whispers and stares. Worried, Draco goes looking for him, only for his worries and frustrations to come out as anger. They fight, they reconcile, and Draco learns of an embarrassing moment from Harry's past that puts a pause on things moving beyond just kissing.
Of course. Granger, miss fucking goody two shoes, who is apparently too noble to hex the likes of Zacharias Smith, even if it means protecting her supposed best friend from being outed.
The boy cries out, spinning to face Harry and trying to get his arm free. Harry clamps down and punches him in the face. Hard.
‘I—No, I was talking to her, I…we aren’t…’ he sighs, runs a hand through his hair and takes a deep breath.
They head out, and the quiet of the corridor beyond is almost oppressing after the noise of the common room.
Ginny laughs softly, amusement washing way some of her disquiet; and yet, as she rolls over and closes her eyes the feeling creeps back in and she falls into the most unsettled sleep she’s had in five years.
Blaise is bored. His fellow sixth years have long since abandoned him for homework or sleep, a fact that has Blaise rather disappointed being that it’s a friday night and all. Really, who goes to bed before nine on a
Blaise raises an eyebrow and nudges Theo pointedly in the ribs. ‘Theo,’ he hisses, nudging him more when the sullen boy doesn’t look up. ‘Do you
Blaise holds his hands up surrender, though he still has that stupid grin on his face. Draco rolls his eyes and wishes he’d stayed in bed, detentions be damned.
With all the people it’d be impossible to use an eavesdropping spell, and so Tonks digs around in her pocket and withdraws the thin strip of flesh she’d confiscated from Fred and George Weasley earlier that year. She grins, marvelling at their genius. Really, Mad-Eye should consider hiring them to make Auror products.
Zacharias Smith gazed back at him with a sneer from the far opposite bed from Terry, leaving only two beds remaining in between them. One for Harry and one for—
Luna shakes her head and decides that she really must start working on her wrackspurt charms, before the situation gets out of control.
Malfoy puts out a hand, palm up, and Colin stares at it, uncomprehending. Malfoy arches one brow. The look is effective. Everything about Malfoy is pristine and poised. His cheekbones are high, and he embodies aristocratic features, not just physically, but in every expression, purposeful in it’s intent.
She stands waiting just beyond the ticketing booth—a small rectangular booth posing as a coffee shed—watching the crowds for Hagrid’s tell tale height, and frowns when she sees no sign of them. It’s a little after nine, and they were supposed to be here over ten minutes ago.
The Boy jumps, looking up with wide eyes at the newcomer. His expression shifts into a scowl, anger flashing through his eyes at the human girl.
It doesn’t really make sense, but it has the desired reaction. He presses the pillow into his face and lets out a frustrated yell (muffled by the pillow)
‘Pardon?’ Draco asks, sitting up slowly, as if he’s still not certain that Potter isn’t going to hit him after all.
The hallway goes still. Ron may not be the most observant person in the world, but even he notices the way they all stare, including Malfoy’s own friends, at the hideously disfigured inky black mark taking up the majority of Malfoy’s forearm.
‘So, what’s crawled up our dear Prince’s arse this time?’ she asks, scooting over on the couch to loop an arm through his.
A sigh beside her breaks Romilda from her stunned surprise. ‘Boys are such idiots,’ says Ginny, shaking her head as she gazes at the two now-shouting boys. She turns to Romilda and smiles. ‘Hey, let’s go to the kitchen and get hot-chocolates. I bet we could—’
‘Now, Mr Potter,’ Professor Burbage reprimands, though doesn’t seem to know how to follow this statement.
‘I…we…I just went for a walk. I couldn’t sleep, see. So I went for a walk. Like I always do. And then he was there, and they were chasing him. Beating him up!’ his fists clench. ‘Fucking assholes,’ Harry says. ‘It was four on one! How is
Draco scoffs. He reopens his book and pointedly begins reading again. Potter watches him for a moment, head tilted, green eyes bright and contemplative, a smile building at the corners of his mouth.
He stares up at the canopy of his bed, ignoring the rustling movements of his housemates getting ready for the school day. Theo knows he should join them. If he stays in bed any longer he will miss breakfast and if he missed breakfast again he’d have to put up with Blaise and his stupid knowing looks and Daphne’s thinly veiled questions of concern.
‘No, it’s quite alright,’ the Professor says briskly. ‘I understand that for a muggle-raised child like yourself the concept of electricity and technology may seem rather dull to you; but as you’ve so eloquently pointed out not all people in this class are as familiar with the subject of this class as yourself. Therefore, perhaps you’ll benefit from pairing up with Mr Malfoy here and working on your assignments together? Perhaps if you’re focused on helping each other, you’ll refrain from anymore interruptions for the rest of the class?’
Minerva offers her an encouraging smile. ‘Well, Albus has faith in us, if his silence is anything to go by.’
‘Well,’ says Dumbledore, moving further into the room. ‘The situation is certainly not ideal. But Hogwarts has one of the finest Potions Masters in all of Britain and, if I do say so myself, a rather talented media-witch.’
Lisa flicks her gaze back at Potter and Malfoy in disbelief. She regards the Hufflepuff next to her and tries to decide whether or not his judgement can be trusted. She taps her quill and glances down at her observations.
He’s close. Not close enough to touch, not close enough for their shoulders to brush or their fingers to graze each other; but close enough to see the shame and weariness in his eyes, close enough for Draco to get a whiff of coffee and bacon and grass.
‘You’ll note,’ she says in that prim, aristocratic voice that all the Malfoy’s pulled off so well, ‘that my letter never specified a time.’
With a helpless sigh, he pulls out his wand and flicks it at his things, trying to order them back into his back. They resist him, scattering off into various directions, and he frowns, trying to concentrate.
‘As long as I deem necessary,’ she says tartly. ‘It’s a miracle you’re already up. Honestly, transforming the pitch into a lake, what in Merlin’s name were you thinking?’
Dennis chuckles and gives him a nudge with his elbow. ‘Oi, Colin,’ he says, pulling the camera out of Colin’s hands and replacing it with a fork. ‘Will you at least eat something before the end of lunch?’
Poppy hands out several potions to each boy and waits until they start drinking. Malfoy sniffs at his cautiously, glancing up at her warily, unlike Potter who downs his without hesitation—having been through this routine many a time before.
Weariness digs into Minerva. She looks around the room, at all the books and papers and ingredients scattered over the various surfaces of the usually neat and tidy room. Poppy is an intensely organised woman until there is a remedy she can’t quite crack, then organisation turns into chaos. Minerva knows better than to try and tidy up or help. When Poppy goes into research mode she’s like a dragon building a nest. It may seem messy to an outsider, but there is a method to her chaos, and—like all mother dragons—if her territory is encroached she tends to get a little…enraged.
Malfoy glances back over his shoulder. ‘Jesus Potter, get your shit together before the other’s show up!’
A glow that only bubbles further to life as Ron defends two quaffle throws in a row. He grins wide and calls out to the Slytherin chasers,
Tonks muffles a snort and shakes her head. She should be surprised. Really, she should be horrified. But she’s not. After all, it
Water drips over his head and down his back, sending shivers of discomfort through him. ‘Nice,’ he scowls, thoroughly drenched and outraged.
Malfoy frowns at her, gaze wary, but as he glances down at the book she’s proffering him, his expression clears and a smirk pulls at the corners of his lips.
She gets up and heads to the front of the class, her hands jittering and sweaty. She wipes her hands on her skirt and picks up her assignment.
as he is clearly in no state to be moving yet; however, having ignited Poppy’s ire once already, decides to watch what unfolds instead.
‘Draco means more to me than any war,’ she says and takes Severus’ hands in her own, squeezing them hard, as if she can convey the depth of her worry through their hands. ‘His heart is conflicted. He wants someone he knows he shouldn’t and he is afraid. Afraid of what we’ll say, of what we’ll do, afraid of his own feelings. And maybe that fear will keep him grounded, maybe it will keep him safe with us, with me,’ she shakes her head, her voice growing soft. ‘But if it does, he will resent us forever. I have seen what becomes of those who choose the dark over their hearts, Severus, and I
‘Uh, I, um, the films don’t survive the printing process. It’s the magic, see? I haven’t worked out how to imbue the movement while also keeping the film intact. The process can be sorta complicated and, well, uh, no,’ Colin stops babbling and offers Malfoy a nervous smile. ‘There’s no original. That’s the only copy.’
that Minerva is momentarily stunned. ‘You look after me better than my own relatives do and anyway, you and Pomfrey are basically like my parents at this point, so I don’t see
With that said, Thistle snaps her fingers and two more house elves appear. ‘Hot chocolates and eclairs, on the double,’ she turns back to Narcissa and says in a stage whisper. ‘They’s be being Master Draco’s favourites.’
Harry straightens from the books he’s looking at and leans one shoulder against the shelves. ‘Wait,’ he says, eyeing Malfoy with raised eyebrows. ‘You actually go to study break?’
She pauses, recognising the grating voice of Weasley, and some of the satisfaction of the day seeps away. Ugh.
Perhaps that would change, however, if he gave them something to look forward to? Something one of them, at least, has never done before.
Theo glances across at Daphne, and then back at Blaise. ‘Ten galleons says Draco started it, but pins it on Potter,’ he says and Blaise can hear the solicitous smirk in his voice.
‘Maybe…maybe you should write to him?’ suggests Potter. ‘Maybe it’ll help him to know that not everyone will think he’s dangerous because of something he can’t control. Maybe…maybe he can help change people’s minds about magical snakes?’
He swallows. He remembers the time Pansy accidentally summoned an entire magazine’s worth of clothes just before her ninth birthday and how she’d spent all week in bed. How frail it had made her—Pansy, so loud and ferocious, constrained to a bed, barely able to lift her own head.
that the Black estate has several houses, some of considerable size—after all, that was supposed to be mine.’
The spell is an air bubble charm, and it settles around her head as she steps into the smoke filled room.
Maybe they’d been close once, but, aside from this conversation, Draco hasn’t spoken to any of them about anything significant in weeks. It’s not just Theo anymore, it’s all of them. Even Greg and Vince. As if, suddenly, they’re people he has to be wary of.
Blue eyes flick up at her, distracted. The boy frowns, and then pulls a small, rounded object from one of his ears, letting it drop from his hand to dangle from a thin wire.
The blush is back, and a surge of frustration sweeps over Hermione as she watches her embarrassed friend hurry after Malfoy, looking more confused and far less annoyed than he usually does.
Draco takes a sharp breath and goes still. Blinking, he takes stock of his surroundings. Four poster bed, dark green curtains, a carving of an eagle owl drifting in lazy circles above his head.
Harry sighs. He’s not really that upset. After all, any excuse to spend a bit more time with Draco is fine by him. But it’s the principal.
Draco doesn’t answer. He’s panting, his eyes squeezed shut in pain, and Severus feels a small twinge of guilt. He tries for a different tactic.
It’s such a nice feeling. Soft and comforting and so unlike her that it instantly makes the hairs on his arm stand on end.
She dips her head in agreement. ‘The thing is, Severus, she wasn’t convinced. And neither am I. In fact, I never have been, I just never asked before.’
I might not get a chapter out over the weekend as this is the last of my pre-written chapters, but I have however made a proper outline for pretty much the rest of the story. There should be a rough 20 odd chapters left for 6th year, and another 30-40 for summer and 7th year.
Potter shakes his head. He turns away, scrubs a hand through his hair again, and turns back. ‘Just, tell me one thing. What’re you so afraid of?’
Albus, musing on the dramatics of teenagers, senses the glares of his two remaining staff. Minerva and Poppy are both glaring at him as if it were
‘Hey, I’m just saying,’ he says. ‘Remember what happened last time we believed rumours about Harry—Sorry, last time
This turned out to be a lot longer than I thought it would, and I apologise because there's barely any fluffiness going on. Just for being so patient with me, here's a quick sneak peak at the next chapter (and no, sorry, it's not the Zoo chapter just yet - though I can't WAIT to share that with you):
His brain throws images at him. Spells arcing toward him. Pain burning through him. Cruel laughter. Draco falling, heading straight for the ground.
Remus sighs. ‘No, not even on alliances,’ says Remus. ‘The centaurs won’t commit. They’re adamant this war won’t affect them.’
‘Maybe,’ says Harry dryly, and with a bit of complicated spellwork, reaches in to pull Scorpius from the painting, ‘because you kept him up all night?’
serious. Seeing as we can’t seem to pry you two apart without there being untold violence spread throughout my halls, I’m going to grant you your wish. You can expect your new timetables in the morning.’
Several students look up from their none-too-quiet conversations to stare, surprise and curiosity on their faces—and it’s plane as day
Harry mutters something low and inaudible, and stomps out from the showers in nothing but his trousers, a towel slung around his shoulders. ‘Throw me my shirt will you?’
‘Nymphadora Tonks?’ asks Severus in disbelief. ‘You want to send two of the most volatile students we have, into a volatile,
Potter crosses his arms and shoots Malfoy a glare. ‘No need to be nasty about it, I was just asking,’ he scowls.
Draco takes a step forward, then hesitates. ‘Why are you doing this?’ he asks, frowning at Potter. At Harry. ‘What’s going on?’
‘Dumbledore made me a deal,’ he says through clenched teeth. ‘If I help him, he’ll keep mother out of prison.’
Putting aside that thought for later, she drops the Extendable Ear on the ground and gives it a quick flick of her wand. It shoots off out of sight beneath the seats. She jams the other end into her ear (offering an easy smile to the disturbed gentleman next to her) and waits.
Colin flinches. He glances up to see Draco Malfoy staring down at them with those cool blue eyes. They make Colin think of white ice-caps floating in the arctic. Except, there’s something else lurking in Malfoy’s gaze today. Something like amusement. A sunset splashing orange and purple across the glacial background.
Draco, his face still expressionless, shoulders his bag, and stalks out of the room. One by one, the others follow.
Genuine concern flickers over Draco’s face and, seemingly unconcerned with his audience, Draco gently grasps Potter’s shoulder, giving it a soft shake.
Blaise turns, watching the blond bolt down the stairwell toward their dorm and almost feels impressed at how clearly rattled Draco is. ‘Jesus Potter, what did you
Her footsteps patter across the marble floors, and she is so distracted by the awful taste in her mouth that she doesn’t even realise where she’s gone until she pushes through a doorway and feels the brisk afternoon air ghost across her face, blowing through her hair and clothes, and catching her breath and flinging it out into the open air.
Harry nods, grinning. ‘You point that circular end at your hair, turn it on and it blows hot air at you.’
Ron shakes his head. ‘Remind me not to piss you off,’ he says, and grins at Harry, nudging his shoulder. ‘Sorry I said all that about it being dark magic.’
Harry levels her with a look that could rival Snape’s worst glowers. ‘Yes,’ he says, his voice even and condescending. ‘That’s exactly what it was.’
Potter rolls his eyes. ‘Because we were fine, and we were making this work and then all of a sudden you were saying it was over. And don’t tell me it wasn’t working because it
Glancing between them, Neville feels some of the bafflement drain away. Malfoy still makes him nervous but there’s something about the way they’re interacting that—although they’re bickering—is different from before.
Draco shrugs. ‘I was just wondering,’ he says, but he frowns up at the tree above, feeling somewhat unsatisfied by the answer and not knowing entirely why.
closest to Madam Pomfrey’s rooms. Pomfrey had him asleep by the time they arrived. They still don’t know what happened, but for now he lays quietly, but for the soft hush of his breathing and the occasional indistinguishable mumble.
Harry blinks several times, but doesn’t move. Doesn’t step away. Doesn’t put the space back between them. Ron’s mind is trying furiously to show him what’s happening, to connect the dots, but he shakes his head, shying away from the situation. Harry wouldn’t. He
‘Sorry,’ he says, rubbing his head and looking up. ‘Didn’t see you—Malfoy?’ he chokes off, coughing over his own words once he sees who exactly it is he’s run into.
She has spent two weeks with Parvati, trying to make the day as magical as possible so that everyone can feel that sweet buzz of warmth that comes from knowing you’re special to someone.
‘I’m fine,’ she yells back. She turns, seeing that it was Goyle who had pulled her out of the way. ‘Thank you.’
despise him,’ he snaps. ‘If Potter wants to go around shagging any moron who lets him that’s his choice. What do I care?’
‘Honestly, Potter,’ says Draco with a roll of his eyes, stepping over to Harry and brushing flour out of his hair. ‘Is there
Harry backtracks, his eyes widening, his heart leaping up into his throat. The fire in his veins burns hot, and yet, something in his brain misinterprets the adrenaline pouring furiously through him. A shield erupts around him, domed and pink and frighteningly familiar.
He shakes his head. ‘No. No I’m sick of it. I’m tired of everyone talking about what a cute couple you are.’
Harry takes a deep breath and holds it. ‘Because,’ he says, and lets out all the air. ‘Because this was never going to work out anyway. Because we’ll constantly be fighting against people trying to tear us apart. Because he was going to become a spy and ruin his life. Because he doesn’t want to watch me die.’ Harry shrugs again. ‘Take your pick.’
That night Draco lounges by the dwindling fire in the common room reading one of the books that Harry had gifted him for Christmas. It’s his favourite of the set and already it is well-worn.
‘No,’ says Hermione. ‘Though, McGonagall has a point. The fighting has gotten to be a bit much. I mean, they
There’s movement in the corner of Blaise’s eye. Someone with rather blonde hair has just entered the Great Hall, but Blaise doesn’t take his eyes off Potter.
Hannah, who loves music, feels an odd sort of warmth at the idea. ‘They give songs to people they have feelings for?’ she asks. ‘That’s kind of sweet. Like writing a love letter, but with music.’
‘Because,’ says Malfoy with a roll of his eyes. ‘Your little tiff is upsetting him and that’s making things difficult for me.’
He yanks the sleeve of his school shirt up. Cold shivers up Luna’s spine, her shoulders tensing at the sight of the tangled knot of scars splayed across a dull, inky black tattoo.
For a moment he thinks they’ve all gone back to sleep, and he’s going to successfully sneak out of there without anyone noticing.
Draco snorts. ‘Clearly.’ He shakes his head. ‘Come on then.’ He changes direction, stepping down onto the street and crossing over.
Harry drops his head into his arms and Ron puts an arm around him, gripping Harry’s shoulder tight as small, soft sobs shake through him.
‘Trust me, you don’t want that option,’ he says, in answer to Earnie’s earlier question. ‘I was raised by muggles and I’ve no idea which author is the wizard.’
He’s heading back to Gryffindor tower after lunch one Saturday, three weekends before Christmas holidays when he hears Ginny’s name. His footsteps slow automatically, wondering if he needs to crack someone’s head for talking shit about his girlfriend, when he hears Harry’s name too, and comes to a stop.
Hermione tries to hide it, but she’s impressed. While she is perfectly capable of conjuring, it always leaves her feeling a little drained. Transfiguring from another item, however, is far simpler and generally more effective.
‘Oh? Well Slytherins also don’t go parading about with irrational, rule-breaking, reckless, idiotic Gryffindor’s but you seem to have no problem doing
Before Severus can even think of a reply Draco shoves past him and stalks out of the room, not even giving Severus a backwards glance.
Luna is sure that this infestation is in part to blame for the damage that befell the Defence rooms during an encounter between Harry and Draco Malfoy. She’s sure of this fact, for the very next morning she detects the presence of Wrackspurts hanging around Draco as well.
As if each gift of chocolate or quidditch related memorabilia, or knick-knack of some other is a shadow falling over him.
She meets Zabini just below the surface, grabbing at Malfoy’s free arm to help pull him up. With two of them, it’s much easier, and they break the surface a moment later.
‘Damn, I was hoping you could tell me what happened. Was there really as much blood as everyone is saying?’
Draco scowls, but the dizziness takes hold of him again. ‘Why…Why won’t you just tell me what the hell is wrong with him?’ he asks, frowning as he tries to stop the world from spinning.
Harry leans forward a little and Draco can smell grass and dirt and coffee and the scents blend together and—
‘What about Remus?’ Pomona suggests, brightening. ‘He had such a way with Harry that year he taught here, didn’t he?’
guilty (though, a quick thought to his own three and the chaos they tend to spread everywhere they go has that feeling vanishing fairly quickly—the kid is young, he’ll get over it). ‘Now I’m a middle aged, divorcee father of three, on my fourteenth hour of my sixth shift this week. So, either buy me a drink, or go home.’
She trails a hand along the wall to see if the stone has cheered up any. Though she can still taste sorrow on the tip of her tongue, she thinks the heavy feeling is fading. There’s a hopeful sort of hum trailing through the walls, warming her fingertips.
Harry swallows, gaze dropping to the floor. ‘I don’t want to talk about it,’ he says, and looks back up at Draco. ‘I just want to forget it happened.’
Scorpius, in the perfect timing of all toddlers, looks up at his father with an adorable lopsided grin and gurgles, ‘fuck!’
From the look on Malfoy’s face, and the conversation Phineas has heard, he thinks maybe they can. Without a backwards glance, Phineas leaves the portrait and makes the long trek back up through the portraits to Albus’ office.
Narcissa edges forward on her seat, casting a quick smile toward Draco. He smiles back at her, but it doesn’t quiet reach his eyes.
His face is bright red, and he stares fixedly at his hands as he talks, his whole body a lesson in being uncomfortable.
Dean jumps, looking up into the curious, smiling face of one Ginny Weasley with a vaguely guilty expression. ‘Just, you know…school in general.’
He’s funny in a self-deprecating, somewhat moody kind of way. He certainly never tires of riling Malfoy up, goading the boy until he explodes into a series of insults and reprimands that instead of making Harry angry, make him grin in amusement—as if daring Malfoy to do better.
Malfoy rolls his eyes again. ‘Please, Potter,’ he says, selecting a book at random and opening it up. ‘You obviously don’t read.’
Draco clenches his jaw. The sudden need to get out, to be as far away from this guy as possible, pours through him.
Harry laughed. ‘Then you should have nothing to worry about,’ he said, shuffling forward eagerly as the line moved up.
Something a bit cute and fluffy for all you lovely people. The next chapter is full of smuttiness so keep an eye out (I hope to get it out tomorrow).
McGonagall clears her throat. ‘I trust you’ll all behave while you’re away, and come back refreshed and ready to learn.’
He catches Hermione looking, frowns, and turns back to his cauldron. ‘Think you can manage not to throw everything off the table again?’
He stomps over to the gathered group of students outside the greenhouses, feeling as if the entire universe is conspiring against him.
He winces. ‘Uh, anyway, the point is that, uh, that if it means that much to you, I’ll try to be okay with it. I mean, I’m not gonna be friends with the guy, but…but I won’t be jerk about it.’
Shaking hands with a Slytherin over a bet she’s just placed on her best friend feels more than a little surreal, but Hermione takes it in stride. She’s sure that, with Zabini and Nott’s insights, that she can figure out this mystery.
‘Goodnight, Mr Potter,’ she says. ‘I will see you in the morning.’ She pauses at the door to the Hospital Wing. ‘Oh, and you shall be resuming classwork tomorrow.’
‘Ginny tells me that you and Draco helped get Harry out of the fire,’ says Luna, looking up from her card game to fix Ron with a wide-eyed stare. ‘Are you two getting on better now?’
She rubs a hand over her face. ‘Well, that potion is a wash,’ she says in a low voice. ‘I’m out of my depth here.’
‘I’d much rather you left any potions tutelage to me, Weasley,’ drawls a familiar voice from behind Colin and Harry.
He’s too caught up in the moment to realise. At first at least. After all, it’s so nice, this warmth. Comforting.
Draco’s vision clears just in time to see Pomfrey shoot Albus a dark look. She lowers Potter back onto the bed, adjusts his blankets and then turns to glower at the Headmaster.
Harry pulls his arm free from Granger and stands up. Smith tenses, reaching for his wand but hesitating, his head turning toward the head table where the Professors are pretending not to watch.
He glances at her sharply. He tries to hide the wary mistrust beneath a sneer, but she sees right through it. She’d be hurt by his lack of trust, if she wasn’t expecting it. After all, one doesn’t start a secret relationship with the Boy Who Live and not develop an appropriate sense of paranoia.
He flicks his wand, sending a torrent of air toward a return owl, causing it to flounder mid air as it attempts to right itself. Pansy raises her eyebrows.
‘Right,’ says Mad-Eye gruffly, gaze swivelling around to latch onto Dora. ‘Let’s get this underway. Tonks, update?’
Tonks almost laughs at the expression of mingled disbelief, pleasure and wariness warring over the Dragon Keeper’s face at Potter’s announcement. As the trio stop just shy of the (still huge) baby dragon, the Keeper settles on satisfaction, obviously pleased to have people admire his charge.
Blaise admires his boldness, and shifts slightly so he can pull out his wand if this dissolves into a fight (as it so often does these days).
In fact, for perhaps the first time since their first year at Hogwarts, Harry had been genuinely happy; without the weight of the wizarding world pressing down on his shoulders. Her surprise at this realisation mingled with the hurt that it had been
‘I’ll see you tomorrow,’ says Malfoy in a low voice, still holding onto Harry’s hand. His eyes dart toward the group lingering by the door, the briefest hint of self-consciousness crossing his face before he leans over and presses a soft kiss to Harry’s temple.
‘Albus is on his way,’ says Severus, and turns to Draco, his hand tightening on Draco’s shoulder. ‘Back to bed, Malfoy.’
McGonagall is waiting for them when they enter, watching impassively as they all fumble around the room, trying to decide where to sit. Blaise eyes her.
. You’re the one who keeps insisting on keeping up this stupid crush. Why can’t you just let it go?’
give him brain damage? I mean look at him! Normally he’d be grabbing at your face and trying to eat your wand and nothing.
Severus rolls his eyes. ‘Oh of course,’ he scoffs. ‘My choice is to refuse help, and risk the endangerment of my godson, whom I’ve sworn to protect—which you well know—or willingly help him in this ridiculous scheme you’ve cooked up, putting him in the direct line of fire of the Dark Lord. What in the name of magic were you thinking, Albus?’
‘Sure,’ she says, shrugging. ‘I mean, if I think about I guess he hasn’t been as big a pain in the arse as usual. In fact, none of them have been. Who knows, maybe you’re a good influence? Anyway, Luna likes him.’
‘What’re you saying?’ asks Ginny, her stomach bottoming out as she glances around that the flames creeping closer.
Wow, was right. The room was circular in shape, and rose up into a high, cathedral arch above their heads. The ceiling—much like the ceiling in the Great Hall—was translucent. Only (judging from the sun-beams filtering down into the room) this ceiling was not enchanted; It was made out of glass.
Colin trails off. He’s suddenly aware of the fact that they’re in the great hall, and that several members of their house are listening in (as they always seem to do when Harry is involved). There’s a look on Harry’s face that makes Colin think of the antelope again.
Potter shakes his head. ‘Sorry,’ he says. ‘Look, yeah, we went into a closet. But it’s not what you think. I needed help with something, that’s all.’
‘Alright,’ she says. ‘Off to the Hospital Wing, all of you. And as soon as Madam Pomfrey has cleared you I expect a full account of what
The only one who seems to be free of the infestation is Hermione Granger. This is hardly surprising, for if Luna is one of those blessed with the ability to believe, Hermione is one of those blessed with the ability to
She purses her lips, thinking that he rather fits in amongst the feathers and the droppings scattered about the Owlery.
He’s late. He’s very, very late. He’s so late that his clumsiness hitches up a notch and he trips up the first step of the stairwell leading from the great hall and drops his bag.
He grins. ‘Never mind. Was just thinking that this new seating rule is going to be harder for some than others.’
Crimson floods Harry’s face. ‘Oh,’ he says, his voice pitching higher. ‘Erm, right. Er. I guess…Dumbledore’s meetings are, they’re um, a lot to think about.’
Remus envies her her easy going nature. Wishing that he too could see the hope in the world as she does. He stares at his hands, his shoulders turning inward.
‘Oh, so because you thought it was Malfoy, that makes it all okay, does it? You know you can’t just hit anyone you like, Ron! And sooner or later you’re going to have to get over this grudge of yours!’
‘Why no, Potter. I thought I’d take a shower fully dressed, I hear it’s the in thing at the moment. Of course I’m fucking naked you idiot. Now, kindly stop poking around through my clothes so I can finish my shower.’
‘Just wondering were Draco has got to,’ she says, and sends him a wink. ‘I’d rather the inclination to spend some time with him.’
‘I’m tired of being patient,’ he continues, and for a moment Hermione thinks he’s talking about Ron.
‘I can trust you to keep my secrets, can I?’ Harry asks, voice dangerously quiet, and Ron is about to retort when he realises that Harry is blinking back tears. ‘Thanks for your support, Ron. You’re a great friend.’
Draco frowns, rescanning the crowd again. He spots a bright flash of red that can be none other than Weasley and scowls, still bitter about yesterday. Longbottom and one of the other Gryffindor girls whose names Draco can’t be bothered remember are next to him.
Narcissa’s smile widens, and she does as she’s bid, perching herself not on her usual chair beside Bella, but on the other end of the lounge where Draco is sitting. He has his chin in his hand again and is staring absently at the corner of the room. There’s a small frown on his face, and Narcissa must fight the urge to reach over and smooth it away. Once he would have smiled at her attentions, but not now that he is almost grown.
of them did as well as the rest). ‘As a treat, I thought I’d do my own presentation. Now, while all of you did your projects on a muggle item, I did mine on a Muggle
Tension coils through him. All his muscles go tight, his skin heating up under the rush of pleasure flowing through him.
Harry flushes as most the class turns to look at him. ‘Er, sort of. I went when I was little but, uh, I was…too small for the rides,’ he scratches behind his ear, his head ducking. ‘I’ve always wanted to go back.’
She raises her eyebrows, but gives him a friendly nudge. ‘Hey,’ she says. ‘I don’t like him much either. He’s a bit…self righteous.’
Poppy understands. They had been teachers together at Hogwarts for many years. They’d seen hundreds of students come and go, and of them all, many were already dead. Many passed before their time, due to the whims of a madman; and now they were facing the same situation. How many more young, bright lives would be extinguished before their eyes?
. I dragged his sorry ass out of that fire, even tried to make peace with sodding Weasley! I…fuck! I don’t know what to do.
, but until Ginny had pointed it out he hadn’t realised quite how abnormal it was. There were scars crisscrossing over the ink, twisting the shape into something that is almost unrecognisable. Though Ron doubts there’s anything that can wholly make the Dark Mark unrecognisable.
‘You just need to relax a little, here, I’ll go get you a drink. I’m sure someone’s spiked it by now. Maybe
Malfoy frowns, his shoulders stiffening as Potter focuses his attention on anything but the boy beside him.
Yet…yet his wand, still pointed at Snape, didn’t move. Snape is staring at it, and Harry knows that he knows.
‘You think so?’ asks the Keeper excitedly. ‘Though,’ he says with a frown. ‘I doubt my letter would get through. He probably gets a tonne of mail.’
still on about that. You don’t think it’s strange? You don’t think it’s weird that he can’t explain where he was? Even to
Poppy frowns. She pats him on the shoulder once, and goes to fetch some potions. They’re both going to need them.
The whole room goes quiet and it takes Theo a moment to realise that the words came from him. They all stare at him. Greg and Vince, lost in confusion. Blaise in surprise—no doubt that Draco wasn’t overreacting. And Draco, in stunned disbelief.
‘Alright, come on Draco,’ comes Blaise’s persistently cheerful voice, the sound of bed curtains being pulled back echoing behind his words. ‘Let’s go get some coffee into you. I’d rather you weren’t a complete and utter sodding nightmare today and--oh...er...well, this is awkward.’
Ginny snorts. ‘Yeah,’ she says. ‘I mean, I just chalked it up to Luna being Luna, but she’s got good instincts, I’ll give her that. Though, if he hurts you, I swear to Merlin nothing will protect him from my bat boogey hex.’
Rolling her eyes, Pansy shifts her focus back to Peter, only to find that he too is watching Potter. Half the room is watching Potter.

He scoffs, and glances out into the street behind her, ensuring that there is no sign of Narcissa’s older, less hinged, sister. ‘Unlike you, I don’t have time to wait around on the whims of others. Well, at least you’re alone this time,’ he says, just to confirm (one can never be certain when it came to Bellatrix Lestrange).
She nods but ignores his question, casting two quick spells. Irritation shoots up his spine and he’s about to ask his question again when he notices how tired she looks. Draco is no stranger to the hospital wing, particularly in the last two months, and yet he can recall
Draco rolls his eyes and once again runs a hand through his hair. ‘Yeah, alright,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘Why the fuck not? But this isn’t some sort of pervy ghost show, okay? We agree to come and visit you, or whatever, but that’s it.’
this. I hate—’ He breaks off and turns away, running both hands through his hair and growling in frustration.
His breath stops and he is frozen to the spot. Bellatrix is distracted by the auror’s and hasn’t seen him yet. He has time. Yet he doesn’t move. Conflict swarms through him as he realises he’ll have to choose. He’ll have to choose between either his godson, or the son of the woman he loved.

She laughs and smacks him with a pillow. ‘It’s not,’ she says. ‘But seeing as you’re my only gay friend, and I’m the only one you’ve told about this, I figure I should get something out of it, right?’
