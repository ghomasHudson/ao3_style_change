“Already?! It’s been less than an hour!” Pansy shrieks in disbelief, whipping her head to look at Blaise in astonishment.
Smith looks Draco dead in the eye, “You’re gonna pay for this,
How Theo has managed to remain so humble and unpresuming throughout the years is unfathomable to Draco. The idea of keeping his own accomplishments to himself sounds nearly impossible. He peeks a look at Theo, and thankfully, his attention is on Pansy who is so enthralled that Draco could vanish her clothes and she would fail to notice.
Theo watches the light as it fades out, his expression falling slightly before he covers it with a smile. “Good, it didn’t get worse at least. I think if you practice more you should be just fine for the evaluation. There’s still plenty of time.”
Getting to know Draco the past few weeks has been interesting to say the least. For the past seven years, she’s only known him as a prejudiced bully, and part of that still hasn’t left her mind. However, at the trials when she heard what he went through during the war, she began to change her thoughts on him. She thought perhaps he wasn’t as truly evil as she initially thought, and that there was more depth to him than he was allowing others to see. Hermione’s been coming to realize that some things are more complicated than they may appear, and she feels she may as well give people the benefit of the doubt, Draco included. Besides, she can’t resist a competent study partner, not when her NEWTs are on the line.
As Draco sits on the edge of his bed, leaning over his knees, Theo knocks gently on the door, which Draco wants more than anything to ignore. But then Theo begins to speak, saying he has Draco’s bag that he left behind.
They turn the corner and see Theo striding towards them, looking as charming as always. Gracing his face is a broad smile that looks natural, effortless. Upon seeing Blaise, realization dawns on him and his warm expression falls. “Did you already tell them?”
“Bye Reina,” he replies, amused as he closes the door, waving his wand to lock it.
“Don’t fret your pretty little head DD, we can do that tomorrow. I’ll go tell Greg in a minute.”
Madam Pince scowls at the pair, peering over her book. Her expression sends a shiver down Draco’s spine.
“Foul wench.” Draco grumbles.
“No, soon. Two weeks,” Potter says decidedly.
“Of course darling, but you’d be even more dashing if you ate some food.”
Draco gives in, knowing he shouldn’t push her. He knows she's right, but the thought of having to act noble for the sake of those who will never see them any differently makes his stomach turn.
“...Coach Malfoy! That was fun!” She says, elated.
“Yeah, what’d he say?” Harry adds, his eyes blazing with interest.
At everyone’s nods and agreements, Mcgonagall picks up the hat from the table and small pieces of parchment beside it. “I need all of you to grab a quill, because you will each write your names on a piece of parchment and place it into the bag. Then, I’ll walk back around and ask you all to take a name. The person you choose will be your target, and you cannot switch targets with another person. The magic involved will not allow it,” She instructs. McGonagall approaches each student one by one, and they each grab a small piece of parchment from her, and Draco reaches into his bag for a quill.
The anger that floods through him at the sight of this wanker propels him to reveal himself, a devious smirk on his face.
“Yes, I know. I just don’t trust him.”
She drops the quaffles in her hands to turn toward him, her gaze cold. “I don't know what you did for her to pick you over Harry, but don’t pull anything on the kids, got it?”
“For talking about the war again,” she says simply, holding out her hand for the payment.
to play. Let the Golden boy win as he’s expected to so his fan club can praise him for it.”
“You don’t need to tell me that,” she says, flushing in embarrassment. Unlike the other Slytherins, Millie has never been versed at accepting compliments. On more than one occasion, Blaise has earned a punch in the face for his expressions of praise in an attempt to push her buttons—to the amusement of Draco and Pansy.
“That can be arranged,” Draco grumbles back as she approaches the bed.
“Dacian Monroe,” he answers with a harsh swallow.
Draco startles slightly at his tone. Theo has never been so hostile towards him before. “No, Theo. I am just making sure that everyone feels included and earns the best grades they can.”
“Yes, congratulations Potter, would you like a prize? I’m sure McGonagall would be willing to give you one thousand house points toward Gryffindor, perhaps even an extra five just for breathing,” Draco says, rolling his eyes.
Draco can speak English, French, and even a bit of Gobbledegok, which he overheard from the goblins his father spoke to when he was a child, but he still has no idea what Professor McGonagall just said.
“Who is it?” He calls.
As they gawp at her and the other eighth years stifle their laughs, she continues, her face unimpressed.
“I’m sorry, but I’m sure Potter has other Saviour related business to attend to, and I—”
Draco made a vow recently to never lie to Greg, so, “Yes,” he says softly. “I just needed to complain. He’s going to beat me and humiliate me even further.”
“Interesting, it appears that someone else is in more dire need of Draco’s attention,” Pansy says smugly, looking at Draco pointedly.
Hermione turns to him, feeling frustrated. “That is not what I think! All I said is he was a decent seeker, I don’t see what’s wrong with that.”
Draco stalks towards the door and pulls it open to reveal Reina, looking up at him with her usual exuberance. “Hi Coach Malfoy, or would it be Draco? Anyway, Coach Sylvester wanted me to give you this!” She pulls a piece of folded parchment out of her bag and holds it out in front of her.
As he anticipated, her face tightens into a vicious look and her cheeks turn a dark red. “I’ve told you to
Theo steps up to him and reaches his hands out. “Can I…?” He trails off, placing his hands on Draco’s shoulders when he nods in assent.
“No, I’m not going to and don’t you dare ask in my favor! I’ll never forgive you,” he sniffs.
“I recommend you don't, that would be entirely uncouth of you,” Draco says, keeping his face neutral.
“Listen up chumps, because you only have one shot to prove yourselves.”
They may not express their affection for one another outwardly, however it is undoubtedly ever-present. In the way she squeezed his hand every time they walked into a room with him. The single tear that traced her cheek the few moments before turning to the red eyes that sealed his fate as a marked man. The warm, reassuring smile she sends across the table as they share a meal together every day. When she led him off to Hogwarts for the last time and held his head between her graceful hands, her words simple yet imploring, “Stay safe for me, my Dragon.”
He hears a choked sound from somewhere in the common room but he doesn’t bother looking.
Honestly, Blaise can shove it about self-preservation.
Pansy pulls the curtains back abruptly and sits herself onto the bed.
If this silly game is all it’ll take to make his best friend crack a genuine smile again, then he’ll do it ten times over.
The round frames also happen to obstruct his wide, blazing green eyes, which never fail to send a chill down his spine upon meeting his gaze. He thinks it's the reason he always sought to agitate him so much in their early Hogwarts days. It’s the one way to get a close view of the piercing stare that ignites every part of his body. A burn that practically swallows him whole.
“But I don’t have any…” Pansy slowly reaches into her shirt where she pulls out a small piece of parchment, which Draco assumes was stuck in her bra. She unfolds it and lets out a loud gasp, dropping it like it burned her.
He has laughed bitterly at the possibility of it being a ferret, which in reality, would make him curse Barty Crouch Jr. for the rest of his life.
“I don't care, really. Anything but a bloody ferret,” Draco grumbles.
“Well, you remember the warm up he did. Those kids could have been seriously hurt.”
Draco sighs, deciding there’s no point in yelling at a tree to move. “Alright.”
“Please, it’s not like you particularly need them anyhow. You hardly ever hear what I say—OW!”
“Well… that’s great,” Draco breathes, relieved.
“I know. Who else would play witch salon with you?”
Blaise considers this and nods. “I suppose you’re right.”
“Now, if you could all quiet down for a bit longer” McGonagall starts, “I have appointed our new flying instructor, Madam Sylvester, as the moderator of this event. She should be arriving shortly—“
Coach Sylvester hums “Why is that?” she asks, surprisingly no judgement in her tone.
Ron flinches, turning to Harry like he hexed him. “
“I dunno, I’ve been thinking. If Potter was able to take down the Dark Lord as a Half-blood, what if it doesn’t... matter?” Greg shifts around on his bed nervously.
Ron snickers. “I‘ll believe it when I see Filch cast Avada Kedavra.”
” Pansy cries, “
Harry Potter, the most famous orphan of the wizarding world, may have lost the chance of experiencing unconditional love from his parents, but he will never understand the pain of bearing the knowledge that you have caused your own mother such deep, unresolved sorrow.
Hermione’s lip curves up into a faint smirk. “But aren’t you so sure you’re going to beat him?”
“Right this second? Potter I’ve been here for three hours, I’m famished—”
“All he did was pick up my book for me, Harry,” Hermione says.
Pansy sighs. “That’s not what I was referring to and you know it!”
“Fuck off!”
“Of course he’s good at it, the wondrous—” he mutters, resulting in a discrete stamp of Pansy’s foot atop his own that cuts off the rest of his words.
Draco also can’t help but notice Potter—who is sitting a few seats over from Pansy—and the way he squints his eyes as he focuses on the words written on the board. He wonders if Potter’s glasses even work for him anymore; he can tell that he’s been wearing the same pair since he was eleven. Draco may have limited knowledge about eyes and spectacles, but he does know that having the same pair for at least 8 years is much too long for anyone. Even the Chosen One.
“No, it’s not you, although even as I say that, it could be untrue,” Pansy says slyly and turns to Draco, “But yes, let's meet in your dorm right after Charms so we can brainstorm ideas.”
“Good morning Draco, how are you this fine morning?” Blaise asks as Draco starts combing his hair at the sink beside his.
He steps out of the row reluctantly, maintaining slow, deep breaths.
“Well, once I get involved, no one will even look your way without fear of meeting my wrath. They’ll wet their pants just at the thought.”
“I will carry on the message,” Draco responds over his shoulder.
The night of Dumbledore’s death, when Malfoy brought in the other Death Eaters, appears the most in his nightmares. His guilt still eats away at him, no matter how many times he has been reassured that none of it was his fault. Nothing anyone says will change what happened, and he’s reminded of it almost every night. The fear etched onto Malfoy’s face, Dumbledore’s calm acceptance of death. They’ve been seared into Harry’s mind.
“I don't think now is the time.”
“Bloody hell!”
Pansy snorts and Draco subsequently pokes her in the thigh.
Hermione opens and closes her mouth a couple times before stammering, “Well, do you still… believe in—”
A ferret? That was one time! He’s not surprised that Weasley is throwing around the fact that he was a Death Eater—he’s not particularly wrong. And of course the Weasel would, because he’s always been such a tactless brute. But calling him a ferret is cruel, especially when he was so viciously abused by Crouch. The bruises on his body from being slammed to the ground didn’t fade for weeks.
After a moment, she grabs the hat from her head and tosses it to the floor, “Finally, I can take this stupid hat off. It bothers my ears.”
“Sod off, I’m not risking anything, because some of us want to win. How do I know you won't find a way to steal my hat without getting caught?” Weasley snarls, “And you look just as ridiculous in that hat as we do when you have it on you slimy Death Eater!”
Finally, without moving his eyes away from Draco’s, Potter frees his wrist. His stare is boring into him, searching. For what, Draco couldn’t guess.
Harry looks down at his plate, pushing the food around with his fork distractedly. “I was just interested in seeing how Coach Sylvester was going to run the club, that’s all. I’m glad she’s doing it though, it’ll give the Muggleborns a chance to practice before having to try out.”
So no, Harry can’t trust him as far as he could throw him. However, his motives for helping Voldemort weren’t necessarily malicious. Since Harry is still unable to solve this dilemma, he tries his best to avoid thinking about Malfoy altogether, because then there is nothing for him to solve. But that’s a bit difficult when Malfoy is in all his classes and they share a common room. And now somehow he’s engaging with Hermione, which makes it even more of a challenge.
Draco’s head whips toward Potter, his face incredulous. “Potter, you don’t have to say yes to please the children. You shouldn’t spoil them.”
Draco sighs inwardly, knowing he should have anticipated this. He was a fool to think for even a moment that he’d heard the last of this.
Draco bursts out of Transfiguration class later that morning feeling frustrated that he couldn’t manage to turn his toad into a silky, slytherin green scarf as he intended to. Normally he effortlessly excelled in this class, never struggling to complete the assignments. But today every attempt resulted in a red, woollen scarf filled with small lightning bolts. It didn’t help that Professor McGonagall looked secretly amused by the mishap.
Draco barely resists rolling his eyes. He knows this is directed at the Golden Trio. She might as well say it out loud, and praise them once again for saving the entirety of the Wizarding World.
“Good one Blaise, I’ll have to remember that. Compliment them and then threaten them with Coach Sylvester,” Draco says dryly.
“This game is a survival of the fittest. Only the strongest will last in this game, so honestly, doormats, you don’t even stand a chance of winning,” She says in the direction of the Hufflepuffs, who frown at her disapprovingly.
“Looks like we’re not the only uncivilized ones,” Blaise says, pulling away from Pansy who is still recovering from the tickle attack with deep breaths.
“Well—”
Draco scoffs, choosing to ignore the slight on his magical capabilities. He’d prefer Potter to think he’s been Draco’s target since eliminating Smith, for Pansy’s sake. “Seems you have some common sense in you after all, I was starting to doubt it. Well, make sure to check beneath your bed every night, because I may pop up one night. Be scared, Potter.”
“No, it would be quite evil. Your paleness would blind us all, Dracula.”
“Yeah,
“I mean, you always get dramatic like this when Potter is involved.”
“Today is not about my rivalry with Potter. If you all plan to make the team, then I suggest we get started. Get in the air while I go grab the snitch,” he instructs firmly.
So at the mention of this idea, Ron was completely against it and thought Ginny was being completely unreasonable.
“Wait, what was Malfoy’s end of the bet?” Ron asks.
” Draco has to hold back a laugh, imagining Potter’s face when he was told this news. He may ask Coach Sylvester to see that pensieve memory for the sake of his entertainment.
“Yes, when I was eleven,” Draco says, just to be contrary.
Hermione stops, the energy draining from her as her face falls. “Draco, he’s not,” she insists.
As he stands in front of the door, he questions if he should run straight back to the safety of his dorm, but the door swings open before he can decide that.
It’s quiet for a beat, and Draco can feel his heart in his throat. He peeks a glance at Coach Sylvester who doesn’t look fazed, her expression the same as before. After what feels like ages she speaks. “I’ll take that to mean you supported the Vordmolort guy.”
Now, as he sits here peering at her across the Great Hall, he doesn’t feel the compulsion to walk over and greet her with a hug or a kiss like used to at the sight of her.
“But what did he say to you? Was he insulting you?”
“I… I can’t leave my mother and Pansy behind. I’d feel too guilty, and they would be upset with me. I’d be miserable. I’m sorry.”
Hi, so I lied. This took much longer to post than I said I would, because I wrote a lot more than I planned to. Thank you
the dramatic one, I see. Well, Skrewt, save it until you’ve had your lunch.”
about it.”
“Yes, Potter, perhaps you should pay Madam Pomfrey a visit to have your head checked, because it seems you’ve forgotten that Draco is in fact my name,” Draco cuts in, sneering. He wants to redirect the subject of this conversation as fast as possible before Potter reminds Granger—
She begins to slowly pace back and forth across the hearth, examining the students intently as if she’s a lion stalking her prey.
“Who said you could talk, Count Dracula?” Coach Sylvester spits, pointing her finger in his face.
After that, Draco changes the subject and Pansy allows him to, not bringing the issue up again.
“Oh come on,” Ron says, “I’m just trying to remind Hermione that Malfoy isn’t the knight in shining armor she thinks he is now.”
“A favor.”
But after a long period of introspection at the Burrow this past summer, he’d only come to one conclusion: he doesn't want to get back together with Ginny.
Draco gasps, widening his eyes in false terror. “Oh, you scare me Potter. I better hold onto my hat or your confidence may blow it away.”
“So what happened when you went after Smith?” He asks once they're both out of earshot.
A moment later, Theo moves swiftly to the pear and tickles it, disappearing into the kitchen without another word.
Draco swallows, hand momentarily itching to touch his mark. “Yes.”
“Anyway, I also found out from the Savior himself that he doesn’t want to get back together with She-Weasley,” Pansy declares.
Draco nods slowly, taking a sip of his tea to calm his nerves. “Well, The D— V-Voldemort,” he chokes out with a shiver crawling through him, “was a powerful wizard who advocated for Pureblood supremacy and sought to take Wizards out of hiding. He wanted to destroy Muggle-borns and overtake the Muggles. It was a pretty far-fetched goal if you ask me.”
Hermione sighs. “Well, he’ll come to his senses eventually.”
“No of course I haven’t, your presence always endears me.”
Ron turns to Harry desperately, “It’s only the second week and we’ve already lost her to her books. Harry we need to do something! It’s been over a week since her and I—”
“Harry! Why did you make that bet with him? You know how easily he gets riled up by you!” She says, taking a seat across from him. He doesn’t bother pointing it out.
Thanks for reading! Taking a bit of a break because I need to catch up on school, but I will try to update soon. :)
Draco collapses on his bed, resting his hands behind his head. leaning the back of his head on his hands. “Fruitlessly practicing my patronus.”
They’re lucky this time that it’s four against one; in other instances, they have not been as fortunate. Just yesterday, Greg returned to their room with a broken wrist which Draco promptly mended for him. After spending several months stuck with a madman inside his home, Draco had added a few healing spells to his arsenal. This had been a smart decision, for this knowledge prevented many scars from marring his body after that point.
Weasley scoffs, “No, I actually wish you did. It’d serve the Ferret right. Show the tosser who’s boss… bloody death eater—”
“Was this just now?”
a pointy, pathetic—”
Draco blinks at her, still struggling to wrap his head around this information. “Allow me to clarify. You’re telling me that Leader of the Dunderheads Potter, who can’t even bother to somewhat fix his hair, somehow got a hold of a decent batch of Felix Felicis? Melin, save us all. If you try to convince me he brewed it himself, I’ll think you’ve gone absolutely mad and I’ll have to stage an intervention.”
“Ok, first order of business, I gathered some new information for you after you left breakfast this morning.”
Weasley’s face flushes to a color indistinguishable to his hair, “Well,
Thanks for reading! :) Let me know what you think in the comments (they’re really motivating!!)
As soon as they exit the portrait, they both release their breaths and relax their postures. Draco briefly squeezes his shoulder comfortingly, and Theo returns it with a warm smile. After a moment, they both start walking down the corridor side by side, their hands a hair’s breadth away from touching.
Weasley unconsciously drops the bacon back on his plate as he stares back at her, fear displayed plainly on his face.
“Of course it would be, it’s why you did it, yes? Anyway, my point stands. You couldn’t last in this game if your life depended on it.” Draco challenges.
“No, I’m not asking you for any favors I just—”
Ron laughs through a mouthful of sausage. “As if you didn’t already brag about Harry saving you—”
“Draco, trust me. You’ll want to know now stop being difficult!” Pansy exclaims before leaning in close to whisper, “I have Zacharias Smith.”
Draco groans.
Draco rolls his eyes, accepting that his afternoon has been officially compromised and there is no hope of getting any revision done now, “Always the hero aren’t you, Potter? Here to stop the wretched Death Eater from his nefarious crimes.”
She scrunches her face in frustration. “I’m giving Blaise an earful later,” she says, pulling her hands back. “But do you want me to help you with your hair? I know a few grooming spells...”
“Fair point,” Draco concedes.
“Well, have you apologized to them all yet?” Pansy asks impatiently, “I feel it’s about time you do. I already have.”
“There is something I would like to show you, Draco,” she says, her voice briefly faltering before collecting herself. Draco’s stomach drops at the sight of his mother. He has been with her long enough to know when apprehension is circulating through her body, even when she may be hiding it. The lines of her face have worsened, aging her more in the past few months than in the past several years. Her once long luscious strands have thinned. However, Draco still considers her to be the most beautiful woman he has ever laid his eyes on.
Theo breaks his gaze away, resuming his nonchalant demeanor, “Not necessarily upset, but a bit bitter, yes. I don't think she realized she wasn't wearing the hat until after I shot her.” He shrugs.
that and the last thing we need to do is fulfill the role they expect us to play as evil former Death Eaters and Death Eater children,” Pansy insists.
It was a truly enormous ice cream sundae. At least five scoops of a variety of flavors, whipped cream, cherries, sprinkles, chocolate sauce, chocolate candies.
Harry's tone is pure sarcasm, but Malfoy just smirks and says, "If the options are me or Ginny Weasley?" He holds his hand out to the side, as if he's just solved a complicated mathematical proof. "Q.E.D."
“What do you think Weasley will do?” Draco asked. “If Hermione keeps her beard?”
orgasms. He doesn't worry about making fun of Draco and whether Draco will take it the wrong way. He doesn't worry about his jokes being too dark. He doesn't worry about any of it. It's the most natural thing in the world to walk into the classroom and plop into the seat next to Draco, their knees accidentally-on-purpose knocking together.
It was James. James, in their foyer at half seven. James, in the foyer at half seven, surrounded by what appeared to be all his worldly possessions. Trunks, bags, cardboard boxes held together with a combination of tape, magic, and hope.
"It's going to be harder now, this thing with us." Harry rubbed his palm down Draco's arm. "Because real is harder."
"Is it going to wake Granger?" Draco's folded himself into a seat on the floor behind the coffee table, one long leg bent up in front of him, carton in his hand. His stomach is all bunched up from his strange position, and there's a purple hickey on his chest near his collarbone.
There was a moment in which their children and friends sort of looked around at each other, like a silent game of Not It. No one was surprised when, eventually, everyone's eyes landed on Hermione.
but that was neither here nor there.
Harry looks into his tea. "I don't know. Nothing makes sense."
Draco smiled.
Harry shrugs. "You're still an arsehole."
Draco had turned his torso to the right, looking behind him. After a moment, he released and twisted the other way. Watching him like this made Harry aware of being an outsider—like he shouldn’t have access to Draco’s before-bed routine.
“Well, I guess we’ll find out,” Draco grumps, gesturing to where Pomfrey had disappeared.
"That's—that's a good idea," Harry said.
"I don't even like Kneazles!" Harry sighed, running a hand over his face.
Draco's hair was back to its usual length today, but he still had the beard. And he was wearing a short skirt again. This time it was a brown corduroy.
"My boob feels weird."
“I know that I am unable to take Hiccoughing Solution or its variations, because they rely on mugwort or other artemisias.”
Malfoy’s mouth curled up and he huffed out half a laugh. “I mean, it’s not like we can be friends now. Tell me your most pessimistic thoughts about me, Potter. I know that’s what you’re good at these days—I’ve seen your parchment for Penelope.”
At the next “workshop” with Penelope, she sat looking at Harry's and Malfoy's parchments, both with full “negative automatic thoughts” columns and nothing else filled in.
"No, I don't mean—I mean, we should tell her that we're secretly dating and that you are going to run for office and we're wondering the best PR strategy for breaking it to the public. So we tell her everything except that we're not really, you know, together."
Draco sighed. "Look, I don't want you to feel like a prisoner here. It's your house now, and it's plenty big enough for both of us. You're welcome anywhere. You can search through my drawers and read all my papers, snoop in my cosmetic potions. It's not like that Muggle film where the Sphinx shouts,
"What do you see?"
Malfoy stares at him for a moment, but when Harry doesn't show any sign of understanding, he raises one pale eyebrow and lets his eyes fall to Harry's feet, dragging them back up slowly. Harry can
Draco snorted.
Harry exhaled loudly, overcome with sensation, trying to adjust to the feeling of Draco's mouth on him. "Mmm," he said, melting into the bed and squeezing Draco's soft shoulder, "higher up with the tongue."
"That feels amazing," Harry chokes as Malfoy starts wanking him again, his head lolling to the side, falling away from Malfoy's mouth.
Teddy's hair slowly morphed from neon pink to a deep blue. "I don't know, it's like—none of these issues have any clear-cut rules or definitions or policies. It's easiest for me to explain just using examples of me. Like, I can morph my body to look like whatever I want, right? Any parts. I could change my biology every day. Does that make me trans? It's certainly a different experience than a trans person who isn't a metamorphmagus, but is it roughly the same like, category? How could we ever answer that? It's messy. What if I'm in a relationship with a cis man and every time I'm with him, my body is female? Is that a heterosexual relationship? Or like, it's queer for me because I'm always queer no matter what—but what about for that bloke. Is he queer now? We use all these labels because they're amazing and they help people and establish that we have
"Try it," I say. "Do magic."
Malfoy looked torn between annoyance at the inconvenience and amusement at Harry's expense.
Draco had closed his eyes at some point, and he cracked them open lazily and grinned. "See, I knew you always wanted the attention of the press. Public persona." He dragged out the final vowel to preposterous lengths.
Malfoy reached out a hand and laid it on Harry's knee to still the movement. "I think maybe that's wrong. I don't think it's that you don't want to be imagining it. I think you want me to be imagining it, too."
"Seriously though, are you alright?" Draco asks. Their eyes meet, and Harry doesn't see any joking in those silver eyes. "Buying a bunch of admittedly lovely and thoughtful gifts doesn't do much to convince me that you're okay. Which was really what this was about. You realise that, right? I wasn't cross with you; I was worried."
"Okay, okay," Harry said, laughing. "I meant, normal for you. I want you to act like Malfoy."
Hermione nodded. “Quite. Should we call Luna or do we need to deal with the slug-brains at the Prophet?”
Problem was, Harry awoke not to the sound of his alarm, or to the morning hazy feeling of a body stirring next to him, but to the commotion of Draco launching himself out of bed ("Mother
"I know, I'm just being pathetic. Anyway, what did Aunt Peggy say? You said she said something."
Hermione, unconcerned to be partnerless, imitates the swaying motion by herself.

to wear them. He didn't truthfully know much about his Indian heritage or culture. As far as he knew, only one of his grandparents was Indian, and he worried that he'd be seen as appropriating the culture for political gain, especially because of his extensive privilege in the wizarding world.
When he got to Penelope's office, he wasn't sure whether he should look at Malfoy and pretend to smile like nothing was weird, or ignore him, or make some excuse for having cancelled their plans. Fortunately Malfoy made the decision for him by staring resolutely ahead, into Penelope's fire, not so much as glancing at Harry.
For a minute, Harry ate in silence, feeling awkward as more and more time passed without either of them saying anything. He knew he was eating too fast, and Malfoy with his pure-blood table manners was probably judging him, but he needed for his mouth to be occupied. Eventually, he stopped and said, "So is there like, a type of curse breaking that is your speciality?"
Harry carries the forks in and gives Draco what he intends to be a stern look. "It's one o'clock in the morning. You want to play Duck Hunt?"
Harry bounded towards him and wrapped him in a one-armed hug. "Mate! It's been too long."
“Yes,” Draco says, smiling, pushing his hand against Harry’s chest. “But not until you’re back to looking your own age.”
"Perhaps this is how I like to celelbrate."
, Harry wanted to say. But not with his light or with the almost-silent noise of pages turning. “No, you’re fine, just having trouble falling asleep.”
"Ugh," Harry groaned. "Fine. I can't believe I'm going to marry you. What a crock of shit." Draco's mouth split into a tentative smile that grew wider every second. "This is what the ancient philosophers meant when they said that duty comes before pleasure. Here, we need to drink more." Harry poured more whiskey in their glasses.
Draco frowned. Harry imagined he had little knowledge of female reproductive health. "So how do they cure it?"
"Than the war, than school."
"An escort service would be more circumspect, though I expect you may have ethical qualms."
to talk to me. I thought you wanted me. I thought you wanted us to be—to be a team!"
But no one was here to see, so Harry coughed and turned, pointing toward the penguins. “How’s your tolerance of rotten fish smell?”
"Don't say 'the ladies' like that, Teds," Lily said, wrinkling her nose. "It makes you sound like a douche."
I hum in agreement. "Not quite right, but at least it won't give anyone nightmares. What do we do now?"
Harry laughed. “Long story, but yeah. I’m actually looking forward to it, I think. I mean, maybe it was a stupid thing to plan. But getting out of the castle for a bit. No offence to you two.”
"Well," Draco said, reaching for a pitcher and casting Aguamenti, "I don't align myself with the left in terms of my identity quite as much as you do. So I imagine yes, that's just you. The most strategic action we can take to protect the environment is to get elected."
Fuck.
in giant block letters.
to belong there any more—why do you think I live in this Muggle flat? I don't belong here, but I don't want to belong where I do belong, so here I am. Faking it until I make it."
. I shudder.
Hermione opens her mouth, closes it, then closes her book and drops it to the floor with a loud
Harry frowned, struggling to keep up, more than a little distracted by the feel of Draco's body.  "Was that a non sequitur? Or is there grandfather lovin' in

Robards rubbed a hand over his red face. “What about Potter’s grubby trainers?”
For a moment they stared at the phials.

ever run away from the war?"
that's aggravating.
Interesting.
“Doesn’t make it any easier to hear those things.”
Harry stares at him.
When they had said their goodbyes and gone, Harry hugged Draco from behind and pressed a kiss to his neck. (Draco wouldn't admit to a living or departed soul the extreme tenderness he felt in response.) "Good thing you're here to distract me when she goes home. I think I would've been a bit of a mess about it if I were still living alone."
"You invited me for dinner but you don't have any food?" Draco asks drolly, raising one teasing eyebrow.
Draco, amused, nodded. "You've looked like Concerned Father Harry since 2004."
"Alright," Malfoy said, looking uncomfortable as he turned towards the front of the queue.
The pretending to be Draco's lover, on the whole, was strange. It was largely strange because most of the time, Harry forgot about it. They went about their lives—in closer proximity to each other than before, to be sure—but acting much the same as always. But then, when other people were around, there were moments like this—him touching Draco or Draco touching him—and Harry never quite saw the latter coming. He continually forgot that he was supposed to be pretending, and then Draco would do something like this and Harry would be hyper aware of the heat of Draco's hand on his shoulder—of the way that an unfamiliar touch felt twenty times more noticeable than it should. It made tingles erupt down his spine, and he sat up, turning to look at Draco and giving a smile he hoped the kids would think looked content.
Harry tries to focus on Malfoy's face. The rest of the room feels a little blurry, but he can focus on the face. "Your hair is longer."
Harry tried to keep the horror off his face, not wanting to insult them. "We don't want any of that. We don't want a fictionalised account or merch or whatever."
"Intense?"
It's not legally possible and even if—"
"Harry," Draco said, weary, his eyes closed and nose still pinched, "you know I hate it when people say 'pull out' in the context of treaties and/or membership from organisations. I'm already being tested by the Minister, I don't need to be further antagonised by your regrettable turns of phrase. There's no rhythm method of international politics."
"Does this mean I can start buying baby things?"
“With…..?” Ron asked, his face visibly bracing for the hit.
She's never said it to Harry before. Harry drops his head into his hands, and lets the tears come.
"Yeah, they did." Harry didn't tell Draco it had been one of the first times he had felt kinship with Draco, watching him get angry about his son's treatment in the media. It was a fight Harry had waged constantly since his kids were born. Nothing made him upset faster than the media printing shit about his kids. "But Scorp is fine, Draco."
Draco was really getting agitated now, and Harry couldn't stop his laughter. "Look, Draco, if I'm completely honest, I haven't had sex outside of a relationship….ever. Wait no, once, which confirmed that I'm not interested in it. I'm old. I know how to deal with my libido. I can…what did you say?…attend to my genitals on my own."
"We could have sex again." Harry stares at him.
Harry grabs Draco's ankle and tugs it forward. "How do you like it?"
Harry snorted. "It could never have been different. But go ahead, then, tell me how it should've been."
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t know. What do you want me to imagine? What will be served for dinner? That maybe next time Ron will share his ice mice?”
anyone else, your father is below me."
"See?" Scorpius said, gesturing at Harry with delight. "We don't need to buy stuff."
"You're loved, you're loved, you're loved," Harry whispers. Teddy falls asleep, and Harry lets the tears come.
"Hermione," Harry whispered, leaning into her shoulder. "Lily got me drunk. Make sure I don't do drunk things."
Harry looks up. "Nothing makes sense."
“I know.”
sort of smile, and she nudges him. "I'm serious. I don't sit in a tent half-starving and half-freezing for months on end with just anyone. I love you, Harry."
the one who should be living with Hermione." Ron sounds a bit petulant now.
Malfoy's head turned, his silvery eyes looking straight at Harry for a moment before turning forward again. "I know. I'm depressed, too, remember? It's hard not to take things personally, though. With us."
"Do you have any other sentient objects on your person?" Draco asked, turning around, face full of mirth. "Are your socks going to critique our snogging? Do you have a mobile named Brunhilde who will set timers to gauge our stamina? A pocketwatch named Dietrich who will store data on your refractory period?"
"What would you like to drink?" Draco asked, taking their orders and walking towards the bar cart, putting his hand on Harry's lower back as he walked past.
Draco opens his mouth to object, but finds that he’s in a tight spot. If he admits that he finds Harry sexiest when he’s chopping wood, it will contradict years of claims to the contrary. But if he doesn’t say that, Harry will think Draco finds him sexiest like
Malfoy appeared to have finished too, but Harry didn’t want to ask what he’d been writing about. He didn’t want to spoil the pleasant silence.
"Quite right. And Teddy and Hermione want you too, Merlin knows why. They must have an inexplicable affinity for wild mops of hair. And who knows how this bizarre little family of yours will expand over the years. Hermione's Aunt Peggy, for one. She'll be cooking you hot-pot and you'll be cat sitting for her before you know it. And Andromeda, of course. We'll have to reconcile her with my mother. Oh, and my mother. Goodness, Potter, just wait until my mother decides you fall under the category of 'family.' You'll be trying to dodge her owls before you know it."
That's doable. Nothing has ever been casual with Malfoy, has it? "It's not casual," Harry echoes, nodding.
“It was like...you couldn’t stop daydreaming?” Harry ventured. “About all sorts of things? And you want to talk about it all, even if it’s completely unlikely?” It was a hard feeling to put into words.
Harry had come to like Penelope in the weeks they’d been meeting. She was kind and fair, but firm and took no shit. He found that he didn’t want to show her that she’d overestimated his capability—he didn’t want to prove that he was even more fucked up than she already thought.
“Yeah, I dunno, it was actually kind of nice. Fuck, I dunno.”
"Well, yeah. You know George thinks of you like a brother. And you're a bit nearer than Charlie, who probably can't get here just for a therapy intervention. At least, unless it were really important. But we can probably do this without Charlie, if we're all there."
Her voice was terse, but Harry smiled. They'd worked together when they were both active Aurors. He could see the concern behind her stern expression. He could also see her eagerness in the twinkle of her eyes.
Ginny peered around at them. "Is he freaking out?" She took a step back, hands up. "That's all you, now, Malfoy." Her words sounded sharp, but she patted Harry's back comfortingly before walking a few steps away with Astoria, giving Harry space.
"Oh good, you're here, I—" Draco turned to look at him and abruptly stopped, his eyes dropping to Harry's bare legs.
At five weeks old, Aster seemed more human and less aquatic. She made eye contact and imitated facial expressions, and Harry was beyond smitten. Aster was the first baby with whom he didn't have to worry about rushing off to work, which made him a little sad about his own children's infancies. He could never go back and be free for
was here to fill out some paperwork and said they'll be back again later."
Draco's neck flushed with heat—embarrassment or anger, he couldn't distinguish. "Well then, go ahead. Hit me with your honesty. I can't wait to hear all the things you haven't said to me over the last two years."
“Malfoy and I are going skateboarding this weekend,” Harry said.
"Cooking," Harry offers weakly, gesturing to the absolutely trashed kitchen. Every surface is covered with tools and ingredients and splatters. There's a half-spatula-half-spoon that seems to be slowly morphing back into its original form.
when you chew them.) I arranged an execution order for a Hippogriff because it inflicted upon me an injury that Madam Pomfrey called, "nothing more than a mild bruise with high visibility due to light complexion." (It hurt, I still maintain. And clearly, my dignity has never recovered.
Harry had always been like this—he had these times of certainty. In Quidditch, in the war, in his love for his kids, in the way he threw himself into political campaigns. In the look in his eye when he revealed he wasn't dead and faced Voldemort.
Draco blinked, stoically looking away from Harry's legs. He seemed to visibly gather his equanimity, and when he met Harry's eyes, all traces of fluster were gone. "Would you care to put trousers on before I tell you news of international importance?" When Harry didn't answer, he continued, "I'm not sure how you usually approach these things. Perhaps minor news items can be relayed whilst nude, whereas important news items require full dress?"
Harry leaned forward, tilting his head and fitting it into the space between Draco's ear and shoulder. "I want to. I know it's not an obligation."
I managed not to say ‘I told you so’? I am fucking father of the year.”
"What?!" Harry asked.
There she is—heading back into the crowd, a few feet to their right. "HERMIONE!" She doesn't hear. "
sometimes it was too much, how Harry was just like this, "we need to get rid of magically binding entails."
He probably should've got a smaller place years ago, but the truth was that any time he considered leaving it, he got sad.
"I'm only saying you can't
Draco stiffened. "You went to her first, then?"
"Old-man knee," Draco said, tsking. "My knee is fine. It's your brain that's going."
Oh, Merlin. Draco was going to say it.
“—so I know you’ll be able to understand what I mean when I say that your depression is causing you to employ logical errors in your thought processes. If we learn how to analyse these logical errors, we can identify our unhelpful thought patterns and redirect them with alternative thoughts.”
"STRIP HER DOWN!"
“And do what when I have to retire in ten years?”
Malfoy starts laughing, shaking his head as if this is hilarious. "You look so
Draco frowned at the cheese. Sometimes, little things like this were enough to halt him in his tracks, to make him question whether the world could ever get better. Whether it was worth saving.
"Potter, quit staring at me. You're holding up the queue."
Draco raised his hands and performed a slow clap.
Draco turned towards Harry, raising an eyebrow. "Is that so?"
She props herself up on an elbow. "You had a fight?"
He's put everything off for his whole life, but there's no reason to do that anymore.
"Yeah," Harry says, smiling. "And Teddy."
"Wait, everyone at RAMag who went to Hogwarts?" Harry asks, suddenly realising that means Hermione wants to invite Malfoy to their flat.
Draco stopped stretching and leaned back on his hands. “Well then, go ahead. Let’s see.”
It took Harry an embarrassingly long moment to realise who Greg and Vince were. “Imagine we enjoy our last year here, before we have to go do...whatever it is that adults do.”
The Wizengamot calls Malfoy out, but Harry is barely paying attention. How does anyone who's expecting a baby get on with their regular life? How does anyone just pretend like things are normal?
are trying to delegate? You strike me as a person who hates delegating.”
That had to be the most suspicious thing Malfoy had ever said to Harry, and
"Oh, sweet Merlin," Harry hissed, and Ron, the traitor, devolved into giggles.
"Harry."
Hermione started to giggle and threw the book onto the floor. “Oh Merlin, that’s funny.”

as this robust thing, but then you stand on the edge of it and remember that it's just—not."
"Gender-neutral for niece or nephew," Draco answered quickly before moving on. "But we can't talk about the kids without their permission. We should start with me. I mean, the dashing lover angle."
The foot tapped. Harry noticed that Draco's shoes were nice—shiny, but not pretentious. There seemed to be adequate toe space—one of Harry's main fashion pet peeves was shoes without adequate toe space. Even an Undetectable Extension wasn't ideal for foot health.
, we can probably even influence the way they report on it. To make it seem like it's you against Rump, you know? And then you'll win the case, and when the election comes, everyone will be like, oh, we already know this story—Draco Malfoy beats Norris Rump."
Gardon was Astoria's husband. He was a Charms Theorist. Astoria smiled at Harry from over Ginny's shoulder. "Hullo, Harry. He's in Wales, but he's going to come back tonight."
"Aster," Ginny said, reaching out and placing a hand on the baby's blanket. "You're a strong woman already, aren't you?"
there, those months in the tent—he can't fully understand, you know?"
"Well I'm not going to force you!" Harry said, annoyed at the lack of enthusiasm.
He's been a bad friend lately—too focused on his own shit. He looks up at Hermione. "Are you and Ron...going to be okay?"
“mess with my plans! Look at me!”
"It really turns one's stomach, doesn't it?" Scorpius reached for Albus's hand.
“Er, Draco?” Harry blinked in confusion. “What’s wrong?”
"My parents," Draco said, pulling out a knife and slicing emphatically through a Truffle Baron Bigod, watching with satisfaction as the creamy middle began to ooze, "put me in ambulation charms at six months. Being a baby, you see, was undignified, so therefore I
"Hazza P!" Lee enthused, whacking him lovingly on the back.
"And we want to make sure," Draco continued, "that we break the news of our relationship to the public in the most strategic way possible, both for us and our families and for the success of my candidacy."
Draco pulled his hand away, used it to lightly smack Harry's cheek, then placed it caressingly back, thumb resuming its path.
Harry grinned. "What? It's interesting. I like curses. They’re like, dangerous enough to be thrilling, but not as intense as trying to catch a person breaking the law. You need to be smart, but you're kinda like a lone ranger."
Lee turned toward him slowly. "Malfoy," he said and shook Draco's hand.
, “so funny, Potter?”
It was pleasant enough by the lake, birds chirping, the distant distinctive sound of hippogriff squawks, and the odd bray of a thestral providing a backdrop of sound that mixed with the scratching of Malfoy’s quill. Harry’s Conjured quill broke, as expected, and after his third Conjured quill, Malfoy sighed and pulled a spare quill from his robe. Harry nodded his thanks and imagined how strange it was to be writing with a quill that Malfoy had used before—maybe he’d used it to write personal thoughts in a diary. Maybe he’d used it during the war.
He pulled open the door, and there was Malfoy—
, but it's a little too close to unwanted fantasies from which I suffered in year three, so I close my eyes and pretend to rest.
He couldn't remember why he wasn't supposed to show his interest in Draco. Surely he'd had a reason for downplaying it, for acting like it was no big deal to pretend it didn't exist. He must have had a reason for being so
A grumbling noise distracted him from his thoughts.
Draco threw an arm around Hermione’s shoulders and rubbed her beard with a brotherly fist. “Indeed we are. Is there a problem?”
“We both hate small talk,” Harry said. “If I’m asking, I am showing genuine interest.”
? Can you imagine what Rump would say? He'd probably convince the voters I would install glory holes in the Ministry loos."
If Draco vomited all over himself and the floor, he wondered how long it would take Lorraine to appear and Vanish the mess. Could she do it before Harry noticed?
"Too right," Harry said. "Nothing small about me."
"I mean," Harry said, feeling like a fool and with no idea what to say, "it's suspicious only because he won't tell me what it is." Dominique leaned forward, nuzzling her little head into Harry's chest.
For a moment, Harry's face was blank. Then he affected a cocky grin. "Yeah, obviously."
Draco leaned forward without dropping Harry's hand. "Our families are already integrated, we have similar interests, we work for the same causes. We spent a lot of time together campaigning for Penelope Clearwater."
However Harry had a hard time answering the question to a dead man about it. "Do you really want to know?"
As always, kudos & comments are very much appreciated!
Malfoy faded into nothing- just air swirling around and Harry stared in fascination. Once, Malfoy truly disappeared from his sight, Harry quickly made his way home.
Harry finds himself standing near the forbidden forest yet again. The growing curiosity inside of him is starting to cloud his thoughts and judgements thus leading him back here, to find more clues about Malfoy. Hoping that it'll give him a sense of ease.
"Thank you for coming here and taking all of them back to where they belong." Narcissa said with a smile. She looked older, perhaps the war tires her out.
He waited in the living area and suddenly Bitts appeared with a box floating above the air and a note in his little hands. He gave the note to Harry and the box set down aside him. Then Bitts disapparated.
"What makes you say that?" Harry walked towards beside him, staring at the boy with questions racing in his mind, begging for an answer.
"Then how can you tap on my shoulder earlier?" This seems to make Malfoy confused as he stopped focusing his attention onto the telly.
Both of them stood silently, not knowing what to say or comfort each other. Harry admired the gloomy atmosphere of the forest. It's both calming and serene despite the haunting stories and paranormal activities amongst here.
But first, he had to go back to the Ministry and find out more about Draco's whereabouts.
"I'm afraid I can't be with you, Harry. My portkey to France leaves in about 30 minutes." She smiled sadly. Harry and Narcissa had been on first name basis ever since she saved his life.
He gave her a reassuring smile, "Don't worry about it. I can handle it myself. I hope you enjoy your time in France, you really deserve it." She looks at him fondly and pulled him into a hug then bid goodbyes to him and Bitts.
"Figures. Feels like I've been dead for years though." He leaned against the tree, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Thank you Draco. This is the sweetest thing anyone has ever done to me." He declared, grinning at him in which the pale man returned back with a grin of his own.
He nodded sleepily and threw the takeout away before heading upstairs but before entering his room, he called Draco out. "Goodnight Draco!" A blink and Draco appeared in front of him, a small smile etched on his lips. "Goodnight Harry." Then he vanished.
Draco placed his elbow on the table and rest his face on the palm of his hand. "Of course I do." He sighed. "I miss being a normal human being. I can't really do much nor can I feel anything anymore. I can't even make physical contact with living beings." He admitted with discontent in his tone.
Harry set the board down on the table as Draco sat on the floor. He eyes Harry, "How are you? I mean after Hogwarts."
He muttered, "Sorry. You don't need to answer that. Just.. forget what I said."
He stared into Harry's emerald eyes. "Bits and pieces, I'm afraid. When you die, you don't often remember parts of your life." He exhales. "I remember feeling like I was suffocating, my lungs are felt like it was filled with water. A sharp stinging pain in my stomach and my chest feels like someone is constantly stabbing me repeatedly."
They played the rest of the game in silence with Harry secretly stealing glances at the pale man. Draco knows Harry is eyeing him while trying to appear nonchalant but Draco remains unbothered, too drained to say what's on his mind.
Hope all of you enjoyed it!
After their breakfast chatter, Harry showered and dressed himself. He didn't have any work today since it was the weekend so he wore casual clothes instead of robes. He was trying to tame his hair when Draco appeared at his side.
Malfoy lifted his head to look at the crows. "You sure do ask a lot of questions, aren't you Potter?" He teased.
"What does it feel like?" Harry changed the subject as Draco arched his brow. "Being a phantom?" His curiosity got the best of him, realizing what he had said as he looked up to Draco who was clearly taken aback by the question.
⋆﹥━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━﹤⋆
Again, apologies for the misspellings and grammar mistakes. English is not my native language.
He trudges downstairs, ruffling his curly hair and made his way towards the kitchen. His sleepy eyes bulged wide open when he saw Draco placing the strawberry on top of the stacks of pancakes.
After getting his glasses back, he realizes that the locket was nowhere to be found. A wave of panic surges up on him, frantically looking for the jewelry. Another whiff of cold gushed through him.
They walked through multiple hallways and doors. Dust covered paintings and paintings that had been covered by black cloths. He wondered how big this manor actually is. Thankfully, he can't feel the dark magic lurking around this part of the manor.
Draco sighed, "Well, I moved to muggle London and lived there alone after the war. I couldn't stand living in the manor, mother was really distraught on me leaving though." He inhaled, "Made some friends with muggles. They were quite lovely. Adopted a cat named Scorpius and learned how to paint whilst dealing with a deadly illness." He arranged the pieces on the board. To think that Draco was living a fairly normal life just to be taken away from him makes Harry feel dejected.
Harry sat on the opposite side of Draco, counting the pieces and gave some to Draco. "Fine, I suppose. After completing my N.E.W.T.S, I took on the job offer for becoming an auror."
"Yeah. We can't." He agreed.
He scoffed, "Used to. Even if I used to, I'd still think it looks good on you." He confessed, glancing around Harry's room. That statement made Harry's stomach flutter.
He huffed, "Well, what should we do today, Harry Potter?" He smiled slyly.
"What about you? Before you..." He trailed off, observing Draco's blank expression. He hoped that he hadn't crossed the line yet.
"We're barely living. We're helpless and we're losing hope. To be stuck in this place without having the power to do something is aggravating. Imagine dying to only be stuck here because your soul has unfinished business and you can't cross over. Shitty isn't it?" He huffed, scowling. In this moment, he looks so broken, like he lost every ounce of hope that he had.
"Huh... not surprised. You are the chosen one after all. The saviour of us all." He remarked sarcastically which earned a groan from Harry.
Harry eyed the locket then glances back at its owner. "Looking for clues."
"Hmm... I don't know where he is now. I saw him while I was in muggle London back then. He was alone and he looked quite bad honestly. Very pale and sickly. He was buying some items in the supermarket but that's about it."
Malfoy nods his head sadly, avoiding his gaze. He acknowledges the fact that he's not alive anymore and somehow that made Harry feel dejected.
Malfoy was inches away from Harry's hand but he can feel the cold breeze radiating off of the taller man.
He yawned which made Draco stopped watching the telly and turned his gaze towards him. "You can go to sleep if you'd like. Don't mind me, I'll just roam around."
⋆﹥━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━﹤⋆
Ginny wanted more and needed Harry to commit however Harry felt like he wasn't ready. It was too much of a responsibility. Harry just wanted space and time to heal and find himself again before committing to someone on a deeper bond. The war scarred him badly and he simply wasn't in the right mental state to be in a serious relationship.
He looked at the elf in front of him. "Hello master Potter, I will be taking you to the storage room." His gaze went back to Narcissa.
He frowned, "About what?"
"Do you have any plans for today?" He asked nonchalantly.
He hummed, "Maybe around July...? Like 10 July or something like that."
Harry mentally cursed himself for asking him a question like that. "Your pancakes are really good. The best ones I've had for sure." With the topic changed, Draco smiled at him softly as Harry continues to eat the pancakes.
He bit his lip, humming. "I guess there's no harm in following you. Are you sure you don't mind?" Harry reassured him and they both stood up, preparing to leave.
"Apologies for forgetting to tell you this but master Draco has left you a letter as well as a box of his belongings to you, master Potter." Curiously, he asked Bitts to bring him the said letter and the box.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco merely looked at him as he examines his fingernails. "It's boring and frustrating. The worst part is that we can't do anything. It's like we're living but we're not actually living. We don't get to feel what it's like to feel emotions again or the smell the scent of the muddy dirt of Earth." He exhales. "We can't caress someone else's skin again nor can we feel the warmth of their embrace. We're empty. Our immune system stopped working and our brain is frozen. All we do is sit and mope around this planet and wait till we get to cross over." He shuts his eyes close and breathes.
"I don't even know what I'm suppose to find out about." He complained frustratingly.
The way his name rolled off Draco's tongue makes Harry shivers. He doesn't even know why his heart is beating so fast either. Why is he making Harry feel this way? Maybe it's the coldness emitting off of him whenever Harry's near him.
Suddenly a thought occurred in his mind, "Wait... I thought phantoms couldn't touch humans?" Harry queried, averting his gaze to Malfoy.
When Harry stood in the living room, he scanned for signs of pale blonde hair and blue-grey eyes.
See you all on the next update!
The sound of footsteps makes him alert as he grips his wand in his coat as he spun around, meeting a pale blue eyed man.
A few days later, he found out that Malfoy lives in London and lives in an apartment by himself near the city. He has not been in contact with his friends from school.
Whew...
He furrowed his brows questionably, "Place your hands up as if you're trying to high five someone." Harry obeyed what he said and waited, the Chinese takeout sits on the table.
They finally stopped at a huge black door, Bitts opened the door and guided him in. For a storage room, it was sure very organised and clean. There was a large black table and on top of it was stack of boxes, labelled with
He nodded. "7 months. About to get into 8, I'd reckoned, depending on when you died." He can hear him sigh.
"Why not?" He croaked, swallowing his pride. Malfoy quickly glanced at Harry, eyes widened. "It must be quite boring to stay here all day, let alone, months!" Harry exaggerated. "Why not, follow me back home. At least you could torment me for your own amusement." He offered. He doesn't know why but the thought of leaving Malfoy all alone in this haunted forest doesn't feel right.
They went back to resuming what they did prior, the noodles no longer tasted as delicious as before and Malfoy fixated on the telly, watching the women arguing over a wedding dress.
The pancakes Draco made were soft and fluffy. It tastes like a heaven's made pancakes and it probably was. He didn't even realize that Draco could cook let alone this good. He wouldn't mind eating this everyday.
Harry felt his heart dropped, "Do you know what month it is today?"
"What a shame." Draco commented.
However that statement rang inside Harry's head instantaneously, it made him feel giddy. Just the two of them, alone and nowhere to hide. He would have to talk to Malfoy everyday and see him every morning he woke up. Harry shook his head furiously.
Harry changed himself lazily and as soon as his head hit the pillows, he's welcomed by deep slumber.
"How long have I've been dead for?" He asked curiously. His face didn't indicate that he was sad about it.
There stood, Draco Malfoy. All pale and ghostly. His black attire remained in tact, sporting a black turtleneck with a coat over him and black fitted trousers. His shiny leather boots glistened as he stand tall in front of Harry. Blonde- almost white hair disheveled underneath the daylight. His expression of bewilderment as he stares straight into Harry's own eyes.
It all started on a sunny afternoon where Robards requested him to pick up all the remaining dark artefacts from the Malfoy Manor. Narcissa Malfoy had willingly stored them away in boxes and is waiting for Harry's arrival. When Harry arrived at the manor, he was greeted by a house elf named Bitts.
to live his life to the fullest.
He looked up and smiled at Harry, "I made you breakfast. I hope you don't mind. I knew you've had a long week helping my case so consider this as a token of gratitude for finding my body and letting me stay here." Harry felt his throat dry, the scent of pancakes immediately making his stomach grumbled in hunger.
He sat down on the leather couch and began unfolding the letter which reads:
"In the storage room. Bitts will show you the way." Then appeared an elf that reminded Harry of Dobby.
"You can't tame your unruly hair. Just leave it be." He suggested, Harry rolled his eyes at him as he lets his hands drop to his side. "You used to call it a bird's nest."
Thank you for reading! I really appreciate it! <3
Harry rolled his eyes in annoyance, "Maybe we could catch up on things. Bond over chess?" He offered, knowing that the taller man played chess back in Hogwarts.
"It's my job to do so. Where have you place all of them?"
Malfoy shrugs, "I guess? I can follow people if I wanted to but I never really left the forest." He gazes at Harry, "Why? Want me to follow you back home?" He says jokingly.
Their hands moved closer, Harry anticipated for the touch but to no avail, Malfoy's hand slipped past Harry's and all he felt was chilled draft. Malfoy frowned, dropping his hand down and stare at the ground, avoiding Harry's eyes.
20 minutes passed by quickly as they sat on the dirty soil, questions still lingering around their minds. Harry glanced at Malfoy who seems to be observing the grass. He finds Malfoy's presence much more tolerable than before. Was it because that he's no longer alive and could not harm Harry or was it because he changed due to the war and his crippling illness that affected him so much?
He apparated into his office and managed to get Ron to collect all the artefacts, bringing them over to Department of Dark Magic. Then he had asked his colleague about Draco Malfoy because he had heard him mentioning the Malfoy heir a few months ago.
Chapter 3 will be updated quite late since I'm going away on a vacation and I have things to sort out in my life first.
When he contacted the landlord, she stated that she hasn't seen Malfoy for 3 months now. She has tried calling him but got no response which eventually leads to his phone turning off completely. Lucky for Malfoy, the landlord is a sweet old lady that didn't mind that Malfoy hasn't paid his rent for 3 months now but only worried about what happened to him,
Draco remains silent for a moment, and he quickly loses his resolve. He’ll just help Pansy get Smith out and then he’ll quit.
At the look of terror on Pansy’s face, Draco relents, “Fine,” He breathes, “But you haven't seen the last of me and my evil schemes. Beware of my wicked blood rituals, Weasley you could be next! Watch your fingernails!” He calls as Blaise and Pansy drag him up the stairs to the dorms.
“It’s okay, you can tell me anything, you know that right?”
“Ah yes, I know. My hair is looking extra voluminous today. I spent more time combing it in honor of the weekend. Now, carry on, nothing else to see here,” Draco says, embodying his haughty, Pureblood persona.
“Yeah, we’ll see about that.”
“Yes, I
Smith gets to his feet and dashes off without another word. Draco stares at the wild storm in Potter’s eyes, the tense stance of his body, and a pleasant feeling stirs inside him. He can’t handle Potter protecting him like this; he doesn’t want to owe him any more than he already does.
Greg is silent again, squeezing his eyes shut. Draco can see he’s thinking of the right words, so he waits patiently. After several seconds, Greg glances up at him, his head still ducked to hide most of his face.
“Perfect, I’ll be back in a moment,” He responds, sending another bright smile to Greg who returns it, a faint blush creeping up his cheeks as Pansy crawls off his lap.
“You know what I just heard from Blaise?” She asks crossly, stepping over to the end of his bed like a cat creeping up to a mouse. “That you agreed to a Seeker’s match with bloody Potter. But, of course, that sounded ridiculous, so I told him, ‘Draco? No, he would never be stupid enough to do something like that, because he has common sense.’ APPARENTLY I WAS
“Do you have a moment?” Her soft tone reverberating through the unmoving room, calmness laced through her words.
” she huffs, “a game that Harry has already begun to obsessively plan for by strategizing with Ron all day about how best to go about playing this match against you.”
“What’s wrong? Why didn’t you come back downstairs? Greg was worried but I reassured him I would come check on you. Talk to me DD,” She prods. He knows she’s just using his childhood nickname on him to make him talk.
“Oh yes it was your choice!” Ginny insists. “You could've let Lockhart handle it, as the famous dueller and hero. Everyone would have been so jealous of me if that were the case. Imagine being saved by
On day 24, he began examining  the wand’s design and abilities out of sheer boredom, curious to know the extent of its power and how it would adjust to his magic. When he determined how minimal his knowledge was, Draco sought to absorb the information from the books residing in the library, left untouched for far longer than he deemed acceptable.
“We shall see then, won’t we Potty?” Draco simply smiles devilishly and pats his cheek, feeling the slight prickle of stubble covering his jaw. He stalks off before Potter can respond, not daring to look back.
“No, but I don’t think it’s like that. You’re not plotting anything,” She says.
As he recites the plan to himself for the 50th time precisely, word for word, he decides it’s finally time. With his heart pounding wildly, he recognizes that if he does not leave now, then he never will. He takes a few minutes to collect his belongings and take a few needed breaths. He decides against saying good-bye to his mother, reassuring himself that he will see her again in a blink of an eye. Draco has never been a brave person, but in his heart he knows this is what he must do. He looks down at the golden pendant placed around his neck, held up within by his hand, his eyes narrow with intent.
“Greg.”
Theo sighs, but thankfully doesn’t press the issue. “Have you thought about it?” He asks.
“Draco, what is your
“Oh, how could I? If it weren’t for you, he would have flunked out of Hogwarts after first year. He’d be sweeping the floors of the Leaky Cauldron by now.”
Meanwhile, Granger looks quite relieved, although Draco can tell she is just as startled as he is. He looks down and sees the book is still on the ground. Granger—still frozen in shock—has not yet processed that it has fallen, and without thinking, he approaches her table.
“Because it’s not allowed, McGonagall said! Also, we’ll just be called ‘cheating Slytherins’.”
He struggles against the bindings, attempting to jerk his limbs around to free himself, but he’s planted firmly against the wall.
“Scurry off little one, or I’ll hex your bollocks until you cry for your mummy,” Blaise sneers.
“Who d’you think you’re looking at
Draco stops his movements abruptly at that, which allows Pansy to pin him to the ground.
Pansy raises an eyebrow, “Not the other two? Or even just the Golden Boy?”
Draco’s words get cut off as someone bursts in from the bathroom and barrels towards him who, to Draco’s horror, is Millie. He swiftly dives off the side of his bed, his body smacking hard against the ground. He pushes through the sharp pain in his ribs as he reaches for his hat resting on the floor. He shoves it on his head just in time as Millie shoots him with the water gun.
“Ew, Draco, please don’t make me lose my appetite,” Pansy pleads, scrunching her face in disgust.
Pansy doesn't respond, but she pokes his shoulder, exasperated.
Draco groans, pushing himself up into a sitting position. “Fuck you, Potter. You better not have broken my face or else it’s the end of you,” he threatens, putting his fallen hat back on his head. When Potter makes it up the stairs, standing over Draco, he looks up and scowls at him with all his might.
“Hush. Anyway, I should be able to call you something that no one else does. That way I’m special. What about Dragon?”
“Is this an interview for the Prophet? Planning to get a good chunk of galleons for this scoop?” Draco snaps, glaring at her. He regrets it as it comes out of his mouth, but he can’t fight his defensive nature.
“Yeah, alright then,” Ron mumbles, taking a large bite out of a piece of toast.
Hermione arches a brow, giving him an incredulous look. “Must you be afraid of someone who’s now dead?”
Draco’s eyes widen at the abrupt transition, and he slowly reaches out, grabbing her shoulders to calm her down, “Hey, listen to me, it’s going to be okay. Everyone knows that Smith is full of it. This is going to blow over, I promise,” He says earnestly.
“Well…” Draco trails off and just stares at her guiltily until the realization sinks in, her red-rimmed eyes widening even further in shock, “You
“No! Call me… Pan Pan!”
Producing a Patronus is something Draco set his mind to before the start of school. He can’t pinpoint the exact moment he came to this decision, but he knows that it’s just something he wants to prove to himself that he can do.
Coach Sylvester’s smirk widens. “Because when I consulted with the Headmistress on who I should ask to help out, she insisted that Potter was the best choice, raving on about him being the youngest seeker in a century or whatever. I wasn’t having it, so I asked her who else played, and she mentioned you. I knew you would be perfect.”
“Theo,” the voice answers.
Draco needs to remember to lock that damn door.
“What about… Dray?”
“She’s really smart. The other day in Charms she helped me with my wand movement, and I managed to do the spell. And… she’s pretty,” Greg confesses, a small smile appearing on his face.
Draco shoots out of his seat, wanting to be as far away from this classroom—and Potter—as possible. As he approaches the door, eyes zeroing in on the handle, Potter walks right in front of him and blocks his sight, the inconsiderate git. Spitefully, Draco picks up his pace.
“I see. Are there any others who no longer repulse you?”
TW: Brief sexual assault (clothed groping and grinding)
“I don’t see why everyone believes you’re evil then if you were practically forced into it.”
Draco sighs, knowing he can’t argue with that. “Fine, give me a moment. I’ll be right down.”
“It’s Reina Sullivan!” the young voice answers back, but Draco suspects this may be a scheme of Millie’s doing.
Draco slumps over the table, fighting to keep his eyes open. He is not in the mood for chatting this morning, but Pansy has yet to stop talking his ear off.
A few turns, and he’s gone.
“No, he didn’t say anything. Why are you so concerned about him? He’s not going to hurt me.”
?” She demands, noticing his foul mood. She grabs his arm, gripping tightly as they walk out of the classroom, “Don’t think I haven’t noticed you glaring at me all of class.”
Somehow, he manages to avoid their badgering questions the next morning as well by speaking as if he doesn’t hear them. They gave up once they reached the Great Hall and Draco droned on about his hatred toward Herbology. Theo never attempted to join in on their insistent chattering, which Draco greatly appreciated.
Hermione rolls her eyes, her lips curved upwards. “Are you going to ask him to help you? Or will I need to for you?”
Ginny snorts loudly, leaning her elbows on the table. “You say that as if you weren’t fighting a basilisk at age twelve.”
A gentle knock breaks Draco out of his reverie, and he turns to see his mother standing at the doorway, her eyes filled with an abiding sadness that has rarely left her face since the day of the trial. Her lavender, silky night gown is as pristine as ever, as she refuses to lose her elegance even behind closed doors—out of principle.
In these hours, Draco no longer feels the need to peer over his shoulder at the sudden shift of a dark figure. Light serves him no purpose, for Draco has every crevice, every sharp turn, and every trick step etched into his mind as he roams the halls. Even then, the ghosts don’t fully escape him, but it’s the only form of solace he could find within the barren walls of the place he once called home.
“Do you want Madam Pince to give us an earful for talking?” Draco asks, keeping his voice quiet.
Potter’s face hardens in determination. “No. I want to. Let’s do it,” he says stubbornly.
, Draco thinks. “I’m not being dramatic, he truly does ruin everything.”
“Ow, Pansy, what was that for?” Blaise cries, covering his stung cheek with his hand protectively.
“Oh, like you weren’t just violating my ears a few minutes ago when informing me how you want Flitwick to climb your—“
“Alright, well at least show me what you’ve been able to do so far. I don't trust your word, I’m sure you can produce more than you say.”
took ages in the bathroom,” she groans.
“Hello Blaise, that’s because you scream every time one of the cards snap and halfway through the game you’ll get distracted by something else, or someone else.”
“It’s not. But Smith ran his filthy mouth and told everyone that I was his target and that I somehow managed to breach the magic that prevents us from hexing our targets.”
She narrows her eyes at him slightly, searching his face. If she’s suspecting something, she doesn’t mention it.
“Enough!” Potter shouts, eyes zeroed in on Draco, his searing tone gaining everyone’s attention. “Zabini is right. What was the point of anything that happened here if we’re just going to accuse people of the worst. This is supposed to be a game that bonds us together rather than one that tears us apart. So everyone just leave Malfoy alone, alright?” He commands firmly.
“Expecto Patr—”
Draco shuts his mouth and sends her his most scornful glower. Who does she think she is? He isn’t going to let some old hag in a hideous tracksuit intimidate him.
“What a filthy looking scarf. I believe this would look best in a fire pit, don’t you agree Greg?” he said, loud enough for Potter to hear. He didn’t dare turn in his direction though, fearful of his reaction.
Hermione takes a moment to breathe and compose herself before speaking. “Harry, if you can recall, I can handle him just fine with my fist,” she says with a small smile.
Normally, Draco would be grateful for the defense, however, he doesn’t needs Potter’s pity, “Oh so everyone listens to the Chosen One when he says to stop, but not Blaise. How—”
“Did you happen to forget about sixth year?”
“I don’t have high hopes for that,” he says wearily, glancing back at her crestfallen expression. “Besides, he doesn’t necessarily have bad reason to suspect me of something nefarious.”
Pansy perks up suddenly, a thought popping into her head. “Oh! This reminds me.”
“How did you get involved? You’re just a teenager. You’re all normally too busy with your heads between each other’s legs.”
Millie shrugs, examining her knuckles. “Weasley tried getting me out of the game. Gave him a nice black eye in return.”
Pansy simply rolls her eyes, as she tends to do rather than argue with Draco in the mornings. She knows there’s no point to it; it’s a futile effort. Blaise laughs as he leans in front of Draco to reach for the porridge, which Draco hands to him because he seems to be the only person not determined to irritate him this morning.
“Everyday,” he says, averting his gaze.
The lack of response from Blaise unnerves him, but he’s cut off from the thought when Pansy continues their conversation. “I still think you’re being foolish. This is so terribly Gryffindor of you, Draco. Who even are you? Soon you’ll be galavanting off riding Dragons and fighting dark lords with Potter and his pals.”
“You love me,” Pansy insists, rolling her eyes.
She squats beside Blaise, grinning like she successfully robbed Gringotts. “You’re too easy.”
“Don’t underestimate me, Malfoy. There’s more to me than you know,” Potter says, his low voice sending a shiver through Draco’s bones.
“Greg? What is it?” Draco asks.
As she walks through the corridors, she thinks back to the last few encounters Harry and Draco have had, the fiery tension so thick and tight between them like it’ll snap any second. If all goes according to plan, perhaps she’ll solve more than one problem.
Draco shakes his head fondly, unsurprised Theo managed to cast it so quickly. He’s always been one of those people who can somehow accomplish something on his first attempt. It was something Draco deeply envied about Theo back when they first met, feeling intimidated by how gifted he was. When Draco realized that Theo never sought any attention for his abilities, keeping them mostly to himself, he realized he was no threat. Draco approached him one day, offering his hand, and that was the start of their friendship.
This year though, he can hardly bear to meet his gaze as it sparks the familiar fear in his chest, freezing him to the spot. The sight sends him back to the burning room, Draco laying flat against Potter on the broom, clinging to him for dear life. It always takes him several moments to shake those thoughts away once they resurface.
” Reina chimes in, her eyes wide and hopeful.
“You think this is funny? This isn’t over!” Draco sneers, his face flushing a bright red.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco knows he won’t drop it if he refuses, “Fine,” he says, and they slip into silence.
Draco winces, knowing Finnigan has truly fucked himself, and turns to see Madam Pince striding over to him furiously. Students clear a path for her, pure terror across their faces, and she summons Finnigan’s weapon. Finnigan stops in his tracks, turning toward her, completely struck with terror.
“Draco, you have a free period after lunch right?” Theo asks, eyes piercing into him.
!” Granger hisses.
“But it was hilarious! You should have seen his face, he was about ready to soil his pants,” Blaise says, laughter bubbling out of him.
“You’re rather quick to assume that I’m planning an evil scheme again. How presumptuous of you, Potter.”
“Anyway,” she says, blatantly ignoring his question as she return to the sofa. “I don’t let anyone try to tell me I’m not worthy. I don’t need to use a wooden stick to gain respect from anyone. People fear me regardless, so it’s unnecessary. My fists are more than sufficient.”
“If I win, I want a favor,” Draco says. If he’s going to participate in something so absurd, he might as well get something out of it.
He takes a reluctant step inside, sending her a hopefully convincing smile as he passes her when she beckons him in. He goes straight for the chair he sat in last time and waits as she walks to her kitchenette, putting the kettle on. He can’t help but wonder why she doesn’t heat it with magic, but wisely chooses not to mention it.
Pansy opens her mouth to respond but is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Blaise, which startles her. Oddly, her cheeks flush, and she ducks her head slightly.
“See? Thank you Greg, you’re a true friend. Get off my bed you traitor,” He says, half heartedly shoving Pansy’s shoulder.
Theo’s face drops, and Draco feels a pang in his heart. “Why not?”
“Hey.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Draco says.
Draco turns toward her, taking in her pinched expression and rolls his eyes. “Yes mother.”
They wait as each student exits, ready for Smith’s appearance. Finally, Draco catches sight of him as he begins to descend the ladder.
“Pansy! You’re supposed to be on my side,” Draco gripes, feeling betrayed.
“They’re busy tossing the ball back and forth, but that’s beside the point!” Ginvera snarls, leaping off her broom. “They could have crashed into the stands, or even the Forbidden Forest! That was dangerous!”
“Of course, Granger, I don't doubt that in the least. I just thought I would offer a hand.”
“I’ll see you later, okay?” He says, trying to hide the zeal from his face.
“Why not? We can be rid of the judgement. Away from the blood traitors and—“
Draco ignores the quip and quickly finishes combing his hair in order to get away from him as soon as possible. He hears someone greet him—presumably Theo—as he walks out of the bathroom, the door swinging shut behind him. He doesn't bother turning around to return it though and acts as if he didn’t hear him.
That pulls Draco out of his revere, and he whips his head up. “What?”
Today was different though; He could feel her stare burning into him, but when he would glance up she would be reading her book once again, as if he had imagined it. It seemed like she was trying to solve him like a puzzle. But unfortunately for her, Draco is not a simple game of wizard’s chess.
Harry looks up from his food, suspicious. “No, why?”
“See this little orange lever here?” He points, looking up at Greg to see if he’s watching. At Greg’s slow nod he continues, “I have brilliantly discovered that if you pull back on it, it releases water. Don’t worry, you can do it too. Look, it’s like this,” He explains and aims at Pansy’s face, the water hitting her on her forehead.
Draco startles from his thoughts and drops his quill on the floor. Theo sets his bag down on the table and bends down to pick up the quill for him. When Draco accepts it with an eye roll, he sits himself across from Draco, staring at him inquisitively.
Her scowl breaks and abruptly, she embraces him, squeezing the breath from his lungs.
Draco doesn’t know what to say, and he is not in much of a mood to focus on Transfiguration anymore. He thinks quickly of what to do, how to fix this. He’s fucked up badly, he knows it. But he can’t stand the thought of Theo hating him. Draco’s breathing starts to become difficult, and he grips his hands tightly.
“Close your eyes, and breathe. Only focus on the sound of my voice,” Theo says, rubbing his thumbs into his shoulders. It’s utterly distracting, but Draco doesn’t say so.
?” He pushes.
Draco huffs a laugh, shaking his head. “That’s it? Really? Boost your ego so that it floods the entire castle? Stupid, Potter.”
“We never got the chance to play last year, so, let’s settle it.”
“Oh, it’s fine Draco, save your dramatics,” Blaise says airily. “I don’t need your attention anyway, I have many other admirers who fawn over me. And you have Pansy to give you attention.”
An owl swooped overhead, hooted at them, and flew on.

Harry caught Draco's eye from across the room. At least they
"Why is she asking you to go now?" Draco asked, looking deeply suspicious—like Lily was in grave danger and Harry was keeping it from him. "She's never asked you to go before. Did something happen?"
Malfoy was looking at Harry. Not like the cameras looked at him, not like strangers at Hogwarts saw the Saviour. Not like his acquaintances saw a classmate. Like he was looking right at
Harry tries to glare her into silence.

about it with him. And time was running out. He had to do it now. Before he and Draco did…what they were planning to do.
"Huh? Why?"
Draco sighed and pulled out a book he was reading, propping it on his knees.
but what came out was, "Yes, kind of." Draco's mouth dropped open, shocked at his own answer. "What? I mean—I thought—I thought I could convince you to agree. Because I knew you cared as much as I did about Rump getting elected. And I guess that's manipulation."
“I cannot fucking believe you lot got me
"There," Draco said, turning to the kids. "Happy?"
He could not
He turns toward me and grins. "I have a completely preposterous idea."
"Yes, but I might not answer." Draco attempted a smile.
"Well, you used to hate me."
He'd known that Rump would attack him, and therefore that he'd attack the DMLE, but this was so soon and so…indiscriminate. The entire department.
The midwife nodded and waved them inside.

that it eclipses what they want. You have nothing to worry about."
"What about Glamours?" Luna ventured, apropos of nothing. She was lying on her back on the floor, her stocking feet up on a sofa next to Dennis, who looked like he wasn't sure where to put his hands.
"How do you cope with that?"
But when people are depressed they tend to think their thoughts are like, absolute truth. But we can't really know what truth is, right? Anything could happen in the future, good things included."
"What do you get off on?" Malfoy asked, raising one blond eyebrow, his face amused and teasing.
Andromeda clatters around in the kitchen, looking through cupboards and jotting things down on a sheet of parchment. "I was hoping you'd be willing to sit with him for a bit while I run to the market?"
Malfoy sighs with some drama. "I suppose we can queue for Mortal Kombat."
Draco reaches around to pull Harry into a one-armed hug as Hermione consults the book to figure out how to stop the flames. She whispers an incantation and the flames stop, leaving the cauldron still and empty on the counter. It's shockingly dull and quiet in its wake.
"You're not an idiot," Malfoy said with a touch of “there, there” pomposity. "You're concerned about the world."
"You two are insufferable!" James shouted joyfully. "That was like watching one person reflected in a mirror!"
"But they—"
Harry fell asleep peacefully with Draco's arm thrown over his torso; they'd talk about it in the morning.
Wilhelm laughed with glee as the wooden platform he stood on rotated, bringing him inside his cottage. "I knew it!"
. It's—Ginny had an abortion. A couple months ago."
way home, as that took about an hour and the cold was already biting his nose, but neither did he want to Apparate directly home, foregoing the chance to clear the detritus of the day's work from his head. He Apparated to the southern border of Regent's Park, where he emerged from a quiet alley and ambled into the park.
I sink from my knees, landing on my arse. "Well, no. It's not an object that amplifies magic, like a wand. It's a conduit of actual magic. I think. But that does suggest that we can use it, if we knew how to get at it. If we could control it."
Potter uses a Sticking Charm to attach it to the ceiling. We need to hang it quite close to the wall, or it won't blend in. Which means there's not much space for us to squeeze behind it.
"Haven't forgotten," Draco said, slanting a glance at Jorgen, whom Harry just accidentally let in on their political aspirations. Harry winced, but Draco didn't seem bothered. "Let's go."
Has he? Does he know how to move on from all this nonsense? From the war, from his complicated, history-laden relationship with Ginny, from an aborted pregnancy? Not really. But does he know what to do next?
The Burrow looms. It can't actually have grown taller in the few weeks since he's been here, but it certainly
Harry shrugged, not wanting to talk about that part. The snake part was a good story, the rest of it was not. “Flamingoes,” he said, pointing, glad for a distraction.

"And maybe I was fooling myself," Draco said, words spilling out. "I don't know. I wasn't trying to take advantage. We weren't trying to hurt anyone. And—what difference does it make, really? As if
"Oh, right," Draco said. "That is the entire point, rather. I want to run for Minister in the next election."
Draco gave him a look. "Don't try your supportive-parent tactics on me. I'm not Lily. I actually want to know what you think."
"With you." Draco's cheeks flushed with heat. "I'm not supposed to admit that if you say someone else gave you a better blowjob! I need to think of someone else! There was a solicitor named Marcie I used to fuck who had a tongue ring. She could do more interesting things with her tongue than you."
? "We didn't even talk about it!"
"Alright. He's joking more, which is good, but sometimes I worry that he's forcing it so that we'll worry about him less. But he's, you know, eating and sleeping. I don't think anyone's found him passed out in vomit lately."
"Hi,” Harry said.
I study him, wondering if he's actually finding a way to be optimistic even though he's stuck with me in a fucking dungeon. But no—he still looks resigned. It's like he's asking out of duty, even though he knows it's futile.
"I can throw off Imperius," Harry said, like a complete wanker.
Draco lifted his head off the pillow to peer at Harry's face. "Are you saying that my blowjob skills are creative and energetic, but low in technical difficulty?"
to worry about any of that, because they'll do it for us."
Thanks to Corie for the zoo idea. 💞
"Good morning, Wren," Malfoy said, smiling in a way that struck Harry as arrogant. "The usual."
Thoughts of all those fun things he used to do is jarring—why had he stopped? He’d loved all those things. Well, he
A resonant dinging noise traveled through the room and Harry looked up to see Scorpius delightedly tapping a glass with a spoon. "Attention!" he called, and the small group quieted (with the exception of Teddy, who seemed to be in the middle of a hippogriff limerick). Albus joined, throwing his arm around Scorpius's shoulders.
okay," she says definitively. "Because you're moping around and you clearly miss her."
it? Like a wand?"
Draco, unfortunately, was still wearing the skirt. When Harry had suggested he change before the pub, Draco had fixed him with a challenging look and said, “I’m quite comfortable, Harry. Thanks ever so for your concern.”
Potter nods. "I'll Apparate us to Ron's brother's. You can leave after we get there, if you want."
"Mmmff," Draco mumbles. "For Harry never to move because he makes a good pillow."
"You are so fucking ridiculous," Draco drawled into his neck. "And yeah, I want to keep doing this."
Harry stood. “I can’t wait to get these shorts off. You cut them way too short.”
"What am I even doing, Dobby?" Harry whispered, but there was no answer except for the crash of the waves.
“Is that how you proposition all your men?”
"In any case, we've spent a lot of time together. And," Harry paused, exhaling. "It's hard for me to find people to date who understand my life."
“If it wasn’t fun?” Harry asked. When she nodded, he thought. “I guess not. But I’ve never been to a place like that before. It’s not comfortable, you know? And with Malfoy…”
Harry watched all this with interest rather than doing his work. Somehow, despite the years, Albus looking up to Draco as a father figure had never gotten less strange. Well, it didn't seem
Harry then promptly spit out the mouthful, spraying it everywhere. Green. Spraying green everywhere.

"Harry, go to sleep," Teddy said. "I love you."
"They'll probably think it's a prank," Harry agreed. "Worse comes to worst, we'll just have to snog a bit to show them we're serious."
"And do you think they can actually keep Dobby out? Keep him from coming back for me, I mean?" Potter looks guilty—like there's a war in him between wanting the elf to be able to rescue him and not wanting to put the elf in danger. I can't help but wonder if Potter would ask Dobby to save me, too, or if he'd leave me to my (admittedly well-deserved) fate.
Harry should buy Wilhelm a nice little wooden dog for his clock or something. Wilhelm's life couldn't be an easy one.
The house was so loud that Harry had cast a charm at his ears to lower the decibel level. He'd learned that charm when he and Ron went to a RATM concert in 1999, but here he was using it in his own home.
Draco’s eyes fly open; Harry chokes, coughing and grabbing at his throat.
Draco stiffened, then turned, outraged, hand on his hip. "Is that a criticism, Mr Floormat Father?" A long pause, then Draco snorted. "Honestly, that sounds a bit like 'Fleamont Potter'. I think we know where you got it from, now. Being a pushover is in your blood."
Harry let out a long sigh. "I hate that kind of shit."
"Yeah," Harry says, looking at the sleeping baby, "can we do it at yours, though?"
A moment later, a scuffle, and Draco kneeled behind him, leaning forward. "Are you okay? I
The waiter left, and Draco picked up the paused conversation. "How about we do a few things to cause speculation, but just a tiny seed of speculation, and
"James," they said in unison, looking at each other in surprise and laughing.
Harry shrugged. He had no opinion. “I think it’s your body.”
When he turned, Draco was gone, replaced by the man who had walked into the office a few minutes ago.
Of all the things—
Draco's heart beat erratically. "Please," he said, still exerting his death grip.
Harry frowned, wondering how Wilhelm knew anything about the state of the screws on his clock, but decided to drop it. He never understood how Wilhelm knew
At that, Draco snorted. "Indeed. Astoria did not love infancy. She much preferred spending time with Scorpius once he was older."
“Er, Kreacher, can you bring each of our bags back to our rooms?”
Harry's head spun as everyone attempted to talk over one another. Lavender was pulled away and he wandered towards Albus, who had slumped despondently onto the corner of a sofa by the window, and sat next to him. Harry and Albus could always be counted on to lapse into silence when confronted with nonsense.
Harry looked at Malfoy. “I suppose. I don’t want to drag anyone else down. I’m doing fine. I’ve got friends. I’m alive. It could be worse.”
"Sure, whatever."
“Can you come up with an alternative thought?” Malfoy asked, his face breaking into an amused smirk.
to hide those emotions.
Draco's eyes lit up. He set down the paper. "Oooh, is this where I finally learn about all the skeletons in your closet? All the misdeeds and fame-seeking?"
“Of course it is,” Draco said, sipping his wine. “The Evil Stepfather is the one with anger issues and a six-pack of beer.”
Harry's caught between relief that Malfoy's face lost that sex look and offence that Malfoy was able to lose that look so easily. What the hell is going on here? Does Malfoy think Harry is fit or not? Does he only think so when he's three sheets to the wind?
Draco's face split into a slow grin. "You just realised I'm right. I saw it in your face."
“Tell me your most pessimistic thoughts about me,” Harry said.
Hermione stood, wiping her eyes and turning around to look at the skeptical and still-angry younger generation. "Right," she said. "I think we'd better have a bit of a question-and-answer session here. Who has a question?"
“That’s it!” Robards shouted. “Granger, Malfoy, Weasley, Potter—my office. Now.”
Draco's hand stilled for a moment, then resumed.
Harry groans. "But what if I don't
“What would they say, do you think?” Harry asked.
They change their clothes, Hermione putting on a pair of low-rise jeans and a shirt that shows her navel, and Harry puts on a black dress shirt. He feels a little like a tool, but whatever.
“The charges against the accused are as follows,” a man in plum-coloured robes says, “treason, in that he did knowingly and willingly enter into Tom Riddle’s service.”
He turned, adjusting the belt on his dressing gown.
Harry only just refrained from rolling his eyes. He hated these hipster trends, and this coffee shop might turn out to be the worst of them all.
They watched as a girl balanced the tail of her board on the ledge, then reached her other foot out, leaned in, and slid down the ramp.
"Your parents were so excited for you to be born." Harry doesn't know what to say, he just knows that he wants Teddy to know how
? But not with Harry."
Turning back to the wardrobe, Draco sighed. “Jeans and a jumper? Tell me if I’m wrong. If I’ve learned one thing about Muggle life, it’s that jeans and a jumper will suffice for almost any occasion.”
Harry found that seeing Malfoy made him feel two things: a desire to make Malfoy as annoyed to see him as he was to see Malfoy, and a desire to act like a fourteen-year-old idiot. Unfortunately for Malfoy, these two feelings went together, so Harry reached into his Enlarged Auror pocket, rummaged around past the Shrunken file of paperwork, a Chocolate Frog, and a cursed set of teeth he had forgotten to turn in to Misuse, until he found the box of Tic Tacs. He poured a few of the orange candies into his left hand, selected one with his right, ate those remaining in his left hand, and threw the single Tic Tac at Malfoy's head.
"Scorpius called me in tears this morning," Draco said by way of greeting.
Malfoy, surprisingly, grinned. “I’m a Malfoy. What do you think? See you later, Potter.”
Harry took a deep breath and stared at the crowd of reporters standing in front of the War Memorial Fountain. He couldn't believe that the Wizengamot had decided they were allowed in the Atrium, as it was a public space.
"Nothing's wrong. Nothing at all. Every foreign-educated person in Magical Britain is in tears, or if they're not in tears, they're planning a protest. At best. I wouldn't blame them for rioting, really. In fact, maybe that's what we need—a good old fashioned revolution. Where's your milk?"
"What do you mean?" Draco asked, catching his breath, wishing he had a glass of water, mesmerised by the sight of Harry's body rising and falling with the force of his own breathing.
"Sycophancy," Draco supplied. "Alright. Do you want me to come?"
“Harry, do you have a problem?” Penelope asked.
Harry nudged Draco with his knee. "Assuming you want to, too. I've said that I want to a few times now, and you haven't, so like—"
“I’ve been to the Magical Menagerie,” Draco insisted defensively.
"Yeah!" Harry said, trying to reassure either Draco or himself not to worry. "Well, no. I mean, she's fine. But, she has a lot of pain, so it's not
Ginny tips her head towards him, as if trying to figure him out. "This isn't about whether
"Peggy is my mum's sister," Hermione explains. "She lives out in Cornwall."
"Will he kill you, too?" Potter asks, after a minute.
you are. I do yoga and speak four languages and have tons of money."
. "Also, deveining prawns. And washing lettuce."
“That sounds hard,” Harry managed. “Call me old-fashioned, but you might have an easier time going out places, joining clubs, and finding someone that way.”
"Yes, I know." Draco opened his eyes. "Not to mention what it means for the Muggle Mediation Measures."
His shirt read: DON’T TELL ME WHAT TO WEAR.
"Well," Hermione says, looking up from her computer, "we're really close to RAMag, so any of the clubs right around here are probably filled with other students. Classes start tomorrow, after all."
Draco’s hair was a mess, sticking up in the back, and if Harry wasn’t mistaken, thinning a bit. He looked every bit like the grumpy, entitled Malfoy heir he’d been at thirteen, only old.
"Whatever's bothering you, just fucking tell me."
with him."
"You two are serious about this?" Harry asks in bewilderment, as Hermione Levitates the coffee table to the side of the room.
Hermione smacks him.
"I'm outraged that they won't tell us the names they're considering," Draco said, spinning on the ball of his expensive shoe and beginning another lap of the tiny office. "I have so many ideas, and to be honest, I don't trust a Potter with this decision. I love your children, but their names are
Harry blinked, looked at Draco, blinked again. He dropped the bags he was carrying, then realised that wasn't right and bent to pick them up.
"Oh shut up," Harry gasped, trying to regain his breath. "You have to admit it's
Harry stares at her. "Oi! I can't believe this! You're supposed to be my best friend."
Harry leaned forward, looking around at the people in the restaurant, and whispered, "Were we having sex, I suppose it might be relevant? Maybe? If you want to make stereotyped jokes about being able to get into various sex positions? But we did not agree to
Harry laughed as they went through the double doors designed to keep the butterflies from escaping.
Teddy masticates Harry's finger. It feels strange—wet, concentrated pressure. He tries not to compare the sensation to anything he may have once experienced in the Great Lake.
Harry joined the queue and let the rich smell of coffee and the slightly bizarre atmosphere of the cafe wash over him. The music playing today sang, "I love coffee, I love tea, I love the java jive and it loves me." Wren stood at the counter taking the order of the person at the front of the queue.
Hermione looks at him in that way she has where he's 99% sure she's not performing Legilimency, but he's sure she's seeing his soul. After a moment, she nods.
Harry'd never been sure who the "us" in that sentence was, but he'd worn the cutoffs. (He'd had to Transfigure his boxers into briefs.)
Harry stares, but when her face increases in intensity, he nods.
Harry drops a spoon with a clatter, his heart pounding. The man stares at him from the screen.
Harry's falling face hit like a Cruciatus, but luckily Draco had a fair bit of experience there.
"I keep telling both of you," Harry says, "I'm not getting in the middle of it." He's happy his friends are finally together, he really is, but honestly. He can't deal with all that.
Draco tensed before he spoke. "I'll thank you to give me the benefit of the doubt, Scorpius. I'm well aware of the implications."
that?! It was only sex. Only, it was
Draco turned with a supremely unimpressed look. "Do not call me 'Poppop.'"
Harry shrugged.
Harry dropped the paper onto the desk. “What’s he going to say?”
not stop. But Malfoy only raises a challenging eyebrow and says, "
Sure, they had become friends—as the only two Hogwarts professors under the age of 84, that was only to be expected. Sure, they went flying together—as former team players, they would.
"We take a break," Draco sighed. He was sat close enough for his arm to rest warmly against Harry's. "Nothing we can do, just now."
Neither acknowledges that neither one of them has answered the question.
"Dads, take off your shoes."
"I can't believe you're leaving," Ron says for the twentieth time. "You don't have to leave just because you and Ginny had a fight."
Harry thinks maybe he and Ron didn't know what they were up against, partnering with Ginny and Hermione.
"I asked Al and he said no; he said he'll cook when he gets home."
Harry raised an eyebrow. "That's a no from me."
There's a silence for a moment before Draco says, "You realise there's nothing we can say about this without getting yelled at by feminists."
"He's here!" Lorraine called, bustling past them toward the Floo to greet their guest.
"I am telling you: this isn't your fault. We're playing this ridiculous game of politics—every action has downsides. Even if this did happen because Persephone is head of DMLE now—which we can't know—that doesn't mean that the benefits of your quitting don't outweigh it. You can't beat yourself up every time something bad happens. That way lies misery."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Get on with it."
"Potter," Draco said, "you're going to have to ask me."
"So what happened at work?" Harry asked, stretching his neck. "You seemed upset before, when you texted."
“I’m trying to figure out the best way to stop them,” Draco continued, ignoring Harry. “This goes way beyond nepotism. They’re using magical tax dollars to line their pockets. They’re standing in front of the nation, telling people to support specific companies. Anouska’s company is referenced in official materials! Rump owns a company that collected contributions from witches and wizards who want to stop the ‘threat of foreign magic’, but it looks like he and his advisers pocketed most of the money. This
He stares up at Ginny's ceiling. The plaster is cracked in places, and younger Ginny had used shimmering gold paint on the cracks. There are charmed stars up there too, but the spell is fading. The stars perpetually look like that moment right before sunrise, when you know the stars will be gone any minute, lost to the new day.
"You're such a piece of work," Harry sighs.
"Yeah, sure," Albus said, yawning.
“You’re so weak.”
"No!" Harry's eagerness actually makes him jump, heels coming clear off the pavement. "I didn't mean that. I mean, I want to. I just. Where should we go?" Harry grabs onto a nearby lamp post for stability.
I shrug, unrepentant. "Go ahead, tell me how I'm a terrible person for thinking your life matters more than a house-elf's.
“You didn’t answer my question.”
She nods, her game face on, as if mentally calculating how many drinks they'll each need, where to go, whether they have Hangover Potions.
"Potter," Malfoy drawls, eyebrow rising and mouth curling up. "Is
"Malfoy."
"You know how Twycross in Magical Games and Sports has been keeping a tally of how many days in a row Smoot wears the turquoise robes?"
Draco's face flamed with embarrassment. "I hate you."
“Why the fuck not?” Malfoy said, his posh accent striking Harry’s ears as sounding good when applied to unconcerned cursing. “The war is over, Potter. We don’t need to wallow in it forever. We can come up with careers that just ignore all that shit. Fuck politics.”
Harry wanted a mocha, because he loved putting syrups in his coffee, but he knew the sugar was bad for him and he knew Malfoy was standing behind him, about to judge his order. "A medium coffee to go, please."
It's strange doing magic without a wand, but Potter manages to Stun the rat, and I manage to Levitate the corpse closer to the chain.
Draco could not see Harry's face anymore because he'd stopped craning his neck, but Draco could well imagine his impish and self-satisfied grin. Draco scoffed. "We might be—" he paused for aural scare quote emphasis, "in love," he paused to slice the bread with a wave of his wand, "but I would
?" Harry asks indignantly.
James, unconcerned, waved a hand. "I have plenty of money." He held up a hand, cutting off Harry's interjection. "And don't worry, I still give ten percent to charity every year. You successfully hammered your ethical standards into me. I know I'm very privileged. I know. But still, I was a Quidditch star. I make so much money
Harry blinks. He can't believe she's going to, to—compartmentalise this. "I can cancel with the—"
Draco hummed thoughtfully. "Between us, we probably have enough kids—and, in your case, niblings—to talk about all the issues of the day only by discussing our personal lives."
Draco grinned, pressing his lips together to quell it as he pulled Harry's penis out of his pants. "It didn't require the last one to get you in bed last night."
Harry repeatedly tapped the button to take a photo. He wanted every moment of this documented. “Smile! Then I’ll get it off.”
"Maybe for you!" Harry leaned forward. "I can't think of a more unsexy setting than a Ministry party. Getting it up while the Minister and all of my Aurors are in the next room is my idea of a nightmare."
A few days later, after class, Harry opens the door, arms full of grocery bags, to find Draco and Hermione on the sofa watching MTV. Hermione is laughing, and she turns around and points a finger at Harry.
Harry's stomach drops to the vicinity of his feet.
"I should never have asked you to marry me." Harry's mouth opened, but Draco held up a hand. "Just let me get this out, alright? It was wrong. I asked you knowing you would feel obligated to say yes. I asked you knowing you are the type of person who does what is needed. Your whole life has been doing what is needed. Asking you, I was no better than Dumbledore. And I was able to overlook that, before, focusing on how bad Rump is and on the only thing I could think to fix it. But—I shouldn't have. I can't…I can't in good conscience allow it to continue."
Draco knew better than most that the "right decision" was often calibrated as though to tear one's heart in two. He remembered—in startling vividness—making wrong decisions
“I don’t want to do things,” Harry said.
with me right now,” Potter says, feigning offense.
"Fine, I'll do it myself." He turns away from me and puts his hand back on the wall. I watch as he closes his eyes. For a few seconds, nothing happens. Then he almost starts to sparkle a bit, so faintly that you wouldn't notice if you weren't paying attention. Then there's a glow. He's managed to call up his magic, which is impressive in itself, even if I'm not sure he'll be able to do anything with it. I sit up taller.
Harry holds his arm up awkwardly, wondering what Malfoy is doing, when Malfoy pulls his wand and sends a spell at Hermione. Harry has a moment of panic, but the spell seems just to tap her shoulder and she looks their way. She walks towards them, and Harry says, "I'll meet you at home, okay? I need to—Malfoy and I need to—talk."
“That’s a
Harry grinned. Magic was great. He still didn't take it for granted—not usually, anyway.
He's only joking around, but Hermione's face is serious and apologetic.
“Ugh, you’re right, I’m talking shite. I don’t regret the first go-round. I just didn’t enter it in a way that could’ve lasted long term.”
"I can't blame him." Harry reached for the water glass and took a long sip. "Did you remind him not to skip his meditation?"
"Oh, stop," Draco said, knocking his shoulder into Harry's. "He doesn't fancy me! He fancies
"I know. I told her we would do a traditional marriage vow in private, at some other time. Alright?"
"Well, it is!" Draco barked. "Sometimes, anyway. Sex magic is very real, although I can't say I've ever really looked into the peculiarities of the speciality."
He rolls his eyes, grabs my wrist, and tugs me closer. It's strange to be this close without punching him.
“Okay.”
It seemed, suddenly, a bit silly. Here they were discussing the need to abstain from sex to keep their cover, when their exact situation provided them with a person to have sex with. Just like Harry couldn't talk about their fake relationship with anyone else, but he could talk about it with Draco. Was it really any different?
Hermione extracted a hair tie from her pocket and pulled back her hair, a sure sign that she meant business.
Harry watched Albus with a burst of love and pride. Albus looked so like Harry's younger self, green eyes blazing with conviction and outrage, with the belief that things could change. Harry didn't look like that these days. When had Harry become so jaded? So…old? His first instinct upon hearing this social media plan was to dismiss it out of hand, but it was exactly the sort of thing he would've loved when he was young.
“Sorry,” he said, but that came out like a bite, too.
"You'll have to keep reading," Draco said.
"You were going to lie to me!" Draco gasped. "To assuage my bruised ego!"
Harry clutched his chest. "My baby is almost thirty! How can this be? However shall I—"
One Galleon for a
Then Malfoy smiled, and it was a real smile, lighting up his stupid, pointy face and making Harry's heart flutter. "It's been nice, talking to you. I'm sorry I performed Legilimency on you."
"Ran into Malfoy at Azure Cup—"
"I'm sorry," Draco says after a long moment. "You made him happy."
Harry feels like crap. He only just managed to stay awake in his classes. Terry Boot had to poke him a few times. Draco was there too, but of course it was the Ravenclaw who made sure everyone was paying attention. Harry was too tired to Apparate home, so he walked the few blocks and up the stairs to his flat, hoping the exercise would wake him up.
what you want.
Hermione and Draco turned to Harry, their eyes flicking to his Converse.
"Give it form?" Potter asks, spinning to look at me with too much intensity. (Not that I want him to look away.) "Like a Patronus?"
When Harry looked up, Draco was frowning at his eggs.
It was all an act. It was an act, and yet somehow it felt better than Harry's last few relationships. When he'd been forced to answer questions about past relationships, Harry always felt awkward and like he was somehow letting people down, or like his relationship was going to be judged lacking, or like people would think him pathetic and incapable of love.
"But right now, we need to exercise that imagination. Because we need something to aim for, don't we?"
"Is that how Albus decorates your place?" James asked. "He Pinterests 'goth decor'?"
Normally, Harry would hate being the centre of attention, but in this case, he was happy to distract Albus and Scorpius so the poor woman's cervix could dilate in peace. He launched into the whole story—how Parvati and Lavender had chosen the clothes, the argument that Draco and Lavender had got into about the cut of the trousers, his concern about cultural appropriation, and the scene he'd caused in the Atrium that morning.
wearing pants, Potter. Though I had to search for a pair of briefs in the back of the drawer.”
When Malfoy's story began to wind down, he gestured at Harry's lip. "You've got some whipped cream. Just there."
"Precisely." Draco paused. "We need to let those little hints slip even to our families, so they'll believe it too."
"Thanks, Al." Harry smiled, biting into the crumbly biscuit.
Malfoy seemed amused at Harry's reaction. He started to whistle with the air of a person who thought he was making a very good joke.
"No!" Harry said, sitting down on the floor and leaning against the Shield that was protecting their stuff from paint. "No one's stalking anyone! I don't think, anyway."
Harry nodded with a big smile, but then his mouth said, "No." He groaned. "Fucking Veritaserum!"
"Potter."
Harry leaned over to flick Draco’s shoulder. “Don’t laugh! He’s probably scarred!”
Harry looked a bit disappointed that Draco couldn't just say it, but complied. "How do you feel about us?"
"No." Hermione brushes her hair up and away from Harry's face. "You should tell him he can come over whenever. I don't mind."
"I'll just—" Harry said, pointing towards his office and walking away. By the time he closed his office door, the office gossip had reached a loud buzz.
"You went to keep Lily company when she was in pain the other day," Draco said.
The kids laughed, and in a moment, they all moved on, laughing at a story Teddy launched into about mispronouncing the word Cthulhu at a sci-fi meetup and the scorn he encountered therein. Harry, though, hadn't budged from his spot in the kitchen, and it took him a few minutes to get his brain back into Dad Mode.
"Uncle Harry's here!" Bill enthused, clapping Harry on the shoulder and doling out toast. Bill looked exhausted.
and mouthed, "Sorry!" He was going to have to have a talk with Draco about appropriate behavior where Wilhelm was concerned.
Draco was right, on some level—Harry knew that. This
Harry takes a breath and begins the process of answering questions slowly and deliberately, making sure to include every single thing that had ever happened in the last few years that made Harry think maybe, just maybe, Draco Malfoy wasn't a complete prick.
Harry waited for the door to close all the way and the wards to activate, then stepped into the Floo. There was a scuffle on the other end and Harry, confused, fell out of Draco's fireplace onto the floor in a tangle of limbs.
and thumping bangs sounded from the vestibule, and Harry and Draco both grabbed their wands and whirled towards the noise.
seemed to be scared shitless and drunk as fuck, judging by the mottled red blotches all over Draco's face and the wide saucers his grey eyes had become.
"No," Draco says, raising an eyebrow. "Like an inter
"How about this?" Harry said, clearing his throat. "Draco and I pretended to be in love because we thought it would be smart politically. Neither of us gave a crap about our own personal lives, so we didn't care whether we were throwing our personal lives away. We have no sense of self worth, so we were willing to shack up together and pretend to be in love despite the fact that we're not. All of this is true even though our children are married, and it was possible that we could hurt them in the process." He paused. "How was that? Did I forget anything?"
. They may need to run a special issue: Boy-Who-Lived Friend to Draco Malfoy. No, no, I should write to a random Hufflepuff from our year and just say something like, 'Oh my goodness,
Whatever Malfoy was drinking was leaving a faint green tinge on his lips, but Harry didn't dare bring up the contents of his cup again—not right now, anyway, while they were tentatively getting along, possibly for the first time ever.
There was a pause, and for the first time, Harry thought about last night. He'd wanted to wake up still tangled up with Draco. He'd wanted to start a mumbling discussion about their relationship in the half-awake haze of morning. This seemed more awkward, somehow, but needs must. "Draco, I—"
Draco's head drooped, falling heavily to the side of Harry's head and he let out a whining noise he would never admit to. "Good grief, Potter—can you just—take my money. Every Knut, I don't even care–and you know I fucking agree with you about the tax code and you're an infuriating—"
After, Harry lay panting on Draco's chest. His voice was soft, afterglow sweet. "Do you think we can do it all? Or will something have to give?"
Heart hammering in his chest, Harry turns and heads towards the exit, knowing that Malfoy is behind him. He wobbles to the left and wonders if his arse looks good. And where is Hermione? He can't leave without saying something to her.
“Me neither,” Harry agreed. “I don’t have a death wish.”
"Excellent!" Draco proclaimed, his hands and lips gone from Harry's face before he had even clocked what was happening, and Draco turned and was out the door. "See you tonight!"
. The problem was, Harry wasn't interested in Neville, or anyone else like him, and the people he found attractive and wanted to date were never the ones who could maybe actually fit into his life. Fit into his
what family means to him. You know better than to act this way."
For a long moment in the silence that followed, Draco’s face was completely blank, and Harry didn’t know what to do. Lucius Malfoy’s words, as always, were so offensive as to still—after all these years—shock Harry. He couldn’t even consider the absolutely delusional whitewashing of Malfoy family history because he was too concerned with how Draco would respond to the rest of it.
Someone in the office started snapping, but when Harry spun his head to see who, they’d stopped.
“It’s not an Age-Regressing Potion!” Harry says, and Merlin, even his
"That's the texture from the chia," Malfoy said, raising a hand to to rub his forehead. "Green chia kombucha."
Hermione's face turns sombre. "Honestly? I don't know. Is that horrible?"
"I have," Harry says, emphasising it in the hopes that Draco will hear.
You and I—
“It’s okay,” she said. “I’m just going to give you some space, okay?”
It's strange—Harry has never really been in an arcade, either. He remembers being made to stand outside one while the Dursleys went inside. He'd seen Dudley playing games at home on a series of consoles before he inevitably broke them, but Harry'd only been able to play Dudley's games the rare times he was alone.
as he shot cleaning spells at his windows.
Harry craned his neck to see what they were waiting for. His eyes just made out an inconspicuous sign that read "Azure Cup Coffee." Was this the queue for the coffee shop? Merlin! He'd never make it to work. But he'd come all this way…
"I—" Harry has to stop to gather himself; the situation is just too bizarre. "I don't have a favourite Backstreet Boy."
The queue advanced, and Harry was suddenly able to see a flash of white-blond hair in front of the witch with the pointy hat. Of course, he thought. He couldn't possibly get a coffee without the inconvenience of running into Malfoy. At least his suspicions about Malfoy’s mysterious “usual” had faded somewhat.
"That was
"You're so caught up in this narrative of being unwanted that you don't even realise that you've
Ginny laughed, tilting her head back. "Well, by the third…I'm pretty sure I knew more about birth than the mediwitch who was on that day."
“But we cannot let this stand!” Draco continued, stabbing his finger into the parchment. “Look at this! ‘
"He won't tell me what's in his drink," Harry said, holding up one finger. "Whatever it was turned his lips green. Two," he held up another finger, "he paid the bill only leaving a two Sickle tip on a ten Galleon bill. Three," another finger, "he left without saying goodbye."
Draco leaned close until their heads were almost touching. “I sent some magic up to disguise it. He won’t notice your room. Lorraine!”
Harry mentally replayed the conversation—trying to make sure he wasn't missing anything, any gaps in Draco's logic. "Have you talked about this with Hermione?"
Draco raised an eyebrow. "Well." He frowned. "For…what?"
The door doesn't open. I hear someone utter the incantation to turn a wall transparent. I close my eyes, hoping against hope that the Dark Lord lowers the wards, casts Incarcerous at the rats, and Potter gets us the fuck out of here.
." He stands and walks over to Wormtail, assessing the body. "How's your Transfiguration?"
"Shut up and listen," he demands.
He wakes to tears on his cheeks. He sits up, trying to calm his racing heart, trying to convince himself that the flames weren't real—that hadn't happened—his parents had died in a different, equally horrifying way. He rubs the heels of his hands over his eyes, takes a drink of water. Fuck.
It was Friday. The prospect of a weekend of James’s antics was a weighty one even for Harry, for whom James was his beloved first born and who had decades of practice dealing with James’s idiosyncrasies.
Potter blinks back at me, and I realise he almost definitely does not know.
to everyone.
to," Draco said, twirling his fingers around a clump of hair and
"What situation, exactly?" Harry asks, sipping his tea. "Sitting with me in a café? Or finding yourself stuck in uni with me?" He puts the mug down. "Or having a years-long enmity with a boy who you end up almost killing and kind-of saving, who then ends up beating you in a war, who testifies for you in a Wizengamot trial, who you have sex with, and then keep running into around London?"
Harry Potter, are or have ever been happy in that job."
"How's George?"
“Shut your pretty fucking arse mouth, Harry Potter.” Draco’s weary tone just made Harry laugh harder.
He wanted Draco to mean it.
Taking a moment to catch up, Harry blinked, then corrected, "Beast."
," Harry hissed, "needs to sort their priorities."
There was only one Draco Malfoy. Sure, fewer people liked or cared about him than Harry, and his opinion didn't carry as much weight. When people sought out Draco's opinion, they wanted his thoughts on law or policy (they didn't treat him as a barometer of moral and ethical rightness, the way they did Harry), and Draco always gave the same, measured answers, whether he was at a dinner party or arguing a case in the Wizengamot.
Malfoy leads Harry into the flat. It's nice—on the modern side, but nothing super fancy. He doesn't seem to have much stuff.
Harry and Draco had been hosting Friday night dinners with all the kids, including Nico, who was finally growing on Harry,— since Harry moved in. It was—nice. Nice to see everyone at once and to have a busy, bustling house. Nice to not be the only parent in a room full of adult children, a situation in which Harry never knew how to act. (Was he meant to join in their drinking games or excuse himself to the other room? Neither felt quite right, but without another adult around, there never seemed to be a perfect solution.) But now, if the kids wandered off to another room, huddled together over some web app or meme, Harry wasn't left alone. He and Draco could, like, retire to the parlour for cigars and brandy, leaving the kids to do their thing. Well, they
Back at the common room, everyone was wondering why Fred and George hadn’t tried entering their names. Sure, they were underage but due to the twins’ reputation, everyone assumed they were going to try to enter. The only questions were how and when. When questioned, the twins replied by saying they were only biding their time and that they had a plan that would surely work.
Dear mum,
Ginny woke up and realized she was still in the hallway she had ran away too. She neck was cramped and her back hurt from falling asleep against the wall. She groaned as she remembered the events that had taken place the day before. She wasn’t sure what she was going to do. On one hand she felt very, very, awkward around Luna and also wasn’t sure if she could be around her without freaking out. On the other hand, she adored spending time with Luna and if she was being honest... it felt nice to have a friend. Luna was a great friend. She was great at listening and was just overall a nice person to spend time with. Ginny wasn’t sure if she was ready to lose that. She ended up walking to her dorm and laying under her bead. She thought over all of the details and things she felt for a long time before coming to a decision. She realized a few things.
“Hey! Jeez calm down it’s just me,” the stranger said.
They paused, and looked at the many blushing faces in the classroom.
“Of course.” And walked to her classes.
Finally, Ginny started to talk.
After telling Harry about her idea, he agreed to help. It wasn’t too long before her outfit was complete. Now all she had to do was mentally prepare for the coming night.
“Bottoms up!” And the twins downed the potions. For a few moments, it looked as though nothing was going to happen. Then, Both twins had a shadow of stubble and a few aging lines.
She paid no attention to her roommates. The rooms were split into a room of three and a room of two. Ginny shared a room with two girls.
Ginny sighed in awe. She had the best walk. Is that a thing? Do people have different ways to walk? Do people notice the way I walk? She shrugged and pulled out her list of classes.
It caused the nose to stop spouting spiders but ones crawling on the floor remained. The prefect stopped to think and then cast,
Harry looked slightly confused.
“Wait, Ginny. You didn’t let me finish. I’d rather stay here, in the owlery... with you,” Luna said quietly.
They went over to the windowsill. It had a part that was jutting out as a seat. Ginny sat down on it and Luna sat next to her. Luna put her head in her lap and Ginny played with her hair. They talked about lots of things. School work, homework, Quidditch.
“Your dorm is beautiful,” said Ginny as she sat down.
“Yes, I’m here. Are you the secret admirer?”
She let out a small scream. “Get it off me!” She was close to tears by now.
“We’ve got to go. Now.”
But I didn’t.
Tell me if you want these letters to stop
Ginny screamed as Luna kicked her nose. She looked up to try and plead with Luna but saw her mum instead.
“I’m sorry... I-I- I can’t,” Ginny stuttered.
“Where?” All Ginny saw was the trees, the grass, and other normal outdoor things.
I look around a bit more and still can’t find him.
“Oh come on! It’ll work. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen?”
“You must be wondering where the new students will sit. Since this is not a permanent thing, you will not be sorted into houses. There are a few extra rooms I have prepared for you. That is where you will stay. Your headmasters have already heard the explanation and will be explaining the rest to you. As for my students, you will be continuing life as usual. However, there will be no quidditch.”
“Really.” Ginny gazed into her eyes. She suddenly felt an urge to kiss her. A mental image flashed in her brain. Ginny... kissing a girl. But not just any girl... Luna. No. It can’t be! I’m not... I can’t... it’s not.. no! Nononono! Ginny hopped off the windowsill and backed away.
“Engorgio,” she whispered.
“That’s Fleur Delacure. She’s part Veela which means anyone who has attraction to girls won’t be able to take their eyes off her. I guess that means all the guys will be ogling her all year while us girls stay normal,” said a Gryffindor girl with a laugh.
No, I haven’t gotten into any trouble. I do not think the boys have either. However, I received a love poem in the mail from an owl I didn’t recognize. Would you mind owling the boys to see if they sent it as a prank? As for quidditch tryouts, they haven’t been announce yet. I will make sure to owl you as soon as I find out. I hope I make the team! Your gift hasn’t come yet though I suppose that’s to be expected. School is going well. I met this girl named Luna and she seems very nice. She gets made fun of a lot so she understands how it feels to be bullied. I feel bad for her, she’s very... eccentric. People like to call her Loony as a nickname. I hope everything is going well at the burrow!
“Expelliarmus!” She yelled and pointed her wand.
“This.” She takes her hand and messes up my hair.
“What is it?”
The owl simply flew away. She didn’t recognize the owl at all. Perhaps it’s the gift mum was talking about? She opened the letter.
Chapter Fifteen
At the beginning it was a nightmare. He and Draco had bickered endlessly during every Potion’s class. During one unfortunate class Draco had become so exasperated he’d accidentally knocked over their potion. This resulted in a detention for both of them.
The amount of words for this chapter ended up being 666 which is kinda weird, don’t ya think? Anyway, yay for 40 kudos! Kudos and reviews mean the world to me and are always greatly appreciated!
Harry sighed.
Then he stood up and left the room, leaving a very bewildered Draco.

It read:
“And that play!”
Ginny walked through Hogsmead and marveled at all the stores. On her way to The Three Broomsticks she saw a number of cool shops. There was one called Honeydukes, which had glass windows in the front, showing off rows and rows of different candies. There were chocolate frogs, exploding pepper snaps, Bertie Botts every flavor beans, and lots of others. She also saw one called Zonko’s joke shop, which showed shelves full of pranks and other random stuff for mischief. Eventually, she came to The Three Broomsticks and opened the door. Luna was sitting at one of the tables, looking out the window. Ginny slid into the seat next to her and Luna gasped.
“I understand. It can be easy to get distracted by the things in life. I often find myself confused in conversation. I was asking if you wanted a copy of the quibbler? My dad writes it. This year he said I could help sell them. Would you like one?” The blond girl asked.
So I ended up pulling Harry aside and telling him right before it started. He kind of smirked, and then laughed a bit. I glared at him and asked him how it worked. I also asked him what lasers were.
“Bi, like bisexual?”
“Yeah, um… I guess… you’re, you’realsowhatismellintheamorentia.” Draco looked at his feet.
Ginny.
He pulls me up for a kiss. It’s long, and we kiss until we both run out of breath. Then, Harry pushes me away a bit, and points something at me.
“Yes you are. But I love you anyway.”
2. Thank you for the kudos! Your support is very appreciated.

Chapter 19
“That isn’t very good. I’m a fan of quidditch myself and I know you were looking forward to it. I’m sorry,” said Luna. She was standing next to the Gryffindor table.
“Thank you. What do you need to tell me? I swear, if you also have a secret gay relationship…”
“That would be great! Umm I’m pretty sure it’s almost two so I should probably get going. Where should we meet? My brother’s have told me all about Hogsmead so I know my way around pretty well.”
Ginny didn’t really have anywhere to be so she decided to go to her dorm. There wasn’t much else to do. When she entered the common room, Hermione immediately rushed up to her.
