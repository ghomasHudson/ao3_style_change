This was officially the longest staring contest I had ever been in. We were both extremely stubborn, there's no doubt about that.
He looked up and for the first time, I saw a truly unguarded expression on his face. He seemed so vulnerable writing about things he used to have to hide. I can't imagine how it would be to not even be able to think about Muggles. I was raised the complete opposite of Draco.
People looked over to us as we walked in. It must have seemed weird for us not to be yelling at one another. That's the thing with this whole predicament. It didn't make it into the papers. Ever since I had managed to shut up the Daily Prophet after the war, they didn't write as much petty gossip. I sometimes wish they had, it would be a lot easier than having to tell everybody. It did feel nice though to be in control of this personal side of me. I wondered if that's how Draco felt too?
Once were had made it out the door, he turned and signed, "We're going to hide away today. No sense worrying over something we can't help. I'll fake being sick, and you just get your little trio to cover for you. Simple and much less stress."
"What do you mean?" The air had deflated from my chest. I've always loved Ginny even if it wasn't the way she expected me to.
I wondered if Draco and I were friends now? I had fun last night just having somebody to talk to. He didn't look at me as the savior everyone else did. It was refreshing to have something not completely tarnished by the war. We could still be just as snarky with one another as always, even if it didn't have as much behind it. Would Draco want to be friends though?
Back in fifth year, Ron and I made a list. (What can I say, it was a boring year.) Recently, I've been thinking about it more often.
If I didn't know any better I might have said he asked just to make sure we really had broken up. I really was beating this thought into the ground, but I can't be the only one seeing this right?
Could this have something to do with Harry Potter speaking on Draco's behalf this summer? Will Harry come forward against these acts? Could this be all a distraction of something much more sinister?
His eyes were soft, but they held something behind them that I couldn't piece together. I hated not knowing his thought on this. "I agree. We shouldn't be forced to come out about this so soon. I also don't think we should be afraid of if. We need this to be natural, and if they aren't ready, things will only be worse."
After what could have been an eternity, my sense of time would forever be screwed up, he pulled away. We didn't move from the strange tangle we found ourselves in and just stated at each other.
We left the Hall and I took out my map. Ron gave me a strange look and I thought it best that now if he needed to ask a question I wouldn't be able to understand it.
A figure tapped my shoulder, I had grown so used to it that I didn't even jump this time. I turned to see Draco, pointy and pale, yet stunningly himself.
On the one hand, I had been dreaming of this moment since I was struck with that damn spell on the battlefield. On the other hand, Draco needed this much more than I did. At first, I couldn't figure out why, but then I realized the sheer privilege I have over him.
That seemed strange to point out. Draco had always been so awful to me, so I hadn't really noticed that he was worse now than after the war.
We walked down the side-streets, he was so caught up in the beauty of urban life that we didn't need to talk. Our silence said more than words ever could.
He seemed conflicted about what to say next. I didn't miss the brief hints of shock and relief in his face. I had felt the same when I found out about him. There is something about knowing you aren't lone that's strangely comforting. Eventually, he decided what to say.
"I mean you could always sign too-" She was taking too much time, so I grabbed her arms and ran back towards the dorm.
With a sigh, he moved over towards our bed.Â  He sat on the edge and clasped his hands together in his lap.
I needed something that could either calm him down or ground him. I carefully took his hand and brought it up to my heart.
Looking back on it, I should have realized signing up for this class was a bad idea. It started once we took our seats.
I apparently didn't look away fast enough because he was quickly on his feet and tugging his shirt down to cover the mark.
"Believe me so am I." I saw the three snakes up ahead, perched by the back entrance to town. I waved to them, only Draco waved back. "See," I chuckled nervously, "they're all fine."
"Are you sure about that? I remember someone who you wouldn't shut up about all sixth year while we were together. I bet you fancied him instead."
I reached towards him and held his hand. "I'll be here all night if you need. Just say the word, and I'll never leave."
He shook his head sleepily and pulled me down so his cheek was on my chest. I felt his legs entangle with mine, and in that second, I couldn't imagine how I had lived without this.
Draco was never there. He was in the background in the war, almost like he had disappeared, only to show up when we had forgotten his existence. He was hardly ever at the battle, there are no memories with him like the others. Years ago I would have said this made him a coward, but I am forever thankful that he wasn't there.
I inhaled the smoky scent once before running off to find somewhere to eat. Draco was hot on my heels, and I decided to make a competition out of it. He inched closer, but I knew I was faster. He may have had longer legs, but I had the advantage of years of running away from people.
I was slightly started when I looked over to see him already settled into the chair across from us. Is he really that fast?
He reached into his leather bag and brought out a short, thick blood-red book. On the front in stunning, monograms were the initials
Some looked away, either trying to make it look like they didn't care or that they were avoiding me. Others weren't even looking at me. They were looking at Draco.
she sent another one of those all-knowing looks that made me wonder how she truly did know so much about everything.
I sighed, hanging over the side of my bed upside down. I figured it was getting late and I'm not going to just avoid this. I cast a
"Are you mad? You pull me along only to leave me for a whole year and then announce you've gone off to kill yourself!? How dare you! Fred's gone and you decide now's the perfect time to leave. Did you ever care about me or was I just a distraction in sixth year?" She was getting progressively angrier and I was grateful nobody was around to hear us over the loud noise echoing in the Hall.
I needed some more time to myself, but how could I get it if I was being forced by the Headmistress to be "civil" towards him. Also, this agreement wasn't going to happen easily from what I could read on his face. I was hoping this situation would bring us a little closer, but if he's going to be difficult so can I.
"What did you need to ask?" We walked towards a small bookshop, I'll probably get Hermione's gift here.
I dragged my trunk over to the people loading the train and got on board. I wondered who else was coming back? That only made me think of Malfoy again. I really didn't want a repeat of the sixth year. I could only handle so much of an obsession. I walked down the aisle and noted the people in the compartments. Hufflepuffs normally sat towards the front, I assume it's to greet people when they come on. Then it's the Ravenclaws by the emergency exits, they do this so that they can tell people how to leave in case of problems. The Gryffindors sit next, not much reasoning there just kind of what was left. Then at the very back of the train was where the Slytherins were located, probably to isolate themselves from the other houses. I tried to find our normal compartment, but I ended up walking into snake territory.
I responded hastily. Quickly throwing my things into my bag, I waved to the teacher as Mr. A whispered something to her and she got the class's attention again.
Thanks again. It means a lot," he nodded in agreement and I threw the book onto my pillow. I headed down to the common room. I had
When I reached the door I found it was already open. I closed the door behind me and took in the familiar room. There were still portraits all over the room. Two of them I noticed immediately and it took all my willpower, not to breakdown.
It was halfway through October, and Hogsmede was just around the corner. People would normally be spreading these last days before the weekend to find a date or group to go with. I, on the other hand, was too scared to go to a library.
I was snapped out of my thoughts when a large barn owl came through the window. I found it easier to leave the window open because I couldn't hear when the owls wanted to get in. I could only hear very loud sounds and even those often came out as muffled. The owl stuck out its leg and I gave it a treat so it would calm down. I open the letter and it read:
His lips fit perfectly into mine and his breath was minty and cool which contrasted with the warmth of my own. He made me feel safe and calm like he was feeling the same way I was. It was extremely reassuring to not feel alone in this.
She always wanted to know everything, and I understood why. I just thought this would be better if kept wrapped up.
We walked for a while in silence. I found it extremely awkward, but if he did too he showed no signs of discomfort. He was still close and out shoulders brushed with every step. He continued to look forward, seemingly oblivious to my inner turmoil.
Adding in the fact he was a guy now, I found it didn't change my mind. I was made up, Draco had made me so happy when I thought that was impossible, why wouldn't I go along for the ride? I would have to tell him yes when we were out of this forest.
They were impossible to miss. The family consisted of a single mother with about five little kids tugging on the hem of her skirt, leaning against a wall, or just sitting next to her to keep warm.
We only had two classes a day with a lunch break in between. I'm pretty sure Hermione convinced McGonagall to let her take more, but I never asked.
"I can't say here, in case someone hears us," I had taken to talking to Hermione instead of signing because it was honestly just easier, even if it felt weird.
âYou mean to tell me, that you went to Hogsmeade without the cloak? You couldâve been killed or- or worse-â
His eyes travel down his chest and land on his tattoo, his beautful tattoo, the tattoo which writhes on his skin swirling in masses of orange and green around the centre of the design.  In the centre, which was shimmering starkly against his dark skin, was a dragon. A dragon with long limbs and sleek scales, a dragon with skin that seemed to cling to itâs frail bones, a dragon scattered with scars and a single evil blur on its arm. A dragon so marked and pitiful that it seemed to be the most pathetic looking thing on Potterâs skin. It seemed so pale and lifeless among the flames and flowers; it seemed to be leeching the life from everything around it.
Puzzled at the sudden strange behavior, Harry ponders if Malfoy is hiding something; he certainly seemed like it. But what could it be? Voldemort had been defeated, everything was calm, sure a few people picked on Draco, but it was nothing too serious.
Draco sighs, if there was one good thing about the soulmate tattoo, it had to be that it covered all his scars. Although, the replacement hadnât been much of an improvement.
He sighs and his head droops, as he shuffles dejectedly out of his shared room and down to the great hall for breakfast.
Draco leans back and props himself up using his hands and Harry slowly unbuttons his robes, then his shirt, a thick calming silence hanging in the air as a strange sort of anticipation washes over them both. He carefully undos each button slowly revealing more and more of the great tattoo writhing all over his chest and the great beast that acted as a center piece to it all. Harry finally has every button undone and very carefully he removes the shirt, sliding it over his shoulders and down his arms, his fingers barely brushing against his arms and sending localized bursts of colors everywhere, with everything, then nothingness.
As they read further Harry had discovered that the Tattoo would only keep growing in size and complexity until a counter spell was uttered by the original caster, of course the spell would only work if his soulmate kissed him to seal the âbondâ. Not only that, but it had the potential to make him go insane according to many accounts.
Harryâs fingers are hesitant and fleeting over every part of Dracoâs skin. His fingertips barely brushing over him like butterfly kisses, leaving trails of color in their wake, then behind that little patches of pale white skin, contrasting with Harryâs wandering hands. Draco looks up at Harryâs face as he traces the lines of his icy insides, he stares at the half of his face covered in color, the half with emerald vines twisting about, the half with swirling ruby flames. Every part of Harry was so lively, everything about him was alive, moving, breathing, living, growing. It was like looking into the eyes of a god; even his green irisâ seemed to swirl with color as they stared into Dracoâs own.
Draco frowns, âI read something similar to that, but it mentioned that it would only work for the tattoo problem,  not the other interesting side effects that go along with the spell.â
Harry, met with the sudden wave of heat, strips off his outer robes in favor of the t-shirt underneath and lays his outer robe in his chair. As he begins to prepare the other ingredients he notices Malfoy staring at him and glances at his bicep, wondering if the tattoo returned before sighing in relief.
He was beginning to convince himself it wasnât the soulmate spell and Potterâs lack of a tattoo was certain.
Draco slowly removes his robes, then his shirt, his touch leaving small bursts of red, orange, and green all over Harryâs skin. Draco traces his fingers over his ribs, down his sterum, then down to his naval, causing a shudder to run through Harryâs body as his fingertips barely skate over his toned midsection. The tattoos turn to color then nothing fading away until only his tan skin remains. As the tree at his center slowly fades Draco notices the mark that the killing curse left over his heart. This one in starburst shape spreading outwards towards the bottom of his ribcage. Draco traces the outline of it and watches the tattoos melt away. Draco watches as a dull, grey dragon slinks into veiw with even paler patches of skin criss-crossing over itâs flank.
Harry stares straight ahead and ignores him, releasing a few calming breaths and listening to the boring, consistant drone of Slughornâs voice as he praddles on about one of his favorite students from many years ago and how they cured some disease. Harry breathes out and smoothes down the wrinkled fabric of his robes, puposefully ignoring, Dracoâs sidelong stare.
Harry was not feeling so great by the time he made it to potions. It was after lunch and he had a pretty bad headache, which would only get worse when he had to deal with Malfoy.
When Draco woke, it felt as if a hazy fog was pressing at the edge of his mind. This fog seemed to be completely independent from the rest of his mind and separate in both behavior and ideas, but it was comforting. He lazed in the comforting feeling at the edge of his consciousness and slowly became more and more aware of his surroundings.
That handsome, lovely, intelligent, git knew what he was doing to Harry and it just wasnât fair. Harry looks down at his quiddich magazine with a blush heating his face and out of the corner of his vision he sees Draco smiling to himself and he loses it.
Lazily sprawled along the length of his collar bones was a very messy looking black lion, with what appeared to be streams of water and storm clouds surrounding it. This had been rather terrifying, so Draco naturally panicked thinking that someone obviously cursed of hexed him. He had casted Finite which did nothing, so moved on to trying to cover it up with a glamour, which in retrospect had not been a great idea. The glamour simply seemed to awaken the tattoo lion, causing it to open itâs emerald eyes and playfully claw its way down his chest leaving a trail of running water and storms in itâs wake before going back to âsleepâ.  This theoretically wouldnât have been a problem if the tattoo hadnât insisted on expanding over his skin as he slept. When he had been shocked awake by yet another nightmare, he took the time to look at how it seemed to expand over his skin. Now a band of tattoos wrapped around his shoulders and a little under his neck, that constantly moved and writhed all over his skin. In the thick of it all was the lion, snoozing away as water brimmed over his collarbones and storms pressed at his ribs. It really couldnât have gotten worse, but he was wrong.
He stares at the shower rack in front of him and jumps when he hears muffled banging on the door and the irritated voice of Malfoy, âHurry up and stop playing with your prick! I need to take a shower before tomorrow Potter!â
Potter. If only Potter knew how much he hated the marks marring his body. Of course the golden boy wouldnât understand, his scars were all greatly appreciated by the entirety of the wizarding community. He had nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to hide.
Harry doesnât stop gaping until Draco says something about it, âHonestly Potter, thereâs no need to be gaping like a fish at me and for fucks sakeâ¦ Also, where did you hide the quilt that was here and why is there no fire? Itâs freezing!â
Without seeing her reaction Draco ran off back to his shared dorm, finding it oddly convient that McGonagall just happened to room them together, perhaps Granger had some involvement in that too. Scowling, Draco opens the door to find Harry sitting on the couch in front of the small hearth with a magazine of some sort in his hand, no doubt reading about himself. Harry didnât even look up from his reading, until Draco shut the door behind him and he jumps with surprise.
Malfoy returned to his book glancing up at Harry as he crossed the common room to go to the library.
Draco sighed deeply and hunched over under the spray of the shower and shivered; Harry had definitely been making fun of him earlier, mocking him. Then the git had the nerve to come back and pity him, Draco had almost fell for it too. He had stood, his back against the door, listening to his every word, hearing his unsteady breathing, but at the last moment he reined in his emotions and turned on the water, hoping to drive him away or at the very least block him out with the noise until class started.
Draco! Will you bee my boyfriend?" The world tumbled out of my mouth faster than I could comprehend them. I said it, and I knew for sure I would never regret it.
I threw down the paper and rubbed my hands in my hair. I was livid. Draco saw my expression and ripped up the paper before spelling it away. He took hold of my hands, rubbing the knuckles gently.
OK, so we didn't break up. (Not officially anyways) We did, however, go one WHOLE week without talking to each other. (It was a lot to us at the time) It would have gone longer, had someone not intervened. Back then I was furious, but now, I will make sure to thank them again.
"I have absolutely no idea...," he stared into my eyes intensely. "Tell you what, go to Hogsmede with me? We'll go with our friends and everyone will think it's just because they wanted to hang out or-or that we were wanted to get out of the castle or something. That way it won't be a big deal...," he trailed off.
When I found him, he was sitting behind a column in a dim hallway. He looked almost scared with his hair blocking his eyes and arms around his knees. Slowly, I walked towards him.
I didn't sit by Draco at lunch, but part of me wished I had. Nobody except Hermione could really hold a conversation with me. That isn't their fault, if anything it's mine for not being able to read lips. I've had too many people in life go out of their way to please me so I was glad to have this ounce of normalcy.
"It doesn't matter if you hate me or not, it doesn't change the fact I didn't want to tell you about it."
Draco stuck his arm out and pushed my chest back. I looked over, he seemed terrified. He shook his head and mouthed,
I backed away fast like I had been burned. I ran over to Draco and grabbed his forearm. He looked confused and upset at being taken from his discovery but didn't question it. I ran faster than I would have thought possible.
And so, it began. We found ourselves nestled between two other people working the canned food station. We would box up ten cans per person and then would hand them off to the families that wanted them. It was hours of work, and since our hands were occupied the night was spent in silence.
He plopped a large book onto the desk and muttered something. It flipped open to a section that had medical reference books listed.
It wasn't totally a lie, but I didn't have the heart to share something so personal when it wasn't my place.
I couldn't help but notice things about him. He looked sickly in the light. I hadn't noticed it last night. The bags under his eyes were probably darker than mine in fifth year and he looked exceptionally bony. His skin was paler than normal, something I would have thought impossible. All in all, he was obviously not ok.
He wasn't wrong, but then again it didn't matter. I just wanted to go to the library. (For the fifth time that week) What was the harm in that?
Out of his pocket, he procured the small vial of glowing, Colbolt liquid. I watched as the magic swirled within the glass, it amazed me. I handed it to Draco, he too seemed intoxicated.
I sigh leaning my head back. I'm not as good at signing as I am reading it so it was fairly easy for me to understand what she said. Ron didn't even bother, but he already knew what happened so I didn't really care. I'm pretty positive that if he knew what really went down that day, saw what she said, what she had done, he would be more on my side. I couldn't tell anybody though because I knew she would just tell everyone the real reason we broke up and I wouldn't be able to handle that. I trusted her, that was going to be my biggest mistake if I wasn't careful. I closed my eyes so they couldn't talk to me even if they wanted to, which they probably didn't.
All other remains of the previous headmasters had been removed and the room was fairly empty. I noticed a desk and two chairs in front of it. In one chair sat Malfoy, his head resting on his arm as he waited. I sat next to him, across from McGonagall and a man I had never met.
had been checked out. I sat down and leaned against the shelves. We had been searching for over an hour and came out completely empty-handed.
Thinking like this always made my head hurt. Recently, it had been happening a lot more often because I didn't have anything to occupy my time with. The last question though was one that seemed to come up more than the others. I tried coming up with every single malicious reasoning I could and none of them fit. I doubt he was trying to kill me, he had made it very apparent he was no killer. I certainly don't think he was excited to see I was alive. I thought he would have been happy to see me gone as long as it wasn't on his conscience. Maybe it was out of shock? The best answer was it was a way of finally showing people he wasn't on Voldemort's side.
The man was taller than I was, probably not quite up to Malfoy. He had sandy grey hair and extremely dark eyes. After the war, I knew to grow wary of everyone, but I had no reason to be with him. I would have known if he was a Death Eater because I had been forced to go to almost every trial that was held, including Malfoy's. He could be one of the ones that have yet to be caught, but polyjuice and glamors were very risky after what happened in fourth year. I decided he would be fine for now. Innocent until proven guilty.
The floating hand must have noticed I was looking and suddenly it was gone. I stared where it was. It looked just like my hand had back in first year under the invisibility cloak.
Draco motioned the same sign back to her and she wrapped her arms around his knees. As she skipped away, Draco turned towards me. "
"I don't know. I've never really liked girls that much and it was only a matter of time before someone noticed."
Something stirred beside me, and I looked down to see Draco's eyes flutter open. His cheeks flushed, and in an instant, he was sitting straight upright. He coughed, looked at me sideways, and then quickly averted his gaze.
Nothing, that is until I awoke to a paper being thrown at me. For the first time, it was Draco who woke me up.
As I bit into a small chocolate bar, I looked towards Draco again. His face was flushed and his eyes were wide again. They had these pale blue sparkles in them when the light caught just right. He was breathtaking, I never wanted to let it go.
fast. I put my head down on the table and sighed. This was not the day I thought I would have. Classes started tomorrow, meaning Hermione wouldn't be as much help even if she said otherwise. Ron had proven to be pissed with me and unless I tell him the real reason Ginny and I broke up it would probably stay that way. There was no one else I could go to, so I guess it was up to me to find this cure.
We packed boxes up until our legs felt sore, and our hands were blistered. It was almost closing time, and the family from earlier was still sitting by the radiator and playing with the other kids from the centre. It wasn't until I saw one of them coming our way, that I noticed there were only four of them left.
"I just said, I never said I was. While we're on the topic, who was it you actually cheated on me with?"
The walk back to our dorms was silent and tense. Silent because we couldn't hear, and tense because we had to agree on something. I'm not sure there is much in life I've siding with Draco Malfoy on, but then again I never really knew him. He has changed and it's easy to tell. I feel he doesn't want to admit it though. That's why Pansy was hesitant to explain.
"So," I mouthed since he was close enough to see even in the dim torchlight, "what was your plan. I still don't know quite why we're here."
"Actually, I talked to them on the train before school started." They both looked at me skeptically, "What? I walked into the wrong compartment and bam! They knew sign language, of course, I had some questions."
After my fight with Ron, I've been trying to keep things with Draco very quiet. I don't even want him to know let alone anyone else. Dean recommended I told "mystery man" sooner rather than later, but part of that may have been he just wanted me to stop coming to him for help.
I entered the Hall and was hit with the severity of what was going on. I would never forget this. My life was short, Trelawney had always said so, but it wasn't 'til now that it sunk in. I was going to die. My only thought was I have to tell Ginny before it's too late.
I reached my hand across the table. He looked at it skeptically and hesitantly reached his hand out.
He looked a little sleepy and his head drooped a little. Out of shock I grabbed his chin and forced it up, I didn't let go. "Uh, s-sorry about that I-," I cut myself off. He glanced down at my lips, probably to see what I was saying, but we were very close so it felt different. "I didn't say anything."
I entered the crowded bar and walked over to the only booth that was empty. The seat had an obvious sheen around it, the person sitting there was concealed by an invisibility charm. Madam Rosmerta had always said she owed me a favour, I disagree with this statement, but we thought this would be a good trade.
My whole life I had never been a huge fan of change. Draco seemed like a part of that routine I couldn't get rid of, no matter what.
There was a simple charm that George showed him that made it look like his hands were covered in burns, meant for simple pranking or skipping class, but it should be able to cover up the tattoo or at least give him an excuse to cover his hands in bandages. Harry had tried to use a disillusionment charm before, and it had done nothing, but this technically was not a variation of a disillusionment charm so it may work.
Malfoy notices Harryâs meandering gaze and self-consciously smooths his hair down then sneers, âWhat are you still doing here, Potter? Trying to figure out how to tame that birdâs nest of yours?â
And as unsettling as a giant tattoo appearing out of nowhere seemed, it was a hundred times worse when apparently the same thing happened to someone else, someone else that just happened to be Harry Fucking Potter.
After three ungodly hours in the library Hermione, Ron, and himself determined that Harry was affected by one of three spells, one of which theyâd found in a book from the restricted section with the aide of Harryâs cloak. Either a spell that animates a regular tattoo, a torture spell that caused a tattoo version of an animal to ravage itâs victim, or a spell used to reveal a âsoulmateâ. Considering the first two options were obviously impossible and the circumstance in which he had been cursed, it was definitely the soulmate spell, which was also dark magic.
Ahhh, I apologize for taking so long and for the fact that this is so short and also because this may have errors, enjoy!
Ice was running through his veins, his skin was covered in thunderclouds, streaks of lightening, worst of all was the misshapen mass of ice on his chest so life-like that it looked as if he was melting from the inside out, his frozen heart hanging alone in his empty frame. He tried to process what he was seeing, his heart beating too fast, his breaths coming in short gasps, his hands turning ice cold. Then a shard of something  had stabbed outward from his chest It was joltingly cold, clear as crystal and when Draco barely slid his fingers on the shards sticking out from his chest he knew immediately what it was.
Draco gestures to Harryâs arm and he looks down to see a very thin trail flames flickering down his bicep, moving with the same rhythm as before when they roiled and writhed like a giant serpent. Harry looked away from the tattoo, cursing himself that someone saw it, even if they didnât know what it was, and cursing the fact that it was Malfoy. The one person who would gladly sell his every secret to the media just for kicks, but Malfoy doesnât seem malicious, merely curious.
Harryâs first class that day was charms, a class that he shared with Draco. Harry had been worried when he didnât see Draco come into the great hall and Hermione, Ron, and even Ginny seemed to notice that something was off, pestering him endlessly. Well not Hermione. Hermione just stared at Harry from time to time with a slight frown upon her brow before giving the wall in front of her a disdainful look. Ron asked him a few times what was wrong, but quickly became distracted with the mention of Quiddich and bagan animatedly talking about the Chudley Cannons. Ginny however, the most concerning, responded to his mood in a completely different way, that struck a little to close to home by teasing him about Draco, but oddly enough was silenced by Hermione with a stern glare. Ginny had just barely shrugged and started talking about her experience of hunting Nargles with Luna instead.
Hermione just nods, âHarry pull your shirt up. It couldâve just been a weak stinging hex, but thereâs no way to be sure.â
Harry flopped down on his bed and let out a puff of air, running his hand through his wet hair. Showering had given Harry time to think, but it did little to help the jumbled mess of ideas in his head.
Last night he found a book about soulmate spells in the eighth year common room, most likely left there by Hermione, and had begun to read about certain effects the spell had. His persistent headache, which Madam Pomfrey couldnât help, was just the beginning of it all, the tip of the iceberg, so to speak.
On his way to the potions cabinet a large bang shakes the classroom, making his dissipating headache return to its previous severity. Harry winces then twists around to see the stunned, soot covered faces of Neville and Goyle blinking in surprise at their cauldron. He sighs and shoots a sympathetic look at Neville who is already being assaulted with barbed comments from Goyle who was most likely the cause of their massive fuck up although, judging by the guilty look on Nevilleâs face, it was possible he was the culprit. Neville wasnât all that bad at potions anymore, but still wasnât very good and when paired with Goyle, who was absolutely wretched at it, so they often had the most spectacularly terrible fuck ups.
Draco half-heartedly scowls, but he doesnât feel the same way about him anymore. Before, he had been so easy to hate, being so perfect at everything, having everything, and all that rot, but now? Draco didnât know what to think, he wasnât cold hearted as he once thought. Harry had pleaded on his and his motherâs behalf much to everyoneâs surprise, Dracoâs especially, and after revaluating his entire standpoint on him, he didnât seem so hate-able anymore. After looking at him from a new perspective he seemed kind, caring, and like a warm, heartfelt person. He wanted to hate him for how damned likable he was, but couldnât. His glittering eyes, the messy hair, the kindly smile all of it looked different, it felt like he was just seeing him again for the first time, like he still had a chance at being Potterâs friend, maybe more.
She just smirks at his expression and continues, âDonât worry, Iâm sure he doesnât know, although he probably suspects itâs you. I mean he may be completely oblivious to everything around him, but Iâm sure that he must see the symbolism of a silver, grey eyed dragon on his back.â
Draco sneers and puts his wand away as his eyes move to Harryâs arm, âWell Iâm not your babysitter. Whatâs that?â
As the lesson finally came to a screetching halt after another half an hour of a tedious lecture Draco began to quickly pack away and head for the door, but before he could exit he was cornered by Granger.
And he was so easy to read! He had absolutely no tact or subtlety about anything, whether it be talking to Draco or sneaking âcovertâ glances at him in class. Right at the moment Harry turns around slightly and glances at him out of the corner of his eye; the stupid tactless idiot looking at him with so much concern and caring and-
Draco was going mad. Harry Potter, his soulmate? Ha, no. But, Draco was going to expose him at some point, right after he figured out how to glamour his own tattoo. Then the idiot couldnât hide from him.
Granger just smirks, âDonât play dumb Draco, you canât fool me. Iâve suspected you since the first day when he showed us the tattoo. But now Iâm certain, with the way you and Harry have been acting, your stupid gloves, Harryâs fake burns, the other ridiculous clothes your wearing. Itâs obvious if youâre really looking for it.â
Harry takes the bait and a competative smirk appears on his face, âOh yeah? I bet youâre secretly boiling, over there.â He says, and without warning lunges across the couch and grabs Dracoâs hand.
Draco, already suspecting this, weakly mutters in a slighty sarcastic tone, âI donât know what your talking about.â
Stifling a yelp of surprise, Dracoâs eyes widen as a jolt of magic crackles between them and as Harryâs warm, but not sticky hand, envelopes his cold thin, gloved one. Draco doesnât even have to be looking at his tattoos to know that theyâre writhing all over his skin in a kaliedescope of colors. He stares into Harryâs eyes for a moment, not wanting to remove the warmth of his hand from his own, not wanting to break the fragileness of this moment, the moment in which he realized he didnât have a chance, he never did. Draco was going to fall for him and hard.
Harry stands up abrubtly capturing his two friendâs attention, âRon, Hermione, I uh, just remebered I had some homework I needed to catch up on, soâ¦â
It had taken him two hours to work up enough courage to admit what happened and he was regretting it. He winced as Hermione told him off, but then again, he deserved it. Ron spared him a sympathetic glance as he dealt with Hermioneâs wrath.
A little smile grows on his face as he steps into the spray of lukewarm water of the shower. Draco, wonât know what hit him.
Draco wraps his cloak around him tighter and clasps his gloved hands together before casting another useless warming charm.
Harry stares at him as he leaves, wondering why he was being even more of a git than usual, but dismisses it as nothing. Harry shakes his head and quickly rushes into the showers then hitches up the back of his shirt and a lump forms in his throat as he looks at his back in shock.
His smirk grows when he hears Draco pounding on the door for him to, âGet out of the shower and stop wanking!â
Harry lets out a sigh of relief before walking back up to the castle, his lower back still aching a little.
He frowns to himself as Granger elbows Harry and whispers something in his ear that makes him flush even deeper than before and start looking at his shoes like theyâre the most interesting things in the world.
Draco couldâve seen his tattoo, oh god. Harry was bolt upright now with his wand in hand staring at the exposed skin beneath his sleaves.
He wrenched his shirt back down as a disheveled Draco burst into the bathroom, without his scarf this time, and he notice the edge of something peeking just above his high shirt collar resembling a black tail that looked suspiciously like a tattoo. Harry frowned, when did Malfoy get a tattoo? His eyes flit to the other boyâs hair, not used to seeing it so messy as it usually was styled to perfection. Harry liked Malfoyâs hair, it looked soft and he wanted to touch it and mess it up even more.
Just then Harry sees Draco barely glance up from his book and then back down and then he bites his lip.
Draco arches an eyebrow and grumbles, âYeah, maybe if it froze over, besides I think its just you. I can practically feel the waves of heat coming off of you.â
Harry whirled around, wand in hand, to face a dead-eyed Malfoy with two suitcases bobbing in the air behind him. Feeling foolish, he lowered his wand, âShe roomed you with me?â
He barely hears the little sound that Draco makes, and reaches out to gently cup Dracoâs cheek in his hand, fascinated with the way the tattoos burst into color and then dissapate into nothingness before his very eyes. He carefully runs his hand down Dracoâs jaw, under his chin, barely brushing the bottom of his lips with his thumb. He watches the storms, the water, the tattoo turn to color then fade to nothing, but before he can continue Dracoâs eyes snap open.
Overnight, his tattoo had taken over the entirety of his back and begun to lace over his ribcage and down his hips, but had completely shied away from his arms and neck. Not even a single tattoo-leaf had remained on his arms and as he slept the dragon had moved down to the small of his back, right above his arse.
Harry feels his blood run cold and dread begin to weigh at him. The haze of thought seems smug and Harry grits out, âWell, Malfoy, you sure do know a lot about magical tattoos, considering all of your experience.â Harry pointedly glares at Malfoyâs forearm and then back into his eyes.
Draco can feel Harryâs embarrassment and smirks at him from across the room when he turns around again. This just makes Harry even more flustered and he whips back around to face the front of the room. Ah, so easy to rile Potter up, whether it be by making him angry or flustered.
Harry just couldnât tear his eyes away from Draco. Draco and his stupid perfect hair, his elegant hands and fingers, and his stupid little half smirk that seems to constantly be stuck to his face. That haughty little smirk that seemed to be angry, nervous, calm, and amused all at once.
I also had decided to leave Mr. A alone for the time being. I was really enjoying talking to Draco and searching the library for just one other book we could use that I didn't want to ruin that. He also had given me no further reasons so be worried, so I'll just let him give the books up on his own time.
I brought my four fingers up to my chin and moved them away from myself. The little girl turned to Draco and put her tiny fingers to her chin and extended them towards him. I think I saw a tear threaten Draco's cheek.
I walked down the full shelves to the back where we normally sat. The moonlight was filtering through the thin, silk curtains on the windows causing a glow around the room. I saw the warm tint fade into view and I knew Draco had beat me here. He did love the library.
I was absolutely over-the-moon about last night. Nothing could change the fluttering feeling in my stomach on the walk back to the dorms and my smile as I fell asleep.
I hadn't realized how late it was. It was around midnight by my watch's time. I was out past curfew, again.
she signed. I was shocked that she knew sign. Her question wasn't offensive. It wasn't super common in the muggle world let alone the wizarding world. Why would she have bothered to learn?
With a large heave, I managed to pull myself away from the comfort of my own bed. The only relief I could find was the fact that even though I was going to see Draco, didn't mean I was going to tell him.
I looked out the window and fell asleep with the very low rumble to the train below me. Soon we would be back at Hogwarts.
I accepted and quickly, as he had done earlier, retracted it. I felt vulnerable now. It had felt good to finally tell someone what had happened between me and Ginny, but I wasn't sure if Draco was the person I should have told first. Either way, I don't think it mattered much in the end.
Draco came stumbling into the noisy bustle of activity and had a slight scowl on his face after tripping over a House Elf. We locked eyes, and his face softened greatly.
After his trial, it was not surprising that his father was put in Azkaban and his mother on house arrest. Narcissa hadn't actually taken the mark and saved my life in many ways. She is currently on house arrest, but rumors of her going insane have started to spread so I wouldn't count her lucky.
That's how I found myself desperately roaming the perimeter of the Black Lake, a map in one hand and my gift in the other. I was glad I had gotten him something small, my arm was already growing tired.
I get that it was kind of required, but charms? Surely he had something better than that up his sleeve.
I really couldn't understand why he was giving this to me. Shouldn't these things be kept private? Then, my mind wandered to my thoughts just a few hours ago and I had to shake them away.
I opened my arms towards him, waving his body forward. He seemed so unsure of himself in that moment, but his pride lost his inner battle. He crashed onto me, wrapping his arms around my neck so tight I could hardly breathe. If there was any way to die, this wouldn't be so bad.
I wish I could have heard his footsteps, then it would have been a thousand times easier to find him. I wasn't particularly worried about him having the book. Perhaps he would just let me borrow it, or maybe he knew where the other ones were?
I turned onto my side when all of a sudden a hand slipped through the curtains. Inbetween the slim fingers, rested a folded piece of parchment. I was puzzled, of course, I knew the hand belonged to Draco, but why is he slipping me a note this late at night. Carefully I read it.
I didn't want to pity him because I couldn't stand being pitied myself. I could however sympathize. I knew firsthand what it was like to be pushed into something you're not, something bigger than you are. I understand how taxing that can be on your body and mind, how it changes you as a person. I know the feeling of the rumors and remarks behind your back. More than anything I knew what it was like to grow up with a sad excuse of a family. I too felt outcasted by my own flesh and blood.
I dismissed the conversation because I zoned out. (Like I had been doing in classes) Draco had just come into the common room.
I rolled my eyes at his cockiness. Some things never change, though now I had a hard time finding it as a bad thing.
It was a little before midnight. The library windows were dark and our small torchlight casted a warm hue across the shelves.
I knew he was talking about the liquid I held tightly in my fist, but as the doors shut behind him, I couldn't help but think that wasn't what he was talking about at all.
And then, we were alone again. Normally I hate other people dictating my life without me, but I wish nothing more than for someone else to make this decision instead.
We stopped at a park, much farther away than intended. Resting my hands on my knees panting I watched as Draco strolled past and touched one of the gates.
His eyes trembled slightly and were glossed over with emotion. I knew he was almost over the mental wall of panic.
We met up again around mid-afternoon. Draco didn't buy anything, but I guess I technically didn't either.
My face heated a little so I quickly went back my own shelf about cooking herbs. When I was sure he wasn't pining me with his eyes anymore I chanced another glance over.
"Are you saying that I've been dating a Homosexual for the past two years?" she retorted, getting louder.
Hermione on the other hand had a bit more difficult time. Apparently, she had something to ask him and he kept blowing her off. He did try and apologize to her, but she said that it would take sometime before she was ready to do that. Then they got in an argument about something in a book and the rest of the day was silent. She said that was the best part.
We stopped outside the doors to the Hall and he finally let go. It felt cold where he dropped my hand, not like I'd ever tell him that though
Draco strode over to the bedside table, bumping my shoulder in the process. He picked up the potion and turned it around in his hands. I thought, in that moment, it might actually drink it. Instead he walked back over to me.
At first, I felt sorry for him, I knew that probably was what he was going for. Then, I felt sympathy because I knew how he felt even if he made it sound like I didn't. In the end, I only felt anger. How dare he say I led a "perfect life"! If he even knew an ounce of just what I went through to get there he would know that isn't true. He may have had Voldemort in his house but did he have him in his mind? Did he die? At least he had parents, albeit not great ones, but he still had them. "
Madam Prince was the same old lady I had always known. Now, she couldn't get mad at me for being "too loud" and even if she did I wouldn't be able to hear it. I wasn't quite sure how she survived the war, maybe she wasn't there. She sat behind a small desk in the corner, papers littering the top of it. Her and Hermione started up a conversation. After a minute, it was cut short and Hermione looked anything but pleased.
Who was he to say he had an easy life? I had been forced into a life I never wanted. I was pressured to be something bigger than I am. Some higher power was always giving me a new task. I was forced to hold up one specific image, not being myself. Everyone would jump from siding with me to hating me faster than I could keep track of. I witnessed people die left and right and never had a family that loved me or was alive.
He looked up at me and I felt my cheeks burn hot again, I hadn't realized I was staring. He quirked an eyebrow but said nothing more. He went back to reading and after a few more minutes of simply pondering why he wasn't moving, I reached across the table and took the book from his hands.
The first sign was right before the teacher walked in and his leg started shaking rapidly. I thought it was just a small tic so I let it slide. Then he was twirling his quill and biting the inside of his cheek. I had no clue what was making him so nervous.
I sat back on the floor facing his bed, resting against my own. He got up without a word, grabbed some clothes, and went into the bathroom. I decided to do the same and get dressed for the day. Once the door was open I couldn't help but laugh. If I had been sorted into Slytherin first year this wouldn't be a strange sight. Malfoy had a mirror levitating beside him, a toothbrush in one hand, and a hairbrush in the other. He got rid of the toothbrush soon after and was so fixated on his hair he didn't notice me slip in to brush my teeth. After he was done he looked over to me and jumped a few inches into the air. I rinsed my mouth and started up laughing again.
Inside the small box was a necklace. The cord was made of braided leather, and it held a charm that exactly resembled a Golden Snitch.
Draco and I had agreed to meet up three times a week: Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. If my friends were suspicious of anything, they didn't let on. I think part of them was just too scared to set me off and the other didn't want to ruin the simple rhythm we had created.
I was growing agitated at the fact they felt I couldn't go off on my own, then I remembered what McGonagall had said. "
"Oh, right," I dug into the bag, pulling out a few items. Things weren't necessarily cheap in London. "You pick first, it's like an honour."
Then the professor came into the classroom and as she set up I noticed his face contort and his chest become slow and heavy.
pissed at him. I get that he would want to know, but surely he understood that this was a very private topic.
"Hey guys I need to go check on something," I said after a few bits of breakfast, "I'll see you in DADA ok?" I was about to leave when Hermione stopped me.
Ever since the war ended, people have been doing nothing but bashing those on Voldemort's side of the war. It's all well deserved, but the Malfoy's lay in a totally different sector. The media may like to write their tabloids, but in the end, the switched sides.
I felt someone nudge my seat. It was Seamus. He took the book peaking out of my bag and opened it to a blank page.
I wasn't sure entirely if he meant what I thought he did. There were so many things that phrase could have meant and I just went along with the best-case scenario. I nodded, too puzzled to use real words.
Speak of the Devil, there he was. I noticed the soft glow coming from his wand across the table. I picked my head up only to look at the sight of Malfoy, sitting across from me, and reading a book. His hair fell in front of his face and the mixture of moonlight and magic made it glow. His eyes reflected the same blue light and seemed more vibrant. He looked calm, at ease.
Hermione started to learn sign language as well as help me learn. We did research on what had caused it, but we couldn't dig much more up than the nurses back at Hogwarts could. We did know that it was caused by an improperly done charm. The chances of reversing spells that you couldn't tell what they were and were misspelled were slim to none. That was when Hermione looked into learning BSL. We all knew it wasn't ideal considering this was an extremely new development. It's not like I could read lips very well considering I'd never had to and I wasn't getting much practice as of late. You can't become fluent in a language in three months, but I would say I'm pretty close. My sentences may not seem as interesting as they could be, though I had never had a particularly interesting way of speaking before.
We walked around the large department store for a little over an hour. Draco wanted to investigate everything he had never seen before. While I had seen most of the items to store carried, I was intrigued nonetheless.
I really wish I had paid more attention to Herbology. I nodded dumbly and watched him walk closer to the plant.
"Oh, do you see that man over there? He's the one who put it together. If you want me to thank him I can, he also can't hear things."
I had known from my... observations in sixth year that he wasn't particularly fond of his mission. If there was anybody who had seen the real Malfoy that year it was probably me. His real friends had no clue of his mission and that was made obvious after word spread of his failed murder attempt. I don't know what they knew because I wasn't friends with the Slytherins and wouldn't be unless something utterly crazy happened. I do know what I saw. The Malfoy that had been crying in that bathroom, sneaking around the halls late at night, and had that sickly pale and tired complexion, was a new side to him.
I found Draco sitting by the famous Oak Tree, which really isn't that famous because I didn't know it existed, on a blanket set up for a picnic. I felt a smile settle onto my face as he glanced up from his latest read,
People are very different in their views of sexuality these days. I didn't want to potentially cause myself harm over something that I wasn't entirely sure was true.
"No! You should have kept quiet or not continued reading or something! This is not my fault," I wasn't sure how loud I was being, but I honestly didn't care. It's not the first time one of our fights has gained attention.
I felt slightly tingly and when he nodded at his work I noticed it was another cleaning charm. Stuck-up prat.
I slowly opened the curtains to my bed and peeked out. It's so hard being deaf at night, I feel a hundred times more likely to wake everyone up. I tried my best to be quiet as my eyes adjusted to the light.
I didn't catch the titles of the others, but I did get one. In big gold letters on the front of the top book stated clearly.
It wasn't a bad feeling, on the contrary, it was the best feeling of being alive I could ever ask for. The mand across from me matched my emotions ten-fold.
In recent events, we have found a fantastic addition to the saga that is Harry Potter. Previously we have delved into Potter's mysterious love-life as well as his connections with on Ex-Death-Eater, Draco Malfoy. What if I were to tell you that both may not be as distant as we may have thought?
Seamus looks around, like a detective from a cheap Murder Mystery. See, one the one hand you have people ready to sucker punch you around the corner because they think you take it up the arse now. On the other hand, you have people who are bloody peeing themselves to get a look at the schools first gay couple.
I don't know why I suspected they were getting along now. I was the one that reached out to him, not them. They probably thought he hadn't changed and I was just trying to be nicer.
We split up at the gate, I sighed at the loss of his hand in mine, but I needed to be alone for this. Christmas was fast approaching, only about three weeks away, and I hadn't gotten Draco a present yet.
On those days where I wasn't really with anybody I found the full use of my home again. My Firebolt and I had become acquainted again after months without use. I missed the rushing feeling of the wind. It was so much more prominent without having to hear the air in my ears.
I didn't think about what would happen because of this. I didn't think of where this was headed or who would find out. Nothing else mattered and I was content with my life.
I pushed it out of my head and started dating Ginny, she was the only future I could ever see myself realistically having.
"You did what?!" I was shocked. At the time I know it was wrong to be this upset about something like this. She wasn't handling it horribly, but my anger has always gotten the best of me. "If you weren't happy we should have called it off earlier! Merlin knows I didn't want to date you!"
The headmistress's lips moved and the man interpreted what she was saying with BSL. Oh, that's why he was here.
While he did that, I decided to scan the perimeter. Nothing was really that unexpected, just trees and grass for kilometers.
I don't know how that's possible, but it didn't really matter at the moment. We just needed to know why he had those books and how to get them from him.
Malfoy got up out of his seat not sparing me a glance. I quickly went to catch up with him. After a moment of studying him, I noticed he too didn't have a schedule. I tried to think of why we weren't given one, but it didn't seem very obvious. I was close enough now to tap his shoulder. He jumped a little, not hearing me sneak up behind him. He said something that looked like he wanted to seem cold but his heart wasn't in it.
I didn't notice Ron's face, but there was some slight hurt in Draco's when I used his last name. I'll talk to him about that later.
The kitchen was all prepared for today's Christmas extravaganza, well at least a small corner of the kitchen was. The only way to spend Christmas-Eve-Eve is baking like there's no tomorrow.
Right Side: Theodore Nott, Zacharias Smith, Neville Longbottom, Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Seamus Finnigan
I was fully aware of how hard it would be to be back in that school and also trying to get an education without hearing was less than ideal. I was positive that the teachers knew of my situation, but for once in my life, I didn't want to be alone in this. I needed someone there who had gone through what I had. My friends put up with me and went along with everything, but they didn't have the same pain and pressure I did. Malfoy would have to do for now.
I was this close to strangling him. If he insisted on taking the most boring classes this school had to offer I would only fight back with the ones I knew he didn't like.
Towards the end, he caught my stare, and again I felt that unfamiliar heat in my face. Probably embarrassment.
"Can you feel that?" He nodded his head. "Concentrate, breathe with the beat," we were so close it was almost impossible for him not to see what I said.
He slowly rose after being shaken for a solid three minutes. He yawned, pulling the curtains fully away as I got dressed.
He tore part of the roof off, dripping with melted frosting and sprinkles, and bit into it. He made a face in between admiration and disgust.
I rolled off the mattress, falling onto the person who had caused this mess. His face was an even brighter red, contrasting wonderfully with his pale complexion. I propped myself onto my elbows and stared down at him.
When I had checked the room to see if anyone was hiding around, I ushered her to the bed. After five paces in front of her, she stuck her foot out and tripped me. "What was that for?"
So I leave you with this, if the world wants to ignore my favorite part of this story and turn it's back on the less gory aspects of life then so be it. I will tell my own story no matter what people think, because how can I lose something when I have nothing left to give?
I looked over at Draco to see him crouched down by the lowest books, something about magical first aid. His hair fell into his eyes and I had the strange urge to brush it away for him. He must have noticed me staring because he looked over and quirked an eyebrow.
He waved over Madam Pomphrey and she made her way over, it was the first time she had moved in the past half hour. They spoke in hushed voices, making it impossible to understand what they were talking about.
We watched the slow-moving city life, eating food that was obviously not fit for dinner, and enjoying the silence. The silence, we had grown so used to it. We had grown to love it.
What would a loving, caring, perfect boyfriend do in this situation? I honestly don't know, but my instincts are never wrong. Well, most of the time.
"I-I just don't think I'm ready yet. It's all too soon and we just started dating and I-I can't yet." I felt my eyes turn glassy. I took a deep breath and relaxed slightly. I've handled much worse before, it's Draco that should be more upset.
I remember wanting to stay in that room forever. I remember wanting to run after him, scream at him that I was wrong.
I stood, reaching out a hand for him to take. I led him over to a clearing next to the blanket. I stood behind him and placed my hand over the one holding his wand. Raising his arm up, I made sure he was in the proper position.
I made my way down to the library, it was after sundown so I had to sneak in with the cloak, but it's not like that's anything new.
I glanced over again at Draco. His eyes were downcast, hands wrung together and twisting in his lap. I reached out and placed my hand lightly on his, they stopped moving and turning upwards to lace through my fingers. He let out a small smile, head never moving its bent position.
I flopped back on the bed, I just had to tell her at this point. "Th-they're a boy, 'Mione. I just don't get it."
I thought back to Mr. A. He didn't seem evil, but he wasn't normal. I really shouldn't be worried about it and just leave it be. If he causes problems I'll just let the professors handle it. That wasn't like me and I knew it. Perhaps I'll quietly observe him. It won't be my main focus for the year, just a side quest. I really needed to focus on finding this cure for magical hearing loss and fast. I don't know how easy it would be to become buddy-buddy with Malfoy.
As Hermione read that she mentioned something to Ron and he just shook his head. Probably something that didn't concern me. Some part of my mind thought that maybe that's exactly the reason they didn't want me to know.
Snow crunched under my feet as I walked towards the Three Broomsticks. My breath curled around my face, and I let out a soft smile. It was only three days until Christmas, my personal favourite holiday.
Almost everyone knew, better assumed, that Draco was in fact gay. Like I said earlier, he's fancy and pureblooded, so if he was gay, he would have had to hide that fact. The last thing we both need is for the
I handed it back and they both leaned in to read it. Hermione scooted closer to him and Ron slyly took her unused hand into his.
fighting a war is a minor technicality compared to taking your NEWTs. Hermione would probably agree. Thinking about the war still brings back memories. Of course, it also brings up those unanswered questions.
I decided to dwell more on what could come of this newly discovered feeling. I can't see this going anywhere, as much as I might want it to. I haven't really even come to terms with this part of myself, just a month ago I thought I was straight, so cut me some slack.
We settled into a corner far away from the working elves and feasted on bacon sandwiches and coffee. Draco seemed a tad uncomfortable with the friendliness of the house-elves here, I doubt he had seen much of that in his time at the manor.
Ok, but if I get up there and you're in bed with Malfoy I'm cutting your balls off before you get impregnated in the dorm room.
I smiled at him. He had a weird way of showing it, but he really did have emotions. Who knew Draco Malfoy was human under that mask?
I don't know Dean, I've never felt like this before. I flopped down on the bed with a slight bounce.
"I'll look forward to it." He leaned back and I noticed the fatigue from earlier set in. "But first, we need to get you to bed."
I got a weird sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu from the other time he had done this except this time was different. This time he didn't let go, and I found I didn't mind.
One thing I absolutely hate about sign language is that they have to look at you to see it. He had turned his head, forcing the conversation to end. I didn't want him to get the wrong idea.
After breakfast, we headed back down to Hogsmede. This wasn't technically a date, in fact, we weren't even going to be with each other for most of the trip. I wanted to get Christmas presents, and Draco wanted to leave the stuffiness of the castle, so this was a good solution.
Once we were there he let go of my hand and began unlocking the desk. I wiped my sweaty palm onto my trousers and tried to look useful.
I thought more about Malfoy. What would happen if I had taken his hand? Would I be where I am now? Would I have been able to beat Voldemort? I knew I would have been in Slytherin if I had trusted him instead of Ron. It may have even taken less time if I had them on my side. Hermione might be smart, but she's kinda the only Gryffindor like that. They would understand the war more than we did. A lot of their parents were Death Eaters and would have had helpful information. Getting that information from the snakes is the hard part.
They did that annoying thing that couples do where they seem to be talking without moving their mouths. They can talk all they want, I wouldn't be able to understand.
The leaves crushed under our shoes as we walked through the forest. We had no clue where we were supposed to be going, we were hoping for a sign.
Maybe Malfoy could help? He's smart, right? It's probably a potion and as much as I hate to admit it he's brilliant with those. That was a joke though, Malfoy would never do that for me. Although, it would be helping himself too, and isn't that an extremely Malfoy thing to do?
That liar. I know for a fact that one of the whole reasons we meet is for him to avoid sleeping. He never elaborated on that.
clear. I wished we could be a bit more progressive, but how can we if we still are proactively living in the middle ages. With these thoughts and some glares and stares from my dormmates, I hopped into bed and closed the curtains tight.
I tended to look at the whole being deaf thing as an outsider. I had only had my hearing loss for a few months and we were still determined to get it back. I knew deep down that there was a way to fix this. I still continued to learn BSL because I also knew that it would be a while before that would happen. Hermione was extremely good at it and I wouldn't be surprised if she had already known a lot of it. Ron was... trying to say the least. The only other person I had seen this summer was Ginny, but she didn't come over much after the breakup.
He smirked, "I did promise I would take you out properly after what happened yesterday. What would you say to next Friday?" He tilted my chin up.
I read the note over Draco's shoulder. There's no way that only ten cans were enough for that family. I sent him a look, he only replied with a knowing smile.
I watched as the clock on the wall of the infirmary ticked the passing seconds. A chill passed through be before I replied, "
I wince at both Ron's bluntness and 'Minone's attempt to hide the present situation. I knew it was hard on Ron as well, he loved Ginny and to see her upset because of me probably hurt. She didn't seem to care about me at the time so I didn't see the problem when I did it. I still feel guilty about it, now that I've had time to think, and I also knew I should have done it long before the war started. It wasn't fair on her to make her date someone that wasn't present for the majority of their relationship. The things she said after, the things she admitted to... it left us both sore. I don't think we could ever come to an agreement after that. I was too harsh, she was damaged and I should have stayed even if it would have hurt me. I hadn't cared about myself for years why did it matter
Getting Ron and Hermione to cover for me was much easier than expected. Ron seemed a bit confused, and Hermione had the scary knowing look in her eye, but it was better than facing the school.
He made move to leave the library and I let him go. He took the torch with him so that he could find his way back. He wasn't allowed to use his wand in the corridors, some strange part of his probation.
Afterwords Draco took his notes and duplicated them. He handed them over after making a small comment about how mine were impossible to read, then swiftly left me standing in the hall.
What I found strange was that once the light was gone from where it had been, there was still a faint glow. I tried to find the source only to see a small torch in the distance, floating mid-air. It was attached to a hand, but that nad had nobody.
We were seated like any other night. Across from each other in a familiar aisle of the library. Yet, the atmosphere had never felt more different.
We had been looking through the books for hours to no avail. I think that they had some sort of engorgment charm because there was no way that this many books could fit onto those shelves.
I asked. I thought it was weird she didn't ask Ron to come. I guess he was still sore over the bus ride or something.
He was having a much easier time than I was with this. Surely there was a better way to do this that didn't involve as much touching or staring.
I stopped in my tracks. Ron and I were on the way to dinner and I hadn't given much thought into last night.
I woke up by being shaken out of bed by none other than Ron Weasley. When I fell, I sat up and checked the time. Great, I had slept through breakfast. I looked over to the bed next to mine and saw the familiar head of blonde hair was also asleep. That's another I've noticed. If you don't have sounds to wake you up, you sleep for extremely long amounts of time.
Harry rakes a hand through his messy hair, shoving his glasses askew, and wonders how he couldâve been so stupidly rash. Grabbing a shirt, he pulls it on over his head, managing not to snag the fabric on his glasses, and cradles his head in his hands, massaging his temples, attempting to rid himself of the growing pain in his head. If he hadnât been so reckless things couldâve gone differently, he could be in Hogsmeade with Draco right now instead of sitting on the rumpled sheets of his bed staring at the hangings and thinking about him. Draco who is just beyond that bathroom door, probably cursing his name as he gets ready for classes that day.
Not this early, it couldnât have spread down his arm to his hand overnight. As he stared at the streams of water and storms that lay cradled in his hands he feels the presence at the edge of his thoughts begin to wake and he panics, fleeing into the bathroom and locking the door behind him.
Merlin no! He didnât want to see more of Draco, didnât want to see him shirtless, picture him completely naked, picture himâ¦
Harry can feel the tension build in those few heavy seconds, those seconds in which Dracoâs eyes flit through several emotions in an alarmingly short amount of time before finally settling on wonder.
A slight pink colors Malfoyâs cheeks and he rolls his eyes, pointing one slender finger at Harryâs sopping hair, âYour hair, Potter.â
Harry frowns ignoring the barbed comment and calls after him before he can leave, âWhatâs with the scarf? Chilly, Malfoy?â
âNo! No, not what I was thinking, I just wondered why you were dressing so strangely all of a sudden.â
Harry decided to ignore it and instead lifted his shirt and twisted around to look at the tattoo and frowned. Over the past minute a few more vines had sprouted and the smoke coming from the dragonâs snout seemed to be denser. A strange idea popped into Harryâs mind as he examined the tattoo again, in earnest. The schoolâs motto, as Harry remembered, said ânever tickle a sleeping dragonâ, but why? What would happen if he did? The repercussions couldnât be that bad for a tattoo dragon.
Harry yanks up his shirtsleeve on the way to the washroom and stares at his tattoo. A vine, more specifically a bramble, was prickling at his skin and three clean droplets of blood had welled up where the tattoo thorns had gauged his skin. The prickling vine had broken from under his own skin, leaving a terrible gash; he stares in horror and shudders as the plant disappears under his skin, fading back into ink.
Harry stepped forward, knowing he was about to regret what he was about to say, âLook, itâs alright! I didnât get hurt and I was only hexed once!â
Harry snaps out of his trance and scowls at him before taking the glass stirring rod from him, âI was not drooling.â He muttered.
At the sink stood the last person he expected to run into at this hour. He stood stone still, at the sink, knuckles white against the porcelain, hair and clothes ruffled, eyes intense as he stared at his own reflection with a look of malice. His face looked even more gaunt than usual, his eyes had dark circles under them, and his breath came in ragged short puffs as he fought whatever his silent battle was. Harry stands in the doorway waiting for Malfoy to move, for this calm before the storm to break, or rather this taut tension to spring back and hit him in the face like a rubber band.
He would need to go to the library tomorrow as well, it was a lot more likely that he would find answers there. He remembered some myth his mother told him that sort of reminded him of his sudden tattoo, but he knew it wasnât possible. It was an old dark spell meant to find a soulmate, often used among pureblood families to see if an arranged marriage was more ideal than not, but Draco knew it wasnât even up for consideration, the spell had been banned long ago even before the new restrictions. The spell if not acknowledged, would do anything to drive the âsoulmatesâ together, going as far as to murder spouses in the process or to other extreme lengths, the tattoo was merely a side-effect.
Harry messed with the strap of his bag as he walked into the charms classroom flanked by Hermione and Ron on one side and Ginny and Luna on the other. Harry was worried about Draco and hoped he would talk to him, even if their feelings for each other werenât mutual.
Draco floats through his classes in a sort of dazed fog. Itâs as if he is there, but at the same time a hundred miles away, thinking about something else, doing something else. His hands have been prickling for the past thirty minutes, but he has elected to ignore it, much as he had been doing with everything else today. So of course when he sees the ink moving freely on the back of his hand, he feels a spike of panic course straight through him.
So he laid in his bed with the curtains drawn, staring up into the pitch black, willing his heart to stop pounding. Because, it wasnât anything too serious, right? He lightly sighed into the darkness, Draco knew that wasnât true, Draco knew that whatever happened was going to end up taking a turn for the worse.
Harry hands him the rod and slices the last bits of daisy stem and tosses them into the cauldron, where Malfoy then stirs clockwise five times and scourgifies the rod, setting it beside their cauldron. Harry skims over the instructions again, seeing that now all they had to do was wait until the concoction turned a shade of shimmering magenta and smelled like âautumnâ, whatever that meant. He carelessly runs a hand through his messy hair and wordlessly begins to gather up the leftover ingredients while Malfoy vanishes the abandoned scraps, messes, and spills.
The haze suddenly grows bone-chillingly cold and tendrils of ice meet the metaphorical storm in his mind, Malfoyâs glare pierces through him as he takes a few deliberate steps towards Harry, âYou think you know me, donât you? You think that my marks define me?â he hisses, voice rising. Malfoy is now towering over Harryâs sitting position barely on the edge of screaming, hatred seething from his voice, whether directed towards Harry or himself he doesnât know, âYou think that every mark and scar that covers my body is a reflection of myself? You think that I wanted the mark, your slashes across my chest, countless scars I received in my own home? You think I wanted to become this?â Malfoy gestures over his lean frame, darkened eyes, âIf you think I wanted any of this, any of this bias, any of the torture then perhaps you should take a closer look in the mirror, Potter. Because while you may love your scars and all of their attention, I most certainly do not love my own.â
Right before he can finish his sentence the door to the bathroom swings open and Draco finds himself face-to-face with a shirtless Harry Potter.
âDraco, I know you probably donât like me much, but I showed you my tattoo for a reason, so if you could just please come out of there and talk to meâ¦â
He came to the door of his and Dracoâs shared room and wrentched the door open to find him draped over Harryâs bed, like he had just passed out there.
Malfoyâs eyes clouded over with some unrecognizable emotion and he snarls, âWhy would I have nightmares? Iâm not like you, Potter! Always crying out loud every night, honestly I canât ever get any sleep!â
Harry begins to walk towards the door, but as soon as his hand brushes the knob he turns back and walks to stand in front of the bathroom door.
He blankly stares at the chalkboard at the front of the room and blinks. Who even said that Harry was hurting himself? It could just be what had happened with the tattoo.
Harry rubs his eyes and sighs, before grabbing his wand and bag from beside his bed; there wasnât much reason to wallow in his self pity all day, he had to go to class afterall.
With a steady, yet hesitant hand, Draco barely touches the flank of the dragon, watching as itâs dull grey scales burst into a shimmering irredescant silver, each one individually reflecting the color from the rest of his tattoos. He can hear Harryâs sigh of content and his muscles untense even more. He has both of his hands on Harry now and he runs them down the sides of his body, starting from the place where his hipbones jut out and moving up until Draco is just barely tracing Harryâs collarbones. Harry realeases a small hum of happiness and cups Dracoâs shoulder, pulling him even more flush towards his body, until Draco is so close that he can see the individual flecks of gold in his green eyes.
Draco just stands there holding his breath, for a second completely at a loss for words before unsteadily saying, âWell, it canât be more obvious than a black lion with antlers and a lightning bolt scar.â
He was in his new room shared with the golden boy himself and lacking even more in privacy than the dorms. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and yawned quietly, but stopped when he saw his hands.
As Harry lifts up the back of his shirt he hears Hermione gasp and Ron weakly mumble, âBloody hell.â
He grimaced at how quickly it was spreading and clambered into the shower, dreading the day he couldnât cover it up anymore. When that happened, everyone would be running after him attempting to kiss the golden boy, to see if they were soulmates, kindly avoiding the question of if they had a soulmark like he did. He groans to himself as he thinks about the kind of publicity it would get, what the media would say. He could picture the headlines now, âGolden Boy with a soulmate Tattoo?! See how good your chances of snogging him are!â. He groans again; he had enough trouble avoiding crowds as it was, if word ever got out about this tattoo, it would be a whole different level of unbearable.
Harryâs smile fell from his face and his heart wrentched pitifully. Was he really that bad? He fell onto his bed and silently cursed his own stupidity. Harry shouldâve known that Draco didnât share his feelings, he had after all hated Harry for years and the war certainly wasnât going to change things.
With a flourish of his robes Draco exits the room and Harry breathes out a sigh of relief as the tightness in his chest vanishes slowly being replaced with guilt and hysteria, then chokes out a strangled gasp as something prickles at his forearm.
Malfoy didnât notice him for a few moments, but when he did the innocent serene expression was replaced with one of loathing, âWhat do you want, Potter?â
âWell Potter, to noble to answer?â he snarls with an indistinct emotion glimmering in the depths of his storming eyes.
Harry doesnât turn, but he can feel Malfoyâs eyes on him from the doorway as he begins to unpack a few of his things. When he does chance a look the blond has an expression of confusion stuck on his face and he was fiddling with the collar of his shirt which was buttoned snugly up to his chin. Draco stared at him for a few seconds longer before jutting his chin out and strutting into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him with an audible click.
Before he knew it, he was standing in front of Dracoâs work table, the rest of his companions nowhere in sight. And there Draco sat, determinedly staring straight ahead, his face blank and unreadable, every aspect of his appearance immaculate, excluding the dark circles under his eyes.
When he returned to the common room he was surprised to see Malfoy sitting in one of the armchairs by the fire with a book in hand unaware of Harryâs presence. He lookedâ¦ serene. Malfoyâs permanent scowl wasnât stuck to his face as he read and without it he seemed a lot calmer, more pleasant. His grey eyes, made a burning silver by the flickering flames of the fire, were sharp as ever as he read, but they somehow seemed to make him look even more tranquil. His hair, also lit by the flames, shining like strands of silver cast and ethereal glow upon him, and he lookedâ¦ nice?
Granger just stares at him, âDo you? It hurts him you know, the tattoo. It pyhsically hurts him, it leaves him-â
Harryâs face heats up and he hurriedly begins to rinse the last bits of shampoo out of his hair, âIâm not playing with my prick you tosser!â
âGranger! What are you doing? Let go of me at once!â Forboding was hanging around them in a cloud and Draco felt on edge, like he knew what was coming.
Malfoy stares at him for a second in shock before setting his jaw, âI didnât think of that, but couldnât we have even more stirring time if we just lowered the flame and chopped it into smaller pieces?â
Later on in the evening after visiting the library and discussing this entire soulmate business with Ron and Hermione, Harry had finally resolved about doing something. He had learned from Hermione that Draco apparently already knew, so the only thing that Harry had left to do was go for it. It, being the kiss, and quite possibly the reason that he may get a stinging hex to the privates later this evening.
Not knowing what to do Harry just ends up clearing his throat causing Malfoy to jump. His eyes move to look at him in the reflection of the mirror and Harry is reminded of another time when their eyes met in the mirror, going rigid. Malfoy instantly has his wand out with a look of fury and when he opens his mouth Harry thinks itâs to hex him, but instead he asks with a croak, âWhat are you doing here, Potter?â
Without thinking, Draco tugged his collar up higher, just in case his tattoo had grown larger during the day and had spread up to his chin, and hissed, âWatch where youâre going, Potter!â
And like that they stayed, for a good while. Finally understanding, not needing their words for the first time in a lifetime, only eachother.
Harry begins to carefully slice equal increments of daisy stems and as the minutes passed their work station continued to grow even more stifling. He uncomfortable tugged at the collar of his shirt and glanced at Malfoy, wondering how he was still able to wear all his robes in the stifling heat. A bead of sweat drips down Malfoyâs temple and he wipes it away with the back of his hand still stirring, his high arching brows furrowed in concentration. He watches him a bit longer, entranced by the way his long, deft fingers carefully stir the potion and casually flip through their potions book. The flames set his eyes alight, glowing in the dark of the potions classroom almost reminiscent of the way the common room fire danced in his eyes, the silver tinted orange, the colors mixing like a pool of lava and molten lead.
Draco stared numbly at his forearms as he watched the tattoo slowly creep back down his pale skin until it reached his wrists, the clouds stormy and gloomy and spiting tattoo rain all over his skin. Flickering light came from within the gloomy greys, as if the storm was trying to decide if it wanted to send dazzeling electric bolts dancing across his skin.
âWell it didnât do anything bad! It hit me in the back and hurt a little but I donât feel anything now.â
The blood drains from his cheeks as he realizes what this could mean. Harry, being the loyal idiot he is, probably told his little friends all about his lovely tattoo as soon as he received it, which means they probably knew what it was. Thatâs why they were all in the library that one evening right after he received it. All his blank puzzle pieces were beginning to makes sense and repair themselves then fit together, which would logically reveal the picture on top or supposedly. But worse than not being to solve the puzzle, or having the pieces to do so and no guide to put it together, had to be being able to solve the puzzle but unable see the outcome.
Harry stared a few moments too long, his heart wrenching, his stomach churning, swallowing back the lump of something painful in his throat. He realeased the shaky breath he was unaware he was holding in and sat down beside Draco who looked as unaffected as ever, who didnât even look slightly bothered by any of this.
Harry silently thanks himself for using the disillusionment charm and holds his breath, heart racing. Malfoy, scowling with a fearful glint in his eye, swallows as his gaze sweeps right over the area where Harry sat, still as death. Malfoy stands for a few moments longer before putting his wand away and walking down to Hogsmeade.
Draco smirks as Harry swallows and looks away, obviously embarassed, âCalling me cold hearted? How flattering, Potter. And anyways, I donât believe you, there is no way you canât be freezing right now.â
Dracoâs thoughts flashback to earlier in the restrooms where he had stopped and looked at his chest, it had been terrible, surreal, terrifying.
Draco plunges his trembling hands into his bag and pulls on the silkly black gloves he had on earlier, thankful for them now more than ever. Draco leaves as the class ends, luckily and unfortunately, the last one of that day. He trudges down to the great hall, as if walking to his last meal before a certain execution. He barely tastes anything that passes his lips and when he leaves the great hall he can feel at least one pair of eyes boring into his back and registers that something is awfully wrong.
He traces the muscles, the bone, the tendons of his body, swirling closer and closer to the dragon which lies just below his clavical now, covering a good portion of the killing curse scar.
He bandages each hand carefully before cursing; he hadnât showered yet, heâd just have to take them off again.
Harry waited a few moments his apprehension building, and then breaking when he hears running water from the showerhead signaling that he would not be talking to Draco until much later.
As he cast the charm, he felt his hands itch and soon the skin of his hands were covered in what looked like recent burn scars, with not a single part of the tattoo showing. He sighs in relief, the charm takes six hours to wear off and then heâd have to reapply it, and reaches into his trunk pulling out a roll of bandages.
She spins around to face Harry so fast that heâs afraid she might have whiplash, âOnly once! Only got hexed once! Harry are you out of your mind!â
Harry woke up with a stab of fear that was not his own and confusion began to hover over him like a thick cloud. He grabbed his glasses and shoved them on and stared at Dracoâs empty, messed up bed, feeling a jolt of panic run through him, equal parts his own and someone elseâs.
Malfoy scowls, lacking some of its regular venom, âBrilliant deduction Potter, it appears she has, although why she thinks that the two of us are less likely to cause trouble than literally any other pairing, I donât know.â
Draco glanced up at Potterâs smirk, and thought that maybe he did. Maybe Potter knew, knew just how pathetic he was and was taunting him. Of course he knew, he had seen what Draco was really like, he had seen him. Potterâs smug smirk faltered for a moment, but was quickly replaced with a grin.
Oh, and of course just as he was ready to leave Potter had to show up, nearly scaring him to death with his wild hair and general disarray. Honestly, Potter should have better sense than to sneak up behind people in mirrors! Draco shivers as he remembers the Sectumsempra incident; he still couldnât bear the sight of the long slashes on his chest.  Potterâs marks all over his chest, countless other scars from numerous Death Eaters, the dark mark that hadnât faded completely, and now this. Too many people had left their mark on Draco, he may not know who had left this most recent one, but he hoped that whoever did payed for it.
He turns to see Harryâs reaction and is not dissapointed because the dark flush on his face is quite visable despite his tan skin. Draco just smirks and gracefully slides down onto the sofa beside him, with his transfiguration book in hand, choosing to ignore Potterâs obviously flushed face and gaping mouth.
Itâs the wonder that Harry sees when Draco reaches up with one hand to cradle Harryâs cheek, itâs the amazement he sees when Dracoâs eyes widen just a fraction, itâs the beauty he sees when Dracoâs face is finally openly displaying what he feels. Itâs something stirring in his chest waiting to explode when he realizes that Draco doesnât feel uncomfortable being near Harry anymore.
Harry runs all the way back and as he nears the entrance of Hogwarts he almost runs straight into Draco Malfoy. Before they collide, Harry leaps out of his path and lands heavily on the cobble stones, right on his back. He winces and watches in horror as Malfoy with draws his wand with a suspicious glare before clutching at an area near his collarbones, which are covered by a green and silver scarf.
Harry stared after him for some time in shock. Did he really cry out? Maybe he needed to get some dreamless sleep from the infirmary. He looked at himself in the mirror for a second, debating if he should check to see how bad his tattoo had gotten, but decides that he didnât really want to know. Instead he splashes cold water on his face and goes back to bed, managing to sleep by some miracle.
Granger let go of his robes and swirled around to face him just outside the classroom, her face deadly serious, âI know, Malfoy, and donât pretend you donât know what Iâm talking about.â
It had happened yesterday, when he was on his way to Hogsmeade to buy himself another scarf. He had just been walking out of the castle when the skin on his chest began to burn, of course with his own stupidity he had just covered it with his scarf dismissing it as the cold. In the courtyard, he couldâve sworn that someone was there, but dismissed it as paranoia. Of course, when he returned and removed his scarf he discovered it.
(Just go with me here, it's for plot purposes, I know Ginny isn't "feminine" in the books and is presented as more of a tomboy. I don't really like Ginny so we're changing things up)
I sat down across from him, he was engrossed in an old Shakespeare novel. I took the book you of his hands.
I made it out alive, but I wasn't truly living. I've never felt so alone in my life. At least when I lived with the Dursley's I hadn't had the experience of feeling accepted and welcomed. I've said many times that Hogwarts is my first real home and that couldn't be more true. Throughout everything and everybody, every challenge, and snide remark, every dark wizard and light, I still had people on my side that knew what I was going through.
Well, you might want to spread the word faster. I mean, we know you didn't leave school last night, but some people think otherwise.
For the first time this year, Ron wasn't there to wake me up. I looked over to my nightstand and as the journal opened.
"Keep it down! If someone around here thought the same it would be chaos when this is over. You can't yell things like that in this era."
She kneeled over her brother with many of the other Weasleys. Some, like Ron, were trying to push it away and finish the Battle first. Ginny could barely move.
I shook my head and went over to the table on the far right side of the room, behind Gryffindor. Keeping my head down until Hermione tapped my shoulder and pointed to McGonagall at the front of the Hall. I didn't understand what she was saying, but I figured it was the usual speech. I decided to see who else had come back. They had sent letters to everybody, though it seemed a lot of them didn't want to be back and I couldn't blame them. I saw Malfoy, Parkinson, and Zambini at the end of the table. It was weird not seeing Crabbe and Goyle with them but after Crabbe... I couldn't see Goyle coming back. Theodore Nott and Daphne Greengrass also sat by them, keeping some distance. Almost no one from Hufflepuff came back, it's not like I knew many of them. Every Ravenclaw from our year was there, which was only about 12. Then there was our trio, Neville, Dean, Seamus, and Pavarti.
We sat close on the bench, no one was really out at this time, just dog walkers and couples on strolls of the city. A wind blew by, Draco put his arm on the backrest behind me, I leaned into his touch.
That was all I needed to make my choice. I couldn't leave somebody in a very similar position to me to attend a school full of people who would hate his every move. I wouldn't allow the pettiness of others to damage the already very crumbled soul of Draco Malfoy. I needed to make amends, I needed to at least not be a complete arse to him when we went back. Whether or not he decided to do the same was up to him. I didn't even know if he was coming back. I, for one, know I wasn't one to hold a grudge, him on the other hand not so much.
I know Mcgonagall said we should both have a "hearing capable" person by us, but we kinda threw that out the window pretty quickly. She nodded goodbye and I made my way to the Headmistress's office.
Reaching out, I tilted his chin up. His eyes were glassy and I felt something clench in my gut. He looked so broken.
He was close enough now I could make out the words forming on his lips. "So, about this mystery dinner..."
He crossed his arms and stood up. The two boys sitting in the room left us alone with a sideways glance.
I knew we had... kissed... or whatever, but did that really mean anything? I mean it did to me, but I couldn't really... go out with Draco, could I? I mean he's a guy and that would make me gay or something. This is confusing.
"Sure, Harry what's up?" I walked her over to the corner of the room and she dabbed her eyes with her sleeve lightly.
I glanced back at Ron who was leaning against the wall and staring Draco down, he paid no mind to it.
"Slow and steady wins the race," I mumbled after him. He wouldn't have heard me even if I had yelled it.
He really had changed. No name-calling, finishing my sentence, and telling me where he would be so we could figure this out? Yup, definitely changed.
Ron and Hermione both nodded slightly at the remark but decided to remain quiet. This was exceeding awkward.
My life had become so routine, in fact, that I was unable to see anyway that something could interfere.
I stood and reached out my hand to bring him up. He accepted and quickly retracted it, wiping his hand on his trousers. My hand gets cold now, like it was missing something.
It was then I realized again, just how broken he probably was. I doubt many people had given him that offer, much less he take them up on it.
One thing I did know, I really did enjoy kissing him. I only hoped he felt the same. I know he likes me too, why else would he ask me out? It's still hard to comprehend it, I had never thought about it before.
The first feeling was shock. I wasn't stiff like I thought I would be, not that I thought about this happening often. He tilted his head to the side in order to give me more room and I complied.
"Fine, I'll ignore it, but don't ask any more questions and please whatever you do. Don't. Tell. Anyone."
It wasn't until we got into the Great Hall that I actually regretted coming back. I pushed the doors open with Ron and Hermione behind me. I wouldn't have noticed the chatter of the room dying if they hadn't all been looking right at me. Suddenly I thought maybe going in first wasn't a good idea. Maybe going back to Hogwarts hadn't been a good idea.
Christmas Eve's plans don't start until late that night. I asked Draco to meet me in front of the school, he has no idea what's in store.
I walked through the barrier to King's Cross Station. The bustling of the crowd was just loud enough that it sounded like low ocean waves. I looked at the large train, not thinking I would ever see it again or miss the sound of the whistle. I tried looking around to find my friends. I found the Weasleys and Hermione a little ways away. It wasn't hard to see the sea of red hair amongst the other wizards on the platform. I didn't go over to them though. I felt awkward being around their family. It was my fault they were so broken. If it wasn't for me Fred wouldn't be dead, George would be happy again, and Ginny wouldn't be pissed at me.
"You're a git Malfoy!" I called after him. I don't know how loud it was, but he wouldn't be able to hear it anyways.
My mind reeled with thoughts. How could she know? Why was she dictating my lo-personal life? And why didn't she believe that he had changed? "
She shook her head and pointed at me, "You need me?" She nodded, "Well, alright, but you're going to have to write down what you want to say. Is that ok?"
"I was alone, so alone this year. It was terrible, but you wouldn't know that. Everything was so dark and you had just left with practically no explanation. I thought we were through for a while. I needed someone to help me forget everything. I- I cheated Harry. I'm terrible and now you probably hate me."
He took the package gracefully and began to unwrap it. I wasn't quite sure what to get him, I was pretty sure he had everything. Then I remember back when we were picking our classes, and he had a strange want to take Astronomy. So I went to the glass shop in Hogsmede and made up the perfect gift.
I walked over to where Draco was crouched and sat back on my knees in front of him. He still looked shocked so I repeated my questions. When he shook out of his daze he sent me a glare. I didn't take it to heart.
"Explain, please. If I die... I want to know." I could feel the water in my own eyes threatening to spill. This was not how I was intending it to go.
I noticed some people were already asleep. It seemed lucky that Seamus and Dean were at the end so they could easily sneak over to each other in the night. Not many people knew about them, the 90s were not a very supportive era, even in the Wizarding World. G-..... Some people had made that
He closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. Slowly his lips moved, forming the familiar words that fell silent on our ears. A thin strand of silver drew out of his wand, yet nothing more came.
She sent me a wink and shut the doors behind her. We looked at each other. I shrugged and walked to our table.
His breath evened out, and I stroked his hair until I was certain he was asleep. I wish I could have stayed awake to watch his sleep (I'm not a creep I swear!), but I too was feeling tired.
I manoeuvred my way over to my usual seat across from my friends. Sitting down, I piled a small helping of food onto my plate. "Thank you for today, I needed to get out of here."
I smirked. He obviously didn't like that. If there was one person who hated Divination as much as Hermione, it was Malfoy.
I just wanted a good relationship for once and apparently, my heart was set on the one person who would be impossible to get. Unless he made the first move, there would be no first move. I think I'm ok with that, maybe then it will all go away.
Though he was pureblood and fancy like that. Maybe it was customary or maybe he hasn't had much experience with writing letters to friends? No, that can't be right. He's definitely written formal letters before.
and turning to leave. When I shut the door I thought about what on Earth had just happened. It wasn't like Malfoy to not jump at the chance to humiliate me. It also wasn't like Pansy and Blaise to not tell him I was there. Not to mention he went deaf too? That couldn't just be a coincidence. On top of all that, now I had even more reasons pushing me to make amends with him. Who knows, maybe he did change.
I noticed the long red hair out of the corner of my eye. Ginny looked smug like she was finally going to get back at me for something I didn't do, well sort of.
I sign back. I have to maintain eye contact but I glance over at Malfoy one last time before signing,
I reached out to grab his wrist, but he tugged away. I figured if this wasn't a good time to talk then I would let him go his own way for now. I wouldn't avoid this forever though. Whether I liked it or not, Draco was a part of my life now.
In the end, he was right though, I'm not perfect. What better way to prove so than to demonstrate that.
He stood up slightly leaning forward over the table with his hands pressed down onto it. I had to tilt my chair back slightly so he didn't get in my face. I knew if I could hear him I might even be scared of his tone. "
I felt like things had gone so fast, yet so slow, over these past weeks. I barely had time to even think about what was going on between us. What was going on between us?
I drifted to sleep, only later would it occur to me that this was the first time I had shared a bed with someone. I was so content, I didn't even notice that the curtains were still parted.
Way back in sixth year, I had been going through a strange period in my life. I had finally understood what it meant to truly fancy someone. The problem was it was never who I wanted it to be.
I shook my head and backed away, wanting nothing more than to wipe the tears from his eyes that threatened to fall. The clock kept ticking. "Draco, I can't..."
In hindsight, the latter was what I should have done. Instead, for the first time, I felt like a coward. I was such a coward. There was him, who I had wedged into my life, and now I was letting him go. I can't believe how stupid I was.
Classes had gone into full swing, so it was hard to find a time to hang out with Ron and Hermione. I hate being a third-wheel to them. I've grow to understand that if we don't have free time that I should just let them be when we finally do.
I was jostled awake by Ron, who was already in his robes with Hermione walking out the door. I quickly through my robes and tie on, not caring if they looked messy. We left the train and headed to the carriages. Neville joined us, but Luna stayed with Ginny. I wondered if she knew? They were best friends so I assumed she had told Luna something more than her brother. The three of them talked while I just looked over at the creatures pulling the carts. I remember being stunned back in fifth year, now they seemed comforting. I was used to them so others might not agree, but they gave me a sense of hope that even death can bring forth beautiful things you hadn't seen before.
Draco didn't seem upset. I had snuck up behind him and he was more amused than anything. I let go after a few minutes.
I didn't realize he was paying attention to my sleep schedule, not like it mattered when I got back.
"I-" she gulped nervously, "I did. Oh, Harry, I'm so sorry." She turned to leave, but I caught her wrist.
Wait a minute... that sounds familiar. Were Malfoy and I really that much alike? I guess I had never put much thought into it. Maybe I should have been nicer all those years? Then again, he didn't really make me want to. Why did I care? Did I--?
He gawked at it and then noticed the two patches of white fur on the tattoo lion and almost began to bash his head against the wall. One patch was on the beastâs head and shaped like a bolt of lightning, the other was a starburst shape on the creatureâs chest. Two killing curses.
A brief pain flashed behind his eyes and he quickened his pace to the infirmary and collided with a very frantic Potter, falling back onto the floor.
He had to be missing something, because right now those little pieces were all starting come together and those pieces seemed to lead to Harry Potter, or at least someone in the Eighth Year. After all, he had left his book about soulmates in the common room and now it was gone, so obviously someone found it useful or more likely one of his book-mad peers (Ravenclaws, cough, cough, Granger) had taken it for extra reading. âOr Potterâ his mind supplied; he sighed.
He leaps around the corner hoping to lose them in the Hogâs Head and curses his own stupidity. How could he had been so daft as to leave without his cloak?! McGonagall had been quite clear about what could happen if Harry decided to return to Hogwarts for âeighth yearâ but he decided he could handle the masses as long as he scored well on his Newts. When McGonagall had realized his mind was set, she told him that it would be a good idea to keep his invisibility cloak with him at all times in case he needed to make a quick getaway.  Harry now realized the flaw in his brilliant idea of going to Hogsmeade when he assumed it would be safe without his cloak.
Harry doesnât realize he has his robes balled up in his clenched fists until he hears a quiet little cough from Draco beside him and is snapped back to reality.
Draco slides his fingers between Harryâs and speaks so quietly that if one wasnât listening they couldâve missed it, âYou know, Iâve wanted to that for a while.â, the passion was obvious in his voice, if not even a little shy in a way.
He steps out of the spray, cuts the shower off, grabs a towel out of his bag and frantically dries off then pulls on a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt. He glances down at his ankles and curses; he would have to wear socks to bed, which was something he usually didnât do because it feels like sweaty hell when he does it. He hastily pulls on a pair of socks thinking âfuck it!â then brushes his teeth in record time and shoves his glasses on.
He was so enchanted by the changes to his tattoos that he didnât notice how they had spread down the sides of his legs at first. As he looked he noticed the thin lines of plants and dimly flickering trails of fire that stretched all the way down to his ankles, slowly curling outwards and growing as he watched.
Without thinking he rubs the sore spot on his forearm right over where his dark mark is. After the mysterious gouge appeared it had almost instantly healed itself, but to him it still felt like it was there, still taunting him. He had read about soulmates sharing wounds in âSoul Binding Magicsâ (from the restricted section of Hogwartsâ library) and he hadnât inflicted the wound upon himself, so Harry must done it. He glared at the back of Harryâs head, eyes flitting over his damp curls of hair, stupid git; he was harming himself and Draco couldnât do anything about it without revealing himself.
As Draco begins to shuck off his robes he hears Harry behind him, âIâm sorry you know, about what I said. I didnât -I didnât mean to upset you like that.â
Harryâs hand seems to move on itâs own, he watches his tattoo covered hand reach down, with trepidation, with the slightest tremor, to brush the hair away from Dracoâs forehead. The tattoos burst into color around the places where his hand barely touched his skin and then spread outward in a ring, leaving pale, unmarked skin behind it. It was like watching a piece of paper burn from the center out; color, then nothing. It was as if his touch was dissolving the film of magical tattoos covering Draco, but it was only so effective. It stopped working once it reached his eyebrows, leaving the rest of his face covered in swirling colorful storms, mutlicolored trails of water, and patches of ice.
A cautious smile flickers on Harryâs face and Dracoâs mouth slightly turns up at the sides in response. Draco opens his book from where he left off then carefully takes his off shoes and props his legs up next to Harryâs. Harry squirms about, squemishly, but doesnât move, before returning to his magazine, his glances flitting back to Draco regularly.
He trudged into the shared dormitory and opened the chest sitting at the foot of his bed and removed his cloak, remembering how stupid heâd been to not carry it.
Every part of his skin had to be covered in tattoos, because his neck and face were absolutely swirling with them. The storms swirled around his exposed jawbone and over his eyelids, the jagged ice lined his eyes, his jaw, his brow bone. Lightning flickered seemingly from within, casting strange shadows on his face. Everything was thrashing and storming voilently all other his skin, twin trails of tattoo water streaming from his eyes down his face, continuing until it dissapeared beneath his shirt collar.
Harry feels a searing pain behind his eyes and winces, before noticing Dracoâs quick effiecient stride as he leaves the great hall. Harry feels small pinpricks running down his arms and his stomach flips.
Draco felt clueless. He felt like he had all of the pieces of the puzzle he was trying to solve, but just couldnât fit them together properly and didnât have any picture or clues to guide him. All Draco had were heaping multitudes of blank and broken pieces and if he couldnât fit them together soon he was going to start forcing them into place and shoving them in places where they didnât fit or belong.
Malfoyâs look suddenly became caged as he fiddled with his shirt sleeves and collar, which were tightly buttoned up as far as possible and said in a clipped voice, âThatâs strange.â
Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy look disappointed? He snorts âI dress strange? You need a mirror.â
After a few beats, Granger tentativly says, âWould you like to do research with me in library? Iâm sure we could find more information.â
Draco doesnât turn to face him and instead just sighs and carefully folds his robes before replying, âApology accepted, Potter, although Iâm sure that the copious amounts of staring in transfigurations was enough to tell me.â
Also, Dean and Seamus had set the boys dormitory on fire again, so they would all be split up into separate rooms with one other person who would, supposedly, cause them the least trouble as their roommate for the rest of the year and each person was handpicked by McGonagall.
Draco cuts her off, âGranger, seeing as how both of those options are terrible, couldnât I just be his friend for the time being or literally anything else with him other than romantically involved? I mean, all the spell requires is contact of some kind or at least companionship to keep it from worsening.â
Dracoâs cheeks go pink and he pulls at the collar of his robes, Harry didnât care about him, did he? Granger glances between Harry, who is still glancing (cough, STARING) at him and Draco who knows the tips of his ears are probably bright red right now, despite the cold, and nods to herself. FUCKING NODS, like its okay and normal for the golden boy and a former death-eater to be exchanging heart-felt glances.
Harry sputtered for a moment and Malfoy gave him a confused look before Harry finally managed to get out, âHave you seen Ron and Hermione?â
Feeling rather silly, Harry nervously holds out a finger and tickles the sensitive skin where the dragon lays and immediately its sharp, grey eyes snap open, revealing them to be surprisingly human. He feels as if he should recognize them, and vaguely does, just not well enough to identify them. The dragon then elegantly leaps to its feet, tearing the vines away and begins to breathe fire down the length of his spine. Harry lets out a yelp of surprise as what can only be described as a trail of boiling water blazes on his skin. Wincing, he chances a glance back at the dragon only to find it higher up on his back, nestled between his shoulder blades with itâs wings proudly flared, their tips barely brushing his ends of his shoulders. Was it just his imagination, or was it bigger now? Maybe it just looked bigger because itâs wings were spread. As the dragon went back to sleep he noticed the trail of vines and flames in its wake, which didnât seem to disappear and danced slowly as they undulated in waves, like lapping water. He stared at the trail of tattoos running down his spine for what seemed like hours before sighing and leaving the bathroom.
Draco stops running his hand down the side of Harryâs cheek and stares at him, uncertainty dancing in his eyes for a fraction of a second, before a gentle nod is given.
Malfoyâs face hardens and he snarls, âItâs none of your business why I do things and why do you care all of a sudden?â Draco evilly smirks, âitâs almost as if you want to see as much of me as you can.â
He carefully examines it once more in the light and as he does the small wound miraculously closes leaving little beads of blood in a straight, uniform line. Harry blinks, he must be going mad, or had just cast a wordless, wandless, healing spell. He gives himself a shake, it didnât matter, he had more important things to worry about, like his grades and this stupid soulmate curse. Wordlessly, he casts a cleaning spell on his thumb and the jar before strolling back to his work station where Malfoy was cradling his hand and holding his wand in the other.
Ron stepped forward, âLook why donât we just check? That way we can see if any harmâs been done and if not we can leave him alone. I doubt thereâs anything there at all. â
Granger looks sheepishly at the ground, âWell, yes, but the tattoo is reactive to the proximitive state between a pair of soulmates, while any other effects purely rely on emotional health as well as any other thoughts and feelings towards the partner.â
Potionâs class wasnât all that bad, Harry was actual pretty good at potions and always got decent marks on everything, itâs just that he didnât really have a passion for it, or really appreciate Malfoy jabbering away about how he was messing up their potion by not following the instructions to a tee.
Draco glances down at his forearm and sighs, it wasnât like he himself could scold Harry. Draco shivers, equal parts from the cold and revulsion over himself, the things he has done to himself and others.
She just sighs, âThen you know how important it is to just tell him or if youâre not interested in him just kiss him one day out of the blue and pretend this never happened. Although if you kiss him right now he is likely to hex you or punch you or-â
Dracoâs headache grew worse as he left the potionâs classroom and it didnât seem to get better after a dull hour of arithmancy, if anything it grew worse. Of course, Draco ignored it, and went to the library to research soulmate curses, but when he left, it grew so painful that he began to walk to the infirmary.
Granger shoots him a distrustful glance and whispers something to the blissfully oblivious Weasley, who barely turns to scowl at him.
He scrambled to his feet and dashed off to the infirmary, not noticing how his headache had subsided.
Harry frowns and turns back to his bags, unpacking his things and gathering his shower items, âWell, I wonât cause problems as long as you agree not to as well.â
He braces himself and steps in front of the mirror then almost stumbles back into the shower at the thing on his chest.
Harry is hit with a tantalizing, strong citrus scent as soon as Malfoy stops staring at Harryâs hands and face, his face contorted in an angry, pissed off scowl, but his eyes filled with a paralyzing fear. Malfoyâs glare moves back down to Harryâs hands, âHow did you manage to injure yourself in your sleep, Potter!â He spat. The malice on his face makes Harry internally cringe and his insides wither up a bit. The hovering cloud of thought seemed to resemble a brewing storm, with anger, envy, fear, and a touch of admiration all swirling into a coalescing mass of emotion, too overwhelming to attempt to handle.
Even if Draco didnât have a tattoo, he had to at least be thinking about what had happened outside of the bathroom.
Harry gives his tattoo one last withering look before he pulls on a long sleeved shirt; with only one roommate and bathroom it would be much harder to hide his tattoo. And most of all, he hoped his new roommate was someone he could get along with like Ron, but McGonagall made it clear that it was unlikely for friends to be paired and to not hope for it. He sighed again, levitating his bags and walking to his new room.
He gathers up his school robes over one arm and wrenches open the door to an impatient Malfoy who immediately scrunches up his nose. His gaze slides to Harryâs wet hair then back to Harryâs eyes. Malfoy arches a brow and the corners of his lips barely move up, âPotter, are you going to move and let me shower or are you going to stand there dripping all over the carpets?â
âI, uh, no, umâ¦ I donât know. I just woke up with my hands burning so I healed them, I just have to keep them wrapped until the scars go away.â
Draco stares at the floor, this may be his free period, but he sure wasnât going to spend it with Granger in the stuffy library, âNo, Granger Iâm busy enough as it is and Iâve been told that unless I want to die of embarressment, humiliation, or by terrible tattoo, that I should immediately cuddle up to our saviour Harry Fucking Potter. So, goodbye.â
Malfoy seems to stand in a sort of stupor before throwing his hands up in exasperation, âWhatever, just remember itâs both of our grades.â
Draco winces at the words âsoulmateâ and âpartnerâ but says nothing which causes the silence to ramble on.
Harry screws his eyes together and tries to stop himself from thinking about it, about the look on Dracoâs face, the rejection, the humiliation. How could Harry had been so stupid! Why couldnât he had just put on his clothes and left the bathroom, and pretended to not have the stupid soulmate tattoo! He had been so fucking stupid and careless!
Draco had no clue what was happening, and it terrified him to think that something was out of his control again.
Draco smiled into his pillow and tugged up the high collar of his pajamas and begun to dream of lions and bright, green eyes.
Harry stops for a moment and sighs, âYeah, probably, but the flame would have to be hot enough to boil the dragonâs blood and the mermaid tears also have to be above a certain temperature, so they donât negatively react with the fire beetle, so...â
Draco just stares at her, sincerely dumbfounded, just beginning to realize that either she really was the brightest witch of her age or maybe he had just been an utter fool this entire time.
Of course Draco couldnât be sure, he couldâve been seeing things, dreaming about the encounter, imagining it, but he really couldnât be sure until tomorrow in potions. He scowled, Slughorn had partnered him up with Potter for the entire year, most likely to keep an eye on him. He wouldâve taken the chance to gladly ruin all of Potterâs potions, but Slughorn always had partnered brewing classes, so if Draco fucked up Potterâs potion, he would also be ruining his own grade, which he couldnât afford. But every steamy potions class Potter would take off his outer robes, exposing his t-shirt underneath, not that Draco paid attention to what Potter wore or thought about what was under his robes. Nope, never! Anyways, he would be able to see if he still had the tattoo and then he would probably overhear something from Granger (she could never keep her mouth shut) and voila! he would have this worthless thing gone and be able to get on with life.
