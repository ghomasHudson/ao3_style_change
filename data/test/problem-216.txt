Malfoy lets out a gasp, sounding scandalised, hand against his chest adding to the whole old lady grabbing at her pearls thing he’s so obviously going for.
“Oh fuck, fuck,” Draco moans when Harry moves against his sweet spot, back arched, legs tightening around Harry’s waist. “There,
Arousal starts to pool just below his abdomen, sending a shiver of want right through him. “No,” he says, voice low.
“I want you,” Harry tells him. “Even like this, I want –”
“What?”
“Do you see, mother?” Malfoy whimpers, lower lip trembling. “Look what he’s done.” Malfoy’s voice cracks. "How he treats me."
“More,” he whines, biting his lip.
You got a lot of questions for someone who's just "curious" Harry.
Malfoy brings the spliff between his fingers up to his mouth, inhales. “That just might be the most intelligent thing I’ve ever heard you say, Potter,” he says before exhaling. Harry’s eyes watch Malfoy’s lips form the words — feels something warm in his chest at the sound of them.
Harry swallowed his rabbit-heartbeat and didn’t say anything for a long while.
he pulls out of her grasp with a furious tug of his own arm and walks out of Ron’s room and into his own.
“He already does.” Harry’s throat burns.
The front door unlocks, the familiar echo of Pansy’s rattling keychain the only sound between them. Draco turns, Pansy stands with a pack of Heineken in hand, smiling sheepishly at Draco. Her maroon lipstick makes her look more mischievous than she truly is.
“I think they’re sussing me out,” Neville had said, trying on his third button down.
He wants to do so badly, and so he pushes Draco down and does just that.
Harry inhales sharply, shaking his head lightly. “You’re both off your nut.”
So yeah. Sorry or whatever.
“Who was your first?” Harry asks, only once does he dare.
. Draco wants the truth. Draco wants honesty – but he does not know how to ask for it, does not know if he will like it when he gets it, if he gets it.
“Yeah?”
Draco tilts his head and Harry takes a breath. How can he ask a simple question when there are layers upon layers of complicated history between them, he wonders, settling on: “Were you okay?”
Draco licks his lips. “I got an ‘Exceed Expectations’ on my Muggle Studies Exam.”
“When I was a boy,” he begins, working his throat, eyes turned towards the wooden ceiling of Grimmauld Place. “About three.” He takes a deep breath. “I was…” He nods his head, swallowing again. “My uncle, would –”
Oh how the tables have tabled....
“Right,” Malfoy scoffs, throwing back the duvet. “Come on, Potter, fancy a smoke?” Leaning down Malfoy goes to grab at his little tin box fit with his pre-rolled spliffs and a lighter.
Harry is sitting with his friends drinking, engaging in a game of Wizard’s Cup — a game where you have to take a dare or take a drink of a spiked Pepper Up potion mixed in with a sample of whatever everyone’s drinking — when he notices Draco and his friends have joined the festivities from the corner of his eye.
“They never say what they mean, Nev. Just hold your own and you’ll be fine.”
“She always sang this silly song when it rained, her mother would sing it to her.”
Fuck, I want to, please fuck.” Harry’s blubbering but he feels like he might cry if something doesn’t happen between them. Fuck, Malfoy — Draco, his mind supplies, is tugging at Harry’s hair just the way he likes, not that he knew he liked that, but he does now. He likes it a lot, actually.
Dawn is creeping in, the soft golden hue licking against his chilled skin.
Harry hovers over Draco, leaning down to kiss him, pulling away to line his cock to Draco’s pink hole. Draco, with shaky fingers, grabs hold of Harry and together they put the tip of Harry’s cock on his rim, both groaning as Harry begins his gentle glide into the tight-wet heat of his body.
“Are you mad at him?”
Back in their dorm, they eat treacle tart and chips dipped in ice cream and smoke another spliff, sharing this one instead.
Oh, wow. That’s great news. Incredible even.
Draco jerks back as though burned.
The alcohol has Harry feeling loose enough to unashamedly admit: “If I was drunker and, in a club, I’d most definitely try and pick you up.” The thing with Slytherins, Harry’s realising, is they’re a bit cruel but they also don’t take a lot seriously if Parkinson’s hearty laughter is anything to go by.
Draco attempts to grab at something under his bed, he’s struggling to reach it because Harry won’t let him go, kissing and sucking and touching and rutting against him. “Just give me
“I can feel you looking at me.” Malfoy’s eyes stay closed, his cheeks turn pink.
“To know that even though it makes me sick, I keep coming back for more. Do you like it?”
CW: suicide mention
“Mr. Potter, please take a seat.”
Harry doesn’t know what the fuck that means, but he’s tired and really doesn’t care enough to start a row about it. Instead, he smokes his cigarette, watches Malfoy from the corner of his eye, and lets the nicotine soothe his senses.
Draco lets out a sharp breath, one that Harry knows is followed by the ghost of a smile, a quirk of Draco’s he’s becoming quite familiar with.
“Fuck off.” Harry slaps her hand away from him. “Why would you even think that?”
Harry rises to his feet. “Tea?”
“He would touch me,” says Draco, tears swelling in his eyes. He blinks them away, taking in a short breath. “He told me that it was okay, because I was his nephew. I could trust him because he was my uncle.” Draco clenches the hand that sits idly on the wooden table into a fist.
Harry’s lip twitches. “No, please. Do go on.”
“I wish you were coming. I mean even Malfoy’s coming, and you two are,” Neville had paused at his mention of Draco. “Well, and he’s going to be judging me the hardest considering they used to sleep together.”
Harry gasps out, “Harder, please.” And Draco goes deeper, quickens his pace, finding a rhythm that has Harry’s senses on overdrive.
He wants to taste himself inside the other man, to touch Draco's come filled arse, to feel up and down his shaking body.
The worry seeps out of him when he opens the door and sees them, sitting on Draco’s bed, cross-legged over the duvet with wide dopey smiles splayed on their faces that only falter when they see him at the door.
Yeah. It sounds like a really good idea.
“That’s awful, Harry. You two shouldn’t be fighting.” Hermione is walking towards him, from her place on the couch by the fire. Ron’s still sitting next to the spot she’d occupied, and it seems like she’s still trying to bridge the gap between them.
“Why shouldn’t I?”
“Is it fair
“Darling, you’re ethereal.”
“What? Now you’re taking his side?”
Harry wants to sleep but doesn’t know if he can because he’s most definitely coming down from his high, and it’s weird settling into sobriety, but Draco tells him to close his eyes even if he isn’t planning on sleeping and just relax.
“Get these bloody trousers off me,” Draco drawls, moving to bite down on Harry’s shoulder, to lick up his neck, to suck his own mark in Harry’s bronze skin.
“Yes,” says Draco, voice deep and rough. Harry bites at his lower lip, moving his hands. One finds purchase against Draco’s chest and the other moves towards Draco’s hip. They’re so close now, Harry’s mere centimetres away from Draco’s sweet looking lips.
Pansy’s deep red lip curls into a sinister smirk. “Right, right, of course not. Anyway, care for a shot?”
“Mrs. Malfoy, need I remind you that your son has still broken the rules of his probation."
Harry leaves to fetch Draco some water from the downstairs kitchen tap, before remembering that Hermione had gotten him a Brita filter weeks ago and had been nagging Harry to use it more often, citing
They switch positions, Harry on his back, Draco straddling his hips, moving with leisure, Draco grinding down onto him slowly. Draco spreads his hands on Harry’s pecs, sliding them down, teasing his nipples, moving his hips, meeting Harry’s arousal with his own – Harry lets out a gasp at the feeling of Draco’s thick cock pressed against his, moving his hands onto Draco’s thighs, squeezing them gently.
“Concentrated Pixie Dust,” Draco explains, hand still on Harry. He starts rubbing against Harry’s scar with soothing little strokes that help Harry settle down on the bed next to him with ease. “You don’t have to, it’s just – it’s the new year and this is a bit of a tradition for me and Pans, you see.”
Everyday Harry wakes up in what feels like a bubble of warmth, joy, and something softer, sweeter than Harry’s ever had the pleasure of enjoying freely.
“What did you say to Luna when she said she was finally ready to talk?”
Harry shrugs. None of his friends had thought to ask him that, hell, even Harry hadn’t thought to ask himself that. It’s what was expected of him, what he expected of himself even.
Harry scoffs. “You’ve got to be fucking joking.”
They smoke in relative silence and Harry lets his mind wander back to his friends. His pulse quickens and suddenly everything is off-kilter and weird, this whole situation is fucking weird, him and Malfoy being able to share a relatively peaceful silence is weird. Where did their animosity go, did it just ooze out of them after suffering through a trauma-packed war?
, filling with the type of heat that makes you sweat in the back of your knees and suffocates the room. People are taking off their robes, Draco’s tied back his hair, his cheeks glisten with sweat that highlights his sharp cheekbones.
“Yeah.”
God, I hope today is over soon. I’m expected to be at the ministry for some stupid memorial service and then I’m expected to be at some stupid fucking gala and event and it’s going to be a month of shaking hands and meeting nameless faces and the entire wizarding world looking forward to meeting their boy wonder, saviour of the bloody Wizarding world but I don’t want to be doing any of this.
They had talked a bit, about this and that and all the minuscule things that Harry couldn’t remember, because they didn’t matter. Draco hadn’t wanted to talk about anything serious, so instead he’d talked about whatever came to mind — telling pointless stories that made them both laugh.
It becomes a regular part of their routine after that, they’ll smoke and then they’ll fuck, or they’ll fuck and then smoke — either is fine and there’s really no rush.
Pansy Parkinson is in his room, he hears her shrill laughter before he sees her pug-face and Harry’s already surrounded by an air of annoyance before Parkinson’s eyes land on Harry, who’s watching her from the door. She’s sat in Harry’s usual spot, Firewhiskey bottle in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Harry wants to push her off, tell her to take the floor. Instead, he dumps his books on the floor, shrugs off his school robes and undoes his tie.
Harry’s head is thick with honey and lust and cotton, and he wants so badly to be inside Draco, needs to feel it right now.
“Can we talk about something else now?”
“It turns me on so much.”
I'm still trynna get my life together, but thank you to all those who have been patiently waiting for this story <3
Harry feels so relaxed and comfortable that he doesn’t want Draco to slip out of him and holds him in place until Draco says, “Come on, Potter, let me clean you up, yes?” Draco’s brushing the hair that’s sticking to his sweaty forehead out of Harry’s face and it’s so nice that Harry finally lets his legs fall down. Draco slips out of him, and Harry can’t help but mourn the loss.
Slowly, with more care than he was expecting, Draco begins to thrust into him. He’s oiled up his cock and it’s not an uncomfortable burning sensation, but it does burn, and it does leave Harry feeling stretched — only the heat inside him is quickly reaching a fever pitch, and his breath is coming out ragged as he focuses on his breathing with a tight grip on Draco’s biceps.
“People think he’s getting high,” Ron says, coming over to them. “Not just on weed. They think he’s been hitting the hard stuff.” His voice is low, hands on the table and looking around him as he addresses the crowd.
Hope.
Malfoy moves his hands now too, both moving underneath Harry’s jumper — one going to slither up his back and the other slowly inching up from his abdomen to his chest, running his hands through Harry’s chest hair before slowly brushing against Harry’s pert nipple, making them both gasp at the sensation. “Hot,” Draco swallows and licks his lips. “You’re so intense.”
Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s hand.
“No, no,” Harry pulls further away. “Don’t be. It’s...fine,” he lies.
“I love you,” Draco keens. “Fuck, I do. I love you. Fuck.”
Harry shrugs. “So?”
“Draco, no.”
Malfoy giggles a bit. “Who’s Jesus?”
Harry tries to take off Draco’s jumper, needing to feel skin on skin. He feels like he might die if he doesn’t. Draco tenses and hesitates, “Please,” Harry pleads, and Draco relents.
Draco,
“You don’t want to?” Draco croaks.
, on repeat.
“You turn me on so much,” Harry tells him.
“I don't want to sleep with anyone but you.”
Bestie........
Harry’s a breadth away now, when he got so close Draco had no clue. All he knows is that he is shaking with the desire to touch, to taste, for something he has longed for half his life, in one form or the other.
“Why?”
boy! Unlike your Death Eater son, who he should have left to rot in Azkaban instead of speaking for you and him at your respective trials.” Molly says, standing as well. “Especially considering this is how you’re choosing to repay him.”
, he commands in his posh drawl,
“No, no it’s –” Harry doesn’t know what to say, and he pauses in search of the right words like a man lost at sea. “Are you alright?”
I didn’t realise that happened to you. I sometimes saw into Voldemort’s mind, back then. Just another fucked up war memory. Anyway, I saw him forcing you to torture Rowe once. I’m sure he did that to play some kind of fucked up mind game.
“You always looked like a kneazle caught in wand crossfire, but that bloke he – he was just weird, weird and mean about it, I guess.”
He lights candles in his bedroom, enchants them to float around the canopy of his bed, lays rose petals across his white sheets and feels foolish as he does so, just a bit, wondering if it’s too much. His heart is full, and he feels turned inside out. Love, what a curious thing. Tender, like a wound. Precious, like hope.
“Please, baby. Please,” Harry says, and he knows he’s asking for so much right now. Knows that his request is complex, heavy, confusing. He tries to find the words to express all that he’s asking for, but they stay in the haze of his mind, swirling around and taunting him.
Being high on acid is like being high on weed, but so much better. Harry’s brain is tingling, things are not necessarily moving, but they are sort of, well, every time he blinks there’s these geometric shapes that appear in his mind’s eye which he finds to be pretty fucking cool — sometimes he can see them with his eyes open, and the world looks brighter because of it.
Yeah, I’ve been with a few blokes and know a thing or two about having sex with one. It depends on what you think you’ll like and what you’re open to trying. I’ve sent along a book Hermione gave me when I came out to her. I don’t think I ever told you, but I came out to her and Ron a while back. They were super supportive, it was such a relief. Ginny is the only other person I’m out to, and eventually I plan to tell the rest of the Weasley family but for now, there’s this. It's a really nice feeling being supported by people you love. I’m so grateful to have them.
“Then what’s with the fucking third degree?”
Harry turns his body towards Draco fully now, one arm spreading across the backrest while the other moves to squeeze the foot Draco has laid against his thigh. “Yes?” He says, because to Harry it feels rather obvious, especially now – the dinners, the cooking together, the movies afterwards.
Draco’s lip twitches, he lets out a sweet breath, cheeks turning the sweetest shade of red. He looks away but doesn’t try to hide his face. “You,” he begins, finger trailing up Harry’s forearm, outlining patterns on his bicep. “You’re quite handsome.”
Oh boy, you are in for a treat. Tom Marvolo Riddle AKA the Dark Lord AKA Voldemort (sorry if seeing his name bothers you, but I hope you don’t mind me adding it for effect) is a half-blood. Not only is he a half-blood, his father was a Muggle.
“Babes, there’s someone looking for you up front,” Cheryl says, through bites of her blueberry scone.
The first time Draco spends the night, it’s a planned thing, not that Harry had realised it at first. Draco comes through the Floo, brushing soot off his light-green jumper, chucking off his oxfords and padding around in his snitch-embroidered socks.
Harry’s eyes are still on him when he accepts the spliff from Malfoy’s long fingers, taking a drag as Malfoy’s light eyes watch him, glowing under the moonlight’s white glimmer that seeps in through their window.
“He would do this until I was about five,” Draco says, finally looking at Harry. “The mind is a funny thing,” he says, with his index finger pointed like a gun at his temple. “It’ll hide what you don’t want to see.” He shudders. “The body though, the body never forgets.” Draco’s voice cracks as he says, “The body keeps score,” tears finally spilling over sharp cheekbones.
. Harry whines because,
“Only if you meant it,” Harry huffs.
I had to learn a lot about him, Dumbledore wanted to be sure I was prepared to face him when the time came. Something about knowing your enemy and all that other Hippogriffshit. So, yeah, that’s how I know about that.
“I have,” Harry begins, trying to breathe through the way his bedroom spins.  “I have a sober-up potion.”
“Who gets to decide who’s worthy of forgiveness anyway?”
Ron is a Pisces and not afraid to read a bitch.
“My Uncle Rodolphus would play this game with me.” Draco breathes in deeply. “We would play this game called Healer.”
Hermione is behind him. “We’re here, Harry,” she says. “We’re here.”
“I didn’t even say I wasn’t going. I said I was thinking about it.” Harry grunts out, frustration and exhaustion present in his tone and stance, shoulders dipped forward with resent.
Draco glares at him. “And when did we start dating?”
Draco lays his head against Harry’s, handing him the spliff and moving his hand to the top of Harry’s thigh, rubbing soft circles with his thumb. “You’re too obvious.”
Draco takes her hand, interlocks their fingers. Here, in her hand, in her smile, he feels loved.
"I— I can't do this," Malfoy says, face twisting and unsure. "I'm... sorry?" he says like a question with no answer.
Theo stops chopping the pepper, the muscle in his jaw works. Draco moves towards him, leans his head against his friend. Their temples touch.
The first time Harry wonders what Draco tastes like, its fifth year and they’re in their summer uniforms, the sun scorching down on them as they all convene in the courtyard. Everyone’s wearing short sleeved white dress shirts, robes long discarded. The Slytherins, usually prim and proper, have even joined in the disrobing and all sit near each other, practicing cooling charms when they should be preparing for the last bit of their OWLS. Harry himself sits with his shirt open, undershirt untucked, cool drink in hand. Hermione, next to him, coily hair tied into two messy buns, quizzes Ron on Magical History.
Harry sits on the windowsill, knees pulled up to his chest as he lays his back against the cobblestone and smokes a cigarette. He’s waiting for Draco to come into their room, and he hates that he’s waiting for him at all. He wants Draco with him, here, now, but Draco’s fucked off to some club event that Pansy’s dragged him and his friends to. The only reason he knows is because Neville mentioned that he’d been invited to hang out with the Slytherins, per Theo’s request.
Harry has his arms wrapped around Draco’s neck, has been moving his arms up and down his back, clawing at it whenever Draco teased against the sensitive spots on his neck and chest and inside him.
–” Harry grinds against him, finger teasing his entrance. “There’s a spell, just,
Theo and Draco are like....really good friends, ok?
Harry shrugs, unsure of what to say. “Do your friends give you any shit because we’ve been smoking together?”
“I want –” Draco swallows, licking his lips. “I…”
baby.”
Harry is practically leaned completely against Draco when it’s finally his turn to hit the acid-pop sugar, which Harry learns is the street name for the drug from an enthused looking Blaise. Harry shifts, mourning the loss of contact, but is soothed by Draco’s return to his side — Draco’s leaning more into him now, and the heat of his body makes Harry’s fingers twitch with the desire to touch.
P.S. Sorry for dumping all this on you.
“What the actual fuck?” Harry’s heart clenches, lump forming in his throat as he looks towards Draco who still hasn’t fucking looked at him.
“I don’t deserve him.” Draco’s voice is barely above a whisper.
Harry’s fist clenches. Theo huffs out something between a scoff and a laugh. “You’ve gone and replaced me too.”
Malfoy lifts up his shoulder. “Court mandated,” his tone is casual, like it’s the simplest thing in the world — him being a war criminal, that is.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Malfoy came to find him the way he always did, something in Harry’s chest had rattled, and the decaying bits of the monster in his chest had chanted:
Back in his room, Harry opens the door to Malfoy already sitting by the window. The blond man turns to him and asks, “What’s the matter with you?”
“Hey,” Harry croaks.
Malfoy tilts back his head and laughs, exposing his long milky-white neck. “Ask him, he’ll tell you. He’s got the best shit in school, charges me double for it mind you, but when you’re as rich as I am who gives a flying fuck?”
Yeah, you read that right.
“Only when you deserve it,” Draco says, twirling his wrist, spinning the wine in his hand around in its glass.
Hermione has rarely ever done just that, she is always in motion, but sometimes it feels just like running. Sometimes it feels like she keeps it moving, so that she doesn’t have to sit in everything that weighs down on her chest like a ten-ton boulder.
“Mr. Potter, if you know of anything, it’s imperative you let us know,” McGonagall says, hands linked atop her desk. There’s a clock ticking from somewhere inside her office. Dumbledore is noticeably absent from his portrait; Harry can’t stop looking at it. “Mr. Malfoy has been sighted as tardy to almost all of his classes, he’s been noted as behaving irrationally, irresponsibly, and he is suspected to have broken the terms of his probation by engaging in the use of drugs and other narcotics.” She sounds exasperated as she lists every little thing on her wrinkled fingers.
Do you think you’ll ever go to one?
“Touch yourself,” Harry tells him, as he grabs tightly onto Draco’s hips. He hopes Draco will have his hands printed onto his skin tomorrow, will have Harry’s mark all over him.
Harry lifts the red cover, revealing an assortment of chocolates. He picks up a caramel-peanut butter heart shaped piece and holds it between his fingers out towards Draco. The other man, grey eyes glittering in the warmth of the room between them, wraps his fingers around Harry’s wrist, pulling his hand towards his lips, letting Harry place the piece of chocolate in his mouth. “Mm, this is good,” says Draco, chewing on the sweet treat, sucking Harry’s thumb into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it.
“Right.” Malfoy says, and there is so much finality in that one syllable that Harry can only close his mouth and stare. The other man moves to right himself, pulling on his pants and jumper. He walks towards the small blue tiled bathroom, closing the door gently behind him.
, Harry thinks, Draco is the sweetest shade of red and looks so good he wants to devour him. Wants to taste and to touch and to
“What if I never want to have sex again? Will you want me then?”
“Oh,” Harry said, licking his lips. His throat felt thick with something, his heart pattered in his chest — reminding him that he was alive, that he felt something. It was a complicated something. “What about that silence bit?”
Ginny says she appreciates your apology. She slept over last night and saw your letter. I was worried she’d be weird about it but then she told me she’s been speaking to Blaise Zabini of all people! Apparently his mother co-owns the Holyhead Harpies now? Who knew! They’re recruiting reserve players and Ginny’s up for a spot, she’s been kicking some serious arse this season at Hogwarts.
1. Draco has a wishlist (think of it being like one of those Amazon ones) and people can add to it/send him stuff on it - obvi while still protecting his privacy.
Then, get this, I think I’ve found this bloke that I might actually like and like an idiot I think I might actually be worth something to someone. But everyone wants a piece of the great Harry Potter, and no one ever just wants Harry.
“I hurt him worse and all because I –” Draco cuts himself off. His heartbeat feels loud against his throat, and he feels sick suddenly. Sick with the truth, sick with want, sick from a desire he has hated himself for. A desire he has lied to himself about. A desire he dares not hope for, not now. Especially not now.
“The first time.” Draco wraps his arms around himself. “I don’t like it when you're drunk.”
Draco puts another finger inside him, stretching him open and Harry feels like his body loosen with the pleasure of it and tighten with the arousal of it and it’s paradoxical but it’s good, so good.
Harry wants to kiss him, wants to slide their tongues together, wants to feel the hot puff of his breath against his face, but Draco’s looked away – and Harry’s heart skips too many beats that by the time he’s regained his composure Harry’s been dragged to the bar for another round of shots and Draco’s saying his goodbyes.
“Just, come
Anyway, what’s that advice about Blaise? Ginny says she’s interested to hear it. She also says Blaise told her that he misses you, thinks of you often. Would you want me to give him your address? Maybe he can write to you too?
“With whom can you sit in water?” Draco mumbled, phone screen illuminating his tired face. “With whom can you sit in silence?”
the sight of Draco on top of him, riding him, rutting into the fist Harry has on his furious cock is almost too much, but Harry doesn’t want to forget what the first time looks like – is enjoying the feeling too much to tear his eyes away. He blinks rapidly, pounds into the other man harder, uses a possessively tight grip on Draco’s hip to steady himself when he feels himself go frantic with the need for release.
3. Harry isn't vegan, he's just trying it out, it's not really that big of a deal.
Draco stills suddenly, and his hands slide to his side, body trembling. Harry feels a wetness drip onto his skin, his mind registering distantly that Draco is crying – causing something in Harry’s chest to ache at the sound of Draco pulling in a short breath.
Harry fingers him slowly and Draco thrusts down onto his finger, keening with an enthusiasm Harry had never seen before. “More,” Draco orders. “Fuck, please.”
Yes, they are still some of the most intense people he has ever had the (dis)pleasure of knowing.
“Did I finally disgust you? Were you finally sick with yourself –”
“Please.”
“Yes.” Hermione laughs, it’s a soft and quiet thing. “I was so convinced that all I needed to do was make a timetable and follow a 12-step plan toward healing.”
Harry’s heart has sent his throat a lump and it burns as he tries, and fails, to swallow it down.
At night he remembers their fucking with a fondness one might assign to a night of love making, but then the image always shifts to Draco’s wide eyes, the tears that bleed down his sharp cheekbones, that remind him of ice pebbles against porcelain skin.
“Oh fuck,” Draco whimpers, licking his lips and swallowing hard. “Yes,
Malfoy just shakes his head at her, biting back his smile as he takes a spliff from his pocket, putting it to his mouth, and lighting it. Harry watches him with hazy vision, the whiskey smoothing out his senses.
Harry swallows. “Maybe a little,” he says. It’s easier to explain away the gooseflesh that spreads across his skin on the cool air that circulates his home.
“I wish I could have been the one to kill the man who did this to you,” Draco says, candlelight reflecting in his dark eyes, opening him up in a way Harry has never seen before.
“Yeah,” Harry says, slipping out of Draco and cleaning them up wandlessly.
Harry's a bit of a messy bitch, but like - not in a mean way, in a like a fuuuun way 😋
McGonagall sighs. "Considering the circumstances, I’m willing to overlook this transgression and arrange for Draco to finish his schooling from home, only if you are willing and able to ensure he seeks proper treatment for his obvious addiction.” She stands, face tight and eyes firm. "This is solely due to my understanding of the nature of his addiction and my
“Did it make you feel good? To fuck someone who hates you. To know that I hated you so much but still couldn’t resist.”
“Is it true, though? That Theo used to be obsessed with him?”
Chismosos... the lot of them!
Draco swallows. “You can,” he says. “If you want to.”
“I wanted to hear it back from someone else first, I wanted him to be the first.”
Malfoy rolls off the bed, and Harry’s hands reach out into the lingering heat of his body on the sheets. Harry watches as Malfoy strips down to his briefs, back towards Harry, as he crawls onto his own bed and curls under the sheets. Harry stares at the peak of blond hidden under the black duvet and hates how the contrast is highlighted by the moonlight.
It’s Draco’s Dark Mark and it’s faded now, soft and pink and scarred. All up and down that mark are tiny bits of raised skin.
“You should see the way you look, all fucked out like that.” Draco groans into his ear. “Fuck, you have no idea how much I –” He cuts off as Harry clenches around him.
Ron sighs. “You’ve been acting weird ever since you started living with him.”
“Harry almost killed him.”
Harry swallows, shrugs. “Do you hate him?”
“Go ahead.”
“Harry, if he’s hurting you–”
Draco keeps snorting the Pixie Dust and Harry follows his lead.
“I forgave him for me,” Hermione says, lifting her arm, the one that hides a scar under the tattoo of a sword. “I get to choose who I give grace to. Me. I’ve been hurt.”
Draco sips his merlot, titling his head. “Well, that happened sooner than I thought.”
And when Draco is begging so sweetly, calling Harry baby in his posh voice, broken with pleasure, who is Harry to deny him? He slides another finger into Draco’s tight heat, eyes on the other man’s hooded gaze. Harry bites his lips, drinking in the sight of debauchery before him – Draco with his hand on Harry’s own, with his back arched, with his hips thrusting to the pace Harry’s fingers have set.
Draco snorts. “Please never take me to one of those places.”
“Alright.”
“No, she is,” Draco says, eyes far away, lost in the world he’s found in the puddle of rain. “I hope one day she’ll change her mind about all that.”
Harry’s heart skips a beat at the question. “No,” he says, hoping his voice is casual enough.
“Yes, he’s let us know that you and himself along with Ms. Parkinson have been taking Pixie Dust, amongst other narcotics.”
Draco touches Harry’s scar, softly, with a gentle slide of his fingers, outlining the lightning bolt from where it cuts into his eyebrow and up towards his hairline.
Malfoy,
Trust me, I don't have a habit of giving out offers unless I intend to see them through. Feel free to ask about anything, anytime you have questions.
“Yes, you are,” Harry pleads, throat thick. He feels the familiar shame of the monster in his chest rattling against the carefully placed chains of restraint, echoing in his heartbeat the rhythm of
“No,” says Draco, voice a rasp – like it’s broken a delicate silence that hadn’t been held between them. “You were lovely,” he whispers, “so lovely, I –” Malfoy picks up his jumper from the floor. “I’m sorry.” His voice trembles and Harry wonders what he’s done wrong.
They all share a laugh and Draco offers Harry a spliff, while him and Pansy snort another line of Pixie Dust. Harry’s throat is dry as he watches him do it and wonders what it feels like. Draco is the definition of debauched, with his hair dishevelled the way it is and white button down open and revealing.
“How can it not bother you?”
Once he’s been excused from the Headmistresses office, Harry finds his feet leading him towards Myrtle's bathroom. Harry has an odd worry of history repeating himself, wondering if he’ll come across Draco crying in the loo again. Although, it’s him that feels like crying so maybe it’ll be him that gets found out.
“Fuck yes, you feel so good inside me.”
“Don’t need to,” Draco sighs, sweetly, smiling wide, hands coming to squeeze onto Harry’s shoulders. “You’re going to make me come like this.”
I am sorry to hear that you were hurt too, I thought it might have been happening to you - and I hate to hear that was in fact the case.
Harry licks his lips, swallows his rabbit heartbeat. “How so?”
The next morning, over chocolate chip pancakes, bacon, and eggs, Draco finally has the stomach, the space, the safety net to tell Harry the awful truth.
“Do you even want this?”
“Do you not talk to her?”
“Was there anyone else?” Harry asks, looking at Draco’s hands, at how they sit so close to his lap, twiddling – noticing the way Draco picks at the cuticles on his thumb.
Draco reaches out to him, and Harry follows without thinking, his heart is beating too loudly in his ears, and he keeps flickering his eyes back and forth between the powder and Draco’s blood-shot eyes.
When Harry comes, it’s long and hard, with a tight grip on his white sex-drenched sheets, with Draco’s firm yet comforting hold on his hips.
“Water?” Harry asks.
“Do you always feel it when I look at you?” Harry’s voice is a rasp; he’d meant to whisper his question, but Draco is warm next to him and he’s high as fuck and it’s making his head go a bit dizzy.
If there's anything we need to know about Harry is that he's a bit of a messy bitch! Lmao!
“Takes one to know one,” Draco says, trying to turn his face into a sneer, but unable to keep the serious look on his face long enough. After another fit of laughter, Draco turns to Nott and asks, “Am I really the last person you slept with?”
Draco snorts, fixing his mercury gaze on Harry, cheek resting on his knee. “Right.”
“Except respect my boundaries?” Draco reaches for the cupboard, the one that has the salad dressing Pansy likes. “You hate him.”
Harry feels himself flush and licks his lips, staring at Draco, who moves towards him, with wide eyes.
“I love you,” Harry whispers.
"My son had made those around him fully aware of his addiction, in accordance with with his probation. I will not let him take sole blame for relapsing when he was seen snorting Pixie Dust alongside the supposed saviour of our world!"
Harry grins. “What I
“Oh, so you decide what I deserve, then?” Harry says in jest.
Harry’s lips find his, a tentative push of the head, a small lean towards something new. Draco meets him, and suddenly there is heat and warmth and desire bleeding through his reservation. Draco moves his arms, holds onto Harry, pulls him close.
Harry takes the little spoon, with the snow-white powder on it. It looks shiny up close, and he puts it to his nose and snorts it down. Pansy and Blaise whoop, and Draco looks so pleased — like a cat that’s just had its ears scratched. Harry thinks he might just become addicted to the feeling he gets when he sees Draco like that. The drip hits the back of Harry’s throat, and his heartbeat is wild in his ears, pumping through him with a rhythm that matches the speakers still pumping music below him.
“You thought I would quit?”
Harry only has two fingers pumping in and out of Draco’s pink hole. “Are you sure?”
As you can see, I've written back which means I am, in fact,
They drank, and because they were adults, because Hermione wasn’t there to be a voice of reason, because the world had sharpened their hurt into pointed edges that brushed against them often, they barely ate and drank on.
Draco puts his hands in Harry’s, lets himself be led to bed, mirrors Harry as he sits, leg on the bed, foot meeting his thigh, the other still planted on the floorboards.
“What do you want, baby?” Harry leans into Draco’s space, turning his body towards his man. “Name it and it's yours.”
“I love you,” they say together. At the same time. Draco doesn’t want him to be the only one bearing their heart.
Draco rolls his eyes at her, wondering if it’s Richard again. He’s been visiting, trying to show Draco that everything is still okay between them. Draco appreciates the effort, the man had been Draco’s first friend in this odd little world he had willingly found himself in almost a year ago - it’s nice to know that his friendship is valued enough that there is an effort to make sure it is kept.
Christ, everyone wants to blame Malfoy like he has anything to do with it. Maybe, just, maybe this has to do with me and my life, me needing space. Has anyone stopped to consider what I
Up front he sees a familiar head of curls, wild, thick, coarse. Draco has always wanted to run his hands through those curls, wondering what it would feel like to pull on them. Green eyes are the next thing he’s taking in, intense as always. Evergreen hues of wonder that bore into Draco’s darkened soul.
Draco stops, hands tightening on his hips. He looks at Harry in a way that lets him know they are treading on very dangerous territory, but Harry’s never been one to be afraid of a little danger. “Usually I’m the one getting fucked, if I’m being honest.”
When he falls asleep, he’s unsure.
Draco smiles slow and predatory, like he’s won something. “Yes, alright. Whatever you want, darling.”
Draco places his dirty dishes by the sink, brushes his hands against his trousers debating whether or not to grab his apron before he goes back up. He decides against it and instead heads out without it, rolling up the sleeves of his jumper as he is wont to do.
Jesus, we both are really fucked up by this whole thing aren’t we? Sometimes, I think you’re one of the few people who might actually understand what it’s like having Voldemort breathing down your neck. I mean you lived with the bloody freak for a year! He was a terrifying shell of a man who took so much from me.
“Stop,
“Okay,” Draco says, reaching for the gold string, pulling at it with his long fingers.
Hermione said you and her have gotten on great through your letters. Sometimes I think you two are talking more than you and me. Don’t forget about me, haha. She mentioned you’re working at a Muggle cafe, how’d that happen?
. “You’re my baby.”
Harry touches his split upper lip, remembers Draco fucking into him, and fights to supress the grin threatening to show on his face. “Something like that.”
And Harry’s breath goes even again when he says, “Yeah.”
Harry could barely pay attention then, finding only enough strength to nod along at her words of comfort. They felt empty, her words, but perhaps that had more to do with Harry and less to do with his professor’s intentions.
Something deflates in Harry’s chest.
Hermione says forgiveness is “letting go of feelings of revenge and desire to retaliate,” which is either something she got from her books or her mind healer. I guess if forgiveness is that, then I've already forgiven you for just about everything. But, I guess, just because you’ve forgiven someone doesn’t mean you have to keep them in your life or accept them as they are. Sometimes, you have to burn a bridge or set strong boundaries and even then, that still counts as forgiveness.
Draco moans, hiding his face in his pillow, thrusting into Harry’s fist. He’s leaking precome and Harry uses that to help pump him harder, not faster — no, not yet. He’s teasing him and Draco knows it and Draco likes it and Draco’s matching Harry’s rhythm with his own hand on Harry’s hardened cock.
“You don’t have to forgive me.”
“Neville sells to him –” Harry runs a hand through his curls. “– if you feel like you’re missing out, then go get some from him.” He slams his Potions book shut and gathers his things. Can’t he just get high in peace, what’s the big deal who he gets high with?
because it was what needed to be done, or can I believe it was wrong even if it was “for the greater good” ?
“I love you,” Draco says, eyes rolling back as Harry rubs against his prostate.
I kind of got into a depressive episode a few months ago, and it’s only getting worse.
Harry wants to die; he hates himself for the way he still wishes it was Draco he was waking up next to.
Pansy reaches out her hand, palm facing heaven. Her smile is warm. Her smile is home.
“Come on, admit it,” Draco says, brushing a loose ringlet back from where it's fallen in front of Harry’s face, letting Harry into his space as they move close to each other. “You think I’m pretty.”
Harry stands up, throwing down his cards, muttering mostly to himself about how he needs a fucking smoke. His heart is thumping in his ear so loudly, has him stomping up the steps so fiercely that he doesn’t realise Hermione and Ron have followed him up.
“Well, since you’re here,” Parkinson stands, and Harry doesn’t hesitate to reclaim his spot, taking the spliff Malfoy offers him. “You can help me choose tonight’s outfit.”
Draco clenches around Harry, come spurting from his cock onto his stomach and chest as Harry moves his hand to help him through it, on the edge of his own pleasure.
I’m pants at advice about this stuff normally, but it’s what I would do if I was in front of the bloke I really liked.
Harry thinks,
Draco comes inside him, he comes onto both their stomachs and Harry keeps chanting the other man’s name, kissing him deep, pulling him into a tight embrace.
“You think they’re going to–?” Harry leans towards Ron to ask, only cutting himself off when he remembers that they haven’t really talked about anything that happened before the break. They hadn’t really talked at all since Ron had come back early in the afternoon.
Harry breathes in and out slowly. “Okay,” he says.
Harry thrusts into Draco’s warmth with deep thrusts that have him clenching around Harry, pumping in and out of him with long, rough strokes, hips twitching when his cock buries into the velvet heat of Draco’s arse, balls slapping against the skin of his buttocks — unhurried as he slides out, taking his time to enjoy the way Draco’s hole sucks him back in, begging to be filled.
“– although, if you’d like a few pointers, I’d be happy to help you. Be doing me a favour, you would, if you let me pass him onto you.”
Harry’s eyes stare at the light, practically unnoticeable scars that litter Draco’s chest. “I don’t,” he begins, clearing his throat, trying to find a better way to say: “I don’t share well.” The words slip out, leaving him exposed.
4. Draco's just had a client confess to him that they have feelings for him - which is something that really does happen in the real sex work world. He's trying his best to handle it gently and this is his way of achieving that.
Malfoy,
Narcissa stands. “Please explain to me what other intentions he could possibly have, seeing as he was there when they read my son the rules of his probation.”
“I suppose that’s true.”
you."
Draco finds him at 12 Grimmauld Place at the beginning of July, the sun’s heat is thick, and the sweat it produces on the back of Harry’s neck is the only reminder he has that he’s still alive, barely, but alive, nonetheless.
“I love you,” Draco says as Harry pulls away.
, is playing with the waistband of Harry’s pyjama bottoms and Harry stops his grinding against Draco’s thigh and grabs his wrist, sliding the other man’s hand under the waistline of his pants. Draco’s sharp intake of breath is a reward in of itself, and Harry is so distracted with marking Draco’s neck that he doesn’t realise he’s just given Draco permission to touch him until Draco’s long fingers are wrapped around his cock, pumping his length and sending shivers of pleasure down Harry’s spine.
I didn't know what that spell did.
“I love –” Harry cuts himself off before he says what he really means. “– the way you feel. Fuck, fuck,
“Alright,” says Harry, voice carefully even. “Take all the time you need.”
Ginny was possessed by Riddle for a year, so she can understand where I’m coming from. She’s been defending me against Hermione’s insistent pushing. Don’t get me wrong, I really do appreciate her for wanting to make sure I’m doing alright, but I wish she’d let this go.
“Mine would –” Harry exhales the smoke in his lungs and moves to straddle Draco, handing him back the spliff. “– they’d throw a fit over it, really.”
Malfoy snorts next to her. “Come on, Pans, I didn’t say that.”
A smirk crosses her lipstick smudged lips. “You’ll see, love.”
“Do you see why I didn’t want them living together?” Narcissa Malfoy cuts in, words seething from her lips, posture rigid. “He’s going to blame all this on my son and end up sending him back to Azkaban, when they were both engaging in the use of these narcotics together!”
“Why not, Theo?” Draco moves to grab the big salad bowl. “Why can’t you just let it go?”
“Yeah?”
The third time Harry wonders what Draco tastes like, its eighth year and they haven’t spoken a word to each other since the start of the term four months ago. Now there’s Harry lounging on the sofa and Malfoy on the chair by the hearth. The only sound between them is the crackling ember of firewood. Harry stares and his eyes drift and Malfoy wets his lips but never meets Harry’s gaze.
Draco’s lip quirks. “You’re a hopeless romantic.”
I’ve been informed (by Hermione) that my “correspondence was truly deplorable” and that “I should try and be civil when returning property that doesn’t belong to me” but honestly fuck that. Your family joined an ego maniac and got off without consequence. Why should I be nice to you?
Draco lays in bed, curled under the white duvet, head on the silk pillow he’s brought from his flat. Harry went once, to help him bring over clothes he could keep at Harry’s, for the days he ended up sleeping over.
“You helped,” Harry tells him.
“Love isn’t about deserving,” Theo says. “Love is something you give, something you open yourself up to receive.”
The fourth time Harry wonders what Draco tastes like, it’s the end of the first year of Auror training and he’s been brought into a mixed lesson with the Potions Lab department. Draco’s not even in that department, he’s just an assistant to the guest speaker, and somehow, by chance, that guest speaker is going to be teaching the morning class – the afternoon class has a different guest speaker. Harry tries to pay attention for a total of ten minutes but then Draco’s walking around and the potions lab is so
Draco visits him regularly, far more regularly than Harry had anticipated, and each time he gives himself away Harry gathers the fractured bits and pieces like they’re gold, hoping one day to have enough to start forming a picture.
Dean laughs, pulling on Draco. “Let’s go already, I lived with them for six years. It's always wise to get out of the crossfire.” Draco laughs and follows behind Dean.
“How come?”
Don't forget how twitter be!! Read bottom to top for the page breaks :)
You make absolutely no fucking sense?? You followed me into the Room of Requirement, begging for your wand back? Why the bloody fuck wouldn’t you want it back now? What’s wrong with you?
“No, but
“I didn’t think I fucking had to, what do you want me to do? Keep an eye on him for you? Repeat of Sixth Year, maybe. Shall I cut him up in a loo at the end of the school year for you too?”
Draco pulls away, sniffs, and says, “I want you to fuck me.”
“But you won’t want to
Draco kisses him again, sliding his tongue against Harry’s bottom lip, seeking entrance. Harry gasps, letting his tongue slide against Draco’s, working to undo the buttons on Draco’s shirt. Draco moans into his mouth, and rips open his shirt, letting the buttons fly everywhere.
Draco returns the favour by fingering Harry and sucking him off at the same time, completely overwhelming his senses, sending him into overdrive all the same. Harry comes with three fingers inside him and Draco’s grey-rimmed eyes staring up at him with lust and something else that Harry can’t quite put his finger on.
Harry leans his head back against the wall. “Yeah?”
Draco shakes his head. “Do you have one of those fizzy muggle drinks?”
“Oh so, when I was getting pissed every night last May, I was living with him then too?”
Harry doesn’t ask if Draco’s sure, Draco wouldn’t be here if he wasn’t, instead, Harry puts his hand on Draco’s hip, looking into Draco’s eyes, finding it easier to breathe when he does. Draco nods his head, eyes on Harry’s own, emotion swimming in his grey-lined hues, and suddenly Harry’s heart is three sizes too big for his chest.
“Can I kiss you?” Harry asks.
Ron and Hermione goin to do the horizontal mambo...good for them!
Ron, between bites of his egg-covered toast asks, “Are you two like friends or something now?” He’s getting crumbs onto his shirt, earning him a fond eye roll from Hermione.
Please be mindful of that when sending her your letter. I feel like I’m coming off passive aggressively, it’s just that - I’m really protective of the people I love. I hope you’ll understand.
“What kind of party drugs?”
Draco sits next to Harry on the floor, their shoulders would be brushing against one another if Harry wasn’t leaning back and using the foot of the couch for support. Nott is to Draco’s left, and Harry notices that their fingers are still loosely intertwined. Harry feels his jaw tighten, something dark and ugly scratching underneath his chest.
“I love you.”
.” He grinds the words out as a muscle in his jaw flexes and Harry wishes he knew why Draco didn’t want him, didn’t want to be his – is it so bad to belong to someone? Is it so awful to be wanted by someone like Harry?
Under the fluorescent light of the pub, Draco’s face shines a soft cherry red with the warmth of drink and he’s quiet and observant and so bloody good looking. Harry can’t stop staring, Merlin, he wants to put Draco’s diamond encrusted silver earring in his mouth, he wants to bite his porcelain neck, he wants to lick those wet, pink, lips and yet Harry doesn’t move.
That’s another thing I do when I get antsy, I go get a tattoo or piercing and everything feels OK again, even if it’s just for a while.
” he repeats, and the man whose namesake it is mewls into his ear, spent and overstimulated.
“Is it –” Harry wants to ask if it’s something he’s done and feels frantic with his need to know. “– do you know why –”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Next time, then,” says Draco.
P.S. I’m glad you like ABBA and I’m so happy to hear you also like Sade! She’s amazing. Enclosed is her album
“What’s wrong with you?” Draco asks, after they’ve each snorted a few more lines.
Harry smiles, “Me too,” he says, slipping out of Draco, mourning the loss of the other man’s warmth.
Harry steps back, leans against the hearth. France? Draco’s leaving him and moving to fucking France? Harry looks over at the blond and their eyes meet. Harry feels like his heart’s been ripped out of his chest, stomped on, and left to stay bleeding.
“Why were you with Dean?”
Draco’s grin is lazy, and his kisses are sloppy, but Harry loves the feeling of it. They’re laughing and laughing and kissing and touching and laughing.
So now us mentally ill queer folk are dying our hair, is that the new trend? I went the body modification route and got some piercings and tattoos instead. Check out the polaroids I included. Got a tattoo in honour of my mum (Lilies on my arm) and dad (Stag tattoo on my back). I’m also thinking of getting something for Sirius and Remus too.
“Catching up with an old friend, of course,” Draco explains.
Harry inhales sharply, it’s not like he’s never thought about it before, it’s just, well, he was perfectly fine with the way things were, but Draco’s looking at him with glitter grey eyes and so of course he’s going to agree, his cock is already agreeing for him. “Okay, yeah, fuck, yeah.”
“Of fucking course,” Harry growls. “You’d be like this –” He slowly pulls out, thrusting back in deeply. “– so, fucking –” Another thrust, torturously slow and deep. “–
3. Harry's a bit of a mess, but connecting with people while you're considered a saviour must be very difficult, don't you think?
. Harry feels a familiar heat crawl its way down his body and he gladly parts his legs further, moving closer to the man before him.
Harry answers, “Yes.”
, they explain. If anyone would just stop to ask Harry his opinion, maybe then they'd realise that Harry thinks they’ll be able to get on just fine — because there seems to be some sort of unspoken agreement between the two men that their petty rivalry of the past is just that: a rivalry best left for their past selves to repeat and their present selves to ignore.
Harry touches up at his split lip, worries that Theo’s going to do something and give himself and everyone else away.
Draco clenches around him, letting out a wail of pleasure as he comes on his and Harry’s stomach. Harry’s ears ring as Draco convulses, clenching exquisitely tight around Harry’s cock. Harry buries himself deep inside Draco, thrusting rapidly as he begins to come.
“Yes,” Draco says, a slight tremor in his voice.
It’s quiet, almost too quiet, but Harry supposes most people are in their classes and that’s why there isn’t any noise coming from downstairs.
Draco smacks his lips, tilts his head. “Ergh,” he says, moving his hands and dragging them down his face. “My breath stinks.” He lets out a short breath. “Alright, fine. I want dinner.”
Malfoy had brought them back to their room, stopping every few steps to laugh at some inconsequential little thing that they’d forget about the minute they stopped looking at it, and had been smart enough to remind Harry to change into some warm clothes, then proceeding to invite him under the duvet.
“Are you okay?” Harry asks, panic changing the rhythm of his heartbeat from anticipation to adrenaline.
Malfoy’s eyes flutter open. “Fuck, yes.”
Harry had never actually imagined what Draco would taste like, had only ever wanted to know. Had felt restless with the overwhelming curiosity that felt more like
It smells of lavender and myrrh.
Hermione is being too obvious about her eavesdropping, Harry is staring at her when he says, “Would you rather we fight?” He thinks he sounds rather calm when he asks, but to be fair he’s been told he sounds cold when he makes his voice go flat like that.
"Harry is a
“Ha ha.” Although Draco cannot see the other man, he can hear the smile in Harry’s voice, can practically imagine him rolling his eyes. “Seriously, though.”
who got hurt by it.”
Alright, enclosed is a mixtape with some of my favourite songs! No judging! Some of these are a bit sappy, but what can I say? I have my moments. I’m really excited to hear what you think, though. I think you’re really going to like ABBA. They’re a guilty pleasure of mine, actually.
“Mr. Potter, you’ve been skipping classes, your grades are slipping, the same cannot be said for Mr. Malfoy who has kept steady grades in all of his classes. He says any absences were spent with you and that you and him both engaged in the use of these narcotics with the full knowledge of his tumultuous relationship with Pixie Dust in the past.”
“Reckon they’ve gone to ring in the new year with a shag?” Lavender asks, eyes towards the staircase that leads up towards the dorm.
FINE. I'm sorry.
“What the fuck?” Harry’s eyes are wide. Panic starts to settle in, making his hands shake.
“Don’t,” Draco sounds pained. “If we start the whole apology tour, we’ll be here all night and I really,
Harry’s brain shuts down for a second, because that is hot as all hell, but then Harry’s brain reboots and offers him a rather mischievous thought. Harry wants to taste, to touch, to feel.
(See the end of the chapter for
Fair warning, everything you have read until this point was made very far in advance.
Harry lets out a soft cry, lifting his head up to kiss Draco. “Say it again, fuck, please.”
“Mr. Potter, I had hoped when I arranged your living situation with Mr. Malfoy, well, I had
Draco sneers at her. “Fuck off, Pansy.”
“It’s from a poem I like.” Draco moved his head further from the light of the phone, burrowing into his duvet. “By Ilya Kaminsky.”
I love Queen, actually. They're one of my all time favourite bands! This neighbour of yours has good taste. I'm glad to see that you've made a new friend too! Hopefully he can show you a thing or two about the Muggle word, since I assume he is one?
“No, there are other drugs besides weed. Party drugs, you see.” Malfoy holds his hands out, shaking his fingers as he talks.
is. On the bed there’s a rounded silver regency carved mirror with white powder and a tiny crown-topped spoon in the middle of it all. Harry’s eyes bulge out a bit, and he blinks rapidly as he tries to take in the sight before him.
Harry rolls off Malfoy completely, laying his head down onto his pillow, staring at the swirling canopy above his bed. Merlin, he’s had so much to drink. He hadn’t noticed. Most days his mind is hazy, most days he feels like he’s half-drunk already. The burn of grief is the same as Firewhiskey, the mind-numbing buzz stays no matter what he does, making him feel depersonalized, like a zombie walking, talking, haunting the skeletal halls of the school that once felt so much like home.
“Am I a bad friend?”
“You can be rather obvious when you’re not too busy stuck in your head about it.”
Harry makes his way over to Draco, helps the blond get fully on the bed and under the duvet. He puts an arm and a leg over Draco, pulling him close. “He’s wrong, you know.”
“One more after graduation,” he says. “I cried with him.” Draco laughs, a short and bitter thing. “It was awful.”
“Happy,” Harry echoes. “Right.” He realises then that he doesn’t have happy movies, he has dramas and thrillers, but he doesn’t hold onto happy things.
“What’s the occasion?” Harry asks, grabbing their attention.
The first time Draco and Harry come together, Malfoy cries before anything can really start between them.
The cans hiss with the air that’s released, and Harry feels a similar happenstance occurring within him. Like a balloon releasing air, he feels deflated, but not defeated. He thinks this is tiredness but is unsure if it’s the proper description for where he sits emotionally.
Fuck you and your shitty family,
“Yes, darling, I’m here,” Narcissa says, pushing Harry away from Draco. “Do you see, Minerva? Look at how he regards my son. Do you truly believe he had no involvement at all in the events leading up to Pansy's overdose? He was one of the people she was last seen using with for Crice's sake!”
Draco swallows, feels his heartbeat quicken against his chest. “I don’t think it’s fair to put people in the position of having to forgive me.”
Let this be a lesson, don't drunk text ur former obsession and not expect them to want answers.
When Draco comes, his legs are wrapped around Harry’s hips. His head and eyes are rolled back from the pleasure that has him convulsing around Harry’s cock, seducing one of the most intense orgasms Harry’s ever had out of him. Harry feels overcome by it, something warm and soothing swelling in his chest as he settles atop Draco.
“Whatever. Potter, you won’t say anything, will you?”
“Price of entry to the game is a shot of Tequila-mixed Veritaserum,” Seamus slurs, pouring two shots out for them. His movements are messy and slowed, but no one seems to notice or care.
The monster in Harry’s chest rears its ugly head then and Harry takes a breath, stamping it down. “I wanted to cook for you,” he says, because it’s easier to say that then to explain the tightness in his lungs and the claw-like clasp that clutches at his heart. It’s easier to say that because
“Yeah?”
Later, when Draco’s pumping in and out of him smooth and slow, moonlight painting his skin in a silver-white glow Harry asks, “Does that mean I’m the first person you’ve done this with?”
“That’s all we talk about.”
Harry shakes his head. “Fuck. You. Did you mean
Luna hands him some more meat from her satchel. “Am I a bad person?”
“Okay,” Harry says, nervous. “Whatever you want.” Relinquishing control is not an easy task for Harry, not now, not after everything but Harry supposes that right here, right now, if it’s like this then he can and he does.
“Sorry to break it to you,
C O M M U N I C A T I O N
Draco preens, face flushing as he leans closer into Harry, pointy chin pushing into the dip of his collarbone.
“He almost killed me, with the mead. I know it was meant for Dumbledore, but it was
“I never said there was, that you were –”
“I just – can’t. Ron, I’m sorry. Really, I am.”
“I can hear you think from here,” Malfoy says, breaking Harry away from his spiraling thoughts. The other man kicks at Harry with his socked foot. “It’s driving me mad, spit it out already.”
“Why didn’t you just say sorry?” Harry’s voice softens. “When I brought up how you,” he pauses. “When I brought up how you used to make fun of me. For being an orphan.”
He kissed his way back up Draco’s body, groaning softly as their lips met. “I love you so fucking much.”
“Harry, please.” One foot skidded across the sweat on Harry’s back as Draco’s entire body writhed. “I want…I want more.”
A few years later, Black mentioned that Potter wanted to create a home for children from abusive families to have a safe place to go outside of Hogwarts. Draco and his foundation stepped in to help find enough land to build a home large enough and allow for space to play quidditch and roam outside. Draco and Neville had become fast friends during that time, working together to create greenhouses and gardens that were meant to be played in, as neither boy had been allowed to do so growing up.
“All right, all right. I’ll read it. But then, you and this.” He waved his hand. “This tree thing are going home. Wherever that might be.”
“Whatever.”
Draco frowned and looked over at the young woman, at least two quills tucked into her spiral curls. “Aren’t you working on the law that’s supposed to create better relationships between the wizarding world and goblins?”
Seeming to catch on, Harry shoved him again. “You’re who Sirius keeps swapping records with, aren’t you?”
Draco dropped his fork, and he ducked, mumbling an apology and wiping up the splash of sauce, but Harry took his hand. Not sure he was pulling in a full breath, not sure he was breathing at all, Draco looked up.
Draco tugged the slacks and pants down, gasping softly as Harry’s cock sprang free. “I’d say that’s not fair, but since I get to appreciate it, I’ll go for thank you.”
He spent his morning in and out of the office, accompanying small groups of Aurors to various stores on Diagon and Knockturn Alley in order to calm angry groups of parents who had attempted to purchase their children gifts, not always through legal channels, that had yet to arrive. By lunch, he’d been punched in the side of the head and had two Stinging Hexes sent at his back for telling people they were not allowed to duel shopkeepers for not having the correct lifelike baby doll.
Harry lifted his brows, knowing he’d seen Draco at games in button-ups. Today, though he was in a black long-sleeved shirt with a scarlet Barty the Bat on the front and tight black jeans. Very tight black jeans. Jeans that clung to lean legs that seemed to go on forever before ending at a heart-shaped ass. How did he have legs so long? Harry’s head jerked up when Draco snapped in his face. “Huh? What?”
Harry took the letter and slid his glasses on.
“Frosting.” Draco glared at Harry. “You use it like glue or something and stick it all together.”
Harry looked up in time to see the seven-year-old launch a snowball at a lanky figure in dark wool slacks and a heavy coat walking past the park.
Harry looked around at the scatter stacks of paper, the half-empty cups of tea, and the trashcan full of old to-go boxes. “Yeah, no, mine is much neater.”
Harry was still grinning when he arrived home to find lunch waiting. Steak and kidney pie, his favorite, and treacle tart pudding for dessert. Grinch circled the house, exploring every nook and cranny as Harry ate, then followed him around as he set up the stand and showed Grinch where to sleep. His bird’s unending energy levels reminded him of his godson, and Harry quickly floo-called Andromeda, asking if he could collect Teddy the next day.
Seventh, a Nimbus 6000
Suddenly, Grinch flew in, package attached to his leg. Draco took the package and spelled in bigger, eyes watering again. Grinch bounced over to the candy dish on his desk, pulling out a peppermint candy and dragging it over to Draco. “You remembered my favorite.” He patted the little bird, popped the mint in his mouth, and opened the package.
Hermione passed a gift to Molly, before exchanging a look with Ron. Harry paused in opening his current present and watched as Molly unwrapped hers.
“And you? What about you?”
“Trouble
His father shook his head and stepped forward. “We do NOT care for this development. Either you will marry a pureblood girl.” He slashed his hand to the side as his wife tried to cut in. “Or you can leave. For good.”
Harry chewed his lip, leaning back in his chair and adding this note to everything else he’d learned about his admirer. “Grinch. Note?” The owl looked up from where he was pecking at this food, quickly flying over as Harry scribbled a note, asking what position the other man played. The response came quickly.
“Hey, kiddo. Ready to help me with this?”
in a voice he couldn’t place.
Harry blushed, landing next to Draco and Nott. “I suppose we were pretty good, huh?”
They road to the atrium in silence, but not the awkward silence of two men who couldn’t speak to one another, as Harry would have expected. More the comfortable silence of two people who understand that both need a little calm at the end of the day.
Harry laughed, “Yeah, no, I’m all for coming inside.”
Harry pointed at the bottom. “Maybe the, uh, thingie? Whatever that is that it’s standing in. Maybe that’s off?”
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand under the table, as Molly shushed him, already waving her wand to mix ingredients.
Harry could hear the pout in Draco’s voice, and he fought the urge to smile. “I know, but sometimes, I really hate being alone.”
“No, I’m first Harry. That’s second Hairy.”
“Yeah, together.”
Harry was off that Wednesday and planned to finally go Christmas shopping. He left Grinch at home, as the little owl had taken to following Kreatcher around the house and dropping random items for him to pick up. Floo’ing into Diagon Alley, he pulled his scarf tighter around his face and headed for his first stop: Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour. It didn’t matter that it was cold. His ritual was stopping for a chocolate and raspberry cone, like Hagrid had purchased him, before he started his shopping, the sugary treat helping him stay in a good mood when dealing with the rush of the season. When he ordered and paid, though, he was handed a small package along with his change.
“I, uh, I guess I’m keeping my flat, then.”
He swallowed and looked back at her.
“Huh?”
Draco shook his head then nodded. “After Christmas, though. If that’s okay?”
“Enough!” Harry’s face was bright red, and he fidgeted in place. “I guess some stuff slipped my mind, okay. I’ve just been enjoying us being together.”
Sirius nodded. “How else would I have known you wanted to?”
He’d just always felt like he was on the outside of it.
Teddy and Harry began untangling the lights, and Draco sorted the ornaments into piles only he seemed to understand. Soon enough, the three of them had everything on the tree, but it seemed to lilt a bit to the left.
“No, but your brother did.” Remus sat up, setting the book aside and running his fingers through Sirius’s hair, knowing that soothed him more than anything else. “And according to Harry, your brother betrayed the Dark Lord, in the end. Would you give him another chance, if he were still here?”
Harry groaned and pulled Draco into a kiss, hands running over his body. “You’re going to be the death of me. I swear.” He pulled back running his hands through his own hair, still wrecked from sleep and the previous night. “Okay, I can’t impress you if I burn your bacon. Go away so I can focus.”
“You know. Usually you have one stocking for each person in the house. I didn’t need twelve, when there’s only me.”
“I mean, I ate some stale biscuits with cold tea?” He took a swallow of the tart drink. “This is really good. You really know a lot about wines.”
“Were shit.” Harry wrapped his hand around Draco’s wrist, and he flushed at his nervous tick being noticed. “You’re pretty not shit anymore.”
“My father demanded we support Tornadoes, since they were willing to use blackmail and torture to win. I always liked the Bats, though. Their red uniforms horrified father, but that just made me like them more. I bet Hermione would send me to a therapist, too.”
Not two second later, Grinch nipped his thumb.
Harry had been called away from his desk before he could respond, forced to sit through his mid-month meeting with Robards and the other heads of office while that letter and all its implications burned through his mind.
Hermione’s eyes were full of tears, and Harry was stunned. To be living with Bellatrix and Voldemort but actively working against them like that. He hadn’t expected such a thing from younger Draco. Hell, he wasn’t sure he could have expected such a thing from most people at that age.
“I’m mad because one drooled all over half my face in an attempt to do just that,” he muttered, shaking his head, but she just laughed harder and walked off.  Harry lifted the edge of his robe to scrub at his face once more, as he unlocked his door. Ron had offered to bring over chicken masala and naan for lunch, and Harry wanted to straighten up after Grinch before he arrived. The little bird was always getting into things, strewing quills across the floor, batting around pieces of paper. Honestly, it was like having a cat with wings most days.
Harry grimaced, shoulders squeezing up around his ears, as Ron started to laugh. “Um, three actually. Cho and Ginny started dating earlier this year.”
Sirius nodded. “My mum burned me off the family tapestry, but legally, I was still a Black. I was able to access my part of the family fortune once I turned twenty-one, and this was what I wanted for my birthday.”
“Hey!” Terry Boot stepped into them, throwing an arm around each of their necks. “We’re all going to pub for a beer and some food. You guys wanna come?”
Draco rolled his eyes and sat. He started to respond, but Harry clamped a hand over his mouth. “Fifteen minutes. Don’t take that away from us.”
“I like cooking.” Remus and Harry spoke at the same time with Draco chiming along. “I’m pants at cooking.”
“Maybe a little?” Harry wrinkled his nose. “Sorry.”
The darker-haired man grinned, winked, “New Auror classification system. Waffle guys are good guys.”
Nodding, Harry set the broom aside to keep it safe. “Yeah, of course. I hope…I hope I can soon.”
Harry felt like he couldn’t breath for a moment. “Dobby?”
Taking a breath, Harry met Draco’s gaze. “I was assigned to check you out when my superiors found out you were hired at Hogwarts, and I did run into you on purpose because of that. At first. But I really liked being around you, liked you, and by the time I fell in love, I’d forgotten why it all started. I was so happy with the now. And I’d like the chance to prove that to you.” Harry held his out. “If you’d let me.”
“No.” Harry kissed his cheek, tugging him forward again. “I want you to trust me.”
Draco smiled at how this conversation mimicked the one from the night before. “I know. I just feel like I should tell them in person and not send a note saying I’m skipping lunch to make out with my boyfriend.”
He’d changed his hair three times. First styling it into a fancy pompadour before deciding he looked pompous. Then slicking it all back before gagging at how much he looked like his school year self. He mussed it up afterwards, hoping for a shaggy-chic style but thought he looked more like he’d just rolled out of bed.
Frowning slightly, Andromeda walked over to kiss Harry’s cheek. “Are you sure about this? It’s, well, you’ve got a mess.”
“What’s wrong?” Harry frowned, following along.
“Come on in. Dibby is just finishing dinner. I got caught up in work, so I asked if she wouldn’t mind.”
“The someone that gift is for?” She smiled at him, it widening as he nodded. “Of course, my sweet boy. You’re my last unpaired child, and that just won’t do.”
That day after work, Ron once again met Harry in his office. Unable to resist the pull of his new broom, Harry had sent out an interoffice memo setting up a pickup quidditch match. He and Ron were shoving each other back and forth, trash talking one another about how the game would go, when Draco stepped out of his office.
“All right, all right. Give me the letter.” Grinch hooted and bounced over to his treats, chomping them down as Harry broke the seal on the back, realizing he was more excited that the damn bird.
“I know I have a box, but I couldn’t exactly give you a pass to that as a gift without letting you know who was sending you stuff.” Draco cleared his throat, tugging at the collar of his shirt. “We could sit there, if you’d like. My family won’t be here to cause issues.”
Draco’s face was splotchy red as he nodded and followed. “Congratulations on the baby, Gra—, Weas—, Hermione.”
Sirius grinned and kissed Remus hard, uncaring that he was also crying, then slide the ring on his lover’s left hand. “I love you.”
Draco felt a matching grin form on his own face. “I can make sure my lesson plans are all done before you get back.”
Laughing, Harry continued his exit from the room, heading to the Indian place he knew Draco frequented. He was back almost exactly an hour later and poked his head inside the door. “Is this room food safe? I know the whole don’t bring food near the cauldrons things is a rule you guys play fast and loose with, but I figured I’d ask.”
This, however, this was just for him.
Harry put Teddy down, letting him run to climb into the big red sleigh, then took Draco’s hand, walking over with him and helping him up. Steaming mugs of hot cider and a thick blanket appeared once they were all settled, and as the sleigh headed off to circle the area, carolers started singing.
Draco dodged out of the way. “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea, but I appreciate the ask.”
She smiled, fidgeting, “I’m actually wanting to make sure you’re okay with me dating Ginny. I, well, I love her, Harry. I really, really love her. And I haven’t felt like this about anyone since Cedric. But you’re her family, and I can’t be an issue there. That’s not fair to her or you or anyone else, so I need to know.”
“I am pregnant and not allowed to attack that baked chicken until you two get inside and try it.”
Draco made a noncommittal noise, wobbling his head back and forth. “You’re off tomorrow, right?”
“I love you. So fucking much. I’ll never know how I got this lucky.”
He flicked his fingers, the snick of the door audible in the sudden quiet of the room. “And lock things.” Harry wouldn’t have noticed the faint tremor that ran though Draco had he not been watching him so closely, but satisfaction bloomed deep his belly, making him bite back a groan. “Tell me about this new project of yours. Is this the one you mentioned before? It’s ingenious.”
Harry looked up as Ron shrugged and walked inside, Cho coming over to meet him. “Are you coming to tell me it’s okay for me to date Draco, too?”
“This is so cool!” He automatically climbed on and took off, almost wiping out the tree, scaring his grandmother’s crups, and then falling off. “I wanna do it again!!”
Potter was still as nimble on a broom as he’d been during their school days. While he was broader, now, his lower center of gravity seemed to allow him to mesh with his broom, the two moving as one. Draco had hoped his long, lean frame would give him a speed advantage, but alas, he was wrong. Dead wrong. They ended up playing three seeker’s games, and he lost each one spectacularly, huffing and puffing by the end of the third. Apparently, having barely been on a broom since fifth year actually put him at a disadvantage.
“First cousin once removed.” He smirked. “Pureblood families have to know these things.”
That night, Harry came home already planning on sending Draco an owl to come over for dinner only to find a package and note on his table.
“It fills the hearth.”
“Santa?”
“Manifests what?”
Draco’s knees gave out and he sagged into Harry’s hold, their lips clashing again. Harry gripped one of Draco’s thighs, hiking it up around his waist and rocking them together. In response, Draco mewled and dug his nails into Harry’s shoulders, head falling back against the wall with a thud.
“I also have to wait on Cousin Draco’s gift.”
“I agree on that last part. You’ve worked yourself far too hard over the last seven years, especially given how hard you worked the previous seven.” She smiled. “And Teddy and I love to see you. I haven’t asked so much lately because it’s felt like you, well, like you wanted the distance, needed it maybe. If that’s not the case anymore, I’m more than happy to give all the time with Teddy you’d like.”
“Fuck, Draco, I’m not going to last.” He could feel Draco laugh, the sound reverberating up his throat and through Harry’s dick. His head fell back, muscles going taunt, and lights burst behind his eyes. “Draco!”
“Like hell I do.” He face flushed red, then he sighed and shook his head. “I love my mother, and I do my best to spend time with her, even though that house still gives me nightmares, but my father.” He shook his head. “My father put love of blood above love of blood, if that makes sense.” Harry nodded, and Draco continued, somewhat hesitantly. “I’m tired of defending myself to him. Defending why I refuse to further the pureblood agenda, or any other of his agendas. Defending being gay, having an actual job, reconnecting with Andromeda and Teddy, the people I spend time with.”
Draco stretched in Harry’s arms, whole body arching backwards then twisting against him, making him groan. With a small sigh, Draco shook his head and leaned forward, getting his wand and waving it to stop the music.
Harry nodded as the other man’s stammering came to an end. “Oh. Okay. Thank you.”
“I swear to Merlin, if you’re not telling me the house is on fire, I’m sending you back to who sent you.” Rolling over, he cracked one eye, Grinch promptly sticking his foot in it to show off that he had a letter. “You’re kidding. This couldn’t wait?” He rolled over, Grinch squawking loudly at his letter being ignored, and used is wand to cast tempus. “Fifteen minutes? I couldn’t have fifteen minutes?” Grinch flew over his head, nipped him on the nose, and shoved his foot back into Harry’s face. “No, huh? Fine.”
Their warming charm finally started to wane, and Harry rolled to his side, head on Draco’s shoulder, face in his throat. “Have I said thank you?”
Though his team lost that game, Seamus invited Draco out for lunch and shopping later that week. By the time Draco had been joining Harry and his friends for Quidditch for a few weeks of regular quidditch games, they’d become quite close. In fact, Draco actually felt quite at ease with most of the circle. He’d even started to think of a few of them as his own friends. Acquaintances, at least. Maybe whatever was between the two.
“Fuck, you’re going to kill me, Potter.” Draco’s voice was high, thready, and he arched to press closer.
“Your ice cream already run out?”
“Molly,” Arthur cut in, “I think the boys are old enough to feed themselves.”
Harry carefully removed his finger and crawled over Draco, wiping his face before kissing him. “Are you sure?”
Looking up, Harry’s gaze skimmed over the table, seeing everyone who used to be there, who he still wanted there. Sirius sat at that end, Remus next to him. Tonks and Moody there. Putting his hand on the table, he closed his eyes, head dropping back.
this. “Say my name, Draco.”
Harry’s lips parted on panted breaths. His fingers going slack and releasing the gold ball he still clutched. His mind flashed back to Draco’s hair falling into his face the night before, the way it glimmered in the streetlights, how badly he’d wanted to brush it back out of his face. He suddenly wondered if it fell across his face like that in his sleep. Sucking in a hard breath, he shook his head, pretty sure that hadn’t been the thoughts his admirer expected. Still.
Harry nodded. “Great. I’ll be back, then.”
Harry grinned, sending Grinch out one last time before getting ready to leave:
Draco’s mouth worked for a moment; then, he nodded. “I like tacos.”
Potter’s face lit up at the mention of his prize, but he shook his head, “If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. I mean, if you’re not flying anymore.”
Draco’s flush and smile were worth feeling a bit cheesy. Wanting to keep their night from going too dark, Harry nipped Draco’s knuckles, making him gasp, and released his hand. “So, where did you learn to cook? I’ve always wondered if it was like making potions.”
There was a thunk, and he looked up to see Potter had dropped his broom, a strange, twisted look on his face, as if he, too, were suddenly back in the room. He stepped forward and drug Draco into a tight hug, face buried against his neck, shockingly intimate and similar to how Draco had clung to him all those years ago. “I know. It was hard for me, too, but I had the Weasley’s to fly with, to remind me. I hadn’t thought that you’d….I didn’t think about you. The real you and not the school bully. I’m sorry. I should have known. We’ll fly some more, just us, before we play a game with the others, okay?”
“Come back to my place?” Harry’s words were murmured against Draco’s mouth, making Draco shiver as he nodded. With a pop, they apparated back to Harry’s house.
Harry hugged him, nodding. “I understand. I knew you weren’t out to them before I kissed you, and I know it can be hard to be tell your family, especially when they aren’t supportive. I haven’t told the Dursley’s.”
“I’m sorry for that. I know my mother loved me, loves me. I shouldn’t complain, not with all I was given, how much I was coddled.”
“Hey, I just sent them over.” Draco smirked, undoing the paper on his present. “You get to do the rest.”
“I did. I just also thought you were a git.” Harry laughed as Draco elbowed him in the stomach and pulled away.
“Cho!” She stopped rambling as Harry cut in loudly. “I have no issue with you and Ginny dating. I never did. Why would you think that?”
“What do you mean? Potter? Harry!”
Harry looked a bit ill at ease at that comment. “I mean, we’re not running about monitoring your every move or anything, but we do pay attention to who seems to have changed for real and who’s faking it because it’s fashionable to do so.”
Teddy let go of Harry to hug Draco’s neck, begging, “Please, please, please.”
Draco laughed, the sound sleep-rough, and nodded. “Neilson’s Helios Overture. It’s a good morning song and has a soft build. I don’t like to wake up too harshly.” He frowned, continuing slowly, “When he, Vold—, the Dark Lord, and Aunt Bella lived at the Manor, they’d.”
“They said you were still here. I wanted to invite you to mine for dinner. I’m making fish. Heard it went well with white wine.” He winked.
“You’re such a punk.” Harry laughed and nudged Draco with his shoulder as they headed to meet up with Weas…Ron, for lunch on Diagon Alley.
“Why? Why is it so important to you?” Draco’s voice was soft, hoarse, pitched so low Harry couldn’t have heard him had he not been so close.
“Nonsense. This one’s so caught up in work all the time. I bet you’re just the same. Won’t do.” She ushered them both to the table. “I’ve got a berry crisp for dessert, but I’ll put some cookies on to bake and send home with you.”
“I kissed you weeks ago!”
“Show me yours? Where is your constellation?”
Sirius made a face. “Why are you so smart?”
“I’ve got yours under the tree.” Grinning, Harry kissed Draco and tugged him inside. “Come on. I don’t want dinner to burn.”
“He’s so much like his mother.” Andromeda smiled, wiping tears from her eyes and hugging Harry as Teddy took off for another run. “Thank you. Oh, and I had Trinket package up some food for you to take home.”
“Lights.”
“I’m a Slytherin.” Draco shrugged, grinning.
Understanding registered on Draco’s face, and he nodded. “One moment.” He went down the hall of the flat then came back, slippers on, two pairs of binoculars and his wand in hand. “I’ll use a warming charm. Come along.”
“You are straight. You are a Malfoy!” Lucius’s voice all but crackled with barely restrained anger, his hands clenched, arms halfway raised.
Grinch woke Harry by hopping around on his pillow and nipping at his ear.
“I love you, too.” Draco’s voice broke on a whine, and he arched, squeezing around Harry’s fingers. “Please, Harry.”
Harry nodded jerkily. “Thank you, baby. Are you okay going upstairs while I put everything up, or would you rather us go together?”
Malfoy shrugged, hands sliding into the pockets of his back slacks, his outer robes hung over his arm. “I don’t do much for the holidays, usually. Tend to work.” He cleared his throat. “Most the rest of my department has a family at home.”
“No, no. Let me finish. I’m pretty sure Draco is why you’ve been happier, and I want you to know that that’s okay. Not as in I get to decide what’s okay for you and what’s not, but I don’t want you to think you need to hide it or him because of us or from us. I want you to be happy, we all do, and if Draco makes you happy, be happy.” He shrugged, smiling. “You’re my best mate, another brother. You’re our family, and if you like him, we’ll give him a shot. Besides, he seems like an okay sort of prat, nowadays.”
“I don’t care. You look hot in it, and I’m sure Molly will appreciate you not dressing like a hooligan.”
Harry laughed, “I’d pay to see your father’s face when he read that note.”
“When I started dating someone who reminded to me to be reasonable and be happy.”
Laughing, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. “Not as impressive as if he had a broken arm or caught it in his mouth, but yeah, he did good.”
Confused, Draco took the paper that was thrust at him, opening the wrinkled pages to see a front page spread of him and Potter kissing the night before. Apparently, there had been a reporter, or at least someone with a wizarding camera, in the gardens. The image showed the two of them smiling at one another, their affection and arousal plain on their faces, then leaning into an intense kiss.
“You and me?”
People still stared at they walked through, but it was surprisingly less blatant than Harry had expected, and no one said anything rude. He was used to the looks by this time, but he knew Draco was far less ostentatious than he’d been in school, more nervous about stares in public. They got drinks, nachos, and a couple bags of candy then walked toward their seats.
“No. I’m no—okay, I might.”
“Basically.” Harry flushed, rubbing the hand not holding Draco’s over his face. “Would you feel better if I asked specifically?”
Draco nodded, face still hot. “Yes, I’m okay with you touching me all you want.”
to go in, but I want to go check the project. That’s why you always see me on my days off. I enjoyed today, too.” He hesitated a moment, then leaned forward to kiss Harry’s cheek. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Harry.”
“It would be a bit hard to see his face and be the boyfriend I was bailing on them for.” Draco’s voice was amused, but he still rolled his eyes.
“I’ll let you if means you trust me again.”
Draco smiled at him, a proper smile, no hint of a smirk, and Harry felt his stomach and heart switch places. “First, your work is not the same as mine, and second, you said you had a difficult day.” He shrugged, swirling the noodles using a fork and spoon and taking a neat bite. “If talking about it would help, I’m here to listen.”
Those trials saw Draco’s father imprisoned. However, thanks to Potter’s stepping in and speaking up for them, Narcissa was released to house arrest, and Draco had then been given control of the Malfoy estate and finances and probation. Draco had then spoken at many of the hearings involving other pureblood families and their involvement in the war, pushing for rehab and guidance for the children of those families, wanting to give them a chance he’d never had.
They both looked up, Draco’s face going darker. “I didn’t know that was there.”
“Harry!”
“To deserve it from you.”
Not much of a wine drinker, Harry lifted the bottle to read the label, but Domaine de la Romanee-Conti meant nothing to him. He popped the cork and poured a glass, thinking Malfoy would probably understand the significance. The robust flavor was nice, though, and it paired nicely with his steak, even to his untrained tongue.
Harry grinned, his head cocked to the side and a thick lock of sweaty hair falling in his face as he looked up at Draco. “Yeah. You did.”
Harry and Draco weren’t able to see each other much over the next few days. Draco started the next round of testing for his potions project, and Harry ended up being sent out with a small group of Aurors to bust the toy-scalping network they’d been tracking before Christmas. He made it back the night before the big game, though, and sent an owl to Draco right away to let him know they were still on to watch the match and to have lunch with the Weasleys. He also asked Draco to meet him at Grimmauld and apparate to the game together.
Draco snorted. “You think my family would have stood for such creatures in our precious flower beds? And any food gardens like this were kept far away from where I could be exposed to them. I went berry picking once. A wife of some diplomat father was schmoozing took me and their kids. My fingers were stained blue and purple, and I thought mother would have a heart attack.”
Harry frowned, reaching out to grab Draco’s arm as he started to stand. “Why aren’t you coming with us? I want you to come with us.”
Draco flushed as he caught Harry’s eye, but not from pride or exertion this time. “I think I’m ready to join your friends, if you really think they’d be okay with me.”
“I swear, the day you told Snape not to call you sir. I’m pretty sure I gave myself a hernia trying not to laugh.”
Remus stood and headed for the kitchen, leaving Sirius whining at losing contact. “I’m going to start the tea.”
Sirius sat up and cupped his boyfriend’s face, kissing along his jaw. “Hey. It’s okay. It was a scary time, and we were so young. We both made mistakes, both tried to do what was best for everyone else because we didn’t think we deserved what we had.” He smiled as Remus lifted his head, eyes watering. “I’ve never blamed you. I promise.”
Harry had spent his lunch hour at his desk, writing and revising more letters than he cared to admit, trying to figure out what he should ask that would let him learn about who was writing him without forcing the other man’s hand. Finally, he sent Grinch off again.
“Hey, hey, hey.” Harry pulled Draco’s hands away and kissed his nose. “I’m not mad or taking the piss or something. It’s fine. There’s nothing wrong with being a virgin, and you don’t need to defend yourself to me. It just means I need to be.” He waved one hand in a circle. “Nicer? Slower? Not an asshole.”
Harry just kept grinning, hand light rubbing his belly, and nodded. “Fire away.”
“Is that a baby dragon in a onsie?”
The blond sighed, “Harry.”
“Come home with me? We’ve got lunch with my family tomorrow, anyways.”
Harry smiled back, kissing Draco. “So, we plant some bushes and get a gnome.”
Eventually, the two woke again, lounging wrapped up in each other until Harry’s stomach growled loudly. Laughing, they finally made it out of bed and down to the kitchen for tea and toast, trading kisses as they talked.
Harry kicked his ankle lightly under the table. “I liked what you made. I just have more experience. Aunt Petunia had me in the kitchen cooking as soon as I could see over the stove top.”
The owl looked up at his cough-that-was-not-a-sob and fluttered back over to the desk, poking around a candy dish before pulling out a peppermint chew and hopping over to nudge it at Harry. Without thinking, Harry opened the treat and popped it in his mouth, grimacing when he bit down and remembered he hated peppermint, how strong it was in things like this, but the owl was watching him, so he dutifully finished the treat, smiling as the tiny thing fluffed and hooted happily, giant eyes squinting shut, when he swallowed it down.
“Hairy Pupper! No!”
Seamus gaped for a moment, then laughed so hard he almost fell off his broom. “You are fit for a git, but I’m still going to need you to find that snitch.”
“Not all memories are bad.”
He grinned. They were cousins. “Right, right. All that inbreeding you mentioned.”
Draco swallowed and nodded. “Waffles.” Harry laughed, nodding politely to the waitress who brought Draco his usual cup of earl grey, asking if he wanted his usual breakfast. “Um, no. I, uh, I’d like to try your…the waffles?” Harry laughed harder as Draco asked more than stated his order, handing over a menu opened to the waffle page. Everything sounded very sweet, but he pointed. “The rhubarb and custard waffles. Please. Side of bacon.”
Blushing, Draco looked over as Harry poked his head back inside, tugging the sheets up over his chest, but the brunette just walked over and kissed him. “I’ve got breakfast started, if you’re hungry.”
“I’m having a baby, technically, but he’s been good about bringing me pickles and treacle pudding.”
Harry kissed him again, shaking his head and guiding Draco backwards. “No shouldn’ts. Just us. What we want.” His teeth raked along Draco’s jaw, and he nuzzled back to the sensitive place under his ear, the one that made the blond whine, all high-pitched and shivery. “And I missed you, too. These damn clothes, that damn bed. It wasn’t warm with you anymore.” He caught Draco around the waist, lifting him and tossing him back onto the bed. “I’ve been sleeping on the couch.”
Draco looked thinner than Harry remembered, gaunt, but his pale hair gleamed in the soft light of his professor’s chambers as Harry stepped through the floo. Harry wanted to rush forward, hug, touch, assure himself that the other man was really near him again, but Sirius had warned him not to do that, to let Draco guide how they proceeded.
Smiling, Harry cupped Draco’s face, leaning forward and pressing his lips against his cheek, kissing back toward his ear to murmur. “I don’t want our first kiss forced and in front of Teddy. Not our first real kiss, at least.” Letting go of Draco, noting that the flush on his face had gone splotchy and he was biting his lip, Harry trailed his thumb over Draco’s jaw, tightening his hand briefly to squeeze the side of his neck, then stepped back. “What would you?” He stopped, Teddy already asleep in front of the fire. Harry laughed. “Guess I’ll owl Andromeda, tell her not to worry about him.”
Ron also took a little time to come around to Draco’s presence, but almost like a switch flipped, he one day started acting like they were best mates and not former enemies. Draco and Harry were actually on their way to meet Ron for lunch at a café next to WWW.
“You were a child. Scared and forced to survive as best you could.” Harry squeezed his hand. “I know it’s still lonely to be Draco Malfoy. That it feels like you’ll always be suspect. But you’re not. It might be a bit awkward at first, but once they get to know you, know
“Fuck, baby, you’re so beautiful.” Harry murmured another spell as he slid his fingers down Draco’s ass, pressing them against him until he found his hole. When Draco widened his stance to allow better access, Harry nipped his ear, growling. “So needy for it aren’t you?”
Hermione raised a brow, giving Draco’s haughty look a run for its money. “We both know that had your name and money not been behind it, the idea would have died before anyone in the Ministry even knew it existed. Plus, you freeing all your house elves after the war and then hiring the ones who wanted to return and work for your family, giving them a comfortable living area and the promise of no more punishments, set a standard for everyone else.”
“That’s not the point, Harry.”
“I let in Greyback, when he…”
Draco relaxed visibly and nodded. “Yes, space is nice.”
Remus chuckled along, setting the tea, some biscuits, and a few sandwiches on the table. “Eat up and tell us how work has been for the two of you. Draco, you’ve accepted the position at Hogwarts, correct?”
“I know.” Draco’s hands slid up Harry’s back, fingers digging into his shoulders. “But I need. Is that a problem for you?”
“Liar. Come on. I’m starved, and this place is great. Plus, we’ve only got about fifteen minutes before Hermione starts ranting about work again.”
Confused, Draco picked up a page, his gaze skimming over it as he started to call out to Harry and ask what this mean, but his words died in his throat as he read the notes, scrawled in Harry’s messy script:
“I’m not! I’m sorry. I just, you were so confident that you were going to kick my ass, and you were good in school. I don’t know; I guess I expected different.”
“Oh!” Harry flushed, clearing his throat twice before continuing to speak. “Uh, yeah. This is…this is Grinch. He’s. He was a gift.”
Draco stepped forward to kiss him again, this time softer, sweeter. “Yes, we’re dating. And I’ve been swept up by your chaos, as you say, since we were eleven. At least now, I’m getting swept up by you, too.”
Harry pulled Draco into a one-armed hug, rubbing his back. “Yeah, but you do have damn good taste in clothes. That much as always true.”
“I was actually going to see if you wanted to eat together, first.” He nodded to where Ron was sitting across from Harry at the desk. “I see you have plans, though.”
He shook his head. “No. I mean, I don’t care if they get mad. I know they hate me. But if I didn’t have the Weasley’s.” He shrugged. “It might be really different for me. I don’t want to push to do anything you aren’t ready for.”
Harry swallowed hard, coughing as he did, unable to meet her gaze for a moment, then nodded. “Thank you. I’d like that.”
Draco laughed and shook his head. “No, but I suppose you’re just as excited about Teddy’s gift as he will be.” Harry paused for a moment, realizing both of them were in the children’s broom section and both planned to buy for Teddy. Before he could speak, Draco touched his arm. “Relax, Pot—” he cleared his throat. “Relax, Harry. I know how important it is to you to get him a broom. I wouldn’t take that from you. I’m looking for a learner’s cleaning kit to compliment it.” Harry smiled, head tilted to the side, and Draco flushed, looking down and away. “Mother always said that it was custom in the Black family for a godfather to buy the first broom.”
“Yes.” Putting away the box and tugging Harry closer, Draco crashed their lips together, hands sliding under his shirt to flatten against his back.
Draco never looked up. “You kind of are, but that’s just because we’re in a hinky phase of potion creation.”
“Waffles?”
Harry grinned and grabbed his cloak. “Great. I’m starving.”
A few minutes later, Draco entered, unwrapped his scarf. “I got your letter, Potter, I’m supposed to be at work.
Once the letter was finished, Draco said, “Now, what my mother had me do, when I was little, was fold it up, like this.” He helped Teddy start to carefully crease the paper into an intricate pattern. “Then, you’ll have a little pouch 0n the front. You put a pinch of floo powder in the pouch, write Santa on the front, and toss it into the fire.”
maudlin.”
Harry turned another page and saw a muggle picture of his mother and a little boy with greasy hair and a thin face. The writing underneath it was the same neat script of the daily letters.
By the time he clocked out, he was frustrated, had a gash through one eyebrow from the training course, and was running late. He wasted about one second thinking he should reschedule with Draco before tossing that idea. He floo’d home long enough change into pressed slacks and a dark green button down and cast a cleaning charm over himself, then apparated to lobby of Draco’s building. The old hotel had been refurbished using wizarding space to create flats. Running his hands over his hair to flatten it, he crossed to the elevators. He paced the confines, shaking his hands and blowing out a hard breath.
Draco nodded, putting his things with Teddy’s before going to get the materials. They sat together at the kitchen table, speaking the letter out loud as they composed it, and Harry joined them once he had the hot chocolate ready and had plated the leftover parts of the gingerbread house.
Harry frowned, shoving his hands in his pockets. “Um. Okay?”
“That I’ve succeeded in failing my father in the best way possible.”
All that muscle didn’t necessarily make Harry big, more like a medium to Draco’s small, but he was toned and tanned enough that Draco’s mouth watered. He reminded himself that both men Harry had dated publicly, Oliver and then a beater from the Bats, had been bigger built men. And he’d recently been linked in the media to Tamsin Applebee, a chaser for the same team Oliver played on. He shoved those thoughts down before they could turn into blushing or drooling or both.
Draco somehow went numb from head to toe while also feeling himself shake all over as he watched Harry step out of the fireplace. His dark skin had a paler to it, and there were dark circles under his eyes. His hair seemed to stand out from his head in all directions, almost as if he’d attempted to yank it out before arriving.
“I…I just can’t, Grinch. I’m not….” He sighed and looked over. “I can’t.” He hadn’t expected the owl to understand, could all but see the want to go with him radiating off the animal, but Grinch had simply stared back for long minutes before hopping over to his pear tree and hooting once more.
Reaching out, he cupped Draco’s face, leaning in to brush their noses together, giving Draco time to say no, then pressed their lips together. A light press, warmth of their breath mixing, hint of mint from where Draco had brushed his teeth before Harry came over. It was perfect. Draco’s lips melded just right against his, the catch his breath matching the hitch in Harry’s heartbeat.
“Harry.”
Draco tried to smother his laughter, but he ended snorting and doubling over with it as Harry dropped his head to the table.
Draco looked at him, biting his lips as they began to curve upward.
That night, after wrapping his gifts and dinning on leftovers and the last of his fancy wine, Harry went to bed in his potions socks. He couldn’t help thinking about his admirer, their notes, the clues. Someone who was with him in school, all seven years to have been able to plan those socks. And even the idea of getting him socks, that bond with Dobby. They worked with him, knew when he’d be shopping. Were cousins with Sirius. He fell asleep smiling, thoughts of soft smiles, soft grey eyes, and soft touches filling his mind.
“I’m pretty sure it’s the other way around, but yeah, we’re coming.”
Now, he held letters from both of his previous professors. Draco finally cracked the seals, crying as he read the letters. One said he’d passed his final set of exams and was a full potions master, and the other extended an offer for the position as professor at Hogwarts, allowing Slughorn to return to his retirement.
Draco frowned, “Not adults? Is it because they don’t get gifts?”
“It’s fine, really. It’s late. We’re all ready to be home.”
“Hey! I didn’t know you liked Indian.” He nodded at Draco’s plate. “How spicy?”
Draco answered, hair damp and curling around his face, dressed in green plaid pajama pants and a soft tee in a matching green. “Harry? What’s wrong?”
Harry flushed and nodded, fingers carding into and tugging at his hair for a moment. “Yeah. I, uh. I’ve been wearing it a lot. I never meant for things to go as far as they did.” He flinched and shook his head. “With the case. I mean. I wanted things with you to go that far. Farther. As far as we can go, really.” He seemed to realize that his words weren’t necessarily soothing Draco, and shook his head. “I thought it was stupid when they first assigned you to me, asking to check out that you were safe. Obviously, you’re not a threat to anyone, not anymore. I don’t understand why some of the higher ups can’t get that through their head. It’s why I volunteered to take your case.”
Harry smiled, wiping his eyes as he was crying again, and set the notes aside, minus Molly. Scribbling back that it wasn’t him but he could pass the message on, he then asked for a favor.
Draco laughed softly, clearing his throat and looking up at Harry. “You’re not an asshole. And I’m not against sex. It just. I don’t know. I guess I feel weird, still being a virgin at my age.”
Thus, Draco found himself pacing his living room on Saturday night. He was dressed in dark charcoal slacks and a matching waistcoat over a blue-grey button-up, an outfit he knew emphasized his coloring and how lithe his body was overall. He was still nervous, though. Harry had said to look nice, but he worried he looked too nice. What was nice according to Harry Potter’s standards?
Harry was smiling when he arrived at work, and even though he was sent back out to the Alleys at least a dozen times throughout the day, working through his lunch break, he continued to smile. Furthermore, it seemed as if each of the scrimmages with angry parents and panicked shoppers seemed to go more smoothly, end with less fuss and fight.
Sirius nodded, “You have. In more ways than you know.”
Potter just grinned and took a large bite. “Awesome. I hate to cook, so I love anything that’s good warmed up.”
“You’ve done a lot of that. I mean, you tend to stay in the background of all the charity work you do, mostly putting your face and name out in public as proof that you’re going a different route than for clout, but you’ve made a lot of changes. For you and the wizarding world.”
with the spare quidditch ticket attached to the bottom.
Malfoy’s eyes went wide, the grey standing out starkly as his face went pink. Harry grinned, inordinately pleased at making Malfoy blush, and this time, he held the door as Malfoy had to collect himself before exiting. They crossed the atrium side by side, and Harry grinned over at Malfoy. “I’ll see you Monday. Have a good weekend.”
Draco and Harry had been spending time with each other for months, but they were finally going on their first official date. Before leaving Remus and Sirius after dinner the a few nights ago night, the third time they’d visited together, Sirius had asked just how long they’d actually been dating. Harry had responded, “Since June, really,” at the same time Draco said, “We’ve never gone on actual date.”
Harry’s hands on the fly of his slacks, however, had him snapping back to attention. Draco could feel his whole body blush as he pushed against Harry’s chest, unable to meet his gaze. “I…I’ve never…I’ve never.”
Cho giggled, nodding, “Same. That’s one way to toast someone’s memory, right?”
“What if you came along?” Harry realized he’d spoken aloud when Teddy cheered and Draco gaped at him. “I mean, if you’re hungry, too, and we’re all going home to eat, why not come eat with us?”
Harry looked over, smiling slightly. “Yeah. Yeah, mine, too. That’s really nice of you.”
Draco had pale grey slacks and a blue sweater, both accentuating his coloring and long, thin frame. The sleeves were pushed up almost to his elbows, something that Harry knew rarely happened when he was around anyone. “You’re late, Potter.”
Draco shuddered. “Yes.”
“Yeah, but I love him more.”
“Weight my left ass cheek!” Harry pulled up his shirt, showing off a well-defined six pack. “I worked hard to put on this muscle.”
Draco’s chin wobbled for a brief moment; then, he smiled and nodded. Face turning pink as his smile became a grin so wide it hurt. “Yeah. Okay.”
That statement led to events that made them even later and required several straightening charms on their hair and clothes, though they seemed to do nothing for Harry's hair.
“Fuck, I’ve imagined you sounding like that, for me, for years.” Draco worked his hand over Harry’s length, kissing along the crease of his thigh. “I want to hear my name on your lips when you fall apart, though.” Widening the stance of his knees, he angled his head and took Harry all the way to the root, letting Harry slide into his throat, free hand rolling and tugging his balls.
Harry nodded and grimaced, “Yeah, no. I, uh. I just forgot something in my office, and it couldn’t wait until Monday.”
When Harry J. Potter walked into his office the morning of Thursday December 12th, he was less than happy, to say the least. A cold, grey slush seemed to be drizzling steadily down from the sky, and the Christmas rush and bustle made everyone even more haggard and less cheerful than usual. He was expecting that same demanding and shitty attitude to start bleeding into the Auror office any day.
She nodded, “Yeah, but Yaxley Rosier is causing problems.”
“You go ahead. I get him next.”
“Rotten brother! Here I thought my new baby would be the biggest announcement.”
“Kind of. Frustrating. We almost fucked up a really important case, and just.” He sighed, squeezing. “Thank you.”
“If you need anything, please know that my office is always open. I don’t want to push, but we are coworkers and, I’d like to think, friends.” She smiled at him. “And friends are willing to listen when one needs an ear.”
Harry scowled and shoved him, pouting at his godfather. “Why can’t I borrow the first editions?”
Draco flushed, gaze darting to the two older men who both grinned as they watched them, and muttered, “Wish you’d thought that in school.”
“Thank you. I wondered. If you wouldn’t mind.”
The next day, he dressed in the jeans Oliver used to hate because he claimed they made everyone stare at Harry’s ass, he wanted Draco staring at his ass, but wobbled between two shirts. Should he wear the super soft, comfortable t-shirt that supported the Arrows or the green button-up that Draco always commented on as being nice and matching his eyes. He was still trying to decide when the wards flared, letting him know Draco had arrived. Jogging downstairs shirtless, he felt like an idiot but still stopped in the doorway to the living room holding up the two shirts. “Which one?”
Harry woke to someone banging on his front door. Groggy, he stumbled down the stairs and pulled the front door open, not sure why Kreatcher hadn’t answered. He usually insisted on it. Standing on the front porch was a tall, hunchbacked man with a hook nose and a….
“Then, name the time and day. Like I said at the Ministry, we can be a bit much all together, but we’re here for you.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder then pulled him into a hug. “Now, let’s go eat before George takes all the best bits.”
Draco put a hand over Harry’s mouth. “I’m a control freak. I don’t
Hands shaking, he sat on the plush couch that took up most of the living area of his flat and stared at the letting that his owl had just brought him. Snitch perched just behind Draco’s shoulder, the golden barn owl surprisingly quiet instead of demanding treats, as if she realized her owner’s emotional state. He hadn’t been this nervous since the trails after the war ended.
“I know this one.”
Setting the box carefully to one side, Draco leaned across the couch to pull Harry into a kiss. “I love it. I’ve been wondering if wands and cores and potions were intertwined, but I haven’t been able to test that, and now this, and it’s perfect. I love it, and I love you.” He sucked in a breath, having not meant to push that on Harry so quickly, but he was tired of hiding how he felt from everyone, even himself. “I love you.”
“Yes, I can.”
Harry smiled. “I have an idea about that.”
It had taken even longer for this reply to come.
“Draco, Santa isn’t real. At least not for muggles. I’m sure there’s a wizard somewhere that crawled up and down chimneys passing out gifts.”
Grinch seemed to vibrate around the desk, excited fluttering and chirping filling the room.
“You already know it’s a girl?” Harry looked over, noticing that Hermione’s stomach barely even curved enough to notice. Had he not known she was pregnant, he’d have never guessed it. “It is not too early to tell?”
Harry smiled and nodded. “Of course, baby. I’ll be right there.”
When his alarm woke him on Saturday morning, bright and early for the daily runs he demanded of himself, he snarled and contemplated throwing a well-aimed incendio at it. As he rolled to quite the sound, though, he noticed a tray next to his bed. Kreatcher knew he wouldn’t eat until after he returned from his run, so the plate of food under a stasis charm was highly out-of-place. Sitting up, Harry removed the charm and groaned as the scents assailed him, pulling the tray into his lap. It was piled high with cinnamon rolls, bacon and sausage, and fresh fruit, and when he tried the coffee, it was perfect. Just the right temperature and the right amount of milk to take the bite out of the bitterness. Even better, when he allowed himself a small taste of a roll, he realized that rather than being regular cinnamon rolls, they were flavored with…
Teddy grinned and nodded wide, saying he knew exactly what to get. Shortly thereafter, they headed to the nearest safe apparition point and made their way to Diagon Alley. Holding tight to Teddy’s hand, Harry let the little boy lead him to Quality Quidditch Supplies. They found Draco’s gift pretty quickly but spent another half hour looking around at the newest quidditch supplies. Teddy was just starting to get interested in the sport, and he changed his hair to match every team jersey they passed, making Harry laugh and call him a Weasley when he changed his hair to orange for the Canons.
Draco nodded at his mother. “I did. I wanted to make you proud.” He shook his head, “But I’m not straight. And I care for Harry.”
Draco’s own broom slipped from his shaking fingers, and he couldn’t answer. All he could do was nod and wrap his own arms around Potter. Harry.
“They threw me out.” Harry froze as Draco continued. “Said I had to choose between loving you and being their son, but…” He shook his head, “That’s not fair. That’s not a choice. I should be allowed to love whoever I want.” He swallowed, tears running down his cheeks. “I should be allowed to love you.”
He jolted when he realized Dra-Malfoy had spoken. “Huh? What?”
Harry flushed and nodded, tossing the green shirt aside and pulling on the tee then Sirius’s old leather jacket. “So, I kind of wondered. Well. I wanted to meet here to talk about.” Harry sighed then sucked in a breath. “I know dating me means getting swept up by my chaos and people following and staring and wanting pictures and stuff, and I wondered if you were okay with that? I mean, if we go out today and act like we’re going out. Hell, we’re going to have people talking if we go out as friends, I know that, and I’m sorry if it bothers you, but if we act like we’re dating, they’re going to say even more.” He ran his hands through his hair. “I’m happy to be dating, and I’d gladly tell the world that I’m dating you, but if you’re not comfortable with that kind of attention…” He trailed off as he noticed Draco’s cheeks turning brighter as he started to smile.
“Come on. You head upstairs and wash your face. There’s a headache potion in the cabinet if you need it. I’ll put everything up and meet you there.”
Draco blushed but let himself be pulled against Harry’s chest. “I’d rather share it with friends than what’s left of my family.”
“Master Harry’s letter was next to his bed. Did he not read it before going on his run?”
“We have a date planned. Well, I have a date planned, he has to agree, for that Friday. Sunday dinner here?”
For once, though, the fact that this owl wasn’t
Harry and Teddy both looked up at Draco expectantly. “We ask the house elf, that’s how.”
Andromeda verified that she’d be there to pick Teddy up after dinner then hugged them both before leaving.
Harry laced their fingers together and tugged him into continuing their walk. They rounded the corner a few minutes later and came into sight of Ron and Hermione, only for Ron to let out a bark of laughter that echoed down the street, making several people stop and stare.
Their lips met, heat blooming. Draco pulled his wand out to wave it at the kitchen while muttering a stasis charm before pushing Harry toward the bedroom. Harry kissed Draco again, fingers working at the buttons of his shirt, pausing as Draco tumbled backward onto the bed. Kneeling on the bed, he finished removing the shirt, lips trailing over Draco’s throat, chest, down his stomach.
Draco made a noise somewhere between a whine and a groan but nodded, putting his coat on. Once all three were ready, Harry picked up Teddy and stepped next to Draco, the two of them reaching out to take the portkey. With a squeeze and jerk from behind their navels, they found themselves in a snow-covered park next to a horse-drawn sleigh.
“There’s another letter, Uncle Harry!” Teddy climbed up at the table and pulled the letter over, opening it. “It says we need to write a letter to Santa and make milk and cookies to leave for him.”
Harry swallowed hard, tears running down his cheeks. “I love him, too. He mentioned that he’d been afraid.” Harry flushed but made himself continue. “to get physical until he was able to admit his feelings. I think I was afraid to admit my feelings until I’d ended the case.” He sighed. “I think I knew I was lying, to an extent. Gods, I fucked up.”
Finally, Teddy launched himself at Draco’s legs but was too small to knock the man over. Giggling, he looked over at Harry, calling for help.
Wiping his eyes, he read the letter again. He didn’t deserve Harry’s love, didn’t deserve to belong to someone so wonderful, but somehow, it seemed that he did.
Sirius laughed softly, hugging his fiancé. “For starters, he apologized. A lot. Then, he learned to think and act like someone with a future and something to lose.” He laced their fingers together, kissing the ring that showed their promise to each other.
“Please tell me you laid into whoever messed that up with every bit of pissy sass you used on me?” He started to tug his sleeve down.
Draco felt his eyes water again and cleared his throat roughly, scrubbing his face. “I might take you up on that. Thank you.”
Grinch came back as Harry locked up. No note. Harry just laughed again, petting the little bird and heading home. He was disappointed that he didn’t see Draco on his way out.
“Honestly, the ones ripped off by scalpers were nicer.”
Draco nodded rapidly.
So, normally I would not be posting two chapters in one day, but I miscounted on what day to start. Thus, two today to catch up for tomorrow.
Harry kissed his way up Draco’s body as the blond man collapsed against the bed, panting for breath. His engorged shaft pressed against Draco’s hip, so he reached down, wrapping his hand around that thickness, thumb rolling over the head. Harry groaned and thrust against Draco’s fist, and he twisted his wrist every time the other man’s hips pulled back. With a moan, their lips met messily, sweaty bodies undulating into one another.
Outside of that, he was polite if a little restrained around most people until his work ethic and skill and stopped any snide comments or angry looks. He’d even taken to joining the group for a pint on the weekends, he and Harry having hashed out their differences by coming to blows after a night they were both particularly deep in their cups. After that, though, the two got along well, building a tenuous friendship that seemed to thrive on their mutual competitive natures once they were no longer at each other’s throats.
“Yep.”
Harry and Ron nodded, waiting the few moments it took for Draco to return with Theo Nott and Gwenog Cadwallader, a Hufflepuff Chaser from their Hogwarts days. The three of them walked ahead, and Harry ran his hand over his hair, trying to flatten it out. Ron snorted and elbowed him, grinning.
Smiling, Draco carded his fingers through Harry’s hair, scratching gently and sending chills down his spine. “Should have known you’d understand. I have to get ready for work. I, uh, I have time for breakfast, though. If you’d like?”
“I thought the stirring stick and stuff matching your wand would be, I don’t know, at least cool, if not somehow helpful.”
She jolted, eyes going wide. “No, though I’m not surprised you are. You’ve both been gaga over each other since, what, first year?”
Both blushing, they stayed wrapped up, kissing off and on, until the pasta started to boil over. Laughing, Draco set the table while Harry finished making the food before they sat together.
“Oh god.” Draco shuddered, body pliant as Harry turned him, nudging him back onto the soft bed. “Strip.”
Malfoy’s smile widened, and he motioned to the bird. “You don’t normally have an owl.”
Draco leaned over Harry’s shoulder, breath ghosting over his neck for a brief moment and sending chills down his arms. “Does it come with a seatbelt?”
“Morning, Draco.” The other man raised a brow as they crossed the atrium, and Harry was beginning to realize that was a defensive mechanism, more to buy himself time to think or goad the other person into speaking first. He decided to give the man what he wanted and continue speaking. “How are you this morning?”
Harry laughed. “Yeah, I guess I just keep getting caught up in my head. Not the best habit for an Auror, huh?”
“Draco, no.” He reached over, taking the blond’s hand. “You’re welcome anywhere I am. And if you’re not welcome, then, neither am I. If you want to come, you can. It’ll be fine.”
He just shook his head.
Susan Bones laughed and shoved him as they returned from the latest fight to break out over who got the last limited-edition bit of mistletoe from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. It was charmed to follow the owner around so that anyone they came near would be “required” to kiss them. “You’re just mad because both women offered to demonstrate how it worked on you.”
Ron’s brow went from dropped over his eyes in concern to lifted almost to his hairline, gaze moving between Harry and the blond before his eyes narrowed.
