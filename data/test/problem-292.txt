So whenever Harry tried a Wronski Feint, or a Sloth Grip Roll, Draco would counter with a Wrights’ Dive, or Plumpkin’s Pull. One time in particular, Harry had been so enraptured by Draco’s movements and the ease with which he transitioned from a dive to an upward spiral that he completely forgot the snitch and instead, attempted a Wronski Feint that spiraled into a Trinkets Table just to challenge Draco into doing more tricks.
“Erm, no,” Harry answered honestly. His plan was backfiring just a little because he couldn't get his head together long enough to do anything in retaliation.
The bull pen was noisy. There were sounds of papers rustling, chairs being pushed out, and conversations being had. Each noise layered on top of one another to create the hum of an office mid-day. To Draco’s surprise, he found his partner at his desk rifling through files and making a mess of the system Draco had only just finished organising yesterday.
“You will go on this mission and you will leave the Minister happier than you found him and in the process you will do what Goyle failed to do and retrieve the journal of Vseslav of Polotsk.”
“Hey, mate. Just get here? Were you flying again?” Ron asked, keeping his gaze forward. He had a cup in his hand full of a dangerously brown liquid. His cheeks were flushed, and he seemed tired. At least his eyes were half-lidded.
“See, this is why I didn’t want to say anything.” Draco looked at Harry with profound annoyance that once might’ve been called a withering stare, but now Harry could see the affection in Draco’s eyes, he knew it wasn’t real annoyance. “It’s ridiculous, obviously. We’re friends, right, and it would mess all that up when it ended up being a terrible idea. And that’s assuming you’d want to kiss me back. Merlin, I hadn’t even considered you wouldn’t want to kiss me back. How horribly vain.”
“Harry, how are you?” Draco asked, letting his hand drop to his side. He clenched and unclenched his fist a few times before putting his hand casually into the pocket of his gray trousers.
For a while, they all exchanged stories. Nikola spent some time relaying the Russian Minister’s ascension to power, which much like the Dark Lord’s, involved overthrowing the previous government officials. According to Nikola, the Russian Minister thought the previous government was getting too lax in their laws about whether or not Muggles were allowed to know about magic.
“Merlin, yes,” Harry reflected. Each Quidditch practice had refueled his attraction like his body was a sponge soaking up every part of their interactions. He felt alive with it, but there was the one minor problem, “Or at least I thought it was until I found out he was dating some bloke named, Quinten Fairchild who works with Neville at the greenhouse.”
Harry’s eyes went wide at the last word. His heart quickened pace and he felt his mouth go a little dry. Instinctively, he licked his bottom lip and managed to maintain eye contact with Malfoy as he did it and Harry could tell Malfoy was turned on by it because his pupil’s dilated and he bit his lower lip.
Draco smiled again, this time it seemed forced and completely for Harry’s benefit. “This is terribly awkward, but I actually have something to ask you.”
I opted for an all black suit over a black shirt with a black tie, as it was a memorial service and black felt right for the day in more ways than one. This time of the year always made me feel anxious like everything was just off center from what it was supposed to be, highlighting all the shitty stuff I tried to ignore year round. It didn’t help that Ron and Hermione’s concerned looks nearly tripled in the last two months leading up to my hearing. It made it difficult to pretend everything was okay when someone watched, or judged, your every step.
He remembered how she sat there reading to him while he sat under the table and leaned against her legs. She would place a hand on the crown of his head and ruffle his hair whenever the tension in the story rose. The memory turned sour quickly when he herd footsteps approaching from behind him.
I could feel the pulse of my magic under my skin again. Seems being sober meant feeling every bit of my magic under my skin like electricity. “You’re the twat.”
Harry felt a rush of heat hit his face. Malfoy had asked to be reassigned because he thought Harry didn’t reciprocate his feelings.
In this mood, he didn’t want to face Potter right away, so he stopped off in Granger’s cell first. She was erratic and attempted to swing at Draco but gave up when he cast a binding spell that pulled her back into the wall.
Pansy licked her bottom lip, put down the file in her hand, and walked around the metal work table that held all manner of bubbling potions, some blue, other’s a sickly yellow, a few of them a verdant green that reminded Draco of Potter’s eyes. She came to stand directly in front of Potter and said, “It’s not ready. I told Robards we need another day to test the effects on a human subject.”
Ned put a hand up to block Malfoy from passing him. “Wait, uh, this is going to sound very forward, and it is, but how would you react if I asked you out?”
Malfoy stammered, managed to plaster on one of his cocksure smirks and said, “It makes sense, really. A witch who was willing to give up everything for immortality wouldn't actually want to owe her soul to anyone.” Malfoy took a breath and continued, “Naturally, you would have been working out how to avoid the call when it came. I know that’s what I would have done, figuring you had at least a few centuries to figure out a loophole before your number was up. Nothing panned out, so now you’re scrambling for something. You searched everywhere, but the only loophole you can think of is binding yourself to earth. But you can’t cast on your own, so you need magic, and lots of it, to manage it.” He pointed to the candles, all of which still burned brightly.
him. Shaking that thought from his brain, Harry turned his attention back on Ron. “Remember the time Hermione made us study the map of Ley Lines and the major nexuses in England just in case they appeared on the N.E.W.T.s? And then when they didn’t, she tried to explain why we were better off for having the knowledge and should thank her instead of being angry that we wasted a whole weekend?”
“Is it? Hermione says I’m too harsh.” Potter looked delighted that Draco agreed with him. His face lit up and settled in a satisfied smirk. “She’s too concerned with what’s proper. I couldn’t give a flying hippogriff anymore.”
“There’s still some stuff we need to discuss.” Malfoy looked at him now, his smoke-grey eyes bloodshot. “Like, are we simply going to do recon?”
“These lines are terrible,” Hermione started. “I told Shacklebolt we needed to work on streamlining portkey travel.”
In the end, Draco had convinced himself to come to the party out of curiosity, that and Luna threatened to do a French braid and spell it to stay for a week unless he agreed to make an appearance. At least that's what he told himself. It was hard to lie, but between Luna’s threat, which he was sure she would make good on, and his desire to see the inside of the ship, Draco decided that had little choice but to come.
“He reminded you of yourself,” she said knowingly. “But do you think you were saving him or saving yourself?”
“We are,” Malfoy said, with a hint of amusement in his voice. “What gave it away? The ghastly robes?”
“You’re right. I don’t know what he was going through. I barely know what you wen’t through because you never talk about it, except to say that it was bad. What I do know is, if we break the law too, how are we any better than the criminals?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but didn’t protest any more. He was squatting instead of kneeling in the grass which, of course, was so very Malfoy of him to be worried about grass stains when they were about to engage in a fight.
After what Harry could only assume was the line “you would even say it glows,” he snorted in spite of his best efforts to look like he wasn't paying attention to the way Malfoy nodded his head along with the humming. The noise escaped him and echoed in the silence of the forest. It woke Hagrid, who sniffed and grunted that he hadn’t been sleeping, simply resting his eyes a bit.
A smile played at the corner of Draco’s mouth. In order to keep from smiling all the way, Draco bit his bottom lip, which Harry liked more than he wold admit. “Is that an order, Mister Potter?”
“I wonder…” I started, but trailed off. Ron wasn’t listening anymore anyway and I wasn’t sure he’d like what I was thinking. If Greyjoy had been an Unspeakable, then maybe she could help me understand these magical surges a bit more. It was normal for underage wizards to have occasional burst of magic , but there were almost triple the amount of reports these last five months. It was odd at the least and suspicious at best. I was going to have to talk to her.
Thanks to Parkinson’s potion, he was experiencing his feelings for the first time since Dean’s death, really feeling them—all of them. And it was overwhelming and confusing. He hurt all over, physically, but emotionally, too. He hadn’t let himself slow down since he lost Dean, so two years worth of emotions all skidded to a halt at once, crashing into him, with his attraction to Malfoy and guilt for being alive when Dean was dead at the forefront, both competing for top billing.
Greyjoy spoke, drawing my attention away from Malfoy who still looked in shock. “Don’t fight the visions, Harry. They will come whether you want them or not. Fighting them will only make them more debilitating when they come. You will pass out or feel ill.”
“Just fine? You call not being able to keep a partner for more than a few months just fine? You’ve had more partners in two years than most of the department’s had in fifteen.” Draco was getting dangerously close to pissing Potter off, and he knew it. Bringing up Potter’s recent stream of partners, all of whom begged for reassignment because of how difficult Potter was to work with, was a surefire way to set him off, but Draco was tired of tip-toeing around Potter’s moods.
there was time, but not if someone was in immediate danger, but lying was simpler, so he said, “Yes, we will call for backup.”
“What the...” He took a look around the room and his eyes fell on the Succubus. A scream ripped from his body.
At Dean and Seamus’s party, Harry gets distracted from his mission to sneak off and check on his lead about the magical surges by his desire for Malfoy.
Everyone else nodded politely at Draco, but no one else spoke to him. Longbottom, Finnegan, and Thomas all looked sideways at one another, probably thinking what Draco was thinking, himself. Potter is mad for bringing Draco over here.
The sound of Draco’s ragged breathing, synchronized with the bass of the music, felt like a flaming arrow shot straight into his chest. It burned through him and made his breath catch in his throat.
Draco watched as Potter unceremoniously made his way back to his cluster of mates who stood just outside of the captain's quarters on the open deck: Weasley, Granger, Girl Weasley, and the rest of the Gryffindor lot. Then laughed as if he hadn’t just mucked up Draco’s entire reality.
I was ready to kick her out but then she said, “You know, if the Ministry and Unspeakables are covering this up, there’s no telling how much else they have lied about. Isn’t it time they were held accountable for their actions?”
“Do we have to crouch back here behind the bushes with the dead birds?” Malfoy whined. He extended his umbrella charm to keep Harry from getting wet, then hit him with a drying charm for good measure.
Harry felt Draco’s hand twitch near his. Instinctively, Harry moved closer and felt the first brush of Draco’s finger on the soft skin of his arm. His body hummed contentedly like a cat purring when someone scratched behind its ear.
Harry laughed and leaned against the tree next to Draco, their shoulders touching. “You tell me yours and I’ll tell you mine.”
“I’m not even sure why I am so hurt by your words. Surely you have said worse to me. Surely I have endured worse.”
Draco smiled, and this time it did reach his eyes. “Thank you, Harry. You have no idea how much this will help.”
“Good, then go to your duties. No need to laze away the entire morning, now is there?” His father said with a flick of his wrist which meant the conversation was over. Draco watched as he stalked off, his royal blue robes whipping in the morning breeze behind him.
“Yeah. Clears my head. Especially when it’s cold out.” Harry followed his friend's gaze. It was trained on Hermione who was talking animatedly to some of the younger students. He didn’t recognize any of them. There were so many people Harry didn’t recognize, but they all knew his name, and they all came up to him like they were friends, and he was supposed to be nice to every single one of them. He wondered if he’d ever get used to that. Probably not.
“Uh, long story,” Harry said with a nonchalant flick of his wrist. This was his chance to slip it into conversation without seeming desperate,, “So, how's the new guy? Is he catching on quick enough?”
“When did you get so wise, eh?” Harry joked and felt a sudden rush of warmth as Ginny swept him into an awkward sideways hug. He could feel the heat of her breath and smell the sweet floral scent of her shampoo.
“Your unhappiness,” she snapped again, her tone heavy with the kind of quiet anger that boils to a point. “You did that yourself. You don’t get to say that now I’m happy, you can finally be happy. Like I was holding you back or something.”
Harry snorted. “Are we looking for honest answers, or am I supposed to tell you that you’re perfect the way you are so as to not hurt your fragile ego?”
Harry smiled at his friend, feeling immeasurable happiness for Neville and Luna. Two of his dearest friends had found love, and he was happy to be there to celebrate with them. Their engagement was short compared to the usual standards, and the planning almost as quick, but Harry supposed...when you know, you know. Or at least that’s what people keep telling him.
“Tea?” Greyjoy asked. She levitated the kettle and three cups. The kettle tipped itself and poured out three cups. The steam rose from them and I was reminded of the magical trace.
“Yea, loads more.” I walked forward to the grave where the caretaker died. It was at the back of the cemetery, so I couldn’t see it yet. But if the caretaker was killed with magic, I would be able to see it thanks to the potion. Finally, I could get some answers.
Instinctively, Harry’s eyes found Malfoy’s. Against the dark backdrop of the forest, Malfoy’s features were even more striking. His cheeks were rose-red and his nose, too. His pale skin shone against the night under the wash of light from his wand. Whisks of white-blonde hair slipped out from under the furred edges of his bomber hat. They hung in his eyes which were almost black, the pupils were so wide.
“Tell me the whole story,” Luna said calmly, “Take your time.” That was easy for Luna to say, but Harry felt like he was running out of time. Just yesterday the Prophet posted that article speculating about Ginny and Harry and if they had worked through their differences and decided to give it another try.
The first week as Potter’s partner had been eye-opening. Draco thought he knew the man who made school so complicated for him, but he quickly realised he was wrong. Yes, he knew parts of Potter. The obvious parts, like his annoying hero streak or his skill on a broom, but as his partner, Draco got to see the less shiny version of the famed Boy Who Lived. The Potter who left crumbs on every piece of paper he touched, the Potter who never tossed out the garbage in the bin, the Potter who didn’t care for protocol one whit. It was this Potter that Draco realised he couldn’t trust. With his history, Draco had to be better, more trustworthy, than any other Auror in the DMLE. It’s why he took his job so seriously. He wouldn’t give anyone a reason to question him.
With difficulty, Draco took in a deep breath and responded. “Surely. It must be something else entirely.”
The witch, whose name tag read Angela, looked at Malfoy cautiously and turned her eyes back to Harry. “For two?”
Though, he especially liked when Draco broke through that poshness and ended up doing normal things like plopping inot a sitting position. Something he never associated with Draco before—plopping. Honestly, he always imagined Draco floated down onto his seats like a ghost.
I nodded and placed the gift on the table next to the one Ron put down a moment ago. “Work’s been busy. Lots of papers to file.” I added on a sheepish smile so everyone knew it was okay to laugh. My desk duty wasn’t a secret. The reason for it was, but it was common knowledge that I’d been on desk duty for a while.
The sound echoed off the stone walls. He wanted Potter to know the moan was for him, so he locked eyes with Potter again, this time licking his lips and blowing a kiss as he yanked Nikola forward to swallow him to the hilt.
To match Malfoy’s first move, Harry delicately placed his hand, palm down, on Malfoy’s chest just below his collar bone. Without thinking, he started to move his fingers gently back and forth across Malfoy’s chest. At this movement, Harry felt Malfoy’s breathing quicken.
Luna was also out of the question. She wore a tightly fitted velvet dress that barely covered her arse. And that also counted Girl Weasley out because her dress, while loose fitting, was shorter that Luna’s.
We arrived back at Dean and Seamus’s party about an hour later. Robards was right. The Unspeakables tested his wand and were satisfied that our memories were wiped. He told them with my upcoming hearing, he didn’t want me getting anymore ammo about magical surges to clear my name over the beating I gave Riley and decided to wipe it from my memory. Ron was collateral. His mind needed to be wiped since we were so close and he would undoubtedly slip up and tell me.
All sorts of promises were broken and the Ministry operated the same as it had before Voldemort. Nothing was different and people like Daniel J. Riley still worked above the law. I wasn’t going to let that happen anymore.
“I like paperwork,” Luna chimed in thoughtfully. Her hair was almost as white-blonde as Malfoy’s. I’d often wondered if they were related. “It’s nice to get all tidy, don’t you think?”
“Actually, Harry, you know what?” She didn’t turn to face him, instead she poked at the fire a little harder this time, making the other log snap in half. “I will always be your friend, but this is still too hard for me. I didn’t think it would be, but it is.”
Luna was about to say something. Her mouth half open, but Neville called to her from the dance floor, and she whipped her head around to see him. A smile spread across her face. “I’ll leave you boys to it. Draco, Ryder really, really likes Potions. I’m sure you guys will have lots to talk about.” Luna started for Neville, then turned and gave Harry the ‘get lost’ nod before skipping away.
? With all he had done and the terrible choices he made, could he start anew? Even though he had taken the mark, he
The line moved and Draco kept his hand in Harry’s as they shuffled forwards. Draco craned his long neck around the people in front of them to watch as someone bounded over the flames. “Doesn’t look too hard.”
“I suppose you think he should have been interested in you, right? Like all the other people on the planet who are star struck whenever they see ‘
Sir Hilliard gave him a withering stare that would have looked more at home on McGonagall’s face, and then said, “A great many late nights. Something amiss?”
wasn’t in the mood for a lecture. He felt hungover, worse than hungover, he felt like someone literally took a bite out of him. He didn’t know everything about Life Energies, but Hermione once likened it to an invisible field of magic inherent to all humans, only a wizard’s was more solid, more real, more able to be affected by magical forces. So maybe the Succubus actually had taken a bite out of him, spiritually speaking. He could still feel the effect of the Succubus’ magic on him, at any rate. Even four boiling hot showers hadn’t washed away the feeling of her lips on his. He clenched his jaw, ignored the pounding headache and smiled for Ron’s benefit. “So how’s your case going?”
He laughed again, this time he turned to face me. He looked over my shoulder, down the hallway where Dean and Seamus’s rooms were. “There’s a guest room.”
Obligingly, Harry refilled Ron’s glass and then his own, making them both doubles. Then he considered for a moment. How had it happened? Harry was, himself, still working on that one, but he settled on saying, “It happened because of Quidditch.”
I picked it up and that gritty face watched me from his trial photo which we kept in the file because the Ministry is nothing if not paperwork obsessed. He was scowling and his face was covered in bruises in various states of healing likely from the beatings he took from corrupt and pissed Aurors who lost someone to Voldemort and the war. Something in my gut twisted at the memory of him beaten up sitting there awaiting the Wizegnmont’s verdict and I scowled back at the picture for making me feel guilty and placed the file on my desk and worked on cleaning up the rest.
The last thing I wanted to do today was mingle at a garden party and pretend that everything was a-okay, but it was Dean and Seamus. “Do I need to dress up?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and huffed out a breath. His frame slumped a little, but Malfoy quickly caught himself and straightened up to his full height which was at least a few inches more than Harry. “Fine. So where is it?”
Again, he wasn’t really asking Draco, but that was beside the point now. For the sake of all future passers by, Draco opened his top drawer and pulled out the correct file. It was right on top labeled
All of these confessions made Draco feel lightheaded. In the last ten minutes, Draco had been more honest than he had ever endeavored to be—sharing his fears and his hopes, however misguided, with Mr. Potter.
Draco uses this opportunity to see if the sexual tensions he fells about Potter are all in his head.
Slowly, he approached Mr. Potter. His steps made squishing noises as his shoes were filled with water from a stepping through a puddle in his rush to get to Mr. Potter. The noise caught Mr. Potter’s attention. He turned his face up to look at Draco. His eyes were bloodshot and his cheeks still wore the bright red color of embarrassment. Draco felt his breath catch at the sight. His words had done that.
As the ground grew closer, Harry pulled up on his broom and slowed his speed. Draco didn’t. He kept in the dive until the last possible second, but missed the snitch. Harry watched as it flitted off to the left and disappeared under the stands.
I stayed there a moment longer, letting the sun warm me before I headed to the sitting room to answer the call. Part of me wanted to ignore it. Nothing good comes from a fire call at 6:30 in the morning. The face in the fireplace smiled up at me, but it didn’t register who it was at first. “Hello?”
“I do believe it is your turn to say something,” Mr. Potter said. He turned himself so he was looking at Draco now. A smile played at the corner of his lips. “Is it not considered polite to return with another comment on either the beauty of the couples, or at the very least how dreadful the weather is tonight?”
In his forlorn state, Draco did not realize someone had come to stand next to him. It was Luna. She stood perfectly still with her arms crossed in the same manner as Draco’s. Her gaze was directed at Potter. And, as always, she had on this dreamy face that seemed to imply she was always one step ahead of everyone.
“Sorry, don’t know where I went.” Harry tried for a smile, but even he knew it looked more like a grimace. “Is Gin here yet?”
Malfoy sucked in a deep breath. “Sorry, no. Thank you, but I...” He turned his head slightly toward Harry.
Draco lamented his pathetic luck as he headed back to his desk. The conference room emptied before he had the patience to get up and face Potter again. When the memo for this morning’s meeting had arrived on his desk, Draco had just known that Potter messed up. He’d warned the dolt that the Succubus was too powerful to approach alone. Yet, did Potter listen? Of course not, he just put on his hero-hat and damned the consequences.
Once we were through the floo, I locked it until morning. I didn’t want any calls or visitors. Especially since the Ministry had clearance to my home and the people who were behind all of this were the exact government for which I worked. And I thought I was collecting ironies before.
Malfoy quirked his lip up, clearly amused. “Shame. That Potter is exponentially more intriguing. I could tell them all for you. Though they would hardly believe an ex-Death Eater. No matter how well I managed to restore the Malfoy name, they will always see that first. Who I actually am doesn’t matter.”
“That was mine,” the Succubus wailed. Her voice held an aching, a longing, that Harry hadn’t been ready to hear.
that one time, but he couldn’t think of any other...okay, maybe last week he might have wanked off in the loo after seeing Malfoy eating some fresh fruit, but that hadn’t been directly connected to Malfoy. It was just the way he ate the fruit, slow, savouring every bite, and—Merlin fucking fuck, was he attracted to Malfoy?
in his, and the sensation filled up a hole in his chest that he hadn’t been aware of having—one that had been torn open long ago. He didn’t want to let go.
“No,” Harry shouted, in spite of himself. Some of the on-lookers jumped. He heard Ron laugh and then become quickly immersed in shuffling papers. “Will you enlighten me? Or will you make me bloody guess why you’re here harassing me and causing a scene?”
“You have no idea how sexy you are from this angle. Back arched for me,” Draco said as he raked his hands down from Harry’s shoulders to his hips. “Come for me, Harry. Come with me.”
Harry tugged his bag up on his shoulder and responded, “Hey, remember, you need me. Maybe don't be a dick?”
“You were once like us, weren’t you? Magic allowed you to become this in the first place, why couldn’t it also help keep you that way? You were already trying a spell yourself, a spell to bind your soul energy to this nexus, right? I’m positive with some creative casting, I can manage it.”
For some messed up reason, Draco saw all of that. He never explicitly said it, but it was clear in his actions. It was clear because Draco never once treated Harry like he belonged on that pedestal, like it was some privilege to be seen as a hero...like Harry was this thing to be admired and not just a teenage boy who wanted to finish school.
They’d used the Witchcraft Act of 1541 as their guise to hunt down and capture any Succubi they could find, riding on the coat-tails of the very inquisition that hunted their own kind. All in all, it was said the Ministry captured three Succubi in the process. The study, however, was inconclusive as it was shut down and redacted from public record. From what Draco could glean from the old, grumpy archivist down in the stacks, the study was shut down when one of the Succubi broke free and siphoned the Life Energy of thirty Ministry employees.
“Doesn’t matter?” Draco asked, a hint of annoyance in his tone. He was obviously awake now and pulling the blanket off. He stood up, walked around the couch to stand face to face with Harry. “What do you mean it doesn’t matter. Of course, it matters. I’ve left you notes. I‘ve run after you in between classes. Hell, I even stayed up playing chess with Ron until eleven last night hoping to catch a glimpse of you before bed.”
Harry blinked up at him, all too aware of how, this close, he could smell Draco’s soap — lavender and early spring. He inhaled, letting the scent wash over him. Now, that was a little disconcerting, almost as much as the fact that Harry
Out front, Draco spotted Mr. Potter standing under the lamp post that was the designated apparation point but it did not look as if he were making any attempt to apparate. His frame was hunched over. His robes were soaked through and his dark hair was matted to his head. Droplets of rain raced down his still-flushed cheeks.
“He cares,” Luna said confidently, though Harry wasn’t sure why she was so confident and it didn’t look like she was going to elaborate. Instead, she scrawled something on the parchment in front of her and then swatted the air like she was shooing away a fly, though Harry hadn’t seen anything there.
yet, but there’s still time for them to see the real Harry Potter, the one who does bad things like beat a man so badly he’s in a coma.”
“Care to tell me why your partner popped out of the Floo and verbally requested a partner change before heading home without being debriefed?”
Every part of Harry wanted to ignore his brain, which was moving a mile a minute, trying to understand why Draco hadn’t said anything. Obviously, he wasn’t completely disturbed by what Harry said, or he wouldn’t be kissing him...like
I nodded. Coming back for eighth year had seemed like a good idea at the time, but the reality was that Hogwarts wasn’t home anymore. Not after the battle.
“Di—did you just compliment me?” Draco was sure he wore an equally shocked expression, though all he could focus on was how Potter’s eyes raked up and down Draco’s body like they were seeing him for the first time.
“I would heartily agree, Mrs. Granger,” Pansy said with a little too much excitement for Draco’s taste. He could almost feel her body pulsing eagerly for Mrs. Granger’s attentions.
“So if Hermione just went, that means it’s…” Longbottom started, ignoring the quiet that settled in the group after Granger acknowledge Draco.
With a deep breath, Harry licked his lip once more, this time on purpose knowing it would elicit a response from the stupid git. Gathering his thoughts on what to try next, Harry watched as Malfoy’s adam’s apple bobbed under the pale skin of his neck. And much to his dismay, Harry was hit with the desire to kiss Malfoy’s perfectly pale and soft neck.
Harry wanted to say something back, but before he could, their boss, Head Auror Robards, walked in and he looked about as happy as someone who had just gotten a root canal and came out to find a parking ticket on their car. He marched up to the large map of London hanging on the board at the front of the conference room and settled his gaze on the group. The map of London had red dots to indicate the locations of the recent murders in Harry’s case.
After that night, their midnight seeker’s games seemed to hold renewed meaning. The acknowledgment that both Harry and Draco felt the same way about their meetings, that they held the same meaning for both of them, made their bond stronger.
Draco started. Potter was talking to him. Potter was talking to him and he seemed perfectly in control of himself, very much leading Draco to believe he really must have imagined the scene in the privy because
I had to bite my tongue before I said something that would end in me being punched or detained. If the Unspeakables got their hands on this crime scene, they would make sure it disappeared. They already tried wiping the caretakers memory. There’s no reason to believe they wouldn't do the same thing to all of us if they thought it necessary.
Robards held up a hand to silence the soft murmurs in the room. “The most recent death was last night at a popular wizarding nightclub, Pandemonium. Auror Potter was on the scene, a happy accident as it were, and attempted to apprehend the Succubus, but was unsuccessful.”
Harry smiled at Hermione. She was intense, always had been, but he loved her for it. You never had to guess with Hermione where you stood. She’d tell you. “Work was fine. Hard case today. Involved a kid.”
It was a chaste peck. Soft. Quick. And then Draco pulled back to look at him. Harry was sure he was blushing, but didn’t care. He yearned for another kiss, so he moved in slowly and closed his eyes.
“You Gryffindor’s need to work on your repertoire of insults. Yes, yes. I am a coward, I am a tosser, blah, blah, blah. My feelings are so hurt.”
“I’ll… send it up to him now.” Pansy eyed Potter for a moment and then smirked at Draco before going over to a filing cabinet. She flicked through until she found the form she was looking for, pulled it out and placed it on her desk. With her quill in hand, she began filling it out. After a moment, she sighed and said, “Hold on, I need to go get my boss's signature, too. I’ll just be a minute.” And then she was out the door.
“So, Draco, darling, dearest,” Luna started, “I have someone I’d like you to meet. A friend I made the other day.”
It was all Malfoy’s fault. Harry had never had any issues sharing the cloak with Ron and Hermione and Ron was more lanky than anyone Harry had ever met. He never considered there would be a problem sharing the cloak with one person when he so often had done so with two. Yet, Harry should have known Malfoy was not just any person and that the mixture of their personalities would result in trouble.
No letter of acceptance arrived. Draco waited many a fortnight. He would spend hours making excuses for Mr. Potter’s absence in reply. Possibly the man was caught up on business. Or possibly, he was engaged in hunting as it was mid-season and men like Mr. Potter enjoyed the hunt quite thoroughly. Maybe the letter had not reached Mr. Potter. Maybe it was lost and the lack of acceptance was not a slight, but a misunderstanding.
I felt my heart jump into my throat. I didn’t normally scare so easy, but between the sobriety, which was still a struggle, and the visions, I was on edge. If it weren’t for the pepper-up potions, I’d be even worse off.
“Mm, ‘fraid so,” Draco answered. Keep it to as little words as possible. They can’t get mad at what is said, if you don't say anything, Draco told himself.
Stupidly, the only spell that came to mind was Rictusempra, so he shot it off in the direction of the gray blob. It missed her and hit the victim still unconscious on the slab. His body jerked and then the man shot up as if awoken from a nightmare.
Draco nodded, his smoke-gray eyes sparkling with humor. “I am going to regret this study technique when I catch a cold.”
Ron considered me slowly. “Are you trying to get fired, Harry? Because you’ve always been a bit, you know, rash, but lately it seems like you’re more, I don’t know, more something. More careless. Like you’re on a mission to cause trouble for yourself. All these articles read like a man on a mission to ruin his own reputation.”
Potter choked on his drink. “Funny,” he said. He looked concerned for a minute and opened his mouth to say something, but then, instead, slapped Draco on the back playfully.
There was a moment where Draco thought he misunderstood Potter’s implied question, but then he felt the pressure of Potter’s mouth against his. He closed his eyes and let himself be kissed.
Hand lightly gripping Harry’s cock, Draco captured him in a eager kiss. Then he slid his lips lightly down his neck, to the dip of his collarbone where he nibbled at the top button on Harry’s dress shirt to unbutton it. Then continued until all the buttons were undone.
It was so jarring because up until that point Harry would have described Draco’s face as being set in a sort of curious scowl, which is already a semi-frowny look. But at Harry’s words, Draco’s face settled into even more of a frown.
“Merlin, just kiss me already.” Harry was feeling more than a little bit nervous, confident attitude aside. “Do it, Malfoy.”
?” Lucius asked, attempting concern but skipping past it into pure annoyance at having to deal with someone he so clearly saw as a nuisance. Just what he needed, for his son to fall ill in the middle of a government coup.
my job. You’d know that if you’d let me do more than file your paperwork and chase after you like a lost crup. You’re not the only one who cares about solving this case. Or any case, for that matter.”
. He means we,” Draco added. He eyed Pansy and she gave him the merest raise of a brow to indicate that she wanted to know why Draco had let himself get roped into running all the way down to the lab for a potion that was not yet ready.
Another knowing look crossed Pansy’s face. Only she knew about Draco’s asinine feelings for Potter, and only because she stole his diary in fourth year and read a rather embarrassing section where Draco gushed about Potter’s eyes ad nauseam. Eventually she said, “Succubus magic is Life Magic, it’s Death Magic, but it’s also Sex Magic. If they can’t trap you in their seduction, then they are weaker and less able to siphon your Life Energy, so we calculated the best way to keep from melting into a pile of lust at their feet was to use an already existing attraction as a shield.”
Most of the dinner conversation was boring. Draco only spoke once the entire meal and that was to ask Daisy to bring him more wine, which he had been drinking in abundance. Normally, he liked to keep a clear head for these sort of meetings, but between his meeting with Potter earlier and his fathers treatment of him, Draco was feeling less than cooperative. Plus, the business talk bored him half to death.
Ron looked at Hermione gathering a plate full of food for him. “Tonight. We need to behave normally for now. The Unspeakables think we were mind wiped so we need to stay at this party. It’s what they will expect.” He walked over to Hermione and I watched his face shift from a quiet rage to something softer. They began talking animatedly with Seamus and Dean.
Harry blinked a few times, confused, before taking the seat next to Draco. He sat closer than necessary—so close that their knees touched.
He kept his eyes forward on the stone structures at the back of the cemetery and decided to try and place the architecture to keep his mind off of Potter and the way this blasted potion was making up all of his carefully curated control. There were some that looked like Egyptian revival tombs, and others that called back to Rome and the columns of their great structures. Others were properly gothic and looked like they would have inspired the likes of Mary Shelly and Edgar Allen Poe. The grounds were meticulously cared for—verdant green grass spread out around him, and large trunked trees gave shade to the perimeter of the grounds. The ivy and moss growing on older stones all seemed intentional as opposed to overgrown.
“You two are the biggest arseholes on the planet. Why cant you just ask each other out like normal people? All this headache.”
Auror Read’s hand shot up again, but this time he waited for Robards to acknowledge him before he spoke. “Are we sure it’s a Succubus and not a Vampire, sir. Some of the intel could easily point to Vampires, namely the ‘only comes out after dark’ part.”
“Already have someone,” Ned finished for him, eyeing Harry from over Malfoy’s shoulder. “I should have figured as much. Someone as gorgeous as you couldn’t be single.”
When that thought occurred to him, when he realized Draco was going to say no, Harry avoided Draco whenever possible and tried to think of a way to fix it, to solve it. He stayed out late practicing on the Quidditch pitch, he skipped meals, and ran off after class, all to delay the inevitable conversation. Draco was going to end things, he was going to leave Harry. And Harry couldn’t...wouldn’t let that happen. So he needed a plan first.
But Harry still couldn’t look at him. He kept his eyes on the moon. “You knew I had feelings for you then, but you never—and now, now you want to say something? On the night I asked you to help me make another man jealous?” Harry’s voice was sharp and he could feel anger rising in him.
.” Malfoy shook his head and with a flick of his wrist, he cast a Disillusionment Charm, and Harry felt the magic settle over them. Even that felt like a caress along his spine, and he shivered under the warmth of Malfoy’s magic.
“Stay away from her, I mean it,” Harry said, trying to sound confident, though if she pushed the matter he wasn’t sure he could gather enough strength to hit her with another spell. But she didn’t need to know that.
Draco smirked when he saw Potter gulp and slide on of his hands down into his lap. Potter was trying to hide his erection, but Draco saw it before he could. And knowing that Potter was aroused, Draco came.
Harry’s mouth went dry when he realized that feeling he was feeling wasn’t just lust, or even friendship. He’d felt those before, and this, what he felt, was more immense, more encompassing, and more wonderful. Draco dizzied him, made him feel foolish, free, and understood all at once. He was sexy, intelligent, challenging, frustrating, and the most interesting person Harry had ever met. That all added up to one thing. Didn’t it?
There was no good way to barge in on a Succubus as it siphoned the Life Energy out of a human victim. There was, as far as Harry could tell, only one way in and one way out. There were no windows to see inside, so all that was left was to open the door and walk inside. Easy as pie.
Draco didn’t answer. Instead he shook his head and smiled. Potter was definitely going to succeed at wooing him, but Draco didn’t have to tell him that right now.
and he was inside. There were a few vials labeled Dreamless Sleep and another labeled Calming Draught. Draco considered taking that one, but really it was more for dealing with trauma and not for a panic attack.
Harry closed his eyes. The people settling into their chairs around him put him on edge. He clenched his jaw shut. Their hushed chatter was like the chirping of crickets in summer; quiet, yet annoying. He snapped his eyes open just as his Auror partner, Draco Malfoy, settled into one of the red velvet conference chairs at the other end of the semi-circle conference table. His white-blonde hair was slicked back similar to the way he wore it in school. And though he wore the same standard black robes as the other Aurors gathered in the conference room, Malfoy stood out, and that only served to make the throbbing headache working its way behind Harry’s eyes all the worse.
“It never gets easier,” he said. “Seeing a dead body. It never gets easier.” He took one more look at his hands and then brushed them off on the front of his trousers.
Draco sneered at him, narrowing his eyes. “Maybe a week. Maybe longer. Who knows? It’s not like I was counting the days,
. Maybe he was a coward, after all. Surely, only cowards let their father’s sell their bodies to the highest bidder. Surely, only cowards let their mother die defending them.
“Nothing,” Draco stuttered, raising a hand to his top button trying to swallow the lump in his throat. “I mean, undergarments, of course, but traditionally you don’t wear clothes under a dress robe.”
Taking her hand, Harry let Ginny pull him off the bench, but only after pretending to be stuck to the spot and making her struggle to get him off the seat. Afterwards, they both laughed heartily and walked arm in arm back towards the warmth of The Three Broomsticks where their friends awaited them.
Draco nodded shakily and they walked off toward the privy in the captain's quarters where this whole mess had begun. They didn't speak until they reached the bathroom. Draco had to keep his mind off the fact that if he had picked anyone else this wouldn’t be so bad. At this rate, he was no only going to be in the same room as Potter and undress, he was going to be wearing that stupid muggle outfit all night smelling like Potter. He hated himself for not choosing Granger.
Draco turned to meet Luna’s gaze, but it was with great effort because he did not want to stop watching the man who had only moments ago said he wanted to kiss Draco in the bathroom. “Yes, erm, I mean—no, no, that’s not...”
Robards stared down at me, not even attempting to hide his disdain. “Potter, if I find out you cast anything at this crime scene, I will report it to the hearing committee.”
Harry sat down next to Ron on the couch. The common room was packed full of students, all laughing and dancing and drinking. It felt uncanny to hear so much joy around him so soon after the war. Harry wondered if he was the only one still unsteady, or if there was something wrong with him like he always feared. He thought about it whenever he had a moment to himself. It had always been something he expected to go away once he beat Voldemort for once and for all, but it was still there, like a rock in his shoe. This feeling like something was off, missing, out of place.
Harry dropped to his knees, letting his broom go, and then fell forward on his stomach, panting into the damp grass, taking in the smell of earth. Laying there, he felt more like a person than he had in months, maybe longer.
“Lucius, my drink is empty,” the Dark Lord said, wagging the empty glass in front of himself until Lucius, without speaking, took it and refilled it.
“That’s something we need to figure out before it kills again. If it holds to its pattern, we can expect it to find a new victim tonight. Every previous victim was estimated to have died at or very near 3 a.m., so we’re on a clock, people. We can’t afford to mess this up.”
“Ye—yes,” Draco stammered. Merlin, this man would be the death of him one way or the other. He was throwing Draco’s own words back at him.
The line moved up slowly. I switched the present to my other arm and hoisted it back into place. “Did they say how many people were coming?”
“If only that weren’t the case,” Harry muttered and then adjusted himself in the chair. It was wooden like the table and had a floral pillow tied to the seat. As far a chairs went, this one, Harry decided, was not very comfortable. “Anyway, like I was saying; Ginny and I officially ended things right after the war ended. I think we both realized we were holding onto something that wasn’t there anymore. It wasn’t like we didn’t care for each other, but we also didn’t see a future together.”
,” Malfoy whispered and bit down hard on his bottom lip. Harry watched as the man’s eyes darted from Harry’s lips back up to meet his gaze.
“Look, Malfoy, really, that’s not even close to what I meant. I only meant he was an odd bloke. The way he was talking to you like he knew you just because he reads the articles. Those people freak me out.” Potter sounded calmer suddenly, all the anger gone from his voice. “I never said that it was odd that he found you attractive, or that you aren’t worthy. Honestly, it would have been odd if he didn’t find you attractive. I mean, shite, just look at you. You should hear what everyone at the DMLE says about you. Half the secretaries swoon whenever you pass them. Everyone thinks you’re good-looking.”
“You do know,” Harry started, then lowered his voice, “the whole school is going to think we are dating now?”
I didn’t have time to answer him. The door opened slowly and a professor I didn’t recognize came in and quietly started making tea. She ignored us, not even turning to nod at Neville and sat at the table furthest from ours.
“Even so, the effects can be rather distracting, Potter.” Pansy put her hands on her hips. She was ready to snap at him, Draco could see it in her eyes. “Like I said, it takes that existing attraction and brings it to the forefront. If you have accepted that attraction, you will be in better control of the effects, but if not...”
“Unfortunately, there isn’t anything here that can give us answers.” Hermione walked over to Ron and placed a hand on his back. “We need to trace the magic, or at least identify what magic was used. That will narrow things down.”
“I sent two letters after the trial inviting you to dine with me as a thank you for intervening and saving me from a most unfavorable situation. Both letters were met with no response and so I took it to mean you did not care to have an acquaintance with me.”
His voice when it came now was low and touchably sensual. “Potter, this is becoming a daily annoyance, I mean, occurrence. What busines brings you here today?”
Their last encounter was likely why Potter fought against his binds with extra barbarity today. Potter tried to stand, and because there was not much slack, came crashing down to his knees directly in front of Draco. He breathed heavily like a dragon just before it spits fire.
“Hermione can handle it.” I slowly dragged my hand off his chest and my body felt like it was one fire. I swallowed, hard. “She said you guys worked together on it.”
Potter, stood, walked to stand next to Draco’s seat and slammed the file open onto his desk. He gave Draco a smug look that screamed ‘see...I can be clever, too.’ Their proximity was dizzying, but Draco managed to swallow the rising tide of lust, and focus on the map.
“Fair enough,” I said because it was true and if I let on how much I didn’t want it in the papers then maybe she would try and use it against me. I wouldn’t give her any ammo to use against me.
Malfoy brought a hand up to his throat where the most delicious looking blush was starting to bloom. I could see the pulse in his neck throbbing. He let out a nervous laugh. “You are truly as reckless as everyone says.”
Malfoy raised his wand, clearly ready to cast another spell, but Harry nudged him with his elbow. The only spell that worked on her was fire and with the victim unconscious under her, it was too dangerous. She could use him as a shield, or Malfoy could miss and hit the victim all together. There was no good way to communicate to Malfoy to cast a
Without looking away from Seamus, Dean added, “He’s a perfectionist. He checks on those plants nearly every day.”
I gritted my teeth. “I knew it. They are covering cases up and it has to do with the magical surges.”
“Right, of course not. Perfect Potter never meant to imply that I was inferior to him in any way. That’s why you constantly ask for my opinions on cases, respect my decisions, and inform me when you’re chasing down leads, right? That’s why you called me last night for backup when you went after that thing. Because you think I am so capable.”
“People are in danger. I need it to help them. I can’t tell you more than that without putting you in danger, too.”
“Whatever do you mean?” Draco said in his best innocent voice, trying to mask his repulsion with himself, as he scrubbed the last bit of blood from his knuckle. He watched as it was soaked up, dying what was left of the ivory color a bright red. Briefly, Granger’s bloody face flashed through his mind. Her eyes shut. Her cheek busted open.
“What do you…” I trailed off as understanding hit me. He wanted to come along and I couldn’t let him. He was too much of a distraction.
“Hmm, yeah,” Harry agreed. He chanced a look at Draco out of the corner of his eye and saw Draco staring into the fire. The light played along his angular jawline, setting some of his pale skin in shadow and highlighted the rest in the orange glow. Harry swallowed hard and tore his eyes away from Draco’s smooth, pale skin. Looking at the sky was much safer.
He didn’t get a chance to respond before Draco was shaking his head and saying, “It’s totally fine, no need to say anything. It was a long shot. Thank you for hearing me out,  Harry. It was great seeing you.”
“Sorry, just Hermione kept me up into the wee hours of the night,” Ron said with an apologetic sort of look on his face, “She’s insatiable, she is.”
Once under the cloak, Harry had found himself regretting, again, the bad luck of getting roped into this, for he found himself in closer quarters with Malfoy than he ever intended. Every bit of Harry that touched Malfoy felt like fire. His thigh on Malfoy’s. His elbow knocking into Malfoy’s. Even their shoulders touching in an uncomfortably intimate way. He was breathing in Malfoy’s breath and smelling the lingering soapy smell of someone who was freshly showered. It had been overwhelming and when Malfoy, in an attempt to communicate without words, turned to Harry and raised his brow to ask
Of course, now she only printed fluff pieces about us. I even heard tale of her trying to squash some of the more gossipy articles about me. Not that it changed how I felt about her. She was still a bastard.
“I have heard stories about your mouth, you know? How it performs magic. How it tastes like the most decadent treats.” Nikola moved a hand from his waist and trailed his index finger across Draco’s mouth slowly as he continued, “Yet in all those stories, not one man spoke of the taste of your cock and I find myself aching to taste you.”
? Your the one with the oafish feet,” Malfoy snapped. As if for good measure, he kicked Harry’s foot. “Every time you stepped, I nearly lost my balance.”
“Then why don’t you fuck me,” Harry said in a low moan. He started to unzip his pants, but Draco grabbed his hand to stop him. Gave him a slight shake of the head as if to say ‘not so fast’ and dragged his hand lightly over the bulge in Harry’s pants.
“I can’t believe that you actually came to the party.” Potter sloshed the bottle upward and took a long, lingering swig of the mystery alcohol, then made a scrunched-up face before turning his attention back to Draco.
His wand in hand, Harry slowly walked further into the alley where large dumpsters lined the wall of the club. The back of the alley ended in a brick wall, so unless the thing could Apparate or fly, he had it cornered.
“You have to drink it all,” Malfoy said. He had one hand fanned out across his chest. The other held tight to his wand just in case. “Now, it should work by giving you the ability to see magical traces. You’ll have to differentiate between ambient magic and intentional magic, of course. Ambient magic will look neutral like a grayish white. The other spells will present as different colors just like with the traditional trace spell.”
“This is bigger than possible third ears, Parkinson. A woman died last night. I was there, I couldn’t stop it because of that thing's stupid powers. I won’t sit around while it takes another life.”
I coughed, loud enough to let them know they weren’t alone, and then I stood up, stacking the loose files on my desk. I was tired of hearing what they had to say anyway.
“I didn’t expect you to answer. I thought I’d call and leave a message with Kreacher.” She said it like I should be thankful that she hadn’t intended to wake me up. She had a contingency plan that rested on the shoulders of my impossibly grumpy house elf who almost never gave me my messages.
There was a pregnant silence and then a dark cloud moved in front of the sun, blanketing the party in darkness. I sensed Malfoy standing to my left, but he wasn’t saying anything. He wasn’t moving. I heard a sharp intake of breath that let me know he was okay. Then another scream ripped through the air; this time so loud it reverberated in my ears, and I looked toward the back of the yard. It was coming from the forest, or at least near the forest.
Harry, headache in full swing, nodded goodbye to Ron who was still skimming the file, and made a bee-line for the exit. He needed to look at his map and figure out just what this thing was up to before it killed anyone else.
“And you don’t have to stay that long, especially if you’re tired, Harry. You should really try to sleep.”
Draco finally blinked, moved the book and parchment off his lap, leaned in close to Harry’s face, then kissed him greedily. Their mouths closed around one another, and they kissed until both of them were shaking.
Ron sighed. “No, not okay. We’ve been arguing about this for months. How many more partners do you think they will let you go through before Robards fires you?”
, one life is enough to sustain them for over a year. They have no need to kill so frequently. The bargain they make with their Demon is for immortality through the sacrifice of one life a year. They give up everything for this, their magic, their morality, their ability to pass on to anywhere other than Hell. Most live a few centuries before the Demon will collect their soul. It makes no logical sense that one would kill so many like this, calling attention to itself when it’s been getting by under the radar.
“Malfoy, honestly. It’s been a month. All you’ve done is cast a few stupid wandless spells and annoy me into oblivion. This whole act is getting a bit tired.”
Someone shouted, “Here, here.” And then the rest of the group joined in. There were sounds of clinking glasses, followed by a murmured chorus of cheers.
Ron came up behind her and took her heels and transfigured them for her using her wand. He managed to turn them into proper sneakers after two tries and helped her into them. They laughed the whole time.
“They already covered up one incident involving this man. And that’s just what I know about. If they did it once, they will do it again.” Ron gave me a look that begged me to shut up. I ignored it. “I know how it sounds, but an informant told me this man experienced a magical surge so large it produced something resembling an Obscurial. The Unspeakables wiped his memory of the event.”
“You got lucky,” Harry snapped back, even though he knew it was a lie. Harry had not counted on Draco’s flying skills, nor his speed.
There was a pause in which Harry was sure he had just ruined weeks of building up whatever it was between them. It had been difficult enough to get Draco to believe he didn’t have some hidden agenda, that he was just trying to get to know him. Harry couldn’t imagine how hard it would be to build trust all over again.
“Also, this Prophet article is not going to help. He’s always been sort of skittish and this will probably make him even more so.”
Her tone was gracious and she did not seem put out to be speaking to Pansy and Draco. In fact, she seemed quite eager to speak again. Her mouth was already forming the words. It was only the rules of polite conversation that seemed to keep her at bay long enough to let someone else speak.
Ginny sighed. “I already forgave you, Harry, last Christmas when you were a drunk mess and apologized to me for almost an hour.”
“So, we are agreed then? You and I will share what we gather. I, to help you solve the case and regain some of your tattered reputation and you, to help me get yet another best-selling book.”
“Malfoy…” I reached out and put a hand on his back. I rubbed in circles trying to sooth him. His body was shaking. I felt it tremble under my hand. “Are you okay?”
“You tell me,” Potter said and dragged Draco’s hand down his chest. Draco felt the slight curve of his pec and the subtle bump of his abdomen as Potter pulled it down further. He watched, frozen as Potter guided his hand down past his belt to the now evident bulge in his trousers. “Does this feel serious to you?”
Hopefully, it quelled whatever doubt Draco had about him. Hopefully, Draco realized all these months, he had been flirting with him. Harry remembered one night in particular: it was a few weeks ago, before Draco started dating that bloke. The quidditch match got canceled due to a snow storm. Harry had been pissed because he really needed the release that playing afforded him. He had a particularly bad day at work and wanted to let off steam.
“I mean, you were clever enough to escape capture when the Ministry was rounding up your kind for experiments, so of course you’d think yourself clever enough to outwit a literal Demon. You are the one who got loose and siphoned all those Ministry workers, aren’t you? You’re the reason they shut the project down.”
“So you want this article to be about you liking men and not being with Ginny, all so Dra--” Luna started to say, but Harry cut her off.
. It was his duty to perform, to make those men happy so they would be putty in the Dark Lord’s hands. So when Nikola dropped to his knees and pulled Draco’s dress robes apart, Draco felt his breath hitch.
“Really? Was it after the pick-up Quidditch game? The one where it rained and Charlie and I said we would put away everyone’s brooms?”
As soon as he had taken the potion, Draco knew he was in trouble. On a good day, he had no trouble pushing away his attraction to Potter, ignoring it until he could go home and indulge the fantasy. But today wasn’t a good day. He could hardly focus around Potter as it was, and if Potter kept touching him, Draco knew he would lose it. The second Potter’s hand made contact with his shoulder, the warmth in Draco’s gut surged and he grew erect. He hadn’t gotten hard that fast since third year.
Ryder nodded a hello at Harry, then extended a hand for Draco to shake, which he did, maybe for a beat longer than was usual. “Nice to finally meet you, Draco.”
“So what is my Dare then?” Draco asked, trying to sound unafraid. It was best to never show your enemy fear. Or at least that’s what his father taught him—for whatever good it did him.
“So, what brings you all the way out here?” Neville asked as he rounded the room and picked up a watering can and preceded to water the plants in quick succession.
Again a wicked smile spread across her face. “I will get the story one way or the other. At least this way, you also get to save lives. Isn’t that sort of your thing, Mr. Potter?”
The only downside was one of Luna’s dearest friends happened to be Harry’s ex, Draco Malfoy, whom he hadn’t properly talked to since the end of eighth year. They were amicable enough when they passed one another at the Ministry, but outside of pleasantries, they’d hardly spoken over the last year, and certainly they’d avoided being at the same functions as often as possible. Neville and Luna’s party, however, wasn’t a charity function that he could donate a large amount of money to in lieu of attending.
I shook my head. “No like a specific person. The man sobbing in front of the rock. I almost reached him this time. I just knew I was supposed to get to him, but he is always just out of reach.”
Harry watched Draco for a moment, his posture rigidly straight as always, reminded Harry of a ballerina. Then he swallowed hard because
“You are too good for me. You and I, together, we do not make any rational sense to the world. You are well regarded and wealthy, while I am a disgrace with a family name that only carries scandal. That is what I was saying to Pansy. I will not allow myself to indulge in my feelings for you because I am not worthy of receiving any sort of reciprocation.”
I had about two minutes to collect myself before Hermione was shoving me on a small stage in front of a sea of Hogwarts students, their families, people from Hogsmeade, and who knows how many other people came in from London.
“I’m happy for you,” Ron said between gulps. Then with a small huff, he leaned back, settling his head on the back of the couch. Harry watched as his best mate almost dozed off to sleep right in the middle of their conversation.
“I promise.” Draco smiled at his friend and patted her hand on his arm. “Safety is my middle name, after all.” That made her laugh and she released him. With one last smile, he was bounding down the hall to catch the elevator wondering how in Tartarus he was going to keep his cool around Potter.
The crowd collectively snapped their heads around to look at Harry, who felt suddenly like he had shown up to Potions naked. He gulped down his nerves and said, “Course, mate!” Then titled his glass toward Neville.
Longbottom was out of the question completely because as Draco was scanning the group, he watched Longbottom spill some of his drink down the front of his shirt. Draco was not about to wear a shirt that smelled like alcohol all night—no spell could really take that smell out of clothes.
“I know,” Harry responded and gulped back his glass of firewhiskey. At Ginny’s behest, Harry had arranged to tell Ron the same news he had shared with her only yesterday. According to Ginny, maybe the reason Harry felt so terrible about being in love is because he was treating it like a terrible secret and not something that could be wonderful.
Harry didn’t see it happen, but suddenly the Succubus gripped his throat. It was like time skipped. One moment, she was smiling at him from a foot away, the next, her hand was tight around his throat, and she was pulling his Life Energy from him. He could feel it as she drained him, only this time there was no bliss, no pleasure—all he felt was pain, searing and tearing at his insides. His grip on his wand weakened and he felt it slip out of his hand and hit the ground.
, or so he’d been told on countless occasions by countless powerful wizards—all of which he had charmed into bed in service of the Dark Lord’s agenda.
“I’ll explain later. I’m not wasting this potion.” I smiled and then began running after the black trial of magic as it began to fade away.
“I don’t,” Draco answered with a flick of the wrist. After a moment, he stood up so they were toe to toe and now, eye to eye.
“As much fun as it’s been, I don’t know if I’m not as okay with being one of many as I thought I would be,” he said. It looked like it too effort, too. He barely made eye contact with me as he spoke. His eyes darted everywhere but my face.
“For what?” Potter asked. His voice was ernest which almost made it worse that he was asking. He had his hand on his belt, beginning to unfasten it.
need the potion.” Potter glanced at Draco and rolled his eyes, then turned his attention back on Pansy. “Robards said you were nearly done with it. I was hoping it was ready now.”
Violently, Draco leaned down, gripped Potter’s chin, and turned his face up so he could look him in the eyes. They were greener than anything Draco could remember seeing, even in his mother’s garden which was in bloom year round. They shone with his disobedience. It was those eyes, Draco mused, that the Dark Lord must fear. In them, Draco could see all of Potter’s raw power. He was a beast, that much was obvious. But, Potter always seemed to be holding something back from their encounters and Draco had made it his personal mission to draw it from him like poison from a wound.
Ginny’s lips pursed, and her eyes narrowed. “I don’t like him. I don’t like you being near him, not after that night when I found you guys on the couch. I don’t trust him.”
“I thought so. I watch you in Potions, you know? It’s mesmerizing to watch your hands work so deftly, so steady.” Potter started to stroke Draco’s palm with this thumb as he spoke. He moved it in small circles. The motion made Draco whimper.
Since then, Draco did not find much pleasure in sex. It became too heavy with responsibility, especially when he had been hand picked to seduce certain powerful men for the Dark Lord. He found that he was too afraid to engage in any relations outside of obligation once it was made clear that he would be beaten into submission should he get caught. It was this that also made his arousal with Potter catch him completely off guard.
Malfoy bit his lower lip to keep from laughing. “Right and I was well loved in school.” He walked closer to me. His eyes catching my gaze. He was close enough to whisper in my ear. “What are you up to, Potter? Something bad?”
Luna laughed lightly, tilting her head down to rest in the crook of Neville’s neck. “I would have asked you out before that could have happened.”
“Thank you...I think. Anyway, as I said, we could use your help. Have you noticed anything odd around the last month or so?”
“I am a proper wizard, Potter. I require wooing,” Draco said, hoping to sound in control of his breathing. It was difficult to think straight while Potter continued to kiss his neck. Each one, burning through him like a shooting star.
,” Potter growled, pointing the hand that held the bottle in Draco’s general direction. All the panic Draco had coursing through his body seemed to bubble at the surface when Potter spoke. If he could just scoot by Potter, then he could get off this damned ship without anyone taking notice. After all, Luna had only invited him to the party out of pity.
“I didn’t think to do that,” Draco answered honestly, but he did not add that the reason he had not considered more casual clothes for the party was because he had not intended to come to it. Stepping forward, Potter ran his hand over the front of Draco’s robes, fingering one of the buttons. “So what do you have on under there?”
“And who says that’s what I’m doing?” Potter asked, some of his earlier anger replaced with something else, something sadder. “Maybe they were all just incompetent, or maybe I just work better alone.”
“Merlin, the ego on this one,” Weasley commented. “She meant Lockhart, of course. It was her turn for Truth. Neville asked her who her first crush was and it was apparently Lockhart.”
“This place is going to hell,” Lamont said. “The edicts going through about the Secrecy Statue are one thing, but I can’t believe he’s just getting a hearing. A hearing, Angie? Anyone else would have been sent to Azkaban if they did what he did.”
Ever since their capture, Potter and his friends had been impossible, but Potter especially so. He constantly refused to eat. Leaving food on his trays to rot. Often, he would refuse to let Draco cast a cleaning spell on him to freshen up his clothes. And even more often, Draco would be welcomed by Potter spitting in his face.
“He is pretty good with defensive spells though. Doesn’t even need his wand for most of them anymore,” Reed said sounding half-impressed.
Another long pause. “No, Harry. I just worry about you. I worry you never properly dealt with things and when you get upset, you drink.”
He fell forward and felt Draco’s release following his own. Then he felt the weight of Draco’s warm, sweat-slicked body. “Merlin’s ghost, Potter. I fucking love you.”
There was something about his voice that gave Harry pause. In all their years of fighting and whatever this was now, he wasn’t quite sure he had ever heard Draco sound so hopeful but Harry couldn’t let himself linger on exactly what Draco had hoped. If he did, he might screw it up.
All Draco cared about in that moment was the calm that washed over him after leaving Potter in his cell, panting from both anger and arousal.
“Mmm, the very same. I came back outside to help, but when I saw the way you looked at him, I thought I’d better go back inside.”
“Harry, that’s not how it works and you know it.” Draco pulled one of his hands free and cupped Harry’s face. He stroked his thumb alone Harry’s cheekbone, wiping away the tears that had fallen. “There’s no rush. We can wait until I make things right, until it's settled.”
Harry mused, the time seemed fitting as it was midnight all those years ago when Draco challenged him to a duel, only to never show up. He had to admit, he considered standing Draco up just to be petty, but then he realized that he had been looking forward to their match all day, so pride be damned.
and all things fluffy and good. If you’re hitting rock bottom, I don’t know what that means for all us other mere mortals. You need to have hope, or else my whole world is turned upside down...And we both know I don’t do well with change.”
Hate didn’t even being to cover it, but it was a start. Crowds made me feel on edge, sure. The claustrophobia, the pressure to be something. Normally I can push it away, usually with the help of alcohol. But more than that, it was all the staring that came with crowds. The watching.
Quietly, Harry responded. “I—I mean...I wanted to stroke your cheek like you did the petal. It was stupid. I’m stupid. Sorry.” Then he looked around to see how far off Hagrid was—luckily, he was a good distance off fiddling with the branches of a tree making himself look busy.
The man tilted his head back to rest on the stone wall, giving her better access to his neck. “God, you’re so hot.” He took one hand away from her arse and slid it up her hip, slowly dragging his fingers along the hem of her dress.
A primal need burned through Harry when Draco opened his mouth, flicking his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip. Draco wasn’t a patient man, not so far as Harry knew, but the kiss was patient. He never pushed, but instead, opened himself to Harry, letting him set the pace. And when their passion began to grow fevered, hungry, Draco started to slow the kiss until they were as they started, lip to lip. When they finally parted, neither of them was breathing properly.
It was Draco’s turn to look confused. His eyes went wide as saucers, obviously trying to decide if Harry was the one joking or not. “Uh, yeah, she will. It might make the fact that you’re a
Harry sighed, pulling back from Ginny enough that he could look her in the eye. “Nothing, just catching up.” The lie came out before he could even think about why he was lying. It was just a character letter, so why lie?
In his hands, Draco held the blood stained handkerchief. It was the monogrammed one his mother got him for his thirteenth birthday. Once it was his favorite to carry with him. Now it was simply useless, as it was stained with blood. Even a scourgify couldn’t eliminate the foul stain of what he had just done.
Lamont balled his fists, but ignored my comment. His eyes fell on the disarray at my desk and said, “New filing system there, Auror Potter?” Then he grabbed a folder off of his desk, walked it over to mine and tossed it down on the floor and kicked the papers around for good measure. “What a fun new system you’ve got worked out here.”
She released him, but only after biting his bottom lip and slowly dragging her teeth off. “Stop? Are you sure? I can taste your arousal, and it’s surprisingly sweet despite your inability to admit your feelings. Don’t you want all that I can give you?”
“Yes, that's exactly what I'm getting at.” Potter caught his mouth again and ran his fingers down Draco's jawline, his fingers continuing down to undo the button of Draco's collar.
And then there were his eyes which Draco was sure he never noticed before now. If he had, he would surely have been more wary of Potter in school. Those eyes were like a warning. One Draco decided to ignore.
Once Harry had his hand on Malfoy’s cheek, he let out a sigh before stroking downward toward Malfoy’s chin. He let his thumb brush over Malfoy’s bottom lip. He felt warm breath ghosting over him as Malfoy breathed out a slow sigh.
“You’re also a giant pain in the arse.” Potter laughed and then let his hand fall to rest on Draco’s chest.
Harry tore his eyes away from the ceiling to look at his ex-girlfriend. She was in a sequined dress that left nothing to the imagination. Her freckled skin was smooth and pale and inviting. Harry smiled at her. “You look nice, Gin. Beautiful, really. Hot date?”
“Brace yourself, my darling Draco. You and I both know the importance of making an agreeable impression on the pair of them. It is a small miracle that they seem eager to approach us, so we must take advantage,” Pansy said quickly before Mr. Potter and Ms. Granger were upon them.
“Stupid, stupid,” Draco mumbled to himself as he poured a cup of camomile tea. He sipped it, and it burned his tongue. “Doubly stupid, Draco. Way to burn your tongue.”
I looked at the crowd again. Some of them were looking over at us now. I imagine we made an odd pair. The Boy Who Lived and the son of a convicted Death Eater. I wonder what headline would be in the papers about us tomorrow. Would they claim they saw us fighting? Flirting? Something more insidious?
Hermione and I were about to follow when a familiar posh voice came from behind us. “Potter, Hermione, nice to see you.”
Draco blinked at Harry like he was hopelessly moronic. “The bonfires. We’re going to jump them, like all the other too happy people at this stupid festival. We’re going to jump them and accept the good fortune that comes along with it.”
“Ginny will be there. She’s back from America and she’s bringing a date. I just wanted to give you a heads up.”
That one wasn’t true. I only slept with Carlie. The seeker, Janelle, got jealous and threw a fit. “I don’t understand. Sure, I’ve hooked up with a lot of people. You obviously know that. It’s all over the papers and it seems you’ve read all of them.”
Skeeter smiled. “There have been reports in Hogsmeade about adults with full control over their magic suddenly exploding bottles and windows. Seemingly out of nowhere. One even manifested a black cloud that looked dangerously like an Obscurus.”
“Er, no. I suppose I don’t.” Draco tucked a stray piece of hair behind his ear as he spoke. He felt the top of his ear and it was hotter than a kettle. He wondered if Potter noticed how red the tips of his ears must be.
As Harry was off in his mind thinking about how Draco had beamed with pride when he beat harry three times in a row at the seekers game, he didn't realize he had been staring at Draco. Now, however, he was starkly aware and he was also aware that Draco was watching him, too.
I gave him mine without hesitation. I’d barely cast any spells with it in the last few days. Ron hesitated and then handed it over. Robards cast a bubble charm around them to persevere the evidence. It was procedure to exclude the aurors wands, so I wasn’t worried.
Harry Potter’ and not as just Harry, so dating was exhausting even before all that. Then one of my best friends died saving my life.” Potter paused, swallowing hard. “I felt guilty being alive when he wasn’t. Then it sort of spiraled, bringing with it all the other people who were dead because of me. I didn’t know how to be okay with that, and I promised myself I wouldn’t let it happen again, so I decided I was better off alone...until, that is, they partnered me with you.”
“Rush, no, but—uh, Potter…” Draco let the end of what he intended to say trail off, hoping Nikola got his meaning. He was not interested in having Potter watch. Or maybe he was and that was what scared him. Maybe he wanted Potter to see him in a sexual way. That way Potter could fall asleep to thoughts of what Draco’s body felt like.
“Mr. Malfoy, I am inclined to believe you, but on one condition…” Mr. Potter trailed off and quirked an eyebrow, all of his charm restored. It lit up his face with mischief that made Draco’s stomach burn with desire. It was like willingly walking into a burning building. Mr. Potter stood before him, rain-drenched—his robes clinging to the muscles of his torso and arms.
“I knew that,” Draco said, a hint of amusement in his voice. “So I told you mine. Your turn. Fair’s fair.”
“This room is exquisite. The Minister would love to dine here,” Nikola said as he sat down across from Draco. Under the table, Draco felt Nikola’s foot rub up against his calf. The forwardness of the motion surprised Draco. Many of the men he was offered to were private about sex and therefore saved the flirting for when they were alone. Nikola, however, seemed to enjoy open displays of attraction because after he rubbed his foot against Draco’s calf once more, he winked.
,” Potter whispered and smiled against Draco’s fingers. Warm breath escaped his mouth and it caressed Draco’s skin like the first ray of sunlight after a hard winter.
Mindlessly, Hagrid placed an enormous hand on Harry’s shoulder, slightly knocking him off balance and backward into Malfoy who was behind him. The shock of Malfoy catching him before his ass could meet with the fresh powdering of snow was enough to heat Harry’s entire body despite the frigid wind. The reaction to feeling Malfoy’s hands gripping his arms was entirely unexpected. It made Harry’s throat go dry.
Pansy held up a hand. “Even if I had time to test the potion, there would still be some expected side effects, and casting will take more focus than usual.”
“That’s a bit much for one person, don’t you think?” Harry asked, nodding at the glass in Draco’s hand that was more than half full.
Draco didn’t respond. He didn’t move either. Their hands still holding the snitch in place. Draco only blinked a few times in quick succession and then opened his mouth like he was going to say something, but then didn’t.
Dismissing her comment, Draco pointedly asked, “Are you not concerned that there is a massive party happening on your ship, Headmistress?”
“Does anyone else know about this?” Ginny asked, face still somber, but she moved closer to Harry on the bench.
Like I promised, I didn’t bring any alcohol with me, even though the temptation was there and every part of me felt too awake without it. After moving into Grimmauld Place once school was over, I used alcohol for almost everything. Sad? Drink. Mad? Drink. Lonely? Drink. Anxious about being around people? Drink. Drink. Drink. In fact, I couldn’t remember the last time I wasn’t looking at the world through the haze of alcohol or a hangover.
“When both of you hold the mirror it will activate. Have a wonderful day,” Angela said and then looked behind them to the next people in line. “Next?”
The only thing he noticed was the feeling of the bass vibrating through the limo—vibrating through him, as Draco pushed inside of him. Gripping his hips, hard.
Ron winced. “Oh, Merlin, right. I think I blocked that out. So much memorising. Shite, she can be a menace sometimes, eh?”
I felt anger like a white hot iron poker in my gut. I may have gotten a little lost since the war, but nothing mattered more to me than putting bad guys where they belonged. Justice mattered. People’s live’s mattered. And the Ministry was slowly becoming the bad guy and I wasn’t letting them get away with it. Not after I died to save them.
Yet there he was, his green eyes wide, his chest heaving—watching. The knowledge sent a chill down Draco’s spine and he involuntarily twitched forward, shoving himself deeper into Nikola’s mouth. The motion seemed to encourage Nikola to swallow him deeper, to suck harder.
Draco didn't let Potter finish that thought. He crashed his lips to meet Potter's and lost himself in the taste of his partner. Things were heading in a very satisfactory direction before Potter broke away and said, “It was clear that we were both right about why the potion affected me so much, right?”
From behind them, Harry could hear the collective “oooo’s” from their friends who had gathered round the pair of them in a circle when Malfoy had bet him that Harry couldn’t seduce a broom handle without help from Hermione and Ron. And that he, Malfoy, could seduce anyone, anywhere, anytime.
Harry bit his tongue to keep from all the frustrated retorts to Draco’s question, instead settling on repeating himself. “I love you, Draco.”
Ron was standing off to the side, sort of out of sight from the crowd in the makeshift backstage tent area. He watched Hermione on the stage with a smile on his face.
Adeline Greyjoy was odd, sure, like any divination professor would be expected to be, but she wasn’t odd the way Trelawney had been. She seemed perfectly in control of her oddness. Nor was she odd in the way Dumbledore had been odd, not that he was a seer as far as I knew. She didn’t speak in riddles or answer questions with more questions. But she was odd and I didn’t trust her. Not when the trace had lead us directly to her.
“You’ll have about three minutes to make your speech,” Hermione said, sitting down at the table with two cups. She slid one over to Neville. “The
“I knew it,” Potter said after a few moments of silent perusal of the map in question. “I knew there had to be a pattern. I don’t know why I didn’t see it before.”
It was a large bathroom with a deep claw-foot tub and white and black checkered tile walls. The medicine cabinet was lined with small, soft lights which made the room look candle lit.
Draco scowled up at Harry. “You are such a menace, Potter. Always so dramatic. I really could do without the theatrics, you know?” He smirked, and then threw himself on top of Harry, making them both fall back onto the blanket they’d spread over the cool stone floor.
“Well, if it didn’t affect you, then does that mean you didn’t have an already existing attraction?” Potter scrunched his brow. “No, that can’t be it because then the Succubus could have trapped your mind, and she didn’t? That means you had an existing attraction and the potion worked on you?”
He felt that ache return as he watched Potter bite his bottom lip in concentration. It came up from the depths like a treasure washing ashore after years being lost in the ocean. The ache to push Potter’s always wild fringe out of his face. The ache that made his body feel warm when Potter looked at him. He’d managed to banish those urges many times before, but faced with Potter’s strength, his passion, even his pig-headedness, it was all Draco could do to keep from panting like a crup in heat.
? Draco considered. Then he thought, maybe it was a prank. Potter and his mates were always pulling pranks this year. Every product Weasleys Wizards Wheezes ever concocted had shown up on campus now that students could truly relax for the first time in years.
On his way to the dining room, Draco took the path that brought him past his mother’s portrait. It hung, life-sized in the foyer. For the last month, Draco avoided it. He took any path through the Manor that avoided the hall where she hung, even the tediously long ones.
“I’m a curse breaker, Potter, you think your silly wards can stop me?” Pansy spoke and brushed some ash off of the fronts of her robes, then she slicked her hair down and tucked it behind her ears.
Harry growled out Draco’s name, but he wasn’t listening. He had started unfastening Harry’s trousers, sliding them down enough to get a better grip on things, so to speak. He nipped at Harry’s lower lip. The sharpness of his teeth sent a jolt of pleasure to Harry’s fingers and toes. Draco knew exactly what to do to drive a moan from Harry’s lips.
Charlie pointed to the back of the garden. “He got here a few minutes before you guys and immediately said he wanted to check on some plants they rooted last week.”
Every part of Draco was shouting at him. Some parts ordered him to extricate himself from this line of inquiry before he internally combusted, but other parts of him begged him to stay put and see what other interesting things would come out of Mr. Potter’s mouth.
Figuring he was committed and already as embarrassed as he could get, Harry asked the only logical question he could think of. “Can I see for myself since my hand is already basically there?”
And it would have been a great plan, if the Prophet hadn’t written an article about Harry and Ginny being spotted canoodling on a bench in Hogsmead last weekend. The headlines were anything but subtle, suggesting a million things that were anything but true. However, that didn’t stop every witch and wizard who read it from eyeing him awkwardly, or coming up and asking him when this ‘miracle’ had happened.
“I love him, Charlie. This isn’t just a crush, or some fleeting attraction. As crazy as it is, I love him.” Harry said this and finally realized how ridiculous he was being. He was trying to make Draco jealous instead of just telling him how he felt.
Hermione nodded and after one more warning to make sure I wasn’t late, I headed out of the teacher’s lounge and down the long corridors of Hogwarts.
In a fit of rage that billowed up from inside Draco like a volcano erupting after years of dormancy, he backhanded Granger—
Malfoy smiled slowly, it started in his eyes and then spread across his whole face like the slow rise of curtains on a stage, and finally dropped the snowball he had been holding mid-throw. It made a plonk as it hit the fresh powdering. “It is soft, Potter, but I am still a little confused.”
“You are getting too good at that, Gin,” Harry laughed and saw his breath cloud in front of his face like the steam of the Hogwarts Express engine as it steamrolled to it’s destination.
So, that brought Harry to Luna and Ginny’s flat at seven in the morning because Luna insisted working as the sun rose (supposedly to better avoid the Nargles). That is how he found himself seated across the small circular wooden table from Luna who had parchment and quill ready to take notes.
Most people reacted the same way to Voldemort’s name or any mention of him at all. They mostly flinch. Once, I would have called them cowards, but now I understand the fear better. It freezes you. There’s a moment, just a moment, where your mind forgets he’s dead and suddenly you are back there in the war and Voldemort is alive. He can hurt you again. The body reacts, the mind doesn’t understand right way. Those few seconds feel like dying. The only way out of the feeling, is through it. Fear becomes part of you and the way you think. It makes you anxious, suspicious, but it also makes you safe. Malfoy was familiar with Voldemort’s cruelty and control. I only knew because at his trial they made him take veritaserum and asked him to recount what it was like when Voldemort lived in his home. He had been sobbing by the end of his trial recounting all the ways he was tortured. I remember his face and body were covered in bruises as he leaned over his his chair, shaking. The binds were so tight, he couldn’t even bring his hands up to his face to hide his crying from the Wizengamot.
Harry fumbled in his pocket for the Lock Box. Finally, he managed to pull it free and toss it to Malfoy. He caught it and placed it at the Succubus’s feet then said the incantation to open the Lock Box.
Anger bubbled inside of Harry. He felt it just below the surface like a volcano building pressure before blowing. Malfoy was the one who knocked into the shelf. He was the one who attempted a Scourgify that just happened to make the mess disappear along with the entire store closet.
The only reason he knew she was still there was the occasional growl she let out when moving out of the way of a spell, and the pressure of her own magic as it worked itself on him, into him. He bit the inside of his cheek to stay focused, the pain helping him ignore how badly he wanted to lay down in the alley and let her finish him off. It wouldn’t be a bad death, really. He’d get to experience pleasure, unhampered by all his guilt. It would be like falling asleep on the beach in summer.
Images flashed through his mind of pinning Draco down on the pitch, the dew of the grass moist on their bodies as they tangled themselves around one another, Harry’s hands free to roam the pale expanse of Draco’s thighs. Free to pull at the hem of Draco’s shirt and slip across the taut muscles of his abdomen.
“We are close to the forest,” Lamont said. “Might be interfering since there is so much magic in there.”
It was the same map that had been behind Robards in the conference room, only smaller. All of the recent death locations were marked in red. Potter picked up one of Draco’s quills
“I know what it looks like when someone is trying to implode their life. I’ve been on that particular edge myself.”
Lamont nodded but looked torn about leaving Robards with us. If he was concerned, he didn’t voice it. Instead he jogged to Reed and they both headed out of the cemetery.
“One of the Slytherin first years told me about them. They’re called ‘biker shorts.’ Apparently, muggles have things they ride which are similar to brooms. Though they don’t fly.”
“Deal,” he said, extending his slender hand toward Harry. For a moment, Harry hesitated then reached out. Malfoy thought he had the upper hand, and in a sense he did. What he didn’t know was that Harry already knew how Draco felt about him. In fact, Harry had known for two months now.
“Is there some rush?” Nikola asked innocently while rubbing his thigh against Draco’s now throbbing groin.
“—and so I said, fuck this! I will leave when I am good and ready,” Potter said, laughing. He picked up a bottle, which whooped and in response he whooped back. “Anyways, I doubt that Robards will like having me in training come end of summer, but he will have to get over it.”
Draco stood up, using the chair’s armrests to keep him steady. He wondered if they’d given Potter a Pepper-Up potion because he looked like he’d just awoken from a good night's sleep, whereas Draco felt like he’d been up for 72 hours straight. “Of course,” Draco said, a yawn muffling his speech a bit. “Wanted to make sure you were okay.”
Weaved into all of the challenges, friendship bloomed like wildflowers in a field. It was evident in their speech. Still bickering, but with greater understanding. Certain things were off limits and they stayed that way. Harry never mentioned Draco’s parents or the dark mark, and Draco stopped calling Harry a martyr. He had refused, however, to refrain from calling Harry ‘the Saviour’ because he claimed it was too bloody funny to see Harry roll his eyes whenever he did.
Lucius would not let his son embarrass him in front of the Dark Lord, so last week he pushed Draco to resort to physical violence in order to obtain results. At first, Draco had been horrified by the idea if only because he did not want to run the risk of injuring himself or destroying the silky smoothness of his skin with scars. Brute force had never really been his area. However, once he engaged in it, he found that he quiet enjoyed the physicality of it.
Ron’s lips quirked into a smile. “I know. Just sucks in the meantime. She can do the silent treatment better than anyone.“
“Merlin, are all the witches in my life this perceptive?” Harry let out a huff of a laugh and continued, “I realized I liked men about two months after Ginny and I split up. I didn’t really have time to consider who I was attracted to while at Hogwarts. I was slightly preoccupied with other things.”
Still handsome as ever, Draco cooed internally, allowing himself one moment to wallow over his unrequited feelings before shutting them away to gather dust like forgotten furniture in a boarded up house. These emotions did not become him, nor did they matter in any significant manner as it was abundantly and ardently clear that Mr. Potter had not changed his opinion in regard to Draco since school.
“You taste delicious,” the raven-haired Succubus said, her voice husky and breathy. She licked along the line of his jaw as her hands raked down his chest, undoing a few buttons in the process.
“Oh, that’s wonderful,” Neville said inbetween sips of tea. He looked genuinely pleased. “You’ll be running things in no time.”
As Draco locked eyes with Mr. Potter the room seemed to slow around him as if time itself were giving him an extra moment of Mr. Potter’s attentions. Draco watched Mr. Potter speaking to his companions. His many admirable features flooded Draco’s senses. Mr. Potter’s dark hair framed his olive-toned face and unkempt as it was, still managed to look handsome. His verdant eyes, searched the ballroom with apparent interest, alight with amiability. His supple lips, which he licked after sipping from his champagne flute, were the perfect specimens—like two soft tulip petals in spring.
After that, everything had passed in a blur. Snape showing up mere seconds after the closet disappeared. Yelling. So much yelling. Malfoy yelped once and Harry had to stifle a laugh because the distinct purple color Snapes face was turning indicated that laughing would only make things worse.
“Mm, yeah,” Draco said with none of his usual bragging after a win. His face was scrunched up in thought and he looked everywhere but at Harry. His hand was tightly wrapped around the snitch.
I didn’t know what she meant. These were the first visions I’d had that weren’t planted into my head by Voldemort. She couldn’t mean those could she? Hardly anyone knew about that outside of the Order. “Do you mean the visions Voldemort placed in my mind when he felt like hurting me?”
Hermione considered and then took a sip of her tea. “Yes, I think they might, or they might have before…” She trailed off and her yes slid over to me. We both knew she blamed me for shifting the focus off of her edicts by taking the law into my own hands. I had been one of the head people backing her edicts, but with my reputation at the Ministry a bit…tarnished, she was having trouble moving forward.
Malfoy was one of the people who watched Harry and Ron. He wore a quiet scowl that made him look like a governess who was upset that you couldn’t learn the difference between formal
Suddenly, Potter’s hands were off the door and cupping Draco’s face—tilting his chin down. Then Potter slipped his tongue into Draco’s mouth and hummed softly. His hands gripped Draco’s face tighter as he deepened the kiss.
“Umm, to put it bluntly,” Draco snapped. He crossed his arms in front of his chest. Yup, this headmaster was decidedly very much like Dumbledore. She pulled no punches.
There was another whoop of cheers from the crowd. Luna held a finger to her lips to shush them. “We have gone a bit unconventional.”
The walkway was also cobblestone with small bright yellow flowers bordering it. We followed it to the wooden door and even on the threshold, I could hear the sounds of conversation that indicated a large group of people in a small space.
“Malfoy, the victim,” Harry whispered, his wand hand still outstretched. He shook violently now, unable to cast.
I nodded in understanding the divination professors were always quirky, if not completely insane. “How’s it been here? I haven’t seen you much since you started teaching.” Changing the subject was the only safe way to avoid having to answer his question.
“Wasn’t it? You’ve made it perfectly clear that I’m inferior to you in your treatment of me as your partner, even though I try harder with you than I have ever tried with anyone. It’s never enough for you, and I doubt it ever will be.” Draco was trembling now, every part of him too awake with sensation. He wanted to run, to hide away until the potion left his system so he could go back to ignoring his feelings for Potter in peace.
I heard it before I saw anything. The sound of hundreds of flies swarming, buzzing, in my ears. I focused harder. Closed my eyes tight and saw it. The man sobbing in front of the rock. His back hunched and shaking with each new cry. I still heard the buzzing but it was far away, or at least it sounded far away. The rest of the forest was turning to rot. The trees were black with their bark cracking off in patches. The ground under my feet was the only green patch left in this obscene vision. The man slammed his fist on the rock and the sound of his bones crunching against the stone made my stomach turn.
fool. The Dark Lord reveals his plans to no one, let alone some Russian slag whose magic is like a hill to the mountain that is Lord Voldemort.”
“Don’t do that to yourself, Harry,” Ron said. He was attempting to cast another trace spell, just in case, but it behaved the same way. The magic floated around and around, never settling or identifying magic. “His death isn’t on you.”
Harry tried to control his face. He was happy to hear that they hadn’t kissed yet. In a way, it meant that Harry still had a chance. If he could just get the courage up. “Oh, course, mate. My lips are sealed.” Harry then mimed locking his lips and throwing away the key.
Hermione smiled, I think. Like I said, it’s hard to tell with fire-calls. “See you in a bit, Harry.”
This particular point, Draco noticed, the Dark Lord agreed on wholeheartedly which meant his father chimed in on how deplorable it was for a muggle to be allowed access to their world. Honestly, what civilized society would encourage the mingling of bloodlines so visibly, his father had said and Draco was so bored he almost forgot to nod in aggressive agreement.
Conversation over, Potter turned his attention back on the files. He flipped through them, presumably looking for his map. He tossed another file onto Draco’s desk and pulled a few more out of his bottom drawer and began flicking through them frantically. Draco rolled his eyes because if Potter would just get off his high horse and ask, he could have told Potter that the map he was searching for was in the top drawer of Draco’s desk where it belonged, and they could have avoided all of this mess.
“I want…” he started, then leaned forward enough that their noses brushed. He smelled the whisky on Draco, and felt the warmth of his breath. “I think I’m going to kiss you.”
It was clear Ned was interested in Malfoy, and Harry hated it. He was five seconds away from grabbing Malfoy by the arm and tugging him away from that man’s stupid gaze. It was pure willpower that kept him from acting on his impulse.
“Merlin, what was I thinking,” he mumbled again. As he stood up, the flames of the fire flickered a deep green. Someone was trying to come through. Only a handful of people had access to the Manor’s Floo network. His mother had access, but as his house-elf, Pinky, informed him when he arrived home, she was still in France. Pansy had access, but usually she called first to ask if it was okay to drop in. And, of course, the Ministry had an emergency policy for all employees to give access to Minister Shacklebolt, as well as to their direct boss, so Head Auror Robards has access, too. It could be him come to yell at Draco for skipping the debrief. But something like hope flickered in Draco’s chest like a flame in a soft breeze. His partner also had access to the Manor via Floo.
“We made it over that fire. Legend says we are a perfect match,” Harry said, explaining his thinking. He could feel every part of his body aching to pull Draco into a kiss, but he took a steadying breath. “You never know until you do it. Deliberating about something can only get you so far. Better to try and know for sure, I think.” Harry hoped his voice sounded steadier than his heart felt, less invested in the outcome. For several long moments, there was only the white noise of the festival around them and the sound of both their breathing.
Potter shrugged. “It was starting to grow on me, actually. I thought we made some good progress back there with all that honesty stuff.”
Feeling emboldened by Pansy’s admission that Draco wanted him, Harry moved closer to Draco. It was everything he could do to not push Draco back on the desk and snog him right then and there. “She called me a cock in front of my department.”
“No, Merlin, no. I mean, I get why you did it. The guy was hurting his kid. It was madness, but Hermione and I were on it. We were using proper channels to get him out of there.”
“You okay?” Harry found himself unable to avoid asking the question. At that moment, nothing seemed more interesting than whatever was going through Malfoy’s head.
The rain was turning all the dirt to mud around me and I slipped a bit as I tried to stand. I toppled to my hands and knees. The pain was still there in my gut like a reminder. It was dull, but persistent.
“Ooh, I have one,” Luna said. She walked to Potter’s side, pulled him down to her level and whispered something to him. All the while, she was bouncing back and forth from one foot to the other. Her excitement was palpable. The rest of the group watched with smiles on their faces; some good natured, others, in Draco’s mind, seemed smug.
“I may be tipsy, but I’m not stupid enough to drink outside in the freezing cold without a warming charm.”
“Only if I can drink the last of the firewhiskey,” Ron said matter-of-factly and poured the remainder of the firewhiskey into his glass and tilted it towards Harry.
“Ah, yes.” Mr. Potter made a show of sighing heavily and rolling his eyes.“I recall your harsh stance on frivolity.”
Yet other nights, nights like the last, Draco had the displeasure of reliving every excruciating moment. The details so sharp and so poignant that he would wake with the sickening taste of lavender oil in his mouth. After those nights, waking was as impossible as it was unpleasant.
“You’re my partner, Potter. Like it or not, that means I will help you even when you don’t want my help. Plus, you’re right, the Succubus will kill again tonight, and we need to stop it before it does. You were already going to do this, so no sense in arguing and wasting time. I think I finally learned that lesson as your partner. And this way, I will at least be there to help this time.”
“Very true,” Draco said, side-eyeing Harry playfully, then continued, “All right, all right, what’s the question, Potter?”
As they both soared upward in search of the snitch, Harry’s mind went positively mental. It was one thing to know Draco valued these games as much as Harry did, but it was another to suspect—hope— that Draco was as affected by him as he was by Draco. Harry had noted Draco’s gulp at seeing Harry bare-chested—his adam’s apple bobbed under the tight streak of skin of his throat.
The intensity of Potter’s eyes was like watching a thunderstorm roll in over the sea. First there was electricity, then raging waters, then pure, unadulterated tension as the air was heavy with expectation. Draco felt it building in him, all the years of tension between them, all of the fights, the push and pull like waves on the shore. As much unspoken between them as had been said, as much known as unknown—could never be known.
“No, I don’t want to talk. All we’ve done all year is talk about what life would be like when school was over. I want to know. I want to act.” Harry squeezed Draco’s hands in his, brought them to his lips and kissed Draco’s knuckles. He lowered his voice to a whisper. “I want you. Don’t you want me?”
Draco went hot all over as Potter's hand touched him. He laughed into their kiss, feeling Potter smile. The fireplace crackled, the only noise in the room beside their breathless moans as Potter slipped Draco's robe off and did to him what Draco had been dying to do each time he laid eyes on Potter.
Resolutely, Draco sank into his chair and broke off a corner of the scone. It was sweet in his mouth and he founce his appetite for the first time in a long time. The scone was gone before he realized and in a manner so unlike his own, Draco piled bacon and eggs onto his plate and shoved them into his mouth with all the grace of a giant eating a carcass.
“Ryder, would you mind if we discussed potions later? My date, Harry, well he needs something to drink, so we are going to go find some whisky. Pardon us?”
Hermione snorted from ahead of us. It was clear she could hear our conversation but had nothing to add to it except her contempt.
Harry still gave no answer. It wasn’t as if he were trying to be rude. It was simply that he had no idea what he was doing. Well, he knew he was attempting to touch Malfoy’s face, but the rest of him hadn’t quite caught up to the why part yet.
Harry Potter.’” Draco couldn’t stop the words from coming anymore than he could stop himself loving Potter. They flowed from him freely as if the potion broke a dam of emotion that had been the only thing keeping him sane.
“Only seeing you, Mother,” Draco said. His throat felt like sandpaper. The words hurt as they came out like his body opposed them.
“Is it also forward if I say that I've been thinking about your lips all day and that if you don't put me out of my misery soon and kiss me, I might…”
Neville cracked a smile and looked less freaked out. Then his eyes lit up and he said, “If you want, I can set you up with this bloke I met at a Herbology conference in France?”
Pansy turned to Draco and made a face that said ‘talk some sense into your partner before I hit him with a Bat-Bogey Hex.’ If Draco were a smarter man, he wouldn’t push the subject and he would let Potter run off and be the rash, pig-headed hero he was born to be, but deep down, Draco knew he wouldn’t stop Potter. And he certainly wouldn’t let him run into a Succubus den without backup either.
“Oh, right,” Potter started, “well, Hermione and I tinkered with Neville’s old Remembrall to make it reveal what it is you’ve forgotten. Took a lot of charm work, but it seems to work most of the time.”
Harry wasn’t shocked that Malfoy had made the same connections as he had. Ron’s case had been the talk of the DMLE for weeks. But he was curious about the instability of the spell. Harry didn’t feel anything wrong with the candles, or the magic it was focusing from the Ley Lines. Either Harry was off his game thanks to the second bite the Succubus had taken from him, or Malfoy was bluffing.
“I think so. I see golden dust wrapping itself around me.” I held my hand up experimentally and watched the golden dust move with me. It was like it had attached itself to my person.
I took off toward it. I didn’t wait for Ron, Hermione, or Malfoy, but I heard them running behind me. Malfoy swearing about improper footwear for a chase.
The music drifted through the limo like a vibrating pulse. Harry could feel it in his bones. The night was alive with possibility, which might explain why he had the unrelenting urge to slip his hand under Draco’s waistband and work his cock until it was hard.
“It just seems odd that a Succubus would suddenly pop up and start killing like this,” Auror Read pushed. “Where has it been all this time? Why now?”
“Draco, is that you?” It was his father. His tone was that of annoyance, though he was trying to conceal it, so it meant Draco hadn’t missed anything too significant in the morning debriefing. If he had, then surely he would have heard the crack of his father’s cane across his back before he heard his voice.
Still straddling him, Draco took his hands and put them on Harry’s chest which was rising and falling in quick, short breaths. Draco’s hands were shaking. “I feel, uh, like we should maybe revisit this again when we haven’t been drinking. Make sure it’s something we both really want.”
I opted for standing even though the effort of running through the forest was catching up to me now that my adrenaline was fading. I wanted to be ready if she tried something. I felt a pain in my right side as I tried to steady my breaths. “I’d still like to know how you knew it was us out here.”
Draco said his mates had been asking questions, too, but all he had to do was give them one withering stare and they dropped the subject—at least they dropped it around him. But that didn’t stop them and everyone else from trying to understand the seemingly friendly manner in which Harry and Draco seemed to regard one another suddenly.
She moved in closer to me, linking our arms and then huffed. I looked down at her and saw on her forearm the fading mudblood scar there. It wasn’t completely legible anymore, but I knew what it said. So did she. She smiled up at me.“Together then?”
“You say you cast all the spells, Weasley?” Robards asked when Ron finished recounting what happened.
The overflow of whatever Potter was doing made its way into Draco’s space. He could see the edge of a file on the most recent study of Life Energy magic and why those who became Succubi had to give up the ability to cast spells or brew potions. And recently meant 1543, before such studies were banned altogether by the Ministry for fear that other witches would learn how to become Succubi and thus pass down the knowledge. Best to snuff it out, erase it from history. That was the wizarding way when it came to any magic deemed dangerous by the powers that be.
The air was crisp against his skin and the snow was falling slowly like it would in a snow globe; slow and obstructed by some invisible force. And Draco looked magnificent. His flying had always been brilliant, but he had grown more impulsive since the war and it showed in his flying.
In the back of Dean and Seamus’s yard, behind some more mystical creature statues that almost functioned like a wall, there was a miniature hedge maze. The hedges came up to my chest so you couldn’t get lost in there unless you were a small child. I spotted Neville at the back of the maze bending over the hedge with clippers in his hands. I needed to go through the maze to get to him and even though I knew I wouldn’t get lost, all I could think about was fourth year and that maze and Cedric. It took me a full minute to force one foot in front of the other.
