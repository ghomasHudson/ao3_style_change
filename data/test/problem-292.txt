“I’ve been… depressed.  Like, clinically depressed.  I’ve… er… been seeing a Mind Healer for the past four months.”
“Draco, do you want—?”
“No!  I had noticed the past couple of weeks him trying to change his hair color to match his toys, but he hadn’t succeeded until now!  What a smart, beautiful child, you are!” she cooed to her grandson.
“Where is Nev, though?”
Deciding it wouldn’t hurt anything, he quickly took a shower and then went to see who he would find in the Common Room.  Descending the spiral staircase, his ears were assaulted by a loud “HARRY!” and a blur of ginger and brunette heads were seen as Ginny and Hermione both launched themselves at him.  The three of them stood like that for a bit, until Ron came and wrapped his arms around them all.
“Which is completely understandable!  I am, too, but I’m trying to keep my cool, to help alleviate your stress.”
had put there.  He had been very careful since going back to school to not let Harry see it.  He knew that Harry would be absolutely horrified if and when he saw it, and he hadn’t wanted to get into it in the middle of their dorm, just as their friendship had been forming.
“May I join you?” Draco asked from the seat across from where Harry carefully set the book down.
They made their way into the room.  Harry picked up his bag that he had packed the night before, shrinking it and putting it in his pocket.
“I haven’t gotten to these yet, but I think I am going to turn those two,” he pointed to the bedrooms that Molly & Arthur and Fred & George had used when they stayed there with the Order, “into a large guest suite.  It’ll be just a little smaller than mine, but I think there will be enough room for a small sitting area, too.  I figure you two will be the ones using it the most, so I will want your opinions on some things.”
Regaling his captive audience with his tales of his godson, Harry quickly lost track of time.  Before he knew it, it was coming on 6:00.  “Oh, I’d better get home and finish packing,” Harry said.
Hermione laughed as Draco got up and went and hugged both her and Ron, before sitting back beside Harry.
“Huh?  Sorry.  I’m just trying to figure out how I managed to get from the top level of the Knight Bus to the stoop, and rang the doorbell, all whilst being unconscious.  It just doesn’t make sense.”
“Yeah, but I know others will be here any moment.”
Draco rolled his eyes as he pulled a chain out from under his shirt, which held the ring.  “Didn’t want mother seeing, so I borrowed a chain out of your wardrobe.”  Putting it back under his collar, he paused a moment, hands on his hips.  "Am I waiting for another question, or can we go now?"
“Oh.  Of course.  Follow me.”
Draco stood up as well, and looked at Hermione.  “I owe you an apology as well, Granger.  I was a pompous snot when I was younger—well, I still am, but I'm working on it.  I've had horrible ideals drilled into my head all my life.  It has finally occurred to me how wrong they all are.  I'm sorry for calling you that horrible name.  And I'm even more sorry about all the things that occurred at the Manor in April.”
Harry turned around and pulled Draco into his lap, clutching him hard around the waste.  He started sobbing.  “I’m so sorry!  I’m so sorry that I put you through all of this.  I didn’t know how… I didn’t know what to do.”  The last few words came out as a whisper.
“Hmmm, that could be arranged.”
“Good morning, Harry!  Are you ready to go?”
“Nothing, I just twisted wrong and got a pain in my back,” he said as he glared at Harry, who quirked his eyebrow up.  Draco gave him a look.
Harry released his arms from around Draco as he started shifting around.  He watched as Draco sat up against the headboard.  “Okay, I’m up,” he said, blinking at Harry.
“Circe, I was a bastard, huh?” He looked up at Harry, who just smiled and said, “Was?” with a shit-eating grin.
Harry swallowed the rest of his coffee before standing, offering Draco his hand.  “You’re right, let’s go.  We’ve got a lot to get done when we get home, before the festivities begin.”
“Sorry, am I interrupting something?”  Harry asked, glancing behind Ron to where he could see Hermione sitting on the bed, looking flushed.
“Okay, Teddy, your Nana said that you were only allowed to open two present right now.”
“Absolutely!” Hermione said as she turned to go down to the kitchen.
“The Ferret and I were just discussing our lots in life, is all.  Everything is fine.” Ron gave a small smile.
“You should probably go take a shower and get dressed,” Draco said quietly, plucking at a few hairs.  “You know you’re always running late.”
The sky was heavy with clouds, so the lights still were on as they walked hand in hand down the road.  They stopped and got a coffee and a bagel, and then stepped into the alley to disapparate.  Harry leaned over to give Draco a kiss, saying, “I’ll see you tonight.  6:00 at the Manor, right?”
Coming back to himself, Harry nodded and made his way around to the back side.  Finding the names he was looking for, he stood for a couple of moments, and then made his way back towards Draco.  Turning, he noticed that Ron and Hermione were already at the gate, but had stopped to wait on them.  Quickly, they made their way to the gate.
The lay like that for several minutes, as their hearts stopped racing and their breath became normal.
Draco gripped back, but just shook his head.  “No, trust me, 30 days is plenty.  I was only there for three, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone, not even those assholes.  However, I might be willing, just this once.”  He smiled at Harry.
A sense of dread filled Harry.  Which scar was he going to ask about? Everyone knew about the lightning bolt.  But he had gained several more during the war, so the possibilities were numerous.  He turned around and looked back up at Draco.  “Yes?”
“Do you trust me?” Draco nodded.  “Then close your eyes.  You are definitely going to be glad you did.”
“Ron, we’ve been over this.  No more fighting.  And speaking of, I don’t want to interrupt those two,” nodding his head towards the kitchen.  “I think I should lea—.”
“Yep!  Get your cloak; Draco insists!”  He handed her the letter, and she saw that sure enough, Draco had requested that she join them that afternoon.
Kreacher had completely outdone himself.  There was an entire Christmas feast laid out on the table, including a full turkey, casseroles, pies of every kind imaginable, and fruit salads.  There were trays upon trays of nibbles, too.
At that moment, a tray came floating out of the fireplace.  Harry called for Kreacher, asking the elf to take the things to the kitchen.
“Oh, Ron!  It’s beautiful!”  She finally looked up at him, leaning forward to kiss him.
“But… Wha… How’s that possible?  I mean, I know for a
He discussed the techniques that could be used, referencing their books and other writings.  Harry tried to pay attention, but his eyes kept falling back to Draco’s hands.
I thought I would go ahead and post a new chapter, which will then motivate me to write some more!
Narcissa loved the scarf that they had picked out for her on their trip, as well as the set of earrings that Harry had picked out.  Andromeda received a set of earrings, as well, along with a delicate shawl.
“She thank you again for the necklace?” George asked with a snicker.
“I feel a bit guilty, being here and not there, but they insisted.”
The both laughed.  “We both have the next week off, so we’ll be okay for one night.  Besides, It will make it even more special to have him on Christmas Eve.”  He squeezed Teddy, hiking him up on his hip.  “Is there anything special he needs for Father Christmas?”
“When I pulled the carpet up, the wood was underneath, so I sanded it down, and put this lovely stain on it.  I decided that the plain brick fireplace was too boring, so I completely took it apart, and made it sandstone.  My favorite part, though, is the windows.”
He saw Harry shake hands with the man, and then turn to walk back towards Draco.
“Thanks.  I decided to just get new everything.  Some of the plates and things had chips and cracks.  I chose something more to my liking.  What do you think?”  He desperately wanted her approval.
Draco rolled his eyes and crossed his arms with a huff. “Well, that’s his name, isn’t it? I can’t really call him The Weasel all the time, can I?”
She looked up at their families and friends and asked the same question.
“I’ll just be gone for a few minutes.  You’re my friend, too, Draco.  Hell, you’ve been more of a friend than he has, lately, which, if someone would have told me that 15 years ago, I would have sent them to the Janice Thickey Ward.  Let me slap him around a little.  It’ll make me feel better about the whole thing, and maybe get you some answers.”
“Baby, breathe.  I’ve got everything we need, and then some.  I promise.  This vacation is supposed to be relaxing and an opportunity for us to spend time together.  No stress.  Say it.”
He thought.
“Yeah.  However, you four will soon realize that it’s inevitable that we will fight. We’re Potter and Malfoy, after all.  But, I’ve heard it said that making up is the best part.”  He looked over at Draco with heated eyes, and was dazed to see the same looking back at him.  Draco leant in for a lingering kiss.
Once they stepped back, Harry continued.  “Yeah, that was my plan, anyway.  I’m going to fix up the other bath, and then this room is Teddy’s.  Draco painted it awhile back, but then we moved on to other rooms, and it never got completely finished.  It does have a cot, though, in case Andy needs a break.”  He opened the door and showed them the pale green room, with plush carpet, and a white cot against the far wall.
He had just stepped onto the bottom stair to head up to his room, when he heard a clank coming from the kitchen.  Kreacher wouldn’t be back from Hogwarts until the weekend unless he called for him, so there shouldn’t be anyone down there.
“Well, congratulations, again!  Oh, I wish I could have been there to see Molly’s reaction!  I can’t believe no one told me.”  He shook his head.  “Anyway, here, let me take your cloaks.”  He waited for them to take off their cloaks, putting them in the closet in the hallway, right outside the sitting room door.
He could see her usually pinched face relax, eyes widening slightly.  Harry swore he saw a small smile on her face as she said, “Thank you for the invitation, Harry.”  Harry grinned at the use of his given name.  “I'd be honoured.”
“Neither of you were at breakfast, but I know you both need something in your stomachs.  Come on, eat up.”
Harry didn’t know where that had come from.  Draco was still holding his hand and smiling as Harry looked over at him with wide eyes and a gaping mouth.  All that could come out of his mouth as a hissed, “What?”
“Can’t imagine why,” Draco hummed.
By the time Harry stepped out of his bedroom, freshly showered and wearing a pair of dark denims and a light grey button-down shirt, he and his friends had decorated Grimmauld, set most of the food up under stasis charms, and he'd figured out what he was going to say to Draco.  He paused a moment at the top of the stairs to take a deep breath, and then started down to the sitting room.
“Wait, you had lunch with the Minister of Magic” Blaise asked in awe.
“Masters,” Kreacher said, causing them both to turn and walk into the room.  Harry felt his jaw drop, but was too preoccupied looking around the room to even realize that he was gaping.
“Yeah!  That would be fun!” Alicia added.
Kinglsey sighed.  “Very well.  We will begin with Mr Rooks’ tesitimony.  Sir?”  He gestured for the first man to sit in the chair in the middle of the floor, facing the risers.
“Yeah.  I really was going to take you to get some hot chocolate ice cream, but then I decided I’d better do this now, or else I would lose my nerve.”
He then set to work on unbuttoning Draco’s crisp white shirt.  Draco just sat there and let Harry move his appendages around as he removed his clothing.  He had Draco stand just long enough to remove his slacks, and then manoeuvred him to lay up on the bed.
“So, I take it your mum didn’t like your news?” Harry asked.
Happy New Year!  Hope the holidays were wonderful for everyone.
“What do you mean we looked weird?”
“Inside the pouch was a ring.  He handed it over to me and said that he gave his permission and blessings on the condition that I take the diamond out of your grandfather’s Malfoy family ring, and use it in your engagement ring.
Harry placed a hand on Ron’s arm as the man started fidgeting.
“You have to unwrap your gift, first.”  Draco stood at the foot of the bed, stark naked, except for he had a reindeer-head shaped cover on his cock, antlers and all.
They stepped out of the fireplace, waving a hello to Tom, and then walked out back to the brick wall that led into Diagon Alley.
“Harry, did you notice anything strange right before Draco showed up?”
“Ze end of April, ze healer sayz,” Fleur said as she rubbed her growing belly.
“Yeah, I wasn’t planning on it.  I was supposed to be helping Mal—” He stopped himself, turning red.
“What about them?  All I care about is you.  You and me, that’s all I need.”
They'd been together for three-and-a-half years, now.  It had taken nearly as long for them to admit that they liked each other, though.
“Right.  Well, I was able to fix my broken wand, the one that I got when I was 11, so I was not in need of his wand anymore.  After I decided to put the Elder Wand back where it belonged, I came to the conclusion that I would give Draco back his wand.  I wanted to do it properly, though, so I went and spoke with Ollivander.  He told me about an incatation and ritual that could be used to give control of a wand to another person.”
“Thank you.”
“Please, Draco.  I want this.  I want this with you.”
Shaking his head, he was reminded of their first date. Harry had sat in the restaurant for 45 minutes, waiting, hoping he wasn't being stood up. He had finally decided (after getting sympathy looks from nearly everyone in the dining room, as well as all of the servers) that it wasn't worth it, and decided to leave when suddenly in walked Draco Malfoy, looking like the radiant sun. Harry knew at that moment that he would wait until the end of time for that man. And wait he had.
Just before the Quidditch pitch, Harry made his way over to the new monument that stood just off the path.  He walked around to the other side, and finding what he was looking for, stared longingly at his mother’s name, before touching it and the name of his father, etched in the marble.  He then walked back over to the path, where Draco was still standing, watching the raven-haired man.
“Merry Christmas!”  Harry walked over to them, shaking Bill’s hand and giving Fleur a hug.  She kissed him on the cheek, and as he pulled back he realized— “Oh, my goodness!”
“Harry? What are you doing home?  I told you to stay at work!”  He stood at at the top of the next landing, having come out of the study.
Draco cupped his hands, lifting some water up to Harry’s shoulders, where he started massaging him.  Harry moaned as Draco’s thumbs pressed into his stiff muscles.
“The only reason I learned, was because I
“Truly, we are so grateful that you did this.  I had wanted to tell everyone, especially my mother, but knew that it would be better if it was just us.  But, this makes my heart so happy.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, and thank you for letting us come here, and performing the ceremony.  I don’t know how we will ever repay you.”
“So, we decided we’re going to elope.”  That caused everyone to jump up from the couch, grins on their faces.”
What happened to Draco?!
Harry could swear he heard Draco snort quietly at that.
They stood there looking at each other for a moment, and then Draco almost seemed to almost melt onto the couch.
Draco leaned back, grabbing his wand from beside him.  He lightly slapped Harry’s thigh, who took the hint and gripped his calves, pulling his legs up to his chest.
He turned and went up the stairs to their bedroom.  He returned less than ten minutes later, Harry still in the same spot.
“Fine, here.  Open this.”
At first, he didn’t know what he was going to do with it, but then the idea of having a non-formal living space came to him.  He didn’t sleep at all that night, getting his aggression out by painting and replacing the floor and transfiguring the walls to add shelving.  He had gone shopping for furniture the day before, and while in the store, had fallen in love with a large muggle recliner.  He felt a little foolish, but it was so comfortable, he didn’t care.  He got a television and a new DVD player that the man said Harry ‘just had to have.’
Harry could feel his eyes beginning to water.  “Yeah, bud, he did.  My daddy and your daddy were best friends.”
Harry walked out of the room, going down to the lounge.  He pulled out a piece of parchment, quickly writing an answer back.  He raced back up to where the owl still sat, tying on his response and giving the bird an owl treat that he had found on the desk.
They all laughed as Ron tossed it back to him.
“Thanks.  Got him a couple of days ago.  Still getting used to the idea, if I’m being honest.”  He flicked his wand and a few owl treats came and landed on the table.  Harry put them in his hand, and the owl came over and nipped them from his palm.  Harry rubbed the birds head.
Draco howled, pulling Harry towards him again, and sliding his hand down towards his cock.
“Bloody hell, mate.”
Draco gave Harry a perplexed look, but slid his finger under the spellotape, and took the paper off.  He lifted the lid and gasped.
“Thank you.  I got it in Diagon back in November.  So, where do we want to start?  Friends or family?”
“Mr Potter! Are you shopping for Hogwarts?  Does that mean that you won’t be joining the Aurors this fall?”
Harry groaned as he stretched, back aching; apparently, the cushioning charm they had cast on their blanket fort had failed at some point in the night.
“Neville’s right,” Ron said.  “There’s things I've always wanted to ask some of you.”
“I love it.  Let’s see what else there is.”
He went to his makeshift closet and pulled on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt.  He really needed to go shopping and buy himself some clothes that actually fit him.  He was no longer in hiding, and shouldn’t still be wearing his cousin’s old clothes.  It helped that he had finally been able to convince the goblins at Gringott’s to let him have access to his vault, again.  It was nice to have such people as the Minister of Magic as a reference for you.
It took him a second to remember where he was.  It had been nearly three months since the end of the war, but the pure silence of 12 Grimmauld Place was taking quite a bit to get used to.  Going from Dudley’s snores on Privet Drive, Ron’s snores at the Burrow, Ron and Neville’s snores in the dorm, and then all of the noises of nature when they were in hiding, Harry didn’t know if he would ever get used to waking up to absolute quiet.  He relished being alone, but at times he missed human contact.
“So, you
“Come on, you two, let’s go skate,” Harry said with a chuckle.  Draco quickly did up his skates, and the three of them waddled toward the opening.
Draco moved so that he was again sitting on the edge of the bed.
“What time is it?” Harry asked, yawning and rubbing his eyes.  It was still dark in their room.  He reached for his glasses, and after sticking them on his nose, looked over at the clock on his side table.  He groaned as he saw that it was only 6:20am.
After that, they swiftly changed topics, and finished their tea.  Harry glanced down at his watch and saw that it was nearly 5:00, so he made their excuses and prepared to leave.
Draco moved his left hand up to grip Harry’s shoulder, trying to get closer.
“Indeed.”
Harry’s eyes wandered the room until he saw movement out of the corner of his eye, and upon turning, saw a young woman, a little older than him, come out from behind a black curtain on the back wall.
It didn’t take long, either.  Draco stood resolutely, arms crossed and feet spread apart, listening to Nott, whose face was turning redder and redder as he started yelling at Draco.  Harry could hear part of the conversation, as Nott was getting louder.  He heard Nott scream his name, followed by a string of profanity, and scooted toward the edge of the bench, preparing to step in between the two men.
He gripped Harry’s bicep as they continued down the little street.  They stepped into Ogden’s shop and purchased some alcohol for the party.  They went from shop to shop to shop, until finally, arms and pockets loaded with shrunken packages, they made their way back to the tree lot.
Also, it's not a huge thing, but I went back and tweaked a few things in the previous chapters, a bit.  I figured out one plot bunny that I want in here, so I had to rearrange a few things to be able to make it work and do it justice.  It doesn't have anything to do with this chapter, but you might want to go back and reread the last scene of the chapter 7; right before Harry finds Draco.  It will all make sense in the coming chapters.  (I'm not going to change the tags just yet, but once I get the chapters written and posted, there will also be new tags attached to the story, as well.)
“So, What are we going to do this evening?”
was incredible.”
Wait—off the ground?!
He felt Draco’s chuckle, which made him feel better.  “Now, let’s go back to sleep.  McGonagall said she would meet us at the front doors at 8:30.”
“Oh, god! Draco! Yes!”  Draco loved how vocal Harry was, and decided to see how loud he could make the man scream.  He again pulled back, and started trying to undo Harry’s belt.  Realizing what was happening, Harry started tugging on Draco’s, as well.  After a few seconds, he pulled back, knocking Draco’s hands away, and each man were quick to open their own.  Draco stood up, quickly divesting himself of his clothes, pants and all.
“Deal. We’d better go.” Draco turned to walk out of the room, but Harry grabbed his arm, pulling the blond towards him.
“What does she want?”
“Yeah, that would be great.  Two wands work much faster than just one.”
“He’s incredible.”  Draco sighed.  “I don’t know how you’ve done it, Potter, but you have changed me into a cuddly, baby-loving person!”  To prove his point, he pulled Harry toward him, wrapping an arm around Harry’s torso.
“The Wizengamot has decided that the three defendants, Messrs Philip Hinde, Onyx Chalks, and Miller Rooks, are hereby sentenced to 30 days in Azkaban and 5 years of probation, with a zero tolerance for any additional misconduct.  Case closed.”  He banged his gavel once more, and stood as Aurors came to put shackles on the men and escort them from the room.
wedding!”
Teddy took his hand and they started for the fireplace, but then he turned back and raced to give his nan a hug.  “Bye nana!  I love you!”
He shook his head, compelling the warmth that had risen in his chest to calm down; he had to convince Harry that he still wanted to be in a relationship before he could imagine things like that.
They went up and paid for it, and when the man asked them how they wanted to get the furniture, Draco shot Harry a look and proceeded to say “We’re going to pick it up.”  Harry didn’t know how that was going to be possible, but he just went along with it.  The man told them that there was a door on the side of the building, and that a man named Charles would be there to help them load it up.
Draco took it and carefully stepped into the tub, sighing as he slid down into the water.  Harry did the same on the other side of the tub.  “This was truly a brilliant idea.”  Draco just hummed in response and he sank a little deeper in the tub.
Draco did, and with a wave of Harry’s wand, the harness disappeared.  Harry took the baby from Draco’s arms.  “Are you ready for your nap?  Huh?”  At that moment, Teddy yawned.  “Thought so.  I’m going to go put him down.”
McGonagall’s face relaxed for a moment, but the pinched look returned just as fast.  “Unfortunately, I think it might.  When that man gives his testimony in front of the Wizengamot, he will mention your disappearing.  The majority of the people in the room will have been there in July, and know the aspects of your probation, so I’m afraid…”  She didn’t continue.
He led Harry over to a set of tables and chairs, sitting down.  Harry sat across from him, setting the food down.  He opened the containers to show Draco food from their favorite Italian restaurant just down the road from their home.
“Well? How do I look?” Draco asked, spinning around.
Harry laughed, as he went back to his closet and pulled out his favourite leather jacket.  He pulled on his coat before helping Draco into his.  They then clasped hands and walked down the stairs.  Harry released his hand to open the front door, let Draco out first, locked it behind them, and then immediately took it back into his once they reached the sidewalk, giving it a kiss.
He stood and took Draco’s hand, hauling him onto his feet, and they made their way up the steps to the sitting room.
“Promise.  Come on.”  He stuck out his hand, and Teddy gripped it tightly.  They gently stepped onto the ice, and Draco turned and took both of his hands, gently pulling him across the ice.
“Oh, Harry.”
“Yes, please,” he said as he followed her to the kitchen, greeting everyone he passed.  As they stepped into the room, he was greeted, as always, by Molly bustling around, preparing a feast for the masses.
Draco stuttered.  “Y-yeah?”
“Harry!  Hermione!  What are you two doing here?”  He bounded over, shaking Harry’s hand and giving Hermione a kiss, before ushering them into the back staff room, offering them a seat at a round table that had samples of some of what Harry guessed were new products.
Draco lifted and eyebrow in confusion.
“Hey, sorry, I had to use the loo.  Are you okay?”
Harry couldn’t seem to take his eyes off the man’s back.  Shaking himself, he moved his eyes away.  “I’m glad.  I think I might write a letter to Mr. Ollivander, though, and ask what all that could have meant.  He didn’t mention anything like that when we talked.”
They broke apart, both trying to fill their lungs with oxygen.  “I thought I was promised a bed,” Draco gasped, before biting onto Harry’s bottom lip.
~*~*~*~
Draco went slowly at first, sliding in inch by inch until he was flush up against Harry’s bollocks.  He paused a moment, and Harry could see his concentration so as not to blow his load so soon.
Draco and Harry turned to look at each other, only to realize that, yes they were dressed like each other; They were both wearing dark denims, and where Harry was wearing a grey button up shirt, matching Draco’s eyes, Draco was wearing an emerald button up shirt, matching Harry’s eyes.
Harry didn't know if Malfoy’s eyebrows could get any higher.
“Oh, so you are going back?  The last I had heard you still hadn’t made up your mind.”
“I suppose.  Mother won’t mind.  I’ll let her know when I take my things to the Manor.”
“Well, that settles that,” Hermione said with a nod.  The foursome started walking towards their common room together.  “So, Harry, when do Ron and I get to see all your hard work?”
Harry pumped his fingers in and out, and decided to just go for it: he pushed in and with his middle finger, went on the search for the…
Harry turned back around, staring at the rest of the 8
“No, we must!”  Draco jumped up, going over to the floo.
Teddy sighed as he looked between them.  “Are we really going to go ice skating?”
“Are you out of your mind?  A truce?!” Ron’s voice reached an all-time high, his face as red as Harry had ever seen it.
“Of course we will,” Hermione said with a sniffle and a nod.  Ron nodded his head
, come coursing out of me.  I’m sorry that I lashed out at you. I know that spell you threw was in self defence.  I also know you didn’t know what it did.  But what you don’t know is, at the time, I wished that you had succeeded in killing me.”
They were quiet as their ride came to a close, and they thanked the wizard again as they made their way back into the warmth of the lodge.
Harry felt his belly fill with warmth at the warning.  “Is that so?”
Harry sat next to him, and pulled the frame out of his hands, sitting it behind them. “Because, it’s proof of how far we’ve come. It shows that if we can go from this…” –he pointed back to the photo— “to this…” –he leaned forward and gave Draco a small kiss on his lips—“then anything is possible in this world.”
Harry saw red as another text came in.
“It just didn't look right.”
Draco looked confused for a moment before he said, “You mean you haven't seen the house since he has been working on it?”
Looking over at the clock, he realized he had only taken 45 minutes to get ready.  He still had nearly 5 hours to kill.  At that moment, though, his stomach decided to announce itself, so he went to get something to eat.
He smiled to himself as they walked over to the sofa, Harry still holding Teddy, who was now fascinated with the lion Harry was bouncing in front of his face.
Yet again, they were ripped out of their trance by Teddy.  They each took one of his hands, and the trio took off across the ice.
Harry shrugged, looking down at his lap. “I don’t know, I know that the one of you with Crabbe and Goyle can’t be a happy thought.”
He heard the floo flare up in the sitting room, and then he heard Draco call out for him.
Draco nodded, rubbing his thumb over Harry’s forehead creases.
Teddy pondered that for a moment, and then said, “Tell me about playing Quidditch together at Hogwarts.”
“Yeah, it is.”
He didn’t have a lot of experience in the sex department, but he had snogged a muggle bloke shortly after coming out to his friends.  He didn’t feel like he was ready for sex, so they didn’t go far, but he had an imagination, and that was good enough for now.
“He’s running late.”
Draco could hear Harry’s quiet cackling over his furious whispering as the hospital wing door opened and then swung shut.
“What are you on about?  We’ve been together for three years!  This won’t be our first!”
Unraveling the piece of wood from the silk again, Harry held it up.
“McGonagall said that the man told the Aurors that my pocket seemed to glow white, a bright light formed, and then I suddenly disappeared.
Suddenly, a brilliant idea occurred to him.
Harry did a quick glance around the room and then gently leaned in and gave Draco a soft kiss on the lips, before turning towards the back of the wing.
Harry had always loved the way the Weasley’s tree was covered in bright colours and things that the kids had done when they were younger, and so he had bought the brightest ornaments he could find.  He had gotten both muggle and magical ornaments, too.  He stood back and admired the tree, stepping forward to say hello to the fairies that flitted around it.
“I’ve heard about that.  My sister has always been stubborn, but I’m almost positive the two of you can out-stubborn anyone, including one Narcissa Malfoy.”
“Well, Teddy Bear, think we can handle one night?  Huh?”  Harry kissed his godson’s head as the baby started grabbing for Harry’s glasses and hair, babbling.
Now even more nervous, Harry continued following Draco to the opening.  A man was standing there, with all of the furniture, in the opening.  He inquired about a vehicle that he could put the furniture in, to which Harry could see Draco shake his arm to release his wand.  Before he could stop him, Draco had whispered a quick “Confundus” and the man had shaken his head, turned, and walked back inside.  Harry gave Draco a disgruntled look, but before he could even voice his displeasure, Draco had again waved his wand and shrunk all the furniture, putting it in his pocket.
“I think that went well, don’t you?”
“I’m not, Gran.  Harry just gave me a present to open while we were waiting.”
Draco cleared his throat and said, “Just talking about how much we’ll miss him when he goes off to Hogwarts.”
“When was this?”
“I…I don’t know what to tell you.  Er, I mean, I’m not sure you really want to know.”
Draco couldn’t read Harry’s face as they looked at each other, but his heart leapt when Harry turned his head and said, “He is here as my guest.”
Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist.  “This,” he said.
Seeing the questioning look on the blond’s face, Harry carried on.  “I spoke with Mr. Ollivander a couple of months ago, requesting information on how to properly restore your wand to you.  If you were to take it forcefully, then you would have power over my wand, too.”  Harry was quick to continue.  “Not that I don’t trust you!  It’s not even my wand I’m worried about.”
Stepping into the room, Harry saw everything exactly how he had left it nearly two weeks before.  All of the cabinets had been taken down, and they had removed the counters and sinks.  The room looked like a shell of what it used to be.  Harry was eager about implementing the plans that he and Draco had come up with a few weeks before.
“I won’t be able to come by tomorrow.  I’m supposed to have lunch with Pansy, and I need to spend some time with my mother.”
Eating their lunch, they talked about what other shopping they needed to accomplish while they had the chance.  8
, and then basically told Harry he was falling in love with him.  He couldn’t believe it.
“His first comment was to remind me that I was to marry and provide an heir so that the Malfoy name would not die with me.  He next informed me that he could arrange an open marriage, so that I could still keep ‘another on the side.’”  He sneered as he used air quotes.  “Then, he went on to say that while he did not approve of my lifestyle, he did want to congratulate me on getting on your good side, as being seen with you would help bring back the Malfoy name into good standing with the public.”  Draco glared at the floor as he spoke.
“Spoiled sod,” Harry half mumbled to himself as he leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s.
“Yessssss!”
Harry barely breathed until he heard the floo flare up.  He seemingly melted, sitting down on the top step.  Pulling his knees up, he slowly ran his fingers through his hair.
“Yeah, you are,” Harry agreed, staring at the snakes. They weren’t illusions, but neither were they real creatures. They were conjured ones who had appeared because James wanted to hover the pillow, he was pretty sure. But he needed to ask. “James, how are you doing it?”
“All right.” Harry sat cross-legged on the floor and pulled James into his arms, ignoring the uncomfortable coolness of the tile against his arse. Sela slithered up to his shoulder, but she wasn’t saying anything, so Harry felt free to speak with Jamie. “That’s not a problem. I just need you to tell me what happened.”
Besides, it was pretty convenient to have a private way of speaking to his son that not many people could understand.
He hadn’t danced since his divorce.
instead of—” Astoria looked off to the side. “Instead of staying here and being quiet.”
Scorpius added.
Potter radiated silent misery while trying not to radiate it, and Draco had seen too many Parselmouths like that in the past few years not to respond to it. “What can I do?”
Draco thrust the thought away as the current turned into a waterfall for a moment and Pansy gave him a sharp glance. He knew better than this. He knew that Potter wasn’t important right now. James was.
Astoria turned away and paced over to the window of the study to stare out of it. Draco didn’t know what she could see—green grass, white peacocks, blossoming trees—that was more fascinating than their argument, and wished she would turn around. But Astoria grew more stubborn when told to do something, so he stayed silent.
They continued walking down the alley side-by-side, which somewhat surprised Harry. He’d have thought Malfoy would leave in disgust or high dudgeon, but other than a few annoyed blinks, he seemed to take what Harry had said in stride.
“Thank you, Clarissa. You’ve been enormously helpful.”
“We’ll do that, of course,” Draco tried to soothe Astoria, although he retained some private doubt about whether teaching their son that
“Don’t worry about me. It’s nothing but the kind of attention I’ve been dealing with for years, from practically anyone but the Weasleys and Hermione anyway. I’d do much worse than this in protection of my son.”
Draco didn’t know what was worse, the idea that offers had been so rare that Potter hadn’t recognized them, or that all it took was something so small to change Potter’s mind.
Snakes could yearn for the companionship of humans. He was sure of that, after seeing Malfoy’s circle. What was wrong was that she was yearning for
Harry saw how pale his son was, and lost all interest in debating with his former colleagues. “With your permission, Auror Brooks,” he said, his voice going clipped as he turned back to them, “I need to take my son away from this place now.”

Harry could
. I had to let Death Eaters into the school and try to assassinate Dumbledore under pressure that he would otherwise kill my family. I had to—”
“Git,” Ron said at once, scowling.
“It’s not easy,” he finally managed to say. “I’m adjusting. Malfoy wants me to practice ritual magic with him, and I don’t want to.”
“Yes. I don’t think he would ever harm him.”
And Draco Malfoy, who did have some political power if he’d managed to keep his school open, was watching.
Harry held up his hand and swallowed, and Malfoy fell silent, watching him narrowly. He had pulled his arm back to his side, but from the way it was crooked, he obviously expected to reach out and accept Sela’s weight any moment.
He hadn’t remembered the exact weeks or days, only the months, but in the end, that didn’t matter, because the
Brooks looked as if he wanted to bite through something. “You are
“Oh, Mr. Malfoy! You startled me.”
“Are you sure that’s wise?” Draco asked softly.
For now, he had no need to look outside it.
He was, Draco agreed to himself. And he supposed the reasons
Draco thought, and opened his eyes as the first call boomed out of him, to see how Potter was taking this.
“Try convincing the people who were willing to believe I was the Heir of Slytherin and a cheater in the Tri-Wizard Tournament and an insane liar of that.”
Harry took a deep breath, ruffled his son’s hair, and went back to the table to stare at the letter. There were several lines about how the Parselmouth School would help Parselmouth children because they instinctively performed magic in a different way than ordinary accidental outbursts.
attained power.”
evil, and anyway, I’m a celebrity. The unhinged famous person persecuting the poor helpless little man who only did it because his children were
James pouted and sighed, but Malfoy obviously wasn’t going to be moved. He looked down at the snake in his hands. “
!” he chirped in Parseltongue.
Malfoy blinked, and then seemed to be fighting back his own irritation. “Haven’t I proven that I’m nothing like
“Nothing’s wrong. I said so.”
“And that just proves that you’re more of an idiot, that you use that kind of cliched dialogue.” Parkinson stalked a step forwards, and abruptly her krait was visible around her throat. It had probably been under a specialized Disillusionment Charm before, Harry thought, and noticed the way the man paled when he saw the snake. “
“Edwina told me not long after we first met that you smelled of pain,” Draco said. “I’m sure your Sela has said the same thing. Is there anything I can do to ease that pain? I thought maybe giving James access to Parselmouth classes would help, but it doesn’t seem to have.”
,” the krait agreed, and raised her head to focus on the man, hissing loudly. They were drawing a crowd, and Harry glared at Parkinson, wondering what in the world she was thinking. This would hardly help better the reputation of Parselmouths, the way Malfoy was always harping about them needing to do.
But Draco, with the curiosity that had driven him deep into Parseltongue and its mysteries, found that he did want to know. And, well, he had uncovered more than anyone else in the last hundred years. Who was to say that he couldn’t learn Potter’s secrets, too, even if Potter tried to keep them buried?
Sela had coiled herself around his arm and settled her head into the crook of his elbow. Harry sighed and rolled over to face her. Having her here was—more pleasant than he’d expected. She didn’t makes any threats to bite, except for those people in Diagon Alley that first day, and she wasn’t making demands for him to practice ritual magic, either. He touched her head, between her eyes.
” Sela said sulkily. She was draped along his shoulders instead of encircling his neck as she usually did, and refused to lift her head when she spoke to him. Instead, she sprawled long and low, and might have looked like the edge of a shawl from a distance.
Draco blinked and inclined his head. Sela had her tongue darting in and out in agitation, and Draco wondered if she knew it was generally considered bad manners among Parselmouths, at least from what Draco had learned as he began to establish his own schooling system, for a snake to introduce herself. A Parselmouth should do that.
“But you had already called your Match. This isn’t the same as working with someone untrained, who can unbalance everything!”
“It would be—”
Harry let it wash over him. “This, what?”
Potter closed his eyes and took a long, slow breath. Draco blinked, and finally said, “My name is Draco Malfoy. This is my son, Scorpius.” He patted Scorpius’s shoulder, and Scorpius stood upright.
“This is what I have to do for James,” Harry said absently as he eyed the small dots that had appeared at the end of the white stone path leading to the school. Those would be reporters, probably, or maybe people who had heard about this and come as spectators. “I wouldn’t expect you to understand.”
, and not the very obvious fact that Draco thought he was frustrating.
they had going on. It was the best place for James, he would definitely agree on that, but it would never be the right place for him.
?” Just because he was James’s teacher didn’t mean that Malfoy would do any favors in particular for Harry. He had several other students, too.
He had to believe that.
Unlike everything else. The snake was offering to take the place of his Mind-Healer? That was so broken that Harry didn’t know what to say.
Despite her obvious desire to linger, in the end, Clarissa had to sigh and retreat. Draco ignored the way that she was obviously attempting to draw his attention to her bum, and focused on the shelves in front of him.
Draco glanced in the direction of Moonborn and Potter. Potter met his gaze, all the hatred and rage he had shown already concealed behind the opaque surface of his face again. He nodded, as though in response to Draco’s silent question, and then turned away and cast a familiar stag Patronus.
Potter nodded. His magic was quiet and buried so deeply inside him that Draco couldn’t feel it. Draco tried not to frown as he faced the black wall of the ritual room that was the closest to the sunlight outside. He still didn’t know what to make of this strange Potter, who was like a cross between the boy he had known at Hogwarts—
Astoria’s shoulders slumped for a moment, which made Draco wonder what she had hoped he would say. That it wasn’t potential? That neither he nor Scorpius had any interest in Parseltongue? Well, that would simply be wrong. Scorpius had been babbling in Parseltongue from the time he was nine months old, and it had been one of the best days of Draco’s life when he realized he could understand snakes.
Draco did his best to drive all his tension down into his body, because right now it was affecting Edwina and she had begun to hiss in agitation. “
Malfoy fumbled for a second, then caught it. The yellow glow around his cobra faded. James stopped screaming, and something in Harry that had wanted to kill people until his son was all right relaxed.
The ritual ended with Malfoy softly chanting phrases that made the ripples fade and disappear, and the black snake on the floor went back to looking as if it was made of stone. Harry let the magic go with a relieved sigh. Carrying it around had been like carrying boulders with knives on the bottom that were planted in his shoulders.
a surprise to Harry that Parkinson had been Marked. Maybe it had happened near the end of the war.
“I understand now why you want nothing to do with your Parseltongue.” Malfoy was scrutinizing him in a way that reminded Harry absurdly of Hermione. “And I wanted to let you know that if you became part of my Order, I would never betray your secrets like that.”
Draco didn’t like to admit it, but he supposed, in a way, that everyone involved was lucky Potter had sought training for his son at all, instead of trying to suppress James’s Parseltongue.
” James said, from where he was stroking Charlie’s back. Charlie had rolled upside-down with what Draco privately thought of as his idiot expression on his face. “
Draco flattened his mouth into a straight line and said nothing. Astoria folded her arms.
“Potter,” Draco said quietly, drawing Potter’s attention as he knew he wouldn’t have with a snap or command. “Will you please tell me what’s wrong?”
Harry shut his eyes. He shook his head. “
,” Ron said, and retreated backwards up the stairs, keeping a firm eye on Harry, as if he expected him to explode. The news about Ginny, Harry supposed.
Draco nodded, still watching Potter, who hadn’t opened his eyes. “
Potter just gave Draco a blank look and then turned and scanned the playroom. “Where is James?”
?” She had a slight tone of pride in her voice when she said those words. Harry knew that James and Sapphire had worked hard the other day to explain the concept of apology to her.
Harry thought she might leave once she understood that she wouldn’t get anything but clipped responses out of him, but instead, her smile tilted towards amused. “I just wanted you to know. Especially since your basket can be stolen, hovering behind you like that, and you wouldn’t know until long after it was gone. Whereas the snake basket won’t be stolen because—”
Draco blinked and started to ask the obvious question, but then held it back. It wasn’t as though it would ever reach Weasley, after all, who was the one who really needed to hear it. “
He hadn’t meant to use that kind of magic on Moonborn in the middle of Diagon Alley. In front of his son. In front of Malfoy, who thought he belonged around children other than James, for some reason.
“I told you why!”
Harry supposed they did. Malfoy would want reassurances that Harry had a good reason to use that particular spell in front of Scorpius. “All right,” he answered, and wrapped James in his arms, and stood, ignoring the Aurors still watching them.
” Malfoy gave him a harsh smile. “
Harry raised a hand to touch Sela’s back. He didn’t entirely trust her yet, but at least he might make her quiet down. And it seemed to work. She said nothing further, only darted her tongue out again to touch his hand.
“Really? Huh. I thought he’d settled down with that French witch a while ago.”
“The girl came over to James. She told him that he was supposed to be a hero, because of his last name. And that he shouldn’t be talking to snakes. That might have been a factor in her mother’s decision not to enroll her at the school.”
“Potter is here only to provide the familial support for his son, who is still young enough to be overwhelmed.” Malfoy shook his head when Parkinson opened her mouth again. “You remember, Pansy, that I was only the support when we called Charlie for Scorpius.”
Draco had meant the question to be a casual one, or as casual as it could be when he was intensely interested in the answer, but Potter tensed and flickered his eyes towards him. Draco forced himself to stand still, loose-limbed and waiting, and after a long moment, Potter nodded at him and glanced aside.
“What did you have in mind for the first step?” he asked.
more open than he wanted to be with Malfoy. What he’d done during the ritual to find Sapphire was one thing, because that had been to protect James, but he couldn’t see helping Malfoy become more powerful.
written some of the articles that were closest to the facts about the revelations from that bloody Mind-Healer. “Yes. Did you know that there are over three dozen Parselmouths just in Britain alone now?”
James sighed, and a few minutes later was drooping in his arms despite how hungry he’d said he was just a little while ago. Harry put him to bed, and stroked his head again as James yawned and snuggled under the covers. That was a prime sign of how tired he was, and how much he must have been carrying the burden of his fear and shame clutched tightly to himself.
“He needs to know things about his Parseltongue, things I can’t teach him. And right now, he doesn’t have a lot of other friends like his cousins because of the continual delicate dance we have to do around the Burrow to make sure that we’re not there when Ginny is.”
Draco didn’t need to say anything to that. He was sure his face expressed the force of his skepticism. Potter glanced to the side and moved his fingers for a second as if he was clutching an invisible wand.
Harry reached without even thinking about it, seizing the flow of the magic and bending it to his will. It smashed against him and tried to flood his nerves with pain. Harry laughed at it with the silent scorn of someone who had faced the Cruciatus from Voldemort himself, and bore down on it.
Malfoy hissed in Parseltongue, “
” He glanced at Potter, who was staring out the window with his jaw clenched hard enough that Draco winced to think of what he was doing to his teeth.
Edwina twisted on Draco’s neck and stuck her head out of his shirt to hiss at Potter, “
Harry made a mental note to himself. It might mean James would need some extra training before he went to Hogwarts. He wondered if he should ask Minerva McGonagall about that. Harry couldn’t say that he had that expertise in Transfiguration, either.
Harry shrugged. “Believe what you like.”
opposite of what I want.”
In seconds, he saw the way it should go. It had been pouring in a smooth circle, with Malfoy as the beginning and end of the ring. Harry caught his eyes, which were blown wide with what might be pain or surprise, and tossed the cord of magic to him.
“Don’t kill her!” Draco called. “We need to know what she was doing.”
“Oh?” Harry blinked at his best mate. He wouldn’t have thought that Ron knew much about ritual magic.
, and should value the power and companionship it held out for himself. But if Draco could only reach him through concern for his son, he would take it.
“It’s all right,” Harry said in English, and ignored the cool way Parkinson’s eyes rested on him as he turned to Malfoy. “So what do we need to do?”
native language now that he knew he could do so. “Not when I know you have venom. Go find someone else.”
Power like water poured past him, and he found himself tensing his shoulders and shaking his head against it, without meaning to. The flows alternated between blue and black, water in the daytime and water at night, and there was a soft voice that flowed along with them, speaking words now in Parseltongue, now in English, seducing his attention.
As Temperance stood there blinking and didn’t say anything else, Julian Keller from
Sela was already unwinding from Parkinson’s arm and climbing Harry’s. He resolutely ignored the slightly tickling feeling of her scales. “
“I believe you, Jamie.”
“Have you considered that sooner or later, your attitude
Potter hated himself didn’t matter that much. He would pay the money, and his son would receive the education that he needed, and Draco’s Order of Serpents would be more accepted in the future because of his association with the “Savior” and his son.
Harry shrugged. “It didn’t sound that way. If only because you couldn’t be sure I’d do either of those things. And I still don’t really want to practice ritual magic with the rest of you.”
“You want to be politically active, Draco,” Astoria said, and turned around to face him with her hands shaking. “That’s the
Harry shrugged a little. “
“What?”
“He had, but then they broke up when she wanted him to move to France, and Ginny met him when he went to a Holyhead Harpies game.”
“Of course not. That’s the least he deserves for what he said about you.”
Then again, he wasn’t old enough to hear about why his mother had wanted to leave, anyway. Harry kissed James on the forehead, and then tickled him a little until James was giggling and yawning.
Harry nodded to him. Keller was no more trustworthy than the others, but he
“I care! I want every Parselmouth to be—”
“Potter?” Parkinson asked at the same time, eyes narrowed in the way she seemed to have of pretending she didn’t care. “Are you going to be all right?”
ritual magic, if there’s such a thing, I don’t know about Parseltongue—” Ron waved his hand through the air. “You’re open to each other. You can control each other’s magic if you need to, if something gets out of control. It’s like your whole body is your wand, and their body is their wand, and you can wield each other.”
“You’re right. That would be over more quickly.”
Potter shrugged. “I can’t do that if people are applying the rumors about me to James. He is
Harry stared at her in turn. Sela stretched up to meet his eyes, although Harry suspected she got more information about him from her darting tongue.
And then Harry forced himself to snap out of his thoughts, and pay attention to his son, who was more important than he was.
He had been asking for her last name, but Draco preserved his smile, and simply nodded. “Of course. Well, Clarissa—” she giggled “—I’m here to see about some of the old editions of the
James was
“What you think I’m doing, I suppose.”
And Harry had spun around and said the unforgivable thing, the thing that made him wince remembering it, and the thing that someday, he would have to explain to James. (It flayed him alive, remembering it at night).
Harry knew the mood would pass. He knew he would get up in the morning and attempt to do the best he could for James. He knew that his and Ginny’s marriage probably wouldn’t have lasted given what had happened, and he knew that quitting his Auror job to be a father to James—to
“Not you.
Dark Arts, man?” Auror Brooks finally snapped, gesturing at the place Moonborn had been. There were still a few dark flakes of what had been her arm wisping around the street, but other Aurors with better sense than these two had removed her to a holding cell in the Ministry. “You

,” Sela announced. “
“I won’t,” Harry began, but the man just bellowed on.
Harry tried to get in the way of the spell, but it wasn’t a spell after all. It was simply a command, in Parseltongue, to the snakes to bite.
“No. Next question.”
the one with the right to make decisions about my son,” he said. “Since Ginny’s—not here.” He’d wanted to say “gave up all responsibility,” but that wouldn’t be fair.
“I don’t need it.”
“Harry Potter, I think you know Gregory Goyle and Pansy Parkinson.”
,” Sela announced. “
to have a happy life.”
Draco studied him, and decided, reluctantly, that that was probably true. He could wish Potter would do things for other reasons, but for right now, that his defense of his son would be sturdy was for the best. Draco didn’t have to worry about defending Jamie. Instead, he would concentrate on his son, the school, and the other students.
Harry didn’t acknowledge that Sela had spoken, other than shifting his shoulder a little when she tried to crawl down his arm and towards the Aurors his Patronus had summoned. Her Parseltongue would probably sound like ordinary hissing to them, and as long as she didn’t attack them, everything would be fine.
“Are you all right, Potter? You look like you’re going to be sick.”
opened a book or two since Hogwarts.”
The years had hardened Potter in a way Draco hadn’t anticipated. He moved with his head up, his hand curled at his side, making no pretense that he wouldn’t go for his wand the instant someone presented a threat to his son. There was a new scar on the side of his face, a ripping red line that ran from the corner of his left eye to his jaw, but Draco had thought it would make him seem more vulnerable. It only made Potter look as if he had survived something that had tried to rip his face off, and that nothing else would faze him, either.
“It simply gets them more attuned to feeling their ritual magic. It isn’t as potent a shape as the circle.” Draco motioned with his head, and Potter reluctantly followed him back towards the other side of the classroom, a large room with grey walls and a blue floor. The combination of colors, like the pentagram, was one that got young Parselmouths used to feeling the flow of their magic. “What’s wrong?”
Harry blinked. “Interfered. Sorry. I didn’t think the ritual would succeed without it.”
That made Brooks pause. He had probably thought Harry would go along with whatever they wanted to do in the interests of not getting bad publicity in the papers, and that meant they could bully him into coming back to the Ministry. But now he was on the spot and had to make a decision.
” Draco cast a glance at his son, who sat next to the huge terrarium where their snakes slept. “
?” Draco snapped. “
“Daddy, look.” James pointed a shaky hand at the far wall. Harry turned, his mind filling with visions of enemies breaking into his house to hurt his son.
people were good was a good idea. “But I also want to practice the ritual magic and let Scorpius explore the fullest potential of his gift.”
Harry shook his head. “
Draco hesitated, then sighed. He still thought Potter was an idiot for rejecting a gift as mighty as this one, but it was true that they’d accomplish nothing with him resisting every step of the way. “
“Someone might overhear us. You might think you could explain to other people about it, and hint around the subject, and one of them might guess.”
“Near the end of the war, he was Marking people it never would have occurred to him to do it with before.” Malfoy shook his head. “He was desperate, and he wanted to intimidate some people and bond others to him through his
Harry shrugged, cast a Netting Charm that he usually used on some of the pixies and fairies who tried to get into the house since it resonated with James’s magic, and carried the snake in the transparent bag that had surrounded her to the window. She hissed at him in agitation, but Harry forced himself to essentially unfocus his hearing and not listen, the way he might prevent himself from reading a book. He’d learned to do it when he was trying to make sure James learned English, too.
She picked up the packed trunk and walked towards the Floo. “Expect the divorce papers in the morning,” she added over her shoulder.
Sapphire floated in the watery tank next to Jamie’s bed. Harry hesitated, glancing at him, and then spoke to his son’s snake directly, one of the few times he’d done so. “
Potter stared off into the distance. “Doesn’t it matter that I won’t be a good Parselmouth?” he whispered. “I can’t give that snake what she wants. I can’t give James what he’ll need, apparently. Isn’t there another way that he can learn from you? That he can call the snake?”
“But why would you do something so
It could have been worse, Harry reflected. In fact, everything could have been a great deal worse, if the ritual going wrong had affected the calling of James’s snake. At least this way, if something was off, Harry couldn’t tell what it was, and he didn’t think Malfoy and the rest would have been so contented if something was.
James folded his arms and stomped one foot. “
“I did think you wanted to lie low and not attract that sort of attention,” he had to say.
The wizard began to scream, and it was a distinctively female voice. The hood still hid her face, and Draco had no idea who she was, but he felt a little better knowing her gender. He would have stepped forwards to support Potter, but the shield that still held him held him back, too, and he couldn’t move.
fall into their ranks.
“That I allowed myself to notice,” Harry said quietly, and stood up. “See you later, Malfoy.”
“For James?”
” Malfoy continued, his voice curling and seeming to ride the circle of power that went flowing past Harry rather than echoing from his mouth. “
“Annabelle Selwyn, yes. She didn’t stay long. Ultimately she decided that this wasn’t the right school for her.” Draco restrained his sneer. It wasn’t as though she would be able to find another school for her daughter to learn the magic she’d inherited from her Marked father.
Now, Draco watched Harry Potter and his son walk towards him across the patterned floor of the great ballroom, and wondered that he had managed to come this far. Astoria would either have laughed or outright refused to believe it.
“Oh, really? When it’s simply a curse to increase your virtue?” Parkinson smiled at him and twitched her fingers, a cue that the snake apparently picked up. Isabella wove her neck into a complicated knot, which Harry realized, abruptly, resembled a rune. Parkinson touched it with her left hand and flung her right hand at Harry’s interrogator.
in Voldemort’s resurrection ritual, I spent a year with the Ministry trying to crush me and carving words into my hand with a Blood Quill, I spent another year hunting down ways to destroy Voldemort and in the end walked to my
“I’d like to help you move forwards.”
,” Potter was saying to Sela. “
Potter snarled, a sound that made Draco feel for a moment as if he understood what other people felt when they heard Parseltongue, and struck to maim.
“Think of calling your snake, James,” Draco whispered. He was the one who would perform that part of the ritual, in truth, but he wanted James to feel involved. And his desire for a snake would shape which kind responded. “You can do it.”
them. There was no other word for it. He had seen their outstretched hands and slapped them away.
And the obsession with finding out grew just a bit deeper.
Draco bit back his amusement, and reached outwards with the flowing force of the magic shifting in a watery circle from him to Edwina to Isabella to Pansy to Greg to Bael to Charlie to Scorpius to James and back again. He felt a mind speak in answer.
Harry stirred. “It’s not like I would have wished this for him,” he said, and although he kept his voice quiet, no one could have mistaken the fury in it—least of all Ginny, who knew him so well. She flung herself around to face him. “And it’s not like he’ll be unique. There’ll be lots of kids with Parseltongue now, Gin. Can’t you just—”
But Malfoy said, “Do you know what you
“All right,” Draco said. “That is, of course, your decision. I will say that I have seen ritual magic help other Parselmouths sleep better and release some of the tension that boils up in them on a regular basis. But there are other ways to do that, and probably talking to your friends is one of them.”
“Where is your son?” That was Thomasina Temperance, the reporter for
What did, except pushing forwards and loving his son?
“I chose not to.”
,” Sela hissed, lifting her head to stare at the side of Potter’s face, as if she thought she could will him to face her. “
“No.” Harry let his mouth thin out in a smile. “They had more than we did for a long time, since they didn’t have the legacy of conflict with Parselmouths that Britain did, which made Parseltongue so feared. But we have the most now.”
“You’re my son’s teacher.”
Potter spun fully around to face him then, the tension uncoiling and spilling all at once, and the children fell silent in their play and their half-Parseltongue, half-English chatter. Potter sensed that and curbed the things he would have said (which made Draco blink in regret). Instead, he stepped nearer and lowered his voice.
“It hurt, but I managed—”
Potter had gone to a Mind-Healer called Leroy Bandler after, apparently, some kind of traumatic incident had happened to him on an Auror mission. Bandler had listened to Potter for three months, then sold the secrets Potter had told him to the papers. Bandler’s excuse, as listed in one article that included a photograph of him standing with his arms around his wife and children, was that his children were starving and he needed the money, and he believed Potter “a danger to our society.”

“I came here because someone wanted to meet you.”
because my mind and soul were
Harry glanced up and found Parkinson facing him, heedless of the gaping observers still passing them. Her hands had taken both of his, and she was staring into his face with a direct, human stare he hadn’t known she was capable of. He tried, embarrassed, to take his hands away, but she held on to them. Isabella had disappeared behind what was probably another Disillusionment Charm.
She cut herself off as Malfoy and his son came down the stairs. They were both carrying their snakes, and Harry looked a little off to the side to conceal his own negative reaction. That was when he caught sight of the small krait coiled around Parkinson’s neck and the large python crawling along to catch up to Goyle.
Harry opened his eyes and nodded. He had to be. Parkinson was right about something: he would grow more distant from James if he neglected his Parseltongue.
flooded Harry that it was like trying to breathe fire. He clutched James close and waited, rubbing a hand up and down his back the way he had when James had needed help burping.
James sounded as if he was about to cry again. Harry turned from the window and went to sit down next to his son, holding him close and stroking his hair back from his forehead. Sometimes he would just sit there and look at his son, so different from him despite how messy his hair was. No scar, no green eyes, no black hair, no haunted, terrified expression.
“But the ability to bond with your son.”
When they reached a section of the Archives that did smell like newsprint, Clarissa turned to face him and gave him a brilliant smile, twirling a curl of ginger hair around one finger. Too bad she didn’t know that ginger hair did nothing for Draco. “Now, to find a certain edition of the paper, you just say the date and swing your wand like this—” she traced a P-shape in the air “—and it’ll come to you. To return it to its place, recite date backwards, and trace this.” She made an R-shape with her wand this time.
But for now, Draco closed his eyes and let his magic pour out of him, deep and cool enough to encompass the others like a pool of water. Pansy and Greg responded with tight points of light in return. Greg’s constrictor, Bael, hissed softly along, and Pansy’s Isabella dropped down, sharp and shrill, from the top of the height, magic puddling between them to join Draco’s.
That had been the same year that details started out to come out about those who had been branded by the Dark Lord developing as Parselmouths, so outrage over that part of the story had died down fairly quickly. There were simply too many purebloods with money and good positions in society speaking Parseltongue for the prejudice to endure.
Malfoy’s shoulders tightened, but he kept meeting Harry’s eyes. “I mean, I’d like to help you become more comfortable with your Parseltongue and your Match.”
He wished he could change them. But he didn’t see how.
.” Potter whirled around and paced in a circle, coming back to him with one hand raised. Draco instinctively moved a step away, then realized Potter had done it to keep Sela in place on his shoulder, rather than fend Draco off. “They can hammer on me all they want. They can hate me all they want. But they’re not going after James.”
She sounded somewhere between angry and hurt, herself. Harry blew air out between his lips and sat up. Sela came with him, but stayed where she was, even though it was a more awkward position now and made Harry have to juggle her on his arm. Sela just gave a sulky little hiss and didn’t move.
Sela hissed a meaningless sound, but then turned her head, flicking her tongue, as the door of the school opened behind Harry. All of Harry’s muscles tensed, but it was Malfoy who came out and stood beside him, not James, as he had been afraid of.
have to be exactly the same, and that’s what I‘ll tell him if he asks me.”
Scorpius looked a little startled, but he trotted off to do that. James was so involved in watching Sapphire and asking him questions that he didn’t appear to have noticed. Sapphire answered in a soft voice that made Harry obscurely glad James didn’t appear to have attracted an arrogant snake.
” she said softly. “
And Harry was determined to keep it that way, which was why he was so reluctant to tell James about the unforgivable thing.
clear that his presence was necessary but only barely tolerated here. These were practicing Parselmouths who wanted to spend their lives immersed in snake magic. He wanted James to be one of them, but Harry never would be. It was only sense that he shut up and let them get on with it.
Harry rolled out of bed in instants. It had been two years since he was a full-time Auror, but he still had the reflexes. He sprinted down the corridor, aiming his wand in front of him and calling up
Parkinson shook her head a little. “The difference between me and them is that I can admit I fucked up,” she said, and ignored the glare she got from a witch walking by with two young children. “And that I’m fighting to make a world that’s different from what we grew up with, not just settling back and trusting that it’ll change on its own.”
“Clarissa.”
“There was something else I was hoping to speak to you about,” Malfoy said then. “Something that I believe you could do to benefit the school.”
Harry paused. Parkinson gave him a superior look that he tried to ignore. Sela continued reaching for him, twining along Parkinson’s arm to the furthest reach of her hand and leaning out. Harry tried to ignore the imploring way she looked at him. Snakes didn’t
“Buying supplies for the school?” Harry asked as he slowed down to match Malfoy’s pace. James and Scorpius were already lagging behind, chattering away to each other in Parseltongue. Harry maneuvered to get the boys in front of him, and wanted to snort when he realized that Malfoy was doing the same thing at the same time, like a coordinated dance partner.
when I was eleven, is that it?”
Draco stepped closer to Potter and stared at him, disturbed by how blank he was—how blank he
Malfoy stroked the cobra’s back, once, a light touch of two fingers as if he did it every day. “
“Potter?” he asked, because Potter had a look of both hatred and recognition on his face. “Who is she?”
“They say those things about you
Harry put a hand on James’s shoulder and just let it rest there. James bit his lip and glanced up at him. “
“She’s
“I’ll find someone else for Sela if you want me to,” Draco said calmly, and tried to avoid sounding like he was speaking to one of the children. Potter’s wide eyes had already narrowed in suspicion. He would strike out if he thought Draco was being condescending, or probably just refuse to listen. “I would prefer not to, of course. She’s established a bond with you, and that means there’s something in you that she finds valuable—”
“I think I have a good idea,” Potter said softly, and then flipped the hood back from the woman’s head with a push of his wand tip. Draco stared at the face that was revealed. She looked shaggy and old. He didn’t know he’d had any enemies that looked like that.
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Seamus.”
Potter narrowed his eyes and cast again. This time, the spell hit the woman’s shoulder, and pierced through cloth and flesh alike. Draco watched as the skin and muscle rotted and fell away, and revealed slick muscle beneath.
Harry clenched the side of the doorway a moment, before walking back to pick her up. “
Potter gave him the strangest look, then seemed to realize that Draco wasn’t going to waste Legilimency on him and ground his teeth. “
Draco would have liked to turn him upside-down and rattle him back and forth until what was inside dropped out. But that was both impossible and frowned on by people Draco wanted to be allied to in the future, so speaking to Potter this way it was.
Harry took a deep breath. “He is.”
” Sela’s tail vibrated like a rattlesnake’s for a moment. “
“I’m no longer an Auror, Brooks. And ordinary citizens don’t have to follow that.”
The young Auror blinked and looked at Brooks, but Brooks was concentrating on Harry. “We’re here to judge you, not someone hypothetical,” he snapped. “You could have brought her down with a milder spell.”
It still made him wince when he thought of his and Ginny’s last conversation.
Ginny screamed as the fangs stabbed into her, and Harry could see her convulsing under the weight of all those bodies, as much as she could. He imagined the venom heating the blood in her veins, tearing apart her muscles, making her limbs swell up—
” Sela retorted. Her tail coiled out and around his wrist, squeezing hard enough to make Harry scowl at her. She let go of his wrist, but not his gaze. “
“I don’t know about that.”
“What?” Potter stared at him.
“Fine, then. Go off and hug your precious trauma instead of your child.”
“So tomorrow,” Harry said aloud, even though James was occupied with his pillow and wouldn’t understand him even if he was, “we have to go talk to that git Malfoy.”
?” The snake flicked her neck to the left this time, and revealed that the blood-bright stripes ran all the way across her scales and ended up in a messy knot of color on the back of her head—which at least didn’t have a hood the way a cobra’s did, Harry saw. “
Harry relaxed. He was glad to have found such support from his best friends, that James could have that kind of circle around him.
restrain his temper.
Maybe her wanting to help him with Parseltongue wasn’t just because she was determined to have a Speaker of her own and participate in ritual circles. And helping him with nightmares and pain…
Harry just nodded. By now, he had given up on hoping that a non-dangerous snake would choose James. Although it would have been nice to have a little grass snake or something like that.
He took a step forwards, reaching out. “Ginny, I’m sorry—I didn’t mean—”
Harry thought of how to phrase it, turning it around in his head, and finally said, “They have a right to say it.”
Hermione winced. “You know that Molly wouldn’t—”
saying that, Parkinson.”
“You talk to it, Daddy.”
Draco blinked back at him, then snorted. Of course Potter would be concerned about something like
“I askded for help, and they came and didded it!” James said. He still had trouble with English words sometimes. He waved his hand around. “
Malfoy nodded. His voice when he spoke next sounded as though he was trying to urge the words past a loose tooth. “Are you—it’s really been that long since someone did something specifically for you?”
at one point. She hates me for killing him.”
“No, I just.” Harry stopped moving and speaking for a long moment. “James needs his mum.”
Malfoy paused for a long moment. Harry looked longingly over his shoulder, almost wishing that James would have the kind of tantrum that he did when he went too long without a nap, but he was happily hissing away with Scorpius and their snakes.
“Besides Parkinson forcing the snake I didn’t want on me?”
But that wasn’t his problem. The snake would just have to deal with the inconvenience.
That, Harry knew, would bother James even more than the idea that he had committed some unknown crime. He rubbed his hand gently up and down his son’s back, again and again, and finally James relaxed against him.
Harry ignored her again. “Well, then I’m going to keep refusing Malfoy’s offers. Thanks but no thanks.”
Potter gave him a bright smile. “Good thing I can afford it, then.”
to try and get him on the side of the snakes?
“Yeah.”
” the snake agreed. “
“So your talk that infuriated my parents about respecting Muggles and Muggleborns,” Draco began.
“You have no idea what you’re rejecting,” Parkinson said, her eyes hard. “Not just the ability to participate in ritual circles like the one we did the other day—”
“What? How dare you—”
“They do
“I know that you have the right to make that decision, Harry. Just—is it right for him to grow up with the children of Death Eaters?”
“Maybe,” Harry said, which was a good enough promise with as sleepy as James was. He yawned once more, gave a huge stretch, and went to sleep so fast that Harry could only stare.
have venom. He studied it in the light. Bright red stripes caught down its golden body, so bright that he was inclined to believe it wasn’t natural, but a magical creature someone had made in Gryffindor colors.
It was a blue-grey color that Harry could have admitted was lovely if he was ever going to admit anything like that, interrupted by black bands. When it lifted its head, Harry could see that the head and belly were a soft yellow color. Its tail had an odd shape to it, but Harry couldn’t fully glimpse it from where he was standing.
Just another thing he had to do because of what had happened in the past, if he wanted to raise a good son.
“When you’re practicing ritual magic—well,
With a sigh, Harry also switched to Parseltongue. “
“I think it’s a good thing that you’re talking to your friends,” Draco said mildly, surprising Potter into a sidelong stare. “But that doesn’t mean I can’t help as well.”
“You don’t have to look as though you’re about to be devoured by a pack of werewolves, Potter,” Malfoy muttered out of the corner of his mouth.
it seemed, when his wife left him and he had to take care of his son.
Potter narrowed his eyes at him. “Keep the swearing down when the children are present, Malfoy. And remember that they can understand Parseltongue, too.”
She said “campaigning” like it was a dirty word, and even though it was almost a year later before they divorced, Draco knew then that his marriage was over.
And that was the way he had to think of it, he thought, carefully reorienting himself, managing to skip over the bright-hot pain of losing James’s mother. The Parseltongue was something he was doing for his son. James would feel more comfortable because Harry also had a snake. This was like retiring from the Aurors or committing, as carefully as he could, to staying away from the Burrow when he knew Ginny was going to be there.
” Harry watched his left hand close on the handle of a basket. “But there were also other people who apparently spent time around one of his safehouses or the like. Some of those less tangible connections…it’s hard to trace. I was hoping to consult with you about it.”
Ron, watching from the other side of the dining room, winced a little as Hermione extended her hand to Sela and let Sela’s tongue touch her fingers, but at least he wasn’t upset or trying to interfere. Harry smiled at him, winked with a casualness he didn’t feel, and glanced at James and Sapphire. James stepped forwards and said, “
,” Harry told him quietly. “
Harry would have challenged Voldemort’s heart not to melt at the look in his son’s eyes. He took a deep breath and spoke, “
“Go to hell,” Harry said pleasantly, and walked out of the ritual room.
Ron grinned at him, although it was a bit shadowed. “There’s no saying that you can’t find someone else to practice it with, though. Someone you could be comfortable with and could date, even. Did I tell you that Cho Chang asked me about you the other day?”
very many Gryffindor Parselmouths other than him. There had been few Marked Death Eaters in Gryffindor in this last war, and the two Harry survivors was aware of were in prison.
“No, I just guessed what would put that expression on your face.” Harry sighed when Hermione looked as unhappy as she had the last time she heard about a mistreated house-elf. “Listen, Hermione, the main thing I hope is that the pregnancy goes well and the baby and Ginny are healthy and that someday James can have a good relationship with his half-sibling. That’s all.”
,” Sela hissed, sounding petulant. “
Draco paused, his fingers smoothing along the back of Edwina’s hood while she hissed sleepy compliments about how good he was at this. “I have no desire to bribe people in the Ministry the way my father did.”
Harry placed his wand between them so he could Stun her easily if he had to, and hissed a warning. The snake stopped in place, coiling back and forth, obeying him but obviously resentful about it. Harry sighed. “
Malfoy gave a shivering flinch and then ignored Voldemort’s name. “But you aren’t.”
That was a phrase straight out of the pamphlet that Draco distributed to anxious parents. He eyed Potter and wondered why the git had decided to repeat it now. “Yes.”
“Wh-what did you do, then?” The man had his courage back, from the way he glared at Parkinson with folded arms.
” Harry shifted to the side, intending to get up and walk to the bathroom, and received a nudge in the ribs from her head. Growling under his breath, he turned so that she could climb up and coil around his arm near his shoulder.
Malfoy’s voice could have cut through the black stone that made up the walls and floor of the ritual room, Harry thought. Parkinson gasped. Goyle stared at him as if he didn’t know what to do with that information. Harry folded his arms and glanced away.
“Hello, Potter.”
It was a variation of the Parseltongue word for “light.” Harry looked at her again and saw her neck stretched yearningly towards him.
It was Parkinson who replied, glancing at them out of the corner of one dark green eye. “
“You were offering me something that really seemed to be for me,” Harry said. “Not for James or because it would gain you power. For me.”
Harry rolled his eyes because he couldn’t
Harry nodded, keeping his face quiet and neutral. It was difficult. When he looked at Goyle, he remembered Crabbe burning to death in the Room of Requirement. With Parkinson, he could remember her voice demanding that he be thrown to Voldemort.
“No, Harry, you did.” She was astonishingly composed, now, but the tears kept on flowing as she looked away from him. “That’s what you think of me. You think I’m

“Potter?”
“Lots of
, specifically. I don’t want to deal with any outbursts.”
Malfoy smiled as if that pleased him, but kept watching Harry. “What changed your mind?”
“A moment of your time, Potter.”
He turned to Malfoy, and waited for his assessment of whatever he had done wrong.
Draco watched Potter and his son go, and tried not to show how shaken he was, although from the way Edwina coiled closer to him, she could sense it. Scorpius and Charlie were giving him thoughtful glances, too.
Draco watched them go, and answered Edwina’s soft question with only an, “
James nodded. “
The whole crowd perked up at that. That was a perception they had pushed again and again in their writing, and which Harry had refused to agree with. Now, it seemed, he was ready to spin the narrative that painted him as the lucky Boy-Who-Lived, and the sacrifices along the way as necessary.
that you’re getting something out of this. That you’re not just turning it into another sacrifice for your son.”
It was as if even his body warmth had been shut away behind some door Draco didn’t know how to unlock. Draco couldn’t sense his magic, either, which had been so resonant around him the last time he’d visited the school. Draco bit his lip and said softly, “Are you all right, Potter?”
But if he held Sela to a working partnership, and pushed back, and worked with her on the nightmares—well, she couldn’t betray him to anyone except another Parselmouth, unlike that bloody Mind-Healer. And Harry would prefer it if he could stop feeling this way, always unmoored and exhausted and hurt.
” James said, apparently deciding that he could get over his shyness about speaking in front of a snake.
Draco stroked Edwina’s scales with one soft fingertip as he turned to take Scorpius back home.
“I think they should be treated better. But I’m not out there
And Harry had to stand there and watch her walk away. He knew, even then, knowledge as deep as his bones, that if he had found the right words, or hadn’t meant what he said, she would have stopped and turned around, and James would have had his mum.
But it was going to be different for his son. Harry swore it.
understand it. The way James had lit up at the sight of Scorpius made up for it, but not as much as Harry would have liked it to. “Hello, Malfoy.”
“That’s not what I meant. I mean that you want to change hearts and minds, that you’re going to go out there and
Blaise just rolled his eyes as he said, “No, the future Mr Harry Potter.”
Harry was nowhere to be seen, so Draco gently sat on the couch and relived the happiness of his evening before he went upstairs.
“I’m sure, but I think Draco can accept a bit of help.”  He looked around and saw a potion bottle sitting on the table next to the cot.  “Is this a pain potion?  Here, drink it.”
Harry still could not believe the amount of people that had shown up for his Birthday.  Kingsley Shacklebolt was the one that really shocked him.  All of the Weasley’s were in attendance, as well as a few of their significant others.  Harry was pleased to see that Angelina Johnson was sitting next to George, holding his hand.  He’d have to ask Ron about that one later.  Even Professor McGonagall had made an appearance, briefly.  She said she couldn’t stay long, as there were crews working around the clock fixing Hogwarts so that the castle would be ready for the start of term on September 1
“Thanks, Mione.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ready!  Is Hermione and Ron meeting us there?”
“Talk.”
“Ron! What the here are you doing in here?!”
Harry’s smile grew even larger, if it were possible, and winked at Draco as he turned and walked out the door.
Harry stood, walked over to stand by Ron, and pulled up into a big hug.
“I agree,” McGonagall nodded.  “As they’ve gotten closer, the bond has picked up on that, and made them both more powerful wizards than they already were.  I know that you two gentlemen will do great and powerful things, once you’ve left Hogwarts.”
When neither Ron nor Draco had come out of the room after 45 minutes, Harry decided enough was enough.  He walked over to their door and knocked loudly three times on it.
“They were in here?  How in the here is that possible?”  He looked around, trying to see if there were any more lurkers.
Harry and Draco spent the next hour walking through the store, finding pieces that would work in the room.  Harry was grateful for Draco coming along, and continually told him so.  He had an idea of what he wanted, but with Draco’s help, he was able to find stylish pieces that all seemed to all fit together.
Harry had turned back around to say something more, but the words died in the back of his throat as he realised Draco was standing less than a foot away from him.
He quickly realized what he had done, and saying, “I’m sorry,” he started to unroll his sleeves, and turned to walk out of the room.
Draco smiled at him, but it turned into a wince as a sudden shot of pain through his body.
“What’s going to happen?  I have his wand!”
“Shhh, Teddy.  Uncle Harry isn’t a morning person,” Draco said, finally opening his eyes and taking in the sight of the two lying beside him.  “Nor am I.  Come on, snuggle up and let us sleep a little bit longer, and then we will make a snowman.  Promise.”
“I do love having you in me, but every now and then, I love to pound you out.”
, he thought.  He sighed as he sat up on the couch, rubbing his face.  Another day, another excuse from his husband.
“I truly do not want to spend another night away from you, and if you live here, I won’t have to.  I hate you leaving in the mornings, going back to the Manor to change into your work clothes.  This is your home, too.  You helped make it this way, and I can see your mark in every room in this house, already.  Please?  Will you officially move in?”
“Hey,” Harry said with a smile.
“Shit!” Draco yelled, rolling over onto his back, slapping his hand over his eyes.  “I’m sorry, Harry, for getting you involved.  I’ll be right back.”
Taking a somewhat wheezing breath, Draco tried to speak.  His mouth and throat weren’t cooperating, though, so it took a few tries before he was able to emit a strangled, “Harry?”
“About 7:45.  You need to shower and get dressed; you’re getting married, today.”
“Ha! Pansy?! Oh, I can’t wait to tell her that!  No, she is one of my best friends, nothing more.  I hadn’t told my parents until Christmas of 5
“Get everything back to the Burrow?” Ron asked, ignoring Harry’s question.
“Er, yeah.  I went to Diagon this morning as part of my project, and decided to stop in at Ollivander’s.”
“Well, it makes it easier, that way!”
“As I said, this is all very interesting.  I will see you on Monday, then.”  She nodded, turned, and disappeared in a flash of green flames.
“Yes,” he said, nodding his head.
“Oof, I guess I’d better go pack for tonight.”
Harry smiled as he saw the Slytherin Smirk™ appear on Blaise’s face.
Harry had to hold back a snort at the sudden shift in Malfoy’s speech.
“Mother said she would love to be able to come look through the furniture, if you weren’t busy?”
Draco looked up, eyes wide.  “Harry…”
“…means there’s nothing left for us to fight for,” Harry repeated at the same time.  He sighed.  “Love, look at me,” Harry said, tilting Draco’s face up and cupping his cheek.  “You’re right.  We won’t be able to call or owl.  And it may be months before we get back.  But, know that I love you more than anything in this world, and I will
Harry wanted to ask more questions, but the warmth of Draco’s body and the darkness of the room lulled him.  He pulled Draco tighter against him, and within moments he drifted back into unconsciousness.
“What I’m trying to say, is, I didn’t know how to show affection…hell, I didn’t even know it was
Harry glanced up at Ron, whose wide eyes and reddened cheeks were looking at Harry.
"Yeah, yeah," Harry laughed, but he could see the wetness in Draco’s eyes.  He could feel it in his own, as well.  He grabbed his wand and duffle bag, and started down the stairs.
“It’s not a normal case, though,” Draco argued.  “We won’t be able to talk or text on the mobile.  Hell, we won't even be able to owl.  I won’t know that you’re alright.  It could be months, maybe even years until—”  He broke off, taking a deep breath, trying to keep the tears at bay.
“Well, what’s first, Professor?”
“She is absolutely right, Mr. Potter.”
Ron’s was a photo of Ron and Harry playing chess in the Gryffindor common room, in what looked to be fifth year.
“Not possible.”
“Yeah, that’s what I said.  It’s impressive magic, as McGonagall and Ollivander both keep telling me.  I still don’t know what it all means, but I’ve been reminded once again that my magic is powerful.”
He slowly made his way down the stairs, occasionally peeking into a room, when he heard a loud bang and a muffled curse word coming from what he imagined was the kitchen.  He picked up his pace and smiled when he stepped into the room and saw Harry stood at the hob.
Getting to the next landing, he realised the noise was coming from their bedroom.  Getting nervous, he tightened his grip on his wand and took the stairs two at a time.  He slowly walked toward the door, seeing that it was cracked open.  He peeked around the edge of the door frame, and saw a shadow of a person, bent over, digging through the bottom drawer of their chest of drawers.
They looked at each other, and then Ron said, “Uh, yeah.”
“What—how—why would you think that?”
“I know.”  Harry leant back in for another kiss.  This one wasn’t as aggressive as the last.  They both just allowed themselves the pleasure of the other.
Draco gently sat up and gasped, widening his at Harry!  “It’s not a lump! It’s Teddy!  How did he get there?”
“I missed you, too.  You were all I could think about.  Sometime it got me in trouble when one of my team would have to snap me out of my daydreaming.”  He chuckled, making Draco smile.
As he crawled out of bed, he realized that it was his birthday.
“You’ve just been spending a lot of time together, remodelling Grimmauld, is all,” Hermione said.  Harry noticed her and Ron giving each other more looks.
He looked towards the door to see Bev walking in with a letter in her hand.  “This just came for you.  Looks like Draco’s handwriting.”
“Just—just let me sleep on all that you’ve told me, okay?  I’ll see you Thursday, and maybe we can talk some more.”
Draco apparently saw the look in his eyes because he quickly kissed Harry again.  “No, Harry!  I want to.  Gods, do I want to.  But I have plans with Weasley in the morning, so it would be wise of me to actually go home and
Draco, who was still breathing hard, and whose eyes were closed, slowly opened one eye to look up at Harry.
Draco looked back inside, and pulled out a glass penguin, handing it to Harry.  “I spent the day with Teddy on your birthday.  I knew I couldn’t spend the day alone, wallowing at the Manor, so I wrote to Aunt Andromeda to see if I could have him for the day.
2. I'm sorry!
It took a split second, and then there were screams coming from one corner of the room, where Narcissa and Molly were both seated, hands gripped together.  They turned and hugged each other before they both jumped up and raced towards Harry and Draco.
He pulled back, letting the cock flop out of his mouth, and licked up the vein, before pulling it back in, letting the head rest on his tongue, sucking and lolling his tongue around the slit.  He flicked open the lube and got a little on his fingers.  Still sucking on the head of Draco’s cock, he gently prodded one finger against his hole, tapping it when Draco started bucking his hips.
“Hey, baby,” Harry said with a smile, as he got close enough for Draco to help him.
“A blowjob says it’s just Hermione, and that she left Ron to finish getting dressed.”
“Really?  What are we celebrating?”
“It was.  That mousse was perfect.”
“I am glad you are okay, Mr Malfoy, and I am glad Mr Potter had the sense to bring you straight here.”  She nodded towards Harry.  “I will let you know if I find anything out.”  With that, she turned and strode toward the doors.
“Me, too.  Her little brother isn’t so bad, either.”  He nodded towards where Hermione was walking out of the kitchen with Hugo in one arm, and a bottle of milk in the other.  Her hair had melting snow in it, too, but the whimpering baby was occupying her at the moment.
was down this part of the alley, as well as some more higher end clothing stores.  Soon, he came up to the studio of
The Prophet publishes an article on their engagement.
Draco wrapped his legs tighter around Harry.  “Harry!  I’m going to—” With a couple more thrusts up from Harry, Draco howled as he came.  Harry continued bucking up against the man, and after just three more pushes, he wailed his release.
Draco shifted, pulling back.  Harry whined as he opened his eyes and reached for him.  “Where are you going?”
Draco nodded, but continued to stare at the floor.
“Wait.  What?!”
Draco moved the hand with the bowl to the side, stepping up against Harry and pulling him in close for a lingering kiss.  Harry nearly let go of the bowl, but was able to hold it steady as his other arm wrapped around Draco’s waist.
Shaking his head, he turned around and saw a group of people gathering in a tight circle.  He walked towards them, trying to figure out what was going on, and was beyond shocked to see Harry pushing through the crowd, his arms laden with what looked like cups and muggle to-go containers.
“Harry, you have to take him to Madam Pomfrey.  Can you apparate?”  Harry nodded.
He laid back down, rubbing his right hand over his face as his left reached for his glasses on the night stand. Slipping them on, he looked over at the clock to see that it was barely 6:00am.
“No, I mean it.  It suits you.”
“Well, yeah, mate, obviously,” Ron said.  “But, it also means that you and Malfoy have compatible magic.”
“They’re new,” George said.  “They have instructions in the box.  They are also not to be opened in present company,” George said quietly, with a wink.
“No!  The one that plead guilty told his story, and the other two assholes decided it was futile to try and act like they weren’t a part of it.”
They stepped into the hall, and made their way over to the table.  There were two seats left in the middle of the table, in between Hermione and Seamus.  Harry walked over and sat down next to Hermione.
“Not sure, but both were a bumbling mess before they left, so we’ll see.”
“That could be arranged, Auror Potter,” Draco said, smiling sexily at his lover.
He looked down at Draco’s face.  His eyes were open, feasting on Harry’s face as he continued to thrust into him.
Draco smirked at him as he left the room to head downstairs.  Harry could have sworn, though, that he faintly heard a “I guess we’ll find out.”
Suddenly, he realized exactly just how late he was.  Most of the other students had already been in and gone, and the 8
“Done and done,” Harry smiled at her as he filled his plate with food.
The next thing he knew, Draco was being woken up again to a giggling Teddy, who was in the midst of a tickle fight with Harry.  He blearily opened his eyes, smiling at the two in front of him.
“I love you, too, sweetheart.  Have fun with your uncles.”
you decide to be traditional?”
“Tell me what?”
He knocked thrice before entering the office.  The impressive figure of Kingsley Shacklebolt stood behind his desk, staring at the paper filled board that was on the wall behind his chair.
Draco saw the movement, and he slowly sat up next to Harry.
He leaned over and lightly jabbed Hermione in the ribs.  She looked over and saw that the owl was on the table.
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw one of his team trying to set up another tent and putting up signs.  He looked back at Harry, who was once again staring at the table, his food sat to the side.
, 6:00pm. Where: 12 Grimmauld Place.  Why: Because my man is back!’”
“You’re kidding, right?  They’re gorgeous.  I can’t believe you made them.”
“Ron yelled at me.  He told me what you three had spoken about at the birthday party.  About your fears.  But you have to know what has been going on, please.”
Draco laughed, lightly slapping Harry’s arm.  “Oh, posh.  Come on.  While it’s beautiful, it’s absolutely freezing!  Let’s go get checked in.”
“Wake up wake up wake up!  It’s Christmas!”
“What are you up to, Harry?” She tried sounding nonchalant, but Harry knew her too well; it came out accusatory.
“Godric, I hope that isn’t plastered everywhere when this comes out. That’s just awful.”
Draco looked back down at the table as Harry moved to stand against the island in the middle of the room.
Harry’s eyes grew wide at the implications.  “I’m going to hold you to that.  I’ll see you later.  Love you!”  He gave him another peck and then went down the stairs to the kitchen.
They chatted a bit more as they finished their lunch, and then they all stood to say goodbye.  Hermione flooed out of the restaurant, which just left Ron and Harry, standing by the table.
“So, what were you two really talking about when I walked up with the food?”
“Merry Christmas, Harry!”  Hermione got up from her spot on the floor, coming over to give Harry a hug.  “When did you do this room?  How did I not notice the other day?  It’s great!”
“Again, it’s Harry.  And I can ‘associate’ with whomever I wish to.  They’ll just have to get over it.  I’m tired.  No more.”
“I came by to talk to you about something, I only planned to get your attention by pushing my front against your back. You’re the one who turned around, not to mention the staring at my lips and the 'kiss me’ eyes. So I did, and you kissed back.”
“I'll love them so much, and they'll still be sleeping in their parents' bed when they were 15."
“So, sensing a soulmate, anything else important I should know straight away?”
, but also contained another name.
"Eww, I can't believe this. Why me? Of everyone, why did I have to be tricked and screwed over?"
“Please Harry, we have to talk about it.”
"Drive as fast as you can, just get me as close to home as possible!"
The professor paused her lecture, allowing the force of information she'd rattled out to settle over everyone. It gave me comfort to be told that sexuality is different among everyone, so my feelings for Gemini don't make me a freak. Also, knowing wizards were more accepting gave him hope Gemini wouldn't react too badly. I didn't pay attention to any of the rest, my worries resolved by the first half of her lecture. I picked up on words from Ron about fancying his pen pal and from Benylin like 'lovemaking' and immediately tuned everyone out. Instead, I focused on the idea of what to say to Gemini later.
He helped me up, and I ended up flush against him, his arms around my waist. He was so warm, and yet his hands were still colder. Was that strange? It certainly felt like a lovely contrast. He told me that my room was in the dungeons, so he'd be able to walk me there as often as possible. If I wanted him to. With everything he did, there'd be a sense of hesitation, like he was stepping on eggshells.
I nodded and smiled at him. It was sometimes obvious Neville felt uncomfortable around me, or Hermione and Ron. Everyone called us the 'Golden Trio', making some friends feel less a part of the group. It wasn't on purpose, and I made mental note to make sure to pay more attention to it. Neville was as much his friend as Hermione and Ron, he just needed to include himself with them a little more.
“Oh, and Neville,” Harry grinned. “Professor Snape wanted to see you, I must have forgotten to mention that at lunch.”
Thanks for reading, hope you're enjoying it, I'll try to update as soon as possible. Please drop a review to let me know if you like it and if you have any suggestions for character development.
They all burst through to platform 9 ¾, nearly bumping into Frank and Lily, who greeted their big brother with a big hug. Frank hugged Leo, and they skipped off to load their stuff on the train. Aries helped Lily carry her trunks to the train, and boarded. They stood on the platform, Ron and Hermione, Draco and Harry, and Severus and Neville, waving to their children as they headed off on their first year at Hogwarts, as they headed off as one big family.
The only spot left was between Neville and a Hufflepuff I didn't know. The professor wasn't in the classroom yet, so I took my chances that sitting there wouldn't be an issue. He smiled as I dropped my bag, but there was a nervous undertone to his eyes. It was a look he usually only had around Snape and McGonagall. I wrote a small note, asking if he was okay. Neville probably wouldn't open up to me, but he definitely wouldn't if someone could hear. I tried not to raise my eyebrows as he scrawled a response underneath it.
"Look, let me finish up cooking the meats for the main and then I'll bring the soup to the table for us."
Harry was struck dumb, but Malfoy didn't let him ask questions. One minute he was holding Harry's arm, preventing an escape, and then Harry was alone. This easily could have been a trap or a prank, but Malfoy's tone sounded serious. And he could have something really important to say, detrimental to the war or something. Harry needed to hear him out, a fight was coming and Dumbledore wasn't preparing him, so he needed all the advantages he could get. But first, Hermione needed to be told, so someone would know where he went if it was a trap. Harry had learnt from last years blunder with the Ministry.
Not sure how to behave after insulting royalty, Harry simply bowed his head. "I'm so sorry, your highness. I had no idea... If I had known, I would have... I'm sorry. I've never been to a ball before, I don't know how to act or dance or... I don't even know why I came anymore."
I rushed out of the Common Room and steadily jogged to the Owlery. It was only the beginning of the year, so the smell wasn't overpowering, but you could tell there were loads of owls in there. You could hear them from the bottom of the staircase. I pushed the door open haphazardly and accidentally hit whoever was on the other side of it. They fell to the floor and grumbled in pain. I was terribly sorry and babbled to tell them as I held my hand out to them.
Harry was just about ready to confirm that his cousins only bought so much because they wanted him to struggle. They had two feet each, why did they need to buy 6 pairs of shoes today, when they had loads at home? It was an obvious answer. Harry had to carry them all as he followed them shop to shop. It was to torment him. The more muscle he built up, the less likely an alpha would want to bond with him. It was a pretty paranoid view but was usually true. Dudley enjoyed going out of his way to punish him for being a prettier omega.
“I hope I’m still in Gryffindor,” Seamus smirked. “And I hope Headmistress McGonagall lets me blow something up again, like the Slytherin dorms.”
I sat on my bed awkwardly while they looked at me with new eyes. Hermione started talking about summer events, insisting to Ron that she went in chronological order, so he couldn't shoot his mouth off yet. I chuckled slightly, enjoying their bitching. She told me about a holiday she'd had with her parents, as well as some other mediocre things she'd done in the holidays. It sounded rather dull, but I hung on every word. It beat talking about my problems, so I was grateful for the subject change.
Harry threw himself at Draco, crashing their lips together, and Draco immediately pushed him against the door and pressed their bodies together. When Harry felt Draco pull away, Harry grabbed his hair and pulled back to him. Draco groaned in his throat and grabbed Harry’s ass. Harry gasped against Draco lips, and Draco moved to kiss along his neck, sucking and licking along his neck. That when Draco pulled back, and pulled Harry towards the bed, pushing him down.
“Look, let’s just cut the bullshit,” Malfoy frowned. “We’re in the same house, we share a dorm room, let’s just try and cut the shit.”
"Harry maybe?" Hermione spoke up, drawing both of their attentions. "I mean, he'll need proper clothes at a royal ball."
When Harry woke up the following morning, Draco wasn’t in bed. He turned his head to see Draco getting his school uniform together. In his underwear. Harry’s eyes were drawn to the blonde’s ass, and how firm in looked. Harry desperately wanted to go over and grab it but restrained himself. He wanted to talk to his father about it before he acted on anything.
I took a huge breath, trying to hold onto my courage as I knocked on Professor Snape’s door. When he answered the door, he was just in his trousers and shirt, with his shirt buttons open, flashing his torso. I nearly lost my breath, so I tried to focus on the clock behind Snape, rather than his body. Snape was shocked to see me and asked why I was even there.
“It’s alright, but you can get off me now.”
"I'm sorry Ginny, a lot has happened to me, stuff you won't understand." I smiled sadly, stroking my thumb across her knuckles. "I know how you feel about me, and I wish I could feel the same way, and be happy with you. But I don't. Don't think this is any reflection on you, it's purely me. You're a beautiful, intelligent and brave girl Ginny, and there's someone out there perfect for a girl like you, but it's not girls that I'm into. I'm so sorry."
I shook my head at her bluntness, "that was the second time we've kissed properly, so that's why you haven't heard anything. And I'd rather he didn't find out about how long I've wanted him. He knows I've always wanted to be his friend, but not that I've wanted to be more before now. I don't know how he'd react."
Harry looked down at his clothes, the grey garments under a forest green waistcoat, draped by a beautiful green frock coat. It was the same shade of green but had a silver lining and snakes circling the wrist cuffs and lapels. But Harry's favourite part had to be the signet ring, the golden lion on the silver ring. The same as the crest on his necklace. He loved it.
"That's a reason I wanted to come tonight. I know I'll never be good enough for a prince, but I hoped there'd be an alpha here that I could connect with. I want to love and have a family, things I'm not used to having. Tonight was maybe the only chance I'd have to do that."
The three exchanged a surprised look, as though they'd forgotten Harry was an eligible omega and included in the invitation. He wouldn't admit it, but the thought excited Harry. He wasn't confident enough to have made the comment, even though the thought passed his mind. And he was surprised Ron had made the comment, as it was a risk for a beating from his mother, the cook. But they wouldn't let him go. Harry didn't have anything to wear, or have any idea how he was supposed to act, but he did want to go. Harry wasn't enough for a prince, but he could find a nice alpha at a masquerade like that. And get himself out of from under his aunt's thumb.
It itched as his fangs elongated, drawn to where his alpha's scent was strongest and sinking in to finish the bond. And it felt like everything in the world coming together, snapping together like the perfection it should be and living him glowing with his alpha still inside him. It reminded him that a knot would lock them in place, now that the heatwave had faded he remembered his instruction book.
“Oh no, what have I done to you?”
“So am I,” Harry grinned.
"Draco, I want you." I panted. "I want to go all the way with you, and I want you to top."
“Have you got everything you need?” Snape asked.
"Hey, mind if we try doing that 69 position. I want to try returning the favour."
He let out a shaky breath and I felt encouraged. I wanted to say more, to drive him wild with words like he can do with his mouth. But I didn't know what to say. But then I thought of something that might make him shiver. The only worry was that the slow pace, which was getting better and better, would be too distracting that it wouldn't work. I said sexy in Parseltongue. He moaned loudly and snapped his hips forward. It was harsh but good. Really good.
"You see, whether you come or not doesn't matter, the prince will be in love with me by the end of the night." He started, while Harry poured water down his back and scrubbed the rolls. "Mother says the best alphas prefer a docile omega, one that does as they're told and will worship the ground they walk on (Harry hoped that wasn't true, but even if it was Dudley would be hopeless, he argued and shouted at his own mother like a 3-year-old, let alone worshipping an alpha he didn't even know).
He looked away, facing forward. I did the same, waiting and hoping for him to apologise or take back what he said because I didn't want to lose my best friend. When nothing was said, I guessed he wasn't talking to me, effectively ending our friendship.
His face straightened seriously, which sobered the mood drastically, "if you think you're going to hurt yourself, don't. If you don't want to tell anyone, then just come to find me instead. I want to help you."
The pen landed on the floor, sliding down the bed curtains after I threw it away from me. I wanted it away before I wrote anymore and made a bigger fool of myself. My handwriting was already a cause for shame, looking like a 10-year-old wrote it under the script of an adult with really beautiful penmanship. It was really, very well written. I had to admire it. Maybe when the project was over, and we could be friends face-to-face, he could teach me to write better. Looked fancy and curly, sort of feminine. But I'd say that it was too early to say that, he might not see it as a compliment.
“Well Nev,” Harry smiled. “Let’s eat.”
"Now, I'd say that's enough. Not a ball appropriate outfit, I'm afraid. You'll be staying here, boy." Petunia chuckled, herding her children out while Ron went to prepare the carriage with fury in his eyes.
And Harry did love it. It reminded him of the frock coat from the shop this morning. It wasn't as fitted on his body, it was the opposite in some places. But it was red, and they'd found gold lace to line the trimmings. And the waistcoat was red. Harry realised the white shirt, stockings and breaches weren't altered, but the fabric was harder to work with. Either way, it made Harry look better than he thought he would. And it was certainly presentable, because his cousins looked outraged when he entered the entryway, turning to their mother to make him stay at home.
“What the fuck are you playing at?” He scowled.
“I want to ask you something because I love you so much, I couldn’t bear the thought of being without you. I need you, and you need me, and now we have a family together. I could only think of one thing that would make me happier. Harry, my love, will you marry me?”
Only Hermione picked up her quill. Like me, it seemed nobody else had any idea what to call themselves. I caught Ron's eye and made a confused face, which he just smiled at. He mouthed something, though I only understood 'bit of fun'. So I guessed he wasn't taking it as seriously as we were meant to. I looked back at the little white strip as I picked up my quill. I didn't want to go obvious since this was a shot to make an ally without being Harry Potter, the crazy boy saying Voldemort was back from the dead, but I could be anyone. It was like Professor Benylin said, I could just get to know somebody without prejudice. So I scrawled my first idea down.
Ron spluttered through his apology at breakfast, looking at my plate instead of me. I waved him off, I expected the apology. Ron being sorry and us being friends again was a given the minute he dropped the ears. But my actual relationship was the worry right now. He wasn't at breakfast, so I hadn't spoken to him yet like I'd planned. I was really starting to worry.
I'm posting the first three chapters together because I want more of a taster chunk. So people can get into the story, but also the concept of the series. I hope you enjoyed it!!
"And my son, Dudley, here is an omega, I'm sure the one you're searching for," she grinned and pushed her son forward.
Harry looked down, smiling at the lion crest necklace. It wouldn't just be his memories he could hold on to from this night. And he hoped the prince would keep his ring, a keepsake from a special night. Harry never wanted to take off his necklace. It was beautiful, his long-forgotten family crest and something that connects him to his sweet prince. Besides, if he wore it under his clothes, his relatives would never find out.
Harry woke up with a big yawn, stretching out, but not feeling Draco next to him. He opened his eyes, and couldn’t see Draco, not in his bed or Draco’s, but he heard the shower from the bathroom. Harry smiled, he felt a little sore, but happy, until he saw a note on his bedside time. He picked it up, no idea what it was, and read it’s neat familiar script.
I left my friends in the doorway and ran before Slughorn came into the room. I didn't know where to look. I guessed the Slytherin dorms, but I wouldn't be able to get in them. It would be a waste of time if he wasn't there. Then it hit me, I could use the Marauder's Map. It would tell me exactly where he was, and I'd know if he was okay because of who he was with. I ran as fast as I could back to my suite.
His words left me rereading them. The concept of Malfoy's reputation meant so little to me that it hadn't crossed my mind. It brought up memories of other times he'd said things to me, just because somebody else had, or even because there were older Slytherins around. It made a sort of sense now Gemini explained. I felt a little embarrassed that he urged me not to be defensive, knowing I would have been towards anyone but him. Why was it different that he was the one saying it?
Harry nodded. The plan was that Sirius and Remus would drive him to King’s Cross Station, where Severus would meet him to wish him luck before apparating to Hogsmeade ahead of the train to get something before he went to Hogwarts. Sirius grabbed Harry’s trunks and they headed down the stairs. Remus greeted Harry with a note and a cage. The cage contained a small snowy owl, and it reminded Harry of Hedwig. But he’d already got a new broom off them, and even Severus had already given him something, a potions book.
Draco leaned in close, whispering right into his ear. "Nothing."
“Well, it’s in the cupboard,” Draco grinned, from under Harry.
“I’m happy for them too, now they can be as happy as we are,” Neville grinned. “I love you Sev.”
Warning for the smut, I've never written an alpha/omega thing before, and I kind of lost motivation a lot during this. It's taken like 3 separate sessions to get something this half baked done. I couldn't even be bothered to proofread it. So be a more little lenient with me please, I tried my hardest.
Harry shrugged. "She'll get over it, not her first boyfriend. Besides, McLaggen's on the side to keep her company."
The alpha doesn't move, whispering to his omega so she passes the tray to him and rushes off. He glances at the prince with a nod. The action caused hope to flare in the prince, making him silently beg the heavens that the other alpha knows his Harry, and sent the omega to fetch him because of how territorial alphas can be. But it didn't wash out the shrill voice of the foolish woman arguing with Blaise.
"I'm giving you 1 for every minute you overslept this morning, as well as two for every chore you've missed." He chuckled, "so that'll be…25 hits."
All through his first lesson, Harry thought about a demon’s ability to get pregnant, now that it was confirmed that he could, and was embarrassed that he’d forgotten it. That’s when the worry and panic set in, as he remembered they forgot to have that talk about protection, and that they hadn’t been safe for the whole month they were together. For the entire hour and a half, Harry sat there worrying over pregnancy, and Draco’s reaction if he was pregnant. He decided the best thing to do was to go and see Madam Pomfrey, so he’d know whether or not he was for sure.
A relieved sigh stormed out of me before I could catch it. He seemed completely oblivious to my fuck up. He didn't know it was me. Thankfully. I scribbled an agreement and made up an excuse to put down the journal. I didn't want to risk another slip up, not when I'd already dodged a bullet. The excuse became reality when Ron opened the door and asked if I wanted to play wizard's chess. I usually always said no, I'd only lose, but now I needed the distraction.
~o0o~
Harry smiled, as Snape shooed him off to class. He felt ok with leaving him on his own, knowing Neville, he would probably pop over to see him, not that Snape will tell him, cos Snape will wait until night when they could definitely be alone. Harry left Snape to mark whatever papers were in front of him and headed off to Charms.
"Why did you name our children after constellations?" Harry smiled.
Harry blushed scarlet as everyone raised their glasses with a cheer, some nobles wearing a particular knowing smile. He'd never thought that when he lost his virginity a room full of rich people would know exactly what he was doing. But when his alpha looked down to him with an apologetic smile, that was all Harry needed to feel soothed. It became obvious that it didn't matter what a room full of random people thought because he had Draco. And they were finally going to bond together. Hermione's secret book showed its usefulness immediately when the couple were alone, and Draco handed Harry a small vial.
, which to his credit Seamus enjoyed. His honesty opened up the other boys a little. Dean went with
"There are many lovely eligibles here, son. None in the gardens. Ask one of them to dance, perhaps then you can stop looking so bored."
It was then I bothered to notice the difference in the living room. Between one of the chairs and the couch, was a trunk that had been shrunk to fit in the gap. So he'd gone to his dorm and still come back. That was a sweet reassurance that he wouldn't leave tonight at least.
"They are beautiful."
And he felt the carriage move faster, like his heartbeat. Mystery alpha, ready or not he was coming.
Literally pulled an all-nighter, so I wrote crap to waste time, and this is what came out, so that's why the plot is weak, but it was a fun idea.
I didn't see it coming. Not then, never before, and barely now, but I felt his arms around my shoulders pulling me to rest against him. I was so busy telling my story, I'd neglected to notice him shuffle closer, and I'd never have expected him to react how he had. I tensed at the stunned reactions of those around us, which made him let go and move back. But then I missed his body heat...
"What are you thinking? Potter, of all people? You're a wealthy, attractive young man, you could have anyone, and you go and burden yourself with the damaged goods."
He pulled back in surprise, but his smile stayed in place as he enquired to what he was doing in my dream to make me groan. I stammered a no, and the pressure was back on my junk, and his lips were on my neck. I made another pathetic whining noise, and his lips travelled lower, so I tilted my head so he could carry on. He was getting me so heated too easily. But once again he stopped to get me to answer, and I knew I'd need to describe my dream to get him to carry on, so I started talking with the brightest blush spread across my face.
"Huh?"
"But you don't need to worry, I know what I'm doing. I've brewed this before." The blonde smiled before it turned sad. "I'm sorry about getting defensive this morning, I just felt embarrassed. It was rude to threaten you when you didn't do anything."
Draco left, leaving Harry in the middle of the room, standing awkwardly. Harry used a charm to quickly dry his body and tried to hurry as he got dressed. When his clothes were finally on he rushed downstairs and found Draco whispering to Pansy while Blaise and Neville were sharing Herbology tips. Neville smiled at Harry, and they all headed off to the Great Hall together.
I ran off back to my suite. I shrunk all his things and dumped it in a bag, which I hung on the door before I locked it. I needed to shut him off, then he can move on to someone he deserves. I know I won't be able to see him again for a while because he'll convince me I'm being silly and I know I'm not. I'm not good enough, I know that, and hopefully ending it like this will show him how I don't deserve him.
"Not that they're going to stick to it," Ron chuckled, nudging Harry's arm.
“There you are babe,” Draco sighed when Harry came into the room. “I’ve been looking everywhere for you.”
An uneasy combination of relief and excitement wired my body at his answer. I wasn't expecting a declaration of love or anything close, but having my interest returned made my heart race. It made it seem like endless potential leaked out of his words. I admitted to him how whenever he was sarcastic or witty my mind tried to imagine his mouth shaping the words or smirking like most Slytherins. I never thought to imagine more than his lips, meaning my mind mostly wondered to how soft they would feel if we kissed. He said he'd also thought of what a kiss would feel like between us, or the feel of my hair. He admitted the thought of running his fingers in my hair was really appealing to him.
I nodded, shoving Malfoy away. He carried on smiling, looking like he was going to say something, but we were interrupted. A giggling group of girls shuffled past us, some getting terribly close to me, and shockingly close to him. He tensed as a manicured hand brushed against his ass, and the girls almost swooned as they walked away. Malfoy just shook his head, asking how I ever put up with that. I was still confused by why they were fondling him anyway. He shuffled past me.
"HEAR YE! HEAR YE! PRINCE DRACO AND THE ROYAL FAMILY ARE HOSTING A MASQUERADE BALL FOR HIS 17TH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION! INVITATIONS ARE BEING SENT TO HOUSEHOLDS NOW!"
I rushed around, looking for the map in our room. I turned around at the sound of metal touching in the kitchen. I looked out, and there he was. He wasn't with someone else, or being tortured, and it didn't seem like he was avoiding me. He was cooking.
"Guess we won't get adorable little purebloods," Ron frowned.
"Hello there. What's your name, pretty thing?" An older alpha smiled, reaching to kiss Harry's hand in greeting.
“Where are you going?” Draco frowned.
Snape thought for a moment, “I’m going to lock you two in here because you need to resolve your issues.”
I grinned and agreed to anything he wanted. He shooed me onto the train, and I paced off to dump my trunk and find the compartment with Hermione and Ron in it. I was rushing between compartments when I slammed into someone's chest. I almost fell backwards, but steadying hands held onto my arms and kept me up. I looked up into smiling grey eyes, and the hands were removed from my biceps.
(See the end of the chapter for
Before I could think to say anything on the subject, Blaise's lips were pressed against mine. I felt his tongue on my lower lip and I reflexively parted them. He didn't hesitate to slide his tongue against mine, encouraging groan enticing me to reciprocate. I almost couldn't feel the cold winter breeze, everything feeling warm as my body registered I being pulled into Blaise's arms and wrapped my arms around his neck. My bold actions made me blush, it was terribly unlike me.
"As much as I want to stay wrapped up in your arms, we should get to dinner before our friends start to worry about our absences."
Draco came in, rubbing his left eye and carrying a glass of water. He looked me over. Tear-stained cheeks, hazy eyes and my wand pressed over old scars. He opened his mouth, probably to yell at me as his eyebrows curved down, but then the tears started again. I was relieved he hadn't felt. Ecstatic over how confused and angry he looked over seeing me this way. I let my doubts get to me, but once again he had proved them all wrong. I put my wand back on the table and held my arms open for him.
. I don't know what happened, but my legs turned shaky and weak, and my eyes drooped shut as I couldn't keep myself standing, fainting into something warm and soft.
He made a fair point. Muggle-borns as a whole didn't really bother him. They were wizards, like everyone else, so he liked the nice ones and had a problem with the assholes. He didn't have a sour view of impure blood or any of "that crap" because just having magic made your blood a high quality. Muggle-borns could mess with blood magicks for a reason. He just didn't like how they handled wizarding culture. The Ministry of Magic kept making changes to compensate for their traditions and beliefs to be accepted, but most muggle-borns didn't bother reciprocating. They learned magic, got their education and go back to the muggle world like it wasn't worth it.
She reached for the top button of her cream blouse, seductively undoing it before, slowly moving on to the next one. I shook my head at her again, and she stopped in confusion. This was going to be tough. I invited her to sit beside me, and she did so quickly. Clearly, she was baffled and thought I wanted her obedience or some other kinky shit. Her hands felt warm in mine as I shuffled to face her, and she copied my action meekly.
Harry couldn't form a proper answer, just a whimper before he put their lips together again, and started unbuttoning and removing his shirt. After a lot of fumbling and rolling on the carpet, Harry was laying over his unlikely lover, making them a pile of nudity and moans. Harry shuffled down Draco's body, kissing as he went until he placed a wet kiss on the tip of his erection. Ginny came into his mind, reminding him how hurt she'd be if he kept going, no matter how much he wanted to right now.
He pushed his robes off his shoulders and slowly started to undo his buttons. Harry’s eyes couldn’t help but follow Draco’s hands down his torso, biting his lip and groaning at Draco seductive smile. Soon enough, Draco opened his shirt, showing off his muscled body. He reached out to Harry, who stood up mesmerised, and Draco moved Harry’s hand to brush over his body.
Hagrid opened the big double doors, and the eighth years filtered through, feeling the gaze of the entire school on them as they walked. Harry stood by his friends, and Neville Longbottom came to stand with them, nervous but steady. Professor McGonagall explain to the school why the eighth years were there, and that to mark the new year, they’d resort the students.
“First up, Gregory Goyle.” Hagrid summoned.
Snape stepped aside to let me in and directed me to sit at his desk. I sat down steadily, but my hands still shook as I faced my Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Snape explained that he’d noticed I wasn’t as focused in class. I panicked and started to babble, saying that I was sorry for staring, but that I haven’t been able to stop it since my fourth year.
Her eyes showed she thought I was being sly about liking Gemini. I tried to reason with her that I obviously wasn't talking about myself, but without dropping Neville in line of fire, I couldn't fully convince her. It was frustrating she wouldn't listen, but there wasn't much else for me to say. She wouldn't believe I wasn't interested in Gemini like that, the thought hadn't even crossed my mind.
I stood there in shock as Harry screamed in pain, and I just didn’t know what to do. Professor Snape rushed to his son’s side, just as Harry passed out. Everyone in the classroom gaped, and Snape yelled at them all to leave but stopped me when I tried. I insisted I had nothing to do with it, and that Harry had been ignoring me all day, so I couldn’t have done anything.
Harry shrugged, “I guess I forgot I wasn’t just like everyone else.”
They laughed, holding each other close, with the hope of never having to let go. Never.
Dread overcame Harry as he watched realisation dawn on his cousin's faces, and he backed away in fear. But they were faster, like crocodiles, snapping him up in their jaws immediately. Dudley was tearing at the frock coat and ripping the buttons of the waistcoat. Pheobe had ripped the gold off in strips and was taking some of the red underneath with it. Tears were already falling and Harry couldn't bring himself to look down as they stepped away.
Wide eyes shot to the side, watching the fuzzy-haired maid lead a young man towards him. His hair was messier, and his green eyes glowed in nervous anticipation, but there was no mistaking it was his beautiful Harry. The omega smiles slightly and the last of the tension released from his body. He couldn't stop his actions, taking the ring from a guard and running to meet Harry in the middle. He manages to just hold onto enough control to keep up formalities. Harry raised his hand so Draco could slide the ring into place with a smile.
The prince chuckled, conceding to his love that he could bring anything with him, all Draco cared about was him. Harry dug under his clothes, lifting the lion pendant from under his clothes and placing it gently over Draco's neck. The prince jumps up to kiss Harry's wrists, hearing the other boy giggle, the sweetest sound he'd ever heard. They become aware of the surroundings by a sob, seeing his omega friend crying into her alpha's shoulder, as he smiled at them like a proud father. It also made Harry aware of his relatives.
The days passed in a haze of my mundane lessons and my enlightening conversations with Gemini. But even the latter wasn't enough to distract me from wanting to be in the fateful extracurricular lesson. If anything, talking to Gemini was confusing me even more. I didn't know if I liked the Slytherin in a romantic way, or if that was even something Gemini might be okay with. The lesson would provide me with the means to talk about it with him, without it seeming obvious or weird. And I was getting impatient waiting for it. Me and Neville both.
Harry had been petting the bird while the man was talking, feeling more and more like this was
“I love you, too.  So much.”  He leant in for another kiss.  “Do you think you’d ever take me to this class?  I’d like to make you something, too.”
Receiving what he supposed was a scathing look from the creature, he decided it best to keep quiet on the situation.
“Very well.  I will contact the ministry and the Knight Bus to see if anyone else saw anything,” Professor McGonagall said.
He was awoken sometime later by a warm mouth nuzzling his jaw.  He blearily opened his eyes and saw a tuft of blond.  Draco realized that he had woken Harry, and so looked up at him, smiling.  “Have a good nap?”
Draco could hear Harry say to the bird, “Sorry to wake you, mate, but I need you to take this letter to Mr Ollivander at Diagon Alley.”
“What in the name of Merlin are you doing?”
Harry took a deep breath and closed his eyes, before saying, “Because I realised something a couple of months ago.  When I started planning this party, I realised… I wanted to throw you this party, not because we’re friends, but because I… I…”  He lifted his head, opened his eyes, and got lost in the grey ones that were boring into his.
“I love you, too.  Thank you for my gift.”
“I… I’m embarrassed.  I survived a war.  I
“Hmmm, okay, fine.  But, if you’re so tired, maybe you should go home.”
Years’—who comes up with these terms?” Ron mused.
“I—I don’t know.  Maybe?  Like I said, I’ve gotten to really know him the past few months.  He’s…I don’t even know how to describe it.  I know it’s crazy, and way too fast, but I’ve never felt like this before.”
Draco wasn’t convinced, but allowed himself to be pulled along, as Harry made his way towards the shop.
Harry sat at his desk on the Tuesday before Christmas, which was on Saturday, counting down the minutes until it was time to go home.  He was entirely ready for a holiday, and he only had two more days.
Draco kicked off his shoes, and lay down on the bed, patting the space beside him, beckoning to Harry.  Harry slipped his shoes off too and crawled up the bed.  He lay his head on Draco’s chest, wrapping his arm around him.  Draco slid his fingers through Harry’s hair, sighing in contentment.
You could not have done anything any sooner than what occurred.  Do I make myself clear?”
-----
Harry put his wand down on the desk, and put the feather on top of his book.  Feeling a little foolish, he concentrated and flicked his hand as if he was holding his wand and mentally said
He stepped out and was instantly greeted by a grinning Pansy—which he never took as a good sign—and cringed to himself;
“Works for me.  What kind of cuisine are you hungry for?  There is nearly every type of European food available.”
Anyway, as always, thanks for reading!  And I hope beyond hope that it won't be 4 months before the next one is published!  **Crosses fingers and toes**
“Well, you two were spending a lot of time together, working.  I was sure something was going to come of it.  I just thought it had happened much sooner than it apparently had.”
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Whatever you say.  But, what plan?  They are going to come over, we will give them a tour of the house and show them our magnificent work, and then we will eat.  I am afraid that I don’t think this will be done in time, though, so we will have to go get takeaway or something.”
If Harry was being honest, he was amazed that they hadn’t been bombarded by the press as soon as they stepped into the atrium.  Taking the chance to glance around the room, however, made him note that there didn’t seem to be a single reporter or camera person lingering around.  His brows furrowed as he looked over at McGonagall.
“What?”
“Mother has mentioned a few times this autumn about contacting her, but she just didn’t know how to go about doing so.”
They had been flirting back and forth for months—years, really.  They bickered and poked fun at each other, and their relationship was steadily moving onward.  Draco was definitely one of his best friends, but Harry still wanted more.
The next morning, they were awoken by a squeal and a punch in the gut for both of them as Teddy took a flying leap and landed across both of their torsos.
Harry realized what was going on, and stepped up to wrap his arm around Draco’s waist.
Harry slid in beside Teddy, so they were all on the same side of the table, and wrapped his arm around him.  “Oh, Ted, of course we’re going to miss you.”  He looked over at Draco above Teddy’s head, and gave him a questioning look.
Nodding, Draco said, “I’ll ask her when I get home.”  They continued walking, but then Draco suddenly stopped, his mind catching up with what Harry had said.  “You…you talked to my Aunt Andromeda?”
“Uncle Ron! Gramma said you need to pass these around to ‘hold off the day-loop that she knows is coming, as supper has been pushed back a few minutes.’”
“Sorry, mate.  Give me just a second, and I will have a reply for you.”
Draco spat into the sink and rinsed his mouth out before turning to lean against the counter.  He sighed as he crossed his arms.  “He asked me if you were doing better.”
Harry collapsed on the bed, sobbing quietly to himself.
“You know it will be.  They won’t come up with anything original, like ‘Poster Boy Potter to wed Mega Sexy Malfoy’ or ‘Golden Boy engaged to Snake King.’”
Harry leant back in and kissed him gently again, before nodding at him to go sit down.  “Breakfast is almost ready.”
“I swear, if you do not get on with it, I will get dressed and leave.”
“Merlin, you’re beautiful,” Harry hummed against Draco’s skin.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you lot doing here?”
Draco laughed as they continued on down the street.  “You're right, you do have it far worse.  My poor fiancé!”
Draco turned even redder as Harry shuffled forward and lifted his legs so that he could see Draco’s hole and the large black plug that was snugly fit in it.  He groaned loudly as Harry flopped onto his stomach, face resting inches from Draco’s hole.
“Yeah, but I don't want to put you out—”
For once, he didn’t pick a fight, and let Harry carry him up the stairs without a fuss.  They stepped into his room, which Harry had been adamant had to happen when they were remodeling, and helped in change into pyjamas.  He used the loo, and then crawled into his bed, tugging the stuffed dog that he kept at Grimmauld under the blanket with him.
Harry grabbed both of his hands this time, and carefully walked him down the street.
“Oh, are you two staying, too?” Hannah asked as she saw them walk in.
“Draco? What’s wrong?”
“Harry, are you feeling okay?”  Hermione walked in between the two men, looking at Harry.
He pressed a kiss to her cheek, and then led her over to the sofa, sitting down beside Charlie and striking up a conversation.
This time it was Narcissa that spoke.  “You felt the intense heat, again?”
“Are you changing your mind?  Do you not want to do this?”  Toss.
“Why don’t we… you know… just stay in bed all day, then?  It’s been a long time since we’ve done that.”
“Yeah, let's go.”
Harry pulled him into a hug.  “You’re welcome.  For all of it.”  He sighed, pulling back, but keeping his hands on Draco’s arms.  “We all know what he’s like.  I’m just sorry you had to deal with it.”
“Harry?”
“Hi. Your present is finished. Would you like to see it?”
He leant in for a heated kiss.
Harry gripped Draco’s hips, helping lift him up and down.  He slid one hand up Draco’s torso, tweaking one of his nipples.  Draco moaned at the feeling, causing his still half-hard cock to fill completely.
“Yes, Kreacher cleaned up after me.”
“Please, help yourself,” Kingsley said, taking a sandwich from the platter.
“I just do.  We have all been through so much in the past few years.  I just want the fighting and animosity to stop.”
“Let’s not worry about it.  We’re going to tell everyone on Saturday, and then we can really start planning.”
came back.”  Without thinking, he reached out and grasped Draco’s ankle.  “While Hermione apparated your mother here, Ron fire-called Blaise, who, in turn, called Pansy.  Millie was with her, so they immediately came back.  Neville, Hannah, and Ernie were still here, but as soon as Hermione went and told them what had happened, Hannah sent owls to Justin, Susan, and Michael.  They were all back within thirty minutes.  I don't know who told Seamus and Dean, but they peeked in a while ago.  Everyone is holding vigil in the common room, last I heard.”
“What?”
“Thank you, mother, father.  It means the world to me—to us—that you were both here.”
“Congratulations!  I had no idea!  I’m happy for you, my boy!”
“What about me?” Harry grinned down at Draco.
“You’re always hungry, mate,” Harry said with a smile.  “I’ll be right back.”
“Too early,” Harry said as he turned over and blearily looked at Teddy.  “Are your nan and auntie awake, too?”
wanted to have it, and how they could convince Narcissa to do things their way.  They spoke of the guest list, and how they pictured the reception.
Harry wondered what the elf would do while he was away at school, and asked as much.
They looked at each other, but chose to ignore it for the moment, rearranging the furniture in the room to make way for the tree.  Finally deciding on the perfect spot, Harry pulled the shrunken tree out of his pocket and set it in the middle of the floor.
Justin, Dean, Seamus, and Blaise were helping Professor Flitwick finish part of the Charms corridor, as well as a bit of Ravenclaw Tower.
“Nonsense, Harry.  It will be fabulous no matter what it looks like. And besides, isn't Draco helping?” Hermione gave him a pointed look.
Draco rolled his eyes as he tugged him into the fireplace and tossed the powder.  “The Burrow!”
Harry looked around.  Not much had really changed in the short 5 years since they had graduated, but it still felt completely different.
“You know neither of us will get any sleep,” Harry groused.
, he thought to himself.  Putting his trunk into his pocket, he heard the familiar sound of the floo flare, and then a hesitant “P-Potter?”
“Shouldn’t be a problem at all.  When you pick it up, I will teach you the spell that will activate the magic, so when you get it in place, it will work.  He will then talk, and be able to move about the painting as well as others.  Does all of this make sense?”
“Okay, so you have plenty of diapers.  His food and things are in here, as well as the potion for his teething.  Just put about four drops in the bottle that you give him before bedtime.  He can’t sleep without his lion, so that is there, too.  I think that’s everything.  I hope that’s everything.”
” Draco said, because Potter’s stupid prejudice against snakes as much as his speaking in English was irritating him. “
Scorpius gave a deep sigh, the way he usually did when he was asked to do something that didn’t involve snakes, and trotted off down the corridor that led to his room on the ground floor of the family wing in the Manor. Draco, meanwhile, turned in the chair he had modeled after a Muggle swivel one—a conjured serpent of wood and steel joined the seat to the foot—and stared down at the letter on the table.
Malfoy’s arms were laden with baskets, and his pockets bulged. A small line of packages floated behind him as well. Harry wondered idly how many people in the Alley had noticed the subtle protective spells shimmering around the packages that kept them from being touched or bumped or tampered with. Harry himself had probably only noticed because he cast such spells on his own shopping all the time.
Then it unfolded into the Gryffindor snake that Harry had seen in James’s room. She shot her tongue towards him, and wriggled her whole body like a puppy begging for a treat. “
reporters. They would have to get the news secondhand.
“No. You’ve been mostly polite, and it sounds like you’re a good, kind teacher to James and so are the other people who are educating them. That’s all I can ask for.”
Harry looked her, rather than the snake, in the eye. “No.”
Harry thought, but kept silent on that, too. Malfoy had made it
Ron laughed. “The best. We caught a dragon egg smuggler, and then it turned out she was linked to several unicorn deaths…”
“And you
“I can’t imagine what you think you have to hide now.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Potter said quietly. “As long as James gets what he needs.”
From the sound of James’s words, Harry was sure that he was quoting verbatim. He obviously hadn’t understood everything the girl had, but enough to be bewildered and hurt.
Hermione touched Sapphire behind the head and made a soft noise. Ron leaned towards Harry and muttered, “That snake looks venomous.”
Malfoy hissed a sharp word that streaked past Harry’s ears like a bolt of lightning, and then the ritual room lit. The torches on the walls flickered with uneasy blue-white brilliance, like lightning itself, and the circle on the floor
who had concocted a series of breathless articles about Harry and Ginny’s divorce. Her eyes darted back and forth as if expecting to find Jamie hiding in a corner. “When can we interview him?”
“It is, but I can’t get rid of it, and I’m not going to teach my son to be ashamed of his potential.”
, isn’t he?” Ginny put her hands on her hips. “Someone who’s not horrified by Parseltongue. Someone who
He got nods from Pansy and Greg and an excited hop from Scorpius, but his son settled down when Charlie lifted his head and put it on Scorpius’s hip. James nodded and clapped, and then settled back himself.
And Harry wasn’t in the mood to translate her contribution to the conversation. He shrugged at Ron. “I don’t think me trying to ignore that I’m a Parselmouth has done James much good. He needs to learn how to control it, because he’s already performing accidental magic with it. The last thing I want is for him to hurt someone with it.”
snake. “He is a beauty. Can I touch him?”
Draco swallowed against the impulse to roar at Potter. The blankness and repetition were designed to do that, he knew. Then Potter would have the satisfaction of knowing that he was in the “right.”
“Oh, please,” Parkinson said, her voice heavy with contempt. “As if I would tax my dear Isabella by using a Transfiguration on you.”
“We are here,” Malfoy began with a peculiar cadence Harry was instantly certain had something to do with the ritual, “to call a snake for James Sirius Potter. To find his Match if we can; to find a good snake for him to practice magic with if we cannot. He wishes to be a true Parselmouth, to stand among the Order. I chose you as the ones whose magic aligns most closely with mine.” He turned his head, and his eyes seared into Harry’s, even though Harry thought he should have been looking at James. “Harry Potter is here to lend his family magic to the calling circle and make things more familiar for his son.”
“James needs the comfort and the discipline of Parseltongue.”
Hell, James had only learned it himself a few months ago, or at least enough to understand what it really meant when Harry asked him to say that he was sorry for something.
“Have you been to another Mind-Healer since?”
Harry wrapped his arms around James’s shoulders, and hoped he would always be able to.
“I’m not—” Potter closed his eyes and clenched down on what seemed to be his emotions, or maybe just his tongue. Sela hissed softly at him, the kind of soothing nonsense noise that Draco heard often from Charlie when Scorpius was going to sleep. Potter didn’t respond to her, but opened his eyes a second later and said, “I’m not frightened. I just think that I’ve taken enough of your time.”
“You say
” In truth, he didn’t think there was much change since Sela had started helping him, except that he dreamed of Voldemort less. But he would take that.
“Mr. Malfoy? What’s going on?”
“Daddy!”
Harry echoed warily. That sounded like some sort of mating, and he was not about have a snake lay eggs in their house.
” Even as he spoke, he knew there
,” James chimed in.
“It means that you and Draco have magic much closer to each other than most Parselmouths do. I don’t think he’s realized it yet. He’s probably still thinking about other things than the ritual, like the daily business of the school. Just like some Parselmouths Match with snakes and others bond with them, some Parselmouths Match with each other. We’re seeing that now that we’re asking Parselmouths in countries where they were never so scorned.”
The calling circle certainly wasn’t a traditional one, Draco had to admit.
Sela squeezed his arm where she was loosely looped. Harry took a deep breath and slowly released his anger. Sela was right. He had to hold back, because his anger might frighten his son.
“We shall have a circle that will make sure we are not unbalanced,” Malfoy said simply.
“Potter.”
“I don’t want you to take Sela.” Harry said it with dry lips that he licked, hard. He wondered abstractly if he looked like a snake, too, darting his tongue out.
He had to admit, he’d sent the letter he had only because he wasn’t about to leave such a prominent Parselmouth out of his community-building project. But he’d never expected Potter to actually respond.
Harry controlled the urge to laugh hysterically by clutching his basket. The handle creaked, but it didn’t break. And if it had, then he could have cast a
“They weren’t starving. He bought one of them a new racing broom with that money.”
“I find that I can use the right spells when I need them.”
Harry’s eyes flew open. He
As he put James back to bed, James whispered, “Can the snake come and visit tomorrow, Daddy?”
on it.
He had brought in Greg and Pansy because their magic was of the sort that would balance the circle. Greg, as one of the few Parselmouths who had a constrictor instead of a venomous snake as a Match, would provide the gentle intent of this ritual. Pansy would add the womanly energy that would somewhat substitute for James’s missing mother. Scorpius would be there because he was friendly to James and near the same age. Draco, as leader of the ritual, would do the actual Calling.
And Draco hadn’t paid attention to the articles about Potter since then. He’d immersed himself fully in the campaign to make Parselmouths more acceptable.
“I never intend to follow the same path that the Dark Lord did. How many times do I need to tell you that?”
Astoria, ever since I heard about other people passing Parseltongue to their children and realized what would probably happen when I had a child. Why did you marry me if you disliked it so much?”
Harry winced a little, but nodded. “I know.”
He started to say something else, but Potter abruptly moved like a whirlwind, turning and ducking so that he was crouching over James, Scorpius, and their snakes. Draco started fowards, and found himself encased in a translucent shield. Stunned, he stood still and stared around as Edwina reared, hissing, on his shoulder, and only then realized that there was a hole in the cobblestones at his feet, and people were screaming and scattering.
“And you should know,” Draco said, switching back to English, too, because he wanted to drive home the point, “that training for most Parselmouths and their children is free because I want to get this system off the ground and I want to see them embrace their gifts. That won’t be the case with you. I’m going to charge you all the Galleons I can get away with.”
There was a sharp indrawing of breath from some of the reporters, and Temperance looked as if she was about to ask a question. But Harry kept his gaze locked on Keller, and he spoke first. “Do other nations on the Continent have as many?”
James shifted so his head rested on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry received a sudden, intense memory of the way he had done that when he was a baby and full and sleepy. Such
was publicly available. Harry couldn’t be angry at someone for looking at it.
Malfoy.” Potter’s voice hissed, but not in the good way. He turned his gaze on Draco, and Draco tensed. Edwina, coiled around his shoulders, at once lifted her head and flared her hood. “And you, a cobra, because of course you do. I wouldn’t have answered the letter if I’d known.”
The snake twisted her neck in James’s direction. “
On evenings like this, when James had been full all day of tears and wails and unreasonable fixations on Muggle cartoons on the telly that he wanted to watch thirty hours of, Harry sat beside his cot and smoothed his sleeping son’s back and thought about the unforgivable thing he had said to his wife.
Harry shivered. Yeah, that was
But from the haunted way Jamie stared up at him now, Harry was cursing himself for waiting so long. He knelt next to Jamie beside the front door and ran his hand gently through his son’s hair.
” He cast a helpless glance around at the maze of sapphire-colored shelving and the random cubbyholes and nooks that were as likely to hold ancient scrolls as rolled-up newspapers. “I don’t know where to start.”
“Oh, I think it might be an attraction,” Potter said calmly. He was keeping one eye on James as he turned his head, and Draco wondered if he even realized that his hand was on his wand anymore. “But the kinds of people who would come because I was there wouldn’t be serious parents or students. They would just want to gawp. And that would disturb James’s education. And the education of the others at the school, of course,” he added, as if thinking about it in more detail.
Draco just stared at him, and then turned and spoke directly to Sela. “
Hermione sighed when Ron was out of sight. “He wants to discuss the Parselmouth school that you’re enrolling James in with you.”
” said Scorpius.
embrace your Parseltongue. Your snake, wherever she is. Do you understand how powerfully we can cast together if you do this?”
? Do you really think I’m going to go off and hurt other people the way he did?”
Memories of Ron and Hermione leaped to mind, but they were all from years ago. They hadn’t interfered in his divorce from Ginny, but they had accepted what Harry had said about it, and that he blamed himself. They had offered comfort and babysitting for James and to stay with him, but—
“I do know it,” Draco said, leaning in a little, making Potter stare at him, and not trying to touch him even though his hand trembled with the longing to do so. Edwina looped herself around his neck and watched. “But I’m not trying to prove myself. I’m trying to offer you help if you need it.”
, and that his whole life he’ll be speaking the filthy language that Tom Riddle whispered in my ear when I was eleven…”
“A lot of spells could do that, Dark Arts or not,” Harry said blandly. “The Lye Soap Hex could do that, if you put enough power behind it.”
Draco shook his head. He supposed he shouldn’t have expected to get so quickly through walls thick enough to have withstood years of betrayal, but he was still…well. Frustrated.
Harry rolled his eyes. He supposed that he’d spoken too soon about her lack of demands.
Draco caught his breath with irritation, then reminded himself that showing it was another way to confirm Potter in his belief that he was “right” and drive him further away. “Did something happen?”
Harry nodded. Ginny had rejoined the team after they got divorced, and she was succeeding brilliantly, from the little news that he’d heard. “Well, good for her. Is there some other reason you didn’t want to tell me?” he added, because he knew Hermione, and her face was too red now.
“The option isn’t on the table, so I’m not worried about that.”
Ron’s stare grew more penetrating, and he glanced once at Hermione, who was still cooing over Sapphire and James, then turned back to Harry. “I
“The nightmares you never got Mind-Healing for,” Harry snapped. He’d admired Ginny for that after the war, that she seemed so strong she had moved on and put her past trauma behind her. But now she was doing something unforgivable in his eyes. “You’re walking away from being a mother to your
“Sometimes,” Ginny said, “a woman needs to heal on her own.”
“Of course.” For a second, Potter’s eyes flickered with what might have been wary confusion.
,” Draco said, with glances to everyone else.
“Daddy.”
Harry arched an eyebrow, remembering a frantic young woman who had advocated for throwing him to Voldemort. “Fancy

“Because I’m an evil Dark wizard, Malfoy, haven’t you heard? Going after him would have made me look
Harry just shook his head and looked at Parkinson. “I appreciate you bringing her here, but I won’t bond with her.”
silently.
But then, would he have agreed to take the snake away instead of arguing to try and make Harry accept her?
James tugged hard against his father’s hand, and Potter walked slowly with him over to Scorpius and Charlie, although Draco saw the way he still tensed when his son reached out to pet Charlie’s head. Charlie, the goofiest boomslang Draco had ever met, snuggled his head into James’s palm. “
James swallowed and switched to Parseltongue, always a sign that he was feeling too upset to continue after he’d been talking in English for a while. “
Charm. He settled back against the pillows and listened for the sound of James stirring, but everything was quiet. Apparently he hadn’t been screaming aloud.
Harry shuddered.
“I don’t know what my final answer is going to be,” he decided on. “I think ritual magic could offer me a chance to protect James, but it seems intense.”
“Why should I? He disgraces not just you but all Parselmouths with that kind of bollocks.”
“Of course.” Harry shrugged. “But from tragedy can come a blessing, don’t you think? That’s certainly true enough in my own life.”
Draco stared at her. Then he said, in a wonder that felt as if it had hollowed him out, “You don’t trust me.”
,” Harry said, and noticed that a few people turned around to stare at him, but didn’t scream or gasp. He hoped that the articles had done that much good, then. Parseltongue was James’s native language, like it or not, and Harry wanted him to be able to speak it in public without a fearful reaction from the mob.

Harry bloody Potter.
Harry stood back with his hands in his robe pockets and watched Ginny throw robes and books and hairbrushes and Quidditch equipment haphazardly into her trunk. He knew he should speak up, say something, convince her not to leave him. If nothing else, she had a duty to James.
“You didn’t remove it.”
Voldemort hissed back, his eyes bright with glee as he held out his wand towards the snakes. “
Ginny’s eyes widened, and the tears that had been threatening spilled down her face. Harry slammed to a halt, staring at her. Since her first year, he couldn’t
“All right.”
Harry laughed, and watched both the reporters and Malfoy jump at the sound, which was a source of some satisfaction. “That’s a Muggle concept that demands the government

her flesh!”
Harry shook his head, his mind turning back to the image of Ginny buried under snakes. That had happened, hadn’t it? But only indirectly because of Voldemort. “
James picked up the snake and cradled it in his hands, then announced, “
