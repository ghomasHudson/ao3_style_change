“Actually I’m seeing him in about two hours, so I can catch him up, but you should talk to Draco as soon as possible, and maybe apologize.”
“Good. Follow me, please.” She turned back the way she had come, Draco stood swiftly and followed her, watching the tight bun she had pulled her hair into at the back of her head move up and down as she walked. The hallway wasn’t very long, but they passed a significant amount of rooms which Draco assumed were offices before they turned left into Room 1031. Ms. McGonagall stepped behind her desk and sat down, motioning for Draco to settle into the seat opposite from her. Draco noticed a jar of cookies and a small stuffed dragon that disrupted the organized desk in front of him. She saw him looking around and said, “Mr. Malfoy, would you like a cookie?”
Undergraduate Administrations
Ron checked his phone after depositing the two boxes he was carrying onto the floor near Draco’s unmade bed. The long string of messages filled him up with right-ness and warmth. He smiled as he read them, sitting on the couch in the common area of the dorm.
“Cool,” Draco said, distractedly, glancing down at his laptop, “what show are you watching?”
“You know what I mean.”
“What?....oh. ok. Thanks Mr. Dobby. I’m awake now,” Draco mumbling, moving into a more comfortable sitting-up position. The butler left the room quietly, trusting Draco to be able to rouse himself and do the things he needed to prepare for his meeting.
“Yeah, definitely,” Harry said, and then looked like he was going to say something else, but was interrupted by Hermione telling the room that fifteen minutes were up and it was time to get down to business once more. Harry and Draco shared another amused smile and turn to their respective studying.
Ron grinned, “I will!” and then stepped into his room. He chose not to close the door fully so that if Draco wanted to come in, he could feel welcome to. Ron toed off his shoes before climbing into bed, disrupting the mess of blankets and pillows, left untidied in the morning. He set the backpack against the wall and pulled out his laptop and headphones, so he could watch things without distracting Draco. It really was an amusing show and he laughed out loud a few times over the next two hours, pausing only to grab a snack and something to drink.
To distract himself, Draco picked through the letters and postcards Mr. Dobby had brought for him. There wasn’t much other than bills and useless advertisements. The messages of condolences and goodwill that Draco had been drowning in without mercy from people who knew his parents stopped coming after the year anniversary of their death had passed which Draco was grateful for. The unimportant deliveries more like a breath of fresh air than anything.
“We ended it when we realized we were basically just friends who kissed a lot and fooled around a little. We went to prom together as friends which was nice - you know that though, we talked about that earlier, right? Harry was worried we’d not get along afterwards, but really nothing changed at all.”
Hermione's eyes turned warm when she looked at him and answered, “It’d be nice and we can all get to know each other better, just like we are now. Unless you don’t want to, we obviously don’t want to drag you to anything you don’t wanna go to, but you’re new and you’re Ron’s roommate and we like you so far, so don’t worry okay?”
“Do you think there’s another Disney movie this silly but also so full of dead people and murder?” Hermione wondered towards the end of the movie and Ron picked up his phone and did some googling. While Harry and Blaise speculated with her.
“Hey, you’re one of Theo’s friends right?” Theo’s friend asked Draco. Draco just shook his head no. “Oh, I thought you looked familiar and I was going to invite you to sit with us, but ...yeah... Sorry about that.”
“We gotta decide on a movie to start with, Krum and Cedric will be over soon.”
The two of them smiled at eat other, Ron pushed the almost empty ice cream carton towards Draco, saying “You should finish it. Also, side note, I’ve been trying to persuade people to stop using the word guys when they’re talking about a group of people who might not be men. Because gendered language and all that, I read an article about it over the summer. I’ve been slacking a bit on it recently, but I think it’s important.”
“Better. I mean I still have a shit-ton of stuff to study for and all, but the last hour or so has been helpful. I think this was a good idea.”
During the next break, Draco made his way over to where Blaise was sitting. The man in question was thumbing unhurriedly at his phone and looked up when Draco came up to him
In the first month of classes, Harry spent a lot of his time with Draco. Their shared class was held twice a week and they usually had lunch together once it was over. Often times, Harry’s (and now Draco’s) friends would join them - Mostly Blaise, but other others came in and out depending on their schedules. Harry, surprisingly having figured out how to manage procrastination once in university, helped Draco get in the groove of doing school work on a regular and normal basis, by securing a few hours here and there every few days or so for them to spend in the library. Sometimes they would get a study room on the quiet floors so that they could talk to each other and muddle through homework together, and other times they got big tables on the second floor of the library that was notably not quiet at all, and a few of their friends would join them. On top of all that, Harry was frequently spending time with Ron when he wasn’t doing school or RA related duties, and could often be found lounging in bed with him or in their common area. Draco usually would not join Ron and Harry when they were in Ron’s room, but he would happily sit with them as they watched movies or played board games or whatever in the open space. Harry thought it might be nice for Draco to join in his and Ron’s cuddle-times, but he knew it was too soon to invite him along and just had to hold onto the hope that one day they would be close enough friends that he could.
“I know, I’ve done this before, it’s just been a while.”
As he said this, Blaise nodded along. “Definitely,” he said, “let’s keep this break though, and then once it’s over, we can head over to the study room Cedric stole the table from. It’ll be quiet and we won’t bother anyone working through all those questions.” He gave Draco a strange, pleased look, before adding as an afterthought, “I’ll bring a book we can lean on since there won’t be a table.”
.” there she gave him a tiny smirk, so he knew she was only throwing that word back at him out of love.
The conversation picked up from there, and Draco participated, feeling small waves of friendliness and acceptance wash over him in the time that passed, unpacked dorm items forgotten. He learned a lot about his roommate and his two friends: the things they had done over the summer, what the previous two semesters had been like for them, what they were studying. It was mildly surprising to Draco that they showed interest in what he said so soon after meeting him. In the past, it seemed like people had to warm up to him in a way before they seemed interested in him as more than just a classmate. Having a roommate like Theo, who he had barely associated with probably had something to do with it, because there wasn’t a group of friends he could insert himself into, like there was this time.

[Scarface 1:28] k
“You know I…” Draco began to say and then thought better of it, “never mind.”
“You’re only a year older than them!”
and I don’t know, I’m sure there’s some stuff going on with how I feel about my parents, but I haven’t worked that out yet, I’m not even sure how, really. I’m just… I don’t know... But mostly I think I just wanted to feel like I was doing something again and Mr. Dobby agreed with me and then I went to see Ms. McGonagall who’s an undergraduate administration counselor - she’s the one who sent me the letter - and yeah, I guess I was just ready to go back to school.”
“Reading David Brown again, ‘Mione? Lame.”
“Cool,” said Harry, “Ron just went to let Blaise in. Cedric and Krum will probably be here pretty soon as well. Do you have a movie preference? We’re having trouble figuring out what to start with.”
“Well I have to finish unpacking,” Draco spoke up, the corners of his mouth turning down a bit, “so I’m just going to head back to Prefect once I finish my coffee.”
“Yeah, sure it wasn’t a big deal. Someone staying in your bed doesn’t really affect me,”  he tried to say a teasingly. Ron sent him a little smirk before softening his face and informing him that it might be a common occurrence and Draco reassured him that he didn’t mind.
He decided to ignore the bags and suitcases in favor of comfort, but elected at the very least to make his bed and unpack a few things that would make everything a bit more comfortable and homey. So when Draco had finally settled in for the night, teeth brushed and body showered, in his bed with his computer a traveling mug full of decaffeinated herbal tea in reaching distance, it didn’t take long for him to sink into his sleepiness and drift away, half listening to the playlist he selected from his computer. Upon waking up, Draco found his computer dark and out of battery sitting precariously on the edge of the bed and the traveling mug half full of cold tea. He assumed the noise that woke him was Ron or Krum using the bathroom and groaned softly to himself when he saw what time it was. Draco slept in later than he meant to, which was strange considering how early he had fallen asleep. He made a mental note for himself to set an alarm for the next three days before class started so he could get in the habit of waking up at a normal time and not at 11 o’clock.
“That would be nice,” Draco answered, and wished to add something else, not wanting their conversation to stall, but his mind drew a blank. Ron looked like he was mulling something over, the space between his eyebrows up in concentration. Draco figured that he didn’t need to worry about the conversation being over as it was clear that Ron had more in mind to talk about. Draco couldn’t imagine what, but he waited patiently and rewarded himself with another mouthful of the now meltier than solid ice-cream.
“Certainly, sir,” was the reply, “Let me know when you are ready to begin.”
“It’s either Clara or Aidan about music stuff or Cedric about dorm stuff,” Ron supplied needlessly, though Draco was quietly grateful for it. They all nodded - Draco doing so because everyone else did.
“That is true, we are alone,” Draco mused aloud, and Blaise let out a small chuckle. Again there was silence in the room, and Draco let himself think through the offer again. He really did like kissing, and Blaise had been so kind. He didn’t want to let this opportunity pass by him, but he didn’t want to get mixed up in any drama or anything. “Platonic?”
The blonde one, most likely his roommate, nodded and said, “Yeah, if - if you want. I just got some more boxes and a suitcase. Oh, and I’m Draco by the way, Draco Malfoy.” Ron recognized the last name, from where he wasn’t sure.
“What are you doing for Fall break?”
“No, we were just discussing Harry’s caveman-like qualities,” Draco reassured her
“Yes, France is wonderful! I’ve been thinking of going to Amsterdam once I take a sabbatical, did you spend some time there?”
“I don’t mind at all, you know that.” Harry said lightly and then tried to make Ron giggle by asking, “You gonna try bondage or something?” jokingly, swaying a bit to the side so that their shoulders bumped up next to each other. Ron sighed and leaned into him.
“I missed you so much,” Ron’s words were breathy, but warm against Krum’s face, “I can’t keep my fucking hands off you. Ugh, we were kinda gross in front of everyone.” Ron’s freckled face flushed and Krum knew his ears were turning red at the tips. He moved his face so that he could kiss Ron again, pressed their lips firmly together and then pulled back so they could actually see each other.
, maybe just a bit of interest. But, yeah, no, I don’t mind, either,” Hermione said, thoughtfully, “I just wanted to get your take. I mean, even if we were together, I don’t think I’d care that much if Blaise kissed other people. They were really cute about it, Draco was all blushy and Blaise looked pleased with himself, I kind of wish I had seen it happen. I wonder what that conversation was like.”
Draco tilted his head so he could see the side of Ron’s face, “Oh, that’s interesting,” they both grinned.
Draco let himself sleep in Friday morning, having stayed up late reading the night before. He spread out on his bed when he woke up, drowsy and feeling soft, and looked up at the ceiling without really seeing it. He’d had a strange dream - not a bad one, but definitely not normal - involving a gigantic teapot, Harry’s green eyes blinking at him, and an impromptu flight amongst the stars that winked and giggled as he soared past them - and he tried to hold onto it, going over some of the details in his mind so he wouldn’t forget. He did not know what his dream was trying to tell him, but he felt sure it was more positive than anything else and wanted to commit it to memory. Eventually, he hoisted himself off his bed to grab at his backpack in order to put out a pen and his journal, rolling over onto his stomach so he could write easier and remain lying down. Draco tried to write out as much of the dream as he could but it sounded more poetic than he meant it to. He tried to sketch out some of it, and managed a bit of the teapot but it fell short of his imagination and he gave up, choosing instead to put it away.
“Hey,” Draco began sheepishly, “you said you did well with stat before, right? I was wondering if you could help me with some of the problems on my study guide. There are a few things I’m having some trouble with.”
I guess I just wanted to add a quick reminder that this is literally just self-indulgence. and that I'm a cis, white, queer woman so I don't know everything - but I have been consulting with my trans and nonbinary friends as well as doing research - if I write something that's not ok or offensive, it was an honest mistake that I would love to learn from, so please let me know. also - in the market for a beta, because I am definitely editing this on my own right now
Because both Draco and Pansy had an annoying Friday noon class, they planned to talk around lunch time so that they’d have time to talk through the afternoon without having to rearrange Friday night plans - which for Pansy involved illicit substances and dancing and beautiful people with too much money, and for Draco was more uncertain and probably contained some combination of his new group of friends or just his bed, some tea, and his computer.
“Pansy’s like that, she can always tell when something is going on.” He paused, thinking, before adding, “Being separated from her in Uni and in general last year, I kind of forgot what it was like to have people who actively noticed things going on with me.”
To the soft sounds of Ron’s sighs above him, Krum got his boyfriend off. Ending up with three fingers in his cunt and a thumb rubbing at his clit. Krum moved his fingers playfully, rubbing with intent against the walls of Ron’s vagina, taking his time to make sure Ron was open and ready for his cock, ensuring that there would be no pain in this interaction. Though Ron eventually had to a hand over his mouth to muffle any sounds he was making, so as not to bother their neighbor, his body responding enticingly to everything Krum did. It wasn’t until Ron came twice before he asked Krum to grab the condom and told him he was ready. Ron grinned at his boyfriend and shifted in the bed so that he was half sitting up once Krum grabbed the condom with his free hand. Ron brought a finger under Krum’s chin, moving his head so they could look at each other again. Krum let breathed out wetly against Ron’s hand, his eyes and face flushed with desire as he refocused. “Come on, Krumcake, get that cock inside me. Don’t wanna wait any longer.” It didn’t take long for Krum to do exactly what Ron wanted.
“Well, Harry and Ron grew up together - their families have been pretty close for a long time - Harry knows all of Ron’s siblings really well and they spend the holidays together sometimes.” Harry nodded enthusiastically at the mention, but didn’t bother to add anything, “I met them in high school, because I moved towns, and they were my first friends. Blaise and Luna, I think they might have known each other before last year, but I’m not really sure - they were already friends when we met them, which was through Parvati who’s my roommate.” Hermione shrugged and moved to fill her spoon up once more, “and Blaise and Luna knew Krum, which was how Ron met him.”
“Everyone seems really nice,” Draco responded, placing the dishes in the dish-rack and the utensils into the tub containing soap, water, and other silverware.
All these thoughts swirled aimlessly in Draco’s mind. It made it difficult for him to focus on what he was studying, but surprisingly it didn’t make him anxious. He felt good about what he had worked on so far, and the foundations that he had built for future studying. It was the kissing that created welcome disquiet in his mind, rather than school, and it was quite a freeing feeling.
Draco looked up to see Ron nod knowingly before informing them that Harry was on the way over from Ravenclaw Tower but Hermione would just meet them there because her dorm in Gryffindor Tower was really close to Madam Puddifoot’s coffee house. Upon hearing this new, the three of them rose from their seated positions and began the descent out of the building. Draco wondered if any of his new friends did anything without each other but was kind of glad for it. It would be easier for him to get to know them in groups rather than individually, if only for the fact that he wouldn’t have to worry so much about carrying a conversation without the support of other people. When they met Harry at the front edge of the courtyard outside the Prefect dormitory complex, he gave Ron an enthusiastic sideways hug and smiled brightly at the other two men. As they walked, Draco and Harry fell into step together, Ron and Krum trailing after them holding hands and talking quietly to each other about the next venue Krum and his band were going to perform at. Harry asked Draco if he had bought his textbooks yet and Draco stopped feeling so unsure of himself. Their conversation could be easy and safe, flutter around Draco in a comforting cloud which boosted his confidence.
Draco had been looking at Ms. McGonagall until he realized it was his turn to speak. His eyes looked down to trace the lines of the desk in front of him as he opened his mouth, “I – um – I guess I didn’t really have any questions,” he stammered before letting the words rush out of his mouth, “I just felt like I should come in and talk to someone before I re-enrolled here. I was worried the fax wasn’t enough. So I guess – I guess there isn’t much point to this meeting, seeing as I can just enroll in classes online. I’m sorry to have taken up your time,” Draco finished nervously, feeling awkward and out of place. He finally looked up from the desk and into Ms. McGonagall’s eyes, which were soft despite her hard appearance.
“I don’t know if simple is the right word of all of this,” Blaise poked at Cedric with the tip of his index finger, “this is a shit-ton of food, man.”
“Yeah, I just can’t believe school is starting again in three days. It’s so surreal.” Harry said quietly, strangely, as his fingers smoothed the bumps in the fabric. Hermione watched Draco’s eye track to the movement before letting out a sigh in agreement.
Smiling to himself, Draco set his phone aside and reached for his computer.
“‘Course not. They won’t mind at all,” he answered with a smile, wanting to reassure his roommate.
[to Hermy 6:07] sounds good
Krum looked up sharply as Ron came back into the room and his face must not have looked normal because Ron set his bathroom kit down hastily on his desk and climbed onto the bed. Ron moved into Krum’s space, took the pillow out of his hands and replaced it with his own. They sat facing each other for a moment before Krum rushed forward, pecked Ron on the lips, and leaned back against the wall to watch Ron’s reaction. Ron didn’t skip a beat. He unfolded his legs and crawled into Krum’s lap, pulling Krum forward so he could wrap his arms around his neck. Krum shifted so that Ron’s legs could wrap around his waist as well.
Fifteen minutes later, he was still sitting in the waiting room, struggling to balance picking classes, making a schedule, and the effort to feel motivated to do those things. Draco had sighed to himself more than once, each time, catching Harry’s attention away from his book. Finally, at the fourth noisy sigh, Harry called out to Draco from his desk, “Do you need some help?”
Draco placed his messenger bag in his lap and opened it in order extract his laptop and earphones to shuffle through his music as he scrolled mostly aimlessly through the internet. Placing his bag down on the floor in front of him a moment later, Draco slipped off his shoes and curled up on his couch, his computer secure on his stomach, warming his belly as it worked. Over the next hour, there was movement around him, his fellow Lounge loungers shifting in their seats with an occasional person stepping into or out of the room, but Draco was lost to them, so engrossed in his own endeavors that he almost forgot to check the time. Luckily, he managed to glance at the clock on his screen to realize that he only had ten minutes to get to his next class. He knew he didn't really need to worry that much, after all, it was syllabus week and it never took that long to get through the various buildings in Hogwarts - but that didn't stop Draco from unceremoniously untangling himself from the comfortable seat and scrambling to pull his things together. He made his way as quickly and quietly as possible out of the Lounge, nodded awkwardly to one of the students who looked up as he passed, and made his way out of the Common Room.
The next few days were a blur. The quiet campus became a loud, unforgiving wave of people as students returned from their holidays and parents helped them settle in. Harry had to come early, to start his RA duties and help the freshmen out during their Orientation week, so he was grateful that his friends had decided to join him. He was a bit surprised by how many people he knew moved back to school around the same time that he did. But it really was wonderful that he had people to hang out with in between showing the freshmen around and mentally preparing himself for school.
As Sirius answered him, Remus polished off the last of his pastry - his own was relatively untouched as he’d been the one talking more out of the two of them. After sharing a brief rundown of the three weeks Sirius spent in the Netherlands, not going into much detail, though there was plenty to share, he inquired Remus of what he hoped to spend time doing in Amsterdam. As he listened, he munched down his croissant as well, and nodding with interest.
“Yeah, that would be really nice, but I need to get changed and find my wallet… would you mind waiting?”
“Okay,” Ron said, more to himself than Draco, and then said in a confident easy way that kind of surprised Draco, “ I’m transgender and I’m a guy and I use he/him pronouns and Creevey wasn’t all that great to me when he found out. It wasn’t terrible, but I’d rather you know this about me now.”
“At least five times probably,” Hermione conceded and hid her red face behind her hands in mock defeat as Draco laughed again.
as him, and he wished that so deeply as well. He knew that showed on his face more than hers and that she would be able to see his longing for their physical closeness. “Stuff with your parents is hard, I’m not really sure how I would handle it if I was in your situation. But I think going back to school is a good thing for you, if only to assuage the
“Ok well, have a good day, I guess,” Theo’s friend said and then began walking away.
Mr. Dobby, when he noticed that Draco had not come down for breakfast like he had informed him he would, went to check on the young man and found him still asleep in an awkward position with his laptop open and dark, half on the Draco’s lap.
Hogwarts University is a small institution and we care very much about our students. We are informing you of this not to put pressure on you but to inform you of your position so that you can make informed decisions about the next few years of your life.
“You dated Hermione?” Draco asked grinning, slightly taken aback.
* * *
“You don’t have to wait for us, you know” Ron gestured to Hermione’s salad.
“I’m interested in history, not sure what concentration though. I haven’t declared anything yet, though, uh, I think I just want to give it time, you know.”
Harry laughed out loud at that, “I mean I have dated girls before but I’ve never… yeah, weird, I know, but I guess it’s the same kind of thing in a way, right? Like both of us are in a time of our lives where these things that are like socially expected of us to have done, but it’s okay that we haven’t yet.”
As Draco returned his printed syllabus to his bag and stood up, waiting for a few students to pass him so that he could also exit the room, he noticed Luna sitting at the back of the class. He watched as she stood up, tossed her long blonde hair over her shoulder as she took out her phone and started tapping at it. He waited as she walked up the rows of desks, head bowed toward her screen, before following her as she exited the room in order to say hi to her. Draco was a bit apprehensive to do so, as he had only met Luna once, but figured if he was going to be friends with this group of people, he would do it right.
Hermione and Ron who had each been paying attention but eating rather than talking, nodded enthusiastically at the invitation.
“That’d be nice,” Draco said softly in return, “We can talk about the space and all that stuff too, right?”
“Yeah, I started an essay outline for two of my classes, so I’m feeling pretty good. I don’t usually get that worried about this kind of stuff, but it’s nice to do it with everyone here…” Harry trailed off, and Draco nodded.
The woman who took their orders looked familiar to Draco with her bubblegum-pink hair and thrice pierced nose but he couldn’t figure out how. In the end, it was she who recognized him when he stepped up to place his order.
“Do you wanna tell me what’s been on your mind the past few days?” Ron asked, quietly. Draco nodded.
“I mean,” Draco tried, but did not know what to say, did not want to sound like an idiot with all the questions and reservations that were swirling around in his head, “I don’t know…”
maybe, or at least a nudge in a different direction. I mean, I kind of sat there and just realized how little I had done since my parents died and how unhappy I was. I mean I’m not sure if I’m happy now, but you know, the note kind of just helped me ask myself a question I’d been avoiding, you know?”
“I suppose you should head out then?”
it's been such a long time since I've updated, but I'm really excited to feel like i can move forward with this fic again!! (sorry for any mistakes - ill probably review it again at some point in the next few months to catch anything i missed)
The Common Room was a tall, beautiful building in the middle of campus. One side of the building - the one facing away from the school buildings and on-campus housing, and instead looking out at the forest and greenery off in the distance - was made completely of glass, displaying the large array of comfy couches and coffee tables within, along with computer labs and small office spaces throughout its three floors. Draco made his way through a set of glass doors and his nose greeted by the smell of fresh coffee and baked goods. He walked slowly through the first floor of the building until he got to a set of elevators. Stepping into the one that opened and spilled a few people out, he pressed a button for the third floor and waited, listening distractedly to the muffled sounds of the elevator mechanics working around him. Upon reaching his destination, Draco made his way to a sizable room labeled “The Lounge.” The Lounge was a cozy space with a fireplace that was almost always lit and full of soft, slightly worn couches which one could sink into comfortably. Draco had discovered the Lounge during his first semester at Hogwarts while looking through the Common Room for a place to sit away from the swarms of students. He had stumbled across it his fourth week into school and ended up spending a lot of time there. It was nice to find that the Lounge had not changed at all during Draco’s absence, and that in itself was surreal and slightly disorienting. It was blissfully quiet with only a few other students in the room, far enough away from each other that it wouldn’t be awkward for Draco to pick his favorite spot - the huge light grey loveseat by a window - and plop himself down, resituating himself in such a familiar place.
“Great! I’m Sirius, Sirius Black.”
“Then I definitely don’t want to miss it,” Draco said, grinning. Though he would have joined the study group anyway, even if Hermione hadn't had a plan. At the close of this particular conversation, Harry pulled out his phone, presumably to text Hermione with the good news. Draco allowed himself to marvel the adorableness of the person that was Harry, and smiled as his friend tapped enthusiastically at his phone. When they said their goodbyes later, Harry had promised to text him the details as soon as possible, and also wished him a good rest of the day.
“Yeah, true. So what else did you take your first semester?”
Harry grinned, “Sounds like something Luna would do, honestly, she’s her own kind of person.”
sorry for presuming we were on the same page. I’m glad you think I’m kissable though” Draco could tell he grinned out in his peripheral vision, “I did mean the question in a platonic way, just so you know. I thought I would ask you now since we’ve been getting along rather nicely and we’re alone.”
“We’re all taking different classes, I know, but we have a few that cross over,” Harry said, walking close enough to Draco that their shoulders brushed every once in a while, “and anyway, it’s always helpful, at least for me, to study when there are other people around me just as focused.”
“That was probably nice though, I mean you got to see different options and not take the bullshit filler classes. And I’m sure they covered some of your gen-eds anyway.”
“Cool, I’m Harry,” was all the man said, jumping up from his chair behind the desk and walking down a hallway and out of sight. Draco settled down in the armchair, gazing around the room at the different pamphlets and posters that decorated it, all advertising different things about the university. He picked up the school’s literary magazine from the previous year that was sitting on the coffee table near him and leafed through it, taking his time to look over the art and let unfamiliar words wash over him. As he did this, Harry returned to his post and resumed reading whatever he had hidden behind the desk.
Sirius sat in the front seat of Lily’s car, music and warm air blasting into the small space. He turned with an extra sharpness into a parking lot that Harry told him was free for university visitors feeling like he still needed to reacclimate to the vehicle despite having been driving it for several hours. He’d move it closer to Harry’s dorm once they’re ready to head out so Harry wouldn't have to drag his suitcase across campus, but at the moment, he had some time to kill and a university campus to tour at his own pace. Sirius parked the car carefully so as not to incur Lily’s wrath upon return, and climbed out of it, grabbing his phone and wallet from the center console. Tucking them into his pockets along with the keys once he turns the car off, he headed over to the campus map conveniently located next to the pathway leading out of the lot. Nothing caught his eye so he decided to meander without goal until something did.
“Yeah. Harry - the guy behind the desk - helped me out. I picked out five classes, but I might end up just taking four.”
“So,” Ron said slowly, looking at the spoon in his hand like it might hold the answer to what he was worried about. Draco tried not to let the word make him anxious, as it sat in the air heavily. But Ron looked up and met Draco’s eyes. He smiled lightly, a bit tightly, but Draco was comforted by it all the same. “I had some difficulty with my roommate last year and I want you to know. I know that we don’t actually live in the same room, but it’s probably still important.” Ron said, and then added, “Actually, maybe we should talk about past roommates! That way we can make sure things that were hard before are a bit easier.”
“Mostly anywhere I could get to by bike, um motorcycle I mean, or mo-ped if that’s what was available. I tried to spend at least two weeks in a given city, but some places I spent more time in than others - France especially.”
“That’s so exciting, I hope we get to say hello before you head off.” Hermione began nibbling at her own meal.
“Yes, that’s fine, I like them,” was the answer he got, so Blaise bit and sucked at Draco’s neck with relish, enjoying the soft sighs that he made. Draco clutched at Blaise in response, grasping at his friend and urging him to continue. Once he was sure Blaise had done good work on Draco’s neck, he pulled the man back up so to recapture his lips, returning to them with an enthusiastic and rather wet kiss.
Draco nodded, thinking that was fair. He thought back to Theo as a roommate and returned Ron’s soft expression, “My roommate my first semester wasn’t that bad. We had one of those 2 people per room, 4 people per suit dorm configurations. We just didn’t get along all that well, we didn’t say much to each other, and he was kind of messy. He would have his girlfriends or whoever over without giving me warning besides the classic sock on the door handle, which honestly could have been funny if it weren’t so annoying.” There wasn’t much to say other than that so Draco asked Ron worriedly, “What about you?”
“I didn’t realize you it wasn’t mutual,” Blaise reassured kindly, shaking his head, seemingly at his own assumptions. “I didn’t mean to be presumptuous, just forward, and open” and at that, he grinned slightly. Draco realized that Blaise was genuinely interested in him to some extent, at least to the extent that kissing was.
[from Hermy 6:18] I see you! Getting food and then I’ll come sit
Draco grabbed his stat study guide, a pencil, and his calculator and joined Blaise where he was waiting at the door. They walked quietly to the other room nearby. Blaise sat on the ground, pressed up against the far wall as Draco closed the door behind him. He got down on the floor next to his friend. They worked through the equations slowly. Blaise carefully and patiently explaining steps and motivations. He let Draco ask him questions and come up with the wrong answers so that he could understand Draco’s way of thinking and help him understand the right ways to accomplish the task.
Sirius grinned easily before answering, “That’s a good question; one I am trying to figure out myself. I used to help run a daycare and tutor high school kids in English on the side.” He paused, and added, “But I took time off to travel Europe for a while and haven’t decided what to do with myself now that I’m back. Mostly been spending time with family and babysitting the grandkids, you know how it goes.”
“Nice.” Harry said simply. Draco figured he either wasn’t interested in why Draco had taken time off of school or had picked up on the fact that he didn’t want to talk about it, because Harry shifted the subject and began asking him questions about classes he had taken before and what he wanted to study. They worked on a class list and a schedule for a little while, Harry reminding Draco of general education requirements he needed to complete and helping him research the professors to make sure they were the kind of teachers that Draco could handle. It was a mostly easy process; Draco found that he was feeling calmer and only sighed a few more times. He ended up enrolling in five classes, but knew that he could drop one of them if he wanted to - if it ended up being too much. His schedule was kind of a mess and he had classes on Fridays, but that wasn’t a big deal and he couldn’t think of anything he would be doing over the weekend anyway. Harry was actually going to be in one of the classes he was going to take - History of Sexuality - and Draco was slightly relieved. He was sure that Harry would have other friends in the class and might not remember him, but it would be nice to see a familiar face every once in awhile.
Ron gave him a small nod, his light blue eyes bright with desire, and Krum tugged the fabric of his boxer-briefs down his legs and off, tossing it lightly towards Ron’s hamper. He then brought trailed his hands up Ron’s legs, until he got back to his hipbones and leaned forward to place a kiss on each. With an affirming - albeit muffled - sound from Ron, Krum let his hands move down once more, this time working their way towards Ron’s now naked pubic area, through the course red hair there to the soft folds below. He circled the tip of his index finger around Ron’s elongated clit and was rewarded with a small noise of pleasure.
“Yes.” He replied, hoping there wasn’t anything else he was supposed to have said to the desk operator earlier.
“Oh, well I don’t know about Cho, I just met her! And she’s with Luna. I thought maybe we’d hang out a bit, maybe hook up, but nothing serious. With Draco it’s different, I don’t know. I wouldn’t want it to be just a thing.” Here Harry realized how much he actually wanted to talk about this. It had been floating around his brain for a while and it definitely was time to talk it through with someone, and Hermione was such a good option for him. She was perspective and a good listener and knew him so well. He let himself voice as much as he understood, “I like flirting with him, but I don’t think I’ll push for anything more unless I’m more sure of our friendship as a whole and that I won’t lose that if he doesn’t want to be in a different kind of relationship with me. But also,” at this Harry made sure to catch Hermione’s eye so she knew that he was thinking through this seriously, “I’ve only really known him for a little bit more than a month, and I can’t be presumptuous about anything until I know him better and for longer. I just… I don’t know, Hermione, he’s so pretty and interesting and I love being in class with him. I was so happy to see that he was Ron’s roommate because McGonagall even seemed to like him when he came in during the summer and that’s a really good sign. But he’s also kind of quiet and drawn, and pretty anxious, and I don’t want to push him away or anything and I think I would if I made my feelings a bit more clear to him - my feelings, which are, again, only a few weeks old.”
“How’s your day been so far?” Harry asked Draco as they walked toward the Great Hall having decided to go eat lunch. Oliver bid them a hurried goodbye, explaining he had a class in ten minutes. Draco felt a bit sorry for him, but his schedule tomorrow was similarly hectic, with his english class and other history class with only fifteen minutes separating them. He was glad today he only had two classes and that they were both in the morning.
“Oh, no I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to trivialize your sexuality, I shouldn’t have presumed in the first place, obviously, I mean look at where that got us” but Blaise grinned and waved his hand at him dismissively. “Who’s the girl?” Draco asked, deciding not to press the issue, wondering if it was really ok for him to ask, but pushing forward with the question anyway. Blaise had been forward with him, so why not… he was curious and Blaise could just shrug him off if he wanted to.
“I don’t know, it was weird.” Draco answered, “This random guy walked up to me and asked if I was Theo’s - my roommate a while ago - friend and if I had said yes, would have asked me to come sit with him. I didn’t recognize him at all.”
“Yeah, I mean I guess people don’t usually get to keep their best friends when they go away to college. We actually didn’t plan it out - well in a way I guess you could say we did but, it kind of just happened, you know. Do you know anyone here?”
“No, it’s ok,” Blaise said, going back to his reassuring tone of voice, “what’s up?”
“So far so good,” he answered, “I had Stat earlier today, which was fine. I mean, it’s syllabus week so she - Vector - just went over the quizzes and exam dates and stuff.” He wanted to say something about Luna but was unsure how to approach the subject, not wanting to seem really weirded out by someone who Harry was friends with, but figured it would be stranger if he didn’t say anything at all. “It was kind of weird, though, Luna was in my class. She said she wasn’t actually enrolled in the class, she was just sitting in. It was nice to see her, but it seems strange to audit a class so early in the semester…”
Harry stabbed a piece of broccoli with his fork, looking down at it for a moment before sharing his thoughts with his friend, “I think that’s a really good idea. We can have snacks and do silly themed fifteen-minute breaks on a schedule. And when Midterms are over we could have a party!” He chomped down on the broccoli in excitement and chewed it while Hermione smiled at him before settling more comfortably down in her seat to eat her own meal.
Between the three of them, they easily managed to get everything from the car and take it back up to the rooms. Ron wondered if the two other men were related in some way, but Draco seemed, for lack of a better word, fancy and the other guy was probably his butler or something like that. They didn’t talk much to each other or him, but he didn’t mind. Ron was fine helping out, and hoped that it would contribute to a more positive roommate relationship than the one had had last year. He thought about his freshman year for the amount of time it took to bring the rest of Draco’s things up to his room. Creevey hadn’t been a terrible roommate, but he hadn’t been that great either. He hadn’t been so good at cleaning up after himself, knowing how to interact with Ron after realizing he was trans, and often stayed up long hours into hours of the night. Ron hadn’t let it bother him too much, mostly because his friends were supportive and helped him out when he needed space away from his room and his floor in Gryffindor Tower. Also he knew confronting someone like Creevey would probably not do very much in the long run - maybe that was the easy way out, but Ron didn’t really care. He hoped this year would be different, Draco seemed like a pretty down to Earth guy, even with a (still unconfirmed) butler trailing after him.
Krum chuckled and then pushed off the bed. Ron scrambled up after him and quickly stripped the top blanket from the bed. He bundled it up and put on in the chair at his desk. Krum pulled back the normal blanket and top sheet to the end of the bed. Ron came up and pulled him into another kiss, moving their bodies back onto the bed. Krum shifted his weight to begin to move down the bed again, but Ron held him close to his body, “just wanna feel you for a bit,” he muttered and nipped at Krum’s jaw. Krum indulged his boyfriend’s request by pressing a little more firmly on his body and peppering his face with kisses. Eventually he asked into Ron’s neck, “is it ok if I finger you a for a bit, it’s just been so long since I’ve made you come.”
[from Scarface 2:14] wer here let us in
[from Scarface 2:14] Ronald
“No, it’s fine, don’t worry about it. He was my roommate for a semester, but that was a long time ago. I don’t think we were ever friends though.”
“Ugh okay, well, Krum and I kinda talked about um, me, ah, actually fucking him.”
Draco set down the glasses on the table and sat back down in the booth.
“Hi,” he whispered back. Ron moved back into his space and pressed his forehead to Krum’s.
“It’s kind of punk but also kind of cute, but in an angry way? You should just ask Krum honestly, I just like to listen to them, but I’m not really a music person. But you should come see them play! Then you can hear them for yourself.”
“I met some people when I was here the first time, mostly just people in my classes and a few who lived on the same floor as me in the Slytherin dorms, I’m sure some of them are still around, I didn’t stay in contact with anyone though.” Draco looked down at his plates, which still had food on them even though his stomach felt uncomfortably full. He had been hungry coming in but once he was sitting down and listening to everyone and getting caught up in the new exciting people, his appetite seemed to have slipped away. “I don’t really mind though, none of them were all that nice or interesting, they were just people I met along the way, I guess. I think it might be different this year, or at least I hope it will be,” Draco offered Hermione a weak smile just as Ron stood up and collected a few of the empty plates around the table. Draco picked up his own, feeling a bit guilty for the leftover food, and followed him to the corner in back of the dining area where people dropped off their plates, utensils, and trash.
“Hey, why don’t we go sit in my room, it’s much comfier, and we should have our
Tapping at his phone once securely in bed, damp-haired and warm, Draco brought up his text messages and clicked on Pansy’s name. He scrolled through some of their more recent texts which were of him informing her he was going back to school. He smiled at the ‘!!!!’ that she had sent him and the multitude of questions she shot back.
With that comment setting the tone of the rest of the movie, they continued to watch. Blaise commented on everything, from the second hand embarrassment of Will Turner breaking a piece of the Swan’s house and pretending like he didn’t, to asking whether or not it was actually possible to trap enough air under an upturned boat and use it to walk across the ocean floor, to the stark green-ness of the apple Jack Sparrow was eating casually on a pirate ship. Hermione and Cedric were the only ones who really commented on anything else, and most of them just laughed at all the appropriate parts. Ron noted that Draco seemed to be enjoying himself.
“I don’t know,” Draco said, “I’m terrible at math, I’m probably going to need all the help I can get.”
Remus and Sirius chatted as they sipped coffee which they were able to get topped off by a server at some point, the time moving past them unnoticed until Sirius was interrupted mid-sentence by a buzzing from his phone - a call this time. He apologized for the interruption and pulled out his phone to answer it, turning head in an attempt at politeness,
Ron let out a soft sigh, “I don’t even know what I want to talk about, it feels like a big thing, even though I know it’s not, I mean it’s not like I’ve never had sex before. I guess it just feels like it shouldn’t have taken this long, maybe… I don’t know, I’m about to be a Sophomore in uni and I still haven’t actually fucked anyone...” his words trailed off sadly and Harry was surprised.
Draco went back into his home, into the now empty entrance hall, his hair still slightly damp from his shower not having dried in the cool morning air. He stood on the marble floor and slowly turned, eyes roving over the staircases that lead away from him, the heavy wooden doors, the side tables and vases of flowers and the paintings on the wall that he had known his whole life. He had done this two years ago when he first embarked on a journey to college, and now, doing so once again, he felt a few loose pieces fitting together in his chest. He knew he had made the right choice.
“Oh right, I remember you saying that when we were talking about classes,” Harry exclaimed, “we’re gonna take the same history of sexuality class this semester!”
As the movie was coming to an end, Krum pressed a tiny kiss to the side of Ron’s head and whispered, “no, he’s a pirate” along with Elizabeth Swan, causing him to flush a little and glanced around. Ron then grinned and kissed Krum fully on the lips and brought a hand up to rest on his chest. They returned their focus to the screen after tonguing at each others mouths quietly to see that Harry had the remote back in his hands and was preparing the next movie.
“Yeah, well coming out to people is weird business, isn’t it?”
“Well I’ve actually not done it much before. I didn’t really discuss my sexuality with my parents before they died. Pansy was easy, but that’s because she knew I wasn’t straight almost immediately but she let me take my time I guess. This is rather pleasant.”
Harry put his phone away as he stepped into the Great Hall. He scanned the building for a good place to sit that Hermione would be able to find easily, since it was still early in the evening and most people would not be getting dinner for another forty-five minutes or so, it didn’t take him all that long. Picking a table finally, Harry dropped his backpack and jacket onto a seat and walked towards the buffet tables in order to fix a meal for himself.
“Yeah I understand. I’m a bit tempted, but I don’t know if I want to stand out so much. Her art is really beautiful, from what I saw of her bag, so I asked if she would paint on something that wasn’t my backpack.”
[from KnowItAll 2:04] Ron tell Harry that he doesn’t have to text you because we’re going to see you in like TWO minutes. You two can not be this codependent istg
“Oh lovely! Where in Europe?” Remus leaned forward unconsciously, but Sirius noticed. He got closer too but in a subtle, coffee drinking way.
Shifting so he was on his back once more, Draco let his hands run slowly up and down his body. At first, he wasn’t aware of it, just lost in his thoughts, but he started getting a bit tingly and let himself explore the expanse of his skin with more intentionality. He started by smoothing one hand over the length of the other arm, and then switched them, feeling the soft hairs of his arms and the little goosebumps that followed his kicking the blanket away and letting the air of the room settle around his naked skin. He wished he had freckles that he inevitably wouldn’t be able to count or that he had darker body hair that would stand out and contrast his ridiculously pale skin, but tried to let those thoughts go. Next, he took off his sleep shirt and let it fall to the floor by his bed. He brought his hands up to his collarbones and slid them to his neck, tracing the lines of it up and down; here, he wished for someone else’s hands to touch, a hickey to press down on, or a necklace to play with but he never liked wearing jewelry all that much. Draco’s hands traced down to his nipples and he let his fingers play with them, circling and pinching until they were hard and achy in a way that made his lower stomach warm. He traced over the tips of them for a bit, marveling at how sensitive he was to his own touch.
Draco who turned back to his suitcases said, “Cool.” Ron texted his friends back, putting the ringer on silent so he didn’t annoy his new acquaintance as he typed.
Draco’s eyes opened to the bright summer morning having forgotten to close his windows and curtains the day before, which was not something unusual. In response, Draco generally would shift onto his stomach, stick his head under his pillow and hope to fall asleep once more. It only worked half the time. This morning, Draco allowed himself to be woken up by the light and the sounds of summer insects that never truly went away. He sat up slowly, heard his joints cracking with the movement and enjoyed the stretch of his skin and muscles as he began to use them. Yawning, he headed to the bathroom down the hallway from his room, removing his shorts as he went. After a shower that helped relieve the knots of tension that had formed in his sleep, Draco dried off, put on a new pair of boxers, and made his way down to the small dining area where he knew breakfast would be. He hadn’t been down to this part of the house in over two weeks, choosing instead to utilize the small kitchen in a separate wing of the Manor that was kept well stocked but did not have much traffic. His mother’s butler, Mr. Dobby, brought him a stack of mail to look at as he sat down.
[from Scarface 2:14] Ron
“He’s my best friend and I’ve known him forever.”
The man smiled, “sure, I got time.” If Sirius would say so, and he would, the man seemed rather pleased by the offer.
[to Scarface, KnowItAll 2:10] lol ill see you guys soon. txt me when you get here
“Don’t worry about it,” the man said, holding up a gratefully long-fingered hand placatingly. Sirius admired him and took in the brown soft curls on his head and the gold flecks in his eyes and made a decision.
“Hey,” he said softly, and Krum got lost for a moment in his wide clear blue eyes as the finger fell away.
“Definitely!” Sirius assured before making his way over the counter once more, this time to place a much different order.
Hermione, then, abandoning her plateful of food, extracted her tablet from her handbag and started tapping at it. When Harry inquired as to what she was doing, she turned it around and showed him the short lists she had begun of: people to invite, types of exams to study for, snacks to buy, and short fifteen-minute activities that could break up the monotony of studying. He took the tablet from her and added a few ideas of his own so that she could start eating as he was mostly finished his meal at this point. By the time he and Hermione felt confident in the lists they had created, Blaise made his way over to their table with Luna and a person Harry did not recognize in tow. The three of them were all carrying plates and cups and they easily fit themselves around the table.
Draco, warm with faint relief, and general happiness at being in close proximity to his friend, mused, “Yeah, that makes sense, I think it would be good for me too. Though, to be honest, I haven’t been part of a study group since, like, high school.” He briefly remembered sitting with Pansy, Vince, and Greg in the middle of their crowded, noisy library, revising messy barely-comprehensible notes and editing papers with quiet academic fury turned inwards. Their finals, ensuring commencement, and uncertain futures tugging at their concentration, the pressure made bearable by the sweetness of their collective work effort. “Kind of miss that. That reminds me, I’m talking to Pansy at some point this evening!”
[also - i'm a white cisgender queer woman, and i'm just writing based on my own experiences mostly. i made sure to consult some of my friends who are trans and non-binary, but please please please let me know if i anything i wrote makes you uncomfortable or anything. i dont want to hurt anyone and i'd like to learn from and rectify my mistakes if i do]
Draco closed his computer and resolved to charge it when he found the energy to fully wake up. He pulled it more securely onto the bed and lay back down, staring at the white ceiling above him. Draco wasn’t really sure what to do for the next few days, if he was honest with himself. He figured he could watch movies and lay around in bed all day, but that would be boring. None of the people he met the day before had invited him to anything and he didn’t want to text them first, not fearing the rejection, but more the possibility that he wouldn’t get an answer at all. He lazily drifted in and out of awakeness for about an hour, letting his mind wander and his body relax.
They fell into a contemplative silence, letting their conversation sink in. Eventually Harry got up to use the restroom, and upon returning, snuggled up closer to Ron, tucking himself around his friend’s body. They lay pressed close to each other, breathing in even breaths, remarking occasionally on something that ran through their minds, or plucking a random question to play around with and unpack between them. Ron leaned around Harry at some point to locate Harry’s bluetooth speaker and phone so that he could play one of the playlists that Krum had made for him.
The moment Draco stepped through the open door to the classroom the knot of worry that had tied itself inside his chest as he power walked his way over unraveled slightly. Dr. Lupin looked over at him with a pleasant welcoming smile as he walked in, Draco tried to offer one in return and wasn’t so confident he managed to do so. Harry wasn’t there yet, so Draco chose a seat towards the middle of the class with empty seats on either side and hoped Harry would get there and choose to sit next to him before someone else did. A minute before class began, Harry walked in talking jovially to a person Draco didn't recognize. He spotted Draco and waved at him enthusiastically - causing Draco to wave back but feel a pull to duck his head self consciously that he squashed down immediately - before directing himself and his friend to sit by Draco. Before Harry’s friend could introduce himself, Dr. Lupin stepped out from behind the desk at the front of the room and caught everyone’s attention. The room quieted as Dr. Lupin began to speak.
“See - her father, whatever his name is - they mark the passage of time with his hair. It’s ridiculous, they don’t even try to make him look older, they just make his wig grey!”
Harry, who had long since finished his food, listening in on the conversations happening around him said “oh, gross, cut it out, you two,” suddenly, catching Draco’s attention. Harry was looking over at Ron and Krum who were kind of just staring at each other with hearts in their eyes. Draco thought it was kind of cute actually. Ron stuck his tongue out playfully at Harry and moved to sit back in his own seat. Draco saw that Krum slipped an arm around Ron’s shoulders, even as he did shifted away.
“I’ll see what I can do for you, Mr. Malfoy. Don’t get your hopes up though, it’s very late for housing requests. I will either call you or send you an email as soon as I can. And if you have no further questions, take another cookie to give to Mr. Potter on your way out.” Draco stared at Ms. McGonagall for a moment, taking in the hard lines of her face and her soft eyes, the tight way her hair was pulled back and the soft velvety look of the clothes she wore.
“Oh, we could all go back with you!” Harry said, “I mean if Ron sets up his TV, then we could watch something and make popcorn and Blasie can come over,” Harry offered Draco and Ron’s space to the group without asking how they felt about it, but it didn’t seem like either of them minded. Draco even looked a bit hopeful if Hermione was to be honest.
“Oh,” Draco says and then scrambled for a second about what to say, not wanting to freeze up and make things weird or give Ron the impression that he didn’t accept him or anything terrible like that. A bolt of anger at Ron’s previous roommate ran through his body. “I’m sorry he treated you that way. Thank you for letting me know, though I don’t think that changes anything, right?” Draco felt himself babbling, but didn’t know how to stop himself, “Unless you want something to change…? I don’t really know, I don’t want to say the wrong thing,” he shook his head again, “I’m cisgender but I’m also queer so even though I can’t empathize, I can probably sympathize…” Draco let his words float away.
“Ms. McGonagall told me to give this to you. Thank you so much for helping me out.”
“Oh, I almost forgot to mention, Sirius is going to pick me up, instead of Mom!”
A vibration for the phone in her pocket interrupted her train of thought and brought her out of her conversation. She smiled apologetically at Harry who shrugged before retrieving it and looking at the screen.
“Ok, keep doing your thing,” Ron said and started to rise from his seat, “I’m gonna go watch some Netflix in my room, feel free to poke me if you want to join me or anything!”
“Potter eats like a pig,” Krum said, acknowledging Draco’s reaction.
“Ok yeah and sounds actually pretty cool,” Draco thought it sounds more than just cool - it sounded amazing and he was a bit jealous and a bit full of aching desire for something like what Ron and Krum have.
He answered, “nah, I’ll just be a minute,” before closing the door behind him.
“It would be nice to have an extra set of hands,” the older one added after introducing himself as Mr. Dobby.
“Sorry it took me a while,” Blaise said, leaning towards Hermione, “Luna asked if she and Cho could join us. I figured it would give you two plenty of time to talk about whatever you needed to talk about.”
Now, Draco was on his way to the library, where the first study group would be held in a relatively small reserved room on the fourth floor. He brought with him some snacks to share with everyone, as Hermione had instructed, and his backpack bulging with notes and textbooks. He knew that he’d be early, but she would probably be as well, so he didn’t mind. And sure enough, when he stepped into the room, Hermione was already settled in, with her tablet surrounded by books and highlighters; her beautiful curly hair was up in a big messy bun, tendrils of it falling and framing her face. Draco took that to mean that she had actually been here for quite some time. Neville was there as well, pulling his own school paraphernalia out of his painted backpack. Draco sat down in a rolling chair next to him, and began his own process of unloading. Neville exchanged kind welcoming words with him as they both settled in.
[to Hermy 5:56] hey you around get dinner with my please. need advice
“No problem. Honestly, It’s nice to say out loud every once in a while.” Blaise turned so that he was once again sitting with his back against the wall. He leaned his head back against it, his neck elongated and beautiful. “I like to be able to appreciate how amazing she is, even from a friendly distance.”
[from Scarface 1:24] just finished unpacking
As he sat down on the bed and shuffled to lean back against the wall, he admitted “I guess I’ve been a bit more obvious in my emotions recently than I thought I was.”
[from Scarface 1:26] gonna stop by in a few once i find herman
Eventually, Blaise deepened the kiss, pressing at Draco’s mouth a bit more intensely and bringing his tongue into the mix. Draco chased after it with his own and raised a hand to Blaise’s chest, clutching at the fabric of his shirt as the two of them kissed with more vigor. Blaise brought his free hand to Draco’s side, just below his ribcage. Draco tilted his head in response, pushing himself more enthusiastically into their embrace and feeling at the warmth emanating from below Blaise’s shirt. Blaise pulled back in order to bite and tug playfully at Draco’s lips, bringing more blood to the surface of the thin skin there. From the sounds that Draco make, he surmised that the blonde man liked that and further descended upon him with his teeth, but not before kissing those swollen lips. Blaise kissed and nipped his way to Draco’s jaw and then to his neck. He paused, lips against the fair skin there, licking it lightly, causing Draco to shiver, and asked if Draco wouldn’t mind a few hickies, his breath perfect and hot, lips fluttering against skin.
It didn’t take long for them to slot their mouths together and lend themselves over to the warmth and familiarity of their bodies. One of Ron’s hands held that back of Krum’s head, fingers sinking into his hair. They barely came up for air.
Draco Malfoy lay on his bed half naked, his fingers trailing up and down the fine hairs on his stomach as a warm breeze drifted in his room through the windows that lined the opposite wall, dragging the loose curtains with it as it went. He sighed to himself, not for the first time, as he stared up as the plain blue-ish grey ceiling above him. He was bored. He was twenty years old, and he was bored. He knew he didn’t have to be, but there are only so many times a person can masturbate in one afternoon and he had no interest anymore in the books that lay in scattered piles on the floor around his bed. It wasn’t like he couldn’t think of anything to do, it just that he had no desire to do any of the things he had at his disposal, which was why he was bored.
“So.” He said after swallowing, “I never really had a chance to talk about this kinda stuff with my last roommate, so...” he trailed off, trying to collect his thoughts, “I don’t really know how it’s supposed to go. How should we start?”
“Ok, woman then. Who is she?” the look on Blaise’s face made Draco even more curious at this new revelation.
“Who’d you get?” Hermione asked before Harry or Ron could, taking her attention away from the movie.
[to Scarface 1:27] my mom just left too - maybe theyll run into eachother. new roommate’s here. gonna say hi. txt me when you get to prefect ill let you up.
They smiled at each other and Draco can’t think of anything much to say. He looked down at the school supplies in front of him and tried to come up with something to add, feeling his face flush in embarrassment. Harry beat him to it, thankfully, by continuing to talk and not letting the pause last beyond slight discomfort.
“Do you think you might ask her out eventually?” Draco asked. He too shifted so he was sitting next to Blaise, the wall a reassuring cool surface to press against.
“Understandable, and probably overwhelming.”
“Yeah, we like to, um, expand our horizons when we can. Though, I should clarify,” Ron said, turning his head slightly so their eyes met, “it’s mostly fooling and all that, not so much sex, I guess, depending on how you define sex. Not that we wouldn’t be up to it, theoretically, but we’re not really ready to bring another person in in that way, yet.”
[from Scarface 204] ras arent allowed pets so mom had to take hedwig home :(
It didn’t take long for Draco to decide that he wanted to go back to school. In fact, he barely had begun his process of pro-con-ing the idea when he realized it was probably the right thing to do. He was endlessly bored in his home and very much did not want to re-join the general workforce. He was sure there were other options to consider, like traveling or creating some kind of project for himself, but both of those things probably took an extraordinary amount of planning in comparison with returning to his studies. He filled out the forms and faxed it to the school, figuring he had already opened the letter later than he was supposed to and did not want to have them wait much longer to answer. He also asked Mr. Dobby to place a call to the university in order to schedule an in-person meeting with Ms. McGonagall and set everything in order.
Ron Weasley was tired and bored. His mother had finally finished organizing everything in his room without consulting him at all about what he wanted. His father had already come and gone, making sure Ron was comfortable and had what he needed before giving him a short hug and wishing him good luck, before running off to his job he was already late for. Ron’s mom didn’t stay longer than she had to, either, though it felt like she had been there for a good amount time. She left him with a quick kiss on the cheek, a tight hug, and a promise to take him out to dinner in two weeks. He was used to it by now, they had done the same thing last year, and he saw them do the same for all his older siblings when they moved into their dorms or apartments, no matter how old they were. He found it quite endearing, if he was going to be honest with himself, and felt a rush of love for his parents as he watched his mother make her walk down the hallway to the elevator that would take her away. Ron knew this tradition was coming to a close, however, as he was the last and youngest child of the Weasley family. Of course, his parents would always do this kind of thing whenever he or any of his siblings moved locations, but it was strange to realize that this year and the next two were the last times they would ever move one of their children into a college dorm.
When he returned, Krum had snagged another butterbeer and replaced their empty bag of popcorn with and movie-theater box of snow caps. Ron snatched up a Hogwarts University-edition™  chocolate frog box before sitting back down and accepting the bottle from his boyfriend. He drank from it before passing it back and opening the box. He groaned softly after pulling the card out from under the chocolate frog and checking who was on it.
“I think pretty much everyone, except maybe Hermione and Cedric, and I guess not Luna anymore, since she’s been more into more femme-presenting people recently. Also,” Ron said, going a bit pink around the ears, “sometimes he joins Krum and me.”
Draco nodded to Ms. McGonagall and rose from his seat. He walked his way back to the main entrance and through the doors, going to his car to collect his bag which contained his laptop.
They ended up both sitting on Ron’s bed, Ron leaning against his pillows and Draco cross-legged and hesitant. Ron had retrieved the last of the ice-cream (mint chocolate chip) from his freezer and two spoons before situating himself and Draco found it relieving to have something to focus on aside from his roommate. He was a bit lost, however, not sure how to proceed now that he and Ron were in this position. Draco fiddled with the spoon in his hands before reaching forward and scooping out some ice-cream, figuring that it was better to do something than just sit and wait. He wondered briefly at the fact that he hadn’t had real food that day other than the sandwich at Madam Puddifoot’s, but shoved that thought away as the cold cream melting in his mouth and flooded his taste buds with overwhelming minty sweetness.
“Oh,” was all Draco could think to say, having trouble picturing the two together, mostly because Ron and Krum seemed like such a good match, it was hard to imagine Ron with anyone else.
“Nymphadora, but I go by Tonks. Got tired of purple in the middle of last year. Anyway... what did you want to order?” She seemed pleased that Draco recognized her and he was pretty flattered in return that she remembered him to this degree. He smiled and placed an order of a medium-sized regular coffee and a BLT sandwich with a pickle and chips on the side. After ringing up his order, Tonks took a purple pen out from her apron pocket and wrote her number on his receipt, telling him to “text me, if you want, we could get coffee - maybe not here though - and catch up sometime,” before turning to Harry and asking what he wanted to order.
After dressing himself in his comfiest but publically acceptable clothes, Draco walked down the front of his home, to where his suitcases, boxes, and bag sat, waiting to be dragged into his car. He exited the mansion and walked to the garage to drive his car to the entrance. As he began to pile his possessions into the trunk, he wondered how much stuff other students would bring and worried about appearing strange, having too much or too little, about what his new roommate would think. He couldn’t remember the amount of things he brought with him to freshman year - it felt like such a long time ago. Thankfully, everything was easy to organize and fit without much effort, except for a few items Draco placed in the backseat of the car.
“Oh, yeah, classic Luna,” Harry said with a grin, “She offers to paint everyone’s book bag. I think Neville is the only one who let her. I thought about it but I usually take my backpack to work and I didn’t want anything outrageous on it - not that I think she would do something outrageous, but you know…”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Definitely true in some regards. Hmm, well, first of all, I'm sure none of us think it’s weird that you and Blaise made out! It is a relatively normal thing that happens for us. For Blaise specifically, he really likes
Sirius sat down across from his new acquaintance, noticing that the books and folders had made their way onto an empty chair and the messenger bag Remus had had across his shoulder and back was on the floor, leaning against the leg of his own chair. Sirius checked his phone to see if Hermione had responded, realized he had forgotten to send a message in the first place, and shared a smile he hoped was dazzling with the man across from him.
“Nah it’s fine,” Ron said as he deposited the bean-bag chair in front of the couch, “I mean, we have a couch and two fold-y chairs. I think Draco might also have a chair and you brought three. There are, what, 6 - 7 of us, right? We definitely have enough.”
He paused, and then continued, with a serious expression on his face, “None of us expect these things of you, unless you made your interest clear. I feel a bit weird telling you other people’s ways of being intimate, but I think most people would be really open to talking to you about stuff, if you felt comfortable asking.”
“Do I look to be of the age?”
“I couldn’t find my second lawn chair - though I probably wouldn’t have been able to carry it along with everything else, to be honest.”
Later that night, when Ron and Draco were alone in the living room (Krum was in Ron’s room, getting ready for bed, having already bid Draco a goodnight), Draco tried to bring himself to ask about Fall break, but didn’t really know how to. He also wanted to talk to him about Blaise and kissing and platonic sexuality and this friend group, but that felt like a huge topic that maybe deserved time to talk, and not right before they were going to sleep. He also wasn’t sure exactly how he would want to frame it or the kinds of questions he would ask. Not that he thought Ron would react negatively, on the contrary, Ron seemed like probably the perfect person to talk to about this stuff, because of how much importance he placed on friendship, not to mention his flair for public displays of affection. But Draco found it difficult to formulate the words, let alone articulate the thoughts and questions he had. In the end, he wished Ron a pleasant evening and left his red-haired friend behind looking after him with empathy and confused amusement at his sudden departure in favor of his own room. When he emerged about twenty minutes later to brush his teeth and wash his face, the living room light was off and Draco could hear the tiny muffled sounds of two men talking in the room next to his.
“Yeah, sure, what’s up?” Harry replied as Ron climbed on his bed beside him. He fidgeted once he sat down, unable to get comfortable. Harry wanted to frown at that, but he refrained, just letting his question hang in the air invitingly.
Puzzling silently at his two companions, Harry forgot to buy half the things he wanted, though looking back on it when he returned to his room, he was glad for - most of the things he had on his list were frivolous and it wouldn’t make sense for him to spend his small amount of hard earned money on things he could easily get from the Great Hall, where he already had a meal plan paid for.
“Um, hello?” Draco ventured, taking a half step forward, “I have an appointment with Ms. McGonagall in about ten minutes. Am I in the right place?” The man behind the desk quickly looked up and focused his startling green eyes on Draco. He pushed the glasses back to the top of his nose, Draco’s eyes followed the movement.
“You too?” Draco said to his retreating back. He stared after him for a beat before shaking his head and continuing on his way back to his table. He did not really remember ever meeting any of Theo’s friends, especially not this one. Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about Theo’s crowd being able to recognize him mostly because he didn’t know any of them.
“Maybe,” Ron shrugged, “or maybe we’re just pretty good at reading people. This group of friends especially, people tend to put quite some effort into knowing what’s going on with their friends, so as a collective we’re a lot more observant. At least, I think so.” Draco nodded again.
Ron looked at his two friends, his head moving from left to right, “I missed you guys - I mean, you both. I’ve been trying to get into the habit of not using gendered language,” he said all in a rush and they beamed back at him, “but you know, it’s kinda tough.” And they nodded sagely back. The three of them stood in companionable silence as they watched the numbers move from (2) to (3) “Well aren’t you going to say anything?” Ron asked, as the elevator doors slid open again.
“Both, I guess, but mostly the first. I’m really not sure what I want to do in my life, I can’t really imagine what it will be like in a year or five - though I guess going to school for the next three years or so might help with that - which is part of the reason I decided to go back. I just couldn’t sit in the Manor any longer and do nothing. I didn’t want to go back to doing meaningless work and I was just so
“Yeah, well I can still think they’re adorable. I’m a year older and much wiser.” He nodded sagely, lifting his eyebrows in an attempt to make a smart-person-face.
[from Scarface 1:24] hey man
“Here,” Harry said as he pulled his phone out of his pocket, “I’ll text you a link.” He clicked around on the screen before realizing, “Wait! I don’t think I have your number? Here, add yourself to my contacts and I’ll forward you the link.” He handed the phone over to Draco with the ‘New Contact’ screen open for Draco to tap away at.
“Still, can I buy you a coffee or something? Unless you’re in a hurry?”
“Sorry”
The a bell chimed as the four boys stepped through the double doors into Madam Puddifoot’s. There weren’t many people in the building and most of the tables were empty. Ron spotted Hermione sitting off in a corner with a huge coffee mug already in front of her. She smiled and gestured over to the counter, indicating that they should order before joining her, and turned back to the book she was reading. Draco, Ron, and Krum lined up behind the two people waiting to place their own orders and Draco saw a waiter put down a dark green salad bowl next to Hermione’s mug after a minute while Harry darted up to the counter to get two menus for them to look over.
[from Sprog 2:25] sirius! r you on campus yet? i have a 5 min break rn so wanted ot check in
“Well it’s not much of a break, though, is it, only five days?” Draco hedged, as he was not sure what he wanted to do yet. He wished that Harry hadn’t asked, but tries to go along with it and not be too disappointed by this particular segue.
Draco felt bad about shifting the mood in this way and uncomfortable under the meaningful words that Hermione said. He realized that maybe she knew how he felt a little, her smile and eyes empathetic. The whole atmosphere, awkward but tender, was thankfully shattered when Krum came through the coffee shop doors and reseated himself at the table.
[from PP 2:13] the minifridge’s making weird sounds and I’m going to call maintenance - jsyk. Will update you later
This feeling of listless apathy was pervasive throughout more than just that single early June day; it bled through the many of them especially the late ones, through the weeks and the months that the made up the summer. Interests piqued and then were put to rest easily and without ceremony. He spent his days holed up in the Manor and resolutely did not feel guilty about his inactivity. One day, when the humid month of August was doing its very best, quite notably so, to ruin Draco’s hair and mood, he spent a lazy sweaty morning creating a rather bland omelet full of things that should have had flavor but didn’t, though that was more due to Draco’s taste buds than anything else, really. The coffee beans, that he found the energy to grind and deposit in his coffee machine, helped make the sticky morning a little more bearable with their rich, comforting aroma. Draco let his coffee grow cold, though it was an act that allowed himself a much needed relief from the monotony of ice water during his summer experience. But, as it were, the coffee grew mildly chilly and a little too sweet as the Manor’s air grew warm and thick. Draco felt the creeping dullness slither around his feet and up into the bones of his toes. The afternoon drew on wearily but at least he found the energy to build himself a small, sweet snack a few hours into the afternoon. What meager drive Draco managed to compile that morning dissipated and left him feeling weak. It was not until the coolness of the evening pressed down on Draco’s shirtless body that he managed to do much more than sigh to himself or flip through pages of a random book. He forced himself to rise from his reclined position and find a telephone to order in dinner, an act that seen as one of laziness but to Draco was an anxiety inducing exercise in social interaction over the phone with a stranger and having to make an actual decision. The thought of chewing and swallowing food was slightly nauseating to Draco, but he knew he needed to eat.
“True. No, I don’t go to Hogwarts, but my godson is a student here. I’m picking him up for the break. He has classes still, so I’ve just been walking around while I wait.” Sirius sipped from his own drink, “That’s a really interesting spread of subjects you cover; I studied English Lit when I was in university and took some of those kinds of classes, mostly to fill out electives. Never took Judaic studies though.”
“That’s true,” Blaise said, and they sat in the room in silence for several beats. “Well, maybe we should head back, unless you want to review some more of the math...?”
“Well could you start by talking through how you decided to go back to school?”
Harry was quickly becoming finding spending time with Draco extremely enjoyable. At first, he worried that the whole thing would be perfectly awkward, seeing as they had first met when he was at his job and then again so suddenly when Draco just beginning to get his bearings. He shouldn’t have worried, as the two of them got along really well during both of those accidental meetings and then later twice a week for their shared history class. That, in all honestly, was what had really worried Harry at first. There were several reasons for this anxiety, the first being that Harry wanted to get to know Draco but he wasn’t sure if that was because he wanted to be his friend or because he found him attractive (turned out both were true, and Harry was not surprised at himself in the slightest). A different reason was that sometimes people prefer to keep their class-friends and their normal-friends (whatever that meant) separate from each other and it was possible that Draco was one of those people. It became apparent early on that Draco was, in fact, not that kind of person, but nevertheless, Harry wondered at this. Finally, he so badly wanted Ron to have a good experience with Draco as a roommate and have that roommate join their closely knit friend-circle, that he was afraid he might come off strangely to the man in question and push him away. Despite all this, Harry learned that Draco wanted to be his friend just as badly as he wanted to be his (though in a more quiet, subdued way) and that all his worries were baseless and anxiety-driven more than anything else. And, admittedly, Harry never hesitated in his friendship toward Draco no matter all these feelings, as that was not in his nature.
“Well, we received your forms and everything seems to be in order. I reviewed it all before this meeting,” She said and motioned to a small stack of papers on her desk. “Unless you have concerns or questions, the only thing you have left to do is enroll in classes for this semester. It is a bit late, so there might not be as many choices are you would like, but I am positive you will be able to find classes you want. Worst comes to worst, you’ll have to put yourself on a waiting list for a class, but that’s not a bad option, really. Did you have any questions?”
Between all that and managing the front desk of the administration building every other morning, Harry had been the busiest he could remember being at the start of a semester. It was a relief when Ron texted, asking him to accompany him and Draco to the on-campus supermarket-type-thing, Diagon Alley. The building had always seemed a bit weird to Harry, it’s lopsided walls and strange, swirly decorations gave it an eery, fluorescent vibe and the merchandise it sold was honestly a bit wacky. It, of course, had most of the necessary foodstuffs that small grocery stores should, but it also stocked rows and rows of large, strangely colored objects and had tanks of polkadotted lizards in random aisles.
“Well if us flirting wasn’t obvious, I guess it’s fair that you wouldn’t be able to catch on to my crush, though I’m sure it’s pretty out in the open if anyone cared to see.”
“How are you feeling?” Harry asked Draco quietly, refocusing his attention.
Krum let his own hands pull Ron’s body closer as they kissed, rubbing up and down his back until his fingers caught on the hem of his shirt, causing it to ride up. His hands slipped under it and began to pull it up. Ron leaned back, separating their mouths, which were now a little redder and a little more swollen then they had been, so that he could take the shirt off himself. But before Krum could reel Ron back in and trace the lines of his body, over the bumps of his spine and seams of his binder and the small moles that littered his back, Ron placed a stalling finger on his lips.
* * *
“Cool. I’m hoping that the classes I’m taking this semester will help me figure that kind of stuff out.”
“Hi everyone, I'm Dr. Remus Lupin, though I’d prefer if you called me Remus. I finished my doctorate a few years ago and am happy to have the honor of returning the education I received at Hogwarts University to all of you.” His smile was kind as he spoke and when he looked around the room, Draco had to stop himself from smiling back, not wanting to seem strange. “Let's start by going around the room so you all can introduce yourselves to me and the rest of your class. Please share your name, pronouns, and majors and/or minors, and a fun thing you did this summer - annoying question, I know, but I was us all to get to know each other a bit better. Why don't we start with you?” Dr. Lupin said, gesturing with both hands open-faced to a girl sitting to the left- and front-most seat of the classroom.
thing? How things like this fit into this friend group and all that, I don’t know. Does that make sense? ”
“Not at all, Krum’s just getting dressed now, anyway.”
“Hey, Harry,” Hermione said brightly as she sat down across from him. He raised his head to grin at her over a mouthful of food (Hermione made a disgusted face at him) before swallowing loudly and setting his utensils down. “What’s up?”
“And Lavender, too,” Luna added.
Draco nervously stepped out of his car in the parking lot in front of the administration office of Hogwarts University. He pulled at the sleeves of his jacket and the buttons of his shirt as he made his way toward the building. Draco pushed through the glass doors easily and walked the few steps it took to the welcome desk of the office. A young man sat behind it with curly dark hair and wire rimmed glasses that were falling off his nose. He seemed very engrossed in the book he kept under the wood of the desk, head bowed and unobservant. Draco hesitated before disrupting the man’s concentration, watching him quietly for a second before clearing his throat in a way he hoped wasn’t overly annoying.
“Good idea,” Hermione said, “you’re better with him about these types of things anyway.”
Mr. Dobby nodded, “Why don’t I help you write a pro and con list? That might help a little.”
“I get that. It is kinda scary to do new things, even if you want to do it, right? I mean I was nervous the first time I had sex. And even though I think I know what I’m doing, I’m sure I’d be nervous trying something new”
fucked someone before. It’s totally ok that this is your first time doing this specific thing and that you haven’t done it before this time. And you can hold out on it for as long as you want - just because you and Krum have been talking about it doesn’t mean it has to happen immediately, well I guess I don't know how long you two have been talking about it, but still. There shouldn’t be any pressure for you to even have sex like that if you don’t want to.”
“Well, not many people do, but I love it. Not as much as my mom, though. She’s over the moon that I’ve invested energy in my Jewish heritage.”
“Yeah,” Ron said, looking up from his own phone, “he texted me too. Are we doing anything? I mean, none of us really made plans.”
Blaise’s face fell a bit, but did not stop being friendly or inviting, “Oh, I’m sorry. I feel like we’ve been flirting for a while and you might want to. It’s okay if not - that’s why I asked. I misinterpreted, I’m sorry.”
“Oh nice! So he’s back from Europe then? How long’s it been?” Before Harry could answer, one of the servers came by with their sandwiches. They both sat quietly as he placed them in front of them, before thanking him as he walked away.
“Weird!” Harry said and then handed the box he had taken to Draco, “Here, open one for yourself and see who you get. Usually, they’re just the top people who run HU. The special ones are random professors and staff members. I think half of the ones that Ron and I’ve found were Dumbledore. Once I got McGonagall it was amazing. I showed it to her at work - she smiled at me and gave me a cookie.” While Harry was explaining, Ron watched as Draco opened the box. He lifted the chocolate frog to inspect it, nodded to himself, before peering down at the card.
We hope that you return to your studies and this school, but we understand if you chose not to. Please make a decision as soon as you are able, preferably before this coming Fall semester starts or the Spring semester after it so that we can give our transfer student the time they need to prepare.
Blaise and Luna introduced themselves. Blaise sent him a beautiful grin from across the table and Draco knew instantly that he wanted to be friends with the man. Luna, next to him, spoke in soft, peaceful tones, greeting him with large blue eyes and a softer smile. She reminded Draco of stories of nymphs or mermaids in old mythology, ethereal and bright, with deep seated power.
“Okay, thanks,” Draco moved towards a comfy looking blue couch, “and my name is Draco Malfoy.”
Food shopping with Ron and his new roommate Draco was an adventure. Hermione had opted out seeing as her refrigerator was still out of commision so it was just the three of them. They had managed to put it off until the day before classes started, relying on the food they brought from home and the occasional meal at the dining hall or coffee shop - or at least, that’s what Harry was assuming. He hadn’t seen his friends much after their movie marathon. He constantly had to be around when the kids on his floor were moving in to help answer questions, direct them to the right places, and encourage them to actually participate in the Orientation activities. He wasn’t all that successful in that regard, most of them elected to stay in their rooms or hang out with their new friends rather than follow him to the admittedly awkward events the school’s Student Government Association whipped up, hoping to excite and welcome their new students.
“Oh.” Draco said, his eyebrows raising a fraction in surprise, “that’s very kind of you. I wouldn’t want to be presumptuous and intrude though, maybe I’ll talk to Ron about it later?”
Draco looked down at the table cloth in front of him, hiding the deep beautiful wood of the table under it. He thought it over quickly and then said decisively, “Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, let’s do that.”
“Well that sounds pretty awesome, if I’m gonna be honest. What exactly are you worried about? How can I help you?”
Draco’s mind went blank for a minute in shock, and then he asked quietly, “Um... what?”
“So you said you had a declared major, right?” Draco asked, “what is it exactly?”
“Kinda adorable, really. Like in a shy, cute kinda way. He had a butler though, or at least I think the guy helping him move his stuff was some kind of butler, so he’s probably super rich. But he didn’t seem too snobby so,” Ron trailed off and shrugged his shoulders. Krum knew money was sometimes hard for Ron and his family. With the amount of siblings he had, it wasn’t hard to guess the financial strains they were under, especially when Ron wasn’t the only one in college.
Remu’s eyes seemed to brighten as he talked, “I belong to the history department, but I also teach some classes that overlap with American, gender, and Jewish studies depending on the semester and general interest.” He paused to pick yp his mug, and then asked, “what brings you to this university? Are you a prospective student?”
The hours whittled quietly away, punctuated as well by a few knocks on the doors from Harry’s freshman. Ron stayed on the bed when Harry went to help him and every once in awhile he and Krum would exchange texts. It was hard for Krum to be consistent because today was one of his band practice afternoons, but Ron didn’t mind at all as he pleasantly drifted through the afternoon. Harry was glad for it, it had been a busy week and it was nice to get some time with his best friend.
Draco left his room open wide open as he began to finish unpacking. Ron and Harry were fiddling with the TV Ron had, trying to set it up in the common area. Hermione realized they probably didn’t have enough seating for everyone, so she called Blaise to tell him to bring chairs or something so that there would be more options. The two of them had talked over the summer quite a lot and it was nice to hear his voice again now that she was back in school. Seeing him yesterday with Luna had been wonderful. Hermione then called Luna, not wanting to leave her out of this gathering if she wanted to come, but turned out she was going to a book fair with a few of her friends from the previous semester.
Draco straightened up and looked over to where Hermione and Harry were sitting - on his bed. He smiled and leaned against his desk to talk to them.
“Ok, well, yes, Blaise and I, um, hooked up a little bit” Draco could feel himself blush at this, he hadn’t actually acknowledged it out loud before. He offered Ron a smile before looking away again, but he knew that Ron smiled back. “It was really nice and fun. I guess I was wondering if it was weird that Blaise and I did that? And if it was like a
“Figured it all out?” She asked and gestured for him to sit across from her again.
“So sorry,” he said, handing the items over to the person he assumed was a professor or at least a TA based on appearance and material alone.
“Oh, you know, you and Cho just now and also everyone you ever talk to, and Draco and Tonks from Madam Puddifoot’s flirt all the time.”
Krum pulled a harness and a blue dildo and looked at them closely. Ron, now also mostly naked, noticed what Krum was doing and moved to sit next to him close enough for their thighs to press together.
yeah i havent written fanfic in a really long time. let me know what you think?
He wasn’t expecting Ron to knock on his door a few minutes later, but he did. Ron apologized for not making sure it was ok with Draco before bringing his boyfriend over for the night and told him Krum would leave in a few hours if Draco wanted. “I know we have our own rooms, but we also share the general space, so I just don’t wanna make you feel uncomfortable or anything.” Ron said as he ran a hand through his red hair. Now that Ron had acknowledged Draco’s ownership over the space, Draco felt a lot better about the whole thing. So he thanked Ron for going out of his way to make him feel more welcome and assured him that he didn’t mind all that much that Krum was around.
“Ok yeah, that makes total sense. I mean, even choosing classes at a normal time is stressful.”
[from Krumcake 2:06] Saw Hermione and Harry walking to you. Just got on campus. Gonna unpack and then come over Hope your moving in went well. <3
Roughly two hours later, Hermione and Ron were in the Common Room, searching for a place to sit together. Hermione was carrying with her a fresh mug of coffee and Ron had a late lunch in a paper bag from one of the bakeries. They found an open round table towards the middle of the building, the other tables and occupants loosely in a circle near a staircase. Hermione pulled out her tablet and a bluetooth keyboard while Ron started on his cheese toast and fruit cup.
[from Sprog 2:28] awesome ttyl <3
Harry finally brought up her comment about flirting again and asked, “what did you mean? Who does Draco flirt with?” hoping she would expand a bit on her point. He knew that he tended to have a habit of flirting with a lot of people without even meaning to, but hadn’t really noticed Draco doing the same. If he had missed something like that about his new friend, he wanted to know.
“I can help you too,” Hermione offered, “I’m pretty decent at these kinds of things, too.” She said this in a way that implied she was good at school in general not just statistics, the type of person who never got grades lower than a B.
“Break goes by so quick, I hate it,” she added just as they heard the dorm room open once again.
Blaise said, “They’re always like that,” to Draco. But before he could respond Hermione laughed and said, “He knows, we warned him already.”
“I know places on campus,” Draco looked over at Krum and reminded the two of them, “I was here for a semester already. But yeah, it would be nice to go somewhere other than the dining hall - it was so different from how I remembered it, so…” Draco shrugged, not sure where he wanted his sentence to end, and then looked down at his hands which he hadn’t noticed were twisted in his lap around his phone until then.
“I’m not selling myself short, I just feel like this deserves more time, I guess.” He suddenly felt extremely vulnerable and very much like he wanted a subject change. “I do want to keep talking about this, and I definitely need to, but I’m feeling a bit raw about it, Hermione. Can we go to your dorm now and save it for later, maybe?”
“Well at least I have manners when I want to, you’re just disgusting,” Ron said.
Ron opened the door to his dorm room with one hand as the other clutched at a large bean-bag chair that Blaise brought with him. Blaise was standing a little behind him, also holding onto a bean bag. Additionally, he had a lawn chair folded into its case strapped across his back so that he didn’t have to hold it. As they stepped through, Blaise was saying,
Harry just smirked at her and crossed his hands over his chest, “I’d take the Host over any Dan Brown book any day.”
He let out a breath and tried to figure out how to articulate his feelings, “I know, I’m sorry Pans, we really should have talked during the summer.”
“The three of us are sophomores,” said Hermione, “but I’m the only one with a declared major. Do you have a major?” Ron and Harry both rolled their eyes at her, but in a loving kind of way, Draco noticed. He made a mental note to ask Ron about his friends later.
“Oh, I’m not,” She smiled over at him, her hair fluttered slightly in the soft end-of-summer air, “Sometimes I like sitting in classes I don’t have to see what they’re like. Professor Vector was nice about it last semester.”
By the time Dean and Seamus walked in, about forty-five minutes later, Draco had completed a packet of flashcards for his American history class with terms and important dates, and begun working through the study guide for Stat, making note of questions that we more difficult for him to figure out - he planned to ask Blaise for some help with it later, remembering his offer to tutor. Hermione took their entrance as a cue to take a short break and called everyone to order,
“Hey,” Draco called out as Ron walked through the door to their apartment. He was sitting on the couch, feet propped up on the coffee table on which sat a steaming mug of what looked to be tea, with a computer in his lap.
“Oh not much, just finishing some edits on one of my midterms.” Draco’s mouth twisted with a slight grimace and Ron could really empathize.
“Did you like it?” He asked, wanting to know how Ron felt before he shared his own feelings. If Ron wanted to know, though, what Krum thought of getting fucked with the toys he was holding, all he had to do was look down Krum’s lap, where his cock had begun to harden just from the very idea.
“Parvati said there’s something weird with the minifridge we ordered,” Hermione informed Harry while texting Parvati back, “how’s your RA dorm by the way? You haven’t said anything about it.”
“I just... I’m just really not sure what I want to do.”
Hermione brightened at the question, she loved to talk about her studies. “I’m a social work major. I thought about doing psychology for a while, but I took psych-101 and an intro to social work class and I realized that was more my steam.”
“Good,” Mr. Dobby said, nodding again, reminding Draco of a bobble-head,  “I’ll go get something to write down your ideas. Why don’t you take some time to eat breakfast? It might help you think more clearly.” The two men then began moving around the room, Mr. Dobby in search of writing utensils and Draco to fill a plate with food. Along the wall on the left side of the room was a mini buffet table that was mostly empty aside from some bowls of fruit, a bread basket, a toaster, butter, raspberry jam, and a coffee machine with all the necessary ingredients. Draco took a moment to cut himself a few slices of nectarine to add to the collection of raspberry and blackberries he already put on a plate. He prepared a cup of coffee as two slices of bread got crispy and warm in the toaster. By the time he returned to his seat and spread butter and jam on his toast, Mr. Dobby was already sitting in the seat to the right of Draco’s, a pen and a yellow legal pad directly in front of him. “Why don’t you eat and talk while I take notes and then you can make a decision based on that later.”
[from Hermy 6:04] Blaise says, of course! He’ll give me like a 20 min head start before he joins us
[from Scarface 2:03] she brought her stupid cat again this year
Blaise asked, “What took so long?” before grabbing the closest glass to him and taking a sip.
. I know for a fact that you’ve read that Stephanie Meyers book at least a dozen time, so don’t even talk.”
Harry and Hermione all but tackled him back into the elevator, hugging him with such enthusiasm that he felt his body press against the back wall. Hermione’s hair somehow managed to make its way into his mouth, but Ron didn’t mind. There was some squealing and jumping before the three of them detached themselves from each other so that Ron could press the (3) button and send them up to his floor. Harry kept his right arm around Ron’s shoulders while Hermione held onto his waist from the left side.
“Yeah me too, Krum on a stage is a dream…”
“Okay, see you soon!”
“You do too,” Draco replied as Harry walked loudly through the door with Krum and Cedric behind him. Ron’s eyes immediately jumped to his boyfriend as he came into the room. He beckoned the man over with a wave of his hand, but Krum moved to put the bags he was carrying down on the coffee table first.
Ron changed position so that he was no longer laying on his back, but on his side, fully facing Draco. Draco chose not to mirror him, but kept his head turned towards his friend.“Yeah it is… and actually, maybe that’s a good segue into what I think you were getting at before with your questions, which is that, yeah by the middle of last year, most of the people in this group find physical comfort with each other. Krum and I ended up in an exclusive romantic relationship, but we are pretty open to people joining us in other ways. I think there are a few people who are bit more reserved, like Hermione, but overall, we’re pretty close to each other.”
“Hey, what’s up?” Ron asked as he walked past to set his bag down by his bedroom doorway. He then walked to sit in one of the chairs facing Draco.
Remus inclined his head, “Puddifoot’s is just around the corner.”
Harry dropped into a chair suddenly next to Draco, causing him to flinch away from the sudden movement.
Draco walked back down the hallway to Ms. McGonagall’s office once more, this time a little lighter on his feet and a bit more confident, carrying his open laptop with him. She called for him to come in when he knocked on the door and she seemed to notice his change in energy, and smiled at him.
Blaise folded up his unused folding chair, slipped it into its bag, and pulled the strap over his head. He and Hermione watch grabbed one of the bean bags and wished everyone a goodnight before stepping out of the dorm. Harry waited with Cedric as Krum walked quickly into Ron’s room to grab his clothes from the day before and the hat Ron’s mom made for him. Draco tied off the trash bag after making sure that all the debris from their marathon was gone and handed it to Harry.
“We got everything!” Cedric was saying to the general room, “candy, chips, ice-cream for later - hope you don’t mind if we use your freezer Ron, figured it wouldn’t be a problem. Oh, and some things called Cauldron Cakes,” he lifted his left arm, as if to show off the cake buried deep within the selection of grocery bags hanging off of it,  “the Honeydukes owner, can’t remember her name, lovely woman, though, said they were the new dessert of the season! And the sample she gave us was delicious.”
“It’s totally fine if you don’t want to,” Blaise said, brightly, “just seemed like you might be into it.”
“Find everything alright?” Ron asked as Draco laid his plates on the table in front of a chair two away from Krum.
Harry sighed, slightly frustrated at himself at his lack of self-control the night before, “yeah, you’re right.”
“Have sex with a girl probably,” Harry let his embarrassment flood his face, before smiling with a small twinge of sadness.
Throughout the next half hour, others trickled in alone or in small groups: Harry with Ron, Luna, Blaise, and Cedric with Krum. Neville informed them that Seamus would be joining them later, but he wasn’t sure whether Dean was going to make it or not. Harry made room for himself next to Draco, with Ron on the other side of him. Only Luna was able to fit at the table they were sitting at, so Cedric pulled a table from another study room into theirs and made it bigger. Hermione protested that the other study room would need the table, but Cedric just shrugged and promised that if someone came looking for it, they could give it back. After that, everyone was quiet, the sounds of rustling papers, typing fingers, scratching pencils drifted through the space absently. Luna had headphones over her ears and bounced a little in her seat to whatever she was listening to in such a carefree way that Draco was quietly jealous of whatever she was listening to that allowed her both focus and fun.
“Thanks,” Draco said, but Blaise shook his head at him, and pointed at himself as if to so ‘I’m better than she is, talk to me instead’ but also in a way that was a lot more suggestive of other things. Draco smiled in acknowledgement and glanced over to Luna who was daintily demolishing a very random assortment of food - chicken, sliced nectarine, and two slices of bright orange American Cheese to name a few.
“And the hickies on his neck,” Hermione asked, “you don’t mind?”
Draco smiled, thinking about the messy-haired, green-eyed man, “Harry sounds like a good friend.”
“Yeah. No strings,” Blaise said, though Draco wished he maybe framed it another way. People in movies said ‘no strings’ but there were already so many strings. It was like Blaise could see Draco’s skepticism forming, when he continued, “I mean it though, I like kissing my friends, and I don’t expect anything else from them, other than, obviously, friendship. But I completely understand if that’s not how you do friendships. I asked because I wanted to know, yes or no and either way, I want to be your friend. I won’t think any differently about you or what our relationship is.”
“Yeah,” Harry grinned, “did you see how red Draco’s lips were?”
“Oh,” Draco wasn’t sure how to respond to that, (especially since the class had been short and with no content - auditing classes wasn’t unfamiliar to him, but to do so during syllabus week seemed odd), but he didn’t have to.
“Of course, least I could do!” Sirius said dismissively, glad that Remus seemed to enjoy the chocolate treat, he pursued the conversation once more, unwilling to let it die off yet, “Interesting, what subjects do you teach?”
Draco blushed in embarrassment, he hadn’t meant to disturb Harry, but nodded despite himself. Harry grinned over at him before making his way over to the couch and plopping down.
The other documents in this letter are for you to fill out if you decide to return in a few weeks for the Fall semester. Please mail them back as soon as possible or fax them to our admissions office.
“I’m actually not sure,” Draco responded thoughtfully, “It’s all very interesting, and the idea of studying would be nice, but I think I’m more interested in history, but I haven’t picked a concentration yet. I guess I’m hoping the history class I’m taking this semester, that Harry’s taking as well, might help me figure it out.”
Draco had turned in for the night earlier than he figured he would have if he was normal. On the way back to the dormitories, Draco happily exchanged numbers with Hermione and Blaise and waved goodbye to everyone except for Ron and his boyfriend once they arrived at their hall. He wasn’t all that surprised that Krum followed Ron up to the dorms, but felt awkward about it. He didn’t know either of them very well wasn’t sure how he felt about them doing things in the room next to his. He just hoped he didn’t have to hear it. Upon arriving at their dorm, Draco separated quickly from his two companions and made his way into his room. He saw Ron and Krum head into Ron’s.
“I just think it’s funny. I mean when I was younger I definitely thought he looked older, but now it’s obvious they just changed his fucking hair style!”
“So Draco,” Blaise called from across the table, effectively cutting into the other conversations that were happening, “tell us what classes you’re taking. I wanna see if we have anything together.” Draco blushed slightly under the attention, but managed to give an answer without embarrassing himself.
“No that’s ok, I wanted to wait for you guys - I mean folks - anyway and besides, it’s not like it matters if it gets cold or anything,” she said. It turned out that they didn’t have to wait very long for their food and a few minutes later, they all began to eat. Draco hungrily bit into his sandwich, glad to be filling his body with its first meal of the day. From the corner of his eye, Draco noticed that Harry was making short work of his own food, scarfing it down as if it were the last meal he would ever eat, and wondered to himself if maybe the behavior was exacerbated not just by being friends with another messy eater, but something else as well. He personally took a painfully long time to eat even a small amount of food when he was in public, just like his parents taught him to be: polite, neat, and never a completely empty plate. He never much minded, but he quietly speculated over his BLT about what his eating habits would have been like had he been raised in a different environment, without the pressure of being the sole heir of a well-respected family.
“Hey, so, I was hoping maybe you could help me,” Harry began, before wiping his mouth with a napkin and taking a sip of water. “Draco’s been really stressed out about Midterms coming up and I want to try to help him, but I’m not sure how. I thought you might be able to think something up with me.”
[to Krumcake 2:12] also i got you a ~present~ come over soon so i can give it to you
Draco inclined his head in acknowledgement and popped a berry into his mouth. He hummed to himself as he chewed, formulating  his thoughts on the matter at hand. “Can you make two columns, a Pro one and a Con one?”
Hermione wondered for a moment about Draco’s sexuality because the way he acted with Tonks and what he was saying about his friend Pansy pointed to him being straight. But the fact that he was taking a queer history class didn’t seem like something a straight guy would do except for gen-ed requirements or something like that. So she thought maybe he might be bi. It was a bit weird, trying to figure out someone’s sexuality that she barely knew but it wasn’t like she didn’t do that all the time. Or that other people didn’t do all the time. Hermione had always been the token straight friend so it wasn’t a rare thing for her or her friends to talk about sexuality because they were always so open about their preferences and experiences. In her own experience, straight people were usually more guarded about their sexuality, because they assumed that everyone was straight and it wasn’t something they needed to talk about and it wasn’t a problem for them, a privilege her non-straight and non-cis friends didn’t have. It was something she learned early on when she met Ron and Harry but didn’t realize was a thing until she had her a short-lived boyfriend in eleventh grade who wasn’t interested or comfortable in discussing sexuality and sex the same way she was. Hermione didn’t want to assume anything about this new addition to the group, though, but she did wonder. It might be nice to have another straight person around who was aware of these things. Lavender was nice, but she didn’t get as along well with Ron and Harry as Hermione had hoped. But she recognized that Draco could very well be queer, just because he mentioned a girl and flirted with Tonks didn’t really say anything about him. Harry tended to flirt with anyone without even realizing it and he was always quick to announce how astoundingly gay he was. It was nice to think about, though, having a straight friend who would understand but Hermione didn’t want to get her hopes up, not that she would be all that disappointed if Draco turned out not to be straight….
“I guess we didn’t really need all the extra chairs, did we?” Blaise said, eyeing the two empty chairs (one Ron’s and one the folding one he brought).
“Well I thought Deadpool was a good option. I mean I don’t really know what kind of movies you guys like, but that is of one of those movies that are good for a group. That, or maybe we could watch a few episodes of Bob's Burgers - can’t go wrong there.”
[to Scarface 2:14] kk on the way
[to Sprog 2:25] harry! Got here about half an hour ago, taking some time to walk around and see where you spend your waking hours.
“Are you interested in women’s studies?” She decided to ask instead, hoping to get some answers about her other thoughts surrounding this new person in her life. Draco moved onto his last box to unpack which ended up being a tiny refrigerator, smaller even than the one that Hermione and Parvati were sharing this year. It looked like the one her father kept in the basement full of beer and batteries because it was too small to hold anything else.
Having lost himself in his thoughts, Draco started slightly when he heard a phone ring loudly, cutting through the quietness of the coffee shop. Krum smiled apologetically as he stood to answer his phone and walk out of the building.
“Well!” Ron said, sitting down heavily on the couch, “that was nice.”
“I’m a professor here, I teach several classes. You caught me just as I was heading out of my last one for the day.” A server brought their drinks and pastries. They both thanked her politely. “Thank you, this is lovely,” Remus directed at Sirius, taking a careful bite of the croissant.
Ron sent another text to Krum as he walked out of the dorm-room after he told Draco he was going to go let his friends in. Draco waved him off, distractedly, focused on the array of posters Ron saw that he had lay out on his bed through the open door to his room. Walking down the hallway and getting into the elevator seemed to take forever. He tapped his foot impatiently on the thinly carpeted floor, waiting for the double doors to open and let him on the ground floor of the building. He barely had one foot through the silver moving doors before he was ambushed by two of his favorite people in the whole world.
“Yeah, and I mean, it really hasn’t been all that bad. The first week of classes went by really smoothly - though, admittedly, it’s only syllabus week, so who really knows - and I’ve made a couple of friends since I got on campus, which I guess was about two and a little weeks ago.”
“Yeah, more than” Ron answered, his voice breathy and dripping with want, “Oh wait!” he said suddenly, sitting up. He twitched a little at the finger pressing into him. Krum pulled it back and rested his hands on the top of his own thighs, giving Ron a questioning look. “I just wanna take the quilt off the bed, I forgot to fold it up earlier. I don’t really want to have sex on a blanket my mom made for me.”
[from Scarface 2:05] hermy says to stop txting cuz well see u soon
[from Hermy 6:01] Blaise just texted me and asked about dinner too. Is it ok if he joins us?
.” Draco watched as he lifted his eyebrows in a ridiculous manner and laughed.
Phone in hand, Sirius stood up from the table, “Good! Thank you. Well, I’d better be off.”
“Yeah, but that’s okay,” Krum said, “I want everyone to know how much I love you, even if we gross ‘em out a bit. They don’t really mind, though. Well I don’t know about your new roommate, but everyone else is -”
“He didn’t use to be like this, you know,” Hermione said pointedly to Draco, “Harry learned his bad habits from the red-haired devil sitting across from you, or at least that’s what his mom says. Don’t let Ron’s lack of barbaricness now convince you otherwise.” Harry began nodding again enthusiastically and Hermione told him to swallow his food before he choked himself. Draco picked at his food, letting their conversation wash over him in a comforting way. He was a bit dazed at how accepting of him they were already, but it didn’t feel wrong, just new and different.
“Oh, Draco,” Pansy sighed, even through her emotional mask, Draco knew that expression and how much she wished they were in the same place so she could play with his hair or give him a hug or just be in the same
Hermione explained quickly, “They’re pretty inseparable, but they’re cute. Krum’s a nice guy and you’ll probably see him a lot.” Harry nodded along with her words as the door opened and Ron came in, dragging a beautiful, very athletic looking man in by the hand. Draco would have assumed he was one of those douche jock types if he had seen him on campus, but now that he knew his friends a little better, he wasn’t really sure what to assume at all. He watched as Harry and Hermione jumped off the couch and squish Krum into a hug. It was an endearing sight especially when he noticed that Ron continued to hold one of Krum’s hands while the other was occupied with hugging Harry and Hermione back. When they let go, Krum looked around and noticed Draco. They smiled at each other politely as everyone moved back into their seats, Krum sat on the floor at Ron’s feet.
Ron nodded slightly at him and asked, “Maybe should get to know each other a bit better later, when everyone is gone?”
“Okay,” Draco said a bit hesitantly, but he set his bag down on the opposite side and followed Harry over to the buffets. They split up after that, in search of different kinds of foods. By the time Draco made his way back to the table with two plates full of food, Harry was already sitting down and Blaise was with him.
“Remus Lupin.”
“Of course I am, Pans, I just didn’t know how to talk about it before and I still don’t know.”
“Hi,” he said, “what’s up?”
“Maybe give me an overview? Or I could guess? But making assumptions tends to be not the most helpful things…” he smiled sheepishly.
In the week following the phone call, Draco split his time actually readings the some of the books scattered around his room, caving into watching Netflix, and anxiously checking his suitcases to make sure he had everything he would need. He tried to reassure himself that because the mansion was close to the school, he could always drive back to it and get what he forgot, but the thought of leaving this home tied his stomach in knots every once in awhile - and he had to make sure. The new worlds he read and watched took his mind off most of it and the food that Mr. Dobby had started to bring to him, either in his room or the entertainment room, helped made him feel more substantial. Draco hadn’t asked his butler to do this, but allowed him to without protest once he started. He figured that this was just Mr. Dobby’ way of showing that he would miss him and left it at that.
“Yeah. And, um he/him pronouns for me,” Draco said quickly, making sure that he answered the question. She nodded to him.
“Mr. Malfoy, I understand that you are nervous. It’s good that you came in to talk in person. Maybe next time, it would be wise to write down questions that you have before setting up a meeting. As I wrote in my letter to you earlier this month, this University is a small one and we like to take care of our students, so don’t worry too much. Why don’t you go back into the waiting area and take some time to sign up for classes? After that, you can come back in here and we can close this meeting up. The main thing to remember, Mr. Malfoy, is that we want to make sure this transition is as painless as possible. So take your time, and breathe.”
Ron called over to Draco who had begun to unpack his stuff, “I have a few friends coming over to say. I hope that’s ok.”
Draco returned Harry’s phone and thanked him. They walked in silence for a few moments. He realized that he hadn’t really been paying attention to where they were going - he was watching the things around him, but zoned in on the small exchange so much that he was surprised when they turned a corner on the sidewalk and were only a few steps away from the coffeehouse.
“Okay so let’s talk about it!”
“Do you mind sticking in a dumpster on your way out? I’m sure there’s one nearby,” He asked, feeling a bit awkward, but not sure how else to ask Harry to do something for him. He needn’t have worried, though as Harry just smiled at him and said, “yeah, sure.”
“You and Draco seem to flirt with everybody,” Hermione remarked about half an hour later as she and Harry walked slowly around campus, content to burn some free time along with a few calories before heading back to their different dormitories. He brushed off the comment and asked her whether or not she wanted to go to the clearing in the woods and get high but she pointed out that both she and Harry were tired enough that if they went to Hermione’s dorm to get her bowl and the little canister of weed she kept tucked away in a drawer, he would probably just end up sleeping on her bed rather than going back out. He smiled and agreed with a bit of a blush on his cheeks and suggested instead that they keep walking around a bit before heading over to hers, which they did. They were walking slowly and swapping thoughts as they came, trading gossip and stray ideas here and there.
“Well, I always like the vibrator,” Ron said, grinning a bit at that. “I don’t think I’ll know though for real until we try it out - if you want, obviously.”
“Nice,” he said, and then mimicked Draco’s grimace. “I’m mostly done with all of mine, thankfully.”
“So you’re the new roommate. I’m the boyfriend,” Krum introduced himself, “my first name isn’t actually Krum, if you were wondering, it’s Victor, but nobody calls me that. He/him pronouns, by the way.”
Harry shook his head. “You know I usually don’t mind those kinds of things. And anyway, like I told you before, whatever my feelings towards Draco are, they don’t include feeling bad about him flirting with other people. Why though? Do you mind? I know you have a bit of a thing for Blaise.”
“What kind of music do they play?”
They kissed several more times, the still air of the study room quiet but for the small sounds of their movements. Draco found it pleasant, and the tense thoughts in his head beginning melting away. Blaise’s soft, full lips were warm and wonderfully insistent against his own; his hand that had been at Draco’s chin slipped down and around to the nape of his neck, which almost felt like an anchor to Draco’s buzzing mind.
“So it seems like Draco and Blaise got it on yesterday,” Hermione said, glancing at Harry over a cup of coffee. She and Harry were at Madame Puddiffoot’s in the late morning the day after the first group study session they had prepared. Before she mentioned this, they briefly discussed the event in general and congratulated themselves on a study session well executed.
Harry nodded, which Draco saw out of the corner of his eye. “Yeah, that makes sense. I’ve ordered all my books already, but that’s just because I can’t afford to wait and have the prices go up. There’s a nice online bookstore that sells textbooks for cheap, so that’s where I get mine. Most of them came in the mail already, but I still have a few on the way.”
A knock on the door brought Draco out of the comfy, hazy, nothingness his head was filled with to the reality of the day. He jumped a bit at the sharp noise, disrupting the mess of fabric around him, and fumbled his way out.
Pushing these thoughts away, Draco made the decision to masturbate in the shower and not in bed like he would have normally preferred. Even if he was in a room by himself, it was still new and uncomfortable. He stepped a little bit away from the spray of the water so that it was still warm on his back, but so that it wouldn’t wash away the body soap that he used as like lubricant to move his hand smoothly up and down his cock. He took his time, squeezing at his head and thumbing over his slit, teasing himself and enjoying this simple, familiar pleasure. When he felt it building and the tell-tale ache in his lower abdomen, Draco turned around back under the water as he came, breathing deeply through his mouth, letting some of the cascading water in. He watched his come and the soap mingle together on the floor of the shower, before being swept quickly away down the drain. Draco gave himself a moment to collect himself, feel the hot water on his skin and against his oversensitized body.
“Yeah. Pretty standard - I’m going home for a few days and then the Weasleys.”
Ron nodded seriously at him and reached forward to get a bit of ice-cream for himself. “I guess we can start by talking about the space, like how we want to share it, you know? I’ve never had a dorm with a single before.”
Fifteen minutes later, Luna rose from her chair and left the room, not fully closing the door so she could get back in without requiring anyone to open it for her - she returned after some time with a cup of coffee and a blueberry scone. Seamus and Cedric were quietly quizzing Dean on a study guide that he had filled out previously. Draco considered asking someone near him to quiz him on his newly made flashcards from before, but didn’t want to disturb anyone, especially when all the people at his table looked particularly engrossed in what they were doing. He elected instead to focus on another subject of study and promised himself that he would ask someone for their help when they weren’t too preoccupied with preparing for their own exams.
“It was ok, stange obviously, but it was nice to start getting in the swing of things, you know? How was your first week back?”
A thicker letter caught his attention as he made his way through the small mountain of envelopes. It was from the Hogwarts University, better known as the HU, where Draco had taken a leave of absence for an undefined amount of time from once he no longer had a living family and found himself unable to focus on his studies. Draco gingerly picked up the letter and spun it around in his hands before letting out a huff of air and tearing it open. Inside was a series of documents that he slowly unfurled on the table before him.
“That’s a good idea thank you.” Draco responded, watching as Harry retrieved the office supplies and sat back down. “I was a freshman here a little less than two years ago, so I went through the signing-up-for-class thing before. I uh…” Draco’s words faded away as he tried to formulate a response that did not require talking about his late parents as being a reason for not returning after one semester, “I just spent some time away, but I’m back now.”
“That’s really nice of you, Luna’s really talented but people sometimes let her weirdness get in the way of them being friends with or even friendly to her,” Harry said thoughtfully as he stepped in front of Draco to open the door to the dining room, holding it for Draco to walk through before following him inside. “Let’s find a table and drop our stuff off and then get food? So we don’t have to carry our bags around.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I already took Stat, but I can help tutor you if you want,” he said, “I was really good at it.” Draco was sure Blaise was good at a lot of things, but elected not to say as much as he watched the darker man lean back into his seat.
Ms. Minerva McGonagall
“Thanks Ron,” He said, before continuing to expand, “and yeah, no, nothing weird or bad happened. I just had a lot of thoughts that came out of it. And I thought you might be a good person to talk to, seeing as you and Harry and Hermione are kind of the center, and you have an established relationship. I figured you might have a more holistic viewpoint to share.” Draco talked with his hands, but only noticed them in his peripheral vision, his eyes trained evenly on the bumpy white texture of the ceiling above.
Going to dinner with them was strange and nice for Draco. He had thought about getting a sweater before they left, but hadn’t wanted to riffle through his suitcases in order to find one he wanted to wear. The Great Hall was warm when they walked in, thankfully, and they went directly to the lines of people waiting to get food, Ron reassured Draco that they would get a table once every had their food. At first the amount of options was overwhelming and Draco found himself missing the food that Mr. Dobby brought him that he hadn’t been required to think about. But the people who worked serving the food were pleasant enough and Draco was able to find the salad bar hidden behind the various buffet tables. Draco filled up two plates easily with chicken and rice and an assortment of vegetables before he started trying to find the people he came in with. He walked slowly through the different sections of seating, checking tables and couch clusters to find a familiar face.  He nervously twisted his head left and right, before he finally saw Ron and Krum sitting at a circular table with an arrangement of empty chairs. When they spotted him as well, Ron waved him over.
She paused before speaking, as if she wanted to chose her words carefully for him, and she probably did. He knew that she didn’t want him to feel guilty about their lack of correspondence, but his life and his choices did not exist within a vacuum and they affected her as well, to some extent. At the very least, she was his best friend who had a right to know what was going on his life and be able to help him through it. He knew all that, but was glad she took her time before sharing her next words - the words themselves not being that important, but her understanding of him and what he needed to hear was, to show him that she truly was a friend of him and was someone he could rely on. “It’s ok, love, but I didn’t want to push you too much before, and now to see that you’ve managed to change you life so completely is startling. I just want to know how you are and how I can fit in. The drama and ridiculousness of my life can wait a bit until we talk more about
“I understand.” Blaise assured him. He then leaned over and pressed his lips to Draco’s slowly, giving him the chance to pull back. Draco met his kiss with tentative eagerness. It really had been quite some time since he had kissed anyone, and did not want to do it wrong.
“You don’t have to, if you don’t want, but we talked about this kinda thing a little at the end of last semester, so I thought I get one just in case, you know, just to see. I’ve tried it on a few times, to see what it was like, with a vibrator in me.” Ron’s words came out in a rush, but not a nervous one which Krum was relieved to note.
Hogwarts University
“What can I help you with, then?”
Draco gave himself a moment to turn those words over in his head. He took a deep breath, in through his mouth, out through his nose, and looked down at his hands, which were knitted together in his lap. “I think maybe I’d be interested in kissing you, then,” he said, slowly.
Just as Hermione was going to respond, her phone started ringing. When she looked down at it, she saw that is was Blaise and politely excused herself from Draco’s room to answer it.
“This is me,” Luna told him as they neared a tall building, “See you around, Dragon.” And before he could correct her, she walked off, her bright backpack octopus seeming to wave a goodbye to him as she disappeared through a heavy door. Draco stared after her for a beat,  bemusedly off-kilter, before deciding to head over to the Common Room to kill the time before his next class.
Most of the decorations that Ron put up were ones that Krum had seen before in the room he had last year at Gryffindor Tower, but there were a few new ones. He also had a new bedside table - not the makeshift stack of crates as a semblance of shelves that Harry made for him when they were in high school - but a real table with two wooden drawers. On the top of the bedside table, along with the framed pictures that Ron usually placed upon it, there was a new photo. It was of the two of them, sitting close, bundled in the scarves and hats, smiling at each other. Hermione had taken the photo when they weren’t looking because they were too captivated by each other to notice her or the Chudley Cannons ice hockey game they were there to watch. Krum felt a warmth spread through him, as he looked at the framed photograph. He didn’t even know that Ron had it or had taken the time to print and frame it. Looking at the other photos - one of Ron’s entire immediate family, one of Hermione, Harry, and him, and one of the Weasley family’s dogs, Hermes, who died two years ago, and Pig, who was still just a puppy - Krum realized that Ron counted him as part of his family.
