“Oh,” Malfoy says, and then smiles. His smile is like a burst of sunshine, radiant and warm, and it almost hurts Harry to look at him. Then Malfoy says, “Me too.”
Every single one of the Aurors spins around at the sound of his voice, wands out and pointed at him, and he takes an alarmed step back.
!” Pansy exclaims, at the same time that Blaise drawls, “Yes, yes he did. The first task of the Triwizard Tournament, I believe.”
“Why is this our problem, exactly?” was Robards’ exasperated reply when Harry burst into his office, waving the newspaper.
“Yes. Well, turns out his aim is a lot better than I thought was possible for a withered wizard pushing a hundred. He managed to set off one of the wards with one of his spells, and I touched it before I realised.” Malfoy gives a humourless laugh. “Delayed spell damage. It affects the healing process. The Healers say it should clear up within the week.”
“Oh, well. Alright then,” Draco says, trying to play it cool. He knows he hasn’t succeeded because there’s a wide grin on his face, and Potter’s smiling back at him. On his shoulder, the dragon’s begun nibbling on his ear.
Cheng Wu nods. "Our side’s ready to make the announcement. They were jumping at it actually, since the day they were captured, my Minister’s been impatient to announce that we’ve managed to round up some of the Sun Yee On. Now it’s just up to you."
"Fine," Draco says with a calm sense of fatality, and expects the entire lunch to blow up in their faces. It comes dangerously close; Weasley makes little snippy remarks, and Draco finds himself falling back into that insolent manner that he used to put on in school, and Potter gets cross with the both of them.
"Well?" Fossey demands once the door’s shut and they’ve cast multiple Silencing and Repelling charms on every conceivable means of entry.
They end up standing in front of a long row of collars in various shapes and fabrics and colours, and Draco immediately zeros in on a tasteful green leather collar trimmed in shimmering silver, which Harry vetoes on the spot.
Harry doesn’t say anything. He waits, watching Malfoy twist his hands together in a nervous gesture, until Malfoy finally says, voice low and hesitant, “I don’t want to make a mess of things again. You understand right? We’re… we’re friends, aren’t we?”
They fall into step with each other, and they walk in silence for a while, until Potter finally clears his throat. "I erm—so there’s probably some things I should explain."
“I thought it would be nice if we could play a game with Teddy,” Potter says quietly. He pauses, then adds, slightly hesitantly, “Together.”
“You’ll learn to appreciate my genius in time,” Malfoy says, passing him the quill. Peacock, of course. Harry rolls his eyes at the ridiculous ostentatiousness of it, but he takes the quill and signs the damn document.
“Oh shit,” Harry says, just as the glass slips out of his fingers and hits his leg before shattering on the floor. There’s a large wet patch on the calf of his jeans, and Malfoy’s staring at him, visibly annoyed.
Malfoy fidgets with his notebook, but brings out an old version of a Pompion Pumpkin Latte that Harry knows he had perfected two weeks ago.
Ron had said nothing, and merely gave him a look. But Harry had gotten the hint, and had restrained himself the next time London was flooded with gossip that Malfoy was involved in black market trafficking. Illegal potion ingredients, or so the story went. Harry quietly investigated and didn’t tell anyone what he was up to, and had gone on investigating the next few iterations of rumours of
"Great," is what Draco is about to say, when a faint wind abruptly blows through the warehouse, smelling strangely reminiscent of rain. At the far end, the dragon scales clink gently against each other, moving in the wind. A sharp shiver runs down his spine at the same time, fierce and unexpected. The glass vial slips out of his suddenly leaden, nerveless fingers, and smashes against the floor with the lightest of tinkles.
"I—yes, absolutely, please," Draco breathes back, nonsensical in his desire, biting down on Potter’s thumb, "Merlin,
"Oh right," he says stupidly, still in a sleep-deprived haze of confusion, "terribly sorry. Right. I'll leave you to your cupboard then." And he shuts the cupboard door on Potter's face once again. Behind the closed door, Potter makes a sound like he’s dying, and then the door abruptly opens.
He thinks that’s the last that he’ll see of Potter, and doesn’t understand why he feels strange about it. They don’t owe each other anything, and it’s not as if they’re friends–they just grab the occasional breakfast and save each other’s lives every now and then, that’s all. And so what if he’s come to enjoy Potter’s company, and has gotten used to Potter’s shocking habit of flinching his food–it doesn’t mean anything.
Potter watches him approach with the Horntail flying overhead, his face carefully blank. The dragon lands right next to where Potter’s still clutching his fork, and headbutts his knuckles in  a greeting before gnawing on it.
They stay like that until the multiple cracks of people Apparating in reverbs throughout the warehouse, and Draco’s so relieved for the distraction of a fight and the chance to get away from Potter’s warm arms that he almost doesn’t mind the very real possibility of dying. He feels Potter tense up, and then Potter’s urgent voice in his ear, whispering instructions to
Potter takes a step forward, bridging the gap between them. Draco eyes him, watches Potter’s throat work as he swallows nervously. "Draco, I’m sorry about—about what happened. That’s not—I mean, I never wanted— "
Sirius is walking around, double-checking checking the windows and casting wards on the door, and Remus leaves him to it. He kicks off his shoes and shrugs off his cloak and begins the process of getting ready for bed.
Everyone is quiet, all of them straining their ears to hear, and none of them even bother to pretend to work. Potter protests his innocence and swears up and down that he isn’t an Auror plant, here to steal their cases and claim credit.
“Oh,” Malfoy says, flushed pink with pleasure. He smiles at Harry again, the uncertainty dropping away, and something warm blooms in Harry’s chest. He watches as Malfoy turns away and busies himself with turning on the taps and checking the temperature of the water as he readies a bath. There’s all manner of bottles lined up against the side of the wall that Malfoy takes and empties in. Teal-coloured foam begins to rise, streaked through with hints of silver.
Draco turns, both surprised and unsurprised to see Harry standing there, firelight glinting off his glasses. “Potter,” he says icily. “What do you want? Isn’t it enough that you and your fellow louts have already crashed this party? Have you also come to witness my downward spiral into alcoholism?”
Cheng Wu is taken aback when Fossey shoves him forward into the limelight and hurries Draco and Potter offstage, leaving him alone to deal with a press that’s going wild with all the bombshells that've been dropping today. He rallies though, just flashes another one of his charming smiles and says cheekily, "For further information on this case, we’ll be holding a press conference in Hong Kong in exactly an hour. Please join us then! That’s all for now, thank you."
“What?” Harry says, the world narrowing to a pinpoint as he looks at Malfoy. There’s a mischievous glint in Malfoy’s eye, but surely he wouldn’t be suggesting…?
Potter hums his assent around a mouthful of cock, the vibration sending a shiver right down Draco’s spine. Potter’s hair feels like tangled silk under Draco’s fingers, smooth and thick as Draco presses one hand against the back of Potter’s head. Potter gets the message, and Draco chokes out a half-strangled moan that grows progressively louder when Potter starts sucking and bobbing his head, Draco’s cock sliding obscenely between Potter’s wet lips. Potter’s cheeks hollow out every time he pulls back, leaving the head of Draco’s prick resting heavy in his mouth. Potter does something complicated with his tongue, velvet silkiness swirling around the tip of Draco’s cock in a way that makes Draco breathless, before pushing back down onto Draco’s cock.
“Besides your successful attempt in ruining my shirt, I’m fine.” Malfoy glances down at himself and plucks the wet fabric away from his skin with a grimace. Harry has to turn away at the sucking sound the material makes as it parts from Malfoy’s skin. “Don’t Scourgify that, by the way.”
Pansy flaps a dish towel at him, but she’s smiling, and once Potter’s divested himself of his truly lengthy scarf and coat, he heads towards the kitchen. Draco watches Potter’s arse over the rim of his glass of Firewhiskey, and therefore misses what Blaise says until Blaise turns around to follow his line of sight, just in time to catch the back of Potter disappearing into the kitchen.
Malfoy glances at him, mouth twisting unhappily before he finally admits, “Yes. But my room is not fit for public consumption at the moment, Potter, you understand, a man’s room is his most private domain, and—”
A few Saturdays later, Harry comes in to find the most intriguing scent wafting from underneath the door.
“Let it dry, and then chuck it in the wash. A good bit of old-fashioned detergent should take care of any stains.” Malfoy’s already turned away with a beaker in hand, and has started placing handfuls of the lavender and white roses in the Amortentia. He fusses over the placement of the flowers until he’s satisfied with the arrangement, and Harry watches him and forgets that he’s supposed to do the same with the dried petals.
The shopkeeper has an amused smile on his face as he rings them up and instructs Harry on how to summon it when it wants it: “Just think of it and it’ll come,” the shopkeeper says. He hesitates, then adds a little bit too quickly, “or at least it should anyway. Dragons have a mind of their own, you know, and they’re not easily tamed. Not even miniature ones like these.”
“I haven’t, I don’t,” he begins nervously, which is how Harry knows that things aren’t right between them. Malfoy’s never nervous.
At the end of dinner, Draco hangs back until most of the Slytherins leave. Blaise gives him a wordless smirk and a knowing look before he departs with the rest of the boys, which Draco pretends not to see. He can’t help the flush that rises to his cheeks though, and sends a silent prayer of thanks that his end of the table has pretty much emptied out. Draco dawdles over his desert until his ice cream is nothing but a melted mess, and sneaks peeks over at where Potter has also hung back. There’s only Dean left at the Gryffindor table now, taking his time over the pudding, and Draco doesn’t miss how Potter keeps furtively glancing over at Draco even as he pushes his fork around an empty plate.
The front door to Pansy and Ginny’s house bangs open for the fifth time in an hour, and Draco looks up in the middle of his conversation with Blaise just as Potter sweeps in. He brings with him a cold gust of wind that swirls around the living room, which causes someone to cry out, “Shut the door!”
Harry fully expects that to be the end of whatever friendship he and Malfoy have begun to strike up over the months. He stays away for a couple of days, until he realises that Malfoy might misinterpret that as Harry believing that what he said was true after all. Finally, he steps into the shop on a Friday evening, which is when they’re at their slowest, and is surprised to find Malfoy behind the counter instead.
“The Manor doesn’t have a house-elf anymore,” Malfoy says, as they climb the staircase. “Tilly went with Mother to our villa in France. Mother needed taking care of more than I do, and Tilly was happy to go. She’s been serving the Blacks since Mother was born, you know.”
Malfoy busies himself with staring into his glass as he mutters, “50 points to Gryffindor.” It’s muttered low enough that Harry’s fairly certain that Malfoy didn’t intend for him to hear, but he did.
That had been a tiring afternoon. Old Mr Henley had not only been impossible to talk to, but was also almost blind, and had been utterly convinced that he had been besieged by thieves out to rob him of house and home. He had shouted bloody murder as he sat in his armchair and fired off curse after curse, and it had been a challenge for them to try and talk sense into him when they had spells whizzing past their heads every few moments.
The footsteps stop outside the cupboard. Time slows down as the door slowly opens. Draco’s got his wand up before he knows it, and as the light from the tip of a stranger’s wand begins to fill the cupboard, he fires off a curse straight at a startled face staring in and kicks the cupboard door open. The door knocks the stranger right in the face, and he stumbles back and goes down. Draco’s curse flies harmlessly overhead, and then all chaos breaks out as a rain of curses begin to fly towards the cupboard. The air is hot with the smell of magic, iron oxide and the tang of offensive spells.
“Always,” Harry says, opening his eyes and meeting Malfoy’s straight on. Malfoy holds his gaze and smiles slightly. He’s got a strange look on his face, his head tilted slightly as he looks at Harry, like Harry’s a puzzle that he can’t quite figure out. They look at each other a little too long, and Harry can feel his heart banging against his ribs as he smiles slowly at Malfoy. Malfoy’s the first to look away, his gaze sliding down to his notebook lying forgotten on the table, and that’s all it takes for him to snap back into business mode.
“Oh,” he breathes, slightly dazzled, because how has he not noticed how very green Potter’s eyes are? From this distance, he can see the tiny flecks of gold in Potter’s iries; can count every individual eyelash.
The sun is setting in a brilliant blaze of red and gold in the window behind Potter, and Potter looks almost ethereal in this light, his brown skin shining like a fae’s as he rolls up an old scroll and stuffs it into his back pocket. Potter’s mouth pinches together in a frown, but even that feels softer in the dying light; comes across as chiding rather than annoyance.
“Ah.” Malfoy shifts slightly, his eyes darting from side to side. “Yes, well. Alright, there might have been something that I
There’s a single moment of stillness before the room erupts into complete chaos. The air is suddenly filled with screaming, and half the people drop to their knees, while the other half lose their heads and panic and run. The Aurors are yelling out orders over the melee, but the crowd is impossible to control.
be reduced to searching for presents like we’re twelve,” Draco says indignantly, which is when Harry says, “I never had presents when I was twelve.”
The days inch away slowly until finally, Saturday rolls around. The Portraits quieten down as soon as he steps foot into the shop, which is not a good sign. All of them are watching him intently, so he goes straight to Queen V, who eyes him with a smug smile.
Malfoy says nothing as he leads Harry into the back room and past the wards into the secret room. Harry’s heart is pounding double time, and he isn’t sure if it’s because of what he drank, or because he’s finally getting past the velvet ropes and stepping foot into… a laboratory.
He closes his eyes and leans forward, and then he’s pressing his lips against Malfoy’s, feeling the shape of Malfoy’s mouth under his. Malfoy’s lips are slightly chapped from where he’s been nervously chewing on them all morning, and for one terrifying second Malfoy doesn’t kiss him back. Then Malfoy’s lips part. Harry’s hand still rests on Malfoy’s jaw, and relieved, he slides it to cup the back of Malfoy’s neck, to pull Malfoy closer to him. Harry kisses him hungrily and wonders why he hadn’t done this earlier, wonders why it had taken him so long to figure out that what he wanted had been sitting in front of him all this while.
call my Slytherin names. Second, that’s brilliant. Third, I have not been ‘holed up in here’, I have been working. You know, it’s called a job? Most people have to do it in exchange for money? Fourth, Vicky alerted me to a commotion on the premises. Fifth, this is my lab where I work, and sixth, I’m going to need you to sign this settlement deed, please.” He slides the paper on the table over to Harry with two fingers. Harry grabs it and scans it quickly, his eyes narrowing as he reads.
“Well, yeah,” Harry says, shrugging. “That isn’t exactly the first thing that comes to mind when your name is mentioned.”
" Potter says again. They both ignore him. By the end of the lunch, they’re not exactly friends, but they’re not exactly enemies either.
been compromised. A variant on a lust potion, I think. It probably isn’t as strong as it should be, since we only inhaled the vapours and didn’t drink the potion directly."
“Uh huh,” Harry says faintly, and rips his gaze away with an effort. He stands up mechanically, and dumbly follows Malfoy back to the laboratory.
It hadn’t been easy at first. It had fallen on him to be the first to reach out, writing a stiff, formal letter inquiring upon their health, and which he was sure would be ignored. So it had come as a surprise when Aunt Andromeda sent back a reply, warmly inviting him around for tea to meet his first cousin once removed.
It comes uncomfortably close to the truth, but Harry plays it off. “Right,” he says, snorting again in an attempt to cover up how his heart beats a little quicker.
Draco doesn’t react at all. “Did he?” he says blandly, and eats his dinner like his heart isn’t suddenly racing. “I really wouldn’t know.”
"Alright, but can I get my files first? I’ve got an international meeting in three days that I need to prepare for."
Harry’s startled laugh stirs something unexpected in the pit of Draco’s stomach, and his cheeks grow warm. Draco looks past Harry to survey the crowd, because Harry’s looking at him with something almost akin to amusement instead of scorn, and he doesn’t quite know what to do with that.
“Hm.” Harry scans the document, but he doesn’t understand half of what he’s reading. “I don’t understand half of what I’m reading.”
“Don’t get Draco started, but this is all Daphne’s doing,” Blaise tells her, and as one, the three of them turn to look at where Daphne’s got her arm around Parvati now, their heads bowed close together as they talk. Parvati laughs at something, and Daphne slides her hand to tenderly cup Parvati’s cheek.
A chill runs down Draco’s spine as he carefully removes the missive from the owl’s leg. The scroll is small, tight, short.
Hermione sighed in her heart. As long as Harry was happy, she can only threaten Draco again at work later!
Lucius’s eyes flicker as he recalls Draco’s incitement to disown him. The name and reputation that Draco has already made for himself. The followers, too. If Lucius ignores the fact that this
“Evil never sleeps,” Harry says, distracted. Draco’s long fingers are curled around his cup, his head tilted back as he drains the coffee, his slender throat exposed. Harry swallows hard, his gaze tracing the curve of Draco’s neck.
“You’re fine,” Harry decides after a long moment, and Draco says stupidly, “am I?” Harry blinks at him, and Draco quickly corrects himself: “I am! I’m cured! It’s a Christmas miracle!” He takes a step away, away from Harry’s warm arms and the tangled thoughts that come with them, and Harry blinks at him again, looking slightly lost with his arms now empty.
“Potter, this is—” his voice catches unexpectedly. He clears his throat, suddenly shy, as Potter steps forward into his space.
“Then I am forced to leave bad feedback!” Harry declares, and bursts into hysterical laughter. It’s not the most useful threat, but it’s the only one that he can think of right now in his state of temporary madness.
Harry sends an Owl the next Saturday, pleading illness. He gets a concerned note back, with Malfoy offering to come over with food and potions. Malfoy’s tawny owl does not look impressed as it stands on Harry’s windowsill, watching as Harry scribbles out a lie that Ron and Hermione intend to pop by shortly with both, and not to worry.
“Thanks,” Malfoy says, sounding amused. The next time when he taps Harry on the shoulder, he’s dressed in a white long-sleeved button down and loose grey pants. His hair is still wet and dripping, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to mind as he rolls up his sleeves.
"I-" Draco has never been in an actual wand fight, much less an ambush. "Yes," he says firmly, after Potter shoots him an impatient look, and the words have barely left his mouth before Potter grabs his arm and drags him into the cupboard and quickly closes the door.
Fossey gestures for them all to be quiet, and they settle down after a few more raucous moments. "Thank you all for your very sudden and enthusiastic interest in the important issue of trafficking of magical creatures," she says, very dryly, and they all laugh. "I have one more important announcement to make, and then I’ll let my colleague Cheng Wu–that’s spelled C-H-E-N-G space W-U, family name is J-I-N–take over. I’m very pleased to announce that Harry Potter has put in a formal application to transfer from the Aurors over to the Trafficking of Magical Creatures Division, and that Minister Shacklebolt has approved his request. As of today, I’m pleased to welcome Harry Potter to the Division."
“Go right ahead, Auror Potter,” Malfoy practically purrs. “You’ll find that the potions I’m brewing are fairly run of the mill, which any first year in Hogwarts should be capable of.” He waits a beat, smirking.
Then Draco sets his cup down and meets Harry’s eyes straight on. Startled, Harry quickly looks away, then down at his plate of untouched food, and hastily picks up his fork. He shovels in a few mouthfuls of food, chewing mechanically and tasting nothing. When he looks up a few moments later, Draco’s turned away, imperiously beckoning to Blaise for the coffee pot.
. No, I’m talking about Starbucks. Those greedy corporate bastards will stop at nothing to get their hands on my formulas.”
They used to giggle about the double innuendo, Draco recalls. He exchanges a look with Blaise now, both of them snickering into their drinks as Potter begins to laugh.
He ups his visits to twice a day: once in the morning before work, and a forty-five minute stakeout during lunch. He’s running out of excuses to turn Ron down for lunch, but that doesn’t deter him. Nothing does, not even when it’s Graham the Grim manning the counter on a Saturday morning. Harry looks forward to Saturdays with a particular kind of thrill that’s normally reserved for when he’s hunting down criminals: Saturdays are when he can stake out the shop for a few hours on the pretext of having his breakfast.
"Alright then," Draco says wearily, and unthinkingly, claps a friendly hand on Potter’s shoulder as he makes his way past. "Thanks, Potter. I’ll see you around."
“No, wait.” Malfoy grabs Harry’s arm. “You took me by surprise, that’s all. Wait.” He takes a deep breath to steady himself. Says, “When?”
“Oh yes,” Harry says in relief. “Yes.” He escapes the workroom in a bundle of jittery nerves, wiping his hands on his jeans as he heads out to the front of the shop. Thankfully, the table under Queen V’s Portrait is free, and he slides into the seat, burying his head in his hands. He can still smell the damn treacle tart, even over the smell of the coffee roasting.
“Selling my secrets off to the enemy, Bones?” Malfoy drawls from behind them, and Susan jumps, flushing guiltily. Harry’s ears prick up at the magic combination of ‘secret’ and ‘enemy’, and he turns. Malfoy cuts a tall figure of suspicion as he eyes them, arms crossed against his chest.
Before Harry knows it, he’s walking down the rows of empty lockers and over to the next aisle to where Malfoy’s locker is.
"Did you," he begins, then stops himself, because of course Potter didn’t. Except–except Potter’s still here, in this cramped, tired space, the only one left of his team, and all of Draco’s files have been painstakingly put back together again. Draco tries again, but he’s still bone tired, and what comes out is, "Want to grab breakfast?"
Potter starts laughing then, and the remaining students in the Great Hall turn to watch. It makes Draco feel inordinately proud that
Then Draco’s shoving him back forcefully, his hands curled into fists against Harry’s robes. “Oh, why can’t you just leave me alone,” he snarls, thumping Harry on his chest. Then Draco turns and flees down the corridor, leaving Harry behind, his heart pounding, stunned.
, Malfoy," Potter whispers, a tinge of despair in his voice, and Draco murmurs back again, "Sorry, right," and does.
cheerful—as he chatters on in that way he does when he was avoiding a subject, “Well, we were kind of busy trying to dodge all the spells flying our way. And I only brushed against the wards, so it wasn’t obvious even to me until afterwards, when some of the cuts didn’t heal properly. It was deeply fascinating of course, I’ve never encountered spell damage that took effect like that, but—”
Draco startles, and sits up. He had been so entranced by the dragon that he hadn’t heard Potter’s footsteps coming up the staircase, or noticed that the light slanting in through the tower windows had began to change.
. How dare you. You say one thing and then you go off and do the exact opposite, and what the hell is up with that, huh?"
“Looks like he’s in a bad state,” the Crying Boy says. He wanders into the side of Queen V’s frame to peek down at Harry, and is promptly chased out by a flurry of indignant shrieks from Vicky. This sets off another round of bickering between the Portraits. Harry keeps his eyes closed as he listens to them argue, and keeps on breathing in the scent of broom polish, treacle tart, and the smoke of freshly roasted coffee beans.
Malfoy says firmly, “None, Potter, so don’t be all weird about it. This is why I didn’t tell you about getting hurt, you know. You’d get all blotchy and irritated and terrify half the people we’d meet.”
Potter looks like he wants to laugh. Draco schools his face into a stony expression, crosses his arms disapprovingly and tsks at him.
So Harry gets his coffee, stops to say hello to Vicky, and then heads off to work. He occasionally comes in for an after-lunch coffee, but he doesn’t bother to stake out the shop anymore. Malfoy’s forever holed up in his laboratory, which Harry is sure can’t be healthy for him, but he knows Malfoy won’t be prised away from his work.
“Does this look like an imperial red to you?” Malfoy asks in lieu of a greeting, and Harry obligingly goes over to look.
"Hah," Potter says, and Draco can hear the smug grin in Potter’s voice as he begins to quickly pack up the kit again. "Still got it."
“He’s not wrong, you idiot,” Malfoy hisses. “Did you check the expiry date on the bottle before serving it?”
Draco turns away and moves towards the firepit. Behind him, the other children slowly get up and head to wake
Black robes covered Harry’s vision. A firm pressure pushed him back, causing him to stumble. His back hit the wall, and his head hit a large hand. Another hand slammed against the wall by Harry’s head with a “
“Yes, Madam Pomfrey,” Aster says. The two of them leave the Hospital Wing before Aster gives Draco a curious look. “What did she say to you in her office?”
Harry looks back up, standing straighter. “Oh, come on, Malfoy. It’s not like the rest of your body is ugly—”
“Look at you, look how much you want it. I bet you want to be tied up and fucked all day. Don’t you? All those officials out there. Friends of my father. If only they
An urge to lean in to kiss Harry’s forehead hits Draco hard, and he’s already leaning in before he realises. He stops just in time to breathe in Harry’s warm scent.
Harry feels peculiar. Glancing at Malfoy’s hands reminds Harry of Malfoy’s delicate work with the spells. Malfoy’s hand as he wrote on those bank transfer papers last week. Malfoy’s hand on his arm, side-alonging him.
Some authors had much more works than others (and some authors had no data at all). Authors with few works are less likely to be selected by the algorithm.
He lands on the balcony and grabs the soul orb from Harry’s hand, crushing it. He vanishes the fragments and feeds more magic into Harry.
Zabini’s soft smile remains, unruffled. “Dear Longbottom, we understand. Everyone who comes will be because they want to. Indeed, I doubt any kind of coercion is on Harry’s mind. Harry, you want to build natural, organic relationships between the students of the Houses.”
Hitchly’s eyes light up. “Mr Malfoy, how timely for you to join us...Leaving Hogwarts premises despite being a student—” The words catch in his throat as McGonagall steps through next, followed by Harry and Pansy.
They enter McGonagall’s office. Inside, McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Auror Hitchly and Auror Bartholomew are waiting for them.
here likes you,” Blaise says, with a light smile that Draco cannot be entirely annoyed at, “We—and even Hogwarts—all agreed on this.” He produces a folded up item and hands it over to Draco. “We believe this is the perfect time.”
Between the three of them, the corridor slowly returns to its original state. Rubble reforms back into the walls, dust clears from the air. Portraits are restored, their occupants returning.
When lunch time arrives, McGonagall is able to harness multiple other eighth, seventh and sixth years to help clear the rubble.
day. Sometimes I’m writing too!” Harry protested. “And I already met someone when I went out last time...”
Ben Taylor sits like a king in Gryffindor. Most of the upper years are out elsewhere—Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley, who cares; Neville Longbottom, he’s always at the greenhouses anyway; and Ginny Weasley and Parvati Patil spend way too much time in Ravenclaw.
Blaise does so, and finally summarises: “It will not work. We will continue drawing up our own plans.”
The Ministry event was on Friday the 14th, February, and Draco met with his colleagues first in the Mysteries’ tea room.
Draco then checks the staircase, finding the tripping jinx at the base of the stairs as Vaisey suspected. Juvenile and a waste of everyone’s time. Draco slices through the hex with ease. He slowly ascends the stairs, checking the fabric of magic along the way. He pushes in more of his own magic, overlaying it with Hogwarts, strengthening the fabric of magic and tightening the gaps in the weave that allow for hexes and jinxes to take hold.
Meanwhile, Draco holds the Ministry-assigned wand easily in his hand. Spells flick out, racing towards his opponent. The Ministry wand is obedient under his fingers, its allegiance slowly becoming
“Yes, now let’s listen to the Headmistress…” Garren maintains his small smile. Who knows if someone else is secretly looking at him.
The small clusters of other students they encounter on their way to Hagrid’s Hut avoid the large group of Slytherins.
Blaise explains again, and Flitwick’s expression darkens. “You’re preparing for the worse.” He sighs. “Go ahead.”
of me,” Malfoy mutters. He runs his hands down Harry’s sides, firm, hot, and right on Harry’s skin—Harry has no idea
Draco and Harry head downstairs for breakfast. Pansy is expressionless as she hands him a folded newspaper.
Wo-ow? We’re getting into the heavy plot points that I had been planning for ages, but that means less fluff ah…
DId you know that it takes me about 4 hours to write/edit each chapter? Also, this chapter was surprisingly hard and actually took 5 hours.
,” he says. “You really are…” He wants it. Even if Malfoy was a bastard of a prick (and he sort of still is), Harry would want that cock.
“All Head of Houses, your morning classes will be cancelled. For those students who would have otherwise had a class with Professors Flitwick, Sprout, Garren, and Hooch—Charms, Herbology, Potions, or Flying Classes, this morning session is a free study period. Enjoy your breakfast.”
Draco broke down that morning. It just all came crashing down on him. How little he had. How little care there was left for him in the world. He could floo his friends...but he was just a distraction in their busy lives. He could talk to his colleagues, but they were never close enough for that kind of non professional relationship.
“I am Professor Flitwick, Head of Ravenclaw,” Flitwick says. He casts a spell on the ground so that he can elevate himself up above others’ heads.
Draco breathes. Compresses Harry’s and his own magic and lets the awareness of Hogwarts flow through him.
“Unfortunately, I still require another hour on this assignment,” Draco says. “Is it that you—or Pansy—are unable to sleep without me?”
“If you believe that we Slytherins require extra help in Muggle Studies, then surely it would be better to run a remedial-style class.”
“Yes, we are all very grateful for Granger’s ability to keep you alive,” Malfoy drawls. “Weasley, can’t you be a Gryffindor and try a new dish?”
Draco’s cock makes a valiant effort to harden inside Harry’s arse. “You’re insatiable,” Draco says in exasperation. “At this rate, the skin of my fingers will age horribly.”
They all spectate for a while longer. They are about to head inside when a group of people start heading their way.
Unexpectedly, Grimmauld Place becomes a Project. Ron and Hermione stay there for a while before their trip to Australia, and Hermione fixes up the library and Ron spruces up the kitchen. Neville comes by to clear the garden, and Luna replaces all the old curtains and paints blue skies and clouds on the ceiling of one of the bedrooms. Bill and Fleur remove the old decor and certain paintings, and George and Lee Jordan put up new photos of Harry and all his friends.
“I don’t know if you can afford me,” Draco drawls, holding the cool expression. “And I’m certainly not going to buy you from your friends.”
Potter hums absently, face scrunched up in thought. Draco’s hand itches to rub Potter’s head—to grab his attention, of course—but he restrains himself.
“Hermione said...Hermione said you have to communicate,” Harry said quietly. “But Luna said that people have different languages of affection.”
Harry emerges from the crowd of students with Granger and Weasley. Draco’s heart warms when their eyes meet. He and the thestral leader head towards them.
“Are you two planning to fight in bed later?” Pansy says in a much too interested tone. “If you marry, you can both share the title.”
Draco stumbles out, unsteady on his feet. He’s focusing his magic down the bond, trying to keep his Slytherin alive.
Just like that, Jamie perks up again. “Oh yeah! Michelle, why didn’t you remind me? We have so much planning to do…”
Flitwick strokes his chin. “Yes, that is true. The students are currently not focusing on the set curriculum anyway…”
There are a lot of things Draco tries not to think about. They’re not good for everyday living: sure, he could go into a deep depression that so many people wish for him. Fuck, he
“Spread those legs now,” Draco orders. His magic traces over the joggers Harry’s been wearing during the day, and they obediently disappear and reappear in the clothes hamper.
In a fit of desperation, Nolan had done as much research as he could on his condition and his rights...only to find that the introduction of harsh laws against werewolves was in fact a relatively recent thing, coinciding with the replacement of moon-Arithmancy based understanding of lycanthropy with muggle anti-werewolf sentiment.
Draco keeps his ears pricked, breathing deeply to gather the scents around him. As he goes deeper, there is nothing out of the ordinary.
going to back down. He retrieves a cauldron and ingredients and begins working under Malfoy’s picky eyes.
Malfoy stood outside, looking the same as he did befores. In the light, Harry could now see that Malfoy’s robes were dark blue. Malfoy also didn’t seem
Something cold rushes down Hitchly’s spine. He hesitantly takes the folder that Robards holds out to him.
Parvati catches Harry’s look. “Don’t mind me, I’m going off to see my sister,” she says, and promptly leaves.
They pass by Professor Sprout walking down the stairs. They pass by Mesa Wattle frantically running down.
Malfoy? If Harry unfocuses his eyes a little, and pretends he can’t hear the growling, then it looks as though Malfoy is buried under a pile of fluffy dogs.
“Most of them, I see,” Draco answers for them. “Go study or rest, I’ll set up your new class schedule…”
He does his nightly routine methodically. It’s a Christmas eve where Harry isn’t at the Burrow. A Christmas eve without his first two friends, Ron and Hermione.
Aster summons an empty chair, glancing down at the just-started calculations scattered across River’s papers, laid out in a familiar way. With the chatter around them, Aster casts a small privacy charm.
have a good time with the first and second years. He takes a seat at the sofa near where they’re playing.
Draco realises a beat too late what he just said. Protesting that he’s not jealous...Blaise is going to take it as confirmation!
Draco looks around. They’re alone outside the front of Hogwarts castle. But Draco casts a privacy charm nonetheless, before holding out his hand.
Instead, she has to sit at the Slytherin table for dinner, for breakfast, for lunch again, keeping her words to herself, and watching Harry’s bright eyes towards Malfoy.
“Have you forgotten that Aegis attacked the castle last night? We need to first survey and fix the damage.
In the Ministry, Head Auror Robards slaps the papers on his desk. “Anonymous source?!! Fucking anonymous source? Who in the department ran to the papers?!!!”
Draco placed the book on the bedside cabinet. “How can I let my boyfriend sleep alone on the first night?”
“We can share.” Malfoy accurately cut all of them in half, revealing their stunning interior. “Shall I feed you?”
? No.” Narcissa looks down on Draco—she’s still standing while he is sitting. “It is normal for young people like you to experiment and practice with other boys, but everyone leaves that behind after leaving Hogwarts. Do you really want to ruin your own reputation along with Mr Potter’s? Mr Potter himself is the sole heir of the Potter family, he must have children too.”
Potter jumps onto the stage, holding the Sorting Hat up high. Heavy magically pressure whips around him, stirring a sharp wind through the Great Hall.
Draco’s eyes lower slightly as he bites down a smirk. The Ministry team missed so many key components required for a successful Hogwarts.
Draco grabs the table and compresses it small with a squeeze of wandless magic. He grabs the soul orb with one hand and lifts Sequoia up with the other arm. The orb starts pulling at his magic, weakening its hold on Sequoia.
Harry then rose up, one hand balanced on Charlie’s chest, the other holding Charlie’s cock against his well-fucked rim.
Draco reaches out and grabs Nolan, steering him away from the Ministry team. “Forget them. Now, are you all going to stand outside and starve, or head inside to eat?”
Draco is grudgingly case-in-point: his own boyfriend, Harry Potter, has spent more time in Gryffindor than he has in Slytherin.
The stink of something rotten hits him. At his feet are the crushed bones of tiny creatures...and in the dark, looms a large, scaly corpse. He mutters a
His bed is familiar, but the sounds are not. Even the air smells different. Instead of the clatter and snores of his friends in Gryffindor, there’s the quiet breaths of Parkinson, Malfoy, and Zabini.
“All by the power of magic, Weasley,” Draco says politely enough. “We have the office allocated for your meeting.”
“Oh, if you don’t want them, let me have them,” Harry says, reaching out with grabby hands. “Pansy, do you think you can make some extra copies?”
Granger’s eyes burn at where Draco has his arm around Potter. “Have a good Christmas, Harry,” she finally forces out.
Very carefully and mercilessly, Draco kissed, pinched, and rubbed against Harry until those vibrant green eyes became glazed with pleasure, until those lips were bitten red, that mouth parted with delicious moans spilling out. Faster and faster, Draco grinded their cocks together. It wasn’t Draco’s ideal method, but he had to treat Harry right, and slowly take apart Harry’s defenses and put them back together.
But it’s odd playing with Ron and Hermione instead of the little second years. Not to mention the gazes of the other Gryffindors, half unwelcoming, half assessing.
Harry grits his teeth and squeezes back. “So, Malfoy,” he says, smiling a grimace. “What brings you to Gringotts?”
“Oh, hey, Harry, what are you doing?” Ron wonders in. “Do you wanna go for lunch with me and Hermione? Can I have those?” He points to a bowl of Harry’s failed attempts at octopus sausages.
With gentle steps, I walk forward and raise my hand up towards the insect. The butterfly registers my presses and flutters down to sit on the tip of my pointer finger. Growing more and more curious as the seconds tick by, the school's clock in the background whispering a constant tick, tick, tick in my ears when yet another butterfly lands on my nose. This one being a light purple with golden flecks. Irritation sparks inside me as my confusion grows ever steadily.
Without realizing it, I've opened the door wider in my shocked daze. The motion catches Malfoys gaze, the world seems to slow down as I see the emotions register on his face: Shock, Confusion, Fear, and finally Anger. In less than a second, those warm puddles in his eyes are frozen over like ice. Malfoy jumps up quickly and stomps over to me, pulling me in by the collar of my shirt and slamming the door closed.
Plus, it's not like the wizarding world is all to accepting of lgbtq+ people, especially gay and lesbians, most likely due to their blood purity obsession. You can't have more purebloods if they can't reproduce since they like the same sex. Blah, blah, blah. And I'm Harry Fucking Potter, the boy who lived or whatever, people already hate me for "killing the dark lord" so piling being bisexual on top of that? No thank you. So I repress it, and it takes shape in unhealthy ways.
"His tooth is mostly healed, but he still has a bruise on his jaw and lip," Hermione informs. I sigh again and fling myself on the floor, looking up at the ceiling.
"Thank you." He says. I snap my head in his direction to see him look up at the mirror too. No malice or amusement is in his face so I choose to believe him. "And I'm sorry too, I know I haven't made your years here the easiest."
"You're one to talk," I smirk kneeing her shoulder. "Have you seen your face when you're thinking of Granger?"
I walk down the barren halls of Hogwarts, my messy hair messier than usual due to the continuous pulling. A cold sweat is slick on my skin, making my nightshirt stick to my back and soak the front. I'm surrounded by darkness except for a few lit candles every couple feet. The layout of the school has become second nature to me since I walk it every night, horrible nightmares refusing to let me sleep. It helps walking around, clears my mind and exhausts me enough to pass out. Madam Pomfrey has tried to help with potions and supplements but for whatever reason no matter what I do they won't stop.
"Oh come on!" Pansy complains, knowing my intentions as I head to the bathroom. I slam the door and pant slightly as I feel myself getting harder and harder as the seconds go by. You can clearly see my bulge through my jeans. Involuntarily I jerk my hips forward, causing my cock to rub against my pants. A wave of pleasure rolls over my body making me moan lightly.
“10?” I ask, He spanks me again making me yelp out in pain. “10 master!” I say affirmatively. I look behind me and he nods, letting me know that's what he wanted me to do. He spanks me again.
“Because my aunt and uncle will kill me. Literally.” I tilt my head to the side. “The one thing they hate more than magic is gays.” I nod understanding.
"Why do you care 'Mione, he's just a fucking fag!" I yell. She jumps up quickly and stomps over to me, grabbing me by the collar. I brace for a punch to the face, my eyes slipping close in acceptance. The hit never comes and a strange feeling of disappointment fills my chest. No, I think to myself. I need to be hit, to be punished, I deserve it. But she's pulled back, hands wrapping around her waist calmly.
I'm a horrible person. I think to myself as I trip Malfoy with my foot, sending him stumbling. Unable to hold out his hands to stop himself from falling due to him carrying a book in his right hand and holding his satchel in his left, he falls face-first on the floor. A wave of guilt passes through me but I push it down by smiling triumphantly. The hall becomes silent as the onlookers watch.
"Fine," I say with slight anger. They relax but I finish what I was saying. "As long as you tell me why you're all so buddy-buddy suddenly." They both sigh but blushes are present on their faces.
"What, that you like butterflies or cock, faggot?" I smirk but my stomach twists in disgust at my own words. Sadness flashes over his face but it's quickly repressed. His hand squeezes my throat making me gasp in fear. He could kill me right here and nobody would ever know. I probably deserve it. He grabs me by the collar and throws me down on the ground. As he reaches for the doorknob he stops and turns back to me.
Malfoy caresses my skin with his thumb and I grind against him, making both of us groan. He pulls my hair as a warning but I gasp and moan lightly, my hips grinding against him yet again. I whimper and squeeze his waist, hardly noticing Malfoys hand that was in my hair make it's way down to my kneck. The image of him choking me while he fucks me flashes in my head. I feel my cock straining against my pants when Malfoy squeezes my throat. Wave after wave of pleasure shakes my body and I feel myself cum in my pants.
I sit down in front of the mirror next to him and he finally registers my presence. He jumps back in shock but after a few seconds, his demeanor changes into a defensive stance. I roll my eyes and bring my knees up to my chest, wrapping my arms around them.
"It's hard to miss something you've never had." I smile bitterly. "I guess I'm lucky in that sense, that I never knew them. I think it would have been harder to live without them." I look over at him to find him already looking at me. My eyes flick down to his hands and the image of them on my throat pops up again, making me blush. Shit. I gulp and look back into the mirror. The me in the mirror winks at me, knowing my thoughts.
"Finally, now lets clean up before Filches next round, it's already 3 am." She smiles and the room eases up. It's not that we don't want Hermione to know what we were doing its just, how do I explain it, it's like if you family member almost caught you masturbating. It's vulnerable and embarrassing.
Suddenly Malfoy pulls away with wide eyes and looks down at my crotch and back up to my eyes. Embarrassment courses through my veins and I feel my face turn red.
"Malfoy has made up for his behavior Harry. If you'd just open your eyes and see that he's changed but you're so blinded by this petty one-sided feud you can't see that he's given up. " Hermione says astonished. I open my mouth to question her but Ron cuts me off.
"Right, best mates now." He smiles, a look in his eye I can't quite place. Hermoine makes a noise in the back of her throat as she stares at us, flicking her brown eyes back and forth. Sighing she uncrosses her arms and puts her hands on her hips in a motherly way, as if we're her children and she's explaining something.
"Okay it is what it looks like, but I can explain. I shouldn't have done that." I tell him sincerely. "It was wrong." I look at the ground in shame.
"What the bloody hell are you doing?" She screeches, her hair messy and clothes disheveled. i think I notice a mark on her neck and I smirk, looking at Pansy to see her fixing her lipstick. When no one answers her question she waves her arms.
“I promise I won’t tell.” He nods thankfully. “Uh will...will we do this again?” I ask hopefully. Harry smiles cockily.
“Three.” I reply. With every spank I yell out the corresponding number. My cock has made the arm of the couch wet by the time it’s over. I am pant exhausted and horny.
Fuck. I think to myself. I look around the circle in fear but all I see are wanting eyes glazed over with horniness. I look over at Ron and he's smirking at me, I open my mouth to say something but he pushes me in the circle. I sigh and shyly crawl into the center on my hands and knees. Malfoy stares at me with wide eyes and I squint at him.
I sadden at the thought of him. I didn't know him well, I just saw him in the halls sometimes and when I was in the stands during the tournament. From what I've seen though he was kind. What I remember most though was that this girl with blue hair with a strange name went ballistic, even more than Cho. She was screaming and crying more than anyone I've ever seen. Before he died I saw them together a few times. They were really close. It was heartbreaking to watch but it strangely reminded me of something. It was...familiar. She's a strange character, all combat boots and everything black but a heart made of gold. With her appearance, it's hard to understand how she's a Hufflepuff. What's even stranger is that she appears in a few of my nightmares, usually the most horrid ones.
Suddenly Harry rushes at me. I think he’s going to hit me until I feel his lips against mine. A rough passionate kiss full of teeth and bumped noses. I hiss as his teeth catches on my lip, cutting it open. Blood coates our tongues but I don’t mind.
The room slowly transforms into my butterfly pavilion, different coloured insects fly around leaving me in awe. It amazes me that this room can create the illusion of life. I wonder if it can create people too. Reaching out a hand a butterfly lands on my hand, its tiny legs tickling my skin. It feels real so I wonder...thinking hard I imagine someone, Harry to be exact. I think of his green eyes, his soft wild raven hair, his plump peach coloured lips. God his lips are perfect, I remember back to our kiss and think of his lips on my skin. His pink tongue against my cock.
"Attention everyone!" I hear a voice say loudly, all the chatter cuts out. I peek my eyes open and stare at Blaise, who's standing on top of a table by the fireplace. "Who wants to play a game?"
Basked in silky moonlight and warm candlelight lays a tired-looking Malfoy. His usually cold eyes are melted in warm puddles as he gazes lovingly at the butterflies sitting atop his propped up hand. His hair is splayed around him, similar to rivers of melted silver. It's strange seeing Malfoy in a regular t-shirt and pajama bottoms instead of his usual expensive attire. In fact, this whole scene is strange to me. I never would have guessed Malfoy of all people taking comfort in the room of requirements especially when it looks like this.
I'm sitting lazily on top of a blue bean bag, letting my weight sink in heavily, a cup of spiked punch in my hand. I stare up at the ceiling and I let a smile curve my lips. Whoever set up the party enchanted the ceiling to look like the stars. I let my mind drift, thinking through the events of the other night with Potter. I'm happy he apologized, this feud truly has been exhausting. When he asked me what I saw in the mirror I told him the truth, well, most of it anyways. As my thoughts wander I begin picturing his eyes. Truly an enchanting shade of green, like raindrop covered trees in spring. I wish I could have fully examined them the other day but he kept avoiding eye contact. Being so close to him it was hard to not look at his lips, the color of peaches. I've often wondered if they taste as sweet or if it's another flavor just as enticing. A fleeting thought of Potters's lips wrapped around my-.
Sighing, I leave the bathroom with my head held high and my hands in my pocket acting as if nothing happened. I make my way back to Pansy but find her sneaking out of the ROR with a giggling Hermione. I raise an eyebrow but smile at their antics. Flopping down on my bean bag I close my eyes and pinch the bridge of my nose. This night can't get any worse I think to myself.
Shivering with lust I open my eyes to see Harry before me, on his knees between my leg. My breath hitches as he licks over my bulge through my pants, gently massaging the tip of my cock with his tongue. This can't be real, I think as he unzips my pants with his teeth. His soft hands take out my cock and strokes it as he licks my slit, flattening his tongue against it like a expert. Moaning I lean my head back as I watch him. It feels like Harry but something is off. His eyes are too sparkly and his skin looks too soft. All and all this is just too perfect to be real.
"You tell anyone about this," He starts quietly, a threat evident in his words. "and I will make your life a living hell." Unable to keep my god awful mouth shut I respond.
"Hermione! We're talking about Malfoy here, he's the one who started it with the degrading and triggering names." I defend. She looks at me with shock on her face, confusion and amazement present.
"I'm not here to fight," I say quietly. I flick my eyes over to him. "I promise." He slowly relaxes as he thinks over my words. His shoulders are still tense and his brows are furrowed but no more anger is rolling off of him.
"Sorry guys! He bit my lip." He laughs touching his mouth gently. He looks at me as if to play along and I do. I laugh apologetically and rub the back of my kneck.
"Come on!" I say annoyed. I try not to think about what I saw in the bathroom as he snaps out of his daydream and crawls over to me until we're face to face. He continues to stare at me and I roll my eyes. I grab him by the collar of his shirt and place my lips on his. He's stiff for a few moments before he begins to kiss back. I close my eyes and try to steady my erratic heartbeat. I'm probably just nervous about all of the people watching me. Malfoys hand makes it's way into my hair and pulls softly. A shiver runs down my back and I place my hands on Malfoy's waist to steady me. Malfoy's other hand rests on my bare skin above my hip and I gasp slightly at the warmth. Goosebumps coat my arms and Malfoy pulls me against his chest, our crotches pressed together. I notice how hard I am for the first time and I tell myself that it's from watching the others kiss.
"I see a cottage, in the middle of the woods. A city skyline in the distance. Butterflies everywhere too." He smiles warmly. I look over at him, curious since that's not what I was expecting. He turns to me a playful smirk on his lips. "What? Not what you thought I wanted?"
"Myself," I answer. "Smiling, I mean," I state to clarify. "Like I'm happy." He nods understanding what I meant. "What about you?"
I turn to my right and notice another butterfly on the handle of the doorknob to a broom closet. I walk slowly over, the butterflies flying away as I approach. I twist the brass knob hesitantly as to not make a noise. When the door opens an inch I look inside, my green eyes widening as a wave of realization washes over me. Inside is a much bigger room, the walls made of clear glass, much like a greenhouse. Ivy vines and other foliage crawls up the sides and hundreds of different colored butterflies flutter around the room. Other than the moonlight and stars lighting the room is a small candle, with a softly flickering flame. The orange warmth a contrast to the silver light coating everything. None of this shocks me as much as the other thing or should I person in the room.
“What-” A hard slap comes down on my ass making me squeak. My cock grinds into the arm of the couch.
“Good boy” He says genuinely before pulling on my pants and boxers. He rubs my ass, kneading it between his fingers. I moan softly and relax into the couch. “God your ass is fantastic.” He says. I smile proudly at the complement. “Too bad I have to ruin it.” I quirk an eyebrow.
"I was taking a bloody walk!" I yell back. "What the fuck are you doing, Malfoy? " I spit venomously.
"Anyone who doesn't want to play follow me, we'll play a different game." A Hufflepuff calls, a look of relief washes over the faces of the weary and they follow her to the other side of the room. I push myself off of the bean bag and start towards the safe side of the room when a mop of black curly hair catches my eyes. Potter is being dragged over to the Chicken side by an excited looking Weasly. Automatically my body turns and begins walking in their direction. Blaise notices my presence and smirks wildly at me. I roll my eyes at him and sit next to a Ravenclaw with blond hair.
The door swings open and my reaching orgasm dies instantly. Horror pulsating through my body. I try and cover myself as the intruder looks at me, their emerald eyes widening in shock.
"Ooops." I say sarcastically. Malfoy hesitates before rolling over, my smile dropping from my face as I see blood seeping out of his mouth. His lip split and I see a tiny white shard of a tooth where his face landed. He looks up at me. Cool blue meeting green. His eyes are those pools of water for a second, a look of disappointment clear. I'm about to say something, not sure what when Hermione speaks up.
My tired eyes barely register the interruption of my nightly routine. A light blue butterfly with glowing wings flutters delicately in the air. It's small wings making the softest of sounds. I raise a curious eyebrow at the strangely placed creature, wondering how on earth it got into the well-guarded walls of Hogwarts when I hear another flutter. Turning around I spot a second butterfly this one much larger, sitting against one of the stone walls.
"I...we'll see," I say finally. We fall into a neutral silence, not a comforting one or a resentful one. Just silence, each of us thinking. Suddenly Hermione claps her hands.
“You're just a slut aren’t you? Wanting it from a fucking merrage.” He scoffs as he looks at me in disgust. I bite my lip as my cock throbs at his words. “”Answer me!” He says gripping into the skin on my wrists.
When he leaves I lay on the floor in utter silence, not even the sound of butterflies fluttering around can be heard. I sigh loudly and press the heels of my hands into my eyes. I groan and sit up when I notice it. My face blushes a violent shade of red, a mix of horror, confusion, anger, and embarrassment. There, in my old stain covered grey sweat pants is a tent over my crotch or more specifically a tent caused by my crotch. My mouth suddenly feels dry and I groan in frustration as I lay back down on the cold ground, begging for death.
I sit in front of the fireplace wondering how my life could have gone if I just shut my mouth. How many potential friends I've lost, how many situations wouldn't have ended in a beating, how many bullies I could have mended things with. Why do I keep doing this? My thoughts are broken up by Hermione and Ron sitting on either side of me. We sit in silence before Ron decides to speak.
“N-no.” I stutter out, feeling myself shift into subspace. I’ve never been a sub with someone else, i’m always too scared but for some reason I feel safe with Harry.
A/N: Let me know what ya think, this is a new kind of writing for me. Lol. Anyways, I hope you have a wonderful night, day, week, month, year, and life. -Jack <3<3<3
"Your stupid butterflies were in the hall so I followed them,"  I answer exasperated.  "How was I supposed to know Mister I hate everything is secretly a butterfly loving poof? " I spit viciously, myself flinching at the derogatory name. A look of horror registers on his face before it's replaced with even more anger. In the blink of an eye, I'm shoved against the door, Malfoys hand on my neck but not applying any pressure.  Pain laces through my shoulders and my breath is knocked out of me. I stare up at Malfoy, my anger boiling to a point that I'm positive the students in the Gryffindor tower can feel the heat rolling off of me.
People begin to get up, chatting softly to each other, taking plates and cups strewn about to the trash where they disappear, no longer needed. Tired faces begin to walk out the door, one at a time until the room is empty.
"Chicken," Blaise answers making my stomach drop. Chicken is the extreme version of spin the bottle. The first person to pull away is labeled a chicken. Sometimes players have gone so far as to have sex in front of the other players.
I pant loudly in the quiet room, a lazy smile on my face that is quickly whipped off as I realize what I've just done. I look down at my cum covered hand, disgusted with myself. It's not that I'm disgusted with the fact that I wanked to a guy choking me out but by the fact that the guy was Malfoy. It's not the first time I've wanked to a guy after all even though I was taught from an early age that people like me, "perverts", have no place on this earth and are unnatural thanks to the Dursely's. I have no problem with gay people or lgbtq+ folks, but it's different for me. If I admit to being bisexual Uncle Vernon would...to be fair I don't know what he would do. His "punishment" is different every time, but I know if I came out I would get hurt. Badly.
“But first,” Sequoia Hawks says, “Were you ever going to tell us that you’re a dragon animagus? Or were we just supposed to find out in the middle of a battle with Aegis?”
Without the Ministry deadline hanging over their heads, reconstruction on Hogwarts relaxes, though the speed remains the same: the students of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor in particular
With Pansy holding onto Harry’s arm, and the soft breaths of the other three, Harry falls asleep surprisingly quickly.
“We can share!” That now decided, Harry happily licked his ice cream. It misted in the cold air outside, and after he got around the weirdness of a hot ice cream, Harry enjoyed the spiced and sweet treat.
“I do.” He leans in, but before he kisses Draco, he jumps back onto his broom. “Catch me if you can!”
“If you tell them this, they won’t be happy,” Ginny replies. “We’ll have to break it to them slowly…”
While there will always be people who don’t listen and who prefer complaining without taking meaningful action, at least some people donate to the charities while others start new initiatives such as increased aid to help new muggleborn students and their families learn about magical society, and scholarships to support muggleborn and half-blood students break into careers that are otherwise populated only by purebloods. New “muggle-experience” tours pop up, as do “magical-culture-immersion” classes.
Pansy is sitting, one leg over the other, on Draco’s desk chair. She scans over Harry’s figure. Harry immediately wraps the towel around his body.
I moan and pant until I cum. My back arching as drool comes from my lips. I pant exhausted as I feel Harry clean me up and put my pants back up. I stand up, wobbling a bit. Harry grabs my arms and straightens me out.
"Oh my god, I'm so sor-" Harry starts to say when his eyes flick down to my crotch. He blushes violently before slamming the door closed.
"Why not," I say flopping back down on the ground. Hermione pumps her fist in the air before jumping up and racing out of the common room, probably going to see the Hufflepuffs because they know how to party.
“Good boy.” Harry says rubbing my ass, I feel his lips against my hot skin and moan softly. “You did so good.” He says. I smile again and sigh in bliss as he keeps kissing my ass. I feel his hand reach between my legs and stroke my aching cock.
"We know you're not homophobic Harry," He says calmly. I stiffen at his tone. Whenever Ron's quiet or calm is when he's emotional and that's when you need to worry. "And we know you wouldn't bully someone because of it."
Once the words leave my mouth I recoil, surprised that I said all of that. I'm greeted with silence and I'm expecting him to laugh at me or maybe punch me.
“Sluts don’t get to cum.” He says, throwing me over the arm of the couch. “And sluts get punished for trying.”
Putting my hand in his hair, pulling gently as I wrap the other around his waist-pulling him closer to my body. He lets out a soft moan that's dipped in lust, making me groan. I need to hear it again so I pull harder, pulling his head back away from our kiss.
I still refuse to moan but the desire is strong, I bite my lip as I work my hand faster. An image of Malfoy biting the space between my neck and shoulder while choking me flashes through my mind and I can't help let out a low groan. Electricity makes my whole body tense, my toes curl and my back arches at an impossible angle. Wave after wave of pleasure crashes into me as I cum. I ride out my high for a while, a lot longer than I usually do. I don't stop until my member becomes too sensitive to touch.
Weasly drains a bottle of butterbeer and sets it in the middle, I notice a wink shared between him and Blaise and I have to bite my tongue in order not to gag. I don't hate their relationship it's just that they're so overly cute it's disgusting. I prop my knee up and rest my arms on it as I watch the game unfold. When it's my turn I lazily spin it, not really caring who it lands on because it won't be the person I want it to be. I follow the direction of the neck of the bottle up with my eyes and I'm met with a pair of stunning emerald ones.
"All made up! Isn't that right Potter?" A tight lipped smile on my face. When Harry doesn't respond i pinch the back of his neck, my fingers curling into his soft curly hair, always wild no mater how many times he tries to tame it. I feel his skin bristle with goosebumps as he shivers, obviously still coming down from his climax.He hums looking around before catching on and clearing his throat.
Warning: Masturbation, Choking, Self choking, slight biting, homophobic thoughts, mentions of abuse.
"We're not going to force you to not hate him and we're not asking you to like him but can you chill?" He asks.
"Then what are you doing here?" He questions. I look up into the mirror and see myself, smiling brightly, like I did the first year at Hogwarts-utterly happy and full of wonder, a genuine smile. I frown more as I stare at myself. I swallow thickly and bite my lip again, tasting copper.
Sweat coats my brow in thick beads as I work my hand up and down my length. My other hand covers my mouth to suppress any moans even though I know no one can hear me since I'm still in the room of requirements. I refuse to moan in this situation, especially when the reason I'm doing this is because of that pretentious prick. Why did he have to choke me? I think to myself angrily but the thought of hands around my throat makes me shiver as a wave of pleasure hits me. Why him of all people? I try to imagine someone else, anyone else doing that to me but my mind drifts back to that image. His cold eyes pinning me in place, along with his hands, of course, the image distorts and I imagine him placing his leg in between my thighs.
"Stop," Malfoy says quietly but firmly. She stops struggling but her anger doesn't simmer off. "Don't do something you'll regret." He tells her. She looks down at the ground and nods. Confused I turn to Ron whose also glaring, not at Malfoy or 'Mione but me. Ron steps towards her and pats her on the shoulder.
"I just want to get under Malfoy's skin," I say semi-honestly. It sounds so childish when I say it out loud.
“And what did you do earlier?” confused, I think back to before he kissed me. Right, I tried to cum.
. And I’ve combined two things that people love in December: peppermint, and Pepper-Up Potion. Potter, this is a
“What’s the problem here?” And for the second time in as many days, Malfoy looms up from the side, looking tired and irritated. He’s wearing a grey and blue flannel shirt over a white tee and black jeans with a rip in the right knee. It’s the most casual that Harry’s ever seen him, and Harry gapes at him for one astonished moment before breaking out into uncontrollable laughter.
"Thanks, but I can't take all the credit. 'Mione and mystery pranker did most of it." she says stealing my cup and taking a sip. I begin to say something when Potter walks in making my mouth fall open. My face blooms in red as my eyes scan him up and down. His hair is as messy as ever, hanging over his face and around his head in a fuzzy halo. His eyes bright in the dimly lit room. My eyes travel down to his chest and my body gets hot seeing that he's wearing a black crop top, showing off his faint outline of muscles on his stomach that leads my eyes down to his crotch. His tight black ripped jeans showing off the faint outline of his member. His pale skin shows through the rips and I notice how thick his thighs are and how round his hips are. I adjust myself, pressing on my hard-on to try and hide it.
“Yes, I'm a slut, Ma-master.” I feel myself leak precum, hearing myself say those words. He smirks as I stare at him wide eyed waiting for what he’s gonna do next. He spits in my face causing me to flinch. He takes his hand and rubs his spit all over my face making me cringe in disgust. A sick part of me enjoyed that as my cock aches to get out of my pants. Wiggling my hips I try to grind my cock against the fabric.
"Damn it." I groan as I lean against the wall. I better get rid of this quick. I think to myself before pulling my member out of my pants. I moan and bite my lip as my hand works itself up and down. My chest rises and falls quickly as I lean my head back and close my eyes. My imagination runs wild making me buck my hips into my hand, fucking into it. I think of Potter's pretty lips wrapped around my swollen cock, his wet tongue swirling around my head. Spit dripping down his chin and down his kneck. Slowly soaking that cute little crop top.
"And I thought, if Hermione trusts him then I should at least check him out. Make sure he's actually okay." Ron says, making Hermione snort.
"Right." She says with a smirk, to which Ron shakes his head. She frowns curiously at him but shrugs him off. I'm disappointed by the fact that they never told me but I understand why they didn't.
I look down at his crotch in disbelief, his bulge straining against his trousers painfully. A we spot has formed at the tip making me drool. It take every ounce of strength to not pin his legs apart and taste him, to taste his sweet cu-
I bite my lip as I squeeze my eyes shut tightly. His hands felt so good around my throat, squeezing it. I wished he squeezed tighter. I think subconsciously. When I catch the thought I reprimand myself. I shouldn't be thinking about these things. I shouldn't even be wanking right now, but I can't help it. I bite my tongue and groan, deciding to just fuck it so I can cum. I imagine him pressing his thigh into my crotch as his hands squeeze tighter and tighter. My mouth hangs open as my left-hand travels down my chin and over my kneck, I squeeze gently making my back arch and my breath quicken.
"What the fuck are you doing, Potter?" He yells murderously. The room of requirements being soundproof means he can yell at me as loud as he wants and nobody would hear him. It also means he can murder me and no one would hear my screams. Anger blooms in my chest making my face feel hot.
I should be turned off and humiliated that my crush saw me masturbating but Potter's wide eyes and blushing face sends a deep shiver down my body, making me accidentally brush my cock against my pants. I throw my head back and bite my hand hard as I cum, my hips bucking forward and my body shaking. I pant loudly as I come down from my high, my mind buzzing with euphoria. I look down at my crotch and curse when I see a wet spot. I strip off the black hoodie that I was wearing and wrap the sleeves around my waist. The cloth covering my accident. I turn on the tap and quickly rinse my hands and fix my hair. A light blush coats my cheeks and my pupils are dilated.
I decided that to make up for what happened in the ROR after Malfoy left I had to push him away, make him hate me even more so that I can hate him. That way I can bury the memories of what I did in hatred instead of shame. I know it's stupid and probably won't work but I need to try.
"Hell yeah!" A group of Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors cheer. Of course, they'd be excited, I think as I roll my eyes.
authorise any vengeance duels. I’ll have you know that I’ve had to turn people away from Hogwarts’ gates!”
Eventually, at bedtime approaches, Harry comes slinking over. “Hello, boyfriend…” he calls out coquettishly.
“I never knew you had such a high opinion of me,” Draco drawls lightly. A moment after, he frowns a little. “Or how much you noticed.”
Ron chokes on air. “Wah? No, we’re not...Merlin, if we did, Mum would hound us to get married as soon as possible…”

He’s not sure if Mr. Malfoy would agree: since the news about Aegis, he had tightened restrictions even
Draco looks down the Slytherin table; everyone else has finished eating. “Slytherins, we are leaving. Granger and Weasley, it is your choice whether or not you follow us.”
Malfoy gives him another warm smile that makes Harry feel utterly rotten. “Great. See you tomorrow then.”
“God Malfoy, you’re absolutely bonkers,” Harry says again, but he’s laughing. It’s hard not to, when Malfoy’s being so ridiculous.
“We were seized by the Ministry and put up for sale when our owners disappeared after the war, except that none of us sold. Most wizarding folk didn’t want us in their homes when they learnt who our original owners were, and the ones who didn’t mind were all in Azkaban. So it was the charity shop, or the fire. Draco bought us.” The Admiral says it as a matter of fact as he smooths his uniform down, as if he were talking about the weather and not the end of his magical existence.
Potter lets out a soft huff of a laugh as his gaze travels slowly up Draco’s body, until he locks eyes with Draco. A layer of Potter’s messy fringe falls into his eyes as he kneels there, his gaze dark and intent and full of promise.
This had been a recent development, this thing where Malfoy grew touchy every time Harry tried to heal him, where he preferred to heal his own injuries after they sparred, where Malfoy flinched and tried to hide any display of weakness around Harry. Harry had tried not to let that sting, even though the knot in his chest tightened a bit more every time it happened. They had been partners for four years now, and he had thought that they were long past their differences. It had taken some time for them to work through it, but they had eventually settled into an easy camaraderie. Malfoy, once he had relaxed around Harry, had turned out to be cheerfully chatty. He was the sort of person who tended to have an opinion about everything, and, left unchecked, would happily go on and on about all manner of things. Harry had expected it to be annoying, but instead had found, to his surprise, that he quite liked this version of Malfoy after all. Occasionally though, Malfoy seemed to catch himself and go quiet. This tended to happen if the conversation veered too close to Malfoy’s personal life, so while Harry was up-to-date on every single piece of gossip that went on in the coffeeshop that Malfoy frequented, however, he had very little idea of what Malfoy got up to in his free time.
. Maybe it’s all those weeks with Malfoy, messing around in the lab and laughing over the antics of the Portraits, but Harry has stopped seeing Malfoy as a mystery to investigate, and has started seeing him as an actual person. An amusing person with ridiculous opinions and outrageous ideas, but a person nonetheless.
Cheng Wu calls in for more backup, and then everything’s done and over in another hour: the goons are locked into the Ministry’s holding cells and Unpetrified; the exhibits are safely returned to the evidence store; and Robards gives in to the combined pressure of Potter, Draco and Fossey, and sends a team of Aurors to join Draco, Potter and Cheng Wu’s team in staking out the warehouse for the rest of the day.
“I’ve got the article framed up,” Harry says innocently, waving the Tattler at him and laughing when Malfoy makes a horrified sound.
"You’ve been compromised," Draco says, very evenly, trying to project a calmness that he doesn’t feel. He rubs his wrist with his free hand, and Potter catches him at it, Potter’s face a mask of shame as he stares down at the red marks in the shape of a handprint.
“—that a house-elf is tied to the house? No, that’s a common misconception. House-elves devote themselves to a family, and a family is more than a house. Although interestingly, there have been recorded instances where if the house has been passed down through the family for several generations, house-elves begin to consider the house as an extension of the family. Probably because of the familial magic. It’s a poorly researched topic, although extremely fascinating.”
Malfoy wags a finger at him. “Uh uh uh. Not so fast. If you want to know that, you’re going to have to sign this.” He heads back to the cupboard again, and roots around in there for a few moments before coming back and slapping yet another piece of paper down in front of Harry. “Standard non-disclosure agreement, you understand. I can’t have you selling my trade secrets off to my biggest competitors.”
“Hey!” Harry says, but it’s without heat. He’s distracted by the Horntail, who started off riding on his shoulder, and has progressed to trying to climb up the side of Harry’s head, its claws gripping Harry’s hair as it tries to tug itself up.
“I should, erm, give you some privacy,” Harry says, but doesn’t turn around. He’s sure the tips of his ears are turning red.
“So you’re basically making potpourri,” Harry says slowly, and starts laughing when Malfoy pulls a face.
He hands the rest of his carefully prepared speech to a shocked Fossey and steps aside. Fossey boggles after him for a second, but recovers quickly enough, and talks them through the sequence of events. She ends it by following Shacklebolt’s cue and motions the team on stage to introduce them. There are shocked gasps when Potter and Draco go on stage, and a whisper of disbelief runs through the room. A hundred cameras go off at once, and Draco has to squint against the glare of the flash of light bulbs. For a long horrible moment he wishes that Fossey hadn’t tried to give them credit. They’re clearly going to be the focus of tomorrow’s headlines, which is something that he has been actively trying to avoid for the last five years since the trials.
“Remind me again why we let the Hufflepuffs host this year’s Christmas party,” Draco says, which is when Pansy pops up next to them and says, “did you
"Oh, stop looking at me like that, I’ll get you another cup," Potter says, and Draco chews frantically and swallows his mouthful of food so that he can look down his nose at Potter disapprovingly.
"Not now, I’m afraid." Potter’s clearly distracted, still looking over his shoulder at the hive of activity going on in the office, and Draco takes that as his cue.
, he knows it, he just has to find out what secrets Malfoy’s hiding in this laboratory. He looks around the room, carefully avoiding Malfoy’s smug gaze as he works it out. If the potions that Malfoy is brewing are legal, then that’s not what the license covers. Then he gets it.
Susan laughs. “Well, that’s mild for them. And did they lie? You have been ordering the same thing for the last couple of days. Why not try something new? Our menu goes far beyond Dreamless Cold Brew, you know. In fact,” she looks around before lowering her voice conspiratorially, “Draco’s actually working on a new flavour right now. Between you and me, I’m pretty sure it’s going to be an instant bestseller. Mark my words, there’s going to be another write-up in the Daily Prophet.”
It turns out that spying on the Portraits is far more entertaining that Harry would have expected. The Portraits are a quarrelsome lot, and Harry learns that there are as many as three different warring factions. What he can’t quite figure out, though, is what they’re squabbling about.
“Say good night.” Potter says, lifting the dragon up, and Draco, too caught up in his thoughts, obediently says, “good night,” smiling goofily down at the dragon until reality catches up to him. Then he freezes, horrified.
want to think about that,” Harry says, making a face, “honestly Draco, please stop putting these ideas into my head” - and the alcohol keeps flowing, and they don’t kill each other, and when Draco looks up after countless cups of whiskey later, the room has considerably thinned, and he realises that they’re both smashed off their faces.
“Nothing,” Harry lies, because he knows exactly how gossipy she is. Besides, the other Portraits are listening in, even though they’re all looking away and pretending they’re not.
Draco carries on as if Potter hasn’t spoken. "–think you’re one to speak here. This is my case, and I should be able to handle it how I see fit."
that ripple down the table, wings outstretched and flared, and glares around at his housemates in as menacing a manner as a five inch dragon can pull off.
Then Potter says, “Your secret’s safe with me,” his eyes twinkling in amusement, and Draco thinks, everyone else be damned. Potter must notice the stares, however, because he abruptly says, “want to get out of here?”
“Hey, none of that now,” Draco says scoldingly, and holds up two fingers for the Horntail to land. It does so to a murmur of
she was a weak link! It isn’t Weasley is it?” Draco yanks his arm out of Blaise’s grip and whirls around, scanning the room for the Slytherin traitor, and finds Daphne holding hands and beaming at Parvati Patil, who is stunning in a red and gold outfit.
They get the warehouse cleaned out in under half an hour, and then they wait. An hour passes, then another. In the end it’s anti-climatic: five goons come strolling in shortly after dawn breaks, clutching cups of coffee and clearly unbothered and unsuspecting. They’ve obviously relied on the wards to do their work for them, and are completely unprepared for the group of wizards waiting for them, or for when they get Petrified one after the other in quick succession.
He supposes he shouldn’t really be surprised. Still, as he stands alone in an empty office staring at Potter’s empty desk and chair neatly pushed in, there’s a part of him that can’t help but wonder what went wrong.
“Wouldn’t mind poking a bit more, to be honest,” Harry says without thinking, and it isn’t until Malfoy stares at him that he realises what he just said. “Oh. Oh! No! Not what I meant.”
Potter looks up when he feels the weight of more than one curious gaze studying him, and stares defiantly back until one by one, the Slytherins look away. Draco is the only one that still looks at him, curious as to what Potter would do, and to his surprise, when Potter locks eyes with him, he gives Draco a quick nod of acknowledgement before he turns away when Hermione tugs at his arm.
Draco doesn’t say anything. It’s Potter who finally breaks the silence, finally looks up at Draco and says, voice anguished, "Malfoy–
The meeting with the Hong Kong officials goes well–they arrange to set up a joint task force, and send over a liaison to London for a month. Draco’s counterpart, Jin Cheng Wu, is competent, efficient, and handsome. He’s got a thick mop of dark hair that flops into his eyes–
Potter knows that this is their secret entrance is right there on the tip of his tongue, but then Potter cleverly distracts him by gently untangling the dragon from his hair, and holds it out. It doesn’t like being separated from its snoutful of hair, and makes its displeasure known by roaring at Potter.
“Open sesame,” Remus says to the Luggage, and it obligingly unzips itself and flips itself open. He picks out his flannel PJs and his toothbrush, and when he comes back out of the bathroom, Sirius is already changed and in bed. He’s turned down part of the blankets invitingly, smiling winningly at Remus as he pats the spot on the bed next to him.
There’s a confused pause as the three of them stare at each other. Then Potter says, "Is this your boyfriend?" his mouth twisting strangely on that last word as if he tastes something sour, and Cheng Wu’s eyebrows go up at that.
Draco sits at his cubicle, staring blankly at the file in front of him, trying to process what he had just heard. So
“What?” Harry says, too confused to be offended. “Susan said it was on the house.” He nods to Susan behind the counter, and Susan gives him a small smile and a little wave back. It’s still early, the sky an inky grey despite the dawn, and the coffee shop’s almost empty. Harry’s the second customer in the shop, and it was only because of the lingering post-war nightmares that still plague his sleep that he was here early enough to watch them open, Susan stifling a yawn as she took his order.
"Uh huh," Draco says, turning to face Potter. The corridors are mercifully deserted at this hour, so close to the end of the day.
“Thanks,” Harry says, relieved, and heads to the laboratory. It’s Amortentia again today, and Harry has to suppress a shiver when the smell hits him, and again when he sees Malfoy. The laboratory seems fuller than it was last week, with stacks of flowers covering every available inch of space.
“That’s the Slytherin house colours,” Harry says flatly, and refuses to listen to any arguments about how the green beautifully complements the Horntail’s black scales.
