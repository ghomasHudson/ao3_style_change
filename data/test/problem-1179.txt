"I brought a copy for Harry," said Ron, nodding at the side table. "You may want to take a look." He chuckled at Draco's expression. "No, seriously."
"So why am I still with you, Harry? I don't know if you'd noticed, but our flat doesn't have the nicest view. It's also woefully short on buxom beauties."
No. He wasn't going back to Azkaban. He had to believe that. He wasn't, he wasn't. And even if he was, he'd be out soon.
Malfoy nods, absently fidgeting with the frayed collar of Ron's uniform, hanging a little loose around his neck.
"All right, then?" he let go of Harry long enough to ask, and returned, using his tongue a little more.
"Not at all. I don't think that has to be saved for special occasions, though; mocking you is more like a daily necessity, I'd say."
None were effective for long. Lucius, clever and inventive as always, had improved on Voldemort's original designs, they'd realized early on. In fact, Lucius had the power to drive Draco insane, literally - and a hell of a lot faster than they'd expected, too. And what with Draco and Harry being bonded, it was possible that Harry could very well be done in by Draco's insanity or eventual suicide. The possibility that this had been Lucius' plan all along was quietly discussed among the Aurors, though none of them was stupid enough to mention that particular theory in front of Draco. Or Harry, for that matter.
He closed his eyes and lowered his head, tears spilling down his face, lips pressed together tightly, and frantically willed himself to keep control. The silence in the room broken only by his harsh breathing.
Harry shrugged, still chuckling. "Not as many as you'd think. Fred and his wife may cause problems; I don't much care."
Hermione remembers feeling sickest of all at the fact that, of all the teachers, students, Healers and Aurors who bustled around or stood helplessly watching Malfoy suffer, not one person ever suggested he return to his father. Not one of them was willing to trust that Lucius Malfoy wouldn't kill his only son, or hand him over to Voldemort. The closest anyone ever came was one Auror who commented on how frustrating it was that they were going crazy trying to locate Lucius, when they all knew that if Draco accepted his summons he'd be immediately drawn to wherever Lucius happened to be.
"Draco. He. Erm." Harry shook his head, reaching for calm, reminding himself that this was a serious thing and there could be all sorts of repercussions and he had responsibilities and, "He agreed," he blurted. "To move in together."
Harry gave in. "Fine," he said, putting his glasses on the night table and lying down next to Alec. "Wake me up if he does, please."
Harry and Kara and Ben and Alec were here now. As well as a new job at the music college, courtesy of a parole officer who was a hell of a lot more professional and sympathetic than the one he'd left behind in Dublin. Maybe because of the small amount of positive publicity he'd received in the press, or because of Harry's support. Or maybe she just felt her job was supposed to be to help parolees live law-abiding lives, rather than make them miserable. She was a welcome change, anyway. She'd said that as long as he only used magic to 'nudge' the local college to give him a job he was actually qualified to do, she would allow it.
"Get him some water," Auror One said absently, flipping through a sheaf of parchments he'd brought in with him. "O'Brian, go head," he said, nodding at Auror Two.
"Not generally a good idea to cast the more complex charms on a place that's your own, or as good as," said Bill. "They're too familiar to you; you're less likely to think of them as an attacker would. Besides, it's a bit difficult when you're trying to ward two places with the same people allowed into both of them; it's too easy to get mixed up with the barakas of the aural exceptions and end up casting a reflection shield that's too wide or has a primary/primal threshold energy that never mind," he broke off with a laugh at Draco's pained look. "Sorry, turned into Percy there for a moment. Anyway, trust me, Cursebreaker Credo: never ward your own place if you can help it. Or two places with the same people in them."
George and Demelza exchanged a look. "Fred and Anne have... they've had an interesting few months," said Demelza.
"This is impossible. They are impossible," Snape said, and Harry didn't know whether to be relieved or deeply disturbed that even Snape apparently thought Harry wasn't the only problem here.
"I asked him if he was aware your boys and Michelle were all here. He seemed to think I was being funny."
My point - and I do have one - is that if there's anything I've missed that you might have liked to see, please try to remember what it was. After I'm done posting the story I will make an Ember to Ember DVD-Extras Request post. You can tell me what you missed on that post. Please don't tell me beforehand, because I'm a ginormous twit with the memory and organizational skills of a goldfish, so it'll get promptly lost. I do not guarantee to write every request I get - I've still got one pinch-hit, three WiPs, and two TimeStamp meme requests sitting on my hard drive, all of which I deeply hope to post some day and all of whom periodically poke at me and suck me in. However, I promise to at least read the requests over, and consider them, and give each one a fair try :)
He looked over at Draco, his brow furrowed as he read. Wondered what it was he was reading now: the listing of his various crimes, or the witnesses from the accident telling how he'd saved Alec's life? The section on his time in Azkaban, or the rescue workers praising his actions?
Harry frowned, distracted by his toast. "You never told me your broomstick was off. When did that happen?"
"No, I know we're supposed to meet Hermione's Bulgarian friends for that information about the Paris Death Eaters, but why here?"
Draco smiled bitterly. "Come on. You said it yourself: you don't think I have anywhere to go. And you're too bloody noble to walk away, after I left everything to be with you." He finished unbuttoning his shirt, turning away from Harry, feeling a little hollow. Damn marital honesty anyway, he thought as he pulled the shirt off. Really, there was nothing better at killing any hint of a mood.
"I know," said Kara brightly. "Why don't we all sing until Bill gets here? What's the new song in your London choir, Alec? Jerusalem? You two sing the verses and Draco and I will join in the chorus. All right?"
"I wouldn't worry about the punch," she said, reading his concern accurately. "You can talk to him about it tomorrow."
What does it do? wondered Ben. How does it decide? Why so quickly for some kids, and so slowly for others?
All right. Malfoy was in this with him; not only in the same deep shit as Harry, but also just as scared of whatever was going on behind the closed door. And Harry probably couldn't come up with any way to convince the adults to just let them be, but maybe if he and Malfoy worked together, they could come up with something. Malfoy was a rather unlikely ally, but he would probably be easier to work with than the band of adults in the other room.
"Good." Flint smiled again. "So. What's it like, going out with the Saviour of the Wizarding World?"
Parkinson's daughter was thinking of a Lumos spell, and the werewolf appeared to be thinking of the full moon as both light and dark, which was intriguing. He wondered briefly at the man's fear of his monthly transformation. Rather a waste. Fenrir Greyback dealt with his own condition much more practically; obviously he was barred from civilized society, but he accepted the power of his condition and used it, unlike this shabby unfortunate.
Thanks hugely to scrtkpr, for going above and beyond with this chapter, wielding the pointy beta-stick with style, and indulging my neediness ;)
Lucius bit his lip as he pushed Narcissa's words away. She was wrong. He would've found the strength to stop no matter what Weasley did, he would have stopped, he wouldn't have allowed himself to harm Draco-
A few minutes later, Draco had ripped his signet ring off again, and Harry and Draco both remember the flash of wandless magic that shattered the ring and sent white-hot pieces of it flying in every direction. They both remember one of Madam Pomfrey's bedsheets bursting into flame on contact. But Draco doesn't remember that it was both of them who cast the spell. Harry does.
"Oh, not angry," the girl said, chuckling. "Only all of Dad's letters are Howlers. He can't write terribly well. I expect he'll be happy for us both no matter where we end up. Though he might wonder a bit, if I end up in Hufflepuff." She frowned slightly.
"Potter, wake up," Malfoy said roughly. "You're having a wet dream and it's playing hell with my nerves."
Oh God, the bloody Weasleys. Harry would no doubt be around them more than he had been in the last few months. He'd hear what they thought about the situation, hear what they thought of Draco, and all without Draco there to remind Harry of why they were together.
Harry laughed. "Why, have I grown breasts too?" Draco chuckled. "I wasn't raised to think about things like that. First the Dursleys made sure I understood that nobody would ever want to marry somebody like me, and during school I thought there was a good chance I would die long before I even thought of getting married." He tapped his quill on the tabletop absently. "Weddings, birthdays... anniversaries, whatever, all of that was for other people, as far as I could tell."
It would be really nice if Malfoy was looking more like his usual sneering self, and Harry could just push him away, but Malfoy's looking serious and telling him he's taking a patience potion.
The songs mentioned in this chapter are Shenandoah and Fields of Athenry. Lyrics and downloads can be found at the
"Of what?" Malfoy asked, and Harry took heart from the fact that he hadn't immediately mocked Harry for admitting his fear.
Oh God, Harry, please, Get me out of here, Draco thought desperately. Raise a big stink, use your influence, I don't care. Just get me out of here.
"Fred," George said quietly. "M-Malfoy might not be who you w-want for them, but at least Harry's got s-somebody with him-"
God, he and Ginny had barely had a chance to get there. And they were such different people, Ginny and Draco, but they each had brought so much to Harry's life, and each done so much to make him feel complete, and...
"You and Kara and Ben were added in. Fred's suggestion, actually." Harry paused and rubbed his eyes, vaguely registering that Draco didn't seem as surprised by that as Harry had thought he'd be. "How's Ben doing?"
Pity Harry was still unable to do the same. Well, that was Harry. Wallowing in immaturity. Didn't mean Fred had to do the same. He absently rubbed his jaw where Harry had just punched him.
Finally, the drunken singalong was done, and Draco followed his choir and the children's choir onto the stage, wishing he were leading them instead of simply singing. The performance was enjoyable anyway, though the song itself was a little sentimental for his taste, all about
"Unless the Malfoy name was in the toilet, or I was married off to somebody whose family was a follower of Voldemort."
"We've done all our shouting already," Harry said hollowly. "The last few months..." he trailed off and sighed, rubbing his eyes under his glasses. "Are we... what do you want to tell the boys?"
"And poor, dear Harry, he's one of the family - well he's shown exactly how much he thinks of the all-important family, hasn't he?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "All right, then, it's been seventeen years." He chuckled. "So. What took us so long?"
"S&M, rimming, fisting - you must know, you were a Death Eater. They were into all kinds of sick amusements, weren't they?"
Harry nodded. "Well at least this year we know a lot of the issues that are likely to come up. I'm sure it'll be easier than last year."
"It's not that I don't want to," Draco said, and he pulled Harry closer again, gasping as Harry returned to his lips and they started stroking each other. But he winced a bit as Harry's grip grew firmer and he realized with dismay that he was a little tender there too. And that for once he wasn't totally thrilled at the prospect of a hand job. He didn't much miss being inside another person during sex - too busy getting off on the brilliant sensation of having another person inside him - but when that wasn't going to happen... well, being tossed off wasn't that great a substitute. Especially as it seemed that was also going to involve some... discomfort.
And then Harry and Draco were alone in the flat, with nothing but silence between them, and damn it, this was
Dark was the dungeon of Malfoy Manor, where Lucius often went to meditate and practice difficult spells. The dark was comforting in its own way, a counterpoint to light. Strange how the Dark was so feared by weak fools, who didn't understand that facing it and embracing it and bending it to your will was what power was all about.
"Yes, I know that, but when I agreed to go underground and have a concealment spell put on me, I honestly thought I'd get to choose what I looked like. And I honestly thought the person putting the spell on me wouldn't trip over her own feet during the casting and end up swishing a little too hard and making the spell twice as potent."
And what about Dean's girlfriend? What if Tracey comes to visit Harry and the person she thinks is Dean? Off the top of his head Dean can think of about half a dozen inside jokes, endearments and shared experiences between himself and Tracey that Malfoy might not know about, might not understand.
Dumbledore, neutral. The idea would have been laughable if the situation weren't so serious. Serious and infuriating, having to stand near the man without harming him. One of the few things that had kept Lucius warm at nights in Azkaban had been the thought of Dumbledore dead or on his knees before the Dark Lord, his corruption of the wizarding world stopped, and the Malfoys back to where they should be. And here was Lucius, wand in hand, a clear shot at Dumbledore, with Dumbledore's mind and magic fully absorbed by the circle... and Lucius couldn't do a thing but look at Healer Esposito instead in order to not go mad at the thought of his own powerlessness.
Beside him. Inexplicably, the fury and wild hatred towards Malfoy that he'd felt mere moments ago was completely gone, replaced by a bewildering urge to stay as close to him as possible. Because, he realized, they were in this together, both in the deepest of shit, following Dumbledore and McGonagall and Snape to god only knew what punishment. And all the other students, even his closest friends, were back in the Great Hall, and only Malfoy could possibly have any idea of what Harry was going through right now, or any chance of giving him any comfort whatsoever.
"No, don't stop, that was - um, don't stop-" Malfoy murmured, and they were so close he could feel the other boy's breath on his face.
"It's a word Kara shouldn't use around you boys," Draco said, and the glare he directed towards her effectively covered any other reaction to what Harry had just said. And, conveniently, drew his attention away from Harry long enough for Harry to think over his own words as he and Bill tried to figure out where to put the keyboard.
(laugh) Yeah, I suppose so. It was just schoolboy stuff, though. You know, fights, insults, that kind of thing. And we were both Seekers, so there was that, and our houses don't generally get along.
Situation, thought Harry. What a nice word to describe how completely and utterly buggered up his life had become.
He sat up, picked up his glasses from the side table and glanced at the window, registering that the light had dimmed considerably. He'd fallen asleep sometime in the late morning, and it looked like evening...
At least the guards had been human, Lucius thought with grim satisfaction. No Dementors left on the island by the time Lucius had arrived there; they had all been recruited by the Dark Lord.
He thrummed with energy. Energy he had nowhere to safely dispense. There was no apparition out of the locker rooms for privacy of the players. Or the pitch, for safety. He would have to walk back and out to the nearest point. There was no way of avoiding people and he didn’t trust himself yet. He would wait. Wait till the building emptied out a bit and then he would leave. He wasn’t going to skulk away under a charm. He would walk out of the building as he had walked off the pitch, with his head held high. He just didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of assault charges being thrown at him that evening. He had to be present for the post-match with Davis anyway. He’d could hold himself in check around his teammates and then leave.
“Fortunately, that won’t be necessary as Draco here is going to be snapped by a Prophet photographer having fun and being celebrated by his teammates in the pub this evening and tomorrow we will be releasing a statement decrying their behaviour and solidifying our support of our newest member…Is that clear?
Davis regarded Draco for a moment. Alone and stiff in the furthest part of the room. He could bench him. Let him play out his contract as a reserve and be done with this hassle. Draco and everyone in the room knew that. He’d be within his rights and it would solve what was potentially a huge PR problem for a team who was already struggling to scrape back its former glory.  Davis’s eyes left Draco and landed back on Amy.
David standing now, his voice angry but low and controlled his face red as he scanned the room again.
Pip and Aster saluted him as he stood not quite outside but certainly too close to the door of the Falcons dressing room. The rest of the team depending on age and maturity level either ignored him completely or tried to control the squeals of surprised they felt build in them upon seeing the saviour of the wizarding world not just as a blur high above them on the pitch but as a solid man leaning against a nearby wall. A man who, if you knew him well and they didn’t, looked tense.
When his mind caught up with his body his eyes finally conveyed to his brain that it was Harry that stood before him. Harry that had followed him off the pitch like a stray fucking dog and was now looking at him with a stupid earnest that Draco longed to slap off.  Draco exhaled an ‘of course’ dropped his empty hand and resisting the urge to roll his eyes so hard they would never come back he turned on his heel then and swept away. He left Harry standing dumbly, his lips parted as if he’d been about to say something. Something useless no doubt.
“Because I want to hear it. …That you want it too... You do, don’t you?” lust mixed with desperate uncertainty should not be as intoxicating as it was to Draco.
He dropped to his knees at that omission. Pushed his nose into the taut muscle of Draco’s lower stomach and felt the slight give and softness there. Absurdly his first thought was that’s where you should stab him… It might be the only soft part of him… His lips curled against the soft skin in amusement at his own bizarre thought and he huffed a tiny laugh.
“Fuck” laughed Potter as he pulled back gasping breath. He moved his hand from Draco’s neck and pushed hair from his face instead, looked intently for a moment into Draco’s grey eyes.
He had sunk deep into himself while he soared over the pitch searching for the glint of gold that would turn the crowd’s ire to elation. He had tuned out the chanting from hands waving black and white flags and those of black and grey… No one was on his side but he could change that. He could exceed expectations as he had done countless times before in his life and he could get them the result that wanted. He would win and they would cheer and that would be that. Any time he faced Potter from then on it would be less loaded. Just another match, not some pantomime The Prophet could sell papers about.
“Let’s shut you up, shall we?” Came the haughty reply and the slim fingers left his hair to hook inside his waistband, pushing downwards revealing the loveliest cock Harry had ever seen. His mouth flooded and he couldn’t help but lick his lips and look up wolfishly at Draco from beneath heavy lids.
“Yes, really! You dolt! I am tired, filthy and am required to go and drink with a team the majority of whom hate me and the rest who I suspect only tolerate me due to once again your fucking influence, so yes Potter what do you want!?”
Encouraged by Draco’s irritation rather than apprehension Harry traced his lips over the bulge Infront of him. The thin material keeping him from something he’d wanted for longer than he knew or wanted to interrogate really
Draco closed the gap and Harry moaned beneath him. In pleasure or relief Draco wasn’t sure but the heat of it went straight to his hardening cock. Harry pushed himself flush against Draco’s body now and he could feel how much Harry did in fact want him pressed against his hip.
Draco Malfoy looked like a centrefold in Wizards of The Week, a publication that Harry had no problem giving his resounding endorsement. Usually at leisure and on a Sunday morning. His toned back was to Harry and he was in action but stilled immediately on hearing the door. Leaving him undershirt half pulled from his chest, his arms crossed overhead. His soft cotton training trousers hung around his hips revealing two perfect dimples on his lower back. The drawstrings had been loosened in anticipation of the shower that Harry knew Draco must be in desperate need of but instead of finishing the pull of the shirt and throwing it into the nearby hamper as expected Draco instead reverse the motion roughly and turned to face Harry as his slim fingers went to his lower stomach and tightened those hanging drawstrings once more… Which was fine… Harry swallowed the saliva that had pooled in his mouth and was happy that Draco was no longer distractingly half dressed.
The chanting had echoed through the locker rooms before the team had made their way to the pitch. They couldn’t make out the words just the fever of the singing crowd above them.
His sole refuge was his mind. Occlumency allowed him to retreat into himself and look on with dispassion. If the mind could be anything, then his was a labyrinth: compressed into a series of interlocking passages that caged the seething resentment burning darkly within him. He could not show his discontent, his doubt. The others were ruled by emotion, not reason; ingratiating themselves to a man whose heritage they purported to despise. There was no order to their cause, and it had become apparent to him that reinstating pureblood supremacy was merely a convenient smokescreen to mask the Dark Lord’s grasp for power. But Draco was not strong enough to oppose them, so he would continue to play the coward and the fool, even if he had to watch his parents be degraded, his aunt prostrate herself before a half-blood, and was forced to torture muggles or dissenters day after day. He would say nothing, because there was nothing to be done.
Lucius had rendered Draco inarticulate in the span of one conversation. Because he was used to being a disappointment, and a failure; neither suited to the light or dark, and a half-breed, besides. If he’d followed the traditions of the Black and Malfoy lines, Draco would have killed himself before ever letting himself turn—let alone live publicly as a werewolf. He should have done it rather than degrade his family with his existence. But he hadn’t been able to; his final act of cowardice, and one he’d assumed he would never live down. He’d been wrong.
“What?” He slurred, trying to turn towards her but instead stumbling into the nearest wall. “What the bloody hell is it?”
Harry received the call about Malfoy the night Al turned eight. At first, he had almost felt relieved for the chance to leave. The birthday party had been a tiring, frantic affair from the start, and he and Ginny had been rowing furiously since breakfast. About what, exactly, he was still uncertain. Their home had become increasingly hot inside as the day wore on, not to mention claustrophobic—it was all the children, he thought, who filled up the rooms and spilled out into the back garden. It made the house seem smaller than it was. Like the walls were closing in on him. He had never been comfortable with small spaces.
He arrived right before ten, and spotted Potter’s familiar figure lounging in the shadows of a nearby shop. The sky above was dark still. Dawn would not come for several hours yet. Potter, as usual, looked vaguely unkempt even with the heavy glamour he employed. Visual magics tended not to work on dark creatures, since they could identify wizards beneath those disguises through physical means. To him, Potter always smelled overwhelmingly of mint, and something fresh, like cedar—or, perhaps, pine.
Draco had never given much thought to his sexuality. He’d been in love with Pansy in school and had intended to marry her. He hadn’t minded that she was snub-nosed and a little spotty, or that there was often a shrill note to her voice. He’d loved her regardless. But in the ensuing fallout of the war, he had broken off their engagement. No money, no prospects, and an impeding incarceration in Azkaban—if he really cared about Pansy, how could he drag her into that? She’d been furious with him, and in a startling moment of bravery, had claimed she didn’t care. That she’d stay with him anyways. It was a nice dream. But Draco had known better, and said to her, “You will care, and you will hate me for it. I’d rather us part as friends now, than lose what we have forever.”
Inordinately furious, Draco stepped over the mangled remnants of the compartment door to find two startled-looking children inside. One was a gangly ginger brat and the other was a vaguely concussed-looking child with a mop of dark hair. He was sprawled across the floor.
Potter stepped closer, eyes manic. “Living with muggles was out of my control! You don’t think I would’ve chosen to live with Ron’s family—or with anyone else for that matter, if I’d had a choice? I’ve never had a choice!”
“I’m what? A bastard? A blood purist? A vile, filthy little half-breed? I won’t deny those accusations. I’m fully aware of what, exactly, I am. You don’t have to tell me.”
“Take as many bloody points as you want! I don’t care!” Potter said hotly. “I just wanted to know how he did it! And why! Why
Potter let go like he’d been scalded. “Sorry! We were just—” He had the gall to actually sound apologetic, and stared at his hands like wasn’t quite sure what had come over him.
“You’re welcome for that, by the way. I expect an owl from the Mudblood in the post full of her most gracious and verbose thanks.”
mid-air, instantly racked by the worst pain he’d ever felt. His aunt had not paused at all: just laughed and laughed. Yaxley had resumed his mother’s torture all the while Draco screamed himself raw, blood foaming at the corners of his mouth like he was some animal. He learned quickly that meddling only made things worse. Those lessons had come easy.
Percy, for his part, looked as though he was now contemplating whether he even wanted to be rescued anymore. Draco didn’t particularly blame him. Potter had begun to attempt, rather ineffectually, to console Granger, who was trying to either punch or slap him through her magical bindings, and also, quite possibly, to glare at him hard enough to incite spontaneous combustion. Well. If anyone could do it…
It seemed to him like he’d traded in one prison for another. Only this one was bereft of his parents, and left him with even less options than before. He was more alone than ever. What could he do—just obey? He couldn’t kill himself now, not without doing the same to Severus in the process. Something dark and primal within him rebuked the thought. But what was left for him, then? The prowling inside his head increased. The wolf hated feeling trapped. That was one thing they could agree on.
“POTTER,” he said loudly, and, rather than having the good sense to just open the door, punched his fist through it. He broke completely through the wood upon the first attempt, but rather than following through on another strike kicked it down instead. Bloody werewolf strength.
Severus continued, “It is too dangerous for you to stay at Hogwarts any longer. Your defection will be common enough knowledge soon in Slytherin, and your condition is impossible to hide at this juncture. Later today, two Order members will be by to transport you to one of our safe houses. The Headmaster will speak to you further about your actions in the Room of Requirement there.”
Potter quickly retreated, but not after shooting him another one of those searching, wild-eyed looks. The lingering scent of mint punctuated his departure. Pomfrey glanced between them, then sat several odious-looking potions atop his bedside table before taking her leave, too.
He’d apparated into the garden and landed in a heap. Hot with shame and sick at himself, he’d retched into the bushes before collapsing into sobs. He’d never felt so out of control. Ginny had found him like that. Her fury was palpable, but tempered by melancholy—like she pitied him. He’d allowed her to wrap him up in her arms, despite him being far taller and broader than she.
“I’m ready. I know I’m ready. I’ve been dreaming of this day for nearly a year. There is nothing for me here anymore, sir. You’ve said it yourself. Let me go.”
“I’m afraid not, Mr. Malfoy. You are going to live,” she said firmly, cutting open the front of his robes and examining the damage. “Mr. Potter, are you still here?”
In the interim, Draco periodically orchestrated assassination attempts aimed at the headmaster. They were easily thwarted, and designed to fail. If he really wanted to kill Dumbledore, he would have simply laced one of his utensils with a contact poison. Death would not be instantaneous, but rather, come later in the day: a seizure of the heart, one which would at first glance appear to be a natural occurrence. No one would ever know, because they would never think to look. It was the kind of murder that purebloods specialized in. Besides, the headmaster was already cursed; and with something lethal, too. Draco’s work was already done. All he had to do was wait.
Draco considered his options. “Liverpool. The scouse with the—” He began, only to be quickly cut off by an embarrassed-looking Potter.
“—dog collar and latex get-up. Yeah, that was humiliating. I don’t think I need to verify your identity now, you rotten prat. The only one who knew about that was you.”
Before Weasley could interject again, there was a loud crash from down the corridor. He and Potter glanced at each other. Montague. Damn it. If they had returned, then so had he. They started towards the noise at once, both with wands drawn and ready to fire. Although he and Potter were clearly suffering from the lingering effects of their accidental temporal excursion, which largely resembled drunkenness, they were no less intent on seeing their case through for it. Besides, who was better equipped on a train full of children to deal with a mad criminal than them?
“Y-you’re drunk! Or… something!” She accused, then sniffed primly. “And don’t swear at me—it’s unbecoming! I’m a lady!”
He did not need to tell Potter that wizards did not take kindly to homosexuals and their ilk. That much was obvious. It was traditionally seen as a sign of impotence and a failure to continue the family line in a community where blood was everything. Draco knew that if it had been anyone else, Potter would have been shunned for his open indiscretions. He didn’t think Potter could help it, though; living under the constant threat of death or punishment in his formative years had seemingly left an indelible mark on him. Not the shagging blokes part—which Draco didn’t think one could choose—but rather, Potter’s apparent inability to keep a steady relationship. He seemed unsuited to stillness and kinetic by nature; someone whose freedom came at the cost of their relationships. Or perhaps he was looking too deeply into it.
The next morning he woke early and dressed himself in the protective leathers most Hit-Wizards wore, before applying a light glamour to alter the appearance of his hair and clothes. The magic was easier to maintain long-term if he kept the disguise simple, and people rarely recognized him when he wasn’t blond. He fingered his fringe, which was run through with gray. Well,
“I’m sorry for your loss,” Harry began, and when Malfoy did not respond, continued, “I came to speak with you about the events of this evening. If you’d rather I leave and come back at a later date, I would be willing to accommodate such a request. One of our child specialists will be by to visit with your son tomorrow.”
Harry said nothing. The irony of Malfoy’s predicament was not lost on him, but he would never wish something so horrible on anyone—even his childhood foil.
He knew they would make her enter first. But she would help him, of that he was certain. Blood called to blood.
The last Friday of April arrived. He went about his routine as usual, but was noticeably more on edge. Although he suppressed the fractious stab of anxiety thoughts of the ritual produced, he felt it seeping through regardless. Blaise and Daphne noticed this, but commented only once. Potter seemed very aware of him, and even sat next to Draco in Potions. Tense, and almost thrumming with agitation, Potter ignored the carefully apportioned ingredients he’d lain out for them, and proceeded to mangle their potion. If not for the fact that he was clearly trying to instigate a fight, Draco would have sought out some petty form of revenge. But he really couldn’t be bothered at this point. He left Potter, still fuming, standing over the charred remnants of their sleeping draught.
They still saw each other sometimes. He flooed Pansy when her husband was away on business and her children—two girls, both of whom had her dark skin and their father’s wild auburn curls—were visiting another family. It wasn’t sexual or romantic, just two people who had known each other for a very long time reminiscing about their lives. He still loved her, though, and probably always would. But he was glad Pansy had listened to him. He would have broken her heart.
“…Sir,” Draco acknowledged stiffly. “I should have known you were working for Dumbledore, but I suppose it’s preferable to the alternative.”
He felt the loss of his shields more keenly than ever in that moment, as Draco could not entirely suppress the tears that welled up then. After this came the shame. It had become an all too familiar feeling recently. He pulled his knees to his chest and leaned forward. His chest and back both protested at the movement. In the distance, he could hear the mournful howls of a wolf.
“Rastrick, I’m unofficially considering this self-defense. Send the bodies to the Coroner’s Office at St. Mungo’s. The lingering magical residue should corroborate my estimation, but have the Healers check for defensive wounds on the Malfoys—all of them—for further evidence. Make sure to run diagnostic spells on the wands, as well,” he said. Rastrick nodded at this, then made to fire-call the Aurors stationed at St. Mungo’s.
The service at the Wyvern left something to be desired, but since they had both been banned from the Leaky Cauldron, they’d taken to drinking here—albeit for different reasons. Draco was a known criminal and a half-breed, so he hadn’t been in since before the war; Potter had probably been caught shagging some poor bird or bloke in one of the back rooms there, although his predilections towards men and exhibitionist tendencies hadn’t been news for a good decade now. He wasn’t a proper poofter, really, since he’d been married to Ginny Weasley twice over and still regularly picked up women, but neither did he seem to mind bumming around with men. Draco had been shocked at first. His idea of shirt-lifters had always been more of the nancy-ish persuasion, like Terry Boot and Ernie Macmillan—not Potter, Head Auror and dark wizard hunter extraordinaire. It still surprised him sometimes.
Harry had been attempting to scrape together a meal in the kitchen, but upon hearing the racket upstairs, went to investigate. There had been some primal, inexplicable hurt within him at the sight of that wounded toy soldier, in pieces at his son’s feet, that Harry could not explain. He knew he could mend it with a slash of the wand, but the idea had seemed so far away at the time. All the windows in the house shattered at once, and before he realized what he’d done, Harry had struck James across the face. The horror had been instantaneous. It was made worse by the looks upon James, Al, and Ginny’s faces, and Lily’s distant wailing. They had been afraid of him.
He laughed meanly. “He hasn’t told you—Harry Potter, the Chosen One? His favored student and Child of the Prophecy?”
Already tiring of his game, Draco struck first. He slashed his wand in a brutal arc that had Montague reacting before he even realized what he’d done. The hostage was left unprotected in the interim. This opening allowed Potter to retrieve her, and he summoned her towards him. One of the surrounding students latched onto her immediately and pulled the girl into the crowd. Now Montague was not only fielding spells from Draco but also from Potter, and the two were quickly closing the distance between them. He was going to lose, and this time there was no accomplice to intercede on his behalf.
“Don’t,” he pleaded, feeling the wolf surge up within him. A low growl ground its way up his throat, and he dug his nails into each temple as if that could quell its power. Absently, he noticed that the runes on his palms had scarred over.
“Potter, leave now! He’s about to change! Barricade the doors and get Headmaster Dumbledore!” Pomfrey said, aiming her wand his way. But that was all he could remember before the wolf took over.
“So do I.” Malfoy looked over at Scorpius, still and unmoving in a bed that dwarfed his small frame. It made Harry think of Al or James, and how he’d feel if they were in a similar situation. Scorpius was only Al’s age, after all. His chest ached.
“There are worse things in this world than death,” Draco said, thinking of Greyback, his Aunt Bellatrix, and now himself. “I’m sure Longbottom would tell you something similar.”
Severus sighed. “The Dark Lord is looking for you. Malfoy Manor is infested with Death Eaters. You have no home or parents to return to. Due to the events of last night, rumors about your… health have already begun to spread amongst the students.”
There was a sound suspiciously like a laugh from beyond the curtain, and Severus rose to his feet at once. His wand was drawn and poised to attack before Draco had even processed what was happening. Severus pulled back the curtain to reveal the disembodied head of a rather chagrined-looking Potter, whose body was presumably hidden within the folds of his infamous invisibility cloak.
“I didn’t hurt anyone, did I?” He asked, thinking of those that had been present when Potter had dragged him in.
Potter, ever the genius, followed suit and summoned another child towards them. Judging by the gravity-defying riot of brown curls, it was Granger. How… unfortunate. Time-travel was the just gift that kept on giving, wasn’t it?
One night when Potter had been particularly pissed, he’d started to mutter about cupboards and locked doors and some disturbing sport called “Harry Hunting.” Draco had not mentioned the incident, but neither had he forgotten—nor had he looked at the other man the same since. Perhaps that’s why Potter had taken a liking to him. Similar inclinations towards danger, and similar tragedies. In his youth he’d measured himself against his father, his mother, and this man—who, he supposed, had been his childhood foil. Now Potter was one of the only people who would willingly be seen with him. That afforded him some measure of loyalty from Draco, who was surprised by how much he’d come to tolerate the other’s presence in his life.
“I want you to live,” Lucius said, his once-commanding voice reduced to a mere rasp. “Live to spite them, and live to prove them wrong. Then be free. Your mother will come to understand this, in time. If she doesn’t, then so be it.”
But there were variables he could not control: the interference of his godfather and that damnable Potter, who couldn’t seem to bloody well keep to himself. He was obviously suspicious of him, and shadowed Draco almost daily now: always hidden beneath his cloak, but rendered identifiable to him by the soft noises he made, little breaths and muted curses that he seemed unable to bite back. How Potter had ever caught anyone unawares was beyond him. In retaliation, he deployed a disguised Crabbe and Goyle as decoys to divert Potter’s attention, and to prevent him from ever reaching the Room of Requirement while Draco was at work. It was only a matter of time before he was discovered, an apprehension heightened by the constant sensation of Potter’s gaze upon him—watching, unwaveringly, eyes livid against the brown of his face.
“I owe you nothing, Potter, least of all an explanation!” Severus said, in lieu of providing any kind of an actual answer. “As for the latter, ask the headmaster himself.”
He was washing dishes in the kitchen when Ginny approached him. The sink was full up with chipped plates and cups leftover from lunch, and about half of the extended Weasley-Granger clan was occupying the dining table. Percy and Audrey were having a heated conversation about clocks while Teddy entertained the usually prim Molly Jr. and Lucy by changing his features from one ridiculous guise and into another. Charlie and his girlfriend, Sofia, were near-drunk and yelling at each other about something incomprehensible. Probably dragons, Harry reckoned. Or Quidditch. A group of children comprised of Longbottoms, Goldsteins, and MacMillans were cluttering up the floor, attention held by Teddy’s old model train sets. Luna was examining her tea leaves.
Montague seemed to have realized this too, and muttered particularly long and vile-sounding curse that manifested as an arc of violet light. Instead of attempting to deflect it with a shield charm, which didn’t work on darker spells, Potter transfigured the floor into a makeshift barricade. Upon making contact with it, the light ricocheted back towards Montague and hit him right between the eyes. For a brief moment, Montague expanded outwards, features purpling and distorting beyond recognition as he continued to swell.
Although Ginny knew more about his childhood than Hermione and Ron, even she did was not privy to everything. Brief flashes of his time at the Dursleys peeked through occasionally, but accompanying them was some deep inner humiliation that made speaking about the matter intolerable. He still had nightmares about the war, and his job—but, most of all, his childhood. Uncle Vernon’s belt scoring marks into his back, the ache of a hungry stomach, and the sneers and taunts that followed him daily. The heat of the sun on his neck. Feeling alone. So alone.
Montague lunged for the back table, where he’d presumably been working prior to their assault. Cogs, gears, and gilt wire were swept to the floor, sacrificed in search of one of the partly dissembled time-turners scattered about. Potter was already firing off another deluge of curses, but Montague was adept enough to deflect or shield himself from them. Even if he managed to duel Potter to a stalemate, which was unlikely, Montague still could not fend off the both of them. It was only a matter of time until they subdued or killed him. But perhaps that was not his intention at all.
“Er, so you’re still working the Montague case?” Potter ventured awkwardly. Draco was grateful for the change in subject.
Harry went rigid. “Please, let’s not talk about that,” he said. A fissure appeared in one of the trees. His hands clenched.
“Er, Draco. What are you doing?” Another familiar voiced asked him. It belonged to a large, fat child who also appeared to be taller than him. How odd.
“You lot need a touch up, yeah?” The bartender cut in, gesturing at their respective empty glasses. She was new, Draco noted.
A plan began to take shape in his mind. At first simply the vague notion of a ploy for escape, it quickly took on a different purpose entirely. He could construct a trap. Not easily, and not without exercising a great deal of caution. But it could be done. He could actually do it, and succeed at that, Draco realized. It would require a great deal of patience, cunning, and misdirection. It would necessitate a discretion from him that lived up to the reputation of his House. It would likely end with his death, and the deaths of everyone he’d ever cared about. But that was inevitable. He was certain that no matter what happened, whether it was Potter or the Dark Lord who emerged the victor, his family would end up a casualty. To him, and to his parents, death was preferable to slavery.
“Why not let Voldemort in? He’d have rewarded you for it, surely; then you’d still have your family, and your—”
Draco set the mirror down and withdrew two more objects from within the folds of his robes: Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder and the Hand of Glory he’d purchased from Borgin and Burke’s at the beginning of the year. After his mother entered, he’d activate the powder to ensure as many Death Eaters followed as possible before realizing what he’d done. No sense in not maximizing the casualties. His lips curved into a tremulous smile, one that thinned further when his mother finally appeared. Narcissa looked more haggard than ever, robes hanging loosely on her emaciated frame, but still she retained an atmosphere of dignity about her.
Once he spied the silhouettes of the others approaching, Draco dispersed the powder and all went dark. The Hand of Glory indeed gave light to the holder, but it rendered the world odd and slightly out of focus. There was enough clarity for him to see this through, though, and he watched with satisfaction as from the cabinet spilled Bellatrix, his uncles, Yaxley, Dolohov, Wormtail, the Carrows, Crabbe, Goyle, Rosier, Nott, Selwyn, and finally, his father. He closed his eyes as they began to thrash and scream, not noticing the sharp intake of breath behind him. One by one, they each ran dry and were left to collapse and sprawl motionlessly across the floor. The wards died instantly at the loss.
“It’s okay, Potter. I’m ready,” he said, blinking blood away. “I’m going to see my mother again, and my father…”
Her eyes grew sad. “Alright, Harry,” she said after a moment, holding him tighter. “I’ll discipline them until you’re ready. If I ever catch you doing anything of the sort again, you’ll be sleeping at Grimmauld Place for a fortnight.”
Now faced with multiple wands pointed at him, and all by children no less, not to mention the various traumatized bystanders behind them, Draco reviewed his available options. The more morally reprehensible ones appeared the most viable at present. Well then. He was committing to being a criminal in both the past and the future, he supposed. His father would be so proud.
It seemed too good to be true, and apparently it was. The brief marriage of Harry Potter to his childhood rival Draco Malfoy, punctuated by rumours of conflict and violence, appears to have actually been abusive, if reports from Hogwarts are to be believed. The Prophet has learned that during the couple's time together, his spouse was twice treated for serious physical injuries suffered at the hands of Mr. Potter, and that at one point the school nurse was so concerned with his safety that she contacted a Healer from St. Mungo's to come and evaluate the situation.
"All right, yeah, it's different," Bill admitted. "But remember, this is the same family that accepted Fleur... sort of. And accepted Percy coming back. And me having long hair and an earring, and Charlie shacking up with his dragons. It'll work out. Eventually."
Anne's eyes flashed with anger, and she raised in chin defiantly. "Oh don't act so surprised," she sneered. "Would you have told me the truth? If you'd done it?"
Which he had severe need of, these days. Between the nerve-wrecking nature of his family's precarious political balance, and the yawning void of uncertainty about the future, and school, and... and the thing he tried very hard not to think about...
And it didn't bother him at all later that night, as he and Cornfoot indulged in one last unhurried snog before they parted company and he headed back to the dungeon. Body still pleasantly zinging and worn out from the aftermath of their activities, nerves somewhat steadied, another assignation planned for two days hence, and no involvement of his emotions at all.
Kara smirked. "Ye've heard it said that gay men are all about casual sex, and lesbians are only interested in commitment?"
After unbonding, Draco switches back to Slytherin Charms class in 4th period, lunch 5th period, and only goes to Ancient Runes during 8th period. Harry stays in all the same classes but now only goes to Astronomy during 8th period.
And there it was. Draco's e-mail address was slowly appearing in the parchment's thin, slanted script, and Harry's stomach dropped and his knees felt weak as he leaned against the wall of the shed, a shocked and dazed grin spreading across his face as Draco's message wrote itself onto the parchment.
Draco and Pansy are polyjuiced to look like Ron and Ginny Weasley, so that Draco can be near. Hermione and Pansy talk.
Odd, that Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy's grandson now saw Arthur and Molly Weasley as his grandparents.
"I'm being too subtle for you, aren't I?" Cornfoot said, and Draco found himself blushing. Apparently he'd turned into Harry when he wasn't looking.
The healing circles gathered around Draco and Potter, who lay unconscious in the middle of the room. Lucius took his place in the outer circle, between the bushy-haired Muggle-born and the threadbare werewolf, facing - and about to be partnered with - one of Arthur Weasley's numerous vacant-eyed offspring.
"Even defended Ben a few times, haven't you? Just now, when the Goyle girl recognized him. The first thing you did was step closer to him, just in case things turned nasty and he needed you."
George glanced at the door where his twin had exited and nodded thoughtfully. "He's g-getting better," he pointed out. "At least he's m-making an effort."
Harry pulled back slightly. The impulse to just go with this and enjoy it was almost overwhelming, but he needed to know for sure. He rested his forehead against Draco's, looking down as they held each other close. "So..." he began, and cleared his throat. "Does this mean - are you..."
"The kids would be fine. You know that. Right now neither of them's exactly a barrel of laughs. They get along fine when they're healthy."
Harry gave him a startled look, then frowned slightly. "Some people can, and some people can't. I can't. You know that, Alec."
Blood was still pouring down his face, and he knew there was no point in wiping at it, but he tried anyway. His nose felt broken. The dull ache was the only thing he could really feel, besides Malfoy's fear. He spared Malfoy a quick glance, taking in his ashen features and the trickle of blood down his face - a split lip, from the looks of it, from the solid punch Harry had given him. Harry rubbed his knuckles, noting a few small cuts - probably from Malfoy's teeth. He took a deep breath as they went into the hospital, bracing himself for Madam Pomfrey's reaction.
"Really. In a year involving a forced bond, shattered windows, a honeymoon in the middle of the school year and a mysterious near-death experience, a proposition from me rates as one of the stranger moments. You do know how to sweet-talk a boy, don't you?"
He sighed and watched their boys sleeping. God, if only things were different... if only this were a regular sleepover, both kids healthy and happy, Draco staying here with them, if only they could go back to before the accident, before their break-up...
Kara poked her head in. "Oh!" she said, coming back into the room, followed by Bill and the boys. "Bill was right, then. He said you'd be done by now. By the way, do either of you know what one of these does?" she asked, showing Harry and Draco an Extendable Ear. "Bill wouldn't tell me."
"Thanks," he told her, hugged Ben and stood up, determined not to worry about them. "Now you be good to your grandparents, and don't get into any trouble," he told them firmly. Both boys nodded absently, but Harry could tell the promise of pumpkin pasties was too much for them to be able to hear a word he said.
"He's terrified," said Ron. "Haven't seen him this out of it since..." he shook his head, trailing off.
Draco rolled his eyes and sat back, laying his head on Harry's shoulder as Harry continued to stroke his hair. "Finally. I'm never going to listen to my cousin again."
, that felt good - he made a sound in his throat, kissing Malfoy with a bit more confidence, pulling him closer, more determined, wanting so much more...
Molly gazed at Alec and Ben fondly, and tucked the blanket up a little higher on them both. "Take care of them, dear," she said to Harry, giving him a tight hug. She turned to go, then touched Draco's shoulder. "And please... take care of Harry."
"Who did I have to blow to get this? Erm, excuse me, that's not a terribly polite thing to say on our anniversary." Draco smirked. "I have my sources."
, admitting he needs help in order to deal with Harry. Making Harry feel about three feet tall, because Malfoy's impatient with him in part because he's Malfoy, and impatience is how he reacts to Harry, but also in part because Harry is acting like a scared child and he knows it.
he calls it a small scene," said Kara, rolling her eyes. "When I'm tryin' to tell him we need to move out of here, he's--"
He swallowed as the image of Draco cried and drew in on himself, shivering and angry with himself for his weakness, for his failure, for disappointing Lucius.
"You sure?" Draco gave him a slow lick, his own groin starting to ache with arousal as Harry shuddered.
Just separate yourself from this, Draco told himself. Don't let it touch you. You're not really here.
"Bread roll?" he asked, taking a small bite of his own, finally taking pity on Harry's cluelessness and helping him to order a very promising Feuilleté de Ris de Veau for starters, choosing the Fricassée de Gambas for himself.
"Well, that was certainly... unexpected," said the portrait of Severus Snape. "The children of Gregory Goyle, Draco Malfoy, Harry Potter, and a Weasley, all sitting together at the Hufflepuff table." He glanced at the other side of the Hall. "And the first Goyle in history to be Sorted into Ravenclaw. The Hat has finally gone senile."
"You know, there's all sorts of ways to get around infertility, if that's the problem," Trina said as Draco came back into the room. "You never know, you may want to expand your family some day. I know a few gay men who-"
Bill clapped him on the back. "There's nothing magical there," he said. "I can guarantee you that. Whoever it is may not know how to spell, but they were smart enough to know their magic could be traced, if they used it. What with the papers going on and on about your curse-breaking prowess."
"Extraordinary circumstances," she said crisply. "Speaking of which," she checked her watch. "Draco should be done work now, right?"
happening, but he still didn't want to believe it. They were all gathered, and the magic was rising, waiting to draw all of them in, but it felt dreamlike, far away. As though they couldn't really be here, couldn't really be about to do this, such a mismatched group of people, such an unreal situation.
Ben nodded. McCormack, Roberta went to the Gryffindor table, and Midgen, Louise took her place on the stool.
Pale faces around the table, a buzz going around the Great Hall and teachers getting up, so much like that day so long ago when they both collapsed, except this time Snape and McGonagall were rushing to the same table and neither boy was unconscious, and Snape looked half-livid and half-nauseated, unconsciously rubbing his forearm, and none of them could touch either boy, what with the bond having just been renewed. Harry murmuring quickly to Malfoy. Malfoy's breathing laboured, his body rigid, his forehead against Harry's and his eyes clenched tight.
"Oh, it is. I've half a mind to throw up a LookNot Charm and slip under the table and see just how h-"
"Weasley-" Malfoy starts in slight alarm at his own voice, then steels himself and carries on. "If you can manage somehow to alter your diction while you're using my voice, that'll probably help a great deal."
He suppressed a sigh. Funny how, months later, he still mourned the loss of Fred's friendship. But after Fred had gone to the papers and exposed Draco to the public, there was no coming back from a betrayal like that. Besides, Fred had never done anything to make up for it, either. No apology, nothing. Nothing but a - by now irrelevant - promise to not go to the press again.
Draco drew in his breath as a tear spilled down his cheek, and he looked away from Flint's mocking sneer.
And then Harry wakes up, usually feeling ill or nauseated. And he can see that Harry feels better when Draco touches him, whatever guise he's currently wearing. And he decides to give it one more day.
The steady Latin incantations from the three in the inner circle seemed adequate to what they were trying to do, repeating the balancing purpose of the spell itself, and they provided a welcome distraction for Lucius as the inner circle brought them all closer to the moment when all of Lucius' careful planning, all his hard work, would be undone. Damn Dumbledore, damn Esposito and Pomfrey by backing him up, damn even Draco for choosing to stay here instead of going to Lucius' Healers in the first place-
She sat up, blinking and trying to make sense of the chaos, and soon realized that most of the people in the waiting room didn't seem hurt. Many were covered in dust, and there was some blood and bandages to be seen, but the majority of people not in Healer robes seemed to be friends and family of those who were hurt. She looked up and saw Ron, Harry, and Malfoy, all of them dusty and wearing St. Mungo's-issue shirts, Malfoy with a black eye and no glasses, and Harry with a large gash over his cheek, his NewFace amulet gone.
"That's all right, then. I dunno when I fell in love with you. I was so pissed at you, and the fucking bond. That's why I got angry that time, when we were suspended."
Not that Harry was rough at all, unless Draco wanted him to be, but the human body didn't appear to be built to do this so many times in a row. And while on the one hand he was rather thrilled to have had so much sex that he was reaching the limits of his body's tolerance, on the other hand... well, ouch. He pulled back with a slight hiss as Harry's hand slipped down his lower back and between his legs.
"Don't talk," Harry interrupted him and kissed him again, clinging and not particularly caring. His head was throbbing, and his back hurt, and his eyes still felt gritty with lack of sleep, all of him weary and worn, and no doubt Draco felt the same way, but it didn't matter. It didn't matter at all. He felt better than he could remember feeling in years. He kissed Draco again and felt warmth spreading through him as Draco's arms tightened around him and he surrendered to Harry, mouth opening under his, hands grasping him, running through his hair - and there was no way either of them was up for much more than this, whether they were near the kids or not, but there was something intensely comforting about it anyway...
"Protecting the kiddies, are you?" Anne sneered. "You'll protect ours from hearing their parents disagree, but it's all right to leave Ginny's son alone and not protect him from a Death Eater? From being taught all sorts of--"
"Girls. Not that I wonder as in, you know, wanting to do anything about it, just... I don't know. I get... I guess, curious or... something."
Harry blushed to the roots of his hair, and Draco had to remind himself that mockery right now might not lead to a satisfactory conclusion. "What's it feel like?"
Yule Ball, Malfoys beginning to rise again, Lucius proud of Draco. Fellow students organize a circle dance.
Ben looked around for the kids who'd been in their compartment on the Express. He spotted one of them, a small, lively black-haired girl, but in place of the friendly smile she'd had on the Express, she was now looking at him with suspicion as a gangly blond girl next to her whispered in her ear. Tiny eyes on the blonde girl, her mouth pursed up in distaste.
"Had I known your mother was a Weasley," the Hat said, "I would've told the other lad that you'd be a Gryffindor too."
"Why would I walk out on you again? There'd be no point, the entire Wizarding world already knows about--"
"Let him sleep," he'd said curtly, shuffling the cards. "I can deal with this on my own. I'm sure I'll wake him up screaming in an hour or so anyway." And Neville felt the way Malfoy almost always made him feel, like a bumbling, ineffective idiot.
She whipped out her wand, nodding at Malfoy to sit on the nearest bed, and pulled Harry closer, ignoring his gasp of pain at her touch.
"Go back to sleep," Draco murmured impatiently and stood up, leaned over Alec and touched Harry's shoulder to gently push him back down.
Harry nodded, remembering the expression on Draco's face when he'd seen, for the first time, words praising him for his actions at the stadium collapse. People he'd never met, pointing out that perhaps the former Death Eater had paid his debt to society and should be left in peace. He couldn't help but wonder how much those words had done to make Draco approach him as he had a few hours later, a hesitant look in his eyes and a half-spoken apology for having walked out on Harry.
"You'd both probably go now, before somebody stumbles over you," the portrait added, and it was odd how he could sound regretful over Draco's departure and eager for Harry to be gone, at the same time. "Entertaining as it would be to watch you try to explain your presence here without implicating Longbottom."
"We'll see you tomorrow," said Hermione, as he and Harry carried their sleeping children to the Floo.
God, he'd missed this. Harry gave himself to the kiss, noting distantly that though it wasn't exactly arousing - not with two sleeping children lying two feet away from them - it felt better than just about anything he could ever remember. The rush of relief, and elation, and a sense of coming home, of everything becoming right again--
Cornfoot's mouth quirked slightly and he leaned a little closer, pitching his voice a little louder but still low enough to not be overheard over the background hum of students working on their charms around them. "I am asking if you would like to engage in sexual activity."
"He can't win with you, can he?" Hermione said. "If he's around Harry and Alec, he's bad for them; if he leaves, he's a selfish coward."
Granger hadn't said anything about dirty talk at the dinner table, but what she didn't know wouldn't hurt her.
He's gone from grudging acceptance to forgiveness, Ron thinks. He'll have to talk to Hermione about it.
He shut the little voice up and closed his eyes, trying to remember what Pansy had done the last time they'd been together. Um... no, Pansy was a bit pervy and what she'd done just might shock Harry into celibacy for the rest of the week. Eileen had been nice, though. She had... he tentatively moved to lick Harry, and was rewarded by a hiss of indrawn breath. He opened his mouth, pressing an open-mouthed kiss along the side, sliding his lips up slightly, barely touching Harry with his tongue, and had to quickly move back as Harry gasped and his hips jerked up reflexively.
Draco looked away as Harry went to get Alec, and was silent as he and Alec said their goodbyes to Ben.
Thankfully, the articles had finally begun to taper off. The solid front of Weasley support about the whole affair had helped a great deal.
He worked his way down Harry's neck, down to his chest, slowly licking and biting down Harry's body and slowing down as he got to his stomach, and Harry smiled, his eyes closed in pleasure, and started to pull him back up. Draco stopped him and instead went a little lower.
All right, now Draco felt like laughing and crying, which was just... ridiculous. And generations of Malfoys were probably spinning in their graves.
"Because I don't want to feel this. We don't love each other. We don't even like each other. I don't want to-"
One more day, and please, please, let there be some sort of cure for this. It's foolish to hope for something so impossible, but Harry's come through so many impossible predicaments before. There's got to be some way for him to get out of this, and Draco's willing to risk quite a bit - within reason - to give Harry the chance to be rescued yet again. There's got to be something that will save him.
Kara shook her head. "This is wrong, Draco. I may not understand everything you explained to me, but I understand enough to know ye're nae doing the right thing. For any of ye."
"Mr. Potter?" she said softly, and somehow Ron and George and Arthur were all instantly awake, as was Harry, standing up unsteadily, his face going pale, unconsciously reaching for Malfoy's hand. Malfoy took it and stood up with him, and they approached the Healer together.
Harry glanced around at the stunned expressions of everyone around the table, and met Bill's steady gaze. They'll get used to it, Bill had said.
in their corruption of the wizarding world, taking pride in their disgraceful poverty and blood traitor's ways, and he wanted them all dead, Weasley and his father and his sister and all their pestilent relations, and all those like him, like Longbottom and his pathetic parents, and Potter and his pathetic little friends, and the anger and hatred were growing, flames of contempt and disgust rising up from Parkinson's daughter towards Longbottom too, and from Longbottom and the Mudblood and Severus and from Draco, hating Potter with a passion, Potter hating him back, drawing the hatred to new heights, and there was enough hatred now in Lucius to let fly a dozen Avada Kedavras, to immolate Potter and all of his ilk, and free Draco from them and from this horrible curse - free
"The effect of the Veritaserum." He looked away from Flint, keeping his tone and expression as non-confrontational as possible. "It's out of my system."
Lucius shook his head, slightly irate as the leakage of images from other circle members flitted past the edges of his consciousness. Indistinct and nebulous but persistent, defying his attempts to block them out completely. A young Slytherin girl holding a Quidditch Cup high - Esposito, surely. If only Draco had known that kind of accomplishment; but no, Potter had snatched it away from him every single year, in one way or another.
"I'll leave their wands in your safe-box, Poppy," Snape told her as she began her examination. "And I'm leaving Mr. Malfoy in your care while I contact his parents."
"Don't say anything like Happy Anniversary," Hermione said softly, and Draco threw her a puzzled look as he stepped into the Floo.
"It's all right if you don't think about her as much," she said. "That's supposed to happen, eventually."
He would have time to deal with the fallout later, he tried to reassure himself. The Malfoys had fallen before and risen again, under his leadership. They would do so again.
"By which I mean this isn't something they can decide with all of us hanging on their every word," he said firmly, picking up Ben.
It was been fun and challenging to write kid-POVs, but I was kinda wishing I hadn't planned to do two of them so close together, and very glad there were no more planned for the rest of the story. Two was enough :)
And Azkaban kept crowding into his head between questions. Azkaban, with its greyness, its cold and hunger and boredom. Too many chances to regret everything he had ever done wrong in his life, burn over every unfairness he'd endured, too many chances to become the person he'd been when he'd finally left it - angry, cynical, bitter.
"Other than you and my brother, I don't know," she said. "But I've friends in Ravenclaw. They're in third year, and my mum used to be friends with their mums. They know some pretty good hexes. They'll deal with anybody who wants to be nasty to us," she said grimly. "D'you know anybody?"
Harry nodded nervously. "We'd better get going, then," he said, and went to say goodbye to Alec and Ben, as Ron and Hermione got ready to go as well.
There was a round of applause from the table next to Slytherin. Ben counted up. That was two Gryffindor, three Ravenclaw, one Slytherin and one Hufflepuff already. He gave the Hufflepuff table a long look.
Draco fiddled with his watch. "Kara... Kara said there's a possible position at the Royal College opening soon."
"Hermione taught it to me." The soft strains of something that sounded vaguely familiar trickled into the room.
"I hate to say it," Ron said, "but it's hard to feel too much sympathy for him. With everything he's been saying since forever? It was bound to come back to bite him in the arse eventually."
"Fair enough. Now, let's go, before we get Neville in trouble." They hurried towards the edge of the castle grounds.
It's all old hat to them, he knows; Ron's been Malfoy more often than he's been himself in the last two days, Neville's been Malfoy four times and Dean three, Parkinson has been shepherding them all through all their classes and meals - even Blaise Zabini has helped, making sure Ron didn't give himself away in the Slytherin boys' dorm last night. But right now Seamus is realizing that insisting on taking a turn was not a good idea, at all.
"Glad B-ben's all right," said George quietly as he, Fred, Hermione, and Ron trailed slowly behind Arthur and Harry.
"Mr. Potter?" said a soft voice behind him, and he moved aside automatically so that the visiting Healer could take another reading from Alec.
Kara certainly loved it here; she was getting gigs almost every day, she was where the action was, and her star was rising. Paradoxically, she was a better mother now that she wasn't around as much any more, because she missed Ben, and made the most of her time with him, instead of dragging him along to most of her functions. Not that she'd ever been a bad mother, per se. Just a somewhat distracted one.
Narcissa nodded calmly and turned, glancing an unspoken signal at Lucius and he followed her into the small office next door.
There was a long pause as Draco went back to his list, before something niggled at him and he looked up. "Why, does it bother you?"
"Fuck chivalry!" Fred snapped. "I won't put up with my mother shunning you; I'm not putting the kids through that."
Bugger. Now that he had the chance to lie, he really couldn't take it. He felt an almost overwhelming urge tell Flint nothing but rubbish, and then somehow have it come back and bite him in the arse, wanted to see Flint's face when he realized Draco had been lying, but he couldn't. He couldn't afford to. He couldn't make any enemies. What if some day all that stood between Draco and freedom, Draco and being able to return to Ben, was what they asked the Aurors who had been present today, and they talked to Flint?
Not to mention Dean Thomas not being able to follow a discussion about football, Dean thinks, as he stares at his own face and voice talking with Parkinson. What if Justin Finch-Fletchley or Anthony Goldstein come by to visit Harry, and Malfoy can't figure out how to carry on a conversation with them? What if he somehow lets slip his complete ignorance of and contempt for the Muggle world, when he's supposedly Muggle-born?
"'Possibly dating' isn't the same as living together. And I'm not particularly worried about the people who hate me because of you."
"Right." Draco let himself be pulled up to his feet and started to undo his shirt buttons as Harry headed for the washroom, then paused at the door.
"You have no fucking clue," she interrupted with a bitter laugh. "You were surrounded by people who were all working on the side of the precious Light, and you have no idea what it's like, being around that kind of poison. I won't allow it, not for Ginny's son!"
How long would he go, missing Ben? Missing Harry, missing Alec, and even Kara? Who would wake Harry up at night when he had nightmares? Who would make music with Alec? Who would hold Draco when he woke up from a nightmare of Azkaban, only to find the nightmare had become real again?
"Didn't break anything this time," said Fred tightly, struggling to clear the anger coursing through him.
Sod them, then. He turned his back on them both and looked around the Hall curiously as the Hat cried out, "SLYTHERIN!" and a boy joined the long table to the far right, to a smattering of applause from that table.
And speaking of eyelids, his were still gritty from lack of sleep. He rubbed them wearily, glancing at Draco and noting dark shadows under his eyes too. Vaguely wondering what his own face looked like right now, and deciding he probably didn't want to know.
"Comfortable. And safe. Even though it's distressingly close to your friends, and I'm not entirely thrilled at how often they traipse through it." Draco speared his last piece of broccoli. "It's better than the safehouse I was in a few months ago." He shrugged. "Besides, this won't go on forever. Someday enough of the Death Eaters will be caught that we'll be able to live properly. Meantime, it's not that bad."
Bill's eyes widened and for a moment his resemblance to Arthur was quite pronounced. "Really? With electricity and everything? What for?"
Harry blushed and dropped his eyes. "Thank you." He cleared his throat, took a sip of his drink and looked around appreciatively. "This place is..." he trailed off, smiling slightly.
"Oh, Flint, strict prisoner transfer protocol," said Garritt, popping his head back into the room, and Flint waved his wand. Cuffs appeared around Draco's wrists, and shackles on his ankles.
Such a completely unpredictable situation, too. No idea whether the spell would work, no idea whether his son would live or die, no idea what would happen to their family even if this worked. Or what would happen to Draco himself; with the bond having turned Draco into such an obvious liability for Potter, it was only Lucius' loyalty to the Dark Lord that gave Draco any protection at all, and the Dark Lord would be furious at Lucius' outright betrayal. And the easiest way for him to get revenge on Lucius would be to strike him where he was most vulnerable...
"He was wearing the amulets we haven't put on the market yet. And all our counter-charms in the lab are for the new versions. Not for the ones Aurors already have."
"Hold on," Ron said. "Aren't you always lecturing me about 'discipline has to follow the misbehaviour immediately'?"
"Do you t-two need to be left alone?" George asked. Harry and Draco gave each other slightly panicked looks. "That would b-be a yes. Let's go." He turned on his heel, grabbing Percy's elbow and dragging him out despite his protestations.
Harry blinked, confused. "You mean... why, because Ben was hurt? Did she think that was some sort of... punishment for that?"
"Move where, Daddy?" Alec's small voice piped up behind them, and Harry started. He and Draco glanced at each other in alarm. When had the boys come in? "Who's moving?" Alec repeated.
"I - I want to be with my brother Alec," he whispered. "He's small, and he's shy. And he gets distracted and doesn't really talk to people if I'm not there. Please, he's my responsibility."
When this chapter was first written I was a little blue; my own choir was supposed to have done a concert December 16, where we were going to sing Balulalow, Praise His Holy Name, and Handel's Hallelujah. The concert was cancelled when about a million-jillion inches of snow fell on us that day. ::sniff::
Oh Merlin. With that disapproving glare set in Neville's face, with Neville's eyes that look so much like his grandmother's, and his jaw that he now realizes looks like his grandmother's when she's angry with him... right now, Draco Malfoy currently very much resembles Augusta Longbottom. All he needs is a huge handbag and a hat with a large bird perched on top.
Ron still shudders when he remembers the vicious hatred in Malfoy's voice as he wished his father dead. Can't find it in himself to censure Malfoy.
The Hat chuckled. "Well they'll have to be proud of you in Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, lad, because there's no way I'll place you in Slytherin - or in Ravenclaw, for all that you've got a fine mind for music. Which will it be, then?"
Ronald Weasley, a fitting offspring to his ridiculous, pathetic father, by Draco's reports at least.
"You know, I believe we've danced this one before," Draco said dryly, much more comfortable now that the tables were turned. He laughed at Cornfoot's reddening face. "Did you think I was going to turn you down?"
Harry laughed. "No, I was just wondering. Weddings are usually a big deal in the wizarding world, aren't they? Like in the Muggle world?"
Weasley was remembering a Dementor sucking all of the heat from a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, but for Lucius, cold was a cell in Azkaban. Apparently cold was Azkaban for Narcissa as well: a small courtyard where she waited, shivering, to be allowed inside by the arrogant guards who delighted in showing their contempt for her, for Lucius, for everything they stood for.
"Kara's been spending a lot of time with Ben lately," Draco said abruptly. "A lot more than I thought she would."
Anne glared at him. "Ginny was the first person in your entire family other than George who was actually decent to me," she said grimly. "And I am
Harry gave a shaky laugh of his own. "It's close enough." He kissed Draco again, then cleared his throat. "OK, well, if we're done talking for now... we've got a bedroom to christen."
Narcissa gave him a grimly appraising look, then pursed her lips and suddenly passed her wand over his face. He felt a strange tingling and realized she was probably getting rid of all evidence of his lack of control. She examined him dispassionately, frowned for a moment, then passed her wand over her own face, making her eyes red-rimmed and her cheeks flushed.
Fred sighed and ran a hand through his hair. This was just not on. Not any more. Their kids couldn't keep being exposed to this kind of shit. It wasn't healthy. It had been different, before kids - it had even been a bit exciting, in a way; for one thing, the make-up sex was incredible. But now...
This is unbetaed. If you spot anything amiss, or are confused by anything, please let me know and I'll love you forever!
"I'm not homophobic," he tells her heatedly. "I didn't mind that they were together. I just didn't see why they had to do... some things in public."
"You're welcome to do any wandless cleaning charms you can, but you're not leaving the hospital," Pomfrey said grimly.
Harry took a bite of biscuit, though to tell the truth he wasn't that hungry. He gazed at Ben, noting how utterly different he looked when asleep. His eyes were the same shape and roughly the same colour as Draco's, but asleep, the resemblance between the two was far less pronounced. Although come to think of it, Ben's face, once it lost its baby fat, might turn out a bit angular... maybe in the cheekbones... the eyebrows, though, and the hairline, were all Kara.
The larger political ramifications of this liaison are difficult to predict. In recent weeks, as news of Death Eater activity has risen, many have speculated that Lucius Malfoy has returned to his previous position alongside You-Know-Who. If true, his son's relationship with the Boy Who Lived will no doubt put that position in doubt. What consequences this will have for the Malfoy family, for Harry Potter, and for us all, are too numerous to contemplate.
He bit back a bitter laugh. What control. He had no control whatsoever. Never mind not being able to attend the meeting going on right now, never mind having to submit to whatever the adults decided at that meeting. Since that miserable day in September he'd lost practically all control over everything in his life: who he spent his time with, where he lived, what he felt...
He checked their supply of Floo powder. Last day of term at Trinity College was May ninth, and he was eagerly anticipating the end of his daily commute. Saying goodbye to the people he'd known there would be a bit harder; he'd grown closer to his Muggle students and choir members, and the choir children, than he'd thought possible, and was only now realizing he'd genuinely miss many of them.
"You broke me. I know you did. Merlin." Draco kept his eyes closed and distantly wondered if he'd blacked out somewhere in there. Wondered if he was going to black out right now. Certainly felt like it.
"It's just too much like the day Ginny died," Fred said flatly, and George's eyes filled with tears as Fred finally spoke what they'd all been trying to avoid thinking. "Part of why Bill and Percy didn't want to be here. Too much déjà vu. Not that Harry won't be thinking it anyway." Malfoy nodded, gazing at Harry, and Hermione could almost feel his need to go to him. "Fuck," said Fred, shaking his head, "it's just like that day-" he stopped as the treatment area door opened, and Hermione's heart skipped a beat. It had opened several times in the last half hour, and although it was comforting to note that the relatives and friends the Healers talked to had almost all seemed relieved, and some had left smiling, the tension was getting higher as the crowd thinned around them.
"Bloody hell," muttered Draco, and Harry's heart sank. He hadn't been paying much attention, but had seen a few headlines in papers left discarded in the hospital. Apparently the accident at the stadium had made the news in a big way, and was still newsworthy almost a week later. Between the publicity and the letters and e-mails and few Howlers he'd received, he couldn't blame Draco if Draco decided to hide from the wizarding world for the next ten years, as soon as he was able to take Ben home.
It was such a pure feeling, though. Seductive, addictive, clean and bright. Hatred for those who opposed them, for those who weakened them. And it was so hard to keep enough control to stop himself from focusing that powerful emotion on people who were part of this circle. Instead he thought as hard as he could of Peter Pettigrew, that loathsome little maggot whom they had to allow into their midst. Thought of Mad-Eye Moody and his rabid anti-Dark mania that had made it so difficult for Lucius to stay out of Azkaban sixteen years ago, and get out of Azkaban last year. Thought of the supercilious Aurors who had taken such delight in humiliating him and laughing at his helplessness while he was in a cell, so small and cold and dark, so - so much like a small room under a set of stairs... with a shock Lucius recognized a small version of Potter, recognized hatred boiling up out of Potter, towards... his Muggle relatives?
"You never know," Harry said. "He may move back there at some point in his life, and get it back. Or pick it up. You did."
It's only for three hours, Dean tells himself as they walk out of the hospital wing. He can do this. He may be wearing a Slytherin's face and body, but right now what he really needs is some solid Gryffindor courage.
It just took time. We just needed to get to know each other as people. The four days helped a lot. And we both really wanted it to work. We'd put each other through a lot, so we knew we had to really work to make things better.
For his son, who had again made the wrong choice, choosing to be here, with Potter, not clever or brave enough to leave when offered a chance to try to work with the Healers Lucius had hired. That was who Lucius was giving everything up for, that was who would be his downfall in the end, his own son.
The room was stunned silence. Draco knew his mouth was had fallen slightly and snapped it shut. He needed to keep his face neutral. He knew eyes were flicking between himself and Davis.
“Do you want this?” His eyes had become uncertain and his breathy voice was hardening in anticipation of a rejection.
His hand slipped like a traitor back into the silky inky stands of hair. He couldn’t deny himself this one small thing, compromised as he was.  When he thought of how many times, he had resisted that urge. Harrys hair always looked a mess, no different starting a match to when he finished so Draco was always surprised to find how fucking soft it was and how its curled so gently around each of his questing fingers. The image of his hand running through black locks as they ley entwined in bed flashed behind his eyes, Harry panting beneath him with want as he pushed into him, petting and soothing him, gentle hands turning harsh and twisting the strands as he tipped over.
Aster Mendes and Pip Summers clapped his shoulder and ruffled his hair respectively and then backed off and let him be. He knew he was throwing out daggers in every direction. It was a skill he had inherited from the most ancient and noble house of Black. His mother and Aunts were skilled at it and now it was his duty to keep up family tradition. The air around him was a degree cooler than comfortable and he knew anyone who stayed in his presence too long would feel the metallic tang of unwelcome soon enough. His father had called it ‘his mother’s little trick’ and had told him to use it himself was cowardly and womanish… Fucker. It was what kept him and his mother unharmed and unmolested for the months when his Father had allowed his home to be desecrated.  He’d take cowardly and womanish over wandering hands and unwelcome attention any day. Now it spilled outwards a reflex and while he could feel any good will toward him shirking with its emission, he could not make himself pull it inward.
Harry stared at the frozen tableau before him: Alec with his fist still raised, Remy starting to lunge towards him, Ben and Michelle poised to join in. He heard a moan of dismay and turned to see Molly shaking her head, and almost all of the other adults staring at the frozen children as well.
"Oh shit," Charlie said, and Harry caught sight of an owl flying into the kitchen with a red letter in its beak seconds before it dropped the envelope and sped away. He blinked, startled, as the envelope unfolded itself in front of him and a shrill voice shrieked out "
you, Molly can get all the fit, available men she wants to just 'happen to show up' whenever we go have dinner at the Burrow; it doesn't mean I'll take them up on the offer. And I told you, if you wanted me and Alec to spend Christmas with you and Ben, I was perfectly willing to-"
"He's as good as--" Draco began dismissively, then cut himself off and looked away. "I just don't think--"
Kara nodded distractedly, glancing around the waiting room. "So... this is a hospital? Is there - is Ben in surgery?"
"I'll... we'll work it out. And I'll take the boys to the game," Harry said. "Ben's been looking forward to it forever. We don't have to - you can just drop him off at my place. We don't have to see each other."
"Bollocks," Harry shot back. "You are. You're not all that concerned about what Dumbledore or anybody else at school might do, but you're terrified of the fact that your father is in there with them."
"Mr. Potter, we're supposed to give Alec another dose of Nasturtium potion now." She started to pour one of the potions by the bed into a small silver spoon, muttering a spell at it. She glanced at Draco shyly. "Mr. Malfoy, I was asked to tell you that your little boy is doing very well. Should be released early, in an hour or two. He's looking forward to seeing his teddy."
"Most of it's just been stupid," he told Demelza. "Nasty letters, a few people trying to write 'Death Eater' on his door. Which would've puzzled the hell out of his Muggle neighbours. But there's always the risk of somebody with a serious grudge." Harry smiled at her. "It's been loads better than it could've been, though. Erm... I never did thank you. For what you said in the paper."
"From the boredom of the class, I'm sure," Cornfoot said smoothly, and segued into a quick, concise review of the day's topic. Draco listened with half his attention, the other half trying very hard not to think about how... cold all of this had been. Student A wants sexual experience; Student B wants suitable distraction; they schedule a mutually convenient time, and carry on as before. No worry about motivations or politics or personalities or feelings.
"Blaise already knows what we're doing, and I don't talk to Crabbe or Goyle or anybody else in Slytherin any more. I'm sure even Weasley could pull this off till morning."
Don't look at Harry, he reminded himself. It was normally a bit of a charge, knowing Harry was in the audience, occasionally catching his eye... but he wouldn't put it past Harry to raise an eyebrow suggestively, or smile at him the way he
And he was actually seriously considering it, he realized. "This is definitely one of the stranger moments I've had this year," he muttered.
"I have had just about enough of you and your little clan's insufferable nobility," Anne said through gritted teeth. "Oh, we all care so much about Alec! We all want what's best for Alec--"
"They'll be all right, dear," said Molly, as he hugged a very sticky Alec. "I've got Ben's spell on me now, and there's pumpkin pasties as soon as we're done cleaning up here." She glanced around the yard and sighed. "Or at least done ungluing the children who are stuck together."
He took a deep breath. Well, then, he and Ben would just go back to the way they had been before. It didn't matter. They'd been happy enough before Harry; they'd be all right.
"Speaking of newspapers," said Demelza, startling Harry out of some very pleasant memories, "your dad asked me to gather some for papier mache." She released her now cleanish little boy.
He still woke up with nightmares of Azkaban, of the inexorable death of his soul, crushed down by grey and cold and cruelty and indifference. Crushed by being treated as less than human, until it was impossible to not think of himself as less than human too. And now his nightmares just might be coming true.
"Potter..." Harry started as he felt Malfoy put a gentle hand on his shoulder. "Why would that be the end of the world?"
," Seamus says forcefully. "So don't go making assumptions about her either." Parkinson gapes at him, momentarily off-balance. "And stop making assumptions about me too while you're at it!"
Draco nodded. "Yes, of course. My choir won't sing again for a while after that. Ben, stop picking," he said, pulling Ben's fingers away from his nose.
Draco nodded, as always a bit uneasy when one of the other Weasleys spoke to him. He checked his watch.
," the younger Healer said coldly, and Kara looked up at him, puzzled. "We do have rules, you know," he said, eyeing Malfoy disdainfully.
If he could only lash out at them, just once. Take down Dumbledore, destroy Potter as he should've been destroyed sixteen years ago, do
Yes. I really am this obsessive. I was bored during one of my own classes one day and created three Hogwarts student schedules. Decided to use two of them for this story when I started writing it. They're slightly AU, in that I started the story before Half-Blood Prince came out, so all that had been mentioned was that certain teachers wouldn't allow students into their 6th and 7th year classes if they didn't do well on the OWLs. I had figured Neville probably wouldn't be in Potions, but thought some other non-brilliant students (Goyle, for example) probably would be. Which, um, no. I also figured Potions would be small enough that it would have students from all houses, but didn't realize that most of the other classes would also be mixed. Or that Potions would only have about 8 students. So in my story, most classes are still pretty full and are usually only composed of one or two houses.
"Is quite lovely and we're all very proud of you drawing it up, dear," they heard Molly say patiently. "We'll just let it go for tonight, all right? Into the Floo with you, now," she said, and there was a whoosh as the Floo activated.
"No thanks," Draco said stiffly. "Well, Harry, you've got your family here - I'll get out of the way--"
He swallowed the last of the espresso and picked up the card. "Granger, would you mind checking this for charms and spells?"
"No it doesn't. It's the truth. I'm not saying it to change your mind, because you're probably right." He sighed heavily. "I
but Harry was hot when he got this intense. It made everything else fade away - the unfamiliar setting, the Scotch, whatever the hell they'd been talking about, all of it. He gasped as Harry pulled his belt free and started working his way into Draco's trousers, and he redoubled his efforts at getting Harry's shirt off despite the dizzying things Harry's fingers were starting to do to him-
"You don't have to - I mean, you could both stay with us. Until - until you found a job..." Damn, that was probably also the wrong thing to say. Draco was fiercely proud of having gone from pampered rich boy, to parolee left with barely enough inheritance to eke out a living by the wizarding world, to financially independent member of the Muggle world. And now Harry was offering to make him a kept man. Nicely done.
There is no way to tell how long the couple has been back together, or indeed if they ever really separated other than formally, though officially the wizarding world had been led to believe that they had. Indeed, in the last few weeks, Malfoy has been linked to various other people at the school, including a Muggle-born Hufflepuff girl, an unnamed teacher, and fellow Slytherin Quidditch teammate Seamus Finnigan. Potter has also been linked to various fellow students, male and female, although none of those speculations has been printed in these pages, as The Prophet is not in the habit of exposing the private lives of Hogwarts students without reason or evidence.
"Kara, let's see if I can help you with that toy." Bill bundled Kara and the boys all back to Ben's room.
"You don't have children, do you?" Draco asked, and Flint shook his head. "Your child comes first, no matter who you're in love with."
"No, no, we have to-" He gasped put one hand on Malfoy's chest, pushing him back gently. God, how completely frustrating - more so because he could feel Malfoy's frustration as well as his own, and they were both so tightly wound it was rather agonizing. He put his forehead against Malfoy's shoulder, barely restraining himself from saying to hell with it and going right back to snogging him. "God, I'd no idea stopping would be this um, hard," he muttered, and Malfoy chuckled.
He kept his eyes closed, breathing steadily, concentrating on Ben and Harry and Alec and Kara. Holding his fears at bay with his memories, precious and warm, and all his own. Memories that reminded him that he was still a human being. That he wasn't just a thing to be questioned, a body to be locked away, but a person, worthy of caring and affection, worthy of respect and loyalty - all of which he had earned on his own, with no name or family or connections to bestow them upon him automatically.
"Not that long, actually. Got here about an hour ago. Demelza was here again, reading, but she mentioned her twins seem to be coming down with something, so I sent her home."
BTW, the poetry-inducing Wheeze idea is not mine. It sprang from the imagination of scrtkpr, whose Poetic Justice deserves a special place in the annals of H/D fic :)
Ron chases the taste away with a generous mouthful of butterbeer, and feels the change begin. Disgusting, disturbing, and uncomfortable as hell. His face is... bubbling, there's no better word for it, and he can feel his limbs doing a weirdly simultaneous stretch and contract. He's shrinking, very slightly, and Malfoy's impeccable, finely tailored uniform starts to feel a little more comfortable. He puts his head down, holding on to the back of a chair, closing his eyes to keep the confusing stimuli down to a minimum. Last time he did this - was it really five years ago? He ended up retching over a toilet, but this time it's not so bad. There's some merit in taking a potion brewed by a Potions master rather than a twelve-year-old girl, no matter how brilliant the girl.
another chance - to do this on his own schedule. Malfoy had said before that he didn't want Harry under some potion. Maybe Harry could capitalise on that, help Malfoy stand against his father, if need be.
Parkinson snorts cynically, then smiles and leans closer to him and he's momentarily disoriented. "Draco, come on, we don't want to be late," she says, raising her voice slightly, and he's totally thrown off during the second it takes him to remember just what it is they're doing. He tries to blank out his face so that the gaggle of first years walking past don't notice he's not actually Draco Malfoy. Not that any of them are looking.
Robbie wandered into the kitchen, still red-eyed and sniffling from the fright he'd suffered, and Fred made himself give his son a comforting smile. "Come here, Robbie," he said, and sat down, taking his son onto his lap. Robbie hugged him close, and Fred smiled and tickled him, making him giggle and drowning out the sound of Anne and Michelle still fighting - and settling his own turbulent emotions as well.
Draco hesitated a moment. "And it doesn't bother you that you won't get to... to know what it's like, with a girl?"
Draco wiped at his eyes, finally settling himself down as well. "Screaming nightmares. Yeah." He sighed and shook his head ruefully. "I'd say a few of them will."
Talk about housing after school and being attracted to other people. Both playing Quidditch again. Draco finds out his father found the caster.
“Am I supposedly some sort of altruist now? It’s ironic that becoming a murderer would improve your opinion of me. I assure you I’m just as terrible as I’ve always been.”
It was a small space made smaller by the number of people in it. Two of his Aurors, Bones and Farley, were stationed at the entrance. Three Healers were tending to a small, supine form wrapped tightly in gauze. That must have been Scorpius. In the bed situated adjacent to his lay Draco Malfoy himself. He looked awful. His face was bisected by several large, disfiguring scars, which stretched from temple to jaw, and his immaculate blond hair was matted with blood. Like his son, he too was bandaged from waist to throat. But his eyes were the most terrible. They spoke of loss—a kind of loss Harry knew intimately. Although Scorpius would survive, Malfoy had still lost his wife and mother.
His mother reappeared at the mouth of the cabinet, but this time did not hesitate and crossed the threshold. Immediately she was pulled forward into the circle proper, body jerked into the air by the invisible threads of magic he’d woven. The wards were not powered by him, but rather by the magic of its victims, who were held in suspension until completely drained. They were both the catalyst and the conduit for the Black Kill Wards. His mother did not scream, and almost looked peaceful to him. It would not be long until he looked that way, too.
“Y-you’re just saying that to be cruel. That can’t have even crossed your mind. It’s too… mercenary.”
They were already being punished as it was. The Dark Lord seemed to delight in reminding them of their estrangement from his inner circle: shunned from meetings held in their own home and humiliated by the others at every turn. This from a filthy half-blood usurper who called himself their ruler. Bellatrix’s sycophantic devotion to him was beyond intolerable, allegiance predicated on delusion and fantasy rather than any semblance of rational thought. Blood came before all else, but where was her loyalty now? To the Dark Lord? Certainly not with her family.
“Why would that information be exclusive to me? You know I despise hearing about your ill-fated conquests. They’re always so unpleasant.”
The body of Greyback was located in the parlor, along with that of Narcissa Malfoy’s, who had been savaged almost beyond recognition. What appeared to have killed Greyback was a silver cutlery set that had been transfigured into imposing spikes. There was blood splashed across the walls and furniture, most of which had also been torn apart. If any figures had resided in the portraits before, they did not now. How the Malfoys could still live in the place where they, essentially, had been imprisoned and so many others had been tortured or murdered was unfathomable to Harry. His skin was crawling already. He could not forget Hermione’s screams, Bellatrix’s mad laughter, and the look of horror upon Malfoy’s young, blood-streaked face. Harry grimaced.
In the Auror Department, Harry’s orders were followed without question. He was respected. His reputation was that of someone who was both dutiful and fair, if perhaps too serious at times. Harry didn’t speak unless required to, and did not share personal details about his life while at work. It helped him from becoming too emotional, which he loathed. He already lost his temper enough as it was, and he could imagine nothing more humiliating than acting like a bloody wreck in front of his co-workers. It was an indicator of weakness.
Nothing more was said until they reached the hospital wing. Potter kicked open the door and half-dragged, half-carried Draco inside.
“Just let me die,” Draco slurred, sounding faint even to his own ears. “I don’t want to live like this. I’m ready. I promise, I’m ready.”
things to you, let alone anyone else. Besides, I’m just a half-blood, after all. Wouldn’t it be awfully hypocritical of me to talk down to you because you’re a werewolf now?”
“—Shut up! Just shut up, Malfoy!” Potter yelled, making an abortive lunge at him, only for Draco to rear back and spit in his face. Potter then grabbed him by the shoulders, eliciting a fresh surge of pain from the motion, and began to shake him roughly.
Draco arrived at this conclusion while peering into the broken vanishing cabinet at Borgin and Burke’s. He found clarity in the darkness. It was there he thought of Graham Montague, caught between Hogwarts and Knockturn Alley; the old volumes of forbidden magic secreted away within the hidden compartment of his trunk, those Black Family Grimoires his mother had given to him on the eve of his eleventh birthday; and the impulsivity of the Death Eaters, how they demeaned and belittled him… They would never expect him to turn against them. Not Draco Malfoy. He was just as slavishly faithful as his Aunt Bellatrix, and as much a part of the collective as the others were. There was no touch of dissent in him. No sense of pride or family honor.
over and over again? Until you’re twitching and foaming at the mouth? Or, how it feels to watch your mother cry out from the pain, knowing you can do nothing to stop it—”
“That’s not something I would brag about. Ever! And it wasn’t a poltergeist! And it was an accident!”
“The students, you mean? Those that could walk did and Potter aided the rest. They’re staying in auxiliary quarters located elsewhere in the hospital wing. Your wolf rather dismantled the infirmary proper,” Severus said, gesturing somewhere past the curtain. His face had soured upon saying the word “Potter.”
Draco paused. A line formed between his pale brows. “Werewolf-isms?” He repeated, although he wasn’t even sure he wanted to know, not really. The inside of Potter’s head was a dangerous place.
to apologize. I’ve been thinking about it since I was a teenager. I can’t stand bringing the girls around to their grandparents because all I see there is you, being yelled at by mum or hit by da—or, worse, pushed around by me. I spoke to Sarah about it, and she really thinks that—”
The year passed in a haze. His time was divided between fulfilling the role of “Malfoy,” and working tirelessly on the cabinet. But opening the connection was only the beginning, if his grimoires were to be believed. First, the vanishing cabinet would need to be repaired, and only then could the he begin to ward it. The sigils were going to take the longest. Inscribed with an athame comprised of goblin-forged silver, and filled in with the blood of the caster, they would encompass the entirety of both the exterior and interior of the Hogwarts cabinet. The other needed nothing, save for someone to take that first step into the doorway. He suspected the process of fully warding it would take until spring.
Draco stared at the shred of parchment in his hands. Potter’s uniquely horrid scrawl made his identity obvious, and his choice of owl even more so: a large, snowy beast called that recalled to mind the one of his schooldays. It looked hastily written, and even had a smear of lipstick along one edge:
At this, something in Harry’s chest tightened. It suddenly became harder for him to distance himself from the tragedy of Malfoy’s situation. He was close, too close. There was a certain level of professionalism required of someone in his position, and it had taken him years to achieve a grasp of neutrality. He still became too emotional with the harder cases, the ones with witches and children; or victims whose death or suffering came at the hands of supposed loved ones. Those caused him to delve into that wilder side of himself—the one that lived in the cupboard and reacted without thinking. The one he hated. Harry’s neck began to prickle uncomfortably. He already wanted to leave.
“Here you go, lads,” the fae interjected again, setting their drinks down. She lowered her voice, gaze fixed on Potter. “I get off in five. Meet me in the back if you’re up for a quick shag.” She left with a delicate sway of the hips.
Draco awoke in slow gradations. He felt vaguely hung-over, and still a bit pissed if he was being quite honest with himself. He staggered to his feet, swaying unsteadily as he did so. The world around him appeared indistinct and hazy at the edges. People were saying his name, but their voices were distorted, as though having passed through water. Perhaps, he reckoned, it was less that he was drunk and more that he’d been bludgeoned over the head. And more than once, at that. He didn’t know where he was, and neither could he seem to recall the past several hours. All he remembered was the vague promise of meeting up with Potter to investigate a potential hideout of Montague’s. Potter. Of course this had something to do with him. Draco still didn’t know what had happened, but throttling that bastard senseless seemed like a good place to start.
Draco had been caught breaking into Shyverwretch's Venoms and Poisons during a case and wound up tossed back in the same cell between his mother and father. It had been a full moon that night. He’d kept them up with the change: bones snapping and splintering, skin rending apart like the whole of his body was an open wound, and screams that soon turned into howls. It had been the most humiliating experience of his life. His mother had not spoken to him for days after, but the next morning his father had said something to Draco he’d never forget. He had been… kind.
Severus seemed to deflate at that, and sank into one of the nearby chairs. “You nearly died last night, Draco,” he said. “Whatever you ritual you performed, it certainly worked. Every Death Eater who passed through the vanishing cabinet has died. Greyback also succumbed to his… injuries. Being the perpetrator, what do you suggest the Headmaster and I do with you?”
Distantly, he heard the clattering of heels. “What happened?” Pomfrey said. “Oh my, Mr. Malfoy! Who did this to you?”
“He’d cornered them in the parlor. The moon hadn’t quite risen yet, but Greyback is a savage. He enjoys the change. The pain. I remember that from when he stayed at the manor during the war. He had pushed some of the wolf through somehow, and attacked them while half-transformed. Traditional spell-work isn’t effective against half-breeds like him, but I wasn’t thinking. I don’t think mother was either.”
dark wizard. He has no proper lineage upon which to draw his knowledge from, so he must rely on us for it. Worse yet, we let him,” he said, growing more irate the longer he spoke. “The Gaunts may be an old family, but they certainly are not a respected one. No shame in their deviant behaviors, nor in their ignorance of the old ways. Who knows what happened to their family grimoires. He may be the Dark Lord, but he does not have the
blond. Draco tried not to think about how much being a werewolf had and would continue to age him. For his part, Potter hardly looked a day over twenty-five. He sighed. At least his hairline wasn’t receding.
After running a meticulous search of the ground floor, which turned up nothing, they started upstairs. When he and Potter reached the first-story landing, a loud
“And twice the dead weight. Not to mention it’ll be more difficult to control two of them, rather than one.”
But then there was a growl, not outwardly audible but originating from deep within the labyrinth he’d constructed for himself. It growled again, and
Harry approached Malfoy’s bed. He was inspecting the Healers’ work critically, and his hands twitched like he yearned to wrest Scorpius from them and take him into his arms. In this light, his eyes were cold and clear, like metal. He’d become even more sharp-edged in the years since Hogwarts. Harry had not seen him since the last attack. That was eight years ago. Now where he’d once been thin and underfed, Malfoy was as tall and broad-shouldered as his father had been. Perhaps he would have even been handsome, if not for the scars.
Harry paused. “This is perhaps an… unusual offer, but if you ever find yourself in need of advice on raising a child with lycanthropy, you can owl me. Not as Head Auror— but rather, simply speaking from one father to another.” It was unprofessional, but Harry couldn’t wrest back the need to help Malfoy then.
They did not reappear anywhere near Grimmauld Place. Draco, Potter, Granger, and Weasley, did, however, materialize in a muggle garden somewhere in northern England, landing in an inelegant heap. Remus Lupin, who just so happened to have been enjoying a rather calm, if tepid, supper of crisps and canned beans in the shed of said garden, was startled by the noise. He had been squatting there for a little over a week, and had seen nothing that indicated the presence of either witches or wizards thus far, so the apparition came as a surprise. When he ran out, wand in one hand and crisp bag in the other, he was met by a tangle of limbs and groaning, swearing children—one of which he recognized at once.
Even though he was intent upon his course, there were times Draco could feel licks of doubt or despair intrude upon his cold peace. He found it was easier to retreat from them rather than give into the baser elements of the self. Unrestrained emotion recalled too easily the meetings that had taken place at the manor over the summer; not the inner circle’s seemingly permanent occupation there, but those special gatherings that required every active member’s presence. There had been a feverish atmosphere about them, quiet and raucous by turns as the Dark Lord spoke and then paused to await their response, the sibilant cadence of his voice almost hypnotic in the darkness of the room.
may be mad but he’s hardly a fool. Imagine the destruction if he’d been let loose here—even with Dumbledore present!”
As they neared the entrance, Potter flicked his wand in a neat upward stroke, disarming any warning spells Montague may have cast. Had there been any traps present, it would have instantly alerted him to their presence. Draco positioned himself near the doorknob, while Potter stood on the side opposite, ready to venture inside upon his signal. He nodded at him and proceeded to silently unlock the door, stepping back as Potter darted across the threshold. His wand now poised to strike, Draco soon followed after.
The next spell Draco fired caught the accomplice head-on, blasting them back into the wall hard enough to leave a hole in the plaster. The disillusionment charm dispersed upon her losing consciousness, and it revealed a bedraggled-looking Ravenclaw whom he vaguely recognized as having been in the year below him in school.
“Let’s get out of here, else you’ll have to put your werewolf-isms to good use when the Aurors arrive.” Potter pulled Granger into his arms, feet planted in a stance suited to apparition.
The circle began to glow from within, each sigil lighting up as they activated one by one. Around it a dome composed of red-hued light formed—flickering and diaphanous at first, but then gaining solidity the longer he spoke. In return, the cabinet too shuddered in tandem with his chanting; runes there imbued with the same blood as the circle, and with complementary arrays. The Black Kill Wards were complete.
Two days later, a letter came in the post for him. Draco did not often get letters, aside from the occasional notice of an impending liaison with Pansy, or a verbose and appallingly vain summary of Blaise’s latest world travels. The latter’s most recent report had listed the twenty-seven different types of French wine he’d purportedly tried while vacationing in Cannes. This information had only served to make Draco wonder how he’d made it seven years without attempting to throttle Blaise at least once. But
“How terrible your life has been,” Draco sneered. “I feel so sorry for you right now. It’s not as though everyone adores you, or anything. Shall I begin to list your admirers first, or would you rather I start with your acquaintances?” He seemed to have struck a nerve, as Potter looked one more snide comment away from attacking him.
“I’m searching for a bloke called Harry Potter. Often goes by Harry, sometimes by Potter. Looks like a bastard. Have you recently seen someone matching this description?”
“Stop!” Harry shouted. The tree split down the middle. Another groaned in protest, as though bowing beneath some phantom wind.
“That slag Selwick has been breathing down my neck for the past week about it. Not like I haven’t been bloody trying or anything,” he said, knocking back his last shot. “He’s impossible to track down.”
There was more that he needed to interview Malfoy about: the condition of the wards around Malfoy Manor; the spells used on Yaxley, Rookwood, and Greyback; and a record of any unusual activity that occurred in the days leading up to the attack. But he couldn’t bring himself to subject Malfoy to further scrutiny at the hands of what in his mind was likely an old enemy, and in that moment wanted nothing more than to see his family again. To reassure himself that they were alright, and to have Ginny in his arms. His subordinates would take care of the rest for now, and Harry would go home to his family. Now faced with such unimaginable tragedy, his own troubles seemed to pale in comparison. Everything would be fine. It always was.
dare you!” Severus said, more livid than Draco had ever seen him. “Two hundred points from Gryffindor! Detention with Filch until the summer holidays! Don’t even bother going to your Head of House, Potter. Just go right to the Headmaster’s.” He towered over Potter, who nonetheless seemed to expand with a rage that rivaled Severus’.
“It is one I do not blame you for. I only wish you would’ve come to me for help. Perhaps I could’ve gotten them out in time. Or Narcissa, at least.”
Potter ran a hand through his hair. “There has to be a partner of some kind. Someone we haven’t found yet. Not unless—”
He knew Potter had taken to shagging dark creatures, which for a regular wizard Draco rather likened to sticking your cock in a beehive and hoping the buggers didn’t have a mind to sting you for it. Either way, the daft bastard really was going to catch something if he wasn’t careful. Draco just hoped it wouldn’t be lycanthropy. Danger fucks were hardly worth the risk. One day he’d end up catching something a trip to St. Mungo’s couldn’t clear up, which would really prove to be the tragicomic culmination of their lives.
“I need a door! Please, just give me a door!” Potter yelled, voice thin. “A way out of here!” The room constricted and shrunk around them, and a doorway materialized upon the rapidly approaching wall.
“Then get me two blood-replenishing potions, a vial of moon-balm…” Her voice faded as the darkness wavering on the periphery of his vision encroached further. He was slipping away, and not even Pomfrey could stop it now.
“This is why Patil shouldn’t have been experimenting with them in the first place. Things tend to go wrong immediately when they get involved.”
The first visit passed without incident, but the second went awry almost immediately. He and Dudley were quietly sitting together while the children played at a local park, situated side-by-side on one of the surrounding benches, when Dudley had broached the topic of their childhood.
There was a sharp intake of breath. “Come on, Malfoy. We’re almost to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey, she—she’ll fix you right up. It’ll only be a little while yet.”
The first time he’d gotten well and truly mad at one of the children, James had smashed one of the toy soldiers Harry had rescued from his cupboard before attending Hogwarts for the first time. It had sat unused at the bottom of his school trunk for years, but when James turned five Harry thought it might be nice to impart one of the better relics of his childhood onto his son. It only took a few days for it to wind up broken, though, and intentionally at that. Al had wanted to play with it, too, and when Ginny told James to share, he’d stamped it underfoot in a childish fit.
“It took me a moment to collect myself, after, and I dragged Astoria and Scorpius through the floo with me. As soon as I looked at her, though, I knew she wasn’t going to make it. But I wanted so badly for my wife to be fine that I couldn’t accept that she was dying. My mother went quickly, I think. Or perhaps that’s my own wishful thinking.”
Severus tapped his wand once on the bed, and the ropes disappeared. “Those were for your own safety as much as anyone else. You kept trying to—to hurt yourself.” His face betrayed no emotion, but there was a faint melancholy present in the cadence of his voice. Draco’s face grew hot.
“Or, what? You’ll hex me?” Montague said mockingly. “I doubt any of you will—” He cut himself off at the sight of Draco and Potter, becoming incandescent with rage. “You! Potter, Malfoy!” He shouted, digging the tip of his wand deeper into the temple of his hostage, which appeared to be a first-year girl.
“What I mean is that certain families are predisposed to certain areas of magic, and that they pass on this magic to their children. If the bloodline is old enough, then eventually members of that family develop certain magical alignments as a result: light, dark, or, more rarely, gray. That would be you, in this instance. As for myself, both the Malfoys and the Blacks are dark families, so therefore I am by nature a dark wizard; conversely, the Weasleys have been light long since before they migrated to England.”
“I knew what they wanted, and if either of them had been in their right mind, then they would have done the same. I’m sure of it.”
“The Malfoy women, Auror Potter. Narcissa was pronounced dead at the scene—savaged by Greyback, according to the on-site Mediwizards—and Astoria died while at St. Mungo’s. Mr. Malfoy and his son are in recovery, but their injuries are severe,” Wickham finished. “It might be several hours yet until they can speak. Until then, the floo at the manor has been opened for us to access.”
Well, “bloke” being the operative term, of course. These days the only shags he had were with his fellow dark creatures, who couldn’t catch what it was he carried. He’d off himself before ever passing the curse on to a child of his. Vampires, fae, and certain corporeal spirits were safe options because there was no chance of cross-species reproduction. Now witches and other werewolves, however… No sense in risking it, that was certain. The last thing he needed was to knock up some poor bird with the spawn of a beast.
. You don’t know what it’s like. You don’t know what it does to someone. That—that fear. Waiting for it to happen again.”
The resulting blast of blood and innards left Draco and Potter doused from head to foot in scarlet, as well as a good portion of the crowd behind them. Most of the children started to scream. All Draco could muster the energy to do was wipe the blood from his eyes. At least the idiot was taken care of.
As the end of spring drew closer, his work on the cabinet quickly approached completion. The warding was finished, and now he only needed to finish the blood sacrifice. That would be done the night of the ritual, which could be performed on the night of a full moon, right as the sun descended behind the horizon. The next suitable date was the coming Friday, and so all he had to do was hold out until then. It would all be over soon. He only had to last the remainder of the week.
“You tried. That’s more than I can say for most,” Draco said, absently running a hand over his left forearm. The mark had died twenty years ago with the Dark Lord, but the scar that lived in its absence still ached occasionally, as though in memory of what had been.
She’d contracted a fatal case of Scrofungulus not two years after the war. It began in the slant of her jaw as a small mole, but multiplied into a tumorous mass within the week. By Sunday, it had spread to the inner lining of her throat, where it grew and grew until she suffocated from the inside. Andromeda’s death left Teddy was orphaned thrice over, and Harry and Ginny as the teenaged parents to an emotionally devastated lycanthrope. They made it work, though. It was hard, but they made it work. Harry had never felt so happy as when Teddy called him “Dad” for the first time.
He dreamed of wolves. There was no higher thought, only sensation; and at first he was daunted by it, but then the freedom of being an animal took over. The blood between his teeth satisfied something deep within him, and the grass beneath his paws was impossibly soft. He could not speak, yet felt no need to. Light from the full moon trickled through the canopy of branches overhead, and as he drew further into the wood the undergrowth became harder to pass. But still he pressed on, though; faster, quicker, until he was moving with such force he was almost flying. Beyond the next turn was a small clearing, and at the far end stood a stag with startlingly green eyes, presiding over a pool of water. He approached it with no fatal intent, and instead pressed himself up against the stag, inhaling the smell of mint—
—ancient, powerful avenues of invocation, and known only by the oldest families in Wizarding Britain. His father had likewise been ignorant, but his mother was steeped in the old ways. Because she was not a Malfoy but a Black, and their family magics had always been predicated on blood and sacrifice. If one word were to describe the system it abided by then it would be
“Thanks, Gin,” he said softly, then began to weave through the throng of children punctuated by the occasional adult until he was outside. As she’d claimed, there was a rather rowdy pick-up game going on.
“Oh, my son,” she breathed, eyes flashing with recognition. “You have done well. We will see each other again very soon, won’t we?”
Potter dragged Draco out into the corridor, which he recognized only distantly, as the world faded ever more quickly at the edges. Only the color of Potter’s eyes remained clear now, and they looked almost impossibly green. He smelled of mint, and of the outdoors; a contrast to the lingering odor of spoiled meat leftover from Greyback.
“I swore an Unbreakable Vow to your mother that I would protect you from harm. Should you die, then I would as well.”
“Not bloody likely, you loony fucking cunt!” He yelled, throwing himself bodily in front of Potter in order to take on the brunt of Montague’s attack.
“This is completely and totally illegal! I can’t believe you’re breaking the rules, not to mention being so vulgar! You’re—despicable! I’ll never tell you where my parents live! I—” Her shrill tirade was cut off when Potter hastily replaced the charm.
Potter’s face darkened. “Then educate me,” he bit out, hands clenching like he was restraining himself from physically accosting Draco. “Since you’re such an expert.”
“What? Tortured them into insanity? As though my family hasn’t gone through the same bloody thing? You want to know what it feels like to be
“What are you going to do, Potter—kill me? I think last night proved you incapable of that,” he hissed, baiting him further.
ropes pulled taut around his arms. He was really giving it a good effort. Granger appeared to still be in the process of trying to set Potter on fire with her mind. It wasn’t working—yet. With that one, it was usually just a matter of time.
But the deep ache of the change in his bones was proof enough, not to mention the tattered fragments of his carefully-constructed mental landscape. Even now, he could feel the wolf prowling around within the ruins of his mind, like it was an animate thing in its own right. He cringed away from it as much as he was able, repulsed by the primal atmosphere that marked the beast’s presence. Still it would not leave him. The wound around his eye ached.
“Dumbledore’s going to die?” Potter said, looking faint. Then he turned towards Severus, who looked inscrutable. “Snape, you
Now satisfied that the investigation was well in hand, Harry flooed to St. Mungo’s. He was led back into the “Dangerous” Dai Llewellyn Ward for Serious Bites by a severe-looking female Healer with bloodied robes. Her nametag read “Healer Lindstrom” in faded black lettering. Harry had been to St. Mungo’s many times since visiting Arthur in Fifth Year—not only with regard to himself for injuries incurred while in the line of duty, but also for witnesses to or victims of attacks. He never liked coming here. Bodies were easier than living tragedies. Perhaps that was the cynic in him, yet nonetheless it was how he felt. But the worst was when Andromeda had died.
Her eyes glittered in the dim light of the pub, hair spilling long and dark across her shoulders, which were colored a deep shade of lilac. She was clearly the offspring of some breed of fae and a wizard. His eyes strayed to her breasts, which spilled out of the low-cut top she was wearing. Potter’s gaze was likewise occupied.
A distant expression crossed Potter’s face. “Later, perhaps. When the war is over and I have time.” Sweet Circe, why was Potter telling him this?
“Obviously. But I knew he was going to die anyways. Why bother offing him when it was going to happen regardless?”
“It was wrong what they did to you, Harry,” he’d said suddenly, fiercely. “More than that, even. It was abuse. I know—I looked it up.”
Draco just laughed at him. He laughed and laughed. He laughed until he began to sob, and was racked by shudders from the force of it. Throughout it all, Potter did not release his grip on him, nor did he quit staring down at him with a look of furious, nearly agonized incomprehension.
His days were spent hunting down various and sundry dark creatures, magical artifacts, and outlaw wizards; all the while attempting to evade discovery by Aurors or being killed on the job. Draco didn’t think he’d survive another stint in Azkaban. Without occlumency, he doubted he’d have made it through any length of incarceration at all. Granger once called him a recidivist criminal, and although there’d been a hint of a smile on her lips as she’d said it, her eyes had been sad. It had been worse in the beginning, when he’d been adjusting to the bite and the legal restrictions of his new position. He could recall his second incarceration easily.
At any rate, Draco had no real pride to speak of, did he? He was one step above living in the streets, and the only flat he could afford was one situated overtop a manky club in Horizont Alley—Wizarding London’s red-light district. Some of the cheapest inner-city accommodations were found in Horizont, and while more than fulfilled his need for easy access to both the Ministry and the labyrinthine sprawl of magical alleyways, he found certain… downsides to living there. Like the smell, for one, and the racket of the Weird Sisters cover band the club beneath him employed nightly. But few landlords would rent to half-breeds, so he made do.
“Yes, Potter. I’d like it if you’d kindly piss off so I can finally kill myself in peace!” Draco yelled after him. Potter started towards his bed again, paying no mind to Severus’ wand, which was still raised threateningly.
Draco paused. “I was raised to abide by the old ways of our kind, Potter. This requires me to not only know my own heritage, but that of others’ as well. I’m sure the family spell-books are locked away in one of your vaults somewhere. All you have to do is go to Gringotts.”
How could the prophecy have chosen you, of all people, to save us? You don’t even know your own history!”
hadn’t. I was doing what should have been done all along. This… was a way to free us, and to revenge our deaths in the process.”
Potter grinned. “I might need to end our chat early, mate,” he said, loosening the collar of his robes. Draco rolled his eyes.
“Traitor! Filth! You will pay for this, Malfoy! I’ll kill you! It won’t be quick. I’ll savor you and eat you slowly—one limb at a time. You’ll beg me to end it, but I won’t. If you think this false darkness will save you, then you are mistaken. You cannot fool the senses of a wolf—” Greyback cut himself off, nostrils flaring. He turned to where Potter must have been hiding under the invisibility cloak. “Harry Potter… how stupid of you to come here. I’ll deliver you to the Dark Lord, but not before I’ve had my pound of flesh.”
There were the runic arrays taught at Hogwarts, diluted by blood-traitors to pander to mudbloods and to appease the ministry, and then there were
Tied down like an animal. Perhaps that was because it was true. His face flushed in humiliation at the thought, and a film of salt pricked at his eyes. He had never felt so alone. Here he was, in a purgatory of his own making. Draco had no one to blame save for himself.
Harry felt guilt cut through him at that. Often, he was unsure of why their fights began and what they were over. But that only made it worse, as feeling like he was circling around the real point served only to frustrate him. He supposed there were many things that he was oblivious to. Unlike today, however, there were occasions when
“I’d be surprised if you actually went through with it, Malfoy, because I think you’re too much of a coward to actually do anything of the sort. So, I’m sure you’ll still be here after today, and that you’ll actually have to live with what you’ve done.”
Draco shot off a disarming spell and then summoned the closest person towards him—which, as it turned out, was a rather irate-looking Percy Weasley. Although a gifted wizard in his own right, Weasley was still fifteen and untested, whereas Draco was a hard bastard who had scraped through countless battle through his ruthlessness alone. The boy hardly stood a chance, and was bound up in spells in less than the time it took to sneeze.
Draco bared his teeth at him. “Oh, I’m sure she would. The Mudblood does have a thing for dark creatures, doesn’t she? I’m more appealing than ever, now.”
“Did I ask to be privy to your personal issues, or are they simply being forced upon me since I’m physically incapable of running away?”
Lindstrom turned to him. “They’ve both been stabilized, Auror Potter, but the boy is currently sedated. If you must speak with him, I can induce consciousness. However, I assume Mr. Malfoy can answer any questions you will have at this juncture,” she said. Lindstrom seemed loathe to wake Scorpius.
Harry’s children, used to his frequent outbursts of accidental magic, were mostly unaffected by the scene. Marjorie and Rose, however, screamed and ran over to Dudley, who was looking at Harry with the same expression his family had all those years ago. That same shock and horror, laced with Ginny’s lethal pity. They had left after that, and hadn’t returned since, despite Teddy’s protests that he missed Uncle Dudley. He just couldn’t handle it. There was some wild about Harry buried within his past, and prodding it didn’t seem to do anyone any good—least of all himself.
There were little employment opportunities for ex-convicts in Wizarding London, but Draco would have went and offed himself before ever seeking out muggle work. He wound up just faffing about the city for two years after his initial release from Azkaban, scraping by through odd jobs here and there, and would have continued in the same manner had he not stumbled across a recruitment advert in the
Potter waited to approach him until a week after his mother’s death. Draco had spent most of his paycheck on the funeral, which was not much; it had been a somber, solitary affair besides, and nothing like what Narcissa deserved. He would have asked Potter to inter her body in the Black Mausoleum, but he knew her well enough not damage her pride by doing so. She had never been one to beg for anything. Instead he settled for a pauper’s funeral: an unmarked grave in a dodgy little plot of land behind a cottage that had seen better days. At least it was in Wiltshire. There was no epitaph or gravestone, but he’d planted a bed of lilies in the freshly-tilled earth, so that her death would in time produce something beautiful. The only other attendees were Potter, Aunt Andromeda, and a young man with unruly turquoise hair. Nothing was said between them. Draco didn’t cry.
There had been resentment about the Malfoys’ defection and subsequent testimonies at the Death Eater Trials not only among the pureblood elite, but also within those who had either been captured or were forced to go on the run following Voldemort’s defeat. The Malfoys had since fielded a great number of retaliatory attacks for close to two decades now, and it seemed that one finally proved successful. Worse yet, tonight was a full moon.
Having quickly regained his bearings, Montague spat out an unknown curse in retaliation, which manifested itself as a jet of sickly yellow light. Potter dropped to his knees and let the spell sail over him, while Draco dove off to the side. He crashed into one of the many low tables lining the walls, which buckled instantly under his weight. Thrown to the floor, he staggered unsteadily to his feet, steadying himself against the wall. Potter had closed the distance between himself and Montague, slowly backing the other man into a corner. There was a look of wild wrath upon his face, and Draco was suddenly reminded of why Potter was the most feared man in the Wizarding World. No longer was he an eccentric former schoolmate, and neither was he the brazen youth of his childhood memories. This was the man who had killed the Dark Lord.
It was worse than expected. He was again briefed by his highest-ranked subordinate, Rastrick, and was led outside to where the highest concentration of corpses lay. Rookwood and Yaxley bore the distinctive marks of the Malfoy offensive magic they’d become accustomed to seeing after years of repeat incidents. Narcissa was still under house-arrest for her part in the war, yes, but Harry had agreed to change the terms of her sentence and move her somewhere none of their former associates knew about. Somewhere safe. But she refused to leave the manor. It was that same Malfoy pride that had gotten them involved with Voldemort to begin with, he thought.
“It won’t lie and say it was easy, but I’ve never once regretted taking him in. I love being a father—more than anything else,” Harry said. His children were his life.
“I don’t find this funny at all,” Potter said, voice raw with honesty. He ran a hand through his hair, mussing it further. The smell of mint still clung to him, beneath the gore and sick. Damnable half-breed senses. It almost recalled something of the dream, but what it was he couldn’t say.
My Scorpius. Now he’ll have to register with the Ministry. Marked not only as the son of a Death Eater, but also as a werewolf before he’s even had the chance to find himself!” Malfoy snarled, already severe features pulled taut by the expression. He looked almost… feral.
echoed down the hallway, stopping both short. The sound came from the room at the end of the hall—a space barred only by an aged and molding door, which shuddered and grew still by turns. There was a strange, mechanical whirring that punctuated each bang, but that was not all he heard: a series of loud, increasingly frenetic mutters were interspersed throughout the racket, each word spoken with disquieting fervor.
The outcome of their ambush appeared certain—at least, until Draco saw something move out of the corner of his eye. On the far side of the room, he could see the distinctive distortion of the disillusionment charm. He recalled what Potter’s earlier remark about a second conspirator, and quietly cursed himself for having forgotten it in the chaos. Draco shot off a hex in their direction, which they not only dodged but also had the unfortunate side-effect of distracting Potter long enough for Montague to dart out of the corner and across the room.
Harry scraped a hand along his jaw. “Fine. After I take a look at the scene, I’ll see about interviewing the Malfoys if either is capable of speaking by then,” he said, then flooed the Manor.
“It doesn’t matter if it was a poltergeist or not, Malfoy. What makes it funny is the fact that it was an accident. Besides, I wouldn’t have brought it up, if you hadn’t—”
Malfoy wavered briefly, the pale column of his throat working around an unsteady breath. “Greyback was crouched over Astoria. There was blood everywhere. Scorpius wasn’t moving. My first instinct wasn’t to run for the silver, but to make him suffer; my mother felt similarly. But she was still weak from Rookwood’s curse, so when she hexed him he just shook it off and picked her up in his jaws like—like she was a doll. I shot off every curse I could think of at him. Nothing worked, and he didn’t let her go until she was dead. Then he turned on me.”
“You could have let them in. For a while now, surely. If you were capable of something like this, then you must have fixed the cabinet ages ago. Or, at least devised a more effective method of killing Headmaster Dumbledore. I mean, that was you, right?”
If he’d been in his right mind, he would have recognized the voice as being that of a young Pansy Parkinson. Instead all Draco realized that he was currently on the Hogwarts Express, and that he was a bit shorter than usual.
“Blood,” Greyback said, sounding delighted. “I smell blood. I smell death and dark magic. I want student blood, and student flesh. It is the full moon, and I am so very hungry. Let me take some, and I will kill whomever you want.” He emerged from the cabinet, glee waning quickly as he detected who, exactly, the source of the stench was.
He left the two of them there, slightly confused and still awaiting further instructions, and began to make his way along the Hogwarts Express. His nose twitched intermittently as he searched out Potter’s familiar scent, pushing through large swathes of rowdy children until he reached the right compartment.
“But why would you defect, then? Voldemort is a dark wizard, isn’t he? You lot call him the ‘Dark Lord,’ even.”
It was then that Draco finally recalled the events that had precipitated his departure and subsequent reappearance on the Hogwarts Express. He also recalled that before disappearing he’d latched onto Montague, which could mean all manner of trouble. This could very well not be Potter, if they had indeed gotten mixed-up during the trip. He drew his wand and pointed it at the other boy.
“Fuck off! Just fuck off! Half-blood filth!” He yelled, twisting away from Potter and felt his bones contort unpleasantly in response. There was the sound of something splintering, and then popping as thing began to be forced out of place. Distantly, he heard someone retch. It sounded like Potter.
“It’s working… it’s finally working,” Montague hissed in triumph. “This is going to change everything.” His final proclamation was undeniably ominous in nature.
“I would have said yes, you know,” Potter said, settling atop the stool next to him. He ordered a pint of pale ale.
He had only just touched the ground when Ginny yelled his name from within the house. “Harry, they need you at the Ministry—now! Malfoy Manor’s been attacked!”
Then he was given an impossible task. Perhaps he should have been surprised, but the Dark Lord did not take failure lightly. He was expected to fail. It would simply be the latest in a series of humiliations. Narcissa had a permanent tremor in her wand hand now. His father looked half-starved and hunted. As for him… well, it didn’t matter. If he stayed, he would only prolong the inevitable. But even knowing that, he couldn’t bring himself to leave; and even if he did, they would kill him anyways. There was no alternative recourse for him or his family. That had been lost the moment his father took the mark.
At this realization, Potter went very pale. But then after a long, tense moment, he cracked a grin and both boys burst out laughing. Well, hysterics, more like. The stress of the past day, as well as the lingering side-effects of time-travel had begun to wear on Draco, and he felt drained. But then again, he always did. Part and parcel of being a werewolf, after all.
Before it ever reached him, however, the time-turner expanded in haze of golden light that consumed them all. Draco felt nothing—no pain, not even the pressure of impact—only a faint wind brushing lightly past his face…
Draco paused. “If we’ve travelled back in time to our younger bodies, then why am I still a werewolf? You’d think experimental magic would be good for something, at least.”
Now certain that he was watching her, Ginny placed her free hand upon his shoulder. It felt nice. Warm. His wife always made sure to broadcast her movements before she touched him. He had never responded well to being surprised, especially by touch. Harry loved her. He loved her so much.
“Oh, really?” Potter said. He looked rather a mess, hair standing on end and features nearly obscured by red. “I had no idea.”
“Alright, you idiot. I’m finished with this nonsense,” Draco hissed at him, then transfigured the floor around them into a makeshift barrier. Farley shrieked in rage on the other side, and the carpet-mound shuddered beneath an intense hail of spellfire.
Although Draco hated the thought of accepting what was, essentially, charity, his cupboards were worryingly spare and the last thing he needed was to be shunted off to Azkaban again for defaulting on his payments to the Ministry. There was something truly awful about the magical legal system, he thought, because it seemed to him there was no in-between doing hard time or being fully exonerated. They could impose fines or mandate community service hours, rather than sending a squad of Aurors after him each time this occurred. Even the bloody muggles did that.
Draco could feel the wolf rearing its head within him, and the loss of his shields left him uncomfortably close to the unruly tangle of his thoughts. Severus clearly wanted to interject, but seemingly refrained for his sake.
Bellatrix, Yaxley, and Dolohov were the most fervent in their worship during these meetings, euphoric in either torturing or being tortured by the Dark Lord, who was often content to simply preside over the chaos. After their… performance reviews were completed, the night would then climax in the mutilation and subsequent execution of a muggle, blood-traitor, or mudblood. Sometimes there would be more than one, and sometimes Greyback would eat the corpses raw after. The house-elves had become used to mopping blood off the floor.
“Oh, really?” He said with great feeling, jerking his chin at his restraints. “I must have misinterpreted
As the train sped off, a dark head peeked out of the destroyed compartment. It was Farley again, damn her. “Percy!” Farley cried in the distance, “I will not rest until I save you!”
“At least I get some, Malfoy. It’s been months for you, hasn’t it? Even longer, perhaps? Well, guess what, you bastard—I had sex with ten different people last week, none of them poltergeists! At the very least, they were all alive.”
“You must have been—what, nineteen? Twenty? That must have been very difficult for you and your wife.” Malfoy’s voice caught on the word
Pomfrey glanced out the window. “By Merlin, it’s the full moon. Everybody out! Evacuate the infirmary! Anyone who can walk, leave now! Mr. Potter, help the others. I have to stabilize him before he changes.” She flicked her wand at Draco and levitated him onto the nearest gurney.
“Greyback was about to tear out my throat when I remembered the set of silver we keep in the parlor for guests. I summoned several knives and transfigured them into spikes. That’s what finally killed him. Silver—of course! How I didn’t realize sooner is unforgivable. My idiocy cost my family their lives,” he continued, growing more visibly distressed.
“Likewise, you mad cunt,” Draco sneered. “Say you do off her, then I’d just kill you regardless. No trial, no dementors. I daresay I’d even enjoy it.”
“I wanted to take your statement myself. There have been nearly two decades of premeditated attacks on you and your family at this point, and I am one of the few who’ve been with the department for that long.”
“As long as you and that sket don’t get me banned. I’m already running out of pubs as it is,” he said, tipping the shot back easily.
There was an awkward cough. “Er, Malfoy?” The voice came from behind the curtains, and a brown hand peeked through to part them. Potter looked a right mess, hair standing on end and covered with what Draco assumed was his own blood. Hot shame cut through him at that.
“Aside from the Dark Lord being far too clever to imperil himself by attacking Hogwarts so directly, you mean? I didn’t even try to lure him in, considering I’m certain he’s tied his essence to something physical. Something I couldn’t destroy with the wards. Some sort of object, like a—”
“Why tonight? Is there some significance to the date?” Harry asked. He’d withdrawn a pad of paper and a modified variant of a Quick-Quotes Quill, which was recording their conversation.
“How could he lie to me? For months? What am I going to do after he’s gone? I can’t defeat Voldemort without him.” Potter appeared so genuinely distressed that Draco almost felt sorry for him. But he only had the emotional capacity to pity one person at a time, and currently, that person was himself. Besides, it was
“Oh no,” came a soft voice from behind him. Potter. That—utter and completely empty-headed idiot! Draco didn’t know when he’d slipped in, or how, but what he did know was that he could not allow Greyback to eat the bloody Chosen One.
The first time she pointed her wand at his mother, Draco had been unable to keep from interfering; he’d thrown himself bodily between the two and caught the
“Would I’d have bothered coming if I wasn’t?” Draco said sarcastically. “Let’s just get this over with.” The irony of Montague potentially hiding out in a clockmaker’s was not lost on him.
“How dare you—” Her shriek was cut off when he made his way into the corridor and slammed the door behind him.
for Hit-Wizards. What caught his eye in particular was the byline “clean record not required!” It was only sensible, really, considering their employee base was predicated almost entirely on criminal types. Unlike Aurors, who were offered certain protections for actions taken in the line of duty, Hit-Wizards and Witches were left to fend for themselves if caught “bending” the law while on a case. Draco had been in and out of Azkaban no less than nine times on account of this. Still better than frying up chips for muggles.
sarcastic suggestion, Potter. How about you ask the person living there for the address? Or a location close by you're familiar enough with in order to apparate there without splinching yourself.”
“Cogg’s been dead for days. Montague might not even be here anymore,” Draco said. “But if he was stupid enough to hang around, then we’ll bloody well skewer him.”
Draco laughed. It became clear to him that he couldn’t go with the Order. He needed to leave. But it would never be safe for him out there, not with the Dark Lord searching for him; if he was ever going to live, rather than simply survive, then he would have to kill he who was supposedly un-killable. Knowing what Horcruxes the Dark Lord possessed and how many he’d been mad enough to make seemed the place to start. Potter was the only one privy to that information who would be willing to share or malleable enough to give it up. And he could be convinced, surely. Draco’s experience with dark magic would make him a valuable resource, and more than that—he knew about Potter’s family, which was so clearly a weakness of his. This plan was going to be dangerous and likely ill-fated, yet Draco saw no other recourse for himself. It had to be done.
“Not now, Crabbe,” he told him absently, not registering what, exactly, he had just said. “I’ve got to find someone.”
“Potter!” Severus snapped, choosing then to step in. He had been spectating long-sufferingly for the duration of their argument, caught somewhere between exasperation and faint amusement. Now, though, he was simply furious.
“My parents had become little more than servants to a mad half-blood with delusions of nobility. The Malfoy and Black lines disgraced; their lords and heir made to bow before the bastard offspring of the Gaunt line. They raised me better than that—to value the honor of our families over all else. Even if they forgot it,
on it yet, just some blood wards that I can make quick work of. It’s all rather dependent on whether I’m recognized as Lord Black or not in this body, since I already know where the house is.”
Now Potter’s arrangement was certainly unorthodox, not to mention legally dubious, but Draco supposed he had offered due to some amalgamation of guilt, pity, and that insatiable longing for excitement he hid from no one. What a reckless fucking bastard. Not that this excursion of theirs likely to turn up any real information, as Montague had been underground for weeks now. Carkitt Market was one of Draco’s speculated hideouts for him, but this seemed rather… convenient. But the Head Auror was asking, and so he’d comply rather than risk the only stable employment he’d managed to find.
“So, what are we going to do with them?” Potter asked. He looked put-out by Granger’s obvious hatred.
“Not at first. The wards initially registered the disturbance as a small intrusion, and nothing had happened in so long that I suspected it may have just been an animal. But when Luxie—our house elf—failed to return, I became more suspicious. That’s why I made Astoria and Scorpius stay inside.”
Later that week, Draco was three fingers deep into a bottle of firewhiskey when a familiar voice interrupted what little relief he’d found after a long day of field work. He sighed at the intrusion, but wasn’t surprised in the least. Potter knew he favored drinking at the White Wyvern—a skanky pub situated deep within Knockturn Alley—and had taken to bothering him there when he needed something. Unfortunately, it was more often than not for a chat. Potter seemed to actually
Malfoy stared at him. “…Very well. Your offer is appreciated, Auror Potter. I’ll take it into consideration.”
Harry swallowed. “My eldest son, Teddy, is a werewolf. A born one, that is. We weren’t sure if he was going to change at first, but as he grew older he displayed certain… well, traits we’d been told to look out for. He fully transformed right at the onset of puberty, the summer before he attended Hogwarts.”
“Harry, dear,” Ginny said, coming up to him. There was a basket in her hands, and paint was smeared across one cheek. “Go out into the garden. Al is playing Quidditch with the boys. I’ll take care of this lot in here.” Although her face was fixed in a conciliatory expression, there was something off about the cadence of her voice. Like some deep heaviness she could not shake.
He sighed. “You asked me why I defected. I already told you, but I suppose you want an easier answer. I’m afraid no such one exists. There’s too many valuable bloodlines here, besides; and they’d have killed whomever they pleased if I had allowed even one of them in.”
After a moment, there was the sound of uncertain footsteps. He felt someone touch him, almost gently, and then the abrupt loss of Greyback’s weight. His breath rattled wetly in his chest. Draco was ready to die.
“Let her go, Montague—else it won’t just be Azkaban for you. I’ll make sure you’re kissed myself,” Potter said, stepping closer to him. It was not a threat but a promise.
“Take all the time you need, Potter. It’s not as though the Aurors will be after us for kidnapping soon or anything.”
Early that evening, Draco slipped away to the Room of Requirement. The vanishing cabinet, more angular and imposing than ever, had been finished. Next came the rest of the sacrifice: a runic circle composed of blood drawn around the cabinet, which resided in the center. He pressed the tip of his athame to the inner juncture of his left arm and slashed a neat line to his wrist that bisected the Dark Mark. Licks of red welled up at once, and he began to draw with feverish abandon. The process took some time. Throughout it all he tipped back the occasional blood-replenishing potion, but did not pause for either pain or discomfort. The sigils were almost alive in their own right, and were finicky about the ritual, and therefore required an attentiveness that simpler variants did not.
Throughout the argument, they had steadily moved closer to each other until they were very nearly nose-to-nose. Potter’s eyes looked very green, and he seemed quite devastatingly young despite being covered head-to-toe in blood.
“Just what, exactly?” His godfather hissed, billowing in from behind Pomfrey. He looked drawn, and as though he hadn’t slept in days. “Accosting the victim of a brutal attack? I admire your callousness, Potter. I truly do. Now go, before I make you.”
Greyback lunged towards Potter, features contorting until they were half-transformed. The moon had not yet risen, but he had given as much of himself over to the wolf as he was able. Draco was moving before he’d even realized what he had done, and leapt in-between the two with no other thoughts than intercepting Greyback. He felt, rather than saw Greyback’s maw clamp over his face, teeth sinking into the soft flesh underneath his cheekbone and above the crest of his left brow. Draco screamed, more a sound of fury than of pain. He raised the athame and jabbed it into the back Greyback’s skull, right above the nape of his neck, the skin around there sizzling and sloughing off. Throughout it all Greyback did not release his bite, nor did he stop scoring deep lines into Draco’s chest and back, leaving his robes slick with blood.
!” He shrieked, tossing Potter across the room, where he landed in a heap. “The Headmaster’s office, now! You can explain your appalling behavior to him. I will be by later to make sure you’ve gone, seeing as so far you’ve proven incapable of following even the slightest instruction!”
Now finished, Draco sat back on his heels and inspected his work. It appeared outwardly flawless, if visually crude, and all that was left was the incantation. He turned the blade on himself and carved the activation rune into the palms of both hands. Already he could feel the magic catch flame and burn darkly within his mind, and Draco let out a shaky breath at that. He gazed up at the cabinet.
“Let’s take them with us for now, and decide on the drop-off point when I’m not covered in Montague’s insides.”
“That’s fine, Healer Lindstrom. I can have one of the child specialists from the department come by tomorrow. I’m actually rather surprised Mr. Malfoy is lucid. I was prepared to wait for some time yet.”
