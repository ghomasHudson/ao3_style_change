Once they arrived outside ‘Thistle Do Nicely’, Potter’s eyebrows shot up, a disgusted look on his face. “You really weren’t kidding were you?” he said, shaking his head. It really was a sight to behold. “I haven’t seen this before, how long has it been here?” Potter squinted at the sign, his eyes wandering to the many different hanging baskets. There was something frighteningly unnerving about this array of succulents.
“Care to explain this?” Draco said, gesturing towards the two of them. That annoying sheepish look sat on Weasley’s face once again, as though he didn’t have two brain cells to rub together and the cogs were grinding around in his brain trying to come up with a passable sentence.
Draco shook his head “I only know what Granger told me, he’s doing a Quidditch match in Edinburgh and she bought me tickets” he laughed. Louisa raised an eyebrow, there really wasn’t anything unattractive about the blonde, if Draco hadn’t preferred men he’d have snapped her up in a second. “You didn’t tell me
At twenty five years of age, you're not supposed to feel old. Nevertheless, Draco did. Unsure of what to do with his life these days, Draco had adopted the rather annoying hobby of 'people watching'. He watches as they animatedly talk to each other, the rapid waving of one's arms sets his teeth on edge, the bright faces of the bustling traffic coming through Diagon Alley in early August. With Hogwarts resuming, he knew there would be a lot more people here than there usually was, but he didn't expect the extent of the crowd.
Draco nodded his head, he’d heard Luna enjoyed playing Muggle video games, and obviously Draco had some limited knowledge of their existence, having bought himself an iPod. “What is it about?” he asked, though the burning question on his lips was, ‘You’re not a playboy?’
Harry always felt like he was being interrogated every time he came here, he was always on what he labelled as ‘the wrong side of the table’ “There’s an organization we’ve been tracking and investigating, we don’t know their official name so we’ve dubbed them the Celtic Serpent,” he started, picking up the photograph he slid it along the table for the two of them to look at. Hermione’s eyes scanned the photograph, then raised to meet his. Although she’d been his friend since he was eleven, she really didn’t give anything away in her facial expression, neither Unspeakable Wilson, who he still didn’t know the first name of.
Don’t be so worried Harry, I know exactly what is in Wolfsbane. Daphne has agreed if I find myself pregnant she would handle the more dangerous ingredients as I did when she and Theo had Odette. Although she’s a pain in all of our arses as well as being a greedy bitch I don’t half love her.
“I have them, Potter, they’re right here.”
“Harry?!” came the shout of a familiar voice, Draco’s eyes shooting open as he finally recognised the voice. “Ron?!” Harry shouted in reply. Relief flooded over Draco’s features, he slumped in his sitting position and let out a relieved sigh. “Thank Merlin, I thought we were done for,” he whispered to Harry, who nodded in agreement. As he was about to reply, the door to the supply room they were shut in flew open, Draco immediately closed his eyes, unable to take the blinding light shining through the doorway.
Upon apparition, Draco, Seamus and Dean were immediately embroiled in an intense wand fight. Seamus clocked a wizard who seemed to be hanging in the back, casting a complicated series of wand movements, he couldn’t hear what the person was mumbling. Feeling a shift under his feet, Dean’s eyes darted to Draco who had just been hit by a Stupefy. “Fuck!” cursed Dean, running over to the blonde. “Draco!” he shouted, kneeling down beside him he cast a Protego around them and checked Draco’s pulse, he’d hit his head pretty hard on a rock jutting out of the bladed grass. Seamus cast a Protego around himself, he looked down to his wristwatch and pressed a button on the front. They’d been issued them two months before, some new invention they’d come up with for Aurors. It had been pretty irritating really, Seamus didn’t like watches or bracelets, he’d argued the toss when they’d been given them but now in the heat of battle he couldn’t help but feel a little grateful, perhaps a little ashamed of the amount of moaning he did about the particular bit of kit. Looking up quickly, his quickly made a note of the headcount, there was one perp in front of him, full black hooded robe. To the person’s left there was another perp in full black, hooded cape. The man to the left looked a little different to the person straight ahead. Seamus made a mental note that this particular wizard was male, which he could tell by the build but he had gold piping around the edge of his robe.
It's time for Harry to come home.
It was odd, the majority of people seemed to just avoid him like he had the black death. “Do you want to go to Honeydukes, Draco?” Hermione asked, offering him a small smile.
Draco walked off to the right, immediately walking through the high tree trunks, branches, leaves and twigs crunching under his boots. He quickly cast a silencing charm on his feet and stealthily jogged through the forest, his eyes scanning for any signs of movement.
I apologise it's taken so long to update this, here's the newest chapter. I'm hoping to get the next one out soon so we can finish this fic. Thank you so much for baring with me!
Stood in front of him was Kingsley, Hermione, Lavender, Dean, Seamus and Wilson. Hermione moved forwards and sat down next to him, laying a hand on his knee. “We got Endelton, he’s bruised and battered but alive, everyone is fine,” she started, a small pained smile appeared on her lips. “Harry, Draco woke up.” she whispered.
“Here we are,'' he smiled, parking his car beside a rather luxurious black Bentley. Louisa’s eyebrows shot up immediately as she saw the man exit the car. “Holy fucking hell, who is
love.
Bethany seemed to take quite a liking to a children’s television program called Pokemon, in the spirit of friendship he’d agreed to let the girls name his pure white kitten, he ended up with the ridiculous name but it had grown on him after a while.
When Draco first met Bethany, she looked at him critically and told him if he hurt her sister she’d break his neck. The smirk that formed on Louisa’s lips could rival his own, she carefully told her sister that he was in fact gay, and if he wasn’t she wouldn’t be interested anyway. Draco protested highly at this.
Draco smirked. “Mysterious?” Harry chuckled and nodded. “Yeah, I doubt it though.” he sighed. Draco simply shrugged his shoulders and exited the office, making his way to the Department of International Magical Cooperation. He hated going to that particular department, the filing witch Hestia was an absolute heathen, in his opinion. The woman loved nothing more than making his life a misery. He’d stand there as she shuffled papers about, messed about with her quill, straightened her robes, ignored him, grunted. He could feel the waves of irritation wash over him as he walked through the corridors of the Ministry.
“What did you mean when you said people think you’re some sort of Playboy Don Lothario?” Draco abruptly asked. He could feel his heartbeat thrumming in his chest, his palms sweaty against the computer mouse.
“Has anyone been out about this crop circle yet?” asked Draco, frowning. Seamus nodded his head and stood up. “Nah not yet, we were going to have a look but we wanted to wait for you two first.” Draco nodded in response. Chewing his lower lip, he turned his head towards the office door and sighed. “Well whatever they’re doing is private and important so how about us three go and check it out?”
"Mum!" another child screamed, bouncing up and down at a shop window. "Look, look!" The small boy looked no older than twelve, bright eyes and an expressive face. 'Wait til you get to my age,' Draco thought, a slight smirk gracing his lips. 'You'll have absolutely nothing to be excited about, you heathen.' "Oh that's lovely dear, do you want one?" The child, who now looked like he was fit to burst, nodded enthusiastically and ran through the doors of the shop. Draco raised an eyebrow. Nothing interesting.
The next day, Draco decided to wait by the edge of the alleyway for Potter to turn up, checking his watch. 1:50, no Potter. 1:55, no Potter. "Hmm." he mumbled to himself. He checked his watch again at 1:56, where was Potter?
Draco wanted to know every last detail of this sordid affair, even if it wasn’t strictly his business. After all, he had Bethany to contend with. How the bloody hell would he tell her Louisa shacked up with war hero Ron Weasley for the night? Bethany was even more of a gossip than Draco was, and that really was saying something.
Draco let out an exasperated sigh and nodded his head. He knew it was absolutely pointless trying to get through to Louisa when she was idealising someone, he was absolutely sure she had some sort of personality disorder but he’d never actually admit that to the woman, she’d be sure to bat him across the back of the head for the insinuation.
Draco could hear Harry’s heart speed up, the other man looked down at Draco, a blush staining his tanned cheeks. “Ah, er, yeah,” Harry said lamely, narrowing his eyes. “I was worried.” Harry cleared his throat, wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist.
“Just so you know, it would be Malfoy-Potter.” he stated, before disapparating. A surprised look flitted across Harry’s features, before settling on a wicked smirk. “Malfoy-Potter huh?” he said to thin air, as he apparated to the Ministry. Once he’d gotten back to his department, he frowned. It was far too quiet, usually the ruckus was in full swing by this time, he looked around and spotted Endelton sitting at his desk quietly, Harry wandered over to him and perched himself on the edge of his desk. “Where is everyone?” His eyes travelled down to the parchment Endelton was filling out and bit his lip.
The next day, Draco apparated to just outside the Leaky Cauldron and looked down at his watch. It was 1:30. Knowing Potter, he’d probably be late.
“It’s a nice one, I’ll admit.” he nodded in agreement. His thoughts, however were drifting back to Harry’s irregular behaviour. He looked like a smacked crup when he announced he had a date, it was a joke, of course, could Harry like him too?
“I feel like an idiot, but I just clammed up and I went down.” Harry sighed. Draco looked thoughtful, before nodding his head. It was true, both of them worked far too hard. Long hours very rarely with a day off. “Probably for the best,” Draco said, leaning back into his pillows. “I was thinking about resigning.” Draco said honestly, he’d been thinking about it for a while but he wasn’t sure how Harry would feel about it.
Once they’d finished dinner, Draco turned his head towards the fridge. “Do you want dessert?” he asked, looking at Harry who was sat slouched back in his chair. “Mm, yeah.” he nodded. Draco snorted and shook his head, he stood up and took their plates over to the kitchen counter. Quickly muttering a spell so the pots, pans and dishes would wash themselves. He wandered over to the fridge and pulled out a blackforest gateau, which he’d purchased in Tesco earlier. He had thought about making his own dessert, but he wasn’t sure he’d have the time.
"Waiting for me?" came a voice beside him, which startled Draco so much he'd dropped his notebook. "Fuck sake, Potter," Bending down, he retrieved the notebook and scowled at the man. "Are you trying to give me a fucking heart attack?"
“Think we’ve found Endelton, does Hermione need you for anything else?” Harry looked around, not seeing Hermione anywhere, he needed to ask how the interview went but he’d do that when they got back, there was no time for it just now.
They sat in relative silence, the only sound that could be heard was Harry’s heavy breathing and the sound of birds outside their windows. Knocked out of his musings, Draco’s eyes wandered to the door and the faint sound of knocking from the other side.
He picked the folder up off the pile and opened the front page, furrowing his brow. For the last few months a symbol seemed to appear more and more often. It was a celtic cross with a snake through the middle, they still had no idea who this particular group of Dark Wizards were, they had so far found it burnt in to the wallpaper of a murder victims home, in a crop field which caused a stir with a few muggle farmers, who needed obliviated after they witnessed many robed Aurors in the middle of their field. They’d found bottles of maximum strength veritaserum in a disused warehouse stamped with such a mark. The connection was perplexing, he remembered his argument with Draco after they’d spent four hours staring at a board a picture of the crop circle, bottles and the wallpaper mark trying to connect the dots. There really was no connection between the three, but at the same time there was.
Harry knew he was staring off into space again, but he couldn’t bring himself to do anything about it really. He was bored. Draco had been distracted ever since Harry had caught him in the break room with Hermione, he’d tried to ask again what they’d talked about but each time Draco brushed it off. He was starting to feel paranoid now.
. You have no idea how marvellous it was to receive your letter.
“Oh, no I haven’t.” he replied, standing up. Picking the cups up off the coffee table, he walked the stretch to the kitchen and dumped the mugs in the sink, his eyes moving to Harry, who looked as though he could barely keep his eyes open. “You having tea?”
Draco sat on the edge of the couch studying his fingernails as he waited for Harry, of course he could just go to work without him and he’d probably be on time every day but he always waited for him regardless. The first time he’d done it, Harry asked why he waited for him - to this day he still hasn’t answered that question and after maybe the tenth time Harry asked him, he just gave up asking. There were a lot of things they did for each other that to the outside world looked odd, but neither man really cared what the outside world thought. Smoothing down invisible lines from his Auror robes, Draco sighed. Today, Harry seemed to be taking the most amount of time a person could possibly take.
He sat down at his desk and sighed, something that had become a habit recently. He unbuttoned his Auror robes and slung them across the back of his office chair. He suddenly remembered the parchment he’d shoved in his pocket, he pulled it out and smoothed it down. It looked like it had been opened and folded over several times.
My mother has been rather irritating too, she keeps coming to Grimmauld with all sorts of ‘herbal remedies’ to help with male pregnancy, she’d read about them in an old book in the Manor Library, honestly Harry, I’m about to flip. I said, Mother we have Potions now for that, you know this. Can. Not. Get. Through. To. Her.
Draco frowned and nodded, he had his fair share of nightmares, mostly to do with Voldemort or the War itself, but they still haunted him. He was sure they always would. Though he’d heard everything there was to know about Harry’s perspective, he would’ve thought Harry’s nightmares would be worse. When they were in Auror training Harry’s nightmares were so bad he had to lay next to him just to stop him from thrashing about. Draco thought about it for a moment, Harry was more important than his pride. He conceded.
“Fine, and you?” Draco asked cautiously, expecting at any point Potter was going to start fisting him. Realising what he had actually thought, Draco ducked his head down and blushed scarlet.
Draco had become obsessed with collecting marbles. It wasn’t even a useful hobby, it was mostly an annoyance. During the school holidays he’d become so consumed in his own self hatred he’d decided to venture into the Muggle world, angry at himself, his family and the entirety of the wizarding world. One rainy Sunday he’d just upped and left, thinking about his trial left a bitter taste in his mouth, he couldn’t leave the Manor without being heckled by other wizards, shunned by society - he’d thrown down his Hogwarts letter in frustration more than anything, he couldn’t believe he was allowed to go back for his Eighth Year, it seemed completely ridiculous they’d let an ex-Death Eater back into the Castle.
My beloved Draco.
Lavender shook her head, walking further into the room. She took the chair Hermione had sat on previously and studied Draco’s form, letting out a sigh. “No, Kingsley said we’re not allowed to interrogate the scumbags - Unspeakables need to do it.” she spat the last part, clenching her hands into fists. “Doesn’t surprise me.” Harry shrugged.
When Harry entered the Ministry, he let out a sigh. It felt wrong being here without Draco, he was a constant in his life. He felt nothing but a hollow shell without the man he cared so much for. Harry had decided whilst sitting in St. Mungo’s staring at Draco’s unmoving form that when he woke up he’d tell him, he’d tell him everything.
“What can we do?” asked Harry, who was at a loss.
-------------------
“What the bloody hell are you doing?!” Draco asked, trying to cover his eyes with his hand in melodramatic fashion. Harry let out a laugh. “You’ve seen me naked in the shower, and you’re upset about me taking my clothes off here?”
“You’ll be fine.” Harry whispered, his comforting words eased the nausea a little, but he couldn’t help but feel on edge. The Goblin took the key, and after a few moments the vault opened. Draco swallowed.
“Sounds like you’re important,” Potter said, stabbing a sausage with his fork. Draco chewed his bottom lip thoughtfully, before nodding his head. “I mean, who would book appointments without you?” Potter winked, shoving the sausage into his mouth.
Draco let out a snort of amusement. “I didn’t let you use it, you took it.” he shot Potter a pointed look, before the corners of his mouth turned up in amusement. Potter looked like a wounded deer in headlights. “You’re welcome.” he finally said, putting the man out of his misery.
Landing square in the middle of his and Harry’s giant shared office, Draco walked towards his desk and sat down on the chair, rolling forwards. He began to check the memos, frowning at a couple and scribbling a reply to most of them. One stuck out, however. It was on a pink muggle sticky note, which was immediately suspicious to Draco since through the Ministry memos you were only allowed to send official Ministry stamped parchment.
“Err…” he mumbled, slightly embarrassed. Draco rolled his eyes and slid into the bed, still clothed. “I was making a joke, Potter.” the blond mumbled, laying on his back. Draco felt the bed shift and continued to stare up at the ceiling. Harry lay down and let out a sigh of relief, and quite a loud yawn.
What a weirdo.
Watching as the other man walked to his bedroom, Harry sighed and wandlessly cleared up the mess, he wandered to his open bedroom door and turned his head towards Draco’s room. “Night Draco.” he whispered to thin air.
well, he still considered a better friend than any of his old ones. It saddened Draco a little, but he knew after the war a lot of the Slytherin’s had either moved out of the country or didn’t keep contact because of his family loyalties.
Harry entered the break room and frowned. Draco moved towards the refrigerator and opened it, peering inside. “What was that all about?” he asked curiously, watching Draco’s features for any tell tale signs. “Oh nothing, nothing important anyway.” Draco shrugged. He pulled out a sandwich and frowned, shrugging his shoulders.
I love you too, so very much. I can’t begin to put into words how much I miss you. We’ve never been apart this long before, I feel I’ve gone a bit neurotic in the time. I went to see the Healers today, I’ve had three panic attacks and I’ve thrown up quite a lot. They’ve done some tests on me so I’ll find out later today I suppose. I'm sorry for including that, I know you're going to be worried about me now. But do not worry, I promise I'll be fine as long as you are.
After the ceremony was over, Harry had said his goodbyes to his friends and apparated back to his flat with Draco. Slumping down on the L shaped sofa in the middle of the living room, he groaned and kicked his boots off under the coffee table, receiving a tsk from Draco.
“Down the street, you won’t miss it - it’s ghastly.” Draco said, shaking his head at the thought. It seemed rather intimate really, considering the amount of time and galleons Draco had spent at that particular cafe, to take Potter of all people. A chuckle came from the dark haired wizard, Draco raised an eyebrow and simply shrugged.
“Said about twenty minutes.” he mumbled, walking towards the kitchen. He picked up his cup of tea Draco had made him and sipped on it, his eyes rolling in delight. “Merlin you make a sexy cuppa.” Draco snorted. “Well at least something about me is sexy.” Draco muttered, walking towards the sofa. “Hey I didn’t say that was the only thing!” Harry laughed.
“I’ll make you one when you get back.” Draco smiled sweetly. Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed his wallet off the coffee table. “Prick,” he mumbled. “Do you want garlic dip?”
Harry nodded in agreement, his mind flashing back to Draco’s frail form lying unconscious in the field. “He was hit by a Stupefy, which propelled him backwards - he hit his head off a rock jutting out of the grass, he woke up briefly and cast a Petrificus Totalus on a perp, to which he then passed out.” he frowned, turning his head towards Hermione. She held her hands up “I wasn’t there, but you can’t get curse damage unless perhaps the rock itself was covered in something?” she then shook her head. “I can’t really say either way, I haven’t heard of a concoction that causes damage to nerve endings.”
Weasley walked up to Louisa and gave her a quick peck on the cheek, causing the woman’s blush to darken. “Hello” she smiled up at him, receiving a blinding smile in response.
I have to admit, the image of you pissing in Trish’s tea made me laugh ‘till tears were rolling down my face. I had to stop reading, you absolute swine. My ribs were already aching from the spells I’d caught on the field and laughing made them worse! Trish’s breath isn’t the freshest, I’ll admit that much (not quite dissecting-Flobberworm-entrails-during-Potions-lessons bad anyway!) but she is a fine enough Healer. You absolutely do not have my permission to be adding any wee to her tea. That includes Orion’s, your own or any other that you might have acquired in your travels! I’m entirely serious Draco. I’m giving you my most severe Auror face right now!
Rolling his eyes, Harry shook his head and began to tuck in to his pizza, savouring the flavour in his mouth. “Mmm.” he moaned. Draco narrowed his eyes and picked up the pot of garlic dip, ripping the tab off it and plunging the crust of his now eaten slice into the dip.
They arrived outside Gringotts and Harry had to mentally prepare himself. After what happened during the war the Goblins absolutely loathed him, he always felt deeply uncomfortable when he entered the bank. He cast a sidelong glance to Draco, who smiled at him apologetically, before they entered together.
“Hello, I’m Auror Potter, this is my partner Auror Malfoy - we’re here about your missing pumpkins.” Harry recited, as politely as he possibly could. Draco smiled and nodded to the lady, who was eyeing Draco suspiciously. “Malfoy you say?” she looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded her head. “Come in, would you like tea?” she offered, gesturing towards the worn green couch that stood proudly in front of her fireplace.
“I can imagine so.” replied Jean, shaking her head. “They’re very close.” Lavender nodded, frowning. “I’m about to go to the hospital, do you want to come with me?” Jean let out a sigh and shook her head. “I want to, but I can’t,” she turned her head towards Endelton, who stood by the end of the corridor, shifting his feet around. He looked uncomfortable and out of place. “Got to take care of Endelton, he’s shit at situations like this.” Lavender snorted, nodding her head.
your letter from my lap. I don’t blame him. He told me that I looked like a misfired
He was immediately rewarded with a bone crushing hug from his partner, his eyes widened he then smiled softly and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist. “I’m alright, let me go before you break more bones than I can heal.” Draco scolded.
"I'm going to need a bit more than 'about six foot and black hair', Potter." Chewing on his lower lip, Draco turned a page again, his eyes resting on a particular description. "Actually, I have one here, six foot, black hair, slight hunch." Harry looked thoughtful for a second before nodding. "He does have a slight hunch." He moved over to Draco and peered down at his book. "What is this?"
“What about you, Potter?” Draco asked curiously. It was definitely NOT because he was interested. Not at
That day, on Brighton beach? I realised that you were everything I’d waited for. Everything I needed.
Harry, on the other hand was having a few more problems than Draco, he heard the soft rise and fall of Draco’s breathing. He rubbed his thumb in a circular motion around the back of Draco’s hand, he felt restless. If he went to sleep, he’d miss an entire night of this.
Harry beamed.
“Right, I’ll play eye spy with you then,” Potter said, looking around the darkened room quickly, he looked deep in thought, before he turned his head to Draco. “I spy with my little eye, something beginning with L.” Potter said, staring up at Draco with an intensity that made his skin prickle.
Deciding not to pick up the note, he waited a few minutes until Harry had apparated into the office and bit his lower lip. “Harry, you know how you’re only meant to send the Ministry memos?” he started, his eyes wandering towards Harry who slumped down on his chair with a huff. “Yeah yeah I know.” he waved his hand and nodded.
say that lightly.
’ I am, bloody slut shamers,” Harry started, shaking his head. “However, I’m a virgin.” he said quite proudly. Much prouder than Draco would’ve ever assumed anyone would be at that announcement.
These days, Draco kept to himself mainly - the only friends he had left from school being Pansy and Blaise, he did have quite a decent amount of muggle friends too, his best friend being a girl called Louisa.
I will hold my hands up, I have fed him numerous sausages, numerous chicken breasts and I even shared my lunch with him today. The only consolation to this entire debacle is that I have the company of this grumpy old Crup that reminds me oh so of your shaggy hair. Actually, he kisses quite the same too. Kidding, of course. All I can think of is laying in bed with you, staring up at the gold painted stars on our ceiling. There’s nothing I want more in the world than you back here with me, I can’t take much longer.
My darling,
Once Draco had been patched up, he was immediately discharged. It amused him somewhat, he got better service when people hated him because they just wanted to get rid of him as fast as they could. “Well at least we figured out the riddle.” Harry said, nudging him gently.
“It’s a little cold, what are you watching?” Potter asked curiously. “The snow,” Draco replied, he turned his head towards Potter, searching his face for answers.
“What’s your group therapy for?” Potter asked curiously, to be quite honest Draco had no idea why Potter seemed to want to keep their conversation going. It was the most awkward and uncomfortable situation he’d put himself in for quite a few years now, which was saying something considering his experience with their last receptionist at work. The man was lets say, handsy.
“He’s awake?” Was the first thing Harry said to Lana. Nodding her head, she gestured towards Draco’s room and smiled. Harry let out a breath of relief as he entered Draco’s room, he was sat up staring out the window, lost in thought, still as pale as he was but alive,
“Thanks Ron,” Harry said, then he glanced over to Draco who looked a rumpled mess. He could see a line of blood which had dried onto Draco’s forehead, a purpling bruise forming at the top of his head. “Merlin, Malfoy you're bleeding,” he said. He stood up and allowed Ron to unbind his hands, immediately walking forwards towards the blonde.
He felt completely useless, back in the warehouse he should have alerted his team, anything could’ve happened to them. The dread of losing another one of his members hit him like a freight train. “Is everyone alright?!” He asked suddenly, looking from each person to confirm they were there.
Stood in front of a giant black and white marble podium in the middle of the Ministry of Magic, Harry Potter sighed. Two months ago, he was promoted to Head Auror and three weeks ago Ron was injured in the line of duty. They’d been auror partners since they finished training, the other Aurors had proclaimed them to be the ‘dynamic duo’ solving cases, arresting dark wizards and they were ranked best Aurors for the last five years. When Harry had been promoted to Head Auror, Ron was assigned a new partner and to his credit he was a relatively decent Auror but definitely not up to Harry’s standards. Ron and Harry had settled into a comfortable routine, they were fantastically suited to each other in every way, unfortunately whilst they were hunting down a rebel Death Eater who had intended to make his own horcruxes, Ron had gone ahead and his partner had not followed. Managing to capture the wizard, Ron also suffered deep curse damage to his right leg and he was being discharged today.
Though why should he? Draco idly wondered if he would ever get over his incessant obsessing over the boy hero. Even before Draco had turned eleven he’d heard all about Harry Potter, by the time he’d gotten to Hogwarts he saw this boy as some sort of saviour, not of the Wizarding World, but of Draco. The rejection cut him deeper than he’d like to admit, but throughout the incessant bullying and taunting, deep down Draco just wanted the idiot to notice him.
Draco and Harry had entered their office together, as soon as the door was closed Draco let out a shaky breath and stood with his back up against the door. He was a little unsteady, Harry walked towards his desk and placed a piece of parchment he’d received off Unspeakable Wilson down on his Celtic Serpent pile. His thoughts flickered to Blaise, he’d known him for a long time now, they’d gone out to the pub together, had him over to his and Draco’s flat, he’d been at his wedding, how could he know so little about the man he thought was his friend?
Draco turned his head towards Louisa, immediately scrunching his face up. What he didn’t want to witness today, or ever for that matter was his best friend snogging the living daylights out of Ronald Weasley. Actually, he never wanted to think of
Draco stood up and brushed down his robes, avoiding Harry’s gaze. He opened the door and let the memo fly through the office door, landing gently on Draco’s desk. He quietly walked over to the desk and picked the memo up. A laugh escaped his lips as he turned to Harry, holding up the offending memo in his hands.
Louisa nudged Draco’s arm, it seemed she and Weasley had stopped chatting a good five minutes ago to watch the exchange between Draco and Harry, Louisa had that mischievous look on her face again, causing Draco to scowl at her.
We were about half an hour into our walk and you laughed at our ice-creams. You couldn’t quite believe how boring the Muggle flavours were. ‘Vanilla, chocolate and strawberry,’ you exclaimed. ‘How terribly commonplace.’
“It’s Olive, dear, and yes - I found them missing this morning, what it was, was I went outside to do my usual plant watering.. Yes.” she nodded her head, beginning to pour tea in two the three cups on the tray. “And I said, well I said oh where have you gone?” Harry bit his lip harder to stifle a laugh. Draco ducked his head down, scribbling furiously at the notepad in his hands. “I thought oh well, I knew you were there last night, where could you have gone.”
Hermione looked thoughtful, before nodding her head and gesturing towards a small office room to the left of them. Once inside, he caught her in the corner of his eye motioning outside. Sighing, he placed the parchment and photograph down on the table before him and turned around, inwardly groaning at the sight of Unspeakable Wilson.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked in a hushed tone, eyes narrowed. Draco stopped, looked at Harry for a moment and then grimaced. “I think so.” he replied, trying as hard as he could to steady his voice. In truth, Draco was just teetering on the edge of a mental breakdown. He’d received an anonymous owl this morning, it had woken him up. He’d gotten out of bed quick enough that it didn’t wake up Harry, who slept peacefully next to him.
“Oh, er, well Luna plays this Sims game and he’s one of the characters - you know what, it doesn’t matter,” he let out a strained chuckle and closed his eyes.
“Yes, I need to go to St. Mungo’s I think,” he whispered, still staring into those emerald pools. Draco was sure he could get lost in those eyes, all those years spent fantasising come to life before him. “Potter…” he started, however cut off by Aurors piling into the room.
“So what kind of stuff do you do at work?” Potter asked, still staring at Draco with interest. It wasn’t as unsettling as it had been previously, but Draco had to wonder what the man had to actually look at. Of course, Draco knew he was attractive but in that I want to murder you, resting bitch face don’t talk to me or I’ll skin you alive kind of way.
“I suppose Whitney Houston is growing on me…” He said, as he leant in to kiss the dark haired wizard he’d been longing to kiss for so long.
“You’re going to die today, little traitor.” Hissed a man. Harry could hear the thump of a hand connecting with another person, he cringed. Trying to make as little noise as he possibly could, he walked forwards but kicked something as he went.
Harry was absolutely certain the only reason Draco came round to his and Luna's flat was to borrow the computer and play the Sims whilst Luna was at work. Draco sat at the computer as he usually did and thought back to his conversations with Hermione. It had been a month of her telling him to give Harry a chance, but Draco had still yet to ask Harry about the whole ‘Playboy Don Lothario’ thing he’d mentioned when they were locked in together.
“Tomorrow?” Draco asked, as during the time they’d spent talking the man had disappeared, presumably down the alleyway in question. “Tomorrow.” repeated Harry.
“I’ll bite your dick off.” he finished. Harry let out a bark of laughter. “You’ll bite my-” he was cut off by a hand slapping to his mouth. He looked at Malfoy with challenging eyes, and licked his hand. Draco recoiled and stuck his tongue out in disgust.
They began to walk forwards slowly, making sure they made as little noise as possible. When they stopped, their eyes settled on a small wooden hunting cabin in the middle of the forest. Hearing a yelp from the right of him, Harry quickly turned, his eyes darting around wildly. “Expelliarmus!” a voice Harry immediately recognised as Draco’s shouted, Harry began bounding towards the noise, Seamus following behind him.
Biting the inside of his mouth, Draco nodded. “It’s okay, I wasn’t waiting long,” he lied, he didn’t want Potter to know he’d gotten up early, showered, pampered himself before getting there early, he wasn’t entirely sure
he was blushing. “Is there something you wanted from me?” He managed to finish, quickly averting his eyes from Potter who let out a soft chuckle that made the blonds heart skip.
Harry had landed bang in the middle of St. Mungo’s entrance building. His spell began fading, instead of recasting it Harry moved forwards and wrapped his arms under Draco’s frail body, carrying him through the double doors. “Auror down!” he bellowed, signalling towards the Healers on duty.
Harry swallowed, wiping his cheeks with the back of his hand. He sat down on the linoleum floor, his back to the wall. He brought his knees up to his chest and took a deep breath. All he could do now was wait, if Kingsley summoned him back to the Ministry he’d tell him under no uncertain terms to fuck right off.
Harry walked in, shut the door behind him and tossed the parchment down on Kingsley’s desk. The man frowned, picked it up and began to read.
“Harry,” Draco said, his voice a little unsteady. Harry raised an eyebrow and turned his head towards Draco, noting that they were indeed just inches away from each other. “I wondered..”
The piece of parchment Draco had on his person
melodramatic. You’re such a sap sometimes Potter, I despair. I’m definitely one hundred percent not crying whilst I write this, because I definitely didn’t reread your letter about fifty times, no of course not. Orion is my witness, you have nothing on me!
“Hey.” Harry sighed as he walked through their office door, Draco’s head rose and he bit his lower lip, waiting for the other man to speak. Sitting down at his desk he filled Draco in on the meeting he’d had with Kingsley, after he was finished speaking Draco was rubbing his chin thoughtfully. “Lockwood hm?” he frowned. “He was quiet, but I never expected that of him.” Harry nodded in agreement, his eyes resting on the corkboard. “Well, we have the warehouse, the murder scene, the crop circle/forest cabin and Lockwoods desk now.” Harry noted, standing up he stretched out and rolled his neck, trying to relieve the building tension. His shoulder made a loud clicking noise and he grunted in response.
The seventh time it happened was more unusual than the rest. Potter’s friends appeared to be waiting for the two of them in Hogsmeade - Draco had absolutely no idea how to feel about it. Once they’d reached the group, they greeted Draco as though they’d been friends for years.
After he finished duplicating the paperwork, he sent a quick memo to Spell Damage to assist and he gathered everything up and took a deep breath - flexing his hands, he opened the office door and frowned, on the other side stood a very nervous looking Lavender Brown. “Brown, what’s up?”
I might be beside you when you receive it.
of lovemaking you’ve envisioned will be enough. Certainly, it won’t be for everything that my rioting imagination desires… I’ll leave the rest of that sentence unfinished, love. I’ll write the end tonight, lay in my lonely bed; my dreams flooded with images of your soft, flawless skin and the scent of your lemony soap.
They moved towards him with impressive speed, casting a series of status spells over Draco’s body. Harry looked down at the man in his arms, fighting back the tears that threatened to escape. Dark thoughts began to plague Harry’s mind, what would he do without Draco? If he died, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to carry on. “Please help him.” he choked out, tears began to flow freely down his cheeks, dropping on to Draco’s blood stained robes.
men, thank you.” he added. Ron cringed and ducked his head down.
Draco shook his head. Harry huffed, shaking his head. “Dick?”
“I love you.” Draco said, mustering as much courage as he could. It was obvious, he’d loved Harry for a long time but the idiot was oblivious at the best of times. Harry took in a sharp intake of breath, before his face split into a wide grin.
“I think so.” Harry mumbled, clearing his throat. His mouth was dry, his head pounding. It wasn’t unusual Harry would get a headache, but this one felt like his head was about ready to explode. “What happened?” he asked, a blush staining his cheeks.
I just received your second letter, don’t you dare apparate home Harry, you need to finish this mission. You’re a powerful wizard and they need you, we’ve got a long wait ahead of us for this baby. I’ll still be here when you’ve saved the world again. I’m somewhat less tetchy than I was earlier, I have no idea what came over me.
She added milk to the three cups, then frowned. “Oh dear, did you want milk? I forgot to ask.” Harry nodded his head and smiled “Yeah, milk is fine, Draco likes milk too.” Olive smiled in return, handing a cup to Harry. “Thanks.”
“Draco,” Harry said, a little more breathless than he’d expected. He walked towards Draco, placing his hand on the metal bed rail at the foot of the bed. “You’re awake.” He added, lamely. There were a million different thoughts and feelings going through his mind.
With his father in Azkaban, his mother moved to Paris to get away from the haunting darkness of the Manor. Draco felt unwavering loneliness, his friends had all moved on and found something worth living for, whereas he felt like he was stuck in an endless cycle of hating himself, hating life, no motivation and the lack of enthusiasm for breathing. He wasn't depressed, per se, he was just - tired. The motivation to find someone ‘special’ (as Hermione had put it) filled him with dread, especially considering the last relationship he’d tried.
“Get someone in here to.. Collect.. Fucking hell.” he shook his head, disbelief. He’d never witnessed something so gruesome in his life. Bile rose up his throat, he grabbed a hold of Draco’s hand and pulled him out into the street, gasping as the cool air hit him. Seamus looked surprised, but nodded in acknowledgement. Harry had seen some horrors in his life, but if this affected him so greatly, Seamus could only but sympathise.
Draco-
When she told Harry the details, he’d looked less than interested. She’d speculated Harry cared far more deeply for Draco than anyone knew. Lavender had watched Harry and Draco’s interactions, she was an Auror, of course. Trained to spot things normal people were unaware of, they were so deeply connected. Lavender hoped she’d find love like that one day.  Dean and Seamus had arrived shortly after explaining Henderson and Endelton were in the Minister’s office, being briefed on the Celtic Serpent case. Harry let out a sigh of relief that his team would be part of the operation, the whole team. They couldn’t do it without them.
buy junk, I bought everything we need for spaghetti bolognese, I also bought new shampoo and a rubber duck, because I heard Arthur bring them up for about the hundredth time.” Harry burst into laughter, wiping a stray tear away from his eye. “He’s been talking about rubber ducks since I was about twelve.” admitted Harry, slumping back onto the sofa.
They turned the small tv on to the left of their false fireplace. Draco seemed to enjoy the many animal themed documentaries, so Harry made the effort and bought Sky TV, just so Draco could watch them on the National Geographic. He’d never forget the look of glee on Draco’s face as he came home and found the new ‘weird lighty up box thing’ as he called it sitting to the side of their television.
“Chinese?” suggested Draco, who was now slumped in his chair - Harry always wished he had the posture and elegance Draco had, even when he was slouching - he always made it look so effortless, so perfect. “Mm, alright.” agreed Harry.
Harry rolled his eyes.
A pang of guilt hit him, here he was debating whether or not he could trust a friend he’d had for years now, and he didn’t think about how hard it must be to Blaise’s life. He shook his head in dismay, it truly was a complex situation.
Harry nodded and rubbed the side of his face, taking in a deep breath. “Okay then, let’s check the forest boundary. I doubt there would be any blueprints to that forest, unless there was maybe a cabin in the middle or something.”
Once the four of them had returned to the Ministry, Harry was immediately called in to a meeting with Kingsley. He was surprised to see Hermione and Unspeakable Wilson in attendance. Draco had been asked to attend also, Harry was sitting on the high back armchair, Draco perched on the arm of the chair. Ever since they’d witnessed the scene, Draco had never left his side. He’d even asked Harry if he needed the toilet, to which Harry immediately said yes - not because he actually needed the toilet but because Draco had never asked him this before, it was as if he already knew the blonde did not want to be alone.
smile Draco had ever seen aimed at him from Potter, it wasn’t that he had a bad smile, it was that it was very unexpected.
marble at Potter’s stupid head. It definitely was a stupid head too, what the bloody hell does one do with such a stupid head?
Chapter three as promised! Next chapter will be tomorrow at around 10PM GMT again. Tuesday (may) be a little later on at 11/12pm due to picking my brother up from hospital. If it isn't Tuesday it'll be Wednesday but I'll keep you all posted! ^.^
Harry began to read through the book, nodding his head at times, shaking his head at others. He especially liked Draco's margin notes 'This guy seems like a bit of a wanker' and 'Dropped his wallet, bent over and I could see the bloody moon.' He could tell Draco had spent a lot of time doing this considering the book seemed to be full of entries. He also noted Draco's handwriting hadn't changed since school, still beautifully written cursive.
“Home?” he sighed, turning towards Harry. Harry smiled and nodded, holding his arm out for Draco to take. “Home sounds great.”
“Can I get your number?” asked Louisa, looking up at Weasley with a hopeful expression on her face. It really baffled Draco, Louisa’s ex boyfriend Damien was what he described many times as heinously attractive, so much so it should be actually illegal. The man was well kept, had a good job and all round a decent bloke, but she’d dumped him claiming he wanted something far too serious. Louisa had known Weasley for all of five minutes and he’d never seen her
The other man, all muscles and taut skin had sent his brain into a frenzy. That and the fact Potter was half hard. Draco groaned inwardly. He’d remembered running out of the bathroom so quickly he slid on the tiles and ended up on his arse. Harry doubled over with laughter.
At around midnight, Draco had finished watching his dolphin program, then he went on to an animal rescue program after that - he was watching a dog that had been abandoned by some rather vile muggles in his opinion, nothing to do with their status as one would have once thought. When they’d received the dog it had severe starvation, as well as a few diseases. The program was called Animal Cops Houston. Draco was lucky Harry was asleep next to him his head on Draco’s shoulder because he would have laughed at Draco’s tears. The truth was, he really didn’t want to move. It was so nice having Harry so close to him, he needed to go to the bathroom about two hours ago but he held it just for the closeness. It was funny, he knew the pining was ridiculous but it seemed like they went through this endless cycle of never dating anyone else, yet dancing around each other. Draco wondered often if it worked both ways, sometimes he’d see a faraway look in Harry’s eyes, or he’d hold his gaze for a little longer than a friend would, or maybe he’d smile at him, that soft loving smile.
“Is that..?” he trailed off, eyes wandering towards Harry’s face. Harry nodded, giving him a grim smile. In front of them, stood a trinket box with the mark of the Celtic Serpents.
Draco snorted, giving him a pointed look. “If you believe that, you’ll believe anything, Potter.”
. I took those bloody awful Potions for no reason, according to the Healers I've been pregnant for quite a while! How on earth did I not notice?
After about half an hour, Draco had gone through his filing cabinets and retrieved almost every report Lockwood had ever filled out, some of them were joint with Endelton. Harry was stood clipping different pieces to the cork board he deemed necessary to the case. He’d rooted out the other cases of crop circles and put them beside the original, when he was done he frowned. They all seemed to be around the North Yorkshire area, he was sure they could rule that this particular area seemed to be where they preferred to base.
The room was silent for a few moments, before Kingsley let out a sigh and shook his head. “Keep an eye out for things that are similar to their past actions, liaise with the Department of Mysteries, share information, go through old cases and Auror Lockwood’s files, triple check. All incoming cases scrutinise for anything relating to the Serpents.” he said, dejected. Harry knew this case was serious, he knew they were at a loss. It was terrifying.
He was so fucked.
Infinite possibilities, maybe somewhere out there, there was a Draco Malfoy who married Harry Potter. Draco scoffed and shook his head. Standing up, he let out a sigh and pulled back the duvet of his bed, slipping inside.
“Lethal Weapon 2,” Potter smiled. “It’s a good one.” He stood up, eyeing Draco’s large flatscreen mounted to the wall and frowned. “I really never would’ve expected you to have a television, I mean it’s basically the feature of your entire room.” He chuckled, walking towards the television. He looked around for a DVD player, finding one on a small mounted shelf just off to the right of the television.
Louisa made a tutting noise and nodded. “Alright,” she bit her lip and closed the glove box. “Well do you know where he lives?”
“That’ll be why he did it then.” Harry suspected, ignoring Draco’s jibe about his age. Padding over to him, he felt a weird bubbling sensation in the pit of his stomach. He’d spent so much time staring at three photographs - now that there was more information he knew he’d spend more hours agonising over the same thing. Though, at least they were making some sort of progress. “I assume so.” Draco agreed, chewing on his lower lip. Harry noted that Draco’s hair was more mussed than usual, he wondered how many times he’d ran his hand through his hair whilst he wrote out the field report. He chuckled lightly. “Mm?” asked Draco, still staring at the corkboard in front of them.
“Yup, never defiled.” Harry said, sitting down on the arm of the sofa. Draco always enjoyed coming to Harry and Luna’s apartment, it was light and airy with potted plants everywhere, wild tie dye wall hangings and curtains that hung to the bottom of the floor length windows.
“You do realise your house is like 400 odd miles away, right?” Potter said, scratching the back of his neck. Draco let out an uncharacteristic sort of cackle snort hybrid, his eyes widening as he realised his reaction. “Potter,” he said, trying to muster some sort of eloquence. “We’re
Draco, who was taken aback at the request for help from Potter of all people, handed his notebook over, a frown on his face. He'd read about him in the Prophet when someone had left their newspaper on his table, he knew that Harry hadn't done what was expected of him - he always thought he would be chasing after dark wizards forever, but no.
Draco and Harry had met up for a week straight, following the man in various different ways, first with the invisibility cloak, then with polyjuice potion. Draco had gotten bored one day and decided to just walk up to the man and ask what he was doing, although it hadn’t gone very well and resulted in a very sore black eye, which he was teased for relentlessly by Harry.
And I can just imagine your face as you read this letter, love. You’re rolling your eyes at these trite, hackneyed words. But I can’t help myself. I’m ridiculous.
“The Unspeakables will be questioning the suspects.” Kingsley said evenly, smoothing down the papers on his desk. He stood up and eyed Lavender. The woman let out a noise of protest, shaking her head. “This is ridiculous, we brought them in,” she growled. “The Unspeakables have Lockwood in their department, why can’t we bloody well question the suspects we have in
“Are you two going to play footsie, share desserts and flash crazy eyes at each other?” Draco asked, looking down at the menu casually, inside he felt anything but casual.
“You don’t usually help.” he mumbled under his breath, pulling out the minced beef from the fridge. He cut open the packet and dumped it into the frying pan, placing it down on the front ring of the hob. Harry shrugged his shoulders.
Draco nodded, he shifted closer and brought his knees up to his chest, resting his head against Harry’s chest. “I’m going to talk to Hermione, she’s probably the best person to talk about this to,” Draco sighed, he ran a hand through his hair. Draco knew what that particular curse was, it turned the victims vital organs to mush, extremely slowly, extremely painfully. When he’d explained it to Healer Jenkins she’d cringed, nodding her head in agreement. There really wasn’t a name for it in particular, but his father had liked to call it Muggle Sludge, they’d primarily used it on Muggles who concluded the deaths were organ failure.
Draco has news.
Ron had joined him several minutes later, placing a kiss on his wife's cheek. “I was talking to George and I’m going to help him in the shop.” he announced, turning his head towards Harry who’s eyes widened. “That’s great Ron, you always said you wanted to help somehow.” he was rewarded with a grin and a slap on the back. “Yeah mate, I’m chuffed.”
“Me neither, still fucking annoying though.” she narrowed her eyes, her gaze wandered to Draco’s hair. “Why’s he still covered in blood?”
“See, I told you, when you find your person…” He winked. Draco really couldn’t piece together Potter, part of him wondered if the man was flirting, then the other part wondered if Potter was just incredibly bored and trying to half assedly wingman his best friend. If that was the case, Draco was not the charity case Potter was looking for.
“Do you want to sleep with me?” he asked, cringing at the way he worded it. Eloquent Malfoy, eloquent, he thought.
Rolling his eyes, Draco let out a small laugh. "I have enough galleons to sink the Titanic again, but you'll wish I asked for galleons when you try their tea."
“Yes, she's very good, she has a powerful voice, an attractive lady if you can get past the fact she has the wrong parts - she has…” Draco trailed off, trying to think of an adequate word to describe his favourite singer. “Finesse,” he settled on, nodding his head in agreement of his own words.
“You nearly died and you’re asking me if
“I’ll be back as soon as I can.” she said simply, jogging out of the hospital room. “You’ll let us know if you find anything, yes?” the healer asked, turning towards Harry. “Yes, if it helps Draco,” Harry sighed. “What’s your name?” the woman let out a laugh and smiled. “Healer Lana Williamson.” she nodded.
Harry began to explain to Draco how they’d both been hit by a stunning spell, however when Draco tumbled, the man had kicked him hard in the head, knocking Draco out. Harry then began to explain they were locked in some dingy supply cupboard, and that his hands were bound together. Draco frowned. He looked down at his own hands which were left free, but then noticed the shackles around his ankles and let out a groan.
“Chance would be a fine thing.” Harry muttered, not realising how it sounded.
“Oh honey I’m happy to see you too.” Harry teased, sitting down on the end of the sofa. Draco chuckled and grabbed the meat feast box, opening it to reveal a steaming bundle of pizza goodness. “Gods I’m so hungry.” he whined, pulling a bit of pizza out of the box.
“Malfoy, what are you thinking about?” came the quiet voice of Potter, who was standing just a little too close for comfort. Draco’s eyes narrowed towards Potter, he mumbled under his breath “What do you mean?” which came out a little more scathing than he’d intended.
“You look pleased with yourself,” Draco smirked, handing his key card to the receptionist on the desk. “Good night?” he asked, nodding his head as the receptionist explained his card had been charged for the room.
“Fucking hell you’re a dirty bastard!” he shouted, wiping his hand on his robes. “Dirty, dirty bastard. Who the fuck licks someone?”
“I’ve never been on holiday.” Potter admitted, he turned away from the canvas, his eyes resting on Draco. A fond smile appeared on his lips, he walked to the couch and sat down beside him. “I brought Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2 and Lethal Weapon 3,” Potter said, passing the DVD boxes to Draco, who took them with a smile. “Oh, I like those, which is your favourite?” Asked Draco, he looked down at the boxes and he could tell Potter had watched them before, the disk boxes were quite worn, a rip on the plastic sleeve of Lethal Weapon 2.
“I told Ron that we were coming here today, I hope he notices I never came back.” He said, shaking his head in dismay. Draco let out a sigh. “I didn’t tell anyone, I don’t really talk to anyone except you.”
, weren't they? If so, then she’s already guessed about the baby. I distinctly recollect Cissa remarking how those cookies were her particular craving when she was expecting
When Harry, Draco and Seamus had returned to the Ministry, Harry had immediately sought out Kingsley to brief him on their findings. Draco had gone back to the office to write out their field report, after asking Seamus to go down to spell damage and ask about the sticky note he’d received earlier. Upon walking through the door to the Ministers office, Harry’s eyes rested on Robards and Dean, who was sitting awkwardly in the high backed chair in front of Kingsley’s desk.
“I want to find love, but - I don’t want another Samuel.” Draco finally admitted, letting out a deep sigh.
Kicking his door open, Harry began stripping his robes off tossing them carelessly on to the floor, he yanked his wardrobe open and pulled out a pair of jeans and a soft cream jumper. He pulled his black linen trousers off, throwing them down on top of his robes and slipped the jeans on, fastening the buttons. He stifled a yawn and pulled the jumper over his ‘Guns & Roses’ t-shirt. Slipping his vans on, he walked back through to the living room and scowled at Draco who was nursing a cup of tea between his hands.
After about twenty minutes, Harry returned with two large pizzas, one meat feast and the other meatilicious, which was Harry’s. “I got those cookies that you like too.” he said as he kicked the door shut behind him. Draco’s eyes glistened and a wide smile appeared on his face. “Oh baby, am I glad to see you.” he let out a squeak as Harry handed him the box of hot chocolate chip cookies. Harry blushed and averted his eyes, placing both pizza boxes down on the coffee table.
A massive thank you to
Instead of practicing Potions, Draco had decided that the three thousand marbles he’d found all around the world was
“Couple of hours, that department is an absolute joke.” he moaned, dropping down to his office chair with a thud. “I don’t know why it takes so long for them to do anything but it bloody does”
The door swung open, a Healer in scrubs stood there blinking at the sight before him. “Can I help you?” the man asked, raising an eyebrow at Hermione. “Hello, I’m Unspeakable Hermione Granger,” she started, flashing him what she’d hoped was a genuine smile. “On behalf of the Ministry of Magic I’ve been sent here by the Minister of Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt to request an update on the status of Auror Draco Malfoy.” her heart was hammering in her chest. If the Healer contacted the Ministry they’d know it was bogus, all she had to hope was this was enough.
After briefing their team on their findings, Draco, Harry and Seamus apparated into the middle of the field. They’d cleaned the area and obliviated the farm owners, but they’d definitely missed something. The outbuildings were clear, which frustrated Harry to no ends, but they’d definitely missed something. “What could it be?” asked Seamus, who had immediately started casting to detect spell traces. “No idea.” Harry sighed.
Harry is missing Draco immensely.
with Potter, and he’d heard from other people the other man could be a bit of a sassy arsehole, but he’d never witnessed it himself.
“Luna, where have you been lately?” Potter asked, one eyebrow raised. Draco put his elbow on the table, most un-Malfoy-like, placing his chin on the palm of his hand. He listened intently as the conversation flowed between the friends, he felt most out of place.
"I need help, you're just the man!"
“I don’t know, a year maybe?” came Draco’s nonchalant reply. “I come here everyday, I haven’t a clue why,” he added, looking over to Potter, who was eyeing him with interest now. It was rather odd, he’d sit on the chair outside this ridiculously vile cafe staring at other people, but nobody ever really paid any attention to him. It was slightly unsettling having another person's eyes glued to him.
“Hi Malfoy, out here on your own?” asked a chilly looking Potter, he rubbed his bare hands together and sat down on the seat next to him. Shifting a little closer, Potter looked up at the sky, as if he was trying to figure out what it was Draco was watching.
“So, if you don’t wake up I won’t ever let you watch your documentaries ever again, no dolphins, no pharaohs, no sad doggies needing rescuing.” he announced, staring at Draco’s face - he wanted just a flicker of
Just as Draco was about to ask the burning question, a loud bang jolted him out of his musings and he heard distant shouting and the clanking of boxes outside the room. Draco held his breath and closed his eyes, hoping it was someone coming to rescue them rather than the grisly murder he anticipated.
His mind wandered back to Potter as he passed through the London streets, he was looking forward to seeing his apartment again, especially his cat. As Draco pulled up outside his flat, his eyes settled on the jet black hair of Harry Potter.
Draco stood up and wandered over to him, looking at the offending article. He laughed. “That’s Granger's handwriting, I’d recognise it anywhere.” Harry nodded. “How is it you’re so good at that?” asked Harry, he tapped a finger against the side of his head, thinking for a moment before he turned his head to the other man. “There’s been a string of crop circles around England, mostly beside forests.” Harry said lamely.
. “This is nice,” Potter said, looking up at it. Draco began to explain he’d called one tacky when he’d visited Louisa’s sister, Bethany’s house and so for his birthday last year Louisa and Bethany took it upon themselves to make one for him.
“Marbles?” Draco asked, a wild smirk appeared on his face as he held out his hand, full of glass marbles.
Lavender shook her head. “No Sir, the interview was a bust.” Harry nodded. “First warehouse, I’ll apparate in from the East, Seamus if you go for the West ask Dean to do the North, Lavender you go South,” The two of them nodded in agreement.
Dean was now sitting on the edge of the curb, his head in his hands. The contents of his stomach cleaned up from the pavement, Seamus had a careful hand on his partner's shoulder, rubbing small soothing circles on his back. “I can’t believe what I just saw.” Harry admitted.
The sight of your owl tapping on the window, your fancy writing on the envelope. Even the slight scent of the Pepper Up potion that I inhaled as I ripped open your letter. I’m not ashamed to say I felt a lump in the back of my throat. Each of these reminds me of home, Draco. I’d do anything in my power to Apparate back to your side. I’d possibly even give that wheezy old Crup Orion a kiss.
“Yeah, go on then.” he agreed, a smile gracing his lips.
“Well, I’m actually here to see you,” Draco said, he kept his tone as neutral as possible even with his inner turmoil going on. “I actually got the tickets off Granger..” he trailed off, gauging Harry’s shocked expression. The man was all rippling muscles in his tight t-shirt and jogging bottoms, a golden tan that looked as though he’d been bathing naked in the sun for months. Draco really needed to get the image of Potter sprawled over a deckchair completely naked out of his brain.
After a few more bad guesses, Draco finally took pity on the man and let out an over dramatic sigh. “Well since you didn’t get the answer, I suppose I’ll have to tell you won’t I?” he said.
“That’s because you’re a bit of a sap” Seamus smirked, causing Draco to glower at him. “I am not, that one is full of tragedy!” he stated. “My entire life is a tragedy, I want something scary.” Harry smirked, shaking his head at Draco’s reaction. “You’re scary enough.” Draco scowled.
As for Narcissa, be kind! She’s just so terribly anxious that everything goes okay with-
Dear Harry,
“So Malfoy, I read this thing in the Daily Prophet,” Potter began, sitting down beside the blond. An eyebrow quirked up, Draco felt his already unsettled stomach churn a little more. “If you complete puzzles every day it helps with your mental abilities.”
“Hey Malfoy!” a voice came from behind him, in rather a frantic manner. “I’m so sorry, I slept in,” Potter said, jogging towards Draco, who eyed him with a curious look.
-------------------------
“Who’s there?!” The voice called. “Lumos!” He shouted, waving his wand around. Harry’s heart was hammering so hard he was sure it was going to burst out of his chest soon, he really wasn’t cut out for Auror work, he was about ready for a full blown panic attack.
Harry looked at him for a moment, as though he was thinking about it before nodding slowly. He smiled at Draco and placed a hand on his forearm. “Thanks, that would be good.”
Harry let out a chuckle and smiled at Draco, shaking his head a little before standing up. “You’re a funny one, aren’t you Malfoy?”
Potter pushed his copy of the Daily Prophet towards Draco casually, he then picked up a piece of the uneaten toast off of Draco’s plate and began munching on it.
Louisa emitted a confidence Draco envied, at five foot nine and long honey golden curls flowing elegantly down her back, she was never short of a date. It amused Draco that she was wildly uninterested in an actual relationship. Though Louisa did struggle personally, he’d met her at a support group for PTSD connecting immediately.
I love you, Draco. Now and forever.
“That’ll be the food.” Harry said lamely. Stood up, he walked to the door and opened it, grinning at the delivery boy stood before him. “Hiya Harry, here’s your food.” This particular delivery driver had been Harry and Draco’s favourite since they moved in. The first piece of mail they’d gotten was a menu to this particular Chinese takeaway and they’d immediately gone - Draco said it was simply ‘not polite’ to ignore mail, Harry had tried to tell him that if they answered every piece of junk mail they’d ever get they’d never have any time for anything else but Draco on this occasion had been too hard to reason with.
“Yes, I suppose that’ll be fine,” she grumbled, nodding her head. Kingsley could tell she wasn’t thoroughly pleased with the idea, but nonetheless accepting. “I’d like to go back to the hospital and see how Harry is doing.” she announced. After nodding his head, Kingsley gestured for her to go. Lavender offered a small smile, bowed her head and exited the doorway, closing the door behind her.
Love,
“Apparently Gringotts have found a vault belonging to my father, so I have an appointment to go see what the fuck it is.” Draco grumbled, pulling out a pan from the bottom cupboard. Harry immediately felt a wave of relief wash over him. His frown deepened, he knew Draco despised anything to do with his father, but he idly wondered why the appointment was scheduled for later on. “I’ll come with you.” Harry announced, nodding his head.
Sometimes Hermione would talk about Potter, mostly complaining to her husband about how Potter seemed to do absolutely
Harry nodded, though Draco probably couldn’t see it. “Yeah, she’s really the only one that understands how absolutely fucked up I am but doesn’t push me to ‘do better’,” he said, the latter dripping with sarcasm. “Hermione constantly reminds me I should be doing better with my life, Ron tries to get me to join him in the shop, if I talk to Neville he suggests 'oh Harry, how about you come and be a teacher at Hogwarts!'” Draco could hear the slump of Harry’s head hitting the wall behind him. “It’s utter bullshit, I’ve never even had a proper relationship, I’ve gone on like three dates and somehow the entire Wizarding World assumes I’m some sort of Don Lothario, playboy fuckboy.”
Unspeakable Wilson snorted, but nodded. Hermione rolled her eyes and stood up, smiling at Harry. “Thank you, if we find anything shareable we will let you know.” Wilson stood up and exited quickly, robes billowing behind her.
You’ll be happy to know that all the breeding dragons were rescued safely, lovely. They’ve all been transported to Charlie’s sanctuary to love what we all hope will be much more joyful lives. I do, however, take your point about Hagrid! I know I ought to be more discreet when I talk to him but I find when I’m there, sharing those God-awful rock cakes, that I simply cannot help myself.
After the speech had ended, Harry walked off the platform and towards the crowd, he answered several questions of reporters that had been present as best he could before he walked straight towards Hermione, who smiled warmly at him and greeted him immediately. “That was a nice speech Harry.” she placed a hand on his shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze. “I just wish it wasn’t happening.” he admitted, shaking his head. “Mm.” she nodded.
My chest is swollen with an absurd, illogical pride. I never believed that anyone would care, or want me enough to share their lives with me, let alone choose to carry my baby. Even though we’ve been separate, a part of me is still there with you. You’re growing our child, Draco, made with our love (and, I’m sorry, just a few atrocious tasting potions!) and they are getting bigger and stronger with every moment that passes.
Harry nodded and wrapped his hand around Draco’s, he moved a strand of hair out of the other man’s face and sighed. Hermione watched him, pursing her lips.
“I haven’t seen any of this stuff before.” Draco admitted, gripping Harry’s hand a little tighter. Harry nodded. “It all looks very… Expensive?” he shrugged. Draco nodded too, biting his lip. They spent about thirty minutes scanning all the various objects around the room. It seemed to be family heirlooms mainly, he wondered why his mother had never mentioned it.
“Those are my fucking boxers Potter!”
Harry let out a laugh “I asked the same thing, something to do with curse damage can’t touch them bollocks.” he shrugged. Lavender frowned, leaning back in her chair. “Right.”
Another hooded figure turned up, Seamus found himself immediately duelling the new figure, curses began flying back and forth the steady stream of magic illuminating the area. Harry moved up behind Draco and pointed his wand towards the attacker, from this angle he could see the man's face a little better. He had blue eyes, pointy features - he didn’t recognise the man but maybe Draco would.
“I suppose..” Draco said, chewing his lip again. Potter cleared his throat and passed a wooden box over to Draco. “I er, nearly forgot,” Potter said, looking somewhat awkward. “Thanks for err.. Letting me use it.” he said lamely, rubbing the back of his neck.
“Hey, what’s up?” he asked, clearing his throat after. “Wondered if everything was alright.” Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. He turned to the corkboard, cringing as he heard Harry tut. He knew Harry was frustrated with their case, but nevertheless Harry stood up and walked over to the corkboard. “Well, I suppose I’ll take these down.” he mumbled, removing the yarn twisted around many pins.
“Yes.” he replied simply. Tsking, Unspeakable Wilson nodded her head. “I hope that will not cloud your judgement, Auror Malfoy.” Draco snorted, shaking his head. The statement had caught him a little off guard. The majority of the Ministry knew his disdain for his father, however he wasn’t sure how far that knowledge stretched.
Sorry it's late! Had a little crisis, but it hath been averted kind Sirs / Madames / Other
Draco looked up at him, turning his head to the side a little as though he was trying to figure Potter out, maybe the flicker of something in his eyes, a twitch of an eye, or the turn of a lip. Unfortunately, Potter had always and will always be an absolute enigma to the blond. “PTSD.” he said, shrugging his shoulders.
. The only way I’d ever get an exclusive is if I were selling stories about myself! Although, as we’re on the subject of that infernal bloody rag, you ought to warn Gin and Pansy about playing footsie and holding hands before they’re really ready to go public. Remember how they outed us before we’d even admitted to ourselves that we’d fallen in love? Luckily it only drove you and I further into each other’s arms but I wouldn’t want our friend's relationship to be headline news before they both wanted it to be.
then again, he did steal my food. I seem to be rather protective of my food lately.
Draco looked towards his book, he felt his cheeks warm and tilted his head a little, his fringe covering his face. “Oh, well,” he stuttered, finally he looked up at Potter, who was waiting patiently for a response, he realised Potter had caught on to his discomfort, the other man’s blazing green eyes widening. “It’s..”
“Narcissa is in France, also I don’t think she would’ve done this.” Harry admitted, shaking his head. “She sends Draco letters a lot, we go and visit.” he ran a hand through his hair. Narcissa Malfoy was a complicated woman and although she loved Draco dearly he felt every time he saw her that she could see straight through him, to his soul. Narcissa had stated one day whilst they wandered through the vineyard together she knew Harry loved Draco. He’d looked at her quickly, a blush staining his cheeks. From then on, she cast him knowing looks, or he caught a small smile whenever she watched the two of them.
“Of course it is, Potter,” he sighed. “It’s my idea.”
And soon, my darling, it won’t be a fantasy.
Harry stood at the doorway, his eyes scanning Draco’s bedroom. It didn’t really look much different to when they’d originally decorated it, there were odd things that was different. Draco had insisted on the four poster bed stood proud in the middle of his back wall, an amethyst canopy draped elegantly over the dark stain wood, Harry smiled. He had assumed Draco would choose green but when they chose the colours he was impressed. Draco’s walls were cream coloured and his carpet the same shade of purple as his canopy. He’d chosen not to have curtains round the bed, however. A plush white rug sat to the right of his bed and the entire right wall was dedicated to Draco’s in built wardrobes, a giant floor length mirror attached at the middle.
“What the absolute fuck.” Draco said, shaking his head. Harry took a careful look at his partner, his face ashen. The room was destroyed, broken pieces of furniture scattered along the back wall, the sofa upturned in the small joined kitchen. The carpet which was once a light green colour was now stained dark with blood. The body, which Harry could only assume was female cut into pieces, the parts scattered in to the Celtic Serpent symbol. Harry immediately turned around and gagged.
“What the fuck are we going to do?” mumbled Seamus. Dean shook his head in response, unable to reply. “It seems you’ve found yourselves stuck here, Auror Finnigan.” Lockwood spat, his mouth twisted into a sick smile.
“Yeah, it’s Harry, yeah.” he sat on the edge of the sofa, now wearing a blue t-shirt with a picture of an eagle on it and a pair of black jogging bottoms, his socks pulled over the bottoms of the joggers. Harry often felt the cold, which amused Draco since he always felt like he was on bloody fire. “Yeah usual place, er - can I get two chicken chow meins, some chicken balls with barbeque sauce,” he looked over to Draco, who was nursing a cup of tea and leaning casually against the island counter in their kitchen. Draco had also changed into a pair of soft black linen trousers and a long-sleeved green top. Harry mouthed ‘do you want the chicken stuff?’ to Draco, who nodded in agreement.
“Right, well…” Draco muttered, he really didn’t want to be here longer than he had to be, even if Louisa seemed to be hanging on Weasley’s every word. They’d started up a conversation about the Quidditch match, beside him, Potter groaned.
Harry had sat back down on the linoleum floor, his boots squeaking as he slid down. He kept shifting his boot against the floor, wincing at each squeak. “How is he?” a voice came from beside him. Harry turned his head and frowned. “Hermione? What are you doing here?” he asked, wondering how long she’d been sitting there before she spoke. Harry hadn’t noticed her entrance, though since Hermione had joined the Unspeakables she was even sneakier than before. The thought amused him, Ron often complained about it.
Draco let out a huff and ran a hand through his hair. “What?” he said, poking Potter’s shoulder with his index finger. “What’s so funny?”
For weeks, reporters had stood outside the Ministry trying to get an interview with Harry - stating he had to find and neutralise the next Dark Lord as he’d done previously. He hated the hero worship and often wondered if he’d gotten his job so quickly and easily because of the fact, but he knew deep down he did incredible work. His team were the best there had been for years and their case completion rates were near impeccably fast.
“Well, I thought you might like puzzles,” Potter said, rubbing his chin. “
He could feel Potter shifting around behind him, the only thing Draco heard after was the rapid beating of his heart.
Pursing her lips, Louisa nodded her head. One of the best things about her was the fact she did not press, she believed in letting you do things in your own time. Something Draco often wished his parents had learnt. He shuddered remembering his mother prying, rummaging around his bedroom after he’d sat staring at his cutlery one day instead of eating his dinner.
He didn’t really eat a lot these days, but he did enjoy the occasional food binge now and again. The last time he’d done it he’d gotten a sugar rush so intense it took three hours to come down, Bethany had never stopped laughing the entire time. They’d decided to watch Willy Wonka and Louisa stated you could
Harry nodded, it was always painful to lose a friend. A pang of guilt and sadness hit him as he thought of Fred, it had taken George a long time to accept that his twin was gone - he’d gone to see a Mind Healer in St Mungo’s for a while, he was doing relatively well now and the Wheezes shop was doing phenomenally. Though every so often, he could see that far away gaze on George’s face, Harry knew Fred would be proud of what his brother had accomplished.
Draco groaned, pulling his knees up to his chest. To be perfectly honest he’d always been shit at eye spy but he had absolutely no idea what else to suggest, truth or dare seemed a little juvenile, or rather he didn’t really want to be spilling his secret to Harry bloody Potter.
“It’s fine Potter, I’m not that invested in your love life.” he lied, though secretly pleased Potter was indeed unattached.
“Yeah,” Harry breathed. “Yeah, it is.”
I’m rambling, I’m excited, Harry come home soon.
Beside him, Harry didn’t feel any better. He’d been surprised when Draco suggested sleeping with him. Admittedly his mind drifted to other things ‘sleeping with’ meant, he had to turn away to hide the blush that rose up his neck, staining his cheeks. If he was honest with himself he’d often thought about Draco in.. Certain sexual terms. Rolling his eyes, he turned his head and looked over at the other man. Shifting closer to Draco, he wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and rested his head on Draco’s chest. Hoping it wasn’t crossing a line, he waited for a moment but when he heard no response from Draco he bit his lower lip. “I hope this is okay.” he whispered, he felt awkward.
Well, I’m going to go finish my batch of Pepper Up now before it all blows up in my face. Please, for the love of Merlin stay safe, I find myself worrying most days I’ll get an owl you’ve been killed or something.
Draco.
“I can’t believe we just watched that,” Admitted Potter, shaking his head in disbelief. They’d polished off two of the pizzas and Draco’s stomach was thoroughly stuffed. Draco let out a laugh and nodded his head. “Who knew there was so much to learn about camels?” Draco said, standing up. He shook his ankle a little and stretched his arms above his head, letting out a yawn.
“Well, you see…” Draco looked down at his feet, he felt somewhat uncomfortable asking this particular question, he’d rehearsed it in his head for two years now, but now the day was here how do you ask your former rival for your bloody wand back? Especially the one he took from you?
They become great friends over the course of the eighth year, people often commented on the weird close friendship they’d shared but neither boy really cared what other people said about them. Hermione would often find Harry sitting beside Draco as he brewed potions, or on the couch in the eighth year dorm reading to each other, she’d always suspected there was more going on than simple friendship but never pressed.
For Merlin’s sake he couldn’t even sleep without Draco these days. The door to his office banged open, pulling Harry out of his musings. Harry welcomed distraction.
Harry had decided to clear his head, he’d take Draco with him to visit Mrs. Dunn about her prized pumpkins. He wasn’t sure if this was Kingsley’s idea of a joke passing this particular case on to his department, but he decided not to press. There were other Aurors that could deal with this sort of case, but then Harry mentally scolded himself for thinking so highly of himself.
Draco copied his nod, walking off to the right where he sat down on one of the wooden benches along the back wall. Harry sat down beside him and put a comforting hand on Draco’s knee. “Do you know what’s in the vault?” he whispered. Draco shook his head. “No, but knowing my father it will be a load of expensive junk.” he spat, bitterly.
Harry looked at him, his mouth shaped in a perfect ‘o’. “Uh, well, I spent my entire life fighting dark wizards, I thought maybe I could just be ah - well, Harry,” he said, scratching the side of his head. The other man looked awkward, Draco noted. “But yes, finding out his name seems like a good idea.” A small smile appeared on his lips, it was a little comfort to see, but didn’t cure the uneasy feeling settling in Draco’s stomach.
In walked Seamus, his hair sticking to his forehead with sweat. “We think we’ve found Endelton’s location,” he said, panting. It seemed as though Seamus had been running. Harry raised an eyebrow and stood up, brushing his robes off. “First warehouse, we cleared it a while ago and removed the wards, his last known location was about a mile away from it.” Seamus said, passing a piece of parchment towards Harry.
Harry slapped his hands onto his thighs and stood up, nodding his head towards Draco. “Well we best be off, we’ll be in touch about your pumpkins Mrs. Dunn.” she handed both of them a few biscuits for the road and they left the cottage about 45 minutes after they’d entered.
Harry took it eagerly, scanning the document in question before nodding his head. “Right, let’s go then,” he said, exiting his office with Seamus close behind him.
“Head Auror.” Wilson greeted, swishing round the room with her charcoal black robes, her posture and swish was something even Snape would be envious of. “Unspeakable.” he nodded. Hermione closed the door behind her and walked around to the other side of the table, taking a seat next to Unspeakable Wilson.
“It’s going to be so exciting.” Draco announced sarcastically. “The most fun I’ve had in
“Right well I went down to cooperation - they were as fucking useless as they ever have been, they sent out a fucking memo to Major Crimes and said we’ll find out when we find out.” Draco grumbled.
I’m relieved they’re sending the eggs to Charlie, though I expect you’ll need to provide an entire rundown to Hagrid on the dragons, down to the colour of the wings. According to Neville, Hagrid has been talking none stop about your secret mission, I've told you once and I will tell you a thousand more times - Harry, Hagrid is the least reliable source to give information to. I implore you, keep your beak shut.
“Are you alright?” Potter asked. His voice sounded hoarse and Draco winced. “Yes, my head though, it - well it hurts.” he answered.
interested, put it this way Potter, if I’m not pregnant I will be very soon. I’m not going to let you out of our sheets for at least a week.
But fuck he looked fit.
“Sorry.” Harry said sheepishly, pulling back from the hug. A blush stained his cheeks, he turned quickly towards Seamus and ran a hand through his hair. “Anything?”
“Me? No, er.. No,” Potter stammered, a blush rising up his neck. “I err-” Potter looked down at his hands again, making circular motions against the table with his index finger. Draco laughed, startling the dark haired wizard.
They waited a further five minutes before a Goblin came out of a side door, beckoning the two of them to enter the room. Once inside, Draco took a seat in a plush armchair turning his attention to the Goblin who sat behind the desk.
“So I guess I get to watch documentaries on dolphins, pharaohs and what was it? Sad doggies needing rescuing?” Draco said quietly, a smirk appearing on his lips. Draco was barely conscious but he’d heard Harry talking. When he’d asked the Healers, they couldn’t explain it - other than perhaps they’d caught it very quickly.
Here we are with Chapter 2. Next chapter will be uploaded around the same time tomorrow. Hope you like it! Thank you for the kudos guys! <3
“Nope, try again,” Potter smiled.
First: I love you. I miss you, and I love you. This mission is the hardest one that I think I’ve ever encountered and now, as it begins to draw to a close, all my thoughts are of home.
“I’m good thanks, are you going to Hogsmeade this weekend?” Potter asked, chewing the inside of his mouth.
Harry turned his head towards Draco and smiled. It was the first
The question caught Draco off guard somewhat, he knew it was coming - after all, Pureblood muggle hating Malfoy couldn’t possibly befriend a muggle, right? But at the same time he wondered if Potter dared ask. “I met Louisa at a group therapy session.” he said, looking down at his own drink. Draco had never really thought about it before, he had no prejudice during group therapy, by then he’d already decided that he was utterly wrong about the world. Their meeting was by chance and possibly one of the most important things to ever happen to him, in his own opinion of course.
“We need to find Endelton.” he stated simply.
“Yes, it was in my memo pile, nobody can get through those office doors unless they’re you or me, or one of us is present when they enter.” he frowned down at the sticky note and levitated it into a spell proof clear plastic bag, sealing it at the top. “I wonder if Hermione has seen anything like this.” Draco wondered out loud, causing Harry to chuckle. “If she had she’d not tell us, Unspeakable nonsense and all that.” Draco nodded in agreement and stood up, picking the bag up. “I’ll take this through and see if there’s any curses on it and see if they can maybe trace who sent the memo.”
“Why do they always have to choose the creepiest places?” moaned Harry, running a hand through his wild hair. Draco raised an eyebrow. “Oh yes, Potter, they’re going to operate in the middle of a beautiful meadow filled with butterflies, rainbows and the occasional fluffy Crup,” Draco said sarcastically, rolling his eyes.
“I understand this is your father’s vault.” Unspeakable Wilson said, she looked at Draco for a few moments, as though lost in thought.
“Right well, we could start by trying to find out his name - have you still got that invisibility cloak?” asked Draco, frowning. Draco thought back to the times where he’d caught Potter following him, and perhaps the amount of times he’d just let him. “Why didn’t you join up with the Aurors?” Draco asked abruptly, he wasn’t even sure why he asked, it was almost like word vomit. Draco had actively tried to avoid that topic, but it seemed his curiosity got the better of him.
Harry shook his head “They’re duplicates, for you.”
“Hiya, how’s it going?” Returning the smile, Ron leant down to kiss his wife on the forehead before plonking down on the seat next to her. Draco shrugged a shoulder casually, clearing his throat. “Your wife here is trying to get me to go on a date with Potter.” He said, glaring at Hermione who looked amused.
I even barked back at Orion! Of all the things, a grown wizard stood in his kitchen barking at a bloody animal. You’d think
He could hear the clanking and banging of Harry rummaging around his room, grunts and sighs. Draco stood up straight and walked towards Harry’s bedroom door, knocking lightly. “We’re going to be really late today.” he mumbled, wincing as he heard Harry curse loudly. “I can’t find my fucking wand!” Harry yelled, wrenching the door open. “It’s on the coffee table.” Draco frowned.
This state of affairs between Ginny and Pansy does seems to have gone from tepid to sizzling hot in the space of only a few weeks. I agree with you: it all seems rather sudden. I mean,
Draco raised an eyebrow and pondered the idea of the game for a few moments. “That sounds like fun actually,” he admitted, ducking his head down. He felt a little silly for having this conversation with Potter while they were trapped in this dank room, but nevertheless he continued. “Do you think you could show it to me someday?” Draco asked hopefully. There was nothing as depressing as his current life so the thought of controlling a fantasy life where Draco Malfoy could get married, he could have a thriving career and wear something other than a gray suit and mope outside a gaudy cafe sounded like heaven.
After they’d finished their cake, cleared up the place Harry had disappeared into the bathroom the soft sound of water trickling. Draco smiled. He entered his bedroom and quickly got changed to a smart black three piece dress robe. He was fixing his cufflinks when Harry entered his room, towel slung around his waist.
Sipping at his drink lightly, he placed it back down on the wooden table and met Hermione’s eyes, almost a challenge. The door to Costa swung open and in walked the ginger head of Hermione’s husband, Ron.
“Harry are you alright?” asked Lavender, her tone was soft, something that didn’t usually come from the woman. Harry nodded slowly, a pained smile directed towards her. “Yes, thank you.” he whispered. Harry thought back to Lucius Malfoy’s vault. They’d seen the trinket box together, but Draco had been the one to shield it and bring it to the Ministry. “Lavender,” he started, he frowned the overwhelming sense that he’d forgotten something - he clicked his fingers. Harry’s eyes then widened. “Lavender, can you go to the Ministry, ask for a meeting with Unspeakable Wilson, the box, the box we recovered from the vault. Ask Unspeakable Wilson if she’s scanned it.” Harry gave her a knowing look, Lavender nodded and stood up.
It was something he thought about quite a lot, though he had also come to the conclusion that nobody would ever love him too so it really was quite a pickle he’d gotten himself into.
Dear Harry,
Draco finished writing in the notepad and picked his tea up again, listening intently as Harry had a light conversation with Olive about her pumpkins - then her grandchildren, what turned in to a light conversation turned into a full blown discussion about cooking. Harry enthusiastically discussed Draco’s cooking, praising how much he enjoyed it when he did cook, then explained they were much too busy for that these days. Olive had put a hand on his thigh and smiled. “Well, if two lovely young men like you can work together too, you’ll be married for years! Just like me and my Henry.” Harry blushed profusely and shook his head, but Draco couldn’t help but notice he hadn’t put her right about their relationship.
“What did you buy?” asked Harry, turning his head in Draco’s direction with a raised eyebrow. Draco merely shrugged his shoulder and dumped the bag down on the countertop. Tossing the applecore in to the bin, he quickly washed his hands and opened his grocery bag. “I got marshmallows, haribo, jelly beans, dolly mixtures, hmm,” he trailed off, picking up a packet of sweets from the bag. “Pear drops, they sound interesting.” he nodded in approval. Harry sat up and let out a laugh. “Are you serious? You went to Tesco to buy random junk?”
“Mr. Lockwood, you are a part of the Celtic Serpent group, correct?” she asked, her voice was even and controlled. Lavender sat at the back, silently praising Hermione for not just hurling herself over the table and smashing his face in. Merlin knows she’d like to do that.
“Harry what’s wrong?” he asked finally, letting out a sigh. Harry looked up at him, frowning. “What do you mean?” he asked, picking his fork up. He twirled spaghetti around his fork and raised it to his mouth, staring at Draco expectantly.
Standing up, Draco brushed off his Auror robes and walked over to Harry’s desk, standing in front of it. He waved his hand in front of Harry’s face and smirked. Harry looked up at Draco with a blank expression on his face, suddenly his features changed and he offered Draco a warm smile.
Harry groaned and peered down at the parchment in Draco’s hands. Seamus turned to the two men and walked forwards. “There’s faint spell traces here, they lead off to the edge of the field. Maybe a few days old, they’ve definitely been back whoever it was that was here.”
These days, Draco preferred the company of himself - he tried to avoid social interaction as much as he could. Often, he’d receive letters from his mother that he failed to reply to each the same as the last, his mother reminding him to eat and talk to people.
Pansy had become pretty good friends with Hermione and Luna, but Luna more than most. Being the editor of Witch Weekly, they talked a lot of shop what with Luna being the editor of the Quibbler and they liaised on quite a few articles between them.
Over the next few months, Harry and Draco met up almost every day. They quickly became close friends, bonding over their mutual taste in music, books and travelling. The day Harry showed Draco the Sims was the day he realised he really shouldn’t have mentioned that game to Draco, ever.
“Is this some sort of inside joke I don’t know about?” Draco asked, scowling at the two of them. “No mate, no joke.” Weasley said, but the smirk never faltered.
There’s something about that giant’s reassuring presence that reverts me straight back to being a teenager. Poor Nev will no doubt have been given a full rundown of each and every dragon that we saved by now: I have, of course, sent Hagrid a full report. It was definitely the Horntail that gave out team the most trouble. Before you panic, there’s only a tiny patch of hair that’s been scorched off my already untidy head.
As it turned out, it had been the best meal Draco had ever tasted. The sausages were done to perfection, the bacon just the right amount of crispy, baked beans - something Draco never thought he’d find himself eating were so rich and flavourful, with mushrooms and toast. It was heavenly. Since then all Draco seemed to order was the Full English, which always made Louisa cackle.
Harry.
“Come back you!” Draco shouted, his boots clunking against the floor as he ran. “No! I didn’t mean it Draco no!” Harry stood up against the front door, his hands up in the air in surrender.
“Ugh you do it, I’m Head Auror I’m a busy man.” he moaned, putting his arm over his eyes in mock pain. “I’m Deputy Head Auror, I’m busy too.” Draco pointed out, clicking the kettle on. “For fuck sake Harry buy the bloody pizza before I starve to death.” Draco groaned, pulling two cups out of the cupboard overhead and placing them down on the counter beside the kettle.
“So I’m not dead then,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes. When he’d woken up he had two Healers standing over him with the weirdest expressions on their faces. To start with, Draco was sure he would get a lecture about his past Death Eater activities, or how reckless or idiotic he’d been, but instead they’d immediately looked relieved, checked him over and told him they’d contact Harry Potter. Of course they would, Draco could imagine how the dark haired man would’ve been when he found Draco unconscious.
Dear Harry,
Harry turned away, knocked on the door and entered as soon as he heard the Minister’s voice. Once inside, he closed the door behind him, cast a few silencing spells and sat down on the armchair opposite Shacklebolt’s desk. “Harry, what can I do for you.” the man smiled, looking up at him.
After they’d finished their desserts, Potter suggested going to the pub for a few drinks, to which Draco politely declined. He was already feeling somewhat tipsy from the two Gin’s he’d had waiting for Louisa and Weasley. The dessert they’d bought was so enormous they couldn't actually finish the entire thing. It amused Draco that Louisa was defeated by a dessert, but it seemed to amuse Potter more in Weasley’s case.
department?”
It was all very sickeningly sweet. “Well, I suppose we better get going back to London,” Draco finally said, placing his knife and fork down on his empty plate. He downed the rest of his Gin and Lemonade and gave Louisa a look, which she knew all too well.
Draco took in a deep breath and nudged Potter, passing over his notebook with all of his careful descriptions of various different passersby and motioning towards the book with his head. “I figured out some information if you’d care to read.”
I’d better go, Draco. Ron is giving me the filthiest of glares from across the room. He wants to go to sleep but I have my wand
“Extra wards, paranoia you know?” Harry said, shrugging. Draco nodded again. Harry was a little worried at how quiet the other man seemed to be. “So pizza?” he repeated. “Sure.” Draco replied, walking towards the kitchen, he opened the cupboard and pulled out all the snacks he’d bought previously, laying them on the counter.
“Thanks.” Draco finally said, turning his head towards Louisa, who had not said a single word. Louisa cleared her throat and looked up at Potter, Draco could tell she wanted to say something this was what she usually did - the woman always needed to think about what she said before she actually said it.
"There's a guy that meets there every day at about 2, he's selling illegal potions and I thought I'd investigate." Harry put simply, his eyes fixed on Draco. Sniffing, Draco turned to Harry and laughed. "You're not an Auror Potter, why are you investigating illegal potion sales?" Harry shrugged in response. Pushing himself off the wall, he straightened up and bit down on his lower lip. "It's not as if I have anything else to do." he mumbled, narrowing his eyes.
---------------
Frowning, Draco ran a hand through his hair and opened his notebook, scanning through it, he ran his fingers along the lines and shook his head, turning to the next page. "What does this bloke look like?" He turned the page again, looking up to meet Harry's gaze. "Err - he's about six foot, black hair..."
Potter let out a low laugh, turning his head towards Draco. “That, Malfoy, is the noise of shagging,” he said, clearly hiding none of his amusement. Draco scowled, he should’ve known that,
Draco cringed. What a philistine.
“Anyway, he was asking about you because he doesn’t know a lot about you - we all know from experience that Harry loves to find out about Draco Malfoy, in any way he possibly can.” The chuckle that escaped Hermione’s lips was very unlike her, and beside her a smirk settled on Ron’s face.
Once they’d all eaten and discussed everything, they left the break room in pairs. The day didn’t seem to be productive for Harry, but it felt more serious than it had before.
“Light switch?” Draco offered, shrugging his shoulders.
The sixth time it happened, Draco had been standing waiting for almost an hour out in the courtyard, it was quite chilly so he had his long black coat buttoned almost to his neck, his large green scarf wrapped around his neck. Absolutely convinced that Potter had been messing with him when he’d asked him to Hogsmeade, Draco let out a sigh, his breath clearly visible in the cold air.
I'll meet you at the Altar, I'll be the one with the rose.
“What the fuck else was your father involved in?” Harry spat venomously. Draco let out a groan. “Fuck knows, but we’ll have to take this to Kingsley.” Harry nodded and looked at him sympathetically. “I guess there goes our evening plans.”
“Alright?” came a voice from the right of them, Draco turned his head, eyes resting on Potter, who Merlin’s absolute twatting beard looked even better than he did yesterday. He’d definitely showered, Draco could smell the slight hint of an apple scented shampoo. Wearing a tight fitting black t-shirt and a pair of jeans. Draco idly wondered if Potter had to use magic to get those clothes on himself, there was no way he’d be able to pull them up himself.
He had it in his breast pocket, folded neatly. His heart began to race wildly as he’d read it. He reached into his pocket, his fingers tracing the edges of the paper. He thought about showing it to Harry before they entered the Ministry, but he chickened out at the last possible moment. He knew Harry would be angry, so instead he kept it to himself.
The reason that I’m writing? To give you a bit of warning. The raid wasn’t
We did it, I can’t believe we did it! Come home soon and safe, I love you, I told Orion and he jumped up on me, I think he’s happy too or perhaps I fed him too much chicken, but he's a fiend Harry! A fiend I tell you! Regardless of that, Potter, get your hide home before I tan it! I'm so happy I'm about to throw up again, which is
Ron has been liaising with his brother Charlie. Many of the smuggled eggs, as well as the recently hatched dragons will hopefully be heading in the direction of his sanctuary. It’s just a case of getting them out safely. Charlie is optimistic that a few of the older dragons might be able to be released back into their natural habitats after intensive rehabilitation, but that’ll take a good few years. How anyone can treat these beautiful, magical creatures in the despicable way that the smugglers have is utterly beyond me.
I’m allowed to melodramatic, you cheeky, lovely man! You’re pregnant, glorious and I haven’t seen you in far too many weeks. That’s very soon to be rectified, though! Our mission here is France is officially over. My bags are packed and the paperwork is pretty much completed.
“Rude.” Draco said, narrowing his eyes. Potter just let out a laugh.
“Knockturn,” Draco grimaced, the thought of going down that alleyway again filled him with dread, however, he quickly regained his composure and shrugged a shoulder. “They can’t be very good criminals if they operate in plain sight, Knockturn is mostly watched closely these days,” Draco said, thinking back to his own dealings with Knockturn, his father even.
Harry wasn’t really sure what was going on between them, but they came home so exhausted at the end of the day they barely got around to eating nevermind talking. He was sat at his desk, twirling his self inking quill round his fingers. He’d assigned Endelton to clean up after a few wizards got in a heated debate which resulted in a duel, slap bang in the middle of Carlisle. Brown had gone with him, he suspected something was going on with Henderson and Brown, but he didn’t pry into his Auror’s personal lives.
Draco opened his eyes, squinting at the light. The most indescribable pain like a lead brick pressed against his temple. “Ughh” he moaned, bringing his hand up to his head. “What the fuck..” he whispered. Pulling himself up onto his knees, Draco noticed Auror Lockwood studying him. Draco’s eyes went wide. “Fuck, what the..” he was caught off by the sound of pounding feet only somewhat muffled by the grassy field. He turned his head and spotted Harry, relief flooding through his entire body.
Harry Potter was not exactly short of dates, but he never found anyone that lured him in unawares. Only knowing this new strange wonderful Malfoy for two days, he wondered what the future had in store for him. It was truly a strange week.
Harry held back in the office for another few moments, composing himself before he exited the office and walked towards his Auror team, gathering Endelton, Seamus and Dean. “Right, I need you three to sort out that cabin, I trust you to do a thorough investigation. I’ll ask spell damage to assist as well, just in case they’ve left any nasty curses there. I want a full report on my desk in the morning.” He looked over to Endelton, who was nodding his head a little more eagerly than Harry could stomach. Joshua Endelton had been a part of Harry’s Auror team for about two years now, he’d aced training and he was a very competent Auror, but he was one of the most irritating Auror’s he’d ever come to know. The man really didn’t know when to shut up, his humor was inappropriate at the best of times and he was a chronic oversharer.
Over the next few hours they began talking about different music they liked, different genres - until they moved on to books they liked reading or places they enjoyed visiting. Draco was shocked to discover Potter had a great deal of travelling experience just after the War, when he’d taken some time for himself. It seemed reasonable, he wasn’t entirely sure why the Wizarding World expected Harry to just throw himself into Auror training without a second thought, but it wasn’t Draco’s business. Draco finally explained his previous relationship with Samuel, his voice shaking as he described the amount of distress he went through in that particular relationship. Harry’s sympathetic responses somehow calmed his nerves, rather than got on them as they usually did when he spoke of it.
Absentmindedly, Draco began running his hands through Harry’s hair, which earned a noise of satisfaction from Harry, who was now half asleep. Looking down at the sleepy man beside him, Draco let himself believe in the fantasy of being the person Harry loved, even if for a moment.
“Are you excited to go back to school?” she’d asked one morning, Draco had looked at her thunderously and stormed off to his ‘marble room’ as he dubbed it. Instead of shopping in Diagon Alley for his school supplies, Draco spent his entire day making new marbles.
“Really?” He asked, tightening his hold on Draco’s waist. Draco narrowed his eyes, feeling his cheeks flush. “Yes,” He squeaked, ducking his head down. Harry put his hand under Draco’s chin and tilted his head up towards him, grin still plastered on his face.
to budge.
Draco rolled his eyes, a naughty smile on his face. “No, it’s not dick, though I wouldn’t mind spying one of those if I’m honest,” he said, trying to gauge Potter’s reaction. The dark haired wizard raised a challenging eyebrow, shifting a little closer to Draco.
Draco, love. I think I have to go. Mils just said that one of the criminal gang have given her information about a possible delivery of a dozen Horntail eggs. They are concealed within a delivery of harmless potion supplies. We have to check it out now and find out if we have truly fooled the smugglers.
“Aye, I’ll go tell Dean.” Seamus looked worried, but Harry had no time to ask.
you like puzzles, Malfoy?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Prat.”
. “What about me?” Potter asked, frowning at Draco.
“Hey Malfoy, you’re good at potions right?” Draco was almost positive by now Potter must know his ability in Potions, but his mind began to put him down, wondering why on earth Potter would take notice of what Draco was good at, or even what he did in a day.
Harry, oh Harry, I just received word from the Healers, I’m so sorry for my awful handwriting, I was writing to you and when I heard the peck at the window I bolted, I thought it was another letter from you, or worse. This is driving me absolutely
“You’re right.” the new Healer announced, nodding her head towards Jenkins. “Hmm,” he nodded, the faraway gaze in his eyes once again. Harry couldn’t help the irritation that flared. “Well, what is it?” Harry grumbled.
Harry xxx
Since returning for Eighth Year, Draco mostly spent his time alone, mulling over the failures of his life. With his friends not returning with him and only a handful of Slytherin’s left, he sat at the end of the table closest to the doors.
That Sunday, he’d decided ‘fuck it’ which was rapidly becoming his new motto. Wandering down the wet, uneven paths of London he’d come across a gift shop. Draco’s downfall was shiny objects, his eyes landing on a random ‘bargain bin’ of glass marbles. Fast forward a month later and Draco owned almost thirteen thousand marbles. Every single one different to the last, he’d even begun looking up guides on what a random Muggle in an electronics store called the ‘internet’.
“Finally, Auror Lockwood earlier today set his desk on fire, scorching the Celtic Serpent in to it before hexing a few others and fleeing the scene.”
“There you are, I called the Aurors as soon as you didn’t come home;  they let me come with since Hermione is with the -” He looked over to Draco and immediately shut his mouth.
Harry’s bedroom was definitely not as impressive. He walked in and closed the door behind him, shaking his head in response. Pulling his t-shirt over his head, he threw it down on to the floor and pulled his joggers down, stood only in his boxers. Draco blushed darkly, luckily there was very little light in his bedroom - Harry would probably not notice. Draco followed suit and threw his clothes on top of Harry’s. It felt intimate somehow, but regardless he padded over to the right side of the bed and pulled back the duvet.
Narcissa, to her credit, was just happy Draco had found something to put his time into instead of smashing vases and screaming about how life was so unfair like a petulant child.
Remember when I took you to Brighton for our first date? And we walked along the beach, hand in hand? No one knew us among the Muggles. No one commented and no one asked questions. That was when I
“I think he’s having a panic attack.” He said.
Here is an extra chapter to *hopefully* make up for my tardiness :)
He really had to stop being so
Taking his hand away, Harry frowned. He’d gotten so lost in thought he blushed, realising he’d left his hand there way longer than necessary. “So what’s on the cards tonight then?” he asked casually, clearing his throat. Draco raised an eyebrow, pondered for a moment then shrugged his shoulders. “Pizza?”
The conversation went a little stale, only rescued by the delivery of their food. It didn’t seem like he was going to get Louisa away from Weasley anytime soon, so he better get used to the feeling of unease. Picking up his knife and fork, he began to cut his sausages.
“Hi Malfoy,” Potter said, sitting down next to him. Draco’s heart began to beat a little faster as he was brought out of his trance, turning his head towards the tanned man, he let out a small smile and nodded his head. Potter, who looked shocked at this response, offered a smile in return. “What are you reading?” he asked, gesturing towards the book.
-----------------------------
Harry gathered Seamus and Dean and they congregated in the break room, once they were both inside with Harry and Draco, he locked the door and cast a silencing spell around the room. Seamus looked at him with a frown. “What’s up mate?” he asked, sitting down on the sofa near the shuttered window.
“Alright, so if that’s not Lockwood’s handwriting then who’s is it?” Harry asked, walking over to the cork board. He noted that there was a piece of parchment he’d not seen before pinned to the left hand side of the cork board, beside the picture of the crop circle. Harry frowned. “This wasn’t here before.” he mumbled, his eyes scanning the new information.
“So we’re going to follow him again, right?” Potter asked, he seemed to be studying Draco’s face rather intently, which made him feel a little uncomfortable. Clearing his throat, Draco simply shrugged. “If you want, though you don’t seem to have gotten anywhere by doing that have you?”
Seamus let out a breath and shook his head. “Murdered, but they’ve…” he trailed off, swallowing a lump in his throat. “They’ve cut…” he stammered, shaking his head again. “Merlin, you just need to see it - it’s unexplainable.”
Harry launched himself in to a full blown conversation about the Celtic Serpents with Draco, talking about what they’d learnt the previous day. The dinner settled in to a comfortable chatter, Harry picked up way too many pieces of garlic bread, dipping it into the sauce generously. Even though he had terrible table manners, Draco couldn’t help but feel satisfaction when Harry enjoyed his food. He was never allowed to cook in the Manor, he was never taught. He found it therapeutic to learn, then he realised he thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a little like potions, you could alter it slightly to make it better, but if you did too much it would end up bad. He’d even started creating his own recipes.
Draco rolled his eyes and stared down at the menu, not catching the amusement on Potter’s face. It seemed like Potter’s favourite past time was now to watch Draco intently. It almost reminded the blond of Hogwarts, wherever he’d go in sixth year the oaf would be somewhere nearby. “Why don’t you take a picture, Potter,” Draco said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. Potter raised an eyebrow. “It’ll last longer.” he said, his eyes rising to meet the brightest, deepest emerald.
Hey guys, here I am with another chapter. Sorry it's a little late. I hope you enjoy it. This one is more relationship development, but there is a nice little case element too.
And Draco, you cannot imagine the effect that your letter has had on me. If you could only see me, you’d laugh, you truly would. You’ve unmanned me, love. I’m in absolute
too long Draco. Right now, I’m not even sure that the
“What are you doing here?” asked Draco as he exited his Mercedes, he wasn’t even sure how Potter knew where he lived. If he had to hazard a guess he’d say Louisa, the sneaky bitch. Potter shrugged his shoulders casually and walked forwards, passing the pizza box towards Draco.
Draco’s cheeks pinked as he recalled the day he walked into the bathroom whilst Harry was showering. He’d needed the toilet badly, after running down the street for two of Harry’s favourite Scotch Pies from the corner shop, he’d entered the flat so quickly, thrown the pies on the counter and ran straight to the toilet.
“Everything okay?” Draco asked, a frown on his face. He’d been staring at Harry for the better part of fifteen minutes. He wasn’t usually able to stare at the other man interrupted but on this occasion he wondered if Harry would ever come out of his daydream. Biting his lower lip, his words did nothing for Harry’s current state. He repeated himself again, but still no joy.
“Auror Lockwood.” Dean sighed, averting his eyes. Kingsley smoothed his hand over a piece of parchment neatly placed in the center of his desk and let out a breath. “Auror Lockwood set fire to his desk, then hit three other Auror’s with an unknown curse, before fleeing the scene.” Kingsley bit out, he looked frustrated and not his usual composed self, which made Harry a little nervous.
