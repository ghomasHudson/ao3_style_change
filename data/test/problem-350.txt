With that, Potter's fangs hit their mark, sinking into Draco's flesh with one stinging bite as his cock rammed home.
She was gone.
Draco couldn't tear his eyes from the head of Potter's cock, disappearing and reappearing in the loose circle of his hand. Moisture gleamed at the tip, reflecting in the low light against the ruddy redness of his flesh. His brain misfired on all counts, and his words lacked their usual teasing bite as he laughed hoarsely, "That's a terrible line. I can't imagine how many times you've used that."
Draco is frozen in place. "That's—that's my mother."
“I guess that’s just as well,” Draco said with an air, running a hand through his hair. “You were always crap at potions. Perhaps I can owl McGonagall and see if I can use an old classroom or something.”
Once they've gone a few steps, Draco somehow reverses the hold Harry has on his arm, and is now the one doing the tugging. He drags Harry off into a shadowed back alcove and shoves him against the wall. Draco's mouth is on his before he can get a word out.
His own door slams shut with a bang.
Draco struggled to his feet to meet Potter's face. The cuts and contusions he suffered at Silvestri's hands smoothed and evened out right before Draco's surprised eyes. Before he could manage a word, Potter's arms pulled him into a tight embrace, and the familiar pull of Apparition took over.
Draco is grace personified as he lowers himself to kneel. He assumes the waiting position, and if he is surprised by the charm, his face doesn't show it. He maintains eye contact with Harry, but his breathing has picked up a touch, making his chest rise and fall in a sharper rhythm.
Ron slumped down into his chair on a huffed breath. “He-he just needs some time, that’s all. Just give him some more time to adjust-he’ll come round,” Ron’s voice choked on a sob. “He will.”
Draco slipped on the long overcoat as he came down the stairs to meet Potter in the living room. He stopped short as Potter's eyes widened. "What?"
Harry turns back to Draco, who is smiling like this is the best thing he's ever seen. "Would you mind?" he says, jerking his head to the door.
Suddenly, the canopy makes sense and he remembers Narcissa and Draco. He's late for breakfast.
Potter was pale and shaken as his eyes darted over the purpling marks on his skin. Draco reached for him, only sparing a glance at what Potter couldn't tear his eyes from.
Harry feels part of his face go slack. Draco's words are implying something, yet Harry can't fathom what he's hearing. "Wh—what are you saying?"
"You have lovely hands," he says on a rumbling drawl. "They're like the rest of you. Distinguished. Beautiful." He meets Draco's eyes. "I want to see you wrap them around your cock. I want to see what they look like when you pleasure yourself." Draco swallows and Harry can see tiny beads of sweat that have cropped up at his hairline. "Touch yourself for me. Show me the pleasure your body has to offer."
Ron snorted. "If they don't kill each other, you mean. In the beginning, neither of them wanted this. And now…" His voice trailed.
She knows the words are bold, and she says them with confidence. After all, she wears boldness and confidence like a mantle, but she feels them now not because she has to be, but because she wants to.
"What are you talking about?"
He jerked his ankles forward, shoving their cocks together, keeping his gaze firmly fixed on Draco's defiant eyes. "I'm not."
"If you manage to come back again, I think it just might happen." She thinks it might be the light howl to the wind, but suddenly her ears are buzzing, like the air is whooshing around them in a fury. But the snowflakes still fall softly, and the tree branches in the distance are barely swaying.
"I'm sorry, Father," he whispered. "I'm sorry I could never be the perfect son you expected. I'm sorry that I could never live up to what you wanted from me. I suppose if you knew the reason why I could never be that man, then you would understand why I failed so miserably at every turn. I guess if you had that probably would have killed you long before Azkaban ever could." He exhaled, breathing out the weight of his admission into the stale air of the crypt. "I had long given up on trying to make you proud of me. All I ever wanted was to be loved for what I was, not for what you thought I should be. I hope now you have found peace. Because at the end, that's all I really wanted for you."
Potter's smile emerged. "I did all the heavy lifting, and Hermione and Minerva consulted. And there was one other person that I couldn't have done without." Potter's eyes moved past Draco to the portrait. "You can come out now," he called.
A smile tugged at the corner of Snape's mouth. "Good for you."
Potter sat up and leaned forward, bracing his hands on his knees, continuing his scrutiny. Draco’s spine stiffened as Potter stood, gliding toward him on silent feet, that frank appraisal taking him in from all sides as Potter circled him like a bird of prey. He felt a pointed gaze at the back of his neck, but remained still, even as Potter’s head got closer, tickling the back of his neck with breath that was surely far too warm for the undead. As he came around front, their eyes locked and Draco swallowed hard, not missing the way Potter’s eyes snapped to the movement and remained there, mesmerized by the unconscious gesture.
"I don't really give two shits about what you think," Potter said, shaking his head.
He sags against Harry, but his lips move against Harry's at a frenetic pace, as if he's pouring everything he is into the kiss. It's open-mouthed, with too much tongue and never enough heat. It's wet, gorgeous, and filthy-sweet—just the way Harry wants him.
He threads his fingers through his hair, working it into a rich lather. The scent is permeating through the steam and he's dizzy with it, almost reeling from the potency. It hits him right in the groin and Draco realizes he's hard. Extremely hard.
He can't feel his arm. All he can do is watch as it descends over and over and over again, wrenching lustful sobs from Draco's lungs. But it sounds like angel song. Joyous and rhythmic, with all the glory of the divine. That's what he hears, but Harry knows it's not real. It's not for him. Because how can a man drenched in so much blood ever be clean? How can a man who delights in the submission of others ever be worthy of it? How can this ever be normal?
Something in his tone gets Draco's attention because his eyes snap to Harry's, heated and full of interest. His lips curl, and it makes the tightness in Harry's groin unravel and snake through to his spine.
Harry stands, careful to keep his chest from colliding with Draco's skin.
When the door shuts, Harry sucks in a harsh breath and adjusts the erection that's been insistent in his jeans.
Potter stopped outside the door to the study and looked expectantly at Draco. "Go on. Go inside."
"Wh—where are you going?"
Draco closed his eyes and turned his face into the pillow, trying to squelch down the sting he shouldn’t feel from words he wanted to believe. But deep down, he knew it was futile.
This time it is she who laughs. "I find it amusing that you still posture." Her hands relax and she breathes out to continue, "There is no one here to properly cower before you. No one to shiver at your great arrogance and delusions of power. There are no whores here to impress into our bed." She clucks at him, "How the mighty have fallen."
“Because you’re afraid
Draco gasps for air, his chest is rising and falling like a bellows, his heart is racing, and his pulse is pounding in his ears. Potter continues his merciless assault, mapping out every line, dip, and hollow he can get his mouth and hands on. Touches and teases come from everywhere and Draco can’t wrap his head around exactly what’s happening. The need to touch Potter is fierce, so Draco bats Potter’s hand away and replaces it with his own, circling his fingers around Potter’s dripping erection. Potter grunts like the sound has been punched from his lungs, a short, deep exhalation that makes his pupils blow wide. Potter throws his head back and Draco attacks his neck, memorizing the taste of Potter’s skin on his tongue. He bites at the juncture of neck and shoulder, teeth pressing in a way that’s sure to leave a mark. His tongue laves over the bite, soothing it before sucking again. This must flip a switch somewhere within Potter because he comes absolutely unglued, and Draco realizes two things about Potter he’s never known before.
Draco is dressed impeccably in a crisp, emerald green button-down and black bespoke trousers. No fraying hems to be seen. It makes him wonder about the trousers from before. Draco has money, there's no denying that fact, so it's a curious thing for him to be lounging about in clothes long past their prime. If he knows Draco, and Harry's beginning to think he really does, he's certain there's some sort of self-flagellation involved. Draco is a martyr to his guilt. Blaise Zabini is the glaring proof.
Draco laughed in spite of himself. “Yes, I can see how that would put a damper on one’s political machinations. And you’re not married, either. That was unexpected. Merlin knows the appropriately-fawning Ginevra Weasley wouldn’t have looked out of place on your arm at Ministry galas. I would have thought by now you would be up to your ears in domesticated bliss with a passel of ginger-haired Potter spawn running around.”
“Go on. Bedroom.”
“Do women turn you on?” he asked lightly.
Potter’s grin is predatory. “Probably.”
"Yes, Harry."
The denigration in the way Zabini looks at Draco when he speaks undoes the last of Harry's resolve. He feels Draco's slight stiffening and without looking at him, Harry knows that even though the mask hasn't cracked, a gentle flush has crept into Draco's cheeks, betraying his supposed shame to Zabini's sadistic delight.
"Thank you," she said breathlessly, stepping through. "I've brought some final paperwork for you to sign." She set the folder on the table and sat down on the sofa. "Just a few more signatures and then you'll be open for business." Her smile was warm and soft as she patted the cushion next to her.
"I did tell you we aren't as formal as we used to be."
“Harry?” Molly asked softly. “Can I cut you a piece?”
Suddenly, Bill was shoved unceremoniously to the side and Draco found himself staring face-to-face with the last Weasley he wanted to see. George Weasley glowered down at him. “I suppose you think you can walk in here like nothing’s happened?”
It sounds too good to be true, but knowing Potter, he’s too Gryffindor to go back on his word once he’s given it, so it should check out. Honestly, he’s been planning to return to England, especially now he’s gotten his Mastery. The Manor has been empty for far too long, and despite a string of sexually creative Frenchmen in his bed, Draco intensely dislikes the French.
Harry stood his ground and said with resignation, "I'm not doing this with you, Silvestri. I warned you what would happen if you touched him."
A red haze filters over Harry's vision, and he tamps down the anger, careful to keep himself composed. He's got control over his emotions, but somehow the fiery storm in his blood freezes, and his words spill out into the room, cold as ice.
Harry shrugs. He hasn't thought that far ahead, but thinking about it now, an idea springs to mind. "You remember last summer when I went to Spain?" Ron nods. "Well, I spent quite a bit of time there at some of the local galleries. I've painted a fair bit in my off time, and I really enjoyed it. Maybe that's what I'll do."
Harry's lips curve into a smile as he stands. "'Master Dragon'?"
"Completely. I am yours." Draco's eyes cut into his so fiercely, Harry has to clench his fists to keep from dragging Draco to his chest. "So bind me. Bleed me. Or break me."
"Still watching out for me?" Draco smirked.
"And there's been no trouble with that? No backlash? Other than the three weeks of patiently waiting?" Even though so far the Ministry had kept up with their end of the deal when he became Potter's consort, he wouldn't put it past them to put up a fight for the minutest of reasons.
Blinky giggles and slips her hand into his. "Anything for Master Harry."
The Cushioning charm catches Draco as he collapses to the side, body twitching with tiny aftershocks. Harry snaps into action with a wandless Accio, and a fluffy white towel flies into his hand. He Vanishes the mess on the floor and hits Draco with a quick Scourgify.
Adjustment made, they come together, skin on skin as Potter bears him down to the mattress. Potter hitches Draco’s left leg high up on his hip, slotting their cocks together on a rough sigh. Draco hooks his ankle around Potter’s waist and keens as Potter takes them both in hand and strokes hard, thumbing through the wetness of Draco’s leaking tip. He’s embarrassed at the high pitch and neediness to his voice, but Potter merely huffs and latches onto one of Draco’s nipples, biting and suckling at the taut peak.
Harry finds Malfoy's irritation amusing. It's given his cheeks some color and a resounding flash of life to his eyes. The effect is utterly charming. On a whim, he leans in, getting dangerously close to Malfoy's annoyed face. "Is it because you're all fire and bite?" he teases.
Draco’s free hand came up to push at Potter’s face and neck, trying desperately to find purchase. Potter snapped at his fingers, slicing the tips of Draco’s fingers. He hissed at the sting, and even the taste of Draco’s blood on his lips didn’t seem to spark any recognition. Potter was gone. This was the vampire, the thing he kept buried, the creature that only came out when Potter was too weak to hold it back.
Traces of the old Hermione ventured forth as she tsked him. “Honestly, didn’t we take the same classes at Hogwarts?” His eyes snapped up to her at the chiding comment. “A Consort means you are magically bound to this person, that you may only feed from them, and them alone. You will cohabitate, as the bond necessitates proximity. Basically, you’ll be married in the eyes of the law, and the only one you can legally feed from is your Consort.”
Draco followed her movement, turning his own moue of displeasure on the vampire. “And why the hell not?” True, the thought of being surrounded by Weasleys had once been unthinkable, but given the situation, it might be in his best interest to play nice. And the fact that Potter was so adamant about not going only increased Draco’s desire to do so.
Draco shifts on his feet as Harry comes closer. It's the first time he's been able to articulate the word without a sneer or derision. Harry looks him over with a critical eye, silent and observant. Draco's telling the truth. Harry feels Draco's breath on his cheek, coming in short, soft pants. His eyes are wide and entreating, practically begging. For what, Harry's not sure. It's hard to tell over the clamoring in his own heart.
His grip on the quill tightened, and he heard a small cracking sound. He looked down at his hand and dropped the quill. "Yes," he said slowly, "you're right. Besides, if I calm down, I can make killing him quite satisfactory."
Narcissa pushes her chair back and rises to her feet, slow and graceful as always. "Well," she says on a sigh, "since we're all feeling so wonderful, I thought we might celebrate."
"Of course, Mother. Harry's comfort is our foremost priority."
Harry's eyes snap to Draco's face at that. "Show me."
Draco's fist stutters as he fucks through it, panting and gasping as thick, white ropes of come spurt out between his fingers and splatter on the floor. The sight of him is filthy and gorgeous, sweaty and debauched, and Harry feels a distinct sense of pride as his name falls from Draco's lips in a half-garbled utterance.
Ron’s eyes went wide and excited at his sister’s name, and he grinned. “Oh, mate, you missed it.”
Neville looks down at her, and this time she's certain. Certain that the interest she sees in his eyes goes beyond what should be considered appropriate. She can feel him beginning to speak even before he does, because the deep intonation hits her chest before his words hit her ears.
Potter’s perusal continued for another second before he let his head fall back and swore softly.
Draco shifts slightly on his feet before answering, "I do not wish to be injured, Sir."
"Please," he said, "let me deal with Potter in my own way."
"I could make you come like this, couldn't I? I could eat you from the inside out and have your cock explode without a single touch." Harry lets his voice drop low, rumbling across Draco's skin. "I could spend hours here, stretching you out, fucking your sweet little hole with my tongue, making you beg for release." Draco's gasping in short, breathy whuffs. "Would you beg for me, Draco? Would you beg for my tongue in your arse?"
Harry’s shoulders slumped, the thought of rage was just so tiring. “I don’t see how you can feel that way. What kind of friend, what kind of brother am I, that would do that?” He turned his head away. “It’s this thing,” he spat. “It’s made me into a monster.”
"Exactly," Harry nods. "There's more to us than an intense physical draw. There are light moments. Fun moments. Even when the physical is burning in the background." He steps closer and reaches for Draco's hand. "It's the whole package, Draco. This is the building of a relationship. Not just sex. I want you to know that." His thumb strokes over Draco's skin, soaking in the feel. "I want to show you. I want you to believe it."
Abuse is not in my nature. I will never do anything that is designed to injure you, humiliate you, or degrade you. Submission is a gift. One that I do not take lightly. Now get your things and go back to your room. We can discuss this at another time."
Draco hooked his heels around the backs of Potter’s knees, drawing them closer. “Shh,” he whispered. “I’ve got you.” Potter’s needy whine vibrated through his chest and Draco swore he could feel it stabbing straight into his heart. His mouth found Potter’s ear to murmur soft words of comfort and encouragement, as he brought Potter closer to the edge.
“If you please, Malfoy.”
He looked down to see his cock, rock hard and leaking, staring Potter straight in the face.
Ron instantly stepped back and let him go. “Yeah, right.” He turned to Potter with a sheepish grin, and ran a hand through his hair. “Sorry, Harry. Forgot myself for a second.” He glanced back at Draco. “See you inside, Malfoy?”
Draco doesn't open his eyes, but breathes out shakily through his mouth. His voice is rough, but this time it's the right kind of broken.
"Suck my cock, Harry."
Draco seated himself at the far end. "You shouldn't be here," he said to Potter. The tone was crisp, and Draco wasn't even sure if he meant it or not.
"Speaking of which, we should get started." Neville sets his napkin on the table and pushes his chair back. He reaches for Narcissa's hand to assist her in rising. "Shall we?"
Harry shakes his head and smiles as he stands, placing himself directly in front of Draco. He feels the heat from Draco's body, gets a nose full of his aftershave. Draco swallows, but stands his ground.
"To bed," Harry answers, not looking back. "Blinky?" he calls, and the house-elf pops in.
OOOOO
"Say it."
“Molly Weasley’s is the best.”
It should have still been creepy, but the answering flush at knowing that Potter noticed he was naked and stuck around anyway was sort of hot. And that was confusing and strange in a way he didn’t want to think about, certainly not after the vigorous shower escapade from last night. Parts of him were still happily sore. Draco frowned and stabbed at the door. “Out, Potter. Your friend is waiting.”
Draco leaves Ron gaping after him, and Harry runs a hand over his face in consternation. Really, it could have been so much worse.
He can't wait any longer; Draco's lips are red and ripe for kissing, and he takes them because they are his. Draco's soft gasp against his mouth is perfect, and Harry's hands pull him closer until their bodies are pressed together. Draco's warmth seeps through Harry's clothes, adding fuel to the fire that is already burning within him. He's covered in paint—it must be smearing all over Draco with the way he's writhing in Harry's arms, but Harry doesn't care because the pungent scent of acrylic is mixing with the sharp lemony fragrance that is Draco's alone, and it's tipping Harry over the edge.
Harry thinks he could have poked her and knocked her over. Wide eyes and a small gasp reveal her surprise.
"Mindless sex." Draco waves a dismissive hand in the air. "More of the same I experienced with Blaise. Ruthless Doms, violent ones. Some Muggle drugs. Potions, too. Those four months after my return are a bit of a blur. But I realized I needed help, so I went to a Mind Healer. Very discreet. Ravenclaw. It was very therapeutic. I learned a lot about myself. And I vowed never to get into a situation like that again." He stops and shoots Harry a sad smile. "If only for Mother's sake."
"My what?" Draco blinked in surprise.
Harry chuckles and shakes his head, "Not so decent as you might think. I've done my fair share of terrible things."
Ron’s head swiveled to Silvestri, but he said nothing.
The smile works its way across Malfoy's lips with some effort, but ultimately Malfoy can't hold it back. "Two weeks!" he exclaims. "I subsisted on stolen apples and pilfered Brie from my own fucking larder whilst trying to avoid shitting my mother's rugs with every step." He's laughing now, and the sound is infectious.
"Oh, fuck me. I'm dead." Ron buries his face in his hands.
Draco swore under his breath and knocked on the door. It opened seconds later and Arthur Weasley’s face broke into a bright smile. “Harry, Draco! So glad you’re here!” He stepped aside and held open the door. “Come in, come in! Molly’s been climbing the walls waiting for you.”
Draco breathes out long and slow.
He stood, feeling emotion swirling in pit of his stomach. "No," he said firmly. "You're not worried. You're afraid."
"Go on, Draco. Pick your poison."
"Your assistance is neither expected, nor required. In the future, refrain altogether. I can handle my own affairs." Draco's voice was clipped and cold, matching the layers of ice forming around his heart. "Hermione wanted me to remind you of the celebration next week at the Weasley's. Once the business is up and running. You're to come along."
"I'll get as close as you'll let me."
Potter's hand dropped from his cock and he approached the bed, climbing in with a slow, controlled crawl. He'd never looked more dangerous. With his messy hair, lust-darkened eyes, and the rangy tension of an apex predator looking to toy with its prey, Potter loomed over him, forcing Draco down to the pillows.
Draco walks to the table, stopping short of the edge, waiting for his next instructions. Harry steps up behind him and presses his chest to Draco's back. Draco sucks in a breath as they make contact, and Harry buries his face in the back of Draco's neck, breathing him in. His skin is warm, soft, and fragrant. He smells like lavender and lemon, with a hint of black tea buried beneath. Harry's hips edge closer, pushing his erection into the swell of Draco's naked arse.
Draco crouched in front of him, lifted his chin, and kissed him hard, bruising and cruel. Potter whimpered, whispery and broken, and the sound sludged through Draco's veins like lead, oozing into the dark and empty space in his heart that somehow had always belonged to Potter. He pulled back with a jerk, firm in his resolve, even though it weighed heavy on his tongue, more bitter than sweet, chalky and scorched like ash in his mouth.
Two fingers became three and Draco thought he would lose what was left of his mind. Potter moved faster now, both with his cock and his hand, and the brief moment of gentleness was gone. He was finger-fucking him now with abandon, and Draco’s arms fell away to brace on the tile once more as he succumbed.
Narcissa and Draco gasp again as the extra chairs lining the table start disappearing one by one with a succession of audible pops. Once gone, a shudder of magic ripples over the table and it begins to shrink down toward Narcissa and Draco at the other end, stopping when it reaches a much smaller size. Only one extra chair remains, and it's opposite Draco, yet the table looks as if it can seat six comfortably. Harry's not at all surprised when his chair starts sliding across the floor toward the table. When Harry's flush, staring much closer at Narcissa and Draco's faces (hers amused, his slightly appalled), Blinky pops in with his breakfast.
“Treacle tart,” she proclaimed, “Harry’s favorite.”
“Stay.” The rough-hewn voice was sleepy, a command bordering on the edge of a plea.
"Potter, I—"
"That's none of your concern."
It’s with a heavy sigh of resignation that he says to Potter, “You’re going to be up my arse until this is all over, aren’t you?”
"Parachute, Sir."
"You didn't identify him to Voldemort when you could have. Harry told me. You had your chance and didn't take it."
Blaise Zabini is a study in
And that was all the invitation Potter needed.
"Why do I not know about this?" Ron says, deflated.
Potter's eyes were guarded, his lips swollen and slick. He was delectable.
." Malfoy rolls his eyes at that, but now Harry can see the smile. Malfoy's
The stare is discomforting after a second or two, Harry knows, because he's perfected it, and finally Malfoy concedes.
He pads to the door, bare feet slapping lightly on the floor. When he opens it, Draco is there, looking freshly showered and remarkably calm.
Malfoy's gaze is piercing on his back as Harry makes his lap around the room, and he picks up on the silent seething that's being directed his way. He knows Malfoy has changed, can see that in so many other ways, but right now the clock is ticking.
“Well, how about I talk to you about Draco, then?” she continued, not missing a beat. Her voice lowered and she hissed, “You should be ashamed of yourself, Harry Potter.”
“What? Would I die for you?” Harry asked.
Harry snorted out a rough breath, watching the light in Draco's eyes fade. He should stop now, he knew that. Stop now, and keep to his course. But Draco's hair was ruffled, his lips were swollen and slick, and Harry was a complete bastard.
Draco merely has to ask for it.
Draco's eyes narrowed. "Not a word, Severus."
He feels a little like a shark as he approaches—shiny gray suit and cunning smile that's all teeth and deadly confidence. He knows he's slick as fuck when he sidles up to Draco and slides an arm around Draco's waist like there's a waiting space shaped just like Harry's arm.
"Yes?"
The question is unexpected.
His heart pounded in his ears, but inside, he felt strangely calm. Not distanced, certainly not, because his body thrummed with desire just as much as Potter’s, but it seemed as the though the serenity stemmed from a place far beyond himself. He wondered how much of it was a consequence of the bond or, a more disturbing option, if it was his own desire to see Potter whole. Because Potter was breaking apart on top of him with ragged cries and jerky movements that suggested he was coherent of nothing but the blind sensation passing through his body. It was an awkward angle, Potter was heavier than the dickens, and his wrist was beginning to cramp something awful. It didn’t matter. It was perfect. Draco worked him harder, loving the feel of having Potter in his hand at last, in a way that was so different from ages before.
“Very well,” Draco supplied. “Arthur, it is.” He held out a slightly shaky hand, which Arthur took without the slightest reservation. They shook warmly and he ushered Draco further inside.
Draco's eyebrows shoot up and he stares at Harry in wordless surprise as his fingers slide through the evidence of his orgasm. Draco's fingers curl to cup him gently, and he allows it.
Draco closed the gap between them, noting Potter's subtle intake of breath. "And what do you want? I mean, you've made all sorts of concessions for me and my future, but what about yours?"
"Draco," Harry parrots, a tiny smile tugging at the edge of his lips.
"But it's
“Don’t worry about him,” Potter said.
"Muggle clothes," she blurts out, unable to resist the sparkle of mirth she sees. "Jeans, specifically." She thinks she should be horrified at her own outburst, but Neville chuckles, and the low rumble entreats her traitorous mouth to continue. "And I have a pair of 'flip-flops', I think they're called. They have horrendous little sparkly things all over them." She wrinkles her nose and then smiles. "I absolutely adore them. I think if Draco ever saw them, he'd die of apoplexy."
*drops chapter and runs to hide* Comments? Please?
Ron sags against the sofa, exhaling sharply. "Thanks, mate."
Neville laughs, "I can imagine."
"Oh, that's wonderful, Harry. But there's no need to rush yourself into anything. Take some time to rest, as well. In fact, I think the two of you should have a good, old-fashioned lie-in today."
"Is that—is that a tattoo?"
His mother offers a delicate shrug and takes another sip of her tea. "Perhaps we have something to offer Mr. Potter, and perhaps he has something to offer the Manor in return. Who can say? It doesn't change the fact that he is here—" And this is where something turns over inside Harry's chest, spreading out an unexpected warmth that travels down his spine to his toes, "—and by his own admission, is in need." She sets the cup on the cart and folds her hands in her lap, linking her fingers together. "I think you should stay, Mr. Potter."
Draco's gaze passes over Harry, causing a small smile to tug at his lips. "I did. Had a bit of a lie-in and a long, hot shower."
Draco sounds wistful and tired, like a man who's resigned himself to a certain point of fact.
When Harry looks back, Narcissa is gliding out of the room, a shy smile fixed upon her upturned lips.
The smile on Potter’s face falters briefly and he nods again in quick succession with a ‘yeah’ and a ‘sure’ before some of the brightness in his eyes fades. It’s all platitudes now—he’ll be missed (he won’t), he should keep in touch (he shouldn’t), and he hopes it all goes well for him (that seems to be sincere), but he’s really here for one thing, he says.
Harry shakes his head. "They're not the same, not at all. You need to understand that I may have control, Draco, but only you have the power to let me wield it. It will always be yours, because it is your choice. You choose to bestow your gift. Or take it away. Because a Dom without a sub is nothing."
“I seem to remember not so long ago when these halls were roamed by Dementors, meting out justice with a Kiss for crimes committed. He must be stopped,” Silverstri said with finality. “This is the only way to ensure his compliance.”
His eyes focused on her neck again. “You should be.” He swallowed hard, and for a second, something like regret flickered in his eyes. But a warning hunger took its place and he rasped, “You need to leave.”
"I rather am, aren't I?" He signed off on the last line, knowing there was little to be done about it now, and handed the folder back to Hermione. "Thank you again for putting all this together. I wouldn't be here without you."
“It’s a terrible thing,” Shacklebolt supplied, “this business. And as fond as I am of Harry, and as much I appreciate the sacrifices he made for the Wizarding world, I have to think about the greater good here.”
"Thank you." It's inadequate, but it's heartfelt.
Molly’s lips twitched. “That’s exactly what she said.” Her hand dipped beneath the table and reappeared with a small, cream colored envelope. She laid it on the table as she fixed Draco with her gaze. “We both lost sons, your mother and I. And she lost a husband as well. No matter what I think about Lucius Malfoy, she loved him. Deeply, as much as I love my Arthur. His loss was great. She wanted me to give you this upon your release. I have a feeling she had this planned for quite some time.” Molly’s eyes softened as she smiled. “I gained a new respect for your mother in those teatime hours. And for you as well, Draco.” She slid the envelope across the table. “I don’t know what’s in there, but I’m pretty sure I can guess. There’s a large tree in the back left corner of the yard,” Molly gestured with a finger over her shoulder. “Ginny charmed fairy lights on it ages ago, and the damned things don’t ever shut off. I think it would be a good place for you to read that.”
Harry inclined his head to the letter. "NEWTs?"
The moment Draco realizes he’s naked, Potter grabs his hips again, leading him to the bed. When he hits the edge, Potter puts a firm hand on his shoulder, pushing him to sit. From there, Draco is treated to the sight of Potter stripping himself with ruthless precision. Potter is gorgeous, but naked Potter is breathtaking. If he thought Potter’s cock was thick when they pressed together before, he is totally thrown by the actual size that is straining toward him. Potter slides his hands underneath to grope Draco’s arse and position him further up the bed.
"Yes."
"It is. I'm not suddenly cured or anything, I've still got a lot of work to do, but I'm getting there," the vampire said. "She believes I am suffering from something called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Apparently, it's quite common in soldiers and victims of war. I was both, I guess." Potter's eyes softened and he sighed. "You were right about the guilt. I did want to die. I didn't feel like I deserved to live, not after losing so many people I love. Survivor's guilt, is what Dr. Marbury says. And then you add the insult of practical immortality onto a man who wants to die, and well, you can see how well I coped with all of that."
He took a moment to look over Potter. He was dressed in his usual muggle wear. A pair of well-worn denims ripped out at the knees, a pair of scuffed trainers, and a faded t-shirt proclaiming something called ‘Van Halen’.
Potter stepped closer into Draco’s personal space, and his demeanor went from tense to relaxed. “What would I need that for?” he said smoothly. “It’s your job to keep me warm.”
Draco is naked in seconds, his clothes neatly folded in a pile on the small table, and Harry has to stop a smile from spreading across his face at Draco's eagerness.
Harry turns from Draco and divests himself of his shirt, socks, and shoes, tossing them to the side, before walking over to the frame. "Come here," he says, holding out a hand.
Potter bites at the nape of his neck. “Probably.”
Harry's going to enjoy teaching him. Because Draco is worth so much more than flogging and rough play. He deserves more than a steely hand and an iron-willed Dom.
Draco glances away for a second and swipes a thumb through some paint on his thigh. He smears it across his torso.
"Not going to happen."
The final nail in Gilles’ coffin is the fact that he enjoys spending Draco’s money far too much. He’s always been generous with his lovers, he can afford to be, but he’s far too young and far too attached to his galleons to be someone’s sugar daddy. So for that, the death knell on this relationship is sounding.
"On your knees, Draco."
He threw himself into Molly's waiting arms and wept like a child.
“Please, Harry,” she pleaded. “I’ve come to discuss terms.”
Harry is seething on the inside, but takes great care to measure his words. They come out slowly, with a gravity that seems to press Draco into the floor. "Let's get one thing straight right now. I am not Blaise. I will never strike you out of anger.
"I—I didn't know I was supposed to—I mean, I've never—
He spoke with the indication that the simple phrase should be clear enough, and offered no gesture or other explanation to the contrary.
He didn't give Potter time to finish twitching before he pushed him off, but not away. Potter's lips were slick and red, eyes high and bright with the aftermath of both the feed and the orgasm. The vampire leaned in, perhaps for a kiss, but Draco denied him, reclining his head. He lifted his messy hand and swiped at his neck, pulling it back to consider the glob of fluids. The light in Potter's eyes died as Draco's face set into a steely mask of disdain.
She opens the door and steps inside, leaving it cracked behind her. A wandless wave of her hand lights the room, and soon it is bright enough to venture inside.
Harry laughs along with him. "You know what I mean. Running off just to arse your father can't possibly compete with the idiocy attributed to Lucius Malfoy."
“I am here, you know, Weasley. And I don’t think Potter likes your tone,” Draco said lightly.
“Mr. Weasley,” Draco said smoothly as he crossed the threshold.
"I told you I was two games ago. It's not my fault if you didn't listen."
Potter bared his fangs and hissed, rushing at the frame. Snape stood his ground, not shrinking. "Predicable. When called out on his failings, the Chosen One resorts to simple bullying." He placed his hands on the wingback and leaned forward to drawl, "Now
"Lurking in corridors, are we?"
Potter blinked owlishly and his hand came up to scratch absently behind his neck. "I attended their funerals."
Draco moves with controlled precision, his eyes on the frame. He doesn't look at Harry until Harry's hand closes around his wrist and pulls him forward into the center of the frame. A ripple dances down Draco's spine on a sharp exhale.
"Two hours?" she replied. "Fashionable or no, that's not like Draco. Not now, anyway." The worry on her face seeped out into the room, coloring the air. He felt it on his tongue.
Harry leans in and savors the moist heat of Draco's breath on his cheek as he says, "I don't want to break you, Draco. I want to set you free."
“Good evening, Hermione.”
Harry smiles full of genuine pleasure. "Of course. Thank you."
Wordless. Wandless. Effortless.
to do better. And making progress, at that.
"Am I to take that as encouragement?"
Draco rises, unfurling himself from the floor with the fluidity of water tumbling over stone and does as he is told. He pulls back the carved doors, keeping his eyes downcast.
Almost.
Draco's only answer is a muffled groan as his hand speeds up.
"Say something—anything, shout at me, curse at me, I don't care! Just don't stare at me like that, I can't abide it. Please." Draco's eyes squint shut. "Please, Harry.
"Oh, Draco."
Harry rubs a hand over his face. "How did this even happen?"
Ron stands and looks him in the eye. "Fine. If that's what you want, fine." He grumbles under his breath. "Better than Owen Redfield at any rate."
Draco gasped in astonishment as his climax rocketed through him, spurred on by Potter’s sudden imperative, as if the word alone could make him come on command.
"And miss
"Which are?" Harry leans forward. Narcissa Malfoy is one smart witch, and any insight she might have might as well be coming from Hermione Granger-Weasley, he's fairly certain.
Harry shushes him. "No, there's no need for an apology. I admit I was upset at first, but you cannot be held accountable for something of which you weren't aware. But now you know." The last statement is final. "And
"Yes," he replies with same amount of softness. "It did. But it would be better if next time you meant it. I can appreciate the effort you made. I know you did it for her, and not for me."
“Yes, madame. I’m Draco.”
"Just Harry."
"I firecalled him this morning. Nev said he'd send something over."
as he whirled them around to reverse their positions, pressing Draco against the cold concrete of the cell wall. Magic buzzed around them as Potter drank, seeping into his skin, binding them together to lend permanence to the contract. There was no going back now, not ever. He was Potter’s in every sense of the word, and judging by the way Potter writhed on top of him, the vampire was determined to brand credence into the argument.
"Of what?" she asks before she can stop herself.
Was it his imagination, or was there a small waver to Potter's voice?
Weasley slips around him on silent boots and directs him left down to the end of the hall. He knocks twice and opens the door marked ‘Head Auror’ on a shiny brass plate and stands aside for Draco to enter. The door is shut unceremoniously behind him. Behind the large mahogany desk sits Robards, looking as pinched and terse as he expected. The letter contacting him had read much the same. Begrudging and hat in hand, yet displeased at having to make the overture.
"Comfortable?" Ron snorts. "The woman was laid out between us on the sofa like a damned buffet table. Like the spot was hers all along." He closes his eyes and blows out a soft breath. "Maybe it is."
It's hundreds of condescending voices, some familiar, some not. It's the judgment he knows and the repudiation he can't escape.
. He can't say anything at this point, it's all too surreal, and the day's events are catching up with him in a maelstrom of unexpected emotion. Suddenly, she's gathered him close, embracing him tightly with a whiff of jasmine and something herbaceous, and he finds himself hugging back equally as strong.
It should stick in his craw that he's hard and aching at just the command of Harry's words. He hasn't even touched himself and his cock is throbbing, begging to be touched. But it doesn't. His body is disturbingly responsive, wound tight.
, I will be the first to queue and hex his sorry arse six ways from Sunday."
"Please," Draco said, holding up a hand. "Do me the courtesy of not lying to my face. I think I've earned at least that."
She tips her glass at him. "Even decent men have a dark side. It's what keeps them honest." Pansy eyes the half-empty glass in his hand. "No champagne for you?"
It was excruciatingly tender, fraught with emotion, and utterly, completely, devastatingly wrong. With everything breaking between them, Potter had no right to force affection on him. No right to make it feel so good, like it might mean something real. Something he might have hoped for. Draco's eyes scrunched closed, halting the trek of the salty moisture that had gathered. He bit down on his lip to stifle the moan stalled in his throat as Potter's hands slid between them. The vampire's mouth latched onto the bite mark, covering it with his lips as his tongue danced over it, while his hands went for Draco's fly. In seconds, Potter had both their cocks out, eager and straining, trapped in the confines of his fist.
00000
Draco freezes.
"Circe's tits, Draco, you look like shit. You're not sleeping, are you?"
Harry nods in assent. "I'll do it after breakfast. What time?"
Harry pulls back, panting, and presses his forehead to Draco's in an effort to get his breathing evened out. His chest feels like a bellows, and the rapid rise and fall won't do at all. Draco's set him on fire—it's never been this way with anyone, ever—and Harry needs to get himself under control. Especially if they're going to play like Draco wants.
The air was thick with the scent of sweat and sex, and Draco swore he could detect the faint undertones of his own capitulation in the air. Potter snuffled beside him, but he couldn’t bring himself to look back. “What were you dreaming about?” Potter said nothing, and Draco was almost resigned to the fact that Potter wasn’t going to say anything, when he did.
Ron has the decency to shoot his eyes to the floor and murmur, "Yeah, I get it now."
"Wh—what?" Ron splutters. "How do you—what, you know Hermione now?"
She bopped him in the arm for good measure. "Oh, just sign already."
It was hard and hot in his hand, and the fact that it was attached to Potter made it all the more perfect. He stroked once firmly, bringing his hand down the shaft to swipe the pad of his thumb across the damp head. Potter bucked against him as if struck by lightning, and whimpered brokenly into the bite. The hand around his left wrist opened and Potter’s palm slid into his, tangling their fingers together. Draco closed his eyes and tightened the hold, gasping as Potter’s forearm came to lay flat against the Dark Mark. He hissed, not from any sensation from the mark itself (that had long been done away with), but of what the melding of their skin represented.
"I thought you were done with your paperwork."
"I do, you know," he said softly. "Love you, that is." Potter reached into his back pocket and produced a small velvet-covered box. "Which is why I would like for you to come home with me. Permanently."
Harry and Pansy nod in unison. "Yes."
Harry reels back at the vehemence that rolls off Draco. His hands are clenched around the edge of the table so hard, they've gone white, and Draco's shoulders are trembling under the force. He's holding back so much, trying so hard to keep his cool, and losing it slowly by precious seconds. He lashes out to ease the growing pressure within, keeping himself at a set simmer in order to prevent the whole pot from boiling over.
Draco's eyebrow rose. "Would I?"
Mrs. Malfoy gestures to the over-stuffed sofa. "Please, do sit down."
is not worth discussing."
Harry only smiles at that, because Ron's probably right. He doesn't think Draco will lie, but he certainly won't paint Ron's outburst as misguided loyalty, either.
Zabini is poised, fit, and commanding. Harry knows immediately by the set of his jaw and the line of his shoulders that the Italian is a special kind of dangerous. He's a man who enjoys being cruel for the sake of the twisted pleasure that cruelty alone can provide. He is incapable of remorse and regrets nothing. He's an arsehole of the highest caliber.
"Altercation?" Harry's voice dropped. "What kind of altercation?"
“Draco, Draco, Draco.” Potter whispered the litany of his name against his open mouth like a choir of avenging angels, their blades black with the blood of his soul. “I’ll be damned forever with the taste of you on my lips.”
“Ron,” Potter said, his voice clipped.
They make it back to the bedroom and Harry steers him toward the bed. It takes no effort to get Draco under the sheets, naked, soft, and clean. He's asleep before his head even hits the pillow. Harry drops the towel in his hands and heads back over to the sofa. He stretches out, keeping his gaze on Draco's sleeping form.
And this is what Harry gives in return.
. It really was. I mean, she stayed for a while. She didn't just get up and dressed and run out. We lounged naked on the couch for hours." He sighs. "We had more sex. The two of us. I felt closer to her than ever. And 'Mione said she felt the same way, that what happened with Pansy didn't detract from us, it made it better." He turns to Harry with mild confusion. "Is that fucked up?"
Bill smiled, though it looked more of a grimace. “Welcome home.”
Harry's cock jumps at the thought.
"Yes, Draco?"
He rankled at Potter’s statement, and wanted to snark back that he was much more than a possession, but the twinkle in Potter’s eye made it impossible to tell if he was teasing or being serious.
"Please, Harry," Draco whines. "
"Didn't he? Considering we had discussed every single aspect of this venture, I should think chucking you along for the ride would have come up at some point." Draco's irritation burned through him in waves, dredging up all his resentment and anger in one fell swoop.
Draco rolls his bottom lip between his teeth, and it is fucking delectable.
Harry cocks his head. "I didn't sneer. And I don't take liberties where none have been offered. It's
"I know it won't fix anything, that's not why I'm asking," Potter interrupted. "I love you," he insisted, pushing the box into Draco's hands. "I know it. I feel it. I
"If this is uncomfortable, use your safeword, and we'll stop now."
“Touch your collar again and I will rip those fangs out of your face and owl them to Granger as a parting gift.” Potter’s hand dropped to his side.
Harry ducks his head and laughs alongside him.
“Come on,” Potter said suddenly. “I’ve got something upstairs I want to show you.”
"It's all been cleared with the Ministry." Potter scratched at the back of his head. "You were right; no one wanted to help you. I had to raise all kinds of hell, but in the end, they agreed that even dead, Snape's expertise couldn't do you wrong. So, he's going to tutor you, you'll sit for exams, and when you pass, he'll apprentice you. It will be valid, and then you can be licensed by the Ministry for your own potions practice, or whatever you want to do. Teach, or whatnot. It'll be entirely up to you."
Draco's lips curved into a wry chuckle. "No, if she was bold enough to do that, then no, she wouldn't have cared who was watching." The image of his mother, holding onto Potter made something in his chest twist with a bittersweet ache. He shook his head, and then frowned. "Shacklebolt came? I think he hated my father even more than you."
"Simple," Harry says. "Whatever else he is, Blaise Zabini is a coward. He's not going to risk himself any more than he has to. And if it takes him a while to figure it out, fine. He certainly not going to embarrass himself by calling me out on it later. That would mean he would know that I would know that I got to him. He'll never admit that."
The second thing is: Potter has an absolutely filthy mouth. With his arms bracketing Draco’s head, he leans and whispers the dirtiest things Draco’s ever heard. It’s not normally something that does it for him, the dirty talk, but the base, crude pictures Potter keeps painting are striking a definite chord. The litany doesn’t stop, but then it turns softer, yet no less erotic. Draco’s never been sweet, and he’s certainly no boy, but when those words drip from Potter’s mouth onto his skin, something deep inside Draco
It was as if someone opened a window in Potter’s soul as Draco drummed out the beat of his heart on Potter’s skin. His gaze focused and sharpened, green eyes glittering like dark stars, bright with recognition and surprise. Potter’s brow rose and loosened the grip on Draco’s neck. He gulped in sweet lungfuls of precious air, coughing to clear his chest. He stared at Potter, afraid to speak, lest he break the fragile reprieve he’d been granted. Potter’s dumbstruck expression quickly moved to one of horror and he collapsed on top of Draco, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck.
Ron's sheepish frown takes over the whole of his face. "Alright, alright, I'm sorry, yeah?" He fidgets under Harry's stare.
"Merlin, I don't fucking know. You're the expert when it comes to shit like this." Harry cocks an eyebrow in response and Ron hedges, "You know, odd—er,
“It’s in the past,” Draco supplied.
"I don't—"
Draco whimpers, bereft. But his hand keeps going.
"Tough, because I'm going to tell you anyway." If Potter looked the tiniest bit put out at that, all the better. "Idiots, the both of you." Potter snorted in response. "I've had my fair share stumble through my classroom over the years, but you and Draco have taken blatant idiocy and raised it to an art form."
"Of course, whenever you can return is fine. Our doors are always open to you, Neville." She holds out her hand in a formal gesture of goodbye.
"Might not," Draco agrees.
He leans in to whisper in Draco's ear, "Are you ready for this?"
Draco's spine snaps to attention, and his eyes narrow on Harry's. "No, thank you. I know how this game is played. I've been tied up and laughed at for what I want, what I am. I have no desire to repeat the experience."
"What?" Draco's voice cracked. "What are you talking about?"
It was too late. His rage condensed to a singular focus, and his tongue sharpened in that old familiar Malfoy way. "I realize that you lost every scrap of decency when your sire sucked out your humanity as well as your soul. And apparently we've established that you think you can have me when and wherever your deviant need arises." Anger seeped into his tone, bitter spite leeching into his words with every enunciated syllable. "I know you haven't got any respect for me, after all, I'm just a possession to you, aren't I? But you could at least have some for her. Have you no shame at all? She loved, you, you bastard!" Draco hissed. "And this is how you repay her affections? By trying to fuck me on top of her corpse?"
Harry glares at him. "Please, Draco." His tone isn't at all pleading, but it seems to satisfy Draco, who sighs loudly with annoyance.
"But—but, you hated my father. Why would you go to his funeral?" Draco sputtered.
Harry stood and she walked into his personal space without hesitation, wrapping her arms around him for a hug. “I’m glad you came. We missed you. I hope that you and Draco will come for Sunday dinners more often. Molly was beside herself.” She stepped back and placed a hand on his cheek. If the coolness of his skin was surprising to her, she didn’t let on. He swallowed, waiting for some other reaction, but in the end, she was just Hermione. The same accepting, soft-eyed, tender sister he’d always wanted. The sister he’d come so close to leaving behind.
"No," Malfoy says, shaking his head with force. The tone of his voice is sharper, higher, and definitely defensive. It's skating very close to the edge of fear as he continues, "No. I mean why are you staying? Why would you want to?"
"Why haven't you taken the trust?" he blurts. Harry has no idea what's holding Draco back, after all, isn't this the very thing he's wanted? The head of house, the seat on the Wizengamot that comes with it, the rightful title as Lord Malfoy. He's been primed since birth to accept the mantle. Hell, he was prepared to follow his father into service for a Dark Lord for a promise of the glory to be had. To have it within his reach now and not take it makes Harry wonder if Draco ever wanted it in the first place.
Pansy's grin is wide and self-effacing. "I'm an alcoholic." She drains the last of her pumpkin juice. "But I could do with a refill."
He nodded. “Of course.”
"Really?"
Draco remains still.
"Harry. Call me Harry."
When Draco raised his head, he was surprised to find a twinkle in the Auror’s eye. “That she is, Weasley. You’re a very lucky man.”
"Go away, you bastard," Draco says lightly. "I'll owl you soon."
He takes his leave of Millie with a kiss to the cheek and an apology, but when she tracks his line of sight, she waves him off and disappears into the throng of people. Harry hands off his half-empty glass of pumpkin juice to a passing floating tray and adjusts the line of his Muggle suit with a quick jerk to the cuffs and a smooth hand over his tie.
I accept you.
"The courage of your convictions is admirable, but don't martyr yourself to them. It will only end in pain. Trust me." Severus' fingers rested on the back of the chair, curled into the worn leather. His dark eyes radiated sorrow and heartache. "Listen to me, Draco. There is no shame in forgiveness. Nor is there in weakness. I know Lucius taught to seek every advantage over your enemy and to keep them beholden to you. Don't spend your life fighting to keep the higher ground. Because you may be able to look down your nose, but it won't mean a thing when you tumble over the edge."
"You're to come," Draco stressed. "She and Ron want you there."
"There's nothing generous about the truth."
Draco scrambled back, barely aware of the slide of cool sheets against his skin. The heat that had begun bubbling away in his blood had him too hot, too feverish to be mitigated by the chill of soft cotton. He scooted back toward the wall, stopping when he felt the edge of the four-poster near his back.
"Of course they would. We're practically married, you know. I wouldn't be surprised if the Ministry has formally changed your name to 'Malfoy-Potter' or some such nonsense."
"And now you've put me off my breakfast, you git." Draco pushes his plate back and sighs again. "Are you determined to disturb me today?"
Death.
Harry sucks in a breath at the thought. "Then you don't know me as well as you think you do. Neither does the
“You see, mate. Not so hard to understand after all. It’s unconditional. Family. You can’t ever do wrong by me. There is nothing so terrible that you could do to make me stop loving you. We’re brothers. In every sense of the word.”
"Color."
Potter’s face twisted and his shoulders went rigid. “No! I can’t! I don’t want to do this!”
Granger’s eyes narrowed. “If you will actually give this some thought, you’ll understand how this can be beneficial to you.” He had to applaud her attempt to appeal to his Slytherin side.
Potter's hands pulled him close, slotting him against his body. Draco tilted his head and waited for the kiss he knew was coming. The burst of heat in his blood wasn't surprising; Potter's touch never failed to light the flames of his desire. It was the thrill that shuddered through him at the prospect of finally completing this dance between them. Now, as Potter plundered through his mouth with a damning assault, he realized this is what he'd been waiting for. Why the distance had been so hard to endure. This was the inevitable conclusion, and as the moment approached, he was breathless, entranced.
Harry chuckles. "I wouldn't expect anything less."
"Not particularly, no," Potter parroted.
“Dessert, Draco?” she asked.
"What?" Draco stares up at him, mouth agape. Harry's brows knit together on his forehead, and Draco awkwardly scrambles to his feet. "Wh—why?"
"Ten galleons says that we see Nev at breakfast tomorrow." Harry grins. "What do you think?"
From then on, it's a series of whips and bites, of pressing fingers and sucking kisses. It's a fury of pleasure and pain spiked with the worship of the prostrate body before him. He welts and licks every inch of Draco's porcelain skin until he's pink and red and striped, mottled with the reverence of Harry's mouth on his flesh, his lips on his skin, his tongue in his arse. And through it all Draco is open and naked, bared to Harry and possibly himself in ways that can only exist between one soul in two bodies.
He glares in response. "That's not fair. There were several years of my life where Harry Potter didn't play a starring role, thank you very much."
Because that's what he is. A freak, an anomaly. Something that doesn't exist in the wholesome. Something dirty that feeds in the perverse dark.
When he takes his erection in hand, he hisses loudly, teeth clamping down on the moan that wants to break free. His cock is hot to the touch, already red and leaking at the tip. One stroke is all it takes, and that moan slips out, sounding more like a satisfying groan.
"Again, none of your business."
Draco stopped at the foot the stairs and looked back at her. “It was lovely to see you again, Hermione. I look forward to tomorrow. Please thank Mrs. Weasley for her gracious invitation.”
“Yes,” Draco said, twirling his fork in the air, “but is there anything you miss? Merlin’s beard, I think I would go spare if chocolate no longer appealed to me.”
"And so you killed him, just like you were supposed to, but I don't think you expected to survive. It must have been disappointing when you did, because now you had to face what your life would become post-AK. What was left for you, eh? What was left for the Savior of the Wizarding World? An Order of Merlin? An Auror post? What? What was left for you?" He paused, taking in the pallor of Potter's face at his words. "I'll tell you what was left. Guilt. So much guilt you wanted to drown in it, didn't you?"
“Shit!” Draco yelled, stumbling back to hit the wall. He pressed a hand over his heart to calm himself as Potter stood there and stared. “For fuck’s sake, Potter! What’s the matter with you?” Water beat down on him as he sputtered and Potter’s eyes roved over him, naked and prone.
"You want me to stay?" Harry asks, unable to believe what he's hearing.
“What?” Ron lifted a shoulder in a casual shrug. “Nothing. S’good, that’s all.”
Draco's lips pulled back across his teeth in a mocking grin. "You've always been lucky."
"I—I don't, I mean, I didn't think much—well, yes," Draco stutters. His eyes widen on an incredulous gasp. "What's in there?"
Death. Power.
Harry grins. "I'll make sure Kingsley launches a full-scale investigation."
Harry shrugged, not liking the guilty way her direct gaze made him feel. “If he wants to go and see her, I have no problem with that. I won’t keep him from her.” It was effortless that after only a few hours they were back to their old habits, and Hermione rolled her eyes and sighed.
"You're right," he chuckles, and his laughter touches her in a way that Lucius never could. "You deserve more."
The intimation is not lost on Draco, and his voice drops to almost a whisper. "Intimate? Like a playroom?"
Neville's eyes are stormy and bright, and he's staring down at her like she's the only thing in the world worth his attention. She opens her mouth to speak, but his hands clamp down on her upper arms, and he slams her against his body as his mouth claims hers in a kiss that whites out her vision.
"Careful, Draco. I might start to think you wear your heart on your sleeve."
"What?" Potter panted.
Those last three words thrilled him more than they probably should have, but looking into Potter's eyes, he found an honesty and earnestness that was anything but false.
Malfoy.
The fingers on his left hand curl and uncurl, and Harry knows exactly why. The Mark is a lot to make peace with, even if he professes he has. Harry still has nightmares about some of things he's done in the name of war; he can only imagine how Draco must be struggling to reconcile himself as well.
“Kreacher’s left you breakfast. You should eat.”
His brow crinkles and his mouth opens to speak, but it takes him a second to find his words. "Better. I had a moment of self-reflection which made things difficult."
Fear.
"That's enough, Draco."
"I like looking at you," he says. Harry's voice is thick and full of interest. "You have no idea how much. You're something worth watching."
Potter snorted out through his nose, releasing a grunted sigh, but made no move to bite. Draco swallowed, steeling his courage, and tightened his grip on Potter’s hair. He pushed, forcing Potter’s face into his skin.
Wide gray eyes meet his and Draco's mouth falls open to reply with something snarky, Harry's sure of it, when Narcissa replies from behind the rim of her tea cup. "So is Draco."
"Nah," Ron waves him off. "I've got my own Slytherin to deal with now. And Pansy and Draco are still tight. So I imagine it's going to be a flat-out riot from now on." He shakes Harry for good measure. "Think about it—Hermione, Pansy,
"Happy?"
“You should keep your strength.”
She staggers back a step because what she is looking at is nothing short of overwhelming. There, big as life in front of her eyes, is the Sword of Gryffindor, indelibly marked on his skin. It starts at his neck, with the ruby red cabochon of the pommel and continues as the grip follows down the long column of his neck, spreading out into the cross guards that span his shoulders. The blade itself spears down, long and piercing, stopping just above the base of his spine. It's full color, and stands out against the rich tan of his skin. Down the center of the blade, she makes out the word 'chrysalis', and the tip of the last 's' curls into the shape of a butterfly.
Harry's grin turns playful again and he gives Draco a cheeky grin. "Anticipation makes the cock grow harder."
"Do you have any idea how sexy you are right now?" he murmurs against Draco's throat. "How unbelievably gorgeous you look? Tied up here, just waiting for me to kiss you properly?" Harry's hands reach up over Draco's and grab the frame. "So patient, taking my kisses when I know you want more." He moves on to Draco's cheeks, licking over his face with the point of his tongue, dragging it over the arch of his brow, planting tiny, butterfly kisses down the bridge of his nose. Harry lets his lips ghost over Draco's eyelids, grazes his teeth over Draco's temples. He lets his mouth wander and worship over the high forehead, before coming back down to suck an earlobe into his mouth. He bites down and tugs, and Draco's whole body seizes. For a second, Harry thinks Draco might have lost his control.
Draco doesn't move.
Draco bucks and gasps, and Harry changes the angle and does it again, finishing with a hard squeeze to the meaty cheek. Draco whimpers, and Harry rubs his lips over the tight hole.
"Good," Harry says. "You look well, anyway." He bends down to Draco's ear and whispers, "You look fucked. I like that."
Draco's eyes are still firmly fixed on his half-empty plate, and that attractive blush is creeping into his cheeks again. Harry's not sure if it's from the scrutiny he's giving Draco, or more the fact that Draco doesn't like to be talked about as if he's not even in the room.
"I'll have to hold you down to do it. I want to be able to taste your cock at the back of my throat."
Draco jerks again and hisses. Harry catches a glimpse of Draco's cock as it bobs down between his legs, hard and red. It's left drops of wetness on the cushions.
Draco's breath is warm on his face, and his eyes are shining now. Heat is radiating from his body and Harry knows if he looks down, he's likely to see evidence of an erection in Draco's trousers. A slow, pink flush is working its way up his neck, coloring him in patches that Harry wants to lick and bite at his leisure.
Ron goes paler than Harry's ever seen. "How—how did you know about that?"
"I don't think she'll be too upset. She dotes on you, you know." Draco's smile is soft. "And she's not my owl. She's yours."
Harry can understand the need to let go, to cede control of his emotions, even if he doesn't experience it himself. But Malfoy's a live wire now, sparking and burning across the room. His emotions are running away with him and there's nothing he can do but hang on. He's lost control and he's scared, but he can't stop. He's got no ground, no anchor, and he's spiraling higher and higher toward an inevitable crash. Malfoy's anxiety is pulsing out of him in waves so thick Harry thinks he can reach out and pluck it from the air like a Snitch.
She pulled back and swiped the back of her hand over her face, stepping back to take a long look at Potter. Her hands came up to smooth over the line of his shoulders in a nervous, fluttery gesture, and then over his tie, as if she had to keep touching him in order to convince herself he was real. Weasley gently brushed her aside and took up her place in front of Potter. His face had softened, and he stared at Ron with the same pinched expression and held out his hand.
00000
Her restraint faltered and she pulled Potter into a hug. “Harry,” she whispered. “We’ve missed you so much.”
“I heard
“On the contrary, the conversation she and I enjoyed was littered with ‘Grangers’ and ‘Malfoys’.” Draco shrugged. “It was all very nostalgic. Until she dropped this in my lap.”
She smiled and nodded. “Yes. I wanted to let you know that everything has been squared with Gringotts, and you now have access. Oh, yes, your wand was supposed to be returned to you, but no one could seem to lay hands on it. However, you’re clear to visit Ollivander’s and-“
*smh* Oh...oh, Harry.
“I hope to Merlin you know what you’re doing.”
He doesn't flinch at her touch, not until she reaches the tip of the sword, and even then it's only a sharp intake of breath. His skin is warm, so warm, and her finger slides easily, aided by the thin coating of clean sweat.
He opened the wards and allowed the presence inside, finally meeting the intruder's face as he reached the bottom of the stairwell.
Draco swallows, blinking rapidly. "No." His voice has a slight croak.
"I'm in the shit, Harry. The absolute shit."
Narcissa keeps her husband's furious gaze as the frost in her voice turns glacial. "The portrait, Blinky."
Harry ignores him in favor of quelling the look of surprise on Narcissa's face. "Of course I'm sure. I wouldn't have suggested otherwise. Nev's the best when it comes to plants. He's the Herbology professor at Hogwarts now."
"Frankly, the worst part was having to go to Snape with my tail between my legs. One more thing he gets to lord over me, I suppose. He always did like that, snarky bastard." Potter's brow furrowed. "Your chat was quick. I thought he'd have more to say."
Potter's eyes drifted shut and he whined against Draco's mouth, "You don't know what you're asking."
“Honestly, Harry. Put yourself in his place. He’s been in prison, his father is dead, his mother killed herself, and he’s tied himself to you. Now he’s free and he has to put all of that into some sort of perspective. Do you think he wants to be alone to try and do that?” She shook her head. “He may not ask, or let on, but if it were you, wouldn’t you want some support? For heaven’s sake, the man needs some closure!”
"Noted."
"That's not necessary," Ron pipes up behind her. "'Mione and I are headed out as well. We'll escort Pansy."
?" he cries, flinging a hand in the direction of his departed mother.
Green eyes glazed for a moment, and Potter’s breath hitched.
Draco's smile faded a bit. "Well, I didn't sign up for the Severus Snape life-coaching course, so I'm afraid potions will have to suffice."
Blinky lets go of his hand. "You's be sitting, Master Harry. Blinky is to be bringing you breakfast." The cheery little elf prods him in the direction of the nearest chair, forcing him down into it with a tiny, but very strong grip on his elbow.
"Blinky is being here, Miss Cissa."
Narcissa Malfoy looks absolutely gob smacked. It's an interesting expression on her regal face. One that quite doesn't belong. Her voice quavers as she speaks. "Sanct—you called for 'sanctuary' specifically?"
The denial came automatically. "That's not—"
Harry glances at Zabini. "Enjoy your evening, Blaise."
"Nonsense," Harry chides her with a smile. "A witch as skilled as yourself? I don't think so, Cissa. Why don't you let me get Neville Longbottom out here and take a look?"
"Even though I'm gay, and have no interest in women whatsoever?"
Draco hauled in a deep, shuddering breath before sinking to his knees and sobbing.
Draco nudged him back in silence and Ron continued up the stairs.
Draco couldn’t bring himself to laugh. “Yeah.”
Draco swallows again, as if he's having hard time keeping moisture in his mouth. "Yes, Harry."
Narcissa laughs in spite of herself.
Potter's face was a trampled mix of surprise, sadness, and disbelief. "I didn't—I didn't know. You really…you, I mean—"
Draco shrugged, staring into Potter’s eyes. “That remains to be seen.”
"You're the only one I've ever invited to my bed. There's been no one else in here but you."
"Your room? It's clear at the other end of the house. Why is that?"
"There are two reasons you should use a safeword. If you are physically injured, or if you feel you are either emotionally or morally compromised. I will check in with you sometimes and ask for a color. 'Green' means continue, 'yellow' means slow down. If you feel you are at 'red', then safeword. Can you abide by that?"
"You were so beautiful, Draco. You did so well."
“The only one who said you weren’t welcome was you.”
Narcissa laughs despite herself. "Yes, Draco can be an acquired taste. But we've both learned over the years to cultivate new interests."
He knows Draco knows he's in the room; the door creaked when it opened. But when Harry takes a step inside, his trainer squeaks loudly on the wood floor, and Draco twitches. Not in a good way. The hope that blossomed in chest deflates slowly as he moves, desperate to disprove what he's knows he's going to find when he gets close enough to see.
Pansy's eyes glitter with mischievous amusement. "You let me get my hands and my fabric on you and you'll have Draco eating out of the palm of your hand for eternity." Her lips quirk. "If he doesn't already."
All the moisture in Draco's mouth receded, leaving him faltering for speech, but Potter leaned in and spoke, mercifully removing the burden of needing to form a cogent reply.
"Faster," Harry says. "Tighter. Imagine it's my hand wrapped around you." He spreads his hands across his knees for Draco to see. His hands are not as long; they're wider, and his fingers are thicker. "How hard do you think I can squeeze?"
"Coffee would be lovely."
“Yes, you pillock, and he chose you! He could have stayed in Azkaban, but he didn’t. And before you insult me by saying he’s only here because it was a chance at freedom, I’ll tell you that he was under no illusions. He knew that you were the price to pay for it. He was willing to take a chance on you. So have the decency not to treat him like crap.”
Draco opens his mouth to ask the bartender for a napkin to make an attempt at drying off, but a pristine white handkerchief is thrust under his nose. Potter’s smile is still there, but there is also a low heat banking in those green eyes. He says that Potter doesn’t seem the handkerchief type, but thanks him all the same. Potter shrugs and tells him he carries one for his godson. Apparently, they go for ice cream often, and the boy is quite messy.
"What?" Harry asks, noting the way Narcissa's face goes a little pale. Draco's jaw tenses and the hand holding his fork in midair drops to the table with a heavy thunk.
This is what he wants Draco to realize. That power is not defined by position. That control is not always domineering.
"Seven is perfect, Mother. I think Cook will be pleased to cater an affair after so long." Draco replies.
Molly’s joy was palpable as she placed the tart on the table and began to slice.
Draco keens at the praise, and Harry's hands give him a reassuring squeeze.
He can see the moment it clicks into place for Ron, because his eyes grow wide and terrified, and his mouth falls open on a gasp. "Merlin, she's going to kill me, isn't she?"
"His skin is lovely, Harry. Pale and milky," Silvestri sucked in a breath. "Just beautiful. Imagine how gorgeous he would be between us."
Remembering his upbringing, Draco bowed formally from the waist. “Great Aunt Walburga. A pleasure.”
The vampire’s voice was smooth and as cold as glass. “This is the best we can do. His only other option is death.”
His grip loosened and she pulled her arm back with a jerk, rubbing the skin. “Yes, damn you.” It felt like a lost cause, but her heart refused to relinquish the possibility. “I can accept what you are, because I knew the man you were. And that’s enough for me.”
Draco's breath hitches at the word 'lover'.
Mrs. Malfoy frowns at Malfoy again, hard and cutting, before softening her features for Harry. "There isn't much I can think of that would cause this sort of thing to happen, other than two things."
"Stop—"
Potter stiffened, and the lines on his face drew up in taut denial. “I’m fine. Go to bed.”
Draco's mouth falls open, panting, and his tongue darts out to swipe over his lips. It's a blatant invitation, and Harry's just about ready to accept.
But Potter must have had a few neurons firing in the right direction to recognize who was at the other end of the taut string of pleasure, because his mouth crashed down onto Draco’s, panting his name into Draco’s open mouth as he came in pulses of wet, slick heat.
Draco waves a hand at him and chuckles. "Merlin, you're maudlin."
"I'm here, Mother. I read your letter, and I know now why you chose this for yourself. I won't pretend to not be hurt, because your loss means as much to me as mine did to you. But I understand." His left hand ached, both from the free-flowing cut that poured blood onto the stone floor and from the tight clench of his fingers, but he couldn't be bothered now to heal it. The wound to his heart was more important. "I understand, and I will never hold your choice against you, nor will I ever hear you disgraced because of it. You were the strongest woman I knew, yet also the most gentle, the most loving. That is what I will remember about you. That in dark times, you bent for no one, not Father, not even the Dark Lord, when you defied them all in saving Potter." He leaned forward and pressed his lips to the cold granite and whispered, "I forgive you."
Draco's head snaps up. "I know." Harry expects to see more of Draco's earlier indignation, but there's nothing behind his gray eyes but flat acceptance. "Your do-gooder Gryffindor nature wouldn't allow it. And there's nothing to usurp, as my mother so tactfully pointed out. I'm assuming the house magic is latching on to the nearest powerful presence." A pale eyebrow rises in a perfect arch. "Of course, that would be you."
"Yes," Hermione says, "I did want to talk more with you about this new line of yours. If that's alright with you, Pansy?"
“That’s exactly my point, Kingsley!” A familiar female voice hissed in return. “The fact that Malfoy is completely unsuitable is what makes him perfect!”
After a second, the wards dissolve, and the door to Draco's room flies open with a bang. Draco bolts upright with a hand to his chest.
“No.” Ron’s hand came up to rest on his shoulder. “You’re still Harry, underneath it all. And yes, you could have killed me. But can you honestly say that if the tables were turned, that you wouldn’t feel the same way, if it were me?”
Draco whined in the back of his throat, hot and pitiful. "Please," he begged, not giving a shit about his dignity when Potter had those two amazing fingers in his arse. He wanted Potter's cock, he wanted stimulation, he wanted it all, and he wasn't above begging to get it. "Fuck me! Merlin—just…please! Fuck me!"
"Go to him. I think the fact that I'm here is sufficient proof of Potter's capability to grovel effectively, don't you think? We'll discuss the terms of this arrangement and why I'm here at a later time. Right now, you have other business to attend."
“What are you doing in here?” Draco asked, his eyes scanning the room.
"Praise Merlin," Harry breathes out. "I don't want you to ever lose who you are." He sniffs and stands back. "Now let's get something to eat. I'm starving."
"You know I've never been a fan of your father's, but I can't imagine he was right about everything. He made his fair share of poor decisions. I don't think he could really fault you for that."
"No. He's late," she said. "And he didn't mention being late. That's not like him."
Draco.
Draco sighs, a long, forlorn exhalation of breath. "I know, Renault. Nothing about him was what I expected, and I suppose it's the same for him. I can't look back and I can't go forward, either. It seems what I want isn't to be found. Not there and certainly not here." Draco's fingers clench at his side. "It's alright, though. I guess you can't really miss what you never had."
Harry steps closer and peers into Draco's face, forcing him to make eye contact. "If I have to put you out, you will not come back. Ever."
His days of pathetically attempted evil are long behind him, which apparently the DMLE knows, since they’ve begged him to come in and consult (for an extravagant fee, no less) on a particularly difficult case involving an illegal potions smuggling ring.
Potter pulls Draco’s wand from his back pocket (of all places) and holds it out with remarkably steady hands. He says that he’s been meaning to return it and apologizes for not doing so sooner. Draco’s fingers curl around it slowly, because he has to force himself not to snatch it out of Potter’s hand like the ungrateful little shit he used to be. He takes in a deep breath, but his brow furrows because it should feel like coming home, but it doesn’t, not quite. He stares down at it and realizes there’s something else there, embedded somewhere between the hawthorn and his skin, an old tension and a new warmth that he can’t place, but at the same time feels distinctly familiar. It prickles against his magic, starting a slow burn in his chest. He glances back up and knows precisely what it is.
With that, Draco is gone, and Harry can't resist the bubble of laughter that escapes when the doors are slammed shut behind the retreating blond.
It’s never been clearer to Draco than in this moment exactly how much Potter just…is.
"But Harry," Hermione cuts in, "you don't really need the money." He hears the unspoken 'so why would you waste your time?'.
“Harry, Harry. Talk like that only encourages me to try.”
Harry grabs him by the face to still him, and plunders his mouth with wild ferocity. Draco moans above him, and when Harry pulls back to stare into his eyes, Draco leans forward to lord over him like a vulture. Blond hair has become mussed and shaggy, falling over his face, but Harry can see the light of arousal burning bright in their depths. Draco's arms brace themselves on the back of the sofa, on either side of Harry's head, bracketing him in. Harry grabs him by the hips and thrusts up, and Draco's head falls back on an indecent groan, exposing the long, sinuous column of his neck. Harry bites it just to hear him gasp.
about on the furniture. It's so obvious, it's pathetic." The tirade is delivered with the same high-handed affront Harry remembers from his youth. 'My father will hear about this' could be tacked on at the end, and he'd be right back at Hogwarts.
"Yeah, you too, Nev."
His chuckle erupted as he turned and sat up to face her. She paled at the sight. This was not her Harry. This Harry was darker, sharper, and the athletic build his body once held had transformed into something rangy and feral. The shaggy mop of dark hair was as unkempt as ever, and his face was drawn tight. He was suffering.
With all the bodies milling in and out of the gallery, Harry's fairly certain they're violating some sort of Ministry fire code. But with the Ministry's top brass lounging about swilling champagne like it's going out of style, he's pretty sure a fine won't be forthcoming.
"Don't say it," Draco says, mouth in a firm, but resigned line. "I can see it, but perhaps if I ignore it, it will go away." He closes his eyes and sighs. "Yes, that's what's going to happen."
Something passes over Malfoy's eyes, a flicker of emotion that Harry just can't read, not yet.
Unbidden, he found himself drifting to his feet and crossing the small room to sit as requested. Before he could open his mouth to speak, she unfurled the parchment and shoved it across the table. “I’ll get straight to the point,” she said, tapping her forefinger on the scroll. “I’m here about Harry.”
He knew Potter wanted to tell her no, to be left out the conversation entirely, but Draco squeezed lightly on his thigh again, and his breath caught as Potter squeezed back and turned his face to Molly.
a second later.
It will be a perfect opportunity to make things plain once and for all.
Her arms wind around his neck without thought. "Take me to bed."
“Nearly ripping Ron’s face off tends to put a damper on harmonious familial relations.”
Harry watches her go, head held high, with smooth, gliding steps. He can still feel her warmth, just like he can feel the Manor's magic wrapped around his knees. It's determined to ground him here, to brand him into this place, to make him a part of it. He wonders if he should feel guilty about the way he's responding to Narcissa Malfoy. He wonders if it's an insult to his own mother. Somehow, Harry has the feeling that if everything had happened in the opposite direction, he'd be watching Lily Potter mother Draco Malfoy.
"After you, Potter."
"Very well, but you should come to Lucerne. And bring your mother, because if I have to stare at your brooding face the whole time I'll go spare. It puts me off my tea," Renault pouts.
The vampire's face bore little expression but at the question, the flicker of light in his eyes snuffed out, and something shuttered closed in the emerald depths. "Doesn't matter. I can't have what I want."
Draco's long lashes fluttered at the change in subject, but he replied smoothly, "I'm in talks with Granger about the requirements for apprenticeship. She seems to think I can move forward with my business plan as long as Snape is listed as partner. Cuts down on my waiting time."
“Yes,” she hissed. “I can. I can’t make Harry’s decisions for him, but I can damn well give him the best shot at making smart ones.”
Harry sees the tiny flicker of light in Draco's eyes growing by the second.
"Relax."
In his heart, Draco knows his mother is right. He isn't complete, and neither is Harry. They're circling around something close to completion, but Draco is too scared to breach the wall and make a grab for it. Because his life is as empty and as hollow as an open grave. But it's easy, and boring, and doesn't carry with it the sort of soul-shattering disappointment he knows he might find tied to the end of Harry's bedpost.
“She’s very persuasive, your Granger.”
Her words are so painstakingly polite, so devoid of scorn, yet somehow her calm smile makes him feel like a Crup who's shit on her favorite rug. His spine snaps straight, lest she chide him for slouching in her presence.
Ron waves him off. "Oh, hell, Harry, you know what I mean."
"Well, since you haven't told me where we're going, I thought it better to err on the side of caution. Mother always said one should dress as one intends to behave." Draco smirked. "Malfoys always behave with dignity. And therefore, I am dressed respectably." He wrapped the green scarf in his other hand around his neck. Potter's eyes latched onto it like a Seeker after the snitch.
Potter turned away from him, shaking his head and his fists, hissing to himself. "I knew this would happen. I fucking
Draco nodded.
Harry sneaks a glance at Draco, expecting to find him fuming at the interaction between Neville and his mother.
He has to stretch a bit more, and raises on his toes before his hands curl around the metal. The angle has his hips and his arse lifted high, concaving his back into a slight dip at the reach. The creamy expanse of skin that is on display is gorgeous to behold.
"Blaise was my first experience with this kind of relationship, and I was ignorant to some of the forms it can take. I—I have a need to submit, I know that now. And I know that it comes from a different place than I originally thought. I sought men who were like Blaise, terrible and cruel, because I thought that's how Doms are. I didn't think the way I needed to submit would ever be in line with any Dom's need to control. And once I was in a place to make a better decision, it wasn't worth the effort involved to try to find someone who could fit my needs. And then you drop in here and all the memories come flooding back, and I find myself responding to you. Good and bad."
"I'm not going to touch you," Harry says, and the words sound like gravel in his throat.
But Harry recognizes that his presence in the Manor alone is enough make him the pusher, not the pushee. Frankly, Harry doesn't have buttons anymore, not since he's swapped out the boy he used to be for the man he's rewired himself to become.
Potter was unmoved by his outburst. “I heard you.”
Potter nodded beside him. "I know. I've been here before. Twice, in fact."
Malfoy's hand drops roughly to his side, and those lips purse harder than he's ever seen. Malfoy's tightly wound, like a spring that's ready to pop.
Her mouth trips into a wry smile. "Liar. This is about Harry, isn't it?"
Draco's head shook back and forth as Potter advanced, coming closer, and that was the one thing Draco didn't need.
He stifled a grin. "Of course, sir. I am ready to receive your illustrious instruction."
Harry unfurls his arm from behind Draco to menace forward and stare Zabini down. "Listen very carefully to what I'm about to say, because I'm only going to say it once. Leave Britain. Now, while you still can. Because there is nothing here for you. There is no circle that will welcome you, no establishment that will serve you. My name carries weight in places you cannot fathom, and from the moment you arrived, the word spread. You are
"I haven't done anything to Draco," Potter protested.
Draco wanted to retort, but the words were stuck in his throat. Potter was infuriating. He wanted, but he didn't want. He was kind, but he was cruel. It was a maddening see saw from one extreme to the other, and it made Draco dizzy just to look at him.
Hermione patted her husband’s arm. “I think that’s enough, Ron.” She turned her attention back to Harry. “Have you given any thought on taking Draco to the Manor?”
And it’s always Potter.
Potter glanced at Ron, who, despite chewing with enthusiasm, shot Potter a look that left no doubt to Draco’s mind that there was a story behind her absence.
Draco could only nod. At Severus' arched eyebrow, he found his voice. "Yes, it was."
"What are those?" he asked, drawing away from Potter to turn to the mortuary. Draco's eyes widened and he inhaled sharply at the abundant flowering plants. Outside the huge stone edifice, a ring of blooming white flowers stood sentry, their scent permeating the air.
“Fucking hell, Potter!” He yelled, sitting up and placing a hand over his chest in surprise. “You’ll give me a heart attack at this rate. Was my heart beating too loud for you again?”
OOOOO
"Yes, but that was before there was something—" he waves a hand in the air, "I can't even fathom what it should be called, but
"Well, what do you think about this?" Draco asks her.
"He didn't want to worry you."
"Come for me. I want to watch you come all over yourself while I fuck you with my fingers."Draco's mouth falls open on a strangled hiss as he comes, his cock spurting in thick, heated ropes between them.
