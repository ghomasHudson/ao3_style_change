The war yawns in the space between them, a bottomless canyon of broken rocks waiting for them to say the wrong thing and break into irretrievable pieces. Draco forces a smile and shrugs. ‘The Dark artefacts were already removed by the Ministry after the war.’
party that was purportedly his. Harry Potter was in there. His stomach clenched tighter and he thought he might be sick.
‘I should go on my knees to beg you to take me back,’ Draco said, opening his eyes and Harry was drowning in the intensity of Draco’s want, his need, his heady, all-consuming love.
It’s dangerous, especially when he must be around strangers towards the end of the month. There have been occasions when he didn’t spot the alpha before the alpha started realising there is something about Harry. Just like right now, when he realises that Blaise Zabini is alpha. Before he can make an excuse to leave, Zabini lets Harry’s misstep slide, and instead, returns to the question Harry had asked.
The skin around the Dark Mark was inflamed and red, some areas leaking with foul pus, dark veins spreading out from the Mark across Draco’s forearm. The air filled with the sweet, pungent scent of rotting flesh. No matter how much salve Draco applied, it wouldn’t heal.
‘If he’s not here – if he’s gone,’ Draco’s mind was spinning, his thoughts randomly connecting, disconnecting. Potter would be in Dumbledore’s office for hours for those private lessons. Potter couldn’t be with Dumbledore
Ron told them, glaring at the first-years clustered around his sister, drawn by her irrepressible charm. The girl has an inevitable crush on Harry, and wouldn’t stop blushing around him, much to his apprehension.
He opens his eyes, reaching out to lay his hand over Draco’s on his cheek. Draco’s eyes are fervent, his face open and honest with his eagerness and vehemence.
Harry flushed, his skin turning hot under Draco’s fingers. “I’m sorry. It’s just – you killed – blood – and I’m – I’m really sorry.”
He has said the wrong thing, because Harry’s uncertainty merely sharpens into comprehension and—anger.
‘It could have been worse, considering that I came here to find my mate dripping in another alpha’s scent.’
‘It depends on what it is I want of course,’ Draco said with slight exasperation. ‘Never exchange it for something below the value of what you’re giving up. And I would do it slow and sweet, so the other party doesn’t find out they are giving it all up until it’s too late to take it back. You have to be sneaky … careful …’
The hapless sod who learns his subordination to a Hero, to his fated soulmate; who gives in fully because he doesn’t know there is another way.
When you entered it was like you were on a balcony. The common room rounded, and you could access it descending through the stairs that were on either side of the balcony. Opposite said balcony, you could find another set of stairs which led to yet another balcony from where Harry supposed you could go to the dorms. The common room held the different House colours, but where one would have thought that blue, red, yellow and green would clash, it was done in such style that it did not. The tables, chairs, couches and the library (yeah, there was a library, unbelievable right?) where done in tones of gold, black, silver and bronze, while those things that were more decorative, like the curtains, and the cushions were done in tones of red, blue, yellow and green. It was simply magnificent. Quietly, they descended the stairs, and when they turned around, they were even more surprised. Under the stairs, you could see five different banners, one for each house, and in the centre the banner of Hogwarts. It was a homey place, which inspired calm, and it couldn’t have been more perfect, at least for Harry. But judging on the faces of his schoolmates, everyone thought the same.
“I don’t know Hermione, I suppose that seeing my parents, made me miss them all of a sudden, more than I ever had. I never had had a true memory of them, apart from my mother’s screams, but now I do, and it’s just so hard to carry on without them… and I also cannot help but feel that in some way I am replacing them, as if they didn’t matter.”
spell onto his arm. Oh… the relief! The serenity of feeling the blood trickling down his arm, and the feeling of pain in it took away the nagging pain that he felt all day long in his body, in his heart. It was pure and utter relief, it brought him tranquillity and a peace of mind that he had never felt before, only when cutting. However, the feeling of relief ceased soon, so he kept casting more
“Thank you, Miss. Granger, for your testimony. You may leave the stand and retake your seat. Mr Potter if you may come to the stand now, please – Minister Shacklebolt said. Once he had taken his place in the stand and taken his oath, the Minister spoke again. – “Please state your full name to the Wizengamot.”
“I don’t get why you would say that, Hermione. Malfoy made your life hell since the day he met you! His bigoted ways and his hateful word were not because of Voldemort, but because of who he is!”
Sunday came to fast in Harry’s opinion, he was by no means ready to meet the Weasley family, but he had no option but going to Sunday dinner.
“You may sit” – said Minister Shacklebolt once he had taken his spot up in the stand. – “Aurors, bring the accused into the room, please”
“Huh… yes sure I’ll help you look…” – replied Blaise, still in astonishment about what had happened in the last ten minutes, and that such a thing as that map existed.
I'm so sorry for taking so long to post this chapter, I had hoped to do it sooner, but at the beginning, I was swamped with uni exams, and then when they where done, due to everything happening I never got the chance to keep writing.
I really hope that you enjoy it! As you'll see it is a little longer than the previous two, however it is not as long as the first chapters, but I do what I can, and what my muse allows me to so here it is!
Once those words left her lips, and uproar could be heard throughout the whole chamber. – “Please, lower your volume or I may ask you to leave this courtroom” – said Minister Shacklebolt with a solemn voice. While he was waiting or the crowd to stop screaming, Harry saw the shocked face of Malfoy at Hermione’s statement, as well as, an expression of gratitude as well as shock in Mrs Malfoy; clearly, she had not expected them to help her son, and even less her.
“Okay, Hermione, okay! You know what, you want to know it?! I cannot bear to see them because I cannot imagine a Burrow without Fred. I don’t think I could cope seeing George again, so devastated and so destroyed, without his other half. I have been through too much heartbreak throughout my life, I cannot bear to see another family broken. No matter if that family is mine, they will be better without me, I just know it. No matter how destroyed I might be if I never see them again, if I give them an opportunity in happiness I will stay apart.”
As she left the dorms, she started running as fast as she could towards the Astronomy Tower, where the name
“But don’t you understand, Harry, that if you had not made it through everything, none of us would be here? Voldemort would reign, and everything would be worse than anything we might have been through together. Yes, I’ve lost my parents, they do not remember me, but that is my fault, not yours! And had it not been for you, they might be dead, not living happily in another country! For goodness sake Harry! Had it not been for you the Weasleys would have lost their daughter in second year, their father in fifth year, and only God know how many more family members.”
“Harry? No, I have not seen him now that you mention it… he was not in the Great Hall during breakfast. Why were you looking for him?”
I know that it is such a short chapter, but I needed to end it here, so I will just say sorry for leaving you with this little cliffhanger.
Furthermore, I just started back with Uni so it's once again hard to find the proper time to sit and write.
He went into the living room expecting to see a sombre ambient, but he was met with a scene which he had seen many times before. Everyone screaming to one another to be heard, chaos everywhere, and it was just like coming back home. It was difficult to ignore the evident void made by Fred but, even though every now and then you could see a sad face, even George was laughing again, like old times. He had been able to carry on, and this made Harry feel that if they had been able too, he could too. He could live for those whom they had lost, for those that couldn’t live anymore.
Finally, everyone had given their statement, therefore the Wizengamot left the courtroom in order to make a decision. Due to an intricate spell which manipulated time, the Wizengamot Members were able to take all the time they needed in order to make a decision, while for the people in the courtroom it seemed just like mere moments. Consequently, in just mere seconds the Members of the Wizengamot were back with their verdict and retook their places in the stands. They all looked tired, and with bags under their eyes, which could only mean that they had taken a lot of time to reach a decision, hence anything could happen. When they were all seated, Minister Shacklebolt spoke again.
Harry, as Hermione had suspected had not gone to class, and therefore, she hadn’t either. She could not shake the bad feeling that something bad was going to happen out of her body and therefore had been unable to concentrate in class. It was for that reason that she had gone to McGonagall and had told her that she did not know where Harry was and that she was worried and asked her to get a permit to miss class for that day while she looked for him. However, she had not told her what had happened that morning, because she did not want to break Harry’s trust, and also because she was not ready to admit that she might also have a problem, and that was why things had escalated so quickly… McGonagall had granted her the permit, being also worried about her honorary Grandson, and had told Hermione, that if by curfew she hadn’t found him, to tell her so that she could help her look.
“That is a really good question, Miss Granger. You will indeed still be a part of your houses. You will be able to gain or lose points for them, as always, and of course, you will be able to go into your house common room, though I don’t think any of you will be much there. The password to your house will be given your prefects tomorrow. There is a thing, though, that you won’t be able to do with your houses, and I’m deeply sorry for it. It has been considered that as you should not be here, you won’t be able to play quidditch with your housemates, because if not we take the opportunity to play to those in inferior years, and you won’t be able to participate in the competition forming a team of your own, because it would give you too much advantage. However, that does not take that you cannot go to the pitch to train or to have fun, this will always be permitted. I’m deeply sorry to say so, but those who wanted to keep playing won’t be able to do so. Now, do you have any more questions? – this time no one spoke – well, as there is nothing more to say, you can go to your dorms. Your schedules will be handed in tomorrow morning at breakfast. Know that you are expected to seat in the eighth-year table, however, if you want, during breakfast, and only during breakfast, you will be able to sit with your housemates. To enter your dorms, you won’t need a password. Now listen to me closely, because this is important. When you arrive at the door of the common room, you all have to place your hand at the door. It is very important that all of you do this tonight. The door will read your magical signature, and it is through this signature that you will be granted entrance. If you do not touch the door tonight, you won’t be able to enter. The door has been made to hold sixteen signatures, apart from those of the professors which are already embedded, and it won’t open until all sixteen of you have touched the door. Your room is in the third floor, Miss Granger, Mr Potter, I believe that you will be able to guide you classmates there" – she said with a smirk in her face, and with a twinkle in her eyes that rivalled that of Dumbledore – now if you’ll excuse me, I’m really tired. Goodnight to you all.”
As soon as the words appeared, she opened the map and started searching through it looking for Harry’s name. She suddenly remembered that Blaise was in the room with her, and was still asking her what she was doing with a parchment, so she turned to look at him saying – “Hey Blaise could you help me look for Harry? I don’t know why I forgot about its existence, but this is basically a map of Hogwarts which shows you where everyone is within the castle except a few particular places.”
“Well, I know you probably won’t like this idea, but I truly think that we should testify in his favour, and not only for his but also for his Mother’s” – Harry was going to interrupt her when Hermione lifted her hand in a stopping motion – “No, wait a moment, just hear me out first, Harry. I know that Malfoy was a jerk to us in school, believe me, I know that. However, we cannot forget that he did not do this willingly. Yes, he is a Death Eater, but he was forced into being one, and you know that. You, better than anyone, know what Voldemort was capable of. Malfoy just wanted to protect his family, even if they were on the wrong side. He did not know any other means to protect them, no one had ever given him any other option but to follow his father’s steps. You saw how disturbed he was during sixth year when he had the mission to kill Dumbledore, and in the end, he was not capable of doing it. He just did everything that he could to protect his family, just like you went through everything to protect yours. And the same goes for Mrs Malfoy, she was just following her husband to protect herself as well as her son. She lied to Voldemort because of her son. She decided that it was worth it to give you a chance of defeating Voldemort for her son to have a better future than the one he would have gotten if Voldemort had won. Even though they did horrible things throughout this war, without them we would not have won, we would have lost long before the battle of Hogwarts and you know it. So yes, Harry, I believe that we should testify in their favour, even though I don’t believe that they should be given a full pardon, I do believe that maybe we should help them get parole.”
“Nothing happened per se, Molly. This past Sunday, after we returned home, we found two letters awaiting us. They were from Mrs Malfoy asking us to testify in his son’s behalf during his trial…”
However, thanks to the quarantine, I now have time in my hands to write again. Even though I still have university work, I have too many free time, and therefore I can write new chapters once more.
Of course, there were days when it was truly hard to keep going on, like the day when Hermione found out that she could not reverse what she had done to her parents. That day was not only hard for Hermione, but also for Harry. He did not know what to do, how to calm her sister, he wanted to put a brave face for her, but inside he too was broken, remembering once again those who had lost along the way, all the sacrifices they had had to do to win this war. It was in days like this when it was harder to carry on, when he wondered whether if it would be best to end it all. But then he remembered Hermione, and he forced himself to keep trying, just for her. She, just like him, could not lose another person. It would be too much to bear. They had been through too much, been to too many funerals in a short time, and they would not be able to say goodbye to another family member, just like they had to do to Fred, Remus and Tonks.
“Yes, and she is also the woman who saved your life, Harry! Besides, if this letter is for what I believe, it being cursed would not be beneficial for her purpose.”
By the end of September, Hermione was thinner than she had ever been. You could see every single bone protruding from her body. Therefore, to avoid more pestering from her friend she had started applying a Glamour to herself. She woke early in the morning before even Harry started stirring, and the first thing she did was go to the bathroom to shower and to apply her Glamour so that no one could see her deteriorating body. So far, she had managed to do this undetected, but “luck” doesn’t last forever, and even less when you have Mr Lucky sharing a room with you. When Hermione turned around to exit the bathroom and to go to the library once she had picked her books, she found herself in front of Harry, who had a look of hurt, as if being struck, in his face. She hoped that he had not seen her without the Glamour, but judging by his face, today was not her lucky day. His last words, though not very specific, confirmed her suspicions.
“Come on Harry, if you stay away you will bring them more pain! I understand it, okay? But have you really thought this through? Because I don’t believe so! The Weasleys see you as another family member, Molly and Arthur see you as another son. If you distance yourself you will bring them more pain than if you go to this stupid dinner. If you refuse their offer they will be losing another son, another brother. Can you make them go through the pain of losing another family member? For goodness sake Harry, did you read this letter? They are not telling you to stay away from them, they are inviting you to dinner, they are inviting you to live with them, they want you to be a part of their lives. They cannot bear the thought of losing you too.”
She stood there frozen for about 20 minutes, when she suddenly realised that Harry hadn’t come back, she was still alone in the room and she had no idea where he had gone to. She quickly clothed herself and left their dorm, hoping to see him in the common room. However, he was nowhere to be seen. The common room was empty and therefore, she had no idea where he could have gone because there was no one to ask if they had seen him leave. She decided to go to the Great Hall, as it was time for breakfast, and even though she was sure that Harry would not be there, maybe someone had seen him leave and could point her in the direction he had gone.
Hermione didn’t respond, there was no need to. They both knew that they had gone through while in the run had changed them too much. He still felt as though he should have done more, but he could not denay that those months had marred him forever. Living in cramed places had never been unknown to him, but at least while with the Dursleys he could know when the next meal would be; however, while in the run, they never knew if they would be able to eat that day, they didn’t know where they would be the next, or if they could ever stop running. Every day was full of uncertainties, and they never knew if there would be a next one or if it would be the last.
He looked around before he ran. He ran away like the bloody coward he’d always been. He cursed himself before apparting, mid-day, back to his home.
As the class went on, he tried not to notice Potter staring at him from time to time. He tried not to notice Potter observing his muggle clothes. He hoped that Potter wouldn’t notice the bags under his eyes, the lost weight. Then again, it wasn’t as if Potter looked much better. He looked better than he looked that night at the pub: much more sober. Yet, the bags under his eyes were deep, complementing the lack of light in his irises. His clothes looked rather slept-in and dirty, like he rarely did his own laundry. His hair was just as messy as it had always been, the kinks and curls sticking out and into his eyes. His glasses were dirty and smudged. Draco tore his eyes from Potter and looked at the syllabus again.
mean….mean…” Teddy stopped talking as a confused look spread across his face. He looked at Andromeda.
Rest was exactly what he did. He learned conversational French from Andromeda, spoiled Teddy, read muggle books, played Quidditch, and attended (wizard) therapy on a weekly basis. Attending a muggle uni was only the cherry-on-top for tabloids such as the Daily Prophet and Witch Weekly. Harry did not care: it was time for him to be selfish.
I’d love to meet up for lunch. I would suggest a muggle restaurant, but I know that you know how to get around the wizarding world much better. How about the Three Broomsticks at 1:45?
“I don’t ‘do’ meth! I only do coke and pills, but I got my last hit from a friend of Darren’s because I’m dumb as shit, and I didn’t think it through, and now I’m super high, and I don’t know what to do. What the hell do I do? Do you even do drugs? Do you even know anything
“Well, my probation requires me to stay in the country. I do get the occasional exceptions to visit my mother, of course.”
The trainees watched as the first group went through. It took Dean ten minutes to defeat the course, and Seamus defeated it roughly two minutes after Dean. The next group took about twenty minutes, as neither had successfully warded off the Expelliarmus at the beginning.
"That's how it is for me," Draco informed him. Harry noticed a few snowflakes taking refuge on Draco's eyelashes. Draco continued, "I have a massive freak out or nightmare and I hurt myself or drink or snort something. And then I can't even remember what upset me."
whomever got in her way—her friends, her husband, her sister, her nephew. It didn’t matter. When I turned sixteen, Voldemort gave me a mission: kill Albus Dumbledore. I didn’t want the Dark Mark and I
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he had Intro to Psych from 9AM-10AM, English 101 from 12PM-1:30PM, and Criminal Justice from 3PM-4:20PM. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, he would have Algebra 101 from 10:30AM-12PM, Earth Science 101 from 2PM-3PM, and World History 111 from 3:30PM-5PM. On Saturdays, he had French Aa from 6PM-7PM.
The night continued like that: a mixture of serious conversation, awkwardness, and puns. Harry loved it.
starting PTSD meetings, he still had problems sleeping. He rolled over in bed so that he could face his alarm clock. “Lumos,” he said. It read 4:06.
was released in 1999, shhhh.] Halfway through the movie, Draco leaned over to Harry and said, “These effects are amazing.”
Harry ended up figuring that Draco was going to a muggle uni because he wanted to mend his family’s name. Harry had attended the trials of all three of the Malfoys. He only testified for Narcissa and Draco. He knew that Lucius Malfoy had been sentenced to thirty years in Azkaban and had the Malfoy Manor seized. Narcissa was fined millions of galleons and was exiled. Draco was placed on probation, but Harry did not know those specifics. Thus, in the end, Draco Malfoy was the only person who could revive his family’s honor.
After lunch, Harry chose to sit in his room and think about the night’s events. It was true: he was concerned about the kiss. Harry really liked Draco, and if he didn’t realize it before the kiss, he definitely realized it after the kiss.
He signed up for the teaching opportunity because he remembered what Draco said; Harry did, in fact, love teaching. This internship was an experiment to see if he could actually be good at it. He hadn’t told anyone his plans because he was stills scared of being a failure. He remembered back in August when he chose to go to a muggle university because he was tired of being selfless. Had he possibly abandoned that point of view in the past eight months?
‘This is the first relationship that I’ve ever been in,” Draco said. “I’m not exactly sure how this is supposed to work.”
Draco observed their faces. The entire group looked to be pretty tipsy, but Potter seemed to already be on the way to smashed. It made Draco feel sick. It’d been so long since he’d had a drink. Since he’d been drunk. It also made him sick because there Potter was: drunk as fuck, falling all over a fellow Gryffindor in front of his ex-nemesis. In a bloody muggle bar. How the fuck did Draco even end up here?
"Miss Granger! I won't have you causing pain to my patient by making him speak, whatever your intentions are. So if you cannot behave I will have to ask you to leave his side."
“Well, I for one, dear Ronnikins, agree with them both. Yes, Malfoy was a git back in school, just as much as you were a git to him. He said and did awful things, that’s true, but that was the way he was brought up, and during the war, he just wanted to protect his family and himself. He did what he could to survive, just like all of us did, but he had different circumstances, not because he chose to, but because his family chose for him.”
“Well, what are we waiting for, why aren’t you opening the door, Hermione?” – said Neville, after Hermione and Harry had been staring at the door for two minutes straight. This seemed to pull them out of their stupor, and slowly they turned around to look at their classmates who were looking at them expectantly. – “Sorry, bad memories. Could anyone else open the door, I don’t think I will be able to do it…”
"Shush now Harry, do not force your voice and do not make me induce you with a Sleeping-Draught, please just be quiet for now."
Hesitantly, and with not many belief, everyone started putting their hands at the door. When all sixteen of them had put their hand on it, a blinding light was emitted, and when it dulled, in place of the old door you could now see a beautiful oak door with Hogwarts symbol embedded in it.
“I Swear on my Magic” – said Hermione. Swearing on your magic was not just a means to word an oath, but it was truly a swear to do whatever you had been asked, in this case, to tell the truth, or your magic would be taken away. Harry was thankful that they just had to give a statement, because if they had had to answer questions, Harry was not sure if he would’ve been able to answer without telling a lie, after all, no one could know about Horcruxes, and many things about the war revolved around them. The advantage of this oath was that it worked better than Veritaserum, because everything you said was known to be the truth, and you were not forced to just be able to answer direct questions. While he was musing in his thoughts, he heard Minister Schaklebolt speaking up again and asking Hermione to state her full name to the Wizengamot members.
I just wanted to say that this story is not, and I do not pretend for it to be abandoned, so just bear with me and with my awful ability to be constant, please. I will try to be somewhat constant, though I do not promise everything, and try to post the next chapter sooner.
He looked at the time and saw that it was almost Breakfast time. Knowing that Hermione normally was already out of the room at this hour of the day, he opened the curtains of his four-poster bed with caution and looked towards Hermione’s bed. He saw it empty, so he decided to go to the bathroom to shower and wash away all the blood. However, when he entered the bathroom, he stopped dead on his feet. He saw Hermione, freshly showered, with only a bra on. But that was not the problem, oh, no; the problem was that he would see every single bone of her body. He had never seen her so thin, and he had been living with her while on the run and with little to no food, so that was saying something.
Before any could notice, they realised that they were almost at Hogwarts, so they decided to change into their robes before it was too late. When they arrived, they descended the train, and they took a carriage just for the five of them. They could see a lot of people around them looking strangely at the carriages, and Harry realised that they were seeing the Thestrals for the first time. It was just another sign that they had gone through a war, that too many children had been fighting alongside it, and that despite their age, they had seen too much death. Seeing this brought his insecurities back to Harry, and he could see that his peers were the same, because the sombre feeling that they had initially in their compartment had returned. They were no longer cheerful, but expectant.  What would Hogwarts be like? Could they see the signs of destruction in the walls? Would they be reminded of that fateful night at every step they took? Harry was not sure he was ready to see Hogwarts again, but he could do nothing now. He had decided to return, and so he would put a brave face on, and we would not let the ghosts haunt him, whoever difficult it may be. If he let them, Merlin knows what could happen.
And please, if anyone knows how to get a Beta, could you please tell me? 'Cause I'm in serious need of one.
Harry looked like a deer caught in the headlights, seemingly having forgotten, just as Hermione had, what he had witnessed mere moments before.
Suddenly being in the Astronomy Tower did not seem such a hardship, he saw it as his way out. A way of being with his family once and for all. He had tasted a bit of happiness back in the forest, when he had seen his parents, Sirius and Remus, all so welcoming, so happy to see him and to have him with them. Now that Voldemort was gone, he could take the train and keep going on. There were no more reasons to stay back. He had been so tempted to go with Dumbledore when he had seen him at King’s Cross Station, but he had had to come back, he had to kill Voldemort. But that was done, so there were no more reasons to be here. He could just be another name in the long list of deaths, no one would pay hiss passing much mind. No one would miss him. Everyone had lost too much to miss him. With his mind set, he walked towards the edge of the tower.
“But it’s almost curfew Hermione, and I mean, I know that we can’t stop looking, he has been missing for the whole day, but I don’t want to get caught by a professor either, so maybe we should tell someone about it or something…”
She could not believe what she was seeing. Cuts littered all of Harry’s arms and legs, as more and more blood fell onto the floor. How could this have happened? How hadn’t she realised that her brother was hurting, that he was cutting himself over and over again? She was so ashamed of herself; she should have realised; she should have been there for him. She had known that her brother was not okay, that he needed to be watched, that was one of the reasons why she had really “forced” him to go to Hogwarts with her, to keep an eye on him, and to make sure that nothing like what happened at the Astronomy Tower happened ever again; and she had failed. Here he was, covered in cuts and blood, while Hermione had been none the wiser.
“None of that Mrs Weasley, darling, you either call me Molly or Mum, but I won’t be having any of that Mrs Weasley as if you had just met me, Harry. And you too, Hermione. Be warned, the both of you, I do not want to see the words Mrs Weasley leaving your mouth again if I can help it, and that goes for Arthur too, no more of that Mr Weasley, okay? You are family, first and foremost.”
“Welcome all to a new year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. First of all, just a quick reminder for all new and old students; the Forbidden Forest is, as its name says, forbidden. No one can go in, and if at any case someone needed to enter, they should go to Hagrid or any other professor to ask for permission and company. Curfew is at 10 p.m. by which time you all have to be at your common rooms. You are not allowed to leave the grounds of Hogwarts, except for those above third year, which will be able to leave during a Hogsmeade trip. Now, as all the announcements have been made, I would just give you a quick reminder to all. Every form of discrimination is frowned upon, I will not let any of my students to be bullied, jinxed or hexed. If at any time we see a student mistreating another detention will be given, and depending on the gravity of the situation, said student could even be expelled. Times for separation and judgement is over. These are new times, times for unity, to give second chances and to forgive. We do not have to forget, never, but we should always forgive those who deserve to be forgiven, never forget that either. I don’t care if some of you feel that you are doing the school a favour by attacking another student from another house for their past misdeeds, you are not. Everyone here in this school deserves to be here. Those who did wrong had been put away, everyone is in here for a reason, and I will not let another student with a hero complex be detrimental to their education. Now with further ado, please enjoy your meal, and welcome all to another year!”
it came in the post. He didn’t know why he felt so nervous other than the fact that the last time he went to a muggle school he got the crap beaten out of him nearly every day. University surely couldn’t be the same, he reminded himself.
I had a fantastic time last night and I am truly exhausted. Thank you so much for inviting me to dinner.
Harry knew when he’d had the second nightmare that he’d sleep through his first alarm. He knew when he woke up and paced around his flat for an hour or two that he’d sleep through his second alarm. He did not know, however, that he’d sleep through
"We've expanded by adding more muggle-based subjects; math, reading, biology; and doubling or tripling our teachers for magical education. We have three charms teachers, three transfiguration teachers, two arithmancy teachers, two divination teachers, and two DADA teachers…assuming our second accepts the position."
The day droned on for about seven hours. At 4:30, Harry went to meet up with Draco. Their plan that day was to chill in London. The wanted to see the park and go shopping, but, most important, they wanted to see each other.
After he finished eating, Harry shuffled through his presents and was once more mesmerized by the beauty of the scarf that Draco had gotten him. Surely, that meant that Draco liked him, right? Well, if he didn’t like him, he wouldn’t have kissed him, would he? But what if Draco wasn’t going to write back to him because he regretted the kiss? Harry was starting to panic, but then he saw Polonius flying towards the house.
That’s amazing—and terrifying. How many gnomes did Andy find in her garden exactly? I think that she amay’ve set a world record.
.          Teddy reached towards Malfoy, attempting to close the gap between the blond and Andromeda. He grabbed a fistful of Malfoy’s hair. Malfoy, who had obviously never been around a child like this before, tensed up. He looked up at the toddler’s fist.
. They sat on the tiny couch, silent. Once or twice, Cauliflower and Halloween would come up and smell Harry, as if judging him for their owner. They must have approved of him because, by the end of the movie, both cats were lying on top of his legs. When the credits rolled onto the screen, Harry moved to get them off of him.
“They look like Death Eaters to you, too, huh?” Harry asked, more so attempting to calm Malfoy down with small talk than expecting an answer.
They arrived at the restaurant and Draco got out first so that he could open everyone’s doors—a pointless but polite gesture. The night continued as they had a thirty minute wait for their reservation due to arriving early. Draco sat right next to Harry, and the latter could practically feel his heart beat up to his Adam’s apple.
Draco cleared his throat and let out a small smile. He replied, “Actually, I was on Neptune. I wanted to see how long a human could last in a gaseous environment.”
The secretary escorted him to the designated classroom and introduced him to the teacher. She was an old lady with a sweet, mellow voice.
Andromeda stepped in and responded, “Non, elle fait un gâteau pour ce week-end. [No, she is making a cake for the weekend.] Harry, I don’t know what  you did, but, whatever it was, it worked.”
Harry groaned at this also. He wasn't too excited for the party. This wasn't because he didn't want to see everyone, but rather because it had been his responsibility to send out invitations and then "thank you" cards. He didn't mind too much because Andromeda had handled the decorations, but he felt that he had done so much work that Christmas was already over.
“Me and you and Teddy. Unless you’d like to invite someone else,” Andromeda added, smiling cunningly.
“I’m sorry. It’s...okay. I should have clarified in the letter that it’s nothing bad. I just...need to tell you something.”
Harry Went about his day as normal as he could. At lunch time, Andromeda stopped him and told him that she would always love and accept him, and that Tonks wasn’t straight, either. However, Harry’s mood grew fouler as more and more papers came in. It was as if their accuracy got worse with time.
He got back home shortly after and went in through the kitchen. He glanced at the clock. It was about 4AM. Harry shook his head: the clicking second hand was giving him a headache.
“Okay, Xavier, would you like to make the shots or the martinis?” he asked Xavier, nearly sighing out of relief. It seemed that the rest of the night would be easy.
They sat in silence for a few minutes. It was odd because they hadn't had any truly awkward moments with each other in a month.
He stopped there and folded the paper up. Then, he stepped outside to chain-smoke for a while. When he came back inside, he saw that the clock read 4:05 AM. He was grateful. Four hours of sleep was a lot for him. After he fixed a pot of coffee, he heard a whimpering sound from Teddy’s bedroom. Harry rushed in and picked the toddler up.
Draco poured three fireballs, careful not to spill anything since Potter was watching the entire time. He set the shots down in front of the dark-haired man. Potter looked around, gave the Weasel and Longbottom thumbs up, licked his lips in anticipation, and downed all three shots.
Draco moved his hand up and rested it on Harry’s neck as their kiss became deeper. He didn’t want to stop the moment, but he couldn’t feel his hands anymore from the winter chill. He internally cursed himself for not bringing gloves.
He was walking home after his Art History 101 class, but he wasn’t focusing on the travel. He’d checked his watch every few seconds, but sit still said a few minutes past 4. Why was time going so slowly?
Harry was running. He was being chased, and he knew that he would be killed if caught. He quickly hid behind a tree to take in his surroundings. It was a dark, foggy forest, and a weird, blue-ish gray tinge had set over the atmosphere. He drew several deep breaths and reached for his wand. It wasn’t in his back pocket. He checked his other pockets and his waistband and the ground, and he just couldn’t find it. He began to hyperventilate. He ran again—this time not knowing how he would get away or where he would even go. Harry heard the same cold, sinister laugh as he had heard the 2nd of May however many years ago. He couldn’t think. He couldn’t breathe. He started screaming.
Harry continued his week like normal, not sure what to do with his newfound knowledge. He’d be lying if he said that he hadn’t thought about it. He had. It confused him so much because didn’t people always know their sexualities? How could you like someone and not even know it? Harry didn’t want to admit it, but he was scared. He’d read books and watched movies and everyone in them swore that this sort of thing didn’t change a person. But Harry felt changed. He felt like he’d found a missing part of himself. He felt like he found a lifelong secret. He felt like he’d finally taken a breath of fresh air after almost drowning.
Harry raked the gold and brown leaves all to one pile. October had begun to set in, but it was rather chilly for the twenty-ninth. He was wearing the sweater that Mrs. Weasley had gotten him for the last Christmas, yet he still had goosebumps. Or were those a result from his anticipation for the arising party? Only Merlin knew…
“Now, the caramel will cool for five minutes. As I was saying, we’ll have goody bags and we also need to have people giving out candy to trick-or-treaters. Cissy and I have agreed that we’ll do that. As for decorations, outside: we’ll have orange lights, some jack-o-lanterns, and a dancing skeleton. Ooh! We need to carve pumpkins and bake a pie. Also, what song should the skeleton dance to?”
Harry smiled. He was certainly tired after all of the cooking and celebrating. He asked, “Who all is coming?”
“Oh, yes. Once or twice. The first time was in second year—I believe—I accidentally turned up in the wrong chimney after using floo powder for the first time. It was a disaster!” Harry smiled in spite of his rambling, but couldn’t help himself from announcing, “Wait! I remember: you were in…somewhere…with your father. Borgin and Burkes, maybe?”
.          “Oh, don’t do too much, Harry. You’ve already decided to show us much of Manchester and your university. I don’t want you straining yourself,” she replied. She had that “oh, Harry, you’ve had such a hard life you just need to relax also are you okay I’m worried about you” look on her face that so many people had given him after the war’s end. He was fine. He really, truly was fine.
“It’s fine, P-Harry. I recognize that my actions have not made me the most trustworthy person-” Narcissa began, but was cut off by Harry.
First, he visited a store that was known to carry supplies specifically for teachers. It was one of his favorite places. He bought Flitwick a “World’s Greatest Teacher” coffee cup and some expensive tea bags. He bought McGonagall some high-class pens, a book on Latin and Greek roots for the English language, and a gold necklace with a witch hat. He bought Sprout several different breeds of muggle flowers. When he passed by an astronomy store, he knew that he had to buy something for Trelawney and Firenze.
Somehow, he still wasn’t sure about Sally—or any muggles, really. They helped each other and even went out of their way to make sure someone was safe or okay. Sally had spent part of her savings in order to get Draco some Xanax since he blew all of his money on that coke. He had always been taught that kindness was weakness, and that was why the muggles were so weak: they didn’t know when to be selfish. When the war first ended, he spent a lot of time being confused. He didn’t know what to think about muggles and muggleborns and half-bloods. He didn’t know what to think about Dumbledore and Hogwarts. He didn’t know what to think about the Death Eaters or Harry Potter or even all of the bloody things that happened to him as a result of his father’s “career.”
"I'm almost done with auror training!" Ron announced. "All I need now is the practical internships. I'm completely finished with all the theoretical stuff. I even passed the exams with flying colors!"
“Oh, well, that’s alright. We’ll just order some more simple stuff until you get help. What beer do you have?” Longbottom replied.
When it was time to finish cooking dinner, Harry just wanted to skip the entire event. He would have, but he knew that Andromeda was counting on him. He wanted to make her proud. By 4:30, he gathered up his wits and changed into his favorite green sweater. Since his Hogwarts days had finished, he’d grown fond of the color.
in her arms. He shook his head and pouted. Draco wanted to roll his eyes. Why couldn’t children behave? After all,
Harry woke up with a start in his sweat-drenched bed. Running his hand through his messy hair, Harry got up and promptly located the “List of Affirmations for Abuse Survivors” that his therapist gave him.
that I couldn’t do it. I took the offer anyways. Mother didn’t want me to: she was so scared that I’d die and asked me if that’s what I wanted…”
‘It was the last night of the siege, but we did not know that – how could we? We were so certain that we would die fighting to our last breaths. How frightening it is to imagine now, for we were children! You were the younger students in the most secure part of the castle we would find, do you remember? Colin was supposed to help guard the room, but he slipped out – he joined us.
Jane only laughs and waves Lizzy’s request away. Harry and Jane have their suspicions of Darcy, which Draco would encourage with amused smirks. Hence, it comes as a surprise to everyone else, including Lizzy, when Darcy proposes to her while they are on a walk from Netherfield to Longbourn. Lizzy has been meeting the gentleman by coincidence frequently on her walks through the neighbourhood, much to her consternation.
at him, emanating confidence and assurance and acceptance. Harry doesn’t doubt in the slightest what will happen when they meet again, as if he has already drawn an inevitable conclusion.
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a few families with whom the Bennets are particularly intimate: the Weasleys, the Lovegoods and the Diggorys. The four families bear a long history with the area, their ancestors having settled here long before, as Mr. Bennet is fond of saying, the Muggles invaded. The principal reason for the phenomenon is the land being rich in magic, a quality that has long served to draw wizards and magical creatures of all creeds to the spot.
‘Well, I’ll find out later, wouldn’t I?’ Zabini shrugged, stuffing the note into his pocket. ‘Wait a minute, why aren’t you in the Prefects’ compartment? Shouldn’t you be Prefect-ing or something?’
Malfoy, but he did not want to see how the war had ruined him. He refuses to speak of the war with Malfoy not so much because he thought Malfoy still culpable for his crimes, but because he does not want to know why Malfoy still flinches when someone approaches him from behind unexpectedly. He does not want to know what Malfoy’s nightmares are … Not yet. Not when Harry has yet to expunge
And he felt it: a connection as tangible as iron chains. Even now, he feels the awareness of another soul other than his own, weighing heavily on Draco’s wrists. He doesn’t know how he looked to the other boy, who doesn’t seem aware of Draco in the slightest, but he was clearly shaken enough for his parents to question him with concern. He couldn’t explain it to them, not how something like a crystal bell has chimed in Draco’s chest at the sight of another boy, and it is a sound that continues to echo in his ears.
The man gurgled, blood bubbling from his lips. Draco threw him down onto the ground, bloodied strips of skin and hair hanging from his claws. Theo stared up at him, his mouth half-open, one eyeball sliced open and bleeding. Draco stood above him, the monster Theo had created and the death Theo had summoned for himself.
There was a splinter in a part of Harry’s chest he thought was dead. He swallowed his biscuit, dry as dust. This was why he didn’t bloody want to come back to Hogwarts.
Bingley calls on Harry a few days after the ball, accompanied by Darcy and Malfoy. The gentleman has scarcely sat down when he enquires after Harry’s sisters, looking towards the open door eagerly. Lydia giggles at his artless approach, as Mrs. Bennet hastens to assure that the other Bennet sisters – her
Theo bent over, and neatly plucked it out of his grasp. He knelt next to Draco’s head, and forced Draco’s head up by yanking on his hair. Spit landed on Draco’s face, warm and wet.
A hand grabbed onto Draco’s wrist and his arm was nearly wrenched out of its socket as he was hauled onto the back of the broom. Draco immediately wrapped his arms around Potter’s waist, his chest flush with Potter’s back, clinging onto this solid weight in his arms.
‘Why?’ she asks, peering down at him past her list of names. ‘It doesn’t make much of a difference when you go, since the Sorting Hat only takes into account the individual.’
They lapse into silence for a while, and Draco, unable to bear looking Potter in the eye for too long, returns his attention to the passing landscape. After a few moments, Potter sniggers.
‘It is silly for one to assume that there are impossibilities,’ Hermione rebukes. ‘Why, simply cast your eyes at the man I now call husband.’
Harry looks at him when he doesn’t respond, and crooks a half-smile, pushing up his smudged glasses. ‘Not the right time to star-gaze, I reckon.’ He leans against the stone balustrade, gazing down at Hogsmeade, which Voldemort has made his headquarters. The village is burning, painting the horizon with a smoky orange smudge.
‘I’m Harry Potter. Sirius is my godfather. He and Remus Lupin raised me,’ he says. ‘Am I really alive?’ He looks down at his grey skin, flipping his hands over. ‘What did they want with me?’
Harry looks up cautiously, and blinks at the sight of Minnie’s face. She is crying, her tears pouring down her cheeks. She kneels, so that they are eye-level, and places her warm, heavy hands on his shoulders.
Dinner passed in a flash. They chattered about their day, about the Hogwarts Ball happening in three weeks, about some of the most outrageous prejudicial comments Wesley and his supporters were spouting. Luna had even succeeded in eking a rare laugh from Zabini, causing Parkinson to regard her rather jealously. This prompted Luna to rather matter-of-factly say that while she thought Zabini was very handsome, she was dating the very lovely Hannah Abbott at the moment.
Harry jumps up to his feet and strides to the stove, his heart pounding hard, his blood hot in his veins. He finds no inspiration in the cast-iron pans or the dried herbs he has forgotten to throw out, and spins around again, striding back to the armchair. Draco watches him silently, accusingly.
Draco cannot move, not even his mouth. His blood is cold in his veins, and his lungs are straining with screams that cannot be heard. The man’s hand tightens on Draco, and as he feels the sickening squeeze of Apparition, he hears Pansy scream. When the darkness releases him, he is in a new place. Draco smells the closeness of the dim room, the smell of rotting food, and the reek of rotting food.
Snape slashed his wand to the right, rending the air apart violently; the wall in front of him cracked, the floor shuddering.
echoing across the room. He was pinned to the ground, hurting all over, his breath rasping in the cramped space beneath the heavy desks. He didn’t dare move, knowing that he could send the whole mess collapsing around him again. His legs were trapped and his right arm caught between two desks, his wand lost. He licked his lips and tasted salty blood.
He had not known how Potter loathed wasting food, and would level you with a frown if you didn’t finish what was on your plate.
‘I didn’t want to tell you like this,’ Draco says, voice fraught with emotion. ‘I had a plan—it was supposed to be romantic—but you are so angry with me now, and I know you want to leave me. I
Draco releases his hold on the sill, and drops into the bushes two storeys below, branches snapping beneath his weight. He rolls as he lands, spitting out leaves and twigs. Returned to his human form, he lies in the bushes, his arms and legs spread-eagled around him. He stares up at the grey, cloudy sky, his skin covered in goose pimples as the wind ripples through the quiet grounds of Malfoy Manor.
‘A little more,’ Potter whispered breathlessly, nipping at Draco’s neck. He had taken Draco and pinned him against the wall of the cupboard by his wrists.
Draco’s Dark Mark seemed to flare up in response to Zabini’s words. He forced a laugh, ignoring his throbbing arm. ‘Well, who cares what he’s interested in? What is he, when you come down to it? Just some stupid teacher. I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year, what’s it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?’
, most of his books said about Veelas. Draco Malfoy is certainly beautiful, but Harry is baffled how beauty can cause a person to lose his mind. He suspects it may be one of those
Thomas and Finnigan exchange mischievous glances, and simultaneously turn to Harry with startlingly amused grins. ‘Only a gentleman who has mysteriously vanished at the end of the war,’ Thomas says. ‘A certain blonde gentleman you were very much
She looks down at the dozing baby, her gaze now more reverent than before. Narcissa and Lucius are beta themselves, and their families have disappointingly lacked for alpha heirs in the past two generations.
‘Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?’
And Draco knew it was over. So this was how the world ended. Not with green light, not in fire or flood, but with words, coldly spoken. Gently, he detached himself from Potter’s grasp and stood up. He smiled at her mockingly, spreading his hands open. ‘Well, Granger? Aren’t you going to hex me?’
Back then, it felt like he has been left behind. Amidst the stresses of the Death Eater attack at the Quidditch World Cup and the Triwizard Tournament, Harry couldn’t handle knowing that his best friend was hiding secrets from him. It took Ron and Neville locking them in the dorm together for Harry to start talking to Draco again. Harry decided then that he doesn’t care to hear details about Draco’s sex life – ever.
enough?’ Snape repeated, his words ice-cold. His eyes were two shining pools of black in the reflected light of Jackson’s wand, somehow more opaque than the surrounding shadows.
People stared as Draco made his way down the platform, flanked by Goyle and Crabbe. The Hogwarts Express gleamed scarlet, the steam carrying whispers from the crowd: ‘His father … a Death Eater … runs in the family … evil git …’
Voldemort shrieks, an assault of sound scraping against their minds, and everyone collapses to the ground, clutching their heads. His hands against his ears, eyes watering, Draco lies crumpled in the dirt, as Voldemort descends upon Harry, who is the only person standing—right in front of Draco. He doesn’t understand what he is seeing: Harry stands with his wand down by his side, his hands loose. He looks like he is merely waiting.
Harry immediately swivels around to look at Minnie, his hand flying to his pocket heavy with coin. They have just left Gringotts—he was absolutely fascinated to meet goblins for the first time in real life. He has read so much about the amazing feats their people have accomplished throughout history, and the complicated relationship between goblin and wizard.
Potter takes hold of Draco by his other arm too. ‘I know what they did to you. Snape showed it to me.’ His voice is gentle, even if his eyes are obdurate. ‘I know about
Harry hesitates, looking at the stairs. He hears Moony and the school nurse talking, and there is movement. He tenses, his shoulders drawing up to his ears, thinking that they are bringing Sirius down to the kitchen, but he hears them moving up the stairs instead. He exhales, glancing askance at Dumbledore, wondering if the old man sees how much of a coward Harry is being, because the very thought of seeing Sirius, bloodied and broken, makes Harry nauseous.
“sister. He is my nephew,” she sighed and became interested in her dinner plate. “Perhaps I should write to her.”
“Hi, Davie,” Harry said. “I am nineteen years old, and I’ll turn twenty on the thirty-first of July.”
“Well, you’re almost finished with your first semester, right? Do you know what you want to do yet?”
“Oh,” Harry said. He averted his eyes in disbelief. How could someone manage to bring up two touchy topics in five minutes?
“Harry, is everything okay?” Andromeda asked. Teddy was sitting on her lap, and her sister Narcissa was sitting to her right.
When Harry apparated to his university’s campus, he arrived right next to a theater group’s small presentation. They were supposed to be the four horsemen: black capes, masks, and scythes. If one didn’t know any better, they might assume that these were Death Eaters. So, Harry just walked on and ignored the pangs of nervous sweat that ran down his neck.
Harry softly chuckled. At least he wasn't the only lost one. He glanced at Draco's face and saw that a piece of hair was stuck in front of his eye. Harry fought the urge to move it.
Aware that he could not possibly avoid the thankful onlookers, Harry kept his head up while he shopped. He wasn’t going to hide— and maybe, just maybe, his dad would be proud. He wondered if that would cancel out his assumption for Dumbledore’s feelings, but then filed the thought away. Once at Honey Duke’s, he bought chocolate frogs and Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans and licorice wands and fizzing whizbees and cauldron cake. Harry wanted this Halloween to be amazing for Andromeda, yet he also wanted to please Draco and Narcissa. He did not know why he was so worried about that.
He was about to slip on his coat when he heard Andromeda say, “Harry, black shoes, black tie, and brown belt? Shoes, tie, and belt
on the board and gave Harry a dry-erase marker. It was his turn to teach. He was surprised that his nervousness was pout of excitement and not dread.
he thought. He laid his head down. Now he understood why his father hated pronouns. It was so hard to tell who “they” was in this thought even though he was the one doing the thinking.
Harry sent an owl to McGonagall, and they had scheduled a meeting for the seventeenth of May. He had fifteen days to go before his life changed—again.
She nodded and held up her left hand. A golden ring, topped with a ruby, glittered in front of Harry’s eyes.
The snow was pouring down rather heavily for early December. Harry had checked the weather before going out, but he really did not expect six inches of snow. Now, because he insisted on continuing his plans, he was being scolded by a blond drama queen.
, yes. I had a bloody house call, and I had to break up a domestic dispute. Like I'm a bloody auror or a police agent. I'm neither of those!" She pressed her palm against her forehead, as if warding off a headache. "It's the end of the hour, and you're my last case. I'm going to go home and drink an entire bottle of some bloody elf wine." They laughed together and stood up, walking out the door. He signed out of the office and apparated to Manchester.
"Come on," Harry picked the screaming child up and marched him to his bedroom. He came back promptly after setting the toddler down.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While he waited for Teddy to wake up, he vacuumed and mopped the floors, dusted, wiped the counters, and cleaned all the expensive china that they'd use. Teddy woke up crying—something about a nightmare about Ursula from the Little Mermaid. Harry ran to his room and scooped him up. He could, after all, relate to the toddler.
o’ me,” Darren yelled, clearly extremely inebriated. “What the fuck you lookin’ at, fag?” Darren turned to Draco and lunged forward a bit, as if he was going to fight him with handcuffs on and police holding onto him.
Draco snorted, “Nope. They claimed that they were, but then they tried to set up an arranged marriage for her. She almost went along with it—y’know, to produce an heir, which was not only super cissexist, but also fucked up—until the story was leaked.”
“Expelliarmus!” he heard. He moved out of the way and ran through the next door. The room didn’t change at all except there was only a small table and two chairs instead of the other furniture that the last room had. Harry stepped through it slowly. He felt a weird tingling in his legs, similar to what he felt the other night at the University.
Most importantly, he wanted to tell someone. Which meant that he defied all stereotypes. Weren’t you supposed to find out that you were gay or bi or pan or something when you’re five? And aren’t you supposed to be terrified of coming out?
Yet, this Monday was going to be different. He knew because that’s what he’d promised himself. Starting today, Harry was going to pay attention and participate in class. Really, he would.
“Well, a few reasons…I think that given our history in Hogwarts, we always had a rocky…we were always…well, we bullied each other. There’s also the matter of our places in the war: I was a Death Eater and you were ‘the Chosen One.’ Also, our…our friends—well, your friends. I don’t really… Lastly, the press would flip shit.”
"It was no problem. I wanted to get you something nice. Besides, if you have a watch, we might not be late for class anymore," Harry joked.
About an hour and a half later, the brownies were cooling, Teddy was awake, and Harry and Andromeda were making icing from scratch. Two hours from the party, Harry went to his room so that he could finally get ready. He wasn’t going as anything special—just a pirate. However, Harry wanted it to be amazing, so he’d bought a full outfit, an eyepatch, a fake beard, and eyeliner. It took him thirty minutes and four tries, but his makeup was finally perfectly messy.
“What do you like to do, Harry? Who are you? You don’t have to be the Boy Who Lived anymore. Have you thought about your hobbies? Interests? Sexuality? Short-term goals?  These are all very important to your identity.”
“Nor that I attempted suicide. Nor that I told her that I’m homosexual. Oh well, she’ll get over it…”
“Of course it’s okay. It’s just…” Harry cleared his throat and said, “You’re not...making this too scary, are you? I’m-I’m not the only one who has been affected by death in the past year and a half— Merlin knows— and I don’t want anyone to be frightened. Especially not Draco and Narcissa because they lived with Voldemort and all and-”
Andromeda nodded understandingly and said, “If you don’t mind me asking, what was going on during the war? Your mother won’t…she doesn’t like to talk about it.”
His high had only gotten worse, and he’d been so fidgety and jumpy that Sally had asked him if he wanted to take the night off. He ended up sticking it out for the entire night; however, he had almost lost his cool when one drunk customer decided to curse out the entire crew working that night. It was only Draco and Sally since Darren had called out last minute due to an “illness.” Draco promised himself that he’d kick Darren’s arse next time he saw him.
"Better," he responded. They locked eyes, and Harry moved in to hug her. He laughed. "Merlin, I was worried that this would be too strict."
.          Draco peered up at the small, pink-haired child with his sticky fingers painfully grasping the blond hairs. Draco
“I want to get her a matching necklace and earring set,” Draco informed him. “Ironically, she’s not really a snake person. She likes unicorns. I think that she fell in love with thwem after our Care for Magical Creatures classes…”
At that time, a few people dropped their bags, half-walked--half-jogged towards Harry, and attempted to shake his hands. He tried to play along, for some people craved his touch as if he could heal the sick and save the dying. Several more simply gasped and stared at the scene— unable to comprehend Harry’s presence. He quickly gave out hugs and handshakes and even posed for a few photos. Soon thereafter, he departed the scene and paced to Honey Duke’s.
"Hogwarts was an escape for you from your abusive family. Magic was an escape from bullying and being an outcast. Sirius and Remus were escapes from your…lack…of family connections. All these things, Diagon Alley, Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, magic, Hogwarts…. these have all been coping tools for you. And you've been devastated when they haven't been exactly what you wanted or expected. There was still abuse and hatred and racism in the wizarding world. There was still manipulation and untrustworthiness in authority figures. There was still loss and death. I mean…" She threw up her hands and quickly clasped them together, as if scared of Harry's reaction to this information. "I mean look at how quickly you forgave Severus Snape. You look for the best in people, which isn't wrong!" Harry wanted to protest this. He wasn't looking for the best; he was looking for the objective truth! "When you found out about Dumbledore's past, you were crushed, weren't you?" He nodded. "You got angry. You had an episode. Then you got even angrier when Ron and Hermione didn't fully agree with you. You forgot about Dudley's bullying and Snape's abuse when they did one little nice thing."
” he exclaimed. He looked around and lowered his voice, “Clocks aren’t supposed to change in dreams. They’re supposed to…well, they’re supposed to be weird! Am I not fucking dreaming? What is going on?”
Before school on Tuesday, Harry went to his counselling centre. He sat in the waiting room, but his therapist came through almost immediately.
Within fifteen minutes, twenty students were sitting patiently. None of them took their eyes off Harry. Finally, Ms. Claire announced, “Okay, class. This is Mr. Potter. He’s going to help me out from now until lunch.”
"I know," she said. Her voice developed into the "look at me I'm sympathetic and I understand" tone that she always appointed when trying to calm him down or explain something. "It must be awful for you to have to forgive everyone." She paused. "This is what we call 'abused kid' behavior. Feeling like it's
When he arrived at the university, he felt like he was in a different world. He’d spent so long assimilating to muggle life, yet he was still attempting to grasp an understanding of muggle reliance upon household appliances and cars and the like. He felt terrified of the university. He swallowed the fear back and searched for a different feeling: adrenaline. He’d always been a fan of adrenaline. It felt like every drug he’d ever done but more natural. A few people stared at him as he just stood at the university entrance. He sighed and walked towards the admissions building.
Harry had had some say in the renovations, perhaps more than he should have. He ultimately left it up to McGonagall, the professors, and the renovation crew, but he knew that he’d have to get involved when they mentioned including a massive panorama dedicated to Harry in the Great Hall. He’d managed to convince them that all he needed, and much more than he wanted, was a small painting of his patronus. At least that way he could pretend like all of this wasn’t about him.
He pulled himself back to the present and kept reading the letters. It was 8 AM and he really needed to get to class.
It wasn’t that he was homophobic. He really, really wasn’t. He was just shocked. Neither Dean nor Seamus struck him as gay. And it wasn’t like he didn’t know it. He did! He was just…surprised. And shocked. And a little confused. Dean
The walk was relatively unlively and boring, yet he still made sure to check out every person he saw. He tried to convince himself that this stuff made a person paranoid and that he should focus on controlling his thoughts rather than his environment. Merlin, he was so worried about work. He started grinding his teeth. He had seen how Darren prepared drinks and spoke to customers; Draco would
“Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. I’m great. Just thinking. Y’know, thinking,” he replied. She stopped walking and simply just stared at him. He cursed himself for not stopping after the first “yeah.”
They walked around the city for nearly two hours, stopping inside game shops and thrift stores. There was nothing really worthy of purchasing, but that didn’t stop Harry from buying an old Trivial Pursuit game and half a deck of Pokémon cards. At 7:30, both men decided that it was time for dinner. They located the nearest McDonald’s and went there. After receiving their food, they sat at a table that was farthest away from the other customers.
.          “Ahem,” she cleared her throat, “’Dear Andromeda,’ it reads, ‘I am terribly sorry that this letter has come late. I have been busy with my studies and with work in the past day; thus, I have not been able to dedicate the appropriate amount of time to replying to you. Thank you for reaching out to me. I also apologize for my behavior at the university. I was running slightly late for work, and I had to get there as quickly as possible. I would, in fact, enjoy possibly meeting you at some point. The specifics of that meeting shall be up to you. Lastly, you will find a second, smaller enclosed letter in this envelope as well. Thank you. Yours truly, Draco Malfoy.’” Andromeda paused and took a breath.
Around late July of 1998, Harry moved in with Andromeda and began to assist in caring for Teddy. It was strange, as Andromeda has insisted on only speaking French around the infant so that he would grow up to be bilingual (a Black family tradition). As such, his only company until September was Andromeda, Teddy, Hermione and her family, the Weasleys, Neville, Dean, and Seamus.
Draco arrived to his SALC class about ten minutes before it was supposed to begin. He, and a handful of other students, obvious over-achievers, waited outside the door for the previous class to end. After the doors opened and the previous students left the classroom, Draco watched as the students standing with him chose seats closest to the front. He sat in the back, near the door. He liked the idea of being able to escape if something were to happen. He didn’t know why he still thought like that.
.          After calming Teddy down, they sat at the table and fixed their plates. It wasn’t until about twenty minutes later that Andromeda brought up the subject they seemed to both be avoiding: Draco Malfoy.
Harry soon decided to stop waiting by the door and started to socialize. After talking to the Weasleys for ten minutes, he and Ginny set off to converse.
Nearly two weeks had passed. In that time, Draco had told Narcissa (successfully, from what Harry knew) and Harry had scheduled a double date with Hermione and Ron for the thirty-first of the month. It was now 7 PM, the seventeenth of March. As an attempt to make their relationship more serious, Draco invited Harry to his apartment. Harry now stood outside the door of Apartment Thirty-Three C, preparing to knock. He tapped the wooden door twice with his knuckles and was greeted by Draco.
“Well, semi-coercing him…” she corrected herself. Then she admitted, “Draco hasn’t been well since after the war. He has been dabbling in muggle drugs and alcohols-“
.          “Wha’s a arse’ole?” Teddy asked. Harry laughed when he saw the Caesar dressing in the toddler’s hair.
Happy Christmas to you, too. I hope that the scarf is keeping you warm in this cold weather and snow. I’m glad that Teddy is happy. My morning has been okay—thank you for asking.
If anyone has curiosity, I am leaving here the list of pairs for the dorms, so you know who is paired with who, and also who is returning for this year.
Bright light filled his vision. Light as bright as when he had been with Dumbledore in King's Cross. Had he made it? Had he managed to die? Could it be possible that he was finally free? He heard a feminine voice around him and, with a choked voice, he managed to say a strangled -"Mum?"-. Something was not right. His voice had barely come out, and it had hurt so much to say it. Being dead was not supposed to hurt and he realized that everything about him hurt. Did that mean that he was still alive? Could it be that his torture continued?
“Oh, Harry… of course you have me. I love you, you know that I always have, always will. Just like the Weasleys. Harry you have said it more than once, they are the first family that accepted you, the first place apart from Hogwarts where you felt home. Why is it so hard for you to believe all of a sudden that you are cared for and loved?”
“Thank you, Minister. First of all, I would like to start talking about Mrs Malfoy. I know what it's like to stand up for your family and friend, to do everything at your hands in order to protect them, to do things that may be considered crimes; after all, I have done some of those things. Mrs Malfoy only crime was to be on the wrong side of the war, nothing more. She was born in the, what some would call, the wrong side of the game. During this war, the only thing that Mrs Malfoy did was try to protect their family, through any means necessary. Yes, Voldemort lived at her home, but I would not wish that to anyone. She did not host him willingly; I saw it in her eyes when we found ourselves at Malfoy Manor while on the run. I saw the terror that lived within her, the fear she had of that madman. However, she could not leave as long as her son was in peril, she could not leave and leave his son at the mercy of a madman who would without any doubt torture him for her absence. So yes, Mrs Malfoy was involved, with Death Eaters, but let’s not forget that she was not one. Let’s not forget either, that Mrs Malfoy deflected during the battle of Hogwarts, and helped us win against Voldemort. Secondly, I would like to talk about Draco Malfoy. Everyone here knows, that I am a muggleborn, that is no news to anyone, just like it is no news that Draco Malfoy is a pureblood. Who our parents are should not matter, but sadly, in this world, it does. In the muggle world, instead of blood, what people judge is the colour of your skin; if you are black-skinned, then you are inferior. But why is that believed? We can clearly see the colour of the skin of our Minister, and we do not judge him for that. So why do we judge muggleborns and half-bloods then? I’m saddened to say that it is for the same reasons that muggles judge black people, and that is no other thing than tradition. A person is not born with judgment, a person is taught. If since you were born you have been taught that you were superior due to your blood, you end up believing that. It is a statement so ingrained in yourself that you do not question it, you just believe it. For that reason, since he was little, Draco Malfoy had believed that he was better than me, better than Harry, better than anyone who was not a pureblood; he did not question his believed, he was not brought up to question. However, as he grew older, he started to saw these beliefs crumble around him. Did being better justify all the tortures and killings that were happening around him? Wasn’t a killer supposed to be a criminal? Changing your views about a life-long belief is not easy, however, Draco Malfoy did. In one of our more crucial moments while on the run, Draco Malfoy helped us. He negated to identify Harry when brought disfigured in front of him, while you could see in his own eyes the recognition and the conflict between telling the truth and following his heart. While surrounded by his father, Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback, he made the tough decision to give a vote of confidence to Harry and our cause and lied about his identity. He saved Harry’s life by deciding to not identify him. Voldemort was about to be called as soon as he gave his affirmative response, however, thanks to his lie, Harry and Ron were brought into a cell, from which we could escape, therefore, making Draco’s act a lifesaving one. Thank you for your attention, your Honours, that is everything I have to say.”
At the beginning of the school term, Harry and Hermione had gone every Sunday to lunch with the family in the Burrow, but now, even Sunday lunch was missed by Hermione. She said that she lost too many hours of study if she went to the Burrow, because they spend there the whole afternoon, when in reality, even though she would not admit it, not even to herself, the thought of so many food was starting to make her sick, she could not stomach that much food, and after so many days of barely eating, the thought of Molly’s food made her stomach grumble in distaste. While in the run she had grown accustomed to eating scraps of food, and since the end of the war she had barely managed to stomach great quantities of food, and every time, she ate less and less.
“No, Ron, quite the contrary. Moreover, not only are we testifying for Malfoy but also for his mother.”
Everyone in the courtroom stood up waiting for the Minister for Magic, who presided the trial, to enter and take his seat.
Did you like the nightmare? I didn't know who to write it and I wasn't a 100% convinced about it, but I wanted this chapter to have a nightmare, and I really couldn't do better than that. So, how did you like it?
“I have the same feeling; I just have the feeling that a soon as I open it Fluffy is going to try and eat me”
“Draco Malfoy, you are accused of being a Death Eater. You are also being accused of plotting the death of the late Albus Dumbledore, as well as being an accomplice to his actual death. You are being accused of helping a group of Death Eaters to enter the grounds of Hogwarts thanks to a cabinet you repaired. Furthermore, you are accused of the near-death of your classmates Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley and of casting the Imperius Curse to Madam Rosmerta during your sixth year, as well as torturing younger students during your seventh year. How do you plead yourself?”
say anything, Hermione? Have you seen yourself? You are nothing but flesh and bones, and you are asking me why I didn’t say a thing about me? You must be
Once they had boarded, they cancelled the Charms and found an empty compartment alongside Ginny, Luna and Neville, who had also returned for his eighth year. Firstly, they just talked a little bit about their summer a how everything was back at home, but it was a too much uncomfortable conversation, due to all the loss they had been subjected to those lasts months, which made them lapse into a sort of uncomfortable silence until the Trolley Witch arrived. That seemed to break the ice for them, and they started talking about anything and everything like the old times. It seemed as if seeing the Trolley Witch made them realise that even though they had lost people, live went on, and therefore, they could not let the loss of their love once reign their future, live continued, and being there was just like the past years. Yes, they were all different, but at least for Harry, they were still the same.
“I guess that your letter more or less says the same, Hermione. So what do you think that we should do? Because I’m not certain whether or not we should help her…”
He was once again left alone in his room and wondering who would want to see him. Would it be just Hermione like the othher time, or would more people come? In reality, he did not care much for how many people came, he wanted to be left alone, but on the other side, he did not want them to keep suffering for his wellbeing, so he would endure this meeting, and then he would ask Madam Pomfrey to let him go home, so he could be alone at last.
“I love you too Harry” – she said quietly – “Thank you. I needed to hear that. Now let’s go, the Feast is about to start soon, and we do not want to miss the last sorting now, do we? Merlin knows you have already lost a lot of them, it’s about time we start changing the tradition, right?”
Once she had finished her statement, Minerva McGonagall was called to the stand, in order to give the last statement for the trial.
I hope that I can soon post the next chapter, hopefully it will be this weekend, but if it is not then, it'll be along next week.
“I get it ‘Mione, I do. Just like I could never go back with Ginny because it feels like we had to grow too quickly. You and I have had to go through too much, and I’m not saying that it has not been hard for the others, because it has, but I feel that the relationship that we had with one another will never be the same, my feelings have changed too much for them to be the same…”
When they saw them enter everyone stopped talking, and only one scream could be heard, that of Ron, who was running towards them, to embrace them just as Molly had done a moment before. Finally it was the three of them again, and Harry had not seen it before, but he had missed his best mate a lot. Once they had said their greetings, they started to talk about trivial things, just like old times, while they waited for dinner to be ready. Finally, they heard Molly call them to dinner, so they got up and went to the kitchen. When he entered through the door, he felt his whole world fall before him.
The next time he opened his eyes he realized that he no longer was in the Hospital Wing, but that he had been moved into a private room. Furthermore, he did not feel as much pain as before, he felt much better. When he was about to call for someone, because he was alone, he saw Madam Pomfrey come through the door of his room.
“Well, it’s just that we kind of had a fight, and he left the dorm room and I have not seen him since…”
As she was saying this, it was then that she realised that she had had the answer to finding Harry in front of her all the time, but in all her stress she had not realised it.
At hearing those words, Harry could not believe that so many people, and even Madam Pomfrey, had worried about him. As he was thinking about what he percieved as unbelievable, he started to feel more and more tired, and he went back to the realm of sleep with just one thought in his mind: "Maybe I should try, try to live for all of them and in the end, I may be able to live for me."
I'm so sorry for the delay... I tried to have it done before but life and school work got on the way.
“He did it out of selfishness Hermione! He is a git, and he does not deserve our help, not after everything he has done to us!”
“Really? I must say that it was truly unexpected to me… I did not expect them to want to invite us to dinner and even less want to celebrate my birthday. Merlin knows I, at least, do not want to…”
“What do you mean you have never been there? Then why has McGonagall told you to take us there” – said Zabini.
“What?! I thought that you would be living with the Weasleys now that you finally are with Ron… Is Ron coming too, then?”
“Oh, come on Harry! Merlin knows I would not have seen past that first Halloween had it not been for you two! So, don’t tell me that we would have been better without you, because we wouldn’t have. Just like you wouldn’t have been able to make it through if it had not been for us, and you know it. We needed each other then, and we need each other now.”
”; however, as she looked up, instead of seeing emerald eyes, she saw herself face to face with the chocolate-brown eyes of Blaise Zabini. She immediately started apologizing, not having meant to bother anyone, much less if they were probably on their way to pick their books to go to class, - ‘Oh my god, I’m so, so sorry I hadn’t meant to bump into you; I was just trying to see if I could find Harry or if anyone had seen him. Oh wait; have you seen Harry anywhere?” – she asked as she realised that Blaise might have seen him leave or knew where he had gone to.
Malfoy leaned towards Harry, clearly wishing to whisper; however, Harry stepped back, fearful of Malfoy’s obvious scowl.
“Well,” Andromeda started. “Narcissa and Draco have made up. I received an owl from her, and she is in happy tears. I don’t think you realize how relieved she is. My sister spent most of the past year worried about her son’s mental health. Nevertheless, I have decided to invite them over for the weekend. If that’s okay with you, of course.”
Two weeks had passed and it was now the beginning of October. Malfoy and Harry had sat next to each other in classes and did speak on occasion. Their friendship consisted of a mutual desire for respectful silence and careful understanding. It was certainly the strangest friendship that Harry had ever had— and not just because the friend in question was an ex-Death Eater, ex-bully, ex-traitor. Malfoy was probably the only person with whom Harry had interacted that didn’t talk about the war in a way that made it sound like some horrible historical event. He spoke about it in such a way that made it sound like a fact. And, in some way, Harry and Malfoy had an unspoken pact: if they both wanted to talk about it, they’d talk about it; if not, neither would bring it up.
