When I open my eyes, I see Harry looking at me with a smile as soft as the twilight drenching his skin.
"I think you are," he murmured as his son struggled some more, feeling his mind slip towards unconsciousness. Now, if only Albus would stop moving…
"Your belly wasn't half as big, I'd dare say," Molly said, waving her spatula. "Some exercise will do you good."
"Even though sometimes it doesn't seem like it?"
Malfoy sighed, looking tired, and finally nodded. "If that is your choice, I can barely argue with it, considering we've already put you through this ordeal of having to choose a different healer."
He watched as she poured herself another glass and swirled the dark liquid around, staring at it without replying.
Harry frowned, unsure if he was pleased that Malfoy was being humane or annoyed that his plan to irk the blond had failed.
Camilla paused in her monologue as they reached a hallway that looked familiar. Harry spotted the single, white door at the far back, and they made their way towards it. "The colour-coding was initially introduced to help the researchers save time in locating rooms, since there are so many identical-looking ones, and once they left, and we added more rooms and corridors, we continued to use the same system."
"So you're asking me to help you beat me?" Draco asked, amused.
Swearing under his breath, he listened intently, hearing a soft, scratching sound. He debated whether to go after the intruder or leave them be until he went and retrieved his wand and, after a minute of going back and forth, decided the latter was the better choice. A sharp rapping sound came from the living room as he slowly stepped backwards, but before he could turn and run up the stairs, an undeniably familiar squawk filled the quiet house.
"I know that," Harry said, sounding a little more defensive than he had intended, and Kingsley nodded.
"I never accused—" Buxley began, but Harry shot him a look, and he shut up.
She was reaching for the glass of water, and he helped her with it, placing it to her mouth and tilting it as she gulped down every last drop. She sighed, her eyes fluttering shut, and he Transfigured the cushion into a blanket, draping it over her and tucking her in.
Harry sighed again. "Well, anyway, I asked her if she ever intended to settle down, and she told me it wasn't on her mind just then, but it was all I could think about back then, and I realised that it just wasn't working out. I took the position of Head Auror, and we talked every once in a while about nothing in particular until she told me she wanted to focus all her energy on Quidditch and I said OK. And that was that."
He ran his free hand down his face and controlled his urge to sigh. "I thought you said you're coming back this weekend."
Harry laughed as she tossed her hair over her shoulder pretentiously and decided that yes, it definitely would do the wizarding world good to have Hermione Granger-Weasley in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
"Bloody hell," he hissed, stuffing his fingers into his ears as he strode out and down the stairs.
"Dad, wake up! Wake up!"
he asked, causing her to raise her eyebrows at him.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Yes, well, we'll talk about
Mr Simpson cleared his throat, looking somewhat confused by how tense the two were. "Er, if I may," he ventured, flinching when Draco glared down at him. "He couldn't have gotten that far; I'm sure there's no need to involve the authorities…"
Draco looked up at Harry, his eyes as wide as saucers, then plucked the note off the table and read it. He scoffed, then read it again, then scoffed again.
"Ah," Ron said, and Hermione smacked his arm. "Hey!"
Malfoy bowed his head. "And I am grateful for that."
"Alright, then. Send Buxley in here on your way out."
The Auror nodded as he collected the report Harry had just signed and filed it with the rest. "Yes, sir."
Kingsley nodded some more, and Harry shifted, feeling like Kingsley was there for more than he was letting on. Deciding to breach the topic skilfully, he walked to the coffee machine Hermione had got him when he'd first moved into his office. It truly had saved him more than once.
"You told me your nightmares were better," she said, her voice soft. "You told me they were gone."
"About Rabastan Lestrange's release? Yes, I got the order the day it was delivered," Harry lied easily. He hadn't gotten the court order, and, if Kingsley reacted in the way he expected, he was about to find out why. Not only had his earlier conversation with Neville been highly enlightening, he now knew that, as he had anticipated, his week-long vacation had done more damage than good.
"'Dunno," Harry said moodily as Hermione whipped around, her mouth falling open.
Harry nodded emphatically. "Deal!"
Everything was blurry, dark vignettes clouding the edges of his vision, and for a moment, he thought he saw something beside him shine. He blinked, and the light was gone, replaced by an odd symbol on the ground his bleeding palm had smudged, leaving him distraught and confused.
"Yes. Right. I'm very well, thank you." He cleared his throat awkwardly, reached for the glass of water, realised it was empty, and sat back in his seat, feeling like he was eleven again, waiting in Dumbledore's office and wondering what in hell to do with himself.
"Right," Neville said, taking a deep breath. "See you when we dock, sir."
"I was
She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him, and when she pulled back, her eyes looked somewhat moist.
"Yeah, I guess…" he trailed off, his heart pounding in his chest. His mind was pushing him to tell her about the nightmares and Antares, but he was forcing himself not to.
Harry offered the wizard a grim smile. "I hope so, too."
Draco grinned at his clever usage of words, but his mother didn’t seem as impressed. She handed over the notice, and he took it without needing persuasion. When she remained standing before him, he sensed she had something left to say and offered her his full attention.
Hermione laughed, shaking her head. "Harry told me all the time when the two of you were together how much you've changed. I've always regretted never having the chance to spend time with you because I was always abroad."
"Yeah?"
"I only exaggerated a
"Yes, well, not all of us can sleep as soundly as you."
"Harry—"
Harry grabbed his hand and said slowly, "Draco, that isn't a tattoo. It's a scar from when I was a child. You know that; I've told you."
“Do we haf to do thish right now?” Draco said and moved his lips up and down so it looked like a fish face. “I’m shleepy.”
Harry took a deep breath and braced himself.
Neville!" Harry snapped, casting an Imperturbable Charm on the door.
"A kidnapping?"
she was reacting that way and wondered if he would ever find out—or if he even wanted to.
"Justice is such a fickle thing, isn't it?" he whispered to himself, repeating Neville's words. Hermione rested her head against his shoulder and looped an arm through his.
"The promotion was very recent—"
"Hi sweethearts!" she laughed, kissing them on their heads. "Here, I've brought you all something."
Before Harry could connect two and two together, Malfoy said, "My mother was originally a Black before she married my father and took on his family name. She and Sirius were second cousins."
"What? I can't hear you! Wait, let me call you back!"
, she says," Ron laughed, pecking his wife on the cheek. "Even though you're a Muggleborn."
Before he could reply, the line went dead, and he stood staring at the blank screen. A few minutes later, as promised, Ginny called him back, and this time it was much quieter.
Harry stared at her as she took off the scarf and placed it in her bag. In all honesty, he was still stunned that the person who'd responded to his letter was this very attractive blonde instead of the rather lumpy, balding, ordinary looking wizard he had imagined her to be. She had signed the letter as
"Why would they imprison their prince?" Harry had asked innocently, and Draco had simply glanced at him through half-closed eyes, offering nothing more than an endearing smile.
"Right." Harry hugged her briefly and clapped Ron on the shoulder. "Thanks again."
I grimace, not wanting to have this discussion, but I decide that I may as well be honest since it's come to that. "Well, yeah, I suppose so. But it's also just…" I wave a hand vaguely. "The way you smell."
Buxley hefted up his pants and nodded. "Sounds like a plan. I'll send Mason your way once he's back."
Stepping into the Floo, Harry stood between the two boys, making sure that both were holding on to him, and with a final wave to Molly, threw down the Floo powder.
"Why don't you go spend the afternoon over at Ron and Hermione's? You haven't seen Ron in a while, yeah?"
"I was looking for the lift. Bloody corridors are like a maze."
"Get—help—now," Neville gasped as he continued administering CPR, but Harry knew the man couldn't be helped.
“That’s what you say about all of them,” Draco muttered, but his mother only smiled in reply.
Harry hummed in thought as they made their way to the largest of the rooms—the one with the skylight. Audrey was telling him about the schedule and the other staff members and stuff, but he wasn't really paying attention. He'd sort of just up and decided to come here because of Ron's Fire-call, not actually because he'd wanted to enrol his children right away. Besides, he hadn't yet discussed anything with Ginny, and he knew she wouldn't be too thrilled if he made a decision as important as this without her.
Although it was just something I said in the spur of the moment, in order to appease my guilty conscience, Harry's blinding smile and glittering green eyes makes me feel like less of a terrible human being.
"A massage?" Harry asked, his voice still hoarse.
Lily nodded, looking up at him with big, round eyes. "Pwease?"
"I came because I was worried," she says without the slightest hint of concern as she looks around the still-empty room. "But I'm mostly here because your father asked a favour of me."
tell you whatever I can, but considering the delicate nature of the work I do—"
"Yes, we are. Hermione!" he yelled. Hermione stepped into the car and slammed the door shut with a huff. Harry stared at her, and she bristled but rolled down the window anyway and had a hushed conversation with her husband.
"I heard about it from Kingsley," Arthur finally said once the two were out of earshot. "Terrible, simply terrible."
Kingsley bowed his head slightly, and Harry shook his head. "I really don't understand your motives sometimes."
So, in an effort not to back down, he pushed up against Harry for a fraction of a second and turned his face towards Harry's so his lips nearly brushed the other's cheek before pulling away and holding the hairbrush out. "Don't take too long. I'll be outside."
She stayed for a while longer to ask about the specifics of the bouquet's arrangement and the flowers he would use, looked around the shop for said flowers—all the while keeping up a steady stream of high-spirited chatter—and finally left when he pointedly looked at his watch to remind her she had other chores to do.
"No, thanks. I've drunk a little too much tea today."
that which others longed to see. And this heartache and fear left him always wary and on-edge, unable to focus on anything but the flower arrangements he could lose himself in—the fragrance he could drown himself in.
Pansy drops by the shop later that week and laughs when I tell her that I take the bus everyday.
The Auror nodded again and left the office, leaving Harry to sit back and stretch. It had been a long, long day, and he wanted nothing more than to go home and collapse on his bed.
Harry looked up at the earnest expression on Neville's face and then swallowed thickly, taking another gulp of the Firewhiskey. "
"My dad always says never to take favours from people you can't pay back. I can't pay you back, Mister."
"I thought you were going to stop. Have you forgotten the promise we made?"
Death Eater," Kingsley said, an edge to his voice. "And it's the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement's decision as to who will or will not head the security force."
"He looks even worse than when I went to visit him," Neville said in a low voice as they followed close behind the group of Aurors escorting Lestrange.
he scolded himself.
His smile widened as he gestured to the wall behind him that was covered in photographs of his masterpieces. "Would I come off as sounding too arrogant if I were to agree?" he asked, although he was rather smug.
Harry's watch started to beep just then, and he realised that he had to leave then if he wanted to grab a quick lunch before he met Lisa. "I'm sorry, but it seems I've run out of time. Maybe we can both take some time to think about this and you can get back to me?"
Still unable to wrap his mind around the whole thing, he picked up the glass of water left for him and drank it slowly. He'd settled down remarkably fast after his momentary hyperventilation, and he didn't want to admit that it was thanks to Malfoy's quick thinking with regards to administering a Calming Draught. There was a bit of the potion mixed into his water, and he felt the subtle effect of it as he placed the glass back on the table.
Yet, why was he unable to feel anything when he thought back on them? Was he subconsciously subduing his emotions in order to protect himself from any hurt or pain? Did he just need more time to forget them? To forget
"Harry," Draco said, not bothering to conceal his annoyance. "I told you I'm busy. A big order just came in and I have no time to entertain the likes of you."
Harry exhaled, relieved, and nodded. "I owe you one."
"Nope, I'm done for the day. Why?" he asks as I turn off the lights and we exit the shop.
Malfoy shrugged. "Because you wouldn't be here if you wanted people to know, and I have enough pride as a Mind Healer to know when to keep my mouth shut."
They laughed at that, and Harry asked, "So, how's Germany treating you?"
Harry winced at what could've been an awkward faux pas. "Right. Should keep that in mind. Anyway, where are they?"
"Yeah. It got really bad at one point, and Gran demanded that I either go see a Mind Healer or have her dose my food and drink with dreamless sleep potions," Neville said with a wry smile.
He sat back and stared at his handiwork, feeling proud that he'd managed to take the first step. Nodding to himself confidently, he went about writing the rest of the letter.
"Well, the brother mustn't have been too happy about it," Neville mumbled, reaching for the Firewhiskey.
His wrists and ankles were bound by chains reinforced by condensed magic, almost making Harry feel sick when they passed by him. The rags he wore were filthy, as was the rest of him, and he was more bone than flesh. He looked like some of the rescued victims of human trafficking Harry remembered seeing in a documentary years ago. They'd looked so pathetic and pitiful that death seemed like a better evil than forcing them to live.
what gave you the right?"
"Hi, sweetheart! How are you?" Harry laughed as Lily barrelled into him, and he picked her up, twirling her around. "Did you miss me?"
"What's that?" he asked as he bit into a muffin.
The boy stared at the money wide-eyed, as though he couldn't believe what he was seeing. The voices drew closer, and Harry quickly stuffed the notes into the child's hand and ushered him down the alley. He watched as the boy stood rooted to the spot, staring at the money in his hands, disbelief clear on his face. Harry glanced towards the far end of the alleyway and spotted the suspicious figure once again. He turned away and picked up a pebble. Transfiguring it into a piece of paper, he pulled out his Self-Inking Quill and scribbled his name and number on it.
"Did yours get worse, too?" Neville finally asked in a strangled sort of voice, and Harry felt his breath hitch.
Ron scoffed. "Well, whoever else said it sure is wise."
"I found it!" she exclaimed, holding up a square of parchment.
"Boss?" Buxley's voice called as the door was slowly pushed open, effectively ending the moment of solitude. Harry turned to Hermione, noticed she'd fallen sleep, and pressing his lips to her hair, carefully extricated his arm from her grasp.
Harry shared a look with Hermione and then jerked his chin towards his office. She nodded and bustled off, muttering to herself.
then I only pray that the one you picked up shows extraordinary promise."
He sat down and wondered if he'd be able to catch some quick shut-eye when his deputy rushed inside, a pile of boxes in his hands.
"Miss Audrey's in the dining room right now, but she would definitely be available to show you around! Shall I open the Floo for you, sir?"
"Right."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't know if I should laugh at that or not," he said with a grin, and she finally looked up from her book.
Harry finished for him and suppressed his sigh with a smile. Their professions seemed to overlap in the strangest of ways, and just as it seemed like Malfoy could read his thoughts, it seemed that he could read Malfoy's thoughts, too.
"Robards needs to learn when to shut his mouth. Especially now that he's leading the undercover division."
There were more bookshelves lining the wall opposite the rest area, and even a small alcove of sorts at the far end of the room, on the other side, where pouffes and large, comfortable-looking cushions stood around a low table. There were several small teapoys and side tables holding dainty vases, and even a record player that played gentle, soothing music. There was also the same subtle scent of lilacs and sage that he'd smelled in the lobby the previous evening; it left him feeling calm and comfortable, and he assumed that was the purpose behind their use.
"Alright."
But if it
He suddenly realised that, in his panic, he hadn't even disguised himself, and a sense of terror gripped at him as he stared at the wizard standing before him. The shock left him immobile, and the only thing he managed was to gasp out a single word in question.
"Oh boy," I say, and after an inordinately long period of convincing and consoling, I finally manage to get him to agree to leave the pub.
He raised his forearm and looked at it, and just as Ginny had said, his skin was raw and bleeding, confirming the itch he had felt before.
"Yeah."
It still baffled Draco that befriending Harry had been so… simple. Although their personalities and interests differed quite a bit, their relationship so far was surprisingly easy and effortless. And Draco somewhat understood what Harry meant when he said he could relax around the other. Considering they had been two of the people tormented most by Voldemort, there was this sense of mutual understanding and acceptance that neither really had to talk about to get. It really was like they had succeeded in putting the past behind them and were steadily walking towards a future where a rejected handshake, years of bitterness, and a manic Dark Lord didn't matter as much as the fact that they could walk alongside like they were just then and just… be.
Harry shrugged. "It seems the most logical explanation. If this fellow disappeared right after his employers' deaths, it could be for two reasons: he either has something
"Who is this person who's so important that you can't cancel on them?"
Oh, good, I caught you in time!"
Lily and Albus immediately shrieked and took off, and he rolled his eyes as he walked to the wardrobe. "What's with all the hyperactivity so early in the morning?"
"Alright, mate. See you soon."
Harry handed over the silver key and watched with the usual fascination as the goblin placed it in the keyhole and turned it, causing the various locks and gears to groan and click before the door swung open with a grinding sound.
Buxley simply nodded, his brows furrowed in confusion as he led the girl out without complaint. Harry watched them go and, with the shake of his head, turned back to his paperwork.
"No, but, if she really
"Actually, Neville, I'd prefer if you'd pop in every once in awhile. Just so the rest of us know you're alive and well. Hannah's been complaining that you've been refusing to come home during the holidays."
Harry knew exactly how the boy felt; he himself remembered being seven and watching his cousin and the other children get tons of presents for Christmas, while he never got any.
I pause in my re-stacking to look at her. "If you're not here to help, get out."
"I suppose you, of all people, would understand what it's like to never know your parents because they were murdered in cold blood by a madman."
He nodded and turned away, allowing his men to go about preparing for the transfer. Neville walked up to him, and he looked like he would be sick.
"What just happened?" Harry asked at the exact moment Draco said, "Did you just read my thoughts?"
I clear my throat, thoroughly unhappy with the situation I was being forced to endure, but something about the way he smelt like happiness but looked anything but happy made me pity his plight.
"Er," Harry said, unsure of what was going on in the blond's mind. "Where to?"
Draco felt a dull ache in his side and absent-mindedly traced out the dips and curves of the bite mark scars that ran along his rib cage. “What about it?” he asked when Mr Palmer nervously glanced at him from over the rim of his glasses.
He sighed, deciding that he may as well finish off what little bit of paperwork he had left since he wasn't about to get any sleep that night anyway.
"For now," Draco said, sniffing. "My poor lad. What if the kidnapper is actually after me and decided to take my son hostage to punish me?"
Hermione turned to him and pulled off her sunglasses, her brown eyes swimming with worry. "Harry, is there something I should know?"
"Nothing. I've got Buxley looking into it to find out how true her little story about the stolen vase is, but beyond that, I've got nothing that could indicate that the vase even belonged to the Blacks, let alone that it was taken from Grimmauld Place and is a memento from the war."
"Who did?" Buxley asked, and Harry pointed at half the boxes.
"Give Neville my regards, and tell him not to—how do I put it—
She gives me a long, considering look before shrugging and spinning on her heel. "Well, I reckon I'll let your father know that there's no reason to concern himself over the wellbeing of his adult son leaving home to open a quaint flower shop in an obscure town."
as they ducked into the tight entrance, and they made their way to their beds quietly, not wanting to disturb the four others, who were fast asleep.
He scratched his chin as he looked around, sleep clouding his vision. Groaning softly, he stretched his hand out to turn on the table lamp when he heard some rustling from the side. He went rigid, now wide awake, all his senses focused on the soft sound coming from his left.
dinner, so I thought you had other plans."
"Harry? Can you hear me? What's going on? Where are you?" Ginny yelled, and he could barely hear her over all the disturbance in the background.
Harry reckoned he was Ryan, and with a clap on the fellow's shoulder, he wished him good luck and walked down the corridor. He knew Buxley would be seething and sulking for as long as he was hospitalised, but he knew better than anyone that the man understood the position he was in.
Weasley spluttered about
She nodded, caressing Lily's cheek. "Yeah." Ginny turned as Albus came and hugged her from behind. "Hey..." She ruffled his hair as he stared at the floor, his mouth puckered in a sad little pout. "Don't tell me big brother Al's going to cry, too?"
Regretting what he was about to do even as he turned towards the door and pulled it open, Harry still smiled widely and put on the most innocent look he could manage as he stuck his head out and said, "Malfoy? I thought I heard you out here. Sorry, I'm a little early, I wanted to—oh."
"Feisty this morning, aren't we?" Ron laughed, rubbing his chest.
"Alright boys, no fighting," Ginny said as she walked around them to where Harry was standing.
Harry jerked to the side and exclaimed in surprise. Looking up at him with the same intense blue eyes was the boy Harry was currently brooding over. There were crumbs around his mouth and dirt everywhere else. He looked like a street boy from the back alleys of London.
"You don't have to lie, just…don't tell him the truth," he whispered back, giving her a furious look.
"Sure. You're hail and healthy. Did Grandma give you your medicines?"
"Don't forget to take this, mate," he said, placing the box that Harry'd put down back in his hands and grinning at him. "I left Ginny one when I went over and tried to give her the ones for the kids but she insisted I speak with you first."
"Clumsy," Harry murmured, and Draco squeezed his eyes shut, willing himself to calm down. He knew what Harry was playing at—it wasn't the first time he'd pulled stunts like this—and he refused to let the other man win.
"You're very welcome," she said with a smile as she pulled him into a hug and patted him on the back. "Maybe I'll drop the girls off at the Burrow later this week so they can spend some time with their cousins."
"Lily—Albus—James!" Lily said, pointing to herself, Albus and James.
. You still haven't gotten to the reason why you wanted to meet with me, let alone the reason why you went to Azkaban to see Lestrange."
"We'll find him," Harry promised. "You have my word."
Happy New Year to all my readers! I hope you have a meaningful new year where you overcome obstacles and grow stronger and wiser from experiencing hardship.
"Hermione," he said, cutting her off. "If you expect me to stick to my word, I expect the same from you."
Draco tried to see what expression she had on her face but it was too dark to tell. "Who are you looking for?"
Tipping a substantial amount of the liquid down his throat, he returned it to its spot and lowered himself under the blankets, pulling it all the way up till his chin.
“Why, though?” Draco was still sceptical about Potter’s motives. His reasoning so far sounded like a load of hogwash.
Harry bowed his head and picked up his cup. "Fair enough."
"My grandfather told Erhard about the vase and that he suspected that whoever had killed my parents were after it. He said that it was cursed and that it had brought his family nothing but distress, in order to get rid of it. But instead of selling it,
"One moment, please."
Harry shrugged as he picked up his teacup, finished his tea, and replaced the cup on its saucer. "I'll probably just toss it back in the house, where it belongs, with all the other useless stuff collected over the years," he lied easily.
Harry arrived in the alleyway behind Malfoy's clinic, feeling somewhat conflicted over having to meet the blond again after so many years under less-than-heartwarming circumstances. Reporters were swarming outside the building, Aurors keeping them at bay, and he cursed under his breath, irritated that the media was already reporting the Auror Department's repeated failure at catching the criminal behind the abductions.
Draco glanced at the upside down headline of the article it was opened up to, not bothering to hold in his sigh of resignation.
Malfoy nodded, and Harry listened to the scratching sound of the quill against the parchment. After a long moment, Malfoy spoke up.
Harry felt a lump form in his throat and he smiled gently. "It's alright. Think of this as an early Christmas present."
"I don't care if I've to buy them cycles
that she had asked for my help—if that threatening message meant for my eyes only was any indication."
He had expected to be greeted by three energetic shrieks and his wife's warm smile, but all he saw was a quiet, empty living room. Sighing, he quickly heated up some coffee, slathered butter and jam on cold bread, and bit into an apple. He ate a muffin and drank some orange juice for good measure, but even though he was full, it felt like there was still an empty, gaping pit in his stomach.
Her nodded then turned to Buxley, holding a hand out to him as well. "I cannot thank you and apologise to you enough, Mr Buxley."
"Where's the fun in that?" he asked with a wry smile. "Well, I've stayed far too long. I'll have Robards contact you directly regarding the transfer."
She needed a break from their everyday life.
He would've preferred if Rabastan Lestrange had remained true to his former title—a Death Eater feared by all—than the sunken man, reduced to the state of a frightened, lifeless being whom one could only sympathise with. He felt no fear for this man. He felt no anger towards this man. All he felt was immense pity.
The boy stared at the paper with a dazed expression, and Harry tutted impatiently. He reached over and placed the paper in the pocket of the boy's shirt and patted it.
"That's a lad."
"Call me Harry," Potter said, squeezing Draco's hand.
"Harry…"
Draco blinked. It took him a moment to process what he had just heard, and he burst out laughing, forgetting all about needing to put on the snob front. Potter watched him in amusement.
Hermione chuckled, reaching out to take Harry's hand, and they stood smiling at each other for a few seconds before three knocks on the door shattered the moment. They dropped their hands as Ron poked his head in.
Hermione eyed Harry with a level expression and asked, "Is that why you agreed to help her?"
"Ah, I didn't have the time, actually," Harry admitted, belatedly thinking that he still found it weird that Malfoy addressed him as
Harry nodded to the Aurors, and they practically had to carry the screaming reporter out of the room. Harry knew to expect a scathing article regarding his inadequacies soon, but he would handle that later. The Auror who had come in with Harry, who was previously in charge of the case, came to stand beside him as he turned to regard the anxious parents.
Harry shrugged and ran a hand through his hair. "Been a while since I've received a threat."
"Ugh, Gross," Ginny said, and he pictured her scrunching up her nose, making him chuckle. "I'm sorry I couldn't come home over the weekend," she continued. "Things've been pretty hectic here."
"I was just wondering," Harry said when Audrey stopped speaking, "is it possible to leave my kids here for a day or two before we decide to put them here? Just to see how they react. The last school wasn't a very pleasant experience for them, so I just want to make sure that they fit in alright before making a decision."
Perching on the edge of the counter beside his desk, Harry shrugged. When Kingsley continued to watch him expectantly, he bit back a sigh and said, "I just thought it was time I took the family out on a well-deserved vacation."
"Oh," he said, feeling stupid. "No, I mean—I'm fine, now. I can Apparate on my own."
"Listen," the man says as he grabs me by the elbow and steers me to the closest seat. "Let me pay to get those cleaned—they look new."
He glanced sideways at her, surprised, and the Germans behind Padma shifted, as though getting ready to launch themselves at Harry and the rest.
"I thought we decided to
"Well, I didn't, so." He made an offhanded gesture with his hand.
"I…was just—" she blustered, motioning to the pile of party decorations and the rolled banner under her arm.
"Oh, yes." Audrey scrunched up her nose, looking appalled. "And I'm glad you did. It turned out that they had a lot of unscrupulous stuff going on, and the Ministry's threatening to shut them down."
"Oh, yes, you can, but that doesn't mean I have to be tempted," came Kingsley's diplomatic reply, and Harry grinned.
Hermione nodded, beaming, and Harry smiled at her. "Thanks a ton, 'Mione. You really helped us out."
"Well, the pub nearby should be opening soon, right?" I say before the saner part of me has a chance to berate my stupidity. "I'm done for the day anyway, so I could close early and we could head there, if you wanted…?"
His expression was unreadable as he stepped aside to let her pass. She hummed a little tune, twirling her wand in her hand, eyes never leaving her prize. Everything was going according to plan, just as expected. What she didn't expect, however, as she spun around with her wand raised, ready to rid herself of the last loose end, was the spell that hit her square in the chest, throwing her against the wall. As she slid to the floor, a menacing grin stretched across her face.
Crabbe was dead. Goyle was probably lying in some ditch, pissed out of his mind. Blaise and Pansy were off making merry together in France. And Theo… was now seeing a Hufflepuff.
"Ginny," he urged, and she pulled away, dropping her gaze once again.
He tossed the file on the desk and stood staring at it. After a moment, he picked up his Self-Inking Quill and circled Hertzfeld's name multiple times. Placing his palms on either side of the file, he leaned all his weight on his hands as he racked his brains, trying to find the missing piece of the puzzle.
"Dead or rotting in Azkaban," Draco finished for him, and Harry grimaced but nodded.
Harry cleared his throat, the awkwardness only growing, but Mrs Buxley didn't seem to notice as she kept talking. "That was the time Ryan had first declared that he was going to be an Auror. I was furious. I already worry myself sixk every single day over Jon, and I just couldn't imagine how I would survive knowing my boy was sharing the same fate." She shook her head. "But, like father like son, I suppose. My words fell on deaf ears, and Jon was ill around the same time, so I took my frustrations out on you."
"Never again," he groaned as Neville tossed him a towel with a sympathetic smile.
The three-year-old looked up at him with wide brown eyes. "But Lily only one person?"
"Alright, you lot, off we go!" Harry said with a grin, the kids' infectious excitement temporarily causing him to forget his concerns.
Harry didn't really understand the logic fully but nodded anyway. "Speaking of your patients, Mr—Draco," he said, the word feeling foreign on his tongue. "Did any of them know your son, personally or otherwise?"
"Take him away," Harry said, and the others escorted him out, leaving Harry and Draco alone in the room.
"Malfoy, sir. Just Draco Malfoy."
"It's November, Ron!" Harry said as he settled down in an armchair and draped the comforter over his daughter. "Anyway, where are your parents?"
"Hello? Harry?"
Crossing the street, he glanced at the glass front of a shop and was mildly startled by his own reflection. He'd almost forgotten that he was in disguise, and he grimaced as his hazel-eyed, grey-haired reflection looked back at him reproachfully. Shaking his head, he continued down the footpath and let his mind wander.
Draco watched them disappear around the corner before shrugging and making his way outside. He jogged over to his usual spot, peering around the tree and smiling at the sight of crossed legs before catching and composing himself. It wouldn't do to seem too happy at the prospect of rendezvousing with Harry.
Malfoy nodded, and Harry extended his hand. "Thanks again."
"Higher-ups giving you trouble?" Harry asked as he flipped through the memos Buxley had left on his desk.
He shook his head, unconvinced. His irritation was rising back to the surface, and he wasn't in the mood to listen to his wife lie to his face in the middle of the night.
Alarmed, he pulled out his wand and was just about to cast a Disillusionment Charm when Camilla appeared around the corner. She made a startled sound, and he grabbed her and pulled her towards him, pressing a finger to his lips. She looked up at him and asked in a furious whisper, "What are
Doling out a substantial amount of everything onto his plate, Harry dug in, ravenous. It didn't take him very long to finish the food and drink, and once he was satiated and calm, he stood and walked to the door. He pushed it open slowly, careful that he didn't make a sound, and peered down the hallway. There didn't seem to be anyone in sight, and he made his way down the corridor, keeping an ear out for someone.
Harry stared at Malfoy, sceptical. "Do you offer to sell
Draco was stunned. He didn't reply, trying to process everything she had told him. He couldn't begin to imagine the kind of pain she must have gone through to make her own parents forget about her, only to find out that they were missing. He could not have done what she had.
He couldn't help but grin at how Lily pronounced Fleur's name. She couldn't say
"No," Harry said after such a long pause that it took Draco a few seconds to realise he was answering Draco's question. "There's no point trying to reason with Ron when he's like that. This isn't the first time he's done this. He'll be back eventually."
"OK," Harry said slowly, licking his lips. "Can you tell me the name of this place, at least?"
She flushed, her face going red all the way to her hairline, and giggled in an embarrassed way. Harry smiled at her reaction. No matter how many years passed, it always amused him to see the way people reacted when he introduced himself. Almost every other time they never gave him a second glance, but the moment he told them he was
"No, no," Harry said, holding him by his shoulders. "Draco. Don't you get it?"
When he said as much to Malfoy, the blond agreed. "That would be the best course of action, for now. But, since we didn't really get much done today, would it be alright for you to come back tomorrow?"
He raised his eyebrows at the snarky reply, and she sighed, massaging her temples. "Sorry, I just… I guess it's the stress of the tournament getting to me."
“Draco.”
Malfoy stood up and came around the table to stand before Harry. "May I?"
Then, just when everything was going a little too well, his mother had passed in an accident, leaving him all alone with nothing but flowers surrounding him, overwhelming him with their vibrancy and pungent fragrance, leaving him unable to look at a rose without thinking of her, lying in a pool of her own blood. He had distanced and isolated himself from everyone and everything, unable to cope with the sudden loss.
"We… uh…"
"I've never been there, but I've heard of it."
Draco Malfoy and nobody can know you live in a little townhouse in London?"
Harry almost asked him if he was referring to just now or something else, but Malfoy had already brought over the tea and poured him a glass, as per usual.
"Morning, lads," he said as he entered the conference room whose back wall was covered with information regarding the Floo disappearances.
"Why not?"
"Well, I did all I could in this department, I would think. Now it's time I took it up a notch and do other things that would help in the betterment of the wizarding world."
"Who's it from?" Ginny asked, stroking the owl and smiling as it tittered happily.
Hermione was staring at him with a slack-jawed expression, and he leaned back in his chair, unable the wipe the grin off his face.
"Which is exactly
The blond bowed his head. "Of course, you are free to refuse; you are under no obligation to accept my offer." Then, as though to himself, he added, "Perhaps it's because you're my first client in a very long time. It's been a while since I took a case, you see."
Inhaling deeply, Harry began to speak before he could change his mind, "Actually, I'm a client of Camilla's. We've been corresponding for a week, now, and I've met with her twice, in order to sign agreement forms and the like. Our sessions haven't started officially, yet, but she was the first person I thought of, and…"
He stared at it for a long moment, regretting what he was about to do already, and, with a shrug, brought the mug to his lips.
"Yes, well, I wasn't about to just let you leave without saying anything. I see I was right in knowing you would." She gave him a dirty look, and he rolled his eyes.
"You're
had some well-deserved fun." She placed a pair of dark sunglasses on her nose. "Now, will you drink that and enjoy yourself or keep moping around for the rest of the trip?"
"Sir," Morrison said, his expression grim. "We just got a new lead."
"Yay!" came the rejoicing yells, and he laughed as he revved the engine, and they took off.
"While I do like being admired, it's still a tad embarrassing if you do it so blatantly," Draco said with a telltale sign of his trademark smirk.
Buxley nodded thoughtfully. "That explains it, then."
"Didn't have a choice." He crinkled his nose. "Apparently finishing my education is all my mother cares about."
He woke up screaming for mercy, legs flailing and hands clutching his throat. Spluttering and sobbing, he jumped out of bed and crawled to the corner of the room. He pressed his back against the cool wall and heaved, throwing up all over himself. Sobbing and gagging, his eyes frantically searched the room, tears streaming down his face, and he swore he could hear the cackling of a madman.
Harry sighed as he stared at his reflection in the mirror and felt the coolness of the water against his skin. After a time, he turned off the tap and dried his hands and face, pulling the toilet door shut as he walked back into his office.
"Oh, it's no problem at all. What am I here for, if not to help the Head Auror successfully close cases?"
"But I hugged Daddy first," came Albus' muffled reply as he snuggled into Harry's chest.
He smiled as he kissed her softly, ignoring the retching and gagging sounds James and Albus were making.
Harry hummed, impressed.
Harry hesitated for a moment before he nodded. He shut his eyes as Malfoy reached up and carefully took off his glasses. He gripped the armrests tight, his heart beginning to race as Malfoy pressed his fingertips against Harry's temples. His fingertips were cool and soothing against Harry's flushed skin, but he still stiffened at the touch.
She smiled, and everyone nodded, already looking around. "If you happen to see him, please bring him to one of us," Astoria said, motioning to the three of them with a sweeping gesture. "Thank you so much for your cooperation; it is greatly appreciated."
"He's got a few more grey hairs just from babysitting them for two days. You think he can survive looking after all five of them on a daily basis
He shrugged. "You'd made these plans a while back, I'm assuming, and I know how important your friendship with Angelina is… besides, I can still take the kids out, though it won't really be the same without you."
The voices fell silent, the only sound permeating the unusually quiet night that of intermittent static, and he cursed his luck. Rounding the corner with his gun drawn only to see the tail of a disappearing shadow, he swore at his own stupidity. He barked his location into the handset as he sprinted down the seedy alleyway and turned right. Dodging upturned garbage bins, he took the first left and jumped over a broken fence, wincing as he felt a sharp pain on his palm from having cut it.
She slapped his arm. "I swear, Harry, couldn't you have shown
"It's Lilalbames Land!" Lily announced, waving a twig.
"If so, then allow me to say, your spell work has advanced magnificently. I'm quite surprised that you were the person walking beside Camilla yesterday."
There was a knock on the door, and he looked up as Ginny poked her head into his study.
James whipped around so fast he nearly tripped over his own two feet. He trudged towards Harry looking more than relieved, as though someone had been forcing him to play with his brother and uncle. "Dad," he sniffled, pressing a large wad of napkins to his nose. "I do'd feel do good."
"Daddy!"
After five minutes of him staring at her and her chewing on her lip, Harry decided that there was no point in trying to coax anything out of her. He had just arrived on the scene a few minutes prior and had been given a brief rundown of what had happened before he had spoken to her. He needed more information, but more than anything, he needed food. His temples were throbbing, and her unwillingness to speak up was starting to irritate him.
Ginny waved her hand vaguely and said, "It'll be easier to travel that way, plus I'll get better access to the other teams."
Audrey nodded. "What about Ginny? Is she still writing?"
"Yessir."
"I wonder how he feels," she murmured. "Neville, I mean."
Ginny came up behind him and hugged him, and he expected her to move away, considering he was still dripping wet, but she continued to cling on to him. He frowned. "Gin? Is everything alright?"
park on the road like that! Look at the mess you've caused!" she cried, waving her hand at the line of cars that were slowly coming to stop behind Ron's car—which was parked almost completely in the middle of the road—honking loudly.
Harry's smile widened, glad that she was still the same, bubbly, talkative person he knew her to be, as he replied. "Al is fine, but Lily and Jamie are down with colds. They were prancing around this morning before I left, though, so hopefully, they should be better soon."
"What's the fragrance you're using in here?" he asked, and she glanced at him sideways, her eyebrows raised.
"Why…" Harry managed, his mind still foggy, "why did you do this to me?"
"Git," Neville grumbled, and Harry laughed.
Harry and Neville nodded as Robards' face glared at them from the other side of the phone's screen. The older wizard grunted, shaking his head. "You lot can't stay out of trouble for one minute, can you?"
Harry rubbed his neck sheepishly. "I was so focused on getting to Malfoy's office that I forgot I didn't know where it was."
"You've cast an
Potter's smile finally lit up his eyes and dispersed the aura of tragedy clinging to him so quickly that Draco found himself flabbergasted. His racing heart confused him, and he was still trying to pull his hand away when Potter—no, Harry—said, "Thanks, Draco."
His plan had been to just tell her that, then gauge her reaction, and from the way she perked up and her eyes brightened, his suspicions were confirmed. He smiled and said, "So I want you to help me find him."
"May I?" he asked sarcastically, and she nodded, smiling.
"Sorry that I got you dragged into this," Neville leant towards him to whisper, and Harry shot him a look.
Harry threw his head back and guffawed as Ginny fumed. "How can I not laugh? That's bloody brilliant!" he said as she shot him a withering look.
Hermione, and it'll be even better if you could just stop
He had been under the impression that Ginny's weird behaviour had more to do with the fact that he had been tense and moody of late, or the stress from her work, and after their previous conversation, Angelina's birthday, for some odd reason, but the way she was acting was far too suspicious. Grinding his teeth, he turned back to his unfinished paperwork, pushing Ginny and their troubled relationship aside for the morning.
find him and help prove his innocence whether or not he, or anybody else, wants me to."
vase." Harry shot her a look, and Hermione sniffed. "I'm just clarifying."
"I'm sorry, I thought we'd gone over this countless times already—"
"I know." He raked a hand through his hair. "I suppose I'm just not used to not having you around to deal with everything."
"Do you know the Corinthia Hotel in London?" the blond asked.
Molly made a thoughtful sound as she bustled over to the kitchen. "Have you had something to eat yet, dear? I thought we'd wait 'til everyone got back, but if you're hungry…"
"You probably know by now," he said, a haunted look in his dark eyes.
Draco rolled his eyes and waved a hand in dismissal. "I really don't have time for this."
Draco thought about what he said. “So you pit—”
"It is, I'm sorry," Harry managed, and he could've sworn Malfoy huffed.
Harry had to admit that he was slightly weirded out by Malfoy's strange, over-friendly demeanour, so instead, he decided to change the subject back to something else. "When did you say the auction was, again?"
Realising that was his cue to leave, Harry stood up and made his way around the bed. "Get some rest, Buxley. I'll see if I can send Rogers 'round to visit later."
He expected that to placate her some, at least, but she only shook her head again. Frustrated by his inability to understand his own daughter, Harry wracked his brains, thinking of some way to resolve this issue whose cause he had no idea of.
He sighed.
"Sounds good, boss. Sleep tight."
"We are, sir."
He groaned. Trust Arthur to buy his seven-year-old son a
Just then, Harry and the forensics team leader, Lee, were standing by the far wall, and Harry was nodding as Lee pointed at the edge of the wall and made peeling motions with his hands.
She nodded, and he grinned.
Draco inhaled the smell of the freshly-baked goods and swallowed. He glanced up to see Harry watching him with an expectant smile. "I brought all your favourites," he said. "So you have no excuse not to finish every last crumb."
"Are you alright?"
Smiling, Harry waved his wand at the last bit of mashed potato and the casserole that was left from what he had bought for lunch, listening to his children's excited shouts from upstairs as they discussed the surprise visit to see their mother.
Shaking his head, he padded to the bathroom to get dressed.
He smiled, and she gave him a look. "What?"
Ginny reached towards Draco, puckering her lips, and Harry placed his palm against her mouth before pushing her back. "Easy there, tiger. What, are you already wasted? Nobody's even here yet!"
now, and the faster you finish up all of your—" he waved his hand, "—paperwork, the faster you can give up that uncomfortable chair of yours and get the nice, plush one. Plus, you've been covering for Gonsales for years now, so I only think it fair that he helps you this one time. "
Harry held his arms out, eyebrows raised. "Exactly. And I feel the same way. I'm dealing with my problems in the best way that I can, and I don't want you to keep trying to mother me."
furious. It reminded Harry of when he used to be an Auror in training and Buxley was his direct superior.
"I'm Agent Potter. I heard you brought in our perps?"
Buxley's eyes were so dark, they seemed to be bottomless, black pits. "So, you're telling me that even after I'm better, I still can't lead the charge on the front lines?"
"Yes. Thanks. Please go away, now?"
"Hello, Ginny?"
In his attempt to keep his nightmares at bay and handle them, he'd unconsciously been spending less and less time sleeping, and everything that had happened over the past week had just all come together and culminated in the huge blowout that had just occurred. Everything Ginny had said was right; they had both been too stressed out lately, he was just taking out his frustrations and inability to deal with things on her, she wasn't making it any better by being halfway across the country, and the kids falling sick and finding a pre-school on he own was the icing on the top.
Although he said that, Harry couldn't help but wonder how Malfoy
Taking the stairs two at a time, he all but ran to his study, nearly slamming the door behind him in his hurry to examine the bundle. He made sure to lock the door and clear his desk before gingerly placing the objects down on it. Unfolding the dirty cloth, he spread all its contents out so he could examine each.
"Lisa," Harry said, his voice gentle. He had already told her a white lie once, and it went against his morals to lie to innocent witnesses in order to force them to talk, but he was desperate at this point. "Hertzfeld's life may be in danger, and if you don't help me, you might lose him, too."
She cast Draco a sideways glance before grabbing her boyfriend and dragging him off with a, "Stop being a nuisance, Ron. I've lost too much valuable study time chasing after you."
"How much longer do I have to hold this up for?" he called when she left the room, muttering to herself.
Harry groaned as he picked Albus up and carried him down to the living room. "You can't be sick, too, Al. That's not how it works."
"They aren't." When Draco looked up, confused, Harry said, "We've managed to connect them to Christopher Macnair's alias—Adam Wilkins—and now we know the abductions are all interconnected because we never would've thought to connect them to his alias."
He glanced sideways at her, but she ignored his look by pretending like she was focusing on the clipboard in her hand.
"I was only joking, Buxley. I've had a talk with Dyers after yesterday's meeting, and he agrees that Hermione acting as a mediator between us and the DMLE's higher-ups would be the most efficient way to avoid any of the previous times' confusion or miscommunication."
"I am! Didn't expect you to show up," Harry said, still stunned by the sudden turn of events.
When Hermione didn't answer, he looked up to see a rather nostalgic smile on her face.
Buxley sighed long and slow, and let his eyes slip shut. His breathing evened out, and Harry almost thought he'd fallen asleep 'til he cracked his eyes open and focused them on Harry.
He smiled. "I will."
He looked down at his five-year-old, who just stared back up at him with wide eyes, and he nodded. "Right."
Draco's eyes twinkled, his lips finally upturning in a smile, and Harry felt the butterflies in his stomach once again, his heart rate increasing and his breathing growing shallow. The birdsong was shrill in his ears and all the colours in the room were blindingly bright. "Stop doing that," he breathed, leaning forward to kiss Draco. "Maybe losing your magic will be a good thing; at least I won't feel like I'm going to die every time you smile."
"Good evening, Mister Buxley," she greeted in a singsong voice and then turned to Harry. "I really appreciate all of your help, sir."
"Alright," he said as he bundled Albus in the blankets and picked him up. "It's time for little Mister Sunshine to go away and let Daddy wake up."
Harry always insisted Draco come with him when he hung out with his friends, and considering Draco had distanced himself from his handful of friends years ago, he was grateful for Harry's persistence. Draco and Hermione, although they had started off on a rough patch, had ended up as fast friends when they had realised they shared very similar interests. Sometimes, Draco even liked to entertain the idea of himself dating Hermione if he wasn't head over heels for Harry.
"I see."
"Boys!" Ginny scolded, hurrying towards them and pushing them back out the way they had come in. "What have I said about cleaning up before coming into the living room?"
he says," Harry interrupted, chortling. "Ah, man, you're such a riot." He sobered down when Draco glared at him and said, "Alright, alright. Anyway—this couple came into the bakery today, and what started off as them being cute and lovey-dovey turned into them competing to see which one could get their tongue farther down in the other's throat."
There was a rather long moment of silence before Draco felt Harry’s warm fingers interlace with his. “Does it matter? We’re together now. And we’re happy.”
A madman's face flashed before his eyes, a hissing sound filled his ears, and he swallowed thickly. It was getting out of control. He'd been able to keep his nightmares in check by downing vials of dreamless sleep potions or Firewhiskey. He'd been able to pretend like his hallucinations had never occurred by choosing to ignore them and distracting himself. He'd been able to pretend like everything was fine by focusing on work and the kids and anything else. But after the events of the previous day, he had been under the misconception that he had found closure, and had let his nightmares go scott-free.
before you act?"
What?"
Hermione?" Harry snapped, glaring at her.
—the most exquisite species of all, who ruled the land with their beauty and intellect, who were well respected by many and feared by few, but most importantly, were all
In-between the bookshelves and the desk were the coffee table and the sofas, where he was currently seated, and opposite him was the door, on either side of which were large paintings of scenic views, and tall, elegant tables holding vases stood below them. Behind him, the room was cordoned off using those delicate-looking foldable, wooden partitions that were usually found in the bedrooms of rich noblewomen. He couldn't really see through the intricate carvings in the wooden dividers, but he could vaguely tell that it was a rest area of some sort.
Harry slowly rose from the ground and trudged to the bathroom. Tossing his soiled clothes into the hamper, he stood under the shower. The scalding water didn't comfort him in the slightest. He brushed his teeth, shaved, combed his hair, and stepped out.
Harry laughs, and I find myself looking away, still too tentative about reciprocating his unbridled happiness. I catch myself even as that thought slips through my mind, and I have the startling realisation that it was never how happy Harry was that I disliked, but rather it was my constant choice to remain unhappy that I loathed. And Harry's happiness was a continuous reminder of my own, self-inflicted unhappiness.
"Coffee, Arthur?" Harry asked, to which the older wizard waved a hand.
"I see," Harry began, and Malfoy sat back, the same thoughtful expression on his face, but Harry continued. "But I don't suppose we could have this conversation off the record?"Malfoy raised an eyebrow, and Harry explained what he meant. "I can understand what you're saying since we have to follow protocol while questioning witnesses, too, but since I haven't signed any forms stating Camilla is officially my Healer, this can still be considered as playing within the rules, yes?"
Neville shrugged and shook his head, his eyes still wide and clear. "Cremate it," he mumbled, and Harry nodded.
himself.
"You flatter me," Draco said with an ostentatious flick of his wrist. "But that comes with being a Veela. As I'm mostly alone, I forget that I can have that effect on others."
"Hi! Where've you been?"
“Your hair is just as unruly as your—”
He raced through the underbrush, small twigs and stones scraping his ankles as he wound around trees, the tip of his wand barely lighting his way. There was a loud rip somewhere to his left followed by a pained scream.
She shot him a look, and he grinned.
what had happened. Well, it wasn't entirely his fault for imagining that Malfoy had drugged him, considering the situation and all, but now it made more sense.
look rather shaken up.
"Because… then you can't visit your mum. You want to go see her, don't you?"
"Two days ago."
I thought it was because of work and because I don't pay enough attention to them—"
I didn't get the order? I'm assuming there was some mistake with the paperwork—"
The letter had instructed him to sit at the farthest table by the window in an out-of-the-way Muggle café wearing a grey trench coat. And, to make identification easier, the Mind Healer meeting with him would wear a crimson scarf. So, one thought had led to another, and he'd expected to be spending the morning with a middle-aged wizard in a nondescript suit a size too large.
Ginny came bustling in just then, her arms laden with colourful party decorations. She took one look at the floating banner, and then at Harry's wand, and with a satisfied nod, went about her business. He sighed as he eased into the nearest armchair, leaning back and resting his elbow on the armrest as he kept the banner hovering in mid-air.
"They're sleeping so soundly," Ginny said with a smile as she eyed the three kids sprawled across the backseat.
"And that was the right job for the Head Auror because…?"
He had expected the place to look stiff and dull, like what he thought a typical noble's house would look, since Audrey had told him that Silver Sprigs used to be an old couple's summer house before they converted it into a pre-school for children of nobles and other famous people.
"Mummy!"
Harry was grateful for Kingsley's help, even if sometimes he went overboard with it. Harry oftentimes felt like Kingsley used him as an excuse to show people who ran the place.
our relationship."
"Yeah. I was going to take the kids on Saturday, but I spoke to Jones—the Harpies' captain—and she said that they're leaving early Saturday morning, so Friday evening would be a better idea."
"Like?" Draco attempted to laugh, but it came out sounding like
"Because you didn't tell him, I'm sure," Harry said in Ron's defence, but Ginny shot him a look. "Right, well, why'd you lie about the tickets?"
"Coffee for me, thanks." Malfoy looked towards Harry, who nodded. "And for Mr Potter as well."
"Mate, you alright?"
and he closed his eyes as he the usual dizziness took over. He belatedly wondered if he should've sent an owl back to the office letting them know he'd be late, but then decided it didn't really matter since he was the boss. Stepping out, he smiled at the eagerly waiting blonde—who was holding a tray with a glass of water, a napkin, and even a plate of biscuits—and made his way over to her.
His deputy glanced at Lisa and said, "No wonder she didn't notice it. I was just about ready to take our conversation to the next level."
"You, the one and only Draco Malfoy, taking the bus into town like a commoner?" She flaps her wrist and rolls her eyes with a pompous laugh. "What has the world come to?"
“Turn to page four,” Draco said, raising his bottle of Firewhiskey. “There’s an interesting article about a wild dog attacking some innocent children.”
"Anytime."
"Right. I can tell you that most, if not all of them, are related to the war and Voldemort in some way or the other. I think it's only the most recent ones that are sort of diverging from the usual ones," Harry said.
you per se," I start to say but then change my mind. "Actually no, I take that back. I
"Harry!" Hermione's voice rang clear through the blood pounding in his ears, and he stared at her, wide-eyed, taking in the bewildered look on her face. "Harry, are you alright? You look like you saw a ghost."
Her eyes glittered as she laughed and said, "You truly are a man who is beyond my understanding, Harry Potter."
Erhard spoke so highly of you."
Harry threw his head back and laughed, finding her tone of voice and facial expression far more hilarious than the actual tale. She didn't look very impressed, though.
She smiled. "It's one of Draco's more genius ideas. Each of the corridors is colour-coded so as to help people locate offices much easier than if there were only the signboards pointing the way." She motioned to her left, and they walked along the hallway adjacent to the one they had come from. "As you've already realised, Antares is quite a maze of identical corridors, and even I sometimes get lost in them, despite having worked here since the day of its creation." Harry paid attention to the different-coloured strips as they walked. "So this system has been a lifesaver."
"Not entirely. I can't say I really remember my intentions when Camilla proposed the idea, but now that I think about it, I may have subconsciously intended it."
He was jolted awake by sharp raps on his door. Quickly rubbing a hand down his face and smacking his lips, he cleared his throat and straightened his shirt.
All senses alert and focused on finding the perpetrator, he pulled his wand out and muttered tracking spells, casting them in different directions. His ears were ringing and blood was pounding through his veins. This wasn't supposed to have happened. No one was supposed to have known about the transfer. Nobody was supposed to have known of this location. They had taken all the necessary precautions. This wasn't supposed to have happened.
Draco scoffed. "Knew it. Typical." His thoughts were muddled and he was still hung up on what he was reminiscing about earlier, so before he could reconsider it, he said, "You know, you break my heart."
Harry gritted his teeth and gave her a strained smile. "I can Apparate on my own, Miss McMahon," he repeated, using her surname just in case he was right about her dislike of him.
"Yay!"
"Why're
Tapping the phone against his chin, he began to pace, his mind whirring from the new information he'd just received. So Ginny was going somewhere, but it wasn't with Angelina. Or maybe it
"A message for me, obviously," Harry said, looking down at his name in the title of the book, which had been underscored several times using a sharp object. "And Mr Malfoy? Where is he?"
There was a groan from the living room and he snapped his head towards the door, his heart lurching. Ginny moaned again, and Harry hurriedly dropped the phone in the coat pocket and strode into the living room.
"Your nightmares."
Harry stared at him, waiting for an explanation, and when he gave Neville a pointed look, the latter only shrugged.
Harry nodded as he watched Lisa jump to her feet and start yelling at Buxley. "Listen, I'm in the middle of something right now, but I'll call you tonight?"
I watch him leave, and for a long moment I feel a sense of emptiness overcome me. It takes me the rest of the afternoon to figure out why.
"I think I'm going to take these to my study," he said crisply, gathering everything up and striding out of the room before Ginny could stop him. Not that she would've; he was sure after that look of pity, she thought he needed time to recuperate from the shock or whatever.
Shaking his head, Harry said, "You're right. And so is Ginny. I would hate for the three of them to grow up not having made any new friends and learnt new things. I suppose we just thought it didn't really matter since they've got you and Arthur and all of their cousins, so it's not like they have no children to spend time with or adults to take care of them…"
"Yes," Camila said, placing a ballpoint pen on the table.
"What does that mean?"
"I didn't want to disturb you!"
"I wasn't finished with my explanation yet," the other wizard replied impatiently. "It is possible to manipulate the direction of the trace when someone is in the Floo as they essentially travel through vacuum to get to their destination. But this is a highly dangerous task, and if done wrong, can kill the traveler."
"Tough luck, mate." Harry clapped Neville on the back. He pulled his coat on, smoothed down his hair, and walked up to where his unit was waiting for him.
"Alright, I'll help you," Harry said, but even as he spoke the words, he felt like he was making a huge mistake, because Liz squealed with delight and, leaning across the desk, shook his hand vigorously.
Kingsley nodded sadly. "That and the fact that he played a pivotal role in ending the war as well as being a part of the Auror Department until very recently."
Harry put on the goggles and bent down to examine the unfolded envelope. At first, he didn't see it, but a moment later it was clear. In invisible ink, written diagonally across the envelope, was a note. A threat, to be more specific. Aimed at him.
It was that damn sickly sweet aroma that clung to him everywhere he went and tricked people into thinking they were happy for a brief period of time.
"OK."
"Don't you have better things to do than wake me up?" he groused as his son started bouncing up and down.
gonna do?"
Harry blinked. "What?"
"Camilla," Malfoy said, his voice low. "A word?" He shot Harry a quick smile. "I apologise for this; we won't be a minute."
Impressed, Harry picked up a crumpet and bit into it, humming at the explosion of blueberry in his mouth. "This is good."
It was a photo of him and Hagrid, their arms around each other—or rather, him trying to not be crushed under Hagrid's weight—the half-giant bawling his eyes out. He turned the picture around and read the message Hargrid had written in his narrow handwriting.
Malfoy seemed slightly taken aback by the sharp tone that Harry used. "I see that some things never change," murmured, more to himself than to Harry.
"Rodolphus Lestrange's brother?" he asked quietly.
"Harry!"
"Harry!" came the excited response from the other end, and he found himself feeling instantly relieved after hearing his wife's voice.
"The niece inherited her family's property and wealth because she was the only living relative, but she refused to cast away the life she had created for herself in favour of the life she had turned away from. And so, instead of returning to her home, she left all of her inherited wealth to her only daughter when she died. The girl, like her mother, didn't want to take on the family name but decided to accept her inheritance under the name of her late husband, Leonard Barkridge, and that's how the Barkridge noble family came to be born."
Although the day had started off on a dreary note, what with Lily waking up crying from a fever, and Hugo and James also coming down with colds, it took a turn for the better when Molly and Arthur had returned. The Weasley matriarch gathered up the kids in a matter of minutes and administered some household potions to remedy their colds, and not half an hour later, the boys were frolicking around out in the sun, and the girls were going about playing house. Ron left to go check up on Hermione and the shop soon after, leaving Harry to sit outside with his in-laws, making small talk while basking in the warm rays of the morning sun.
The second he had shut the door to his study, he placed a Muffling Charm on it so if he drank himself to oblivion, he wouldn't wake up to the kids' shrill screams. Placing the bottles and mug on the desk, he waved his wand and cleared the last bit of paperwork he'd left for later, opening the half-full bottle with his free hand and filling the mug to the brim.
"Half past—oh
"Really," he promised.
In-between the stairs and the pharmacy was a long hallway that led further into the building. There were several doors, doorways and smaller corridors that led away from the main corridor, and there was always someone walking to and fro, either doctors or patients or staff members. Harry inhaled deeply and was surprised that, instead of the pungent smell of antiseptic that he associated with hospitals, he smelled a mild, soothing scent of flowers and freshly mown grass.
written on it that Draco guessed she probably bought as a souvenir while touring with her team.
"Look, that fellow's probably still looking for you," Harry said, shaking the boy's shoulders gently in an attempt to get his attention. "I'll give him the money for the bread, but I want you to promise me that you won't steal again."
"What do you mean, you don't have it?"
"But one month after the investigation had begun, Erhard suddenly sent a second letter, asking the investigation to be called off, and I only assumed that he had found whatever he had been looking for. A day after that, the vase was gone, and in its place was the envelope with the blueprint, except it also contained a letter. Erhard must've realised that I knew that he was innocent, so he wrote to me and told me to come to London and find you. I didn't understand why, but he wrote that both my grandfather and father spoke very highly of you and that if there was one person who could protect me when he couldn't, it would be you."
"No, Buxley!" Harry exclaimed, grabbing the other man by the shoulders. "You don't understand. I
"Nothing," Ginny replied a little too quickly. "Nothing at all. There's just stuff that I need to take care of, alright?"
"—at?"
She opened her mouth several times and closed it, looking like a fish out of water, and as he waited for her, Harry Summoned two teacups and the pot of tea he'd kept ready before calling for her. He poured the tea into the cups and placed one in front of her. She picked it up, looking grateful, and took a long, slow swig. A few moments later, she placed the cup back on its saucer, and he saw her relax. The Calming Draught mixed in with her tea was taking effect.
"But I do."
"Hi. I'm Harry Potter. I'm currently looking for a school to enrol my kids in, and I wondered if I could take a look around your place for a bit before I made a decision? I haven't been to any other schools, yet, so it would be really helpful if I could get a brief tour."
Harry turns to face me, and there is something in the way he looks at me that I can't quite discern. He smiles, and in the dim lighting of the shopfront, the crinkles around his eyes stand out, making him look warm and homely, and I'm suddenly overcome by the urge to hug him and cry.
"Well, now that we've got the most pressing matters out of our way," Malfoy said in a professional tone of voice. "Why don't we get right to it?"
Harry looked up from gathering the documents he'd forgotten at home when he heard the telltale hiss of the Floo. Striding over to it, he got on his knees and stuck his head under the mantle. The burning logs fizzled, and Ron's face appeared in the fireplace.
It was only after he was out the back door and into the alleyway beside the shop that he let his anger show. Yelling in frustration, he kicked the nearest garbage bin and ruffled his hair. He jumped up and down on the spot, trying to stomp away all the months he had worked hard, cooped up in the dingy backroom, brewing potions for an ungrateful coward of a man.
"So, I'm guessing you won't be the one to help me figure that out," Harry said, trying to contain his impatience but feeling uncontrollably irritated for some reason.
drawing out the vowel sound to emphasise how much she needed it.
"She appears to be quite anxious," Kingsley commented as he watched Hermione disappear into Harry's office.
Padma was about to say something but was interrupted by a familiar voice belonging to the one person he'd hoped wouldn't appear.
Harry didn't respond as he thought about it. He deliberated the pros and cons as they rounded a corner, and he finally asked, "Who's this friend of yours?"
and Ron appeared from out of the restaurant's back alley, looking frazzled. He looked around for a moment before his eyes landed on Harry, and he frowned, striding over with a menacing expression on his face.
"This is how you got my attention the first time," he said, as though, once again, reading Harry's mind. "And, yes, I
"No, they weren't."
"Silver Sprigs."
"I swear, Buxley—"
"Warm yourself up, or you'll catch your death of cold!" Robards was hollering a little way off, smacking one of the younger Aurors on the back.
Finally, as the sun set and Harry sipped on his lemongrass tea in a daze, Draco appeared before him and snapped his fingers twice. A fog that seemed to have settled over Harry's mind since the moment he had laid eyes on Draco lifted, the sharp clarity of his thoughts piercing through his skull and making his head ache.
Ginny groaned. "Yeah, I think it's high time we send them to school. My parents must be exhausted with all the things they've been handling recently. Did you hear about Mr Perriwinkle passing away? A real tragedy. Dad was so upset; they were such good friends."
She smiled and nodded in understanding. He continued, "But I would like it if we could be friends."
Draco dove sideways and picked up the receiver, cradling it between his cheek and shoulder as he continued wrapping the bouquet he was working on. "Hello?"
"You don't say," Harry said sarcastically, and Neville pulled a face.
She turned to him with a smile and asked him how she may be of assistance. He pointed at the address and asked her if he was at the right place. She glanced at the parchment and nodded slowly.
The voices didn't go away.
She waved to the pharmacists—who only nodded in return before bustling away—and paused as they reached an intersection.
friends. I'm going to be an uninvited guest."
"Er, how are you?" Harry asked stupidly, feeling useless simply standing in Draco's living room when his son was missing.
Kingsley began to say something, but Hermione bustled over just then. She flipped through the files in her arms, handing over two to Harry and Kingsley, and finally looked from one man to the other.
“What sort of lunatic would want to marry a werewolf?”
"Then can
"Wait, Harry, before you go—" Hermione went around her desk and picked up a quill. "What did you say her surname was again?"
"They're blaming you for still not having found the abducted people despite having caught the abductor," Draco said, sounding somewhat irritated. "If it were that easy, why don't they do it?"
"I wish my body worked like that," Hermione said wistfully. "I'm in a perpetual state of hunger and exhaustion these days."
"Oh, it was fantastic," Hermione said with a grin, pulling Neville into a hug. "Neville! So good to see you! How
Harry thought, and he found himself relaxing. He couldn't remember the last time someone he wasn't close to had treated him like just another person.
"I know," Neville immediately said, holding up his hands. "You're right, it was a very stupid thing to do."
"Will… will you keep searching?"
"Thanks, Buxley."
to you, Draco? I've told you innumerable times already—"
"You better decide how you're going to deal with your… situation, and you better do it fast. I can keep it a secret from Ron for as long as possible, but you live with Ginny, and she's much smarter than you give her credit for. You of all people should know that," Hermione scolded in a hurried whisper.
Neville stared at Harry as though he thought it was a joke, and when Harry offered him a small smile, he sat up on his knees and leaned forwards.
Draco smiled, pulling her into a hug. "I'm sure he is."
"How do you feel now?"
He nodded, pulling Ginny close and kissing her. "I'll miss you," he said as they moved apart, and she gave him a sad little smile.
mind you. You've just been handing them over from one person to another like they're hot potatoes."
"And let you waste away in front of the telly all day long? I'm afraid not," Hermione said as she stepped back into the fireplace. "Bye, Harry!"
"Ah, she knows already," he said as Lily came running out from behind the bushes, her arms laden with plants.
"I know," Malfoy said just as softly, and Harry peeked out to see him smiling down at her in a heart-broken sort of way that moved something deep within Harry.
"'Mione, Hugh's awake. He's asking for you."
Hermione looked up from over the multi-coloured piles of parchment and grimaced. "What're
"Yes. Yes, I am."
Draco scoffed, pulling away to roll his eyes at Harry. "Did you hear nothing I just said?"
Harry nodded. "Looks good to me. I mean, I think the kids'll like it here."
"Oh."
Harry looks up, his usually twinkling green eyes dull and morose. He is the embodiment of misery, and, somehow, seeing someone else being that unhappy makes me feel better. Although that is a pretty heartless thing to think, I figure, why not? Maybe watching Harry wallow in a puddle of self-loathing is exactly what my miserable self needed.
"Yeah, plus that concession they have if your kid has a sibling. I have three, so…"
Harry stepped back, still holding onto her, and cleared his throat, feeling awkward all of a sudden. "Yeah, I know. And I feel the same way, but I just… I just need some space."
Draco flushed and spluttered. "Who's seen—"
"He was going to propose to her soon, before all this happened," Draco murmured softly, as though afraid he may disturb the duo in question.
The blond shook his head. "No, I was just wondering—and you don't have to answer if you don't want to—but why do
She waved it off with a laugh. "No, it's nothing, I just thought someone answered the phone, but no one said anything, so I was just wondering…"
been meaning to quit working at my old pre-school since it was rather far off, and very hectic. This one's much more convenient to commute to, and there aren't all that many children, so it's easier. But, never mind all that, tell me more about you. How're the kids doing?" She leant forward, her warm, kind brown eyes shining.
"Ginny," he choked, and she gasped as she hugged him, whimpering softly into his shoulder.
Mason took the scrunched up Muggle money from Buxley's hand and Disapparated. Harry rolled his eyes. "I'm your boss, you know. Not your son."
"What did he get Rosie and Hugo?" Harry asked, chuckling at the face she made.
"I wasn't trying to mother you," Hermione said, her voice taking on a defensive tone. "I'm just concerned. I thought you had gotten over your trauma, like the rest of us."
"—and that's all there is to it."
"Everyone always seems to be cleaning up my messes after me," Harry mumbled into his hands as Hermione came to sit beside him.
"Right, then." Harry held out his hand, and Malfoy shook it once. "Thanks for today. So, I'll see you…?"
"Do you really think it's a good idea, though? Me transferring to the DMLE?" she finally asked as she Summoned two mugs of tea.
"See if he'll repeat that when we're less than half an ocean away from the Minister," Neville muttered from the corner of his mouth, and Harry whacked him on the back.
"What in the world happened?" Angelina asked, looking up from where she was helping Albus with a puzzle. "We Floo in here nice and early from dropping the kids off at the Burrow to find the wife passed out on the sofa, the husband locked away in his study, and the kids running rampant in the house."
Harry nodded. "Yeah. I had a bad headache when I arrived, but it's sort of just thrumming in the back of my head, now."
children.
"Mummy, are we going home now?" Albus asked, coming to stand before Ginny and looking up at her wide-eyed.
"They met when my mother was visiting the human realm, as was her hobby when she was young, simply to see men and women alike fall under the spell of her Veela powers," Draco answered diligently.
when it comes to surprises, why do you think?"
"Can you
"Oooh, sorry mate. Looks like you've got a dislocated shoulder there."
Harry pursed his lips, shook his head, leaned in to peck Draco on his fish mouth, and then went back to polishing his Head Auror badge. Draco fitted his chin on Harry’s shoulder and hummed contentedly.
“You are such a—” Draco laughed, Harry joining him, and the moment was so pure and full of happiness that Draco never wanted it to end.
"It's over here, by the fireplace," Arthur called from behind Harry, pointing at the little basket on the side table.
Harry chuckled and nodded. She turned back to watch her sleeping husband, and Harry couldn't dissipate the lump of guilt that settled in his stomach. He wanted to apologise to her for not stopping her husband before he keeled over from overworking himself, but he didn't know how to breach the topic without upsetting her. Before he could come to a solution, she spoke up.
So, about this week, what's the plan? Do you want me to drop you off at the station or somewhere nearby? And when am I picking you up, Thursday or Friday?"
"Yeah," Ron scoffed as he stood up and made his way to the kitchen. "At least now it's just the four of them. Yesterday it was all five, and then Lily fell sick, so every time they screamed, she'd start crying. I tried contacting both you and Hermione, but both your phones were out of reach and neither of you seem to have received my letters, so I assumed things were hectic and decided to do whatever I could."
Harry groaned. "Well, I wasn't planning to. But…" he trailed off and shrugged, slumping against the armrest. "I didn't really wanna come home to an empty house."
"It is imperative that you finish your schooling, Draco, war or otherwise." She turned back to her flower arrangement, signalling the end of the conversation.
"Oh, wait, I'll pack some of these biscuits for you and Ginny," Hermione said, emptying one of the smaller bags and placing half the biscuits in it.
"Or maybe not the whole week," he said quickly, not wanting to ruin the homely mood they had just created. "At least a few days after the kids get back—"
Harry grinned. "I think it's time I called on an old friend."
"Harry," I say as he nearly falls asleep at the table. "Maybe you should head home. You don't look too good."
He sighed. "Ginny's career picked up around the same time. The Harpies made it into the later rounds of the World Cup, went on tour, and she was gone for months at a time. I was offered the Head Auror position sooner than later, thanks to Ron and my effort in 'revolutionising the department', and that's when I sort of hit the brakes and thought about what I wanted from my personal life."
"You think?"
Draco smiled, but this time, instead of causing Harry to go into a frenzy of happiness, his heart ached and he felt tears fill his eyes, his chest tightening and his jaw clenching in pain. "Not anymore." Draco pushed Harry, his fingertips barely brushing Harry's chest, but Harry could already feel himself falling. "You are an odd human, Harry Potter," Draco was saying. "But I'm glad to have stumbled upon you. May we meet again."
he thought grimly as he eyed his side-note of '
"Welcome to Antares, Mr Sandford," Camilla said with a wide grin and twinkling eyes.
He couldn't hear anything that was being said thanks to the Imperturbable Charm that had been placed on the barrier separating him from the Aurors milling around his clinic. He wasn't an expert in lip-reading either, so he couldn't exactly decipher if things were bad or not, except from Harry's physical reactions.
Harry blinked. He thought about that for a moment as he sipped his tea, eyeing the way Malfoy was clutching the edges of his armrest so tight that his knuckles were white.
Ginny laughed as her phone rang and she fumbled around with her bags as she looked for it. The second she saw who the caller was, though, the smile dropped off her face and she paled.
Harry smiled, nodding with reassurance at the man, but, somehow, Draco's trust felt more like an added weight than relief.
"Hi, Lils," Harry said, picking her up with one arm as Albus swung from the other.
"I didn't lie!" Dominique countered, grabbing her brother and ruffling his hair with all her might.
"Hi," she said, a tentative smon one her face.
"Hey," he replied, raising his eyebrows at her.
"Mm?"
"That's true." She nodded, seeming like she was steeling herself for the inevitable. "Maybe you're right. Maybe he's around here." She looked up at him, as though needing reassurance, and Draco knew they were thinking of the same thing. "I'm sure he's fine."
Harry sat back with a sigh, propping his elbows on the counter and letting his head fall back. Closing his eyes, he inhaled the soothing scent of chamomile and revelled in the quiet calmness that enveloped the Burrow. "I can't remember the last time it was this peaceful," he murmured.
She shook her head. "No, the party went fine, it's just—I don't know, I guess I should've just come clean about what I planned on doing from the beginning."
Harry nodded slowly. "Well, I do remember certain snippets from different ones. I've figured out that they're generally related to things I'm stressed out about in that period of time."
Harry smiled and motioned for Lisa to come in as he put away the file containing information on Hertzfeld and the case. "How're you doing?" he asked her once she was seated.
"The Barkridges are a very powerful family even in Germany. Only a month after old man Barkridge's death, the secret investigation was called off by the same someone who had authorised it, and everything related to the event was swept under the rug."
"'M fine," he muttered, wondering if his partner had heard him.
"Hurts." Draco flapped his arm, and Harry let go of it.
"You sound like you've already decided that our kids are going to this—this—"
There was silence again, and Harry found himself being impressed that Camilla could hold her own against Malfoy. He'd never actually known of anybody, witch or wizard, who wasn't Narcissa Malfoy or Bellatrix Lestrange who the blond actually listened to, let alone argued with. Not that he knew all that much about Malfoy to begin with, he reasons.
He was just wondering if she knew that he was Mr Sandford when the lift pinged. Before the voice could announce their destination, Camilla pushed the large red button and stalled the lift. Harry stared at her wide-eyed, wondering what she was doing, but she simply said from over her shoulder, "This might be a good time to use your commendable spell-casting, Mr Sandford."
The younger man saluted smartly before taking the papers. "Very well, sir. Thank you for asking. I've actually been meaning to come in and give you my thanks."
"Well, that's a lesson learnt. So… did you call me here so you could be mental again and ask me to get you into Azkaban on the day of Lestrange's release?" Neville smiled sheepishly, and Harry rolled his eyes. "Seriously, Neville."
"The morning session's nearly done," Audrey said as she pointed out various things in the room to Harry and then led him out. "We have another hour or so of free play, and then the younger children leave. The older children have a lunch break, and the afternoon session begins at two for them and the second batch of younger ones. The morning session usually has more kids because many of the parents work during the day, but you can choose to put them in either session, whichever one is more convenient for you; quite a few of our parents prefer to send their children here in the morning and homeschool in the afternoons."
"That was an error in judgement on my part," Zabini offered quietly, laying a hand on Malfoy's shoulder, but Malfoy shrugged it off in a clear sign of annoyance before nodding at Harry.
"Antares."
Harry paused again and shook his head. Staring at the glass tabletop before him, he tried to recollect the nightmares he'd had all those years ago, but all he could hear was a shrill ringing interspersed with blood-curdling screams and pleas for help. He closed his eyes and breathed, trying to calm his racing heart. Malfoy sat silently and waited for him to continue, not moving a muscle.
She paused as the large hallway branched into smaller ones. Flashing Harry a small smile, Camilla continued, "Primary colours are for the older offices and secondary colours for the newer ones. We also have tertiary colours, and black and white, for other services." They continued down the same hallway. "But while reinforcing and strengthening the foundation, we realised that we didn't have the funds required to continue construction on the second floor. So Draco thought of something else—he'd invested in the cross-technology venture from several years ago, and offered to let them use the second floor for their research if they funded the construction of it."
Initially, she hadn't really complained all that much, saying she understood that his work was important, but during the past couple months, she'd constantly been on edge. The stress from the upcoming tournaments she was supposed to cover was taking a toll on her. Considering that—and her already-fiery temper—Harry had decided to ship the children off to all their cousins' houses every chance he got. It was either that or deal with everyone screaming at the top of their lungs and Lily's incessant crying.
"I'm sorry, but I don't understand," he began, perturbed by first Malfoy and now Camilla's reluctance at her continuing as his Healer. "Is this because I no longer have an alias or because I breached client-Healer confidentiality or something?"
"Mr Potter?" Malfoy calling his name snapped him out of his reverie, and Harry slowly forced his eyes open. The blond was holding Harry's glasses out for him, and he took them, placing them on the bridge of his nose as he inhaled deeply.
"Night."
Bowing her head, Lisa sniffed. "I know that there have been talks of his death having something to do with my parents' deaths and that Erhard is behind everything, but I know that he is innocent." She looked up at Harry, her eyes clear. "Right after my grandfather's death, an investigation was started to look into the murder of my parents and who was behind it. The permission letter had my signature on it, so it seemed as though I was the one who had authorised it, but I knew it was Erhard, and I played along with his farce because I knew he would be in danger if he were found out.
Draco frowned at the piece of paper, quickly skimming its contents. “Is this… real?”
Draco closed his eyes and inhaled a deep, steadying breath. He opened his eyes to see Harry's mouth move to form the words, "You OK?"
cutting me off!"
Harry picked up the vase, and they made their way down the hall and off towards one of the tunnels that led down to the tracks. They passed by a tall, lanky, tired-looking wizard who was following a goblin down a different tunnel as they exited the main hall. The man tipped his hat at Harry, and the latter nodded back with a smile.
"Told you so."
on the same page as him, and said, "That needs figuring out."
She could hear voices up ahead, but the ringing in her ears made it difficult to decipher the words. Someone was begging for mercy, and she hoped beyond hope it wasn’t who she thought it was. There was a flash of light followed by the soft thud of a body falling. Several voices rose in laughter, and one of them commanded the others to go on ahead. This voice, she recognised.
"We don't have to talk about this right now," Malfoy said more firmly this time as he rose to his feet. "Would you like to take a walk with me?"
"Alright, you know what? Maybe I won't go after all," Harry said childishly, feeling the intense need to disappear into a hole. He knew Malfoy was only having a bit of fun, and he knew he was being childish, but he supposed he wasn't completely over the fact that the blond used to be a bully, and he really didn't fancy being humiliated by the man all over again. "I mean, I'm already troubling you enough with the vase, I really don't want to have to give him more last-minute work to do."
"Alcohol before dinner?" he asked, although he pushed his mug forward and let her pour a generous amount into it.
Just as they reached their destination, the Fat Lady's portrait swung open, revealing Weasley, who fixed his gaze on them both. He looked at Harry and said, "Can we talk? In private?" he added, glancing at Draco.
Ron sighed as he flopped down on the sofa. "Yeah. She, Rosie, and the boys were out for too long last evening, and she's down with a fever. I didn't expect her to fall ill just from playing outside."
"Oh, come on, Harry, you know why! You were looking forward to this trip so much and I just didn't have the heart to tell you!"
"It had more to do with convenience than anything else, but it helped prove that you had no hand in it. Everyone knows what a good rapport you two have built, and it's usually at the Head Auror's recommendation that they choose the Chief of the Undercover Unit."
"Well, either way, we seem to be derailing from the main point—are you going to stop me from heading the security unit or are you going to support my decision?" Harry asked, clasping his hands together on top of the desk.
"—arry! Harry! Wake up!"
He reached over and squeezed Draco's shoulder. "Now we just have to catch this bastard and we can get your son back to you."
Hermione shot him a questioning look as they existed the tent. Draco shrugged.
The first thing he did when he opened his eyes was groan, turning to his side and fumbling for the bottle of water he'd managed to Summon before he'd gotten pissed out of his mind. Splashing some water on to his face, he gulped the rest down, revelling at the clean, sweet taste that filled his mouth.
"Thanks," Harry replied, sounding unsure. Draco nodded and began to walk away, but Harry caught his wrist and stopped him.
"When? I don't know, maybe a week ago?"
As he followed her, he quickly glanced around the room. To the right of the fireplace was the main entrance, which comprised of two very heavy-looking ornate doors that had been propped open. To his left was the reception desk. As he stepped out into the hallway, he noticed that it didn't look at all like he'd expected.
to Ron?" she whispered hurriedly as Ron's footsteps echoed down the hall.
"So how come Ron only got five tickets?" Harry asked since he'd been wondering about that for a while.
Buxley looked at him wide-eyed, but Harry simply smiled and motioned from his deputy to Liz.
Draco was about to argue, but he could hear some commotion in the background. "Sorry, some kid seems to have spilt his drink. I'll see you soon, OK? Bye!"
"He was in the other conference room, but Deputy Buxley said he'd take him to your office."
"Is that so?"
At the mention of my shoes, I look down to see large, white dollops of some sort of cream on my otherwise gleaming Oxfords, and an alarmed squeak escapes my lips as I stare at my new shoes in horror.
"I've never really seen her like that," Hermione said softly as they watched Ginny and the kids troop out of the room. She turned to him and shook her head. "It made me quite nervous to see how panicked she seemed."
Draco watched as Harry cleaned the bedroom in a chaotic rush, waving his wand to change the sheets, dust the table lamps, and fix the drapes all at once as he bustled about.
"That's more convenient for you because it's right in the middle of Diagon. Ron can check in on them anytime he wants. It's not as close for Ginny and me.* I've already told you this."
"Anything baked by you is my favourite," Draco muttered as he picked up the pasty and took a big bite, humming in contentment. "Despite how annoying you are, I begrudgingly admit that you're still the best baker in town."
"Oh, Harry, darling! You're here!"
look. Harry grumbled under his breath, feeling chastised. She sighed and shook her head.
Harry's heart started to race as he sat up and turned towards her. "But I thought you didn't go because you didn't have enough tickets?"
"That has nothing to do with anything," Hermione huffed, going red in the face. "We already
"Oh, and Harry?"
Buxley simply raised his eyebrows and the papers he was holding, and said, "Here's to hoping you don't need it."
Kingsley sighed, looking somewhat agitated. Harry flicked his wand and shut the door, muttering a quiet Imperturbable Charm as an after-thought. "If you're here asking if I intend to head the security detail during his transfer, I'm going to tell you that I'm doing it irrespective of whether you want me to or not."
Harry nodded, ignoring the fact that Malfoy had avoided his question, and shifted in his seat as the blond Summoned a piece of parchment and a quill. They came to a stop before Harry, and he looked up into impassioned eyes and an anticipating smile as Malfoy said, "You know what to do."
, leaving him alone, once again, in an empty home. He sighed and massaged his temples, wondering if he should just take a nap since there wasn't much else to do, when there were three sharp raps on the window frame, and a Screech Owl flew in and settled on the table.
"Yeah?"
"Which pre-school, you mean? He goes to one called Silver Sprigs. Have you heard of it?"
Potter then motioned towards the room outside which they were standing. “I don’t want to seem too forward, but do you mind if I could speak with you alone?”
"Yes, well, I've had lots of practice."
Padma's jaw was set, and Harry could see the veins popping along her forehead even from afar. After a long moment of deliberation, she said, "Fine. But only if you allow us to conduct a thorough investigation—"
"Well, then, let's move on. I'm sure you want to know who we are, and what Antares is all about." When he nodded, she continued. "Antares is a private organisation that was established five years ago by a certain wizard who was very keen on helping magical folk in need. He trained as a Healer shortly after leaving Hogwarts and chose to branch out as a Mind Healer who specifically dealt with war trauma. Since his patients didn't want their identities to be revealed due to the nature of the help they were seeking and their recognisability in society, he'd meet with them in private and provided consultation whenever requested.
They exchanged looks. "We think someone may have planted it there, Sir, maybe to make it seem like it was a message sent via Floo."
The cool breeze caressed his cheek and rustled through his hair, and he pulled the covers higher over him, shivering from the cold. Why hadn't he shut the window?
"Sure?"
"Well," Harry struggled for a moment as he tried to explain himself, "I suppose I could give you an example. Like, when I came here for the second time, very early in the morning, it was right after a nightmare. I remember it because I got a similar one when I passed out in your office a couple hours later."
"It's always been their dream, y'know." Ron shook his head, a wry smile on his face. "Fred must be throwing a party and wreaking havoc wherever he is."
He could take care of the kids by himself just fine. There had been absolutely no reason for Ginny to go out of her way to ask Hermione to cancel on a trip with
Harry laughed awkwardly, embarrassed in the face of Draco's genuinity. "Just doing my job."
"Neville," Harry prompted again, and Neville sighed once more before looking up.
"Oh." Harry refrained from clearing his throat and stared at his glass as he thought that through.
Harry laughed, feeling a fluttering sensation bloom within him. Somehow, speaking to Malfoy so freely like this, as though they were friends, made him feel an odd sense of relief blossom from the depths of his soul. As though the very act of simply walking nowhere and chatting with him was a process of healing in itself.
Neville snorted at that and nodded. "Which is why I didn't go to the healers in St Mungo's."
Harry laughed, and Ginny smacked his arm. "Don't laugh. It isn't funny! Poor Percy got so upset about the fact that George considered the owl his namesake instead of the other way around."
The kids would be home in less than a day, and his nightmares weren't going anywhere, so the happier Ginny was, the better. It would be simpler to keep his insomnia a secret from her when she was busy doing whatever she wanted to do than when he could constantly feel her intent gaze follow him around all day long.
In an attempt to catch the bloke before he reached the rundown pickup truck, he sprinted across the parking lot, shooting at the asphalt and hoping to at least buy a few more seconds until backup arrived. The truck swerved sharply towards them, one of the perps leaning over the back to grab the other, smaller one and heave him over.
“Hey! I set it this morning; don’t destroy my hard work!”
“And you thought marrying me would be the solution to your problem because?”
"What's this?"
He could see the hooded forms of Death Eaters with every movement of the curtains, and he could smell the burning of rotten flesh with every painful gasp of breath. He could feel an incessant itch just below his skin, and he wanted to tear himself up before putting himself back together again.
They sat in silence as the waitress returned to serve them their food, and once she was gone, Harry asked, "So, I presume you know that we pulled the kids out of their previous pre-school?"
Ron raised an eyebrow. "Which one?"
Just as he was about to walk to the coffee machine to make himself a mug of strong, black coffee, a memo fluttered in through the open fanlight above the closed door. He caught it before it sailed past him and unfolded it carefully. Harry stared at Buxley's familiar scrawl for a moment before reading the memo. It contained very brief bullet points about various things starting from the latest news of the on-going investigation, to the confirmation of Lisanna Barkridge's identity and the story of the lost vase, to the submission of paperwork to the DMLE and them insisting that Harry attend the customary meeting of the heads of departments on Friday, to the latest report on the vandalism case Buxley was overseeing, and finally, to the most important thing: that he had no more work to do and could head home for the day.
Harry raised his eyebrows as he motioned for Kingsley to take a seat. "Well, I'm honoured to have the Minister himself drop in to check on me."
Draco swept a hand through his hair, his own anxiety causing his heart to race. What other explanation could there be for his son's mysterious disappearance? "Maybe there was a glitch in the connection?"
"Don't go too deep, OK?" Hermione handed them the blown up floaties, and they ran back to James, yelling excitedly.
Harry turned back to his unit as Robards started relaying instructions to the Hit-Wizards.
The corners of Harry's lips quirked up in a wry smile and he rose to his feet. "You are a very mysterious man, Malfoy," he commented. Malfoy's eyes shimmered in response, the familiar smirk tugging at the edges of his mouth as they walked to the door.
She sighed and put her book down, and he rose to his feet, gulping down the burning coffee and setting the cup on the table. "Well, I best go and check in on the kids."
"Hey, Lils," he said as they made their way to the kitchen isle. "What do you say about visiting your mummy and surprising her?"
in fact, an heirloom that's been passed down through generations of Blacks."
"A Malfoy always repays his debts," Draco said seriously. "And the ones I owe you seem to be piling up."
Harry sat back in his chair. "And?"
"Can't a man enjoy his pasty in peace?"
"I thought you wanted to see my eyelashes," Harry explained with a sheepish smile. "Sorry; guess I was wrong."
"I don't want another Healer," he repeated with more conviction, and something within Malfoy's stormy eyes seemed to change, as though he understood where Harry was coming from.
"What's the point of going away from home if you're going to do the same things you always do?" he asked as he sat down across from her and picked up a cup of coffee.
Harry. This isn't the first time I'm travelling. Besides—" she jangled her purse, grinning. "Hermione's bags are extremely useful. I'm barely carrying any luggage."
The blond shrugged. "You said so yourself; I hardly even know you."
Panicking, Harry disconnected the call, his heart thundering in his chest. What had just happened? Why had Angelina gone out of her way to call from another number instead of her normal phone or the home phone?
"Well, I don't usually go around broadcasting the fact that I drink potions to put myself to sleep…" Harry admitted sheepishly.
"Is this what you're looking for?"
"Why not?" he asked, fisting the shimmering powder. It was rough against his skin, but cool to the touch, giving him a distorted sense of comfort.
"Mummy!" Lily cried happily, cutting James off.
"I'd like a cup of tea, please."
"Oh, you can put it down now," she replied offhandedly, without looking up from what she was doing.
"Well, better Rogers than some other incompetent bloke, I s'pose." Buxley finally muttered. He then turned to stare at the ceiling, pulled the covers up to his chin, and said, "Thanks for visiting, boss."
"Hermione," Draco said, placing a hand on her arm. "Calm down." She looked at him with tears in hers eyes, and he smiled at her. "There's a township about thirty minutes south of here. We can use a payphone there."
The air behind Macnair warped, and for a second, Draco was unsure what was happening, but in the next moment, Harry was throwing off his Invisibility Cloak, the tip of his wand pressed to the back of Macnair's neck.
"All of you have been given a standard set of instructions that need to be followed throughout the course of this operation," Harry began, crossing his hands behind his back and striding down the length of the boat. "These instructions are to be followed to the last letter, and I don't want to see even a hair out of place. Am I clear?"
“Draco, please,” he whispered, choking up as he squatted down pulled his husband into his arms. “Please, stop this.”
He stared at the door for a long moment, setting his thoughts straight, before undoing the Muffling Charm. Scrunching his face up, he braced himself for the barrage to come but still winced when Lily's shrill screaming assaulted his sensitive ears.
"No," Draco insisted. "It's your tattoo."
"They should actually be home any minute now with your Aunt Hermione."
"I have friends in many places," he said mysteriously.
"I chatted with Al yesterday. He was complaining about how bored he was because Jamie and Lily were sick." She chuckled at that. "Ron sent me a message earlier saying the kids're over at their place."
Harry blustered, not knowing how to respond, but she only laughed, seeming embarrassed. "I've wanted to apologise for that since the moment I sent it. I don't know what came over me. I don't think Jon's ever been that angry with me in all the years we've been together."
Ginny nodded. "She came into our room, last night, before you got home, in tears. It took me a long time to put her to sleep. She hasn't been talking much all day." Ginny shook her head and swallowed. "I wouldn't have gone if I knew…"
Harry said, in an attempt to distract her.
Hermione stretched her arm out and pointed below the balcony, her eyes moving back and forth as she continued to read. Harry leant over and spotted the trio in a small space between the bushes, building what looked like a small kingdom, moats and all.
"I thought you said it was for the rich and famous or something?"
Padma's eyes went wide at the unwarranted thread, and Harry felt a sharp sting from Hermione pinching his arm, but he stood firm. Erhard was innocent, and if proving so was going to cause a rift between the English and German Ministry, then so be it. He didn't defeat a Dark Lord and nearly die multiple times just to step back and turn a blind eye when he could bring justice for someone. Maybe he was going about it the wrong way, but to hell with it. Besides, the damage was already done. There was no point regretting his choices now. He could feel Hermione's anger burning hot against his side and knew he was in big trouble for being so brash, but this wasn't the first time he'd overdone it for the sake of a righteous cause.
He was going mad.
She nodded, looking happy, and then motioned towards the books. "Well, I still have a mountain of work waiting for me, but if you want to read up on the Barkridges, I took the effort of marking the pages that contained information about them for you."
"What about him?"
"Alright, fine. Let's go."
"Buxley? What's going on?"
"I think they're rather happy with how things worked out."
Gritting his teeth, he focused on calming himself. Getting irritated wasn't going to solve anything. If he wanted to figure out what the problem was, he needed to know what had triggered it in the first place. He thought back to the past week, trying to see if he remembered any time Lily had behaved oddly. If she had been crying more than usual, or throwing tantrums more than usual, or annoying her brothers more than usual. He could pick out a few incidents, but nothing that stood out.
"Always eats well, this one," the matron said with a smile, patting Hermione on the back. "You should tell your friend here to eat more. Says he doesn't have an appetite."
After a moment, he looked up at Harry and smiled tentatively. "Thanks, Mister."
After a time, while they lay in bed, listening to the sounds of the night, Draco murmured, “You never did tell me why you chose me.” When Harry began to mutter in protest, he added, “Why you really chose me.”
Before Draco could even begin to process what was happening, his mother had already ushered them inside and shut the door behind them. He could tell that his mother approved of his marriage to Potter, especially because Potter had testified in favour of Draco at his trial.
Malfoy quietly Summoned parchment and a Self-Writing Quill and said, "Would you mind if I took down some notes, just for my reference?"
Draco himself was a
"No," Ginny said, pulling her feet up on the seat. "I told you he was
Everything about Harry's baked goods was perfect. It was moist enough to melt in your mouth but not too soggy that it left a wet aftertaste, it was sweet enough to make you hum in delight but not too sweet that you couldn't eat more. And his pasties—his pasties were Draco's go-to lunch on busy days because of the perfectly savoury blend of spices melded together with the filling and blanketed in dough baked so skillfully that it was crispy along the edges but soft at the core. You could tell, just by eating what Harry made, that he came from a family of skilled bakers.
Malfoy smiled, and Harry couldn't help but notice the faint dimple he got in one cheek. "That's good to hear. I was hoping that you would be more refreshed so we could take our sessions to the next step."

"Oi, you called, I came. That's what friends do."
"Anything else?"

"You admitted yourself that you aren't on the top of your game. Besides, Jon—" Buxley grimaced at being addressed by his first name, "—you're the Deputy Head, for Merlin's sake. There's no
He looked up to see a woman in a long, black fur coat standing in the doorway. She was standing against the light, so her face was cast in shadow, but there was no mistaking the cruel gleam in her jade eyes.
"Have the two of you spoken since then?" I ask, despite myself.
you're interviewing or
"Because nobody needs to know I live where I work," Draco replied for the hundredth time, wondering why he even needed to explain himself to his adolescent son.
"Of course I do." Neville frowned, and Harry had to consciously quell his irritation.
"If you're such a big girl, how about you walk on your own?" Harry asked as he manoeuvred his kids around the throng of wizards gathered in front of Quality Quidditch Supplies to watch the live screening of the semi-finals. "And remember what we spoke about, Lils? When you're talking about yourself, you say
“I had to seem like the stuck-up prat you knew from school so you could feel comfortable.”
"I would begin with small talk if this were one of our sessions, but since it's not, I'm going to get straight to it." Her eyes shimmered with uncertainty, and she said in a soft voice, "I apologise for my rather rude behaviour yesterday."
As he sent the letter off with the owl, he belatedly wondered who his next Healer would be.
Harry turned away, breathing deeply. The apparition—or whatever the hell it was—had shaken him up to the core. His nightmares had affected him during his waking hours before, admittedly, but this was taking things to a whole new level. The lift's enchanted voice announced their destination, and, as he stepped out of the lift, Harry decided once and for all that as soon as Lestrange's release and transfer were done with, he would write to Antares.
"When?"
"But it seems it's true," he added, clapping Neville on the shoulder. "Don't be a stranger, Neville," he said seriously.
people do that," James said before Harry had the chance to answer. "You're a
Malfoy smiled. "Why, thank you. It was nay an easy task, but I persevered."
He had contemplated running away from all of it and pretending like his problems didn’t exist, but he was more realistic than that. He knew better than to believe in futile pipe dreams and fantastical promises that would never come true. His reality hit him hard every month, and there was only so far he could run before it devoured him whole. There was only so much hope and belief he could hold onto before he gave up.
He whistled a happy tune as he made his way out of the living room, ignoring the way the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end or how he felt as if someone was watching him.
As they made their way to the door, Harry couldn't help but mutter, "Is it really that easy?" to which Malfoy replied with the telltale sign of a smirk, "It really is."
"What?"
"The Minister said—"
He entered the room and motioned for Buxley to leave, who did just that after handing Draco a cup of tea. Harry came over to place the book on his desk and tapped it with his finger. "You found this."
Harry sighed deeply and ran a hand down his face. "Sorry 'bout that. D'you think you could keep them occupied until the evening? I'll see if I can finish up early and bring them home."
Malfoy nodded once and took a sip from his cup. "You've signed how many forms, you said?"
did," James said, deciding to be the diplomatic older brother for once.
He stared at her, and she looked up and gave him a confused smile. "What?"
Draco sighed but sat down anyway, crossing his legs and sticking his chin in the air pompously.
He pushed the form and pen towards her, and she placed them in the file with a smile.
"Doesn't mean I shouldn't worry," Harry grumbled as he let her straighten his collar.
Ginny looked over her shoulder, her back to him, as he came to sit at the counter.
Draco frowned, looking around. "What do you mean? He came out before me."
"Er, yeah, but George said he has it under control for now, so…" Ron trailed off, looking over his shoulder. "Look, mate, I know you've been spending time with them despite being busy and everything, but I think the kids're starting to feel homesick. 'Specially Al and Lily. I think it'd be better if you brought them home for a day or two, just 'til they're back to their usual, chipper selves."
"Harry! There you are! I went over to your place and Ginny told me you were here so I had to come all the way back," Ron rambled as he rummaged around inside a bag and pulled out several boxes.
"I didn't breach anything. He didn't sign a form."
“I told you not to do this,” he whispered, gently reaching over to lay a hand on the other man’s shoulder. The blond snarled and whipped around, tackling him to the ground. He muttered a quick Stunner and watched the other man fly off him and collapse a distance away.
Buxley took her hand and shook it once, a grin on his face. "I'll forgive you if you promise to never set foot in this office again."
"Mother!"
-oOo-
She looked up, her cheeks now the colour of cherries, and her wide, hazel eyes filled with tears. He felt terrible for wanting to laugh at her as she was the perfect image of a damsel in distress, and he felt the intrinsic need to help her.
"Liz." He looked pointedly at her, and she shrank back in her seat. "I'm afraid I can't really help you with this. If you need someone to find a stolen vase, you need to go to—"
"Well—" his gaze drops down to my nametag before returning to my face, his smile widening, "—Draco, I was wondering if you could make me a nice bouquet of fifty red roses."
my whole life?" He was shouting now. "Is that what you want, Ron?"
Malfoy glanced towards the quill and it picked up its pace as it zoomed back and forth across the parchment. He then flicked his wand as he asked, "Can you tell me the area of their origin?"
He grinned, and Harry chuckled. Harry downed the scalding coffee and then said, "Oh, good. Maybe I'll go check up on them. I need to stretch my legs anyway."

After a good day of sales, I'm winding up when I hear the bell chime. "Sorry, we're closed," I call from the back room as I hurriedly put down the basket of flowers I'm holding.
"I don't think that's such a good idea."
He paused, and Harry flipped through the sheets, skimming through the details. Buxley continued. "But I
Harry looked up and grinned as Buxley poked his head into the office. "Yes, Buxley, there's something I need you to do."
"Why? Do you detest me so much now that you can't even stand my presence?" she sniffed.
"You said that the nightmares returned randomly, out of the blue?"
not to mention the fact that it had left Hermione mighty impressed with him. Harry scrunched up his nose as he was reminded of just
He looked down at the folder, and Malfoy's hand on his, and just as he was wondering if he should pull his arm away, the blond stepped back and placed his hands behind his back. "Well, I would say we've accomplished quite a bit today, wouldn't you say? You don't have to complete the tasks to their entirety by the next session, but it would make our sessions go by a little faster if you could finish as much as possible. Although I recommend that you answer each of the questions, if you can't, we can always work on them the following session."
"Lestrange will be escorted by our platoon, so remember,
"This isn't a punishment, Buxley," Harry said. "I'm doing this for your sake. Besides, sooner or later the DMLE's gonna butt in and tell you to either step back or step down, anyway. This is the second time in a few months that you've been incapacitated."
"Yeah, got back last week. Bill's busy with work, so Fleur's spending a couple days at the Burrow."
Harry turns around with a wide smile, and I belatedly note that my heart skips a beat. "Hi," he says, cheerful as always.

"What's wrong?" Draco asked when Harry stepped closer.
here, or do we finish our coffee first?"
"Won't you tell Daddy?" He almost thought she'd shake her head again, but she pulled away, rubbing her eyes. "Lily," he whispered, pulled her hands away and kissing them. "Sweetheart, please don't cry. We don't have to go to the Burrow if you don't want to. I'll talk to Mummy and we can figure something out. OK?"
He inhaled deeply and cleared his throat before saying, "You said Molly spoke to you about putting the kids back in school?"
"But I insist," the man persists, and I sigh.
"Right, sorry."
"Harry, Harry!" She was saying his name, but he could barely hear her over the ringing in his ears.
"And you're not going to solve anything on an empty stomach." Buxley eyed him sideways and said, "Food first, case next. It's one of the iron-clad rules we Aurors go by. You of all people should know that. You're useless on an empty stomach."
of 'em."
“Quit,” he said, holding up the Firewhiskey. “Was just going to get some food to go with my celebratory drink.”
the shop? Besides, it's going to be peak season, soon."
"Yeah, she's in a meeting-interview with the top execs right now. Actually," Harry said, checking his watch, "she might be done."
Potter rolled his eyes. “Right.”
Walking down the footpath, he looked around idly, taking in the bustling Muggle town in all its glory. He hadn't really paid it much attention on his way to the café because of the rain and him getting lost, but now that he had nothing better to do, he decided that he might as well take a walk and get his thoughts in order.
his mind said even as his thoughts returned to the first time he'd laid his eyes on Mini Malfoy and the tantrum he was throwing.
Draco smirked. "I may have been just as controversial a lad as you, when I was your age."
"Oh, just shut up and kiss me," Draco snapped, grabbing Harry by the back of his neck and crushing their mouths together.
"Alright then, Harry." She smiled at him as he took his seat and then turned to the waiter who had come to take their order.
"What? You want to have a go at me, too?" Draco asked Granger, spreading his arms wide. "Fine. Get it over with already so I can move on with my life."
Deciding that he was going to do Colin justice, he'd taken it upon himself to go around taking pictures with as many people as he could, in an attempt to lighten the heavy air of doom that had fallen over Hogwarts just after the war had ended. He'd gotten everyone to sign the pictures, to leave a message on the back of them. At the time, it had just been a spur of the moment thing, something he had done out of desperation, and everyone had just gone along with it.
He went through all of his instructions, the placing of each of the Aurors and Hit-Wizards, and Neville, the maximum and minimum time allotted for each phase of the release and transfer, and all the precautionary measures, including the extra ones he'd jotted down in case of an emergency.
He was a werewolf. Not by choice but by circumstance. And he only had two ways to deal: either he lived with it or he died with it.
"Yeah. Me too."
She laughed at that. "Nonsense. I always enjoy chatting with you. And about the school—don't just take my word for it. You should come down and check it out for yourself, whenever you're free, before you make up your mind."
"It's my pleasure," he said, placing the card under a paperweight.
"Now, do you have any other condescending remarks to make on my character or choice of accommodation, or can we go?" Draco asked, gesturing to the fireplace in the foyer.
to sit tight. The medicines Molly gave him makes him drowsy, but he just—won't—stay—still. Ron's out there right now trying to tire him out."
"OK," he said, inhaling deeply. "You can do this. Come on. It's just a damn letter."
"The vase," Buxley muttered, his dislike for it clear on his face. "I followed every trail that was connected to it in every way possible, just like you asked, and the only things I've managed to find so far are that the vase has a name—something related to purity—and
He was standing at the balcony sometime past midnight, eyes closed and enjoying the cool night air, Neville and Ron's cheers as they watched the match the only thing distracting him from the drunken stupor he was slipping into, when his mind wandered back to the first time he had met Harry.
Harry bowed his head and let his arm fall to his side. "You're right."
Malfoy nodded. "This dose was stronger than the usual one because I noticed the last time around that the milder dosage wasn't really working as well as it was supposed to. Now that the initial, instantaneous effects of the potion are starting to wear off, you don't feel any different from before. But a dose as strong as this, if administered on someone who doesn't drink the draught as often, would have a more powerful effect on them—so much so that they would feel sluggish and lethargic rather than just calm." He shifted forwards again. "Tell me, do you feel alert? Like you could focus on several hours worth of paperwork?"
"I'm sure you know what I mean when I say I'm still haunted by the past." He paused till Malfoy nodded in affirmation and then continued. "Well, I've had nightmares before; for months, after the war, but all of us had them, and we eventually figured out methods to cope. After about two years, they became less frequent and weren't as earth-shattering or heart-stopping as they used to be, and while I did lose sleep, I never used to jerk awake drenched in sweat, unable to fall back asleep."
Harry grimaced as he understood the implication behind what Ron had just said. "I know she knows, I just—" he broke off with a shrug, and Ron nodded.
"You can see tattoos on everybody, right?"
Haryy held up his hands, and she threw her arms out in frustration before walking away. He sighed as he pulled on his clothes, feeling the beginning of a headache. Rummaging inside the cupboard, he pulled out a half-empty bottle of Firewhiskey and took long gulps, revelling at the feel of the burning trail as it slid smoothly down his throat. Who cared about drinking alcohol in the morning? If he was going to have to deal with bipolar-Ginny, hyperactive kids, Kingsley's mind games and everything else, he was going to need more than just a simple energising draught.
Somehow her excuse sounded half-hearted, but Harry waved it off. There was no point in overthinking the smallest of things just because he was feeling guilty. She continued speaking, not having noticed his silence.
Harry nodded, unfocusing his gaze as he stared at Malfoy. He felt as though a warm haze was surrounding him, and he never wanted to get out of its gentle caress. When he refocused his gaze, Malfoy was smiling. His usually grey eyes were sparkling silver, and there was a kind of gentleness to his smile that made Harry wonder how many women he had swept off their feet with it.
"Lee," Harry warned, annoyed at the wizard's long-winded explanation that was causing unnecessary confusion.
"Miss Audrey is here, Mr Potter," Vanessa said, and Harry turned to see Audrey making her way down from the other end of the hallway, a wide smile on her face.
Macnair used the Auror's poor judgement to his advantage as he shoved past Harry and the other Auror in an attempt to escape but was Stunned before he reached the door.
Harry threw up his hands, slumping back in his seat. "And you honestly expect me to just take your word for it?"
Forcing himself to his feet, Harry trudged to the bathroom, cleaned himself up, and went downstairs.
have to come along?" James whined as he walked backwards a little ahead of his siblings and Harry, hands folded behind his head.
The blond waved a hand. "No, but my mother had shown me pictures, years ago."
"Hey, watch it!" he bellowed at the blonde who'd just run into Hermione, receiving a bewildered look from the woman as she jogged away.
Harry's eyes flew open, and he instantly regretted having said that. Heart thundering in his chest as an image of Malfoy flashed through his head, he fumbled for words, mind racing to come up with a believable lie. "This fellow who works at the Ministry," he finally managed, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribcage, "I just happened to mention pre-schools, and he said he had a son who went to Silver Sprigs, so we got to chatting about it."
Had Macnair really hung himself?
bloody job, and you screw it up! You just had to steal a
The Auror nodded once and hurried away. Harry strode forward and stood in front of the group that consisted of his men and Erhard. "Padma," he said, a sceptical smile on his face and his arms behind his back. "This is a surprise."
"Yes, but at least during the holidays." She gave him a stubborn look, and Neville turned to Harry helplessly.
"Al, c'mere." He hugged the boy, and Albus struggled for a moment before settling against Harry's chest.
investigation."
"Touché." Draco cocked his head. "And what's the other request?"
He smiled, and Draco decided that marrying Harry Potter wouldn’t be the worst thing that happened to him.
"Hi," I respond, somewhat breathless. "I was just about to head down to the bakery."
"Sure."
She paused, her cyan eyes having taken on a deep, brooding look, the smile no longer gracing her painted lips. Heart hammering in his chest, Harry waited with bated breath, anticipating what she was going to say next.
Harry cleared his throat and shot his deputy a small smile. "Thanks." He continued to remain standing behind his desk, the tips of his fingers pressed against the cool glass, and Buxley eyed him curiously.
Harry smiled, the corners of his green eyes crinkling and a hint of his teeth visible from the edge of his lips. "I'm not. But I'm the Head Auror who's in charge of finding your missing son, so I can't crumble under pressure, now, can I?"
He only looked up when Harry and Draco entered the living room. With a frown, he asked the blond, "Are you alright?"
The lounge right in front of the reception desk was spacious, and rather luxurious for a small-town clinic, with plush white couches and armchairs, glass-topped coffee tables, delicate-looking plants, and a small contraption in the corner that was modelled to look like a waterfall, complete with gently trickling water. He would've thought it was magic if he hadn't known what Muggles were capable of.
"You'll take me flying? On your broom? Like we used to?"
Harry smacked his lips. "I just wanted to kiss you. And there was mistletoe and everything so it only seemed right."
"Yeah, why?"
Malfoy sat back, looking stunned, and Harry felt like he had won this round.
George shrugged and grinned. "Why not? It's not like we have anything planned or something. Right, Angie?"
