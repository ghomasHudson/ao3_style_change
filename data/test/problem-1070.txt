It always took Harry a while to walk through the Ministry, everyone wanted to stop and talk to him, so he was grateful for the cloak on his visit today. Fortunately there was no one around in the corridor outside the Head Auror’s office to hear his knock on the door. He always still knocked, it was only polite.
Anyway it inspired me to write a Drarry version of it called The Desired which has one chapter up so far so if that sounds like your thing then check that out. The Marvel story can be found there too as I've linked it.
“No, when you grow up with a total of eight step-fathers the whole institution and sanctity of marriage kind of loses its appeal.” He said sincerely.
Monday morning for Draco was also pretty eventful. Today, after almost a year of planning and building up to it, he was finally moving out of the Manor and starting his own life away from his controlling parents. He was standing in his new flat looking around, sure living here would take some getting used to as it was pretty small and basic compared to his usual living standards but it was the first thing in his life that was completely his. He owned this building and his father couldn’t do anything to take it away from him.
“Draco, why don’t you take your mother back to Grimmauld. Ask Kreacher to fix up some refreshments. I think you could both use it and take the others too. They’ll be worrying and they’ll want to be involved. You could use the support too and we’ll need Blaise at the very least.” He suggested. “I’ll go ahead to the Ministry. I could summon them from here but I think you could do with some time to collect yourself before you have to face Ron. Let me explain the situation to him first, just about Lucius, I won’t tell him about us being together until you’re ready.”
“I was just asking if you were ok.” Fred asked, looking at Harry with a slightly curious expression.
“Now I’m just staying in mostly. Focusing on work, focusing on George and being there for my family and trying to figure out what I want.” Fred spoke in a normal flat kind of voice but he didn’t seem sad, just thoughtful.
“Anyway, we did actually want to talk to you for a serious reason you know!” Harry said in a mock annoyed voice, turning back to the twins.
Potter has obviously convinced the Ministry that Severus was on the right side all along and Draco finds himself hoping that is true. Maybe one day he could ask Potter to fill in the blanks for him, possibly, if they were ever able to have a decent conversation. Is that likely though? At the very least he knew Severus deserved an Order of Merlin if he really was a spy for the Order all along. It takes a great deal of courage to go behind the Dark Lord like that. Draco shudders at the thought of his former evil master.
“Stop, stop!” He cried out breathlessly but Fred ignored him. Harry then effortlessly shot him a gentle stinging hex that made Fred stop and sit up sharply.
Not just the bed, the lotion, the coffee... it was more than that. What he really wanted to say was ‘thank you for taking care of me’, but that seemed a bit… much.
They walked around a little more and Harry was eyeing up a few things that might make good presents for people back at home but Draco assured him they could come back to the market next Thursday and he could shop for gifts then if he didn’t see anything else on his travels.
“Draco is excellent at what he does.” Daphne said proudly, bringing Draco back to the present conversation.
He summoned an empty box from the open storage and packaging room next to him. Then he took the last ounce of energy he had and quickly ran upstairs, not looking at his surroundings at all but just summoning his last few remaining possessions from the bathroom and the wardrobe. He didn’t give his flat another look. If he had it his way he wouldn’t be back here. When he got back in the hallway downstairs with his box, he sealed the door that led upstairs with a high security lock that only he could open.
Draco spat out the last sentence then took a deep breath to calm himself down. He mustn't let Potter get to him. He looked down at the table not meeting the other man’s eye.
He tries to cross the last person off his list of apologies and then an opportunity presents itself.
“Would you please show Draco where the drawing room is so he can call his friends and then after that would you bring him to Regulus’ old room?”
He felt a bit guilty when Draco gave him that look again but he really couldn’t get into this in the middle of a Caribbean market… or you know, ever.
He always thought that person would be his future husband and then he would truly have a proper family member in the eyes of the law who could be his very best friend as well. However when he thought about this vague image of his future husband he could never quite see how this mystery man could understand the parts about him that came from school and the war and everything he had been through there. Somehow he realised that Draco might be able to understand it all if he explained it to him. Could Draco be that person that Harry had been looking for? Was it even possible?
“I what?” Draco asked sharply. “You don’t know me OK? You knew a version of me in another lifetime in very different circumstances… but I’m not that person anymore, so don’t presume to know anything about me.”
“Of course you can visit it whenever you wish as well Mother.” He said with a smile. “What are you planning to do with the Manor?”
Daphne took Draco’s quiet thinking as an opportunity to talk again. “He seemed really eager, he was straight in here a minute after we opened and was really impressed with the shop.” She said smiling.
“What- what did you smell, you know, with the Armotentia?” He said looking down at Harry’s hand rather than his face.
Narcissa was sipping on one sofa sitting close to Draco but not touching him and finishing a cup of chamomile tea, probably not her first. Draco had an empty cup in front of him on the coffee table and there were also a few other empty cups and glasses alongside a mostly empty plate of cookies. George had his arm around Daphne on the other sofa whilst Fred and Blaise each occupied an armchair by the fireplace. It seemed quiet in the room but not uncomfortably so.
Fleur was absolutely fine too, as horrified as she had been to give birth at the party on the floor with everyone around (even though Molly had ushered them all out into the garden to give Fleur some privacy), she quickly got over it and was laughing about it afterwards. The labour had been much quicker and easier than her other two but Molly still insisted that the family stay at the Burrow for a couple of days at least before going back home. Although that was probably because she wanted as much time as possible with her first official grandson (Teddy was sort of an unofficial grandson to her)!
He grabbed the whisky bottle that he knew was still on the table next to the sofa from last night. It wasn’t even midday yet but hopefully Draco wouldn’t judge him too harshly for that. Normally he’d just swig from the bottle but this time he summoned two glasses from the kitchen through the open doors.
“Oh no.” Draco said quickly. “I don’t drink at work even on my day off. If you want drinks with me then we have to go where I want to go.”
Harry sighed, it was true he had come to talk he just didn’t really realise Hermione knew that. It was quite normal for him to come over on a Friday afternoon now after all. “Yeah, I er, did want to talk to you actually. How did you know?”
Harry reluctantly took his hand from Draco’s and got up to head to the kitchen. As he walked he could feel the man following him. He hadn’t lied to Draco, for all his reluctance to have anyone over, it felt nice now to have company and there was something special about the fact that it was Draco.
“Yes I did actually.” Harry answered. “It wasn’t perfect I admit. I still woke up a couple of times but I definitely had some hours of uninterrupted sleep that was deeper than in the last week and I feel less tired today, thanks.”
Harry woke up on Sunday feeling the most content he’d been in a long time. Things since Draco randomly floo called him and then came round his house had been good. Well, things were still a little confusing and intense but also… good, hopeful. Last night had been really good too, fun and relaxing after Wednesday and things between him and Draco had definitely gotten a little flirty a few times, something that Blaise had only encouraged. Was Blaise trying to set them up? Did that mean that Draco had told Blaise he fancied Harry? He hoped so.
Draco nodded and Harry made for the door when he reached it he hesitated slowly and turned round. “Draco, what does your mother usually have for breakfast?”
“I know you said it might only be for a short time but you can stay here as long as you want and I want you to treat it like your home too while you’re here. You should try and relax.” Harry said, trying to sound convincing and willing the man to secretly know how happy Harry was to have him here without Harry having to say it.
Also, random side note, I wrote this chapter a few days ago whilst listening to James and Oliver Phelp's 'Double Trouble' podcast on Youtube where they featured a chat with Tom Felton! It was so good, my little Fred, George and Draco all together! I'd recommend checking it out!
The wooden panelled shop front was still black but it had been repainted so that it was glossy and shiny and the wooden panels had a thin elegant gold trim all around the inside of each one. It had a glass door with a long narrow window either side and then to the right was a large clean shiny glass square to reveal the beauty within. The black strip across the top of the shop had fancy gold lettering on that said: Pierre’s Parisian Potions, Perfumes and more.
It certainly wasn’t the worst sentencing that could have happened today, Draco thought to himself. It would be annoying to be watched so closely and to be honest he wasn’t sure how he felt about going back to school… On the other hand to have true freedom at the end of the year with full qualifications… that was better than he could have hoped for. He hadn’t looked to the future much. The past was too painful, the future was too uncertain. He had just been existing in the present, trying to get through each hour, but if he could do this… Maybe he could have some sort of future after all.
Draco knew that look but thought this was just designed to put Harry on edge again. He was about to answer when Harry got there first.
Suddenly all these images that tormented him at school and confirmed the fact he was gay were coming into his head. Potter flying, diving effortlessly for the snitch... Potter casting the most powerful patronus easily from his broom... Potter on the back of a firebolt swooping around a dragon and dodging it’s fiery attacks smoothly... Potter in his dress robes at the Yule Ball dancing so awkwardly it was almost cute… Potter bending over him as he bled out on the bathroom floor with that look in his eye… Potter on a broom again reaching his hand out and grasping Draco’s wrist pulling him up and around him, such strength, such bravery, such skill on a broom as Draco held him close for the first and last time just after he thought he was going to die.
“Absolutely. It’s beyond attraction, he cares about you.” Blaise stated leaning forward in his chair slightly and giving Draco a more serious look. “You should have heard him when he floo called me the other day, he was so worried about you and he wanted to know what you’d do if he gave you access to the Black vault… he really wanted to do the right thing.”
Draco was lying very still but slightly stiff now Harry was aware of it. His breathing was very even… almost too even. Was he really asleep or was he just pretending? Harry couldn’t tell. God he hoped he was asleep. If he was awake but pretending not to be though maybe they could just never
Draco smiled back at him softly and then he directed his attention to the other products pointing a few more things out to Harry.
The list started well, first year and second year weren’t that bad. Third year was where it got tough thinking about Remus and Sirius was always hard for Harry but he walked to tell their stories more than any other in the book. He thought about what it would be like for Teddy for him to tell the world what a hero and a good man his father was and hopefully it would help the public’s attitudes towards werewolves too. Sirius had been posthumously cleared of all charges after his death with the Ministry but that had been just before Dumbledore’s death so that and everything that happened after kind of overshadowed it. Thinking about it Harry wondered if most of the public knew the truth about Sirius’ innocence and the fact that Peter had betrayed his parents. They probably didn’t and Harry wanted to honour his Godfather and his parents in his book.
“Right of course. Well, I know he has been staying with you from Ron and a bit about the case with Lucius Malfoy. Ron said that you were taking him out tonight to explain it all. That means there is much more to the story than you’ve let on and if you’re taking Ron out to the pub to talk then it means you’re worried about his reaction. Usually when you’re worried about how Ron will react to something you talk to me first. So hence the drinks and the biscuits” She explained as she always did, like she was reciting it straight out of a book.
Draco got dressed in simple white linen trousers and a blue V-neck cotton top. It was still long sleeved of course to cover his mark but it was thin enough for the July late afternoon sun and he rarely dressed in robes anymore. He smoothed his hair down and then made his way out into gardens still enjoying how much better he felt.
Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco seemed slightly disappointed. He was becoming much easier to read so he was so open and relaxed.
Someone asked for Draco to get jealous of Harry as some point and I love that idea! I did put him getting jealous of Biscuit into this chapter (hehe!) but I will definitely include this request into the next chapter as they will be going out then and it fits in better. (mild spoiler alert!)
He sighed and then spoke painly keeping his voice emotionless at first. “I would be lying if I said I felt completely comfortable with people knowing, not because I’m ashamed of it or anything, far from it actually there is part of me that wants to yell from the rooftops that I kissed Harry Potter-” Then he paused to smile slightly at Harry.
“Right, OK, so you’d better put the cloak on now and then you can hold onto my arm. I’ll side along you. I- I er, I promise I’ve got you OK so trust me you won’t get splinched or anything it’s just that, erm, well my apparition isn’t that graceful as you saw.” Harry said running a hand through his scruffy hair.
So the plan really did seem to be coming together. Draco said he’d organised for Graham to work Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays at the Potions shop and then he would be at the joke shop Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays with Sundays off. Fred and George had said they would probably need Graham on the Saturdays that Hogwarts students flooded into the Hogsmeade village but that could be arranged. Seeing as they’d just had one there wouldn’t be another for a while and Draco and/or Harry would just have to be in the back of the shop on those Saturdays so that Daphne wasn’t alone. Hopefully by then though the threat of Lucius Malfoy would be dealt with.
Harry thought quickly, he wanted to be done with his glasses but if he got rid of them people, mostly Dumbledore, would become suspicious. Harry didn’t need the extra attention from the Headmaster, he would already have to act like he was still under the bindings in order to finish his education. “I know this might be a usual request but is there a possibility you could fix my eyes and replace the prescription for normal glass?”
"Yes, Molly, we already told you he was safe. He's sleeping right now, as it is quite early in the morning, and most children are asleep", Remus said, looking at the three children Molly had Brought with her. "Do you mind if I ask what you are doing here? I don't remember an owl saying you were coming over. Is everything alright? Is Arthur okay?"
"Molly, I said I was going to let him sleep. You are welcome to stay for breakfast and tea. But if you don't want that, please leave." Remus kept his cool despite Molly's cruel words.
Harry nodded slightly and took the dagger. He made a small cut on the tip of his index finger and pressed it against the parchment. Immediately words seam to spring from his finger. Harry snatched up the parchment to read:
Harry cleared his throat, surprised by all the land he seemed to own, “Is there any way to clean one of these properties for habitation.”
Harry kneeled to open the loose floorboard and take out the small stash of books. If he was going to leave today, he needed to leave before anyone could stop him. Aunt Petunia always seemed to get up at the break of dawn to make sure Harry couldn't steal any food while making breakfast. As a result, Harry only had thirty minutes to break into the cupboard under the stairs and pack all his belongings. Luckily, Harry had managed to sneak his wand away from the cupboard when he stole the books and parchment.
screamed Sirius making Harry keenly aware of his banshee blood, “I SWEAR  TO MERLIN- HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING. THERE IS A MAD MAN AFTER YOUR HEAD. AND YOU THINK IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO LEAVE YOUR RELATIVES WITHOUT TELLING ME! I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE ANNOYING, BUT HARRY THIS IS WAR. THERE ARE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS THEN OUR PRIDE. I SWEAR TO SALAZAR THAT IF YOU ARE HURT, I WILL KILL WHATEVER DARED TO HURT MY GODSON, AND YOU YOUNG MAN. YOU BETTER OWL ME AND REMUS ASAP MISTER OR WE ARE GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS. HOW DARE YOU LEAVE YOUR HOME AND NOT TELL ANYONE WHERE YOUR GOING. YOU DID NOT EVEN COME HERE! HOW WERE REMUS AND I SUPPOSED TO KNOW YOU WERE SAFE. IF IT WASN’T FOR THE WARDS ON NUMBER FOUR TELLING US YOU LEFT WILLINGLY, WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDNAPPED! HOW CAN I DO MY JOB AS YOUR GODPARENT IF YOU DON’T TRUST ME., I’M VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU HARRY. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AFTER LAST YEAR YOU WOULD HAVE REALISED THE IMPORTANCE OF TALKING TO ME BEFORE DOING SOMETHING RECKLESS. IF YOU ARE NOT HERE IN TWO DAYS YOUNG MAN, I WILL TELL PROFESSER MCGONAGALLTO REVOKE YOUR PERMISSION TO GO TO HOGSMADE- AND I WILL TAKE YOUR INVISIBILITY  CLOAK. THREE DAYS HARRY. YOU HAVE BEEN MISSING FOR THREE DAYS. NO LETTER. NO NOTHING. NO HEY SIRIUS I AM FINE I JUST NEEDED TO DO SOME STUFF WITHOUT MY RELATIVES BRETHING DOWN MY NECK. NO- I HAD TO FIND OUT YOU WERE SAFE BY HEGWID SWOOPING IN FOR A VISIT. YOU BETTER HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION FOR THIS YOUNG MAN OR YOU ARE GROUNDED. I DRAG YOU BACK TO NUMBER TWEELVE MYSELF. FUCK THE MINISTRY, I WILL DRAG YOU HOME MYSELF.”
Harry stood there, staring at his reflection and was jolted out of his glazed state when he heard the sound of his alarm. He must have only hit snooze. He hurried to Dudley's second bedroom and shut off the alarm. But a soon as the clock stopped blaring, Harry could hear a small rapping coming from his window. Wondering who sent him a letter, as his friends had warned him that they wouldn't be able to send anything to him, Harry crossed the room and opened the window. In stepped a stately Great Grey Owl, who proudly stuck its leg out for Harry to take the white envelope. The way the bird acted reminded him of Malfoy. As the bird flew out the open window, Harry turned over the letter to open the envelope and noticed the golden Gringotts crest.
Harry looked over to the alarm clock, only 30mins left. He wondered if his magic maturity would hurt. Sirius hadn't gone into too much detail, assuming Harry already knew what was about to happen. Harry hated not knowing what was happening. His aunt used to scold him regularly about his questions. she constantly repeated, "curiosity killed the cat, or in this case killed the freak."
“Lord Potter, your identification please.” The old goblin said as Harry handed over his wand. “Yes, all seems to be in order, first hall on your left and last door on your right, Lord Potter.”
"Thank you. I hope to do business with you soon. May your gold flow and your riches multiply," rushed Harry. But when the goblin just stared at him, Harry began to worry that he said something wrong. He remembered something about that being customary to end a meeting with a goblin from his second year. But maybe he was wrong. Perhaps that was something only really old goblins used. Maybe he horribly offended the goblin. He didn't want to anger anyone, let alone the people who ran his money.
“Yes, of course young lad, please follow me, my names Alore Ovira, owner of this shop. If you sit here” He said leading Harry to and old red, barber-shop style chair. “Now, I have to ask, do you consent to a scan of your eyes, it will only be a medical scan of them” Harry nodded, “Fantastic, please remove those glasses.” The old man waved his wand in Harry’s face, a bit to close then strictly necessary, and a soft yellow glow spotted Harry’s vision. “ah yes, I’m sorry young lad but it seems your vision is significantly worse than the prescription in these muggle glasses. I can replace them if you want or I can fix your vision. However, fixing your vision will cost twenty galleons as a posed to the 3 galleons and 2 Sickles for changing the prescription.”
"But Harry, that's still only two days, what else happened to make your stay in Diagon Alley so long. Why didn't you come here in the first place? We would have helped you…" Sirius trailed off sadly.
After paying his items and Sia, Harry and the Snake made their way back to the Leaky Caldron to situate the serpents living space. Harry muttering about his owl, Hogwarts, and any other important information for his new friend to know. Harry hardly registered the strange glances he got walking through the alley, he was too focused on Sia.
"Oh," Harry didn't know what to say, he always thought it was weird Hermione and Ron were so much more prepared for the school term then he was. Still, he only thought it was because Harry himself wasn't very studious. Now that he thought about it, he never saw Ron or Hermione receive their letters, and Harry was with them on both of their birthdays. "Well, that explains why the dates were off on mine then."
“I think I understand the maternal inheritance then, and the paternal, but what of the avenged and conquest? What does that mean? And why wasn’t the Gaunt lordship passed to me through my mother?” Harry rushed out, just remembering the Hufflepuff and Gaunt line.
Harry blinked in shock. His mother was a Pure-Blood and the lady to three respectable houses, although she only accepted the Potter line. “Then how do I have the Lordship of Slytherin? If it when to a different side of the family?”
Harry’s first instinct was to go to Potter Manor, his father and mother would have spent time there. However, if things got worse and Harry needed to go into hiding, Potter Manor would be the first place anyone would go to look for him. Harry sighed, it was probably the same with all properties that he inherited through his father and godfather. So, he would have to choose a conquest, avenged, or maternal. But Dumbledore has probably guessed, if not known, that Harry had the lordships from his ‘vanishment’ of Voldemort. Thus, Harry best change of survive would be a property from his Maternal side. Slytherin was out of the question, as it could have been included into conquest if Riddle claimed lordship. He cleared his throat, “could you set up Wards around Ravenclaw Castle and Serpent’s Garden?” Harry knew it was a risk, but he really wanted to continue gardening and the land seemed like it would hold interesting plants.
"Excuse me, I must not have been paying attention, here let me help you up," Draco said kindly, nothing like the boy Harry thought he was, and offered his hand. As he was helped to his feet, Harry blushed realising he was a few centimetres away from Malfoy's chest. He quickly stepped a respectable distance away.
Harry let out a long exhale as he looked through the window and absently rubbed his hands together. When he felt something cold resting on his fingers he looked down. Yesterday, he did not get to admire the beauty of the rings. Ravenclaw ring was an elaborate bronze band, detailed with flowers and leaves, and set in the middle was a large, gleaming sapphire, which was surrounded by smaller blue stones set in an X pattern on each side. Moving his hand in the stones glistened in the sun. Harry could remember overhearing Malfoy talking about his heir ring. The blond boy had been so proud to be the heir to the Noble house of Malfoy that he wasn’t as quiet. Walking through the halls of Hogwarts, he could hear the pretentious blond talk about his new responsibilities. From what he overheard, Harry would no longer be able to remove the rings until he appointed a new lord to each house or until he died.
"Sorry Siri, I didn't mean to run off, I just forgot to leave a note. I didn't mean to worry you." Harry got out, smashed up against the older man's chest. Harry was slightly saddened that he had to put back on the glamour. Yesterday had been so freeing. He could just be himself, and no one looked twice at the young man roaming the Alley. But he didn't know who was at headquarters or if Dumbledore was watching the place. Harry wondered how Sirius would react to his real appearance.
"Harry," whispered Remus, "Merlin, never disappear like that again, or we'll lock you up in here like Rapunzel" Sirius and Harry gave a small snort at the comment. But Harry smiled a bit sadly at the werewolf. There was a new scar on his face. It was still red but looked a month or two old. Magical scars were interesting like that. The injury could be years or decades old, but the lines still red and fresh looking. Because Remus was a werewolf, self-induced injuries would look a lot brighter for only a couple months before fading slightly, while Harry's scare had never faded, and presumably never would.
Harry took both stones and stretched out his arms while Grimhook placed the spell in Gobbledegook, and Ragnok put the shield. The candles flickered as the magic coursed throughout Harry. His skin felt like it was peeling off the muscle. His bones seemed to bend with the force of magic. But as soon as it started, it stopped, and the magic stilled. Harry opened his eyes, not realizing he closed them during the spell. He also realized that Grimhook had left the room.
Ragnok nodded knowingly, “I figured that would be a question you were going to ask. You see the entirety of the magical world thought that the late Lady Potter was muggle born. However, yesterday evening, after you left, I went through the Ravenclaw and Slytherin vaults, to establish new banking records. Due to age of the file and seaming extinction of both families, this has not been done for a while. But both Vaults contained a family tree. It seems that Marope Gaunt was an heir both Slytherin and Fawley. Her late husband was the lord of Ravenclaw. They had one child together, a female, before Marope’s husband died. After his death Ms. Gaunt had one child, male, with a muggle family. However, because the Slytherin line follows the oldest male child in the main family, the son received the lordship of Slytherin, although never claimed, and the daughter received the title of Lady Ravenclaw and Fawley as eldest in the family. The Daughter then gave birth to a single, female child before she died due to complications in the birthing process, the child was then given up for adoption in the muggle world. This pure-blooded child was Lily Evens, your mother.”
After exiting the store, Harry noticed that the sun had already begun to set and hung low in the sky, causing the street to be filled with orange light. The street had cleared slightly, and the air was colder. Harry hug the Bottomless bag to his chest as he walked quickly towards the inn. Something about the evening seemed off. The full moon hung large in the sky, illuminating the darkening street with its glow. Harry felt a pull towards it. Like the moon was calling him. He wanted to run, to find his pack, to hunt, to play. Only the concerned hissing coming from Sia snapped Harry out of his haze. He shook his head, attempting to clear it, and continued towards the in, not looking at the full moon as he went.
"OH NO, my apologies Hadrian but I forgot I have to meet up with my mother at the Leakey Caldron for an early dinner. I can walk you there, but I have to get going", Draco burst out, almost running up the stairs to the clerk's desk and paying for his books. Harry followed more slowly.
“Someone named Tom Marvolo Riddle, but he never had an account here.” Harry took a quick intake of breath. He was related to Voldemort. The Dark lord was his great-uncle. Harry cleared his throat, “I’m sorry to say, but Tom Riddle is in fact Lord Voldemort.”
"Your wand Mr. Potter, or if you don't have that blood will do fine," the goblin interrupted Harry with an eye-roll. Harry blushed slightly as he handed his wand over for examination. While the goblin looked at the wand and wrote something on a piece of parchment, Harry looked around at the other goblins. He thought he saw Griphook sitting in the corner of a desk talking to another distressed goblin.
"Fine, but you should at least let Ron, Hermione, and Ginny stay, it's no good to isolate the boy." Molly berated.
"Um, where was I?" Harry blushed, "Oh, yes, I woke up, and everything was different. But not soon after, I received a letter from Gringotts inviting me to a meeting with my account manager in the afternoon. My relatives have this rule that if I leave their house to enter any part of the magical world, I can't go back to them. So, I had to sneak out of Privet Drive and planned to stay in Diagon Alley for the remainder of the summer. But when I got to Gringotts… well here", Harry handed his inheritance test to Remus.
"Nah, you would be a Slytherin, with all that planning to convince your uncle, definitely a Slytherin. We could be in the same house!" Draco stated excitedly. Harry knew that it was meant to be a compliment, but he felt strange, he shouldn't want to be in Slytherin, and how he was acting right now made him feel ashamed. He was using Draco for information. He didn't want to manipulate people. But part of him also preened, Draco Malfoy was actually complimenting him. Harry didn't think he ever heard the boy say anything besides an insult.
"This summer was great. I was allowed to be out of the house. There were no other…Issues that caused it to be bad. Until my birthday. I had no idea what was going to happen. Sirius briefly mentioned something about my sixteenth and how he was excited about my birthday. But that was the only warning I got- "Harry was cut off abruptly by Siri's shout of rage.
I'm sure many of you are aware of the recent events on Twitter, and I'm sure you, like me, have a lot of conflicted thoughts and feelings about Harry Potter and JKR after her disgusting show of bigoted transphobia. It's going to take me some time to reconcile what kind of place HP has in my life going forward. I don't want to support or be associated with such hateful views, mainly because I am a part of the community she is insulting with her ignorance and bigotry. However, the Potter fandom has brought me so much comfort growing up and has been nothing but kind and accepting and open to all people, that I don't think it's right to let one woman's views bring it down. I will be finishing this fic, rest assured. However, I probably won't be writing future fics in the HP fandom. If you agree with JKR's views statements, stop reading now, because this fic is going to be queer as hell and include trans characters. I don't have time for anyone who doesn't accept that trans women are women, trans men are men, and nonbinary people are nonbinary, and all people are people, and this place takes everyone, not just cis/het people. This fic is a place of love for everyone.
Remus, Sirius, and Harry had spent the rest of that day talking. Harry, for the most part expressed his concerns of going back to school and the way his friends would react. The werewolf reassured the young boy and helped make a plan with the school year to help keep Harry's new revelations away from the old coot. For the most part, Sirius muttered curses and looked ominous and brooding. Remus had said that this was just how the Animagus reacted to bad news.
Harry decided that it was probably not a good idea to irritate his godfather any more than he already had. He wondered into the kitchen, being careful to not wake Lady Black and the other portraits. Sure, enough, there was a plate of around 20 muffins sitting on the counter along with butter, cups, coffee, sugar, cream, small plates, and silverware. Harry elected to bring the food and utensils out to the sitting room at set up a small dining area on the coffee table. He set two plates close to the sofa and placed his on the opposite side. He then poured himself a cup of black coffee as he sat on the floor. Sirius had been right when he said the Muffins were tasty. Harry had missed house-elf cooking, or maybe just home cooking in general, not that he ever had home cooking before.
"Okay, Harry, come on. Don't just stand in the walkway. Have you had breakfast yet? Have you been eating enough; you look too skinny?" The thin man stated a bit hypocritically, pushing Harry towards the sitting area. "I was just going to help Remus get up. I have muffins on the counter for breakfast. Kreacher made them. I don't think there poisoned, I had one last night, and they were delicious."
"Harry," Sirius gasped lightly, "you look so much like your mother, now you even partially got her hair, you look good, Harry. No need to be embarrassed."
Even the thought of trickle tart had his mouth-watering. Harry wasn't allowed to eat much with the Dursleys. He wasn't allowed to do very much of anything with the Dursleys. They were awful, horrible, abusive, arses. Never in a million years would Harry wilfully submit himself to the treatment of these muggles. He wasn't a bigoted blood purity fanatic, but he knew that if Malfoy were to meet the Dursleys, he would have all the reason to hate muggles. Harry himself felt his skin inch whenever he was forced to spend time in this merlin-forsaken house. However, Harry knew that his mother had given her life to protect him, and in order to keep this protection, he needed to stay in this house. But the way Dumbledore had said it made Harry wonder. He said as long as he called this shite-hole
The Alley opened it its usual fashion of magical moving bricks to reveal the long string of shops. Harry made his way to the store he had spotted on his second day on the way to the bank. Foundation: Magical Solon and Spa had a clean, sleek exterior with windows covering the front wall. Harry could see that there as only a couple people in the shop. So, there wouldn't be too much of a fuss over his mop of hair.  As he entered the shop, Harry heard a quite bell ring out, alerting the shop keeper of his presents.
that he would be protected. Harry certainly did not consider this devils trap home. Nor these people family. Dumbledore also seemed to forget Lord Voldemort shared Harry's blood.
Sia slithered restlessly in her cage, yesterday Harry had promised to take her shopping with him. He had also learned that she was not an ordinary, common corn snake, but she could change sizes at will. Sia had said that this was common among magical snakes and not that impressive. But Harry was amazed, he had never seen a snake change its size, and when Sia shrunk herself to sleep in a small hole within a log, he was surprised. Sia was secretly pleased with his astonishment but rolled her eyes at his naiveite. She was worried about what would happen to her young Hatchling should he go off to Hogwarts unprepared. Harry had warned her of the old Headmaster and his manipulations. While they only had known each other for a short amount of time, they felt fairly close. Harry supposed that it was because he had no one he could trust right now, and Sia could only tell one other person what he was up to, but he doubted she would do such a thing.
“Harry please, call me Harry.” He interrupted quickly, not wanting to be rude but needing to decrease the formality in the room. He wasn’t practiced enough in these situations to feel comfortable yet.
Harry suddenly remembered the note Ragnok gave him. He turned to the nightstand where he left it the night before.
Harry wasn't stupid like Hemione, and Snape seemed to think. He knew that the ritual at the end of fourth year gave Voldemort his blood. And now the wards on the house were flimsy at best. The Snake like man could manage to get through the house after all his mother's protection travelled by blood. Harry thought he should have mentioned this before the summer holidays last year, but the Headmaster avoided him. Harry even tried to tell Dumbledore before the start of this summer, but the older man was too busy lecturing him about his carelessness in the Ministry of Magic.
On top of that, if Harry hadn't developed his version of Occlumency, Snape could have seen some very personal memories that Harry didn't want anyone to see. Even Snape took precautions to protect his memories. Why wasn't Harry offered the same thing?
"So, I heard you found the boy?" Molly sneered at Remus, who Harry just noticed, was leaning against the wall.
With Sirius's nod, Harry continued, "Well, as I said, I had no idea what was happening. When I woke up, I looked completely different-"
Harry stilled there were only two people that Harry beet, by himself, in battle, Voldemort and Quill. “wh-what was the son’s name.” Harry whispered not wanting to hear the answer.
"I, uh- didn't what to impose, and I didn't know what I was going to do yet. But I have more news." He trailed off at the look of horror on both of the men's faces, "It's not as bad as this test, but I'm still rather upset about it. When I got back from my second meeting, my Hogwarts letter had arrived. Normally I get it on my birthday as do other kids…" he trailed off again at the look of pure outrage on Remus's face.
If he didn’t get the required E in History of Magic, then Harry could substitute Ancient Civilizations with a continuation of Magical Creatures. This way too he kept all the classes needed to become an Auror so Dumbledore wouldn’t be too suspicious. Although with taking the Maximum allowed classes probably did not help decrees attention. Neither would what he was about to do. While Harry had decreased talking to snakes in recent years, learning that he inherited it from his mother made him excided to talk to the animals again. And while he could now understand Hedwig and the other owls, she would have to stay in the owlery, a snake on the other hand could stay in the dorms. If they bonded enough, the Snake could even attend classes with Harry, as long as it stayed hided. With his design made Harry headed over to Magical Menagerie in order to talk to and buy a snake.
Harry hissed back at the boa, defending the corn snake. All the snake heads snapped up in shock. Harry had made sure he spoke quietly so that the shop keeper could not over here them.
"Actually, she wasn't. My mother was a pure-blood witch that granddaughter of Marope Gaunt and her husband, the heir of Ravenclaw. Lily was adopted by a muggle family after her mother died."
"Mr. Potter, you are a very interesting wizard, not many use the proper farewells in the goblin community. Very interesting indeed, Mr. Potter." The goblin mumbled as he left the hall.
"Hello Tom, thank you for the offer, I'll keep that in mind. I'm just heading into the Alley for some shopping." Harry spoke. Sia attempted to snort at the higher-pitched voice Harry used to not be recognized. Tom, however, just nodded, not batting an eye at the boy. Harry moved to pass him to the doorway a few meters away.
The alley was packed. There were more Hogwarts students milling around the stores. The Alley was much brighter then yesterday, filled with students and family’s exited chatter. Harry managed to slip past the crowned unnoticed and into the pet shop. While his representation in the media has improved, Fudge’s smear campaign last year destroyed his reputation. Now even strangers were throwing jeers at him and asking if he raised Voldemort to get more attention. Although, that made no sense, but Harry noticed the Wizarding population wasn’t very good with critical thinking.
Harry did it! he could take Ancient Civilizations instead of Magical Creatures. Although he loved Hagrid, his classes were a bit too unorthodox for Harry’s taste. He quickly transferred over his list to the parchment given to him by Hogwarts. Harry had no idea how Dumbledore would take his packed schedule, or how Sirius would react to his newfound academic appeal, but it was sure going to be interesting nest year.
"I'm aware of what he did, Siri, but we can't scream about it at the top of our lungs. People could be watching".
"Here, this is the book my father had me read when I became the Malfoy heir and suspected Black heir. Although I was later denied as the Black heir. Apparently, Sirius Black was never completely disinherited from the family", Draco stated without any hint of anger. Harry, however, was reeling. Draco Malfoy was picking out books for him without any complaint. He was babbling about almost everything on his mind.
"Very well then, please sign this form to allow me to release the information on your inheritance test to Grimhook while I summon him and inform him of the situation."
He had completely forgotten there were other things to discuss with Ragnok, the test had blindsided him. Now that he thought of it, wasn’t lily a muggle-born witch? How could Harry have inherited anything from her? Let alone the lordships of Slytherin, Fawley, and Ravenclaw? Or a dragonkin inheritance, whatever that was? He needed to do research, perhaps the goblins had an evens family tree? But he would have to go to Flourish and Blotts to grab the information on his creature inheritances. Oh merlin, would Harry turn into a werewolf, would he need to be locked up in the Shrieking Shack? But he was only around, 25% werewolf so he wasn’t quite sure what would happen.
As they walked into the kitchen, Harry ran back into his room, not wanting to get caught by any of the children and forced to spend time with their insufferable mother. Harry couldn't believe that woman. How dare she? Molly Weasley was not nor ever would be something Harry needed in his life. Remus and Sirius were the best guardians he could ever have. They weren't irrationally angry, they didn't use him, they weren't Dumbledore's lapdogs. Harry only hoped that it was the Weasley matriarch that had such deplorable manors and intentions. Honestly, she calls herself his mother figure.
Harry sighed in relief, “yes, I was under the impression that Lily Evens was a muggle born witch. How could I have inherited anything from her?”
“Yes, well you vanquished the Dark Lord, who was responsible for many deaths and a couple extinctions of families. The Most Ancient and Noble families, however, have a stipulation that whoever killed the cause of the family’s extinction the vanquisher shall be inducted into the family in order to keep the family alive and thriving. Hufflepuff was one such family. As for the conquest or conquered, it is a bit more complicated. You see Marope Gaunt had an older brother who received the lordship, had when he passed the ring was lost, however the lordship passed to Marope’s son, who actually claimed it, although not at Gringotts. it seems that you defeated this man, the lordship then passed to the stronger of you, making you lord Gaunt.”
Harry only had one day left in the Alley, but there was a lot to do. He wanted to fix up his wardrobe, cut his hair, go school shopping, and gather books on pureblood culture and creatures. The nine books given to him by Ragnok the other day would help immensely with understanding his inheritance, but he needed more information. He didn't know if it was common for each wizard to gain creature traits or if it was just the Most Ancient and Noble houses with a creature inheritance. Did Malfoy have a creature inheritance? Harry doubted it, the blond boy was prideful of his family and very loud about what great new thing had happened to him. Harry guessed it was either something one wasn't supposed to talk about, or Malfoy didn't have any creature blood. Harry was also confused about how his creature inheritance would work. Ragnok said that similar traits would combine, but each of the bloodlines would have a distinct characteristic that could be traced back to the creature.
Harry nodded slightly, still in shock at all the information he found out. How could he be so naïve? Were any of his friendships real? Could he trust his Godfather, who is his adoptive father? Harry snatched up the form to distract himself from his racing thoughts. He read through the contract carefully, according to Professor Bins, Goblins were crafty beings and will try to gain the most from any situation. As Harry finally signed the parchment, Grimhook and Ragnok entered the room.
When back in his room, Harry resized his trunk and placed the books in the stack inside the magically large case. Then Harry turned to his owl. "Hey girl, did you sleep well?" Harry smiled as he opened her cage. "I know it's a bit sudden, but I have to go to Gringotts, the wizarding bank. And you know the Dursley won't let me back once I leave. Do you think you could go and wait for me at the Leaky Cauldron as you did in third year?" Harry whispered as he ruffled her beautiful white feathers. Hedwig Hooted in response and stepped towards the window and flew out into the open sky.
“Any questions? The goblins of course will continue to grow these assets, but if you are finished, we will move on to your vaults,” with Harry’s nod, Ragnok continued, “I have compiled a list of monetary values of each vault. The artefacts are not listed, however are apprized.”
As he entered the bank, he walked up to the goblin that escorted him to Ragnok’s office yesterday. Harry cleared his throat, “Excuse me, I have a meeting with my account manager, Ragnok.”
Molly Weasley, Ron, Ginny, and Hermione were standing at the front door. Ginny was wearing a garish pink dress that was entirely too short for her to be wearing in front of her mother. But Molly seemed okay with it, so Harry didn't really care about what she wore, besides the colour. It was horribly pink, like Umbridge's wardrobe, and not very pleasant. On the other hand, Ron looked like he just rolled out of bed, hair sticking every which way and in an old shirt that had a large dozen holes littering the faded lion design. Hermione stood next to Ron, whispering in his ear. Harry couldn't make out what she said, but it probably wasn't pleasant from the look on Ron's face.
Harry took a deep breath as he stood in front of Number 12 in the warm, late morning sun. However, Harry felt that he was sitting in a bath of ice. Last night had not been good. He was plagued by weird nightmares and a strange longing to be near someone or something. Harry could only sleep a couple hours before he decided to start reading the books Malfoy recommended. They were more interesting then Harry had thought they would be. But now, he had to face his godfather and magical guardian, the last two people on earth that he thought of as family. The closest thing to parents he had shown him the same amount of love and affection that other parents gave their real children. He couldn't bear the thought of that being fake or them choosing Dumbledore instead of him. Or worse, didn't believe what Harry told them and laugh at him. Harry doubted that the last one would happen, but he had grabbed the Inheritance test out of his trunk for proof of what he was saying.
the corn snake hissed, her voice remined Harry of the mothers he saw on Platform 9¾ saying goodbye to their children.
"Fine, but Dumbledore asked us to bring Harry back to his relatives, first thing in the morning. They're worried sick about him. After all, how would you feel if the boy you raised ran away without explanation?" the Old woman bit back spitefully, clearly playing what she thought was her trump card.
They made small talk as Draco showed Harry every corner of the Alley, muttering of their reputation, their affiliations with individual families, and how much he liked the shops. On the other hand, Harry was learning so much he didn't know the wizarding world had. There were junk shops, Malfoy thought they were rather gross and undignified, divination shops, home appliances, camping, art, and almost anything else Harry could imagine. The Alley was like a muggle shopping centre, but he thought it best not to mention that to Draco. Finally, they arrived at a book shop Harry had never been to before.
On another note, the next chapter will be a tad long then the others so it might be published a little late. But no later then Tuesday. Thanks everyone for reading!
The timer jolted him out of his reading. Harry had been immersed in the Goblin Rebellion of 1612; he never knew that the Three Broomsticks was used as the Wizard headquarters for the rebellion. Although Harry felt bad for the goblin nation. The Wizarding world seemed quite prejudice against any creature in the magical world. Harry thought this was quite idiotic, as wizards in other countries were allied with dark creatures, and it seemed most pure bloods cared dark creature inheritances as well, if is Black inheritance was any representation.
Slowly Harry put each ring on his hand, allowing the magic to accept him as their lord. When he finished, Harry could feel the exhaustion seeping through his bones and the power coursing through his veins. Harry thought that he was going to explode or faint. He wasn't sure which one yet. He could faintly hear Ragnok speaking to him, but all he could focus on was not falling to the floor. He could distantly detect Ragnok setting up another meeting and handing him a slip of paper before the customary goblin farewell.
"REMUS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR MAGICAL GUARDIAN! THAT MANIPULATIVE ARES. HE TOLD US WEREWOLVES COULD NOT BE MAGICAL GUARDIANS!" Sirius interrupted again.
But tonight, was the night of his sixteenth birthday. According to his Godfather, this birthday was a crucial part of a wizard's magical career. This would be the night of this magical maturity. Sirius also let slip that the trace would disappear after he turned sixteen, although the Ministry didn't want people to know that. The magical government still wanted to maintain the trace and prevent any underage magic. But Harry didn't care about the Ministry's wishes. In fact, if he could avoid being arrested, he would do anything in his power to undermine the government. Harry lightly traced the scar on his hand in his own messy scroll. Hedwig hooted quietly in the corner. Her worried eyes fixed on his hand.
"If I looked any different, Dumbledore will know I did something very good for me, and very bad for him."
"No, I actually wanted to grab the texts if my uncle decided that I could go to school. If I have the book, then he can't use that as an excuse." Harry lied easily.
The Emerald tree boa snapped harshly. Harry already decided he didn’t much care for the mean tree boa.
"Downstairs is where most of the schoolbooks are. They have them sorted out by school, year, and class. So, it takes up a lot more space than the books up here, which are focused on culture, traditions, and government. There are a couple books of the sacred twenty-eight or whatever base they're going off of. Many wizarding families don't go by the sacred twenty-eight anymore because the writer was so biased when he wrote it. You know the Potters didn't get into the list because they had a feud with the writer? The Dark families in Britain threw it out ages ago, but the light only threw it out when they realised that Harry Potter didn't get in. Although, now that the Potter line is no longer Pureblood, a lot of neutral families wouldn't care if that line was included or not." Draco Babbled, "Oh, here, I think I know a couple of books that would help you." The blond boy said as he walked over to a middle bookshelf and started pulling values off of it.
Harry could have sworn the requirement for potions was an O. While most of the professors at Hogwarts accepted an E, Snape had higher expectations then most. When Harry had first heard this, he thought Snape was just being unusually hard on students, this thought was only furthered by Ron’s snide remarks after the meetings with Ms. McGonagall. But now Harry thought he understood why it was necessary to get an O. Potions is a very dangerous subject, one wrong move and the room could explode, it was delicate art. It would be very bad if Ron or Seamus were to be in advanced potions, the entire castle would explode.However, this made Harry wonder why Ms. McGonagall didn’t require an O. as fare as Harry New, in 7
"Well, hello, young sir. This is Foundation: Magical Solon and Spa, here to serve your beauty needs. My name is Violet Ironwood, what may I do for you today?" The young woman, Violet, stated politely eyes Harry's hair warily.
"Ahh, Mr. Potter, I hear you have quite the problem. Ragnok and I have decided to provide this service free of charge, provided that you take up the lordships upon our closure here?" the head goblin stated proudly.
"I still have to do some shopping for my Uncle, but it was really nice meeting you, Draco." Harry smiled kindly, keenly aware he was lying through his teeth.
"While I think I want to cut it all down to an even length, it used to be quite long. But now I'm looking at a shorter cut so it’s easier to manage." Harry stated with his most charming smile as Sia slithered down to wrap herself around his wrist.
Sia sighed, she had a feeling she knew who sent the letter and Harry would be both pleased and saddened.
Harry cleared his through to get the old man’s attention as he stepped through the red door, “Excuse me Sir, I was wondering if I could get a new prescription for my glasses.”
"Why, of course. Here we have bands of all different shapes. However, these silver and gold ones are charmed to stay in place quite well, and these are flat, so it won't disrupt your friend. This one also has charms on it to protect the wearer", the man stated quickly, he was shaking slightly and repeatedly glancing at the door as if he was nervous about someone coming in or wanted Harry to leave soon.
Leaving the looming bank settled Harry more than entering the Looming building, he finally had answers to most of his questions. Although, he figured some of his questions would never be answered. The meeting only took two hours, so Harry still had some time to study for History of Magic. But first he wanted to get his eyes checked out. He hadn’t had a new pair of glasses, or a new prescription, since he was seven, when he first got his glasses. Harry had noticed a small store a few blocks from Flourish and Blotts. The building was small and there seemed to be only one wizard working at the front desk.
"Moonshine, I'm sure Harry will tell us what he's learned, why don't we take your own advice and shut up?" Sirius chastised at the same time he grabbed Harry's hand and forced him in-between the two. "Now, pup, please continue," he demanded.
As Harry entered the room, he nodded his head twice in respect, which he learned was custom from his studying that morning. “Greetings Ragnok, I hope your gold grows strongly.”
"Ah, yes, you must be Mr. Potter. I am Ragnok, the head account manager for the Potter family and associates and have been for four decades. Today we are to do an inheritance test to decipher the lordships you are to accept. Then we will review your properties, stocks, and businesses should you wish to accept your lordships. Finally, we will discuss your vault situation should there be multiple. Any questions?" the goblin, Ragnok, stated primly.
They were soon at the front door and Draco just just placed his hand on it when a cold shard voice echoed through the entrance hall.
“Erm, I can collect it if that’s OK, would be easier for you I’m sure. We’re having a thing at the Burrow at 7. Obviously I wouldn’t impose on your time but I could pick it up just before you close on Monday?” Potter said eyeing him closely once again.
Then he remembered something else that Draco had said. ‘When have we ever done anything conventional?’ Yes it was fast, yes it was crazy but did it feel right for them? Yes. So screw trying to work out what was ‘normal’ Harry thought to himself as he also went upstairs to get dressed.
Hope you liked the smut too, I did take note of your comments and rating will probably go up at some point. More sexy stuff on the way! ;)
We start with Draco's side of the story here and catch up with what he's been doing since the war and what his plans are now.
“Well you said you liked her, seemed like maybe you could talk to her? She must know Draco well and maybe she could advise you?” George said simply.
Harry could now see a female figure coming down the main path to greet him who he thought was Daphne. He placed a hand on the elegant white gates and they melted away under his touch to allow him entry so he walked down the path to meet her. As he got close she stood and waited then held out her hand to him in a very ladylike fashion. Unsure exactly what the proper etiquette was here, Harry gently took her hand and bent down slightly to give it a tiny chaste kiss which Daphne seemed to approve of.
“So I can still draw them?” Teddy said excitedly, his hair changing from light brown to bright pink.
Deciding he was in the deep end now anyway so he may as well continue the honesty, Harry said, “My arse is hurting a bit here, come and sit on the sofa with me?” Then he stood up separating himself from Draco but holding out his hand for Draco to take if he wanted to.
“Well you haven’t reacted… you’re scaring me. I expected you to shout or panic or something.” She said.
“His foot is healing. He can’t put any weight on it yet as it’s still a bit swollen and painful but the gash in his skin has joined together well and I don’t think it will scar.” George said simply taking the box that Harry was floating towards him and walking into the kitchen.
“Well I can tell you want to ask me something. You came here to discuss the book right? So... hit me with it I guess.” Harry said casually trying to pretend the conversation wasn’t as deep as he thought it was about to be.
“Me too.” Draco said kissing him on the forehead. “Did you talk to Mr. Weasley and Bill about the book?”
“He is all of those things.” Harry insisted. “Maybe you should just forget the Draco you know and try and see him as a new person. If you met him now and didn’t know anything about him I know that you would like him.”
“Rose is their daughter?” Draco asked not sure if he’d heard the name before but knowing they had one and remembering a photo he’d seen in the sitting room.
Harry smiled back at him and then launched into it. “Well at school we got to that age, probably fourth year I guess, where everyone else seemed to be thinking of dates or sex or what not and I just never thought about that stuff but all the Gryffindor guys definitely seemed into girls and it was all they talked about suddenly. At the time I didn’t know anyone who wasn’t straight, or so I thought, the rumours about Fred hadn’t reached me then… Anyway, I just thought that I should find girls attractive I guess and I never thought about a guy like that. I remember thinking that Cho was pretty and I actually asked her to the Yule Ball but only because there was so much pressure on me to ask someone and she was the only person I’d ever really noticed. Then she started showing an interest in me in fifth year but when we kissed it was such a disaster that it put me off kissing in general for a long time… the whole thing with Cho was just such a mess really I was so clueless about dating!”
“Yes, an apology would be a good place to start.” Blaise said. “But it needs to be a full, sincere apology. You need to explain to him why you acted like that. Tell him, in the same way you’ve told me, how it made you feel when you found him upstairs and why. He’ll understand and he’ll forgive you if you’re open and honest with him.”
George flushed slightly but nodded at no one in particular then he looked at Draco. “Is- er, is Daphne OK? We’ve been writing, I know her Grandmother died but I haven’t seen her since last Thursday and erm, well I want to give her space but I want her to know I’m here, if she needs...”
“Yeah, that would be good.” Harry said flatly. Draco could tell that he was worried but he was trying to be calm. “I’ll just shower and get dressed then I can come over if you want. You got a flat above the shop yeah?”
“Poncy entitled Slytherin snobs?” Harry asked with a raised eyebrow. “I believe that’s what you called them anyway.”
“I’m not sure.” Daphne said honestly. “But I think he’s a bit of a broken man deep down. I mean does anyone really know Harry Potter? I watched him at school, maybe not as closely as you but I still did and I’ve read everything there is to read about him. Yet one short conversation with him completely changed everything I thought I knew.  All I’m saying is maybe you don’t know him like you think you do. Maybe he’s changed or maybe he’s always been different than we thought.”
Fred perched onto the bed next to Harry and seemed to reach out to touch him for a second but then thought better of it and drew his hand back into his lap.
Harry blushed in a way that Draco thought was very cute. Maybe Harry really was doing this all for him, was that what Fred was implying? Draco didn’t know anyone would care about him this much to go to all this trouble.
Harry said he could come back later but he was going to contact Dean and Seamus to get the flat sorted as soon as possible and then pop into the Ministry. He also said he said something to sort out but he didn’t tell Draco what it was and Draco didn’t ask, Harry was entitled to some privacy after all. Harry was gone for much longer than Draco thought he’d be but it didn’t really matter as he was able to just focus on his brewing which was going very well now he felt so relaxed. Kreacher popped into the potions lab at four o’clock to tell him that Harry was in the kitchen and wanted to speak to Draco if it was convenient. Fortunately Draco was at a good place to pause what he was doing so he went to go find him.
“I know what you mean.” Harry said. “Anyway, this is the bit where I need Kingsley to step in and edit where necessary. We agreed that I’m not to use the word ‘horcrux’ in the book and am under no circumstances ever explain how to make a horcrux but just that Riddle ‘tethered’ his soul to seven objects and that we had to destroy them in order to kill him.”
Suddenly though Malfoy smiled and Harry felt a strange sense of achievement for being the one that made him smile.
Harry made a start in the kitchen with Kreacher. He decided he’d just keep it simple with the comfort food that Kreacher did best, hopefully Draco would like it. Kreacher focused on his signature steak and kidney pie whilst Harry did the sides of creamy mash, peas and gravy. Draco came down just as they were finishing off, it was perfect timing. It was strange to have someone else in the house to think about, Harry did like the fact that Draco was here but he would definitely have to get used to it.
Harry watched as Draco stepped back into his room and started to close the door behind him, just calling out before he disappeared from view.
He crossed the empty street and knocked on the door. He expected to be greeted by the house elf but instead it was Harry himself who answered the door. He was dressed in normal blue jeans not quite as trendy or fitted as the ones he’s worn before and a plain black long sleeved top. His hair was slightly tidier than it had been earlier but looked slightly wirey. Draco made a mental note to give the man some proper luxury shampoo.
The corner of Potter’s mouth turned up slightly and he tilted his head on one side to look at Draco again in a way that made Draco slightly nervous.
Draco shrugged. “Had to get my laptop.” He said, leaning down to pick it up and then walking around the desk to the main reception area.
She looked a little taken aback but fortunately for her she could the slight pause in conversation as Hopsy served dinner to compose herself.
If Kingsley was coming then this was a serious chat then. No doubt he was in for a warning but Robards said he wasn’t in any trouble. Probably meant it would just be a slap on the wrist and then back to work. He decided to just drink his coffee and stay quiet. He needed the caffeine hit anyway, he couldn’t get through most mornings without at least three coffees. Gawain seemed in good spirits and was chatting to Harry about the weekend he’d just had but Harry was only pretending to listen and nodding politely. Fortunately it wasn’t long before Kingsley walked in. Harry and his boss immediately stood up respectfully.
There was a pause and the air was thick with tension until Harry spoke again still maintaining eye contact with Draco.
“Master Draco’s friends must forgive Kreacher’s late arrival but Kreacher be checking on the dinner, it’s been too long since Kreacher had to do a proper dinner party sir and madam.” He said with his head still bowed. His nose was so close to the floor that Draco had to try hard not to laugh.
He realised he’d been walking the long way back to his for no reason whatsoever other than he just needed to think and process things. Maybe he was giving himself more time to prepare to share his small intimate space with one of the hottest men he’d ever seen.
There is a slight loss of control issue in this chapter but I don't want to say too much without spoiling it, just be aware of that if that's an issue for you. I will say that it is not sexual in nature though.
Blaise turned and gave Draco a firm look. “You can’t hide from the world forever Draco.” He said seriously but nonetheless he turned and headed back towards him.

Hadn’t Draco just said Harry could tell him anything? Hadn’t Harry just promised himself to be open and honest with Draco?
“Why is the idea of you being a father depressing?” Daphne asked in a quieter, more serious voice than she had been using earlier.
*Possible trigger warning: mentions of an attack, mild violence, getting beaten up etc. but it's not graphic
They ended up oven cooking fish and chips from the freezer and having them with peas done in the microwave as Harry couldn't be bothered to cook properly. Over dinner Draco told him that he’d met with Graham today in his lunch break, originally still disguised as Pierre but felt confident enough at the end to tell him who he really was. As predicted Graham really didn’t seem to care he was just grateful for a place to live and said he’d happily work three days for Draco for free in exchange.
“Harry it’s fine. It’s really not a big deal if it helps you to sleep. It’s a big bed and I’ll keep my pyjamas on and my hands to myself don’t worry!” George assured Harry laughing.
“Thank you for having me. Sorry if I put you on the spot, I got the impression that I wasn’t exactly welcome but I just wasn’t sure where else to meet.” Draco said, stepping into the hallway.
He’d recorded all the events of second and third year now too to go with the first few draft chapters but the notes were scrappy and the writing didn’t flow. The quill only wrote what he dictated and he kept getting distracted so it wasn’t a massive surprise to find that half the pages didn’t really make sense. It was difficult to make progress though when his mind was constantly wandering to Draco. What was Draco doing now? How was he feeling? Was he OK? Was he thinking of Harry as much as Harry was thinking about him?
“Well this has been a very pleasant evening Harry. Please let’s do it again.” Daphne said politely with a delicate hand on his arm again.
There was a large skylight window in the attic roof that you could barely see before as it was black with filth but Kreacher made it sparkling clean so it flooded the attic with light and they could use it to let the owls hunt at night and set them off on their journeys when they needed them for post. They would have to remember to cast a ‘notice-me-not’ charm on them when they wanted to use them during the day so the muggle neighbourhood didn’t become too suspicious but that was easily done.
Draco pushed all sexual thoughts about Harry to one side and tried his best to ignore his hard cock. It would go down on it’s own in time, maybe thinking about Professor Umbridge would help, that had always worked for him in fifth year whenever he’d seen Harry. Toad faced Umbridge with her fluffy pink cardigans and her stupid kitten plates… yes that was definitely helping. Draco wasn’t going to be the one who chased Harry, not anymore, not when he was living here and he needed him this much. He would hate to misinterpret things and drive Harry away, the man’s friendship and hospitality were the most important things to him right now. Also, most of his pride had been shattered now Harry knew so much about his life but he still had a little left that he wanted to keep. He wasn’t sure he’d cope with putting himself out there and then being rejected.
“Well, it’s a long story and… you might be mad at me but maybe you can just focus on the job and be mad at me later?” Harry suggested tentatively.
“I can see that!” Harry laughed again and nodded. “And by the way I don’t think that all Slytherins are evil.” He said as a serious afterthought before finishing his starter and picking up his red wine again.
There was movement now, outside on the landing. Draco was up and he was going down the stairs. What would Draco do when he didn’t find Harry in the kitchen as normal? Would he be upset or relieved? That was partly why Harry was hiding in his room with his coffee he supposed, then at least the morning would be different than any other in some way. If Draco wanted to ignore the kiss and not face Harry then he could. He could get his own breakfast now and start the day without Harry. Maybe it was a cowardly move, maybe he should be waiting for Draco this morning but Harry wasn’t sure if he could cope with the pain if Draco told him he regretted the moment they had shared. Not when it was the best thing that had happened to Harry in a long time.
“Then, last week you told me you needed to go out and hook up with someone immediately after you’d seen Potter for the first time despite the fact that you haven’t been interested in that since you’ve been back here. You were really on edge that night and you had plenty of opportunities but you couldn’t go through with it but the guy who you almost accepted did kind of have a bit of a resemblance to someone…”
After a while though Draco started to stretch and sat himself back up. He leaned back against the arm of the sofa still facing towards Harry and brought his legs up over Harry’s lap, summoning his latte and warming it up slightly with a lazy flick of his wand.
It was difficult to decide what to wear first after his bath and resisted the urge to try everything on all at once knowing that he didn’t have too much time. He did try a few different things on though and in the end settled for his first pair of ‘acid wash’ mid grey jeans. He supposed they were called that because of the lighted faded look they had, a muggle trend apparently according to the catalogue but Draco found he could liked them and the slim fit really was perfect seeing as though they were quite literally made for him.
“George we’re not doing anything you prat.” Fred called back whilst giving Harry a bit of glance in silent questioning.
I promise George and Fred will be back too but Draco might need a little bit more time before he can look Fred in the eye!
Draco smiled a tiny smile allowing himself a flicker of hope. Somehow hearing it from someone else gave him confidence. Blaise was always good at reading people and situations, the man was rarely wrong.
“Hey, no.” Harry said squeezing his hand. “From now on you should always know that if I’m invited somewhere then you’re invited too because all my family and friends have accepted you and I don’t care about the opinions of anyone else. I always want you by my side.”
Shit. No, he didn’t mean that. He didn’t want Harry! ...except he did… he very much did. He’d always told himself that these stupid feelings were purely physical but after dinner on Saturday night he wasn’t so sure. He knew deep down that the more he saw of the real man that Harry had become the more he was intrigued by him and the more he liked him.
Finally they arrived at a row of VIP boxes at the top of the stands. In the middle of the two sections separated slightly from the rest of the boxes was what could only be described as a black square mass. The walls weren’t solid, they were rippling slightly in the air but you could not see through them. There was no door but Harry led them to it and stood to one side waving Blaise through. Blaise simply stepped into the rippling black wave and disappeared from sight. Daphne came around Draco and went next. Harry was looking around carefully at the space where he thought Draco was and then after a minute he stepped through too.
Harry thought this polite detached quiet Draco was the one he slipped into when he was worried about revealing too much. He didn’t like him nearly as much as the laughing carefree relaxed Draco he’d caught glimpses of but he knew it was still early days in their friendship and he thought there was still a lot he didn’t know about him.
Looking at the watch the Weasleys had given him when he came of age that he still wore on his left wrist, he realised he’d spent too much time daydreaming and he was almost in danger of being late. He didn’t even bother looking at his hair, he just applied some aftershave, smiled to himself as he remembered who had made it, and then apparated on the spot thinking about the address Daphne had given him.
“Well other than your annoying amount of fan mail I see no harm that’s really come from this as long as she doesn’t come near you again” Draco said casually. “Thanks for telling me though and checking I’m alright with it.”
Harry thought there might be a flicker of sadness in her voice. He thought that she must be being honest about Malfoy (or maybe he wasn’t Malfoy anymore, that was still confusing to him) and she didn’t seem recently heartbroken. Maybe there was someone else a while back.
Draco snapped back up and turned fiercely towards him. “I’m sorry, did you just say your cupboard?!”
“Hey.” Harry said, greeting him with a big grin after Draco had been rendered speechless for a few minutes.
“There’s a slight problem in your plan though.” Draco said. “My flat is hardly in a habitable condition.”
There was a slight pause and Draco caught Blaise and Daphne giving each other a bit of a knowing look.
Harry had also told Draco all about Dumbledore’s special lessons with him that year of course, all the pensive trips they’d taken and how much he’d learnt about Tom Riddle’s past with each one. He explained how Dumbledore had tasked him with getting one final memory from Slughorn, the amusing story of how he’d done that and then exactly what the memory had contained and why Harry had been forced to ‘suck up’ to his potions professor.
There was another moment where it seemed like time stood still and then Harry                                   leaned over and gave Draco a fierce possessive kiss.
He turned his attention back to the french press he was making and spoke to Draco over his shoulder trying to sound casual. “So was it just the mattress before keeping you from sleeping, you know, at the flat?”
He wasn’t sure how much he wanted to admit… but then hadn’t Draco proved he could listen and not judge? Hadn't Draco proved he cared, that he would help? If this… ‘relationship’ stood a chance then Harry knew they would have to carry on opening up to one another.
Draco looked at the outstretched hand. He never thought that Potter would hold his hand out to him and he was reminded of that time of the train all those years ago picturing them at eleven years old with an outstretched hand between them. Only that time it had been Draco’s and Potter hadn’t taken it. It had made him so angry, how dare Potter refuse him and think that he was better than him, he had half a mind to refuse Potter now only he wasn’t Draco. He was Pierre and Pierre would never refuse a handshake with a client.
He was pleased to see that Harry was indeed wearing the same black slim fit jeans he had been wearing before. His legs were definitely thicker than Draco’s so wouldn’t suit the skinny fit as well as him but the slim fit hugged Harry’s muscles without tapering in too much at the bottom and without having the ridiculous flare he’d seen on some muggle jeans. He’d kept the look casual and sports like with trainers but they were still smart and trendy. On the top he was wearing a simple round neck deep red jumper. Nothing special and it didn’t take Draco’s breath away but the man still looked good. Draco liked seeing this casual relaxed attire on him too and thought he probably looked good in anything now.
Draco thought about it for a moment as they continued to enjoy their dinner. “Will it just be the four of us in the private box?”
Draco shifted slightly towards Harry and leaned that way tucking his feet up next to him. His left thigh was so close to Harry’s right one now that they were almost touching. Almost but not quite.
After breakfast, and a kiss he went to floo call Graham and catch up with how his work on Saturday went and set him up with work for the day today. He was still impressed with his new shop assistant and half wondered whether he could teach him how to make other products, not just potions so he wouldn’t have to cope with these bespoke orders by himself. It would probably be worth it to have someone else who knew the products before the Christmas rush that he was hoping to get.
Suddenly the fact that it had been the first time Draco had orgasmed by anything other than his own hand for the first time in over two years wasn’t enough any more. He wanted to fuck Harry right here right now on this very sofa… He could… but he didn’t know if he should… Would Harry want that? Draco could feel himself going hard again at the thought and was tempted to look down to see if Harry was.
Harry and Draco start getting into their childhoods here so mentions of past child abuse including neglect and emotional abuse but not physical or sexual. Draco talks about his parents' marriage too so that might be a trigger point for those who have experience with abusive relationships.
She straightened up and returned to her more regal stiff posture that was so familiar but Draco could see the cracks in her mask as she spoke. “Draco dear, it is good to see you. Thank you for agreeing to see me.”
Harry coughed and then brought the conversation back around. “I was thinking that Draco could offer the flat to Graham for free in exchange for part time help around his job and then you guys can drop Graham to part time here without feeling guilty that you’re leaving him with half the income. If he doesn’t have to pay rent anywhere then he’ll still be financially better off. You guys can work out which days you each want him between you all.”
“I’ll tell you later. Need food and sleep and then I’ll tell you.” Draco said a bit more coherently and holding his own weight against his friend now, slowly pulling away from him.
“Welcome Auror Potter, take a seat and I’ll be with you in just a moment.” He said finishing the line he was writing.
He took it from the auror, unscrolled it and began to read. A few moments later he looked back up at Leo who was still standing there smiling at him.
Ginny herself arrived later on after a bit of a celebration with her team and yes, you guessed it, she arrived hand-in-hand with Oliver Wood himself who was looking delighted despite his team’s loss. Apparently their relationship was incredibly new, as in it had literally just happened! They’d been flirting on and off for the best part of a year but had both been training so hard that nothing had happened but in the moment Oliver had grabbed her for a hug at the end of the match they both knew what they wanted and decided to just jump in with both feet.
This conversation was exhausting Draco. He didn’t understand what Daphne was on about and he didn’t want to think about Potter anymore. In fact he suddenly decided that he really did not want to see him. He was too irritated, the whole day had been a disaster and Potter was the last person who would make him feel better. Plus his emotions were all over the place that he didn’t trust himself to perform well as Pierre like he usually did.
Draco didn’t say anything, he was just weighing up whether he wanted Blaise’s help again or not. Part of him didn’t of course but he realised he might have to start accepting help more and he did want to look perfect for Harry. It wouldn’t do for Harry to think he only had one pair of jeans he supposed.
“It’s not that I don’t want you here or anything, because I do but why can’t you live with Blaise? You were at his yesterday right? Has something happened?” Harry said, scratching his head.
“I don’t eat a lot to be honest. Always preferred quality over quantity, and you know I have to watch my figure!” He said jokingly.
“Yes.” Harry said victoriously. “Cheers to getting drunk and finding out what Draco sodding Malfoy is doing on this island the other side of the world” He said, picking up his own pineapple and raising it in the air before lowering it to take a large sip of his own.
Harry was really pleased for them and thought they made a good couple but he couldn’t help feeling a bit jealous about how easily they had suddenly just decided to be together and make each other happy. Was it really that easy for some people? Did others struggle like he did?
Yesterday he had been more emotionally vulnerable than he’d ever been in front of anyone. He’d broken down a couple of times in front of Blaise and now Daphne once but he’d always managed to pull back a little bit, get himself together and then let it all out completely when they’d gone. He could let his defences down with his two best friends but it had taken him years to do so and even now they were still intact around them, ready to pull back up at any time if needed.
There were two rows of four seats, the back one slightly higher than the front one and each row had a narrow ledge in front of the seats where you could put drinks or something on. The seats themselves were dark green and gold padded ones to match the Holyheads colours and they looked much more comfortable and luxurious than the ones he’d sat on for the Quidditch world cup all those years ago. They were standing on a small platform behind the seats where there was a little empty bar tucked into the corner.
The night time was usually something he dreaded yet now he found himself willing away the day just so he could be sitting with Potter, looking out at the night sky and drinking hot cocoa, being more open and honest with him than Draco had ever been with anyone in his life. How had so much changed in the last 24 hours? Soon enough he got his wish. He got out of bed around midnight and crept up to the Astronomy tower. They hadn’t exactly agreed on a time, they usually just happened to meet up here but Draco knew he couldn’t sleep anyway so he may as well just wait here for him.
Harry’s face was beautifully flushed and his hair was indescribably messy. Draco couldn’t help but laugh.
He had even made some alterations to his suite making his black desk grey and transfiguring the old fashioned chesterfield into a more modern loveseat, also grey. The grey goes nicely with the green, black and silver and Draco thought it freshened the rooms up a bit and made them lighter. More than anything he just wanted a bit of a change. He still kept his favourite chair the same though and the bedroom wasn't really that different with the exception of grey curtains instead of the dark green ones that had blended into the wallpaper. He made his way downstairs thinking at least he’d have something to talk to his mother about over tea. He went through the parlour and into the conservatory, grateful that the route avoided the dining room. He wasn’t sure he could face eating at that table yet and he guessed his mother felt the same way having chosen the conservatory.
Draco automatically started to make some toast, feeling more confident today and not even asking Harry. He reminded himself of what he’d seen in some of the cupboards and did have to open a few before he got the right ones but after a short time and not too much effort he’d placed a tray of spreads, a rack of toast, two knives and two plates on the kitchen table. Harry sat down with the two mugs of coffee and they tucked in.
Harry smiled a kind of knowing smile that Draco didn’t quite understand. He shifted again and bought his right arm down from the top of the sofa and placed it gently on Draco’s thigh. “It will be alright.” Was all he said.
Draco smiled to himself when Harry coughed slightly and looked away slightly flushed and couldn’t help himself.
Mother was quite simply sitting at the kitchen table sipping her tea and reading Witch Weekly like nothing was happening. Draco also noticed that she’d transfigured one of the chairs to make it look much more elegant and comfortable. He knew from experience that the simple black wooden chairs in the kitchen weren’t much to look at but they were plenty comfortable enough and anyway if they weren’t a simple cushioning charm would have sufficed. She was deliberately being difficult even after everything Harry had done yesterday to help her.
“Anyway, my magic has always been strong but I’ve never felt like I’ve had that much control over it. I’m not book smart, I always found it difficult to learn spells from theory but when it came to actually doing them in the moment, if I needed a spell to work then it would just work… it would always be tied into how I felt at that time though. Does that make sense?” He said to Draco wondering if he was just talking nonsense.
It had been hours but Draco wasn’t sure if this was the end or the beginning as he sat there with his parents either side of him huddling together. It felt like the end as he looked around at all the crumbling stone and cracked windows that once was the Great Hall but was now just evidence of death and destruction. But the end of what? The end of the war? Was it truly over? There was an eerie sense of calm about the place now that only hours ago had seemed frantic. The sobs from earlier had stopped and although many a face was still tear stained, there were also some nervous smiles being exchanged between loved ones as if they wanted to be happy but they weren’t quite sure if they were allowed to be yet. The four long tables had been put back but no one was sitting according to house, they were all mingling together, teachers, pupils, parents and magical creatures alike. Some just sitting still, some holding each other, some sharing in quiet conversation.
“Excuse me! I work… sometimes! Perks of being your own boss!” Blaise smirked arrogantly. “Although I’ll admit I haven’t really got anything to do today, Harper is getting all the paperwork done and I’ve pushed any client meetings until tomorrow so I’m free for the rest of the day for anything you need.”
Potter but if he was honest with himself, he hadn’t hated Potter in a while. He realised that when he saw him at the Manor last Easter. If he’d hated him he would have gladly handed him in but not even Potter deserved that. Potter had killed the
“You can’t have a house elf in the penthouse! They need to have somewhere to sleep themselves you know, plus they would need an actual kitchen to work from not that flashy pretend kitchen that no one has ever actually cooked in.” Draco sneered, but in an affectionate way.
“I know” Blaise sighed, “I’m still sorry though.” He said looking out of the dirty shop front window. “I’ll buy you a whole new wardrobe, I’ll replace it all. What else? Your broom, your books…” He trailed off uncertain.
“... and how you treated Pansy 4th year was typical of a gay boy with a crush in denial! We all know who was suddenly getting even more attention than usual that year and for all the right reasons!” Blaise added and paused before continuing.
As he walked across the grounds he realised that he hadn’t been flying in so long and he was determined it would put a smile back on his face. When even was the last time he was on a broom? He thought to himself as he reached the outbuilding and opened the door. Suddenly as he was faced with the neat rack of broomsticks he remembered the last time and slammed the door shut quickly.
“Your turn to make it today.” He said cheerfully as he strolled right past Draco and went to sit at the kitchen table expectantly.
“Anyway, I’m still annoyed at you for stealing seven of these from under my nose.” Ron said back at Harry.
“What’s this?” He said skeptically at Blaise firmly crossing her arms across his chest not yet taking the bag from him.
“We had a really lovely dinner actually, I have to say he is very impressive as a person and I rather like him. He-”
Harry leaned in and kissed Draco this time, full on the mouth with no ounce of hesitation. It wasn’t quite chaste, it was determined and he lingered for longer than necessary but he drew back before it became anything more. He wanted to see Draco’s face.
If he thought he’d seen his father angry before it was nothing compared to how he looked now. If he was honest with himself Draco was scared. He hated conflict now and avoided it if he could, he hadn’t had to fight since the war and he suddenly felt sick as his father drew his wand and walked out the front door towards him. It seemed like a duel on the front lawn was inevitable. He didn’t let his fear show though, he was strong, he could do this.
Harry turned to Draco who seemed to be drinking his wine at a quicker pace than Harry had seen him before and was now refilling his glass to the top again.
“Yeah… they’re real.” Harry said placing Draco’s hand back on top of his chest and resting his own over the top of it.
Harry came to stand by his side and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek. “I’m proud of you.” He whispered in his ear so that no one else could hear.
Harry, again reacting in instinct but thinking Draco needed encouragement gave his hand a gentle squeeze as Draco had done moments ago to him. The touch was enough for Draco to look back into Harry’s eyes.
Hermione gave him that annoying mothering smile that made it look like she was worried about him. “Yes I think that’s a good idea Harry.”
Breakfast had been tense and silent this morning, even more so than usual. Draco had forced himself to eat a few mouthfuls of toast as he wasn’t sure where his next meal would come from, but it hadn’t done this sick feeling in his stomach any favours. The two aurors that had been their guardians for just over a month had escorted them to the Ministry about an hour ago, introduced them to an Auror Savage and then left without a word. Savage had taken the three of them to this holding cell and they hadn’t seen anyone since.
Relationships were about compromise right? And doing what was best for both of you? Or so he gathered… Maybe Draco should be thinking about what would be best for both of them and for the future of their relationship instead of just himself. Hmm, maybe. He would give it some thought but he wasn’t convinced. This relationship stuff was harder than he thought it would be.
“But that’s exactly how I feel about you, you silly man.” Harry countered smiling back at him. “I guarantee you that anything you do to me will feel ten times better than anything I’ve experienced with anyone else because it’s you.”
How's the story going? Too long yet? Shall I try and progress it a bit more quickly or do you like the pace and all the little fluffy moments?!
“Thanks, I will definitely check them out.” Draco said smiling, he was hoping Harry would let him read the books he’d already spotted in the pantry.
Just then the Head Auror himself walked into the office that Harry shared with his partner Ron who had just left to get the next coffee round in.
“That does make sense.” Harry said honestly. “I can see it from your point of view and like I said, there’s nothing to forgive from back then it’s just how we were but it’s not how we are now.”
There were a few cheers from the group and some welcome nods from familiar faces coming Harry’s way. He couldn’t help but smile at them. Ron was right really, he’d always just kind of done his own thing when he’d been working here but he had forgotten these rare moments where it felt good to be part of a team, part of something.
“A good catch up over dinner is just what you need then!” Harry said happily. He felt less guilty going out and leaving Draco alone tomorrow now. “Just tell Kreacher what you want to eat or leave it up to him whichever, and help yourself to the wine in the cellar.”
“That was delicious babe, but I’ve got to go.” He said calmly and tried very hard not to laugh as Harry’s eyes grew wide in surprise.
He ran down to the stairs and out towards the front of the school as so many others were doing now, blending into the crowd as they were all trying to catch a glimpse of their hero, praying it would not be true. With his black hood pulled over his platinum hair, one noticed him. They were all looking at one thing… the lifeless body in the half-giant’s arms. He could see it now too. There was no mistaking that messy mop of jet black hair.
“You OK?” He asked. Draco nodded slowly and smiled at Harry but he didn’t seem to have any words. “You should look at it.” Harry said softly. “You might be pleasantly surprised.”
His mother tensed ever so slightly and looked a little taken aback but Draco could only see it because he knew her so well. “Very well, say what you need to say.” She replied coldly.
After not thinking about him in years his name had come up a lot today, it was very strange. Harry wondered why he hadn’t thought about him in so long considering how closely their lives had been intertwined for so long. How many hours had he spent thinking of him in sixth year, watching him on the map, obsessing about what he was up to. Now he had no idea where he was or what he was doing but he then remembered that he’d just spoken to someone today who would surely know how to find him, she said they were still friends. Maybe he would have to have another conversation with Miss Greengrass, he thought as he added one last name on the bottom of his list.
Everyone in the room let out a collected sigh of relief that they didn’t realise they were holding and Harry saw a small hint of colour flooding back into Draco’s face. It was still pale but it was normal now, not the tinge of grey it had been for most of the day. He looked up at Harry and gave him a tiny smile but he said most of his thoughts with his sparkling silvery eyes.
He wondered if Harry ever actually slept in his bedroom. He had claimed the room opposite Draco’s was his yet Draco had yet to see him go in or out of it. It was obvious that Harry did use the shared bathroom on that floor at least on occasion though and he must go into his room to get dressed. Currently he was still wearing his pajamas but Draco always liked seeing him in them. To be fair though Draco liked seeing him in anything. He wondered what it would be like to see him in nothing at all…
“Sounds great thank you.” Draco replied before hesitating slightly. “You doing it yourself? The muggle way?”
“What?” Ron said happily. “You didn’t think we’d get rid of them did you? Kingsley said you could still come in on any case right? Well I’m bringing you in, full auror privileges so suit up, let’s go.”
“Yes.” Harry confirmed. “The grave we saw the symbol of the Deathly Hallows on in Godric’s Hollow was Ignotus Peverell-”
Draco was extremely happy with his new clothes and it was nice to see his large wardrobe in his room and the chest of drawers actually completely full. If he was honest he could do with more space in the wardrobe, his dress robes didn’t quite hang properly in there. Never mind, it was a good problem to have really and he couldn’t find it in him to care at this moment.
Fred and George were always so relaxed and never cared about Harry coming and going from their flat whenever he fancied it. They also never worried about him or nagged if he was late or didn’t come at all.
“Not like this you wouldn’t, and that’s OK. I get it.” Blaise shrugged. “Besides, I think Daphne is really happy at her Grandmother’s house. I know it’s sad that she died but I honestly do think the place is perfect for Daphne… She hasn’t said as much but I don’t think she’ll want to leave.”
“I have never once lied about it… technically.” Fred said carefully and then he sighed and looked at Harry.
Draco asked Harry if he could add what he knew of the first world war and his father being a Death Eater in the book here. Everything he’d grown up knowing and the hypocrisy of his father having extremist views and wanting the end result of the war but not wanting to personally be involved in making it happen. He wanted to include the feelings he had when hearing Harry’s words about Riddle being back and knowing in that moment what it would have meant for his family if it was true. Even though then he would never have believed an underage wizard would have been branded by the dark mark so he had thought himself safe from that for three years at least.
Draco on the other hand kept his cool and was starting to enjoy this ever so slightly. “I have purchased my own home, that is all you need to know.”
Harry laughed slightly but agreed. Hermione was right, Ron needed a few more beers in him before anything else was revealed. He was also more likely to be amenable after a big dinner too. They ate and chatted happily, mostly about what was going on at the Ministry. It was always work with these two. Harry fed Rose again like he often did on a Friday night. She was getting much better at doing some of it herself now though.
“Come on then let’s sit in the office and you can talk me through them.” Draco and went into the other door next to the one that led to stairs.
The restored Black family tapestry was the centerpiece of the room and the rest was done in dark greens and browns to match but it was more regal than the homely sitting room with touches of gold around the room bringing out the gold threads of the tapestry. Draco loved looking at the tapestry every time he was in here. Seeing his face here and the name ‘Draco Black’, the name which he’d chosen for himself, really made him feel like this was his home now too as much as Harry’s. It was nice though that the magic of the tapestry had recognised Harry and that they could both be on the family tree even though, mercifully, they weren’t related.
“Will you stop being such a drama queen?” He said affectionately as Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. “Nothing is going wrong. Come on, what did you have in mind? I’m yours, do whatever.”
Still quite a few plot developments to get in... I'm worried I've got carried away and it's going to be too long!!
Draco looked slightly confused and uncomfortable for a second. “I don’t know what that is, sorry.” He said quietly.
“Oh great.” He said but she was already rushing him out the door as the first customers were arriving, not that it mattered if they saw him.
“She was going on and on about it yesterday at Sunday lunch!” Harry said picking up Fred’s boxers from the floor and throwing them at him.
Harry felt a bit out of his depth, he’d never been in a restaurant this fancy and was beginning to regret going with Daphne’s recommendation but he usually went to muggle restaurants and he wasn’t sure if she would like that or not.
Harry was stunned into silence and couldn’t even move. The Draco in front of him now wasn’t the one he’d seen over the last week. This was the boy who hated him, he could see it in Draco’s eyes. He hated him.
Draco’s eyes lit up for a moment. “In that case my favorite is milky with cinnamon if you have that and it’s not too much trouble.”
“That makes a lot of sense for someone in your position and I can understand your reasoning.” Draco said when Harry was finished.
His eyes went wide as he swallowed the slushy pineapple drink down. It was sweet at first but then there was a kick of fiery ginger and a whopping great burn of rum in the back of his throat.
They were still sitting up on top of Draco’s bed after the rather rushed but still damn good handjob that Harry had given him. He’d been too caught up in the feelings to pay much attention to Harry which he felt a bit bad about but he gathered Harry had sorted himself out. Draco has always been a selfish lover and he’d never cared to rectify it before but with Harry he knew he’d have to make more of an effort in the future.
Harry laughed. “No we don’t really. I mean we had a few run-ins at the beginning but it was mostly just me being an idiot and him letting me know how stupid I was being. That’s what I like about him, he always calls me out on my bullshit. He never treats me like a hero figure yet he does still admire me for what I’ve been through on a personal level the same way I do with him. He’s been good to me you know. He got me to stop drinking so much and I’ve cut out the potions completely. I actually sleep at night now and I feel happy in my own home.”
Around five o’clock he had finished work for the day and he was smelling some delicious smells from the kitchen. He could also hear some music which was new. He walked into the kitchen somewhat stealthily which was easy over the noise of the music and hovered in the doorway to watch Harry for a moment. He was sort of dancing, but badly and chopping vegetables at the same time. On the stove was a pan of different spices being toasted off which is where the lovely smell was coming from. The music seemed to be coming from this small rectangular black box with a long silver thing sticking out of the top.
“Honestly Harry it’s fine. I just wanted you to understand why I spoke the way I did in Madam Malkins that day that’s all.” Draco said calmly and confidently, looking Harry straight in the eye this time.
Clearly he used his own products, Harry thought to himself smiling, his skin and his hair were simply flawless. He could almost be seen as slightly feminine with his smooth soft skin and silky hair, except his chiseled jaw was incredibly masculine. His clothes weren’t quite as fancy as Harry thought they would be, he had a simple black belt and black shoes and no fancy jewellery. They were nice though, they suited him and Harry thought he liked this more ‘down-to-earth’ Draco.
“That’s a great idea.” Harry said, walking over to Draco and giving him a hug as he’d put the tart on the counter.
Draco laughed a bit. “I used to swim.” He replied seriously after a moment. “I find water calming as you know but the exercise was good for me mentally and physically.”
“Oh right, that would be my Aunt Andromeda’s daughter? And she married Professor Lupin right? I knew they got married and... I- I know their names were on the memorial after… but I never knew they had a son.” He said frowning.
“I, erm, I really didn’t expect this tonight, It’s not why I invited you at all, but erm, well you’ve given me a lot to think about I guess, I think I needed it so thank you.” He said sincerely.
Harry still hadn’t gotten used to the fact that there was someone else sleeping in the house now. It definitely helped make the house feel less empty but somehow Harry still couldn’t bring himself to go to bed. He had tried but it still felt too big, too empty and too quiet for him. He preferred the cosiness of the sofa and the noise of the TV in the background. He would drift in and out of sleep here but he couldn’t shake the notion that if he fell asleep too deeply then the nightmares would come back so it was only ever a light fitful kind of sleep.
“Yes, me too,” Draco said sadly. Harry noticed his right hand just gently touching his left forearm absentmindedly. “But I meant it was a shame for you that the prophecy smashed, not for Him, or me. I’m glad he never got to hear whatever it was as he obviously wanted to, but do you think you’d like to have known? Whether the whole ‘chosen one’ thing was true or not?”
He walked through to his bedroom and saw a single rose on his bedside table next to a small vial of potion. He knew the dusty pink English rose was his mother’s favorite so he assumed the potion was from her. He recognised the potion immediately too. So far, he had been avoiding taking Dreamless Sleep, he knew how addictive it could be and he always thought he would just cope without it. After all, a lack of sleep was hardly a new thing for him now and he didn’t like being dependent on a potion to help.
“Well the Ministry can’t be seen to have lost their Golden Boy can they?!” Draco said bitterly before he could stop himself.
“I told you, it’s just made up. You have to kind of forget what we know to be real and just enjoy it for what it is.”
“I do know though that he worked it out on his own. He said to be sure that you didn’t think the twins had betrayed you as they definitely hadn’t. I didn’t even know you’d spoken to the Weasley twins let alone that they knew who you were.” She said in mild accusation.
He knew Potter had been brought up by muggles but surely he would have gone away with them. He had money so surely they would too? Even the Weasley family had been to Egypt! Draco realised that he didn’t actually know anything about Potter’s upbringing though. A question for another night perhaps.
“Molly” Harry cut her off firmly. “It really means so much to me that you would welcome him into your home without even knowing who he is and that you would go to all this effort but as I told you in my letter, it really is extremely early days. We’ve not even been together for a week yet and it’s just too early to meet the families. I really don’t want to put any pressure on the relationship, we’re just enjoying getting to know each other properly.”
“Sleep well babe.” He said, not quite able to help himself. He really had only meant to say it once as a joke but somehow it just seemed to have stuck as it made him smile every time he thought about it. It was a while before dinner, he would wake him then.
George though had slept deeply so hadn’t noticed and when he woke up the next morning Harry pretended that he’d just woken up too. Harry was relieved on Tuesday morning to see the shop open as normal and felt like he didn’t really have an excuse to hang around the flat anymore so he thanked Fred and George once again for patching him up and listening to him, then went back home to continue his writing at Grimmauld.
Daphne knew better than to outright lie to him but she was stubborn too. “Perhaps, but like I’ve said before, it’s not my place to tell you Draco. I did my bit my talking to you initially and inviting both you and Harry over for dinner, the rest is up to you. I’m not getting involved just as Harry doesn’t get involved in me and George now. If you want to know then talk to Harry.”
“Yeah. Dromeda, Teddy and Narcissa know too.” Harry said shifting slightly. He was hoping Hermione wouldn’t mind not being the first to know.
Ron shrugged. “We figured we’d give you the time you needed but we knew if something came up you’d be there, it’s just who you are… but erm, you- you know you can always say no right?” He added with a bit of uncertainty.
“I didn’t pack my case.” Harry said casually. “Half of these clothes I’ve never even seen before. Guessing Sam organised for me to get some new stuff for the honeymoon. I mean, what the hell are these?” He asked, pulling out a pair of bright red swimming trunks with white hearts all over them.
Maybe it would be better to just stay here and not come back up. He could do it. He could simply stop breathing and allow the water to take him away. Here, in this moment, he wasn’t hurting and he could stay like this forever and never hurt again. He would never hurt anyone else again either. Except, maybe his mother. It would hurt her, Draco knew that and no matter how much he wanted to take the cowards way out, he could never knowingly hurt her. He came back up out of the water quickly and very ungracefully, choking and spluttering everywhere. Despite the fact the water was still hot he felt cold and shaky and suddenly decided he couldn’t bear to be in here any longer.
“Harry?” Draco prompted again when Harry didn’t answer. Draco came and simply sat opposite him cross legged on the wooden floor of his bedroom close enough to reach out and touch him.
Draco just shrugged. “I have nothing pressing and I told Bex I might not see her this week. No big deal.”
Blaise smiled too clearly seeing through the offer but that didn’t matter, they both knew how Slytherin friendships worked. “Make it twice a week and you have a deal.” Draco frowned and went to interrupt him but Blaise carried on quickly. “Twice because then we can have a catch up just the two of us once and the other time Daphne can join us, it’s what I want.”
He settled back down on the sofa and turned towards Daphne again. “You know something.” Draco said accusingly. He’d been watching her expression when he spoke about Harry not being here before.
Fred was obviously surprised by this and let out a long low breath of air before speaking. “Merlin Harry, you serious?”
“Don’t worry about that, we can get Dean and Seamus in, they did this place. They’re great.” Harry said confidently.
“OK.” Harry replied as he stroked Draco’s thigh, too tired really to say anything else on the matter but still reassured by Draco’s words.
Draco didn’t want to offend Harry when the man seemed to be trying to make him happy so he tentatively spooned some onto his plate before taking one of the circular things and breaking it slightly as the others had done. He scooped up some of the chutney onto a shard and tried it.
He huffed and shook his head in disbelief, he hadn’t really analysed his relationship with Fred for ages and saying it out loud he was aware of how stupid it all sounded. How did he get here?! “I know if I really loved someone I could never share them… and I want love, I guess...” He said quietly nervously twirling the stemmed glass in his hand again.
“I hear you’ve been a customer of mine for awhile now.” Draco was curious to hear for himself what Potter thought of his potions and it did amuse him that the man had been drinking potions made by someone he hated.
Harry didn’t take much notice and just spoke casually as he finished setting the table. “We like to be comfy don’t we babe?” He said with a cheeky look at Draco.
“Of course Auror Potter, I quite understand and I assure you that we know how to respect people's privacy here. Pierre is very passionate about discretion.” Miss Greengrass smiled at him politely again and even though Harry often found it hard to trust strangers let alone Slytherins, there was something about her that he did find trustworthy somehow. He was usually a good judge of character.
He had to put that out of his mind for now though. He had another very difficult conversation to get through first. The last thing he ever wanted to do was hurt Fred. Over the last three years Fred had never really asked Harry when he was going to be staying over, Harry just turned up when he felt like and it just sort of happened. If Fred had plans then he would let Harry know but sometimes Harry turned up at the flat while Fred was out and just spent time with George it had never been a big deal. If Harry ever decided to spend more time at Grimmauld Fred had never questioned it but he hadn’t spent a night in Fred’s bed since the Tuesday he’d had his appointment with Pierre which was almost two weeks ago.
When he looked back up again, Draco had taken a step back, wand away and was looking very hungrily at Harry’s upper body. “Hmm that’s much better.” He said happily.
“It’s a shame that the prophecy smashed.” Draco said. “I heard all about it at home of course… that summer… well it wasn’t my best.”
“Yeah and if you want to join the ‘my father was a dick’ club then let me know. So far it’s just me and you but I could probably find us a few more members, especially from Slytherin.” Draco said with a snort and that earned a faint chuckle from Graham.
Harry still didn’t seem sure of that statement though and Draco found it strange. He had this house since the war but it still didn’t feel like home? And what did he mean about never really having his own space or a proper home, did he not still have his childhood home with the muggles, surely they were still his family?
I know it's been a while sorry, real life stuff just got in the way but this is a massive chapter to make up for it!
“Yes well that’s the platinum honeymoon package for you. Romance is the general idea.” Draco replied casually with a lazy flick of the wrist. “But I’ve cancelled it for the rest of your time here and I’ve put a note on the system to say that any cancellations you request are to be approved no questions asked even though they can’t be refunded. I’ll add ‘no roses’ to the note too for you. Shame to waste them.”
Harry made sure to speak of the heroics of Ginny, Neville and Luna that day as well as the others of course as well as how lucky they were to have the order arrive. He also made sure to note that it was Snape who alerted the order but as ever he didn’t name the specific Death Eater actions with one exception, he had to say exactly who killed Sirius.
Harry frowned at her. “Why not?! That’s not fair. I told you all about your potential future husband!”
“Does that mean you’d support me to be a sort of part time emergency auror?” Harry asked Draco seriously.
Breakfast was now Harry’s favourite meal of the day, which was very odd because up until two months ago he wasn’t always guaranteed to even have it. He never knew where or when he’d be having breakfast, what he’d have or whether he’d even be sitting down for it.
The beginning of boredom it seemed as Draco lay in bed staring up at the now familiar sight of his bedroom ceiling waiting until it was an acceptable time to get up. He was reflecting once again on that last encounter with Potter and how… strange it had been. He was beginning to wonder if it had been real, but then he had his wand back so it must have been. He could feel it now underneath his pillow. Had Potter had ever slept with it under his pillow, he asked himself.
“Of course I did! Blimey I’d be mad to say no! The salary is good you know, and I get my own office, it’s huge! It’s got it’s own little kitchen, well you’ve seen it, and I get a secretary, that’s going to be great for the paperwork! Plus an extra week of holiday, that will come in handy with Rose you know. Blimey Harry, me, Head Auror at 25! Can you believe it?!” He rushed out with a massive grin obviously feeling that now he knew Harry was ok with it he could be completely happy about it.
Harry looked at Draco and watched him take a sip of his wine. He recognised this as a stalling tactic and there was a tiny tremor in his hand even though his face looked completely calm.
Just another normal Monday with Draco brewing at home... until the band on his ankle heats up again!
George had only agreed to take him on a temporary basis thinking he would only really need him this week but then Fred and George decided it might be nice to another staff member on the books for when someone called in sick or when the Hogsmeade branch was busy to help Lee out. Fred, George and Lee all worked so much that they didn’t often get time off together so maybe this would be good. Even though they might have to train Graham more in basic customer service!
He thought he’d got better at that having to do so many speeches at charity events and press interviews but there was just something about Malfoy and this unfamiliar situation that was making him nervous.
“Fine. I won’t bring it up again. I just don’t think you’ll ever be able to live your life properly until something is done about Lucius.” Daphne said and then she walked straight through into the shop to open up before Draco had the chance to respond.
To be honest the rest of my chapters are looking pretty long too... let me know if that's a bad thing! Still would love to hear your thoughts!
I haven't written the next two chapters. I know exactly what happens in them but actually writing them might take me a while as I'm pretty busy right now. I'll get them done though and chapters 14 & 15 are already written so that will speed up the end of this fic for you! After that it will just be the epilogue but I've already started that too so you will get your finished story I promise!
Harry was quiet for a moment then he said “maybe you’ll see that Frodo wouldn’t have got very far without Sam… or any of the others.”
“Let me talk to him and then come over at half five. I’ll tell him you know and convince him to stay as Draco. He will definitely panic but he’ll never forgive me if he finds out I knew and I didn’t give him a heads up. He hates losing his cool in front of other people but I know how to handle him.”
“Hmm damn you with your plans and your sound logic.” Draco whined. Then he pulled his head back, eyes closed and kind of shook it a bit as if riding himself of his thoughts. He took a deep breath and then opened his eyes. “What time will you be back tonight?”
“What’s going on?” Harry said stepping forward in a commanding way. This was auror Harry in action and so far he seemed calm and in control.
“Er, yeah.” Harry said trying to get on track with the conversation now. “Yeah, it was a good chat with Kingsley to be honest. Basically they can call me in whenever they feel like it but I’m not actually obligated to say yes to anything. So if they want my help, they’ll ask and I'll decide based on the case and what’s going on in my life on that day I guess. Standard procedure is they will just floo call me to come in but in an absolute emergency they’ll use the band.” He said, giving his ankle a little shake.
Then Kreacher showed him some of the cupboards in the kitchen that had food in and what was available to snack on throughout the day. Then he took Draco next door beyond the kitchen to the pantry where there was even more food, mostly ingredients for things rather than ready-to go-stuff. Like a big sack of potatoes and another of onions. There were lots of meats hanging under preserving charms and cheeses on the shelves also sitting under charms. He got the impression that this was Kreacher’s domain and much more like he expected wizarding pantries to look like, there was nothing muggle here. Judging by the amount of food here though you’d think there were twenty of them for dinner every night.
All in all it was a very strange but still somewhat relaxing evening. His mother said she was tired and was going to have a bath and retire to bed early which was a bit of a relief. Draco gave her some lavender bath salts he’d made and then went to join Harry who had already gone into their bedroom. Just as he was leaving his mother’s room though she called him back.
Just as Draco suspected he would, Harry got slightly nervous again. “Erm, well yeah… you could say that. I know who their source was… I’m really sorry I didn’t mean to say anything but I just wanted to shut her up and it did work to be fair.”
“The french guy that makes all my potions? The one I recommended to you for your range of edible chocolates with potions in the middle?” Harry asked, not really understanding why Fred seemed awkward about it.
“Yes. It’s all quite new and experimental but there’s a private clinic in London that specialises in magical fertility and they opened a new department for men last year just in the research stages but I heard a rumour that they’ve made a breakthrough. It’s bound to be very exclusive and expensive from what I gather but there are spells and potions-”
Tuesday he embodied his business persona as Pierre so that helped keep Draco’s thoughts buried too. He had customer meetings pretty much all day so he was pleased to keep busy. The bespoke part of his business was really growing now as the more presents he made the more people knew about him and were impressed enough to book their own appointment so they could get a present for someone else. He was making lots of bespoke perfumes, they were the most popular by far. In the old wizard families it was custom to give each other a gift for all Hallows Eve which was coming up. Of course not everyone kept this tradition, it was mainly the older generation but Draco was still hoping to capitalise on this. Then of course it wouldn’t be long until Yule and Christmas.
Kreacher then started talking, Draco got the impression he found it hard to keep his thoughts to himself. “It is good to have a true Black in the house again, Kreacher is happy, Master Draco should stay.”
Draco frowned and then reached up to get hold of Harry’s hands and move them so they were wrapped back around him again which made Harry laugh. They sat like that for a while just holding each other. These were the moments that Harry loved, the moments he’d never really shared with Fred unless something was wrong and Fred knew he needed a cuddle. But here nothing was wrong, they were just enjoying the moment and these were the moments he wondered whether he would ever have. Yet here he was with someone to cuddle, someone to cherish, someone to sit in comfortable silence with and just enjoy being with each other.
George started quietly clearing up whilst Harry and Fred sat at the kitchen table wordlessly for a little while. It definitely seemed like the cheerful atmosphere in the flat had been subdued quite quickly. Harry typically had only eaten half his plate but George worked slitenly in the background boxing up all the leftovers and putting stasis charms on them.
Harry didn’t bother seeing him out, he knew his way and the others were down there but he watched him leave through the door. When the door closed he turned back to face Draco but immediately he found a familiar pair of soft lips on his. Harry kissed him back of course, he’d never reject him but he didn’t feel particularly comfortable doing so with this audience.
Harry took a step back, this game was exhausting and he didn’t like it. “Yes, that would have been preferable. Miss Nancy does usually give us the heads up if she thinks something might upset Teddy, he is a very emotional child.”
“He didn’t want to but I just didn’t leave him much choice!” Harry said, finishing his drink and setting the mug on the coffee table in front of them.
Harry could tell that Draco wasn’t the sort of man to make promises easily. He was a Slytherin yes, well practised at telling half-truths and finding loopholes but he was still a man of his word when it counted and wouldn’t go back on a simple promise.
Ten minutes later just as was looking over the diary and the notes for the day there was a tapping sound at the window. He looked up and smiled as he went to open it.
Harry scoffed. “Yes you have a point.” Then he took a deep breath and turned to face Draco again. “Are you saying… What are you saying?”
Of course Harry would be happy to help too and had some spare cash lying around but he wasn’t going to get involved in this unless Draco asked him. If he knew Draco then the man was already planning on paying for Sarah’s full tuition at the Paris university and would probably even write to his old tutor about her too.
He kept thinking over the events of Sunday again and again wondering what would have happened if he’d just waited until Draco called him like a normal person or stayed in Draco’s office like he’d been asked. He was such an idiot sometimes, he just hoped that he hadn’t ruined it for good. After he’d seen the shop was closed yesterday he so desperately wanted to contact Draco but he was worried that Draco was still angry at him and that he wouldn’t respond well to being contacted so soon. Harry couldn’t just do nothing though so he wrote two copies of the same letter and sent one to Daphne and one to Blaise using the spare owls at Fred and George’s.
Draco found his mother's blue eyes turning soft as she gazed upon him with… admiration. “You broke the cycle.” She said simply. “I saw it the day you moved out. You stood up to your father, to the system, you had a glimpse of what your life would be like and decided it wouldn’t make you happy so you left to make your own life and I… I admire you greatly for that and that’s why I helped you that day.”
“Technically she’s my half sister.” Graham continued as no one had stopped him. “Her mother was a muggle but she never knew her. I think Sarah, that’s my sister, struggles with the loss of her mother more than I do with mine. She really likes muggle studies and wants to connect with that part of her I suppose, having not actually grown up around muggles at all.”
Leo had brought them here about an hour ago after the trial. Turned out he was the auror assigned to Malfoy Manor for the near future. Draco found himself pleased at that turn of events, he actually liked Leo and it would be nice to have a friendly face around. Upon arrival Draco had immediately started questioning his mother about the missing details from the trials he needed to know but she had firmly said that she had to “get her affairs in order” first and that they would “converse later over tea”.
Harry waits to call Draco after their 'not-a-date' date with Blaise and then tries to do something nice for him on the spur of the moment but it doesn't go according to plan.
They said there quietly for a couple of minutes as Fred snuggled into Harry and Harry held him tight, scared to let him go. After a while Harry spoke again.
“Alright Mr ‘I-have-a-fancy-house-but-I-never-use-it’! Even though I hate missing your workout, I like it when you do it here!” Fred teased back.
Again I know it's quite Harry/Draco centric at the moment and there is a lot of talking (which is why I put a tiny bit of action in here for you) but that's important to progress the plot at that point.  I'll write a couple of fluffy scenes and being in the side characters soon!
He wasn’t really putting on a different voice for Pierre as he wasn’t sure he could maintain it but it was definitely a brighter warmer tone than Draco’s. His own body language was usually quite stiff too but he was making himself relax and have more fluid movements. He wanted to strike the right balance between friendly and professional and give the air of confidence but not arrogance in his work. He felt Potter’s presence come in and heard the door click shut. The first thing that struck him was the smell of the man. Draco had always had a keen sense of smell but this was definitely recognisable as one of his own aftershaves and he remembered the order. The sandalwood scent was so manly but relaxing and the fact that Potter was wearing an aftershave that he made, let alone one of his favourites made Draco’s stomach do a weird floppy thing. He wanted to look up but forced himself to focus on his work still.
“Me neither.” Draco said, holding Harry’s waist as Harry slipped his arms up over Draco’s shoulder and round the back of his neck. “I can’t wait to go to bed with you tonight Harry.” Draco said seductively.
Blaise raised his drink into the air. “Well here’s to the new Mr and Mr Black, may you two be very happy together.” He said very loudly as the waitress flushed and hurried away.
I also know that he relaxes quite quickly around Harry and maybe that is a surprise but hopefully I explained it when I talked about him not wanting to have a mask on for anyone now. I also think it helps that they both look so different now they keep almost forgetting how they know each other and are essentially just starting over.
“I believe he can be yes.” Harry said not wanting to betray Draco’s trust but wanting to potentially encourage any possible communication between Dromeda and Draco in the future. There was hope there if Dromeda wanted to meet him once then he expected she would still.
Harry did a kind of ‘half’ gesture. “Wandless magic still makes it hurt but I can grip my wand no problem-”
Harry had forgotten they were even holding hands, it just seemed so natural but thinking about it he supposed it wasn’t. After all, he didn’t hold hands with any of his other male friends… He couldn’t think about that now though, it was too confusing. If Draco wanted to hold his hand then he could. Frankly if Draco wanted to do anything now Harry would probably let him after everything he’d just revealed to him.
No one else had said a word yet, everyone was still processing the information but Draco was most of all.
Draco nodded slowly. “Yes I do see that and you’ve been very kind to your friends in the way you’ve written it. It does come across like there is more than one hero to the story but you are still one of the heroes no matter what you say. It wasn’t just blind luck that Fawkes was there, your actions and your words called him to you. You still saved Ginevra’s life.”
“I’m sure first names all round would be fine with everyone here.” She said as a statement rather than a question but Blaise nodded anyway and stepped forward to come and meet Harry.
Harry had tempted him out to drinks with a chance to find out about his secrets and laugh at his miserable life but Draco hadn’t once tried to do that. No left at the altar jokes, no nosy questions, no insensitive comments… Draco had simply entertained Harry with stories of his own adventures and for one night Harry had almost lived vicariously through him.
Then Draco finally looked up into Harry’s eyes and he knew there and then that he’d made the right decision to give the chapters to Draco even if he still didn’t know why.
“No problem, it’s quite exciting to be part of an adventure again!” Fred said jokingly. “I’ll round up some products that might come in useful Draco and I’ll drop them by first thing tomorrow just before you open up? Or maybe George will so he has an excuse to see Daphne!”
“I think I could have told her anything at that point to be honest, she was just so relieved to see me alive.” Draco said happily. “I just came out and said it and she just hugged me and said that she didn’t care. She was just glad I was alive, that she loved me and that things were going to be different for us now.”
“Oh.” Harry said simply. “I’m sorry, maybe I shouldn’t have come. It was selfish of me I’m sorry, Fred- he- well… I shouldn’t tell him about this…” He said sadly, hanging his head.
Narcissa swallowed her emotions but held her son’s hand back regardless. “I’m sorry I didn’t do it sooner but we both have a future now.”
“You don’t need to understand my decision, Mother, you just need to accept it. I have thought about this a lot and I’m not going to change my mind. I need to make my own decisions and form my own life away from here. I still think there is hope for us to have a relationship in the future Mother. I cannot risk Father knowing where I live but if you want to write to me then your owl will find me. She is clever, just be sure to tell her it’s for Draco. I will accept your letters and write back as long as you let me do this and don’t try to interfere in my life anymore. I cannot reconcile with father.” Draco should feel himself getting worked up and was willing his voice to stay calm as he continued.
“I know.” Harry said back gently. “He’ll never try to control you ever again and you don’t have to hide anymore, not if you don’t want to. Your mother is right, you know, you can have any future you want.”
“This water fountain is nice, was it always here?” It seemed to work, as she turned her head back towards him and smiled.
“I am rather pleased that you have the opportunity to gain your qualifications, Draco, and I am fully expecting you to achieve the grades befitting a Malfoy heir. You are clever and if you apply yourself you should do very well.”
“Well I’ll have to be.” Draco said simply. “I’m not going to be the one to tell you he can’t be in our lives, that wouldn’t be fair to anyone. I know how important the Weasleys are to you plus he’s ingrained in my life now too. His twin is dating one of my best friends and I have a contract with him now to formulate the potions for their new product range… It would be too messy for too many people and I genuinely do like the guy…  But I need some… clarifications.”
After dinner Harry summoned his notes from upstairs and they sat in the lounge together to go over them. Draco had already read the first few chapters which went over first year but he had said he wanted to interject his side of things a few times which he would write himself and give to Harry at some point.
“Thanks.” Draco mumbled at him too and then the three of them were gone and it was just him and Harry standing there.
“Well, he had a range of emotions…” Daphne had her little mischievous smile back. “But it will all be fine Harry don’t worry. This way.”
Fred was scowling but it was more of a pretend scowl, Harry knew he wasn’t seriously annoyed. “Well I’m well and truly awake now, I may as well get up!”
“You dress yourself up as a beautiful, elegant silver snake who is charming and witty with a dry sense of humour and the ability to command any room. You are that person too but underneath you’re also a regal, brave little lion who is quiet and shy but can also be fierce and protective if needed.” Harry said fondly.
“You thought what?!” Draco spat out angrily. “You thought you’d just ignore my clear directions for you to wait in the office. You thought you’d just push your way up here into my private living area. You always think the rules don’t apply to you don’t you Potter. You always were a nosy git poking around where you don’t belong. Maybe you haven’t changed after all.”
“Well Friday is market day in town over on the main island.” Draco said happily. “I usually go if I happen to have the day off. If not sometimes Mattie gets some stuff for me and drops it round. Shopping is always fun and we could do with some more food anyway. Some of the locals have little stalls selling things they’ve made. JP’s sister has one with jewellery, I’ve got some of her bracelets and necklaces actually.”
