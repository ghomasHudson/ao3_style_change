, Draco,” Harry moaned. “Oh, god—you’re s-such a tease.”
“But—”
“What do you mean?” Malfoy replied, frowning faintly.
“Good,” Ron said, crossing his arms stubbornly. “And tell him he has to be nicer to us otherwise you’ll break up with him.”
If anyone had been watching closely they would have noticed the blond’s hands begin to tremble. Taking a deep breath, Draco turned around to face the dark haired man who used to make him happy every day. The pain in the dark green eyes slightly shocked Draco and his hands fisted at his sides.
“Really?” Potter asked hopefully.
He neatened his facial hair, somewhat tamed his wildly curling mop, and slapped on some cologne. Checking his watch, his heart thumped as he realised that Malfoy would be arriving in twenty minutes. He left the bedroom, ducked into the kitchen to make sure the table was set properly and the food was ready, and then quickly did a final sweep of the lounge room.
desire him… but how much of that was the vampiric compulsion? It was no secret that vampires were skilled at luring their prey whenever they so wished. Had Malfoy been compelling Harry all this time?
Draco could hear the unspoken reason colouring each word his mother voiced. He bit back his retort and instead tightened his hold.
hatred rose within Draco and he turned a ferocious look to the boorish red-head. It took every ounce of his self-control not to bare his fangs in a snarl.
use that tactic, the sly little bint.
He nodded in reply. “Yes, sir,” he replied, keeping his tone even and casual. “Fortunately there have been no serious problems.”
There was sudden gentle knock on his door, a voice quickly following. “Draco? May I come in?”
Harry frowned, taking a step closer. “But I want… I need to talk to you.”
real and Merlin knew Draco wasn’t going to muck around relishing in memories. He gripped Potter’s length firmly, groaning under his breath at how wonderful it felt.
“That’s why you didn’t follow me outside,” he breathed, staring at the male in horror. “And why… why you quit quidditch.”
,” he hissed.
” The blond sneered at the empty space beside him.
“Maybe I’ll get some,” Pansy pondered, tapping a finger against her lips. “Um, how do you get it?”
“What?” he grumbled, allowing his fork to fall to his plate.
Now he was here, his gaze on the deteriorating front gates, and an icy breeze cutting through his warming charm. He fought back a shiver, unsure as to whether he could blame it on the cold or the brief spike of fear that sparked within him as he passed through onto the Hogwarts grounds.
“Will you stay?” Harry whimpered.
“Oh I don’t know, Mione,” Harry winked. “Parkinson and I have already planned our wedding theme.”
“I’m nob going to—”
“Have you been conniving with Slytherins again, Mione?” the brunet asked.
The brunet stared at his best friend. “…why are you telling me all of this?” he asked softly.
“Aside from gaining unquestionable strength, stability, and possible happiness? Hmm, why indeed.”
“M-Malfoy?” he managed with a faint gasp. He bit back the moan that threatened as Malfoy’s hands moved voluptuously over his figure, one hand drifting downwards while the other slid up his Quidditch robes, fingers delicately tracing over the skin on Harry’s throat.
“We’re not?” Pansy pouted.
Dashing up the stairs, Harry left Hermione alone to gaze through the many pictures he had. She was amazed at the quality of some of them; she had never known Harry was talented in the art department. The book reminded her of an art diary as she flipped through the parchment pages. She was wondering where he had gotten it when her gaze landed on a particularly gorgeous sketch of a dog.
Draco thought as Pansy began rattling off all the presents she had been given for Christmas.
“Relax, Potter,” Draco smirked, taking a sip of his drink, “and enjoy being an adult.” The pleasant taste on his tongue was a welcome surprise and he swallowed greedily, recognising the familiar strong essence of elderflower wine.
Hermione seemed to calm at this news. “Alright,” she said with a grin.
Potter snorted. “As if you’d want to hide in my shadow,” he said bluntly.
“What?”
Harry rolled his eyes but smiled all the same. “Now I know how Mrs Weasley feels.”
blocking the way; we should be used to not being asked nicely.”
job of it, Malfoy.”
Hermione’s questions bombarded him as soon as Ron re-entered the Gryffindor common room.
“Don’t worry, everyone knows I suck at Potions as well,” Harry chuckled.
Blaise shook his head disdainfully, returning his gaze to his textbook. “I don’t know why you’re concerning yourself with this.”
Potter chuckled softly, twirling in a slow circle. “I will, of course, be telling Hermione and Ron.”
Dinner was, surprisingly, a really nice affair. Malfoy even complimented Harry on his culinary skills. They had kept the conversation relatively tame, sticking to topics they both shared a mutual interest in, with the occasional jest or jab at the others expense. Just for old times.
With a curse, Harry placed the mirror aside, dejection creeping up his spine as he leant heavily on the table.
“If Madam Pomfrey decides to move you to the Hospital Wing, Harry, I really think you should go,” Hermione said as she rearranged his duvet.
“Wasn’t much of a challenge,” the brunet smirked in reply, following his best friend from the locker room. “Didn’t seem like Malfoy had his head in the game.”
Harry mused, lips beginning to tingle from
Pansy glared at the two of them. “You’ve been hanging with Draco for two weeks and he’s already rubbed off on you.”
Watching Potter as he stomped away, the smile on Draco’s face had grown once more, the corners of his lips curling and eyes filled with a determined glimmer. He had found that embracing the compulsion he felt whenever he was close to Potter, instead of fighting it, the desire to bite the Gryffindor was much easier to control.
He blinked slowly, brow crinkling as a confused frown appeared on his face.
“Hello, Pansy,” Draco replied distractedly, eyes on his laptop screen as he sat cross-legged in the middle of his bed.
“Your decision to take your father’s place was admirable, Draco,” he murmured. “I promise to do my best to make your stay here as comfortable as I can.”
Draco chuckled darkly. “Stop it, Potter, you’re allowing this idea to be far too tempting.”
Draco had grown up hearing the stories about The-Boy-Who-Lived… but he had never imagined that what had happened at Hogwarts had involved
“I figured,” Draco mumbled unhappily.
Harry felt his cheeks begin to burn. “I’m game if
“Just… just go.” Draco winced, closing his eyes. “I can’t—” He swallowed back a moan. “
Sitting across from him, Malfoy was arching his back off the back of the booth, stretching as he released a disgustingly attractive sigh.
He looked miserable.
Pansy threw a sneer over her shoulder. “To go to talk to Granger.”
to do,” Harry pouted.
Potter pursed his lips. “Hmm, can I name more than one?”
No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to stop the way his body was responding to the scent of Potter. He was currently surrounded by his entire class. This fact alone should have been enough to stem the desires now growing with the blond. Instead, Draco was so
… Harry thought, dropping his wand onto the bedside table. He still had time to sleep before his next class.
,” the brunette grumbled, tossing her pen onto the counter and marching to the window.
Among other things.
Draco looked down at the remnants of his meal. “Um—would you like some help cleaning up?” he asked, feeling awkward as he looked at Hermione.
He retrieved his laptop from his bag and opened it, Hermione and Ron doing the same beside him. In fact, most of the class were opening their laptops and soon the classroom was filled with the
“You’d be as soft as a Hufflepuff.”
“You look exhausted, maybe you shouldn’t go to class today,” Pansy suggested, concern for her friend evident in her eyes.
“Because I wanted something different and I felt like a little teenage rebellion. Because both of my parents are so stuck in their ways that even the tiniest change worries them like nothing else,” Draco replied solemnly. “Pans, you know my parents, you know how they live—I was sick of doing the same.”
Harry was happy to answer the less intrusive questions Eli flung his way as it kept the young man amused and the situation less awkward. Time was ticking by slowly, but at least it was ticking by. Harry had ordered and downed two more firewhiskeys in the time Eli slowly sipped his to completion, declining another when Harry offered.
“Sure, give me a minute,” Draco said as he began to type out a reply to Potter.
“I know you do but it’ll be easier for Madam Pomfrey to look after you,” Hermione replied patiently. “Ron and I will stay with you as much as we can.”
“Haven’t had much practice?”
,” Malfoy said haughtily.
The blond growled in frustration at his own idiocy.
A blush flared in Draco’s cheeks. “Nothing.”
Ron snorted, his flames sparking in amusement. “Nah, can’t say we do.” He hopped back down to where Draco was sitting, tilting his waxed face up to the blond. “So what’s your name?”
Even as the thought settled in Harry’s head, the reminder that Malfoy was still stroking his hip sent another wave of annoyance coursing through him. Perhaps now was not the time to test that theory. Harry was obviously still upset about something—it might not even have anything to do with Draco! Maybe he was just tired; stressed from school. It was probably best that Harry head back to his own dormitory.
Draco thought in mild amusement, eyes sliding over to where Harry sat. He felt a gentle wave of warmth breeze over him at the sight of his mate and he found a smile curling at his lips before he could stop it. He forced his gaze away, not wanting any others to question why he staring affectionately at the Golden Boy of all people.
“Do you do this with all of your guests?” Potter asked timidly.
“Shove off,
me, Harry,” Malfoy hissed gleefully. “Begged me to finish you…”
“Potter.”
“That you like her.”
“Friends wanted to find me someone for Valentine’s Day. They picked
Harry’s heart was beating incredibly fast. He’d never admitted anything about his relatives to anyone—let alone Draco Malfoy. Neither Ron nor Hermione were knowledgeable to the depths of his personal life and he preferred it that way.
“You’re staring at me.”
He glanced at his watch. Still half an hour before his next class.
Feeling somewhat drained, Draco exhaled. “Alright.”
“Don’t make me repeat myself, Potter,” Pansy sighed. “Because I want to get to
you.”
“So wait, you can still eat?”
A cheeky smirk tugged at Harry’s lips. “Hmm, I would have taken you to be more of an oriental lily kind of man.”
“That’s one hell of a punishment,” Harry breathed, gazing at Malfoy incredulously.
“But I could have killed him,” Draco said, distraught.
Malfoy’s smile was like nothing else, so carefree and natural when he wasn’t on guard with his emotions—Harry wondered what the blond would look like whilst being pleasured.
Harry grinned. “Because I think Mione might like you in return.”
“Merlin have mercy on Potter if you really
Potter gaped at the blond before him, outrage on his face. “Well
“Comfortable? Because if it’s not I might just have to trade with someone else.” Harry mused with a smile.
Malfoy sat at another tree with Pansy, Theo and Blaise relaxing around him. One of them had obviously said something funny as a genuine smile had brightened the blond’s face, his eyes alight with pleasure.
“I’ve grown up since then,” Draco replied. “I haven’t thrown a tantrum since fifth year. Your argument is invalid.”
“Skin cancer?” he questioned.
With a groan Draco tossed back the duvet and swung his long legs over the edge of the mattress. The soft silk of his navy pyjamas brushed soothingly across his skin as he headed for the bathroom, the coolness of the tiles a welcome distraction as he took himself through his standard morning routine. He found that he was relying on the practiced movements to get him relieved and cleansed, especially since his mind insisted on being elsewhere. Before he knew it Draco was stepping out of the shower, freshly washed, and towel wrapped loosely around his hips.
Harry opened a new tab and typed in the URL. The familiar blog popped into view and Harry went to his ask box.
As Harry followed the red-head, his gaze was drawn once more to the Slytherin who was crossing the dungeon to his usual seat with Parkinson. Malfoy sat down gracefully beside her, removed his textbook, parchment, and ink, before leaning back in his chair, his arms folded in a casual manner.
The brunet spluttered. “Hermione!”
Hermione’s worried voice greeted Harry as she and Ron stepped into the boys’ dormitory. Harry, who was sitting on the edge of his bed, forced his gaze up from his steadfast glare on the carpet, staring at his friends with a sudden surge of trepidation.
“What I did was stupid and as much as I desire for things to be different—”
“Scented oil,” Draco said, answering the brunet’s silent question. “You’ll know why soon he enough,” he finished with a smile.
Pansy rolled her eyes. “Guess this means you and Potter will have some quality time together,” she winked. “Just remember to practise safe sex, Draco, alright?”
“So!” Percy announced, “where shall we begin?”
,” Peaches hissed back, tongue flickering. “
“Keep your voice down, Draco,” Pansy interrupted with a smirk. “You wouldn’t want anyone finding out now, would you?”
… and with one brief inhalation, Potter’s scent had broken through every wall Draco had constructed and brought the snarling beast screaming to the surface.
“Invisibility cloak and password,” Harry said.
Draco did not look any less pleased at this announcement but he forced himself to relax all the same. Hermione felt concern well up within her. Malfoy looked like he was ready to snap at any given moment; an elastic band pulled to its limits. If they didn’t do something soon, there was a very good chance the vampire could lose himself completely.
Harry sniggered. “Yeah go ahead.”
“Argh!”
“Was this not where you wanted the evening to head, Potter?”
“I’m not sleeping with Pansy, though; it’s totally different.”
The blond pulled away just long enough to gaze at Harry, his silver eyes shining with profound lust.
“Mmm, yes,” Hermione replied absently, frowning at her goblet. She wondered what it was that had spurred Malfoy to ignore his determination to stay away from Harry. After all, the light-haired Slytherin had been extremely adamant that the idea of Harry being his mate repulsed him.
Draco’s eyes glinted audaciously. “Charlie to be precise.”
“No—wait please!” Harry begged, crossing the floor. “Draco, don’t.”
Potter nodded thoughtfully, relaxing back against the couch as the tension eased out of his shoulders. “I guess not all pretty people are nice,” he half smiled, glancing at Draco.
Hermione’s eyes were unnervingly kind as they gazed over him. “You seem rather distracted; why don’t we leave it for today?”
As Draco’s lips descended on Potter’s, his right knee worked its way in between the Gryffindor’s legs, pinning Potter completely to the wall. Whatever Potter had been about to say died on his lips as Draco consumed him, leaving no room to complain.
“What the hell!” Ron immediately growled in defence. “Harry hasn’t done anything to you!”
Draco was miserable.
“Shall we go check out our new toys?” Harry grinned, noticing a few of their classmates had already started.
“Pansy, your mind is filthy.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes, his heart rate calming at the cheeky smile currently plastered to the dark-haired male’s face. “I think I preferred it when you were avoiding me, Potter.”
“Wha?”
“And you’re
Malfoy’s mouth inched further down Harry’s cock, cheeks hollowing as he sucked. The brunet imagined Malfoy groaning deeply in his throat and Harry wished he could reach down to entangle his fingers in, what he imagined, Malfoy’s silky hair.
“So since neither of us really know where to go from here, we should probably do some research,” Ron announced, tapping a finger against his lips thoughtfully. His freckled face brightened slightly. “I know we’re angry with Hermione right now but I think it would be best to talk to her about some stuff. Knowing her, she’s probably got a bunch of encyclopedias on vampires. Plus, she should be able to tell you more details about Malfoy.”
The Gryffindor’s cheeks went red and he said nothing. Malfoy smirked.
Harry immediately cottoned on, the brunet cocking his head to the side and a faint frown appearing on his face. “You knew?”
Hermione thought.
Harry thought humourlessly.
“Oh my god.”
Had he heard Malfoy correctly? Did the Slytherin
The blond suddenly sighed. “It’s alright, Harry, I understand,” Malfoy said, cutting Harry off. “I know what you’re going to say and it’s… it’s alright. I had imagined something like this was going to happen and I can’t say I blame you.”
“You’re both arseholes,” Harry panted.
Draco almost dropped the coffee into the guy’s lap.
Harry was glaring down at his assessment when someone slid into the chair beside him. Assuming it was either Ron or Hermione, the brunet looked up with a smile. The expression fell from his face as his eyes landed on the familiar smirk of his least favourite Slytherin.
“That’s becoming exceedingly obvious,” Draco chided, but the gentle smile on his face soothed the mock reprimand in his voice. “I’m sorry, I did not mean for my silence to be an answer. Your offer simply surprised me.”
“No rhythm to speak of.”
Draco thought possessively, his cock throbbing excitably in his hand.
“Join us, Draco, please?”
“How long were you drawing me?” Hermione asked, narrowing her eyes.
“But you
that Draco Malfoy used a laptop let alone have a Tumblr account?
“I’m going to make you eat those words, Potter.”
Hermione twirled a section of her hair around her finger as she eyed the blond in front of her. “I thought it would be fitting considering it was
“Think of it this way, Ron,” Hermione said. “Should Malfoy do
“He is no longer your concern,” Potter snarled down at the elder Malfoy.
Harry shook his head. “Nah, nothing like that.” He tossed his robes into his bag and grabbed a t-shirt.
“More like snogging him…” Harry commented.
“Don’t worry, handsome, Draco here makes a beautiful cappuccino, you won’t feel as if you’re missing out.”
“I’m not sulking,” Harry moped, turning away from the red-head.
Suddenly, Harry felt Malfoy fumbling for his wrists and in a blink of an eye, Malfoy had gripped them tightly in each hand and pinned them above Harry’s head. His eyes flashed, a smirk tugging at his lips.
Harry’s eyes shot back to Malfoy’s face. “Really? That long?”
“It’s meant to,” Pansy replied, stirring the potion counter-clockwise thrice as instructed.
“By no longer hating one another?” Malfoy chuckled darkly. “I am looking forward to their reactions.”
Harry’s fingers where already typing a reply before he even realised what he was doing.
“Just bear with me,” his friend added hastily.
“I’m going to make you eat those words, Harry,” Draco positively growled, closing the space between them.
Harry smiled. “She really does tell you everything, doesn’t she?”
“First you must gain self-confidence by striking out on your own.” George told Harry, acting like a swim instructor.
Harry and Draco took turns attempting to rid the other of sand, wanting to leave as much of it on the beach as possible. As Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s unruly hair, he couldn’t help but laugh. Harry’s hair was always a mess and hard to style but the sand managed to magnify those traits exponentially. Harry made a face as sand almost fell into his eyes, his hair had fought back and knotted around Draco’s fingers, making sand fly everywhere as Draco gently freed himself. Draco apologized in between giggle fits as he helped get Harry’s face clean of sand. Harry glared at Draco once his face was clean enough to open his eyes, but the glare quickly became a smile. Draco’s eyes were silver in their delight, making them the most beautiful color in the world to Harry. Draco stared lovingly into Harry’s emerald eyes, enjoying the way that the barely present sun made them sparkle. Unable to stop himself, Draco closed his eyes and guided Harry’s lips to his and kissed the dark-haired man gently. Harry returned the kiss happily and just as softly, not wanting to ruin the tender moment they were sharing.
Draco turned to bury his face into Harry’s arms, done checking out their room now and seeking the comfort of his lover’s arms. Harry pulled Draco in closer and they spent a while just soaking in the love they had for each other. Eventually, though, Draco started to stir, wanting to have Harry in the ocean before dusk.
Ron finally got some energy back after his cork injury at the sound. “The kittens!” He cried, stealing himself to run and try to save them. He jumped off the back of the piano, running as fast as his little legs could carry him.
But a cute cat I happen to meet,
“Narcissa, my dear.” Luna greeted her friend and client with a warm and inviting smile as she entered the room.
“Because of Madame. I could never leave her.”
“Why should you be first?” Albus asked Scorpius, clearly annoyed.
“Oh, Ron, I’ve been so worried about you. Did you have any luck at all?” Hermione asked the mouse, worry colouring her voice.
“Very nice.” His twin agreed.
“But with a muggle in the act, you can set music back…” Harry sang the first bit of the next verse…
“Over there, they’re in the trunk!” Harry pointed as he worked his back legs into the space between his torso and the pitchfork.
Gritting his teeth, Lucius tried again, lowering the hook towards his hat, hoping that this time he would be able to retrieve it without a problem. His arms shook a little due to his nerves, but Lucius managed to keep the line steady as the hook caught on the hat. However, Sirius’s eyes were still open. Sirius watched with wide eyes as his hat started to move of its own accord, and he slammed it back down with both paws. Lucius pulled the line away from the hat and watched with bated breath to see what Sirius would do next. He looked side to side, trying to figure out what was going on, but seeing no sign of an intruder, Sirius shrugged and draped both of his front legs over his hat to keep it in place.
“I’ll bet we walked a hundred miles,” Albus grumbled.
“Yeah. All those little kittens, Draco,” Harry agreed as he jumped up next to the white cat. “I love them,” he admitted as he scooted so that they were touching.
“Schwingers? What is a schwinger?” a confused Draco asked, not even realizing his mispronunciation.
Harry reached the door, and pushed Draco up against it, taking over his mouth with a deep and passionate kiss as he fumbled to unlock the door. Draco moaned into the kiss and deepened it immediately pushing his body up against Harry’s. As the door unlocked, Draco stumbled inside, not falling because Harry had pulled him in closer. They continued making out as Harry shut the door and waved his wand to clear off his desk. Within minutes, lube had been applied and both men were naked.
After a nice long rest upon a comfortable bed, all of the kittens were ready for the trip back home. Draco was less worried, and woke up feeling refreshed even as his heart was breaking at the thought of never seeing Harry again. Harry greeted everyone happily, masking his pain as best he could, trying to focus only on the joy Draco and his kids would get from being back home. Their happiness meant everything to him so he would ensure that they arrived safe and sound. After a quick breakfast, the small clowder set off for the fancy district of Paris, where Madame lived in her mansion. The walk from Harry’s pad to their mansion was not near as long as their walk from the day before and as they rounded a corner, the kittens ran ahead, knowing home was close by. Harry paused to take it all in, amazed at the houses and just the general cleanliness of the area around him.
“If you want…I wouldn’t mind making this a regular occurrence…” Draco said with a wink as they left the room hand and hand, ready to get home.
“Happy dreams, my loves,” Draco whispered to his kittens as they fell fast asleep. He watched them as he walked over to the window to chat with Harry, who came down from the ceiling window to meet the handsome white cat.
Solemnly up to mischief,
“Come on. Let’s all start meowing.” Scorpius suggested. All three of the kittens started to meow loudly at the locked cat door, hoping that Madame would find them soon and open the door.
“Tattletale.” James whispered with a glare as he set his elbow on a key.
Narcissa’s voice called to him from upstairs. “Lucius? Lucius, come quickly.”
Draco shot Harry a look of frustration at his tone but the geese didn’t seem to mind at all. Instead they broke into giggles once more and yelled “Oh! Oh, flatterer!”
“Fair enough, you are forgiven,” Draco grumbled jokingly, snuggling up next to Harry as he spoke.
"I can scoot over and make room for you here, I don't mind. We can relax together and see how that feels."
“And, you dear, you take this place.” George continued excitedly as he gently shooed Albus to the spot behind his father. “Now that leaves Mr. Potter…” George said with a chuckle.
"Go to hell, Malfoy."
“It can’t be them.” He said, outraged.
Harry eased himself into Draco, giving the man a minute to adjust, before starting to thrust into his lover with abandon. Both men cried out in pleasure at the new sensation, Harry loved how tight and hot Draco was for him, and Draco immensely enjoyed being stretched by Harry. Their lips crashed together in a sloppy but passionate kiss, their mouths struggling to match the perfect synchronization of their lower halves. Draco stopped trying to kiss Harry’s mouth and settled for sucking happily at his neck instead. Once he had created a rather nice sized mark, Draco kissed the spot gently, continuing to trail kisses and love bites over Harry’s neck and throat. Harry moaned at the attention, worried that being marked would make him come early, but he managed to keep himself on the edge by slowing their speed a little. Harry wasn’t ready to stop having Draco yet, he needed so much more, then again, he always needed more of Draco.
Lucius has another run-in with Sirius and Remus, as he goes back for his belongings. Potter and Co crash at Potter's pad for the night and meet Pans Cat and her gang of alley cats! Music ensues and it's super fun!
“Oh, Harry, Harry that would be wonderful. Darling, if only I could.” Draco sighed sadly.
"Fine but I refuse to leave this room. I needed a break and this was the first place that came to mind so I am not leaving. Why don't you just stay on your side of the room and I will stay on my side. Deal?"
“Tellin’ my friends, not the social elite,
Meanwhile, as Draco was defending his honor, Lucius was putting his deviant scheme into action. “Rock-a-bye kitties, bye-bye you go. La la la la, and I’m in the dough!” Lucius sang to himself as he added an entire bottle of sleeping tablets into the cats’ milk. “Oh Lucius, you sly old fox!” He continued humming to himself as he put in the final ingredients. Though his plan was nearly ruined when he tried to taste test the mixture.
“A walking tour of France.” Fred added.
Harry Potter the alley cat.”
“Ooo. That feels good, Remus,” Sirius said as he stretched again.
“All right, step lively. All aboard for Paris.” Harry said with a paw flourish towards the truck.
“So I got a few to spare. Nothin’.” Harry replied nonchalantly.
“Will, eh? Will will…” Luna repeats to herself as she swaps out her Spectrespecs for a pair of still odd looking, but far more sensible reading glasses. Luna pulls out a quill and a piece of parchment so that she is ready to take notes.
Rosmerta turned away to restart her truck, turning the crank angrily. Draco watched from the tall grass, a look of concern on his face. He couldn’t believe what Harry had just done! But the human seemed to have calmed down a little bit, and all three of his children had also stepped out from their hiding spot. Harry Potter strutted behind the other side of the truck, talking to Draco and his kittens, like everything was perfectly normal, and he hadn’t just come close to dying.
“This must be the trunk, eh?” The driver asked.
In the outskirts of Paris walked Draco and his brood, following Harry into the city. The kittens were exhausted, and little Scorpius was sat atop Harry’s back. They were walking on a rooftop, treading carefully while Draco thought over Harry’s idea of stopping for the night.
“You’re tickling!” Scorpius protested as he laughed against his will. Scorpius managed to get out from under James and took off back the way they had come, right under the ottoman that Albus had been hiding under. Albus backed away and then turned to run from Scorpius since he had been rooting against that sibling. Albus jumped onto the table so that he could be out of the way, hopping up onto a candlestick for a better view.
She fell back out of his grasp for a minute before grabbing hold of the back of his suspenders. Not really her best idea but she had been a little desperate to save herself. As she righted her spectacles, she chuckled at the idea of snapping Lucius’s suspenders against his back, the rude man deserved that and so much more. To her delight, Luna kept falling back a little, only keeping upright due to the elasticity of said fabric. Giving herself extra time to pull the fabric, Luna cackled loudly as she finally managed to regain her balance.
Harry chimed in with the next verse,
“Oh, how nice. We’re going to Paris ourselves.” George remarked.
Draco and Harry danced together to the beat, their front paws touching while they stood on their hind legs. They were essentially helping to hold each other up while they danced for a bit, until they landed in time with the music on all fours and shook their front paws from side to side in front of them, following their tails.
“You really did quite well for a beginner.” George said comfortingly.
“You know something? I like Uncle Hagrid.” Harry said with a wide grin.
“Indeed it was. Glad I could be here for it. Sorry I was so needy earlier…I won’t text you a dick pic while you are at work again, I promise.” Draco replied, attempting to keep a straight and somber face.
Ron put on his hat and coat and ran out the cat door as fast as his little mouse legs could go. “Draco! Kittens?” he called as thunder continued to clap and the rain poured down steadily. Ron pulled the flaps of his hat down and tied them in place before summoning his courage and running down the steps. Ron kept calling out for his friends for as long as he could stand but when he nearly got washed down a storm drain he had to turn in for the night, planning to go searching again as soon as morning came.
Harry gasped, trying to get more water out of his lungs. “Help? I’ve had all the help I can take.” Harry grumbled.
“That is exactly how it is,” Draco said grinning mischievously at Harry and winking at the dark-haired man as he waved his wand and conjured a soft blanket on the sand next to them. Harry raised an eyebrow at Draco as if to say “are we really doing this here?” Draco smirked and winked again at Harry before closing the gap between them and essentially tackling Harry onto the blanket. Harry landed with a surprised “oof” but that was all he managed before Draco’s mouth was on his. The two men were practically naked already which meant that just laying on top of each other sent electricity jolting through their bodies. Every inch of exposed skin was on fire but in the best way possible. Draco had initiated the kiss but Harry was the one who deepened it hungrily, desperate for more of the man he loved. Harry bit into Draco’s bottom lip as their tongues fought for dominance and Draco moaned at the delicious sting of pain.
Fred and George just laughed at Harry’s words and one of them said “how awful” but between the laughter and the wheezing it was hard to tell who had said it. George composed himself first and spoke to Harry.
“Now James. Now please, darling, settle down and play me your pretty little song.” Draco asked as he jumped into the comfy chair next to the piano. He stretched out his back before sitting with his tail wrapped around his legs, eager to hear his children sing.
Draco almost fell to the ground as Harry left him, completely spent. But Harry had been watching him and moved the blanket to catch his love before Draco could face plant into the sand. Harry then joined him on the blanket and held out his arms. Draco smiled as he turned to face Harry, silver eyes finding nothing but love and contentment in the emerald eyes watching him. Draco slowly moved to lay his head on Harry’s chest, still working on catching his breath. Harry’s chest was moving rapidly as he tried to get his breathing under control as well. Both men lay quietly for a while, regulating their breathing with smiles on their faces. Love was truly the best magic in the world, of that both men were certain. Soon the men started to feel cold, so they rushed into the ocean to clean themselves off, and warm themselves in the beautiful water.
Draco couldn’t help but giggle at the term though he tried to hide it behind his paw. “Old pickle-puss? Now now. James, that is not kind. You know Lucius is so fond of all of us, and takes very good care of us.
“Not a sign of them, Hermione.” Ron replied with a sad sigh. “And I searched all night once the rain stopped.”
“Me first, me first!” Yelled Scorpius.
“No…” Sirius sighed, “that’s mess call.”
“Silly stuff,” James retorted.
“Well, now, uh…What I meant…You see, I…” Harry stammered trying to come up with a good excuse.
“I have a better idea…come with me.” Harry said, winking at Draco as a sexy smirk crossed his face.
“Hush your mouth,” Sirius whispered, before lifting his ear back up to listen closer. “It’s a motorcycle. Two-cylinder chain drive, one squeaky wheel on the front it sounds like. You go for the tires, and I’ll go right for the seat of the problem.”
Harry watched the family of cats climb up the hill, and he felt sad at the fact that they were leaving him. He hadn’t expected the handsome white cat to have kittens, but was that really so bad? The tiger kitten especially, seemed like he would be fun to be around.  And who knows, maybe they would want him to stick around too.
“I don’t know what to say. I only wish that I…” Draco started.
Draco chuckled happily before he replied, “They could hardly keep their eyes open. Such an exciting day.” Draco sighed as he and Harry turned to face the city.
“Now, my little pesky pets, you’re going to travel first class. In your own private compartment.” Lucius rambled as he opened a giant trunk lid, his face contorted in wicked glee. Lucius dropped the bag full of cats into the trunk with a thud. Draco and his poor kittens yeowled at the pain as Lucius shut the lid of the trunk and kept talking as if he wasn’t doing something terribly wrong. “All the way to Timbuktu.” Lucius told them, locking the trunk with a combination lock and spinning it. “And this time…you’ll never come back.” Lucius declared triumphantly.
“Scorpius, my little one. You’re going to be as handsome as your father. Isn’t he Draco?”
“I vote that the last one to the beach gets naked,” Draco said as he quickly jumped from the edge of the ocean onto the sand.
“Now that’s quite a family.” Harry commented, chuckling to himself. “Come to think of it, Potter, you’re not a cat. You’re a rat. Right? Right.” Harry agreed with his self criticism, scrunching up his face in a mix of anger and annoyance. “Hey, hey! Hold up there.” He yelled out to Draco and his brood.
Lucius, certain of his aim, turned and ran towards the door to open it back up. He needed to get that blasted trunk out for pick up. A gasp escaped Lucius as he looked out, a herd of cats were running straight for him! Yeowling and hissing as they crashed into the depraved man, knocking him over. Lucius and Pans Cat’s gang of alley cats rolled over the floor a few times, each cat getting some good scratches in among the tussle. Ron had followed the stampede but made a beeline for Potter to see how he could help.
“Do you really have a magic carpet?” James asked excitedly.
“Oh, oh…Black.” Ron stammered.
“Oh, no. You just don’t understand. She loves us very much. Poor Madame, in that big mansion, all alone. In all our days, in tender ways, her love for us was shown. And so you see, we can’t leave her alone. She’d always say that we’re the greatest treasure she could own. Because with us, she never felt alone.” Draco explained, his heart aching at the thought of Narcissa all alone.
“Shh, shh. Listen,” Scorpius chided his brother, entranced as well by this Harry Potter. Harry rolled off the boulder as he started to sing again, walking slowly towards Draco, eyes never leaving the other cat.
“Oh. Oh, how unusual.
“Well he’s going about it all the wrong way.” Fred added in a low voice.
“Draco, this is the greatest cat of them all.” Harry introduced a flirtatious Pansy to Draco. Pansy waggled her eyebrows at the white cat, took off her fedora with a bow and smiled at the newcomer.
“You’re a shameless flatterer, Luna.” Narcissa said, waving a finger at her attorney while shaking her head and giggling more.
"You do? Interesting because I always feel like I need you, Harry..."
Both men slept soundly through the night until rather late the next morning thanks to the blackout curtains. Harry was the first to stir, his bladder forcing him awake whether he wanted to or not. Holding back a grumble, Harry gently untangled his limbs from Draco’s so that he could head to the bathroom. Draco stirred slightly, annoyed at the loss of Harry’s warmth but he didn’t wake up immediately. Eventually, Draco woke up when he subconsciously reached out for Harry and didn’t find him. Draco’s grey eyes flashed open looking around for the dark-haired man. Harry had just returned from the bathroom and upon seeing Draco awake he smiled brightly.
Lucius hooked his umbrella on a tree near him and used his momentum to circle the tree on the sidecar. He took off as if he had been shot out of a slingshot, and smiled to himself holding all of his belongings in his arms. The bale of hay on the wheelbarrow kept on going until it crashed hard into a house.
“Well, humans don’t really worry too much about their pets.” Harry pointed out.
“Harry… I need you to take me. Now.” Draco whimpered, between shallow breaths, every syllable dripping with need.
“Groovy, Papa, groovy,” James purred from the piano.
“On water, of course.”
“Very poetic, Monsieur. But it is not quite Shakespeare,” Draco replied shyly.
“Of course Madame,” Lucius replied, “how could anyone forget her?”
“Scorpius! Oh Scorpius!” Draco jumped down closer to the water to watch his son, not sure of what to do.
Draco giggled happily and fluttered his eyelashes at the black cat before him. This cat was funny and handsome, the perfect man, even if he was an alley cat.
The twins chuckled as George told their Uncle, “That’s stick together.” And with that, the trio of giggling, shushing and yelling geese started to waddle drunkenly away.
“Look, there’s Ron!” Albus pointed out.
The handle hit Sirius on the chin and almost took off his head in it’s trail upwards. Sirius glared up at the umbrella, angry at being attacked by an object. Lucius had been standing atop the hay, trying to get his umbrella back and needing the leverage to pull it harder, as the umbrella finally got free. However, Lucius slipped on the hay and slid off the bale. The momentum of his fall sent the sidecar flying as he fell on his bottom.
“Whoever it is, is gonna get it and get it good,” Sirius growled, crouching into a sneaky position as he set out to discover the thief.
The herd of cats and the mouse ran down a busy sidewalk, full of shops and cafes, at one of the tables sat Mundungus Fletcher, getting an early start to his day of drinking. He had a bottle of wine that he was drinking from without a glass as his bleary eyes looked around lazily. Not caring what was happening around him, but wanting some visual stimulation nonetheless. As he looked around, Mundungus saw a small pack of cats running past him at full speed, being chased by a tiny mouse! His eyes grew wide and he attempted to sit up straighter as he did a double take, surely he didn’t see what he thought he had seen? After watching the mouse continue to chase the cats, Mundungus looked at his bottle, put his head on his hand, and poured the liquor out onto the sidewalk. Clearly he was drunk enough already. The cats and Ron ran through the streets heading towards the mansion in a furry flurry.
The goose mumbled drunkenly to himself, his chubby belly drooped enough to cover his feet, and his dark feathers helped him blend into the darkness. He was a rather large goose, bigger than most. He was sure that the cook had been eager to serve him up, but he wasn’t about to be someone else’s dinner. Hagrid righted himself and then wrapped one wing around the lamp post, to hold himself up when he bent to pick up his poor hat. The top had come off slightly and was only attached by a few threads. The base of the top hat was crumpled too. He blew off the dust to the best of his ability, and gently put his hat back on his head. Finally, seeing the cause of the commotion, and the goose standing outside of the restaurant, George commented.
“And toodley-pip.” Fred added while they started to walk back up the riverbank.
Scorpius didn’t say anything in response. He merely stood up, tried to get himself to full height, and stuck his tongue out at his brother wordlessly. Additionally the white kitten was glaring rather fiercely at his brother. Then the kittens ran to catch up to their father, who was still chasing poor Harry from the riverbank watching the black cat while he attempted to float along on the log.
Harry moaned into the kiss as he let it deepen for a little while, enjoying the intimacy of the moment. However, before he lost control and took Draco right there, Harry broke their kiss by leaning back to push them both down the slide. Draco cuddled closer to Harry and felt the other man’s arms tighten around him as they headed down. Harry rested his chin on top of Draco’s head as they flew down the slide, giggling at their positions but not caring.
Harry returned with two steaming mugs of tea and placed one on the nightstand by Draco before setting his own down and climbing into bed himself. The covers were incredibly soft without being too warm and Harry was certain he would sleep very well in this bed. Not having brought a book of his own, Harry turned to look at what Draco was reading. He chuckled when he recognized their favorite collection of short stories and smiled over at the blond.
“Okay, let’s charge. Ooof!” Remus fell on his chin as Sirius grabbed his tail to prevent the smaller dog from running ahead.
"I like the way you think, Malfoy… oh well I mean Draco. I guess first names work better for friends huh?"
“Good night, Harry,” Draco replied wistfully.
“Yes, let’s swing it Harry,” Draco agreed excitedly.
Harry perked up at the kitten’s words and at Draco’s face, loving the way the other cat was looking at him. He smiled happily at Draco when the white cat started to talk.
Draco smiled at his son before continuing to dance with Harry, his silver eyes locked on the black cat’s sparkling green ones. Albus had ventured closer to Pansy, curious about her instrument. Pans Cat swept off her fedora with a flourish and offered her trumpet to the ginger kitten.
“Yes Papa,” James replied, standing once more to play the piano.
“No, no, no, I like it. Well, all it needs is a little tidying up, and maybe a little extra love.”
Draco cast one last, sorrowful look at Harry before following his kittens inside. The door shut behind them and Lucius greeted the cats kindly, as if they hadn’t ruined his plans.
Sirius responded by hitting him over the head with a paw.
As Ron ran out to get help, Albus smugly remarked, “I told you it was Lucius.”
“Oh, never mind. Just run, move, go get him!” Draco called as Ron managed to open the vent in the door.
“You mean he’s had too much!” George corrected his twin which led to another round of loud goose giggles.
“You are charming.” Draco giggled as Pansy played with her fedora this time. “And your music is so…so different, so exciting,” he gushed at the band.
“Oh, jeez, I think we’d better be going.” Fred agreed.
“I’ll see ya in the morning, Sirius,” Remus agreed as he slid down into the basket, his feet almost touching the bow at the top.
Pans played a few notes before stopping to address her friend Harry. “Well, lookie here. Big man Potter’s back in his alley. Swing on down here, daddy.”
Lucius hopped down from his post and offered his hand to Narcissa to help her down. She gave him a wary look before almost using his hand to steady herself, she changed her mind last minute in case it gave him the wrong impression. Still she needed to be polite so she thanked him as she headed into the mansion. He had driven them around after all.
While they watched the geese depart, Harry felt himself smiling. The kittens had quite enjoyed the scene Hagrid had made and so they watched the geese leave both happy and a little sad at the loss of entertainment. Draco had spent most of the conversation trying not to laugh, and it felt nice to be able to breathe freely again. He had been worried about offending the twins by laughing at their uncle’s shenanigans.
“Good night, Draco,” Harry called as his love jumped off the chimney and headed back to his kittens.
“To your cats?” Luna repeated, not sure if she heard properly.
“Well yes, I mean…I don’t mean to interrupt. But, but it so happens that, I have a cracker with me.” Ron accepted excitedly, showing his cracker to the group that had previously been hidden behind his back.
“There now, Draco. That’s better. We must both look our best for Luna. She’s our nicest and dearest friend, you know.” Narcissa finished primping her hair so that she could pet Draco’s head gently.
As the dogs fell back to sleep, Lucius made his move. Perched so that he was leaning precariously against the top of the mountain of hay, he slowly reeled his fishing hook down. His goal was to get his hat back off of Sirius’s head. He managed to hook the hat on the first try, but as he reeled it up, the hat fell off the hook and landed on the head of the smaller dog. Lucius looked down in shock at his bad luck and noticed that Sirius was stirring below him. Sirius’s paws went up to scratch his head, but he noticed his hat was missing! Wide awake once more, Sirius looked around frantically for his runaway accessory. He looked all around his bed but didn’t see it, then he checked the ground, and that was when Sirius saw his hat on Remus’s head! Furious, Sirius reached down to take back his hat while chiding Remus.
At the end of the sidewalk, Harry and Draco were trying to find a way to say goodbye, neither of them had considered that the kittens might be in trouble. Draco sighed and looked down at his paws sadly.
“Everybody wants to be a cat,
Harry and Draco spent the next day relaxing indoors, soaking up their free time with books and movies they had been wanting to read or watch. On their last day of vacation they would go to the waterfall and spend the day there so they wanted one day to just relax indoors.
“There is a whole network of Wizard BnB’s created by those of us who are familiar with Muggle technology because they have a version called AirBnB, so we took their idea and made it work for us,” Harry said with a shrug as they lay next to each other.
"Sure you do, Malfoy. And I will be quiet if you are. Though now that I think about it I am not sure you know how to be quiet..."
Inside the house, Lucius was tying a knot in the top of the sack, complaining to the cats as he did so. “You came back? Oh, it just isn’t fair.” Lucius whined as he shook the sack he was holding.
“Draco, it’s wonderful to have you all back. And I think this young man is very handsome.” Narcissa commented as she brushed Harry’s fur.
“Of course,” Harry replied confidently, “I’m the only cat of my kind.” Harry plucked a flower and gently tossed it at Draco’s feet.
Back at the front door, Ron was still trying to yell through the window at the kittens. “Don’t come in! Look out for Lucius!” Ron hid as he said the man’s name because the butler was opening the front door for them.
“Well, this ought to be interesting. I feel like we should stretch first.” Harry joked.
“Oh just how much fun we are going to have this week,” Harry replied blushing slightly.
“Papa, I’m tired,” Scorpius whined from his place on Harry’s back.
Narcissa spun around in front of her floor length mirror, touching up her hair as she did so and smiling down at Draco. He looked regal in his new collar that she had bought him today. He had needed one that matched Scorpius’s better, so Narcissa shopped until she found the perfect one. It was silver still, but studded with shining emeralds, highlighting how clean Draco’s fur was, pure and white. His silver eyes seemed to dazzle as he took in his image as well, he sat atop a nice cushion admiring his reflection. His tail was full and thick, and he was the perfect example of a purebred cat. The classical music from the gramophone filled the room as Narcissa started to speak.
“Yeah…let’s go back to bed,” Albus yawned. Scorpius was the last kitten to leave the window, still hopeful that something would change.
“Whoa Hermione! Whoa. Steady girl.” Lucius said as he pulled back on the reins as they arrived outside of the mansion.
Draco wasn’t phased by Harry’s glare, so he merely chuckled in response before turning Harry around in his arms and kissing him. Harry moaned into the kiss, deepening it immediately, as he always craved more of Draco. Draco responded by pushing Harry against the wall of the shower forcefully, causing Harry to moan once more and Draco swallowed the sound greedily as their tongues fought for dominance. They stayed locked at the lips until the water started to cool down, only the temperature drop could get them away from one another. They were on vacation after all, and both men hoped to have a lot of sex during their time off. If he was being honest, Harry had mentally called it their “time off to get off” numerous times. Which always made him chuckle to himself, though he wouldn’t admit his nickname for their vacation to anyone else. Harry was thinking of this to himself as he dried off, a grin spreading across his face.
“We didn’t mean to ruffle you, squeaky.” Neville said with a smile as he playfully lifted Ron’s hat off his head.
“Just need a few, then I need you to take me…” Draco murmured breathlessly. Harry smiled and kissed the blond’s lips gently before summoning the lube from their bag. He took his time gently getting Draco ready for him, not wanting to disrupt his boyfriend’s attempt to calm himself more than was necessary. Then Harry focused on himself and by the time they were both lubed up, Draco’s breathing had become steadier. Grey eyes locked on green before Draco nodded.
Harry tucked the phone into his desk drawer then, hoping that would help him focus. Unfortunately, he still had the damn thing on vibrate so the whole desk shook as a new text came through. Harry jumped at the sensation, his pen jerking across the page he was working on. He cursed under his breath and quickly fixed his mistake before grabbing his phone.
"Well it's not like I can steal a chair from you and I am not about to sit on your lap. But whatever I am shutting up as well, enjoy your damn chair."
Draco chuckled as he chased Harry back to the main cavern, exhilarated by both their surroundings and the man he was sharing this adventure with. Draco caught up with Harry and pulled his partner into his arms. Their bubbles merged as they locked in a passionate kiss, treading water to stay afloat which caused their legs to intertwine. Harry and Draco lost themselves in each other, so much so that they started to sink towards the bottom. Even though they didn’t need to breathe, Draco started to get a little nervous so close to the bottom. He broke their kiss and pointed up to the surface as Harry looked at Draco in confusion. Harry nodded and they swam up to the surface, reversing their bubble head charms as they climbed out of the cavern. Harry grabbed their towels, placed them down and flopped onto it. He gave Draco a “come hither” look and posed as sexily as possible on the towel.
Draco chuckled and sat down next to Harry on the towel. Harry pulled Draco on top of him and mashed their lips together. Draco returned the kiss passionately, deepening it immediately as his hands roamed over Harry’s chest. Harry’s hands explored Draco’s chest in return moaning into their kiss. Draco rolled them over, wanting Harry to take him hard and fast. They kissed for a little while longer, but Draco did his best to whisper what he wanted in between their kisses.
“Let’s take it to another key…”
“Oh, Scorpius, are you all right?” Draco worried over his son.
“Dreadful.” Hagrid mumbled in agreement with the black cat, too intoxicated to feel offended over the look he was receiving. “Being British, I would have preferred sherry.” Hagrid finished his thought and started to laugh obnoxiously at his own joke. Fred and George, of course, joined in raucously.
Harry looked down and his emerald eyes found Draco’s silver ones watching him. He blinked for a second, making sure that this handsome white cat was indeed real, before smirking and continuing with his song, still maintaining eye contact.
“A muggle with a horn makes you wish you weren’t born…” Harry sang as he and Pans cat landed next to each other on a cushion. Harry started to swing his tail in time to the beat, smiling happily as Pansy lined up back to back with him. Pansy played with her fedora as she joined in the song once more.
“Nope, not here love. At least not while I am cooking. I don’t think it would be wise to have a repeat of last time.” Harry reminded the blond gently.
Eyes locked on each other, Draco started to ride Harry’s cock, up and down, slowly at first to help Harry match his rhythm. Draco’s hands reached for Harry’s, grasping them tightly above his head to help him balance as the two men picked up speed. Draco cried out as Harry kept taking him all the way to the hilt, loving how full he felt with each thrust. Harry’s moans echoed those of Draco's; the weight of the blond combined with the look in his eyes managed to make Harry even harder. Soon both men were gasping for air, both on the verge of finishing, eyes still locked on each other which only added to the heat of the moment. Draco’s lips smashed against Harry's, the kiss deepening immediately as Draco opened his mouth to welcome in Harry’s tongue. That sent Harry over to the edge and he pulled away from their kiss to shout Draco’s name as his white hot seed spurted into the blond’s hot ass. Draco came at the sound of Harry yelling his name, and he cried Harry’s name as his own seed coated Harry’s stomach.
The sputtering of an engine got their attention, and both dogs looked up to find the source. They saw Lucius, the man they had chased away not long ago, whistling smugly as he drove away. Lucius had the sidecar attached to his bike via his umbrella’s handle, with the fishing pole and basket in the car. And his hat was still on his head, so his mission was accomplished without any new bites. He sat up straighter in light of his triumph as he drove away.
Ron nodded and turned to go…before the words sank in, then he stopped and repeated, “Alley cats? But I’m a mouse.”
“To the olden days…” Pansy finished for him, both of them now dancing facing away from Draco and his kittens. James and Albus were dancing back to back atop a straw hat on the floor, trying to mimic the dynamic duo currently putting on a show.
“Whoops!” She called out as she righted herself before going back to her lively singing. “Ra ra ra boom di ay…” She sang the same part over and over, as if it were an ear-worm stuck in her head.
The twins shushed him again and he responded with a loud whoop!
“Knows where what’s at?” Scorpius yawned.
“I got ‘er wide open,” came the response as Sirius attempted to charge while pushing the sidecar and Remus in front of him.
“Where is it?” Scorpius mirrored his brother’s excitement.
“Aw, shut up, Albus.” James grumbled.
“Very good darling, that was very nice.” Draco commended his son.
Soon though, both Sirius and Lucius were faced with another problem – Remus and his speeding sidecar were heading straight for them! Remus managed to lean over just enough that they didn’t collide, however he still wanted in on the action. So as he passed the two, Remus grabbed the man’s suspenders with his teeth and let the momentum and the elasticity of the fabric pull him over to the motorcycle. His sidecar managed to come with him and he collided into the back of the motorcycle, causing it to speed up. Remus was still trailing behind the motorbike when they all approached a windmill and he saw the blond man stand up on the handlebars again. Upon seeing the windmill, Lucius had decided it was his best chance of escape, so he jumped onto one of the blades as it spun near the ground, hoping to get those dogs off his tail once and for all.
“You’re not gonna believe this. But it’s a one-wheeled haystack. Hey, there it goes. Come on! After it!” Sirius ordered as they charged down the road, following the haystack intensely.
Play your horn,
"Well, I was here first so kindly leave and feel free to let the door hit your ass on your way out."
Completely spent, Draco fell forward onto Harry’s chest, not caring about the mess there. The only thought in Draco’s mind was his need to be held by Harry. Harry chuckled as he grabbed his wand, a simple swish cleaned them both up as Harry pulled Draco ever closer to him. Content, Draco rested his head above Harry’s heart and sighed, relaxing even more at the sound of Harry’s beating heart. Harry sighed contentedly and snuggled Draco closer, enjoying having his lover close. They lay there, savoring the safety and love they could feel surrounding them, as if their love was creating a barrier between them and the world. Harry and Draco’s favorite place was always in the other’s arms, regardless of where they were in the world.
Draco’s silver eyes shone with love as Harry approached him and he held his hand out to his boyfriend. Draco pulled out his own wand and cast the bubble head charm on himself, not liking the idea of accidentally swallowing sea water. Harry took Draco’s hand and slowly drifted backwards in the water to make room for Draco to join him. Draco eased himself into the water, still holding on to Harry’s hand for moral support. As they started to swim together Draco kept hold of Harry’s hand, wanting to feel safe. Harry squeezed his hand reassuringly as they swam together and after a few minutes, Harry felt some of the tension leave Draco’s body.
“Come along Draco, kittens. Come along!” Narcissa called in a sing-song voice as she headed through the open door. Lucius was standing outside waiting for her to go in before putting away Hermione. As soon as she entered, Narcissa realized that she had forgotten something so she stuck her head out to speak with Lucius once more.
Harry smiled and leaned into Draco’s hand enjoying the love he could feel practically emanating from the blond’s body. Harry’s emerald eyes locked onto Draco’s silver and a gasp left Harry’s lips as well. Draco’s silvery-grey eyes reflected back the dancing turquoise of the ocean in the most beautiful way. Draco looked like an ocean god, a very gay, sparkle covered ocean god, but a god nonetheless. Harry thought the orange of the sunlight highlighted Draco’s muscles delightfully and Harry struggled to keep his distance. In unison, the two men closed the gap between their lips and kissed each other as if they hadn’t kissed in years. Harry deepened the kiss immediately and swallowed Draco’s moan hungrily as Draco gently nipped at Harry’s bottom lip. Then it was Harry’s turn to whimper, loving the little bit of pain the nip caused him, and as their kiss continued to deepen, both men lost themselves in each other. They didn’t break apart until Harry pressed up against Draco too hard and both of them tumbled into the ocean.
"Yeah let's also test out this first name thing… Harry."
All of a sudden, Lucius was standing on his handlebars, gripping them tightly with his hands as he spun around and around on his precarious perch. He was really not a fan of this brown dog, it was vicious and out of control.
“When everybody wants to be a cat,” Pansy and Harry sang together, outlined by an empty picture frame Neville was pushing along for them, still dancing in time to the beat.
Lucius threw on his coat and ran to the door, opening it with a bow for Narcissa. She walked out the door, calling for her babies. “Draco? Kittens? Come here, my darlings. Where are you? Come on.” Narcissa called anxiously, opening her arms wide.
“Oh Luna, we are just a pair of sentimental old fools.” Narcissa laughs snuggling close to Draco as he continues to purr. Scorpius and Albus join them both on the couch at her words.
Harry had just handed in his case file to the Head Auror when the sounds of a commotion reached his ears. Harry turned on the spot, wand at the ready, only to realize the voice that seemed to be the cause of the commotion. Harry shook his head and sighed loudly as he put away his wand and strode purposefully out of the Auror section. Sure enough Draco was outside of the Auror room yelling loudly about needing to see his husband immediately as it was an emergency. The poor guard posted at the door looked almost faint as he tried to restrain a very fit, very determined Draco from running inside a place that technically he wasn’t allowed in. Harry cleared his throat before speaking, hoping that hearing his voice would help Draco calm down.
A second after Harry had promised peace and quiet, a light came on inside his penthouse and loud jazz music flowed out of the open window.
“Harry! Oh, Harry! Take care!” Draco called out to the heroic and handsome black cat.
“Meow.” Was Draco’s only response.
“Now, now Albus. Albus, come along dear.”
“Shhh!!!” The twins chastised him.
Harry James Potter,
“Every time he plays.”
“Sherry! Sherry!” Hagrid shouted leaping into the air, before falling back onto his bottom from lack of balance. He looked up at his nephews with a bemused expression on his face, not a care in the world. He was drunk, he was loud, but he was in good company which is all that mattered.
“I’m the leader. I’ll decide what it was. It was a little old cricket bug,” Sirius grumped, settling back into the side car to sleep.
“You might say we’re related.” George chuckled his response.
“Nice doggy, nice doggy! Heel, roll over, play dead!” Lucius called out commands frantically as he spun around in circles.
“Oh trust me, I plan to wear my speedo all week long. It is a vacation after all,” Draco said with a smirk as he pressed his lips gently to Harry’s.
“Well, c’est la guerre, Sirius. I guess you can’t win ‘em all.” Remus shrugged.
“Don’t panic. Down underneath here.” Harry ordered them all, trying to stay calm.
Not far from where Harry was currently hugging a log for dear life, there waddled two geese.   They were heading down to the river for a swim break, to rest their tired flat feet. Fred wore a blue top hat on his head and his twin brother George wore a green top hat. It helped their family members to tell them apart. They were identical after all. Their feathers were a combination of brown and white.  But even the way their feathers were coloured, was exactly the same on them both, so hats became their thing.
“Then you’d best be quiet, hmm?” He said, even as he wrung a groan of pleasure from the pale throat, one of his hands fondling the semi-erection that was already present from his attentions. Draco managed a brief glare at that teasing statement before his eyes fell closed. Harry watched him struggle against the arousal for a moment, and his face slowly warp into rapture. He let his hand slip away, and kissed his way to the soft pink mouth, licking and sucking the lips he’d already gorged on the previous night. It still wasn’t enough. Wet slippery kisses connected them as Draco struggled not to make a sound under Harry’s assault. To his surprise, he’d made barely more than a choked moan before the twitching heat of orgasm met his hand.
When he turned to face Draco, he caught the same emotions on the blond’s face, and pulled him roughly into another kiss. He couldn’t help himself. He felt as if he was freefalling into pure emotion, a mixture of hope, love, and fear filling his every thought as he tried to drown himself in the kisses. When hands tugged at him, pulling him toward the door, Harry grinned maliciously into the needy kisses, and wrapped his arms firmly around Draco. A moment of quiet struggle was all it took for him to take the blond to the floor. He easily trapped his love, who struggled carefully so he wouldn’t wake the child, and not nearly enough to free himself. Finally, he broke the kiss, and hissed quietly at Harry.
“You can’t… Ron almost caught on last time. He’ll lose his mind if he finds out.” Harry managed to explain. Malfoy growled in displeasure.
“You can’t tell how much stronger their scent is?” Ron asked, and Hermione gave him a chastising look.
“Well, typical marking is done with a bite, so the pheromones mingle with yours, literally making you emit theirs, until it wears off, or is replaced. Usually between three and six months, depending on the severity of the mark. It leaves a
“Don’t
His tongue stumbled over the name, and blushed at his own question, but Luna just looked thoughtful for a moment, not even noticing his awkwardness.
“I don’t mind.” He glanced up at Malfoy, and quickly looked back to the baby. He absolutely could NOT engage in the look Malfoy was giving him. It was one of his scarce looks of open contentment.
“They’re probably all the same.” Hermione told him a bit waspishly, finding her own room. Her room was between Padma Patil’s and Ron’s, and on the other side of Ron’s, at the far end of the corridor, was Harry’s. He stood in front of it for a moment while all the other students went in, came back out, shouted to each other, and explored their new spaces. He hesitated. He was a bit terrified of what might be on the other side, worried that the others might feel the extra wards if they tried to go in with him. He was terrified that something inside might give away what he was, and even more terrified that Hermione had been right. That all these rooms were the same. That it would be impersonal, that it wouldn’t feel like
“Are you sure? If whoever you’re seeing presently is unable to continue, then I’d be more than happy to-”
Through the haze of mint and kissing, Harry felt a hand creep up his shirt, and gave a soft groan of appreciation. He was too warm, too sensitive, and touch was the only thing that helped. It wasn’t as instantly overwhelming as Malfoy’s pheromones had been, but it was still nice. Harry was enjoying himself, and reasoned that this was what Madam Pomfrey had suggested, afterall.
Draco’s face was buried in his neck, his hips slamming up, and Harry felt the sharp sting of teeth before the swelling that filled him. His orgasm slammed through him at the dual sensations and he could do nothing but ride it out, gasping in the scent of his partner.
He sat at breakfast, and was doing his level best to ignore the sudden rush of scents that surrounded him, when Ron collapsed onto the bench next to him, bringing that familiar tangy smell with him. Harry held his breath for a moment, and then focused on breathing normally as he ate his eggs. Ron piled a plate with his usual fare and got three mouthfuls shoveled in when he turned to Harry.
He led Malfoy out the back door, and into the small, closed off alley. He shut the door behind them, and leaned against it, blocking it with his body, so no one could come out after them ‘accidentally’. Malfoy faced him silently, head tilted at an insolent angle.
now. We’ve never been particularly close, and I usually can’t bloody stand you, but… this can’t go on.”
“Er… Good. I’ve been good. You?” Harry asked, eyeing the books speculatively again.
“Shame. An Alpha is probably the only thing that could make it pass more quickly.” She said in a curt no-nonsense tone. Harry recalled his first, and last conversation about the subject. Having sex with an Alpha would end his heat, but he’d risk getting pregnant.
“Harry, over here!” The call from across the library made Madam Pince frown, and Harry startle as he swung to face the familiar sound. Luna sat at a table halfway down an aisle, with a stack of books by her, and a serene smile on her face as she beckoned him over. Harry cast one look around, but saw no one that might save him from whatever strange subject Luna was researching this time. He walked down the aisle toward her and took a seat, eyeing the books she had gathered. It looked like a collection of random spell books and charms, but Harry couldn’t determine any common factor just from the titles.
“True. True.” Harry agreed with a nod and a smile.
“With a muggle in the act, you can set music back, to the olden days,” Pans and Harry sang together. They mimicked a wand being used and broken as they did so. Scorpius chimed in, dancing along with them, pretending he himself had a wand.
Lucius’s face was contorted in terror as he watched himself fly back towards his waiting steed, Hermione. She reared up her back legs and gave him a forceful kick as he came into range. The kick sent Lucius flying into the trunk, and the continued momentum brought him the rest of the way out of the stable. Harry darted out and quickly put the lock back on the trunk, not wanting to take chances. Harry had barely gotten back inside the stable when the delivery truck approached.
Draco followed suit, sitting right beside Harry and leaned up against him, cuddling in closer as Harry wrapped an arm around his waist. The sharks kept swimming around lazily, a few looked at the wrinkles in the water, but that was the extent of their curiosity. Deciding that it would be safe to jump in Harry eased his way into the water. His head went under and he held his breath as he looked around at the sharks. None of them did more than glance his way so he stayed under as long as he could before breaching the surface. Harry smiled up at Draco and held out his hand to his blond boyfriend.
“Mm. This is yummy. Scorpius agreed.
Wasting no time, Harry took Draco’s cock in his mouth, teasing the tip with his tongue first before sliding down to Draco’s hilt. Harry’s tongue added to Draco’s pleasure as he worked the blond’s shaft up and down. Draco sighed Harry’s name and pulled at the man’s hair as his hips thrust into Harry’s mouth. Harry moaned at the new pace, but matched it perfectly. Draco thought for sure he would finish soon, so he gently lifted Harry’s face to his and kissed the man gently. He wanted Harry inside him, so he slowly left the pool, beckoning Harry to follow him with his finger. Harry let Draco lead him to the sandy shore summoning a tube of lube as he walked. Draco had summoned a small towel, but he knew they were likely to roll off of it at some point, sand was beginning to turn him on.
“You know, they need…Well, you know, a sort of a, well, a second parent around,” Harry said as his swinging tail finally connected to hold Draco’s.
“I’ll never forget you, Harry Potter. Bye.” Draco forced his eyes to look away from Harry as he walked towards his kittens and his home.
“Oh, where am I? I’m not at home at all,” Draco thought aloud, sitting up and looking around. He jumped from the riverbank onto a branch before speaking again.
“Now Luna, do be serious. I have asked you to come here on a very important legal matter.” Narcissa tries to scold the other woman but her voice is far too kind for it to be effective.
Harry and Draco cuddled together for a while, enjoying the peace of their morning. Nowhere to go, no time frame, no need to rush, just two men in love on an island. Draco eventually had to use the toilet as well and Harry got up to make them some breakfast and start the coffee. Draco freshened up a little before heading into the kitchen to keep Harry company… and possibly try to distract him. Harry was wearing an apron over his boxers that read “kiss the cook” and Draco was more than happy to oblige. He strutted over to Harry, wrapped his arms around the man’s midsection and gently planted a kiss at the hollow of Harry’s neck.
“Mm something smells awfully good.” Ron giggled. “What is that appetizing smell?”
“Oh, yes. Yes, I do. Bottoms up!” Fred called out, realizing that the cat in fact, could not swim.
Albus was having a bit of a time actually getting his paints to go where he needed them. He caught the splurt of pink paint before it fell to the ground, but the teal was a different story. It fell to the floor and nearly landed on top of James who swiftly moved farther from the easel. Once he had a nice purple mixed together, Albus jumped onto his chair, paw dripping with paint and ready to create. As he painted, he rubbed his chin and got green paint on his fur at one point, thinking more about what to paint than where the paint was going. He finished his painting rather quickly and stood back to admire his work. As he did so, Albus heard laughter from his siblings.
“Heavens! Stupid cat! Brainless lunatic!” Rosmerta shouted angrily while she waved her fists in the air indignantly.
“If you want, I think it sounds fun, I want to get tangled up in you,” Draco said with a wink.
Hermione glared at the man, annoyed to even know him, in that moment. She loved Draco and his kittens as much as she loved the Madame, who always treated her so well. Anything that helped keep Narcissa happy was great in her book; the old lady was kind and full of love. Hermione was livid, and if looks could kill, Lucius wouldn’t be walking or laughing ever again. Ron had climbed up to hide in Hermione’s mane when Lucius came in, not wanting to be found or possibly stepped on. At Lucius’s confession, Ron moved up right next to Hermione’s ear.
Draco giggled nervously before speaking. “Oh, my. Monsieur, your name seems to cover everything.”
“I say. Look over there.” George said, recovering first.
He looked under the first wheelbarrow he came to, nothing. He sneaked around some more, not realizing that his shoes, to those with better hearing, were in fact rather squeaky. Lucius tiptoed between the large piles of hay, looking around for his possessions. He found them at the same time that he found those vicious dogs. The brown one was sleeping in his side car, wearing his hat and the dog also had his umbrella! The little dog was sleeping in the bassinet Lucius had put Draco and the kittens in. Lucius had to bite back a scream as he ran away from the dogs, not wanting to be seen by them if he could prevent it.
“That’s a long way off, so we better get moving.” Harry responded, leading them out of the hut.
“I only got myself,
“Now, my pets, a little closer together. Good. Good.” Narcissa instructed gently.
Harry spun the pointer with his wand as they broke apart, and the arrow landed on the left hand-red. A few spins later the men were interwoven like a human pretzel, barely able to hold up their bodies which caused them to slip. Harry flicked his wand at the spinner and lost his balance, which led to Draco falling on top of him as they both collapsed onto the mat. They lay there chuckling for quite a while before playing a few more rounds, each one ending in a similar fashion. Eventually, as they lay giggling, both men’s stomachs started to grumble loud enough to be heard over their laughter. They got to their feet to get ready for dinner. Harry started to cook a simple but delicious meal while Draco helped set the table before he sat down to watch the green eyed man cook. Draco was almost drooling due to the smell but also due to the view, as Harry was cooking in just his boxers.
“His name is Potter. Potter.” Draco replied.
“Especially when he’s marinated.” Draco chimed in giggling happily.
“Oh, it’s a sad day for all of us.” Ron agreed.
Soon all of the animals nearby were singing along, and the chorus got so loud that Sirius could hear it out on his farm. His ear stood up to listen closer for a minute before he said anything to his partner. They joined in the song as well, but with howls rather than singing about being a cat, because they enjoyed being dogs. As the final note died away, Remus scratched his chin and spoke to Sirius.
“Exactly? You either are, or you’re not.” Fred said, raising his eyebrows at the black cat.
Albus, also entranced by the alley cat, was currently paying rapt attention to the way this Potter guy walked. He was trying to imitate the cat’s stance with his legs as he watched from the basket, still hidden from view with his siblings.
They barely broke contact in time to stop themselves from inhaling the salt water. Harry smiled at Draco lovingly and the two of them collapsed into a fit of giggles. Draco pulled Harry into his arms and they stood next to each other, still laughing as they watched the sunset. As the sun reached the horizon, the two lovers started to splash at each other, using the naturally occurring waves to drench each other. Harry and Draco laughed heartily as they played in the ocean like two carefree kids, finally relaxing completely from their long days at work. When splashing got boring, they both ran back onto the beach, deciding that it might be nice to dry off before going back inside. Draco had a different plan though, as soon as he heard “beach vacation” Draco had been hoping to make love to Harry on the beach. He didn’t care that they would both be covered in sand from head to toe, he just wanted to take Harry out in the open, with the serene soundtrack of the ocean in their ears.
Rosmerta was back on track to deliver her load now, and hadn’t seen the cats all sneak in the back. Glad to be back on the road, Rosmerta was driving along, humming happily to herself. Her red hair was flying in the wind but she didn’t care, she preferred it down anyways. Harry, Draco and the kittens were starting to relax, now that the drama had passed, and that’s when Harry had a great idea. They were in a truck that was carrying cream…so it would be a shame not to eat.
“So if you’re going my way,
Draco yelled out in ecstasy at the new ministrations, Harry knew his favorite places, knew where his most erotic spots were and Harry did his best to hit them all. Draco’s hips gyrated into Harry’s attention, needing more of Harry’s affection. Harry moaned as Draco thrust against his body, his kisses toying with the line of Draco’s speedo for a little while longer, until Draco was begging him for more. Harry obliged by taking off Draco’s speedo in one swift motion, setting the blond’s erection free, causing Harry’s breath to hitch at the sight. Deciding to take his time, and really savor his lover, Harry pulled back from Draco’s body to lick his lips and wink at the blond. They locked eyes, silver on emerald as Harry took Draco’s length in his mouth, sucking all the way down to the blond’s hilt. Draco cried out Harry’s name in his pleasure as his hands dug into the sand beneath him as his eyes closed, breaking their contact.
“I got a feelin’ this case is gonna bust wiiiiide open.”
Once they tired themselves out on the slide, they summoned their clothes, putting them inside their waterproof packs, as they headed towards the waterfall. Harry and Draco held hands as they walked through the curtain of water, gasping as a grotto appeared before them, the rocks shimmering from the spray of the water. The world behind the water was beautiful, dark yet inviting and somehow they found it comforting. The pool of water behind the fall seemed to be rather deep, which meant they would have a lot of room to swim here as well, an activity both men enjoyed partaking in together. They had to swim across the pool to the grotto’s edge before they could remove their packs. Harry got out of the water and started to rifle through his bag, famished after their water slide adventures. He pulled out a sandwich, offered Draco half, which he took hungrily, and they tapped the halves together before starting to eat.
“So much like our own dear England.”
“Gracious, Fred. You don’t suppose?”
Draco’s lack of attention was Harry’s cue to turn him over, so in one swift motion, Harry rolled them both around , putting Draco’s body underneath his. Draco quickly got on his hands and knees, desperate for Harry to take him. Harry started to get Draco ready for him, slowly inserting his lubed fingers inside the blond and enjoying every sound that came out of him. Draco thrust backward hard on Harry’s fingers, wanting more, needing more. Harry took his time, slowly moving, adding one finger at a time and priming Draco to take all of him. After spending some time with three fingers, Harry decided it was time to give Draco what he really wanted. Adding a little extra lube with his wand, Harry gently approached Draco’s hole, and pressed his erection against it, not going in quite yet, wanting to tease Draco once more. Draco moaned in anticipation as he felt Harry right outside of him, and he let out a small whimper, needing so much more of Harry than he currently had. That whimper broke Harry’s resolve and he gently pushed his way inside Draco.
Lucius shut the door behind him and shook his head sadly as well before he replied, “I’m so sorry, Madame.” Narcissa didn’t see the giant smile on his face as she had turned away from him to head upstairs.
“Yes Papa.”
“Look, Luna. What do you think?” Narcissa asked, turning to look at the other woman after checking the camera.
Showin’ off my cool bolt, yeah,”
“I’m ready maestro.” Scorpius announced sarcastically. James stood up and started to play the keys hurriedly. He started in the middle of them and went all the way to the side where Scorpius sat all prim and proper. The piano made an unsettling sound as he hit the last key and Scorpius cried out. His poor tail had been under the final key and now it was bent and hurting. “Papa! He did it again!” Scorpius yelled.
“It’s time to practice your scales and your arpeggios.” Draco reminded them.
“We are to meet Uncle Hagrid at Le Petit Cafe.” George explained.
"Fine. I am shutting up now. Staying over here in my comfortable chair on my side of the room."
“Err, allow me, Madame.” Lucius offered, joining Narcissa outside. “Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.” Lucius called loudly, making a spectacle out of being helpful. What Lucius didn’t know though, was that at this moment, Ron, the mouse, was talking to the cats through the oven door, trying to help them.
“Why not? Jealous?” Harry let out a short laugh that morphed into a hiss of pain as Malfoy’s nails dug into his skin, sharp and surprising.
"Aaaaand?" Hermione probed vaguely. Harry shook his head.
“The more the merrier.” Harry said, getting a small vengeful happiness from watching Malfoy’s expression twitch as he processed the familiar words. Harry knew from the way his smile stretched to one side in a sneer that he remembered saying those words himself, the last time they’d spoken before he left for France.
The sitting room was a disaster. Clothes strewn about everywhere, chairs overturned, table upended, and things knocked from the shelves. Harry found his wand and began straightening things out.
“No! If you hate it so much, take them yourself!” Malfoy snapped, and his pheromones practically gushed out. Harry swallowed, his heart pounding at the scent of Malfoy’s disgust at the idea. He wanted to nestle into him, tell him he wasn’t serious, kiss him until he stopped being so angry. He settled for explaining why Malfoy’s suggestion wasn’t possible.
His cheeks were too warm, but he refused to admit to himself that he was blushing just from speaking to Malfoy. A soft touch drew his eyes, and he looked down to watch the tips of Malfoy’s fingers skim his thigh, as if he were trying to soothe Harry’s discomfort. Harry blurted out more.
He went to the sitting room, and paused, staring at the couch for only a moment before he went back to the bedroom, dragged the driest of his covers free, and collapsed onto the rather stiff sofa. He curled slightly in on himself, wrapped himself in the blanket, and closed his eyes, willing sleep to take him again.
bad, Ron? It does seem to be helping him. And maybe he can teach Harry more about having dominant pheromones?”
“You will do NO SUCH THING.” She snapped. Harry was stunned. He’d never seen her quite so angry before. “You will go through your heat WITHOUT potions, Mr. Potter! And you will cease taking the pheromone potion altogether. I HOPE for your sake, that your resistance to them wears down as you don’t take them, so that
“I don’t know.” He said quietly. They were the first words Malfoy had spoken directly to him all year, and Harry wanted to strangle him. He disliked that Malfoy’s irritation and moodiness were ruining his post-coital bliss. He might have taken a nap, but with the sour flavor of anger mixing through the room, Harry wanted this over and done with.
“Ogden’s.” He ordered from Neville’s wife at the bar, glad that she was a quiet type. She nodded, and poured his drink with a quiet smile. He offered her one of his rare, real smiles, and turned to let his fake smile stretch his lips as he observed his party. Ron was already well drunk, and Hermione was dotingly carting him around the room, rolling her eyes with good humor as he chatted far too loudly with every person they passed.
"About that, I'm er… sorry for going a bit off last night. I just wasn't expecting to be smothered all of a sudden." Ron said with an apologetic grimace. Harry waved it off. He wasn't upset over Ron's overreaction, merely that everyone was going to KNOW what he was, eventually.
“Somethings wrong with my potions.” Harry said without preamble, and only a cursory glance around to make sure the place was empty besides the pair of them.
Harry made it a week before he felt the telltale warming of his neck.
“I don’t want the house, or your money, Harry!” She stomped her way to the fireplace, wiping the angry tears from her lids. “I’ll be at mum’s. Come talk to me when you realize how stupid and crazy this is.”
“Yeah. But I’ve apparently, according to Pomfrey, built up a tolerance. So… I can’t take them anymore… Unless it’s an emergency.” Harry thinks back to the previous night, still unsure whether that would have constituted an emergency. He hadn’t even
“Congratulations, Potter.”
"Sorry, I didn't mean to… smell bad." Harry returned. Ron gave him a thin smile.
They continued the tour, doing Harry’s and Hermione’s in turn, before they were invited to Neville’s and then Dean’s, and Seamus’s. It seemed everyone was eager to show off their room and how perfect it was. Hermione repeated her explanation over and over as each boy wondered about how the rooms managed to be so personal.
He had dark brown eyes and wavy sandy blond hair. Harry realized with a bit of a shock that he was rather attractive. He had a strong jaw, and high cheekbones. His lashes were thick, his lips were pink, and he smelled delicious. Harry swallowed dryly.
.” Hermione bemoaned, but Ron gave him a look of understanding.
"Well… Did anything… HAPPEN?" She asked, staring at him intently. For a brief moment, Harry's heart thumped madly, and he was CERTAIN she knew.
"Fine, I'll accept that, but you still haven't forgiven me. Not really. I'm serious about this. It means a lot to me." Harry admitted, feeling slightly vulnerable with the words.
Ron had just come from Hermione’s room, a pleased smile on his face, and Harry felt as if he’d been caught. The feeling worsened when Ron’s eyes landed on him, and he looked suddenly angry.
“Maybe you should talk to him, Harry? He might have some insight about being a dominant that could help you. You’re still struggling with controlling your pheromone levels, right?”
“I don’t.” Harry confirmed.
He lifted his arms and wrapped them around Smith’s neck, pulling him in, being bold and not caring if they were in the middle of the corridor. At that moment he wanted nothing more than those soft-looking lips to meet his. They were warm, too. The kiss was hesitant, gentle, and Harry felt the hand that cupped his face, steadying them both.
Harry didn’t have the energy to be upset yet. All he felt was satisfied, warm, and sleepy.
“They won’t be a problem.” Harry assured her. He really had no idea. He didn’t even know how many Alphas there WERE in Hogwarts. He wondered at that, at how many Omegas there might be, also. He wasn’t sure he really wanted to know.
“Sorry. Just didn’t sleep well. No time for breakfast.” He lamented, checking the clock on the kitchen wall. He gave her a swift peck on the cheek, and headed for the Floo, dissolving into the flames with a handful of powder before he could even hear her farewell. It was one of the rare days when he could hardly look at her, for the rage twisting in his gut. Not at her, she’d done nothing wrong, of course. But at himself. The days had been coming more and more frequently where he couldn’t meet his own eyes in the mirror. Where Kingsley spoke to him about being too aggressive with his suspects. The days were becoming rare when he felt happy, and satisfied.
“His pheromones are softer this year. Like he’s trying to hold them back a bit better than he used to. And he’s being far more polite to everyone. I think he’s just like everyone else, Harry. He’s just trying to heal what’s hurt him, and apologize, in his own way, for his mistakes. I heard one boy call him evil, but that’s not true, is it? He was never evil. Just led into temptation by forces that were stronger than him.” Luna said, her face taking on a serious, somber cast that Harry had rarely seen on her. Her words rang true, and Harry nodded. They’d all come out of the war worse for wear, and Malfoy was no exception. Harry decided not to think too hard about whether Malfoy was a good or bad person. What had happened between them was no one’s fault, really. It would do him no good to worry over it.
“He’s not doing it now, though, is he?” Hermione asked in her most Prefect-y voice. Ron shook his head, looking almost sad.
No, Harry could barely smell it himself, there was no way Ron would be able to tell that he’d slept with Malfoy. He couldn’t even smell Ron’s scent coming from Hermione anymore, either. It would be fine, he told himself. Everything would be fine. And he would continue pretending Malfoy didn’t exist.
Another round of hushed whispers and exclamations of shock. The new Headmistress eyed them all sternly.
“You should take suppressant potions so you can’t smell me, that way this doesn’t keep happening.” Harry said matter-of-factly. At least, he was pretty sure he had. Malfoy looked even more furious when blazing grey eyes met his.
“Fuck…” Malfoy huffed finally, lowering them both to the floor. Harry winced as the motion pulled at the thick bulge still inside him, but found himself seated atop Malfoy, straddling his hips as the blond leaned his back against the wall, legs outstretched behind Harry. They were facing each other, and Harry felt his cheeks darken at the intimate position they found themselves stuck in.
“I see.” Was all he said, though, and Harry didn’t like the way his cunning eyes flickered between them. “Well, Potter, if you stop by Sunday, Scorpius will likely need a chew toy.”
"You seem to be living JUST fine without me, Potter. I could leave tomorrow, and you would forget I ever existed, just like you did last time. Boredom never killed anyone, so you'd be FINE." Malfoy argued, poking a finger into Harry's chest. Harry stared down into angry silver pools, his thoughts a hurricane of emotion and needs. Malfoy was provoking him, physically touching him, and TRYING to upset him. Harry knew he wanted him to lose control and get physical back, so that in the aftermath, they could blame the situation, not themselves. But it would still be adultery. He'd hoped to just talk things through with Malfoy, and then have words with Ginny, but… clearly Malfoy didn't want or need to talk. The angry challenge his eyes held was all the invitation Harry needed to know that if he was unfaithful to Ginny, Malfoy would forgive him. He'd be setting one piece of his life on fire, for just the possibility that Malfoy would actually reciprocate after he'd gotten what he wanted.
At the bell, Malfoy was first out of the room, out of his chair so fast one might have thought he’d been sitting on thumbtacks, and out the door quicker than anyone had even gathered their books. Harry’s eyes followed after him until Hermione spoke.
“I think I’ll have another drink.” Harry excused himself, kissing Ginny’s hair as a brief goodbye, so she’d be forced not to follow him. He heard her start up a conversation with Malfoy as he turned away. She was trying. So hard. He felt bad for not being able to give her more. But really, she’d been the one to ask him to get married. He wasn’t sure what she expected, but was certain it had included more than he’d given her.
Malfoy’s fingers were suddenly squeezing his leg, a bit too tightly, and Harry heard the angry growl, smelled the possessive wash of pheromones Malfoy released. He looked up and found Malfoy staring at him, face dark and furious.
for him that came with it. The way his mind had gone on vacation while Malfoy satisfied him. Had that been on purpose? Harry was suddenly furious at the thought that Malfoy had brainwashed him into having sex. Even if it had been terrific. And comforting. And refreshing.
Harry took a refreshing breath of fresh air, and could only detect the faintest hint of Alpha lingering on him. It was as good as he could hope for. He counted it as a win and went to join Ron and Hermione.
“Er… Are we?” Harry asked, certain that he and Malfoy had not said so much as a single word to each other publicly. Even in their group Charms project, they avoided interacting directly.
to want.
“Weren’t you taught about this
“Mr. Malfoy, join this group here!’ He ordered shortly, before moving on to group the remaining stragglers to underwhelming groups. For the first time in a week, Harry found his eyes sliding to look at Malfoy. Grey eyes met his, and he took in the hard, almost angry expression. Grey eyes flickered to glare at Flitwick, but there really was no help for it. He gathered his things and joined his new group in silence. He slammed his things down at their table and Harry noticed that he was refusing to look at any of them. At
“Sorry.” Malfoy responded without a trace of remorse in his voice. “I’m close to a rut, so…” He shrugged, but then his eyes narrowed in suspicion. “After this, I should probably avoid you until it’s over, just in case.”
"No, I'm a
“No.” Harry denied, “I have nothing to say to him. And I don’t want any of his advice.”
“Oh thank
“Maybe we should talk inside…” Hermione said, wringing her hands. Harry followed her in, and flinched when Ron slammed it shut behind them.
“Of course you weren’t paying attention. And you probably haven’t done any reading to understand what being an Omega actually means, have you?” Malfoy asked, looking at him with a sort of sad humor. The irritation was no longer burning his nose, and instead, the spicy scent of Malfoy was almost playful. Harry wanted to kiss him, to taste that flavor on his tongue.
“Here. Hold him.” Malfoy urged, lifting his son, and pushing him on Harry before the brunet could deny him. His arms automatically wrapped around the tiny bundle, and he began rocking, smiling and cooing to Scorpius. Malfoy watched him, arms still slightly outstretched, as if Harry might drop him. Harry met nervous grey eyes, and snickered.
He let himself cry for only a few short minutes before he angrily dashed the tears away with the back of his knuckles, rubbed violently into his eyes until he saw stars, and forced himself to stand. He had a shower, cold, quick, and efficient, rinsing the sweat and leftover traces of orgasm away. He went back to his room, and looked at the bed, damp from his sweat, a puddle of his release spilled across the blankets. He groaned and dug through his trunk for his slippers. He’d just have to go ask the elves for a clean set.
“I had to take a contraceptive potion.” He admitted, and pushed his way past Draco, into the bedroom. “And… I didn’t mind. It’s not like you
“I never knew you were…” He trailed off, eyes darting around the hall suddenly wary of others listening in. “Nevermind. Talk later?” Ron asked, eyes hopeful.
When Harry picked up his robes from the floor, he found the small emergency potion in the pocket, and wondered if that had been ‘an emergency’. It had been surprising, sudden, and rather violent, but… He’d liked it. He’d
The buttons went easily, as did the shirt, robes, and tie. Harry was vaguely aware of crashing noises, of a hand leaving his body to flick locking charms at the door, and then the wand, and everything else, was thrown to the floor. Harry wasn’t sure when he’d gotten naked, or
Harry noticed Ron’s eyes on him more throughout the day, the flaring of his nostrils as he breathed in what HAD to be Harry’s pheromones. Harry discreetly sniffed himself, but couldn't smell anything. He was a little sweaty, but otherwise he smelled the same. He found that he could smell Ron, though. It was strange. A tangy scent that tickled his nostrils and made him want to lean in and take a deep breath. He noticed how tall Ron was, how broad his shoulders had gotten. They were resting in Hermione’s room, studying (or pretending to study, in Harry’s case), when Harry suddenly made the connection.
he’d grabbed handfuls of pale hair and skin, but he was fully aware of the moment Draco Malfoy shoved him down on the couch and covered Harry’s body with his own. Harry whimpered at the feeling. It felt so
“Wouldn’t that be a concern for Professor Slughorn?” She looked a bit confused, and Harry gritted his teeth. He really hated talking about this.
He sighed. He couldn't be angry at her. Just like he couldn't stay mad at Ginny, or Ron, or Draco.
“Harry… You smell… like…” Ron suddenly sat up, and shook his head, laughing. “Nevermind. It’s stupid. Anyway, glad you’re alright.” He looked away, and Harry noticed the tightness at the corners of his eyes, as if he wasn’t convinced by his own words. Harry felt his own lips part. Suddenly, he wanted to tell his friends, to tell them what he was suffering through, to warn them that he might be testy for the next week. He clamped his lips shut, and faced Professor Flitwick, trying once more to pay attention to the lecture.
“Fuck, open a window, ‘Mione.” Ron gasped, and Harry looked back up to see Ron grimacing, as if HE could smell it, too. Hermione hurried to the bedroom and threw the window open, casting air freshening charms on her way.
"Well yeah." Ron shrugged. "We're all used to it, though."
Whatever Ron had been about to say was lost to the sudden understanding that breaks across his face, and Ron leaned back slightly, but was still close enough to whisper.
?” Ron begged. Harry sighed.
Harry felt his face go scarlet at the insinuation that he’d wank so hard he’d hurt himself. Madam Pomfrey didn’t give him time to feel properly horrified, though. “I’m sure Professor McGonagall will be able to tactfully excuse you from class for the next week.”
As he popped open the last fastening, and his erection sprang free, he shoved parchment, quills, and desk clutter clattering to the ground, pushed Malfoy down onto his back, and leaned over him. He shoved expensive fabric out of his way as he pressed his bare sex to Malfoy. He groaned, and paused, enjoying the warmth of skin against his, and already feeling too close to finishing. He pulled his wand from his disheveled robes, and cast a quick, wordless charm, one he’d learned before he’d even thought to marry Ginny, one he hadn’t used since the last time he’d been so close to Draco. Malfoy gasped at the sudden cool wetness, and Harry smirked, dropped his wand to the desk, and held his cock steady as he lined himself up.
He suffered another round of diagnostics, and prodding before he was finally allowed to break free. He was fairly certain she would have kept him longer if he hadn’t had a class to get to.
He was glad when no one else mentioned his appetite, and as the first years were led to the dormitories by prefects, Harry found his eyes travelling across the hall once more, to find Draco Malfoy.
Harry watched as Malfoy huffed, and the smell of his irritation grew heavier. He swallowed, fighting the urge to stand when Malfoy did, to follow him as he left without a word.
"No! Not at all! I'm just saying… I'd understand if you had. Or, if you want to, I dunno, actually try being friends with Malfoy. I think… I can't believe I'm about to say this, but… I think he might ACTUALLY be good for you." Hermione looked apologetic, begging him not to be cross with her.
“Did you want the hat, Harry?” Lindy asked, snagging herself one of the chocolate frogs.
each other. We have for seven years. Please elaborate on how exactly I can approach the subject? ‘
The dark-haired male suddenly surged to his feet, his robes billowing angrily as he began to pace. Lucius remained where he was, eyes trained on the floor as he listened to the rustle of Voldemort’s movements. Sweat trickled down the back of his neck, his heart pounding in his ears.
“Of course.” The blond frowned curiously at the Gryffindor. “You want to go ice skating? Seriously?”
“You goddamn
He knew he was cutting it close; Pansy was going to scold him for being late to class no doubt. Truthfully, Draco couldn’t be arsed to care. He’d woken rather… abruptly that morning, from a sleep that had been minimal. Since his change, Draco had not been required to rest as often as his wizard body had once needed. The stress brought on by Potter’s presence yesterday however was enough for an exhausted Slytherin to retire to bed. What little sleep he managed to achieve had been plagued with vivid dreams of the brunet, many of which involved Draco indulging in the very strong urge to bite him. Needless to say when Draco woke that morning it was to the undying thirst he had hoped would have diminished. He’d been so sure that keeping his distance from Potter would work… until the bloody asshole had decided to raid his dreams.
you. The bond the two of you will share will be unbreakable. Sharing blood is, not to sound cliché, the
mistake, Draco, and then you’re fucked.”
—door.”
“Ron and I snuck in here during second year. We were convinced that you were the Heir of Slytherin,” Potter chuckled.
“No.”
Hermione stared at him sardonically. “Oh
Draco’s blood was humming unsettlingly in his veins; he had been too close. Why on earth did he have to antagonise? He knew what Potter’s presence did to him…
“Indeed.” Malfoy lowered himself into the chair across the desk from Harry, eyeing the boy carefully and noting the way Potter hesitated to meet his gaze. “Would you like me to look over it for you?”
“Hmm?” Draco blinked.
Malfoy snorted. “Please, Potter, who
, the wand has already begun to flake!”
Dumbledore steepled his fingers and gazed intriguingly at the Slytherin. Draco felt agitation well within him as he remained beneath the old man’s scrutinising stare. The annoyance he felt due to the fact that Severus had discussed him with the Headmaster without his knowledge grated on Draco’s nerves. He was no longer a child; anything his godfather had to discuss about him could have been done in his presence—not for him to be summoned like a deviant student after discussion had already taken place.
“I’ll email you, Granger,” Malfoy said, nodding in her direction.
“Since he didn’t have the decency to admit what he was doing, what am I supposed to think, Ron? He’s lied to me since the first day we started talking. What am I meant to base our relationship on?”
The brunet snorted a chuckle. “I guess it wouldn’t be right unless there was constant drama in my life.” He allowed his head to fall back against the back of the chair, his gaze on the ceiling. “That’s probably the reason why I do love the bloody idiot—the universe wouldn’t be happy if I’d fallen for someone normal.”
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. “Pfft... no,” he said, avoiding eye contact.
He knew it was stupid. He knew refusing Pansy’s blood was a foolish thing to do. Even still, he was unable to fight the constant crave for Harry that wilfully shoved his conscience aside. After all, since Draco had accepted his attraction, there was no need to deny himself from the brunet’s presence now, was there?
Harry rolled his eyes. “I think I’ll miss.”
Harry considered this for a moment and decided to give his friend a break. “Yeah, fair enough,” he replied. “I promise to explain everything, alright? But it’s really not anything I want people overhearing.”
“Do you mind if I join you two in your dormitory?” Hermione asked.
… Draco thought with a sneer as he headed for the Entrance Hall.
“Not really,” Draco commented as he hit ‘reply’. “What about you?”
“Because he’s being an arse,” Pansy replied simply. “I had asked him if he wanted to come today but he didn’t want to lower himself to our level.”
“And you’ll need all the time you can get,” Hermione warned. She glared at Harry as well for good measure. “I will not be taking notes for you two, that’s not fair.”
She’d discovered Tumblr a year ago from a friend via Facebook whose posts would show up on her newsfeed. After clicking on the link and having a look at what her friend did, Hermione’s excitement grew to the point where she had made one herself. For the first few weeks, Hermione had become obsessed with the website, following new people, reblogging posts, and discovering she wasn’t the only one to do certain things. It wasn’t until she realised she had mountains of homework to do and only a week left of holidays to do it in, Hermione had regretfully decided to back off slightly and save her blogging for her free time.
“Stops them from getting their hopes up,” Harry smiled easily. “She’s just protecting you.”
Pansy snorted, glancing at her friend in amusement. “For a Slytherin, Draco, you’re blissfully ignorant at times.”
“Is this how you plan on becoming my friend? Annoying me to death?”
Neville brightened immediately, his burners bursting into life. Percy threw Hermione a cautious glare.
Hermione, who was the first to order, acknowledged the brunette’s smirk with one of her own, her eyes darting to the blond who was staring fixatedly at the coffee machine.
“Anything sweet for you, handsome?” Pansy asked.
So why was this information not making Draco feel any better?
“Huh?”
“Just breathe, Potter,” Draco advised, lining himself up with Potter’s awaiting entrance.
Harry snorted. “Not you, never you.” He glanced at his watch, surprised to see that he and the blond had been conversing for over twenty minutes. “Good thing we settled this when we did, we’re late for Transfiguration.”
The elder Malfoy could
The female winced and was not at all surprised when Harry wrenched his arm out of her grasp.
“Did you hear that, Draco? Isn’t it wonderful my sign has been so successful?”
Hermione turned to the red head beside her. “You
“This doesn’t mean you win,” Draco retorted, smoothing down his clothes. “I will find a way.”
When Draco next glanced up, Potter was receiving a whispered reprimand from Ron, his three flames flaring with each jab of an accusing candle, like a finger to the chest. A look of guilt passed over Potter’s face and he rubbed the back of his neck with his left hand.
“Ooh! Are we allowed to dress you this time? Please, please, please?” Fred insisted.
“Things won’t immediately go back to how there were,” Pansy reminded him gently. “You apologised, Draco, there’s nothing more you can do. Give him the time he needs to adjust.”
Pansy laughed softly, taking Draco’s hand and squeezing it in reassurance. “If anything, his noble Gryffindor heart won’t let you do that alone…”
“If you would just let me—”
“Cascades of books!” Percy added, unable to hide the relief on his face as Draco turned around to follow them back down the stairs.
Malfoy quirked an eyebrow. “Really, Potter, I thought you were a wizard?”
,” Draco interrupted, his smirk growing on his lips. “I’m
The blond shook himself.
“I said no, Potter,” he said, folding his arms indignantly.
Malfoy complied, and Harry felt himself arching up off the couch at the sensation of teeth scraping his skin roughly, a delicious moan falling from his lips.
Pansy frowned at her best friend.
“Perhaps it’s time to see just how compatible Malfoy and I really are,” Harry said softly, starting over to the male staircase.
“Is that so?” Potter said, flicking his hair off his face. “I’ll keep that in mind for the future hormonal episodes I might experience.”
Hermione rolled her eyes at her friend’s reply but felt a sense of satisfaction as he signed off MSN. She wondered what it was that had him so captivated—after all, he was used to having, although limited, access to a computer and the internet. He’d probably stumbled across a new site and was getting a little
“I beg to differ,” Malfoy responded, moving swiftly. His lips descended on Harry’s and the stunned Gryffindor froze, hands coming up to Malfoy’s shoulders.
The brunet rocked against him, hips undulating as his lips searched desperately for Draco’s, melting into the kiss they shared. His arse was so full, so full of
His subconscious voiced.
The room was lined with hundreds of flickering candles, their dancing flames casting a beautiful, gentle light over an array of pillows and cushions as they lay in elegant piles. In a space cleared before a large open fire was a white, fluffy, and very inviting rug.
“Forget that you’re a wizard?”
“Well it hasn’t been for that long,” Harry replied awkwardly. “I started thinking I might like guys during the summer holidays but I... I wondered if it might have been a phase or something. Since finding Tumblr though, I know now that I really do prefer males.”
“Draco? Darling?”
“Don’t pretend you’re not desperate to hear this as well, Hermione.”
“I wish,” Draco muttered. “What do you want, Pansy?”
“I wouldn’t be surprised if the entirety of Hogwarts heard me just then.” He laughed softly, provoking a chuckle from the blond.
Draco’s eyes parted and his lips fell open in a small silent gasp. He stared around in amazement, taking in the hundreds and hundreds of books that lined the walls, displayed impressively on massive shelves. Rows seemed to stretch on forever, disappearing into shadows that the sunlight could not reach. And all the while Draco could feel his excitement growing. His love for books was second to none, and here Harry had brought him, introducing him to the one safe-place he figured would make Draco happy.
“Typical,” Harry scoffed.
“Thag you, Pansy.”
Draco’s subconscious inquired.
of him; there was no denying the twisted stench of fear and resignation that fell from the Gryffindor in great bursts. The usual hint of lust and excitement that the blond had once smelt in Harry was no longer present. Instead a gruesome combination of burning terror and sickening submission streamed through his nose like rancid smoke.
“No.” Potter lifted his gaze once more, holding Draco’s eyes with a stare so suddenly penetrating he felt a tremor of fear trickle down his spine. “Unless there is someone else who knows that you came
“You have a Facebook?” Harry sniggered. “I haven’t found you on there.”
“By being honest with him, Draco. He can’t avoid you forever. You’ll get your chance to make things right,” Pansy said.
As soon as the door to Harry’s room was closed, Hermione began just as Harry opened his mouth.
“And you have been on heat suppressant potions ever since? Every heat?”
“So… why don’t you want to take suppressants?” He asked, not daring to mention the way Malfoy’s warm hands were resting comfortably on his thighs now that he’d relaxed again.
He slowed his steps and walked quieter as he approached the nursery, listening as he walked, to the soft, melodic sound of that familiar voice, quietly reading a book aloud. He stepped into the room, pleased that he'd managed to sneak up on the blond. He sat in front of a cradle, his back to the door, his warm voice filling the room like a bewitching fog.
When they were both spent, Harry took a moment to catch his breath, resting his face on white skin and he huffed in oxygen. He felt Mafloy’s soft chuckle under his head before the sound reached air.
“Harry’s amazing with babies, isn’t he?” Ginny said from next to him surprising Harry with her presence. He hadn’t realized she’d approached.
Harry punched the button for the Atrium on the old elevator wall, and stood to the side, clearly leaving room for Malfoy to stand away from him. He rather liked the feeling of shoving the button in as hard as he could. It was much more satisfying when he was upset than politely telling the lift what floor he wanted. Malfoy entered the lift, checked the button, and stood aside, taking the space Harry had left him. As the grate closed, and the walls began to slide past, they stood, surrounded by a heavy silence. Harry felt the same lump in his throat and shortness of breath as he’d felt when he’d seen the wedding invitation. He wanted to say something, but there was nothing to say. He refused to exchange banal pleasantries with Malfoy in lieu of real conversation. With the air heavy with unspoken words, Harry couldn’t help recalling what he liked to think of as ‘the first incident’. The beginning of his downward slide, and the last time he and Malfoy had really fought.
Harry nodded.
"Whatever it takes? Fine. I don't hate you, you're forgiven. See yourself out." Malfoy stood, and was almost to the door when Harry caught him.
Malfoy inside him, but with soft lips surrounding the head of his cock, he couldn’t form the words to beg for it. All he could do was moan and arch and grab platinum hair. Malfoy’s fingers were long and slender as he slid them into Harry’s slick entrance, and Harry let out a groan of satisfaction at finally having the void inside of him filled. It wasn’t enough, but it was a start. They weren’t as filling as he needed, but they were massaging the best part, and with the mouth on top, Harry found himself at the peak in mere moments. The feel of a warm tongue lapping his climax up made him shiver, but when he looked down to see it, Malfoy was done, his head coming back up, his hips settling between Harry’s thighs. With just that sight, Harry was too hot again. He was eager for more. Eager for Malfoy to complete him. Teeth nipped at his neck as Malfoy slid slowly in, and Harry moaned, squirming, trying to take more of him in, trying to make him go faster, deeper.
“He’s beautiful.” Harry said, reaching out a hand to brush hair from his face. “He’s so small. Was he born early?”
Harry was getting much better at knowing when he was doing it, and had even managed to stop himself from scent-bombing all over class when he got frustrated in potions. A bit more embarrassing had been Ron smothering him in pheromones and trying to coerce him into doing stupid things. He’d gladly gotten on his knees the first time, before his own pheromones had overpowered Ron’s ability to speak, and Hermione, who had been standing at the ready to stun either if it got out of hand, had been quick with the windows and air charms. By the end of the week, he found it easier to think through the fog that Ron’s Alpha pheromones caused in his brain. He steadfastly refused to look for Malfoy, to even peek in his direction. He didn’t allow himself to get close enough to pick out his smell from the cluster of scents, and he absolutely did not entertain the idea of testing his newly discovered ability to make the lesser Alphas stop in their tracks and completely freeze under the weight of his pheromones on Malfoy. If he was honest with himself, he was a little terrified that it
“I thought these were your friends, Potter?” Malfoy’s sarcastic drawl brought Harry’s mind abruptly back to the present. The summer night air was warm around them, and he could hear the muffled noises of the party behind the door at his back, the soft drizzle of rain just beyond the cover they stood under. “Still keeping secrets from them? Why? ashamed?”
"I wanted to apologize." Harry started. Malfoy's face flickered with disbelief, and irritation, but he nodded for Harry to continue.
Harry snuck into History of Magic, and slid into his seat next to Hermione as casually as he was able. His red face and hard breathing from running halfway across the castle may have ruined it, but besides a few snickers, no one said anything.
“I… I don’t want to…” He couldn’t bring himself to say the words, and Pomfrey seemed to take pity on him for a brief moment.
“I can’t do this.” Harry suddenly announced. “You may have told your wife, but I haven’t. I can’t hurt her like that, Malfoy. And don’t YOU dare say anything to her.” Harry warned, before he yanked the door open, and went back into the party. He took refuge in his fake smile, and the people that acted as a barrier between him and Malfoy. He knew Malfoy wouldn’t say another word about their past. Not with so many people. Not even to be cruel. Not with a child that might be affected by the outcome.
Hermione eyed him. A suspicious look on her face that made Harry instantly wary. It was NEVER good when she got that look.
“You’re being incredibly calm about all of this, Potter… I was half expecting you to lose your head when I bit you. Or after we’d mated the first time… Well, I suppose you did actually kick me out of the bed…” Draco trailed off, and Harry shrugged, smirking at the memory. That had been its own kind of satisfying.
“Thank you, but no. We’re fine.” Harry lied, doing his level best to convince her, standing so he could attempt to flee.
The next day, Harry visited Pomfrey, and disturbed, went to relay the information to his friends.
“You don’t want to go just once more?” The temptation was breathed against his throat, and Harry shook his head violently.
I think he’s trying much harder this year, to be who he wants to be.” Luna finally said, cryptically. She gave Harry a smile.
“Why couldn’t he just send it with the owl?” Harry grumbled, pulling on his boots, and running a hand through his messy hair in a futile attempt to tame it.
. Malfoy looked half-feral as he stomped his way over to where Harry was standing, and Harry felt as if he might collapse. His legs felt weak, and his breathing was too fast, and Malfoy was too far away. But then Malfoy was right there, grabbing him, dragging him a few steps down the hall, and pulling them through the door of a classroom. Harry stumbled through, and grabbed a handful of Draco’s robes to steady himself. He could still feel Draco’s anger, and with his mind nearly mush from the battle of Alpha pheromones he’d been subjected to, Harry moved on instinct. He flattened his hands against Malfoy’s chest and leaned up to kiss him, hoping his gesture cooled Malfoy’s fury.  It seemed to have the exact opposite effect of calming him down. He grabbed Harry, and kissed him violently, shoving him into the wall in a way that mimicked the position he’d been in with Zacharias. This, however, was not a gentle kiss while surrounded by a delicious scent. This was angry, forceful, and so thick with the sharp scent of Malfoy’s pheromones that it nearly burned Harry’s tongue to taste it. Everything about Malfoy burned. His scent, his flavor, and his body. They burned into Harry and Harry clung to it, wondering how on earth he could have ever imagined Smith could be a half decent replacement. There was no replacement for this. There was no substituting how quickly Malfoy got rid of their clothes, or how tightly he held Harry. He gave Harry just what he needed, and he didn’t wait. He didn’t ask. He didn’t hesitate. Harry could taste in the air what Malfoy wanted, what he needed, and Harry knew Malfoy could discern the same of him. He knew just what Harry needed, and wasted no time giving it to him. He touched him, hands claiming the skin the Smith had dared to touch, teeth warning Harry never to let anyone else kiss those lips, and pheromones drowning Harry under a tidal wave of jealousy, possession, and desire.
“Oh, yeah.” Ron made a face. “Malfoy.”
“She refused to believe things were over… I filed the paperwork for divorce after she left. I don’t think she’ll want to speak to me after the owl delivers the copies for her to sign…” Harry mused, recalling the way the elderly wizard who’d helped him through the single horrible roll of parchment had explained the process as Draco stood next to him. A light touch ruffled through his hair, and he looked up to meet the soft silver gaze. He looked as if he shared Harry’s heartbreak, and Harry leaned into the touch, finding it both strange in its newness, and enjoyable. Before he could grow used to the gentle sensation, the fingers tightened, and the silver gaze seemed to harden a bit. Harry winced a bit at the sudden change of tone, but said nothing as Draco leaned in.
“So you’re going into heat soon, so why not just… do this again?” Harry thought.
By the time his workday ended, Harry had nearly forgotten about his business at the Leaky Cauldron, and was eager to at least escape the seeming neverending buzz of paper whizzing into his office with new memos. He rushed through the corridors, taking the less populated route, knowing the main lifts would be so crowded, it would be faster to take the long route, and the out-of-the-way lifts. It was also a perk that he hardly ever saw anyone going this way, and didn’t have to pretend he’d enjoyed his day trapped there with them. He’d almost made it, when his senses told him something was off. He was being followed. He stopped, but before he could pull his wand out, his stalker spoke up.
“No. I’m worried you’ll spout something personal, too loudly, just to ruin my life.” Harry retorted. Malfoy gave him a look then. A long look. One that made Harry feel like squirming. It was a look that said Malfoy was reading him. It was strange, knowing Malfoy could read him easier than even Hermione could. Malfoy had seen him as no one else had. He’d known what was inside Harry before even Harry had.
“You’re welcome, Harry. You did seem surprised, though. Perhaps a wrackspurt got into your head while you were with him, and made you forget?” She suggested. Harry gave her a long, considering look. He knew she was an Omega. He trusted her, even if she was a bit odd sometimes.
“Actually… I think I’ll go see Pomfrey.” Harry stood from their table, ignoring the glances the children eating lunch around them cast him, and hurried from the Great Hall. He jogged up the stairs, and nearly burst into the infirmary.
The Hall slowly filled with students, and Harry found himself seated amongst an eager, excited group of Gryffindors. Those closest to him were his friends, but those farther down the table kept shouting, trying to get his attention, or tell him about themselves. Harry ignored most of it, pretending he was deaf to all but those near him. Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Dean, Seamus, and even Dennis Creevey sat around him, nearly like a barrier, keeping him neatly cushioned from the attention seeking acquaintances and strangers. Harry shared a short conversation with Dennis, and they shared a sad smile over a memory of Collin. Harry, in a strange burst of emotion, wondered to himself if Dennis needed an older brother to look out for him now, and vowed silently to himself to keep an eye on the younger boy. He was a sixth year now, but still seemed tiny for his age, thin, short, and the dark circles under his eyes made Harry want to pat his back and tell him everything would be alright.
He tore his eyes away, and looked back into Malfoy’s face. A mistake. Malfoy pushed him backward, and kicked the door shut forcefully. He grabbed a handful of Harry’s robes with one hand, the other sliding around to grab a handful of his hair, and suddenly, his mouth was there, on Harry’s. Harry wouldn’t call it a kiss. It was far too violent. Too invasive. Malfoy’s tongue was in his mouth, and he could
“Potter. Could I have a word?” Zacharias Smith spoke with sure even words, and Harry nodded before he’d really processed the words. His thoughts were far too fuzzy. He rubbed his forehead as if it might help, and followed Smith around the corner, to a less frequented corridor near the Transfiguration classrooms. Harry could smell Smith now, and realized he’d never been alone, or close enough to really single out his pheromones from the crowd before. He smelled cool and minty, and when it was just the two of them, with Smith standing just a short distance away, the scent of him made Harry’s head spin.
“Harry, is something wrong?” Ginny was there, blocking his way, and Harry forced his smile wider.
“Yes brother?”
James and Albus were chasing each other through Hermione’s legs, while Draco watched them carefully. He hoped their faithful horse wouldn’t mind too much.
“Neighborhood!” Hagrid yelled before gravity got the best of him and he sat back down on the sidewalk.
“Sir. Sir? You are most fortunate we happened along.” Fred said by way of introduction.
“Now look, kids, if I said magic carpet, magic carpet it’s gonna be. And it’s gonna stop for passengers…right…here.” Harry explained to the kittens happily, drawing an “X” in the ground with a claw.
“That’s a magic carpet?” Draco asked not entirely sure what Potter meant, as he didn’t see any carpets in the truck.
Harry saw his moment and leapt with a battle cry yeowl at the butler underneath him. His claws scratched at the man’s rear end and did some damage to his back as well as Potter jumped across the man’s body to guard the door. He got up on his hind legs and pushed the door shut before turning to face the blond man with a smirk.
“Oh, an Expelliarmus-y,” Scorpius copied Harry’s words from earlier.
"Oh I will. I hope yours is lumpy."
Harry stood by the door to their home with his hand resting on the handle of his suitcase. He chuckled to himself and looked at his watch, shaking his head. Draco was debating adding a few more “outfits” to his suitcase that was still in their room. This was the main reason why Harry had just rented them an entire private island for their getaway. With the island being part of the Wizard BnB network, they could arrive whenever they wanted so long as they were there during their reservation. Just when Harry was about to call for Draco, he heard the sound of a suitcase being carried down the stairs. Draco blushed as he saw the loving yet exasperated smile on Harry’s face.
Draco’s voice was dripping with sass as Harry’s head came up out of the water. He gasped as the slowly setting sunlight fell upon the dark-haired man. Harry’s wet hair had a slight auburn tint to it in the orange light. His emerald green eyes sparkled in the light from the water and Draco’s breath caught in his throat. Before he could stop himself Draco’s hand was outstretched and stroking Harry’s face gently. His goal had been for them to watch the sunset together in the ocean… but with the way Harry was illuminated Draco felt he might lose control and be rolling around in the sand with Harry before the sun went down.
that spicy, cutting scent. It burned his nose and filled his head, and his tongue trailed out, seeking more. The hand in his hair wasn’t
“Gee, thanks so much.” Draco muttered. Harry laughed, but it turned into a sigh.
“Would you stop that!” Ron finally snapped and Harry looked up, shocked. Ron was glaring at Malfoy, not him, though, and Harry felt a wave of relief. He wasn’t the only one Malfoy was making uncomfortable, then. “If you lay it on any thicker, you’ll break my nose! We’re
He watched the sorting without really seeing it, and after McGonagall had given her speech and the food appeared before them, Harry dug in eagerly. He hadn’t eaten since a bit of toast that morning, and felt suddenly ravenous. For a while longer, he didn’t think about what the increased hunger might mean, or the slight trickle of sweat that trailed down his neck might threaten. He focused on his potatoes, on his steak and kidney pie. He guzzled down three glasses of pumpkin juice, and ate half a dish of pudding himself.
"Yeah." Harry answered, rolling his eyes. Just what he needed to talk about. NOT.
"I'm not leaving until you forgive me." He warned, glaring at Malfoy. "Whatever it takes, I don't want to leave with you still hating me." Harry knew it was a dangerous offer. He could demand anything as penance. The evil smirk on his face said he knew it, too.
“I thought I wasn’t supposed to take any more suppressants?” Harry asked, only a little sarcastically.
He came twice before he gave up and tore himself from the bed, stumbling to the lavatory. He rummaged in the cabinet and snatched out the dark blue potion, downing it in two gulps. The heat receded slowly, and he sank to the floor, eyes closed, a sob hitching in his throat. He hated this. Hated that he felt like he wasn’t really himself. Hated that he was back home and everything is still terrible. He’d still survived a war. He still had nightmares. He was still an Omega.
“Well? It was an accident?” He prodded. Harry nodded.
Harry let his lips trail sideways, licking the pale solid line of his jaw, feeling the scrape of nearly invisible blond stubble against his tongue. His throat tasted of salty sweat and the spicy essence of his Alpha. It nearly burned his tongue with how sharp it was, and Harry tasted lower. His chest was less intensely flavored, more like the cinnamon Harry had come to associate with him. The thin whie scars that Harry’s tongue traced were barely discernible, his nipples were a small hard nib of resistance that slid under his tongue, and Harry teased him with a nip of his own teeth, making Malfoy his and thrust his hips upward. Harry groaned at that, distracted from his tasting by the wave of heat that surged through him with that movement. When it ebbed, and he looked back at Draco, he knew he needed to taste his mouth again, the flavor of them mixed there.
“Morning!”
wanted this! I swear to god if you panic every single morning you wake up with me in your bed, I’m going to just avoid you altogether.” Malfoy threatened. Harry barely heard him as he rushed into the bathroom, and threw open the medicine cabinet hidden behind the mirror. He yanked out potions as he heard footsteps following him, and swallowed quickly, shoving the empty jars back into the cabinet to be magically refilled the next morning. He slammed the mirror closed just as Draco rounded the corner, and Harry turned on the tap, running cold water to splash on his face.
“And when was the last time you allowed your heat to pass without the use of potion suppressants?”
So he did all he could to trudge forward, every day, keeping what little happiness he had grasped firmly in both hands. Ginny, for all he wasn’t in love with her anymore, was still someone he loved. Sunday dinners with the Weasley family were always happy. Ron and Hermione had a baby now, and he enjoyed holding her.
“Well! It appears that across the
to taste him. He lowered his head to Malfoy’s lips and tasted them. They were soft, warm, and tasted a bit salty. His earlier release, Harry realized. The thought filled him with a possessive warmth. Malfoy tasted like him, like he was Harry’s.
“Oh.” Was all he could manage to say. Malfoy looked away, and took a breath of the still air. “I’m sorry. How did it happen?” Harry asked, his anger immediately doused as guilt and sympathy took its place.
“I suppose that’s normal, too? Wanting to cheer you up?” Harry asked, fighting another blush.
. It almost bothered him, that after the horrible, freakish night of bliss Malfoy was just as unwilling to meet his gaze as Harry was.
“I can still smell him on you, but you don’t need scum like Malfoy.” Smith’s words were spoken in a whisper against Harry’s lips. “I’ll take care of you.”
“‘Party etiquette’, Potter? Really? What, you’re worried I’ll ask some embarrassing question, or spill my drink on someone?” He sneered. Harry mimicked his mocking expression.
“Harry, are you alright?”
The soft whisper startled him, and he spun in his seat to see Draco coming through the door of Scorpius’ room.
“Sorry, I got stopped by Luna.” He said, hoping they’d not ask questions about his still-damp hair, or in Ron’s case, the scent of cinnamon still lingering around him. Ron gave him another look, and Harry knew he was testing the pheromones. To his relief, Ron looked convinced, and Harry was thankful that Ron was only interested in women. The scent of Malfoy was getting stronger, and he sincerely hoped Ron wouldn’t be able to tell.
“She reckons I’ve done it to myself, with the potions. Says it’ll probably be a couple months, and in the meantime, I’ll just have to suffer a heat roulette every day.” Harry griped, far too hungry to mention what she’d said about keeping an Alpha in his bedside drawer for convenience. He bolted down lunch in record time, nearly matching Ron’s appetite. Hermione pointedly kept her eyes on her own plate, and Harry, feeling a bit bold, took a deeper breath, taking in the pheromones around him. He could smell it again. Stronger now. Ron and Hermione were
“Probably confused about
He forced his fingers to close over the glass door knob. The edges of the rosette shape dug into his palm, and he twisted, pushing the door open, and peered inside.
