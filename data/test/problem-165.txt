“Then we got too creative with the passcode, and we’ll have to think of a slightly less creative one. But we’ll still have to make sure it’s a word she would only think to try fairly late, something related to the mystery, or…”
“Right, but what kind of roll?”
“I need to take some blood,” he explained.
As soon as she had finished the thought, Holly returned to the hospital wing with a tense-looking Severus.
“Doesn’t feel right when I don’t even know what’s going on with you.”
“Yes, thanks for pointing that out, you knob. There’s got to be something, Draco, there
“Oh Harry, they’re
She stared at him for a long moment before she gave a silent nod.
“Sod off then,” Harry snapped. He was furious at himself, his heart was breaking, he wanted to hide under his desk as to never have to face Malfoy again, and now Ron was failing in his best-friend-support duties, because he was supposed to
“Whose do you think that is?” Draco whispers in Harry’s ear, his breath brushing Harry’s neck. The sensation it brings forth is peculiar, and Harry can’t quite place it. It’s like he’s suddenly ticklish there, but at the same time he isn’t, and he knows perfectly well that doesn’t make any sense, but he can’t describe it any better than that.
“Alright,” he said and pushed his notes to the side so she could come and look at them. She did so, tucking her chin-length black hair behind her ear as a look of concentration appeared on her face.
“May we come in?” Potter asked, still the epitome of politeness.
“In your dreams!” Draco hisses. “But we could play Wizard’s chess, like Weasley and Theo.”
When Draco opened his eyes and scrutinized the unwelcome visitor, he realized that Harry was no longer entirely steady on his feet. He must have been drinking as well. What a pair they were, both so pathetically broken over what should have been a meaningless affair of mutual gain.
“Yes,” she said, “I think I probably did.”
“So,” he said eventually, “do we have to change tomorrow’s plans because of the storm?”
“I didn’t know you had one.”
“I do,” Harry confirmed. “Hey, how come you’re not using your wand?”
She rolled her eyes. “Oh, I remember now what else I was going to ask – have you gone over the notes on your arm recently, Harry, or do you have them glamoured all of the time? Is there anything that might pertain to something we’ve found out recently?”
but she didn’t ask a single question about the seemingly shy young man who had come with Draco to take notes and assist with the interview.
Harry knows that Draco has trouble trusting himself ever since his actions landed him on the wrong side of the war. The mark on his forearm is proof of it, an eternal, cruel reminder. So Harry makes Draco look at it, his arm propped on the edge of the sink as Harry fucks him deeply while peppering kisses on the back of his neck.
He seemed reluctant, even embarrassed. Draco decided to take pity on him. “I couldn’t look away either,” he said. “It was rather in-your-face, wasn’t it. Or maybe I only thought so because I need to get laid.”
“No…well, sort of. Ermintrude – that’s the other old lady – asked me to tell you that she won’t let her sister murder you.”
“Right, yes.”
Draco felt a bit betrayed, although it wasn’t like Granger had ever promised him full disclosure. She worked in a place that forced her to keep secrets as a matter of course, he told himself, it would have been her natural instinct to do so in this case as well.
“The…the one in the
“By the Slytherins, maybe.”
Draco, you’ve
“Well, yes, but it would take far too long, so that’s a problem.”
Pansy threw up her hands and stomped out, muttering, “Pathetic tossers, the two of you.”
“Because it’s Christmas, Malfoy.”
“Honestly, Weasley, did you even read any of the notes we were given before this event?”
It was not an easy undertaking. Astonished stares and whispers followed them the first time they walked together between classes. After keeping his head down all year, being the center of attention wasn't something that Draco was at all comfortable with, especially when it took the form of open hostility and accusations being thrown at him.
get to be the only one who’s allowed to see it?” Smith whined.
“Merlin,” Draco said much later when they were lying in bed and catching their breaths, the air cool against their sweat-slicked skin. “I am so fucking glad you came to your senses.”
Potter snorted, and then said, “Oh!”
They marched on. Draco wondered if he was the only one feeling the awkwardness between them. Potter certainly wasn’t acting like he’d noticed. Then again, Potter had never exactly been known for emotional nuance.
“No. I admit that was not my finest moment, and it was deserved. But it bothers me how much there is that he’s obviously not telling us. What the hell sorts of secrets could those even be, and why are there
“It’s
And maybe, maybe they had, Harry thinks, smiling at the odd thought. It feels right in a way he can’t define.
“What’d you reckon?” Potter asked him when they’d left Clara Goldhorn’s flat and were walking along the road. By unspoken agreement, they passed the closest apparition point, even though it was starting to snow. Draco could use the walk to clear his head, and Potter had been cooped up in the Department of Mysteries for days on end, and in Draco’s home after that, and he was obviously enjoying being outside. When Draco glanced at him, he was busy looking up to the sky and sticking out his tongue to try and catch a snowflake.
He’d forgotten about the meeting with Potter.
“Tell me what you want.”
“Still working on the message on Harry’s arm, the one that’s for me.” She grimaced. “It’s not helpful though. I’ve nailed down the encryption method – it’s simple, really, it only needs a single password, six letters or less – but I can’t move beyond that because I have no idea what the word is. And from what I’ve gathered, there is no way to narrow it down.”
“Oh,” Draco breathed.
the department was silent.
Right. I never connected that to you having the cloak. The entire incident suddenly makes a lot more sense.”
“No,” Granger said decisively. “None of this can leave the department, and we can’t have St Mungo’s get too curious about what you’re doing. You’ll need to work here. We’ll get you everything you need, all the lab equipment, the ingredients.”
Who’d been dead for two years, and now wasn’t.
He sighed heavily. “I know. I just…it hasn’t sunk in, you know, both that she’s dead and that she was the one responsible.”
Apparently, Draco thought when he had unlaced the ribbon and found a silver necklace inside the box. A crystal disc as big as Draco’s thumbnail had been attached to it, and inside, suspended, was a spark of pure magic, orange-golden and bright. When he turned it in the light, it glittered beautifully. Draco had never seen anything like it. When he touched the disc, feeling awed, the familiar feel of Harry’s magic prickled his fingertips.
“Yes. And what I think happened is that Death…that he merged both Harrys into one.”
pureblood trying to adapt to a modern, muggle-friendly society. But if you’re that worried about it, start by giving him a gift, or send him flowers.”
“Do you mind if I use his left arm, despite all of these?” Draco asked, indicating the obscured writing. “I’ve taken from the right one twice already, and since his blood isn’t flowing because of the stasis, the section of vein I take it from stays empty. The more I take from one spot, the harder I have to suction, and that can damage the vein. I’d like to avoid collapsed veins and haematomas once he’s out of stasis.
Draco thought that was quite a dark thing for Weasley to say, but apparently it worked to distract Parvati from her despondent thoughts a little bit. “You probably shouldn’t say that in front of an Auror,” she pointed out. “Not that part of me doesn’t feel the same. I should probably recuse myself from the case, but I can’t bear to do it. Not now.”
Kingsley hums as he eats. “Caramel apple,” he squeezes out. “One of my favorites!”
is the bestest beta reader that ever beta read. The very bestest, I tell you!
“She has
“Leave,” he said hoarsely and all but fled back to the manor.
He gave another shake of the head. “I haven’t been there in a few days. I did note down plenty of ideas of what we could try, and I’d planned on starting on them yesterday, but I wasn’t able to go in, obviously. Sorry.”
“Oh.” He looked back at Draco after two steps. “Potter and Granger were arguing when I passed by her office on my way here. I’m quite certain your name fell at least twice before they got a silencing charm up.”
“Yes, er, as it happens, I am also not feeling well. Perhaps I should return once I know for certain I don’t have Mumblemumps.”
“Of course not,” Harry said at once. He sounded vehement, even disgusted, and there was something in his voice that made Draco wonder what exactly Harry's history was with that sort of violence. He didn't dare ask.
“Careful,” he said. “It's a tad fragile.”
The owl landed in front of him two days later, perching precariously on his goblet and preventing him from taking the sip he’d meant to. He gripped the stem hard and scrutinized the fluffy little thing. It had a note tied to one leg and a small box to the other, and it would barely hold still long enough for him to get both of these untied.
After several more questions for the purpose of nailing down the timeline, Draco decided there was no reason to torture the poor woman any longer. It was obviously upsetting for her, thinking back to the incident, and so he thanked her and shook her hand and assured her that they would find the Secretary’s murderer.
“Draco,” Harry cut in, “Draco, we have less than half an hour to try and survive this, do you really think that wasting time –”
“No, I need to walk. I haven’t done enough of it over the last few days, and I’m sore from just sitting and lying down.”
like me calling you Draco,” he said triumphantly.
She rolled her eyes. “It’s a half-cooked theory at best, but I can’t seem to come up with another one, given what we know. Death isn’t…I mean, I can’t really get around anthropomorphising Death to explain this – it might be the only way that any of us can even begin to understand –”
“How did you get this?” he asked. “I asked the curator, she said the artist hadn’t done any others, and she promised to tell me right away if…”
“Oh,” he croaked when he finally looked up and saw the Veil. “Oh fuck, this…you think this is when you restart the time loop.”
Pressing Malfoy to his chest, he ran, faster than he had ever run in his life, from the sixth floor to the first, ignoring the other students’ exclamations as he passed. No teachers came his way.
He tried to lead her into the kitchen so he could offer her tea and buy himself a little time to process that someone with whom he’d only ever traded insults was at his doorstep at eleven thirty at night, but she stopped in the dimly lit hall and faced him.
“He’s not talking to me at all right now. Left a note saying he’d be with his parents for the foreseeable future.”
So Draco walked them both back the way he’d come, past the room that had been his lab, to a door he’d never seen any of the Unspeakables go through. At Potter’s prodding, he opened it and peeked in.
“Draco?” Victoria asked.
“That one is much better,” Draco said.
The sound of pecking on glass started just a moment later. Draco groaned and rolled over, inelegantly getting to his knees so he could reach the window. “Who the fuck sends an owl in this weather?”
“Draco,” Harry said, voice full of wonder and desperation.
“Do you believe me now?” Potter was asking gently. His hand covered hers. “That you’re blameless?”
“You need to reschedule.”
Wordlessly, Draco slid to one side of the bench, making room. Harry took the invitation and sat.
“But…but what about the insanity bug?” Draco splutters, unwilling to believe his ears.
Draco employed his best condescending I-am-not-impressed facial expression, which he had perfected around the age of seven. “Poisons are my area of expertise, Mr Selwyn. I assure you every single thing you just said was incorrect.”
“I vote for drinking,” said Potter, and Weasley handed over the Firewhisky.
“But how do I get back down?” he wondered.
“Parvati,” he said with a nervous smile.
Draco swallowed hard as he rearranged the herbs, separated them out and reached for his silver knife. “You know why.”
Was Harry trying to win him over with material favors now?
Draco gave a bitter chuckle. His pride was stinging, but that wasn't the important bit. He knew how everyone would be talking for the rest of the day, and probably even longer than that. How the Death Eater couldn't handle the reminders of what he'd done. How Malfoy dared to think his pain was worse than that of people who'd seen their friends and family die. He had heard it before. Now it would just flare up again.
“Well, yes, but I had to reform once I started Auror training, for obvious reasons.”
“We agreed to keep him secret for a reason,” Weasley argued.
“That’s the central nervous system,” said Draco quietly.
“Had a long one, haven’t you?” The girl gave him a sympathetic look. “You look it.”
“At this point, who do you think it is?” Draco asked.
“Yes,” Harry agreed emphatically. “So obviously, I have to stop my flatmate from going out with him, see?”
Draco winced. “It’s…complicated, but I promise–”
“Because she offered me first names,” said Draco.
“I take time for a visual inspection through the wards every morning, but Anton and I always do maintenance together, and he’s been in Lithuania. He and I are the only ones who can access the cubes.”
He cleared his throat. “No, um, we should…we should get started.” Feebly, he lifted the folder he had brought.
Draco looked up at him. Potter was standing there, wringing his hands, looking as anxious as Draco had ever seen him – and considering they’d faced each other during a war, that was saying something.
“Yeah, true, but all three of them have someone they’re looking forward to spending time with. Hermione said she was certain – she’ll double check though, just to make absolutely sure.” He nodded toward the booth. “It’s our turn.”
“Pansy,” he said, smiling through gritted teeth. He had very much hoped not to run into anyone while he did this, because he hadn’t been able to think of a very good excuse for why on earth he would be de-gnoming Draco’s garden – or really, any excuse at all. He’d welcome even a bad one with open arms, but his mind remained infuriatingly blank. “How nice to see you,” he said instead.
“Why do
Draco himself, trying to force those same words out after he’d –
“Oh,” he said. Good.”
“Generally, yes, but there are exceptions. I would wager a guess that the Selwyn family attached some condition to the inheritance – that he has to get married first, for example.” Draco once again checked the parchment strip on which Parvati had scrawled an address. “This can’t be right; we should have passed it by now.”
“She could have come here and
Babs tutted as Draco hopped down from the stool. “The youth of today. So fragile. Egbert! You should be ashamed of yourself!”
“What about Victoria? If we somehow get across to her what to do and to do it in secret, she could work on the antidote without even telling us, so it wouldn’t affect our behaviour.”
“But I deserve it,” Draco said blankly.
“Acerola cherry, yes, and then obviously make it clear it’s for the antidote – or do you think she’ll get that on her own?”
It happened in Charms, as the class practiced basic silent casting. The only sounds in the classroom were Flitwick's voice, encouraging and praising, the occasional shout of triumph whenever someone managed to Summon their designated handkerchief from across the room, and of course Finnegan's cursing whenever his wand acted up again. So far, he had managed to singe Granger's hair, turn his handkerchief yellow, and make the room smell like lavender, and Draco was just thinking that it was high time Finnigan had Ollivander take a look at that worthless piece of wood he was waving around. Once again, Finnigan shot a glare across the room and raised his wand.
“How so?”
“What now, Potter?”
“Please don’t be mad,” Potter asked…begged, really.
“Yes,” she said. “They’d managed to capture some manner of time current in the jar, and the poor hummingbird went in cycles, like a phoenix, just much shorter and quicker. When they Vanished the jar, the current dissipated. It was before I started to work here, but I was told that the wizard who did it had a beard that grew longer and retracted again for most of a week before it all evened out, and the rest of the Unspeakables that were around at the time developed an astonishing amount of cavities in their teeth.”
For the first time in a very long time, all was right with the world, and he felt like a child again, running through the manor carefree and happy instead of with terror in his heart.
Harry scrubbed his hand through his hair. “Is it just me or does it feel like we’ve made no progress at all lately?”
“I will be helping you. I’m going to mention one facet of your mother’s life at a time, and you say whatever names or descriptions you can think of. Hank over there will write them down.”
Harry’s brows shot up. “So…you don’t even
Harry reflexively yanked his wand up to cast a spell and then realized there was nothing powerful enough to keep him either dry or warm – not when the wind was so strong that the rain was pelting damn near sideways, and the sheer amount of what was coming down could have filled a small ocean. The curb was already overflowing.
“Probably.” Draco was beyond caring. He had scraped the very top layer of his skin right off, and now everything stung.
“Yes,” Draco confirmed simply.
inside it?”
“I’ve been saying it has to be the ‘time loop’. Because there’s no point in leaving myself any messages if I don’t
“And that you were poisoned too,” Draco added.
The gentle buzzing in his ears didn't stop for quite some time.
“So, tell me about the Bakewell tart,” he demands.
“Yeah,” Potter said somberly. “I think that may be one of the smarter decisions the Ministry has made.”
“I can’t wait to see everyone again,” Harry told them as he helped himself to another slice of roast beef. “You were right though, I think, to have it wait until after the Christmas chaos. It would have been utter madness if I’d simply shown up at dinner.”
“Me too,” said Weasley conversationally.
By mutual agreement, Draco and Harry set out late that afternoon to visit the Christmas market once more – which was a relief because he was cutting it rather close with Christmas presents this year. As they walked, he filled Harry in about the conversation he’d had with Blaise.
“Has she ever used that insult before?”
“Why, Penny?” Harry asked again.
A second later, he felt the stinging hex hitting his skin. His cry was more one of surprise than pain, although it did hurt – in the best way. How Harry had discerned that this was something he needed, he didn't know, but it worked. Over and over, Harry touched the tip of his wand to Draco's back, until Draco was a shaking, sobbing mess, hunched over with his palms and forehead on the floor.
Draco produced a resigned sigh. “I’ll never understand Gryffindors.”
“Is there anyone else who could do this?” Clearwater asked. “Who might know more?”
“Notes about what?” Selwyn glared at them, but Draco, who had been glared at by people like Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback on many occasions, remained unimpressed.
Draco allowed himself a moment or two to feel flattered. “Cheers.”
“Well, yes, generally, but we do need to do a certain amount of maintenance on it. She’s careful not to spend too much time in there, she says she’ll never want to leave otherwise. I was told that before the decision was made to keep it locked, there were actually a few people who died because they refused to leave it. Or, when they did, the sudden absence of all the emotion they’d felt in the room literally caused a lethal shock.”
“Yes, alright, fine, whatever you say.” Potter stuffed his frost-reddened hands in his pockets. “Can we go, then, before I freeze my arse off?”
Draco said with feeling.
The water on the floor turned red.
“Would you know if he’d done it behind your back?”
Draco sighed deeply and put down Victoria’s notes. There was no point, he couldn’t concentrate on them. It really would have been nice to know if there was the tiniest chance Potter might…not be entirely averse to the idea of getting a tad closer to Draco than strictly necessary. Draco cursed his previous iterations for not convincing Potter to put the tiniest hint about it on his arm. It would have made things so much easier. Then again, his previous iterations had probably all been just as terrified to try it as Draco was now, and if they hadn’t kissed Potter, they could hardly have left hints about it.
"I'm assuming that you'll be with him when the time comes to write a new message on his arm."
going to start hyperventilating, and then he promptly did it anyway.
A sharp spike of panic made it suddenly hard to breathe. Draco tried to look casual, but he wasn’t sure what to do with his hands, so he hid them under the desk, but then he realised that it probably made him look ridiculous.
There is a moment of baffled silence. “Hermione said that?”
Granger looked surprised, and then approving.
Things get a bit more entertaining when the cakes are baked and it’s time for caramel sauce. Professor Sprout and Madam Pomfrey hover, wands at the ready in case anyone manages to burn themselves horribly in the process. Harry dumps sugar and water into the provided small copper cauldron, just like the instructions say, and heats the whole thing until it forms a syrup. Then he stirs again and watches, stupidly, as everything turns into white, rock-hard crystals.
“But –”
“I’m only trying to weigh indulging your paranoia against screwing this up and risking more suicides happening. We’ve got…crap, we’ve got five, six minutes, max, before they’ll be gone from wherever the hand-off is happening.”
“Why?” Draco asked neutrally – at least he hoped it sounded that way.
“I’ve answered the question,” said Selwyn. “We argued, she died. That is all there is to it.”
"Breathing isn't what I need right now," Draco told her, fully aware he sounded ridiculous. "I...where are we going, anyway?"
“What sort of sense does it make that you’re the one getting the only easy letter?” Harry asked.
“True.”
“Erm,” said Potter.
“But there are no numbers or anything, how are we supposed to know? We can’t just knock on every single door.”
And he knew, pretty words by a Quidditch pitch aside, that it would happen eventually.
“What was her name, do you remember?”
“Blaise,” she said, like it was obvious, and it sort of was, really. Granger didn’t routinely come in contact with all that many people who knew Draco well, and there were far too many of Draco’s favorites in the bag for it to be a guess. He gave her an appreciate nod and took a bite of crunchy, flaky palmier.
But it had been himself that Malfoy couldn't forgive, his own self-hatred that was standing in his way. Harry had figured that out after a while, but it had taken him longer to know what to do about it, how to help. And then he'd realized that what Malfoy needed was to let go, to have that weight of responsibility taken away from him, and Harry had obliged him and taken over, cared for him and made Draco, ever so slowly, his.
He ends up fifth out of eight – which is made official when the glowing number five Kingsley had scribbled into the air above his swiss roll zooms across the tent and affixes itself to his shirt. As everyone files out and the house-elves descend upon the mess, he vows to make it up in the next round.
“Get away?” Draco proposes, unsure.
"Cheers." Blaise ripped Bartholomew out of Draco's hands and set it carefully on the kitchen counter, then fluffed the leaves.
“Hurry,” Susan Bones said, frowning steeply as she scanned the hall they were standing in. “If we don’t manage to intercept that –”
“I wish I could argue, but I see your point.” Draco sank onto the sofa with a tired sigh and stared at the festive red candles in large rectangular glass containers spelling out the word ‘NOËL’. The candles were surrounded by red and gold potpourri. It was the absolute antithesis of how he was feeling. “Is the sickening Gryffindorishness on purpose?”
“Sounds promising,” Blaise said. “Luckily, I’m wearing this very official uniform and am not afraid to use it. Let’s go fetch our cloaks, no sense in wasting time.”
“Er…Draco Malfoy.”
Grabbing the bottle and glasses didn’t take him very long, but he did take the time to dig through his cupboards for some kind of snack to go with the wine. When he finally returned, bottle in hand and shooing everything else ahead of him with his wand, Blaise was standing there with an ominous look on his face, arms crossed.
“I wouldn’t be so sure,” she told him.
“But do they know what happened, while you were at the manor? The things Voldemort made you do?”
Potter winced and closed his eyes. “Not yet. Sorry.”
“Pulse,” Granger whispered, seconds later.
“It’s so hard to hold back,” he said, voice shaky. “You feel… you feel…”
“I know they’re saying poison, but that isn’t possible! We ate the same food my mother did, and even if it had been poisoned, she had an heirloom, a necklace that protects against poisons!”
“I am!” Draco snapped.
“Not hungry,” Draco responded succinctly, and dipped his quill in the ink. But Potter didn't let it go.
“Oh bollocks, they’ve partnered you up with Armadill?” Harry exclaimed.
She gives him a secretive smile. “That was the first step.”
Suddenly, Granger was beaming. “Rose!”
“Er, I just remembered Blaise saying that you like some of the chocolates there.”
“So far?” Harry asked as the rapid clicking and clacking of knitting needles started back up.
advised one of the clues. Another said
Harry stared at him for a very long time, Draco knew that even without looking his way. He waited for the inevitable protest and tried to prepare himself for it. He didn’t actually expect Harry to get as angry as he did.
welcome aboard.”
Potter stared. “What?”
“I've been meaning to talk to you,” Harry said.
Draco obeyed. Harry’s hands pushed down on his shoulders just hard enough to get them to relax bit by bit. He kept dictating ‘in, out,” and after several minutes of that, Draco felt the tension beginning to trickle out of him.
“Back home from where?” Harry asked.
He listened attentively, every muscle in his body tense, ready to strike. And there it was! He registered the unmistakable sound of a foot splashing water as it was set on the wet floor. Lightning fast, Harry emerged from his cover and stood face to face with his arch enemy Draco Malfoy…
“Oh, shit,” said Draco.
“What if…what if we let everything play out as it did this time except make sure we have an antidote available?”
Draco turned the canvas over and read,
“Don’t be stupid, he never comes in here!” Draco waved her off confidently. The more he thought about it, the more he liked the idea. The painting would provide a much needed bright spot in his dull Ministry employee existence, and if there was ever someone he needed to unnerve – truth be told, there usually was – he would simply schedule a meeting in his office and let the painting take it from there.
“You can even personalize it,” Harry said and pointed at a sign proclaiming exactly that while taking Draco’s hand with his free one as though they’d done that a million times, and Draco felt inordinately pleased. “Shall we get one for Smith that says, ‘Departmental Grinch Award’?”
“Of course,” Draco said softly and tucked his wand away. “I appreciate you telling me as much as you did.”
“They’re giving Susan the antidote,” Weasley cut to the chase. “Harry’s already headed over.”
Draco wrenched his wrist out of Potter's grip and bent to pick up his knife. “Do not,” he said in a clipped voice, “talk with Granger about me. Do
“It’s Buglirg,” said the mother. “But I think nicknames are acceptable for little ones, so we call him Bug. I’m Graglor.”
“Indeed. I tried everything I could think of to figure out how the poison enters the body, but I found nothing. The poison is distributed completely evenly. With the speed I’ve seen it work, that shouldn’t be possible.”
“I can only hope that Molly’s enthusiasm about another grandchild will be catching,” she said. “Anyway, this isn’t why you’re here.”
Harry remained silent for a while. Draco, after drinking, did the same. With the sudden warmth coursing through him, he felt almost like before he had broken it off, Harry’s presence so comforting next to him and the tension that had always,
“Would you mind not talking about food until we’re out of this room?”
“We’d like to ask you a few questions,” Potter said behind him, voice calm and professional.
wouldn’t, but then, you I hardly care about.”
“Was she in the habit of leaving so early?”
“We really did have a good reason.”
“I know, I know.” She went to the little safe and carefully removed the tinsel wrapped around it. Not books in there, after all, then. Draco couldn’t help but watch her enter the combination and trace a rune with her wand, but he forgot all about that once she opened the safe wide and straightened up from her crouch.
“Seriously?”
With a small grimace, Draco did. A moment later, he was staring down at a red and white ‘E’ in despair.
There was a shriek. The two of them jumped to their feet, but then they heard laughter, and when Granger and Weasley came back into the room, they were smiling broadly.
“Er,” Harry said.
“We never moved, love,” the bus driver shouted back. “You never said where it was you wanted to go.”
“That,” Draco whispered, “was amazing.”
“No one,” said Draco. “I couldn’t bear to look at it anymore, it was only a reminder of how badly I fucked up.”
"I can do this," he told himself.
“Er,” Draco said.
“It isn’t. But.” She bit her lip.
“The curse-breaker’s assistant did it because her uncle was faking his illness and she was trying to expose him in the most convoluted manner possible. There, consider us even.” Blaise laid the book down and smirked.
Draco stared hard at his parchment, the lines swimming before his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter looked surprised. “Why?”
“You’re high-strung,” says Harry.
“Why’s it all so cryptic though?” Weasley asked. “Why can’t you just be straightforward with yourself?”
"I will fucking hex you," Draco hissed. "Keep your voice down."
“Will you shut the hell up, I’m trying to suck your cock here!”
“Malfoy, I can't just-”
enough, to admit it.
"Such hysterics," said Blaise.
“How could you even manage to
He catches movement from the corner of his eye, a pale and blond vision that is drifting like a ghost through the shambles, searching. A feeling of kinship floods him, blessedly cool tranquility. He waits until Draco has reached him, and then they walk together like that was how they had been meant to end up all along.
“Well what good are you then?”
“Yes.”
Draco, who had literally rolled out of bed less than a minute ago and banged into two walls and five different pieces of furniture on his way to open the door for her, shook his head.
They finally turned away from their belly-doting to look. It only took a moment until Granger gasped. “Where did you get that, Harry? These are supposed to be under lock and key!”
"Alright, my ridiculous friend." Blaise turned, flexed his fingers and cracked his knuckles, then cleared his throat. "As I already told you, you need to relax about Christmas."
He cleared his throat. “I do actually have a legitimate reason to question witnesses,” he said. “I need to know timeframes, how
Granger huffed a laugh. “I’m aware. But apparently the universe isn’t, because it happened anyway.”
His fingers twitched with nervous energy as he roamed the hallways after classes, deep in thought and wondering how to save himself from the worst of the fallout. It would ruin him.
“Congratulations,” Draco said at the same time Potter did.
She was silent then, and looked at him with so much pity in her eyes that he didn’t want to see.
“Me,” Granger said simply. “It’s why they assigned me to the Time Room in the first place. It took me three years to figure it out a way to extract the sand, and actually doing it took weeks. It’s been in here ever since.”
Harry informed him like it was the best thing in the world.
“Excuse me!” Harry called out. She jumped and spun around, surprisingly nimble for someone who was – by Draco’s estimate – at least seventy.
“That’s not funny,” said Granger from the door.
on her face, and arguing with Hermione…it’s not a useful pastime.”
“Plausible, yeah?” Harry asked grimly.
Harry didn’t pace, but he made up for it by looking more aggravated than Draco had ever seen him. “Could try dispelling it with the Elder Wand.”
“Normally the spell decides on one age and bloody
“No, Harry.”
But he still couldn’t stop himself from carrying the necklace in his pocket for most of the day, and stow it securely in his nightstand after that. That night, before going to sleep, he couldn’t keep himself from brushing a finger across the surface of the crystal disc, closing his eyes on a heavy, painful sigh. He very carefully didn’t think about what that might mean for him.
“Draco asked me to check on his kneazle while he’s gone,” she said, taking his upper arm in a surprisingly strong grip. “Try again, I’ll help.”
“She was feeling fine before the meeting, and then she kept shivering afterwards. The meeting lasted around forty-five minutes, and I’m going to assume that she talked to her assistant afterwards for no more than five minutes.
“Did an autopsy today. Apparently, Briar Amado doesn’t mind someone cutting his brother open if he gets some drinking money out of it.”
“That’s…plausible, sort of,” Draco said and went to pay for the gummy bears.
“Like…one of those people who get paid to take their clothes off?” Draco asked with horror.
“What’s going on?” he asked.
“So you’re upset that Potter is slacking?” Pansy asked.
“And you bought it for
“Oh.” Harry shifted and fidgeted, as though trying to get comfortable but utterly unable to. “I saw him down at the party. He was throwing himself at Hannah Abbott.”
“Yes, mate, you already said that,” Ron pointed out, his voice muffled by half a buttered scone that he was busy devouring.
He has no idea what that means, and she won’t elaborate.
“You won’t have enough for the outside then,” Harry points out.
“Set!”
A strange sort of tension hung in the air between them. Draco registered it even while he wondered what to say in response. As Harry's thumb brushed the silk of Draco's pyjamas, he felt something like the crackle of a magical build-up. It was strange and a bit worrying.
“Merlin fuck,” Draco breathed, yet again.
“I’m afraid I must insist,” Draco said and took a step closer. He’d had an inkling Selwyn wouldn’t be the slightest bit cooperative and had taken the time to think of ways to make him. “Unless, of course, you don’t mind people knowing that you refused to help solve your mother’s murder. And, oh, right, you’re inheriting everything, aren’t you? I wonder what they’ll make of that.”
“What’s that for?”
“Fuck,” Draco said succinctly and started taking his gloves off. He had felt frustrated and short-tempered since the morning, and it was only getting worse. The autopsy hadn’t helped a lick. “How the hell is it so well-distributed? It shouldn’t be possible; it just doesn’t fit.”
“Harry,” he said. “Harry, are you
“I’m not doing this, then,” Harry said.
“Hermione asked us to stop by the department,” were the words that greeted Draco when he entered his home after a very long day at the lab.
Draco decided it was high time they said their goodbyes.
Draco spent most of the next day dealing with his hangover, taking several potions to cure his pounding head, his nausea, his dehydration. He wondered why he always forgot this part when he decided drinking was a good idea, and he grumbled about Blaise enabling him. He very carefully did not think about what had happened on the astronomy tower the night before. His headache had only just gone, and he had a feeling that too much thinking would bring it right back.
A hush falls over the crowd as Molly and Kingsley walk up to the black table. There is a sound like a struck gong, and the first cake appears on the table in a swirl of dramatic glitter.
“When did he come through?”
Draco slammed the front door shut, stalked into the living room where Harry was busy writing something in a little muggle notebook, dropped into his armchair like a drunk house elf and said, “Murder me. Make it quick, if you will.”
Eight minutes.
is the rainbow to my writerly thunderstorm.
“Yes, we do.”
Potter nodded and was silent, looking thoughtful. Draco waited, but he didn’t seem to be ready to share. Instead, he tilted his head back again and stuck his tongue out.
“Trying to figure out if you sent the flowers.” Ron yawned. “How are you going to let him know it was you, by the way?”
There is the bone-deep weariness, of course, a result of not only the battle itself, but of the events that preceded it – of the entire year, in a way. It had all been so transient, so precarious, a state of things that could not sustain itself indefinitely, and that put more pressure on him than he’d thought he could handle. Harry had skirted the edge of the precipice for so long he’d gotten used to the vertigo, and now that he has jumped, that he is free-falling…he’s helplessly searching for his new truth.
“Was that…was that supposed to be an impression of me, you complete lunatic?”
Draco sighed and scrubbed his palms over his face. “As I told Potter earlier, Parvati came to me this morning, and we figured out that the poison used in the case she’s working is the same one Potter came out of the Veil with. If we’re trying to figure out who poisoned him, we need to work with her.”
Harry cursed silently.
Draco took another bite and grinned around his spoon, because seeing Weasley wince and cower was brilliant. A moment later, his free hand was taken by Harry, who was smiling broadly.
liked that cloak, Potter.”
“It’s mostly guesswork,” Draco admitted, reaching for his final syringe. Granger made a displeased sound, because clearly it wasn’t what she wanted to hear, but he wasn’t about to lie to her either. “I’m trying to protect the most essential systems the best I can. If he loses the use of his hands, that’s too bad, but we can try to fix it later. If he loses the use of his lungs, well, we might not get around to worrying about his hands.”
“Well, still. I got you a window, so you’d best be thankful.” She started digging in her handbag as she sought Draco’s gaze. “How is he looking?”
“Well, actually –”
. Draco growled with frustration and pulled against the grip.

year common room. Draco rubbed his temples to chase away the beginnings of a headache, and he was contemplating turning in when he saw movement from the corner of his eye. A moment later, Harry crouched in front of him.
He glanced at her. “So, it wasn’t anything you lot were mucking around with? Trying to bring him back?”
“The four seasons is fine,” Ron grumbles.
“Ron and I told her the same,” said Granger, “but hearing it and believing it are two completely different things. I’m glad she’ll be able to start healing now.”
, and there was only one person who could help him wrap his mind around it.
“I’ve been trying to hang these up, but as you can see, it’s not going well. I don’t have the patience to fix this mess tonight.
“Well,” Babs said and jabbed a needle in the side of his neck for a second time, “yes. Very jumpy, she was. Shivered dreadfully toward the end, poor dear, but you’ll be happy to hear that I did not catch Mumblemumps from her.”
“It’s fine,” Draco assured her. “It’s the poison. He’s starting to sweat it out faster than I thought.”
“In about a year or so, you’ll be heartily sick of that one,” Harry predicted.
“Patil,” he said, surprised. “I wasn’t expecting you this soon, if at all.”
“Both, ideally,” said Draco. “Antidote takes precedence, but I believe the more we understand about the poison, the more effective an antidote we can create.”
“It was horrible,” she said, sitting slumped in her kitchen chair. “He shouted it, right in the atrium. Everyone heard. It’s not even true!”
“Yeah, eventually, but it’s in code.” Potter frowned. “The reason I started yelling was because instead of
He was well aware that Draco generally hired someone to do the job for him, but with the terrible infestations that had been spreading all throughout Britain faster than a wildfire, professional de-gnomers were impossible to come by unless one agree to be the seven hundred and twentieth name on the waiting list.
“Sure,” said Potter, but he didn’t look at Draco at all. The snow-covered ground was evidently far more interesting.
Harry gave Draco a look that started speculative and turned sappy within seconds. “No,” he admitted.
“Lovely,” said Babs, “so if you would please step onto the stool over here, Mr Malfoy, we’ll get your cloak all taken care before you can so much as say ‘Hippogriff’.”
there was magic involved, but then how…
“Parvati, please,” she said. “I know. Sorry about ambushing you, but I’m under a lot of pressure. The latest victim is one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, and Robards is panicking.”
“Really I’m the one who should feel guilty,” said Potter, and he looked and sounded sad now, which made something in Draco’s chest pull uncomfortably, and Merlin
“Oh yes,” Blaise said with emphasis and took a very large gulp of wine. “Might blow up in our faces, in fact, depending on how they faked it. Son of a
“Fucking…
Draco dreamed of the dark streets of London, of drowning in sand, and of Potter.
“You took down the painting,” was the first thing that burst out of Harry as he entered Malfoy’s office, which…great. He had told himself that he simply wouldn’t acknowledge the artwork’s existence or that they had ever talked about it, and the first thing he’d done was
“Your handwriting is shit,” Draco told him.
He had to get him to the hospital wing, everything else could wait. Harry quickly wrapped his cloak around Malfoy and lifted him from the floor. With numb shock, he realized that Malfoy was far too cold and only taking shallow breaths. He had to hurry; time was slipping away
“Yeah. Tried to brew a potion to become prettier, her friend said. The two of them were bullied, called ugly, she thought it was worth the risk.”
Harry shrugged awkwardly. “I’m sorry, I really am,” he said.
She swallowed hard but kept looking him in the eyes.
“Nine, five, five, seven, zero, eight –”
Malfoy, too, looked horrified that he had mentioned it. Harry winced. He opened his mouth to apologize, and Malfoy said hastily, “It just, er, it didn’t fit with the rest of the decor in here.” He went very red. Oh, Harry thought, and then
“Yes, and warming charms are supposed to prevent you from feeling that, you prat.”
"Does that number include Bartholomew?"
“Malfoy,” said Potter hoarsely, and then, “Is it?”
Hermione blinked several times, then looked away and cleared her throat. “I asked Parvati to look into what might have happened between Penelope and Sylvana Brown, by the way, and what it has to do with the Janus Thickey Ward.”
“I,” he says, and breaks off. Closing his eyes, he exhales a shaky breath. He’s not ready for this.
The older woman who was sitting on the stool near the fire started at him waving his hand around. She was wearing headphones and obviously hadn’t heard him entering.
“It reminds me of…something nice.” Draco tried to look casual.
“And I thought you were going to call me ‘Harry’.”
She hadn’t done it right away after apparating them to the park. Instead, she’d let the cold, fresh air ground him until his breathing slowed and his vision cleared. Now that it had, she was crouching next to him as they both stared at the unending flurries.
“What does half-official mean, exactly?”
“Zach and I were taking the weekly readings around the Veil when he came through,” said a voice behind them. Draco turned and saw a woman with light brown curls bound in a tight ponytail coming into the office. She looked vaguely familiar.
“Draco?” Potter asked, sounding confused.
“I did do a sort of apprenticeship with a muggle haematologist as well, actually,” Draco said as he disinfected the crook of Potter’s elbow with a swipe of his wand. There was a bit of writing there, quite small, that he’d have to avoid. “The father of one of the Muggleborn trainee healers. Almost every poison is carried by blood or affects it in some way, it would have been extremely daft not to learn everything I could.”
Draco sat up straight when something occurred to him. Could he do it differently this time around? Was that possible? Could he try to kiss Potter and, depending on how it went, persuade him to add to Draco’s coded message, so at least he wouldn’t try it again if Potter hadn’t reacted well? The thought was utterly terrifying. He didn’t want to put himself out there, not one bit, but at least time would reset eventually, and he wouldn’t have to live with the humiliating memory until the end of his days.
“You deserve this,” he murmurs into Draco's ear, slaps his flank. “You deserve every bit of this.”
, Ron, just
Harry kissed him again, more deeply this time, licking the seam of Draco’s lips until they parted and allowed Harry’s tongue to slip between them. Draco’s hands came up to clutch at Harry’s shoulders, and then they were pressed against each other, lost in the kiss but for the nagging doubts and fears in the back of Draco’s mind.
“And we can’t keep the stasis up for much longer anyway,” Blaise pointed out. “Not without pulling in more people, which I don’t think would be a good idea because we
“Because it’s bloody cold, Po…Partridge!”
The little goblin started to say something and was promptly shushed. “English, Bug. You need to practice if you ever want the wizards to show you the slightest bit of respect.”
“Maybe,” Draco said in a non-committal tone.
“This was supposed to be my last day, Draco,” she said. “Has something else come up? Are you going to need me here for longer? I want to return to my life of leisure, damn it.”
“Well…” She sighed. “Then I’m all out of ideas.”
He allowed his mind to wander back to all that had happened throughout the past week as he began the familiar task of casting sweeping, scrubbing and disinfection spells. Interestingly, no matter how hard he tried to shove it away, one detail kept insisting on nagging at him.
He was sitting in the library, trying desperately to catch up on his neglected homework, when Granger found him. She didn’t say anything right away, just sat next to him and opened her Arithmancy book. His concentration went out the window immediately. When Draco tried to move away, she placed her hand on his arm, making him jump. No one had purposely touched him since Harry.
“Clothes off,” he said, and Draco obeyed. His fingers still shook as he tried to work out the buttons, but then, that wasn’t anything new. He lost his shirt and his trousers and socks and pants, and then he let himself be bent over a sink and closed his eyes while Harry kissed and touched every single inch of his skin. They stopped only once so Harry could warm the air in the room with a spell, getting Draco to stop shivering quite so pathetically. Soon, he was wrapped around Draco like a warm blanket, holding him tightly while his tongue and teeth savaged Draco’s neck and created the marks Draco loved so much. There was very little pain, which was fine, because at the moment Draco didn’t need it. Later, perhaps, Harry would experiment with biting and hair pulling and stinging hexes during sex, would turn Draco inside out with the conflicting sensations and send him to that floating headspace he so loved.
“Because otherwise there wouldn’t have been reason for Granger or the other to put you in stasis so quickly, and you would have died.”
“That’s what he said.”
But he had to admit that the savior looked good, glitter and all. The rebuilding of Hogwarts and five months of school had done Harry favors. He filled out and he carried himself well, which was, to be precise, the exact opposite of Draco.
go down that rabbit hole. It’s not going to end well, and there’s no point. Go home, use your days off to recover, and have a good talk with Clarke when you get back.”
“Oh,” Harry said weakly.
Of course he wasn't right. He hadn't been since the war, and never would be again. Trust Potter to state the bloody obvious.
Draco’s heart sank.
Weasley’s face remained sceptical.
“That’s a lullaby, Ronald,” Hermione sighed.
Draco sobs through his gag, a sound of pain as well as arousal, and Harry knows he's close to coming. He thrusts harder, buries his hand in Draco's hair and pulls, and seconds later Draco paints the sink and the mirror with streaks of his come, screaming into the gag all the while. He stumbles, and Harry catches him and deposits him carefully on the cold tile floor before hurriedly Accio-ing a blanket. He wraps it around both of them. Then they sit there together, with Draco burrowing against Harry's chest, seeking his warmth and his comfort and all those things Harry wants him to know he deserves to have.
Harry didn’t respond.
One thought captured him, and like a mantra, he kept repeating the words again and again: “I’m sorry, Draco! Please don’t die! Don’t die!”
“We use them at the Department of Mysteries. Blaise and Anton came up with them. They create a see-through barrier that is close to impenetrable for a little while. Very useful as a safety precaution when anyone’s doing an experiment.”
“And you’re entirely certain it couldn’t have been him?” Harry asked for the third time.
haven’t done anything wrong – not lately, I mean.”
And clarity hit him like a lightning bolt.
“I was just thinking about that.” Absently, Draco took out his wand to send a stray traveling cloak back to its proper rack, then tucked it away again, then took it out once more to re-fold a uniform and promptly realized this was just another form of fidgeting.
He kept watching as Blaise poured the blackberry liqueur into the glasses, and for a moment, he had no idea what exactly he was supposed to be watching. But then he realized that the two liquids...were not mixing. The crème de mure simply hovered a hair’s breadth above the gin as though repulsed and unwilling to come into contact
“That your breakfast-making skills are exemplary?”
“That’s not the point of a Christmas Tree, Draco.”
Soon enough, Draco realized that there was no way to gain any sort of control over the situation. Weasley just wouldn’t bloody stop putting up lights – yet another row of fairy lights in Slytherin green and silver around the window, then a grouping of flickering candles – lit by magic as not to be a fire hazard, which was just about the only thing about the situation that Draco appreciated.
“Oh, good point.” Harry looks at Theo and doesn’t give him a smile either. Potter-smiles currently seem reserved for Draco, which feels very satisfying. “We overheard you and Ron saying something about Hermione and Pansy – I mean Parkinson – being absolutely impossible if you told them about…well, whatever you were going to tell them.”
He nods.
Granger’s eyes widened a little, but that was her only outward reaction apart from a tiny nod.
“Anyway,” Finnegan piped up, sounding decidedly more cheerful, “as Dean said, we were wondering if you'd like to join us for a friendly game of Quidditch. We've got seven people together, two keepers, five chasers, need one more to make the teams full. What do you say?”
“So, what is it?” asked Potter.
Blaise swore profusely.
“Okay, fine,” Potter relents. “Meet me tonight, and we’ll sneak down to the kitchens and get some food.”
Well.
Harry walks away feeling himself falling just a little bit more.
“I can kind of see it, now that you’re pointing it out.” Pansy’s eyes were still fixated on the canvas. “But for the most part, it still just looks like a painting of two naked guys making out to me, and I don’t think I’ll be the only one thinking that.”
“What if the poison was attacking the body slow enough for the blood to distribute it everywhere before it was doing noticeable damage?” Victoria asked.
"Ah." Blaise poured a healthy amount of gin from one bottle into the shaker, then carefully plucked a handful of mint leaves off Bartholomew. "Essentially, I will make it...it's difficult to explain, you'll have to be patient for a moment."
“I’m sorry! I didn’t
“Both. Also the two of us.”
“We don’t know. He came out of the Veil.”
“Exactly,” Draco confirmed. “If I were to simply pour them both into the same vial, they would end up mixing together and reacting to each other and create all sorts of strange effects. Best case scenario, they’ll start neutralizing each other and you’re left with a weak partial antidote.”
“Oh, good,” he says.
“Yes?”
Draco’s eyes flew open as his jaw dropped.

“Don’t think so,” Potter said and tilted his head. “Marielle didn’t go to Hogwarts. And besides, red and gold are very Christmassy colours, so that’s probably why.”
“We’ve been up and down this part of the street three times!”
“Oh no,” Molly says – clearly upset for whoever this cake belongs to – after she comes across an eggshell while eating the hazelnut cake.
“Okay,” Potter says carefully. “Er…help with what, exactly?”
“Yes,” Draco said, and then, smoothly, “No!”
Harry was right – this would certainly be interesting.
But this time, Draco had to. He couldn’t talk about this. Just couldn’t. So he shook his head, frustrated, seeing the emotion mirrored in Harry’s features. Swallowing hard, he pulled away from the touch he craved.
“Can I call back in a bit?” she politely asked whoever was in her Floo. “Something just came up.”
Harry chose an armchair that was blue and squashy. He sank into it so far that he thought he might never be able to find his way back out of it. The rain drummed against the roof and sides of the bus quite loudly, and suddenly, he felt quite cozy.
“And returned what, a bit of cleverly disguised empty air?”
“You have it anyway.”
“So we’ll have to make sure she only knows after you’ve stopped com– ah, blast it, we can’t exactly give her a big long explanation of why, so she’s not likely to help us out, is she?”
“I know that,” said Harry. “But I’m well enough now that I don’t have to stay down here anymore.”
“I won’t bother trying to deny that one,” she said. “But in the time since he joined the Department of Mysteries, Zach has never shared any noticeable progress. Have you seen any proof of it? Sometimes I think he just leaves runic books lying around on his desk for show and then sits there reading the new Witch Weekly.”
"Well, what reason would you have had to pay attention to it?" she asked reasonably. "But I do have something else I wanted to talk about with you, just for a moment."
“I’ll take care of it,” She turned to the others. “I’m going to take Draco outside – might run an errand while I’m at it, too. You keep going with the decorations.”
“Why don’t you have this stirring rod already?” Blaise asked. “You’ve got the most potions equipment of anyone I’ve ever seen.”
The next time they met in their bathroom, it was an emergency. Draco was beside himself with mental anguish, he could barely even think clearly enough to get to the right room. There was a thunderstorm raging outside, harsh lightning illuminating the bathroom at irregular intervals. Draco huddled up in the corner and hoped that Harry would know to look for him here when he wasn't at dinner. He couldn't bear facing anyone else.
“Oh, I’m sure Evadne is just fine,” said Ermintrude. She stretched out a hand toward the Kneazle, who hissed again. “Excuse you,” Ermintrude huffed.
Prompt #14 – A Christmas market
“When you came out of the Veil,” Draco realized. “That was when it started.”
Potter looked at him and grinned, the corners of his eyes crinkling, and then Draco was grinning too, and that made Potter start chuckling. Draco wasn’t far behind. The snowfall was heavy around them as they stood in the middle of Diagon Alley, laughing together, the people around them giving them strange looks as they hurried past.
“Oh dear,” she said. “That does not sound promising.”
But even though the
“Honestly, Ermintrude, the storm is dreadfully loud,” said the other old lady. “Surely your hearing hasn’t gotten quite that bad?”
“Have you made any progress in the lab?”
“Goyle?
Draco shook his head. No one but his parents knew – but his father was in Azkaban now, and he couldn't talk to his mother, not about this. Never about this.
“Well, we don’t have to worry about that one. What about Agnes?”
“Fine,” he says, and falls into step with her as they follow the others to the space behind the work stations, where they line up. “Just a bit intense, yeah?” He files into the space next to Draco, gives Hermione a reassuring smile and then takes a deep, calming breath.
Draco hummed consideringly. “I can try, but I won’t make any promises.”
“Malfoy, open the door.”
Harry, feeling the pressure, wonders how he ever thought this would be light entertainment.
Blaise didn’t bother hiding a grin.
“About?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco considered it. They were nowhere near close enough that he would ever be tempted to pour out his heart to her, but they had developed something like a tentative friendship during their antidote work, and he did feel comfortable with her.
“I know Sylvana didn’t work in the ward, but would she have had access to it outside of visiting hours?” Hermione asked.
“Yes, like you have bronchitis. Slowly. In, out.”
Draco smirked at him, actually
“The snow’s fake,” Granger added. “But, I mean…I know it’s silly since Harry isn’t even conscious to see it, I just couldn’t keep from, well…”

“I’m worried that any attempt to confront Clearwater will lead her to trigger the poison in whoever does the confronting.”
"Do you know what a bartender is?" Blaise asked, a little too condescending for Draco's taste.
“Defence is fine,” he forces out. “I’ve got time tomorrow after Herbology.”
“If we keep blocking the kitchen? I mean, it’s your home, and –”
Draco carefully read the words over one more time and then Vanished the parchment with a flick of his wand. He had no idea what the message was talking about, and he didn’t think anyone else would either, but it was better to be safe than sorry.
“Hush, you prat.”
“Sit,” he said, mostly because he was worried Harry might fall, and not at all because he wanted the company. Harry obediently slumped to the floor. His green shirt was half-unbuttoned, his sleeves rolled up, and Draco could see several scars marring the tanned skin. He offered the bottle of firewhisky. Harry took it with a nod and drank deeply, leaving Draco to watch him swallow and admire the movement of his throat. His fingers itched to touch. But he couldn’t, he reminded himself sharply. Harry wasn’t his to touch, never really had been, despite him taking so many liberties.
“Really? But then how did
“Depends on the substance. They might, I don’t know, create an exothermic reaction – boil your blood.”
“Leroy,” said Ermintrude, “horrible name. I see your point.”

“It’s fine. But I mentioned it because the cairn was
"I didn't know there was a post box down the street," Draco said stupidly.
“It’s just that –”
“Malfoy,” she replied, looking unsure what to make of him.
“Can we go back to the kissing?” Harry asked hopefully.
Granger frowned down at her cutting board. Her chopping motions were precise and consistent. “It’s because antidote A and antidote B might have ingredients or elements that interact badly with each other if there is no buffering or binding agent.”
“Right,” Harry said and sat next to Parvati. “Er…let me know if you have any questions.” Draco thought it wasn’t possible for Parvati to
“You’re wanting to ask me a lot of the same questions as Hermione, aren’t you?”
Potter blinked a few times and seemed to be assessing whether Draco was serious. Then he said, “Brilliant.”
“Indeed.” Draco reached over and took the cube Blaise had set down on the coffee table. “How does it work?”
“Oh, good,” Potter said, sounding vaguely dazed. “I was worried maybe you weren’t interested after all.”
“Ah, well, then enlighten me – what
"Fine,

“I don't need your help,” he ground out.
need it.”
“Why do you call me ‘Potter’ but she’s ‘Parvati’?” Potter asked.
“I don’t think so,” said Granger. “I’ll check more closely in a little while. I obscured it as soon as I realized that some of it looked like either personal or sensitive information, but I’ll share as much as I can.”
Blaise nodded.
“He’s…that means it’s working, right?” Granger asked hesitantly, as though dreading the answer.
“What? And can I do anything else?”
“But I mean, he’s a pureblood, you know, he’s probably used to all this
Merlin, he was such a prat.
Their eyes both went to Harry, lying peacefully in his makeshift bed.
“You do realize that Potter’s story has more holes in it than a Swiss cheese, don’t you?”
Draco felt a bit lost and like he’d missed something, but that didn’t stop the guilt from trying to drown him anyway. He tried to find something to say, a peace offering, a placating gesture, but in the end, he remained silent and confused and felt like a knob.
Granger gave him a shrug, apparently figuring they might as well put all their cards on the table. “We’re pretty sure that this victim time-travelled,” she said. “And he lost his memory, so we don’t know how far in the future he came from, or what the circumstances were of him getting poisoned.”
Draco winced, but Potter only leaned over to be able to grin at her past Draco’s head. “Relax, ‘Mione, I told him about the thing with Voldemort, that’s all.”
Harry reached for his hand and intertwined their gloved fingers. “Look how far you’ve come,” he murmured, and Draco might have taken offence to it if he hadn’t said it so warmly and with genuine approval and happiness.
“I have, though,” Potter announces proudly. “Earlier today, I saw Parkinson and Hermione whispering together. There is no other explanation than them masterminding a plan.”

Draco swallowed hard. "Right, yes, fair point."
eyesight.”
The first ones to produce actual caramel are, shockingly, Neville and Goyle. Harry watches with envy as they finish their sauce and begin stacking their cakes. Next to Harry, Draco has started on a round of inventive swearing as Ron and Parkinson go around, vanishing the contents of several cauldrons as to allow their owners to try again. And again.
He felt sick. His hand flew to his wrist and started scratching the already sore skin before he even thought about it. Potter lunged for him, and Draco stumbled back, keeping his hands out of reach. Didn't Potter understand he needed this?
“I know, but what am I supposed to do? If I go under the cloak and she notices you have someone invisible with you, you’ll be in massive trouble. It’s not worth it.
“Er, well…I suppose.” Harry frowned. “There was a, a disagreement with my flatmate. I needed to clear my head.”
“I don't understand.”

“Course I did,” Ron says hastily. “Yes, yeah, of course. All of them. All the…many pages.”
“Yep,” said Ron on his way to the door. “Me too. It’s called the ‘Harry’s a blind, oblivious idiot who doesn’t listen to me’ crisis.”

“Unfortunately, he spent several years after Hogwarts developing an interest in Runic Divination.” Draco couldn’t see Granger rolling her eyes, but he was certain that’s what she was doing. “It’s a ridiculously obscure field of study that he apparently managed to learn from some witch in Iceland, but our former department head – Adolphius bloody Widdleway, you may have heard of him, he had that scandalous whirlwind romance with Celestina Warbeck shortly after he quit the Ministry because of some ridiculous midlife crisis – well, anyway, he had the grand idea of hiring Zacharias to study the oldest prophecies we have stored here. They go back shockingly far, and some of the earliest ones feature runes in a way that nobody quite understands anymore. Widdleway thought we could decipher and study them and eventually develop revolutionary new divination techniques in some unspecified way that he never really bothered to think about for more than two minutes.”
“Alright.” Potter sounded unconvinced. He took a step back, but then hesitated and stepped forward again, stretching out his hand. The tips of his fingers ghosted across Draco’s cheek. “Good night.”
“Oh, for goodness’ sake!” she exclaimed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“A bit,” Draco repeats, still in the middle of processing what just happened.
“I’m a healer, Potter,” he said quietly. “It’s my job, it’s what I
Draco frowned. “They never did during the time we were down there.”
“SEVERUS!” Madam Pomfrey interceded. “Leave the boy! Can’t you see he’s utterly shaken?”
“Theo did
“Still.”
Parkinson ignores him. “Dear audience, we have to say goodbye for today. Please join us again two weeks from now, when Biscuit Week will test our remaining bakers in new and unexpected ways!”
As though in slow motion, Harry’s wand fell from his hand as he stepped out from behind the pillar.
“Malfoy, don't!” Potter cried.
“There was –”
She gave him an amused glance. “Not
“She flooed me earlier, actually. So far, all she’s found is that Penelope had a friend who stayed at the ward for a couple of weeks during the time Sylvana worked as a Welcome Witch.”
Together, they greet the dawn.
“So, purebloods don’t do this kind of thing then.”
When he let himself into his flat, he wondered for perhaps the five hundredth time whether he should maybe get a Kneazle or something of the sort. The place was so cold and lonely and dark whenever he came back, and it seemed doubly so if his day had been a bad one. He threw his bag in a corner and dropped his coat somewhere in the hall, his mind only on the tea everyone kept telling him to have. It was late, and part of him wanted to drop into bed right away, but a cup of tea would help soothe his stressed-out mind.
“Granger offered to let me see this one,” Draco said, preoccupied with watching Potter ram his shoulder into the bearded man’s stomach. The man went down with a grunt and pulled Potter with him as he started to fall down the steep and claustrophobic-looking flight of stairs half-hidden behind him.
“Well, he could have one assistant, right?” Granger bargained. “To take notes? We’d use a glamour and everything.”
It started not long after the beginning of eighth year, when it had become clear to Harry just how broken Draco – though he was still Malfoy then – had become. He hadn't been given a choice in the matter of returning to school; the ministry and the Wizengamot had made that choice for him. So there he was, just a quiet, blond shadow, and all that made him the self-assured brat he'd always been seemed to have fled sometime between Voldemort's death and the start of the first class of the term. It had taken a while for Harry to understand the full extent of the shame, and how the knowledge of his wrong choices was dragging Malfoy down like a lead weight around his neck.
"That's a sort of hovering charm, yeah?" Weasley asked.
She gave a nod. “Much better. Now then – how can I help you two? Work robes? Alterations?”
“As long as you answer our questions and tell the truth, we will not share anything outside of the department. You have my word.”
"Tell me you did NOT invite Weasley to my flat."
changed was Draco’s perception of them. Granger’s love of learning was quite the asset.
“What do we do?” Potter asks, and Draco suddenly finds himself in the strange position of having to come up with a cunning plan involving him teaming up with his former arch-nemesis.
“Shall we…spend a few minutes doing our shopping separately?” he proposed. “For…reasons.”
“I brought some blood from all three victims. Could you have a look and confirm it’s the same poison that killed all three? And if you can figure out how it might have entered their bodies, that wouldn’t go amiss either.”
“Potter, stop being ridiculous!”
But Potter was wrong, had to be, since Draco carried that knowledge with him wherever he went. Every look thrown his way told him so, every whispered word. He scratched at his wrist, digging his nails in, but a hand grabbed his to stop him, so Draco snarled and banged his head against the wall again. And again, and again, and again, until it felt as though his skull might split, and even then he kept going, until-
“Luna, what are
Harry bowed in ridiculous fashion. “I do try.”
Could you be any vaguer?”
tones,” Blaise interrupted him, “maybe you’d be so kind as to let the certified
“Bit of experimenting for the shop,” Weasley told him. “Tried to spell them to form words when people first start eating them, but for some reason, the bloody things can’t tell the difference between eating and touching. Only ever got them to manage one letter, too – not exactly enough for some sort of festive message.”
“Maybe we shouldn’t tell them,” Weasley suggests. He’s looking faintly nauseous. “Not just yet.”
Potter probably didn't, in fact, at least not all of it, but Draco just wanted the conversation over with so he could focus on the potion. To his irritation, Potter kept right on talking.
On those days when Draco felt he needed to hurt, they would meet in the bathroom in the evening. At first, Draco communicated his need by narrowing his eyes at Potter across the Great Hall during dinner. Soon, however, Potter started anticipating him – because he looked more agitated in class, Draco supposed – and heading Draco off before dinner. Once, it happened when Potter was with Weasley and Granger, and Potter said something to them with a smile and a small wave before stepping right up to Draco. The two other members of the Golden Trio didn't seem surprised at all. Weasley rolled his eyes and Granger smiled fondly at her boyfriend before they turned and continued on their way.
“Is that why you’re wearing Slytherin colors?”
saved my soul from the grammar devil and his comma minions.
They try roll after roll. Goyle’s chosen flavors confound them, and Harry could swear Molly giggles a little after trying Ernie’s boozy creation. Hermione’s tiramisu roll is apparently awful. They both fawn over Luna’s unusual flavor combination of blackberry, basil and lavender, which she has somehow managed to finish despite her whimsically slow approach. Draco’s pink champagne and raspberry roll gets high marks as well, though Molly does comment on the wetness of his filling, like he had feared. Then, finally, they try the ginger spice and maple cream roll Harry has worked so hard on. He holds his breath.
, has taken to chugging the gin he used for flavoring. It’s all an emotional mess, dotted with Pansy’s occasional pointed questions and Ron’s repeated inquiries of “Er, mate, are you sure that the napkin there is supposed to be inside the roll?” to an unconcerned Greg Goyle.
“Me too,” Draco admits. Then he scowls, because agreeing with Potter isn’t exactly normal either, and does a good job of ramming his bony shoulder into Potter’s as he walks past him.
“Friends, then,” Harry said, and stuck out his hand. “But,” he said as Draco shook it and tried not to to feel overwhelmed, “I have conditions. Not on the friendship. On the other thing.”
“Or murder,” Blaise said. “Perhaps murder would do it.”
The first time that Draco and Potter spy on Pansy with the invisibility cloak, things get a bit strange. For one, Pansy spends way too much time in the girls’ bathroom, touching up her make-up, and the two of them nearly fall asleep from boredom. And then there’s the issue that…well, there’s not exactly a whole lot of space under that cloak of Potter’s.
A moment later, Draco forgot all about stasis spells, because Granger had raised Potter’s left arm.
“Worth the risk,” Potter said cheerfully and continued his approach, dragging Draco along.
“Wouldn’t put it past her. Dumbledore had an odd sense of humor, but maybe she inherited it along with the post.”
He snorted inelegantly. “I’m not getting anywhere, which is decidedly
this,” he repeated, sounding desperate.
“I need a writing utensil and –”
“I don't know,” Draco whispered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Does he chew with his mouth open?” asked Philomena.
“And you’ve always been Malfoy, and we should change that. What’s your point?”
“Alright,” said Potter in a way that told Draco he had no idea what to do with that information.
“Yes,” Draco agreed.
Right, there was nothing for it. Harry took a deep breath, knelt, plunged one arm into the nearest gnomehole-
“No, it can’t,” Potter said, burying his head in his hands. “You know what makes sense about this? Absolutely fuck all.”
come from?
“I agree.” Hermione sighed, stuffed her gloved hands in her pockets and then took them right back out. “Look,” she said softly.
Much as Harry might not have meant to make it one, it was an order to Draco. He followed it, feeling Harry’s breath on his face as Harry started tracing slow circles with his fingertips. It felt good, soothing. But then Harry’s lips pressed slowly against his, and Draco froze, remembering that there wasn’t a locked door between them and the rest of the world, as there usually was when Harry kissed him. This was out in the open. Someone could have walked in at any time. Someone could have witnessed what was between them, and then where would they be?
Potter snorted. “This entire thing is confusing.”
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, and he stared at her, feeling lost, until she shook her head at him, gently patted his arm, and walked away.
“Malfoy –”
“Yes,” said Granger. “I agree with Draco.”
“Yes, well, while my stick-in-the-mud co-host is busy being mind-numbingly boring, let’s take a look at the rankings. At the very bottom of the leaderboard is Hermione Granger-”
The young wizard nodded absently and let the apprentice healer maneuver him into the chair she had conjured next to Draco’s bed. Meanwhile, Madam Pomfrey lectured Severus.
“Brilliant,” Draco parroted obediently before it occurred to him to wonder when exactly he’d agreed to let Harry take the lead.
“Well, much as I don’t enjoy admitting it, even I don’t know everything, Harry,” she sighed.
“I swear, Weasley, you come up with the most absurd reasoning.” Draco shook his head.
“Fine,” Severus hissed. He still looked furious but was obviously trying to control himself. Conjuring himself another chair, he sat opposite Harry, who was staring at Draco with empty eyes.
“Yes, well.” Harry tries to say something, possibly funny or clever, maybe insightful, he’s not picky. But nothing will come out, and so he ends up looking like an idiot with his mouth open and Draco’s hand clutched in both of his own for no good reason.
year party that night, which Draco stayed as far away from as possible, despite the efforts of Pansy and Blaise to get him to go. They weren’t idiots, they had noticed that he’d seemed to be doing better for a while and that his mood had now swung back to worse. But they had no idea what the cause of these changes was, and while their efforts to distract him were admirable, Draco hadn’t been able to take many of them before he had to isolate himself.
“Good.” Potter gives him a bright smile and turns to Blaise, who does not get a smile, Draco notes with satisfaction. “So why wasn’t
“Right,” said Potter after they knocked, touching his face. “My glamour is holding up well enough?”
Prompt #17 – A “Welcome to Hogsmeade” sign
Maybe part of him also wanted to draw out the time until he had to leave for good. Draco wondered if it could still be considered a subconscious act if you kind-of-sort-of knew you were doing it.
Malfoy was flung backwards in a high arc and hit the wet floor. His wand landed somewhere in a corner, behind a loo. A surprised “Wow” escaped Harry as he quickly returned to his cover. Until now, the spells from the book had been mostly harmless; this one was far more powerful. Still, he kept his wand at the ready. You never knew.
Which meant that it was Harry in particular seeing the painting that had embarrassed him.
“Why the buggering fuck does she need four of these for a locked room that has nothing but

“Potter, what are you
“Funny,” he said. “I’ve never seen a lord whose house elves don’t obey him. If they did, you would have had them meet us at the gate instead of doing it yourself.”
tarts. Pansy Parkinson be asking for one and saying she be trying to make friends.”
In between working with a very volatile partial antidote, cleaning up shards of exploded vials from the floor, and Draco enduring multiple barbed remarks and hateful looks from the parents of one of his patients, they had made progress with the magi-chemical indicator. However, it had raised as many questions as it had answered. They hadn’t managed to create anything that told them in how many ways the poison could potentially change, but they had found an indicator that revealed the poison had already changed its molecular structure – twice. One change, of course, was the one that allowed it to attack specific cells in the body, but Draco was at a loss for what the second change was. It worried him. The last thing he needed was Potter still being in danger because there was some other damage to his body that Draco hadn’t found out about.
“Oh, right.” Potter glanced down at himself like he could figure out the answer that way. Then he gave Draco a weak but guileless smile and leaned back comfortably. “Okay.”
“To sort of, er, soften him up a little?” Harry thought about it. “That might work.”
Granger’s mouth formed a relieved smile before she made a pleased noise and pulled a small silver rectangle from her handbag. She walked over to an empty bit of wall within Potter’s field of vision and slapped the rectangle on the wall with her flat palm. It expanded and rippled, and a moment later Draco was looking at a peaceful, snow-covered yard through glass that was rapidly growing ice crystals on the outside.
“Well,” Draco said, “it’s part of the job.”
“That’s essentially all there was to it,” Blaise said as he directed the silvery memory back into its vial. “She was forced to abandon him shortly after we left. Struggled to conjure a Patronus for help, but she managed it eventually. They couldn’t get the fire under control until it was far too late.”
“Well, sort of. We’ll have to do our search before it’s time for those defences to kick in.”
“So…are you saying we shouldn’t even bother?”
Eventually, he settled on, “Where were you for two years?”
But right now, all they needed was each other.
“But it would affect hers,” Draco pointed out. “The woman is a terrible liar.”
“Mulled wine. I’m shocked you had to ask. Anyway, Ron thought our poisoner might have put up the barrier to talk to Orval – maybe they were trying to get something out of him, or maybe they wanted to gloat. Either way, it makes sense, since we’re going with the theory that Orval knew he’d been poisoned and didn’t have long. The poisoner might have just...told him. Made sure Orval knew who was taking him down.”
to be, I’ve already done this seventeen bloody times.”
“I…oh. I know you and Ron have said things, occasionally, but I always thought you two were just joking because you were annoyed that I talked about him so much,” he admitted. “And I thought that there was no way you might be right because you don’t usually see him, so how could you know anything about it?”
Selwyn, who had started to walk away from them, froze.
“No,” he said after a long moment of expectant silence. “Sorry to disappoint, but you lack feathers and a beak, Blaise. Feel free to have a seat and enlighten me as to how I’ve wronged you.”
,” she said, watching intently.
“I’m sorry, what?” Draco’s eyes flicked to the only diagnostic spell he hadn’t cancelled yet. “The stasis didn’t –”
“Hm,” said Potter and started rifling through his notebook, which Draco knew to be empty. “Let me see…I don’t think that’s what June said the last time she was questioned…”
“This is…” Kingsley Shacklebolt looks hesitant. “Interesting.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Draco muttered and set the bottle down with care.
Potter shrugs sheepishly. “Well, you know. Parkinson is offering Bakewell tarts, Nott started playing Wizard’s Chess with Ron-”
“Been better,” Draco grumbles, and then he yelps very, very loudly. Harry drops his cookie cutter in alarm.
“Yes, fine.” Parvati rolled her eyes at him. “As long as you make sure I don’t have another complaint in my inbox afterward.”
Hermione sighed again. “If I had to guess – because Death couldn’t just grab you and physically toss you out. The younger Harry was on his way out, and he took the older Harry with him once they were combined and Death rid himself of both at once.”
“Merlin’s sake, why, Penny?” Harry asked, suddenly sounding incredibly upset. “Poisoning people…
“Why in the bloody fuck did I decide to pitch myself back into the Veil the first time, then, when I had no way of knowing it would work because the time loop hadn’t even happened yet?” Harry asked. “Wouldn’t have made much sense, would it?”
“He must be a very unpleasant young man,” said Philomena.
Harry has yet another five glowing on his shirt, while Draco has a three and a seven, marking a tie between them. They are making their way towards the Great Hall for dinner, while back at the tent, some of the student volunteers cut the ombre cakes that are at least halfway decent and pass them out to the audience.
“I still don’t understand,” he said tonelessly. “Death isn’t supposed to be something you can just bloody
“It’s fine,” Draco interrupted him. “I was planning to…to talk to…Granger. I’ll do that now.”
Potter’s face fell. Once again, Draco counted himself lucky that Potter wasn’t wearing his own face at the moment, because seeing that kicked-puppy expression combined with earnest green eyes and a knitted forehead with a lightning bolt scar would have murdered him with guilt.
“Do shut up and write, Potter.” Draco glanced up and realized Harry had never even started and was instead standing there, looking wide-eyed at the already existing notes on his arm, marker hovering in mid-air.
Potter sat up straighter, which Draco took to mean he was feeling a bit better. He stood and plucked the card out of Weasley’s hands. “Enough of that,” he said. “Now, should we start figuring out how to investigate those poisonings, or just drink until we forget all about the bloody time loop.”

“Yes,” she said, “I think that would be best. What’s your name?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Then who?”
Granger agreed, and soon they were through the Floo and on their way through the bustling corridors to the third-floor lab. Draco took a few minutes to stop by the ward proper, talk to one of the nurses, and look at his notes on the current patients to double-check that they were correct and complete, which would make things a lot easier for Victoria.
I've been trying to keep up on replying to comments, but it's been almost impossible to do that AND write AND prepare for Christmas AND do my day job. Please know that I do read them, and every single one has been so lovely and inspirational, and I'm very happy that you're all invested in the story. Thanks so very much!!
“It eases your conscience.” Harry sounded understanding, and not like he was judging, even though he should have been the first one to do so.
Granger was there, making notes on something she was holding, surrounded by a veritable sea of clocks – all different types and different sizes, but all of them creating an extremely annoying chorus of ticking noises. She whirled around as she heard the door opening. When she spotted Draco, she lifted her wand and muffled the ticking noises, which he was grateful for.
“But you should,” he insisted, trying desperately to blink the tears out of his eyes. Thunder sounded in the background.
“I swear I won't. I'll stick to my story about us talking about war things, which, by the way, if you want to actually do that, I wouldn't be opposed.” Harry ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair. “I wouldn't mind people thinking we're friends.”
“Buglirg,” said Ermintrude. “That’s a much better name than Leroy.”
“Our plan is that I take the time sand bubble, wrap myself in my cloak and throw myself through the Veil.”
Draco went over to the tree and collected the gifts he had bought. “Weasley,” he said as he handed them out. “Hermione.”
“Very.” She sighed. “And he’s not wrong, I should have told him days ago, especially since you and Harry both already knew.”
There was another 8
“Yes, of course. I have literally no way of understanding it, so I can’t say with certainty what happened in there. The best guess I can make is that…well, that you annoyed Death something fierce.”
said Potter. “Sorry, Blaise, that may have been my fault. I really did tell him something he needed time to process.”
“This’ll be interesting, you know,” he said.
“You’re  what?” Blaise asked with uncharacteristic gentleness.
“Sure. I’d just like to get the blood first though.” He dug in his pocket for the muggle hypodermic needle and syringe he needed. When he held it up, Granger’s eyes narrowed.
“Alright there Harry?” asks someone.
The deadly quiet was almost unbearable. Parvati stared, wide-eyed and frozen in place, and then the fire turned green again and Harry appeared.
“If she does know somehow, do you think she’ll tell anyone?”
“Draco,” Harry said, very gently. “I… I miss you. I miss what we had. Tell me how I can fix this.”
“Right, I’m going to run up to Draco’s library and figure out if there are any spells for this sort of situation.”
“Right, but still. As long as the poison goes.” Granger bit her lip and reached out to take Potter’s hand. “Ready, Blaise.”
“I never understood you,” Draco says. “Not until now. I never could, and now…now it seems easy.”
There was so much wrong with what Blaise was saying, Draco didn’t even know where to begin. "Four of you?" he eventually managed.
"Hold on, you mean to say those are all separate spells?"
can’t help but feel the need to remind you that while the contestants have no wands, I do,” Parkinson says, syrupy-sweet. “And I’m not afraid to use it.”
“You need to eat better,” Harry said, skimming fingertips over the spot where Draco's pointy hipbones were hidden under his trousers. “You're so thin. It worries me.”
Everyone was quiet again and looked at him. The rain continued to drum monotonously against the windows.
Someone touched the back of Harry’s head. He looked up pathetically, right into Hermione’s kind eyes. “Don’t worry, Harry, we’ll get you sorted out.” Her tone was so reassuring that Harry felt a tiny bit better.
A new sensation registered, burning. He could no longer move his head the way he needed. Potter was
“Oh,” he said, and his face fell. “’Thought of you, love, Pansy’. Well, that’s a bit boring. You two are still together?”
“And what were the three of you doing?”
“What? No!”
Harry nodded, and when he spotted no more owls on the horizon, he wrapped his arms around Draco and held him tightly. “Thought you’d be more upset about having your life and wellbeing threatened, actually.”
Outside, lightning streaked across the sky. Draco's heart gave a jump in his chest and then clenched. There was no way, no way he could ask Harry for anything more than what he was already getting out of this. He got to his feet and looked into Harrys eyes.
“Harry!”
“I have work to get done anyway, I’ve spent long enough indulging your hopeless denial.” She gave him a wave, then opened the door and froze. “Oh,” Draco heard her saying. “Hello, Potter, I was just on my way out.”
Draco considered that.
Draco isn’t actually sure. He’s never heard of an insanity bug before, but it’s the only logical explanation.
“You may be onto something there,” Blaise sighed.
Even though it had been more than two years ago, he remembered the day in detail, down to the fact that it had been a soggy cheese sandwich he’d been in the process of eating when one of the other trainee healers had burst into the room and simply shouted it out.
Draco remained silent.
“Bit rude, to just ask like that,” Ermintrude opined and looked at Harry with mild disapproval.
Eventually, when they’re absolutely utterly sure the two of them are gone, Draco and Potter untangle their limbs. Potter pulls off the invisibility cloak and stares at Draco, who stares back with wide eyes.
“Well, bollocks.”
“I’ll count to five hundred thirty-seven,” Weasley promised and went for the Floo powder.
“That’ll be easy,” Potter says. “I’ll just ask her to write down her ideas about reforming the Muggle Studies curriculum. She’ll be busy for days.”
“I found them like this,” said Neville.
Draco thought.
“Ron,” said Granger disapprovingly.
“Not until I know what it’s about,” he insisted. “At least in general terms.”
“I dunno. I suppose it might just be the sort of thing you do for a hen night.”
Malfoy looked up at him, his light gray eyes pleading, wide with pain and fear. He managed to raise one hand, but Harry didn’t react, just stood there, frozen.
the drink.”
“Draco, we should maybe talk about this.”
After Potter had opened his eyes, he had been dazed and disoriented, and it had taken him almost ten minutes until he’d reacted to their presence. When he had been in a shape to start speaking, Granger had unceremoniously thrown Draco and Blaise out of her office. Rationally, Draco understood her decision. The rest of him, however, had wanted to throw a fit the likes of which hadn’t been seen since his third year at Hogwarts, because there were just so many questions he wanted the answer to, and waiting for them when they were so
never figure it out?”
The other man tossed his own balled up robe into the laundry chute and walked over to where Draco was standing, hands propped against the wall, head low. “I just meant – I know how much it sucks, losing a patient. Go home, have some tea, go to bed.”
“Well, er, you see, we never talked about it, so I didn’t want to assume…”
Potter’s eyes damn near bulged out of his head. “Malfoy, are you…are you saying you’ve never had street food?”
Weasley makes a strange gurgling sound.
“I’m really not!” she protested.
I didn’t show up for my shift five hundred times in a row.”
"Does it...I mean, at this stage of pregnancy, does it really show a lot, though?" he asked.
it isn’t dangerous.”
“I could never hate you.”
Harry gave a resigned nod. It was all the direct communication he felt capable of at the moment. All he wanted right now was some peace.
“Nothing.”
“Enough trouble to last a lifetime.” Slim fingers caressed him, wrapped around him, and hot breath made him shudder.
“You probably figured out there was no way to get help because Clearwater had barred the exit – presumably it happened somewhat similarly to last night, first time around – and you thought maybe the time sand would let you travel back to the department a few hours earlier when people were still there and could help you,” Draco suggested. “But you also knew the poison would render you unconscious soon enough, so you wrote something about that on your hand to give yourself the best chance of survival.”
have been all.”
Draco sighs. “I know you didn’t, Harry. Calm down.”
“I’ll have to write a thank-you note to whoever it was that talked sense into you.”
Draco approved.
“Very,” Harry said. “I think he was attempting to serenade her by the time I left.”
“Seriously?” Draco nearly dropped the wreath in his exasperation. “Are we back to that?”
“We got a second one,” Hermione said. Suddenly, she looked sad. “For Susan. I thought she might enjoy something with a bit of Christmas spirit to look at. We were planning to go visit her later, if you two would like to –”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not coincidence, maybe, but…it’s the Realm of the Dead, Draco, it doesn’t play by the same rules. Maybe there’s an explanation, but frankly, I’m not too concerned about it right now because I haven’t got the time for it, and it’s already worked seventeen times, so considering that the alternative is both of us dying, I’m perfectly willing to risk it.”
“What Harry?” Parvati asked blankly. “I don’t know any…well, one, but he died, so who are you talking about?”
“What…” she croaked. “How…”
“Oh,” he breathed, eyes widening.
“Hey!” Potter says, sounding annoyed, and that’s at least a bit more normal, but it barely registers. Draco stops dead, nearly dropping his book at the sight that meets him as he steps out from the semi-darkness of the shelves. There, at the table that was empty ten minutes ago, sits the most unlikely assortment of 8
Potter sighed. “Not important right now. I'll tell you later. Why are you sitting here?”
Draco was completely bewildered. When Eden knocked on one of the doors leading away from the room, he turned to Potter. “What in the world is a hen party?”
“Do you like it, Potter?” he asked with a voice he tried to pretend wasn’t shaky, attempting a neutral, unaffected expression. But Harry didn’t respond. He looked almost…horrified. “I see that you don’t,” Draco went on, and oh fuck, he was drawling now, falling back into the old, familiar role of his Hogwarts-era self, and he didn’t seem to be able to stop. “I can’t say I’m surprised; your tastes always did seem to run a bit on the pedestrian side.”
“Send an owl,” Potter said. “To June. We can follow it and figure out where she is. Works sometimes, if the target is nearby.”
“You did?” Harry asked, sounding intrigued.
“What? No. I’m not leaving my friends in the grasp of some madness. We should tell McGonagall.”
“Not what I meant. It’s just a psychological thing; generally, if people are content, they produce better work.”
While he’s whipping his egg whites and sugar into shape with energetic wand movements, Harry thinks that he’s lucky he has learned to tune out Hermione’s constant nervous muttering before tests over the years, because she is working at the station behind his, and she’s doing it now. Instead of History of Magic facts, she’s reciting the steps to creating her tiramisu swiss roll at lightning speed. She’s clearly nervous. The entire thing is her brainchild, after all.
“She gets like that,” Harry tells him in explanation. “She’s even worse during exams week, don’t mind her.”
“I need this,” he said bluntly, making himself vulnerable. “I don't know what I'd do if you stopped.”
She raised an eyebrow at him. “Am I wrong?”
“Did you…poison
Draco’s eyebrows shot up. “I thought that room was always locked?”
“Merlin
“Poppy, you don’t understand! You don’t understand the magnitude of what Potter did.”
"Go away!" Draco groaned. "Right this moment, if you please."
but most of them had happened back at Hogwarts, when he hadn’t been more than a self-absorbed child who thought the world owed him everything. He had never had reason to examine their rivalry any closer. Then there had been a war on, and Potter had been his only hope of escaping the nightmare Draco had found himself in, so it had made sense to think about him so much.
Swallowing hard, Draco nodded. He ripped out a blade of grass and twirled it between his fingers. This was really happening. They were formalizing their arrangement.
Draco nodded. “I need to get over to the lab and start helping Victoria.”
“It…might.”
“Yes. She’s been doing most of the work, really.”
“I doubt it means much, but…” Draco shook his head. “It’s strange, and I don’t know what to make of it.”
“I will.”
“Stop!” Harry hissed eventually, because his shoulder was now in considerable pain, and as far as he could tell, his arm hadn’t moved an inch.
There was a flash of green and Draco felt like he'd been punched in the stomach. Several people screamed, and from the corner of his eye, he could see Potter going pale.
Smith pulled a face. Blaise winced. Granger looked fascinated.
“We haven’t even kissed yet,” Potter protests, and it’s the
“Well, yes, that’s what I just said.”
, so he’s probably not very happy with me right now.”
“Yes! Pansy Parkinson be telling the elves that she be wanting to be making friends with Harry Potter’s friends. She be asking how to show that she be
A very long silence spread through the room. Even the tree in the corner seemed suddenly careful not to rustle its needles. Draco looked down, then back up, and realized he was finished with all the essential parts of Potter’s health check. He cleared his throat.
“Yes.” Draco wished he could run his hands through his hair or even just tap his finger to the outside of his thigh, but he was wearing gloves smeared with blood and bile and other things, and he couldn’t help but think that taking them off now would be akin to giving up.
Oh, fuck. Pub night had been two…no, three days ago, and that had been when…ah.
“I am absolutely coming with you,” said Potter, “because it’s
Severus crossed his arms and looked at him, silent and clearly angry. He seemed to be thinking hard.
If it had been anyone else, Draco would have been annoyed at having to play teacher, but he thought Granger might actually be able to keep up with his explanation, and that could only be beneficial. He wasn’t arrogant enough to believe he was infallible.
“It's okay,” Harry kept murmuring, and “Trust me, Draco,” and “You're safe, I'm here,” and he seemed to know at the same time everything and nothing about what he was doing to Draco, deep down inside. Draco couldn't control his shaking, and Merlin, he needed, he
“Draco asked me to have a look at his wards while he’s gone,” Kingsley said. “I wasn’t expecting anyone else to be here.”
“Isn’t it obvious?” Granger – Hermione – frowned at him, and then generously at the rest of them. “I didn’t cast the spell to hide the writing until Zach, Penelope, Blaise and Marielle had already had a chance to see it. There is no telling what might happen if our poisoner found out exactly what the clues are talking about. They might decide making sure Harry never wakes up is in their best interest.”
Harry stops, considers that flavor combination, and briefly wonders whether Goyle just decided to pack all his favorite flavors into his creation at once.
“It is absolutely not.”
“Brilliant!”
“Just don't go,” Draco whispered.
There was a moment of silence. They both knew why they were there, but it was difficult to breach the topic. Draco waited – because after all, Harry was the Gryffindor – but when there was only more silence and some awkward shifting, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
“Alright, so the poison is metamorphic,” she said after a few minutes. “Are you trying to find an antidote or figure out the mechanism?”
“We should get Harry out of here first, though,” Neville interrupted. “Any ideas, Luna?”
They left the Space Room and walked along the much brighter corridor to what seemed to be Granger’s office. One glance told Draco that Potter had been right – she looked tense and worried and somehow conflicted.
When he came home, Potter was there, but he wasn’t the only one. Susan Bones was sitting in the kitchen with him, tear tracks drying on her face as they talked.
I had originally planned on this being the last chapter, plus a short epilogue. Because of the kind feedback, however, I was inspired to write more, so this story is now longer than I thought it would be. Thanks to everyone who has commented, and please continue to do so.
“Possibly. And he might have chosen to let it go, but then you came through the Veil again with a bursting bubble of time sand, Harry, and I think maybe he’d had enough and tried to kick you out again as best he could. It’s just, he couldn’t affect you directly because you were wearing the invisibility cloak.”
Granger nodded. “The same antidote wouldn’t work to cleanse both forms of the poison.”
“Er, no.”
Then Pansy said, “Wait, you’re not together? How is that possible? Blaise and I had a bet going about when you two idiots would finally move in together.”
to the ceiling, shiny silver and gold, which might have looked attractive but would get so very annoying to get down  again, and even if Draco waited until the sticking charms wore off, he'd constantly have streamers falling down around his ears until they were finally done.
“Look at me,” Harry asked, and when Draco did, he saw nothing but green and felt a hand in his hair and another fisting the front of his shirt. Harry tasted of sharp alcohol and fruity snacks. Draco fell into him as they kissed and kissed, and he closed his eyes and forgot where they were and what they had been talking about. There was only Harry, and Draco was so willing, so eager to let himself be taken care of. There were deep, free breaths the likes of which he hadn’t felt in years, if ever.
"Splendid," Blaise said as soon as they'd hurried over. “We received word from your lovely lab assistant Victoria –”
him on His Lordship's orders. His father, standing by, watching with sunken eyes and unable to help him. His mother, looking so much older than she was.
Took me a while, but I'm at a point where I'll be able to write pretty consistently, so the rest of this should not have a hugely long wait between chapters. I hope you all enjoyed your holidays and are having a lovely new year. Thanks for being patient! ❤
Draco had never seen anything quite as beautiful as the two slender vials of swirling turquoise liquid sitting next to a bubble of suspended, glittering time sand.
Potter.” Draco stopped pacing and closed his eyes, took one deep breath, two, three. He wished his racing heart would stop, but he didn’t have time to wait for it to happen. “Right, we need something that can break a spell that can’t be broken, and it’s got to be something here in the department.”
“What are you two
the one who’s advocating caution?”
“That isn’t what –” Draco started, but Selwyn interrupted him.
Granger huffed a small laugh that lacked humor. “Tell Harry that.”
Harry groans.
Draco opened his mouth to keep arguing but then closed it again. He had no desire to start an argument over the matter, and Harry was probably right – the chances of anyone spying on them here were enormously low. Besides, there was the fact that looking at glamour-less Harry was infinitely more pleasing than the alternative.
Draco had been planning on that anyway. Five years ago, he would have laughed at anyone suggesting that he might voluntarily see a mind healer, but Clarke was damn good at her job. She
“Or Ron,” Harry pointed out. “Problem is that there’s no guarantee she hasn’t dosed the the whole bloody Auror department as well, or anyone else who’s likely to come after her.”
“Sorry,” Harry repeated, looking contrite, and picked up another patch. He checked the writing carefully before tossing it next to the floor-window. With a
Weasley stops dead. “Harry’s doing the very same thing. Never sticks around anymore, always off to somewhere secret.”
“Sorry, sorry, I know I’m a few minutes late, Doris cornered me in the elevator, and I was forced to ride up and back down three times, talking standardised broom bristle curvature the entire way.” He smiled apologetically and dropped into the visitor’s chair in front of Draco’s desk at the very same moment Draco’s heart dropped into the general vicinity of his kneecaps.
"Breathe, yeah?" Harry touched his hand, pulled out his wand and started on his way down one of the corridors. Draco stood frozen in the entrance chamber for a five-count, then took several deep breaths.
“Oh,” Hermione said, sounding thrilled, “That’s got to be a book.”
There was no signature – not that one was necessary. Draco gritted his teeth and tried his hardest not to turn and look. Instead, he focused on the small box he’d set on his empty plate and tried to ignore the curious looks being thrown his way by his housemates. No one sat with Draco these days, but lately, the younger students hadn’t been keeping their distance quite so drastically either. They pretended to ignore him, of course, but the fact of Draco receiving gifts was novelty enough to capture their attention.
“Much as I’d love to be the one working on a drinkable antidote, we both know that if anyone has a chance of puzzling it out, it’s you. Once we have that, investigating the poisonings won’t be nearly as dangerous as it is now.”
“Well, would you prefer blissful ignorance?” Potter snaps, which…is actually a good point, Draco has to admit. He can’t very well ignore the strange goings-on, not when every other Slytherin in his year seems to be involved.
“Because you’ve got the observational power of a pumpkin, Harry. Also, you’re completely irrational when it comes to him.”
“Granger, don’t you understand how the…the…I need something to write.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hm?” Draco asked, rather distractedly, because volatile potions ingredients and wandering attention were not a good combination.
“Yes,” she agreed, and stood as well, brushing snow off her shoulders. “The ministry is nearby, actually. If you like, we can walk from here.”
Draco.
“Yes,” Draco said.
“Yes, of course, the kitten, Potter, are you some sort of simpleton? Can you not even make out the subject of this piece? How dull.”
ed out of existence at that moment. Everyone looked to Weasley, whose cheeks were bulging like a chipmunks. Miraculously, he managed to squeeze out “Hold on,” through a mouthful of food.
“It’s brilliant,” he said sincerely.
Draco moves his hand, but only to stroke strands of Harry’s hair away from his forehead, gently, like a mother might. He gives Harry a long, thoughtful look. For a long time, they are silent. Their gazes meet and part, again and again.
There was a different sort of ripple in mid-air. A second later, Clearwater was standing there, looking displeased and pale and not at all like Draco had imagined their mysterious opponent.
She frowned and her shoulders slumped. “I’m sorry, Harry. I’ve tried to make it as nice as possible –”
“Yes Ron, I’m talking about Draco Malfoy, the tragic victim of circumstance who was cleared of any crimes by the Wizengamot, among others through the testimony by fellow contestant Harry Potter.”
Prompt #1 – A snowman in a red telephone box
Of course. The peace never lasted.
“Draco, those numbers are
“Give him another one.”
“Fair point,” Potter conceded, looking remorseful.
Harry looks up and into the face of Draco Malfoy, who’s looking back at him from his own station with a mixture of concern and bemusement.
“They tightened the after-hours security for that ward because there was a slew of complaints about valuables being stolen from helpless or unconscious patients – jewellery, mostly. Kenneth Spindlewheel had his late father’s wristwatch in his possession when he was brought in, which had great sentimental value to him in addition to the galleons it was worth – I don’t blame him for threatening to sue the hospital. The thefts stopped after the warding spells were changed to allow only healers working in the ward access to it.”
“Set!” shrieks Pansy Parkinson.
“Exactly,” she said. “There was a cabinet full of them that was damaged during the battle that happened in the department. The cabinet was hit, with a Reducto or a Stupefy or something similar; it fell and shattered, and they all broke. And then all of the pieces flew back together, and it stood there just the way it had been. And then, it shattered again, and it reversed the damage, and shattered again…”
is a rock star and a wonderful human being.
“Fine,” said Potter, turned, and marched toward a different lamppost.
“Oh, Merlin no,” Draco said and lunged for his sleeve when Potter made to approach the closest lamp. “If you do this, I will leave you here and your tongue will fall off because you won’t be able to pronounce any spells to get it loose.”
She smiled. “I’ve whipped him into shape quite nicely, don’t worry,” she assured him. “And speaking of partners, does Susan know?”
"Yes. Well, no."
Draco’s half-smile faded when he thought of something.
“Good.”
“It means Parvati has asked me to be a consultant without clearing it with Robards because he’d say no.”
Granger rolled her eyes. “No, they didn’t really think at all before trying to just Vanish the entire thing. It didn’t occur to them that you can’t Vanish time like it’s an object.”
Draco tried not to smile when Harry stopped and tugged him closer. “That’s cheating,” he said, though it wasn’t a complaint. Harry, clearly not overly concerned with whether kissing was cheating or not, proceeded to do a whole lot of just that, and just like that, Draco forgot all about his head being cold.
“Yes, of course,” Harry said. “Not always on purpose, but he does laugh a lot.”
“I see.” Draco frowned. There was no good way of bringing up what Blaise had told him and make it sound casual. “Er, Blaise said he heard a sentence or two in passing. Apparently, my name was mentioned?”
There was a very long moment of silence.
Draco led the way toward where the stall with the scented candles was, but halfway there, Harry said, “Oh, look,” and dragged him over to one of the stalls, this one selling delicate ornaments. “This can go on the tree we are
“Hermione thinks that means I’m in the seventeenth iteration,” said Harry.
When Draco turned back to Parvati, he noticed that she had her hand on her wand.
“This one’s addressed to you.” Draco handed him the second letter and allowed the owl to find a perch.
, hadn’t been saved by anyone in return.
“She’s a Goblin, she’ll be fine. However, you failed to mention that you expect me to be mining treasures for you.”
nervous.
“I’m rather upset at you.”
suddenly, to hurt Draco – and maybe it should have alarmed him, but he felt flattered instead. Silk brushed against his skin as his sleeves slid down his arms, and his nipples hardened in the cool air. Harry had taken out his wand and crawled behind Draco. He had one hand once again on Draco's shoulder.
“Look up,” he says instead, quite gently, and Draco does.
For a few silent seconds, both of them looked at the unconscious Draco. Suddenly, Severus’ head shot up and his eyes flashed dangerously as he called out, “Speaking of Potter!” He spun around and approached Harry, who was still distraught and sobbing occasionally. Holly seemed to be trying to calm him, but she couldn’t quite get through to him. He was clearly under shock. Severus didn’t seem to care, however. He decisively pushed aside the assistant, crouched in front of the Gryffindor, took him by the shoulders, and shook him hard.
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Behind your back? Would you like to move in with us so we can be sure to do it in front of you if the topic happens to come up? Or should we just spend every moment you’re not with us pretending we don’t know who this ‘Harry’ person is?”
They were still holding each other's hands. Draco lowered his head,
“Well, it’s what she said. I left it alone, because she was getting that
Hermione reached out and grasped his arm. "You can walk with me for a few minutes, Draco, and
“Parvati,” said Granger from the door.
“Well, yes, that was the point of it,” Harry muttered.
Draco took a deep breath.
“Yes. It only lasts for about four and a half hours, but it creates such a nice atmosphere, don’t you think?” She smiled tenderly at the flames.
“Well spotted.”
“Brilliant. We got one from Charlotte Fletcher, so we can compare the two later.” Potter was silent for a beat and then, because he had no subtlety whatsoever, added, “Are things alright between the two of you, then?”
He opened his mouth, throat dry, and forced out a single word. “Fine.”
He had been wondering when it would finally, truly hit him.
“What did you two chat about?” he asked.
“Her memory is just…obliterated,” Hermione told them as they made their way through the park together, snow crunching beneath their boots. “Gone completely.”
So she takes a deep breath, whispers something to her friend – who puts her hand discreetly onto her wand – and marches through the door.
“Well, I am, and I’m here a whole lot these days, so I’m going to decorate.”
“I’ve already found out a few things,” Granger added. “Lyman Selwyn, for a very brief time, dated Penelope Clearwater, and Zach was – or at least felt – insulted by Lena Fletcher and told her she’d regret it, in front of witnesses. Blaise has a mother who’s quite adept with poisons. As for Marielle, I’ve sent a few requests for information to the French Ministry, but I haven’t heard back yet.”
is better than raspberry chocolate cake.
“What? It’s snowing, it’s practically required.”
“I…well, I suppose it is. But how are you going to get it to take you to the exact point in time you came out of the Veil from the cairn?”
“Oh, honestly, I can take it down while you’re here if it truly offends your sensibilities that much.”
“Kill me,” Harry said desperately. “Or run into the kitchen and fetch me my wand, so I can do it. Wait, is it possible to Avada Kedavra oneself?”
Draco tried not to be offended, because he had a fairly good idea of the place her worries were coming from. “I wouldn’t be proposing this if I wasn’t sure it’ll work,” he said.
“Do you love flying as much as he does?” Ermintrude asked pointedly.
“Merlin, do I want to find this guy,” Weasley said, shaking his head. “And then arrange for about an hour along with him in a sound-proofed room.”
“Malfoy, stop!” Potter pleaded with him. “I don't like seeing you do that.”
Someone taps Harry’s shoulder, jerking his attention away. “Can I borrow your wand?” Luna asks, serene smile on her face.
Harry flashed him a smile, which was problematic, because he was wearing his own face now and therefore bypassing Draco’s every defence. “So you
“Oh, this and that.” Babs stuck Draco with a needle, and he somehow managed not to flinch. It reminded him of what they were really looking for.
Twelve. Draco siphoned the layer of yellow-tinted sweat into a prepared vial. Potter continued to sweat.
it was different. He pulled his lip between his teeth, and Draco decided to take it all back because thank Merlin for glamours – his breath was already stuttering, but if he’d seen that while Potter wore his own face, he might have stopped breathing entirely from the sheer want coursing through him.
“I don’t even have words,” Draco muttered, looking as if he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “This better be the last one, else I’m casting high-security anti-owl wards around this place.”
tell anyone,” he emphasised.
“I will leave the cake semi-naked,” Draco says confidently. “Apparently, that’s a thing. Very modern, according to that one magazine Granger brought in.”
Time seems to fly. Harry works as though possessed, slams his sponge into the oven and gets started on his filling. He is hasty, fumbles a bowl, and it falls to the ground as he curses.
“Wideye potion.”
And he buried his fingers in Draco’s silky hair and squeezed his eyes shut, and just before pleasure overtook him, he was flooded with thankfulness that the weather had been shit this night.
doing here?” he asked with a sigh. Had they all planned to meet up here, so they could laugh at Harry’s I-am-maybe-possibly-worthy-of-dating-Draco-Malfoy delusions?
Draco finished with the syringe and conjured up a small patch to stick on the skin. The stasis wouldn’t allow for any healing spells either, since those amplified and sped up the skin’s natural tendency to knit itself back together, and that tendency was currently inert.
“I’ve been meaning to ask – I need to know what your, ah, stance is as far as my living situation is concerned.”
“That’s one intense old lady. I won’t even ask about why she’s calling you ‘Henry’.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Thanks.” He looked down at the calculations he’d just done, and frowned. “I just don’t know if…” He trailed off.
“Dunno. I’d really quite like a boring life.”
“That,” Harry said, “is
“Does that mean you won’t go to Hogsmeade with me?” Potter asks.
“I don’t want this,” he repeated yet again, talking into the crook of Draco’s neck, and for some reason, Draco didn’t mind it one bit, which, oddly enough, intrigued him almost as much as the apparent time loop.
make sense.”
“I practiced these on my forearm,” he informed Draco. His thumb stroked along the line of Draco's neck. “They're safe. Won't leave any permanent marks or anything.”
Of course, once he was a bit older, he probably should have been able to tell that there was a reason he was so very hyperaware of Potter’s every breath on the rare occasions they crossed paths, but really, he’d had other problems.
anyone bake a cake before, and now she sounds as though she knows what she’s talking about.
“I love you,” Harry said, helpless to stop the words.
Draco spent the rest of his day in the lab, making lists and running equations and coordinating with Victoria on what each of them would focus on in their research. When he came home in the evening, he wanted to cry with relief when there was a hot meal and a large cup of tea waiting for him under a stasis charm, even if it came with a side of Hermione Granger and more lists.
Smith’s mouth was open now, as though he had finally realized that he was not the ultimate authority on what was and wasn’t possible in the field of antidote creation.
“Really?” he asked, looking interested. “Hermione said she wasn’t able to get anywhere close to solving it.”
and that the magic masked the fetching blush that the cold air would normally have brought to his face.
“I get that she did what she thought was right,” Potter said abruptly as the lift was moving, “but…
Harry opens his mouth to reply, but it’s then that the judges enter the tent. He is excited to discover that the first one of them is Molly Weasley. Now that he thinks about it, it makes sense – she certainly knows her baking. The second one, shocking him, is Kingsley Shacklebolt. Harry wonders just how the new Minister for Magic got himself roped into this, and who managed to do the roping. It was probably Hermione, or maybe McGonagall. Possibly both.
Weasley pressed his lips together and crossed his arms. “I don’t know,” he said frostily. “How many more secrets are there that I haven’t been told?”
“What happened between you and Harry?” she asked softly. “You spent so much time together, and now… now you look like you’re ill and he’s moody and irritable all the time. There is something not right, isn’t there?”
“It just seems…too simple, almost.”
“How?” Harry can hear Ernie muttering. “Just…
“Does it show all of Hogwarts?” Draco asked, fascinated.
Prompt #8 – Shelves filled with messy stacks of wands in boxes
“Blimey,” said Weasley and scratched his head. “Er…’Lumos, Nox, the Stars, They Sing’.”
“Might depend on how you market them,” Draco pointed out. “Could be some sort of game – everyone takes one, and then you have to…I don’t know, try to form a word out of them all. You’ll just have to package them properly so you have the right letters to form something like…” He frowned and tried to think of a single, festive word, once again staring at the glass bowl. “Humbug.”
As the delicious stinging sensation made Draco's eyes water, Potter stood there, watching him silently. Eventually, he opened his mouth, sighed, and then asked, “Would it help if I pulled your hair again?”
“That, and interacting with them is an excruciatingly awkward experience for you these days, so you embraced that excuse like a good bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape.”
“Say something,” Harry begged, feeling pathetic.
Granger hesitated, but then reached for her wand and pushed up Harry’s sleeve. She circled a cluster of medium-sized letters with the tip of it, and they unscrambled.
“The painting?” Draco asked blankly. What did the bloody painting have to do with romantic gestures? Nothing, that’s what. His heart sank. He unwrapped the package slowly – Potter had clearly wrapped himself, it was a mess and a half – hoping against hope that maybe, just maybe, in Potter’s mind, the painting had something to do with his hypothetical feelings for Draco.
“As long as you don’t lick any lampposts while you’re at it.”
"Yes. A moving one, too, it's quite fascinating."
“And?” Draco asked. “She can’t have had time to do any of that yet, can she?”
“There was a bell jar with bright light, all the way back there.” Potter pointed. “Quite beautiful, actually. It had this…was it a hummingbird, ‘Mione?”
With his apple cake in the oven, Harry gets started on his gingerbread dough. It’s tricky business, and he had been reluctant to even use it, but Draco had needled him until he’d agreed to take the risk. He hopes it won’t blow up in his face.
getting.”
“Sure,” Draco said, since that was the only possible response, and resigned himself to more awkwardness for the rest of the way.
“I, I haven’t,” he says, feeling vulnerable. “Not since-”
“What? No! This has nothing to do with Potter, why would you even think that?”
“What!” Draco shrieks, in an embarrassingly high pitch.
There are more leaves in all sorts of deep, autumnal shades lying on top of the cake, made from gum paste. Kingsley cuts right through them so they can try a slice of carrot cake and walnut buttercream, which they end up loving. Harry can feel Malfoy practically vibrating with joy.
She laughed. “I won’t argue with that. Some of their products are downright ridiculous, but the atmospheric illusions are lovely. Ron looked quite pleased when I told him that. I think he’s planning on giving me a huge pile of them for Christmas.”
Draco was roused from blissful sleep by a knock on his door. His mind took a while to get a grip on reality, longer than it usually did. What had happened the night before felt foggy and unreal, like a strange dream, until he realized that it was Granger at his door and was forcefully reminded that he
“She’d gone to get fitted for new robes,” Parvati told him, reaching for her teacup. She made a face, presumably because the tea inside it had gone cold. Draco helpfully leaned across the coffee table and prodded it with his wand.
Granger’s brow furrowed. “Shouldn’t we? It’s quite awful out.”
“Fine,” Potter said cheerfully. “Suppose I can catch snowflakes for the both of us, then.”
“Maybe later,” Granger manages to say when Pansy looks ready to force-feed her the tart.
“Penny, you – do you really think that justifies it all? What did
Yes, that has to be it. His Slytherin instincts are clearly at work here.
“To be fair, it was a really weird situation.”
“Interesting,” Parkinson says, sounding skeptical.
it?” Draco asked.
“How? What was it she said?”
“You don’t even know yet?”
He stared at Malfoy with wide eyes, processing the fact that Malfoy had
Three Ravenclaws, one Hufflepuff, two Slytherins trying to distance themselves from the wrong side of the war. Their faces were burned into Draco's memory.
“Right, cast the encoding spell and tell me the numbers,” Harry instructed as he handed over the note.
Draco stared for a long moment.
Potter’s backup wand, and the odd reaction Draco had had to it.
“Er…let’s go with the old classic, ’Veritaserum Won’t Work On Me, I Haven’t Bought Your Gift Yet’.”
“Great,” Malfoy said. His face was still a bit flushed, and he was avoiding Harry’s gaze.
“I don’t know, Hermione.” Potter scratched his head. “You say it isn’t possible to use the sand, but even you have been stumped by how else this stupid loop might have happened.”
“Yes, of course I did, but it wasn’t exactly productive. Smith and Clearwater used three or four since the last batch was enchanted, and Marielle requested four as well.”
said Draco. “Well, that makes a lot more sense.”
The mint plant didn’t respond.
And as it turned out, Harry loved the red glass ornament with sparkling silver letters proclaiming ‘I will kill you if you die again, Potter’.
“Malfoy,” said Potter on the other side of the door, and when Draco didn’t reply, “Malfoy, don’t make me blast my way into the room.”
For a time, their anxious breathing and the occasional crackle of the fire were the only sounds in the room. Draco had rarely felt so on edge. Everything but the body before him seemed to fade away.
“Why are you so insistent on having it here, anyway?” Pansy asked.
Bones’ lower lip quivered. “I don’t know who any of you are.” She sobbed, reached up and wiped her face with a tissue someone had apparently given her. “I don’t even know who
This round, judging happens a bit differently, as to give their purported masterpieces an opportunity to shine. The stations are cleared away entirely, including the finished cakes, and instead, a black table with a magically illuminated spotlight on it appears in the tent, dead center. Molly and Kingsley are once more announced and walk in looking hopeful. Harry figures that after the mediocrity that was the previous two rounds, they’re dreaming of finally seeing something special.
For a moment, he wasn’t sure Granger had heard him. She was staring unblinkingly at a tree in the middle-distance, half obscured by the falling flakes.
“You’ve got three minutes left on your shift, actually,” said Granger sweetly. “But I’m sure I can send out a Patronus and let her know you got tired early.”
year in the castle.
"No," said Draco.
“Yes, Draco.”
“The guy he’s going on a date with…it’s just not a good idea,” Harry tried to explain.
“Malfoy’s gorilla bodyguards ambushed me on my way back,” Harry replied. His voice sounded more composed than he had to feel.
“Just hurt me,” Draco muttered, frustrated and upset.
Draco told himself firmly that he was
Seven minutes.
“That isn’t nearly enough cheer though!”
Draco and Harry exchanged a look. A needle penetrated his calf, and he hissed.
“Hey!” Potter protested. “I put my most secret fantasy about you on a canvas, and then you
people witnessing his…unfortunate situation. “What are you doing here?”
“Anyway,” Harry muttered. “I just wanted to, well, ask if you're okay.”
A strange, nasty jolt shoots through Draco, and he assumes it’s outrage. “That’s not normal.”
“Yes?” Harry, who had reappeared from wherever he’d been, asked eagerly. He was holding several Weasleys Wizard Wheeses Atmospheric Illusions patches, so Draco supposed there were likely several Christmas trees, windows and fireplaces waiting to spring into existence.
He felt a soft touch at his chin, and when he opened his eyes, he saw the apprentice healer, Holly, who looked him over.
“I figured.” Potter scratched the side of his face. “When I was talking to Hermione I realized... at least I have people to talk to, those who know what I went through. It makes it easier. I don't think you have anyone.”
“Yes, I’m getting that impression.”
knows what the hell ombre is. With a flick of Parkinson’s wand, instructions appear on the blackboard before them.
“Can you think of anyone who might have wanted to harm her?” Potter asked once he was finished writing.
Draco’s respect for the former Hufflepuff shot through the roof as he watched the girl he’d always thought of as meek and timid begin to fire off spells. Bones was
“Who are you?” Selwyn asked, looking him up and down.
“Right, okay,” the unknown person said, “I can…bloody hell, that’s a lot of gnomeholes.”
“So you put it in a safe in your office,” Potter said blankly.
“And then?” Draco asked.
make him laugh?”
, and Draco's scalp was on fire and it felt like all he'd ever wanted.
“Sure, love,” was the answer, and a moment later he held a ticket in his hand.
“Is there something wrong?” Malfoy asked, strangled, and Harry wondered how he was supposed to sit through this stupid meeting knowing that Malfoy had looked at a picture Harry had painted, a picture
“It’s almost sad to see the only Hufflepuff in the competition leave so early,” sighs Parkinson.
“What does?”
“Ah. So... you like hurting me?” Draco wasn't sure what to think about that.
Draco looked up. “It must be above one of the shops.”
So...this is it. Last chapter. I hope it lives up to expectations.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right, yes, Leroy.” Harry had nearly forgotten. “His name isn’t actually the problem, it’s…everything else.”
After a long moment, she nodded. Her hands were in her lap, fingers hooked together, and she lowered her head to stare at them.
Draco shook his head. He certainly wasn't in a partying mood. The only reason he was here at all was because Pansy and Blaise had bullied him into it. Not that they bought into the whole inter-house unity project any more than he did, but they knew better than to stick out these days. Keeping your head down was the new Slytherin mode of operation, which was why Draco wasn't entirely comfortable with receiving attention from Harry all of a sudden. But he knew better than to say so.
It was wonderful. He closed his eyes and he embraced the pain, and bit by bit, he managed to calm himself. His body relaxed. His breathing evened out. When Potter finally released him, he only sighed and let his head fall forward.
incursions.”
“Fucking hells,” Draco breathed, as they kept going and going.
“At all?”
“No need to sound so surprised.” Harry stuck his tongue out and then touched his wand to his pocket as though making sure the book was still there. “Just to check – all of us are hoping it’s Smith, right?”
“Because, because, well, I have…” Harry thought feverishly. “Reasons.”
“I suppose you’re tried all our names and such?”
“He brought a note with him that said I was pregnant before
“Tonight,” Draco agreed with a dry mouth, remaining seated and shivering in the cold wind as Harry wandered back to the castle.
“Where do you need to go so urgently?” he asked. “Bathroom?”
By unspoken agreement, they made their way up to the staff portion of the roof garden. It was a relief to finally rip his breathing mask off and suck in fresh, cold air. Draco leaned against a wall as he did so, trying to focus on each inhale and exhale, to quiet the anxiety that had been his companion all day and to relax the muscles that had been tense for hours.
“No,” Draco agrees. “Never thought I’d say this but thank Merlin for Granger.”
“Not interested in the Exploding Snap tournament?” he asked with what sounds like forced cheer.
“Do you feel like you deserve the pain?”
“You said ‘we’?”
Potter’s wand flew out of his hand and straight Draco’s way. He ducked, idiotically, before remembering it couldn’t actually hit him. There was a clattering sound somewhere in a far corner.
“Oh, no. I’m perfectly happy in my St Mungo’s lab, I really am only consulting with them for this one case.”
“Yes, because there were always at least two Unspeakables present.”
“Like what?”
He drew the blood with sure movements, wincing when he had to fight against the plunger’s resistance.
“Well,” he said, faltering. That’s what he got for keeping that stupid message’s advice in the back of his mind. “You don’t have to, obviously, but I barely ever have anyone over, and it might not be a bad idea for you to be around a healer for a little while longer, just in case.”
“What?” was all Blaise asked. He sounded confused and, when Draco didn’t meet his eyes, turned to Potter for an answer.
“Makes sense,” she said. “How does the poison enter the body?”
Harry knows what he means. He wants to tell Draco he, too, finally understands, now that he can look back at everything without the distortion of anger, of bitterness, of fear. He wants to talk about their upbringings, how their clash had been inevitable because of them. He wants to let Draco know that he gets it now, how, at eleven, Draco had first forayed outside of a pureblood bubble that had surrounded him his entire life, shaping his thinking and bolstering his conviction, how he had never had a chance before to form an opinion of his own, and Harry, without knowing it, had rejected all that Draco had ever been and known. How they’d both been shaped by friendship and expectation and history. How they had shared an inability to empathize, to a degree they couldn’t ever have imagined would be necessary to bridge the gap. How they’d both been prisoners to machinations bigger than them. How their difficult decisions had made a difference during that horrible last year.
Potter chuckled. “That’s not exactly newsworthy.”
“Fair point,” Draco conceded. “Would you notice if one of them is fake when you try to re-enchant it?”
“Fucking hell, Malfoy,” Potter said when he came in. “I’m sorry. That really wasn’t what I meant.”
Harry was concealing himself behind a stone pillar and tried to control his breathing. His entire body was taut.
“Hey,” Ron sat up straight. “That might actually be a good idea.”
“Backup wand?” Draco proposed.
Draco sighed. This was going to give him a headache.
“You’re both idiots, is the big picture here.”
“I’ve never heard of this phenomenon,” Hermione said, and Draco couldn’t believe how
“Eh?” Draco frowned in confusion and then followed Harry’s gaze to a tall, imposing tree in front of one of the fancier buildings on the other side of the street. “We don’t need a Christmas tree.”
“Yes, Harry?”
Or maybe ‘Do try kissing Potter.’
Potter looked around with interest as they made their way into the room. “Not much left here, is there?”
, on the wall, like it was any old painting, like it was pleasing to look at and nothing more, like…like…”
“Okay, right.” Draco took a deep breath, inhaling the stale scent of the mask covering his mouth and nose. Victoria had offered to put a drop of lavender oil on it, but if it wasn’t enough to eliminate the smell of death entirely, Draco would never be able to take another lavender bubble bath in his life.
“I know you’re wondering,” Potter said eventually, quietly. “I know you all are. It’s not easy to talk about.”
Draco asked. “Is that safe?”
“So, you’re basically creating a vacuum in the vein?” Granger asked.
“I haven’t gone grey yet,” Harry pointed out drily.
“But we could just –”
“Even better.”
“Have you mentioned anything to him about it?”
I’m going back in time, is there?”
“Merlin, Smith is such a tosspot,” Draco muttered. “Nice work, Granger.”
“Please, don’t make this too complicated, Harry, it doesn’t need to be.”
asked for it.”
said Hermione, sounding exasperated and amused in equal measures.
“Can you at least explain to me –”
It became a dance of agility and quickness, Potter apparently having the time of his life as he kept attempting to reach a post and Draco having visions of being forced to rescue Potter from potentially maiming himself. Potter kept laughing and sticking his tongue out as though he’d already reached the post, and Draco felt flushed and hot and tried to suppress the half-hysterical giggle that wanted to rise up in him.
“I’m lost,” Blaise admitted, his eyes not moving from Potter, “but it sounds impressive.”
“Be nice to know,” Weasley said, then looked around. “Er…Harry’s turn, innit?”
“For fuck’s sake,” he said.
Weasley made a face. “No. Hey, we could name her after Harry! I mean, er, make it Harriet, obviously.”
“A house elf, Lankey. We shared him with father; he moved between the two houses as we needed him to. We had a gardener too, Mr Gulls, and he sometimes brought his son to help out. No one else worked for us, except…well, there was a tutor, but she only came once. I didn’t like her at all her, so my mother told her not to come back.”
Blaise took out a bottle of gin next and rolled his eyes. "Yes, Draco, as evidenced by the fact that he didn’t act surprised to see me and then also said, ‘Oh, good, you're here’."
, and Draco should have been used to that,
“It’s Susan. Susan’s been poisoned.”
Selwyn spluttered as his face began to darken in colour.
“So.”
"Hermione, fine - the problem I ran into with the drinkable antidote is that the two different components need to work on eliminating the poison at the same time, but if you drink them both, they'd mix together in the stomach and mess with each other and cause all sorts of issues. I haven't been able to use Golpalott to combine them - I tried, but since this isn't technically a blended poison, it doesn't get there. But if I can keep the components from just...just being able to mix together even when they're both in the stomach -"
“I’ve been having to deal with this all my life, you know,” Harry said. “People making decisions about my life. People making assumptions about me, and having all these stupid expectations. I thought the worst would be over by now, with the war over, but this… this I didn’t expect. I didn’t think you’d do that to me, not after everything. I want to live my own life don’t you get it?”
“They’re going well enough, but it’s a ridiculously complex poison. It’s…I’m basically…” He sighed and rubbed his temples. “It’s complicated, and I keep thinking in circles.”
“Don’t know,” Draco sighed. “Not a contact poison, that’s all I know.”
Draco frowned. “I suppose. That’s weird though, you’ve always been Potter.”
The bus was quite empty. A variety of chairs were arranged in a rough U-shape on the lowest level, and there appeared to be only four other passengers – a big goblin, a smaller one, and two little old ladies who were both knitting. They seemed quite competitive, if the looks they gave each other were any indication.
. “You deserve pleasure.”
“That’s what we’re trying to figure out.” Draco looked down at the bits of information Parvati had given them. “Secretary Fletcher was alone in the room when she died, is that correct?”
Honestly, Draco is half-expecting one as well, because this just feels
Three, four, five minutes passed. The antidote and serum bumps under the skin vanished gradually. Potter twitched, twice.
“Of the clues.” He pointed at his arm. “Or rather, we’ve been trying to guess which one was the first one I wrote. Want a go?”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked. “Did they hurt you?”
“We need to catch this poisoner before they do more damage,” Draco said unnecessarily and ran his gloved hand through his hair, feeling anxious. He wished he’d have been in a state to do more work on the antidote, it might have helped him feel slightly less helpless, but his mind was a jumbled mess.
“What did you two argue about?”
Draco dropped the painting and launched himself at Potter, pressing their lips together. Potter staggered but kept his balance, which was a good thing because Draco was clinging so tightly to him that they would have gone down together. He kissed Potter until he was too oxygen-starved to continue and had to pull away.
But Draco didn't listen, he was too busy savoring the new pain, because even this he deserved. Suddenly, it felt less like a punishment and more like an absolution, and when Potter loosened his grip, he wanted to howl with mental anguish at the loss.
“And interrogate,” Draco adds.
“We just want to see you happy, dearie,” said Ermintrude.
“What are you looking for in that…is that a
to go on, and all Draco could do was to keep fighting for every life that hung in the balance in his ward so that their loss wouldn’t leave yet another scar on their battle-worn generation.
“Why would it end up in the
“Welcome back, dear audience, to our second day of adventurous baking!” Ron shouts with a little too much enthusiasm for Harry’s taste.
“What,” she whispered after what felt like hours.
She sniffed. “Starting to.”
Harry’s shoulders sag, because that did not go as well as he had hoped.
“I shattered mine years ago. Haven’t needed to replace it, it’s not used when brewing antidotes. Unfortunately, with this batshit crazy poison Potter has managed to get himself exposed to, I
Draco huffed. “You just want to disagree with me out of principle.”
“I can’t,” he muttered, and promptly regretted having said anything at all.
“You need to stop that,” he said. “I do not wish to get my hopes up because-”
“Lovegood and Potter seem to have decided on a cooperative strategy,” Parkinson comments just as Harry starts folding the rest of his batter in with the egg whites. This part is best done by hand anyway, his wandwork just isn’t delicate enough to avoid knocking out the air he’s whipped into the eggs.
“As far as I know, she seems happy enough at Gringotts though, so that’s something.”
With a
Eventually, Harry put his empty glass down, looked over to Hermione and said, “Go on, then. You’ve got a theory for what in Merlin’s name happened the last sixteen times I went back into the Veil, yes? Because I still don’t understand one bit about that part.”
“It’s to do with the time travel. Or, well, with time in general. There is next to no chance this could actually be what continues the loop.”
“What else used to be here?” Draco asked. He found the army of clocks a bit anticlimactic.
the poison takes until it works, I need to figure out what possibilities and circumstances would have allowed the poison to be transferred. A lot of it is intuitive because it’s based upon a poison with an extremely complex makeup. Any questioning needs to be dynamic so I can get all the information I need, which means I have to be there.”
Prompt #13 – Christmas candle decorations spelling out ‘NOEL’
“Me too,” Potter said.
Draco couldn’t resist tracing the letters with his finger. “Have you looked into what kind of ink this is?” he changed topics.
Arms tightened around him, held him. He couldn’t resist the heartbreaking familiarity of it.
Draco blinked, once, twice. “Oh.”
I had always planned to finish this story, but writer's block is a bitch, and so is mental illness, of which I have a generous heaping (and it's steadily getting worse). I'm thrilled that so many people like this story, but very sorry you all had to wait so long without knowing if I'd ever post the last couple of chapters.
McGonagall had always been able to make Draco feel like she saw right through him, and that hadn’t changed at all. She was kind and welcoming, choosing words that seemed superficially polite but conveyed a very clear ‘You’re forgiven, Mr Malfoy, but if you squander that forgiveness I shall be very cross indeed.’ Even more disconcerting was the sort of all-knowing gaze she seemed to have learned from Dumbledore. When she rested that gaze on Harry’s glamoured form, Draco was certain she suspected
Potter rolled his eyes.
“Yes. May I come through though? I wanted to talk to you.”
The use of his first name took him by surprise, but he wasn’t about to quibble. Not now.
considered me a friend, please leave and forget you ever saw me like this,” he begged.
“Did you come into her office often?” he asked.
“Right. We were arguing, if you must know.”
That startles a laugh out of Draco, before he goes back to focusing on his own bake.
He was in the shower when he realized that the last of the marks on his body had faded. There were no more bruises to connect him to Harry, nothing tangible he could cling to. It was well and truly over. He was alone, again, and for good. He hadn’t thought it would hurt quite so much.
She did look stressed. There were bags under her eyes, and her hair was surprisingly messy. But Draco hadn’t seen her since Hogwarts, so he wasn’t sure if she just always wore it like that these days, in a hasty, utilitarian ponytail.
“Potter, you prat,” Draco said, laughing, and because he was in such a good mood with the poisoner having been caught and no time loop to worry about, he allowed himself no more than a small grimace and put on the bobble hat Harry had so thoughtfully bought for him. It was soft and warm.
“You did well,” Draco says, a single step away from a whisper. His voice is raw, like he’s been screaming. “You did well.” Just that, a reassurance Harry hadn’t known he’d needed until he heard the words.
“And when I get to that goal, the loop will break?” Potter asked hopefully.
“Or,” Potter finished, “he or she works there.”
“Which would be bad, obviously.”
“Prove it.”
“Has anyone done an autopsy to look where the poison damage is most concentrated? Even if it doesn’t change structure until it finds the correct cells, it wouldn’t have had enough time to distribute evenly in the blood, so there should be an accumulation somewhere downstream from the entry point, whether that’s an organ or an injury.”
“Dearie me, is it raining?” asked one of the two little old ladies, pausing in her knitting to peer at him nearsightedly.
“Right, so, what’s the message?” Harry dug in his pocket and produced a marker. At Draco’s look of confusion, he admitted, “Been carrying it around, just in case. Should we start with the mint and the…whatever cherry it was?”
“No,” Potter said, sounding grumpy and hurt, “no, I don’t.”
“Good,” Draco said softly. “I hope that will be enough.” He barely knew Susan Bones outside of school, but she did not deserve to get mixed up in this.
Draco is returning a book to its rightful spot in the library when he comes across Potter. The Saviour is looking from a piece of parchment in his hands to the bookshelf and back, apparently searching for something. When he notices Draco, he looks at him with an alarmed expression.
“What,
“He’s really wrong for Draco though!” he insisted.
“Sorry,” Harry hears just after he takes his apple cake out of the oven and throws the gingerbread in instead. He looks up. Draco is standing at the very end of his bench, as close to Harry as he can be without actually leaving his station, and he is biting his lip.
“That’s a shit reason,” Draco grumbled.
Bollocks.
“Not at all, not at all,” Ernie says cheerily. “In my opinion, a healthy amount of gin will put anyone in a much more benevolent mood.”
“Is it supposed to?”
“You don’t even know that at all, you just
“Not if you mention that abomination.”
“My healer’s oath prevents me from sharing any information you give me,” he said. “You know that. And I
“Mate.” Ron pressed the palms of his hands to his desk, spreading his fingers over the many forms that littered it. “He fancies you. He’s fancied you for ages. You’ve fancied him for ages. What is the actual problem here?”
The rage in the woman’s eyes was reaching proportions that reminded Draco uncomfortable of Bellatrix. When he heard the incantation he’d been dreading but knew was coming, he took a deep breath and reminded himself forcefully that nothing in this memory could actually hurt him. That included the Fiendfyre.
She patted her purse. "Muggle mail for my parents, I need to drop it into the post box down the street."
at me.”
“It’s not –” Weasley started.
Harry desperately casts for a change of topic, and eventually settles on the obvious. “Happy with your roll?”
She gave him a surprised smile. “Yes. Penelope Clearwater. I’m surprised you remember.”
“Great,” Draco said. “Potter can’t follow his own thinking. Bit worrisome, all things considered.”
“’Scuse me,” the man mumbled and reached for a red shirt that had been draped over the chair. Draco watched, mouth open, as he collected items of clothing from all across the room and dressed himself in what turned out to be an elaborate Santa suit. The trousers had to be velcroed shut. The shiny black boots and fake beard came last, and then the man slunk away with his eyes firmly on the floor.
“Pansy lent this to you?” he asked – a little too casually for Draco’s liking.
“Might as well,” sighed Granger, much to Draco’s surprise. But he had enough hangover potion for all four of them, and he knew that they’d have a lot more to worry about very, very soon, so he wasn’t about to protest. Besides, with all of the very strange revelations lately, it seemed a perfectly rational response.
“Only about…” Granger turned to Smith. “Was it three hours ago?”
Ripples spreading outward through the air as though it had turned into a vertical water surface.
“Not quite what I had in mind,” Potter grins, and – fine. Draco can live with that.
“Mind if I sit down?” someone asked.
about the bloody thing.
Nothing, that was what. And the sooner Potter realized that, the better.
Draco turned just in time to see Potter give the post a good, long lick before pulling back with a triumphant look on his face.
“You still weren’t terminated, and that’s what counts. Do you still have your badge, by the way?”
That…was a good point. Draco took two fistfuls of his hair, pulled it and complained, “I can’t
“My mind is properly blown,” Draco said, just in case anyone was wondering.
Potter sought him out again six days later. Draco had made himself a little sanctuary in the library, a spot in a far corner behind stacks of books, where he could get his work done without getting looks and having to deal with anyone. At least, so he had thought. He needed to study, needed to do more than well if he was to have any chance at all at finding employment after leaving Hogwarts.
“Why are you blushing?”
“No,” Granger said softly. “No, I haven’t…he’s been so incredibly busy at the shop, and there’s nothing he can
His new position shows off the lovely lines of Draco's throat. His lips are stretched wide by the red ball gag Harry only brings our for special occasions because he knows just how very vulnerable it makes Draco feel.
“She died right away? Or did she lose consciousness for a while first?” Draco asked.
“You gave my friend Pansy and me a lecture once when we had a shouting match in the corridor,” he said, though an explanation probably wasn’t needed. He was too tired to care.
“That’s nice,” Draco said absently, and then, “Oh for fuck’s sake, there is another one. You must have really impressed these people.”
“Draco, these are…” Blaise took an agitated breath and ran his hand through his hair. “There are exactly twelve of these in existence, and I keep a very close eye on them – because they’re ridiculously expensive and bloody tedious to produce, and also because they’ve got quite the potential for abuse. All twelve of them should be in the office Anton and I share. People can’t just come in and
“Is what alright?”
“What the hell is that?” he asked.
“Why, though?” Harry asked after a long moment of silence. “Why combine two of me together?”
Draco finally lifted his gaze, staring. Harry was pacing. His face was dark, his feet kicking the uneven stones of the floor as he stomped around.
don’t believe that. Who exactly are you trying to fool?”
“Care to put that into concrete terms?”
“You called him a pretentious, self-important prick in the lift the other day.”
Draco sighed and finally turned his head. Despite the darkness, he could make out Potter’s contrite and concerned expression. “Alright,” he said. “Fine. You’re sorry. If you don’t mind, I’d like to go to sleep.”
at me,” Harry said. “Malfoy, I mean. He…he
it hurts to know that.” He groped blindly for the Floo powder and threw an entire fistful into the flames. By the time Potter had managed to follow, Draco had reached his bedroom, locked the door, and thrown the stupid wreath on the floor as an afterthought.
“Ron was coming up with some ghastly name ideas,” Granger said, laughing, “and I cast the spell mostly so I’d only have to argue against half of them.”
“I don’t know.” Admittedly, every time Potter looked at the houses around them, Draco couldn’t help but sneak glances at
“The writing stays,” he realized.
“I do
“You complete halfwit, I gave up on hoping you’d love me back so long ago!” Draco shook his head like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “I started trying to date other people, to try and get over you, but you kept sabotaging me like you just didn’t want me to be happy.”
“I want my ‘W’ back,” Harry demanded, waving a ‘V’ around.
“What?” he asked, voice scratchy in his throat.
He doesn’t realize how helpless and open his expression is until Draco steps up to him, hesitating, but at last reaching out. Harry feels comforted as a warm, dry hand cups his cheek. His eyes fall closed.
Time passes shockingly quickly. One moment, Harry carefully tests his gingerbread for doneness, the next he’s got his wand in hand and is putting the finishing touches on his winter wonderland cake. One station over, Draco wipes the sweat from his forehead and casts the same spell Harry is currently using, the one they’d found and practiced together. It creates a miniature breeze just above the cake, small eddies that will lift very light particles and make them dance above the surface of the cake.
Draco grinned, but just like that, there was a dull sadness making his chest hurt, because he loved spending time with Harry like this, and he wouldn’t have this any more once the loop restarted. Depending on how different the next loop ended up being, he might not ever have it again. The thought really, really hurt.
"Oh, this'll be good." Hermione tuned the letter over a few times as though to check everything was in order, then slipped it into the mail slot.
“Secret admirer,” he lied, standing up and dropping the necklace in the pocket of his robes before making his way to the doors. On the way, he took care to avoid Finnigan, who was scowling at the mass of storm clouds over his head and waved his wand, presumable trying to make them vanish, or at least stop raining on him. Draco only barely managed to suppress a smirk, and the fact of it made him frown. He wasn’t supposed to be going around smirking. Harry’s damn present wasn’t supposed to be lifting his mood. It was all wrong.
Once they’d caught their breaths – which took quite a while – and were walking again, Harry picked the conversation back up. “The problem with searching the department is that there’s always a chance of one of them working late or starting early or coming back because they’ve forgotten something, and even if they leave on time, there isn’t much of a window before the after-hours departmental defences kick in.”
Anyway.
“Doesn’t what?”
“Look, telling us in confidence has got to be better than having people believe you murdered your mother,” Potter interjected.
“Potter,” he said.
Draco frowned at the floor as he tried to remember what he could about his flight. He saw Potter only at the periphery of his vision. “I was the only one who ran though, wasn't I?”
thing has proven that it can change. The magic is what’s telling it ‘hey, once you find a certain type of cell to cling to, change your molecular structure so you can do something you couldn’t do before’ – presumably something that damages the cell in some way. There is no reason those who created it couldn’t have put a second bit of magic on it saying ‘hey, if you encounter any substance that starts to bind with you, rip it apart and use the pieces to change your molecular structure in a different way’.”
“I…think so, yes, at least before…oh! Yes, I remember now. And – Salazar, that makes so much sense!”
Prompt #16 – A shirtless man wearing a Santa hat.
have any, but he suppressed the urge to make a remark about it. He was well-aware it wouldn’t be productive in the slightest.
He couldn't help but wish himself among them. He couldn't help but wish he could touch Harry outside of their sacred time together in their bathroom, or, hell, sometimes his ridiculous mind imagined kneeling by Harry's feet right in the middle of the Great Hall and letting everyone see who he belonged to. But it wasn't his place. He wasn't the Saviour, he was the Death Eater, an afterthought, and he was supposed to be thankful he had as much as he did.
Draco pretended not to notice. The last thing he wanted was for Potter to get self-conscious, to stop their arrangement. That would have been unacceptable. So he willed down his erection and buttoned up his shirt, forcing himself to maintain a bored, neutral expression as he nodded at Potter and left the bathroom.
“Do you even know where she went off to?” he asked.
“Maybe not. I’d settle for neutral.” Harry led the way to the back of the store, where a lone silver-haired witch in powder blue robes was directing both a broom and a feather duster with jerky wand movements.
Harry pulled. Pansy pulled.
While Potter was talking to Susan once again – through the Floo this time – Draco used the opportunity to review the new notes that Victoria had owled him. It was slow going because he was distracted and confused and fighting the urge to bang his head against the wall – for one because they were barely making any progress, and also because Draco was an idiot with inconvenient feelings.
“Yes, Ron, that’s exactly what it means!”
“But…” Draco frowned, thinking back and trying to process. “But
“Stop panicking and help me figure out what to write on my arm.”
“Fine,” Draco said, “but you’ll have to work on convincing them, I’m not doing that.”

since when was he calling Draco by his first name too? Draco swallowed down the jolt of
it’s well-distributed? I mean, it’s a complex poison, we know that much, but even a complex magical poison can’t be that self-aware.”
“I need,” Malfoy had said when Harry had finally confronted him. “I
Draco’s heart dropped all the way through the floor. “You’re joking.”
Draco straightened from his uncomfortable hunched-over position and studied her. During the eight months that their apprenticeships with the same Potions Master had overlapped, he had gotten to know her fairly well. She was thorough and not prone to mistakes, and she had a knack for remembering techniques and theories that were either obscure or out of fashion, which might come in handy for something like this, where an unconventional approach was required.
Draco wished he could challenge that statement by recommending she have a talk with Potter. But Potter was of course still a secret kept by a select few, and he was currently hidden in Weasley and Granger’s bedroom, probably unable to sit still as he waited for Parvati to leave.
“Can you –” Potter started.
“Ah,” said Draco.
is that sometimes, you accidentally end up creating something worse because the magical component gives the substance a kind of flexibility that it doesn’t have in the chemical sense. Essentially…” Draco sighed and tried to find words that would be clear enough so even Smith couldn’t misconstrue them. “Ordinarily, you’ve got your poison, you’ve got your antidote, they bind together and create something harmless that the body can simply metabolize.
“Help me figure out what to put on my blasted arm, Draco, and if we’ve got more time after that, we can speculate if you insist.”
“No. I need to speak with Hermione.”
Harry said as he walked into the room.
For some time, they were quiet as they walked, then Harry said abruptly, “We should find a Christmas tree soon.”
“Good,” Parvati said and looked up at him. “Lyman Selwyn sent in a complaint along with the list you asked him to write, by the way.”
It wasn’t really fair, because Millie was working on applying it to much more than just messages, but it was how she’d gotten started. The prospect of a new method of keeping secrets was sure to warm any Slytherin’s heart.
“Merlin, that was abysmal. Don’t quit your day job.”
For a long time, Potter said nothing, opening his mouth repeatedly and closing it again, moistening his lips. Draco tried not to be too obviously impatient. Eventually, Potter managed to speak.
“What is it?” Draco asked.
Draco knew his own smile was changing into something more predatory as he purred, “Well, to even the score, why don’t I tell you about one of the fantasies I’ve had about the two of us? You see, it happens to involve this desk right here…”
“We’d like to know about anyone in your mother’s life that her coworkers wouldn’t have mentioned to us. Essentially, we want you to list any names you can think of, no matter if they have a motive or not, or whether you think them capable of it. Anyone at all who might have interacted with your mother beyond a polite greeting.”
