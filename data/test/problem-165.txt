“It’s something.” Harry sighed and lay his head back down on Draco’s chest, his ear positioned just above Draco’s heart. Usually the sound of that lulled Harry to sleep long before Draco closed his eyes. “Sometimes I wish I could beat everyone up who ever made you feel bad.”
“Draco!” Harry repeated, dumping his entire weight on his lap before he wrapped Draco up in a bone crushing hug, anchoring him down until he came to a standstill. Slowly Draco became aware of his rapid breathing against Harry’s chest, the smell of his quidditch sweater drowning out the hospital stench. Strong hands rubbed at his back, massaging out the tension to the best of their abilities.
“Don’t-, don’t like sunlight?” Draco sputtered, maybe with a bit more drama than was called for, but he knew Harry liked that about him. “Excuse you, but I happen to
refuse to let you and the other Aurors bully him to death with your petty antics. He’s coming home with me. Find someone to cover his shift. Or don’t, I honestly couldn’t give a flying Hippogriff’s cunt.”
He was still scared what Harry would say if he found out about his past though. Not the fact that he was a Death Eater, but everything that came after that. It was easy to take advantage of a teenage boy kicked out onto the streets, especially when he knew nothing about muggles.
Luckily, or unluckily, depending how you looked at it, Draco had his looks and accent working for him. He was worth money. Money that didn’t end up in
Then on a last note, it is perfectly understandable that you find it easier to talk to someone you do not know. It enables you to talk more freely, without fear of being judged (which I would not do even if we did know each other). So yes, that does make perfect sense. And writing as you think helps me understand you so I can help you better, so please do not shy away from that.
“Ewwwww.” James pretended to vomit as his dad hopped onto the bed and crawled over to give his boyfriend a kiss. “That’s disgusting.”
“Hi Dad.” Scorpius greeted him with a wave that was noticeably more energetic than the day before. He was clearly dead nervous and scared though. “How did it go?”
“Uhm, I, eh, I really like this tea, Mrs. Malfoy,” Harry stammered when they came to the end of their breakfast. Scorpius had climbed in Draco’s lap at some point and while Draco attempted to make Dutch braids in his son’s hair, his mother had taken to looking at Harry.
“I don’t know about touching, that’s a very personal question,” Luna mused. “He enjoys my hugs, but he never asks for them. He hasn’t been very brave for himself. Not since the war and the trials.”
It was quite funny to watch Harry’s confused face from the corner of his eye as he listened to the story from Scorpius’ healer. After basically living in the hospital for over a year, Draco knew the jargon, but to Harry everything had to sound like a strange mix of difficult words.
“Then I’ll do just that,” Hermione said briskly, and she walked off to a nurse’s office, leaving Ginny with Parkinson, Teddy and Victoire.
of himself for actually stringing a coherent sentence together. He lost that fluency as soon as he looked back at Harry, catching sight of that
I need you to know this because I do not think anyone has ever told you this in such a way that you actually understood it, but You. Deserve. Help. Especially as a kid, that is what adults are for. But reading your letters makes me understand that you have not been brought up with that idea, so I will try and explain it to you.
apologised, and second because the man had red-rimmed eyes and a haunted look on his face. “I figured you might be up right now. You’re the only person I could think of. I’m sorry, I just couldn’t be alone anymore.”
“What? Malfoy, wait!” But somehow, despite being exhausted, Malfoy was out the door before Harry could stop him. He’d have chased the guy, but that would’ve left his shop unattended and he wasn’t that obsessed with the blond anymore.
“Don’t let your breakfast get cold, Dad. Harry said you had to eat all of it because you are too skinny.”
But he hadn’t. He’d made his grandma proud by keeping his face impassive and politely excusing himself after they were all done speaking. She would probably be a little less proud of him for what he was doing now, namely running away from Hogwarts after curfew, but he honestly couldn’t care. If she had tried a little harder to get him excused from school while his cousin slash uncle slash best friend slash semi-dad was dying, then he would have cared. But neither she nor Harry had gotten him out. Both seemed of the opinion that seeing Draco in hospital would only upset him more, or something like that. Harry had been far from coherent in his letters, his gran had only written that he would be no use in the hospital and Ron could never really be trusted when it came to interpreting other people’s feelings and motivations.
“I’m not so sure about that. Ginny looks like she wouldn’t back away from the opportunity,” Draco replied, which wasn’t even all that far from the truth. Ginny didn’t mind him, but when they went out together, her humour was more often than not at his expense. “Or James, next time he’s playing vampire.”
“It’s okay, it’s in the past.” Harry squeezed his shoulders again and planted a kiss on his forehead. “I’m so sorry this is happening again. But you have to be strong for him, hey?”
“You really thought of everything, haven’t you?” Harry tried hiding his fresh tears by looking down to the books in Draco’s hands. “I bet if Hermione ever wrote something it would be just as well thought out as this.”
Watching Potter go about his business that day had made him feel nostalgic to the bone about his past life. About easier,
Scorp’s bottom lip trembled, and Draco quickly handed his son his favourite stuffed niffler to hold on to. He was so proud of his son for telling him all this, for speaking the truth even though that same truth terrified him.
But despite how close they were, George couldn’t stand to be around Fred right now. Couldn’t stand how, every time he brought up Draco and the possibility of visiting the hospital, Fred left or talked around it or pretended not to hear him.
a mess.” Pansy whispered just a tad too loudly. She had just enough manners to look slightly embarrassed about it. “Sorry, I’ll leave. Have fun you two.”
The other side of the bed was empty and cold when Draco woke up the next morning. He hated it when that happened, especially right now, because it was bloody cold outside and since Harry was a living and breathing furnace, he had never bothered with any kind of heating charms on his bedroom. Draco suspected he even left the window open a crack.
“Maybe it is. But I felt properly pain free for the first time in over a year so I didn’t care. And then you ran because I was healed and you’re an idiot, and it took three years worth of letters before I convinced you to let me back into your life. But I never told you because I don’t want you to stay because of the pain. That would ruin me feeling welcome around you.”
Draco didn’t know why, probably because it was all a little too much, the stress and relief and gratitude and insecurity crashing down on him on an empty stomach, but suddenly, he was crying. Not the gentle tears from the night before, but actual ugly sobbing.
But the part that comes before the funeral, the death, the despair, the fight with reality that you will always end up losing, the desperate hope in the thoughts and prayers around you, that held nothing but fear. It was that fear that kept George in his seat after he woke up with a crick in his neck. Even in the hospital, so close to Draco’s dying body, he had a little bubble around him. The smallest barrier between him and the inevitable truth.
“Only when it comes to such blatant lies.” Draco stuck up his nose. “Now come along, Potter. We have some shopping to do.”
Harry shrugged. “That doesn’t make me love you any less. And I think both of us care less for sex than the average person. Unless you really want to…?”
Teddy looked over his shoulder and nearly tripped over his own feet and the broom when he caught sight of Victoire’s glare. He might not speak french but that only made it more terrifying if he was being honest. Plus, he got the gist of it.
I suppose that might be what made me so angry. After being at Hogwarts where everyone fought together during the battle, I think it shocked me that people weren’t willing to get involved. That and the fact that it could have easily been me who was being attacked. I’m bisexual and wouldn’t think twice about walking down the street with my partner, whether I was with a man or a woman. At least I wouldn’t have before this.
“I'm sorry.” Draco would have never guessed it but he turned into an apologetic Hufflepuff when he felt bad about himself. Especially when he was also tired to boot. “I shouldn't be talking about myself this much. And I shouldn't make you miss your kids. You have them to take care of already, I shouldn't add to that.”
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco quipped, though his voice was so much softer than he wanted it to be. “I hate you.”
“The pain is a reminder of what I did. I can’t face your family knowing that.” Harry hugged his boyfriend closer when his voice threatened to break. He knew that besides being a bully, Draco had helped trying to rebuild Voldemort’s troops, even if the bastard was long dead.
!” Percy bellowed so loudly Draco wouldn’t be surprised if they’d get kicked out of the shop soon. He was getting redder in the face than Ron did when people talked about their sex lives within earshot. “She’s amazing and would be the best mother your son could wish for. You’re really blind if you…”
I had my first therapist at fourteen. Fourteen! You know, during that year in which you came back from a graveyard with the dead body of your second crush in your hands? (I know Wood was your first. I know Pansy, who knows Hermione, so I basically know everything). Anyhow, you should have seen a therapist then! Or after your Godfather died or when Dumbledore died or just, fuck, as soon as someone found out you have been abused for the first eleven years of your life or
However much that train of thought shocked Draco, it was of no news to Harry. Or at least he seemed completely unphased by it. “I guessed as much. I’m quite the same actually.”
“You have nothing to be sorry for. Your boundaries are your boundaries and no one is allowed to cross them if you don’t want them to,” Draco shushed, hoisting Scorpius up a little higher with one hand while grabbing some floo powder with the other. His son looked confused at that, but Draco explained before he could ask any questions. “We’re going to visit Grandma for a bit, does that sound like a good plan?”
“Can I come in?” George knocked on the door frame, getting the attention from a very defeated looking Harry. He’d never seen him this lost before; not even after the war.
“Oh babe…” Harry pushed his fingers through Draco’s hair, shocked at what he’d heard. “I’m so sorry, love. But my family doesn’t hate you. They’re a bunch of overprotective nutters, but they don’t hate you. Sirius is my Godfather, remember? He knows what it’s like.”
Her whole body shook, and she wasn’t even aware anymore of the noises she made or the tears falling from her eyes. Mere seconds after breaking down, two strong arms wrapped around her, grounding her and pressing her against a woman’s chest.
“Fine.” Harry sighed, but he relaxed into Draco’s arms all the same. Draco had discovered that Harry had a lot of ‘facts’ he knew about his body. Like the fact that he weighed too much, or the fact that his knees were ugly, or the fact that his hair was gross. Only none of those things were actually true, and Draco did his best to convince Harry of that every time he discovered another fact. “You’re strict.”
“I got angry because Mrs Weasley didn’t listen. She didn’t take you seriously. And that wasn’t your fault, it was hers,” Draco explained, trying to sound reassuring. “So please never stop asking people to let you go when you want them to. Scream and kick if you need to. No one is allowed to touch you when you don’t want them to, alright?”
Harry turned his back on the eggs he was baking and smiled when he saw Draco, though his face fell when he saw the half pulled on robes.
She could see even through the window that the man had been crying. She’d been upset with him before, with his carelessness and stupidity, but realised now that there was no need to get angry with Harry. No one would be more angry or disappointed in Harry than he himself. Losing Draco would crush him just as much as it would her.
No one else would pay his university bills and the Malfoy vaults had been confiscated by the Ministry. Plus, no one would distract him from his boring job now that he’d lost touch with most of his friends. It turned out friendships did dwindle when one half of the party was only allowed to contact others via owl post, and the party as a whole was deeply traumatised after a war.
“Fine!” Harry yelled back, the idea of spending Christmas Day at the Burrow after all looked a million times better than staying in this dump anyway. Draco wouldn’t be on call with him in his current state, which really had been the only reason he’d taken the shift at all. “Have fun finding two last minute replacements during Christmas, you stuck up prick.”
Luna hadn’t been home ever since Malfoy’s accident. Ginny understood that Draco was her wife’s best friend, but that didn’t mean Ginny didn’t miss her. Especially when she came home to an empty house yet again. Of course, she could go to the hospital to visit Luna, but with her current training schedule, she needed a proper shower and every hour of sleep she could get.
the strength of his magic around him like a comforting blanket, the way he always did. It was still beyond his comprehension to believe that this man wanted
A second word sprang up. More panicked, more all consuming, more intense as he tried with all his might to move and feel. But it was no use. His muscles wouldn’t move. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure he had muscles or a body at all. All around him was only nothing, and the Heaviness came from something not quite physical. Maybe more exhaustion. Pure, mind-numbing exhaustion. He felt the sudden need to give into it, to sink down, let go, allow himself to follow the path calling for him.
Draco sat down on the cold tiled floor once the door to the bathroom fell shut. It wasn’t a very private place to have a breakdown, but for now the place was empty and the cold of the walls helped keep him sane for the most part. He started counting the tiles between the floor and the sink, trying his best to distract his mind from everything else. It didn’t really help.
He wanted to cry. He wanted an out for everything he felt but couldn’t remember, everything that kept slipping away. He wanted to
She raised an eyebrow at the latter two, as a way to avoid looking at Malfoy again. He would look like regret to her now, and she hated regret. “Aren’t you two supposed to be in school?”
“But you still don't know if he'll wake up,” the Indonesian woman cut in before Kingsley could even think of the words.
“Harry, as a friend of Granger you should know that it’s useless to deny the truth. And the truth is that I love you, every inch, ounce and part of you, and I’m going to drag you around until you’re old and almost falling apart just like I used to do with my favourite teddy. Only my father can’t take you from me, so even then I won’t leave, and I won’t ever love you any less. Get it through your thick skull, Harry. I am violently clingy and you can probably commit murder and I still wouldn’t go away. Now stop fussing.”
Apparently that was not the right thing to say, because Draco then put his arms around Harry’s neck while his coughing fit slowly turned into crying. Confused and cursing himself for being such a poor host, Harry held him there, rubbing slow circles on his back.
He got up from the sofa and walked over to the floo. “I’ll go fetch Scorpius now. He’d be so disappointed if I let him miss pancakes.”
. He thought as he quietly watched the Weasley matriarch leave. At some point in the future he would talk to her again, once his son was alright, and apologise for some of the things he’d said himself. But for now, he had more important things to focus on. Scorpius stirred in his sleep, and Draco lay down next to him again, careful not to invade his space without removing his body heat. The tea Mrs Weasley had brought as a peace offering was still cooling on the nightstand, the mugs long forgotten now.
“How dare you call me dumb in my own home!” Molly raised the ladle at him and Scorpius flinched again, his eyes full of fear. It might be the wrong conclusion, but something told him that Scorpius wasn’t just scared of the look of the ladle, but of the
, or some entitled rubbish like that. Only when Malfoy made a move to yawn again did Harry snap out of it and answer his question, albeit a tad dishonestly.
“Happy New Year to you too, Draco.” Harry waved at him, a sincere look on his face. “And don’t forget to bring your kid when you visit. I bet James would love to teach him Hungry Hungry Hippo.”
okay so this chapter is not super long but it was sort of already written and I'd totally forgotten about that so I figured I would post it today anyway to make up for the short chapter before this. I hope you enjoy!
I’ve started keeping a journal so I can write in that in between sending you letters. I’ve been writing random thoughts down, as well as memories - good and bad - and I think it is helping. I feel… lighter.
, he’d explained a few weeks ago. Draco had promptly and quite unexpectedly started crying at that, which resulted in his son, Harry, and all the Potter kids burying him under a huge group hug.
For a short moment, Neville feared Harry meant Draco’s breakdown, but of course that wasn’t true. He meant their getting together, him and Draco finding happiness in each other’s arms. And it was true, Neville had helped a bit here and there, but honestly, it wasn’t much more than occasionally walking past Draco with a bit too much sway in his hip, depositing the potions professor right in Harry’s lap during breakfast.
, while he apparently knew Harry owned this shop, judging by his reaction to his presence. But he knew better than to question someone as tired as Malfoy. Hermione would have bitten his head off before he’d opened his mouth.
“I fought with her worse than you did.” Harry spoke softly after a few minutes. “I called her an old-fashioned tart. Might have even said something about my aunt and uncle compared to her, but I don’t really remember. I hurt her with what I said, I know that much. But she hurt my family first and I won’t stand for that. And I’m not going back to the Burrow until she apologises.”
Apparently that was exactly the wrong, or exactly the right thing to say, because Harry choked out a dry sob and buried his face in George’s shoulder. Feeling like he really ought to have brought Ron with him, George patted Harry on the back.
Draco was hit by a surge of jealousy, which was stupid because Pansy was the last person to snatch this guy from him. He was so fucked. Or actually, he wasn’t, especially not by the cute bartender, and that was becoming a real problem. “I thought you were a lesbian?”
“I keep saying that because I know he loves you. Harry doesn’t leave people, Draco. It’s not in his nature. You know him, every inch of him, including all of his flaws, and I’ve never seen you love anyone more than him. You’ve grown so much together you guys are completely intertwined. You
“Hey, hey, stay with me, you idiot.” Draco turned around in his arms and cupped his face in his hands. “I’m telling you because I
Draco ordered a coffee for himself and a pot of tea for Harry, along with two slices of treacle tart. Luna smiled and skipped back to the counter to ring the order through. She saw Draco regularly, but this was the first time he’d ever ordered the treacle tart and she wasn’t so lost in her own world that she missed the reason why.
Scorpius was not always such a model child. Or at least, he wasn’t always this polite. Only in settings like these, when he was surrounded by strange people, did he pronounce his r’s and t’s properly and did he make sure there were no grass stains on his knees. It was the result of a less than amazing childhood, which said something given that Scorp was only five years old.
“M’b fibe,” Draco muttered, shooting him a watery glare. The colour of his nose rivaled that of Rudolf, he was shivering all over, and Harry was half convinced a soft blow of air could topple his colleague over. “‘S Chrifmaf eve. Can’t-, can’t call in sick. No obe covers for me ob norbal days.”
“Draco, what happened at the Burrow… It sucked, but it wasn’t your fault.” Harry threw an arm around his chest, spooning him from behind. “Molly will come around, she always does, but in the meantime you have to stop beating yourself up about it, okay?”
Draco smiled in reply and obeyed Harry’s words. He didn’t think he could speak right now and he wasn’t keen on trying. Harry’s friends seemed to take his silence as a sign of nervousness about meeting them all again and left him alone for the most part. He didn’t know if that was better or worse, because it just made him realise that he hadn’t even thought about being nervous to see them. There were too many other things on his mind.
It didn’t last of course. When did it ever? Albus, Lily and James sat neatly in a row, all quiet and well-behaved. A well-behaved Potter never boded well. Draco couldn’t sit, though. He’d been here before, only last time he’d been too numb to really feel what was going on. Now everything seemed to bright. The lime green floors, the smell of disinfectant, the numerous Healers and nurses walking past with a sympathetic look on their face that only made him panic more.
As for being your therapist, only you can decide on that. I will tell you who I am as well, once I know who you are (which I don’t know yet since I reply to your letter as I read). Once the anonymity of this exchange is gone, you would not be the first person to decide to call quits. I want you to know that you are absolutely at liberty to do that, and I will not be mad in any way, and I will not be hurt by it even if you want to discontinue because of who I am. You can request a different correspondent, no matter the reason.
,” Draco pouted even as Harry pulled him closer and kissed his temple. “Also, this is really fucking stupid too.”
“Draco…” Harry sighed in such a way that Draco knew he would have to come clean. Harry would never pressure him, but he would come up with all kinds of sob stories and feel guilty about those all night. Draco couldn’t have that.
But Draco’s medical condition, no matter how important, wasn’t what was on his mind right now. He had heard Pansy’s rant through the glass, had heard her accusations and anger, and he knew that none of it was misplaced, and none of it was a lie. He was a worthless boyfriend.
He probably, in some way, should have expected it, but since Draco was usually the most stoic person when it came to crying Neville was still surprised when fresh tears began to fall. At least he’d spelled his pyjamas dry before, so he was fully prepared for it.
“Those two things don’t exclude each other, babe.” Harry chuckled again and kissed his neck. Draco pried his arms loose and turned around, sending his lover a mild glare.
“No of course I don’t hate you, you absolute twat.” Draco turned around and pulled Harry into a hug before he could properly see his face. If Harry were to actually look crestfallen, Draco didn’t think he could cope with the hurt and guilt he’d feel from that. “I never hated you. I wanted to for a very long time, so
“Maybe because I’m right.” His mother gave him a pointed look. “Hold on, let me rephrase that. I'm your mother. I'm always right”
“Hi, Luna,” Harry replied with a smile. “No, I’m… meeting someone. Hopefully. If he turns up,” he finished sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand.
Both he and his mother attended several classes on therapy for kids in addition to their own private therapy, doing everything they could to help Scorpius recover. And it worked, in part. Scorpius got over his nightmares, though he still slept in Draco’s or his gran’s bed. He became more relaxed around strangers again, as long as they were kind, introduced themselves, and never raised their voice. And when he met the Potter kids, he’d started to have fun again. Or at least, he did the second time he met them. The first time James had been way too over enthusiastic and Scorpius had ended up yelling at James before hiding behind the couch.
“Yes yes I’ll hurry up!” He whisper-yelled, though there was no one around to hear them. “I’m just not a very great flyer, okay? You know that. Just give me a minute.”
George’s chest constricted, almost silencing him. Because it couldn’t be. Not now. Not with Harry about to give up. Not with
Recorded Draco fell silent for a moment, his heavy breathing the only sound coming from the tape recorder.
Draco briefly locked eyes with Harry. They exchanged a knowing smile, and then replied together. “Yes.”
“Harry, I had a panic attack in front of your kids.” Draco cast a discreet silencing charm around his son’s head so their talking wouldn’t accidentally wake him up. “I was hyperventilating and I’m pretty sure I smashed a vial of calming draught on the floor when a nurse tried to calm me down. That must have been terrifying for them. I’m not joking when I say I’m sorry.”
“Thank you,” Harry chuckled and rolled them over again. He loved using Draco as a pillow, even though Draco was convinced he was too bony for it. Though with his less than healthy lifestyle choices, he figured he might have gotten a bit more comfortable since the last time they’d shared a bed. “I love this. Waking up next to you.”
They ended up sharing a rare, quiet meal with just the four of them in the greenhouse. Draco could really use the calm atmosphere of the place, as the jitters of his panic attack still hadn’t fully left. Harry spent the first part of the meal reassuring Scorpius that he wasn’t mad at him, and the other part quietly talking to Draco’s mother. Draco didn’t really focus on what they were talking about, he was quite absorbed with watching Scorpius slowly lose the battle against sleep.
It can be difficult to see that if your lens is dark, but that is why I am here. To help you past your war experience. I want to make sure that the war will become something you accept as part of your story. Something that you do not suppress (and I am thrilled to hear you will no longer be doing that) but process, then give it a place in your mind, before focussing on where you are now. Because we are no longer at war, and I want you to be aware of that in every aspect of your life. If you do not give your trauma a spot, and you see it again during a flashback, you just hurt yourself twice.
Harry smiled down at him and pressed his lips to Draco’s cheek. ”I think that’s enough heavy talk for tonight.”
fucked up. I’m not worth all that. You’re fighting for your life here, and I’m so fucking scared that you won’t make it and meanwhile you just bloody well made peace with me possibly dying each time I go to work? It’s not right. You should never have to do that. I shouldn’t have made you do that.”
Harry had only caught a glimpse of how to properly raise kids when he visited The Burrow for the first time. He didn’t know any nursery rhymes, didn’t know how to change a nappy or how to lull a kid to sleep.
When Harry came back to Draco’s room, the commotion had died down, and everything seemed to have gone back to the way it was. Draco’s brain activity was still there, but it wasn’t getting any stronger, and the twitching had stopped. Harry didn’t know what to think of that. He had no medical knowledge whatsoever, and he couldn’t make heads or tails out of the situation.
Or actually, he couldn’t stand the thought of Draco dying at all. Teddy already didn’t have his parents anymore, he couldn’t lose Draco too. The thought ripped a huge black hole into his chest threatening to drown him in a never ending pool of loneliness.
But Potter had brought back the fight in him, with his stupid comment about his jeans. Suddenly all the old resentment at the ministry, his father, Hogwarts, it all came rushing out and Potter had taken the brunt of it. Hardly his proudest moment.
He briskly walked through the many corridors and hallways of the Manor until he’d located his mother and son. They were just finishing up a late afternoon tea party, though Scorpius seemed more than excited at the prospect of pancakes.
“If you say so.” Draco struggled not to listen to the never-silent voice in the back of his head, telling him that he didn’t deserve anything at all, least of all nice. Andy wouldn’t accept it, and after years of therapy he knew the voice was lying anyway. It was very difficult not to listen to it though.
Your word of warning regarding wine tasting is duly noted. Thankfully, I’m not keen on wine as it is, so I don’t think I’ll be tempted by that one. I did, in a moment of madness, buy a guitar. Perhaps I’ll teach myself to play as I imagine that will keep my mind off anything too horrible or upsetting. I’ve always wanted to learn. I tried to have a go of my cousin’s electric guitar once. He whined and whined for it one year and got what he wanted. I think he “played” it once and then he never looked at it again. But I still wasn’t allowed a go. He punched me for even looking at it.
“And you think Harry will break up with you because of that?” Again, he couldn’t help it. Relief and the amount of idiocy in Draco’s statement forced him to laugh. “Draco, I’d almost say you don’t know Harry at all, but I know that’s not true. I know this is your self-esteem talking. He
“You’re his family, Ted.” Victoire hissed as she pushed him up the stairs. “You’re allowed to visit him. Not stop twitching and hurry up!”
, his mother had caught the fact that he had omitted to mention her name. That was a quality he didn’t always love. Lying to his mother was next to impossible. “How is she with Scorpius?”
The whistling of the kettle pulled him out of his thoughts, and he quickly pulled it off the stove to make a fresh pot of tea. The small tasks of getting out an extra mug, refilling the milk, picking the tea leaves, calmed him, grounded him. With a sigh, he looked through the kitchen door to the scene in his living room. Harry and Draco had moved to the couch, looking no closer to ever letting the other one go.
Everything was moving past her. People, voices, words, food. She didn’t notice any of it. She was vaguely aware of the fact that there was
“When are you planning to apologise to my mother?” Of course Draco was going to run into Percy at a stationery store. Where else would he meet the most stuck up member of the family? “She’s waiting for it you know. You insulted her, after everything she’s done for you and your son.”
“Sort of. I just don’t know why it’s still so hard for me to come back here.” Draco stared into his apple juice, willing his eyes to stay dry and failing. This pub had offered him his first decent job. It hadn’t been much, just a few shifts a week with poor tips, but it had been proper work. By the book work, with taxes and paychecks and everything. The day he got that phone call was the day he regained a little bit of hope that life just might be worth living. “I used to be so happy here. It was my safe haven.”
He was broken. Knackered after more than two weeks of waiting, hoping, praying to all the Gods he suddenly believed in. In fact, he was too tired to keep hurting like this, the maddening stage of pre-grief shlash pre-hope was wrenching the life out of him. He didn’t have the energy to keep on crying, but the tears still fell.
times, before his father fucked everything up. He blamed it on the upcoming Christmas season and promised himself to never come back once he left. Only he did come back. Four times even, before Potter spotted him and he forgot his blasted book.
“Of course Scorpius will stay part of our family. I told you, he’s a fighter. He’s going to be alright.”
The Healer continued his technical talk, but Draco had zoned out. This was like Scorp’s first sick bed all over again, a long complicated speech full of hopeful words that eventually lead to an even sicker son and an ever stronger curse. The staff always made sure they sounded like they knew what they were doing, but Draco was well aware of the fact that they were all walking in the dark with this thing. Ancient, aggressive and long dormant blood curses were no one’s field of expertise, given that they sometimes didn’t show in anyone for centuries.
But it is like the demons from inside my mind started to occupy the once untainted rooms, furniture and hallways of that house. Each corner had a memory of a panic attack, each pattern on the wall had been followed endlessly by my eyes as I was forced to stay awake after a nightmare.
Draco couldn’t say it. It was one thing to think about losing your son, but it was quite another to actually say it out loud. Luckily, Harry knew what he meant anyway.
That was the first word to come up. Everything was heavy, as if gravity had suddenly tripled. Or maybe he was being held down by something. It couldn’t be water because he didn’t feel wet or cold, but maybe warm sand…
Harry was at anchoring him. How incredibly grateful he was that he had someone at his side this time, someone to keep him warm and make sure he ate and make sure he wasn’t
Harry blinked at her, his brain taking its sweet time to understand who Luna was talking about. He scolded himself when the knut dropped.
“Yes.” Draco beckoned for Harry to come closer, before he turned back to Scorpius. “Can I give you a hug?”
“Hey.” Draco thought Harry had taken longer than necessary for breakfast to grant him some more time, and he was very grateful for that. And now he was even more grateful for the luscious breakfast that Harry carried, much better than the mushy old banana Draco had hoped for while sprinting to the kitchen. “I bring food, and a lazy arse that would very much like to join you in bed, if you let me.”
“As if you could say no if he asked.” Pansy threw her head back and laughed. “Oh God, don’t worry Draco, I still love you even if you are a thirsty arse.”
’s to it, but Draco had never had a such a hopeful talk before. Something inside him told him this was going to work, and he resolutely refused to listen to any of the other voices inside his head.
Despite the Healer’s reassurance that it hadn’t been passed on, Scorpius fell ill, and was diagnosed with the very same blood curse that had killed Draco’s wife only hours after the first symptoms. They had discovered it much sooner than they had with Astoria, but there was still no telling if any form of medication would work. Everything out there was still experimental, and many of the Healers who treated his son saw him more like a guinea pig than an actual human being, handling him much rougher than any three year old should ever be handled.
After a minute or two Potter joined him in his booth, carrying two perfect Latte Macchiatos in his hands with a slice of cake on the side. The promise of caffeine and sweets was really the only reason he perked up a bit, it had nothing to do with the barista in question. Potter could still drop dead for all he cared.
Sadly, it did not. And just like last time, he slowly sunk back into the Heaviness. But at least he was conscious enough to pray for the Spark’s return now.
“As a child pushed into an impossible position by the adults around you.” Potter shook his head, as if he couldn’t believe he had to explain this. “It’s like handing a child a one hundred pound vase, and then getting angry when they drop it. I
that might be able to make me feel less shit in fourth year. You did not see it, no one really did, because I did alright around people, but the nights…
“He apologised for that!” Harry butted in, sounding slightly offended even though it had clearly been a joke. Harry’s eldest son could do no wrong in his eyes, even though he did in the eyes of many others. The divorce had been rough on him because James was the only one of the kids who really remembered his parents being happy together. “Besides, you can’t blame him. You’re pale and you don’t like sunlight. It’s almost as if you were asking for it.”
He nodded, and looked around the waiting room. All three Potter kids were gone, but when he looked the other way, his stomach turned. None other than Mrs Weasley was looking after James, Albus and Lily. Unconsciously, he tightened his hold on Harry.
I’m going to end by telling you who I am. If you haven’t already guessed, that is. You will likely know of me at the very least. Depending on your age, we may even have been at school together which will make these letters awkward - but I don’t regret writing them, and I hope we can continue, even if you never tell me your name. I don’t want to feel embarrassed about seeking help anymore. I know that this doesn’t make me weak.
I need to be able to talk to you freely about everything, but I’m afraid that once you know who I am you won’t want to be my Mind Healer (friend?) anymore. I’d be willing to bet that you know more about me than I know myself. Everyone else seems to.
She had only broken down like this once before, after being forced to watch Fenrir enter her son’s room. Back then, her sister Bella had soon tired of her screeching and
Looking back, knowing how no one had helped him, or any of the other Slytherins to get out of their post-war isolation, it didn’t surprise Harry. The ‘good’ side wouldn’t have them, wouldn’t even educate them why they were wrong, and the bad side never let anyone go. Especially not when you still had family in their claws available for manipulation and blackmail. Harry knew from Regulus how high the price was for freedom. Even a life wasn’t always enough.
“Hey, hey that’s not true, Draco. He has you, he has your mother.” Harry shushed and pulled him close. “Everything considered, Scorpius has a wonderful life, an amazing father, and great friends and you really should stop beating yourself up about this. It’s horrible how you lost Astoria but you’re doing the best you can. No one can ask you to do more than this, ey?”
“Wise words.” Parkinson nodded and sniffed. She was fighting her tears, holding one hand close to her face while her eyes stared at her best friend. She looked incredibly lonely there, in her business suit and bare feet, her best friend a few feet away behind the glass, yet also so far she might never reach him again.
He’d probably advise them to take some time off. Marietta Edgecombe ran a wonderful retreat-like mental health home. It was more low key than the mental ward at St Mungo's, and he’d heard good things about it. But Draco would never abandon his children, and he doubted that the man would fare well in a place that didn’t have his support network.
. Make sure you see them, throw an impromptu party, invite them over for high tea, take them out to dinner. In fact, I would like to assign you some homework with this letter, which is plan something with your friends. It can be anything, from a walk in the park to a holiday to Greece. Just make sure they know how much you appreciate them.
feeling right now, if it already hurt so much to just be an outsider looking in. “Why wouldn’t you hear him?”
Draco just nodded and pulled his knees to his chest while he watched Harry leave. He wasn’t sure if it hurt more or less, knowing that he had a family of his own outside of Scorpius this time around. He just knew it hurt, worse than any
“We don’t know for sure. He’s twitching, but we don’t know if that’s a good sign or not. The Healer has only been in there for a short while.” Hermione spoke like she was listing the financial details of her Ministry department instead of speaking about the fate of one of her best friends. That she found it necessary to detach herself from the situation like that, only made it more clear how serious it was.
, he’d said. Just after the war Draco had been so lost he would have taken anyone’s advice, even that of his shitty father who’d thrown them all under the bus when push came to shove. And with most of his friends out of the country or in some private mental health institution, his father’s advice was all he had.
“They hate me,” Draco sniffed, changing from stubborn boyfriend into a genuinely upset lover. Or maybe Harry had misread the situation all along. “I can’t. Not today.”
“Daddyyyy!” Scorpius ran towards his father as soon as he spotted him, which more than made up for the horrible task of having to get out of bed. He could die a happy man if he never had to leave that bed again. “Daddy, Daddy, the winter orchid is in bloom! You have to see! It gives off light!”
“Very true.” Draco chuckled and held out his hand so Harry could pull him up after getting to his feet. “They’re so tiny yet they eat so much. I don’t know where they store it all.”
Potter caught his gaze, eyes looking horribly sincere. “No. It’s because the Ministry was unfair to you and Hogwarts failed you when it mattered the most.”
His days were long, filled with meetings, and important memos and documents to sign at every hour of the day. But last week had been extra crazy. An unexpected crime wave, an emergency Magical United Nations meeting and the strike of the new, now human, jailers in Azkaban had eaten away every second of his days. So much so that the knowledge of Draco Malfoy being in the hospital, fighting for his life, had nearly slipped his mind.
“Hello, Harry,” she greeted him happily, in her lilting Irish accent. “I didn’t expect to see you today.”
It sounds like you are very lucky to have such a good friend. I know the feeling you describe well - that’s why I spend so much time in my bedroom - that and old habits die hard. Perhaps I should ask my friends if they’d like to come and help me sort my house out. It feels like it might finally be time to do that and I’m sure they’d be happy to help. It would be nice to start making new memories there rather than being constantly reminded of the past. Once again, your words make a lot of sense.
“He has to be, otherwise he wouldn’t get the official Weasley family member certificate. All of you are absolute nutters.”
Teddy hated this. His entire family was in St. Mungo’s, watching over his cousin Draco and he was the only one not there because he was stuck at school.
Your feelings of anger about how dark your past has been are very understandable and valid, though I do hope you do not drown in them. Everyone reacts in their own way, and I know too many people who got angry at the world and locked everyone out, while others got angry at specific people and did very foolish things, while I personally turned my anger on myself, which can get nasty really fast.
A knock on the door startled Draco, but he relaxed again when he saw who it was. “Merlin, you weren’t kidding when you said Weasley would make plenty of food.”
sorry for the long wait, after finishing my consent fest fic i was sorta drained from writing energy for a while, and i struggled to find a proper ending for this chapter. i hope you guys like this anyway<3
“Relax a little and accept that you’re raising him to be a good kid and that you don’t have to stress that much about him?”
I will end this letter by saying again that you are not taking up a lot of my time. In fact, if you do not write I will probably get bored and pet my cat until she goes bald and that would be a great shame, so please feel free to write whatever you like. I would also like you to try and take a moment each day, preferably at random, to ask yourself if you and your actions are at peace. By which I mean, is any of what you have just done, motivated by something that came from the war?
He stopped talking then because his last words had been reduced to barely audible whispers. His throat was almost completely closed off by crying. There was so much more left to say, but he couldn’t get himself to say anything anymore. So instead, he raised Draco’s hand up to his lips and kissed it. Kissed each knuckle, each nail, each fingertip, until he rested his lips against the back of Draco’s hand.
Within a second red hot anger bubbled up in Harry’s chest. How dare Robarts not only refuse to acknowledge the health of his Aurors, but also talk about Draco as if he were a petulant child?
“Enough heavy talk for a bloody lifetime,” Draco responded. He yawned again and settled his head on Harry’s chest. Draco had almost dozed off when Harry brushed a lock of hair out of his face and kissed his forehead.
“That’s not our standard procedure, Mr Malfoy.” The Healer pointed out. Draco grumbled. It wasn’t just Mrs weasley who was stuck in old patterns and habits. Besides him, Harry sat up a little straighter, no doubt wearing his old but still effective Auror face. Though he hated that this was what it took, Draco was more than happy when the movement finally made the Healer recoil. “But I’ll make sure to pass the request along to our staff, Mr Malfoy.”
Now that I’ve done it, I don’t think it is silly to write my thoughts down. In fact, I’ve started to think it’s more silly
“Would you mind terribly to watch the kids today? I was supposed to meet up with Oliver today and sort of forgot.”
. It was… I was walking quite late at night - walking helps me cope if I’m having a bad day. A walk always calms me down. I was in town, walking past all the Muggle nightclubs and pubs. I’m not a big drinker, but being around people who are has never bothered me. I like to walk through the area when it’s busy, there’s always a good atmosphere.
A little further down the hall a door stood slightly ajar, showing a family room with Molly Weasley on a bed fast asleep. Just outside what Pansy believed to be Draco’s room, stood Granger, or Granger-Weasley nowadays. She stood frozen outside the door, staring through the glass window.
going on around her, but she didn’t know what it was and she had never cared less about anything in her entire life.
As for swearing in your writing, please do, if you feel like it. These letters are an outlet for your emotions and shouldn’t adhere to any social etiquette about politeness, since that just is not how thoughts work. Especially when you feel angry, I can see the need to swear.
“Oh.” Uncle Harry’s frown deepened, but then he relaxed and smiled a bit. “Yeah, I guess they are. Thank you Rosie.”
“Luna, actually.” Harry blushed and now he was the one trying to hide his face. “I just-, I love you, but sometimes you’re a little hard to understand. In an emotional sense, I mean. Like, you’ve been through so much and I often think I’m a bit too Gryffindor to see what you’re really about.” Harry sighed, and rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling. “You really didn’t believe for a second I had thought of that on my own, did you?”
He hoped this time that wouldn’t happen. They knew more about the curse now, and if anyone treated Scorpius unfairly he could always set Harry on them. His boyfriend hated using his fame, and Draco was even more reluctant to use Harry’s name to fix his own problems, but when it came to kids they would use everything they could.
“To a normal person, maybe?” Draco whisper yelled over the music. “To mister Adonis over there I am definitely not. And anyway, I am not going over there! If he’ll smile at me, I’ll faint.”
laugh, which Rose hated. She wished people would just explain what she got wrong instead of laugh at her. But at least Harry looked a tiny bit less sad. “Uncle Harry, I think you should kiss your princess.”
of it. Anger burned inside his chest as he took another step back. “I’ve raised more children than you can count.”
“It was supposed to get better,” Harry whispered. “He’d started twitching, they detected brain activity, he was supposed to get
Please don’t pet your cat until she’s bald. I’d feel horrible if that happened because I stopped writing. I have no intention of stopping, even if I feel like this letter is all over the place with my rambling.
“Your potions business runs smoothly without you anywhere near it, Draco.” Harry pointed out. Which was true. Draco did the experimenting and the other members of his team did the production of the finished formula, but they didn’t need him around as much now. “But if you don’t have time I can-”
“Ugh, you’re impossible!” Draco swatted him and pretended to look mad. “And I’m still not a teddy bear.”
Neville laughed. He couldn’t help it. After soaking his entire pyjama with tears, the first thing Draco Posh Git Malfoy asked in between sobs was about
.” The pain he felt inside was somehow audible in Harry’s voice as the man hugged him back just as fierce. “He’s going to be alright. He’s our little fighter, and he’s going to be alright. Both of you are, I promise. You’re not alone this time.”
“I’m sorry daddy,” Scorpius murmured, a heartbreaking quiver in his voice. The little guy was trying to distance himself from Draco, which was difficult as Draco was still carrying him. He would have put him down, but Scorpius couldn’t floo by himself yet and he had to leave this place before Harry came barging in. Scorpius had heard more than enough yelling for one day.
I’m sorry if I’ve brought back any bad memories for you. The attack was really awful, and I hope I never am in that situation again. I will take your advice if I am though. Or, I will try, at least. I’m normally not afraid to get involved in… physical situations. My friends would tell you as much. But that night it was so different to anything I’d ever been involved in at school. Looking back, the school fights I was involved in weren’t that serious (although they seemed it at the time). They weren’t (usually) a life or death situation. I deeply regret the rivalry that I was involved in at school. I said and did things that will never be okay, and if I could see him again now, I’d apologise for them. I never got round to it in the aftermath of the war, but I definitely owe him one. I don’t suppose he’ll accept it, but I need to try. Ultimately we ended up on the same side at the end of the war. If things had been different we may have been on the same side all along.
to show you how to build a proper snowman. You can’t be an expert on hot beverages and cold men at the same time, I refuse to believe it.”
.” Neville sighed, trying very hard not to sound annoyed or pitiful. That wasn’t how he thought about Draco or Harry. He just wanted the both of them to see that they were loved, that they loved each other, and that they didn’t have to be perfect in order for that to happen. “Why can’t you see that?”
As for feeling guilty about not using your magic, I really would advise against that because it really is not a good idea to use uncontrolled magic in a situation like that. When you are angry or afraid or you try to hurt someone when you are in that state, things can quickly go too far. You might try to push people aside with a spell and end up crushing them against a wall. Someone tried to stop me once when I was doing something catastrophically stupid and ended up nearly killing me, while in hindsight not doing anything would have saved both of us a lot of harm.
At least his mother didn’t say things like that. If she believed he deserved something she made sure he got it instead of talking to him. It was how their dynamic worked and why he loved spending time with her so much. Without her, he’d be utterly lost.
“If he ends up being like me he’ll have anxiety and two therapy sessions a week.” Draco sighed, but he chuckled when he saw Harry’s glare. “But fine, I’ll admit I might worry a bit too much about him. But I’m his dad! What else am I supposed to do except worry about him?”
“Yeah, sounds good.” Harry sounded a bit distracted, and Neville soon found out why. Draco was now awake enough to slowly work his mouth from the crook of Harry’s neck to his lips, leaving slow kisses and intimate whispers as he went. Whispers that were no doubt about his episode from before. Apologies for something that didn’t need apologising, shame for something that was brave.
“I do.” Harry laced their fingers together and squeezed. “But there’s no need to apologise for that. Merlin knows you’re the only one stubborn enough to stick with me when I get into one of my moods. Also, if we’re going to be a disaster father and a teddy bear, you are totally the teddy bear.”
“You look happy.” Draco was startled by his mother’s voice and his eyes suddenly flew wide open. His mother stood in the doorway of the bedroom in a morning gown and a set of pyjamas, which Draco could swear were muggle. He was quite baffled.
Recorded Draco sounded seconds away from hyperventilating. Real life Draco looked ashamed of himself, staring a hole in the edge of the rug as he tried to move away from Neville. Not that Neville let him do that. He couldn’t listen to this and
“I mean, a little bit, yeah. Robarts told me not to come back. But that doesn’t mean we can’t still be friends.”
If it hadn’t been for Mrs. Weasley, she would not have eaten or drank anything during those days. It was very odd, being mothered over by a woman her own age who had despised everything Narcissa used to believe in. Especially because Narcissa was a mother herself, and because her own mother had never been so caring.
The witch behind the front desk at St. Mungo’s did raise a suspicious eyebrow, but Victoire dragged Teddy away to the stairs before Teddy could stumble out an explanation.
of your stalking and pining and nagging about that arse trumpet after the war, - and let’s not forget about sixth year!-  you’re bringing the whole nightmare
The only one who can get close to knowing you that well is a very good friend or a lifelong spouse. Definitely not the majority of people though, and definitely not me (unless your name is Pansy Parkinson, which I doubt though I do not know it for sure).
Sometimes people need help, Potter, and that is okay. It took me a lot of pain to come to terms with that. You do not want to know how desperate I was for literally
“I can get ugly,” Harry suggested half seriously. “I could inject botox, wear black lenses, remove my nose, maybe get a huge facial tattoo….”
Kingsley should be asleep. He knew that, his husband knew that, every single person who laid eyes on him knew that. But he simply didn’t care. His authority, which always shut people up with a single glance, usually annoyed him, but today he was grateful for it. Or tonight, actually, given that he’d left the office way past twelve again.
“No.” To her credit, the nurse looked nothing short of gutted when she had to admit that. “We have very little experience with patients who remain in a coma for so long, so it's hard to predict anything. But his main Healer thinks that discovering solid evidence for brain activity like this is, at the very least, not a bad thing. There is still hope, Mrs Parkinson.”
“I did.” Draco glared at Harry before starting to undress. “James didn’t think your story telling had been adequate, so he thought it was a good idea to join us. Albus demanded a longer story because James was there, taking up half the story, and then Scorpius tried to explain that James took up a third, not a half, but he was already half asleep so you can imagine how well that went.” He tossed his clothes on the laundry chair, skipped his own pyjamas and grabbed an old pair of joggers from Harry. When he was awake he’d complain about how vulgar and horrid the things were, but for now he just needed their cozy warmth if he wanted to survive the night. “Budge over, Potter. You’re on my side.”
Just as he deemed everything ready to go, there came a distraught noise from upstairs. Worried Draco might have fallen out of bed, Harry took the stairs two steps at a time, the tray of soup afloat behind him in the air. The noise got louder as he approached his bedroom, sounding ever more like terrified, muffled screams.
Most of that went past her as well though, as she sat there in the waiting room trapped in her haze hoping desperately for her son to wake up. She couldn’t lose him. She simply could not. Draco was her everything. She would kill for him, she would die for him, she would and had done horrible things just to keep him safe. And now she might just lose him, and not a single fiber in her being could cope with that idea.
Draco refused to look at him, opting instead to keep his head buried in the crook of Neville’s neck. “I’m scared we don’t fit, and that it’s actually just me keeping him trapped.”
“But I hurt you,” Harry searched Draco’s face. For what, he didn’t know. “I cursed you and then I left and you were in pain and I didn’t know. You’re always in so much pain, Draco, but you’re so welcome here, love. Please know that you’re the welcomest person to ever be in my life.”
“...Really say how long it will take, but we expect your son to get out of surgery in two to three hours, and as soon as all his vitals check out correctly he’ll be moved to his own room here on the ward. You can wait for him there, the matron knows you don’t have to stick to visiting hours.”
“Draco, you have to sit.” It was James who pulled on his sleeve, making him stop his pacing. Draco didn’t know why he had to sit, why he couldn’t pace. He liked pacing, pacing was good, pacing was something to do other than sit still and wait for the inevitable bad news. But he still sat, because James’ face was dead serious and despite the fact that he was a child Draco couldn’t find it in himself to argue with him. Maybe he even liked being told what to do, if only by Harry’s seven year old son, because then at least he didn’t have to make his own choices. Merlin knew what disasters were bound to happen when he did that.
“She’s always done things exactly the way she wanted to.” Andromeda exchanged a smile with him that made him ache for all the family moments he never had as a child. It had always been him and his parents, plus the occasional business associate of his father. Never a warm smile like this. Draco often wondered why his mother had ever married his father, but he supposed the man had been different before the war. Either that, or his mother hadn’t had that much choice after all when it came to marriage. Most purebloods didn’t.
Life is hard, Potter. I know it is not common practice in our world and I know you Gryffindors all seem very keen on solving your problems alone, even though that usually just makes things worse, but this should be a different scenario. I have never been Dumbledore's greatest fan, even though I would never have been able to kill him, and this just makes me dislike him even more. He should have looked out for you, Potter!
“Yeah, maybe not.” Harry chuckled. “I could kiss him for you, if you like. Pass the affection along.”
“Draco, family will never be a joke to any Potter.” Draco had never heard Harry talk so seriously. “If you still haven’t figured out that you’re stuck with us by now then you’re the idiot in this relationship.”
“Oh, let me make that for you, dearie.” Draco hadn’t noticed her, but suddenly the Weasley matriarch stood in front of them, smiling brightly as she took Scorpius’ hand from him. Scorpius shot an uncomfortable look at his dad, but the need to be polite stopped him from speaking up. Draco would have done so for him, but he missed the moment as Molly kneeled down and pulled Scorpius to her chest. “Your dad can get something to eat while we make you tea in the kitchen. He looks like he could use a good meal.”
He really needed it, if only to take some calming draught so his hands would stop shaking. His mother strode into the room just after he’d swallowed the last drops.
Despite everything Draco couldn’t help but smile as he got up and planted his lips on Harry’s temple. “I’d be lost without you.”
Only of course he would never ever wish for Draco’s death. He would rather sit next to his comatose lover for the rest of his life than put Draco’s body into the ground. Just like his parents, Remus, Tonks, Sirius, Hedwig, and as of last spring Mrs Figg.
“Of course. Sorry, I shouldn’t have joked about that.” Harry had turned serious once he realised Draco was right. Luckily he so far didn’t seem angry yet, though Draco didn’t doubt that was still to come. He probably only got spared now due to the circumstances. “But our kids are tough.” Harry continued. “I’m sure they’ll manage.”
“Maybe,” Harry replied with a deep blush that betrayed his honest answer. “Honestly, thinking back to it I’m surprised my friends didn’t hex me. I should thank them for that at some point.”
I suppose it is now time to finally send my apology letter, about a million years late. I am sorry I was such a colossal arse to you in the past. I am sorry I hurt your friends, I am sorry for all the bad shit I did in the war and before it. I am so so sorry for making your life even harder than it already was.
Draco was shaking. He didn’t know what to do with this information, with this sudden change on his day, with Harry being in his flat. He couldn’t stop staring at a stain on his kitchen cabinet and he couldn’t stop trying to do up his buttons even though Harry tried to keep his hands away from his robes.
“I want to have a family with you Draco.” His voice was somewhat functional again, but only because he’d ran out of tears. “I want to take you out on dates, walk in the park, kiss you goodmorning and goodnight,
seen that coming. Though she’d never been openly hostile or unsupportive, Draco had always had the idea that she wasn’t his greatest fan, either because he was dating her ex or because of his past. This went against all those ideas though. “Thank you, I-, I didn’t like how it went down yesterday, but I felt like I had to take a firm stand.”
“But dad,” Rose frowned, because this sounded more and more like Snow White. “Can’t Harry kiss him then? Like the prince in Snow White did?”
. It wouldn’t be far from the truth if Harry kept looking at him like that. “Hi, I’m gay. Draco! I’m Draco.”
“Come on Draco, I have a lovely couch. Theo made it for me, you know how amazing he is with furniture.” Draco nodded and let himself be guided to the couch. Neville threw a blanket over him as soon as he sat down.
“It’s a lot to take in.” Ron sat down next to him and shoved him lightly. “He’d laugh himself silly, seeing all of us losing the plot like this just because he got a scratch.”
“Hey Rosie.” Uncle Harry lifted his face from his hands to make room for her on his lap. She climbed in and looked at the sleeping man in the bed, wondering if maybe he’d be ticklish. That always woke her up, even if she didn’t like it. But mostly she looked at him because she didn’t want to look at Uncle Harry. Not until she knew how to make him smile again. “It’s boring don’t you think? Hospitals?”
Draco nodded but didn’t say anything. Instead he just held onto him, shaking a little as he silently cried onto his shoulder.
“I would never, and yes.” Draco replied, snark creeping back into his voice even though the tears still hadn’t dried on his face. “You know I’m not a hugger, yet I still hug you because you give the best hugs, so yes, a teddy bear. And with the amount of breakdowns I have I think it’s more than fair to call myself a disaster.”
Suddenly, the doorbell rang. Draco startled, but not enough to fully wake up or gather enough adrenaline to get off the couch. When the doorbell rang again, he picked up his wand and waved it in the general direction of the front door to open it. If it was an axe murderer ready to kill him, then at least he wouldn’t have to get off the couch anymore.
“Yes, I definitely had too much wine during dinner,” Harry answered in the exact same tone of voice as his rant. “But that doesn't mean that I love or admire you any less.”
I grew up in an environment where showing any kind of affection was not done and sometimes I need to be actively reminded of the fact that just because I know in my head that I love my friends, that does not always mean they know that too.
“I try.” Draco let out a deep breath and pressed Harry’s hand closer to his chest. “This entire thing just… triggered my anxiety, made it all so much worse. I was sort of doing okay before, and now, I don’t
But that night, it felt different. It was weird. I had a feeling that something was wrong. Then I was walking past one of the nightclubs and there was this couple - a gay couple - walking the opposite way to me. They’d passed me and then there was a lot of shouting - angry shouting - and when I turned to see what was going on… a large group of men had surrounded the couple. It was… aside from the battle, I’ve never really seen violence on that level. I desperately wanted to intervene, but I couldn’t move. Even if I could have, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything. There were at least ten of them and I’m, well, I’m not the biggest and I was in Muggle London. I couldn’t have taken them on without the use of my wand and the other people that were there wanted nothing to do with it. They pretended not to see what was happening.
He looked up to see Mrs Weasley in the door opening. She was holding two steaming mugs of tea and looked somewhat apologetic. That last bit was the only reason why Draco nodded
“Harry, I’ve been drawn to you since that very first time I saw you in Madam Malkin’s getting your robes fitted. That’s twenty years ago now and in all those years it would have been best for me to hate you, or leave you alone at the very least, and I’ve never been able to do that. I’ve always been drawn to you, I really doubt that will ever change. Weeds are hard to kill.”
This one was still in its early stages, only powerful enough to kill small rodents and birds. Still, Draco led Scorpius to the tea and scones when he got a little too fascinated by the flower. It was always best not to take risks.
