Harry looks at the bottom of his glass, makes the amber liquid twirl against the sides. He takes a sip of it and meets Malfoy’s eyes.
Draco hugs his son and apparates them back home.
Draco shakes his head, too overwhelmed by the scorching heat of Harry’s palms on his chest, the flickers of his thumbs on his nipples. He tugs at Harry's shirt, slides his hands under, along the ridges of his spine.
“I wanted Astoria to come back.” But Draco alone wasn’t enough.
“I’m exhausted. I’m going to bed. You know the way out.”
Harry has hours of Auror training going for him, but he’s drunker than Draco is and so feels the great vibrations of an impact at his jaw, and the pain blooms right after, iron taste following. Harry spits. It looks black in the moonlight.
Harry barely looks in Malfoy’s direction and shuffles to his son.
Harry remembers slapping the report on his desk right before he had been called out, confident that he would look it over later. The nauseous pull the memory causes is not enough to have him relax in his seat.
Malfoy smirks and uncorks the bottle.
Harry nods. It happens every week after that.
Harry slumps and closes his eyes. He opens them when Malfoy speaks again.
“Well, it’s not muggle per se, haven’t you heard that the Burton fellow is a squib? From one of the Twenty-Eight, even. Terribly kept secret, that. And anyway, Scorpius is fascinated.” He waves a hand in Harry’s direction, and yes, Harry sees it now, that Malfoy is already tipsy. “I despair. None of my childhood proper Wizard books appeal to him.”
“Ron, where is he?”
“Ginny doesn’t seem to think that it’s going to work.”
“Yes. Feelings and such. I believe my mother found this remedy most efficient.”
“Yeah,” he breathes out, as Draco pushes into him, smothers him under the weight of his body.
Mr Bruegel raises his wand. Harry is prepared for it, sees the spell flash toward him and bounce against his wandless Protego.
“Don’t tell this to anyone, but I pretended that I had no memory of where I lived and who my parents were. Nobody ever claimed me, so...”
“I’m not a woman, either,” Harry says.
It turns out that British bonding rituals were part of the courting process a few hundred years ago and even if Draco doesn’t have an academic knowledge of them, he has the resources and the need to get things done swiftly. As it is, they read dense paragraphs about love and trust and convoluted sentences that make Harry’s head hurt.
Draco huffs a laugh.
He can taste the lie as it rolls off his tongue.
“You know, asking weird blokes to come over to my house for a shag.”
“He needed it,” he answers simply. “And if you really wanted to thank me, you wouldn’t soak me in rain before leaving without a word.”
Astoria, whos Harry is helping tidy up under the gaze of a distressed house elf, looks at them go and smiles at him mischievously.
The pints thud on the table and a bit of beer sloshes down the sides but doesn’t spill on the already sticky wood.
“Like… An actual wand.” He seems to sit with this information for a second. “Can I hold it?”
“Yeah, they’re locked tight.”
“Hello Mrs Bruegel,” says Draco with a picture-perfect smile, “Thank you for receiving us today. This is the associate I talked to you about.”
Malfoy rolls his eyes.
“That’s actually why I wanted to talk with you. The intricacies of the Statute of Secrecy do not apply to our case, I’m afraid.”
“No visit today?”
“Was the Strangler tempered with?”
Harry buries his face in Draco’s neck, presses his mouth there. He feels him shiver under his breath.
“It doesn’t hurt.”
“My hand is relaxed! My hand is so relaxed that it’s almost dead!”
Malfoy looks as affected as Harry feels. He opens his mouth and exhales slowly, doesn’t speak for a long moment.
There’s a shift in Malfoy’s heartbeat; Harry had not registered that he was so attuned to it until it changed. He clears his throat.
Nobody ever told Harry that becoming a werewolf makes you stupid. Yes, being a werewolf gets him fired; yes, parents keep their kids away from him; yes, crowds smell awful. Everything that Hermione has told him when she began to participate in meetings of the Fund and Aid for Lycanthropy, Lycanthropic Individuals and Communities has come true.
To Draco Malfoy,
“You great bloody wart!” he shouts and throws his fists at Harry.
“That was a heavy sigh,” notes Draco, pulling out of his book long enough to look at Harry.
“You know exactly what I’m talking about.” Harry says, feeling stubborn and small. “If you asked for it, Dumbledore would help you.”
Draco falters, feels himself relax without his consent. It was the recipe for a Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte. He remembers it because he made it after, fingers trembling as he put chocolate all over his front.
Draco feels himself pinch all over, already cursing Potter in his head for letting his son out when he looks this bad before remembrance overcomes him, and he almost trips on his way to greet him. Right. Potter is dead.
And so Harry is left to moan into his cushion for a swift death or the end of the world.
“Potter,” he repeats, and it sounds like a plea.
“I’m not blowing off some steam, I was just having fun.” He remembers Seamus. He wonders if he saw him get arrested. “With friends.”
“What the bloody fuck is that?”
“I don’t wanna leave the kids.”
“Right,” Malfoy says. “Potter, do you have any questions?”
Dear Potter,
Draco sniffs.
Our readers may not be unaware that Harry Potter, saviour of Wizarding Britain, has been under a bit of a strain lately. Between attending the funeral of every victim of the Battle of Hogwarts and repairing said castle back to its glorious prestige, Harry Potter has not known any rest.
“Yes, your business. You’re way too posh to be here.”
Malfoy hums, gliding through the kitchen to Harry, before reaching in the cabinet next to his head for a wine glass. His hair is short again, Harry notes, cropped at the back and brushing his forehead. It looks good, makes him look more settled in his skin.
Malfoy turns and raises a golden-white eyebrow at him.
“Anything, anything.”
Draco swallows and resolves himself. He reaches out with his free hand and grasps the sheet to pull.
Malfoy waves at him from his seat, looking puzzled at how he got into this peculiar predicament.
It appears that someone in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement misplaced the artifacts N°789854A and N°569968U loaned to them by the Department of Mysteries. The investigation they were a part of has since been closed and they have still not made their way back to the Department.
“We’ve already told you everything we had to say,” Mr Bruegel says in clipped tones.
Malfoy nods.
Malfoy looks at him, eyes light in the early evening.
Harry reaches out for Draco’s hands; he yields easily.
“Then it would be a shame if I called our friend Mrs Skeeter for an exclusive on how you spend your Friday evenings while your wife is changing diapers. You can assert authority over her, too.”
“Then don’t,” answers Draco simply, falling over him.
“My source tried to dig up what happened, but nothing came up.”
“You’re going to hate yourself tomorrow,” Draco comments, voice low in the calm of the library.
Harry doesn’t know how it happens; it just does. There are insults thrown, fingers grabbing at collars, the push and pull of their bodies and suddenly, they’re kissing.
He tugs Harry’s beer bottle out of his lax fingers and takes a sip at it, only to frown and give it back. Harry smiles and puts an arm around his body, tugs him infinitesimally closer.
“Mr. Zabini. May I ask what you are doing here so late?”
Harry feels his throat tighten, and he hurriedly drinks some of his tea.
“I’m not sure?”
Harry snorts and straightens up to look at him.
“I could stay,” he concedes.
“Hermione, we have to go. Get ready for a press conference.”
“Yes,” says Draco and he tucks his message between the owl talons. He turns to Harry, “I’m very sorry, love.”
“Celebratory drinks?” Malfoy asks with empty glasses in his hand; cognac, probably.
“I sent it all to the Aurors when you came through the other night. I told you then, but you did not seem receptive to communication,” he adds. “The suspect is in interrogation as we speak.”
“There would be no reason for the Aurors to be at your house if we did not find Dark Magic artefacts as soon as we stepped in.”
“No… I… I think I’m going for a walk.”
Midnight finds them in the library, ostentatiously more sober and poring over volumes that Hermione would give her spine for.
My family and I are leaving for America in two days in the hopes of finding a remedy for Scorpius’ condition.
Draco feels himself tense, taunt like a bow, ready to draw an arrow. He looks away, shoulders rigid and tries to swallow against the knot in his throat.
In the living room, Tommy is reading under the yellow lamplight, and Draco clears his throat twice before Tommy deigns to look at him.
Harry, feeling too strange to completely relax in his seat, scrambles for the list of decisions that took him to this very instant, sharing a teapot with Draco Malfoy and listening to him rant on the best way to enjoy tea.
“Yes,” Harry says, because that was the agreement for today; sleepover for all interested parties. “But asleep and not moving from their bed.”
I cannot say that I trust these Americans, but here we have not once faced a discrimination due to our family name. I believe Scorpius is in good hands. And if that means that I have to endure the noise and singing at every corner of New York City, then I will.
“Is it working then?”
Draco’s gaze flutters to his face and he blinks up at him.
Potter smiles. It spreads beautifully on his mouth, big and teasing.
“Well, thank you,” says Draco very softly.
Harry doesn’t think much about Malfoy after their liaison inevitably dissolves with attempted murder. Or he does, but he’s careful to do it late at night, when the world fades into nightmares. He never tells anyone. He keeps it in his chest through the War and through the forest of Dean and and through the Battle of Hogwarts and through the trials after.
Draco shrugs, the inelegant one stolen from Harry; Pansy’s eyes go round and rounder again.
So instead of saying anything, feeling wrong-footed and gauche however he turns sentences in his head, he pushes Harry against the mattress and perfects his  toe-curling blowjob technique.
“Ahh,” he sighs, and smiles, tiny and embarrassed, with the corners of his mouth. Draco swallows against the heat that tightens in his gut. “I guess we’re in luck then.”
The muggle seems decidedly upset at this answer.
Harry clenches his hand on the table, trying to breath through the temperamental allure of his words. When he looks at Draco, he only sees challenge shine in the anthracite of his eyes, and Harry has to stop himself from biting.
“Just thank me and go the fuck to sleep.”
Malfoy takes an angry sip of his beer, luminous in his gloved-hand. The black leather that hides his bony fingers makes Harry teeth ache. His own fingers burn.
The wet kisses of Malfoy’s reassurance have him yielding the prison of his fingers. Malfoy eases his wrists away from his face and holds them in his hands, gentle pressure opening him up to the space between them.
They go home hand in hand; the mark on their skin has curled further in and Harry trips over his feet looking at it.
“Listen, my shift is over in a few and I don’t want Becca to have to deal with you and whatever weird business you’re up to.”
Draco shakes his head; his hand is fire-hot on Harry’s arm; he wants to let himself burn under the touch.
Harry drinks his beer to cover the blush of his cheeks, the burn he feels in his face.
“Tea first, maybe?”
“I mean, you should stay the night.”
Malfoy is smoking,and it reminds him to fill his lungs with smoke. He exhales choppily, tasting fire and ethanol on his breath.
“It was mixed, actually,” he says, proud of the lightness of his tone.
“Yeah.” He draws in a rattling breath, feels his eyes hurt with too much time spent awake. “Yeah, they were in… The resistance, I guess. The Order of the Phoenix.”
Secretary to the Head of the Department of Mysteries.
Draco pinches him in retaliation and sighs when Harry doesn’t react. He lets himself sag in the mattress.
“Yeah, I’m sure.”
Dear Potter,
“That doesn’t ring a bell,” says Malfoy thoughtfully. “You might want to look under the pillow before you settle down.”
“I don’t imagine Harry’s got any pens?”
Albus eats with a determination that reassures Draco, and he even toasts at the memory of his father without shedding a tear. It’s alien for Draco to raise his glass in Potter’s name, but he indulges Albus and sees the appreciative gaze Scorpius sends his way.
Harry whines, hears himself distantly, as he pushes against the mattress for more friction, licks at Draco’s skin and tastes the salt of his efforts. Everything smells of want and need and Harry sets his nails in the sheets, pulls to hold himself back, just a little bit longer.
June 10, 1998
Malfoy snorts; it isn’t a pretty sound and he looks sheepish for the second it takes to realize he had produced it.
“Hopefully.”
The smile there is for him. Harry itches to kiss it. He focuses back to the end of the waltz; best not to mess it up now.
David is tall, has his head in the clouds (ah!), and spends most of the Sunday luncheon looking around with wide eyes at the self-serving silverware.
Draco opens his mouth. He doesn’t have an answer to that, so he closes it again. Potter continues on smiling.
“Enough,” he answers, pointedly glancing down at Draco’s uncovered crotch with a smirk.
“We both know that werewolf bites only have an effect on a full-moon. And you’ve done scarier things than being a werewolf.” At Harry’s silence, he adds softly, “I was talking about killing Voldemort, not…” he trails off. “Sorry.”
“Well, I thought you would be anxious about telling the children about us.”
Malfoy notes it with a raise of eyebrows and lets Harry order first. They both get cups of smoked black tea, because it pairs beautifully with their lemon chocolate tart, according to Malfoy, and they settle in a corner, where they can watch the sky cloud over.
“No, it’s not what you’re asking, but it’s surely what you’re thinking.. No one can bear being this close to me for this long.”
He pats at Potter’s head, very carefully. The wolf sniffs his hand but doesn’t bite him. Draco feels incredibly stupid.
“I just wanted to… Listen, I don’t want to get into details but the wolf just wants company alright?”
“Alright, did you offer me the heart of a beast that you had vanquished yourself?”
“I promised him I would put him somewhere warm,” Harry says and Draco smiles back at him, small and complicated.
“This,” he waves between them.
“Well, why would anyone think that you manipulated me to help your wife? You will be divorced!”
When he does finally take it off, he has to brace himself against the sink, lock his knees in place. He’s not certain about it, but he has the feeling that the mark is bigger now, elongated and curving around his phalanx. He blinks down at it for a long moment.
Malfoy blinks at him; his eyes go from Harry’s face to the grip he has on his armchair.
Everything feels like a dream, and that’s why when Malfoy’s hands shake too badly to cup water, Harry does it for him. He joins his hands, lets the icy, cold water pool, and presents it to Malfoy. There is a second of wariness in his ghost-grey eyes, stark and sunken in the hungry shape of his face before he bends his silver head over Harry’s offering and drinks. His lips are dry and chapped against Harry’s cold fingers.
“You’re unbelievable.”
Harry sides to Draco and pulls on his scarf until he has it away from his face, where he was previously battling it.
“It’s not posh, but it’s an establishment of decent standing. Or used to be, if you listen to my father. But that isn’t the point. These,” he waves his hand over them without touching them, “are only activated when near witches and wizards.”
Malfoy works his jaw, turns away from Harry and doesn’t look at him when he answers. “It is what it is, Potter. We fuck. We go on our way.”
Draco scrambles to keep his feelings in his chest and not let them spill out across his face.
“You didn’t believe in me any more,” Potter elaborates, and Draco feels like he’s falling through the floors, down, down, down. Guilty, as he had charged himself.
“I was put up for adoption and my parents are lovely people,” he concludes quickly and looks away from Draco.
The sixth floor bathroom is empty and quiet. Harry opens the tap, puts his entire head under the flow of water, and lets the water wash away the lost bits of his mind. He tries not to laugh again, because it doesn’t feel like a day for laughing. Harry thinks he might be going mad. He’s tired and sore and wants his bed.
Draco doesn’t quite know what to do with all this new information; he has never known how to deal with emotions or people baring their souls to him. It never happens in his social circle of pureblood inbreds.
“You look good, Harry,” he says and studiously looks anywhere else but in his direction. “Do you want something to drink?”
Malfoy takes a sip of his tea, a bite of his tart, and leaves Harry to his thoughtful silence.
“Tea?” Draco asks and doesn’t get an answer.
“She has done it twice already, it’s going to be all right.”
Harry frowns but doesn’t say anything.
Harry does so and settles into bed. A weird loneliness presses on him. He vaguely thinks about taking out his own phone, the thin monstrosity Dumbledore got him, but he’s not sure how to operate it smoothly enough to send a message to Hermione without arousing her worries.
Harry sighs.
Draco takes a sharp breath in. When Harry meets his gaze, it’s cloudy with anger. He smells of betrayal.
Harry makes a face; Luna laughs.
He occupies himself with details instead. His sharpened senses are much better at picking up details; Harry is conscious of the room, the touch of fabric against his hands, the granny quality of light going through the window and the knowledge that one of the glass panes is dirtier because of it.
The day is too hot and the black of his robes too thick; he’s sweating heavily and it sharpens the blade of his irritation. He can taste the hurt in the air, it has a shape over the proceedings. Draco feels very removed, watching from a distance, not sharing the same stinging heaviness of friends and families. He’s not happy about Potter’s death, but he can’t say that he’s very much upset about it either. It’s maybe too young to die, and that’s what really bothers him, a reminder of how flimsy life is, for Potter, for him. He doesn’t have to mourn Potter, but he may have to face the new reality that he is not immortal.
Ron makes a dubious noise but doesn’t correct him on it.
“Yessss,” it says, bobbing his head.
“Yes. I delight in advance. I cannot wait for Scorpius to grow up.”
“Very sorry about that, he’s completely pissed. Please don’t…” he darts his eyes to Draco and back to the floor. “Please don’t think badly of him.”
Hogwarts, School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
Draco swallows.
There’s only one door at the end of the hall. Harry knocks on it, his heart a wild beast of anticipation in his chest.
Harry clears his throat.
“You!” he shouts and the intruder pulls the veil away, reveals Potter’s impassive face. “Strip your glamours!”
“What do you want?” asks Draco, and Harry pushes his fingers in Draco silk-soft hair to kiss him.
Malfoy had big hands which, Harry had learned, were great ear scratches and belly scratches and most especially scratches at this place right at the bottom of his spine. Harry remembers whines and happy pants and tail thumping. So many things that should have been prevented by human embarrassment and understanding of social decency but that his wolf was just too happy to do without.
Later, the shirt comes back to his mind. But by then, Draco has experienced three mind-blowing orgasms in quick succession, a feat he didn’t not think possible at his age, and he’s feeling a lot less agitated about it.
“Naked, naked, naked,” chants Draco against his mouth.
Malfoy is right on time, apparating next to Harry in a ringing crack.
Harry gasps as his feet hit the pavement.
Draco despairs; even his chewing is disheartened. He looks at Albus and sees a child that needs care and support, but probably doesn’t get it, because he has a mother dealing with grief and a younger sister stricken in the same manner. There’s no one for Albus, the middle child, the Slytherin Potter.
But Draco sees strawberries redden in autumn, trees lose their leaves in the middle of summer and birds sing in chorus in the darkest of the night. He calls an expert one day, when the entire grounds are covered with soft and young grass at the beginning of January, but by the time she floos to the Manor, everything has disappeared under a thick inch of snow.
“I’m here forever.”
Nothing happens when Draco gets close, and so he marches on, wand raised in front of him and a Protego on his lips. His steps lose in confidence as he gets closer, up until he’s right in front of it and nothing has happened. His heart is a wild beast in his throat, pounding loud enough to echo in his skull.
Malfoy nods on automatic, gives a sort of sympathetic grimace to Harry.
“Come on, Potter,” pants Draco, and Harry comes.
“Malfoy… These grounds are vulnerable. The smallest shift in balance and everything might just collapse.”
“How do you know what my grandfather looked like?” He takes a pause to look up. “Looks like?”
“Muggle school? Circe forbid.”
From Harry’s other side, Ginny snorts. It’s not attractive; Harry glares at her.
David nods, looks at Harry, all of Harry, with a bit of an alarmed twitch to his mouth.
If there is anything that you need, don’t hesitate to ask, I know what it is like to have a child in pain.
Harry hugs him tight and breathes heavily against his ear and they hurry home, breaking into a jog and scaring families out for a walk. It’s all worth it when Draco pushes Harry onto the bed and has his way with him.
His wife scoffs. “Peter? No I wouldn’t say, no.” She waves a hand at her husband.
At the table, a waitress is bending down to pick up his fork; Harry feels himself flush with embarrassment.
“I have.”
“Oh yes, let us all put the blame on my Grandfather Abraxas’s proclivities! You Aurors  look for reasons to send me to Azkaban by looking in rooms where no one has set foot in two centuries.”
“You know, Harry, we worry about you. You don’t talk to us anymore.”
David stops staring at the floating plate of smoking poultry long enough to give a hesitant smile back.
Harry swallows and nods, only then Draco takes back his hand. They stare at each other. Harry cannot believe what he has just said. He feels like the words slipped out of his mouth, where he had them stored for the last month or so. Harry was thinking of doing it right.
“Yeah, I’m alright.”
“I’m not a lawyer.”
Malfoy only sighs. They fall into silence, and Harry prepares himself for an uncomfortable night. His arse is already falling asleep on the concrete bench.
“You’re grown boys, I’m sure you’ll manage to introduce yourselves to each other. Good night, gentlemen. Mr. Potter, your uniform will be delivered in the morning.”
Harry is debating between beans on toast or fried eggs for dinner when someone knocks on the door.
“Teddy has nothing to do with that.”
Harry likes being Head Auror. The fact that he complains about it everyday, and the headache he leaves his office with are just minor setbacks. It’s the life he’s wanted since he was eighteen.
It doesn’t get old; it might never and what a terrifying thought.
“Yes you can, but you usually don’t.” Harry sighs. “Hermione asked you?”
Draco looks back at them, expression open and encouraging.
Harry’s flat is less messy than expected. Draco doesn’t know what he expected exactly, but it certainly isn’t the neat living room they spill into, with the small decorative cushions and the overloaded bookshelves. It’s probably Harry’s hair that gives this impression; it curls, defying gravity and common sense, looking unkempt and rugged, so Draco had surmised his home would follow suit.
“I gathered.” Harry smiles.
“Sure,” and he carefully lays it across his palm.
“No tripping,” Harry says into the space between them.
“Can I use your Floo?” he asks, feeling sweat in the palms of his hands.
“That I was gay? I didn’t know. It’s a very recent discovery.”
And so Draco tells him of the first drink in the ruins of the Hogwarts castle and the ceremonial lay of a weapon at his feet (honestly, Harry, the definition of weapon seems pretty loose here. Whatever could hurt and I have no idea when that could have been). They agree that the blood-sharing and hands bound together happened in muggle jail.
Potter doesn’t say anything for the longest time.
“You never want to talk about it. You’ve not wanted to talk about it for six months now.” Her mouth thins in a line. “Listen, Harry… Hermione is only trying to help.”
Draco swallows the rest of his complaints and tears off his pants.
Harry scoffs, pushes a curl out of his eyes; it’s tacky with blood and sticks to his skin.
Harry looks to his side and there he is, awake but not yet aware that he’s being watched, propped up against two pillows. The noises of the house filter through the decaying Silencing Charms.
Harry has a knot in his throat the size of America. He clears it with some difficulty.
“You don’t believe me,” says Draco. He’s a bit hurt and it smarts even more knowing that he did not expect it. It’s an exercise in subtlety to not let it show on his face. “Well, thankfully, I have brought something.”
“You don’t happen to have any hangover potion on you?” he asks, hopelessly.
She unwinds her scarf viciously and strides through Grimmauld to the kitchen. Harry trails after, waiting for his sentencing. Hermione thumps two glasses on the table, so violently they almost tip over; she pours the liquor in an angry slosh and nods at Harry to take a seat. He doesn’t argue.
“Anyway,” Harry starts, “I’m going back to uni soon, so what I was asking is…” He grabs at Draco and pulls him to a stop. He looks at him with his huge green eyes, barely hidden by the glasses. “Do you think you would be interested in moving to Oxford soon?”
Harry cups his face in his hands. They’re dry and a bit rough; they sweep the remaining charms away and Draco sags.
“That’s… Voldemort left deep wounds here.”
Draco frowns and follows after Harry when he’s a few steps ahead.
So of course, it’s not even two hours later that he’s bothered, mid-chapter. The barks are sharp and demanding, filtering in through the drapes. Draco first dismisses it as the old man living at the village walking his particularly rambunctious dog, but when it doesn’t fade away in the settling night, he pauses. Draco goes to his window and leans over, scrutinizes the grounds and the driveway.
Harry snorts, pushes his glasses up his nose.
“Well, I think she’s been with her boyfriend for a few years now.” Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him. “Her muggle boyfriend.”
“You’re not making it very attractive, Malfoy, with the punching and all, you know.”
Harry winces.
Hermione would have been proud to see him study like that, but he doesn’t think about it too much.
It seems inappropriate somehow, that Harry Potter’s first meal after returning from the dead is a leftover from the last supper.
Draco turns the ceramic cup in his hands; the muggle crosses his arms, aggressively flexing.
Chaperones have been arranged to lead the guests to and from the party. No witch or wizard is allowed to walk unaccompanied through the Department.
“I get needing to blow some steam off.” Draco seems to think of it. “Ah, poor Potter, having me torture you again, years after being schoolboys.”
“Hey!” he calls again, and walks to the figure with an aggressiveness he has very little of. “Answer when I talk to you! You’re not supposed to be here!”
“Very nice to see you, Mr Bruegel,” says Malfoy and rises to shake his hand. Harry doesn’t bother.
“Really, Harry, you closed the wards off to her.”
The snake slithers, turns around Draco’s long finger.
“I very well can.” He answers, scowling down at Harry, seeing his face expand with a grin. “I did! It’s still running away when you leave your house without giving much of a warning to anyone!” Harry makes a dubious face. “Well, what would you know about running away?”
Harry shakes his head.
“Peter?” Mrs Bruegel asks, frowning anxiously at her husband.
“Are you asking me to…”
Having a grown werewolf making himself at home in his lap is not catastrophically bad. Surprisingly. Draco would probably find it enjoyable if he did not have the omnipresent knowledge that a human being hides under its fur.
“Don’t be. It’s my fault… Harry.” She breathes in wetly, Harry looks away because he cannot witness her hurt any more. It’s too sharp, he might cut himself on it. “Harry, look at me.” He does. “I don’t think I like men.”
“You could stay the night,” says Harry, very quiet in the stillness of the room.
“Ah.”
He bends down to recover the package under the bed, where he had shoved it last night. He opens it and gets his hand on an envelope; he had all but forgotten about his Mother after the unending spinning of apparitions. He finds himself robbed of his breath, staring at the cream-coloured paper.
“Hello,” Harry says again and pulls away to look at Draco’s put-upon face. He smiles when he sees it.
They watch the dragon land, the grooves of Harry’s palm under its talons. The dragon walks around, unsteady with his wings spread, before turning on itself and settling down, head cushioned on Harry’s thumb.
He swallows around his discomfort.
“Draco?”
The day is incredibly hot and Harry doesn’t think he will be able to withstand the constraint of his tie for more than the formal ceremony; supposing he finds a way to tie it without his future-husband. Draco really has an unrivalled knack for tailoring charms and Harry has strict instructions not to seek him out, for tradition’s sake.
“Aren’t hags all women?”
“Good. Now that you’ve admitted that, you don’t have a lot of options. You either quit, or you change things around for it to be enjoyable.”
“Telephone, but of course you wouldn’t. You’re too good for that.”
Draco straddles him to shed his coat and shirt and Harry laughs at his desperation, fumbles with the buttons until Draco tugs sharply enough to be free of clothes.
“Do I have to? I only got what I deserved as a citizen of Wizarding Britain: respect.”
Harry sits on his couch and tries not to think. He had expected the knot of fury and indignation in his chest to disappear after his aggressor got arrested, but instead it just squirms on itself, pulling tightly at his heartstrings as he follows the proceedings of the trial in the Prophet.
“Hello,” Harry answers and cannot stop the grin that spills over his face.
“Your posh school?”
Harry’s wedding band sits in the pocket of his jeans, and he feels ten times heavier without it. He cannot stop reaching for Draco’s hand and the reassuring weight of his fingers in his. Draco indulges him with a smile, before diving back into his work with enthusiasm and the desire to get to the bottom of things before dawn.
Harry stirs, but doesn’t turn.
The gates open and Potter comes barreling in, aggressively sniffing Draco’s crotch in greeting. Draco pushes him away with a horrified gasp.
Potter hums but doesn’t answer. He simply closes his eyes and the sun slanting over his face lights his skin in shades of gold. Draco almost spills his ink all over his paperwork.
“What’s yours then?”
“Merlin, Potter,” Malfoy breathes out and pushes a hand in Harry’s hair. Harry wishes that his locks would spontaneously turn to a Devil’s Snare, that they’d trap Malfoy’s hand here, where he can see him. Where he’s pliant and amenable to the current activities. He bites on Malfoy’s lower lip at the thought.
Draco snorts. A second later, Harry feels pressure against his throat, he pulls away just enough to look down at the fabric neatly twisting on itself and then the knot sitting between his collarbones.
an answer for Potter.
“What are you thinking?”
He sees Mimpsy, his house-elf, coming to get water boiling but Draco waves her away and she goes back to her apartment, by the pantry. He rises to put a kettle on the stove and chooses a selection of calming herbal teas from his personal stash.
Harry snorts and Draco is alarmed enough by the sound to properly look at him.
“You also forgot the most important information.” Draco smiles around the rim of his teacup. “You’re a wizard, Harry.”
They go and the rain goes with them. Draco is left, lashes wet and sticky, looking at Potter all against him, fever hot through his soaked clothes.
Draco hesitates for a moment; it feels incredibly intimate to hand his wand to someone else, someone that is not from his family.
Draco shrugs (he would like to believe that he has mastered the way to make it look elegant in the span of three days watching Harry do it inelegantly).
Harry hums.
Draco swallows. He does not succeed in swallowing down his own guilt, but he does meet Potter’s eyes without recoiling.
“So sorry to bother you, but could you tell me where I could find the adequate materials to compose a letter?”
Draco gasps himself awake and immediately regrets it. His neck feels wrung too tight for the length of his spine and he opens his eyes to his office, brightly lit by the mid-morning sun.
He awakes a short while later and looks over at Harry, who’s staring at the ceiling, seemingly unseeing.
“Are you sure?”
“I should divorce Ginny,” he says and sips from his cup.
“God, you’re weird.”
He easily shrugs off his kid and turns to him. He hands him his glass; best not to spill anything on his suit before the ceremony. James takes it with a grimace.
The funeral is an awful affair. Draco goes in support of Scorpius, who himself is there in support of Albus. He stays behind and keeps an eye on his son from afar. Scorpius hangs his head, close enough to touch Albus and lets Ginny Weasley, Potter’s ex-wife, hold him in a long febrile embrace.
“Yeah, okay,” says Harry, sounding a little bit helpless, and shedding his last garment once and for all.
“Ah, his majesty wakes at last.”
Malfoy narrows his eyes at him.
“Yes,” he rasps.
“I have to go now,” he says and takes a breath to consider Harry. “Same time next week?”
“Have fun!” Hermione calls to both Harry and her husband.
“Yes, thank you for your great observational skills.”
“I’m nineteen.”
“I’m going to be so hot,” he complains.
“You shouldn't avoid Edward because you don’t want to see me.”
The snake curls a bit tighter.
Harry gapes but doesn’t make another move to obliterate the dragon. Draco slowly opens his hands to release it and doesn’t look at the mess of his reddened flesh, but rather at the long, sinewy flutter of its wings. Harry is mesmerized; he tenses when the dragon gets near him, sending a lick of fire his way, air heavy with the scent of coals and sulphur, but he simply looks.
They share delicious chocolate-coated biscuits over two cups of subpar tea in the mess of bedsheets, feeling buzzy with pleasure. Draco has the distinct sensation of newly-oiled joints, feeling like a well clogged machine better than any potion from Madam Pomfrey ever could. Harry’s hair makes him look as shagged out as he is, and the lopsided grin he has been sporting for the last half an hour cannot deny his high spirits.
By the time they’ve made it home and eaten curry for dinner, Draco is too full to move, too tired to mention it, and so he lets Harry push him onto the mattress and deliciously rut against him until completion. They barely trade a last kiss before Draco is pulled under, warm skin soothed by the tingly cold of a fresh sheet. It almost feels like magic.
“I have no business.”
“You can’t run away, you’re nineteen.” Harry says, but he’s teasing, smiling, trustful and quiet at the corner of his mouth.
Harry falls in Draco’s open arms and feels like he would drown without the desire Draco is pushing under his skin. He’s buoyant with lust, floating over his usual worries and sinking into Draco’s flesh.
“Winter is winter. It would be unbecoming to not have snow for your guests to enjoy when you’re still in season.” At Harry’s raised eyebrows, he adds, “The grounds are charmed to hold the snow longer.”
Harry reaches for the box in the middle; he has barely grazed the top when the box opens, flaps pushed apart by a soaring dragon.
Harry straightens from his slouch, feels a cold sweat prickle at all of his skin.
“Good night, Potter. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Yes,” she says, unbothered. “You could say that his job is an error.”
Potter only looks at him, panting and an ear cocked towards him hopefully. Draco sighs heavily, tries to slow the wild pulse of his heart. Potter is overtly non violent, he can absolutely do this.
“A word, Malfoy?”
His attention is caught by a Prophet’s clipping pinned to the wall and Harry falters in his steps.
He stands in front of his dresser and wishes for the formality his Auror robes would automatically provide. He had liked the layers, like an armour against the world. In red, he wasn’t Harry Potter, but another protector. Someone everyone could turn to in need.
Ron opens his mouth to answer but his interrupted by Hermione dropping into his lap.
Draco feels himself pinch around the mouth. It was two months before Potter’s divorce.
They share a moment of silence; it’s strange in the way that Harry finds comfort in it, doesn’t feel harassed to say anything to fill the quiet. His headache recedes like the sea, but never comes back, already forgotten when he scratches at his beard, watching the day go by outside.
Draco rubs at his arm, scowling down at her.
Harry pants, almost deaf to Draco’s moans. He doesn’t dare move yet; pleasure is a raw wild thing tightening in his gut and he shakes on it, feels only Draco in him and under him and his hands marking bruises on his skin.
Draco answers with a confused sort of shrug. Tommy’s smirk looks awful.
Harry feels himself blush, heat spilling on his cheeks with the help of alcohol.
Draco, with trembling fingers, decides to be brave. He tucks his wand in the pocket of his robe.
He swallows. “Get on with it, you git.”
Malfoy looks at him with thunder in his eyes; Harry’s heart jumps in his chest, a flip that pushes his organs aside.
“I know, I wanna see him. It’s me, Malfoy, I am Harry Potter.”
Draco has thought of finding the most disgusting place around and sending a card to his father, but he has yet to settle on an address.
“What?”
“He was just pissed, Draco, it’s alright.”
“What do you mean?”
“Yeah,” he answers, breathless.
“You’re an arsehole from the Twenty-Eight, aren’t you?” someone spits too close to them.
Harry feels it like a fist against his ribs, cold dread in his stomach. He had stupidly hoped that the sex wasn’t such a simple affair; that he could build trust from it and extend that to Malfoy like an olive branch. That he could get him to seek help from the right people. The certainty that Malfoy doesn’t care one bit about him slides uneasily at the back of his throat; Harry doesn’t dare examine why.
“Ah.” Malfoy sits back down and gestures at him to do the same. “I thought your policy was to not talk about it.”
£23.50
Draco struggles to a sitting position, shirt tacky with sweat and feeling like his couch is swallowing him in its folds of leather. There are ants and needles in his left leg and he stumbles to the windows, pulls them open with relief. The breeze caresses his skin with the promise of cool reprieve.
Malfoy is close enough to speak into his ear. “I’ve found that Muggles don’t have a similar understanding of personal space as we do and that this issue is best dealt with a lot of assurance when walking.”
“What kind of cruel joke is this? His son is here! You have no business wearing his dead father’s face!” he shouts at the illusion.
Malfoy harrumphs, but Harry doesn’t pay any attention to him. He stands up and goes to the bars, leans on them to see if there’s someone around. Malfoy follows with an outraged gasp. There’s an officer eating a chocolate bar, watching his massive computer there.
“Your disappearance hasn’t been made public yet. Blaise is in the know, now that he’s shagging the Gryffindor Auror twat, and Longbottom has not spilled anything about it yet, so you still have time.”
“Ah, but getting tea of course. I’ve found this wonderful little shop recently with Scorpius. He’s very adventurous with his tastes.”
Draco shakes his head, feels his chest tighten around the ache there. He misses his mother, he misses Pansy, but he fears what his father would do to him now that he’s an adult, of age, and expected to be someone he consciously rejects, someone he didn’t grow up to be.
“The kids can stay there.”
“Very well, I’ll be on my way now. I gather that I will see you next Sunday at Andromeda’s then?”
“I didn’t know you were involved with FALLIC,” he says, straight-faced.
And he flickers back into absence. Malfoy stares at the bark where Potter was leaning. He tries not to shiver, but his teeth hurt with how tense he is. He shudders and cannot stop himself.
Draco closes his fists tight, joints white.
Harry nods and tries not to wince visibly. He stops behind Teddy's seat and ruffles his purple-streaked blond head.
Harry sits up and pushes them up his nose. Ginny sits herself in an armchair in front of him in an ill-fitting shirt and smart trousers.
“Then you have very little of importance in your notes,” he rasps.
“Come on,” he says and touches him lightly, soft pressure against his arm. “Let me show you.”
Harry sinks into the chair, and Luna lets go of him with a satisfied little nod.
Scorpius gleams like a jewel through the garden; blond hair where light ricochets, almost blinding. Albus and him jump around on the grass, agile and young, careless of everything and safe in the knowledge of their parents watching over.
“Right,” he says with a lot scepticism.
“You don’t have a job!” Draco says, maybe too loud.
“Yeah, sure.” He looks at Mrs. Bruegel and she uncomfortably stares back at him. “Your father had many enemies. Do you remember if any of them said anything in particular? Death threats? Even threats of violence?”
Harry nods through the blooming migraine and tries to relax when Malfoy circles his elbow with his hand, grip sure and gentle. They pull through space, like elastic-bands stretched too thin, travelling too fast when they’re released.
It’s not the transparent painted nails and not the skirts they touch but never buy, and not the desire to be held that stop Harry in their tracks and make them wonder when they have stopped being a man. Harry could do and want all of that without straying from the prickly certitude of their gender.
Harry nods numbly, dread falling icy-cold over his head. Malfoy looks at him with very sharp eyes.
“A Dark Lord, to whom your Father was allied, and is now trying to bring back to life?”
Draco expects something to happen, but only watches Potter trying to push against his gate, whining. He has to bite back a smile despite himself; he shouldn’t find the situation funny, he has a werewolf on his hands. A rather sedate (and, from experience, cooperating) werewolf, but a werewolf all the same.
“You’re not supposed to be here!” he shouts in Malfoy’s ear.
“Nobody gave me a name when this,” he waves at his own self, “happened.”
Draco doesn’t hear; or he does, but would swear on his life that he didn’t. That Harry was silent, probably asleep for most of the day. The truth is theirs and theirs only.
Harry snorts a laugh.
“I don’t know what to think.”
“Still, nothing to do with Teddy.”
“No.” He blinks at Harry. “No, it would be worse to wake them up now. Better to let them have their tantrums separately.”
Draco L. Malfoy.
Malfoy smiles, a tad self deprecating.
Harry nods.
It sounds innocuous enough that it takes a few seconds for Draco to feel alarmed, and when he does, he stops neatly in his tracks and finds himself flooded with the feelings of ants in his fingers, eating away at his control.
Fuck Dumbledore for waking up fifteen years too late and deciding that the Dursleys weren’t fit for the education of their nephew. Fuck Dumbledore for not allowing him to stay with Hermione and Ron. And fuck Dumbledore for sending him off to the poshest school he could find this side of the equator.
“I know. His name is David, and he seems like a proper gentleman. He doesn’t even mind that she’s married to a poof.” At Harry’s dismal expression, adds, “Of course, he didn’t say it in so many words.”
Harry spends two days on his couch, embarrassed and miserable, before deciding to do something about it.
Harry looks at him without an answer. He licks his lips.
To Harry James Potter,
Harry nods, eyes closed and pinching heat spreading to his thighs. There’s a build-up in his chest that prevents him from breathing properly and he feels dizzy with the dual sensation of pressure inside, arching to chase the electric quality of it.
“No,” Draco repeats more fervently. “No, how dare you? How dare you use his face?”
“Whatever. Why not? Where are you staying?”
It seems to rob the muggle of his voice. He gapes at Draco for a second before shaking himself, red making his skin bloom darker.
“Mine, then. Come on.” And he gestures to the exit.
Draco looks up from his book and blinks at Harry, where he’s standing at the door.
He’s shivering, Harry notes, and he takes a step closer, wants to share a bit of his warmth.
Scorpius bobs his head in assent and goes back to his book. He doesn’t ask any question.
“Alright then, Potter.”
Harry finishes his glass with a large swallow and slides it to Malfoy.
“I… That was not my intent.”
In a matter of days, Maybelle Purplestock is sentenced to life in Azkaban. Harry doesn’t know how to feel about that, but he knows what he doesn’t feel: relief.
Harry grins.
Harry doesn’t look at him and Draco softly tugs on a wild strand of hair, where it’s curling over his ear.
Harry smiles, feels the ticklish flops of his heart.
“We’ve been married for years already. I think I can handle looking at him.”
here to protect this land, I own it!” The words burst out of his chest.
“What are we doing there, then?”
Harry follows him back inside, eyes fixed on the glittery bounce of his head. His jaw hurts with the frustration he keeps there.
Harry snorts.
“Yes, it would be a real shame if filthy Death Eaters could profit from it, really.”
“But we are.”
“That’s not true,” says Harry, stubborn. He sticks out his jaw and swallows a good mouthful of alcohol in an effort to fall from tipsiness to full-on drunkenness faster.
Draco is thinking of Wizarding Britain, feeling both nostalgic and vindicated, when Harry props himself up on an elbow to look at him.
“Well, if you’ll excuse me,” he says, slipping away from his son’s grasp and breaking into a jog when he tries to follow.
“Don’t be an idiot, Potter,” he does that, sometimes, call him Potter when he’s feeling a bit vindictive or nostalgic. Or defensive, Harry adds mentally. “I dried them a few days ago.”
Harry laughs; his heart flutters in a fond arrhythmic beat. He ignores it and turns to the french windows, peer through them at the frozen landscape, endless white all around.
“She’s good, very tired of being pregnant, but good.” He turns to Teddy, “She would have loved to come tonight, but her back is giving her hell,” he assures him.
“Astoria is perfectly aware of my whereabouts.”
“A tad?” Harry gasps painfully. “It’s a bloody nightmare. What the hell was that?”
“I’m afraid there’s been an emergency. I have to go.” He considers Harry for a second. “We’ll have to cut this pleasant talk short. I’ll say goodbye.”
Potter shrugs.
“Oh, yes, fantastically. David is a charming man. I met him, you know. He’s a meteorologist.” Malfoy smiles, small and amused at the corner of his mouth. “He studies weather. Isn’t that fascinating? To study something on which you have no impact whatsoever?”
Draco turns up his nose.
Harry nods on a choppy exhale.
“But how can I change anything?”
Yours sincerely,
“Go take a shower while I check on the kids. It’s suspicious that they haven’t begun to bother us.”
Draco sniffs and shrugs on his shirt, passes a hand through his hair to push it back.
“You’re alright there?” Harry asks.
He presses a kiss between Harry’s shoulders, and lingers for an additional second before pulling out of the embrace. He takes a sharp inhale and closes his eyes against the sting of tears. Draco is well-aware that this could be the last he sees of Harry for a while. He hopes Pansy hasn’t been careless.
Harry feels smile etch itself in his face and is hopeless to stop it.
Harry knows, but it still hurts him when Ginny tells him that he’s childish. His eyes water when Luna gently presses at a tender spot on his cheekbone.
Harry wishes he could walk away on that  perfect parting repartee. As it is, he relaxes in his seat and looks at the ceiling. A stain looks like a dancing horse; Harry almost calls for James to come see it.
“Sorry,” Malfoy says, his voice barely a rasp.
“Listen,” he rasps, voice too rough, “You know what? I’ll just go. We can talk about it later.”
“Merlin, are you there yet or do I have to scream some more?”
Malfoy flinches at that, taking a step back.
Harry feels adrift at sea, anchored only by Draco’s hands at his hips, by his warm exhales on the skin of his throat. It’s too early in the night to get lost in someone’s eyes, but Harry tries desperately, feels like there’s fifteen years of desire stored up in his chest squirming to get out. He cannot speak; his mouth doesn’t stray far enough from Draco for him to talk.
Malfoy bids goodnight to everyone with a kiss, with the exception of Harry, who watches him walk away, through the door, then through the windows and the rain. The mark under his ring burns, seems to warm the metal. It’s a shock against the rain-cold of his fingers.
Harry carefully picks himself up and hobbles down the halls of the Manor, up until he’s outside the Manor’s gate, feeling even more naked under the blue open sky. He apparates back, feeling himself burn crimson by both sun and shame.
“Harry, Harry,” heaves Draco, “I’m going to come. I can’t…”
“I would not have ruled it as an accident,” Harry says, mostly to distract himself. Malfoy smells familiar and it’s both strange and comforting. “The door was tempered with.”
“Now, I’ve got a white mark where my ring was. It’s very noticeable.”
“It’s ten. But why is your hair brown? Your eyebrows too.”
Potter rolls his eyes.
“Yeah, erm. Hello,” he says, helpfully, instead of falling to his feet and burying his head in Malfoy’s stomach.
Life doesn’t change that much. He still wakes up at the crack of dawn with feet in his face (James or Al, depending on the day, never Lily, who sleeps well into the morning if given the occasion.He still blearily makes breakfast for his kids while Ginny is away on training. He still coerces them into their clothes before dropping them off at school.
They get off the bus and Harry steers him around, against the glare of the sun on the white facades of buildings. The day is tipping into evening and so Draco keeps his head down and feels the top of his ears burn red, the heat burning against the nape of his neck.
“Harry Potter,” he says and extends a hand.
Harry looks up. “Hello to you too, Malfoy,” he says calmly. “Mrs Malfoy,” he adds belatedly to Narcissa Malfoy, who looks regal and untouched by time next to her son.
“Don’t bother. They took all of our belongings. Wouldn’t want us to poke our eyes out.”
“That boy needs some maternal affection,” says Rosedriah Dred, 54 years old, in Rye, East Sussex. “With the dreadful murder of his mum when he was so young, he deserves it! I would give it to him if he stopped by for crumpets. With this war, I haven’t seen my son in a long time. He’s been away in Europe, aiding the Order of the Phoenix from there and he has yet to come back. I’m sure there’s a mess to clean up there too, and my son is very competent with this kind of thing. Anyway, I have plenty of love to give and Harry should come eat my blueberry muffins.”
“Draco,” he says firmly.
“But… You were quite young, didn't people try to take you back home?” They did in Wizarding Britain. Ask Neville Longbottom.
They don’t have the excuse of alcohol this time. The night is young, and Harry is sober when he stumbles upon the dancefloor of another anonymous gay club. He sees Draco, swaying in the red-purple-pink light. His hair is an artist’s pallet, reflecting colours like water. Harry is compelled to get closer, to be here until Draco looks at him.
Harry turns his back to the room and sleeps. At least, tries to.
No, Harry refuses to talk about that.
Harry tries not to trip over his feet, floored that Malfoy apparently thinks them close enough to share amusing confidences. Life has been too weird lately; Harry definitely feels like he’s dreaming, moving without purpose from one scene to the next.
He takes a firm hold of Potter’s scruff and tugs him along. Potter happily trails next to him. Draco is conscious that Potter wouldn’t move if he didn’t want to.
When Harry wakes up the next morning, there are two owls hanging out of his window. The first he recognizes as Hermione’s. He grunts at it in annoyance. He doesn’t want to bother with yet another migraine-inducing request to consider getting on the board of the Fund and Aid for Lycanthropy, Lycanthropic Individuals and Communities.
“I do!” he shouts, and Harry feels his heart in his throat. “I do,” Malfoy adds, more sedately. “Your lot is simply nitpicking things we overlooked when we renovated the Manor.”
Draco’s smile is genuine, but lacks the grand joy of his habitual grin. Harry waits for him to talk.
“Yes, let’s. What the bloody hell is wrong with you?”
Harry frowns; he feels the familiar creases of his worry in his face and thinks back to Ginny telling him to stop, or else.
“Why did you call me?” he asks instead.
Now, he fishes for his cleanest dress shirt and a pair of jeans that is not yet torn at the knees and hopes it’s enough.
“Gay sex is nothing but decadent, Harry. The end goal is rarely a baby.” His eyes shine almost blue in the afternoon light.
Draco sighs.
He groans, feet and hands cold, body aching. He mildly hoped that everything was a very active, very surrealist dream made up by his canine mind. But no such luck.
It’s foolishness that pushes Harry to talk. He’s still reeling from Malfoy’s all-encompassing warmth and a mind-blowing orgasm, the quiet of his mind not loud enough to drown out his words.
“What the fuck is wrong with you?” He furiously takes Draco’s money from him and shifts through the stack of bills before pushing two under his cup. He then shoves it back in Draco’s pocket for him. “Do you just walk around with a bank vault in your pocket? We’re gonna get mugged. Fucking hell.”
They stare at each other.
Draco gets off his horse and advance on him, pulling his wand of his sheath against his forearm. He casts a strong Revelio in his direction and Potter-not-Potter raises his hands in innocence and waits for the spell to hit him. Nothing happens. Draco doesn’t stop advancing on him, until he has him leaning against the tree, wand at his throat, Draco fuming from the other hand.
“Is that an actual thing?”
After that, Draco spends most of his free time in the garden, looking over his shoulder when he strolls through the fragrant meadows, in high leather boots against the wild flora.
“In fourth year…”
“You said your wand reacted well to me,” Harry says, tone light and teasing.
“Was it a good night?” she asks, instantaneously suspicious.
Scorpius opens the door, already bundled up in excessive winter gear and jumping around, tugging on Al’s hand and Harry is too caught up in trying to not lose sight of them at the corner of corridors that he stops thinking about it altogether.
“I thought it would be too late in the season for snow, but yours look absolutely wonderful. Very fight appropriate.”
Malfoy puts his teacup on the table, folding his hands in his lap. Harry knows that he’s poised for action, careful tension in the line of his shoulders. “Then, I’m the one asking. Where were you?”
Harry hears the clatters and hushed instructions of those who have something to hide and the door opens.
“No.”
“Trust me, it would have been worse if I had told you.”
Draco blinks at him and takes a deliberate sip of coffee. It’s lukewarm and tastes vile, but it occupies his hands and hides his face while he tries to puzzle out what the man’s trying to tell him.
By the time they get to the woods, he’s winded. Potter stops him with a hand at his elbow and puts another at his mouth to urge him silent. Draco doesn’t say a word and obey; he bites his lips hard to not complain.
“Hey!” Harry shouts, once and a second time, until he gets his attention. “Why are we handcuffed?”
The snake ripple around Draco’s finger, and moves his head in Harry’s direction. Draco inhales sharply.
“You made me disappear,” Potter says and Draco forgets how to be collected and unflinching.
“Where’s Astoria?” he asks to change the subject. He’s afraid they were about to reminisce about the war.
Malfoy gives a weak laugh, an exhalation that betrays his exhaustion. He looks back at Harry, eyes hollow.
Harry feels dizzy with wine, food and proximity. He watches Malfoy and tries not to let himself be swayed by his gravity, pulled in like an asteroid. Malfoy looks back at him evenly, eyes a darker grey than usual, pupils fat and expressive.
“Alright”, Harry says when he is staring at the bottom of his own cup. “Remember Parvati Patil?”
Sleep waits a bit, but not much.
“Why did you overlook them, then?”
Presently, that means waking up after the full moon to an unfamiliar ceiling, on a carpet that is too comfortable to belong to Harry, next to what looks like a bed. Harry goes to touch it; the sheet feels very soft under his fingers, a thread count that’s much too high for him.
“Muggle London,” he finally answers, when he feels he’s going to implode with all that he’s keeping from her. She seems to get pointier by the word. He cannot tell her about Harry, but he should at least reassure her. “It’s alright, I’ve found people to… Help me.”
“Unless someone made it impossible,” Malfoy repeats.
“Yes,” Malfoy says, lips thinning. “They’re usually enjoyed in an erotic setting.”
By the time tea is ready, Scorpius is back and Albus collapses against his shoulder, not crying but pressing here for comfort. Draco leaves them to it and goes away discreetly.
“Are you decent this time?”
“Potter?” he asks, surprised and he hastily puts his quill down to stand up.
She shares delicate china cups and scones, almost doesn’t falter when she holds out Harry’s, before settling down on a couch. Her husband stays standing, looking at them with his back to the window.
Harry looks properly bored for a waiter and buses tables with neat, practiced movements; whenever he gets close to Draco’s table, he looks him over with a heated weight to his face that makes Draco squirm in his seat.
Here’s my report for Greengrass. The contraband is still down at the lab, so you can ask there if you need it.
He watches it wash everything in fire-bright orange through the windows of his library and takes a sip of his cup of tea, enjoying the first warm day of spring, closing his eyes on it. His fingers follow the edges of the book in his lap, and he preemptively savours the time he will spend reading it. His evening is shaping up to be quite pleasant.
“I wouldn’t lie to you on that, Potter.”
“Here, you look exactly like your grandfather. Hide your horrendous mane under that.”
Draco rubs his eyes and bats away lock of hair tickling his forehead.
Draco tightens his hold on his hand.
Scorpius is not yet here, still lost somewhere on the grounds for a walk and so Draco is alone to deal with a newly orphaned boy. Draco has experience with one’s recent loss of a parent; he went through it twice after all. The difference being that Draco expected his parent’s death. They were old and made older by the war, rendered sick by the haughtiness British society had turned on them.
Draco seems to think about it. He shrugs.
Heat spills high on Draco cheekbones, he looks out of the window and rubs his nose.
“Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.”
Thank you.
Dear Mx Potter,
Pansy shrugs, looks at the grass waving around them, a sea of green that sways with them.
June 16, 1998
“Oh, she’s doing something very scandalous.” His smile blooms into something bigger and it’s torture for Harry to witness it, and to continue witnessing it when he doesn’t turn away. “She’s on a date with a Muggle man.”
“Don’t leave, though.” And he goes. And Draco stays.
When Scorpius only looks more puzzled, he sighs.
His wolf is suspiciously quiet.
Draco pushes away and through the halls, until he’s bursting outside and walking with great purpose to the gates, his robe clutched around himself in flimsy protection.
Harry looks to Draco and sees the heat there; it spills into him, and spreads like wildfire in his loins. Keeping his face neutral is a struggle.
As soon as he has said it, he regrets it. It sounds too bothered for the cool aloof persona Draco tries to shape himself in.
He rubs soothingly at his finger and Draco relaxes back, eyes wary. The small snake coiled there shivers under Harry’s touch. It gives Harry an idea.
Harry feels his heart lurch,an up-and-down that displeases his stomach. He doesn’t think; he tugs at Malfoy’s collar, brings him close enough to be heard, breathes on him with his alcohol-heavy exhale.
Draco himself very mildly complains when Harry sweeps him off his feet and throws him over a shoulder to destination unknown and just holds on tight for the apparition.
“I… I’m not sure why I came to you.”
Potter raises a placating hand; it absolutely incenses Draco.
They look at each other. After a moment, the waiter sighs long and hard.
The Manor greets them with warm candlelights and Draco makes his way back to the library, a great shadow pushing at the back of his knees and almost making him trip. He plops himself back in his chair with a book and Potter immediately sees the opportunity to worm his head into his lap.
“What time is it?” he asks around a yawn.
“No, use a spell, I can’t wait.”
Malfoy thinks very loudly next to him. It’s a while before he speaks again.
Harry laughs and Draco feels his spine loosen, almost become liquid with the relief that floods him.
Draco presses him in the mattress, laying on top of him.
Harry doesn’t have an answer; he has no idea why everyone is ganging up against him. He takes a drink of his wine and tucks into his spinach and cheese pie, lets the conversation sway to other matters. David looks a tad bit more comfortable now that he doesn’t have to talk and Harry lets Andromeda’s wine carafe fill his glass more than what’s advisable.
“Come on, let us be on our way,” he says to break the silence, and pulls Harry to his feet.
Harry feels his heart lift in his chest and steps outside. He closes the door behind him on Ron and Ginny, and the awkward conversation of the recently broken-hearted.
Draco looks down at his neatly pressed dark shirt and his silver-hemmed trousers; the two items that he chose for the occasion, deciding that they would look sufficiently muggle to make him blend in. He looks at the man helplessly.
Hermione looks pinched, her hair falling over her forehead in tight coils. Her glass is empty, so she pours more for herself.
“Daddy?”
Malfoy looks unimpressed, dusts his trousers like it’s gonna change their state.
Harry nods and snuggles closer, rubs the whole length of his body against Draco; he grits his teeth to keep his budding arousal from blooming into unstoppable desire. Harry, unfortunately, has such an effect on him.
Harry nods and ponders on it. Malfoy slowly sips at his tea next to him, looking at the room over the rim of his cup.
“You’ll get wrinkles if you glower like that,” says Malfoy, looking too cheerful for the discussion.
“Anyway, I don’t have many suspects, or rather… I have too many suspects,” he admits wryly.
“Yes,” he says and doesn’t prompt more information.
“Ouch!”
“Sure.”
“No,” Draco says to the solid human in front of him, too shocked to string a sentence.
Draco takes a breath and holds it in for a long moment. He lets it wheeze out of his mouth slowly, calming in its softness.
Harry tries to look unconcerned as he takes his seat, smooths his trousers over his thighs, and steels himself to meet Malfoy’s gaze.
No, not muggle. Bloke, he corrects himself mentally. That would properly horrify his father.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Harry, I’ve seen your cock up close and personal, you can handle calling me by my name.”
“Come on, let’s eat something.”
