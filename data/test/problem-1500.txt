It was swiftly going pear-shaped, until Narcissa quietly turned Teddy’s fork into a knight. It speared the broccoli and waved it around like a battle trophy.
“You thought I was still going to give you half price after that lovely heart to heart? I don’t think so.”
That stopped all movement completely. Draco’s face fell into a scowl, his body curling inwards, his stance moving from sexual being to standoffish rival in rapid speed. “I’m leaving.” He then walked towards the front, stomping on Harry’s wood floors, and grabbed the pile of clothing that he had left near the door.
My socks are mending. I can feel the material underneath my toes re-stitch itself. My back aches less, though not by much, but my headache remains.
Harry knocked on the door and Neville stepped out, only to be consumed in a Cindy whirlwind. To be honest, Harry thought Cindy might have been into her own gender, but her tongue in Neville's throat was ripping that theory to shreds. Harry could feel the morning foods coming back up to say hello and stepped away from the door.
Harry agreed with her. For all her strange antics, Luna was more logical than anyone else he knew – even Hermione, although he was sure never to tell her that.
Richard straightened his moustache. “Badge? No, nothing like that. But, we’ve got a real suspect,” he responded sarcastically. “The mother says she thinks her previous neighbour’s a witch and she spelled the house like this. The woman’s as paranoid as anything, but it’s a start.”
Draco sighed, rolling his eyes and shoving his cock hard against Harry's trouser-imprisoned hardness. “I told you to shut it. I said nothing about me.” Draco pulled back, taking a long look at Harry's half dressed self, and then began to pull. “Why are you not naked? By the time I get in here you are always naked.”
Snape threw Harry onto the sofa while he remained standing, his eyes drilling into Harry’s face. Harry was still rubbish at Occluding his mind, so his only defense was to avoid eye contact.
As the years ran by, the word became softer, said with a flippant air and a flick of the hair until both of us fell into giggles. It was such a funny word, and hard to say, notorious. It sounded like a foreign language, or perhaps something a fine lady would say while drinking tea in tiny china cups. I didn't learn the word’s definition until I was much older, and by then my father had stopped saying it altogether.
“Can you believe that when they started to build the tree house Harry tried to convince me that he was building a love shack in which to practice being gay.”
With a cluck of her tongue, the woman threw the mail back onto the table. “Fat lot of help you are.”
Taking a last look down the hallway, I creep into the room and poke at Mr Potter’s luggage. It opens, and I take that as a sign from above to continue. I poke some more, swishing around the balled up socks and wrinkled T-shirts. My father would have a snit if I packed a suitcase like this guy did. I should tell him about the dirty mess, if my father could miraculously overlook the fact I was snooping.
Fifteen minutes into his shower, Draco always invaded it, stealing Harry's soap straight from his hands, and pushing him out of the water spray so Draco could use it entirely. Harry would let him, mostly because while Draco was distracted with washing, Harry would take the opportunity to fondle all his favourite Draco bits.
A door slams and then I hear heavy shuffling in the hallway. I throw the folder back into Mr Potter's suitcase and flee downstairs, slipping on the hardwood floor again and banging into Mr Potter. He tries to help me up, but I can't face him.
The bell! Harry fumbled around the bed as much as he could with a full-grown man on his stomach. Luckily, the bell and strap weren't far, and Harry grabbed it, ready to put it back on Draco's neck.
'I'm sorry, Dean!' Harry whispered frantically. 'I had no idea Shiraq would be like that. He told me he wanted freedom for his people. Venazu was a crazed man. We had to remove him from power, but I had no idea Shiraq would… would…'
Harry reached into his pocket and brought out a tiny sack that held precisely 101 Galleons. He had included the extra Galleon just in case there were any extra fees. He would have taken it out, but he really was ready for Malfoy to leave, and what was one Galleon for peace of mind.
“Several, balconies everywhere. Every room should lead to a balcony, with lots of nooks and crannies for hide and seek.”
The goblin sized Harry up and then gave a stern look to Draco. 'I'm not fond of magical folks. They have a penchant for stealing.'
Draco pulled Harry a bit roughly, their mouths smashing together in an intense kiss that took Harry's breath away.
He loved Teddy, but didn’t like how much he had hated Malfoy on sight. Harry hated him because he was a prat, and had been a prat for years, but Malfoy had done nothing to Teddy, except ignore him. Malfoy had even tried to give him his own dessert and was met with a fierce rejection.
Fawkes flew directly to Draco, landing on his chest. He raised his neck and sang out a call of anguish before bending over and dripping a single tear onto Draco's body.
After only a few minutes, they reached the room filled with birds, who were all screeching louder than they had been before. Finally, Padma had the good sense to look back at Harry for instructions.
Harry had never known Luna to have interests beyond the opposite sex, but she looked happy, and seemed to thrive under the quite possessive nature of Padma.
Harry could see Draco’s cock straining against the knickers above him. He reached up to touch his prize, but Draco batted his hand away.
Harry followed the man down into the basement stepping over torn laundry baskets and mangled plastic remains of detergent bottles
The door opened. Harry looked up, surprised, and yet unsurprised at Draco’s arrival. He always met Draco on the Hogwarts Express.
Next, Finn, who usually was doing anything but work, would salute Harry and go back to whatever scheme he had cooked up that day.
As he stepped off his motorbike, a group of detectives doing little more than henpecking around their cigs began to snicker.
. Upon landing, he took up the helm and gave out the location, keeping an eye out for the small ship on the horizon. The ship was probably nothing, but Draco's agitation was infectious. The more Harry wondered about it, the more he began to worry. But, at this point, all he could do was keep his eye on it.
One small child yelled to him. “Mister Potter, are you getting a new wand? What kind? Can I get the same thing? Mum, can you get me the same wand?”
‘That ship that is following us has gotten closer. He’s following us down the river. We need to find the Magical Cauldron
Harry looked up to see Malfoy right in front of his face, scowling. Well that was as effective as a slap to the face.
Harry clawed at Draco’s back, knowing his fingernails were leaving marks. He bit Draco’s shoulder and ear lobes. Draco just bit back, yanking on Harry’s nipples and tearing skin.
He searched every angle, every nook and cranny, trying to find anything that was remotely human. But there was nothing.
"Smells good. When do we eat?" he says, as if he's not here to arrest my father. I narrow my eyes. My father catches me and frowns.
“Please, Harry, if you would like to prepare me manually, there is lube in the nightstand. Otherwise, I know a spell to both loosen me and lubricate me. Do you think you can hold out or would you like to do it right now?”
Bran and his army stormed Matholwch's land. A great battle ensued, but Matholwch's army was not to be defeated, for every time a warrior was killed, he would return in full health the next day, but without the power of speech.
It's true. I love my father. I wouldn't be where I am, or who I am, without him. I try to yell it out, but the magic around me is too strong.
Neville stayed like that for a while. Not really wanting his friend to suffer, but unsure as to words of advice when he had no idea what was going on.
'I wondered myself if that was what we were looking for,' Sir Culhwich interjected, taking his time walking up the steps.
“I, Harry James Potter, vow to never separate from Draco Malfoy. Where he goes, I go, even in death.”
Andromeda had followed them to the kitchen table and glared at Harry. She had the misfortune to look like Bellatrix, but with softer brown hair, and the resemblance was never as clear as it was when Andromeda was angry. It was a cool anger, calm, but you knew there was a storm brewing underneath. He didn’t know what to say! How did he explain Draco’s presence without giving away the whole thing! He wanted, no needed, the tree house to be a secret. He just had to somehow convince Andromeda that it was totally normal for Draco Malfoy, her estranged nephew, to be at their house every day, sharing meals and building something in the back garden.
Harry shifted on his broom looking to the crew for something to say in reply. Ever the eloquent speaker, Draco swept in beside Harry and began to work his magic. Harry’s only worry was the likely possibility that Draco had no idea what a submarine was.
Neville and Harry stared at the newsletter, the rest of the hall forgotten about. He had seen the "No Death Eater" signs on some shops, but Harry had no idea that it included Slytherins in general.
He's wearing a black robe, loose and long. It's been years since I've seen something like that, and never in this house, my father trading his own fashionable robes for more casual wool cardigans and twill trousers. Mr Potter's robe has no shape other than billowy and over Mr Potter's wide shoulders it looks like a cape, the kind that comic super villains wear.
Harry hadn't realized his mistake until it was too late. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's shoulders and pulled him in tight in a mock embrace that was more painful then tender. 'Don't worry, I won't tell anyone your big dark secret, Harry, as long as you tell me how big that big dark secret was, if you know what I mean.'
Teddy had already opened all his other presents and astutely gathered that he hadn’t opened one from Harry. He ran straight to Harry, who had been sitting on the side with Draco, attempting to make him feel more comfortable around all the screaming people. Arthur had gotten really excited by the presents.
Harry chuckled. He would have never had imagined anyone speaking of the giant squid in such a caring familial way, apart from Hagrid.
They sat together in silence for a little while longer, still absorbing the calm that had never been between the two of them before. Harry had begun to watch a small ladybug walk across a blade of grass when he remembered that Teddy would be coming downstairs any minute for his breakfast and he would have to face Andromeda again and he still had no idea how to salvage that awful lie he told.
Draco adjusted his scarf, which could have been considered a nervous motion, except Malfoy had managed to place the scarf more artfully than before. “I’m fine.”
I drop the holly and mistletoe near the door and clamber up the steps once more, laughing at my father, who unknowingly sports spiderwebs in his hair.
The hard voice of Draco’s sent shivers down his spine and rocketed him into action. He threw off his shirt and unzipped his trousers, throwing everything into a corner until he sat down naked on the bed. He looked up to see that his leggy beauty had come closer.
“Andromeda, I believe you know Draco Malfoy. Um, he’s going to be visiting us, a lot, for the next few weeks or so.”
Harry lit a cigarette, enjoying the cool burn of the nicotine. Katie called them death sticks, but Harry called them heaven. He pulled in a long drag and blew it out nice and slow.
“I will owl you in a day or two with the preliminary plans. The plans will include an estimated time of completion. Once approved I can begin construction. That will mean I will need complete access to the back yard for at least 8 or 9 hours a day, plus access to your house-elf for my meals and drinks.”
My face must have shown my agony because my father lets go of Mr Potter's hand immediately and reaches out for mine, but before he can touch me, I'm off, running towards the stairs to hide in my room.
There’s laughter and then a sigh. “Have you ever smelled a teenager's shoes after they've spent a day in them without socks?”
There was a blast and the window above them shattered, the birds fleeing through the opening. A protection shield suddenly appeared above Harry, saving him from the falling shards. He looked behind him to see Draco creating the spell to cover both of them. He then looked to the rest of his crew to see that Sir Culhwich was holding a shield above the injured Padma who was suspiciously holding her bow toward the window, and Dean and Finn holding shields of their own.
Mr. Potter's arm is around my father and my dad is leaning into him. I take a long look at the pair of them and make a decision.
,” Draco yelled, but Pansy flicked her stick and suddenly Draco was flying backwards toward the house, landing with a thud in the front garden. Distracted, Harry failed to see Pansy had turned her attention to him. Something hit him hard on his arm. He looked down and a giant slash ran across his bicep.
Lunch had been a bit weird, with just the two of them. Draco had brought his super secret plans with him and was reviewing them at the table and Harry had used the time to respond to a letter he received from Luna.
Draco began to laugh, the adrenaline of the stressful situation clearly getting to him. 'The plan is brute force, Potter. Get with the times.'
“It’s an invitation, for this Friday. Teddy, Andromeda and I would like to invite you and your mother over for dinner.”
Dean came forward, enraged by Finn's statement, and grabbed Finn by the collar, shaking the boy's small frame. 'Do you even know who you are speaking to?'
My body is frozen and then carried down the stairs. I can feel what's going on around me, but I can't move my head to look around. I feel the magic, circling my body in waves. While Squibs can't do magic, we aren't considered Muggles because we can still feel magic. We know, instinctively, that it exists and yet we can't perform it ourselves. We contain a magical core, it's just completely empty, like a wooden bowl without the decorative plastic fruit. Seems rather pointless.
“I don’t want to come that way. I brought lube, and I also know some spells. I thought maybe you would like to fuck me.”
Mr Potter continues to just stand there, beside the bed, twirling his wand. Robes, wands, all these magical objects are making me nervous.
The two continued to move together and Harry could not get over how nice the skirt felt against his cock. Harry reached down and wrapped a silky layer around his cock and gave his prick a few strokes before he was coming all over the beautiful new costume.
Though Snape was still standoffish and cutting, he was growing on Harry. He had seen the man's memories, of his love for his mother and his unending devotion to Dumbledore. If anyone would understand what Harry was going through, it was this man. Although they never spoke about it, mostly they just continued with their lives, burying themselves in their routines.
Draco scrounged out the map from his pocket. A small squid-like creature appeared on the north side of the island.
The crowds murmuring was turning into a frenzy of requests and calls for wands just like Harry’s, Ollivander stood, ignoring his patrons calls to instead stare at Harry, his large eyes magnified underneath his large bottle glasses.
"Nothing. It's just an obvious vehicle for The Green Rebellion. If they're printing them in your classroom then you know who's in The Green Rebellion, who's running it."
"The Ministry now is working so hard to distance itself from the mistakes it made during the war that they aren't seeing how each law they pass makes it closer than before. The fact that shops can ban anyone based on their familial ties to a convicted criminal is wrong, and the rule itself was made by one person. Everyone else just went along with it."
into a cloud. He had never seen this happen before, but he was sure that it was the ship's own magic that caused the transformation. Was it a Glamour? An illusion? Harry wasn't sure.
Draco then led Harry into what he presumed to be his bedroom. There was a massive four-poster bed in the middle of the room. The posters looked like miniature trees with branches that extended over the bed like a canopy. There was an opening in the center which Harry could see held a large sunroof. Along one of the walls was a map of all the constellations in the sky and a large book on the nightstand on stargazing. There were candles floating everywhere, giving a faint glow on the ivory sheets.
Harry leaned over and slowly kissed Draco's sweet lips. Oh, how he had missed those lips. There were nights when Harry yearned for something so hard it almost took his breath away and kissing Draco made Harry realize that this was what he had missed so badly.
"What?" I reply, thrown by Mr. Potter's sudden question. "Oh, um, down the hall. Third door from the left."
Neville and Cindy were already making out, ignorant of Harry's angry cloud forming above his head. Harry stormed out, slamming the door with the first moan from within.
Harry kissed the last ribbon and wrapped it around Draco's trunk. He turned and walked back to the cottage, eager for a warm cup of tea.
“Yes! I am an adult! I am the man of this household and demand to know why we swear that family is above all else, and yet we throw away family at the drop of a hat! I don’t understand!”
Harry pulled on Nott's hair. 'This is Sir Culhwich. He was using a Glamour. Isn't that right? Tell us, how did Lestrange know about the Magical Cauldron? Did Draco send you?'
“I can’t. I just wanted to give a birthday gift for Teddy all on my own. Every year I buy the absolute worst gifts for Teddy and every year Andromeda saves me by letting me use one of hers. I’m a horrible godfather and this tree house was my chance to prove to both Teddy and Andromeda that I can be a good godfather. That I can do birthday presents all on my own. And if go back in there and tell her what I am actually doing, that spoils the whole thing.”
“I apologize to everyone, but I have a private meeting with Mister Potter. I am closing the shop now. I hope to see you all tomorrow.”
Snape was growing desperate. He was never at the cottage, always off in remote locations trying to find anything to help, or at least slow the process down. But nothing worked, and nothing was keeping the magic from consuming Draco.
“But it’s more than a spot! It’s tree bark! There has to be something really wrong for you to be growing bark down your back. Have you seen anyone? Talked to anyone about it?”
Harry looked across the hallway at Malfoy who had curled himself tightly against the wall. The git was annoying, mean, spiteful, hateful, but a constant in Harry's life. It was hard to imagine him not in it.
My father was always the type of man that would love his son. That's the Malfoy way. Sons are precious heirs, bred to be pillars of the pureblood community. They are a father’s pride, a tiny child to mold into greatness. They are reflections of their father, their father’s father, and all the generations of Malfoy men that had come before. They are tools as much as they are objects to be paraded, a feather in a father’s cap, so to speak.
"And why not? Because I'm not brave like you, or daring? You don't think I was brave when I begged McGonagall to give me a job, or daring when I kissed you in a middle of a fight?"
Draco managed to pull Harry's trousers completely off and threw them to the other side of the room, landing on the lamp in the room and knocking it down. It didn't break, the light was still on, but it was partially covered and on the floor, leaving a strange yellow glow around the room. Draco cursed. “Can nothing go right tonight?”
“I’ll be here bright and early tomorrow, Harry. There’d better be breakfast, and it had better be good.”
The cuddling is nice, for a while, until my father pushes me away and hits me upside the head, my brain knocking into my skull.
I'm a war baby, a child born a year after the death of Voldemort. There are a lot of us, for various reasons. We were acts of celebration, proofs of triumph, and last gasps of desperation from those who had nothing else. You can imagine which category I fit in.
"Fred must have noticed my confused face because he asked me if I had ever done anything like what he was doing. I said no. My face must have been beet red, but I couldn’t move. I felt like I was petrified. So, Fred told me exactly what he was doing and then told me to get on another bed and do the same.”
Draco stood at the end of the bed and smirked. He turned around and shimmied a bit before bending entirely over. Harry’s breath caught seeing the glorious arse that he loved so much on display in such a wanton way. Harry wanted to reach out and give it a nice good smack, but he held still, waiting to see what Draco had planned.
“I don’t doubt it. Then the Dark Lord showed up and I really didn’t have time to deal with the fact that every other boy was getting together with girls and I just wasn’t.”
Draco then fell on top of Harry, completely drained. Within moments his breathing became slower and his body heavier.
Harry smile was so wide it almost broke his face. He reached down and pulled Draco to his lips. They kissed until the drowsiness became too much and then they fell asleep, continuing to press into each other without space between.
Harry groaned on the inside. Draco was going to give him up before the action started. But then he wrote on a piece of parchment and shoved it towards Harry.
“But the point is my father doesn't do any magic. So you can leave now. You've done your duty, checked up on us, and we're fine. I'm sure you have spies all over the neighborhood and I'm sure they'd tell you the same thing. Leave my father and me alone. We don't want you here, you ill-mannered Neanderthal!”
Bleary-eyed from the lack of sleep, Harry sipped on his black coffee, his lips grazing against a chip in the side of the mug.
Mr Potter laughs and my father smiles, a bit shyly, his cheeks turning red. How could he smile like that when this man is about to take everything away from him?
There was something that nagged at the back of Harry’s brain. Ollivander had mentioned that the magic was calling out to him. Harry felt himself out, truly assessing his own feelings. There were no faint noises, no soft whispers urging him to find a tree or carve wood. Perhaps Ollivander was mistaken?
Harry was too busy wiping the snot that had begun to run down his nose to catch what Draco had said.
In our cottage there are three bedrooms upstairs, the largest room for my father and his big dressers that smell like cedar, the second-biggest for me, which I decorated myself with posters of all the best cyclists, including Lance Armstrong, and a guest room that is used mostly for storage.
Harry nodded and placed a small chaste kiss on Draco’s lips, just feeling how silky they were, before pulling away.
“So, no magic here, none whatsoever. No sticking charms, no fairy lights, not even a house-elf to do the cooking. Just me and my dad, living like Muggles with absolutely no magic anywhere in sight. None for miles even! It’s just tape and twine and paper cut out with scissors. The Muggles don’t even realize we're celebrating a magical holiday, they just think we’re daft!”
stories funny. Who wouldn't? But the gossip surrounding the Malfoy family was just as loony and preposterous as the stories told about him. Unfortunately, Ron believed all of them to be true, no matter how far-fetched or unreliable the source. Just last week, Ron was sure Narcissa was carrying Voldemort's love-child, and a few months ago had claimed Draco had chosen to marry a house-elf in defiance of his arranged marriage.
The sound suddenly stopped once they entered the mouth of the cave. There was little light, and no real place to land.
"I went to the Ministry of Magic a few months ago to meet with my probation officer to sign all the necessary paperwork. We’ve been spending a bit of time together on my case and…" My father stops and looks away before starting again. "We've known each other for a while, he's been my probation officer since we moved here, and he's heard me prattling on about our Twelfth Night celebrations year after year…"
He leaned into Draco's side and pouted. He brought his lip out and dropped his eyes, batting his eyelashes.
“Draco, I would like to repeat this over and over again for as long as possible. And I don’t mean just the sex. I mean the hand holding, and the stargazing, the letters and the meals. I want you to come over and help me build Teddy the biggest castle made out of building blocks. I want to go shopping together and buy furniture for this house. I want to learn what it feels like to run my tongue down the vein in your cock. Draco, I want everything. Is that okay?”
The two chests rubbed together and both Harry and Draco rubbed. Draco reached down and began to unzip Harry’s jeans. Harry reached down to help and together they lifted the jeans and the pants off. Harry was naked, but he really couldn’t think of anything other than
Chief Kingsley handed a sheet of paper over to Harry. “Here’s a list of all the items missing from the home.”
“Draco is not a snake. And while I agree that I would rather spend my days with you I have to spend my day outside. But I want to tell you something, something very important. Draco is family. He’s your cousin. Did you know that?”
Harry released a breath, knowing that was probably going to be Luna's answer, but disappointed nonetheless.
'You saved me, Harry,' Dean said. He lifted his eye-patch, showing the gaping hole that was left. 'Shiraq did this to me, and would have done the other eye, had you not stormed his stronghold and rescued me. You could have died, but you didn't care. You just cared about making sure I was safe. No matter what Harry, I would follow you anywhere. No matter what.'
Draco brought his other elbow up, digging both of them into Harry's chest as he rested his chin on his hands. “Only because you were staring at that bell like it was a 24 karat diamond.”
Harry, not sure what was going on or if he would even be able to fight without a weapon, threw his entire body forward, tackling Pansy with everything he had. He caught her unawares. She went down easier than Harry thought she would.
Draco approached Harry, waving his hand in dismissal to the others. 'This fighting will get us nowhere. All of you, wait outside. I want to speak to Potter alone.'
,” but Harry sent a Freezing charm to his arm, distracting him enough to send the curse off balance, missing Padma completely.
I slump down, peering at them from underneath my shaggy blond hair. They fit together, in a weird way. They seem to be opposites; blond hair and black, thin and wide, tall and short, and yet together it matches, like a black stripe down a yellow racing bike.
Harry shivered, realizing that he now stood in front of the tree that had created the Elder Wand. It looked small and unimpressive. How had this wood been turned into the greatest wand that ever existed?
You see, the Muggles have it all wrong, for Twelfth Night has nothing to do with exaggerated punishments for lazy Muggle decorators, and rather is a celebration of the ending of the twelve day Grindylow Infestation of 1212. There is caroling and children playing with their new brooms outside their homes, and plenty of scrumptious desserts and cookies suspiciously shaped like green underwater creatures.
"So now we know the place and the time. I say it's time for Harry to do his charge in first ask questions later routine that has served his so well in the past. Meanwhile, Neville and I will stay right here and reward ourselves for being great helpers."
"What?" I reply, thrown by Mr Potter's sudden question. "Oh, um, down the hall. Third door from the left."
The weather was very cold. Tiny flakes of snow had begun to swirl in the air. But Harry paid it no mind. He just dragged Snape to the tree and then began to shout. Began to demand for Snape to attempt to reach Draco, use his Legilimency to find his mind inside. To tell Draco to come back, to stay.
Digging into his jacket, Harry lifted the letter. It was plain, written with black ink. A bit old fashioned for this day and age. He carefully broke the elaborate seal, showcasing a lion and snake wrapped around each other, and scanned the letter.
Harry was growing more frustrated by the minute. He didn’t understand what was going on around him nor what Katie was saying. Had he sleep-walked here? It was at least a five-hour walk from his home. But wasn’t he just back at his place sleeping in his leather chair? This didn’t make any sense.
The two sat in silence for a while. Harry tried to look out the window again, but the trees had stopped being interesting. Draco, with his blue pin stripe suit and white blond hair was much more interesting.
Draco's loud voice in Harry's ear made him jump. Draco was pressed practically on top of Harry, looking through his glasses to see the object. Harry's entire body instantly could feel every inch of Draco on his back.
Harry chuckled and ran inside to make the Floo call. Star’s Palace delivered within fifteen minutes via Floo and had the best naan.
That’s me, Hayden Malfoy, currently thirteen years old and definitely not looking forward to the work my father has planned for us.
Harry rounded up the rest of crew, including a confused Luna and an overly protective Padma. They ran out of the castle and out into the rain, mounting their brooms as soon as they reached the dirt and flying towards the
If found that one Draco Lucius Malfoy, hereby referred to as the suspect, is using Magic in front of non-magical folk, hereby referred to as Muggles, and as such breaking the International Confederation of Wizards' Statute of Secrecy, Harry Potter, Head Auror of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, with full rights hereby given by the Wizengamot court, may arrest said suspect, Draco Lucius Malfoy forthwith for being in breach of his probation at this time, keeping in full standing of the law of this land.
Draco came long and hard. Harry bent down and kissed Draco until the two fell boneless to the bed, Harry finally slipping out of Draco. He fell to the side and wrapped Draco around his chest.
Finally Draco sat upright. He dragged a shaking hand through his hair and then let his hand fall into his lap with a thump.
” had him diving for cover. Nott pressed his advantage on Harry and charged, firing curses. Harry scrambled on the ground trying to stay low and spitting out Shield Charms to protect himself and Padma.
But luck was not on their side. Standing below a large window was the King, a cage in his right hand that contained Luna, still in her goldfinch form, and a wand in his other hand pointed at Luna's head.
Harry was met with silence. He was an idiot, but at least he tried. He was constantly telling Teddy that trying was always more important than actually succeeding.
Harry smiled again and then walked towards his dorm, leaving Malfoy behind. It had been a strange night, a strange day - a strange year, really. But it was time to sleep, and hopefully not to dream.
‘There was once a wise druid I knew many years ago. He told me of the Magical Cauldron and where he had placed it.’ Harry held his breath. His heart began to beat loudly in his chest.
Faced with imminent death, Harry was quite surprised at how Draco was spending his last days. Harry would have suspected the man would have complained to anyone who would listen about the unfairness of it all. And yet, there was Draco, stoically accepting his destiny without complaint, continuing his days as if he had not a care in the world.
Downstairs is a large kitchen with a windowbox full of herbs over the sink and a variety of cereals in plastic containers on the counter. I’m a Frosties man, but my father likes the Cornflakes, and on Sundays we both like the ones with raisins, so it’s imperative that all three are available for easy access.
The leader of the Green Rebellion, the person that had the attention of the entire student body, was none other than Teddy Lupin, his godson.
“As you wish, your majesty,” he replies, lifting his wand, gripping the end in his fist, and places the tip against my father's wrists.
I run down the stairs, shaking the pictures on wall and the seashell lined ribbon wrapped around the banister. My heart is beating out of my chest and I'm having trouble breathing. I stop when I reach the kitchen and take a moment to catch my breath. My father takes one look at me and shakes his head.
“How can Teddy not have fun? If my dad had been around I bet he’d do something similar, and if Remus were around Teddy would probably already know all the constellations. He could probably tell me a thing or two. I just don’t want Teddy to miss out.”
Lestrange began to laugh manically. 'You're going to fight me, Potter? You're nothing but a small-time Ministry hack.'
The King lifted his hand to his temple. ‘Well, there is someone older here, but he doesn’t live on the island. Just outside it, in fact. He’s the oldest and wisest creature here. If anyone would know where the Magical Cauldron lived, it would be the Cock-Eyed Squid. He lives in a cave on the North Shore.’
Mrs Granger held on tighter. “Stop it, Harry. You know me. You went to school with my daughter. We had you over for Christmas a few years ago. You and your nice young man.”
Instead all he heard was silence. Perhaps he had done the Silencing Charm a little too well and it had silenced Malfoy as well.
Harry tripped over himself on his way out of the cottage. As he left he saw a shadow appear behind the cottage, in the garden. It looked like someone was lying in the grass, but at this hour? Harry shook his head. The lack of sleep was obviously affecting him more than he thought.
Luna stepped forward, placing a hand on Harry's arm as Sir Culhwich continued, 'Efnisien entered the black cauldron alive, knowing nothing else but the want to end this horrible magical spell. With all his might, he tore open the black cauldron from the inside, but the act of it was too much for his heart, and he died. But the black cauldron's spell no longer worked.'
The door cracked open and in walked Draco Malfoy, in all his t-shirt goodness. Harry was so wrapped up in remembering that body naked that he didn't see the man coming his way, nor pay attention when he sat right next to him.
“There was one design I drew, that last year while Voldemort was in our house. I wanted to make a true escape, some place that was so unlike the up tight pureblood homes and castle like structures that most of my other drawings reflected. No, this tree house looked like it belonged in the trees. That the trees had grown in such a way that their branches had just made a tree house by chance. When you were describing what you want for your tree house, and when I saw the old gnarled branches of these trees, that design came to mind. I have to build that tree house now, even if it is for you.”
“Harry, I was there when that rude relative of Teddy’s insulted him. I heard what you said to him. You consoled him told him you loved him, and promised him nothing would split you apart. He was clinging to you. He needed you. And you comforted him. If that wasn’t a fatherly act, I don’t know what is. You are a good father, and I think you should fulfill your promise to Teddy by signing these papers.”
The pair hit the ground hard. Harry had turned his body so his arms could wrap securely around Pansy, but in the process his head landed sharply into the ground. The impact was sudden. Harry felt as if his brain was jumping from one side of his head to the other.  For a few seconds the world around him stood still. The leaves stopped moving in the breeze, the birds stopped chirping. There was a whooshing sound, a sharp pain behind his eyes, and then everything went black.
I hand him the bowl but keep the orange juice. "So what’s the name of your probation officer? What’s this guy like? Is he fat and bloated with a large mustache? Thin and sallow with sunken-in cheeks and ratty teeth?"
This year, Harry was determined to buy the best gift for Teddy, on his own. He had started early and was going to scour each shop in Diagon Alley until he found the perfect gift. If Harry could defeat a six-foot lizard man set on his destruction he could purchase a birthday gift for his soon to be five–year-old godson.
Later, Bran, unaware of Matholwch's true nature, decided to marry his sister, Branwen, off to him as he was a leader of a warring country, thus creating peace between the two kingdoms. But Bran's cousin Efnisien did not approve of the marriage. In protest, Efnisien cut off the tails, ears, eyebrows, and lips of all of Matholwch's horses.
He sharply nodded his head and suddenly both he and Finn pushed back against their captors. Harry shoved his elbow hard into Nott, making him bend over. He then sent a sharp Stinging Spell toward Lestrange to help Finn get away. Once free, Harry pushed Finn behind him.
Harry answered Dean, 'No! There's something down here with us in the hole.' He turned to Draco. 'We are getting out of here now.'
“Look, I’m sorry if I didn’t come thank you during the party for the tree house. It really is amazing. I just had a lot to do in the kitchen.”
But once Ollivander confirmed what my family had feared for years when I failed to manifest any signs of magic, my father became the type of man who loves his Squib son.
Draco laughed, “No, just I want to finish this by myself. This way the tree house can be surprise to both you and Teddy. Trust me, this is the easiest part. The spells are already on the wood. Now, it's just telling them all where to go. Go inside. Make me the best dinner you’ve ever made. I deserve a reward for putting up with you.”
Randolph waddled towards the Slytherin table. McGonagall has asked the students to move the tables to how they normally were and students were sitting with their houses, even if none wore the robes.
The dining room is small, but it’s right off the kitchen so I don’t have to go far when setting the table. The china cabinet is completely off limits and filled with dishes and knick-knacks mailed to us by my grandmother. We haven’t seen her since we moved here, but my father says this is her way of reaching out.
Harry took a big breath. He looked over at Draco who was clearly shaken. This was for him. This was going to be extremely selfish, but it was time for him to do something selfish. This was love, he was in love. Harry deserved a little selfishness.
“And you have nothing to say? Haven’t you always told me that your sister and her children were not to be welcomed by this family? And yet here I am working for them, spending time with Teddy.”
"Not for a few minutes. I was just suggesting to my son that perhaps he should wash off all that teenage smell."
Harry should have known better. No task sent by Lucius would ever be altruistic. This was one way to redeem the Malfoy name, in the eyes of Voldemort at least. And, considering their pureblood supremacy beliefs, they probably believed bringing back the mad man was in the best interest of the wizarding world.
Harry's eyebrow's creased. “You know the Chief? Are you a police officer? Is that why I know you?” Harry hit his head with hand. “Or at least, think I know you? Did we work together before the accident?”
"Well, there was Patricia Goyle who last week decided that she should be able to go into The Cauldron Shop in Diagon Alley, even though they have a "No Death Eater" policy. She was never convicted of a crime, but her husband was. She went in and used a permanent sticking charm on all the cauldrons out of protest. I think she definitely did what Thoreau was talking about."
Harry’s eyes travelled the length of Draco’s body. First, he took in Draco’s face, which was surprisingly made up with make up, but the effect was subtle. He had added rouge to his cheeks, a slight shimmer to his lips, and his eyelashes were more pronounced. His hair was loose with a small blue headband pulling the strands back. His chest was covered with a light blue corset with a white ribbon down the front, tying him in. The corset was low cut, emphasizing Draco’s beautifully long neck and his lickable collarbone which Draco had accented with a simple silver chain with a drop pearl pendant. Then, there was the skirt, the beautifully short, ruffled blue skirt with a cute little white apron. The skirt had at least seven or eight layers, but it was short. So short, that when Draco twirled, Harry could see the frilly matching blue knickers underneath. Harry's eyes continued down, enjoying Draco’s impossibly long legs covered in beautifully silky white stockings that came up to his thighs. The tops of the tights were covered with a large block of lace that Harry itched to touch and a little cute bow with a blue heart button in the center.
Harry shoved Draco and stormed off the deck, down the steps, and into his cabin, slamming the doors behind him. He was so angry with himself for letting Draco get to him so easily! Had he learned nothing from his Hogwarts days? He'd faced countless ruthless men, stood up to murderers, rapists and thieves. And yet a blond prick wearing a tunic and Viking braids was able to make him look a fool on his own ship. Draco's silver tongue was like Veritaserum, his probing jabs mysteriously forcing Harry to admit things he held close to his chest with others.
Once removed, Draco returned, lying flat against Harry. For the first time in their exchange, Draco’s intense look changed. The edge of his lips began to rise. Harry’s lips on their own accord rose with them. Without thinking he reached out, kissing those tempting, smirking lips.
For right now there were more important things to think about, like the bread that had been sitting on the coffee table for how long, and a little boy that was probably starved from being at the park with his grandmother all day. He would just wait for Malfoy’s owl. This tree house, it truly was going to be something grand.
Harry dragged the soap over his torso. 'But you do know what the Magical Cauldron does, don't you. Can't you give me a hint as to its purpose?'
Just when Harry was growing desperate enough to Transfigure anything he could get his hands on into a self ringing bell, the wards of his flat shimmered, sending him an impression of the person seeking entrance. Draco was back and Harry was never so happy to see him. He lifted the wards quickly, hurriedly attempting to re-dress, throwing on a shirt and ready with his hands on his trouser buttons, when he heard the soft jingle of the tiny bell coming closer and closer to his bedroom. Suddenly, there was no need to re-button his trousers.
My father smiles at me, his eyes clear and soft. I'd been creeping up ever so slowly to his height, but today I realize we're finally at the same eye level. He lifts his eyebrow, I lift my eyebrow, he pulls his hair behind his right ear, I pull my hair behind my left. But then my father surprises me by sticking out his tongue so I use my finger to lift up my nose.
Luna wrapped a large lock of her hair around her finger. 'If the Unspeakables stole the body, the Aurors wouldn't be looking for it.'
As Harry entered Teddy’s room, he found Teddy sitting in Draco’s lap, his eyes falling shut while Draco read his favorite story, “The Dragon and Me”. At the end of the story, Harry helped Draco put Teddy to bed. It was strange to see Draco so tender. It pulled something in Harry.
Harry turned to his crew. 'All right, this is the plan. Draco and I will lead the group. Dean, you take up the rear and watch our backs. We are to stay alert at all times. We have no idea who or what is on this island. We have to stay vigilant and be smart. We will stick together as a group, got it? No wandering off.'
Draco was standing on the quarterdeck, petting the perched Fawkes and conversing with it hushed tones, the phoenix's golden tail swishing back and forth.
Which made Harry realize he wasn't in his king-sized bed. This bed was smaller and smelled strangely, not like his bed at home which smelled like grass and that vanilla shampoo Draco liked to use.
“How much time do you think you’ll spend in that thing? I hope you and Teddy don’t stay in the tree house during the whole party. I would rather not spend the four-hour party surrounded by Weasleys alone.”
“I walked in on Bill, Ron’s brother. I walked on him wanking when I was staying over at the Burrow. Girls could never make me feel the same way as I felt after I witnessed that.”
Blearily, Harry reached around the floor without getting out of bed, searching for his glasses. Once found, Harry blinked up at Draco who was in the process of getting up, his pale arse illuminated underneath the sunlight.
and it took me a while to get over it, but I did; couldn't pine for you forever. It was then that I met Sam who, sorry to say this, Harry, is light years better for me than you. You're my Captain, Harry, not my lover. So please, don't worry so much about me. Okay?'
I lift my eyebrow at my father's spoiled behavior, but Harry seems to enjoy it, sporting a smitten, indulgent smile.
Draco pushed him towards the door, using more strength than Harry assumed he had. “Wait! Draco! What are you going to do now?”
Harry pulled out a new fag, letting it dangle in his mouth while he rummaged through his pockets for his lighter.
Harry, feeling as if some of the puzzle pieces were still missing, knew enough to boldly step closer to Draco.
Sleep was eluding him again. It felt as if his heart still believed it needed to stay active, while his body was screaming for rest. His mind, like a clock, continued to tic, tic, tic through the details of the case, the
The tea had begun to get cold. As Harry reached out to pour more hot water into the cup there was movement outside the window. Harry looked out only to be met with an empty field.
Padma sneered, 'I am a trained tracker. I follow scientific clues, not fantasy conjecture. But I see you are still set on creating stories, rather than learning anything real.'
“I don’t know. I was embarrassed, I guess. I mean we’re not teenagers anymore. It’s a little silly to still be a virgin. In school I was a little busy having the Dark Lord in my house, and then afterwards, well no one really wanted to sleep with an ex-Death Eater except weirdoes or people with sick revenge fantasies. So I just stayed away from anything. I didn’t want to admit that with you.”
Mr. Potter smiles more broadly and takes out his wand in his giant hand. “You heard us, didn't you?”
Luna transformed beside Harry, her yellow feathers disappearing underneath her skin. 'Harry, I need to fly back to England. There is an urgent message for you. I'll be back in a few hours.'
I can feel my body falling back, but I'm willing myself to go forward with my mind. I pinwheel, and roll my eyes, hating every second this delays me from running into my room and slamming my door. I'm frustrated and tired and I need some time to myself.
Draco fell silent, his head turned to the side. He refused to say anything, just stood there staring into the corner. Harry waited, and waited, but Draco remained silent.
“So, will this continue past tomorrow, or was this just for the duration of the tree house building?”
"He speaks!" I say, thinking it a funny joke, but Mr Potter doesn't laugh. He just pulls down his jumper and stares at me until my giggles turn to nervous laughter.
"I think we're clean enough Harry. Come into my bedroom. I have an urge to be taken, as long as I get to take you later."
Seeing his lover take such charge, his cheeks flushed, his skirt hiked up his waist, drove Harry mad. Harry grabbed onto everything he could, pulling the ribbons on the corset, yanking on Draco’s hair, biting on Draco’s collarbone. Anything to get Draco to forget the foreplay and fuck him already!
There was a strange sensation, a grounding feeling. The earth felt like it was sinking. But Harry just held on, wrapping his arms tightly around Draco, holding his face in his hands.
Draco stared at Harry for a moment, biting his lip. Harry withstood the scrutiny, hoping his real worry showed through. Draco closed his eyes and then, as fast as he could, he ripped off his shirt and turned around, presenting to Harry his back.
“No, why is this the first time that I have spoken to Andromeda? Do you know she has the same nose as you, and it wrinkles at the smell of mushrooms, just like you? Did you know Teddy is almost five already? He loves to draw. If you went into my office you would see all the drawings he made for me. Remember when I used to draw and you would hang them in the great hall for a week, telling everyone that it was my grand debut into the art world? Why did you never write? Never have us stop by and say hello? Pay our respects when her husband and daughter died within a few months of each other!”
keeps them “safe”, basically sealing the twigs against future magic absorption. You basically did nothing. You sealed in the old magic, which cancelled out the second. We have wasted three days because you are too stupid to do things on your own.”
' and he could hear the others calling out spells, but it was too late. Suddenly, the crew, minus Luna, found themselves outside the castle, in the rain, a ward shimmering between them and the castle, keeping them out.
"I still think the Green Rebellion is behind the stealing of the Sorting Hat. I know you know who took it. Just tell me."
“No,” Harry softly responded, unsure how much he should admit. “I sort of just woke up here, in a way.”
I run a list of possible visitors through my head and can’t come up with anyone who would want to spend Twelfth Night with us. My mother hasn’t written us for five years and my grandparents would never willingly come into a Muggle neighborhood.
Harry was beginning to get dizzy, watching the white tiger. He reached out and pushed Draco back down onto the seat.
Draco grabbed Harry's hair and pulled, hard, until their noses were squishing together. Harry reached up and yanked off his glasses, throwing them somewhere. Harry then pulled Draco so hard that Harry fell backwards, his back landing on the desk, with Draco on top of him.
Draco was a tree and would remain a tree. It was now just a matter of time before Harry fulfilled this newest, cruelest destiny,. Magic was pulling until it got what it wanted.
George Potter leaned against the door jamb, his right arm raised. Harry tried not to wrinkle his nose at the long underarm hair. “You've got nothing else to go with other than this badge? Seems rather impossible, yeah?”
But Harry was a Gryffindor and couldn't help but go head-first into danger. “Then let’s talk about it somewhere else.”
'Fine, but I'm going with you. I want to see this map of yours, as well as your plans. There will be no surprises on this trip, Malfoy. The moment we step into danger, we will go back.'
! Harry is our Captain, and we listen to him at all times. I'm his first-mate, so you listen to me only part of the time. Luna is our communication specialist, so if you have a post that needs to be sent, you give it to her. Your cabins are all downstairs, we sleep two to a room. Padma and Luna will share the first cabin, Finn and Sir Culhwich will be in the second, and Malfoy and I will share the third cabin, where I can keep my eye on you.'
Harry wiped his hands on the towel and began to go upstairs, only to hear Teddy in his room. He poked his head in seeing Teddy with a smock, paint all over his fingers, and paint all over Draco’s easel.
“Just don’t expect miracles okay? I spoke to Andromeda and she’s still hurt. Old wounds like that, they don’t heal properly and they leave awful scars. Let them get used to each other first.”
"Tea leaves, actually," my father replies, sighing before finally taking a sip of his drink. "I have something to tell you and I’m not sure how you are going to take it."
“Seems to strange that Malfoy would be so good at something so whimsical. Malfoy really didn’t seem the whimsy type growing up,” Ron observed.
Draco looked around, seeing them hanging on the edge of a desk chair. He picked them up and placed them gently on Harry's face. Once on, Harry looked up to see Draco smiling at him.
Harry had just broken if off with Ginny. He was avoiding the Weasleys, afraid that they would revoke his place as an honorary family member after ending their dreams of marrying into the family. He never told Ginny exactly why he didn’t want to continue their relationship, but, to his relief, Ginny hadn't been happy with the relationship either, so their break-off was mutual and friendly. She, and Ron, tried to reassure him that the family would not be mad at him, but he couldn't help but avoid them, just in case Ginny and Ron were wrong.
"I know you're here, Potter, I saw the door opening in the middle of my class. You don't think I would have noticed?"
Luna and Dean kept firm hands on his shoulders while Padma and Finn rushed toward Draco's body. They ran a wand over his body, but their disappointed looks were confirmation enough of what had happened.
The man continued, scratching his armpit. “Went to school together in Little Whinging for a while, but then his family sent him to a correctional school named Bulldog or Brutus or something like that. Not sure why, the kid was a billy no-mate, stuck to himself. His cousin, though, was a real git. Used to shake down the younger ones for their lunch money.”
Oh, so he was magical. My palms itch and my heart speeds up. I don’t feel comfortable around magical people, especially ones I don’t know.
Teddy looked right at Draco. Draco smiled, obviously aware of what Teddy was about to say. How much had Harry missed by avoiding Draco throughout the years?
Harry held back. Luna transformed into her bird form and flew to Padma’s shoulder, tweeting back to Harry.
. Padma was securing a line on the mainsail, Luna right beside her moving the boom. Sir Culhwich was just emerging from the decks below, nodding to Harry before walking toward Padma and Luna to lend a hand. Finn was running about the deck, spelling off all the unwanted dirt and bird droppings. Dean was holding firm the captain’s wheel on the quarterdeck, steering the ship straight and true down the wide lazy river. Fawkes was perched high on the main topmast looking out into their surroundings. And Draco was standing on the forecastle staring into Lake Bheith.
Draco reached down and grabbed both their cocks, heavy and hard in his hand. Harry reached one hand down to help and the other to grab onto Draco's soft and supple arse.
So Harry did what he always did when he couldn't sleep, he wandered the halls until his body was near exhaustion. Somewhere along the way, Malfoy had joined him and had walked silently with him, until they both collapsed beside a wall in the middle of an empty hallway on the fifth floor. It was then that Malfoy brought up the issue of the wand.
Draco bowed his head in a surprisingly submissive manner. But Harry caught the smirk that he hid underneath his long fringe. Draco was still the bane of his existence, and still the only man that could get under his skin. Though irritated, this was still Harry's ship. He was the Captain, and therefore had the upper hand.
“No! I’ll be taken away again! I know it! I don’t want to be alone, Draco, not again. I haven’t seen anyone, not my parents, not Remus, not Sirius, not Dumbledore. No one. Just you. Don’t leave me! I couldn’t….I can’t….”
There is a silence. Every muscle in my body loosens as relief floods through my body. So he's not here to arrest my father. I thank every god and goddess I can think of that I know, and some made-up ones, and promise them all my left kidney if they ever need it.
Harry was having a hard time breathing. The world around him was spinning out of control. It felt as if the sky was on the ground and the ground was in the sky. His stomach was churning and his throat was closing up.
Martin, Merryweather, Nathon, Perry, all continued to be sorted into Slytherin. Harry could hear McGonagall begin to ascend, but the other professors were holding her back.
“What, did you think just because you survived the killing curse that somehow you would be immune? That was a lot different than a curse.”
They stayed silent for a while. Harry put his glasses back on and watched Draco’s back push in and out with his breaths. He reached out and stroked it with the back of his hand.
And yes, he was calling Malfoy “Draco” now. It was hard not to when all he ever heard from Teddy was
Harry heart began to start again, except now beating in an alarmingly fast rate. “I don’t understand what you are talking about.”
The sex was fantastic the second time around, now that Harry was fully sober and able to savor each moment. The taste of Draco's cock in his mouth, heavy and swollen, the feel of Draco's fine hair as he pulled on it, the sight of Draco's arse as Harry pressed his needy cock in and out, combined with the constant jingle jangle jingle jangle completely overpowered Harry’s brain until all he could hear, see, feel, taste and smell was Draco.
It's true. I love my father. I wouldn't be where I am, or who I am, without him. I try to yell it out, but the magic around me is too strong.
With those words, all stopped their morbid fascination with the ensuing fight between Dean and Finn and turned to stare at Luna who was busy twirling her yellow-feathered earrings around her fingers.
Four to six weeks! That would be cutting it really short. God forbid Harry was late on his Godson’s birthday present!
After dinner, and after Malfoy had finally left for the day, Harry went to Teddy’s room to finally spend some one on one time with his godson.
“So we left. Teddy is convinced that someone is going to take you away. I tried to reassure him, but he’s frightened.”
Draco watched his mother’s face. She was the one who taught him the power of keeping your feelings to yourself, but surely mention of her sister would rouse some kind of reaction, favorable or no. It did not.
I bound up the stairs two at a time, making as much noise as possible. My father dumps another box in my arms before I can get a word in and kicks me back toward the stairs. This one smells like salt and brine. It must be the seaweed.
"No, I don't think the Sorting Hat is wrong. Not for everyone. But imagine if I had been sorted into Ravenclaw or even Gryffindor. Maybe I would have rethought who I was and started to change then."
“And then when the war was over and your father was sent back to Azkaban, I wrote to her. I had hoped that the loss would perhaps soften her stubbornness, but I was mistaken. The letter was sent back in ashes. Do not grow attached, Draco. She threw everything away for a man. I would not doubt she would do it again.”
Draco pointed to the three long rows of twigs that littered the ground. It had taken him three days to get to this point. He was almost done.
“And Grandma is regretting that decision very much. Come on now, Teddy. It’s time for your bath and then bed time.”
Harry coughed and shifted away from Draco. 'At this point all we can do is a keep a watch on it until it comes closer. For all we know, it could be a resident of this island.'
My father knew my mother for exactly three days before she became pregnant. It was a chance meeting between two previous socialites who had been shamed out of their social scene; my father because he allowed Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and my mother because her father was found guilty of funneling money to Voldemort. They were a distraction for each other, one that didn't last very long.
“Then don’t say anything for a while. I think we have yet to stargaze and I believe we may see Draco, the constellation, tonight.”
Harry walked out of the Chief’s office strangely unnerved. Who would have an owl for a pet, Harry wondered. Wouldn’t they just shit all over the carpet?
Draco's smug face turned serious. 'On my father's deathbed, he gave me a map. He claimed that the map led to something that would bring the Malfoy name back from ruin, an object that could make us known for our goodness to humanity, and not our evil. But the map is old, inaccurate, and the location names are no longer current. The
I have no desire to touch his Cornflakes, but I move the plastic container and hide it behind the toaster, just to mess with his head. I reach into the fridge to pull out the milk and there is a note attached.
"I know you’re your awake, Hayden. If you were asleep there'd be strange, fat snores coming from your bedroom."
Harry’s day had been awful. The boys at the office had decided to decorate the Auror headquarters with toilet paper for Halloween, the
Taking a quick look round the back, Harry noticed something shiny in the distance, hidden by a tuft of grass. He approached the object cautiously, nudging it with his foot before flipping it over. It was a badge, and a strange one at that. It continued to turn back and forth from one picture to another.
Harry was stunned. He could hear the laughter and the amazement from the people on the lawn looking at the finished tree house, but he really couldn’t face them all right now. He was about to cry in front of 50 grownups all because he wasn’t allowed into a silly tree house.
Draco surged up in a feat of amazing strength and bit Harry hard on the ear. “It's a bloody eyesore, as are you. I much prefer doing this in the dark.”
Harry looked up. The clouds above were moving fast, their shapes changing and reforming countless times. It had been a long time since Harry had simply sat outside and enjoyed the nature around him. The trees off in the distance were starting to turn, their leaves changing from green to red, brown and gold. Soon it would be too cold to be outside all day. What would they do then?
. I only intend to borrow it for a few months, and then you can have it back, along with my silence as to the true owner. And, as sign of friendship, I won't inquire as to
“To be honest my father didn’t know about my obsession. He thought he had nipped it in the bud. As I grew older it became a great stress reliever. When times were tough I redesigned the tree house. I got quite good at it.”
Malfoy had an amazing ability to turn Harry's anger from a one to a ten in no time. But he wasn't going to let that bastard win. He would stay still until the man left.
The two lay quietly in the bed, listening to the beating of their own hearts and their ragged breaths for a while.
"Hagrid was the first magical person I met, my first friend really, and he was kind enough to help me with my shopping for my school supplies before school began. One of the first places we visited was Madame Malkin's. When a small little boy began to talk to me while he was being fitted for his robe, I listened, thinking perhaps I had met my first friend my age. He began to speak of the houses and announced that he was going to be in Slytherin. He was proud to be in the house of his parents and grandparents. But he insulted Hagrid, and from that mistake I decided that I didn't like him."
"I hope so. Although someone has got to teach that boy how to dress. All that leather every day definitely can't be good for him."
Draco continued to swat at the bird. 'I have my own owl, thank you. I don't trust a tiny bird not to lose my post.'
Harry got up and watched Snape spread the blanket over Draco. Draco's naps averaged about an hour, so Harry thought it might be a good time to have a snack.
All of Draco’s giggles and mocking attitude seemed to deflate. His face hardened, but not in anger, just in mild nonchalance. He flicked his wrist and his business card turned into a large black book.
Harry let his head fall back against the stone wall. The sounds of battle still resonated in the rocks. Hogwarts had just been through a war, they had all been through a war. Harry's hands still shook.
I slump down, peering at them from underneath my shaggy blond hair. They fit together, in a weird way. They seem to be opposites; blond hair and black, thin and wide, tall and short, and yet together it matches, like a black stripe down a yellow racing bike.
“How could I, Harry? Not when I saw your face every time I closed my eyes, felt my arms circling your waist. I know nothing ever happened. I know I had no right to hope, but I did, especially after you testified for me. You were so kind to me during the rebuilding of Hogwarts. We had such long talks, just you and me and the stars. And remember that broom ride? The fight to the Snitch? I finally caught it, Harry. I finally caught it, and then you were gone.”
My face must have shown my agony because my father lets go of Mr. Potter's hand immediately and reaches out for mine, but before he can touch me, I'm off, running towards the stairs to hide in my room.
“Yes. I make most of the meals for Andromeda and Teddy. If you would like I can just add an extra place setting for our meals. It won't be for too long."
He found Padma, Dean, and Luna first, throwing arrows and spells deep into the trees. 'What is going on?' he shouted, desperately looking for an attacker.
“Wha-?” Harry sputtered, imaging the many ways Draco would need his brute strength, and many of them having nothing to do with the tree house.
Considering Christmas was similar to what we were used to back in Wiltshire, we were quite surprised to find ourselves the only ones in our street with ribbons on our trees and grindylow-like scarecrows on our front lawn. But my father and I enjoy the celebration and it proves to be a great talking point with our neighbors, so it stuck.
'This is not the Harry Potter that I used to know. What happened to the boy who mindlessly disregarded rules and jumped head first into danger? You were the epitome of Gryffindor stupidity, much like Finn. When did you become a timid Hufflepuff? Does it have anything to do with your first-mate, Thomas? You need to learn to hide your pitying looks, Potter. The man clearly does not want them.'
Draco's smile turned into a smirk, but it was teasing rather than condescending. “It's about spiritual love, the type of love that buries itself deep within you, hiding and growing without your knowledge. I believe Yeats was referring to the love that God has for His Muggles, but I think it could also mean a parent's love, born before the child is fully aware of what love is. Or a lover, who has fallen in love without recognition.”
After hours of exploration and whispered promises, the two had fallen asleep, Draco on Harry's chest, Harry's arm wrapped around him tight.
Harry took a hard look at Draco before responding. “Actually, I think I'm due for a holiday. I'm sorry, sir, but I don't think you'll see me next week.”
When Snape turned back towards the cottage Harry began to scream at nothing and everything at the same time until his voice gave out completely.
He couldn't stop his brain from retreating back to the goblin's warning remarks to Draco. What did she mean? Was Draco planning on doing something dangerous with the Magical Cauldron once he found it?
Harry had heard that Padma had run away from her family after refusing their arranged marriage, going native in the Amazon, hunting down rare and unusual magical animals. But, it was still such a shock to see Padma so changed.
Oh. He hadn’t even thought he would get to decide. The simple answer would be just to do another version of Andromeda’s house, but that didn’t seem right. It was his gift to Teddy, so it should reflect some his own ascetics. Andromeda’s house was nice enough, but not really his style. It was too modern and square.
“My father's a good man, see? He knows I can't do magic, but he never makes me feel like I'm missing out. It's been so long since I've seen anything magical, even from him, that sometimes I forget it exists! He does everything the Muggle way, and even though he's never said, I know he does it on purpose, to make me feel comfortable. Do you know he rides a bicycle everywhere? And he purchases copies of my school books and reads them all before the start of the year so he can help me with my homework.”
But fate has something else in store for me, as my usual flailing is not working and gravity has finally come to collect on all those near misses. I reach out to grab hold of the banister, as a last ditch effort, but my hand catches on a sharp piece of seashell and I let go: a mistake that costs me dearly.
The woman sighed and pointed to a large stack of envelopes and magazines sitting on a small table by the door. “If I did, I'd get rid of all this.” She picked up a magazine with a large man holding a row of meat. “
But the thick heavy tree stumps for feet were not something that could be hidden away, tucked underneath a polo shirt and a scarf.
Parked inside the cold cement room was his sleek silver and black 1939 BSA  motorbike. He lifted the garage door, and then pulled out his bike, enjoying the cold metal against his hands. He climbed atop the seat, strapped on his helmet, and turned the sucker on, the warm vibration a familiar sensation.
Stepping around the crime scene photographer, Harry made his way around the house, his hands deep in his pockets, his eyes blinking in the rain. He could feel the water soaking into every nook and cranny of his body and he wished, not for the first time, he just had a magic wand to make it all go away.
Draco flicked Harry's cheek. 'Again with the staring. You’d best be careful, or else your First Mate might get the wrong idea.' Draco and Harry both looked over at Dean who quickly turned his head back to the rope he was securing, obviously embarrassed at being caught staring. 'Oops, looks like he already has.'
Harry sighed. How dare Draco be rational? 'It's not your fault. You aren't a mind reader or a Seer. Today's events were my fault. My gut was telling me to retreat and I ignored it.'
Richard ripped a piece of paper from his notebook and handed it to Harry. Normally, detectives were more territorial about their cases, but it appeared none felt the need to push for ownership of this one.
“The house-elf said I had to prove my worth, so I stuck myself to the tree and hoped for the best. Did you know that you have an adder snake in this tree that likes to watch your mother knit? Fingers fascinate him.”
was on its way to the Cock-Eyed Squid, barrelling through the high waves. Littering the water were large rocks, forcing Harry to keep the ship far from the cliff shore. That distance meant that Harry was unable to spot the cave before the ship had suddenly stopped.
I dare not look at my father. He thinks I don't know he's got copies of my maths and history books underneath his bed.
Harry rushed over to the cage and attempted to throw every unlocking and opening spell he could think of at the cage, but nothing worked.
Harry's head was spinning. His breath was coming in faster and faster and he was having a tough time concentrating. Dean came in to focus, a hand on his arm, and for a moment Harry was right back to that time five years ago in Africa, when instead of Luna trapped with an unknown mad man, it was Dean held hostage and tortured by a so-called friend.
Draco shook his head, overwhelmed by Harry’s understanding. When he had gone home, ranting and raving into his pillow, he realized that much of his anger had little to do with Harry’s mistake and more to do with his frustration at his mother and his aunt. When Harry had lied and claimed Draco was over at their house to “reconcile with the family” he first thought the excuse was a crock of shite. But, as time went on, the idea had appeal. His mother had been so lonely, so listless since his father’s imprisonment. And he himself, while working steadily, had little time for thought on his family role. But now, with Teddy reminding him at every turn that he was family and the ease in which he fit into their family meals, the reconciliation had become a dream that he thought he could achieve. The fight with his mother had squashed that idea, and he had taken out his disappointment on Harry.
Draco pulled Harry along to the bathroom, throwing the clothes into a pile in the corner. They instantly disappeared. Harry squawked.
When he saw Draco Malfoy on the other side with the same look he usually gave Harry when Snape was about to chew him out, Harry did the only thing one could do; he slammed the door in his face. When he heard knocking again his hands worked faster than his brain opening the door again, only to be met with a more angry Draco Malfoy who had enough time to push his way inside before Harry was able to slam the door.
Draco sat, but he didn’t look happy about it. He stared at Harry, who had returned to watching Draco like a particularly interesting piece of art.
He could just image Teddy falling asleep after a long day playing pretend and not having to carry him down to the house, instead tucking him in a bedroom made just for him, and then he himself crawling into a bed, a window over him so he could see the stars.
A door slams and then I hear heavy shuffling in the hallway. I throw the folder back into Mr. Potter's suitcase and flee downstairs, slipping on the hardwood floor again and banging into Mr. Potter. He tries to help me up, but I can't face him.
Draco had not entered his bed nude, but he was now. Sleeping on his stomach with the sheet twisted around his right leg, Harry could see the sweat trickle from the top of his back, down his spine, and off to the side, right before reaching his perfectly-shaped arse.
Draco led him around the balconies, the kitchen with giant windows looking out into the forest, and the circular living room with a large, cushioned couch and several pillows on the floor. There was a giant wood stove in the middle of the room.
After the incident at Ollivander’s my mother wanted to send me off, like a broken toy, to an Orphanage for Squibs, and try again for a real son. My grandfather agreed with her, and my grandmother stood by her husband. It was only my father who disagreed. Against the wishes of his wife and his parents, my father moved me to the one place where I wouldn’t be a failure or a dud, and that was the Muggle world.
It was the wrong thing to say because Draco stood, yanking Harry up beside him. “How in the world did you ever become a hero? You are worthless! You just give up? After two failed ideas you just give up?”
as it did not immediately set sail in a direction. Instead, the wood on the deck began to vibrate. Harry could see the magic swirling around the boat, surrounding everything and everyone in a thin mist of sparks and light.
Draco snorted, relaxing on his heels and folding his arms together. 'Fine, my captain, I will endeavour to endear the ship to me. But beware, I'm a known charmer and I would hate to get between a man and his boat.'
“Not in that way. She wanted to be friends again. She'd come over, bring ice cream, let me vent about you. I had no idea, Harry. None. Kingsley said Pansy was probably attempting to dig me for information. She figured the best way to find you would be through me.”
I duck my head, completely shamed at my behavior while rubbing the back of my skull. My father has quite an arm on him.
Draco held up a hand. “Harry, you never made me into a wand. You have to! Magic knew you would refuse until we met like this. Please, you have to make me into a wand.”
After regaining my breath, I open my eyes to see my father hovering over me with a smirk on his face. He reaches down, swipes my socks from my feet, and pats my head.
Suddenly, Harry was tired. His bed called out to him and he was eager to answer. He felt as if he could sleep a million years, and was probably going to do so. It would be the first sleep without the threat of Voldemort invading his dreams. He could sleep without fear.
was ripped. But to be honest, I’m not sure it would have made a difference. A tree house is the perfect birthday gift for Teddy. It seems like something a child should have. So, if you wouldn’t mind, I'll have that consultation, please. Afterwards I will pay your fee.”
Harry bristled at the sound of Draco's voice. 'I trust this ship much more than a man who has lived alone on an island for 600 years.'
"Tonight, at 6:23. I advise you take your Invisibility Cloak and just observe. No need for you to go half cocked into a room full of students. We really don't know what's going to happen in that room. It could be a sing-a-long for all we know."
, made him appreciate Malfoy’s talent even more. Harry wasn’t stupid, but these spells required finesse and grace, two qualities Harry lacked. He was more of a brute-force kind of guy.
Teddy looked up from his coloring book. Harry held on tighter to Teddy, just in case what he said was met with resistance.
Harry fell knees first onto the ground, his eyes wide. Time stopped and his heart and lungs refused to work. His brain got fuzzy and he couldn't move.
Parkinson! Harry remembered Neville saying he was a horrible boy, hated plants. Most likely he was Malfoy's favorite student, being a fan of mischief himself.
Wracking his brain, Harry couldn’t imagine how one or even a group of people could do so much damage, unless they used a brush cutter which, as crazy as it sounded, was probably close to the truth.
Mr Potter is also in the picture, although he looks really different. He's standing beside my father, his hand on his shoulder. He's less bulky, scrawny actually, and he's blinking ridiculously underneath the flash of the cameras. His glasses are more like the nerd-specs I had imagined, but Harry still wears them like a weapon, and less like a tool to help him see.
was another successful Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes product that became a necessity in modern life. Equipped in every office, the
Draco then paused, as if searching out his words. 'I know I wasn't meant to overhear your conversation with Dean earlier. But I have to admit I'm glad I did. I was having trouble reconciling the boy I knew back in Hogwarts with you.'
"It's what you taught me, Harry. You chose to fight for Muggles even though your own Muggle family never treated you right. You saved Draco's life even though he tried to end yours. You raised me, even though you had no idea how to do it. You raised me right, Harry, and you left big shoes to fill. This is my attempt."
Harry threw the sticks from his arm into the pile. He had been walking to and from the forest, collecting what he could, and bringing it all back just to start all over again. He was tired, hot, and in need of a nap.
With Draco's voice the reality of the situation came into focus. Harry was no longer in his house, waking for his normal morning routine. Instead, he was on the
The two remained on top of the desk, breathing hard, naked, sticky and sweaty. Draco had relaxed into the V of Harry's legs, his head resting on Harry's shoulder. Harry had brought his hand up and was tracing pattern's onto Draco's back.
It had been hard to watch the snow cover the tree, its branches dipping low under the weight of the snow. Harry would bring out blankets only to have Snape ridicule him for foolishness. It was foolish, but what if Draco was cold. It looked cold out there to Harry.
Draco’s back was covered in light brown bark. The wood was knobby and marbled, whirling around Draco’s back in a mishmash of flowing patterns. It looked hard and stiff, and yet it moved with Draco’s breathing. Harry reached out, brushing a hand down the wood. It felt like wood, hard and brittle; it smelled like wood, earthy and fresh. It really was tree bark growing on Draco’s back. It was both amazing and terrifying.
So, he spent his time with Neville and dug in the dirt planting magical plants and staring at Neville all day. Neville was open and cheerful, filling Harry with such cheery happiness he couldn't help but want to spend time with him. As loving and devoted Neville was to his plants, Harry imagined that love and devotion focusused on him. It was a heady feeling, and Harry craved it.
'Like Luna said earlier, I don't like owls. I need a way to communicate if something goes wrong. I trust Luna, and with more than my post,' Harry replied, walking away from Draco and releasing the main sail. Draco followed him.
Finn, grabbing the smallest and fastest broom, zoomed off into the air first, flying in circles above the rest, eager to begin. The small man was practically bouncing with excitement on his broom, his feet swaying in the wind.
“Fine. Mr. Potter, please take a look at my previous clients to get a feeling of the work that I have done in the past and what I am capable of. Many clients want miniature versions of their own homes, but if you have a different design in mind I can work from that as well. I can make the house fit for children, or adults. The price is determined on size, difficulty, materials, and design work. Obviously a replica of another structure is much easier to do, and is cheaper, but I can and will design a house on request.”
Teddy hugged Harry hard, but his cries were softening. After a few moments Teddy fell asleep on his shoulder. He and Andromeda walked him into Teddy’s room. Harry placed him in the bed and tucked him in, planting a kiss on his forehead. He hugged Andromeda and then she fled to her room. She looked to be on the verge of crying herself.
'Listen, Harry, I know you worry about me. I see the way you look at me. At first I thought it was just my injuries, and trust me, Harry, we do need to talk about that some day. But today, I think I sensed something different.'
“Harry, I’m here, I’m here. Shh. I won’t let you go. Do you think I would let you go? We’ll get up. We’ll leave the train together. I’ll keep a firm grip on your hand. Just try to pry us apart. It won’t happen.”
I fly from my bedroom and into the hallway, my hands waving in front of me, my yellow-socked feet slipping on the hardwood floor. Had I not steadied myself on the wood banister I might have knocked over my father, who is currently balancing on the shaky pull-down steps that leads to our dusty attic. He gives me an aggravated sigh and hands me a box.
“We're going to find a cure for this Draco! We have to! We'll have you back in no time and we'll do all those stupid things that I can't help thinking about. You have to because I love you. I can't lose another person. Please, don't leave me too.”
Harry turned around. Narcissa and Draco had just stepped out of the backdoor looking extremely uncomfortable around the loud and boisterous Weasleys and their very conservative Muggle dress. Narcissa was wearing a spring dress with what looked like tulle underneath the skirt and Draco was wearing an argyle jumper, in the late spring.
There was hardly room to walk between the shelves of wands. Wand boxes were piled high on each shelf and precariously stacked on the floor. Harry tried to walk cautiously, but his foot or elbow caught on several boxes, sending them spilling onto the floor. And yet Ollivander continued his straight path ahead, leaving no time for Harry to stop and pick them up.
spell to let the man speak. He began to laugh. 'You aren't a bright one, are you, Potter? The Malfoys are under an Unbreakable Vow to never speak of the Magical Cauldron's true nature, but I knew something was up when the Malfoy boy started snooping around and asking people for information about cauldron myths. Voldemort thought perhaps the black cauldron was real, but we never found proof. So I decided to approach the brat to offer my services as a recluse history expert. From there, it was quite easy to put the pieces together. You led us right to it.'
Only then did Harry allow himself to take a look around the room. Like the hall earlier, the throne room was also filled with various sized cages containing all different types of birds. But in here, Harry could feel the magic surrounding the cages, keeping the animals confined. Upon further inspection Harry discovered that these birds were different than the ones in the hall. These birds were all magical.
Harry sat shocked. He had never seen Malfoy so impassioned, or so self-reflective. Malfoy's nose was flaring and his cheeks were flushed. His eyes were wide, like saucers, and had settled into a shade of gray Harry had never seen before. Malfoy stared into Harry face imploringly, as if by his will alone Harry could think of a way to destroy the wand, but instead Harry’s mind was filled with the colour of Draco’s eyes. He lifted his hands to pull Draco’s fists from his shirt, but the moment their hands touched Harry’s hands refused to be removed from Draco’s skin.
Malfoy took Harry’s amazement in stride. He must always have this reaction when showing this picture.
Finally fed up with this farce of a dinner I place my napkin on the table and settle my fork on the edge of my plate. I’m about to start interrogating Mr Potter when my father interrupts me with ridiculous
Kreacher stared at Harry, his large eyes wide. “Oh no, Master Draco never completed the requirements. He mentioned it quite often that the mark would not take unless he took a life. I heard Mistress Narcissa and Master Draco speaking about it. He was quite distressed that the Dark Lord would discover his deficiency.” Kreacher paused. “Would you like me to observe Master Draco’s skin now?”
