He signed to Andy for the baby and he swelled with pride when he saw Dracy cradling the baby close to her chest and trying to give their little beanie a kiss on the forehead but was obviously failing.
"Hey, fiancee" Harry winked cheekily.
Dracy’s eyes widened, “Me?”
“How much?”
Ron nodded at his description, "That sounds like someone you should avoid"
Looking around the eight year table, he saw the lot doing everything but study. Neville got his huge Advanced Herbology book that literally spits out poison if not properly handled (which he is currently and hardly dealing with), Dean was staring into the abyss of his Transfiguration notes— having lost all hope when he failed to turn his boyfriend into a toad.
“Miss me?” he asked and chuckling when Draco jumped on his seat again. How lovely to see Draco jumping on him soon.
Draco sobbed, desperate to do just that as his pace falter. The familiar recoil on his stomach surging to his balls, he whined loudly and let go. He spurted his cum on his skirt and his lace panties that were now drenched in his own juices. He moaned or probably screamed, as white dots invaded his sight and his mouth hang open.
“That’s it. Let ‘em out like a good kitten” he purred encouragingly, “Sounding so adorable and hot, bunny. ‘m gonna make you feel so good”
“So needy” Harry growled and bent down, easily crowding Draco.
And now, it rang to his mind for what Moony had told him. Understand each other’s side. No matter how far-fetched the idea might be, Harry knows he is right.
“You sound so sexy, little one. So sexy for daddy—
“Hmm. Tasty” she mumbled, chewing on the food. Harry smiled before chewing on his own and agreeing.
. Draco breathed heavily, hands clenching as he laid there all bare for Harry to see, flushed and already too dazed,
His confusion must be displayed all over his face because the bartender chuckled and winked at him, “You probably need it, Mr. Blogger”
Ah. Yep. She’s definitely going to pop their baby now.
“Pick anything you want” he whispered. Dracy gulped when she felt Harry’s front pushed to her back, his hand unclasping her fingers and went to feel one lacy thong between his fingertips, “Anything that you feel pretty in”
“Dray” Harry called his husband just as they arrived from side-along apparition, he tried to hold him by the wrist to keep him on his presence but Draco merely smiled at him and brushed his hand away gently.
He wasn’t even sure whether he’s to brood, emote, cry, or punch someone he sees. It would’ve been better if he meets some asshole he can beat to vent some things out. He immediately wanted to sort things out between them but he wanted to spare himself a scratch of pride.
Andy chuckled, putting on her gloves before hiking her dress up and feeling her round stomach, “Wow, wow”
She glared at him, “Shut up”
“I didn’t think you’d come back someday” Dracy stated honestly, “You were gone for Merlin knows how long until I got used to your absence and then I became numb”
“Harry, please, let me cum. Let me cum—fuck!” she sobbed when Harry inserted another finger and curled them just right.
The next thing Draco felt before losing himself to sleep was arms pulling him close to a body.
“’Mione”
“And you know how omegas are, bud. They never ask unless it’s what they really need and want to. You must have been an amazing alpha partner. She needs you and trust me, you’ll regret it if you don’t”
Fuck.
Perhaps he had succeeded getting the man.
“As you know, I should not be engaging in such acts with you. We are in a public space, if you could keep your hands to yourself, that would be deeply appreciated” he squeezed his wrist gently.
"I don't need another balding auror"
She smiled prettily, wearing the peculiar colorful glasses he had seen years ago, “Hello, Harry Potter. I was looking for some wrackspurts and I see a lot above your hair”
“I can give you whatever you want. You want me and I want you” he whispered, “Have fun with me”
It started when Draco had the bravery to communicate.
Sirius laughed and laid a hand in his godson’s shoulder, “Little prongs, I don’t have a lot of anything sirius—fine, serious, to say because for me, there’s not much to think about”
“Keep to the task at hand—  Pansy, do not mess with those— Neville, why did you bring a Mandrake in here! Get that back in—  Merlin’s beard, Luna, there are no nargles around the tree. Don’t hang those necklaces in there—  I’m gonna die” Draco mumbled harshly, wiping the sweat off of his forehead.
Draco hummed, “Minister of Magic?”
“What the fuck is this?” he clenched his fist, “This is waitlisted until further notice. Get the fuck out of my office, rat’s nest”
“Yes, baby. Don’t you want to go?”
“Hmp” he softly whined and stared at the book he’s holding. He’s not even reading, he’s just looking. His attention is wandering around Harry and those hands, those lips, those eyes, that bird’s nest, and that sexy body. That so goddamn sexy beard that somehow managed to look so attractive on him.
Ginny who Luna said will come join later. Apparently, she was busy writing several letters home, thanking her mother for sending knitted sweaters they can wear for tomorrow.
“Hmm. How am I supposed to believe that?” Harry asked, his hands trailing down Draco’s back to massage the sides of his waist. What a small boy. So good against his broad frame, the way it would tense against his hold, and the way it would be a flushed when Harry kisses it, put colors in that pale color, have his own way and let others know who owns him. And of course, let himself realize it is him who can claim the boy’s innocence. Corrupt him with every fiber of his being.
Harry was about to take another step when he cursed aloud when someone from the corner pulled him by the wrist.
“I’ve been so fucking patient. Allowed you to do things to me, gave you consent to touch me, accepted you even when you BOUGHT ME LIKE A FUCKING WHORE! You don’t even want to mark me! Claim me completely and don’t want to love me as your omega! And as soon as you’ve knocked me up, you do this—
He bit on his lips, nibbling on the fine line between hesitance and cowardly thoughts.
He watched him took something out of his jean pockets and to say his jaw drop was understatement. His mind went slack and his body gone rigid as he took in Harry kneeling.
He nearly threw a fit when neither looked up. Crossing his arms to his chest, he stomp a foot to the floor, waiting for them to look up. And it took minutes before Harry turned his eyes to his, they were playful and challenging.
But it won’t hurt anyone if she just lay down a bit with the oddities. He’s not calling her weird or what, he’s labeling the mystery she shows off as odd.
“I put it in the paper—
“Come on. Cum for me, doll. Cum for me, wanna feel you clench around my cock” Harry demanded, his right hand beginning to tug at Draco’s own cock.
That was fucking mindblowing, “H-harry” he called,
He gulped, feeling mixed up feelings at the moment as Harry smirked at him deviously, “And you’re going to be a good boy”
Draco jumped in his seat, raising his head and scowling at the sight of him, “Are you seriously my boss? You’re late to your appointments!”
“Harder. Please, ooh, harder. I’m coming, Alpha” she moaned loudly and Harry did just that.
Draco bent down and peck him on his lips, “They aren’t just words, Harry. So please don’t think that way”
His eyed nearly dropped out of its socket when Harry spun his body to face him, hands gripping his waist to lift him up and kissed him. Like with the complete intensity, desire, and strange kind of pleausre shooting out from his spine like a cannon.
They were having a simple date night inside Harry’s house. It was a surprise from the Alpha when he arrived from his stroll to somewhere he wouldn’t reveal to her. He was holding a pack of her favorite chocolates she happily ate before taking a nice shower.
He was quite enjoying the crappy movie when he heard a knock from his door.
“Ssh. Calm down” Harry run a hand up and down her back comfortably, massaging her tensed shoulder right after as he leaned and peck a kiss on her cheek. He didn’t pull back as he look at the side of her beautiful face, “I’m sorry. I’m just worried and want to make sure the baby is alright. If you’re scared, be scared in my arms”
He’s just out there, swaying his hips with that fitted pencil cut skirt, giving everyone a nice sight of that plump butt but not letting even just Harry get a taste.
As Sirius opened the grand door, not bothering to knock, Lucius had found the interior even more luxurious. Contrary to their house that’s all vintage furniture, emerald and black walls, the place around them was of creamy white, with timber floors, adorned with porcelain vases and a white flowery patterns in the ceiling. The staircase is wooden while the railings were glass and a fresh scent of lavender filling their senses.
Why is Draco wearing a silk nightdress? The fuck?
Harry looked over at the papers he has at his home office. The papers stack to one another as he tired to read and reread all information provided in the documents. He needs to have them sent to the Ministry urgently.
“Don’t you fucking tell me what to do!”
Draco was half expecting to be wrapped with a thick blanket but he was not at all surprised when he found himself at Harry’s cocoon of sweet kisses, warm breath fanning his cold skin after such a nice and steamy night in his bed and with Harry’s hands around him, tightly.
“No” he responded, not bothering to lie because he knew Ron wouldn’t scold him like how Hermione scolds him. He wouldn’t push Harry to do things he doesn’t want.
He shook his head, “I do not expect you to forgive me now” he tried to smile but ended up grimacing, “I can see how happy you are. I just wanted to hopefully settle things with my daughter so you could truly move on with your life”
It’s no secret that Harry James Potter is one of the most sought Alphas out there. Being one of the wealthiest, strongest, and most powerful wizard known in the modern times. And noted by every wizarding tabloids to be the most influential in addition to bagging the first spot of being omegas’ preference.
“YES! Do you see these eyebrows? They’re falling off!”
And fuck, it's happening again. Harry knows that.
Harry helped her get into the hospital bed and guided her to lie down. He grasped her hand as Andy asked for permission to hike her blouse up before she get on with her work. She flick her wand and began to chant some incantations Dracy had never once encountered in her life before.
His smile did everything to show how happy he is to wake up like this. This morning filled with nothing but Harry’s spoiling. The kisses he knows he would never get tired of, and that palms gliding over his sticky thighs, still marked with the remnants of their orgasms even when Harry had taken it upon himself to provide him a heartwarming aftercare.
But he still tried to. Whatever or whoever possessed him when he saw the door wide open, calling out to him and grabbed this chance, he knew of what mistake he had made. He doesn’t even know where he is, not aware of where they are, of what continent, what country, what town.
“And if I ask you the same thing, would you answer? I doubt that. Because you’re a selfish bastard who can only think about himself—
He shook his head and stood up. He didn’t wake up for this. Nope.
Pulling away, Draco looked up the sky. Just above their heads were the beautiful fireworks, heart shaped ones with the words
Harry understood and his hands slid to hold him under his thighs and Draco might have screamed when it was Harry who was suddenly pounding roughly into him. He cried out, hand grasping the dogtags and pulling on it.
He helped him out of his clothes before Harry took his own off. He latched his lips on Draco’s collarbone and bit. Draco mewled, feeling the way his cock began to harden as Harry pawed on his nipples.
hello! Okay so I used the character i invented, Valsken Vokbin from my oneshot Sing Me Your Nonsense. :))
"Lucius' son?" James asked, his arm wrapped around Lily's shoulders as all eyes were focused on their son.
Draco gasped, “Y-you do?”
“Get out!”
His arms tightened around his wife as the man slowly lowered his newspaper and came in view, the man Sirius told them about.
His thighs threatened to close but one cold tut from Harry and he held his place.
Harry was right.
She did not let herself be defeated. After all, this game has to be as competitive as possible. If she so just give it up easily, what would that make her? Her name, as infamous as it may be, she centered as someone who’s hard to tame. Like a lion, tiger or a python.
He’s what people call a playboy. Not so typical kind of wizard playboy. The Daily Prophet had noted his ability to spoil his current omega rotten. Shops, endless gifts, heaps of flowers, nice dates in the public but they also noted how these omegas do not last longer than a week.
“Are you fucking serious?!” Harry cussed. Not paying attention to his wording.
He took a step closer, weighing his movements and watched her like his prey.
P.S. Sporadic updates are very likely.
Draco cried out. Not yet. Fuck. Not yet. Too soon. Too fucking soon.
, more—fuck yeah” he sobbed as warm mouth took his cock, pumping his head immediately up and down his shaft, not giving him a moment of relief as he was assaulted by pleasure mixed with tinging sensation on his body, wracking him up with combined emotions.
. He was surrounded by a bunch of idiots. What was he saying apology is in order?
Little by little, Harry corrupted his being like a snake, slithering in silently, making their way up with the most venomous of pleasures, the most filthy of words, but the most magical of hands.
She let him cry all those emotions out. The reality that Harry held for so long crushed her own heart. She kissed him on the head for several times, letting some of her scent to comfort him, ease him, and hopefully, make him better.
“Dracy, you didn’t answer my question”
Currently, it’s a busy work near midnight. Customers coming in and out, drinking beer, eating chips and playing pool. Draco’s lithe frame sitting by the counter and taking money and giving change. There were some truck drivers who orders what definitely off the night menu, a coffee. Some were known regulars watching sports on the television and some were new faces just trying out and coming in for fun.
He shrugged, “It’s fine” he simply answered, not having interest to talk about the matter more.
Her legs opened on their own accord. She could feel how ruined her panties are and how wet she is from her own arousal, slick sliding out of her cunt.
Draco nodded, taking his spent energy to pull his jeans up. His body leaned at the wall behind him as he watched Harry fixed himself before clearing his throat.
those muscles are to die for.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, “That many?”
“What about you?”
He smiled and settled down on the bed as he looked at the innocent coat laying on the chair at the corner.
“H-how did you find me?” her voice broke as she eyed what was left of her father.
"I always get what I want" he grinned, "And I want you, Harry"
She can feel him at her buttocks. The hardening length, huge and surely, powerful. She can feel all of him above her and his clothes. She can feel him.
"I'm sorry your what?"
Harry chuckled, “Of course, you are”
Harry sighed and smiled at his little boy. Encircling an arms around the slim waist as he cupped his cheek with the other and played with his bottom lip, "What is it, angel?"
“Not a word, Draco” he hissed and warned, unbuckling his belt and tossing it carelessly and unzipping his pants down but not removing.
“You’re worrying too much. Trust me, Harry. Draco may be eighteen on his age but he’s not on his mind. He may be a boy in the eyes but he’s a little devil”
But what can he do?
Before his fucking godfather decided to ruin that.
"Can I hire him after you do?" Pansy asked and he raised an eyebrow at her. Pansy is known to be a flirty woman and goes wherever she can, wherever she's flexible to. He had seen her flirt with anyone. Doesn't matter if it's a man or not because she'll shoot her shot.
“Come on, my love. Cum for me” Harry rutted ruthlessly, bouncing him fastly.
“Come on, kitten. Need to see you cum” Remus whispered huskily, continuing his endless dirty talks. Ones that never failed to elicit such vulgar reactions out of him.
His mission to seduce, Senator Harry James Potter. The good 'gentleman'. Generous. Humble. Giving. Tall. Dark. Handsome. One who walks with kindness and one who bows to every little thing to pay respect and gratefulness.
She hesitated to pick even just a piece of it but she remembered his statement that she can pick anything, anything that she’d feel pretty in. She gave up the control and began to pick while basing her preferences on her knowledge. She studied everything with close eyes and when she have them wrapped in a white cloth she got from the saleslady, she went in the counter and saw Harry paying what seemed to be more than a thousand galleons.
Draco’s mind twirled as he relished in the sensations. The rough and harsh poundings, the sound of Harry’s flesh making contact with his, he practically yelled as he began to feel the familiar tightening of his balls and the recoil in his stomach, “Please, gonna cum, sir. Please, wanna cum”
As Sirius continued to moan and beg and scream, his body tensing as the last bit of his husband’s words fell directly to his balls. The intensity stealing his control as he tensed and his vision felt like fading.
He thrust into him harshly, hands gripping his hips tight, leaving marks and bruises on its wake. He moaned loudly as Harry pounded particularly in a good spot. His cheeks heating when Harry smirked at him, “found it, kitten”
“Draco please take your sobering potion and go to sleep” it was Harry’s turn to plead.
He sighed dreamily. The moon shines bright every night. It glistens every time Remus exercise in their home, it flexes as he cooks. He had it memorized in his mind. Every contour, every shape, every lining, every muscle, every lines on his body is embedded on him.
Is he kidding?!
The lunch was good even when they didn’t talk much. So, when it came to end and Harry handed a sack of galleons, he stood up and approached her. Offering his arms, she followed her to the floo.
Her lips quivered. When she needed someone, Lucius disappeared and when she’s losing hope, Harry came in. Now, she’s content, Lucius came back.
“I just did” he stated before walking off his office and looked at his secretary who was busy doing her work, “Julia” he called.
“Hi, Luna” Pansy greeted who suddenly wore a friendly demeanor for the beautiful woman.
“We missed seventh year so I’m going back and besides, I cannot say no to the new Headmistress” He reasoned out, the respect he holds for the woman who always looked out for him was high up on the pedestal.
Luna giggled, “That’s nice. The wrackspurts and blibbering humdingers finally left you alone, huh?”
Harry laughed for the cute action and pecked his lips for several times. Fuck. He felt like floating above the clouds.
He nodded instantly, moaning as Harry’s heat practically seep to his own body. The broad torso Harry displayed before his eyes was a sight to behold and Draco raked his gaze down to the obvious huge bulge on his pants, bigger than what he saw back at his office.
She smiled sympathetically, “It’s okay. I take them as the creatures that they are and you can take them in any form you want”
Draco made sure of the schedule, made sure not to have a flaw on his plan. He never disappoints. Not when he was very well wounded at the lack of reaction he is getting from him.
Harry chuckled as his hand dropped from Draco’s shoulder to his waist, faking a sip but not really taking a gulp,, “We figured we could have some fun outside. Plenty of time to make the place our home”
Parvati blinked, “Right. I forgot. You were closeted for how many years?”
“I’m busy, Draco” Harry responded nonchalantly even if he knew he's far away from being nonchalant.
It was only after a minute when Malfoy’s face contorted with confusion as he peek inside the cauldron. Curious as to what he was seeing, Harry mimicked the action and found that the supposed natural color of the potion have turned green with a tinge of red, glowing and bubbling furiously.
She remembered her statement. She likes to give as much as she takes. She took Harry's affection, kisses, sweet gestures. It's her turn to give him the same and more.
Harry sighed. Okay. Maybe he really is playboy.
“Oh, fuck” he cussed, looking at himself under the blankets and sighed dramatically when he saw he still had his own clothes on from last night. He held his head when it throbbed in pain and he groaned.
He smirked. That always works.
Dracy looked down. She’s ashamed and afraid.
Massage. There are a lot of possibilities that can happen if he’s to massage Draco and fuck yes but hell no.
Draco’s knees buckled at the sound of his name. It was so said so casually but freely. Unrestrained.
She bowed her head and taking a deep breath, hoping to relax herself.
Surprisingly, the man let him take his time. He stared and there was a hint of smile on his lips as he let Draco skim his cheeks with his fingers. The softness of his small hands have given him more desire to protect him and lock him inside the cabin. Away from everyone.
“I hate you so I’m not going to give you anything” he answered as he accepted the flower. It looked nice in all honesty.
"Draco" he heard Harry warned with a low voice but he ignored it as he buried his nose in his spine and inhaled some more. Harry is just so pleasing. He went all out with his clothes tonight because he wanted to be ravished by the old man until tomorrow.
“A bet? What’s really happening right now?”
For pete’s sake, they were supposed to be in love.
There was a roar when the bottle pointed at Blaise and the bottom landed on Millicent.
Harry’s eyes went tender before lifting their interlaced hands together and pecking a soft kiss on the back of her hand, “You deserve to be, baby”
He used to look so healthy. What monsters did he have to face? More cruel than her own? Traumatizing like Harry’s?
“Great. I’ve read two books and cleaned the place”
Dracy’s eyes widened even more, her eyes alternated between Harry’s hand to his eyes. She gulped before she move away on her spot to stand in front of Harry.
I think this turned a little bit more emotional than I intended it to be but as promised, no angst ;)
He smiled coyly for how he literally can feel the heat radiating off of Harry behind him and the rough breaths echoing in his ear despite the booming noise around them.
Harry loved the focused expression on him. It makes him look a lot hotter, just beauty and big brains— something he himself doesn’t have at usual times.
Harry turned to her and ushered her to take a seat at the cushions and he stood in front of her, looking down, he brushed a stray of hair and tucked it behind her ears, “Do you wish to buy any?”
Harry was fast to turn his back around with a satisfied grin and her lips parted in realization.
He wanted to roll his eyes and waved his hand to call for the server. When a server arrived whose nametag says Limo, he handed them the menu.
“Give or take?” he raised an eyebrow.
“Shall we get this?” Dracy murmured and Harry hummed, eyes glaring at the people who’s brave enough to spare them second glance.
He’s beginning to slip off.
Harry is the boss.
He vaguely felt it when Harry pulled both of his legs apart to give room and began to grazed through his perineum before pulling back. Draco whined, wanting to feel it longer but Harry shushed him down and spat on his fingers before continuing.
“I’ll cook you your dinner and you shall rest well after. Your duties start tomorrow” Harry kissed her pointy nose before disappearing to the kitchen.
He opened his mouth right away and Harry slid in one finger. He immediately got to work, swirling  his tongue on his digit, effectively wetting Harry’s thick finger.
All Draco did is to take in what Harry gives him. Noisy and loud but they both didn’t care. Harry loved the noises that came out of those pretty little mouth and Draco was happy with what he is receiving.
Dracy gulped. Thinking the way how serious his tone was with a hint of gloominess in it. Dracy wiped her eyes and pouted sadly. Is everything ruined?
He didn’t know how he got himself here. He didn’t understand why he is where he is right now. After all, the last few bits of what happened began to be hazy, a fog digging through his memories, layering what reality is there outside of those door locked. Separating him out of the life outside.
He admired the courage she showed last week. The way she could easily forgive her father and settling things with the man even Harry had trouble recognizing. She was able to let go of her past so easily, unlike him that obviously took decades.
“Hmm” Draco tilted his head and tucked it in Harry’s neck, exhausted and just wanted to rest.
He removed his eyeglasses and carelessly tossed it on the desk and closed his eyes. From his heightened senses, he can faintly smell Dracy’s scent. And it’s stirring him up more. His rut is going to come hours earlier if this continues but if he calls her now, his rut can immediately arrive.
He sobbed, “I love you”
Did McGonagall said anything about the pearl dust being potent? He feels as if the Headmistress is not telling them something. The her eyes lingered felt secretive and Harry have enough of secretive people. From his past experiences, they rarely end well.
Her eyes rolled back and her chest heaved. She’s going to faint. It’s all so good. The way his tongue delved in and fucked her slowly but sensually, she shivered.
Harry nodded.
What is happening? This must be a dream. She shouted at him last night and she was pretty sure it might take days before Harry decides to return.
Draco raised an eyebrow. That isn't what he wants to see right now. He played with his fingers around his hair and boldly stepped forward, minding the way his hips sway enticingly side to side, his steps languid as his heels clacked to the floor, “You can very well do things to me—I mean, for me, Senator” he winked, leaning on the desk,
His voice soft, supple but grounding. His tone husky and hoarse but reigning. He let the ashes fall down the ground as he stretched his arm. He did not expect the order and certainly did not expect the word after.
. He cursed. Slumping down beside Draco, not even acknowledging when he carefully pulled a fraction of the blanket to his thighs. He watched his friends having fun near the lake.
of the month is the day we got married so we’re going to celebrate!”
“Settle down, settle down”
“Can we come in?” Blaise asked though he didn’t bother waiting for an answer, he shoved Draco to the side and stepped in. Pansy shrugged at him and followed.
She fucked up. She’s messing up. Harry will hate her like how everybody hates her family. The family she refuses to acknowledge she’s in anymore. She’s Harry’s now, right? Right? It’s better.
Harry sat behind Draco and settled him between his thighs, hugging him by the waist with one hand to pull him closer as the other went to splay his thighs wide open.
He eyed their joined hands, squinting when he noticed how small his was compared to Harry’s. Hmm, that’s a discovery.
His nails raked through Harry’s collar and waited until he bottomed out, “D-daddy, feel so full”
“It’s not that” he started, eyes focused on their joined hands, “I do”
She’d never had one person touched and take her like this before.
” he yelped when Harry suddenly took his cock on his hand, pumping it up and down slowly. His cheeks blushing a deep red.
“Patience, my love. We gotta take this slow at first” harry whispered, “Then I’m going to stretch you good then fuck you out here in the open. I’ll be as rough as you want me to, as long as you want me to”
That’s what he sees as Harry walked in to his office to see that particularly glorious sight of round globes, clad with a pink leather skirt that’s surprisingly deemed appropriate. That swell that Harry would love to feel on his palms, he knew he’s every bit of the definition of what could be referred to as an Omega hunter.
Right. Harry Potter. A big no and yes.
“Kitten” his husband spoke, taking his attention away from admiring his muscled torso. Even at their age, Remus is still the most beautiful.
Yeah, probably it’s still better to spread hate than love.
He had blow dried his hair, put on some light blush and lipstick. He grabbed his tight leather pants that accentuates his buttocks and a simple pink crop top before grabbing his pumps. He smiled seductively and laughed.
“We got this, cutie” Fred winked at him, “I miss my part time job” George added, rolling his shoulders to ease his exhaustion.
“I’m coming, doll. Fuck, fuck, I’m coming”
“Hmm” Harry hummed, bouncing him on his hardening member and as Draco sort any kind of friction, his head fell back with a thud, eyes rolling at the back of his head, dizzy with sensations, driving himself crazy with desire.
But Harry’s different. He’s different. He’s cryptic and unreadable. He’s calm, collected, and too private to easily crack. He’s unreadable and mysterious. She cannot see what’s in the eyes but she can see the reflection of the depths within it. The depths where his story lies.
He took a deep breath and in swift motion stood on his tiptoes and kissed Harry full on the lips.
Damn. Yeah, yeah. He doesn’t drink coffee. He’s a tea person.
“Get your ass in here, Sirius!”
He felt his insides melting when Harry turned around and caught sight of him. Smiling at how he caught him staring, he waved a hand and Draco waves back.
He cleared his throat, coming back from his stupor upon the sight of that cute color that tainted her supple cheeks. He took a sip of his water and turned his attention to his plate.
“Do you want anything, sir? Breakfast? Water? Coffee? Cupcakes?”
“Ye know we can bet on friendly Quidditch match with the Hufflepuffs. Just some warm up game before yer next match with the Slytherins next week” Seamus broke the silence, wiggling his eyebrows at Harry.
He gasped and closed his eyes involuntarily when he felt those familiar lips nipping on his skin with no care in the world, not even for the people around them who’s too busy flashing jewelries and wealth to one another.
The days, the nights, the moments they made. They were all beautiful.
Draco, who despite the haziness in his mind, smiled. Finally. Finally. He felt Harry’s finger exploring his insides slowly, pumping it up and down and curling it in the right way. So good. He keened.
He gulped once more.
Seriously, why do people brand him as this playboy when he’s obviously not? He’s just built like this.
He may not have the ability to turn water into wine but surely know how to turn him into a pudding. What he lacks in romance makes up to his talent in bed, figuratively sure. He can also rail in walls, kitchen counters, dining tables, couch, balcony, and their favorite, Harry’s motorbike. All those vibrations as Harry rolls the throttle, followed by the sound that inspired their name
“Harry” he called gently, hands trying to grab onto him to get and feel his warmth back. He didn’t know why he needed it but he just felt it. Because in his books, this isn’t how sex is supposed to go.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t hear your bikes” he mumbled.
She looked back and gasped when she saw him staring intently before completely disappearing from view.
It wasn’t by fate or someone else taking control from him. No, this time it’s all a matter of personal decision. It was a matter of his own mind, body, and soul taking over what other people have been controlling.
He took a deep breath as the classes finished, his steps falling back as he noticed the way Draco slacked behind.
Draco crossed his arms. Ignoring the name he heard. He knows the Potters. He had heard the House Of Potter's brilliance , yes but who would actually need rumors in their lives? Not him.
that Draco allowed himself a bit of the delusion.
“Please”
“Ha-harry, come inside”
He bit his lips as they walked to the car. There was still the apparent mischief in his eyes but it had faltered a bit when he saw how tense Harry’s shoulders are and how tight he was holding his wrist.
Opening one eye, he looked at his surroundings.
Harry Potter has been his boyfriend for eight months running. The man is ethereal carved into marble then given life. He’s built like no other and tall like a tower. He looks so strong and so defined, well-built and has such a delicious five o’clock shadow.
Relief washed over Draco’s painful erection as he let himself go. Body shaking as he let out spurts of cum to his stomach, Harry’s abdomen, to the sheets below them. His mind rang with nonsense as his frame sagged from exhaustion.
Harry’s eyes glanced at Malfoy who was fixing some ingredients on their brewing station silently, head bowed a little. He sighed and decided to approach him, “Guess we’re partners”
Draco perked up, “Thank Merlin you realized, Potter. Alright, I’m owling St. Mungos”
wait, no.
She caught sight of the smirk that escaped Harry’s lips. Apparently, noticing the reaction he got by the use of the pet name. He pulled his finger out and Dracy blushed once again when Harry took that particular finger in his own mouth.
“How does that work?” Harry asked relentlessly. Unlike Ginny, he do need answers. He promised Draco that, "How will it work?"
He just now realized how idiotic he was back downstairs. Fuck.
Harry looked at Ron and shook his head, “It’s lunch time, Wonwon. See you next generation”
Pansy blinked, “Thanks for the unnecessary update, darling”
Draco’s heightened sensitivity weakened him. He pulled his head back and looked up at Harry with his dazed eyes, “Daddy, please—
Dracy cried out at the feel of his wet tongue licking at her nipple. It was all too stimulating and only if she can find the energy, she knew she would’ve been humping on the bed right now. The itch was still there but as Harry proceeded to intentionally scratch his beard on her nipple, she gasp and trembled.
Draco needs to know his work out routine, the gym where Harry exercises and the bench he lied in. He needs to straddle this man asap.
After all of those were done, Harry apparated away. Not to go back to the house but to somewhere. He had not expected how fast it could get. Their visit to Diagon Alley was completely blown away and got out of hand.
When there was no answer, she turned around and gasped at what she saw.
“W-what are you doing?” he asked, ignoring the way he stammered at the beginning.
He cracked then. He exploded and he kissed him. He kissed him so hard, he tastes the young blood and fucking hell.
He cannot remember what happened vividly but he’s sure of one thing. The asshole that did this ruined his fucking date with the man he hates. The kisses he’s possible to get!
Harry watched him when he began to walk away, his eyes settling at that ass. Fuck that ass.
Deciding to do it now or never, Harry sighed— they cannot keep on walking eggshells and avoiding issues. If they want answers, they’re going to get it, “Why are you always saying that? Wrackspurts and blibbering humdingers?”
“Honey, why did you do that?” Pansy avoided beating around the bush as she settled beside her co-biker, eyes looking at her manicured nails, “But just so you know, I’m not here to comfort. I’m here to judge”
“What now?” he asked, careful to control how he acts. He cannot impulsively and recklessly act in front of the Alpha who has all the qualities to fuck an omega’s brain out.
Draco took a sip of his wine and decided to up his game, tilting his head to the side, he stretched his foot and twirled the tip of his foot on Harry’s. He winked as Harry stopped and stared at him, emerald eyes all innocent as he looked around.
She watched him dived in, kissing her nape, the back of her head, to each side of her shoulders. Lips dragging carefully at her skin as his nose inhaled her scent. She gasp when Harry found a particular sensitive spot on her neck and began to nibble on it, teasing and pulling at the skin.
Harry finished his song and waited until he can feel Draco's breath has evened out before he slept as well.
He kissed him on his shoulder, the hand that was hugging him by the waist, held Draco by the side of his head and gently urged his boyfriend to turn his head and look at him.
glinting with cryptic purpose. Majestic stance and bulging muscles, rigid and toned. But there was also a hint of soft glow in his expression, something that did not exist back where he first saw him.
"It's amazing how you became a Head Auror with your age. Usually Head Aurors are aged mid forties or late thirties. But you? Wow" Draco complimented easily. His face obvious of amazement.
“Mate, relax” Ron’s voice rang through the air, noticing how hard Harry was gripping the glass.
Which he should be disgusted at. He’s sure of that.
“Tell me when you can” Harry kissed her shoulder and resumed eating.
Draco’s forehead furrowed. Didn’t he read that?
His wife staggered for a bit and he held her tightly by the waist before turning to look around.
“How are you feeling?” he asked gently, one had cradling his waist to help him up while the other cupped his jaw and caressed his skin.
“Alright. We’re good to go. I just had to ask those so I’ll know what procedure I would take to check on the child. Please, this way” she stood up and lead the way and that’s when Dracy noticed the a door inside the office. When they got inside, they saw a hospital bed that looked so comfortable to lie in. Now, she’s wishing to get some sleep.
He gritted his teeth, hands gripping the armchairs. What the hell did he just hear?! He cannot be! Of course he cannot be!
"Harry" Draco tested the name in his tongue, letting both of his hands fall on his side.
Remus grinned, “Come here” he said, chuckling when Sirius was fast to crawl on his knees until he was close for Remus to touch.
“Come for me, baby girl. Come on. Wanna see you clench on my hand. You’re being so good” he murmured huskily before returning on his earlier actions.
“Baby—
. Draco assessed himself, eyes widening at the thought. He’s feeling good? He’s feeling good?
Everyone in their branch calls him handsome, gorgeous, sexy, good sir. But Draco calls him asshole, jerk, sweaty armpits, muscled banana, untasty loaf of bread. His blood boils to unimaginable temperature, his mind rattles to stab, and his heart hammers like a collapsing building.
Harry smirked and looked at their colleagues slash friends slash annoying piece of asses. Right after the phone call, his worries have turned into fun excitement.
Enjoying each other’s company, sharing lovely kisses, their own
He shook his head to try to control himself and sat back on his knees, opening his trousers and zipping it down to pull his raging hard cock free from its confines.
Easy is what he expected. Who would resist him? Certainly not the well-known goody two shoes Senator of New York, right?
The words wrecked every cell in his brain, it messed with him worse than the clashing of whats and hows.
If only he could pass this to Kingsley then they’re done before he couldn't risk goodness to Harry.
He wouldn’t say he’s avoiding the talk of marking because he didn’t want to but because he wanted that conversation all between him and her only. It’s such a personal subject he wouldn’t want others trying to butt in.
James nodded, “What work do you need me for?”
Maybe massage is not a good idea. A fuck is what he can call a good idea.
Draco sighed and regarded him for moment. He looked like he wants to say something but decided not to. Harry wanted to say something too, wanted to tell him that what happened last night was a mistake but also decided not to so he apparated to the Ministry.
Draco raised an eyebrow and crossed his arms, “My weekly massage is every Saturday”
He was about to continue thinking about how to start when he heard the floo activating and he perked up.
“I’m a freelance photographer travelling from New York to Seattle when there’s a gig. And my husband’s a journalist for the local newspaper”
He was stuck with your pissy face heartthrob, Harry Potter.
His mouth parted open as a hand gripped his throat, gripping loosely, gradually tightening it as moans flew out of Draco’s mouth. Mumbling out scattered incoherent noises as he fought the urge not to close his eyes.
Harry chuckled, messing the ribbons with Ginny, carelessly tossing Christmas balls now and then.
As they were locked within an arms length inside the bedroom, Harry did not even had the chance to look around as his back came contact with the wall and Malfoy’s barreled roughly on the bed.
“How are things with you, mate?” Ron asked as they eat their lunch in his office.
Alright, let’s get the magic working.
But it was nothing but unyielding lies after lies as one look, one mere look in those emerald stares, he deferred.
Remus smiled, nothing like the seriousness back at the dining. His hands continued its way up to his neck, choking him in a way his cock leaked some more.
Blaise who seemingly was the only one who could get his point grinned, “Nothing like yours, of course”
He pulled Harry on the bar counter, not missing the way the man grimaced while looking around and dejectedly sat down on the stool, “Iced tea”
He took a deep breath before speaking, "What are you doing?"
The woman smiled, “It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am Lily Potter and this is my husband, James Potter”
Harry blinked and gripped his seat tight as he watched Draco turned around so his ass is facing Zayan and it took every ounce of invisible restraints for Harry so he wouldn't storm and kill the mood.
“Silence, Draco” his father interrupted, voice cold and dark that immediately shut Draco up. He huffed and leaned on the chair, crossing his arms in the process and glared at the desk.
Tom snarled and was about to go attack him when Harry grabbed the collar of his shirt and delivered one strong punch to the face, followed by a kick on his stomach.
Draco sat down behind him and looked down. He shook his head for all the mess though he didn’t complain. Apparently, this is what the Roaring Lions have been so busy doing.
Draco was swaying his hips erotically on the center stage. Spotlight cascading over his figure as if it was a part of who he was in the stripper club he is working at. His body is encased in a little to nothing lace thong that merely covered his most private area out of public view.
Perhaps he really do need an Auror.
“Ready?”
“I heard we’ll be stayin’ at different tower. Us eight years. Merlin, even the Slytherins’ will be with us. It'll be fun, don't ye think?” Seamus shared.
She bit her lips, already sobbing like crazy.
She smiled, “Harry?”
Harry was waiting for him outside with a smile and as they drove away to get to the intersection where all the others are waiting for them, he smiled sincerely.
Dracy didn’t answer to that as she lowered her eyes, seeking more comfort from her Alpha. She contemplated on her own thoughts, weighed what to say—if there’s nothing to say at all.
Dracy felt her cheeks warmed. She had experience with men gawking at her in the bedroom but none were as bold and intense as Harry was doing with simple fucking words. It does all things unimaginable to her and she had the sudden desire to ride him all night.
Harry shrugged and took a seat on the guest chair since Ron already took his Head Auror chair, “Nothing. Anyway, you look good in that Head Auror chair”
“Draco Malfoy?” the voice was low and deep, with precise calculation and Draco bit his lip by the roughness of his tone. Just the voice itself woke something inside him. Something a bit primal, a need that he didn’t know was even there.
He held her by the back of her knees and pushed it forward to her chest as he began to fuck her. He pulled back before pounding back inside her velvet flesh, gripping him and milking his cock.
Draco gulped. Harry was so close. If what happened was wrong, what is it he’s doing now?
Harry closed his eyes. Trying to do what his mind keeps on telling him to. But hell, he fucking cannot. His hands tightened around the young boy.
“If you don’t fix this mess, we’ll see if you get to fuck another omega tonight”
Things are carefully put in their designated places and even though it was obvious that the whole place still lacks complete supply of furniture and other necessities, Dracy was already envisioning the place to be so perfect.
“Shall we, dollface?”
Draco raised an eyebrow at him. What is this man thinking now?
He took a sharp inhale. He needs to because all he can think of is kissing the enemy. His supposed enemy!
He refused to turn around to look as the door opened, followed by light but stern footsteps, filling the air of silence. Draco fought the urge to gasp as his nose caught a whisk of the strong smell invading his senses. A light scent of seabreeze, luscious whiskey, and something like cinnamon?
Something that Harry did not quite agree with. If Draco is consumed with boredom then Harry is full of wrong urges and indecent thoughts because Draco's position caused his robes to have a small hole he can take a peek in.
“Ron will take care of that. Kingsley knows I am taking my vacation” Harry stated, eyes turning to his friends to find that soft expression on Hermione’s eyes and a nice smile from Ron’s face.
Maybe he's really not so innocent.
His little tiger.
Being bestfriends with Prongs for years and having been beside him witnessing all the family matters he had to deal including his businesses scattered all over the country, he knows how the Potter couple works. They aren’t Lily and James on the field but Mr. And Mrs. Potter, two sides of the same coin.
“Hey, Mrs. Barnes” she winked, taking the laptop and documents from him, “I heard about the bet”
“You’ve been crying. What’s wrong?”
“I know this isn’t the most romantic of all, angel” he smiled apologetically, “But I saw this from the jewelry shop and I immediately thought of you and I”
He felt his mind swirling through different emotions at the same time.
Well, maybe he’s good to stay still.
“I’m here to see  OB Andy” he informed and the woman immediately smiled and nodded.
“I apologize driving you to boredom, Mr. Malfoy” he whispered courteously, "I had to take some important call and reschedule some meeting”
She nodded, watching as Harry give her a kiss on the forehead before going to approached the door.
“H-harry?” she hesitated because she wasn’t sure whether it’s alright for her to ask what’s happening.
“I just came in near Knockturn Alley last week” he answered.
In silence, he moved smoothly. His palm reached her wrist to her hand, unclenching it from gripping her dress too tight. He closed it at the back of her hand and lifted their conjoined hands to lay below her breast while his other hand slid to hug her waist.
“Daddy!”
“Sir!”
Harry pump his hand up and down his shaft, thumb caressing his leaking slit before coating his cock with his precum,.
He pecked a kiss on the tip of his nose before lifting him by encircling his arms on his waist. Draco smiled as he wounded his legs tights to Harry’s waist in return, hands holding Harry by his nape tightly and leaning his forehead to his.
Dracy assured him that it didn’t bother her that much and only because Harry was beside her, holding her, shamelessly kissing her head to prove whatever it is he was trying to prove. After that, they flooed back home and had a nice day and sweet dinner.
He can depend on his own now that he is good as a legal one.
He moaned. Even little licks and kisses, Draco felt like releasing. That excellent mouth that did nothing but prove how magnificent he can be and that scratch of his beard that tickles but at the same time, lightly stabs his skin. He cannot help but to arch his back a little, whining as white spots intruded his dark vision beneath his closed eyes.
He never stayed.
If you can just see how squishy those ass is, you'll understand why Harry had to restrain himself so fucking tight so he wouldn't jump to the small form and squeeze every sound he can.
Harry bucked his hips at his and Draco keened. Fuck. That felt so good. More, he wanted more.
“You’re mine, Draco” he whispered possessively, “Fucking hell. You’re so fucking tight, so beautiful. Tell me who owns you”
“Daddy, please,
“It’s lunch time”
"You didn't answer my question, Harry. Are you, by any chance, courting someone?" Draco repeated his questions hours earlier.
It’s something he should consider with in-depth thoughts. It’s not just about marking an omega, it’s being with each other for all days in the future. Suspending or trying to cut of bonding is a long process and can be really really hurtful. That’s according to some testimonies he had heard over the halls of St. Mungos by crying omegas who were claiming their Alpha is not responding to them with how they wanted.
“Get the fuck out!” he exclaimed and tried to push Harry out but as his palms landed on that rigid chest, he found out how much strength it holds and
It wasn’t.
“Please? Just lunch. To clarify, completely platonic but I could do romantic if you want to” he winked. He’s aware his moves are all rusty when it comes to Draco but it’s all worth the try.
There was silence and Draco thought Harry doesn’t have any idea what to say but then, he spoke, “I know you, dove. So, win then get what you want from me”
"Is that how wizards act? Too poised?"
Turning his body to face Luke, he raised a hand and touched his biceps, “You come here often Luke?”
“No touching yourself, tiger. Behave, hmm?” he mumbled and when Dracy nodded, he chuckled more so to calm him down especially when he felt his cock gave a throb.
What kind of emergency have he gone to? He’s been gone all day and he didn’t even wake Draco up to tell him where he is going.
“Headache?” Harry said and walked over to his side, Draco has to look away so he wouldn’t look at the mountain of muscles but turned his head back when he felt something on his arms. He saw a vial of potion.
“Ooh. A-alpha, faster”
“Please Harry” he sobbed and a tear rolled down his cheek.
Another song drop. The last one for his shift and as he turned around, gave a seductive glance to the audience, his breath hitched.
As he stepped inside his pub, he was filled by noises. Harry’s gang were at the two pool tables and betting on a game they were having. Ginny was currently playing with her peculiar girlfriend, Luna.
She let Harry order for her as she literally glued her stare at the table. The next minute that she was silent, Harry’s hand rested on top of her thighs before giving it a comforting squeeze, “Are you alright?”
Fuck. So good. Not better as daddy’s dick though.
. That's really the only thing keeping him going right now.
he needed his cock so much,
It was her scent. Damn it.
“What now, dumb fool?”
He gulped, fighting a whimper in his throat. His hands scramble to steady himself causing is palms to land on Harry’s chest and it was strong, too strong. He stumbled back and spluttered.
Disaster.
Harry was patient to walk in her pace considering the huge baby bump on her and the way she can literally feel her milk at the bra she’s wearing. Maybe it would’ve been better if she asked to go back and Harry can just help her out a bit?
He’s acting all this mighty as if his sudden disappearance without a proper explanation is okay. Huh! Harry must think he’s easy!
She glanced at him when he sat down before offering a hand, “Come here”
How is this the same person he used to bicker with? They’re both different now. Both different growing adults that managed to fit with each other amidst whatever conflict they may have had. Despite their irregularities, it was somehow so right to have him
It came out as a surprise when it was Harry who asked the need to do a little shopping spree for their little beanie and promised to take care of her if the public would be too much for her.
Harry’s team is winning by fifty points as he fly around, trying to get a sight of the snitch.
“Harry, please” she arched her back carefully, for as long as her tummy can let her and Harry brushed his thumb to her cheeks fist before sliding her bra up and immediately latching his mouth on her pebbled nipples while he pinched the other between his fingers.
When Harry put another finger in and began to pushed his fingers deeper, the tip reaching at that spot, she cannot help but rolled her eyes back, legs beginning to quiver as she struggled on her feet but Harry easily supported her.
She yelped when he scooped her up in his arms and carried her to the bathtub. He settled her down nicely before he began to tear his clothes off of his body. Dracy sighed, finally she gets to stare at all those muscles hugging his upper body and that view of his hard cock, wanting attention but her view disappeared as Harry joined her, thighs spread apart to accommodate her in between.
“No, Luna. I’m asking why you’re telling me this?”
He took his time. Hands peeling his jacket off and removing his waistcoast after until he’s left of his sleeves, ties and trousers.
There were no rumors upon their visit to St. Mungos, even from the people that saw them so she was grateful for that. Even if she’s sure that Harry will really take care of her, she wouldn’t like to be at front of gossip again. Especially when it’s just to talk bad about her and would speculate things.
"Bloody hell. I should've check it twice" Draco pouted, playing it cool and fighting a smile. He walk towards the door before finally smiling at Harry.
“You’re handsome yourself, ‘arry” she mumbled and Harry burst in pride with the kind of name she was calling him for months now. It sounded so cute, so pure between her lips. It was as if he was a whole different person when it comes to her but at the same time, still the same.
“Nice to meet such a lovely secretary”
But he realized, he doesn’t need to. He can be who he is without changing anything. Because if people have a problem with it, it’s their issue. He took what courage he have in his room and walked up to his parents, wanting to be bared by himself before others do it for him.
He sighed and within minutes, Harry set him down, chuckling when Draco’s feet gave in.
“Baby boy”
He danced like how a medieval witch on fire would. He looked away when he smirked, he closed his eyes when he laughed. He tried to avoid, tried to run, tried to keep things casual.
“I’m touching you”
She doesn’t know if Harry is okay with this or not because he’s not giving anything away. He doesn’t look mad but he’s not smiling either. But the silence is making her more nervous. She needs him to say something. Tell her what he thinks or how he feels about this but no matter what he gives her, acceptance or denials, she will not abandon this pregnancy and she will do everything to push through this.
He looked at the wall and sighed for several times.
After all, he’s the fianceé.
Maybe he doesn’t need to go to Gaydar. There’s fun right here.
Dracy moaned at the glint on the alpha’s eyes. They were almost dark but never scary. She was instantly wet at the sound of his voice and the unrelenting hands that touched her wherever it could.
He was rather handsome on the mornings and Draco would never admit it out loud but he’s ready to hump him on there. That sweats he wore that hung low on his hips, allowing him a peak of a little bit of his butt. Yeah, this motherfucker is as bold as Microsoft word function. And he was drooling like a toddler.
Give control or walk away.
Harry can feel the excitement surging in but also the desire to quicken things up. Ravage her in a way she doesn’t even know she wants but he does.
Draco felt himself hardening and he sobbed and buried his head in Harry’s neck, “Ha-harry, please”
“Let Daddy take care of you. Daddy will spoil you, baby. You don’t need to do anything” Harry looked at him in the eyes and smiled as Draco stopped and nodded, nibbling on lips, “Sorry, daddy”
"If you plan to host parties here, it should only be until six in—
“Shall we get to the business, Mr. Cockybee?” Draco cut him off. Again. Like he always do when Harry starts to flirt while working. A gorgoues cockblocker.
He frowned, wanting to leave already before he disrespects his parents once again.
“You left without even informing Dobby. What if something happened?”
He laid a hand on top of hers and scooting closer, “Hey, little bean”
The owner of the bar made an unbreakable vow with him, never to tell a thing. He doesn’t fancy people bombarding him questions. His private life which consists of  his life and Dracy from now on should be left alone. Away from cameras, papers, gossips.
“Sleep well, omega” Harry whispered, giving one last kiss on her neck and inhaled deeply.
“Fuck, you smell amazing” Harry complimented her, his fingers started to play with her pussy lips, “And already so wet”
Shit. Is things about to go down? Is there some street race happening?
He turned his back when saw the a light and he was glued to his spot when he noticed motorbikes coming on his way. He cannot really see who they are even when they weren’t wearing any helmets because of all the lights invading his line of sight.
He gulped. Letting himself get pulled as his mind began to float away to another dimension wherein he wouldn’t get these strange thoughts because there’s just no fucking way.
Dracy moaned, one of her hands gripping his head tight while the other held at the couch for support. Her legs began to feel like jelly and seemed as if she have no energy to keep up with his pace.
Draco smiled and began to walk ahead. Harry followed and once again found himself looking at the ass he's beginning to be obsessed with.
Except it was, surprisingly, actually Harry having his way with him.
“Yes, signs of old age”
“I’m a Malfoy and I’m p-pregnant. If the public sees me—
“Alpha” she whispered.
"We'll see" Harry answered and chew on his food. "Anything more?"
The way those hands will grope her like no other and softly cradle her stomach after, not failing to coo at it and kisses all over the part. She remembered she was giggling before they both let sleep take them, in the arms of each other.
“So good, kitten. Always so good for me”
Draco perked up, “It’s his fault! I told him to juice some squill bulb and he got some pearl dust!”
That got Harry’s attention as he pulled away, settling Draco on his feet and turned to look.
He shoved her bra up, not bothering to remove it from her body as he lavished her perky nipple with attention. His mind imagining that day it’ll be so full of milk. He groaned at the idea, matching Dracy’s moans.
“I noticed Mr. Malfoy and you are getting along quite well” she pointed out. There it is. The talk that should be talked about.
It’s him Harry can refer he comes home to. The reason this small town is still worthy to be called his home. The purpose that Harry intends to always keep and he, in Harry’s words, his angel. He doesn’t know how Harry can see in that way. It’s obvious he doesn’t have wings nor this soft glow that hugs his presence.
Dracy woke up smelling bacon, milk, and chocolates.
“Pansy! Answer me! Come on!” he called tirelessly.
The night ended with the both of them agreeing they have suspicions against the man and for once, have come to an agreement they have to discover the truth sooner or later. Though there’s a stinging sensation at the back of his head wishing for this to take
“To who? I’m engaged to who? Alden Pire? Or was it the Spanish chick we saw at Molly’s restaurant? Or was it the French heir I just made an acquaintance?”
She bit her lips and sighed, fiddling with her fingers and continuously trying to ask Hermione if she knows anything. But she would easily say no and go back to what she is doing. Read.
They knew where Tom lives. Just across the apartment complex they are in. Their spot carefully picked out for spying.
He sighed, “Just… what are you doing?”
“What are you doing here?” he asked, taking his coat off and loosening his tie. He has to finish some papers today if he wishes to get on a vacation and take some time off work.
Dracy nibbled on her lips and looked around. Trying to think of a place she wants to visit in but contemplated when she met the eyes.
Well, Harry can adjust.
He’s just not built like that.
“Maybe you were right” he paused and his smile widened, “Why don’t I take you out for lunch? Maybe to some nice Italian?”
Breathe. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat the process. Count. Calm down.
Her jaw dropped, “We’re at France?!”
He knows because he always experienced that when he's a kid and even just two years ago. Old men who did nothing but shout at him if he so much as step a foot outside. He really hates that and really just had to endure because he wasn't of age back then but now that he is, he can do whatever he wants and follow his decisions.
The fact that it's Lovegood creeping out of nowhere freaks him more than anyone.
He closed his eyes and stopped on his tracks. She smelled so sweet, sweeter than usual and even from their distance, he can feel her needs and he so wanted to fill it, sate the poor omega but he also wanted to turn his back and ran away.
“Fuck, sweetheart. Clenching around me tight. So fucking,
Harry can climb up, can find his own way inside without any preambles but he didn’t want to scare him and lose potential chances of talking to him.
Harry had noticed it too and would smile whenever he catches her doing it. To see her going all mama bear even when there’s no harm around, he feels his heart fluttering at the thought of her being such an amazing mother.
For the first time ever, Luna smiled at him genuinely. The kind that radiates sunshine and sincere enthusiasm as her eyes glinted with a meaning, “That’s Ginny, Harry”
As much as he was confused and angered by his presence that he sometimes considers mighty, he knows if anything’s going sideways, Harry makes a good shield.
Draco scowled, “This is another reason why I want to slap you. You think of nothing but sex”
“I’m Harry by the way” he introduced, “Harry Potter”
“Ahh. A-alpha, please, ahh, harder” he lifted his hips up to meet Harry’s pounding as he began to feel that familiar tightening of his balls.
harder” he mewled, his wrist slightly painful for having to tug on it a little too much but also needing a bit more.
This time Dracy raised her head to look at him, slightly looking sympathetic.
He was about to take another step and hurry home when he heard that.
Harry met her eyes and smiled softly, his thumb unconsciously rubbing at her belly. When finally, they reached their designated floor, they stepped out. Immediately greeted by the front desk and a woman in uniform.
Two words, fucking bullshit.
“So beautiful for me like always. Eyes cannot stop staring at my huge thick cock, mouth shamelessly taking me. You were so wet then like you are now. So desperate, begging me to take you in that nearest classroom”
“Take the sobering potion and go to sleep” he willed his tone to be stern and used the one he had used to lecture the Aurors who messed up on their missions.
“You look beautiful” he complimented blushing.
“More, daddy” he moaned out. Harry gave him what he wanted and inserted another finger all the while sucking him off. He missed to see the way Harry’s cheeks hollowed because his eyes remained closed, his hands not knowing where to exactly hold onto.
He wants to feel that rough hands choking him, groping him elsewhere, touching him sexually, kissing him slowly, and then fuck him fastly. In his sheets, in the guest room Harry will be staying in and hell, even in the attic, it's fine.
Draco smiled. He’d forgiven Harry already. Hearing his statement, he realized he may have acted like a brat too. Demanding and pushing while forgetting to see it in Harry’s shoes but now he do.
“Blimey, you’ve grown! So, all alone? Where’s the lovebirds?” Seamus grinned, looking around the Great Hall as it settled down after the sorting and Headmistress McGonagall’s welcome speech.
and firm. All power displayed visibly as it echoed through his being, shooting tingling sparks to his stomach down to his cock.
“That’s a sight we could get use to” Seamus winked at them playfully, hands gesturing to their hands.
It wasn’t long before the younger years were dismissed to retire on their bed and eight years asked to stay back. Counting from the heads Harry can see, he reckoned there were at least 19 who came back to finish their studies.
“Draco” his voice turned low, “What happened was wrong”
She behaved almost instantly. She fidgeted with her fingers as she watched Harry took his tie off and rolled it in his left hand before unbuttoning his sleeves, throwing it haphazardly on the floor after. He was left on his trousers with an obvious tent in it and she let a whimper out at the size of his cock. It’s huge. Fuck, the image of it filling her up. She spoke without a thought, “
“Harry?”
Draco got to work and removed his clothes, careful not to tear the material as his fingers tremble in fear, eagerness, elation or whatnot. He can feel the burning desire beginning to send him into a delirium, the one that signs as confusing kind of goodness.
Is it morning already?
Fuck. Fuck. Draco arched his back as he raised his legs to hug around Harry’s thighs. His hands slid down and gripped Harry’s muscled butt and pinched onto the flesh.
“Are you going to be my good boy now, baby? I want you to be my good boy” he whispered and his eyes flashed dangerously when Draco didn’t answer.
He refused to step inside and called out to him, “Draco”
Harry never shares. That’s one of the not so many things she knows about the man. Whatever available is out there, he gets it. How can Dracy be an exception?
At some point, Draco may have felt good with it. Good like c’mon, Harry is attraction itself. He may or may not have fantasize him in bed when Harry’s away with his gang shit. May have reminisced the days he took his huge cock and blew him off wonderfully.
woman makes her even cooler. It’s no wonder Ginny fell hard for her.
“Alright, Mr. Romantic. 50 galleons but if he’s really worth it, maybe you can top it up to 150 galleons”
Draco bit his lips, moaning at the sound of Harry’s cold and husky voice. It turned him on, how sexy Harry can be when he’s all riled up like this. Jealous, possessive, and all stingy to share. The eyes watching him, silently restricting him of doing anything other than to stand and listen. His hands choking him in a way Draco did not expect he’ll find so hot. So absolutely hot.
Harry laughed before relenting, taking his wand out he pointed it straight and saying a spell Draco did not follow.
“Carry me” he whispered, wanting to feel his skin to his, his warmth when Draco gets clingy.
She sighed. She had lost the confidence that was once glowing in her and Harry, the Alpha that can get anything he wants, decided to have her and took her out from that dirty place she used to be in.
For Dracy, it was starting to get impossibly wonderful and beautiful. It’s just that Harry doesn’t only possess a huge cock and amazing musky smell that appears whenever he lets the Alpha take over but there’s a whole new outlook she discovered as the days go by.
“Or touch you like this?” Harry asked and gripped his jaw in quick motion where Draco gasped once again, startled by how fast Harry is with his hand. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
She was about to walk away to hug Neville a Merry Christmas when Harry spoke, “W-what do you mean?”
Harry who was still looking petrified frowned, “What the fuck. I think I just lost my appetite for the next ten years. Centaur’s piss. What the fuck! No one hears this, alright? No one!”
“Have to fix you up, darling” harry whispered, letting the smaller one lean on him as he fixed his lace panties, pulled his jeans up and tucked his own softening cock after.
Draco followed even when he wanted to lick his abdomen way up to his rigid pecs. He sighed softly loving the feeling of soft silk beneath him.
Gryffindor” there was a hesitation in his voice, not sure if the words are proper at the moment.
Harry held his hands up and laughed, “Relax. I’m not going to touch you, sweetling—
He wasn’t listening, letting his mind fly outside the classroom but his attention shifted when he thought he heard another shocking thing.
Professor McGonagall had given the eight years an everyday ticket to Hogsmeade with no curfew— supposing a gift the Headmistress decided to give them.
He heard Draco sobbed and then the rustle of his sheets as if he was standing up which Harry quickly tried to avoid, “Why did you leave last night?”
He thought that maybe, maybe Harry was just wondering the right time when to pop the question,
Dracy leaned at him and moaned, “H-harry”
“ehem” but chihuahua just had to butt in like a tadpole that he is.
The silence that followed once more was predictable for a reaction. But the nonchalant expression on their faces threw Harry off a bit. He always hated being left alone in the dark, he had to know something or he will lose his shit.
When he went downstairs, he saw Draco in the living room who raised an eyebrow and looked at him from head to toe, “You’re only supposed to go to the Ministry every Wednesday and it’s Sunday. It’s weekend, Harry.”
“I know. Come on, follow me” Sirius began to walk as if he owned the place. The both of them following behind him.
This must be a mistake!
He wants to kiss him again and feel the fireworks that erupts in his chest whenever he does so. There’s just something utterly beguiling in him Harry finds not adventurous and not needing explorations. It felt like it needed something more constant, a realistic endeavor— to
He rolled his eyes, dramatic as always. He can handle this if anyone just asks. Whoever kidnapped him will taste the atrocious dose of their own medicine.
“When you shouted at me last night, I realized what I have done to you. And you asked me who even I am”
“Please,
“ENOUGH!” Harry exploded.
Harry inhaled and exhaled deeply. Reminding himself to remain calm. He didn’t speak and let the silence reign for a moment. Giving themselves an enough time to calm himself down.
No one says no to him. No one. Not even seduction itself. He is good and he will prove to his father he can do this.
In the world of politics and business, seduction is one hell of a key. It’s a tactic for espionage, for corruption, for things illegal and for sins to blow over like hurricanes.
It's just been hours but a lot of things have happened already. He just owled Sirius a letter and maybe he still hasn't received the letter yet. He badly needs his godfather's words because fuck.
Draco raised a hand and it was him who hold Harry by the cheeks, he smiled and brush a strand of his infamous rat’s nest away from his forehead, his fingers caressed the scar.
A mad Draco is very sexy too. Makes him want to rut on him but well, he knows how Draco goes with his ‘horny’ ways. What could he tell? He’s just a simple Alpha with a simple principle in life.
"Time's up. Let's go back"
Draco felt the heat all over his cheeks by the compliment he just had received. He’s used to receiving compliments and oftentimes, they’re backhanded but to this man, it seemed to be sincere.
He tossed the tissue along the already messily scattered around his living room and harshly tap the enter and he watched as his new blog is being published on his site. Who the hell cares if someone describes him as someone embodying pessimistic behavior? Everyone deserves to know that bastard Jake cheated on him with some bimbo on the street!
“What happened?” he asked before Ron could say anything about whatever it is he have on his mind.
Not wanting to seem so desperate and avoid himself forcibly pushing his own self to Draco’s. He has a reputation to uphold and when he bought the ring, he was so confident to announce to his gang that he’s to propose to Draco and they might hear wedding bells soon.
Dracy gasped when she saw a tear rolling out of his eyes. It broke her heart to see Harry in such a state. She pulled him to her chest and shushed him. He’s strong. He’s definitely strong for holding for too long.
Once again, his hands found her chin, a finger brushing over to the corner of her lips and he murmured a spell. She immediately felt the tingling sensation of healing spell washing over her and she inhaled gratefully.
"Thirty"
“No!” Harry and Sirius shot up.
He knows whatever happens, he will protect her and their precious beanie. He is not hoping for any threat to come but made sure he is prepared when there’s one. Dracy have been gone through so much and what could it make him if he cannot protect his partner?
Draco told him he'll come to the party and he can only imagine what wild things the youngsters have prepared to enjoy the night. And what plot Draco has in his mind to rattle every bit of Harry's reserve.
“C’mon! Please?” he fluttered his eyelids and tightened his hold on him, “Please? I just want to have fun and show you one of the places you’ve never been in”
He leaned more into the touch and sighed softly, “I wanted to but this is our last time at Hogwarts so I’m thinking of staying”
But oh, dangerous. So dangerous.
Harry clenched his jaw, closing his eyes and opening them a second or two after, he pulled out and held her by the waist. Dracy felt the chilling sensation of a cleaning charm all over her as she watched him helped her under the blankets.
When they were outside, Harry immediately slammed Draco in the wall and he towered him. He leaned an arm beside Draco's head and bent down to level his eyes to his.
He had heard the news of the mysterious disappearance of Dracy Malfoy. It was all over the The Daily Prophet and is present in every gossip he happened to pass by. The news traveled fast that she was missing. He doesn’t need to worry a little bit.
“Be with me. Will you, alpha?” she asked so sincerely that a real smile blossomed on Harry’s face and for the first time ever, he blushed.
” he whimpered, feeling the straining erection over the lace panties he’s wearing, staining a wet patch on a certain spot, “Want you, daddy”
Upon arriving back at the department, he saw Draco munching on the chocolates while doing his work. He smiled at the sight. He wasn’t kidding when he called Draco sugar. He’s sweet on his own way.
They stared at each other’s eyes and Dracy gradually realized one more thing. She run a finger on his jawline, thinking about the man in Harry that was just let out and she was the first to see.
Hermione left his office and Harry sighed, massaging his hands to his temple. Her question definitely caught him off guard. He had thought about marking omegas to bond with in the future but the future is definitely not now.
They’re doing colors now.
He can’t wait for this to be over. Harry beside him was busy looking around, an arm once again locked around his waist to keep him close and Draco was focused on the body heat he can feel even from all the clothes on them.
They walked towards the dining where they saw Sirius and Remus sitting there. He gulped. He had not talked to them again after his stay on their place.
Harry sighed when Draco is no longer on view. He palmed his face and sighed for several times. It would be better if he’s just guarding some kid who’s known for troubles like pranks, not following bed time, and whatnot.
“Shut up” he chastised, “Are you seriously trying to catch some attention? Want to give us away?!”
“Yes, yes. Fuck. Daddy” he whined, wandlessly murmuring a lubrication charm and inserting one finger in.
His eyes glinting with mischief as he put his hands on the pocket of his sweatpants. The laidback aura on his demeanor easily piquing Draco's curiosity.
Appealing and so handsome.
"We're going to France"
Draco whimpered, arching his back, lips hovering over Harry’s sharp jawline, “Color, darlin’?”
He did. Fuck. He did. Anything for daddy. Anything for him.
He shrugged, “Sometimes”
Harry smiled at him as he tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. Not bothering to think a lot of his actions like Draco does, “Let’s go”
Harry knew people hated Lucius and they have been so enthusiastic to pour those grudges into the princess turned beggar of a daughter. Especially with her standing as an omega, she could barely do something to fight for herself.
Her children suffered war and battled with death but they’re here. Especially the two of the many ones who went through some of the worst.
“Spit” Harry ordered next, palm waiting before Draco’s mouth.
“Yeah” Harry nodded and smiled, “Do you? Because if you wouldn’t want to, we can go back”
“You know how he took the news. It probably threw him off guard. He’s just probably over at the Weasley’s, calming himself down”
Sensing her mood, Harry put a hand around her waist and pulled her closer, “Let’s go eat?”
Pansy smirked, “That’s the only way I know, honey”
“Yes, sir” he answered meekly.
She chuckled as his fingers tickled her side and lightly squirmed at her spot. She wasn’t always ticklish but her pregnancy have made her to feel slightly ticklish than usual.
Mr. Malfoy shook his head, "I need an actual person with him all the time. The last Auror Guard we hired was of no use, Mr. Potter."
He is this near to losing all of his fuck.
Harry still felt horrible but he brushed it away. Willing himself for this moment and really not knowing what to do. He had found himself unable to say no because those eyes that begged and pleadingly looked at him, as if Harry was the only one they need, he cannot say no.
She mewled unexpectedly when Harry flick his tongue out and lick a wet striped over the side of her neck, “Hmm?”
"I want to try it. Can we, Harry?" Draco fluttered his eyelashes and Harry sighed and nodded. Those pleading eyes are enough to convince him to let him ride his bike.
And damn Harry for telling he’s a journalist.  There’s obviously no fixed cover on that! He is so sleeping on the couch tonight again!
Draco arched his back a little as he felt hard chest pressed through his back. Defined abdomen stabbing his behind, hard cock pressed to his bare ass.
“Uh, Auror Warren and Auror Cornius got into a fight”
“Why didn’t you tell us?”
“Good, good” she responded, eyes back to the scrutinizing gaze she always hold.
Harry nodded, brushing a thumb over the back of her hand before gently pulling her to the table and he pulled a seat for her, “Thank you” she sincerely thank his gesture.
She gulped, lifting her head up from his shoulder and focused straight ahead. This is what the unspoken gamble have lead them to. All those teasing and playful glances from the past few weeks have led them to conclude it now.
His hand moved from its place on her waist and gave a squeeze of her breast for a few times, “Wanna taste your milk”
He chuckled mirthlessly as he laid back to his chair inside his office. Putting the latest edition of The Quibbler down in his desk, he tilted his head as he stared straight ahead. His hands calmly clasped to one another. His coat laying nice at the love seat few feet away to the right, his tie lay across his shoulder with the first three buttons of his sleeves popped open to provide a nice sight of his sturdy chest.
The sight was hot. Harry is undeniably hot and sensual. She bit her lips, trying to hold back the arousal that’s beginning to be in her system.
“So, what surprise you have for the guests tonight?” Draco tried to speak, ask, something so he wouldn’t let Harry do all the talking. They cannot afford to rouse any suspicions.
“You are amazing, Draco but there are just things I shouldn’t do because my name dictates me not to” he finally explained.
“Yeah?” Harry hummed, “Feels nice, kitten?”
It was something. Something good but perplexing.
Harry bit his lip. Kid. Fuck. He’s a kid in their eyes?
“Baby, the next time you say that, I’m going to obliviate myself” he murmured, chin resting on Draco’s shoulder, “But this is nice. Me keeping you warm”
He nodded, laying on his back as he let Harry pin his wrists on the headboard, “These stay here or I won’t let you cum”
“I freaked out. I was scared you’ll ask me to give up this business then make me come with you” Draco was afraid to look at him, afraid to find what’s in there, “I cannot give this pub up, Harry and I certainly cannot make you give up your life”
He’s not sure whether he can handle that. That wasn’t a part of his purpose.
Even when he didn't want to, Draco felt himself blush. He knew his father have made a wrong decision to arrange a marriage with a muggle. Even if the Potter family is considered to be a 'royalty'. This is an absolute mistake. Harry doesn't even look like he possess an ounce of nobility. He looks like a complete playboy, a man who crawls in different beds every night.
What’s the use of his education if he’s not knowledgeable enough on how to avoid this kind of stuff?
Seamus, Dean, Ginny, and Neville all smiling at him widely.
He brushed the hair out of her face before massaging her scalp. Dracy sighed gratefully, leaning her weight more and her brain short circuiting at the way Harry’s fingers nicely massaged her.
“M-me?” he stammered out and Harry nodded, “Yes. What do you want to do other than to dance?”
“Not so fast, sweetheart” he winked as he brought his hand back to their line of sight, “You’ve been so desperate since you decided to seduce me. Do you think you deserve a treat?”
“Re” he called, his voice hoarse with all the moans and whimpers, he closed his eyes, loving the way Remus’ movements didn’t falter as he began to chase his own zenith.
Draco nodded determinedly. Harry always shows him the results of what he’s done to rile him up. Why don’t he show his daddy what happens if he makes his baby jealous? Afterwards, he’ll make sure this whore won’t ever have the audacity to try to be so lovey-dovey on what is rightfully his.
“Words led me use my wand for Unforgivables. Words led me nearly kill the headmaster. Words led my life, Harry. Words that were always in the dish, in my drinks, in my sleep. Words that affected me as they intended to”
“I’m just putting it as it is. Well, Harry?”
Of why he is so popular, why all the fame, of what’s worthy in him. Why, of all people, it’s Harry who roused desire inside him. Broke the walls he built to protect himself and shattered it as it if was mere fragile glass.
She watched the two grow, watched them stumble and watched them stand back up. Despite at their young age, they conquered their own battles and now, as she watch them walk inside the Great Hall hand in hand,
“Come on. Let’s get cleaned up” he carried her into the bathroom, settling her down on the bath tub and filled it with water and soap.
"So, you can guard me better, don't you think so Harry?" Harry clenched a jaw. Harry knows Draco knows he's playing with fire and he's enjoying it.
She blushed as she accepted the flowers, “You look handsome” she complimented back, pouting her lips more when Harry bent down to give her a kiss.
“Answer when you’re spoken to, omega” he purposefully lowered his voice and made sure he was clear in making a point.
It didn’t help that Harry is one fine specimen. Tall, unrelenting, seductive and utterly so good with his hands. Those thick fingers, much thicker than Draco’s and the rings that glinted within the dim lights of the pub Draco is working in.
He laughed. Okay, it’s enough. The dragon is awake. Why did he hire this sexytary again? Yeah right. Sexy, sexy baby.
They were happily settled in the living room until it was time for them to go. Upon Dracy saying good bye to them Ron pulled him out of her earshot and spoke, “We’ve contained every press trying to smear her name, Harry. Kingsley was able to ban your names in the Daily Prophet"
Harry was silent all throughout. Letting him work on what he said and chose to stay silent even when Draco was done. Before doubts from on his mind, Harry pushed his head away so they could gaze to one another, “Angel”
“No. Please don’t tell me” Harry said seriously, “I’ve ruined myself enough”
She just took the fucking bait willingly. She trapped herself.
“Yes, daddy and you’re going to watch me”
“It was such a nice surprise to see you here tonight. I thought you’d be more at home, trying to settle in and y’know” he wiggled his eyebrows as to suggest something and Draco fought the urge to grimace in disgust.
Sirius’ mind felt like splitting in two, staring straight in his eyes, they looked at one another. Remus’ gaze was hot, firing him with intensity, steam, and overflowing stimulation as his own gaze felt soft to Remus’ eyes, his eyes were glassy with tears, begging, drawing him in as he clenched around Remus’ thick monster cock.
“Yes, baby” harry answered and Draco faked a pitiful smile.
“What happened?”
Harry smiled smugly before taking cockybee’s attention away from Draco.
“Your father is here”
His brows furrowed as he looked at the bed beside him and there he was with all the savior’s glory, sleeping peacefully as if he wasn't the one to blame the cauldron exploded and hit them.
The differences lie there but there is still the essence of familiarity, a guise for somewhat similar kind of intimacy between the both of them. Ginny and Luna’s were official while the two of them, albeit not talking about it, knew taking their time.
“I wasn’t supposed to be here” he gazed at his nails, perfectly portraying the laid back man to cool of his anger even if it did not abate even the slightest bit.
“H-harry” Draco spoke, voice so low Harry nearly wasn’t able to hear it.
“Calm down. Eat your breakfast” Pansy spoke again and annoyingly, Draco turned his head to look at her and raised an eyebrow, “Do you think I can have the energy to calm down when Harry is flirting with someone?”
There’s nothing wrong with him. Harry’s in good mood, he’s happy, he’s joyful, delighted, all things good. He’s just having a perfect day but slightly made imperfect for leaving Draco alone in the Manor. But what is so wrong with jesting? Making fun of his best buddy? When he’s mad, they question him and when he’s happy, they question him as well? He’s bewildered.
They held hands as they walk to Harry’s car. Like always he opened the car door for him and gave him a kiss on his cheek.
Harry grabbed his leather jacket and true to his words, headed out. He drove past streets, turning around the corners and stopped just below the bridge to unwind. He took a cigarette out of his pocket and lit it up.
“Sound so sweet, Draco. Hmm, fuck, looking so gorgeous like this. Utterly spent” Harry whispered, helping to ride out his orgasm and when all Draco can feel was the buzzing in his chest to the vibrations of Harry’s soft groans, he let his body sag down a little.
His skin looked so pale almost as if there's no blood inside him at all. It's inviting and coaxing. And that fucking ass that wiggles as he moves. Fuck he would pay millions of galleons to feel those two cheeks on his palm and play with it like a stress ball. And the way he bent down to put on his fucking thong is nothing but lavishly wonderful. He had a glimpse of that pink puckered hole, it looked so tight and he would gladly loosen him up.
“Shit, yes, yes. Daddy!” he mewled loudly as Harry scissored his fingers, stretching him good like he’d promised before the third finger found its way in. The pain increased and he threw his head back.
Draco gulped, "We have this potion in us?"
Lily hugged the boy while James smiled and shook hands with him, “Hey, kid”
“Shut up. Don’t show your dumb here, Potter. I’ll handle this”
” he begged, hoping to not receive any punishment that will only traumatize him rather than to make him learn a lesson. His wrists still slightly sore from wearing handcuffs for the whole week last week when he refused to kiss the man.
A person who never has to work a day in his life oozes with appeal and strut around like he owns the world. He wore his crown like pride and confidence like his jewelry. He never is bad of anything, everything he can do.
“Daddy, oOH. Ngh”
He didn’t even have enough time before Luna spoke again, “And wrackspurts are all over him like always”
He can do broken Renaissance phrases, medieval sentences, or even misquote Shakespeare. Anything to make that omega blush and give in with the cravings he have not discovered yet but Harry can see.
“Fuck, fuck, Alpha”
She gently grabbed it after carefully sitting up and read.
He laughed and shrugged his shoulders. He began to toy with his food, acting nonchalantly as not to rouse his mother’s suspicions. If his parents made this decision then he would do anything not to let them interfere on how he’s going to treat this engagement.
Harry laughed. Ohh, to be knocked down like that, what a fucking way to go.
Oh, fucking hell. She can feel herself drowning in anticipation. Of what he can do to make her pay, of what she can get from him. She felt her pussy clenched and she stared at him with bated breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tom shrugged easily with a hint of smirk in his face, “It's not for everyone”
So, he has an effect to him after all.
Draco huffed and was about to take a step away from him when he felt strong hands holding him back and pushed him against the wall. Wide eyes stared at him, questioning and demanding to know what he is doing.
If that line is said by someone other than Draco, he would be annoyed. But damn, he loves this kind of savagery.
It was so sweet Harry nearly lost himself with the sensations together with every beat of Draco’s reaction and the moans, yells, whimpers. It was his new kind of music.
Whether this be the Potion, pearl dust, or like Luna’s statement about Hogwarts knowing what to do, “I’m happy with you”
She blushed at what seemed a very thoughtful action. He didn’t just take, he gave as well.
Did the man seriously think he cannot get out of those silly handcuffs? Silly.
Harry nodded and considered.
“Harry” she smiled, taking his coat off his hands and laying it on the back of the couch. Harry immediately hugged her by the waist and kissed her full on the mouth, letting the woman know how much he missed her with the kiss.
He ignored that.
Draco keeps on pouting. He misses Harry and wants to be with him again. How long is he out already? This is their official first day being together but then, Harry have to go to his work in the Ministry. This day is important and they should’ve been together!
“Good morning, sleepyhead. How’s your rest?” he asked and leaning down to nuzzle his nose to hers, “Was it good?”
Harry panted as he granted Draco’s wish. Pulling out and thrusting back in in a rough pace, hand tightened as Draco clenched around him. As moans continuously rained down the whole room, Harry bucked his hips faster, balls hitting the cleft of Draco’s ass as he held him by the hips, raising it up a bit for better access,
She wasn’t sure whether she has the energy to be mad at her father now. She felt bad before, she often questioned his actions in her mind, as she lay awake in her bed, she doubted the love her father has for their family.
Harry is in the process of looking over vials of potions when Draco spoke once again.
That thick finger pumping in and out, curling as if familiarizing with her walls, prodding at every little nerve that has her coating his finger of her slick. His mouth ravishing intense attention around her clit.
“Mind where you’re going, Potter” the venom in his tone didn’t sound much as his voice came out breathy.
Harry grabbed the half filled bottle of water and helped Draco sipped from it. Afterwards, they sat there in silence. His hands gliding along Draco’s leather clad legs and when he turned to look at his beloved, he saw him eyeing him up with a far fetched expression.
He massaged his temples with one hand and took a step closer to Draco, “Draco listen—
After minutes and several coughs from around, the seventh year made a smart decision to get away and he turned his attention back to his boyfriend and raised an eyebrow, “Follow me”
“It’s all its point” Draco smartly pointed out and as much as Harry loves the brain, he needs the heart too.
Draco smiled giddily, “Yes, please daddy”
“Daddy” he whimpered as Harry began to touch his cock, slowly tracing its head, wiping the precum from the tip, using it as a lube as he slid his palms down, the tip of his fingers teasing the underside of his cock.
He gasped, his face heating at full force. He spluttered and fumbled with his clothes before he decided to change the subject, just to merely get over it, “Bubbling frog is a disease that formulates when a person have been out long in places that are foggy and not licensed for safe hiking. It isn’t really deadly but can be harmful”
Harry stared at the wall behind Draco. Not knowing what to think. He’s stuck. This isn’t what he prepared for.
“Here’s your sobering potion” he said stiffly. Keeping his expression and tone cool and collected as not to give away the inner wars he’s currently having.
He whimpered and Harry’s eyes flashed dangerously. He clenched his left hand into a fist while the right one found its way to touch Draco’s wrist. His fingers gliding at it.
“What happened, Harry?” Seamus asked as they settled in the common room after dinner. He was cuddling with Dean on the couch and it took all ounce of strength for Harry not to replace Seamus’ and Dean’s face with their own.
“He fucked me last night”
Just one question. One and if Draco’s determined to stand by his answer, Harry will walk and drive away from his life.
Ever since he met him, he's been wearing a dress and it's not helping Harry even just a little bit.
He have a huge chance of enduring a flu and would be willing to undergo lobotomy but this? Fuck it.
Perhaps he isn’t because he’d always been beautiful— it was just a quality Harry refused to acknowledge. Honestly beautiful and not ‘more’ beautiful.
Draco turned his head and raised an eyebrow before turning back to his work, “You will not buy me with your flowers”
Harry nodded behind his glass, “I declined”
He didn’t know what he was doing nor did he stop to think about what he was saying. He just knew he has to please the person who robbed him of his freedom so could earn it back.
“The lips?” Draco asked bewildered, eyes widening when Harry bent down and gave him a quick peck on the lips and ran off laughing.
He raised an eyebrow and turned his body to face him, “Why are you calling me doll?”
Two days after the fuck, Draco was busy working on his desk when a newspaper landed on his desk. Turning his head to thanked one of his co-employees who’s tasked in handing him the The Daily Prophet.
“Yes. Just along the corner from here.” he answered and Harry was about to speak when a woman interrupted them and handed Tom his order.
“Do you think it’s time to clarify that now?” Harry asked in disbelief as they continued to walk towards the bar counter.
It started when the famous matriarch of the Malfoy Family, the beautiful Narcissa Black Malfoy died. Her husband, unable to cope with the heartbreak, got addicted to muggle drugs, casinos, and basically, being drowned with lust of horny sluts around the town and neighboring ones as well. He gambled his life’s worth until he can no longer fend for himself and for their daughter.
Draco did nothing but moan. Feeling himself start to float in subspace.
“Darling you see, we had to seek for a new person who could provide the security we need in the muggle world. He requires marriage in exchange”
“Let’s get you breakfast before getting ready” Harry helped her sit up and feed her the breakfast he brought to bed, “Don’t pout at me, baby. You’ll know soon”
She sighed. Feeling tears bubbling inside her. How. . . why. . .
Harry and his friends fell into an easy conversation, eating now and then a small portion of rice and some fried chicken legs. He pulled their hands above his leg and held it there, giving Draco some attention by rubbing his thumb on his skin.
He smiled and sighed blissfully. There was a flutter inside him seeing Draco use his things. Wanting nothing but to bundle the pretty little one in his arms, craving for more than just a simple kiss in the forehead.
Especially when he realized the way Luna stares at her girlfriend was the way he found himself staring at Draco. And her statement was nothing but an absolute eye-opener. The message in her gaze and the smile on her lips was enough to cower him into a cheesy fool.
That sounded so good. So good. He grunted, feeling the rush of blood to his cock that’s starting to harden.
Neville had some growth spurt and puberty did him what he’s worthy off, they should be gushing about him.
“I went to the library yesterday” he started,, expressions seeming as if he was deep in thought, reminiscing his time in the library yesterday.
He gulped. Several conclusions forming in him as he processed what Harry is telling.
It didn’t take long before Draco grew agitated when Harry didn’t return for one night. But to not see him for three days is wild, crazy, and hysterical.
He pushed his face closer to him until they were mere inches apart.
“Look at you. The next time we’re doing this, I’m going to put a mirror in front of us so you could watch yourself as I fuck you hard on my fingers. Watch as my fingers disappear in your pussy”
“P-please” he trembled.
Harry did not respond but he hummed, squeezing their interlaced hands and slowly increasing his pace before gradually returning to normal had Draco’s cock throbbing inside that wet heat.
Harry jumped from his seat, cheeks blushing a deep red as he cleared his throat awkwardly, “Excuse me, I have to get this” he mumbled quickly and rushed into the balcony, giving Draco the chance for himself.
“I bet you had the boy bent over. Was it good? Was it spectacular? Picturesque? Extravagant? Amazeballs?” Sirius or probably it was Padfoot who seemed to have eaten a Thesaurus for breakfast, prodded and Harry sighed as he removed the hands on his face and looked at him who’s still straddling his own vehicle.
Oh merlin, is that his fianceé? No, no.
He wanted him again. Not in the same way he had this morning but that Harry from last night and maybe, even rougher if it’s possible. Right now, in the Potter house, in Harry’s bedroom, above Harry’s head, take him, pound him, fuck him in the ass, make him cum for several times until he can no longer.
“No one denies you” he murmured before walking out of the bathroom to get to Harry’s office and continue doing his moves and charms.
Harry takes what he wants when he wanted them and Draco gave without complain. For Draco didn’t trust himself to confront the man. He isn't naturally a fighter but in this, he was. Not in a good way but surely in a bad way. He fought his own self, disregarded his dignity, for in fear of what he can hear in Harry’s mouth.
When Parvati was done, she handed him an assortment of flowers arranged beautifully in a golden yellow wrapping paper with flower designs that match the flowers that are in the bouquet.
“You can do anything you want here. If you need and want anything, tell me” Harry whispered.
. That’s his statement before, isn’t it? He hinted at it. He needed someone. How could she be so dumb not to comprehend?
"Little one, I know what you're doing" Harry said through gritted teeth. Draco bit his lips and blinked at him. Harry found himself staring at his cherry red lips and he imagined himself smashing his to that delicious lips and sucked the bottom lip between his fingers.
“Baby,” he let himself call him with the pet name. He cupped Draco’s nape and urge him to look. Draco rested his chin above his chest and watched, “Listen,”
Luna perused him for a moment, “You look happy”
He whimpered. Fuck. Just a little bit. His hands, his thick cock. He was overflowing with desire to let Remus take him from behind, in front. Have him kneel as he face-fuck him. Treat him like a fuck toy but hug him afterwards, wiping his sweat with his loving, brushing any exhaustion within his body by the sincerity Remus shows as they sleep.
They seriously just didn’t made an issue about him and Harry wearing matching bracelets. It was just silly. It was a gift from Lovegood. They should wear it. Everyone knows you just don’t throw a gift away— he was this close to do so however.
“May I have a dance with the fine lady?” he asked, voice measured and cold.
“Cum inside me, Harry. Want you to fill me, please” she whispered seductively in his ear. She turned her head to nuzzle his neck and peppered it with kisses and gently nips, “Harry”
"I think you have mistaken me from an Auror Guard. We have men for that and I can call them for you" Harry responded respectfully just as the House Of Potter have taught him to do even when he dislike such idea. He matched Mrs. Malfoy's elegance as he clasped his hands above the piles of documents messily scattered above the table.
“You promise you’re going to be with me, daddy?” he peered, pulling away slightly and facing him. Harry smiled and cupped Draco’s face.
She whined silently. She doesn’t even know what she wants right now. As she watched Andy stood up after a healer came into the room, she excused herself and rushed out. Harry immediately turned to her and smiled.
Harry took on in following the man to wherever he goes, spying on his businesses and trying to interrogate some people while Draco had gotten to study the schedules Harry got and tracing the bank transfer he’s getting.
“I love you, Dracy”
When he stepped out of the Ministry, he instantly apparated straight to Gaydar who runs by every hour of the day. He arrived within a whiff, settled just by the entrance point to see familiar faces and non-familiar ones who can just as be nice as a popsicle.
“Baby, b-baby” he whispered, feeling like he was about to pass out. Fuck!  Why is this taking so long?!
Surely, nothing’s wrong? Harry would always pop up but his absence is ticking concern inside him. Could it be that they left? But Harry always bid his goodbye and makes sure to make him feel good before he disappears.
Draco didn't wait for any response as he began to walk and Harry followed acting like a distracted old man because he is.
“A-andy” she stammered as Harry’s palm came in contact with her lace covered breast, he was rolling his palm and lightly massaging.
Draco nodded and smiled. They have the whole place for themselves, that's great. "What else?"
He expects Sirius’ recommendation is of any help. They cannot be having their names out there in the muggle public if it’s not for good intention.
For others, marking may be a necessity. But for her, her love and his love would be enough to tie them together.
“’arry, where have you been?” she asked sadly but smiling when Harry handed her the flower before kissing her forehead and sitting down at the floor to face her tummy.
Yes, karma for annoying Ron. He just got burned. Someone call the fire ward. He just got his soul fucking burned. Ah, fucking straight to third degree burn.
Sirius pouted, “Never enough”
When he was all fixed and is pretty decent to walk back to the Great Hall, he blew Harry a kiss before walking out, his hips swaying dangerously sexy and giggling when Harry groaned in annoyance.
Carefully settling the flower down, she run her fingers in his hair and lightly scratch his scalp, “Little beanie wasn’t” she responded softly.
Even more that this time she’s in heat and she have an Alpha to comfort her and kissed her as if she’s the only omega left in the world. As if she’s the only omega destined to have that body above her.
All the things she thought were nice and good about Harry were cut and were replaced by the disappointment she didn’t even know she’s feeling in the first place.
“I’ll take an espresso and what about you, baby?” Harry turned to him and if he was butter, he would be melting on the floor.
“You’re going?” Ron asked in surprise as they settled at Weasley Twin’s apartment— just above their joke shop, “I thought you received an invitation from Robards as well for Auror training?”
He hates Harry! And kisses? Meant nothing. This is for the mission. Just an angry kisses. Kisses for enemies. He was fast to locked his hands on Harry nape and returned the fire. He let out a keening noise when Harry slammed him to the left side of the aisle.
Flirting leads to romance and romance is nothing but a joke and if you fall to a joke, you’d be treated as a clown and clowns aren’t silly, they’re scary and if you’re scary, you’re left alone and if you’re left alone, you’re lonely and if you’re lonely, then die. That’s Draco’s ultimate advice beginning now. Very effective, he’ll probably try it.
“Daddy is going to stretch you good, open you with my fingers, nudge your hole until you’re softly moaning and writhing, clenching around me”
Sirius rolled his eyes, his hands not knowing where to hold onto, as he scrambled noises after noises.
From the heat of Harry’s body to the intensity of his eyes and warmth of those hands. Not to mention, how easy it is to pin him down was setting all of his senses ablaze.
Harry smiled guiltily before shaking his head, “How about this, little one, I’ll come back for lunch and we’ll eat together?”
He stomped his foot and began to show off his famous Draco Malfoy sulking. If he’s going to deal with this situation, his parents has to deal with him being bratty as well.
Oh, gosh.
“’ma, yummy” she whined petulantly as she leaned on her big brother James who wrapped a hand around her shoulder.
Then he buffered. Roaring Lions. His lips parted as one by one, motorbikes came swarming in. Neville handed him another white rose before taking his place beside Theo.
FUCK!
“Woooo. Let’s end this party!”
Merlin. He loves this. Harry really is magnificent. He gathered what strength he had left and pulled Harry to face him. They smiled at each other when their eyes met and Draco closed his eyes when Harry bent down, brushing his nose to his before kissing him full on the lips.
“Ready?” Harry asked as he stood in front of him, lacing their fingers together and raising an eyebrow when he noticed he did not wear any gloves.
Dracy tilted her head, she didn’t answer as she stared over to the man. Her eyes wandering  all over his towering figure. The bulge in the right places and the way it flexes even just the littlest of movement. Her mouth watered almost immediately.
Harry did not stop nor did he falter. He relentlessly grind his hips up, lifting him up and down to meet his thrusts and Draco trembling at the overstimulation. He collapsed on him, his head leaning over his shoulder as Harry released his seed inside him.
Harry raised an eyebrow coldly at the woman and leaned in front of his desk, crossing both of his legs and arms. He was absolutely infuriated when he saw the article this morning, how fast Daily Prophet could work to spread the word, creating more scandal than necessary. It may not have the picture because he took the camera with them but the article was still there, smearing whatever dirt it can give not to him but to his omega.
Harry held his cheek and frowned, “We really do have to deal with this slapping attitude, doll! Fuck, that hurt”
His forehead creased. He cannot understand. What’s forbidden?
“It’s no problem. We all know how our Alpha Harry can be. Anyway, this is my secretary, Star”
. He reminded himself.
“’Mione, it’s obvious. They had seggs”
Millicent nodded and smiled, "I dare you to make out with the hottest girl in here"
They turned around the corner and before he could even say anything, he was surprised when he got hauled inside a phone booth, suddenly caged between Harry’s arms. He blinked like a dumbass as he stared in Harry’s throat, taking in the way his adams apple bobble. It shockingly looks so nice.
He didn’t think those lips to his own. He didn’t imagine how his hands would feel as it caress the skin in Draco’s neck. How his teeth would feel good biting at his clavicle. Of course he didn’t visualize them all. It’s merely a comedy.
“It’s not about my rut. It’s actually about a question Dracy asked me last night and I couldn’t answer”
When his hands began to play with his bum and when Harry towered over him with that darkened glaze in the most beautiful emerald he ever saw in his life, he slipped out. He moaned and mumbled
Instantly, she shook her head. She cannot afford to appear in the public. A Malfoy pregnant out of wedlock? It would certainly be a topic of the century. Her palms began to sweat, remembering how alone she is. Where even is her father? He is absolutely nowhere.
Dracy straightened up, eyes looking curiously, “Where are we going?”
It was all so good. She leaned on Harry’s torso, trying to regain her composure and control what’s again starting to boil inside her.
mouth on me”
Draco giggled, “For old time’s sake”
He took a deep steady breath. It’ll do him no good to be fidgety and nervous.
The little one looked so lost. So defeated. As if he’s carrying the heaviest of problems in the world. How can Harry make him understand?
You see when you have a perfect night, you wake up on the right side of the bed. But the problem is, the others do not.
“Another size six of those” Harry decided for her.
He gasped, taking one step back. Suddenly, everything felt too constricted. He grabbed his robes and tried not to thrash around. What? How could he say it so easily? He’s wrong. He’s wrong!
“D-daddy” he called back. Loving the way the word baby rolled of Harry’s tongue. Too good to be true however sounded so right.
Draco gasped. His hands coming to touch Harry on the chest. He felt him stilled at his palm. He doesn’t understand where Harry is going with this but he wanted to. But he wanted it more to hug him because he misses him so much. And he did.
“When is this ‘no time’?” Lucius asked condescendingly, huffing over the phone, “It’s been a week, Draco. Are you really getting somewhere?”
“So, your plan is to live with her unmated, unbonded until you grow sick of her?”
Harry sighed. Why is it so hard to try to talk to one person? He just yelled at a lot of Aurors days ago. Though the situation is different. This is much personal.
Draco looked at him hazily and Harry felt the most sinful man on Earth. Before he could be encountering another reminder of the principles he had buried, he took Draco’s weeping cock into his mouth, feeling Draco gripped his head tight and his thighs quivered.
Draco looked at the muscular figure and nodded while sighing gratefully. Even Pansy was shocked when they just arrived and introduced Harry to her. He visited her to inform her that his parents went to France and he'll be alone with an Auror to guard him and the Manor.
Now, she’s feeling like she needs to. Especially when her pussy wholeheartedly agree.
Two years ago, at age eighteen, Draco is nothing but a needy and seductive boy. Who possesses every ounce of beauty in the world. The long pale legs that manages and never fails to catch Harry's breath and entice him into touching him without the thoughts of being righteous and go against his own principles as being a Head Auror who should be brave to look away to such indecent thoughts.
