“In the memory Dumbledore showed Harry about Voldemort collecting mementos, Harry offhandedly mentioned something about a baby blanket that Tom was extremely protective of.”
Severus sighed as he stood up and followed Remus out of the infirmary, glancing back at Harry and then at the curtain enclosed bed where he knew Draco to be. He was obviously doing something wrong; both of his charges were in hospital, after all.
Once the rest of the class had followed directions, Remus stood between the Gryffindor and Slytherin, already feeling a slight sense of dread. Harry looked very determined, whereas the Slytherin looked extremely haughty. Harry was going to wipe the floor with him, the poor sod.
, we’ll call it, during your third year regarding changes in lesson plans and homework assignments. This year, however, Professor Snape has agreed to stick to my lesson plans and homework, so there should not be any confusion. I fully expect you all to respect Professor Snape and to do the assignments he assigns while he is covering for me, as they’re technically my own assignments. Anyone who decides they want to disrespect Professor Snape gets whatever punishment he feels you deserve; I will not revoke the punishments he gives out, so be careful what you say. Now, onto today’s lesson; Lycanthropy and Vampirism: comparing and contrasting societal values regarding these creatures, and debunking the numerous myths that have attached themselves over the years…”
“Hermione, do you know when Voldemort attended Hogwarts? If we know what year Voldemort graduated, we may be able to determine if Burke’s disappearance coincided with Voldemort’s disappearance after working there. He still worked there when Voldemort did, because he’s the one who hired Tom,” Harry said, his heart racing. Things were finally starting to fall into place, and they were that much closer to finding another Horcrux.
“Cheeky brat,” Severus muttered fondly as he pulled away from the Gryffindor and moved towards the door to admit the Casewitch. “Welcome to our home, Mrs. Luther. Please, come in.”
“Harry, can I talk to you? Er, in private?” Draco asked quietly, ignoring the whispers that were coming from a group of third year girls who were pointing at him and Harry and giggling. It had taken him quite a while to decide what he wanted to say to Harry, and the Gryffindor’s passionate exit from breakfast had been the last straw for Draco. He missed Harry.
The Potions Professor just continued to guffaw into his mug of mead as Draco pulled helplessly on his pointy ears.
“The Weasleys would probably be willing, yes, but you see for yourself the type of dilemma you face by trying to become part of their family. I am not saying to write them off, just simply try to think of other potential guardians. I do not need an answer right away, but sooner would be much preferable than later. Once you have chosen who you’d like, and spoken to them about it, come to me and we’ll set everything in motion. Have you any other ideas of who to ask?”
Before Remus could respond, there was the sound of steps coming towards them, and the weight of someone sitting on the other side of Harry on the sofa.
Remus was growing weary of Severus’ antics. After the first two weeks of term had come and gone, the Potions Master had been coming up with excuse after excuse for why he couldn’t spend time with the werewolf. Though a lot of these excuses were valid, it was the obviously made up ones that irked Remus to the core. Snape may be good at lying, but the man didn’t even try hard enough
Severus walked over to the sofa that Harry was still lying on and sat down at the teen’s feet, scrubbing a hand over his pale face. He looked up as Remus knelt in front of him, his questioning gaze full of concern.
Harry gathered the blonde in his arms, holding onto Draco tightly as he clutched his robes like a drowning man. He felt tears slide down his cheeks as Draco wailed in despair into his shoulder. Harry didn’t know what to do other than just hold Draco and murmur that things would be alright. That is, until Snape walked into the infirmary and made a b-line straight for the teens.
The morning of the mission was very tense, everyone completely silent at breakfast. Molly had of course argued about the younger members going along, including Harry, but she eventually conceded after Harry explained to her in private how his connection to Voldemort was needed to identify and locate the thing they were looking for. He never mentioned what the item actually was. The less people that knew about the Horcruxes, the better. The other members had been told that Harry was looking for something imperative to the war effort and nothing more. No one questioned it, and Harry was glad he had so many people willing to help.
“Depending on how much venom Weasley and Remus bring back, we may be able to use aconine as the base. Having the venom as a catalyst will cause the alkaloid to become poisonous once more, and highly acidic. While the basilisk venom should take care of destroying the soul, the aconine will dissolve the vessels in which they are stored,” Severus explained as he measured out a beaker full of the derivative of Wolfsbane.
“Alright, is everyone ready? The way the spells are performed is very similar to that of an Unbreakable Vow, which Severus at least is very familiar with,” Dumbledore chuckled, ignoring the half-hearted glare that the Potions Master fixed him with.
Draco rolled his eyes as he relaxed his wand and prepared to go into lecture mode again. “Memory links are trails of memories leading from one to another, or many others. A lot of your memories are interlinked, having some sort of relation to each other in one way or another. Even simple thoughts like what you’ll be having for dinner may lead back to a very important memory if you happened to have been eating dinner during that memory, or thinking of it even. My point is, I can follow one memory on to many others using the links and trails connected to said memory. That’s why constant blocks are essential; even the most mundane thoughts can lead to important memories, such as the one I just saw.”
Harry smelt a familiar scent, something he recognized immediately, but it wasn’t Severus’ usual scent of potions ingredients and freshly laundered robes. A quick look at the bedside table showed that the side Severus was currently laying on was Remus’ side, and the pillow was most definitely the werewolf’s. Harry was smelling Remus’ scent, and it made his heart clench to know that Severus was much more unsettled by the situation than even Harry had thought he was.
After warding and silencing the room, Remus reached slowly for the stone and picked it up. It was light, almost weightless in his palm, and the way the fire in the grate reflected off the onyx edges reminded Remus of cold, lonely night filled with despair after Lily and James had been killed and Sirius taken to Azkaban. Before the memories could take root, Remus thought as hard as he could about his deceased lover, his best friend and confidant as he turned the stone, one – two – three times in his palm, and closed his eyes.
“I’m not positive, Harry, but I think I can find out. The library here, it has copies of the old Prophets, I believe. We should be able to find out what we need from there.”
“Why would they kill one of their own? I have many guesses, but no solid facts. Nott could have betrayed the Dark Lord somehow, or perhaps displeased him greatly in some manner. I even entertained the idea of him dying in the fire, but a spell revealed he’d been put under the Cruciatus curse for nearly twelve hours before being hit with the killing curse. The Dark Lord’s magical signature was all over it,” Severus said with a shrug that Harry couldn’t decide was tired or confused as well.
Harry gave the password to the portrait protecting Draco’s room and slipped inside. He moved over to the bed, smiling at the form of his sleeping boyfriend, even through his worry about what the letter contained. He looked so calm and peaceful; he hated to have to wake him up. He reached out and gently shook the blonde’s shoulder.
what I thought happened. I’m sorry to hear about your family, Harry, that’s horrible. You know I don’t really like Snape, but if he saved your life than he deserves a bit of credit for that. He’s not being so…nasty anymore, is he?”
Dumbledore fixed his half-moon spectacles on the bridge of his nose as he gathered up a few folders full of parchment and straightened them in his hands. He looked up at Severus and fixed him with his piercing gaze for a few minutes before nodding curtly. “I’m sure I can find some time for you, Severus. Speaking of Mr. Potter, he skived off breakfast this morning. Is everything alright after his dream last night?”
They waited almost five minutes before Severus and Remus emerged from the bathroom, Remus clothed in a dressing gown and sleep pants much like his husband. His hair was still wet, which made it look darker, in turn making the man look slightly younger.
“His own Veritaserum? Need I remind you how many times I saved my own life by taking my own, altered truth serum?”
Remus felt his heart clench as tears poured from the blonde teen’s eyes. These children were too young to see this kind of war, this was utter madness. He waited for Draco to activate the portkey, and then quickly moved away so that he did not join the young Slytherin.
After nearly a minute with no response, Severus figured that Harry had fallen asleep with a candle still lit. Not wanting to wake up to a burnt down castle, he opened the door to snuff out the candle as quickly and quietly as he could.
“I just do what’s needed to keep myself alive, Mrs. Weasley. If I had to grow up a little faster than my peers, well, it was only necessary.”
Severus felt himself relax minutely, not even aware that he had been so stressed by the notion of not being near Draco during the school year. “I would very much appreciate that, Albus. Thank you.”
“Fine! You can sleep in Harry’s room, but so help me I’ll be checking in randomly to make sure you’re both
“I’m taking him to the lab. Please stay with Draco,” Severus insisted as he carefully cradled Harry to him, using one hand to throw down some floo powder in the large hearth. “Grimmauld Place, Potions Lab.” He was gone in a tower of green flame, reappearing in his small lab, just outside of the basement kitchen.
Severus thought for a moment about that as he finished his cup of tea and conjured two fresh ones; one for him, and the other he handed to Remus.
Harry sighed as he pulled Draco down for another kiss, wrapping his arms around the blonde protectively. “Hopefully ‘eventually’ comes sometime before Christmas,” he chuckled, content to just lay there with the Slytherin for the rest of the night. He knew, however, that Severus would soon be in to separate the two.
Draco sighed, his concern and fear showing through for the first time as he let his mask slide completely. He had gotten so good at it that Harry hardly ever suspected it of being there. “I love you.”
When Harry woke up the next morning, he realized that he had not been woken by the dream the previous night, but the Dream Orb was indeed glowing blue. His father had been right about that sleeping draught. He pulled the parchment that described how to view the dreams encased in the Orb close to him and read it once more, lifting his wand to tap the sphere and muttering the charm that would project the dream onto the wall. He was glad it wasn’t like a pensieve and sucked you inside of it.
Harry took the small rectangular package and tore the wrapping off. The box inside was black and velvety, reminding Harry of jewellery packaging. He carefully opened the lid and smiled when he saw what was inside. A gentle silver bracelet lay wrapped in red velvet, the links in the shape of snakes and lions, alternating. He lifted the bracelet out and held out his wrist so that Severus could put it on for him. He turned to Remus and smiled, launching himself at the man for a tight hug.
Harry had indeed spent all day at home, Draco coming in to check on him during every passing period, free period, lunch and dinner. Harry had played enough Wizard’s chess the night before that he never wanted to touch the game again. He was so tired, but he knew if he slept, he’d have the dream again. He waited patiently for his dad to come home and watch the dream in his pensieve, hoping he would have an answer for him.
“Yes, well, I kind of suggested something like throwing him a little party, and that just made things worse. He said no one need bother going through such trouble for him. I tried to explain that it’s not trouble for us, but he refused to listen. I don’t want to completely ignore his birthday, but he doesn’t seem like a huge fan of having a party either. I’ll try to talk him around a bit today. Maybe wish him a happy birthday, see what his reaction is?” Remus suggested as they reached the top of the stairs into the Entrance Hall.
Draco looked sceptical for a few more seconds before sighing, his shoulders dropping as he took in Harry’s honest expression. Maybe he had overreacted, just a little bit. “I’m sorry; I guess I just got really jealous when I saw her touching you. I don’t like other people touching you that way.”
Draco frowned before nodding and giving Harry another kiss, brushing his messy locks aside with a look that Harry could only describe as complete understanding. Once Draco had left and shut the door behind him, Severus sat down beside his son with a heavy sigh.
Harry blushed as he physically squirmed in his seat. “Yes...My super, extraordinary, fantastical power is the ability to love. Very anticlimactic, eh?” Harry said with a wry grin.
Harry woke up at around three in the morning after having the dream, this time a little more vividly. It took him much longer to get his breathing under control and to get the sense of fear to leave him, and wasn’t surprised when his father came in, sat on the edge of his bed and handed him a calming draught.
Severus stared at Remus for a few seconds before taking a long, deep drink of his tea. Parkinson was not necessarily Inner Circle, no, but he was part of what they liked to call the ‘Blood Circle’. Death Eaters who were part of the Blood Circle were the ones who did the worst of the crimes; killing and raping mostly, but kidnapping and torturing Muggle and Mudblood children alike were among their expertise. Severus would never have thought Remus would agree if the man would have known such information. “I daresay that wasn’t the best choice in disguises. Why Dumbledore didn’t come to me and ask me who would be the best candidate is beyond me, but I could have told you right away that Parkinson was not ideal,” Severus said darkly as he drained his cup of tea.
Remus let out a slow breath as he wrapped his arms around the Potions Master, pulling him even closer. Severus never allowed anyone to see him weak or vulnerable; it was too great a risk to him. This was a first, and Remus was glad he was being let in to see his lover like no one else was allowed to. He caught Severus’ lips in a searing kiss, feeling the man melt against him.
It was quiet, too quiet. The globe like lights floated over to hover above Draco’s bed, illuminating the teen’s pale, still features. A Healer was checking the chart clipped to the end of the bed, making comments on the parchment as she ran a few diagnostic spells. Her frown was enough information as it was, but Healer Smithson turned to Snape and said, “No change yet, Professor, but we’re working really hard to find a solution, I assure you. I had an owl from Dumbledore this morning about transferring Mr. Malfoy to Hogwarts for the school year; is that still what you’d like to do?”
“You’re not going down into that terrible place again are you? There’s a giant beast! A horrible monster! It killed me, or haven’t you noticed
Severus smiled at the man, who unnervingly was still a couple of inches taller than him. “Why don’t you take a hot shower to soothe those sore muscles, first? I’ll leave when you’re out and ready to watch the boys.”
“Could you just help me without being a git for once, please?” Harry mumbled tiredly, knowing he probably shouldn’t have said that, but too tired to really care about the repercussions.
“Did he intimidate you, sir? He seemed extremely brazen for an eleven-year-old, especially after admitting to his powers. You seemed unnerved. Did you know then?” asked Harry, still quite shaken up about their similar appearances. That he could share something so intimate as his appearance with Voldemort felt like a horrible violation.
Fifteen minutes later, as Harry was heading to the Great Hall for dinner, his father caught up with him from the stairs to the dungeons. He felt himself blush at the memory of nearly falling to his death on the sixth floor, and knew it was inevitable that his father would find out sooner or later.
“No! How on earth did a sixteen-year-old boy die when he was supposed to be safe and sound at home?” Molly screamed, pulling her arm out of her son’s grip and moving towards Remus. Everyone in the room jumped a foot when the bathroom door slammed open and a distraught looking Severus Snape stalked out.
“The first time he didn’t say anything. The second time he said ‘We meet again, Potter’. This time, though, I swear he said something else. Play it,” Harry urged again.
“Perhaps we were not accusing you, but curious if you had the antidote to polyjuice on you,” said Minerva, though a few of the others looked as though they were fully ready to point the finger at Snape regardless of his speech.
It was a long walk up to the Headmaster’s office the next morning for Harry. He had no idea how he was supposed to tell Dumbledore that, instead of picking the two people who had always welcomed him and treated him like one of their own sons, he had decided to pick the Potions Master who had treated him worse than dirt for the first five years he had known him.
“Snape has always hated me. This summer, something changed between us – shifted. He respected me and I him. I think we finally understood each other for once, and I went and bollixed it all up. I could have killed Draco...Whatever understanding we had before is gone now, and I don’t think I can fix it again.” Harry looked up at Remus, his eyes red-rimmed and haunted looking. “Why do I care so damn much, and why does it hurt so bad?”
Remus snorted in laughter, forgetting his sorrows for a few glorious minutes. “My hero,” he mocked with a smile, though he actually meant it quite seriously. He studied the Potions Master’s flushed cheeks and his dark eyes for a long time before he realized he thought Severus looked adorable when he was all flustered. Remus almost frowned as he remembered the kiss they had shared and Severus’ reaction to it. He couldn’t help but feel greatly disappointed. “Oh, and Severus?”
Draco beamed at his father, wrapping him a quick hug before pulling away once more. “You know I turn seventeen in just a few months, right?”
no business here; the place where my dirty, mudblood father and his disgusting family rot in the bowels of the earth! This is my turf, Dumbledore. Death is what you shall receive!”
Remus pulled away from the embrace and took his wand out, taking a deep breath to steady himself. He closed his eyes and gave his wand a very distinct flick, directing the tip of the wand at himself. “
Hermione sat up straighter, looking ready to take in information like a sponge does water. “Why not your parents, or even Dumbledore himself? Wouldn’t they be of more help?”
“I can start tutoring you during my free periods if you’d like. Perhaps if you start learning some more spells, you’ll start to remember things. I know Healer Smithson said that familiar situations might help jog your memory, and it’ll maybe distract you from thinking about your father too much,” Hermione suggested with a tentative smile. She hadn’t talked to Draco very much since he had been released from the infirmary, but now that she knew he was a permanent part of Harry life, she had to start getting to know him somehow.
“I’ll go. I’ve been down there before; I know how to get to it,” Ron said, earning odd looks from everyone around the table.
Severus frowned in sympathy. He knew exactly what it felt like to be at the receiving end of relentless
The man crouched before them was still twitchy and nervous as ever, his pointed features and short stature still very reminiscent of the rat he pretended to be for twelve long years. Harry flinched when Lucius kicked the back of the man’s knees, causing him to fall painfully to the floor. Harry told himself not to feel sorry for this poor excuse for a man, the person who had betrayed his birth parents and nearly caused his own death, but it was so easy to pity something so pathetic.
Harry wanted to protest and demand that the Potions Master see reason, but he knew that this wasn't about him, it was about Draco. He left the room without another word, nearly running into Draco in the hallway.
“Ah, you’re just in time, Hagrid. Please, sit down,” Minerva said as she conjured an extra large, extra strong chair for the half giant just beside her. “We’re discussing breaking the Order up into separate groups so that we may all get things done more quickly and efficiently, and I was just about to suggest an inter-bestiary cooperation group. Surely you’d be the person to handle such a thing.”
“I daresay I owe it to you, Mr. Potter,” Lucius drawled with a smirk that Harry had seen grace Draco’s face countless times before. The man was most
It was early the next morning when there was a gentle knock on Harry’s bedroom door. It took him a few seconds to remember that he was back in the dungeon quarters and not at Grimmauld Place. He got up to answer the door, leaving Draco asleep curled up in his blankets.
Kingsley frowned as he stowed his wand back in his wrist holster, hidden by the sleeve of his plumb robes. “I hate having to do that to her. Clancy, get back to the Auror Department and try to head off as many people as you can, but be discreet. The last thing we need is for them to know we’ve found them out.”
Severus turned to the teenagers around the table, specifically Harry. “We should be back soon for the meeting. If Lucius comes out of his self-induced exile, let him know that the meeting has been moved up from eight to seven.”
“You can start explaining at any time, Potter,” Draco snapped as he sat on the edge of his bed, his arms still folded tight over his chest. He was extremely angry, of course he was, but he was also really hurt to think that Harry could have touched someone else, wanted to be with someone else. Especially a
“You’re not going anywhere, Remus. Please, I need you here tonight. There will be plenty of time for you to make your escape in the morning, but I need you right now.” Severus allowed himself to be engulfed in a hug, content to let Remus hold him close.
“I don’t think I can apparate just yet, and I don’t want to splinch her! Can you handle taking both of us Side-Along?” Ron asked desperately as he and Draco ran behind a large display, Hermione’s unconscious form held between them. She had been hit with a curse Ron didn’t recognize and he couldn’t recall the wording because he hadn’t heard properly. He was beyond terrified.
“I do not wish to deny it necessarily, but I will not make assumptions about Harry, either. He will make his decision based on what he thinks would be right, and he’ll do it in his own time. I offered to assist him in exploring all of his options, and that is why I invited you to dinner tonight. Not to be rude, but I think perhaps I should go look for Harry and make sure that he’s alright. You’re welcome to stay if you’d like. If not, my floo is open to you.” Severus stood up, setting his tea cup aside and grabbing his cloak. He had a feeling Harry might have taken a detour outside to think.
As Harry left the Headmaster’s office, thoughts of random talisman and trophies Voldemort could have taken swan through his mind. He had no doubt that something had been taken from his parents’ house after their murder, even if he didn’t take it until after he returned two years ago. Perhaps something from the orphanage, the graveyard in which he returned, even Hogwarts. Harry paused as that thought slammed into him. There could be a Horcrux, maybe more than one, at Hogwarts. After all, the diary had ended up in the school.
Severus was shocked by the determination in Remus’ voice. The man had clearly been stung one too many times by Dumbledore’s injustice, and Severus fully respected his decision. “There’s only one more problem then.”
There had been no need to fret, Severus realized as he walked further into the room and caught sight of Draco and Harry, curled up together in the small hospital bed. They both looked to be asleep, until Harry lifted a hand and started carding through Draco’s blonde tresses with a soft smile on his face. He looked up as he heard the sweeping of Severus’ cloak dragging on the ground.
“They’re on the other side of the west tower, working on the outer wards. I’ve no idea what even caused the stone to fall, or where it came from!” the Head of Gryffindor said, her voice highly scandalized.
Severus stood up from the hearth and held a hand out to help Harry up. “I think that is enough for now. You can practice a bit on your own and read a few chapters before we begin blocking against mental penetration from an outside source. You’re doing very well already.”
The last room at the end of the third floor corridor is where Severus’ detection spell led. Remus cast a few spells to check for curses, and when they came back negative, he used an unlocking spell on the door of room 313. It beat having to get the Muggle key-card from Bridgette.
The Headmaster sighed and shook his head, giving his wand a sharp flick to summon a tea service and a plate of scones, which he offered to Severus before serving himself. “I do not think it wise to divulge such information just yet. I have yet to question him under the effects of Veritaserum, and wish for him to be secluded until such a time.”
“He’s still my father, you know,” Draco chastised, helping Harry set the tray aside when it was evident that the Gryffindor had had his fill.
“Who are you?” Draco demanded, drying himself once more with a pointed glare at the ghost, who looked to be roughly the same age as Draco.
“But whose death – ?” Ron began to ask, but Hermione cut him off, that same excited gleam in her eyes when she was on a roll taking over once more.
“It’s time; let’s meet in the basement so we can go over the plans with the rest of the Order once more,” said Severus as he coaxed his godson, Sirius, his husband, and son out of the drawing room.
He walked slowly over to the curtained bed, feeling his heart beat quicker in his chest. He didn’t know what he expected to see, or why he had come back here after his initial overwhelmed reaction the first time. He reached a hand out from under his cloak and pulled the curtain back slowly. A small fairy light was hanging over Draco’s bed, softly illuminating the Slytherin’s pale, aristocratic features.
Harry was trembling as he wrapped his arms just as tightly around his godfather. It was amazing, feeling Sirius’ warmth and strong grip. It was hard to believe this man was just an echo, that he wasn’t back for good, and Harry felt his stomach drop at the thought of having to let Sirius go once more. He had taken an oath, though, and he knew Sirius would never truly be back. But being held in his godfather’s arms, smelling his natural, spicy scent once more made Harry feel like a lost fifteen year old again.
Severus reacted so fast that Harry had to blink to make sure he hadn’t just black out. The Potions Professor’s wand was trained on Lucius Malfoy, sticking painfully into the man’s neck as more Professors and a few Aurors joined them at the edge of the forest. The two bound Death Eaters were taken from Harry’s care and detained further.
Just what the fuck am I supposed to do?” Harry whispered to himself as he paced carefully across his cramped bedroom.
“I’ve been lucky enough to see the real Severus Snape, to be let in. I know he’s been much more open with you than any other student, besides perhaps Draco, but there are some things he’s just not ready to let you in on yet. He will be, in time. Just please don’t feel offended or shunned if Severus does not wish to be open about mine and his relationship just yet.”
“What was that all about?” Remus asked as Harry took Severus’ vacated seat and Hermione took up the ottoman sitting in front of one of the armchairs.
Upon hearing that the Order was going to start up their summer meetings again, Harry, Draco, Ginny, Hermione and a reluctant Ron approached Severus and Remus after dinner. Of course, Hermione was chosen as their spokesperson, and she fidgeted nervously in her seat in the drawing room.
“You mean others to lead me along like a blind man, pushing me across that great chess board like the pawn I am. When will you learn that I am not just a weapon to be used at your or anyone else’s disposal?” Harry shouted, his entire being shaking with rage and pent up emotions. He couldn’t handle the manipulation any longer, it was too much.
There was a murmur around the room that could have been counted as assent, but Harry’s hand shot up immediately. He waited patiently as Severus tried to ignore him as long as possible before finally sighing heavily and nodding at Harry to speak.
Severus pulled away from the hug and kneeled down in front of Harry, his hands held lightly to the Gryffindor’s shoulders. “I’m sorry you’re going through such a rough time right now, Harry, and in time I will forgive you. You must understand that I have considered Draco as a son since the boy was born, so yes, I am a bit biased. I am not saying I care about him more, I have just cared about him longer, and the boy truly has no one else in the world. Draco will forgive you too; he just needs to come to terms with the things he’s been through. We both know that none of it is your fault, but you could have made things a little bit easier by telling someone before he remembered on his own.”
“Tom always considered Hogwarts to be more of a home to him than anywhere else, especially the orphanage. I believe he wanted to keep some sort of souvenir, though his intentions may have been dark even then. Headmaster Dippet did not discover the missing ruby until months later. None of the portraits around the room gave any indication that they’d seen anyone take it, either,” said Dumbledore, looking in direction of the sword as well.
“While we won’t directly ask the state of your virtue, we’ll just assume that it is not altogether intact, being healthy nearly seventeen-year-old boys. The main thing we want to stress is waiting to go all the way. You’re both very young and have all the time in the world to experience such things together, but the responsibilities and emotions associated with taking that big step in your relationship are immense. You’ve both been through a hell of a lot in your lives, granted, but it’s important to wait until you’re ready to handle such a monumental thing, and also be able to recognize
Minerva turned around at Severus’ question, looking harassed and worried. She had her wand out, retracing the ward she had placed on the wall leading to the entrance before. “No, not yet, Severus. Filius managed to fix the ward and seal off the Floo network to Albus’ hearth. We were just discussing a plan of action for confronting him, whoever he may be. You wouldn’t happen to have any Veritaserum on you, would you?” she asked hopefully.
“So, Mr. Potter, do you concur with Professor Snape’s story?” Mrs. Luther asked, glancing down at their joined hands with a subtle smile.
Severus shared a looked with his husband, both of them in agreement that Hermione was right – they had no other leads and nothing to lose by investigating this one. If they did find another Horcrux, this would be the last one, which meant they could focus on removing the Horcrux from Harry and destroying the rest of them. It was better than nothing.
“I have the syringe, everything is going to plan. Once you’re ready, you send a Killing Curse at that monster and I’ll do the rest. I’m so proud of you, Harry. It’s almost over.”
There was a tense silence as the four other men in the room shared wary yet excited looks. Were they about to find out what one of the Horcruxes was? Had Voldemort already sacrificed one and destroyed a piece of his own soul?
Hermione’s eyes instantly filled with tears as she quickly stood from the table and moved around it. Remus automatically opened his arms to her, feeling his eyes prickle with tears once more. Ron’s eyes met the older man’s from across the table, and Remus gestured to Ron that it was ok to join the impromptu group hug.
“What do you need me to do? If you’re willing to call an echo of myself from beyond the veil, it must be important. I’ll do it, whatever it is,” Sirius assured his former lover, godson, and…Snape, whatever he was to Sirius now. Friend? Family? Who knew.
Hermione slid into the seat beside Ron at the dinner table, looking around for Harry, but not spotting him. She hadn’t seen him all day and it was starting to worry her a bit. She pulled a plate of chicken towards her as she tried to convince herself that she was hungry.
Severus stood and grasped his son’s shoulder, cupping his cheek gently in his palm. “Harry, calm down. I’m not going to force you to do anything you don’t want to do; I was just making a suggestion. We’ll worry about it when the times come, how about that?”
The room was a mass of confusion, grunts of pain and the sounds of sobbing, mostly from Harry and Remus. Draco had silent tears running down his face as he supported Harry’s weight in his arms, watching numbly as the injured were healed and put to sleep to help them recover more quickly. This was what war looked like.
“Careful; you guys are scaring the normal folk amongst us,” Harry jibbed playfully at his parents. He was surprised to hear a chuckle from Lucius as Ron turned an even darker shade of red.
“I think the best way is have a private calling, so that we may sit him down and give him a brief rundown without overwhelming him with the entire Order surrounding him. You, Remus, and I will be there for the initial calling. After we update him on what’s happening, we can let everyone else see him. We have to be careful; we’ll need to explain to him as well that this is temporary, that he is not truly back and never will be. That may be the toughest part for all of us.”
“Good morning,” Draco said.  “My daughter is visiting from Canada, and she was most excited to visit your shop.”
“I’m not sure,” Draco said thoughtfully.  “I’ve never met her.  I’m sure you know that she and my Mother’s family had a falling out when Andromeda married Ted Tonks.”
“It’s different, I’m sure.  Obviously, I never attended a Muggle school, but a tutor will work with you on subjects that interest you, tailor the learning to what you want to focus on.  Of course, he’ll make sure that you have the fundamentals covered, language, arithmancy, that sort of thing, but Bertram would be qualified to instruct on anything from Pureblood magical rituals to Defense.”
As he thought about it, though, the hope quickly diffused.  He didn’t want Draco to stay with him out of obligation.  Harry had spent so long feeling like he was on the outside looking in.  With the Dursley’s, desperate for them to act like he was anything other than a burden.  With his teachers at Hogwarts, longing for them to see him as something more than a weapon.  Even with the Weasleys, who had treated him more like a member of the family than anyone before had done, Harry still felt that he didn’t quite belong, like he was an interloper.
Ron stares at me for a very long time.  Finally, he says, “You know, that’s a really good question.”
But it was the centre spread that captivated Draco.  In it, he’d lost the suit jacket and tie, and his shirt was unbuttoned a bit, revealing just a tease of chest hair.  It was a close-up shot, and Harry looked steadily at the camera.  He’d removed his glasses, and his green eyes were enormous, and stood out against his pale skin.  At first, the image appeared to be Muggle-style.  Harry didn’t move at all.  Until, suddenly, the corner of his mouth turned up into a wicked smirk, and his eyes sparkled.  Draco had cut out the photo, hidden it behind a dubiously-legal ward in his bedside drawer.  He hardly looked at it all.
He was absently cleaning his sink for the third time that day when he had a thought.  Suppose she wasn’t buying the potion pre-made, but was brewing it herself?  Draco knew that Ashwinder eggs were a restricted substance, and since they were certainly what had caused Harry’s reaction, he was absolutely sure that they’d been used in the potion.  He quickly scribbled a note, and cast a quick
“Course,” Harry answered, tamping down his prickling instincts.  It wasn’t the beer that was a problem.  He and Ron often enjoyed a drink together, but usually they did so in the Granger-Weasley back yard, or at Harry’s place, or occasionally, in the Quidditch locker rooms.
Luna doesn’t look at him, not once, until the funeral is over, and they’re all back at the Manor, lounging around in trackies, and drinking beer.  Harry has known that this conversation has been inevitable, but he wishes futilely for more time.  He’d spent a lot of the evening locked to Draco’s side, hoping that it would protect him…surely no one would be so insensitive as to bring up bad blood while Draco was grieving?
His Other Half took a step forward, twirling the dagger around his fingers. ”Only one of us can live while the other survives, Harry.” In one swift movement, the blade was pushed harshly against Harry’s neck, a bead of his blood mixing with Draco’s. “Or did you forget?”
The top of Draco’s nose and his cheeks have turned pink from the cold, his blush so severe that it contrasts vividly with his pale skin. Harry watches as Draco shivers and leans into him for warmth.
would save Harry’s life but destroy his own. If only the spell hadn’t rebounded and hit his attacker. If only the spell hadn’t been fatal, resulting in the man bleeding out on the cobblestone floor of Diagon Alley.
Logically, Draco knows Harry will be okay on this mission as he has been many times before. Taking down the Ministry isn’t an easy task, yet Harry has executed each murder with taught accuracy and innate endurance.
Harry’s heart dropped, a sudden realization of what had taken place clouding his brain. His Other Half pulled down the hem of his shirt to reveal inky black lines spreading from his heart. “You didn’t think you could get rid of the darkness completely did you? You didn't think
There was a brief moment of silence before he spoke again. “You are a terrifying work of art, Harry Potter.”
I exhale and silently wrap my arms around him, glancing at the moon. In a week, we will wait for the full moon, the day where the light will outshine the dark.
etched in ink scrawled across my chest. Right under the words lie the heavy pieces of my broken heart.
“I don’t relate to you,” I say, enunciating. The words push past my lips in a rush, rage lacing each syllable. Kiran wasn’t asking for clarification, I know. “If I even had a
Harry grasps Draco’s face in his hands, the red of the sky illuminating his tears. “You’ll be with me
“How is he? Did he know?” asked Harry nervously. Draco was very observant after all. “Did he tell you about his Potions apprenticeship? He’s been very excited about it.”
The path isn’t always linear, but in hindsight, he sees a future with Draco. What comes after the storm and the loss?
I stand up as Draco hesitantly tries to interrupt him. I turn away from the pale glow of the moon and face the darkness.
Scorpius unfurled Harry’s clenched fist, the dark and eerie glow of the Resurrection Stone illuminating the room.
“You’re fucking crazy,” Kiran says, doubling over in pain. He looks up at us, his eyes glazed in pain. “Both of you. I’m more than he deserves, anyway.”
A rustle from a nearby bush caught Harry’s attention and he turned around, a feeling of excitement running through his veins. His Other Half smiled, the twitch of his lip and furrow of his brow slightly menacing.
“No, love,” said Harry. “Papa’s in the other room, darling. He’s in his study, remember? Making some Pepper-Up for you?”
The Minister didn’t plead for his life, Harry recalled disdainfully. Wandless and bound, Shacklebolt inclined his head and muttered, “I told Albus he would one day break you.” He muttered a helpless laugh, gazing at Harry as disappointment bled from his soul. “Look at who you are. Look at what you’ve become.”
Harry could not live without either of them, and they could not exist without all of him. At least, that’s what his Other Half had said.
“Excuse me,” I say, my eyes narrowing as I sit up. I can feel a spark within me ignite. “What did you say?”
Since then, two other Ministry workers were found dead, and one had yet to be found. The one that remained to be found was under the floorboards of his family home, his Ministry badge pinned to his pajamas. His wand was snapped in two, the words
“How do you know?” Ron lifts his head and cocks an eyebrow, suspicion suddenly rising. “There’s very little information regarding—”
Harry doesn’t dream anymore. He lives in the past, a memory of his own making where the sun never sets.
This moment is bittersweet, he knows. A minute of eternal bliss before everything gets ripped away. The calm before the storm, the happiness before the loss. The tension is palpable, and the knowledge of what comes after is almost unfathomable.
“Papa just came back,” Scorp mumbled, turning his head and looking fondly at the rocking chair. “He wants me to follow him.”
With a resounding and unexpected pop, he Dispparates, the oppressive energy of his presence slowly dissipating. Draco flinches.
causes my body to tense. As I gaze at Draco’s shuttered expression, an incessant need to protect compels me to speak up.
Kiran stands up slowly, head cocked with contempt. His dark black hair falls over his eyes, framing his face.
The dirt-stained envelope is freezing in his hands, the lingering essence of Dementors clinging to Draco’s carefully crafted letter. His words reek of despair, of longing, of sadness. Draco’s big personality has been contained to one solid, cold cell. An abundance of emotions conveyed on one torn, thin paper.
, Harry. And I haven’t forgotten what he did to us when we were children. It’s truly a shame he had to get caught up in your destructive life.”
They’ve tested the spell on innumerable victims, Muggles and Wizards alike. All trials had been a success, ending with the same result: untraceable death and merciless victory.
Scorpius had a lingering fever that had been causing him extreme distress for the past month. Like any father would, Harry stood by his bed, unable to let the boy out of his sight in fear that his son might vanish while he was asleep.
The glow of the moon seems to dim as a hushed scoff reaches my ears. The threatening tone of Kiran’s mouth forming the words
Scorpius smiled and blinked, his green eyes blanching to pure white as his tanned brown skin began to peel, layers falling away like flower petals. Scorpius was crying, bright red tears streaming down his face. “It’s time to wake up, Daddy.”
“Will you remember me?” asks Draco, a moment later, voice small and hesitant. The fragile tension around them breaks, and silky tears laced with fond memories slip from his eyes.
His Other Half looked almost identical to him, his messy black hair tumbling over his forehead and tan warm skin inviting. There were small differences in their appearance, however. His Other Half’s scar was jagged and a more vivid red against his skin, almost as if it had been carved with a knife. His green eyes were darker, the weight of the cruel world reflected in them. Harry paid no mind; they looked similar enough.
The spell is entirely untraceable; Harry and Draco made sure of that. No light is emitted, no color is shown, no sound is expelled. No physical or magical brands mar the victim’s body.
As the last trembles of life fade from the victim, Harry raises his gaze to Draco. A maniac glint is embedded in his molten silver eyes, sharpening his handsome pale features. His cheeks are flushed with success and anticipation.
I watch as Draco maps the sky with his tales and paints the moon with his words. The excitement in his voice is enough to captivate me, to pull me into his orbit. The only thing that could ruin this moment is 一
Draco looks to his side and grins as the Minister’s wand lies uselessly on the table. It was not easy to steal, but it was necessary to ensure the operation’s completion. Tied directly — almost tangibly — to Minister Shacklebolt’s life source, the wand is the only object that will prove their success.
Draco was the sunset, ethereal and graceful, loving and snarky. He was a diamond, his glowing blonde hair and porcelain skin like the moon. Harry fell in love with his cool gaze and sharp retorts. Some days he thought he could love Draco and

“For today, I’d like to ask you a few more questions, and we’ll mostly just watch the situation for the next little while.”
!  Since when do we come into the office on the weekends?  You’re going to raise the bar, set unnecessarily high standards,” Harry teased, settling into her guest chair.
“No, Potter, stop.  I…apologize for insulting you.  It’s…there, there.”  Draco edged a tentative step closer to the baby and, mustering up every ounce of courage he’d ever possessed, reached out and patted Potter’s arm.  Potter, in turn, lifted his arms beseechingly, and sobbed.  “Merlin fuck,” Draco muttered.  The baby continued to cry, and Draco continued to panic.  It took him several minutes to muster up his resolve, but finally, with a shudder, he picked Potter up and held him at arm’s length.  Potter clung to Draco’s arms, and like an octopus, tried to pull himself closer.
Harry dropped the piece of toast he was eating, raced to the Apparation Point, and apparated away as he was reading the Galleon.  Code Orange indicated that a magical child had been injured while under the supervision of Muggles.  Since Muggle medicine was rarely helpful, and often harmful to magical children, it was Harry’s job to intervene before the medics took him to hospital.
“Some people died that night,” Harry says, “but it just took their bodies a bit longer to catch up.  It doesn’t mean that we grieve them any less.”  He gets up, goes inside and takes a turn sitting with Dean.
“I’ve lost him, Mother.  Lost him forever.”  He didn’t cry, but it was a near thing.  For the first time since he’d been a child of eleven, his mother knelt on the floor beside him, gathered him into her arms, and pressed gentle kisses on his forehead.
be objective about Malfoy’s parenting.  He’d moved on from the war, and gotten rid of his old prejudices.  He
Draco perched uneasily on the couch.  The baby, who had been snuggled in his Grandmother’s arms, reached for Draco, but when he moved to pick him up, Andromeda said “No.  I prefer not.”
“Harry help,” Harry said in a whisper, but the look of fear on his face suggested that he thought that this might be some sort of prank.
Harry hadn’t wanted much when the war ended.  He said a polite ‘no thank you,’ to the Aurors, and a less-polite ‘fuck no’ to the Minister, who wanted him to be some sort of Ambassador.  Fortunately, Kingsley had laughed, told him that he hadn’t expected him to accept, and wished him luck in what he
“Yeah,” Harry said softly, his eyes never leaving his daughter’s graceful form.  “It’s in her blood, Draco.  She was born to do this.”  He grinned at Draco, his eyes alight, and then took off into the air, where he swooped close to Cass.  Draco could hear their laughter and his heart swelled.  He’d never imagined that he’d experience this.  He kicked off and headed into the sky to join his daughter and her other father, his heart thumping maddeningly in his chest.
“It is, though,” she argued.  “He told me I was the most important person in the world, but he just left me.  The minute that there was someone else who could take me.”
Draco finished his routine with a set of pullups.  He loathed pull-ups, but his coach had been unyeilding in his criticism of Draco’s shoulder muscles, and he acknowledged that they needed work.  He began the set, concentrating on his form.  He’d thrown his t-shirt over by the towels before he started running, and was wearing only a vest.  As he leapt lightly down from the pull up bars and pulled the t-shirt over his head, he thought he spotted a familiar look in Harry’s eyes.  Did Harry still think he looked fit?  A tiny, mulish part of his brain hoped so, hoped that Harry found this a fraction as difficult as Draco did.
Later, after he’d finished filing his reports at the Ministry, and come home, he felt exhausted, but completely unable to sleep.  He slumped into his armchair by the fire, wrung out and sad, and sent some good thoughts to a little boy who had an uncertain future.
His face looked so desperate, that Astoria took pity on him.  “Okay.  Cass will be fine here, and although we would also love you to stay, I see that you have something that requires your urgent attention.  You should come back at eight to pick her up.  Can you promise me something though?”
“We could spend all day apologizing for things that happened.  Or, we could start over.  Maybe have a drink?”
“This is your first Pureblood funeral, isn’t it Harry?” Neville asks, and Harry sends him a relieved smile as he nods.
When he returned home, late that night, Harry was tired, and bit discouraged.  Ron and Hermione had come home speaking in polite, clipped tones, and when Harry caught Ron’s eye, he simply shook his head sadly.    Hurting for his friends, he lay awake long into the night, wishing he could make things better for them.
Harry ignored her completely, his eyes still on Draco.  He’d gotten quiet during the excitement of Ginny’s arrest, and was watching Draco as if he held the secrets of the universe.
A whisper of a memory, more emotion than thought, ripples through me at his words, and I’m overcome by rage.  Despite Draco’s tugging pull on me, I’m on my feet before I know it, and the words escape me without any conscious planning.  “How dare you!”
“May I?”  Harry extended his hand, and Narcissa’s healing spells felt like a cool bath.  He flexed it experimentally.  “Better?”
Something in Harry’s face hardened then.  His jaw twitched and his hands clenched.  “Don’t leave on my account, Draco.  I don’t give a fuck what you do.”  He darted around Draco and into the kitchen.  “Why don’t I have a drink?” he growled.  The rest of the kitchen roared its approval, and a beer and a cup of the disgusting orange stuff was placed into his hands.
“Hmm,” I say.  I can’t say I love the hero complex thing, but it would appear I’ve made a career of it.
supportive of his intent to give up on Harry and make a life of his own.  It hurt, the acknowledgement that it wasn’t going to happen, but he knew that it wasn’t doing him any good to sit around moping.  (Even if he did indulge in a little mope from time to time.  He wasn’t perfect, after all.)  The worst part was how aggressively she adjusted his treatment plan.  She’d been content before to lead him slowly down the path to improved mental health, but it appeared that she was simply waiting for him to find the motivation in himself before she put the pressure on.
“That’s my fault,” Papa said, in a broken, strange voice, after the silence stretched between them.  “Not your Dad’s.”
“I mean it Draco.  I just…I don’t understand why.”  His voice wobbled a little on the last syllable, drawing it out in a shaky tremor.
“Thank you,” she replies, just as politely.  “No longer being pregnant does a lot for one’s figure.”
me.  It’s different.  And the press has always had trouble deciding if I was a nutter seeking attention, or some type of Saviour character.  No matter which side they land on, they still seem to care what I eat for breakfast.”
“From start to finish, we expect you sleep about two hours.  Everything should be finished before lunchtime.  Alright then, I’ll leave you all to get changed, and you can kiss your parents goodnight, and then we’ll be back in to give you the draughts.” Cici gave them all a big smile, and she and Healer Mancini exited, shutting the door behind them.
“What do you want?” his words weren’t unkind, just a bit dismissive, as though Draco were an inconvenient caller, disrupting Neville from his tea.  For all Draco knew, that was exactly what he was.
“Merlin’s nuts, Potter,” Pansy breathes.  “How the fuck did you do that?  You just apparated through the Ministry’s wards!  And the Malfoy’s.”
Harry gave a longing look to the window, where a bright sunny day beckoned, but said, “Oh, I don’t mind.  I can help you with potions, if you like.”
“Anything is possible, but I doubt that.  Draco Malfoy is many things, but he isn’t a fool.  And anyone who isn’t delighted to know you is obviously foolish.”
“Finally, I got enough courage to go inside, and that was the day that I apologized to you for all of the animosity during school.  I didn’t want to die with that still on my conscience.  It was one of the only things I could do anything about.  Most of the people I wronged during the War are too...dead to apologize to.  I bought the poison that day, came home fully intending to use it.
And, even if he found the courage to lay his heart bare, to ask Harry to stay for a while, he wasn't sure whether Harry would trust him enough to remain.  Long ago, Draco had made fun of Harry’s immense ability to trust and forgive, but he wasn't sure that was true any longer.   No matter, he resolved, as he followed the birthday celebration to the dining room, he'd convince Harry to give them a chance.  For Cass' sake.  For Draco and Harry's sake.  He’d figure it out, Draco promised himself.
“Mother!” Draco’s voice was appalled, and angry, and the unexpected volume and tone caused Harry’s lower lip to tremble and he immediately started crying frightened sobs.  Kreacher clucked in dismay and reached for the baby, but Draco beat him to Harry’s side.  “Hush, Harry, I’m sorry.  Did that frighten you?  It’s okay.”  Without thinking, he gathered the baby close, and rubbed his back.
“How could he be so fucking stupid?” Dean roars, flinging a canvas at the wall.  “He wouldn’t stop!  I tried everything to make him stop, but he was so fucking stubborn, and he just kept hurting himself!”  Dean is really doing a number on his studio, but Harry understands this.  The guilt, and the helplessness, and the agonizing hole where your heart should be.
Harry grinned.  “Yes,” he said with feeling.  “Cass started summoning things when she was two.  It drove me mental, because she’d never do it when I could see.  I’d just find her in her playpen with a plate of cookies.  She’s also an intuitive thought reader, and when she’s connected with someone, she has to work hard to avoid sensing their thoughts.”
She was as hesitant as a fawn as she crossed the room towards him.  She nudged his feet from the ottoman, and perched on the edge, wrapping her skinny arms around herself.  “I’m angry with you,” she admitted.
“Oh,” I say blithely.  “Sorry for stealing your inheritance, Draco.  Can I offer you, what I'm positive is an old spooky house and an elf who makes excellent breakfasts?”
Shit, he’s abruptly, poshly, furious now.  “Who told you about my sexual orientation, and how dare you make it into some sort of joke?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said suddenly.  “Sorry I didn’t tell you sooner.  I robbed you of a lot of her life, and…” He trailed off, unable to complete this thought.
“He’s malnourished.  His bone density is off.”  Draco’s anxiety rose.  He’d known that he’d fuck up the potion.  This was all his fault.  He was going to produce some sort of tiny, maladjusted Harry Potter.  He never should have done this.  He should have sent Harry to St. Mungo’s.
“Normally, you’d be so fixated on understanding the hidden plot that you’d lose sight of the bigger picture,” Ron supplies.
“Heyy,” Harry said softly, wanting nothing more than to give this tiny, hurting child a hug, but keeping his distance. “It seems like you feel sad about that.”
It’s a lot scarier when he knows it’s coming, but Draco’s face is so beautiful, and his voice is so kind that Harry nods.  His eyes instinctively close as Draco leans closer, and when their lips touch, it’s even better than the last time.
know that you're mad at him.  I get why you're upset.  But you don’t get to use me as some sort of stick to hit him with.
Harry clambered up, patting the duvet gently and saying “Harry bed,” something he’d done every single time he saw the thing.  Draco hadn’t the faintest idea why Harry was so delighted with it.  It was a perfectly normal bed.  It didn’t even have posts or curtains.  Nevertheless, Harry was looking at them expectantly, and, with a slightly fearful look.
I’m distracted by my wavering surroundings and we’re into another memory.  It’s taken from the perspective of a set of rings at the end of a pitch, and there are red and green robed broom riders swooping about.  Two such players hover high above the rest.  I assume this is one of Ron’s memories, and he’s watching the play, while also casting the odd look up at the small blond and dark haired figures.  Suddenly, the darker one abruptly dives, directly in the direction of the rings, quickly followed by the blond.  They jostle for position as they streak through the air, until finally, the darker one, who I confirm is a younger me, lunges forward and snatches a shimmering gold orb out of the air.  The blond, who, of course, is Draco lets out a howl of frustration, and collides with small Harry.  In the instant before the memory shifts away, I spy a look of such joyful glee on younger Harry’s face that so captivates me, I barely notice the surroundings shift.
“Pans, I’ve told you.  I’ve been living like a Muggle for the past four years.  It’s difficult to be inconspicuous with an owl, and the hotels I stay in aren’t part of the floo network.”
I turn and leave the courtroom. Draco and I both had been summoned to testify in the proceedings, but they have our memories, and our statements, and they’ll simply have to make do without me.  I am finished with dancing to their purposes.
I raise my eyebrows.  “Formal notice of my resignation, of course.  I can’t possibly support a Ministry that doesn’t support equality for all.  And I can’t work for a Minister that doesn’t allow my past actions to speak for my character.  I wish you the best, Kingsley.”
The great piss-ups continue each month, with an ever-rotating list of attendees.  Harry realizes, at one such occasion, as he sits across the table from Draco Malfoy and Greg Goyle, that
“No, no, we’ve hashed that all out, you don’t need to say anything,” Harry said.  “This is just hard.  It’s scary to say this.”  He continued, “I don’t think that a relationship like that would be healthy for me.  I know that I need to define my life on my own terms.”
Harry moved closer to the bed, and, with a glance at Cici to make sure it was alright, climbed up beside his daughter and wrapped his arms around her.  Draco could see him whispering in her ear.  Draco gestured Cici to the door and stepped out into the hall.
“Dad sent him to Hogwarts.  He died, a few years ago.  It was the first time that Dad seriously considered coming back, but Uncle Professor told him to take his bleeding heart sentiments out to the shop and stop moping around.”
.  Draco wondered if he could simply flee, but, in a heartbeat, the scrutiny subsided.  A few people nodded at him, and the rest simply returned their attention to the blender.  Which, it seemed, none of them could figure out how to operate.
Harry is sure he’s going mad.  He wants to go to Luna, to scream at her for disturbing the peace he’d found after the war.
The fort wasn’t there.  Nothing was.  The hollow stretched back up into another hill, and, other than a lone sheep who appeared to have wandered in by accident, there was no sign of life.  “That’s odd,” George said conversationally.  He seemed to be taking the entire situation in stride and had an odd look in his eyes, as though this were the most excitement he’d seen in weeks.
“Ginny!” He’s roaring now, and I cast a wary eye towards Hermione to see what she makes of it all.  She’s looking a little nonplussed herself, so perhaps this is out of character after all.  “And it’s not…well, it is, of course it is about Ginny, but it’s also about Draco Fucking Malfoy!”  As he screams the last bit of that sentence, I rear back a little.  His face is absolutely bright red, and he’s spat on the table as he yelled.  Seems Ron’s not a fan of this Malfoy bloke.  Too bad for him.  I try his first name out, silent on my tongue…Draco. I like the way it feels.
“They aren’t,” he bites out.  “They aren’t members of our society.  They lost, and once we eliminate them, only decent people will remain.”
“Cici,” Draco said, feeling fear creep back, replacing all the relief he’d just felt.  “She will wake up eventually, right?”
“That’s my fault,” Harry said.  “I asked Healer Arden if he could wait until you’d arrived to wake him.  I thought Scorpius would be more easily reassured if his Dad was here.”
That made Cass feel a little better.  At least he hadn’t forgotten about her.  “Do you think he’s okay?”
The letters to Ron and Hermione, Luna, Neville and Molly and Arthur were difficult, but Harry muddled his way through them, leaving the most difficult one for last.  He started the letter several times, and on each attempt, balled the latest effort up and vanished it.  In the end, he took the coward’s route, and merely penned:
“Don’t,” he says sharply.  “Harry, I’m barely hanging on.  If you’re kind to me right now, I’ll fall apart and I won’t get through this.”
“You liked the training,” Ron says.  “Duelling and learning spells.  After we made Junior Aurors though, it was a lot of politics.  When it wasn’t about risking our lives.”
He was back quickly enough, and they flooed to the Manor.  Unsurprisingly, Narcissa had everything in hand, so they sat on the terrace with tea, awaiting any instructions.  “Does Cass usually have big birthday parties?” Draco asked.
Cass gave him a funny look that Draco, in his distraction over all of his conflicting emotions, couldn’t begin to interpret.  “Yeah, I know.  I’d like to see,” she said.
“You’re overthinking this, Harry.  Did you stop to question how to fly, how to catch the snitch?  Of course not.  From the moment you took off after Neville’s Rememberall, you went by instinct.  Now, we’ve protected all your breaky bits, so just stop thinking.  Just catch me.”  With that, Draco took off down the ice at a fairly slow pace, pivoting on his right skate to give Harry a cheeky look and skated backwards to watch what happened next.
“By the look on your face, I think that this is exactly where you’re meant to be.  Will you come in and have some tea, lad?”
It takes nearly a week of uncomfortable indecision before I finally agree to have Hermione restore my memories.  I’m fearful of the consequences of my action, but I have to admit, living this sort of bland life, where I never particularly feel anything, would soon grow awfully boring.  Draco assures me that this leap of faith with little consideration of risk is fully in character for me.
Pansy arrived at six on the dot, wearing a form fitting jersey dress over dragonhide boots.  Her hair was short and spiky, and her makeup was done impeccably.  A tiny diamond stud glinted in her left nostril.  She looked a lot cooler than Harry remembered from school, and he suspected that her Pureblood parents didn’t approve of her very Muggle attire.
He rang the doorbell of the only house that had lights on.  A beefy man answered the door, his face harassed and red, and demanded, “What is it?”
“I dunno,” I say, and for a moment, I really don’t know.  “I can’t tell you why that bloke was closeted, but last night, when I was grinding on that Malfoy guy in the bar, it was pretty clear which way the wind was blowing.”
“Harry.” His face is so sad that I stand, and almost reach out to him when I remember.  He broke up with me.  He might not want me to touch him at all. I stand a little awkwardly.  Maybe he’s here to to ask me to leave.  “I know we have things we need to talk about," he says.  "We need to sort out, Merlin...everything, but I’m honestly so exhausted that I just can’t right now.”
Draco’s grey eyes were wide and he was staring at Harry in horror.  “Potter,” he said, his voice choked, “I never knew.”
“Of course I can, darling.  If your dad says it’s okay, we’ll bring you to Scorpius’ Healer, and she will take some samples of your blood.  It will sting just a little bit.  Scorpius has had it done many times, so he can tell you more about what to expect.  They’ll do some spells on your blood, to see whether it’s compatible with Scorpius’.  If it is, the healing team will likely want to do some additional testing on you, to make sure that you’re as healthy as you look, and that it won’t cause you any problems to donate your bone marrow.”
“Draco and Astoria Malfoy have a little boy named Scorpius.  He is four years old.  If he doesn’t receive treatment, he will surely die, and it would be unlikely that he would reach his sixth birthday.”
“Harry, I’ll never be able to make it up to you.  I wish things were different, Merlin, you have no idea how much I’d like to take it all back.”
, it had the added benefit of making them completely aware of the passage of time around them.  Aurors used it to subdue rioting Quidditch Fans, but Harry had found that, in the aftermath of accidental magic, it gave him the ability to take stock.
“Hello again, Potter,” Draco said.  Potter’s chubby face was suddenly wreathed in an enormous grin as he raised his arms to be picked up.  “No thank you,” Draco said politely, but firmly.  Potter’s arms bobbed for a second, and he tilted his head in confusion before letting out a huffy little sigh and lowering them.  Looking determined, he focused on extracting himself from the towel he’d been wrapped in, and set off to crawl towards Draco.
“Well, you must realize that society would never support someone of your…background being seen with someone of Harry’s notoriety.  He is under enormous pressure to provide stability to our world.”
“I’m sorry for coming here.  I’m such a dick for coming here.  I just missed you.  I missed touching you, being with you, but I also missed my best friend.”
“That I’d hate the decisions I’ve made since I lost my memories.  That I’d regret the changes I made.  That I’d regret Draco.”
“That’s a lovely name,” Harry replied.  “Is this your Mum and Dad?”  Violet nodded.  “And is this your house?”  Another nod.  “Well, because I’m very good at sorting out mysteries, I’m going to also say that it’s your birthday party.  How old are you, Violet?”
I laugh, and agree.  “Yay.”  I don’t feel like I’m going to expire of satiated lust any longer, and so I maneuver him closer.  He lays his head on my chest, and I wriggle my arm underneath him, so that I can hold him tightly.  I stroke his side, and he giggles, which is, frankly, adorable.  “Draco Malfoy, you’re ticklish?” I ask in delight.
wanted to be the one that everyone was afraid of, so he started picking on Dudley.  I knew it was crazy, knew that Dudley would never do the same for me, but I just felt like I had to protect him.  And so, even though I knew I’d get flattened, I got in between them.”
After returning his Mother to the Manor, and changing his clothes, Draco apparated into London.  He wasn’t far from Harry’s place, but he found himself walking rather aimlessly.  He watched the couples he passed with detached interest, seeing them holding hands, exchanging words, and smiles.  And still, he walked, and walked, until his feet were tired, and he wasn’t sure where he was anymore.  As it got later, and the crowds of people thinned, Draco continued walking.
“I understand.”  Draco swallows, his face a study in grief.  “If he is dead, I would still wish to bring him to his ancestral home, to bury him with kin.”
It was a matter of moments to arrive at Luna’s strange, rook-shaped home.  Malcolm didn’t enjoy apparation, and was sick into the dirigible plum bush, but Harry assured him that Luna wouldn’t mind.  He knocked on the door, Malcolm shivering like a leaf beside him.  Luna opened the door and regarded them both for a moment.
Scorpius was silent for a long moment.  It looked as though he were trying to summon up the courage to say something.  Harry waited patiently, even though his stomach was roiling.  “Please, please don’t take me away from my Papa!”
“Every so often, a patient can react poorly to sleeping draughts.  It’s exceedingly rare.  If Cass is one such patient, we’ll have to monitor her.”
I know that I have to hear the rest of Hermione’s story, but I keep putting it off, insisting that we check on Scorpius, and go feed (fucking) Wendell, and coerce him into writing a sick note to his boss at the Ministry to buy us some time.  Eventually though, with the note owled off to the Department of Mysteries, and Scorpius fed and put back to bed, there’s nothing further to occupy us, and I’ve run out of excuses.
The lawyer and Gringott’s guy will be at the Manor early.  You were sleeping so peacefully I didn’t want to wake you.  Thank you for last night.  Truly.
“Potter, there’s clearly something else you want.”  Draco knows his voice sounds impatient, but he wants to know.
The air outside is cool, compared to the stifling heat of the dance floor.  I lean against the bricks, my eyes half closed, the too-strong drink making my senses blur.  He stands in front of me, his legs wide, knees surrounding mine.  He presses close, his cock hard against my groin.  The friction is bliss.  He kisses me, but he’s too enthusiastic, all tongue and spit, and alcohol breath.  I push him backwards a little.  “Why don’t you put that mouth to use somewhere else?”
Draco huffs and returns to his work.  The bell on the door rings almost immediately afterward, and Draco shouts, “I said go away, Potter!”
“Merlin, Hermione, give everyone else a chance, would you?”  Hermione laughed and moved inside.  Harry stepped back to let Ron and his parents in.  Ron looked at him appraisingly, and said, “You’re still a shortarse, Harry, but you’re a sight for sore eyes.”  He gave Harry and equally bone-crushing hug, and whispered into his ear, “I know you had your reasons, mate, but I missed you.”
“Why would I want to help you with anything?” His voice is bored, and he’s lowered his head to resume scrutiny of a shining goblet on his desk, which he pokes with his wand.  Still though, there’s something in his tone.  He’s curious, if nothing else.
“So why are you exploring a clinical trial?  As I understand it, Muggle-based treatments don’t always produce expected results in magical patients.  Are the other treatment options unsuited to Scorpius?”
Weasley’s words completely disarmed Draco.  The ginger nuisance was right.  Potter deserved a chance.  “Fine,” Draco said resignedly.  “but I’ll need your help figuring out what he’s on, and you have to make
The morning of Cass’ birthday dawned bright and sunny, and Draco was thrilled that the stubborn English weather had chosen to cooperate.  Cass wanted a party at the Manor, and his parents' house elves had been working flat-out to get ready, with Narcissa barking orders like a drill sergeant.  Harry appeared through Draco's floo, his cheeks pink and his eyes bright.  “Morning, Draco,” he said. “I’ve got our brooms!  It’s great weather for a fly.”
She storms from the store, muttering under her breath about speaking to the Prophet.  Potter immediately turns to Draco.  “Draco,” he says, his voice gentle.  “Are you alright?”
He smiled, a bit bitterly.  “If you hadn’t blundered in and startled me, I can’t imagine what would have happened.  Instead, you managed to thoroughly ground me, and likely saved my life.  Ironic, really.”
I make it until noon the next day before the walls start feeling like they’re closing in on me.  I’d already had a leisurely wank in the shower, during which I pictured Draco’s long slim fingers in place of my own.  I clean the flat, I practice magic from the first-year spell book that Hermione had provided, but there are a ton of spells that are, frankly, ridiculous.  Why would I want to turn a rat into a goblet?  It couldn’t possibly be sanitary to drink from.
Minerva had retired by the time he arrived, but Severus was reading in his comfy chair within the portrait.  “Hi,” Harry said quietly.
“Yes.  Yes.  I want that.  I want you.”  Draco knew he was babbling, but he was so fucking relieved.  He’d been given his life back.
They apparated from the Glasgow Portkey Terminal to Hogsmeade, and Harry had accumulated a splitting headache to accompany his roiling stomach.  Minerva discretely passed him a potion, and he swallowed it gratefully.  “Cheers, Min.  You’re a lifesaver, truly.”  It was the dinner hour, and Harry was grateful that people, for the most part, were occupied indoors with their meals, and not watching Harry Potter’s triumphant return to Scotland.
“Harry Potter.  You are welcome at this school, day or night, for as long as I live.  Hogwarts is your home.  Now come and tell me what’s the matter.”
Lara, unsurprisingly, was not in favour of Draco’s newly appointed role of nanny to the Saviour of the Wizarding World.  “You do like to bite off more than you can chew,” she remarked.
“I work for the DMCA.  I’m an integration specialist.  Normally, I go ‘round telling little First-Gen wixes about Magic, and help prepare them for Hogwarts.  Sometimes, with kids like Scorpius, I help with frequent magical outbursts.”
“Your birthday is over, and so we need to decide what happens now.  Scorpius is, thank Merlin, all better, so we don’t have to stay, but I wanted to know what you'd like.”  Cass bit her lip, in such a Harry-esque gesture that he smiled.  “Don’t worry about how I’m going to take the news, just tell me.”
“So, to summarize,” Harry began, “after having my life dictated to me by a bloody prophesy and a half-mad Headmaster, when I finally found happiness for myself, the person who was responsible for that happiness-" Draco’s voice made a strange choking noise then, the mention of him making Harry happy breaking his heart all over again.  “If you please,” Harry commanded, with a wave of his hand.  “As I was saying, the person who was the source of my newfound happiness decided that, when faced with someone who didn’t approve of my choices, he’d simply make the decision for me?  Does that accurately summarize your story?”
I should, and I do.  It’s clear that Mill needs the attention diverted from her for a moment anyway.  The owl is from Draco, and I can’t quell the anticipatory lust I feel from seeing his name written at the bottom of the parchment.
Cici explained the testing, and what would happen if the children’s blood was compatible.  When she finished her explanation, Harry cleared his throat.  “Would I be able to ask a couple of questions?”
Later, Draco would be unable to remember whether he kissed Harry first, or if Harry had kissed him, but it didn’t matter, because once their lips met, nothing mattered other than holding him close.  The puppy squirmed between them, and someone cleared their throat pointedly, which caused them to break apart, blushing.  “Er, well, it’s been a long trip, and I forgot to give him a chance to wee before I brought him in.  Harry, maybe we should take him outside for a bit?”  Draco said finally.
Harry’s forehead creased in thought for a moment before he grinned at Draco, tiny milk teeth on display.  “Fuh!”
“Oh Draco.” Hermione looked pained.  “I don’t know what happened between you, but…Harry was shattered when you left.  It was really terrible for a long time.  You have no idea how much you hurt him.”
“As far as I can see, the last Dark Lord was out to exclude those who were of ‘impure blood’ from society.  Are you intent on doing the same to Purebloods now?”
“You too, little duck.”  Cass flinched a bit at the pet name, but kept her smile firmly on her lips, and then waved as she headed to her Healer’s office.
.  “Draco,” Harry said out loud.  “There’s no easy way to give information like this, and I realize it’s quite surprising, but Cass is your daughter.”
Draco almost laughed.  Only Luna would refer to being held hostage in his family’s dungeon as ‘staying with him’.  “Are you well, Luna?”
“I like the ones that are true best,” she agrees, and I follow her to the breakfast table, shaking my head at her wild imagination.
Since the healer had grown up in the United States, and had very little understanding of the war against Voldemort, John didn’t react at all, save saying, “Oh, my mistake.  Mr. Malfoy.  Scorpius is expected to be perfectly fine.  He is magically exhausted, and there were a number of small lacerations.”
“Your wand.  From…” She didn’t finish, but Draco knew instantly what she meant.  Without prompting, his mind deposited him into a hall at Malfoy Manor, and a tense standoff with his Aunt Bella, and his wand disappearing with a puffy-faced boy.  Draco didn’t like to think about what happened when Potter and his friends had disappeared.
“Hi Draco,” Harry said softly, and his eyes barely flickered to meet Draco’s before they flitted away.
Luna is shocked, he can tell.  Harry knows that he’s awfully easy-going, and he normally takes his friends’ need to interfere in his life with awkward good grace.  “I wasn’t judging-”
He knows that voice.  Knows it in his heart, and in his soul.  It’s tattooed on his bones, and written in his brain.  His treacherous brain, which is obviously mocking him now, determined to finish the job, and drive him so mad that he just dies here on his kitchen floor.  There’s a louder bang on the door, followed by a quick muttered charm, and the sound of the door opening.  “Draco?”
“Oh no!  We are friends, actually.  My name’s Hannah.  Hannah Longbottom.  My husband Neville was your dorm mate at Hogwarts.”
“Harry, this is…I’ll never be able to repay you,” she says, her voice wavering on the edge of tears.
“I understand.” The Goblin, who is remarkably uncurious about my curse, pulls out an enormous book, which he leafs through until he reaches the ‘P’ section.  “You, Harry Potter, were the sole Heir of the Potter estate at your parents’ death in 1981, which was, obviously, held in trust for you by Albus Dumbledore until you reached your majority.  At that point, the estate was valued at nine hundred thousand Galleons.  I have been responsible for the management of the Potter estate for four generations now, and since your inheritance, the Potter holdings are, as of this morning, worth one point four million galleons.  In addition, you inherited the Black estate as the named Heir upon the death of Sirius Black III, which is currently worth around five hundred thousand Galleons.  This of course, does not include the value of the real estate holdings of the Black and Potter families.”
“Nah, I trust you, Draco,” Ron replied, giving them both an easy grin.  “Don’t stay out playing with potions too late, ‘Mione,”
As the calendar flips over to the next year, and people drift in and out of their haphazardly assembled group of refugees to this new world, Hermione and Ron get married.  The wedding is beautiful.  Hermione, in her white gown, with seed pearls sewn to the bodice, her hair pinned up and convinced to behave with copious amounts of Sleekeasy, is so radiant that Harry’s breath catches.  She’s regarding him through the mirror as Pansy touches up her lipstick, and she raises an eyebrow at him.  “You’re lovely,” he says simply, and her eyes moisten a little before Pansy screeches at him to stop ruining her work.
“No,” said Harry immediately.  Draco nodded, and returned to watching the sparrows.  It didn’t take long for Harry to say, “Gin’s mad, you know.”
They made arrangements for Cass to return for further testing two days hence, and flooed back to the Malfoys’ flat.  As Harry stepped across the grate, he saw a familiar figure sitting elegantly in an armchair by the window.  “Mrs. Malfoy,” he said, his voice wavering only a little.
“You think you have to protect me from everything.  But I know you, dad.  When you’re upset, I know it.  I feel it.  And I could help you, if you let me.  But you insist on doing it all by yourself.”
“Then it’s a pleasure to welcome you,” she replied, her face transforming into a sunny smile.  “I am Madame Lefebvre.”
“Oh, sure. That’s fine,” he said, the recalled emotions still churning through him.  He turned, and saw that Draco was standing in the doorway, looking at him.  Feeling awkward, he finally said, “She…uh…she likes Quidditch.  A lot.  If…um, you were looking for a way to start a conversation with her.”
When Minerva arrived at his doorstep the following morning, having been summoned from Hogwarts by a concerned Snape, he sobbed.  “I can’t do it,” he wept.  “Can you take her?  Give her to someone who can do this properly?”  She’d sent him to bed, and, when he’d awoken four hours later, patiently helped him get Cass on a proper sleep schedule.  It had gotten better, but he still remembered the feeling of being utterly alone, with no clue how to cope.  It had taken him years to stop doubting whether he was capable of being Cass’ dad.
Narcissa sighed.  “I failed him, Harry. I stayed silent, and compliant, and my selfish clinging to old ways, my sense of duty to my husband prevented me from standing up for the child for whom I would have given my life.”
The last photo in the album is one of me, and I look at it for a long time.  I’m absolutely filthy, for one thing, my denims ripped and one thin shoulder peeking out of my jumper.  My hair looks mad, but it seems that’s a fairly common occurrence.  I’m not looking at the camera, my attention captured by something behind the photographer, but I look…haunted.  I’m just a kid, but my expression is ancient, weary.  There’s smoke in the background, and I suddenly just know that this is taken after the last battle of the war.  Wondering again who would lay the fate of the world on the skinny shoulders of a seventeen year old kid, I close the album, and, with nothing better to do, I go to bed.
Cass gave him a little glare, and Harry grinned unrepentantly at her.  Until Draco murmured, sotto voce,  “Wonder where she gets that from.”  The smile faltered, until he noticed Cass looking at him, and he forced it back.
They make their way into the kitchen, and lots of people have arrived.  Neville and Gin, Ron and Hermione, Susan Bones, and Greg Goyle.  Luna is on the balcony, watering Blaise’s plants.  Harry makes his way to the kettle and starts to make tea, just as Draco and Pansy arrive through the floo.
“Malfoy!” Ron bellowed, sounding delighted, his face nearly as red as Mister Weasley’s had been.  “Come in!  You’re just in time!”
Fortunately, Harry returned with a sleepy-looking baby, who had an untidy mop of cerulean coloured hair. “Draco, meet Teddy Lupin.”
“Cass?”  Harry called, and Cass appeared from her room. “Cass, I’d like you to meet Pansy Parkinson.  She and I went to Hogwarts together, and she’s going to help us handle communications.  Pansy, this is my daughter, Cassiopeia Narcissa Potter.”
“Mrs. Weasley-Granger,” Draco said, his smile feeling tight around the edges, “thank you for meeting us on such short notice.”
“I told you, my housemates.  It’s impossible to tell in advance who will show up, but there’s usually a hardcore group who is always there.  It’s a very good time, Draco.”
“I thought you were done living in a cupboard while everyone else got to sit at the table,” she remarks, and although her tone is light, her eyes pierce him.  It feels like when he’d spoken to the snake and everyone had
“Very well.  I’ll send you formal notice within the week, Minister, but thank you for your consideration.”
Later that night, when Ron and Hermione had taken Rose home to put her to bed, Draco suggested that Harry put on his pyjamas, and they could have more hot cocoa before bedtime.  Harry had seemed to enjoy the cocoa earlier, and Draco really didn’t know what else to do with him.  When Harry had put on the pyjamas that Kreacher had set out for him, (these ones had Crups running all over them), he returned to the sitting room.  His hair was a wild mass of strange peaks, and his feet were bare.  “Are your feet chilly?” Draco asked.  “I can cast a warming charm on them.”
“It was,” he replied simply.  After all these years, his guilt and sorrow hadn’t fully abated.  It sat in his belly like a stone.  At times, he could forget about it, but, on days like these, when he was reminded of what he’d done, what he’d lost, it was heavy and foreign.  He’d tried so hard to avoid asking, but, unable to resist, he finally said, “Do you speak to him, ever?”
Harry replied, “We have to hide all of our magical items, because Cass goes to a Muggle school.  He’d fortunately escaped back to Hogwarts the day before.  Actually,” he looked shy and a bit vulnerable, as he pulled a small packet from his satchel and handed it over.  “I have something for you.  I was going to give it to you later, but this is as good a time as any.  You just need to unshrink it.”
He climbed the stairs automatically, barely registering the steps he took.  Once ensconced in his library, he waved his wand at the fire, and crumpled into the armchair.  He knew that he had to confront his feelings about what happened with Hermione.  But not today, he decided.
The boy gasped.  “Yes!  How do you know me?  I know your name because I have a storybook about you.”
, if their appearance is any indication.  There’s no way that this young man had any sort of experience or strategy to lead them with.  But their faces….they believe in him.  I study his face, and again feel the frustration of seeing a complex whirl of emotions that I don’t understand.  I hear the way his voice sounds quiet and sure as he confronts his parents’ murderer.  As the monster falls, and lies dead, and a huge roar of victory fills the air, I study his face even more closely.  There’s relief, and a sudden expression of satisfaction, and something so complex I don’t begin to try to interpret it.
Draco grinned.  “Well, the West Parkdale Wolves are very proud to sport the crimson and gold.  And I’m a very proud member of the Wolves.”
“Maybe?” Draco asks uncertainly.  “I found out too late that he was interested in me, and I messed it all up.”
“You aren’t emotionally damaged, Harry Potter!”  Hermione is indignant, thumps him on the arm.  Harry squeezes her hand reassuringly, and knocks on the door, the carrier bag he is holding banging into his chest.
!”  The last few words came out harsher than he’d intended, and, while they stopped the baby in its tracks, they also had an unintended consequence.  Potter sat his unclothed arse on Draco’s clean floor and gave him such a familiar look of stunned outrage that Draco nearly laughed, despite his horror.  Two chubby fists rubbed at his eyes, and his rosebud lips opened to emit such an ear-splitting scream that Draco cried out himself.  The baby continued to howl, fat tears rolling down his cheeks and dripping off his chin.
“You have.  I’d like to recommend that you take the opportunity to have a shower, get dressed in something other than pyjamas, and then we’ll speak again.  I can outline your treatment plan, and answer any questions you might have.”
In truth, the first time that Harry had asked Draco out, he’d been terribly hurt, thinking that Harry was making fun of him for his sexuality.  Draco knew that he’d been unkind as a child, not just to Harry, but to…well, everyone, but he was disappointed that Harry would stoop to something so hurtful.
“I don’t know.  Uncle Professor just says, ‘it’s complicated’.  If you want to know, you should ask Dad.”
“Er, we kind of had a row the other night. Well, he kind of had a row with Sev, and Remus and I sort of involved ourselves. He got a letter from his dad, and he was told to write back, so he did. Apparently Sev thought Draco was being much too sincere, and he said so. Draco got defensive and Sev of course said something a little degrading about Lucius, and Draco accused Sev of being no better than Lucius was. He told him that he’d be a horrible father, ‘Mione. It was so obvious that it hurt Sev, and it hurt Remus and me as well. I haven’t talked to him since, which was three days ago. Maybe I’m not being fair to him...” Harry trailed off, his expression clearly asking for Hermione to provide all the answers like she normally did.
“Did you just call Ron ‘the Weasel’?” Hermione asked with a strangely happy expression. Harry and Draco both gave her incredulous looks before Harry caught on and smiled at his boyfriend. Draco was even more confused now.
“By the most heinous, unforgivable act there is; murder. A Horcrux can only be created on the heels of a murder. When a Wizard takes the life of another person, their soul becomes torn in two. With the right spell, this piece of soul can be transferred to an outside object, therefore protecting the Wizard from death. Voldemort has committed six murders, at least, and has created six Horcruxes, the seventh piece lying inside of him still.”
“Er...yes? What is wrong with you two? Shouldn’t you be yelling at me for making fun of him?” the blonde asked as he pulled away from Harry to get a better look at his expression. Nope, still slightly amused and somehow proud.
“Alright, thank you, Severus.” There was a slightly awkward pause while the two men simply smiled shyly at each other. Remus finally took the initiative, knowing he would have to make all the moves as the Gryffindor in the ‘relationship’, and leaned down to gently press his lips against the slightly shorter man’s.
After ten minutes of silence, a faint popping noise was heard as a tall man in a patched up tweed suit Apparated a few feet from Albus and Severus.
Severus felt a sort of relief at that. He had thought it had been fixed by magic for sure, but Harry had been considerate enough to respect his wishes. He didn’t know why it was so important, but he didn’t want this watch to be touched by magic. Maybe it was because magic was the reason his father had inadvertently killed his mother.
“This is where it gets a bit more complicated. The mind does not have simple emotions like happy, sad, angry, scared, or nervous. There are sub-emotions that give away certain details, such as lying. It is not only in the mind, either. Lying is a psychological phenomenon that sets off warning bells throughout the body; sweaty palms, abnormal blinking, creased eyebrows, watering eyes, stuttering, breathlessness, twitching, fidgeting, hesitation – these are all tell-tale signs that someone is lying. It is a combination of both feeling the minds’ emotions and being able to read a person’s body language from the outside. You were very right; Legilimency is a lot more complicated than Occlumency. I want you to try something, however. I want to see if you can tell whether or not I am lying by Legilimizing me and reading my body language.”
Harry stood up immediately, glaring at his father. “Absolutely not! Not only is tampering with people’s memories just wrong, but it’ll be like removing months and months from their lives! Dad, I can’t do that to anyone, least of all you. Please don’t make me do this.”
Three days after the initial argument, Remus finally broke the silence while the four of them sat in the sitting room pouring over books out of sheer boredom. “This silence is beyond maddening. Don’t you children ever make any noise?” Remus asked of the two teens, who looked up from their individual books.
“What? Where are you staying then? Did you get a personal room?” Ron asked, his brow knitted in confusion.
“I’m sorry I fell for Voldemort’s trap. You would never have been there in the first place if I had just learned Occlumency from Dad like I was supposed to. It’s my fault – ”
There was another rasping noise, this one more rhythmic. It took the man a second to realize his master was actually laughing, though the cold sound could hardly pass as real laughter. It was more like a smug hiss.
“Of course I do, you depraved boy! I don’t walk around in my underwear – Well…not anymore, at least. Your father saw to that. I made damn sure I wore pants from that day forth.”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered as he knocked down the potion and allowed Snape to lay him down on the bed, pulling his mucked up old trainers off and covering him with the blankets. Draco didn’t care that Harry and Remus were still in the room as he let the blackness at the edges of his vision take him over at last.
“London, but nothing more descriptive than that. If I had access to Muggle city records, I may be able to find out if the orphanage is still there,” Hermione suggested, knowing she’d be the best one to search through Muggle documents.
“I was hoping you’d let me stay here tonight. I don’t really feel comfortable sleeping alone...” said Draco, giving the Potions Professor a pleading look.
Severus heard a yell from the direction of Knockturn, and quickly turned to make sure Remus had not been hit before turning back towards the Death Eater. He left himself exposed to Macnair for a split second, and that was all it took.
Remus and Severus were standing around the stone pensieve, watching the swirling silvery substance with looks of great distaste. Neither one of them were eager to view the memory, but neither were they willing to let the other go alone. It was too much for one person to bear, so they would go together and keep each other strong.
“Now, what I’m asking of you is as much a favour to me as it is to Harry. The war could very well depend on this.” Severus let it all sink in as he sipped leisurely at his tea. Potions weren’t the only things he was a Master of.
“Wait! Something isn’t right, here. Harry was dead; not on the cusp of being saved, but absolutely dead. That cannot be Harry,” Remus reasoned, his voice shaking as he felt the spike of hope in his heart that he was wrong. Had Severus used the stone after all?
After the smaller items were placed in the cauldron, Lucius used a spell – a fairly dark one – that turned the marble scythe into dust, which floated to the bottom of the cauldron. He felt the hair on the back of his next stand up as all of the sound in the graveyard seemed to cease all at once.
Severus put on his best annoyed scowl and sniffed distastefully. “I suppose if it is that urgent, Ms. Granger. What is it you would like to discuss? No matter how many times you look at me with those sad little eyes, I will not change your essay grade from an A to an E; it just wasn’t good enough.”
“And a good farewell we bid thee,” Harry answered the traditional saying. It paid off to be best friends with the smartest witch in their year, after all.
” Severus stormed back in the direction of the Defence classroom, leaving Harry and Draco alone in the corridor, still refusing to meet each other’s eyes.
Harry was quiet for a while as he thought back on the memory, trying to pull out all of the significant things. He still wasn’t sure what was so important about this memory, other than seeing that Tom Riddle was sadistic, even as a little boy. “Sir, what am I supposed to be gaining from this?”
Harry smiled his first true smile since before the accident, though it was a pained, slightly depressed looking smile. “I’d like that. Wotcher,” Harry said with a wave, his smile growing into more of a smirk as he tossed the floo powder down after stepping into the hearth. “
ways to stage a letter under somebody else’s name. Are you quite sure it is indeed from Ms. Tonks? Do you have a secret code, or perhaps it is charmed in a way so that you know it is in fact from her? Did you check for any curses before opening the letter?” Severus asked in a low hiss as he sneered at the insolent Gryffindor. The foolish boy would be susceptible to carefully placed curses in a letter if he simply
“You’ll catch your death out here,” Severus said quietly, coming to stand beside the werewolf looking out over the ramparts of the castle. It was a long way down from there.
Harry and Draco left the library leaving Hermione with her research and Ron looking a little lost. There was a long silence as Hermione created a new diagram of Horcruxes and Ron stared off into space, until he broke the silence.
Severus nodded curtly after a few seconds of shocked realization that Albus was pleading with him to protect Lily’s – and James’ – son. It was the least he could do, really, but he truly had no idea what he was getting himself into. “I…I will.”
“As much faith as I have in your considerable Potions abilities, Severus, I know well enough when I’ve dug myself in too far. I did not feel the need to stress you out even more with this knowledge. No doubt you would have spent every waking moment looking for a solution, when I am quite positive there is none. It was my decision, my boy, and I stick to it,” the Headmaster replied, his voice firm, yet still reassuring. It was beyond frustrating how the man could talk of his own impending death, and yet still make it sound like a pleasant conversation over tea.
“I told you, Harry, that the minute you started to depend on these potions for sleep that they would stop. These become very dangerous, almost to the point where you’ll be dependent for life. You do not want that, Son. I’m sorry, but you’ll have to try to sleep the best you can without it. I’m working on a formula for a draught that isn’t habit forming, but it will take time,” Severus explained, checking all of the drawers in Harry’s desk and nightstand to make sure they did not contain any more of the purple sleeping draughts.
Harry nodded his understanding. Snape’s explanation made much more sense than that huge book that made his head hurt. “I think I get it. I know the spell, and I know there has to be eye contact, but what exactly is my goal? As you’ve told me before, I can’t just simply ‘read’ a mind; the mind is a very complex, many layered thing,” Harry said as he remembered his very first Occlumency lesson with Snape the year before.
“Foolish question, Severus. He was subjected to quite a bit of questioning under Veritaserum, not to mention a bit of torture here and there,” the blonde answered, giving the Potions Professor a look that said he should have known better, and that the torturing was most likely done by his own hand.
With black slippers on his feet and a dressing gown thrown over his night clothes, Severus moved over to his desk and started to rummage around, the buzzing sounding much louder as he reached the oak desk. After pulling open all of the drawers and finding nothing, he opened the top cabinet, the buzzing becoming even louder, then. A small, black velvet pouch sat in the corner, moving idly as whatever was inside vibrated continually. Severus reached in and pulled the pouch out, pulling the strings open and pouring the small silver rod into the palm of his hand. He thought back to when he had acquired the little rod, his memory a bit vague on exactly what the rare magical little rod was for.
He had clearly begun to lose his temper as his speech went on, and the last bit was clearly said out of exasperation and anger. It was the first time he had called the Dark Lord by his name in
Severus winced at the use of the nickname for Tonks, but otherwise seemed unmoved by Remus’ angry retort. “Oh? So on what grounds does Albus have for thinking Greyback is involved, other than the fact that he is associated with the Death Eaters? If you are the only werewolf he has access to, how could he possibly know that information? Does he know that Greyback isn’t actually a Death Eater? The Dark Lord refuses to brand half-breeds with his Mark. I don’t know what he is playing at, but I think Dumbledore is deliberately misleading you. Who are you going to trust, Remus; me or him?”
“They won’t be getting away, Mr. Potter,” a rich voice said from behind Harry, making the teen whirl around to defend himself, though he didn’t think fist fighting was going to be the best method of getting away from one of the most infamous Death Eaters there was.
“Was that it, was that the dream?” Severus asked as he moved to sit beside the Gryffindor. He waited for his son’s nod of confirmation before tapping the sphere with his wand, projecting the dream once more.
I love Remus and Draco, and your sister though we have not yet met. But you, Harry, will always have a special place in my heart. You made me whole again, you gave me a reason to be a better man, to actually live instead of just survive. I could never find the right words to thank you, to explain how much you mean to me.
Harry looked up at the elder Malfoy with a twisted grin that was both pleasant and unpleasant. “I had already faced death twice before that, sir. What was one more time to save a friend in need?”
is currently unavailable, he’s getting it from some firewhiskey. No shame in that,” Draco said with a shrug, laughing at the matching horrified looks on Harry and Hermione’s faces.
Harry smiled, trying to blink back the annoying tears that were trying to leak from his eyes. He was glad when Draco pulled him close and gave him a quick kiss.
The Healers began to prepare Severus to go through the floo, casting a protective bubble around the cot as they levitated it. Remus stood and began to follow, turning around as Harry struggled to stand and follow as well.
Harry nodded in agreement, his expression thoughtful. Maybe it was that he wasn’t ever around Dumbledore, or didn’t know all of the Order’s plans, but he hadn’t really thought of Dumbledore as losing his marbles. Two of the smartest men he knew were agreed that something was off with Dumbledore, however, so the odds were against the kindly old Headmaster. “Do you think something will happen soon? Or will it be awhile before the shite hits the fan?”
Tonks’ smile turned to a curious frown as she cocked her head to the side and studied Harry like he was an interesting piece of art on display. “Who would have thought, eh? The way Severus was being so...well, gentle isn’t exactly the right word, but even though he was right livid with you, he was still so...
Harry chuckled and kissed his step-father gently on the cheek. “Rest well, Moony.” He would go find Draco and apologize for the way he had talked to him the day before. He had been so angry that he’d not been allowed to fight, but that didn’t give him an excuse to take out his ire on his boyfriend.
He was starting to feel more numb than anything. After the conversation with Wormtail, Harry knew without a doubt that the Horcrux within him could not be destroyed while he stayed intact and alive. It wasn’t plausible. And while they still weren’t sure just how they
“But I could control it, Draco! It was my decision to go, my plans that were foiled. Three people are dead simply because they were in the same place at the same time as me! How is that
“He’s in his office. Fawkes showed up in the library, crying and flying around hysterically. When I went to comfort him, he somehow Apparated me to Dumbledore’s office, I dunno how. I found him slumped over in his chair, and he kept asking for you, Severus. He seemed confused and really weak. I ran as fast as I could; I don’t know what happened,” Harry explained as they finally stepped off the dizzying spiral staircase leading to the Astronomy Tower.
Severus watched the young Gryffindor tear off to his room, smiling to himself as he left their quarters and made the long journey up to the Defence corridor. He paused outside the door to Remus’ office, trying to gather his thoughts and prepare how he was going to apologize. Just as he was about to knock, the door opened and Remus was there, smiling widely at his lover. It was like seeing the sun come out after a horrible storm.
Dumbledore just smiled and nodded at Severus and Remus before leaving the staff room, his eccentric blue robes sweeping the ground behind him.
“And how do you suppose we do that, Albus?” Severus asked incredulously, wondering what harebrained scheme the Headmaster had come up with now. This was all a bit daunting, and the stress level in the room was so thick that it was hard to breathe.
“Yeah, alright. I hope he doesn’t stay in a bad mood all day. I wonder why he hates his birthday so much.”
Harry Potter woke abruptly in the middle of the night feeling as if a bucket of icy water had just been thrown on him. He squinted around the dark room for a few seconds before he remembered to put his glasses on. Even with the blurriness gone, he still couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary in his small bedroom, but that slight sense of foreboding that had fallen into the pit of his stomach when he awoke was still there. Harry carefully pulled his blankets away from himself as he withdrew a long, slender wand from beneath his pillow.
Harry sighed deeply as he sat on the edge of his four-poster in the Gryffindor sixth year dorms. It felt cold, even though the temperature was comfortable. The walls were bare and the other beds empty, making the dorm feel distinctly unlike home when usually, this was the only place Harry
He pulled the blade away from the handle, careful not to run his finger over the sharp metal. He pulled his knees up to his chest, wrapping his arms around them as he laid the razor down beside him. He closed his eyes tight, trying not to second guess himself, but it was inevitable.
would you want to stay down there with that greasy old bat and the Slytherins?” Ron shouted, making many students turn towards them to listen in.
Severus’ eyes slammed shut as he pinched the bridge of his nose, praying for patience from someone –
Well, that was actually a pretty hard question to answer, Draco mused. He seemed to have lots of conflicting memories floating about in his head, and some that seemed pretty ludicrous. Since when did his mind supply memories of him
They had discussed this already the same night of Arthur’s death. It had gone without saying that it would not be safe for Severus to go to the funeral, but Harry had planned on having Remus there with him, and Severus refused to let the boy go without an adult guard. Molly would be much too busy grieving over her husband and comforting her own children to pay too much attention to Harry’s safety, which was quite understandable.
“Yeah, sure. Where’s Severus?” Harry asked as he sat down on his bed, folding his legs underneath him and getting comfortable. He had a strong feeling this little chat was going to be about what Harry had walked in on, and Snape’s absence made him think he wasn’t quite comfortable with the entire situation just yet.
“Harry and his friends, even the younger Order members, do you really think they’d be able to handle it alone? They need us veterans to help pull them through. We’re experienced in these types of things; they need a point of reference at least,” said Severus.
told you he only takes an intern every four years. His last intern finished in our first year. They don’t stay the entire term, just long enough to garner Severus’ approval and get their recommendations. Lena Reginald left in November of our first year, and she was never in classes with the lower levels, only advanced potions,” Draco explained, his tone indicating that he thought Harry should know all of this already.
Draco considered the information.  Obviously, this wasn’t proof, not nearly enough proof to put Ginny in prison, or even keep her away from Harry.  He had to figure out where she could be brewing.  Love potions were delicate, and had to sit for long periods of time.  She wouldn’t be able to make this on her kitchen stove, not without Harry finding out.
“So you’ve experienced both the detachment that I’m feeling now, and the ability to feel your emotions more normally.  What would you do if you were me?”
“Terrible business, that,” Lucius said wisely.  “My Uncle Septimus died of Dragon Flu.  She must take care.”
“When your Dad brought you back to England, I was very upset.  I was hurt that he’d left, and angry that he hadn’t told me about you.  The day that I saw you both at Hogwarts, I told him that I would sue him for full custody of you.”
He stares at me for a long, long moment, his eyes scanning my face, his mind working fast.  Finally, he seems to come to a decision.  “Bed,” he says hoarsely.
“At one time, I’m ashamed to say that I did.  There’s no excuse for it, none at all.  I’ll never be able to tell you how wrong I was.”
“I reckon Kreacher can swing by for a while,” Weasley said, “but he’s not exactly the first elf I’d put in charge of a baby.”  Draco wrinkled his nose.  The name sounded familiar.  “I don’t know how to call him,” Weasley continued.  “he isn’t mine, after all.  Can Harry talk?”
Harry laughed.  “I was so far from ‘fine’, it was a joke, but I do appreciate you being there for me.”
Draco blinked hard to dispel the tears that threatened.  “And then I broke up with him.  Told him that I hadn’t loved him.  That it had been a nice time, and I’d never taken it seriously.  I let him walk away, confused, and hurt, and betrayed.”
think she’s right?”  Harry’s never asked this before, and Ron, to his credit, has never volunteered his opinion.
“So, we thought that if we could do some strategic obliviation, and tweak some of the memories that fed your super-ego, it would reduce your unrealistic expectations of your ideal self, and make you less likely to constantly fall short of impossible ideals.”
Harry Potter would be here to witness his humiliation.  Potter doesn’t look at Draco, his attention is fully focused on the screaming woman who’s in Draco’s face.  “Out.  You don’t get to come and scream rubbish at anyone, much less someone in their place of business.”
say ‘no thanks to you’, which he attributes to the excellent mind-healer that Harry, and sometimes Draco, have seen since they started dating.   It hasn’t been easy for Harry, Draco acknowledges, but once he got a taste of what his life could be like, he’s been relentless in unlearning the thought patterns that life taught him.  Sometimes, he gets prickly, and distant, and Draco understands that he needs reassurance, but not guilt in those moments.  It wasn’t easy for Draco to learn that, but he has, and they’re stronger for it.  Adopting Scorpius has been another thing that has caused them the odd stumble, but Draco knows that Harry loves them both, and that he’ll do whatever it takes to make it work.
“Well, yes, of course I do, eventually, but it just seems like we should try to be a bit practical, yeah?  I can’t imagine that Wendell’s going to go unmissed for long, and if the Ministry tries to cover this up, we’d have a better chance at managing this if we act before they do.”
I consider this.  She’s not looking at me as though we’re friends, but she also doesn’t seem like she’s about to kill me, or take more of my memories.  “I don’t know,” I say eventually.  “Why do you want me to?”
I shake my head.  Draco says, “He was the father of psychoanalysis.   His theory was that the unconscious mind governs behaviour to a greater degree than people suspect.”  Hermione looks surprised, and he says, “I
Draco felt the prickle of tears at his eyes.  “It…hurt, seeing him like that.  My childhood had ended, years earlier, but this broke something apart inside me.  All of the shame I carried, all of the sins I’d committed, this was my punishment.  And so I assured him that I would.  He made me swear a Wizard’s vow.  If I didn’t do as I promised, I’d lose my magic.”
“Potter.”  Draco was too badly battered to sneer at him like usual.  Also, the git had just testified on his and his mother’s behalf.
“Yeah, whatever you like, Kreacher.  Thanks for keeping me company today,” I say, and he sends a triumphant look Hermione’s way before he disappears.
As they come down from their orgasms, Harry weeps into Draco’s shoulder.  Draco pets Harry’s head, and wonders bleakly, of all that he’s done, if this is the worst atrocity he’s ever committed against another human being.
“No, I can see that.  Listen, when we get inside, I need you to be quiet.  If you wake the house up, it will be a nightmare.”
Harry felt as though his eyes had been glued shut.  He struggled to open them, but was assailed by such brightness that he slammed them shut again.
On the afternoon of Harry’s second day being nine, Hermione and Ron arrived, with a cheerfully screaming Rose.  Harry had agreed to another round of Exploding Snap with Ron, and Draco noticed that he seemed a lot more comfortable around his soon-to-be best mate.  They spelled a safety barrier around Rose, and left her with some toys, and then Draco and Hermione disappeared into the lab.
It was a much more sombre affair than the previous Liquor Potluck.  Draco sat on a stool, eyes glazed, as people whirled past.  Cups were placed into his hand, but he mostly ignored them.  A plate of food was laid in front of him, but Draco didn’t notice it until it had gone cold.  Through it all, Harry sat on a stool beside him, his shoulder close to Draco’s.  He didn’t say anything all night, just sat with him, a warm reassuring presence.  Draco knew that this was better than having sat alone on the Manor all night.  He didn’t feel okay, not by a long shot, but it helped.
Arthur had hung back, and was the last to approach Harry.  His hug was much gentler, and he simply said, “I’ve missed you, son.”  This proved to be Harry’s undoing, and he finally gave way to the tears that had been threatening and cried into Arthur’s robes.
Draco was a little surprised, but nodded, and led Cass up the stairs to Scorpius’ large, bright bedroom.  Scorpius was full-on tantruming, and a lack of intervention now would result in a sulky, obstinate child for the rest of the day.  “What’s this, then?”  He kept his voice light and curious.
Ron grins, “Yeah, ‘course.  They still get so twitchy when the three of us go in together.”  Right.  The Dragon thing.  I still can’t believe that’s a real story.
“You won’t.” Pansy’s voice was hard.  “You’ll stay and you’ll drink your fucking gin, and Ronald will have some fucking gin too, and we’ll have a good time, because this is Liquor fucking Potluck, and it only has one rule.”
He wasn’t supposed to be on call the next day, but Tamsin had received a letter from her Mother, and Harry knew that their relationship was already a torn and broken thing.  She had floo called him early, begging Harry to switch shifts with her.  Harry had agreed instantly.  He was a big proponent of maintaining family relationships.  Nonetheless, he’d hoped for a simple, event-free shift.  Other than his follow up visit with Malcolm, the morning had proceeded quietly, but just before eleven, as Harry was sitting in the canteen, eating a late breakfast, his Galleon warmed.
They begin with Wendell, and he dreamily confesses to his actions, while implicating about a dozen other members of the Ministry, who, entertainingly, go chalk-white and look like they want to run away.
“Well, that’s good, then,” Hermione said, a little uncertainly.  Draco thought about saying more, but it was too complicated, too difficult, too much like admitting it to himself.  After a long moment, each of them examining their thoughts and finding them too weighty to share, Hermione said, “Do you suppose we should work on the potion?”
By the time the waiter leaves us alone with the wine menu, I’m blushing.  Having managed to keep Draco guessing so far, I’m not off to a terrific start tonight.   I regard him from across the table.  His robes are more formal than the ones he wore at the bank, and the ice blue colouring flatters him, which, obviously, he’s well aware of.  His skin is as pale as cream, and the smug set of his lips distracts me for a moment, until I finally pull myself together and say, “Thanks, Draco, for making the reservation, and for meeting me.”
The knock on his door surprises him, in a dull, detached sort of way.  He ignores it.  It’s Hermione, he’s sure, and he can’t bear to tell her.  The knocking intensifies, and Draco wonders if he has it in him to get annoyed.  Faintly, from the hall, he hears, “Draco!  Draco, please!”
“The Department of Mysteries is outside of the Wizengamot and the Minister’s purview, officially.  However, we experiment with arcane branches of powerful magic.  In order to ensure that any one Unspeakable doesn’t breach our oaths of ethics, their peer is entitled to challenge their research.  There are a handful of people who can arbitrate the challenge, including a recipient of the Order of Merlin.  Like you.”  She looks, for a moment, as though she’s just uncovered one of the wonders of the world.  I decide to ask her later about the ‘Lord’ thing, as I’m certain I would have remembered if anyone had told me that.  I fiercely tell myself that this is
“Draco.”  Draco nodded encouragingly.  He wasn’t completely heartless, and this was clearly killing Harry.  It was then that Draco realized that this wasn’t some sort of last-ditch reconciliation.  His heart sank and sound roared in his ears.  If it wouldn’t have made him look like an utter fool, he would have fallen to the floor with his hands over his head, but, he owed it to Harry to at least hear him say the words.
“Yeah, I always thought that was bollocks,” Ron said easily.  “Harry about had a conniption when he found out.  Shouted his way all the way up to Kingsley’s office.”
me or something.”  And then, Draco’s heart stuttered a moment, when three very familiar faces appeared in the kitchen doorway.
“None of that,” Draco reassured him.  “Mr. Harry and I just want to understand what happened.  It isn’t your fault.”
It was only after Draco had gone through the house, warding every window, checking and rechecking every door, every lightswitch, his heels clicking on the floors of his empty house, that Draco allowed himself to succumb to the misery that was choking him.  He very quietly made his way to his bedroom, gathered the duvet over his head, and cried out his heartbreak like a lonely child.
“Astoria is lovely,” Harry said.  “And so is Scorpius, but don’t write Draco off completely.  He made a terrible first impression on me too, once.”
Draco was in the dining room, trying to persuade Scorpius to eat.  “Harry,” he said, his eyes warming, and a little smile crossing his lips.  “You look like you’re on a mission.”
One lovely thing about being a Wizard was how quickly and easily things like international travel were facilitated.  The Portkey was arranged in a matter of days, and Harry set charms to take care of things within the house and cancelled his Girl’s Empowerment classes at the school for the foreseeable future. His business would simply have to wait. As Cass and Minerva bustled with their jackets and bags in the entryway, Harry lingered in the living room.  “You’ll go to your portrait at Hogwarts?”
“Marrying a lovely, beautiful witch will hardly doom our society to ruin.  I do hate when you’re dramatic.”
“I had an aunt,” Draco said, conversationally, “and she wasn’t very nice to me.  Horrible, actually.”
“I could have sworn that you were interested.  You never actually told him that you weren’t.  It seemed like you were playing hard to get.  And if you didn’t want to date Harry, I thought that you at least were friends with all of the Gryffindors now.”
The visit passed uneventfully, and Harry and Draco left.  Draco had agreed to take his Mother to a restaurant she thought looked charming that evening, and he and Harry agreed to meet later that evening.  “I’ll come to you at bedtime,” Draco promised, with a lingering kiss that promised more.  He apparated home, and prepared for dinner. He was nearly finished getting ready when a tapping at his window revealed an unfamiliar owl.  Opening the window to allow the owl in, Draco cast a few revealing spells to ensure that the owl wasn’t carrying any hexes or Dark Spells.  Although the wards at Malfoy manor were secure, Draco had learned the hard way to be suspicious of unfamiliar owls.  The scan revealed nothing, and Draco untied the letter from the owl’s outstretched leg.  It stood watching him solemnly, and Draco assumed that it was waiting for a reply.  He unfolded the letter and read:
“Oh,” Kreacher looks impressed, and I’m confused again as he continues, “Master Harry has given up on clinging to his denial.”
Cass shifted from where she was snuggled on Harry’s other side.  “Dad?  Should we do something about your hand?”
“Two weeks ago, Hermione came to visit me at the Castle.  Do you know what her job at the Ministry entails?”  Harry shook his head.  “She runs the Department of Magical-Muggle Relations, and supervises any interaction that Wizards have with the Muggle world.  She received an application to participate in a Muggle Medical Trial.  Are you familiar with those?”  Harry nodded.  “The application was from Draco, applying on behalf of his son.”
“And you’re his mummy, so he will always come back to you.  That's what I'd do if I had a mum, and Draco's the smartest person in the whole world, so that's what he'd do too.”
“Potter,” he says, his eyes riveted on me.  I note that I’m Potter this time, not Harry.  I can’t imagine that’s a coincidence. There’s no hug this morning, either.
“Draco, don’t jump to that conclusion.”  Hermione’s forehead was wrinkled, as though she was thinking hard, there was a connection somewhere, and she was exerting herself to make it.  “I know that Harry didn’t get along with his Aunt and Uncle.  I always wondered whether they were…I don’t know…neglectful.  Some of the things he’d say when he was back at Hogwarts after the summer…He always asked us to send him food for his birthday.  Draco, I’m sure of it.  He’s little because he’s been abused.”
“I want to give it to him, you know.  I want to give him everything, really, but the family?  That’s what I want too.”
Harry was kneeling next to Cass’ bed, holding her hand with both of his.  His face was buried in the mattress, but as Draco approached, he heard him mumbling, “Oh thank Merlin, clever, clever girl.”
“Perhaps.  But right now, I am concerned with a little boy who has enough on his plate already, and a young lady who is watching a stranger scream at her Dad.”
