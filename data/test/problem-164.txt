Should he-? No. But—would it hurt to just see? What was the worst thing they could be hiding? A vicious book full of hateful comments about him? Surely, they were too nice for that.
“We were in the Room of Requirement,” He said. Neville felt illogically jealous that all of his friends had been together without him, he let it fuel the flame burning in his chest.
The whole world sped up again, Neville’s head swam. Harry was pulling desperately at him, screaming for Neville to move, to run.
“Yeah but it would be way easier to explain why you know things than having to make up a million excuses.”
And then, after all that, Harry Potter finally sighed and said, “You see Professor. The truth is I’m obviously one of the greatest seers of all time."
Luna noticed that on that particular day every month Harry hardly changed his facial expression from a beaming smile the whole day.
That was another truth. Although the Parkinson’s were traditionally Slytherin, they were a young-money family. Their business was in parchment production.
“He said it should have a middle-aged name because only middle-aged people should be driving it” Professor Lupin had said with a voice full of equal parts exasperation and humour.
Finally, his wand alighted on something, something under a desk. He shot forward, falling to his knees. Two tiny clouds of dust appeared where his knees fell. He leant forward, reaching his hand out and grabbing what was under the desk.
“You’re Luna Lovegood” Harry emphasised, like it was something perennial and not just her name “And anyway I just want you to kick start the idea. We can ask an older student to really be, what’s that thing, Editor in charge?”
This boy could be blown away by a strong breeze. He already seemed to be swaying. Hermione was suddenly vividly reminded of the feeble-nerved mothers who clutched their pearls and fainted delicately when faced with a great shock in all her classic novels about rich white people having rich white problems. The boy was whipping his head around now, mimicking the frantic barn owl caged a few feet from him with a family of red heads. The boy’s eyes seemed to bulge out of his head when he spotted the redheads. Perhaps he had a phobia of them, she thought.
“That’s what Draco called it.” Harry sing-songed. Ron looked over at the Ravenclaw table and glared at the back of the blondes’ head.
The man’s voice is wheedling. He’s clearly desperate, though Luna doesn’t blame him. There are at least a dozen people towering over him. Harry stands just behind his guardians, face stony. Dumbledore as well as three Aurors and a ministry official are also clustered around, though in far more official capacity than that of Luna and her friends. The ministry official they sent was Fudge. He keeps sending murderous glares at both Dumbledore and Sirius.
“Happy Valentines day Ginevra” Luna said softly and after a quiet beat she craned her head slightly and kissed Ginny softly on the cheek.
“She might as well be. Iphigenia is still out of action and with NEWTs coming up Kassandra is less and less involved,” Luna said, and Ginny sighed but didn’t contradict her.
He did. He took one finally awed look at the roiling menagerie of flames and then he turned on his heels and ran, puling a distraught Harry along.
They both remained silent for a long moment. Hermione in understandable shock and Harry in clear exhaustion.
Draco gave him the look you give all sane people when they’ve done categorically insane thinks. “Right.”
“But you have to be skilled to control Fiendfyre. You have to know how to cast it and that’s dark magic. That’s-
It wasn’t the record Neville had expected. But from the first note of Suzanne he was fixed, lying on the shag-pile next to Remus’ ancient record player.
And if they hadn’t been so caught up in blushing at each other they may have noticed that none of their friends whooped or giggled at them, but instead shared happy smiles, even of those smiles were tinged with the faintest amount of exasperation.
And if Hermione hadn’t known better, which she was always sure she did, and had been slightly more cynical, which she was sure was a skill that would come with age, she would have called Harry’s extreme perturbance, worry and strife over the lost rat just a
“Uh huh,” Hermione said with a high pitch, nodding frantically, the they all sped past Neville, as if he were an errant rock diverting their stream in two.
They’d all split off to surround him, each of them armed with a butterfly net and a small cage. It had been rather simple actually. “Simplicity has its perks” Harry had said with a shrug and no one dared question why he had butterfly nets and cages so readily available. Odd kid, Harry Potter. You learnt to accept things fast.
Luna thought the whole organisation was brilliant, far more brilliant than she could have ever hoped. New ideas found their way into the suggestion box outside the office almost daily- some of them were quite brilliant. Someone had suggested they include a list of funniest point-loss reasons from the month which had promptly found its way into the next edition.
A fourth year Hufflepuff by the name of David wrote fabulous articles about the History of Hogwarts that were more interesting then Bins could ever hope to be. Luna hoped that the articles renewed interest in history for the student population. His friend Paloma and a Sixth-year Slytherin called Hattie (who had admitted rather embarrassed that she was Rita Skeeter’s niece) were in charge of current affairs.
“You look very pretty, Luna.” He said calmly, to snickers and hoots form the Fourth-year boys. Ron noticed Draco give a barely perceptible frown out of the corner of his eyes.
“No,” Neville said, but he was already tumbling back, his feet turning over each other in their haste to get away. Harry began to chant. A spark flew from his wand.
“I had become something called the master of death at that point” Harry said, snorting lightly “It’s like… Have you ever read Lord of the Rings? Well its that sort of ‘one ring to rule them all’ thing. I’d collected these objects” He shrugged awkwardly “Anyway I think that having that power or whatever it is meant that when I had this fleeting thought” his voice cracked “that I wished I could see my family again. It. Well it let that happen. Instead of waking up back where I died I—”
“How has your dad not noticed you’ve disappeared yet?” Hermione asked incredulously, flopping exasperatedly down on Draco’s bed and making the blonde let out an ‘oof’ at the sudden jolt. Ron couldn’t help noticing the way Hermione looked in the warm lamp light. Brown skin and hair dancing golden.
They were at breakfast when Neville got the news. He felt his heart stop in his chest, felt it beat violently against his ribs the moment after. His throat felt suddenly too prevalent in his body, shrivelling up and expanding at the same time.
“He probably has.” Draco said with disappointment. “There’s meant to be this big party over with the Romanians that all the bigwigs are going to. It’s probably more of a wake now, but dad’ll expect me there.”
“They’re iron. Iron protects from cursed objects. It’s old fae magic I think, from before they went extinct” Hermione said.
“I think maybe your life is just extra ridiculous. Like everyone else in the world gets to have mundane lives because you took all the strange happenings with you at birth.” Hermione whispered, still in slight shock.
It was Ginny and Ron he spent the most time with, of course. And they were rounded out by Harry and Hermione, who had come to stay after the wedding as well, and Luna whenever she wandered down from her house or they wandered up to hers.
Luna still sometimes found herself shut out from Hermione and Harry’s private world, though she didn’t mind. Whenever they would sequester themselves in one of the houses forgotten bedrooms- replete with stacks of notes, maps and pictures that Luna had only caught glimpses of- Luna would go the library. Remus had explained that the library in Grimmauld was an amalgamation of the Black family’s ancestral library and Remus’ personal collection, as well as Lily Potter’s small but sizeable library which had been left to Remus after her death. Luna liked to go through the books to find any inscriptions of annotations that the various book proprietors may have left.
Small, recorded secrets like these calmed her. It reassured her that the world kept going even when she turned her back. That she didn’t have to keep watch constantly to keep it alive.
Hermione took a moment to preen, before rightly panicking about the supposedly sentient mind-reading piece of headwear currently sat atop her head.
Term began after Christmas without much fanfare. Draco regaled them happily with many re-enactments of is stuffy pureblood Christmas. They were promptly asked to leave the library for laughing too loudly. It was a sad day in Hermione’s life.
“Here” Harry said grinning and handing Draco a sparkly wrapped (thankfully wrapped by Hermione) present “It’s from all of us”
This was unknown territory. Even Hermione’s parents tended to gently shut her down if she talked about a single topic for longer than ten minutes. Or if, as had often been the case, she had talked so long she had forgotten to do simple things like eat the meal in front of her, look where she was going or, on a memorable occasion, take a breath. Jean Granger hadn’t enjoyed driving her ten-year-old daughter to A&E the time she’d passed out and whacked her head mid rant about NHS cuts.
Three days before Christmas break (wherein Harry and Ron would be staying at her house due to Harry’s suggestion. Draco had been invited but had been forced to decline for obvious reasons) her DADA teacher was proven to be a death eater.
Voldemort was back, but Neville was at a happy, gorgeous wedding with all of his close friends and so the only sign of him was the gape in Neville’s life where his Gran had lived, and the old aching wound that his glassy-eyed parents sent pulsing every time he saw them.
Harry was still all nerves, however. He was convinced that at any moment something would go wrong. Ron couldn’t blame him. The last time Harry had seen this maze, he’d been dragging Diggory’s lifeless body from it.
Despite the ease of their social lives, Hermione still found herself dealing daily with The Harry Potter Problem. It deserved the capitalisation. It deserved several case files, an alphabetised filling cabinet full of information and copious amounts of colour coordinated spider diagrams.
“Well. We’re going to Belarus next week for a few days. Pettigrew’s been sighted up there.” Sirius said, awkwardly moving on.
“Wanna make an actual bet on this one?” Harry muttered, “I have literally no idea how it’s gunna go.”
Then the first fire-serpent flew into the air, diving at Harry. Neville screamed, and Harry’s face shifted, he ducked, rolling to the side. The serpent burst into green flame where he had stood. The small blaze was churning now, as if readying to birth more fire dragons. It was spreading, consuming the space. Neville could feel the heat growing. It was going to be unbearable.
“Kassandra pushed us to do an Oracle special for tomorrow morning. She asked me to write the cover piece,” Luna said, looking pleased.
An anonymous contributor (though Luna was privately pretty convinced it was Draco) wrote a column about Music, both muggle and magical. The by-line referred to the writer simply as ‘The Music Mage’.
As if defeating a dark wizard before your second birthday somehow meant you didn’t need to adhere to normal human behaviour or the laws of the universe. That was admittedly a bit of a stretch. Hermione hadn’t seen Harry bend any of the laws of the universe.
you to think. In actual fact, Pettigrew was an unregistered animagus who, upon being chased by Sirius Black,” Dumbledore’s eyebrows once again became one with the sky at this name, “faked his own death, framed Sirius and took twelve muggles out in an explosion. And now he’s there, in that box, in his animagus form of a rat.”
“I love your sister, mate,” Harry croaked, “But there is literally no one in the world I am more afraid of and we're facing off against a dark lord.”
The moment of silence was broken when professor McGonagall entered the ward, closely followed by Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Fleur, who immediately rushed to Bill's bedside. Harry heard Fleur declaring loudly that she was still going to marry Bill and suddenly she and Mrs. Weasley were crying and hugging each other.
“I know what he's done. I know you hate him, but... he's always been there for me.” he whispered, staring at the younger boy pleadingly, willing him to understand.
"We're not hiding." Draco objected, though that was exactly what they were doing. "And he's visiting Hagrid."
"Well.. a bond isn't supposed to cause pain. And I've also never heard of anyone fainting, let alone being unconscious for the better part of a day." she explained. "But never mind that. I'm sure you'll be fine. Sleep now." she finally ended the discussion in a voice that allowed to argument.
“Good idea. There's a Herbology book professor Sprout mentioned to me. Maybe they'll have it. I'll come with you.” Neville decided.
His stomach rumbled loudly, reminding him that he hadn't eaten anything since last morning. Maybe he could nick some of their food. His paw hurt badly and he was very tired, but he was sure he could still run if he needed to.
He was six and watching from his hiding spot up at the stairs as his father hit his mother so hard she crashed into a table. Biting down on his fist he tried his best to stay quiet and stifle his sobs.
>Usually Blaise would shake me awake and we would both pretend nothing had happened the next day.< Draco had said. >But there were nights when he couldn’t get me awake. Where I was too caught up in the nightmare to fully snap out of it. Those nights he usually fetched Pansy and she would crawl into bed with me and hold me until I calmed down.<
It all started at breakfast, a few days after the Christmas holidays, when a barn owl landed in front of him with a package. Since their mail was still undergoing a screening for cursed or dark objects, there was no need for caution. At least that's what he'd believed. So Harry opened the package without thinking. Peeling back the wrapping paper he discovered a small, leather bound book. Guessing that Remus must have sent it, he picked it up with a frown.
Rookwood pushed him roughly back down and Harry made no move to get up again. He simply lay there, his face pressed against the cool stone, hoping it would all be over soon. He didn't even react when the tall man nudged him in the ribs rather forcefully with his shoe.
Draco hurried along the corridor, cursing himself for getting caught up in a discussion with Urquhardt. Now he was late. His friends would already be down by the Quidditch pitch, to watch Gryffindor's match against Hufflepuff.
Before he could question the other two, Sirius barked at Draco to hurry up and strode past him. The Minister obviously found nothing unusual about that, because he went down the corridor without another word. Harry and Draco followed after Sirius.
When Kreacher finally showed up again, he claimed to know nothing about a letter. And since he was a free elf and therefore not really bound to obey Harry's orders, he couldn't be forced to tell the truth. So Harry dropped the subject and decided to forget about the letter.
“We'll never make it out. It's too big!” Draco shouted, as the dragon advanced upwards. It breathed flame again and the floors and ceiling of the tunnel cracked. Harry shut his eyes against the heat and dust and prayed that they'd make it out alive.
Until suddenly strong hands grabbed his upper arms and he found himself staring into the determined grey eyes of Draco Malfoy. The blond was talking and somehow the words made it through the fog in Harry's head.
“He got into it with his Gryffindor buddies last night. Defending you as usual, even against his friends. Though they weren’t acting all that friendly to begin with. He was pretty pissed. And it looked to me like he had trouble controlling his magic.”
And just like that the awkwardness was back. He blushed and averted his eyes, unable to look at his boyfriend, choosing instead to stare at a spot somewhere to his right.
It was already getting late when they finally ended up on the bench again, sitting quietly side by side, both not ready to head back just yet. They still had a little time before dinner.
The blond nodded and followed him to the shed, where the training brooms and Quidditch equipment were kept.
"I should have warned you. But I didn't really know what to expect either. I thought it was just the diary, because he'd been feeding off Ginny's energy back then."
“She's clever. Got to hand her that.” Sirius took over again. “And as it turns out, she's been most helpful. Here, see for yourself.”
After another four days of talking it through, they agreed that they had everything as well planned out as possible. Draco would pose as Lucius and demand to be taken to his vault. Harry would follow him under the invisibility cloak. The Malfoy vault was close to the Lestrange vault, so this would at least take them in the right direction. Once the cart had made it down, they would have to overpower the goblin, get him to take them to Bellatrix vault and then lead them out again.
Kreacher told them that Voldemort had required an elf and that Regulus had volunteered him. He started rocking faster, his breath coming out in hitched sobs. But he continued to talk. It seemed almost as if he was glad to finally be able to get it off his chest.
“Professor?” Draco spoke up hesitantly. “I think Theodore Nott gave her that necklace.” All of them turned to stare at him.
Draco himself felt weighed down by the locket whenever he had to wear it. He couldn’t shake the dark thoughts that kept plaguing him. The memories of his father, telling him what a disappointment he was. The fear of not being good enough. Of losing Harry and everyone else he cared about. It made him revert to his old defence mechanism - hurt them before they can hurt you. Lash out if you're feeling insecure. Of course his spirits lifted as soon as he was allowed to take off the locket and hand it over to the next wearer, but he soon started dreading his next turn more and more.
Thanks for the sweet comments. They really made me smile and continue to work on this story. Hope you like the new chapter.
The Gryffindor smiled and grabbed his plate. Draco felt ridiculously proud of himself. Maybe his idea hadn't been so stupid after all.
Harry fidgeted a bit. “I… I had a talk with Elphias Doge.” he finally admitted. “And then Ron’s aunt Muriel showed up and kept harping about Skeeter and the book she’s written about Dumbledore.”
Therefore he missed how Draco's shoulders slumped and how the blond watched him go. Damn, why did Potter have to try and talk to him? It was bad enough that he was forced to spend time with him. The sleepless nights and constant stress were getting to him. He couldn't let his guard down. Especially not around Potter.
Urquhardt was ruthless, despite complaints from various players. He took them through the drills again and again, completely unconcerned by the wind and heavy rain. Draco wondered what he'd have to pay Millie to make her knock their team captain off his broom. Too much, he decided in the end. She'd probably want a detailed report of his intimate encounters with Harry. She'd been needling him for information for a while now.
“Family and friends, loved-ones, colleagues and companions…. Welcome. We have gathered here today to witness the joining of two souls. Draco and Harry have decided to walk the path of life together, united as one. Draco, Harry… if you would now please clasp hands…”
“I wear silk pyjamas to bed, if you must know.” he heard himself answer, shaking his head at his own stupidity. Why the hell was he playing along now? Why didn't he just hang up?
Sixth year was a very tough time for Harry. There was that whole Chosen One business for one thing. The Prophet was publishing almost daily articles about him, one more hilarious than the next and people were whispering and staring at him even more than usual. He didn't think he'd ever get used to that. This completely stupid hero worship, just because of something that had happened to him when he'd still been a baby. His mother was the real hero. If she hadn't sacrificed her life for his, he wouldn't be here now.
Harry sprinted towards them, calling out in Runcorn's booming voice to stop. To Draco's surprise they actually did. Harry told them that the Muggle-borns had to leave first and for a moment it looked like they might actually be getting away with it.
“Yeah. So we’re heading over to Grimmauld Place. Sirius thinks if we’re lucky, Kreacher has kept the locket.” Harry let his boyfriend know.
He sighed inwardly, shaking his head at himself. His animagus form was actually the least of his problems right now. Sirius and Remus wouldn't be back from Greece for another couple of days. Which meant that unless one of his friends came by to check on him and made the connection, he would stay a tiny, black terrier for the time being. Great.
They finished their lunch in silence, with Harry trying not to stare at Draco too openly and failing miserably. The blond looked better today. He wasn't quite as pale and the dark circles beneath his eyes were less prominent. The sleep potion Dumbledore had given him had obviously helped. And he'd already eaten two decent meals today. Now Harry just had to make sure that he kept this up.
Snape jumped to his feet, suddenly furious. “You have used me! I’ve spied for you, lied for you, put myself in mortal danger. To keep Lily’s son safe. And now you tell me you’ve been raising him like a pig for slaughter!”
The blond was at his wits end. To him at least it was painfully clear that Harry was struggling with something. But how was he supposed to help, if he didn't even know what the problem was? He also felt a little hurt that Harry wouldn't confide in him. He'd really thought they were closer than that. Which prompted the thought that maybe he was the problem, though he couldn't fathom why Harry would have a problem with him now, all of a sudden.
The trio reached Gringotts without any trouble. Remus ignored Sirius's self-satisfied grin as they went up the steps leading into the bank and instead reached out to steady Tonks when she stumbled. The goblins guarding the entrance gave them suspicious looks, but that wasn't unexpected. Goblins were always suspicious.
“Well, at first she said she wouldn’t read it. She was afraid it was going to be bad news, so she wanted to wait until exams are over. But then she didn’t come to the library after lessons, like she usually does. And when I went to our room to look for her, I saw the opened letter lying on her desk.”
"Why should I be mad at you? You saved my life. You freed Draco from Voldemort's clutches. And you gave me this." he indicated his and Draco's joined hands.
Ginny had been easier in a way. She had shown up on his doorstep, wanting to continue where they had left off. Wanting to fix him. After Harry had told her in no uncertain words that he just didn't have any romantic feelings for her any longer, she had run off with tears in her eyes and never come back. He'd felt only slightly guilty. At least he'd been honest. Even if Ron hadn't talked to him for a month after that.
They even started talking. About some of the memories Draco had seen. Harry told him a little about his childhood and growing up with his Muggle relatives and in turn learned that it hadn't been all that easy growing up with Lucius as a father either. Narcissa had always showered her son with gifts and affection. Lucius had been strict and demanding.
Malfoy was standing next to the bed. And he was yelling at Harry. Who suddenly realized that he must have changed back into his human form during the night. And he was still lying in Malfoy's bed. Naked! He scrambled up with a yelp and grabbed the blanket to cover himself.
Harry traced the graffiti with his finger. Suddenly he was grinning. “This is brilliant!” he gushed.
“Sort of? I`ve got some ideas, but I’m not sure if they’ll work. I guess we’ll just have to try. If you’re okay with that.”
“I don't need a bloody mind healer to poke around in my past!” the younger boy spat. He could feel the tension returning to his body, his magic reacting to the new wave of anger.
They walked along the lake and then entered a small copse of trees. He was about to complain again when Harry suddenly stopped. Looking ahead the blond couldn't help but gasp. Fairy lights twinkled in the bare branches of two large oak trees. A blanket was spread out on the ground underneath, with a picnic basket waiting at the side. Draco walked to the blanket in a daze, staring at the scene, before looking back at the Gryffindor.
He decided to get it over with quickly and ask Slughorn after their next Potions lesson, which came way too soon for his liking. They were studying antidotes now and Harry had no idea what their teacher was even talking about. Hermione, as always, quoted perfectly from the book, making him understand even less, if possible. And then they were each handed a vial and told to brew an antidote.
“He didn’t like that. Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got angry and there was an argument. We both pulled out our wands and the bastard used the Cruciatus Curse on me. Albus was trying to stop him and then all three of us were duelling and … it set her off. I think she wanted to help. And I don’t know which of us did it. It could’ve been any of us… And she was dead. … Course Grindelwald scarpered. And Albus was finally free. Free to become the greatest wizard of the century.”
“It felt too real. It always does. I want to forget that night, but I remember it all too clearly. The other Death Eaters, who were gathered around to watch. The fear and sadness in mother's eyes. Bellatrix cackling madly, obviously enjoying the show... Most of all I remember his ugly face, staring down at me. How he grabbed my arm and … and branded me.”
He suddenly started advancing on Harry, who backed up until his back hit the wall. The blond leaned right into his personal space, bracing his arms on the wall on either side of Harry's head, effectively trapping him. He was way too close and Harry was starting to panic, overwhelmed by the situation and wondering how this could have gotten so out of hand.
Harry nodded and went to sit down in front of the fire again. After a moment's hesitation, Draco joined him.
"I'll stop hitting you, if you stop being stupid. Boys!" Pansy rolled her eyes and gave a long-suffering sigh. "Now, as I was saying, he helped you, although he knew you've technically been working for his enemy. Even after you've told him what you've been ordered to do. And you told him before you told me, which says a lot about trust." Here she glared at him and he flinched slightly, almost expecting to be hit again.
Thanks for all the lovely comments. They really motivated me to get the next chapter done quickly. It's a long one this time and it doesn't even have a cliffhanger.
Because that was the only thing that would explain why his friend was calling him in the middle of the night, obviously attempting to have phone sex. The Slytherin knew he should just hang up, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He felt intrigued and despite the fact that Harry was saying the most ridiculous things, the tone of his voice was starting to get to Draco.
Molly hugged Ron and Harry and then, to everybody's surprise, she also hugged Draco. “Have a nice holiday, boys. And don't forget that you're all invited to Christmas lunch at the Burrow.” she reminded, before ushering Ron and her husband over to where Ginny was waiting, shuffling her feet awkwardly.
“Yes. I know you said the diary helps you. That you feel less angry now. You’ve also gotten really good at harnessing so much magic. And that’s great. Really, it is. But when someone pisses you off, you still lose control of your powers way too easily. So I thought … maybe we should try to work on that?”
Lavender's grin was all too knowing, but she let him get away with it. “Well, at first I did my best to avoid her. Which isn't easy when you're sharing a room. She tried to approach me a few times, but I always shot her down. I was rather nasty, I've got to admit. I was convinced that I could never be friends with a Slytherin.” she let him know.
With a resigned sigh Draco gave in. There was just no arguing with Sirius when he'd set his mind on something and he really needed to pee. So he allowed the older man to trail after him as he slowly made his way to the bathroom. At least Sirius had the decency to wait outside. And when he stepped out again Draco was even secretly glad for his presence. It felt as if the short walk had lapped up all his strength. He didn’t even protest when Sirius took hold of his arm to support him. At least he kept his mouth shut as he did so.
A tingling feeling spread through Harry's body, pooling in his groin. He shifted a little and the fingers brushed against a spot that made him see stars and cry out in pleasure. Draco froze for a second. The he repeated the movement, brushing that spot again and again.
The blond blushed and gave him a shaky smile, which was a better response than he'd been hoping for. He smiled back in what he hoped was a reassuring way, before leaving the two boys alone again. Before he closed the door he heard Harry saying:
“We didn’t lose time, Harry. You know that Moony and I haven’t been idle. Neither has the rest of the Order.”
The Gryffindor shrugged, knowing that he’d have to face the consequences sooner rather than later. He wouldn’t put it past Ron and Hermione to show up today. Maybe talking about it would help with the inevitable confrontation.
“I know that I can't ask you to stay behind. That it wouldn't be fair of me to make you. Just … please promise me you'll be careful.”
The Gryffindor still hadn't moved from his spot. Was still staring at the canopy of his bed. Draco was struck with the sudden urge to cheer him up.
"Good. We'd better get going then. I'd say it's at least a ten minute walk to the Cottage. But I didn't want to take us closer while there was a chance we were being followed."
Harry made a strange move, like he wanted to reach for his hand, but thought better of it. Instead he took out his wand and cast a spell Draco didn't quite catch.
He walked to the door, needing to get away. Needing to think. Which he couldn't do in here, with the blond so close. And a bed. It was too tempting. But then he paused with his hand on the doorknob.
“Your mother is an extremely intelligent woman. She will make sure that she isn’t caught helping us.” Remus said softly, as if reading his thoughts.
Draco knew from experience that arguing with his best friend was a losing battle, so he simply agreed and nodded along with her suggestions on how best to ask Potter out.
He looked at Draco, who understood immediately what he was hinting at. That memory Dumbledore wanted. Information about the Horcrux. It would be reason enough for Voldemort to want Slughorn dead. But the blond also had another idea.
"Hmm… maybe you need to step up the game." she mused, looking speculative, which never boded well. "Oh, I know. There's a Hogsmeade weekend coming up. Ask him to go with you."
"No, he doesn't." Remus agreed. "He probably never had, seeing how he asked after the Horcruxes when he was still a student here."
The first thing she’d done, once the war had been over and Lucius officially declared dead, was to move out of Malfoy Manor. She was now living with Andromeda, while the manor served a new, higher purpose. The east wing had been turned into an orphanage for kids who had lost their parents in the war, while the south wing served as a sanctuary for people who tried to get out of an abusive relationship. Narcissa had hired a whole team of mind-healers and social workers. She also offered help to death eater victims and people who had lost relatives in the war and she’d even started a programme, which helped to reintegrate death eater children into society.
“Yes, he knows. I told him everything. He actually helped me get the next one. So what was there?” he prodded, getting impatient.
“And he told Kreacher to take it. And to switch the lockets when the basin was empty.” His sobbing was getting worse. It was hard to understand him.
So Harry tramped down the urge to go after his godfather and instead allowed Draco to drag him to the living room. They took a seat on the couch and discussed the day’s events.
“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord and the Dark Lord took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, with a great black lake. And there was a boat...”
The two teenagers stood stock-still for a moment, listening with baited breath. There was no way to make out voices. No way to know who was fighting whom. Or who was winning for that matter.
The blond stared at him in disbelief. "With me? What is wrong with you? You've been glaring at me all through breakfast and then the anger I felt from you distracted me during lessons. I couldn't concentrate."
Draco looked at the picture with a frown, recognizing the sign immediately. “You saw it at Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Luna’s father was wearing it around his neck.”
“The war is over. This year is about healing and moving forward. I hope that we can find a new unity between the four houses.” the headmistress declared. Draco sincerely doubted that, but he dutifully clapped along with everyone else.
As it turned out Remus needn’t have worried about waking anyone. When Harry had fought his way back through the bushes, Draco was just coming down the stairs. He’d woken up to find Harry missing and when he hadn’t returned after five minutes, the blond had gone looking for him. He was closely followed by Hermione, who had heard the stairs creaking and wondered who was creeping through the house in the dead of night. With a resigned sigh Remus sent her back upstairs to wake Ron.
He cast around for a question, blurting the first thing he could think of: “The day we met, on the Hogwarts Express... you were trying to show me a spell. What was it?”
The young man blushed furiously. Shit. Why hadn't he apparated straight into his bedroom? He quickly grabbed a blanket from the couch, wrapping it around his middle.
Remus looked unsure as well, but Sirius surprised them all by ordering: “I’m giving you to Harry, Kreacher. He’s your master now. You will obey him as you obeyed Regulus, understood?”
The Slytherin bristled at the fact that she was talking about him like he wasn't even there. But he didn't want to aggravate her, only minutes after she'd accepted his apology, so he forced himself to stay calm.
His mood hadn't improved when he met up with Draco in the kitchens later for their daily study session. The blond kept sneaking glances at him, but Harry didn't feel like getting into a discussion and pretended to concentrate very hard on his homework. Draco obviously got the hint and said nothing. They worked side by side in silence for a while, until the Gryffindor could stand it no longer and started packing his things. He muttered a short "Goodnight." in Draco's direction and then left the kitchens without sparing the Slytherin another glance.
Harry had learned to pick his battles, especially with those two. So he sat down and listened to the girls' advice with growing worry. What the hell had he gotten himself into now?
“Don't worry. Some of us sustained injuries, but .. they'll be okay.” the animagus assured, putting a calming hand on his shoulder. “You can see for yourself when we get to the hospital wing.”
But it wasn't just a nightmare. Ron and Hermione had really left him. Rookwood had really tortured him. All those things had happened. And that made it worse. It made the whole hopelessness of his situation crash down on him and Harry tried in vain to stifle a sob. The blond reached out tentatively, laying a comforting hand on the younger boy's shoulder.
The morning of the wedding was even worse than Harry had expected. They barely had time to shovel down their breakfast before Mrs. Weasley started ordering them around. She seemed to come up with a new task every five minutes. Harry had no idea if there was really so much left to do or if she was just trying to keep them from plotting their escape. At first she was only a bit teary-eyed because of Percy’s absence, but then her mood took a turn downward thanks to Sirius and Remus.
Then Draco's hand tightened on Harry's hip and he gave the slightest tug. At least Harry thought he did. So he, in turn, did the only sensible thing. He rolled his hips forward experimentally, drawing a groan from both of them when their clothed erections brushed against each other. Since Draco wasn't protesting, he repeated the movement. The blond pulled him in for another kiss and arched up against him, which was all the incentive Harry needed to start moving in earnest. It took them only a few seconds to find the perfect rhythm.
“That’s easy to find out. There was a spell in one of the books I went through.” Remus let them know.
A few people whooped and there was a smattering of applause. More questions arose. People were talking over each other.
The red-head looked like he was struggling for words, flinching slightly at the look his girlfriend sent him. It was obvious who was wearing the pants in that relationship. Draco found it quite amusing.
But before Lucius could utter the curse that was without a doubt already on his lips, a slender, blonde figure stepped in front of Draco.
This is the last chapter. For now. There's still a lot to tell and there will be a third part to this series. I just don't know when. I have a few plans and ideas, but right now those are rather vague. And my head is bursting with ideas for other fics and I'm so busy with work right now.... so it might be some time before I'll get around to finishing this series. But I have every Intention of finishing it.
“No, it's not.” Potter claimed. When Draco regarded him with raised eyebrows, he muttered: “Okay, maybe that's part of the reason. But mostly I asked you to go shopping with me because I'm selfish.”
He was standing in his father’s study, listening with a growing sense of dread as Lucius explained the dark lord’s plans for him.
Kingsley also warned them to stop saying Voldemort's name. The Death Eaters had put a taboo on the name, which meant that they were able to track down anyone who used it. The kids started calling him you-know-who again, while Sirius stuck to more creative names like old snakeface or Voldy-pants.
Once again thanks for all the lovely comments. They really brightened my days. And I managed a longer chapter this time. Hope you'll like it.
“So... you're saying that … these things only happen, because I've got more power now?” Harry asked.
Draco Malfoy was up to something. Harry was sure of it. He had no idea what it was, but it would definitely be something evil. Malfoy was a Death Eater after all. He was sure of that as well. Unfortunately no-one wanted to believe Harry. Dumbledore just kept telling him to stay away from Malfoy, while the Weasley's and Remus agreed that the blond was too young to be a Death Eater.
"You never do anything for me." Lavender accused, suddenly sounding close to tears. "You don't even wear the chain I got you for Christmas."
When Draco woke up the next time, a couple of hours later, it was to find Harry sitting up against the headboard, sipping a glass of water. Sirius was still there, hovering beside the bed like an overprotective mother. Remus was standing next to him. He smiled at Draco when he realized that the blond was awake.
“Alright. But just for an hour or so.” the Slytherin gave in before Harry could start giving him puppy eyes. He could never resist those and they both knew it.
"You can't go!" Draco pulled something out of his rucksack and pushed it into her shaking hands. "Here. I'm giving you clothes. You're free."
Draco caught Sirius’ eye and nodded. He wanted to be there as well. Possible danger quite aside, this visit would be hard for Harry. To finally see the home he'd lost. Maybe even visit his parents' grave. Harry might need him. And he also hoped that his rationalism would balance the recklessness of the two Gryffindors. At least a little.
“Yeah. To see who managed to walk in on Harry and Draco more often. I think they called it a draw in the end, because Lavender had both of them beat.” Neville said with a shrug, uncaring of her blush. “If you need anything else, my room is right next to theirs. You can’t miss it. It’s the door that has seaweed taped to it.”
Harry had been shocked that this had even included the Gryffindors. He’d had words with Seamus, after he’d caught the Irishman using a tripping hex on an unsuspecting Slytherin seventh year. When Seamus had complained that he boy’d had it coming, because he’d once tortured Seamus during the Carrows reign, Harry had simply told him that it had been the Carrow’s fault and not the boy’s.
About halfway into the party Blaise decided to break up with Mary-Anne. She didn't take it too well and started flinging insults at him, drawing quite a bit of attention. When she started throwing things, Luna and Hermione went to calm her, so Harry and Draco decided to use the distraction and sneak away.
Harry decided to ignore the healers instead. What did they know anyway? He didn't need counselling. He just needed some peace and quiet. Some time to relax. And he needed people to stop annoying him. But he swallowed his pride and told Andromeda about his condition.
“But... Why would she give it to you? She could've just used an owl.” Harry wondered. Why was she writing to him in the first place? She could have just stopped by.
Draco opened his eyes just in time to see a shiver run through Harry’s body. All of a sudden he looked livid.
That didn't make any sense. He'd never been particularly nice to Goyle. He'd mostly ordered the other boy around. Okay, he sometimes helped him with homework and generally made sure that he stayed out of trouble. But they had never really been friends or anything. Crabbe and Goyle had followed him around, because their fathers had told them to. And he had suffered their presence, because it had given him some power.
"Let's take turns. Make sure no-one wears it longer than four or five hours at a time and be sure to take it off before you go to bed. You're more vulnerable in sleep and so more likely to be affected."
And it did feel surprisingly peaceful, just sitting there, watching the sun glistening on the great lake. Draco had no doubts that there was still a hard time ahead of them. The war might be over, but there were still Death Eaters on the loose. His parents would face a trial and he himself would at least be questioned. He had the Dark Mark, even if he'd chosen to turn his back on the Dark Lord and help Harry in the end. And not everyone would be as accepting of his and Harry's relationship as his mother and Harry's friends had been.
Ginny gasped in shock. Justin wisely inched away a few steps. Then the red-head stepped up to Harry and slapped him hard across the face. “You bastard!” she spat, grabbing her boyfriend's hand and dragging him off.
"I'm already doomed as it is. I helped you escape. When the Death Eaters catch me, they're going to kill me. Slowly and painfully. And there's nowhere I can hide. Sooner or later they will catch me." the blond said quietly.
“Well, it’s … ummm.. a creature? I think it doesn’t really exist, but Luna and her father go looking for them and…”
“That's rich, keeping you in the dark, because he doesn't want to put more pressure on you. Like that's ever stopped him before.”
It turned out to be the right decision. Of course Sirius agreed to help and get the rest of the Order on board. He didn't ask too many questions, at least once Harry promised to tell him everything during the Christmas holidays.
“We know that. But what isn't dangerous right now? You know that I'm already on his list, for turning my back on my father.” Draco reminded.
A little, tufty-haired man gave a long and boring speech, but Harry heard none of it. His thoughts were racing and he felt sick, knowing what he had to do and that he couldn't put it off much longer now.
“You don’t understand, Aberforth. We’ve got to get into the castle. There’s something we need to do.”
The red-head ignored the jibe and finally hid the ugly chain in his pocket. He had a thoughtful look on his face.
The Slytherin rolled his eyes. “Of course. If you were some mad, dark lord, would you simply put a bit of your soul into a box and keep it on a shelf for others to find?”
Had his friends even continued looking? For the next Horcrux or the sword of Gryffindor? Or had they abandoned their quest, like they had abandoned him? Like Harry himself had abandoned it these past few weeks?
“No, it's not. I didn't mean to hurt you so badly. I... I didn't know what that spell did. I would have never used it if I'd known.” the dark-haired boy swore.
So he was quite happy with the world, until he rounded a corner and nearly collided with Blaise, who had clearly been waiting for him. For a second they just stared at each other.
He had no idea what to do. The bond and those little snippets of feeling he got from Draco didn't make it any easier. Remembering how it had felt to hold the blond he couldn't help but wonder if it was simply the bond demanding physical contact or if the desire to touch Draco was all himself.
“Okay. Sirius, Ron, Hermione… I know there’s no sense in asking you to leave, but I need to ask you to stay out of the way and be quiet throughout the ritual. Understood?” Remus looked at all of them in turn, waiting for their nods. Hermione and Ron sat down on the couch in the far corner of the room, while Sirius leaned against the wall. Remus turned back to Harry and Draco.
Ron grinned and seemed about to open his mouth to mock Draco, but closed it with a snap when Hermione gushed: "That's so sweet, Draco." before turning to her boyfriend with an accusing look. "Why don't you ever do something like that for me?"
Anyways ... here's the new chapter. And it's a longer one this time. Hope you like it. Please let me know.
“I don't want you to stop trusting him, just because I have a bad feeling. You know him better than I do. And you have your reasons to trust him, don't you?”
He led the way to the 7th floor corridor and paced in front of the wall until the door appeared. The room was smaller this time, with squashy armchairs and a low table, a small couch and a mountain of cushions in front of the fireplace. Harry wasn't really surprised when Draco settled down on the cushions.
The Slytherin quickly shook his head, flashing her a smile. “And miss all the fun? No way. But I'm coming down to Snape's office with you. He might react a little less sour to someone from his own house.”
With a sigh he pulled out the Marauder's Map, searching for the tiny dot labelled 'Draco Malfoy'. When he couldn't find it he grabbed his cloak and headed up to the seventh floor to wait. This time he pulled off the cloak as soon as Malfoy stepped out of the room.
Realizing that he had no choice, at least if he didn't want to risk his reputation, the man grudgingly asked Draco what he needed.
Harry scanned it for a moment, before nodding to the other boy. They left the bathroom and crept along the corridor. Since lessons had already started again, there were not many people around and it wasn't too hard to avoid those who were.
Draco glanced at his companions. Harry was doubled over in pain, clutching his face. Even in the dim light Draco could see that something was wrong with it, though he couldn’t tell what exactly.
“I'd just invite someone if I were you. That'll stop the others thinking they've still got a chance. The party is next week. They're getting desperate.” Hermione reasoned.
They ended up staying for almost an hour, before parting ways and walking back to their respective common rooms. The Slytherin had a hard time keeping the stupid grin off his face. At least until he entered the common room and ran into Millicent, who started shouting as soon as she spied him.
He wondered if anyone even knew that he'd been captured. Probably not. Aside from Ron and Hermione no-one had known about his hunt for Horcruxes. And they had left him. Harry regretted the mean things he'd said to both of them. He was sure that he would never see them again. The last time he'd spoken to his best friends had been in a fit of anger. That knowledge hurt more than anything.
“And we all agreed to that plan. Stop worrying. You couldn’t have known what would happen. And we got away.”
"Sorry." Harry mumbled, stifling his grin. "But look on the bright side - you're rid of her now. When you weren't snogging, she was annoying the hell out of you. You said so yourself." he pointed out.
His words were followed by an uproar from the assembled kids, who insisted that they didn’t want to be evacuated. They wanted to stay and fight.
He could hear footsteps thundering past, so he stayed where he was and waited, holding his breath. When everything was silent again he crawled out of his hiding place. He still couldn't see a thing, so he groped along the wall, until he reached a junction and emerged into another corridor, this one thankfully lit and completely empty.
“Which means that Snape is a half-blood Prince. I told you it wasn't a title.” Hermione grumbled in her best know-it-all voice.
And he set off, so Draco had no choice but to follow him. Harry felt his heart sinking. Their plan was going to shit, before they had even reached the bank. But it was too late to turn back now. They had to see this through.
A loud noise made him look back up to the chandelier. Just in time to see it come crashing down. Bellatrix screeched and tried to dive out of harm's way. Ron sprinted across the room and pulled Hermione into his arms. The chandelier shattered on the marble floor in an explosion of crystal and chains. Shards flew everywhere. Draco felt one grazing his cheek, rousing him from his stupor.
He would have loved to drag Draco away as well. It was a nice party, but he wasn’t having fun. His dress robes felt constricting and he had a hard time keeping his identity hidden. He had to weigh his words carefully and make sure to pretend not to know some people. It was really exhausting. He couldn’t even hold Draco’s hand. And after they’d received a few curious glances, the blond also decided that they’d better separate for a bit. People might put two and two together if Draco was too friendly with the unknown Weasley cousin.
Nott's face contorted in rage and he fired a jelly-legs-jinx at him. But this time the blond was prepared and managed to get a shield up, before countering with a full body bind curse. The other boy ducked and suddenly they were duelling in earnest.
The implication of those words made him blush, but Harry tried to ignore his discomfort and concentrate on his outrage.
Draco rolled his eyes. Harry could see that he was more shaken up than he wanted to admit. “Well, that was fun. But someone else can do the next one.”
“Maybe to him they were a sign of power or something.” Neville said quietly, still a little shy about speaking up.
The blond nodded and led him back outside. The door vanished as soon as they left the room, but another one appeared seconds later. Harry opened it and found himself back in the room from last night. He glanced at the bed and blushed, the memories rushing back full force.
Of course the commotion had also alerted Ron and Hermione, who rushed down the stairs, only to stop dead at the sight of Harry. Ron went deathly pale as he stared wide-eyed at his best friend. Hermione looked like she was about to burst into tears. Draco felt on the verge of tears himself.
"It's obvious that you're blaming yourself. I know you. And no matter what stupid reasoning you've got going in that thick head of yours, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You couldn't have prevented it, but you saved Ron's life. Never forget that."
Hermione thanked them. Once they had disappeared out of sight, she yanked Ron behind a tapestry. Harry and Draco followed cautiously, almost afraid they'd find them kissing again. But Hermione had other things in mind.
"I talked to McGonagall. She gave us permission to leave the castle grounds, as long as we're back in time for dinner." He took a deep breath and finally voiced his brilliant idea. "I thought we could visit Godric's Hollow."
Harry froze. He stared at Sirius, who was only a couple of rows down from where they were standing. Draco put a hand on his shoulder, trying to offer comfort. Taking a deep breath to steel himself, Harry grabbed his hand and together they walked over.
Hermione and Ron gave him a surprised look, which reminded him that he hadn't told them about maybe continuing the DA. The arrival of the food distracted at least Ron for the moment and Harry mouthed “Later.” to Hermione, before digging in as well. Nothing against Kreacher's cooking, but Hogwarts food was still better.
“Yes. McGonagall said Alecto Carrow managed to alert Volemort, before Luna stunned her. So he knows that Harry is here.”
It felt like an eternity had passed when Harry turned away again. Sirius hesitated, glancing towards the church. “I guess they… Should we…?”
They landed in a tangle of arms and legs. Malfoy laughed breathlessly, looking down at him with shining grey eyes and tousled hair and Harry wondered why he'd never before noticed just how beautiful the blond actually was.
They had grown close over the last couple of months, yes. He probably felt closer to the blond than to anyone else at the moment. Ron and Hermione included. He loved spending time with Draco and it didn't even matter what they were doing. Whether they were talking, flying or even studying together.
“Don't worry, I'll be careful.” the blond promised. He wouldn't put it past Nott to plan something sneaky.
“Go. I'll be fine.” Draco urged, knowing that Harry's reluctance was partly because he was concerned for his safety. It was cute, really, but also a bit stifling. He could take care of himself and Harry knew that. They shared a long look and finally Harry nodded. He got up reluctantly and followed Neville.
“Guess so.” the blond agreed with a shrug. “If it makes you feel any better, she knew already. And I guess so did your godfather.”
They parted ways in the Great Hall, heading for their respective tables among quite a few whispers and stares. Of course everyone at Hogwarts knew about their forced bonding. The news had travelled fast. Harry was actually surprised that the Daily Prophet hadn't gotten wind of it yet.
Ron thought about that for a moment. “I guess you’re right. Although an unbeatable wand would give us an advantage.”
“Yeah, Neville’s been telling us you were doing something to bring down you-know-who, but he wouldn’t give us any details.” Lavender complained.
“Really, Mr. McLaggen... It can't hurt that bad any more. That pain relieving potion I gave you must already be kicking in. And the sleeping draught should start working any minute now. Or do you need a higher dose?”
"Hello Harry. Is there a particular reason why you apparated naked into the living room?" Remus asked mildly.
“The parties aren't so bad.” Hermione claimed, once Slughorn had left them alone. Since she was top of the class (right alongside Draco) she had also been welcomed into the Slug Club, as Slughorn kept calling his group of favourites. Harry's grades had gone down somewhat since getting rid of Snape's book, despite Draco's help. But since he was the Chosen One, Slughorn was still trying to add him to his collection.
The bushy haired girl looked unsympathetic. “Yes, you have to. And I would also take Harry's suggestion and confess to McGonagall. Because if you don't, Harry is going to tell her. And even if he doesn't, I certainly will.”
When they reached the doors to the Great Hall, Potter gave him a nervous smile and headed for the Gryffindor table. The blond nodded and went in the opposite direction, while Luna joined her fellow Ravenclaws.
But it did no good. They had their minds made up and wouldn't even listen. The five formed a circle around him, egging each other on. Draco knew it was only a matter of time until they started attacking. And he was right.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, while Harry slowly sipped his tea. It was a strange mixture of herbs he didn't recognize. But it did help to calm his frayed nerves.
“I hate it when you’re right.” the werewolf sighed, before turning to address the kids. “Okay, we’ll apparate together, straight into the Hog’s Head. Like Sirius said, we don’t know what to expect there, so keep your wands ready. Harry, I think it would be best if you and Draco put on the invisibility cloak. Just in case.”
“I didn’t realize that my magic was starting to act up. And then it was too late and … I couldn’t stop it.”
The flash was gone as suddenly as it had come. Harry found himself sitting in the cosy little kitchen again. Draco was staring at him, wide-eyed and pale. He found himself speaking without really meaning to.
Harry’s breathing became deeper and more even. Draco felt the magic around them receding bit by bit, but kept up his litany of soothing words until even the last tendrils faded away. The younger boy looked exhausted and heartbroken, so he pulled him into a tight hug.
“Okay. That's decided then.” Draco cut in, before the girls could start arguing. “Let's meet again in an hour or so. Maybe at the Three Broomsticks?”
Sirius wasn’t much better. He looked ready to jump up and apparate to Hogwarts at a moment’s notice.
“He's with me.” he declared in a loud voice. “So you're either going to sell him whatever he needs, or we're both going to leave without buying anything. Though I have no idea what all those reporters out there, who insist on following me around and watching my every move, are going to think when I leave your shop empty-handed.”
He opened Draco’s present last. At first glance he thought the blond had gotten him a book, but then he noticed that it was actually a photo album. He opened the first page and looked at it curiously. The pictures were obviously quite a few years old and wizard made. They showed a small dark-haired boy, sitting in an ornate crib and waving his tiny fists. Harry leafed through a few more pages, finding more pictures of the same boy, older now and starting to look familiar.
“And since we use wands to channel our magic, we don’t really need to be aware of it. If you want to use wandless magic it’s a different matter.”
Another thing that gave Harry pause was the fact that Theodore Nott was getting increasingly jumpy and nervous. He hadn't confronted Draco again since the Christmas holidays and instead seemed preoccupied with something else. Both Draco and Blaise had seen him sneaking out of the Slytherin dorms at odd hours and they had also noticed that he just disappeared for long periods of time. So far they hadn't found out where Nott was going, despite using the Marauder's Map to track him down.
Adrenalin was still pumping through Harry's veins, mixed with giddy relief over their narrow escape.
“Can we please discuss this later? Preferably in a safer place?” Draco asked. Only to be ignored. He rolled his eyes when Harry and Hermione continued to argue without even sparing him a glance.
“He didn't mean to create it. He doesn't know that he did. The night.... when he killed my parents, a part of his soul ... latched onto me. I'm the last Horcrux.” Harry finished in a whisper.
Harry reigned in his temper as best as he could, trying not to panic. “Maybe I’ve finally learned to choose my friends more wisely.” he spat at the other two Gryffindors, before stalking off towards the boys dorms. Once he was out of sight he leaned against the wall and took a few deep breaths to calm himself. That had been way too close. A minute more and his magic would have lashed out. And things had been going so well lately.
The red-head was lying on his back, with a pained grimace on his face. A dark patch of blood was quickly spreading from his shoulder. Remus was kneeling next to him, talking in a soft, soothing tone, while Hermione frantically searched through her bag.
Harry exhaled shakily. “Draco.” he whispered back. The name rolled off his tongue like he'd just been waiting to finally use it. “Draco.”
“That was because Fred had conjured a mistletoe over our heads. It's tradition. So he practically forced us.” Harry chimed in.
Harry followed him out of the shower and accepted the fluffy towel he was handed. They dried off without looking at each other. He only sneaked a peek at Draco when he reached for his pyjamas, pulling them on almost on autopilot. The blond glanced back and they shared a shy smile.
“I am not mistaken!” Great, now Krum seemed pissed at him for doubting his words. “Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang when he was a pupil there. I valked past that sign for several years. I know it vell.”
“Yes. Unless you want to save me the hassle and tell her yourself.” And with those final words he stormed upstairs to his room, slamming the door.
The others were no help at all. They all agreed that it would be better to concentrate on the Horcruxes (or homework and studying on Hermione's part and Quidditch on Millicent and Ron's part) and leave it to Dumbledore to deal with Nott.
Harry didn't think it would be that easy, but when he closed his eyes, the screams and other sounds of battle died away and he found himself standing in a strangely familiar room. Lucius Malfoy was facing him and Voldemort ordered the blond to fetch Snape.
Draco grabbed Harry’s arm, ready to apparate them out of there, but there was no need. Sirius shouted. “We didn’t kill you!” and the figure exploded in a cloud of dust. Of course the ruckus woke up the portrait of Sirius’ mother. The curtains flew open and she started shrieking. Remus quickly shot a spell at her. With a bang the curtains closed again and the hall fell silent.
Harry smiled softly and with a wildly beating heart he leaned over and pressed his lips to Draco's, surprised, despite everything, when the blond responded immediately. Maybe this day hadn't been so bad after all.
Both of them startled when they finally spied two figures approaching. Draco tensed and held his wand ready, but as the two came closer he recognized Ron’s lanky frame. So did Harry, because he muttered “Thank Merlin!” and ran to meet them at the edge of the protective wards. Draco followed more slowly.
“Alright, listen to me. I know all of you girls are somehow under the delusion that Harry is secretly in love with me. And while I admit that I'd quite like it if this were true, I just can't believe it. And therefore I'm not going to do anything about it. Okay?”
Harry shrugged. “He claimed that she was ill. But Muriel said they never took her to St. Mungos. And Doge idolizes Dumbledore. He told me to let nothing tarnish my memory of him. Like I could just choose to overlook everything that doesn’t add up. I just want to know the truth.”
Malfoy disappeared as soon as she dismissed them, so Harry returned to the Gryffindor common room. But Hermione was obviously still in the library and Ron was once again busy snogging Lavender, so he headed out and decided to visit Hagrid.
Ron looked relieved that Harry hadn't chosen him. Sirius’ face on the other hand was strangely unreadable and Harry wondered if he'd hurt his godfather’s feelings by not choosing him. Maybe he should have at least taken more time to consider.
“Well, I’m sure he’ll explain it to us tomorrow. Or Hermione will. The most important thing is getting rid of the horcrux in you.”
Harry and Ron were released from the hospital wing the next day. McLaggen had to stay a few more days. He still resembled a mummy, with the bandages wrapped all around his body. Harry felt that it served him right and he obviously wasn't the only one. Even the teachers did nothing to find out who'd attacked him and instead decided to believe he'd been clumsy and poured the stuff all over himself.
He strode across the hallway and into the kitchen, heading straight for Kreacher’s cupboard and wrenching the door open. There was a nest of dirty old blankets, just like Draco remembered, but they were no longer glittering with trinkets. Sirius grabbed the blankets and shook them. But all that fell out were a dead mouse and an old book.
For a moment he feared the Slytherin would fight him, but in the end he only slumped back down, leaning heavily against him.
They set off in different directions, walking deeper and deeper into the labyrinth. Draco shivered. He knew that the battle was raging just outside the door, but you didn’t notice anything in here. It was eerily quiet. He could only hear his own footsteps, echoing in the large room.
“I know. Luna sent me a message.” He pulled a golden coin from his pocket and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons they had used for the DA.
“So what you’re saying is Beedle heard a story of three powerful wizard brothers and turned it into a fairy tale?” Harry surmised.
A voice squealing his name was all the warning he got before Pansy practically flew at him, throwing her arms around his neck. Draco laughed and hugged her back just as enthusiastically.
“I... I don't know how to go about this.” he admitted quietly, glancing at Narcissa Malfoy, who was seated across from him in Andromeda's cosy living room.
Harry was awoken by a surprised yell. He slowly opened his eyes, blinking disorientedly at his fuzzy surroundings.
And Voldemort would know that Draco was Harry's weakness and try to use him against the other boy. The risk was too high. For both of them. So he kept quiet and took what little time alone they got.
This chapter has given me so much trouble. The first version was too much like the book. The next one was too boring (at least my beta said so). The next one not plausible enough (again my beta!). So I re-wrote parts of it again and this is the outcome. Hope you'll like it.
“Surely you are not asking me to spy on the headmaster.” Phineas warned, before waxing poetic about the great Severus Snape, first one to follow in his footsteps as Slytherin headmaster.
“Thanks for the offer, but I think it's better if I stay here for now. I'll stop by in a few days, okay?”
Hermione had helped him renew the protections and wards, to make sure that no-one would bother him there. She had also offered to stay with him. As had Ron. But Harry had waved them off. They had tried again, once they were back from Australia, where they had visited Hermione's parents. And again he had sent them away. Just like all the times after that. He didn't want their concern. He just wanted to be alone. They hadn't understood. Probably still didn't. But after a while they had given up on trying.
“Thanks. It’s just… these stupid dress robes… I don’t really feel comfortable wearing something so fancy.”
“I'm not sure. She didn't even tell us she would be commentating.” Neville muttered, sounding slightly hurt. Like they'd have to tell each other everything, just because they were part of the same weird group of friends now.
He made a noise of protest when Draco’s hands left his back and heard a soft chuckle in response. Instead of resuming his ministrations, Draco reached for the shower gel again and started washing Harry’s arms, from the wrist upwards. When he reached his shoulders he slid his hands around to Harry’s front. The Gryffindor shivered as those talented hands skimmed over his nipples and moved further downward. His cock, which had taken an interest almost as soon as he’d stepped into the shower, was fully hard by now. Draco’s hand stopped inches away.
The silence lasted only a few seconds. Then cheers filled the air. The remaining death eaters tried to run away, but most of them were caught before they reached the exit. Harry pulled Draco into his arms, holding him so tight it nearly hurt. Ron joined the hug as well. And then Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Blaise, Neville, Millicent… Everyone was laughing and talking over each other. And Harry had only one thought: It’s over.
Pansy got the hint and dropped the subject. She told him what he'd missed yesterday and offered to let him borrow her notes.
Obviously she did, because she simply nodded and motioned for him to continue. "Could you tell him that his mum is safe and ask him to meet me at the room of requirement before dinner?"
Then there was the fact that Sirius had almost died in the fight at the Department of Mysteries. Only Remus quick reflexes had saved his life and Harry was all too aware of how close he'd come to losing his godfather. His only family. And he also knew that it would have been his fault, for being reckless and running into danger without thinking yet again.
But the blond was always very careful. Opening the door just a crack, just enough to slip through and then quickly pushing it closed again, before Harry even got near it.
The blond could do nothing but stand there and watch in shock. Snape swept onto the scene, closely followed by Flitwick. The barrier didn't stop the potions master and he disappeared up the stairs to the Astronomy tower without breaking stride, while Flitwick bounced back and then tried to help Remus and Tonks.
DADA thankfully meant a mostly practical lesson this time and Harry made it through without getting himself into detention again. But he still lost Gryffindor ten points, which prompted a lecture from Hermione about reigning in his temper. Which of course did nothing for said temper.
“This might not actually do anything, you know. Everyone might just ignore you” Hermione hissed after Harry as he headed up the stairs to the boys dormitory.
“Potter.” Snape drawled once, having appeared unheard behind them as they worked on a pepper-up potion. Harry had flung the powdered bicorn horn so high into the air that it had landed on Snape, dusting his greasy black bob in shimmering iridescent powder. Snape’s expression had been priceless and it had taken everything in Ron not to burst into laughter right there. He’d heard many of his classmates failing to do so behind him.
“Right,” Ron nodded, “And when a bloodline is apparently dead it takes the ministry about six months to assess closest blood relations, to wait for an unexpected claim to appear—and then it all becomes Ministry property.”
Harry just rolled his eyes and clapped the boy on the shoulder. Ron and Hermione gave him enthusiastic hugs hello. She gathered from their greetings that the boy was actually called Draco.
Which was how they found themselves following an agitated Harry to the other side of the Seventh-floor. Hermione asked increasingly bewildered questions the whole time.
Ron didn’t have any words for his best friend. He couldn’t imagine the pain he was feeling, and he couldn’t make the boy share the burden with him. That wasn’t Harry’s way. Harry carried burdens until the weight of it killed him. Then he only asked for more. More weight, like that guy in the Salem Witch trials. More weight.
She grinned ruefully at the group. “You look like an alright bunch- oh, Harry.” She cut herself off and smiled at the gaping boy. The class was used to most new teachers treating Harry a little differently, but Ron knew that for Tonks it wasn’t due to his fame, but because of their friendship. Harry had been owling Tonks since second year though Ron couldn’t for the life of him remember how they knew each other.
“So what?” Fred said, appearing next to Harry’s armoire. “They’re just running the ‘defeat Voldemort’ program from Sirius’ kitchen?”
“Are there actually any plants in the greenhouses that could get you high?” This had been a persistent rumour for a few months now, with Fred and George putting a lot of effort into trying to find out.
“Fleur,” He called, running down the corridor. At the end of the hallway Fleur was opening the door to her office. She turned at the sound of her own name, eyes widening when she saw Harry striding towards her.
This time I flip a green moleskin to a random page and find him sobbing on the floor. His sadness is symmetrical. I cannot see what he sees but for a moment I swear his eyes meet mine in the twisted looking glass.
An odd change came over Dumbledore after they came back for the next term. Or at least, Neville noticed him far more.
“She’s only been in office a few months” Ron said. Luna wondered if Ron had just never developed a sense of self preservation, or if he really just enjoyed riling Hermione up at 8 AM when she was her most volatile. And over politics of all things.
“What’s happened?” harry had demanded, but Ron had looked past him to a nervous looking Neville who was half up from his lounging position.
It was easy to imagine the worst. Susan Bones had left school immediately, whisked away by sobbing relatives into, what could only be presumed as, hiding.
She just shrugged “wait” She said “Give me the reason why you’re both acting like this isn’t a weird thing to do. You don’t have to give details, just broadly”
They had wasted no time in telling their friends. All seven of them, their group of mismatched miscreants, were crowded stiffly into a single compartment. All conversations eventually petering out, candles blown out by the heavy grief and worry in the air.
They stopped outside Harry’s DA room. Luna paced back and forth three times while Draco scrunched his nose at her.
“No” Ginny said blithely “I snooped in their room and found it written down. Then I tested it out and started using it myself”
Ron thought he heard Seamus mutter something along the lines of, “She’s not the only one too far gone—” But he was abruptly cut off by Dean’s elbow to his stomach, and Draco and Harry didn’t seem to hear anyway. Ron snorted, rolling his eyes.
“Well he’s a death eater, of course. But in my time, he became our defence teacher in disguise. He entered my name in the Triwizard tournament and I had to compete, then at the end of the year he sent me to Voldemort so he could be brought back.”
Neville had been surprised to find Hermione and Ron waiting agitatedly in the second-floor bathroom. Hermione seemed to be having a theological debate with Myrtle, but she stopped as soon as she saw them emerge, diving forward to fling her arms around Harry, then Neville in turn.
It baffled her constantly that there were actually people in the world who willingly wanted to do all those things with her.
Hermione looked at Harry, looking pleasantly surprised “Yeah that makes sense” She said thoughtfully, then blushed and looked at Ginny “I mean. That was what we were doing”
Harry nodded, “Just a few hours before I did, actually. I suppose I never had time to process it before I was back here.” Then Harry seemed to shake himself, clearing the cobwebs off himself, “You’ll never guess who the mum was.”
uni is a lot more stress then i anticipated and i accidentally joined a kayaking club that took over my life so i guess? life is strange?
Then Ron had a horrid thought about Harry and Hermione’s Looks that he’d never had before. Previously, when allowing himself a brief glimpse at his feelings, he'd chalked it up to secret plots and schemes he wasn’t privy too. At most, a super-secret nerdy book society. That seemed right up Harry and Hermione’s street.
He went to Dumbledore’s office at least once a day to ask for updates on Sirius Black as information on his release hadn’t yet reached the media and Harry was beginning to worry. The Headmaster had taken to leaving the great hall very quickly after mealtimes so as to avoid the determined boy-who-lived. All that Dumbledore could tell Harry apparently was that the ministry had it under serious review. Harry didn’t seem to think this was enough.
Harry pouted, hands on his hips in either an ironic facsimile of the aforementioned Lost boy or in a very good impression of a petulant five-year old. “Seriously. Ron, Hermione. I need your help in something.”
Arriving on the platform was bittersweet. It didn’t feel like going home to Hermione but instead as if she was abandoning the first place she’d ever felt truly accepted.
“Oh, shit” Harry muttered under his breathe, so quiet that only Ginny and Hermione, who were stood closest to him, heard. Ginny giggled but Hermione scowled and elbowed him lightly.
Lockhart finally made his way out and dazzled the crowd with his ridiculously white teeth. Ginny scrunched up her nose, but she heard her mum give an almost imperceptible squeak and Hermione turned slightly pink. Harry rolled his eyes and nudged her
Harry looked at him head on. “Neville. You go back to the first door, it’s covered in snakes you can’t miss it. Go back there and wait for me. I’ll meet you.”
DA meetings only took place sometimes, usually for fun things like muggle movie nights or get-togethers. It wasn’t as needed when their teachers were consistently good.
“Because I saw you acting weird and followed you down” Ginny half-yelled, exasperated. This was really not the interrogation she’d hoped for.
Harry shook his head, but he didn’t look certain, “I’m not sure. Would Bones do that? She’s accepted that he’s back, told everyone to prepare.”
Harry gaped and Hermione threw her hands up into the air “You are the worst secret keeper Harry Potter. How on earth does she know about that stupid chamber?”
“For Merlin’s sake.” Said Ron, who didn’t like when there was credibility to Harry’s madness. It just encouraged him even more all the other times he was actually wrong.
Draco slumped back against the sofa cushions, brow still scrunched together and looking vaguely tortured. “Yeah” He said quietly “I guess you would be right there”
But Luna kept her eye on Harry. She was certain she was the only one who saw him tug nervously on a thick golden chain around his neck.
Harry shrugged uncomfortably “That’s exactly why I need you to do this. If I start it, or if I’m too heavily connected then the whole thing is forever tainted by the fact that Harry Potter created it. It can never be unbiased. Therefore, it can never be fully trusted” Harry gestured emphatically “That’s why it can’t be me who has the idea to start a newspaper”
They had made it to a fourth-floor corridor barely scraped, although it had taken Harry’s extensive knowledge of secret passageways and hidden stairs for them to make it. It wasn’t an easy task, running from a whole boarding school population.
She demanded “My mum wouldn’t let me get it, she said it was probably too advanced and superfluous to the syllabus. And also, she doesn’t really approve of rampant alliteration.”
By the time Harry was done handing out gifts they all had equally sizeable piles of gifts and both Hermione and Luna were looking at theirs in confusion.
“Had to get yourself fucking killed, me along with you,” Neville said. All he could see was red. Red flames and red anger and the green of Harry’s eyes. Like Fiendfyre.
Hermione’s lips curled up reluctantly at the corners. It did explain a lot of Harry’s strange behaviour, she had to admit. Like how he seemed to always know when Draco was about to insult Ron or the few times he’d called someone by name even though they’d obviously never met him before.
“Well, no.” Harry conceded. “I was hoping that this time would go a lot better than the last. After all, I have insider information. I’ve literally robbed it before.” He shrugged, “And I can’t just leave the horcruxes in the Chamber of Secrets indefinitely. I need to get them all, then destroy them.”
“How the hell do you know this stuff?” Ginny said, from the foot of Harry’s bed. They had all crowded into Harry’s room to ostensibly transfigure two extra beds. In actuality, they had all sprawled across the room to discuss the events of the kitchen.
But then there was Snape. Ah, the tortured tale of Harry and Snape. Hermione was sure it could be a lost Shakespeare play. Harry seemed determined to avoid the professor at all costs. This became difficult of course in Snape’s own lessons. Harry had taken to slouching so low in his chair so as to avoid the teacher’s line of sight that he had more than once accidentally slid to the floor. On one of these occasions Harry had seemingly decided that the best course of action would just be to remain under the table for the entire lesson. Snape, who hadn’t spotted Harry before the boy’s impromptu trip to down under, took this as an opportunity to monologue grandly about
“Come on, then,” Then Harry was shifting their hands so that he gripped Neville’s palm in his own, dragging him down the corridor.
The Professor himself seemed to take account of this odd situation “Not in the running away mood today, Potter? You know It doesn’t count as catching up on your missed time if you dawdle about.” he sneered.
I can feel cold wind whistle through the cracks. Next to me the stacks of his lives taunt me and the floor beneath me is cold.
“But wizards are great racist bullocks and they won’t take affirmative action unless it’s wizard lives in danger.” Sirius said drily. Remus said, but nodded along.
That was all they said on the matter, and those were the only questions they would give straightforward answers to.
. We need to be prepared. The younger students especially.” He looked at Harry, “It will come for them too. It’s horrible, but we can’t pretend we’re all normal students anymore.”
Neville had shaved his own head and was deeply hoping that the spell they’d found to regrow hair would work. He didn’t think the skinhead look was right for him, however much he knew Sirius would be all over it.
They all agreed and walked down the long, cobbled street until they reached the bank. Before they could enter, however, a shrill voice rang out.
“Editor in Chief” Luna corrected despite herself “Why can’t you do it? You’re more well known than me anyway. Everyone thinks I’m loony”
Grimmauld place- as Luna found out the townhouse was ironically called- was a much different place to live then her home. Her father wasn’t dull or boring by anyone’s standards, but he often lost himself in his work and left Luna to her own devices. Sirius and Remus weren’t like that. They seemed overjoyed to spend their time joking and laughing with the three teens occupying their house. Sirius often started the morning by announcing what that days ‘adventure’ was going to be over breakfast.
It was the look on Harry’s face that finally convinced her. He looked positively crushed. She looked into his eyes and saw a boy who was truly doing the best he could, even if his best sometimes fell short.
I soon find that the worst pain is every almost perfect universe. The lifespan and the hero and the boy- but no parents. The parents and the lifespan- but no boy, no happiness. The boy- no survival. A missing ingredient. A loss before the taking. A missed beat.
“You were pen pals if I remember correctly.” Harry said blithely, looking at Hermione sideways. Ron spluttered. Harry laughed, muttering to himself. “Yes. I remember you acting like that too.”
They almost made it to the end of the corridor when the first crazed student made their way around the end of the corridor they were heading for. A five-foot nothing first-year set Neville’s pulse racing in fear.
The truth is, what? He thought desperately, but the worry was soon overlapped by the rushing tide of sleep.
who thought it was acceptable not to turn up to lessons and who relied too much on their unearned fame. Snape seemed rather agitated by Harry’s obvious wish to avoid him and spoiled for a fight any time Harry mistakenly made himself present in the bat-like teacher’s vicinity.
The pages of this boys life run on in an endless marathon. I want to burn this place to the ground. Watch every page become mangled and unreadable. I want to never see these green eyes again. I want them shut to the world, finally blind to all the brutal pain and loss. Is this my punishment? To watch an inferno burn itself to embers, a life lived itself to pale imitation.
“What’s that?” Draco asked, looking in alarm at the record player as if he thought it might be a torture device Luna was going to use on him.
Quirrell wasn’t the only teacher that Harry acted strangely towards. Harry seemed to hold a strange irreverence for Professor McGonagall. Honestly Hermione couldn’t find anything too nefarious in this though. McGonagall was very quickly working her way on to Hermione’s personal hero’s list. She was just so
“Nothing’s worse than seeing your folks snogging” Ron said sagely, and Ginny shuddered in agreement.
Dumbledore gave a small sound which could almost be classed as a scoff if it wasn’t coming from their fastidiously benign headmaster. “Harry, there are things you must know.”
She nodded frantically and pulled the mask on over her head She felt her hair fluff up ridiculously, but she didn’t care. Harry Potter was going to let her be a part of the adventure.
“Oh, no.” Harry said glibly “I was planning on being extra clumsy with this cursed magical artefact before you said that Hermione. Thanks”
They were silent for a stretch and Ron weighed up the pros and cons of sneaking off to bed without them noticing. But he knew that it wasn’t what the Harry J Potter school of eavesdropping would have him do, so he stayed still.
She looked around. She was in a damp stone room. The room suddenly got a shade darker, and Ginny realised that the entrance in Myrtle’s bathroom must have closed behind her, blocking the light. She pulled her wand from her sleeve and muttered ‘Lumos’. She only hesitated a moment before she began to walk forward, following the echoing sound of what must be Harry’s footsteps. She shivered deeply against the damp chill of the place.
And then he slid down the creepy tunnel in the floor of the creepy girl’s bathroom. Because, Neville presumed, he was Harry Potter and Harry Potter’s movements were unplottable.
Pandora Lovegood had died in a flash of purple smoke. A spell gone wrong. A spell gone so terribly wrong. Luna had been perfectly safe in her bubble across the room, screaming.
“It really isn’t that big of a deal.” Harry said, though his face said the opposite. Ron braced himself for the truth. “You see the truth is—”
But he was cut of by Harry’s cry of joy as he flung himself down the stairs and wrapped his arms around the man tightly. He was so thin that Harrys short arms only just missed meeting around the back.
“Harry,” Hermione said, in an odd, strangled tone. She was staring at Harry with horror. Ron was looking at Harry, too. They both looked like they had seen a ghost.
In and between their little adventures was stuffed two other things. First, a harried effort from the adults to fit Christmas cheer and tradition around their own busy schedules of meetings and scouting missions. Second, the plan.
Hermione rolled her eyes and Ron frowned, “You just don’t want him to know you weren’t friends in the past.”
spell. The first spell her mother ever got patented. Luna had been pleased to notice that no one had ever stuck anything else over it.
Ron followed is companions as they marched out of the common room and down the seventh-floor corridor. Both of their shoulders were tense.
Luna had brought them with her to see the thestrals. Ginny hadn’t entirely believed in their existence until a couple of visits in. Seeing the ground beef quickly disappear in bite-sized increments had been pretty compelling evidence.
“Harry, no offence. I robbed a bank for you no questions asked. I think we can assume at this point that I’m all in.”
It takes another ten minutes for the group of Aurors and the criminal to finally take off, but finally they were disappearing across the grounds and towards the gates. Luna walks over to Harry who’s still staring after them pensively.
Neville took the opportunity to take in the crowd. ‘These times’ referred to the events of the end of last school year, which Neville had been told in strict confidence by Harry and Ron.
Harry began screaming out hisses at the door, even as they were metres away. He was begging it to open, Neville knew even if he couldn’t understand. Stone snakes were shifting upon the door, moving as if releasing a padlock.
The blush took dominion over Draco’s entire face. It was quite possibly moving from an embarrassed blush to a full-fledged Draco Malfoy patented frustrated flush. After three weeks of friendship Luna had begun to learn these nuances. Harry had quirks like these too- like how he always stumbled over simple sentences or when he said incongruous things before looking panicked and leaving the room in mid-conversation. Luna put Harry’s oddities down to the general anomaly of his entire presence.
Ron had stayed over at Harry’s house a couple times over the holidays, always returning with some madcap story of Harry’s godfathers to tell Fred and George. He’d refused, however, to ‘scope out’ Harry’s bedroom like Ginny had asked. Idiot.
“You found Peter” Sirius said, staring down at the boy in wonderment. Hermione’s mother was still watching the scene with slight confusion.
Ginny had run off crying. That’s what she hates the most. It makes her feel weak when they can get to her so easily. When the people you’ve looked up to your whole life treat you like your less than you are, it hurts. She’d eventually wandered, between bouts of tears which she had furiously rubbed away, down to the edge of the lake. She’d been skimming stones and brooding for at least half an hour at this point.
“You always know what to say.” He said into Ron’s shoulder, “Thank you. Thank you for being my friend.”
The day before had been Luna’s birthday, so she’d gotten Luna angel cake and lemonade from the house elves in the kitchen and they’d had a sleepover sequestered in Luna’s Ravenclaw four-poster bed. Ginny had gotten Luna the newest Weird Sister album, because Luna liked to go through all of their songs with a fine-toothed comb and find clues that pointed to Donoghan Tremlett, the bass player, being secretly dead. She also passed on her mother’s present; a knitted pair of radish earrings and a box of home-made toffee.
“It wasn’t her fault,” Harry said, sighing and doing the same on her other side, “I’ll make sure they don’t do anything idiotic. She won’t get in trouble.”
Ron and Harry spent minimal time on their hair- only attempting to get it to lay flat and then giving up when it did whatever it wanted anyway. But they did spend a raucous half-hour cheering Neville on and watching in fascination as he fastidiously did his hair.
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two fateful souls..." She began.
Suddenly, it didn’t seem all that bad to have a future full of no friends but her parents. Hermione Granger had magic. Hermione Granger would always be magical.
Neville wasn’t as close to Draco as the other three were, but he was a good friend when Neville had needed it. He was the reason, Neville was sure, that the Slytherins had left him completely alone since second year.
“I can’t believe you used a museum to lure me into another one of your plots.” Hermione groaned, tugging at the box braids that her aunty had put in for her the other day to help stop her hair from frizzing in potions.
Sirius spits on the ground near Pettigrew’s feet “You were our friend because James let you hang around with us. And in return you killed him”
Harry and Draco both eyed the package with interest. Draco because he’d never actually seen a pen before and Harry because he suspected everyone of nefarious behaviour despite being the most suspicious person to ever exist.
“Yes,” Dad said with uncharacteristic snappishness, “and the wizarding world has just had it’s first dark attack in over a decade.”
“Hermione was Krum’s?” Ron yelled, entirely to loudly. Draco leant around to give the three of them an incredulous look, before returning warily to his conversation with Luna about The Oracle.
Ron grinned, gripping Hermione’s hand out of excitement. Hermione knew that Harry had told Ron some about his fraught home life.
“I thought you were all about elf rights,” Ron had joked but had been silenced by Hermione’s crazed eyes as she glared at him over the rim of an overflowing mug of frankly terrifyingly strong tea.
“Thank you for the lovely night, Ronald.” She said into his ear, her hair engulfing them both. It smelled like eucalyptus and lilacs.
Hermione was surprised, however, when ten minutes after everyone else had left for the feast Harry suddenly sprung up from his seat (scattering the playing cards they’d been using all over the rug) and declared they were going on an adventure.
Harry looks at her, brow furrowed. “I suppose” He looks back after the group of auroras “I suppose I have to be alright”
Ginny stood in silence for a meant, processing everything that she had been a witness to and everything she had heard that night. One thing still stuck out to her, above any other question she might have.
So easily everything could have been different. She could have been all alone- Loony Lovegood and her no-friends. Now she was Loony Lovegood and her no-good friends. A rat-pack always in trouble, always together.
Luna slipped shoes on (the first time she’d worn any in days, she realised) and headed off down the hill towards Ottery St. Catchpole. She walked along the river. The Otter was slow today and shallow, shrinking away from its banks. It had been an unusually pleasant summer, especially where they were at the bottom of the country.
In fact, she thought of all the girls she knew. Angelina, Katie and Alicia from the team. Her roommates, Megan and Lucinda. Professor McGonagall and Sprout and Madame Hooch. Luna. Luna, Luna, Luna. They weren’t less because they were girls or women, or more. They were just equal. Just as different and odd and brilliant as all of her brothers were.
“I believe you” Harry said, the green eyes that contrasted so heavily with his brown skin boring into her own chocolate eyes. He was looking for something “I’m just not sure which you I’m actually believing”
For Ron’s birthday in March, which happened to fall on a Wednesday, Harry and Hermione postponed that weeks DA meeting. Instead the Weasley’s, Luna, Draco, Hermione, Harry, Seamus, Neville and Dean all threw him a surprise film-night. Hermione had been thrilled to learn that muggle equipment worked in the Room of Requirement (which Harry had reluctantly explained the mechanisms of for the party).
“Oh, excellent.” Draco said as they all stood up to cheer and peer across the lake. “It’s Delacour.”
“What are you doing?” He asked, but his question was answered when the sink suddenly shifted, jolting out of place with its neighbours.
“What are you doing hanging around this riff-raff, Draco? Were they bothering you?” Lucius said, his hand going to clutch Draco’s shoulder tightly.
Then she grabbed Tonks’ hand, dragging the woman ahead and talking at her a mile a minute in a mix of French and English.
fourth year, I suppose.” Tonks said absently, gesturing to them. Then she picked a paper from Fleur's stack and began to scan it.
Neville Longbottom couldn’t comment on having strangers in the house, although he too was a full time resident of the house and had been since the beginning of the summer holiday. That had been in June and even now, in August, he still wasn’t used to it.
It had been this odd group which had comforted him at the end of last year. These that he sat with on train journeys. Who always invited him to DA meetings and birthday gatherings and odd games of truth or dare?
“Oh legal shmegal” Lockhart boomed, smiling winningly for the bemused audience “Don’t you want to be photographed with me? Together, you and I would be worth the front page”
Ginny blushed as red as her hair but smiled back at Luna, reassured. “Well I thought we could go first, yeah?”
Ginny laughed loudly and Luna winked at her. Everyone else stared at the blonde girl with bewildered amusement. All except Harry, who was also grinning and looking at Luna fondly like he was used to all the weird thing she said. It made Ginny’s stomach squirm slightly. She pushed it away as probably her just being jealous that Harry was looking at Luna instead of her.
“It was true in the other world.” Harry said with a shrug. “Plus, I just think they want to believe it, you know?”
By breakfast on their first day of classes they had definitely noticed. They kept exchanging worried glances. It only added fuel to Ron’s indignant flame. Ron had an inwardly spiteful animated conversation with Seamus and Dean about the Triwizard tournament that had been announced last night.
Another look was passed between the two second-years like a tennis serve. It was Hermione who hit back this time “Because the less people who know, the safer it is”
And the thing about having small but loud parts of you that were bitter was that they grew. They got bigger and louder until eventually all you were was a bitter screaming thing begging the world to
She’d honestly thought that things had gotten better after she was at Hogwarts too. Maybe they had finally opened their eyes and seen her for who she was not who they had decided she was. Fred and George trusted her by letting her sit in on their planning; Ron would talk to her about his actually problems; Percy had stopped talking to her like she was still two years old. But of course, they would still just see her as a little girl. Useless Ginny. Just go back into the kitchen and help mum out, why don’t you?
Harry’s strangeness had been sort of amusing in the beginning. Now she was just a little bit worried that it was going to end up putting all of their friends in danger.
Sirius was fixing his cuffs, which were shaped like tiny little howling wolf heads, the only part of his outfit missing were his coattails. Neville had wondered why the grooms had decided to marry in muggle dress, before it had been explained to him that Remus had been raised a muggle, despite his father’s wizarding blood, and wanted to honour his heritage. “I just want to piss off my dead family.” Sirius had said, laughing. “And I look great in a suit.”
“Research.” Hermione said sarcastically, causing Harry to blush lightly. He still wouldn’t explain the wolfsbane thing to her. All she’d gotten out of him was that it was another ‘seer’ thing. She’d ruled out him being a werewolf however when the full moon had come and gone without any suspicious behaviour. In fact, she could account for his whereabouts all night; He’d fallen asleep on the sofa in the common room, drooling.
“Because you are so hiding something!” Ginny cried, just this side of petulant “You were sneaking around my room and I know you took something—” Harry winced “and you and Hermione are always sneaking about and coming back at odd times and whispering at each other! And I found Hermione’s notebook”
Harry had said. She thought back to the summer and how he had always treated her as a person of equal interest to any of her brothers. She thought of Hermione; brave and smart and acerbic in equal turns. She wasn’t less because she was a girl.
She swung her legs up and over the log, swivelled so she was sitting up and made grabby hands at a dishevelled Harry. He held out the pumpkin pasty, wrapped in a napkin.
Luna smiled and stroked the cat. She bent down next to its ears and whispered “I think your dads just got engaged. You better be excited”
“Is the ‘greater good’ a real thing? Or is it just a thing people say to excuse horrible actions? Because it sounds like bullshit to me- er, sorry. It sounds like rubbish to me. But I need it-“ Harry stopped, voice gone high with stress “I need to do something”
Mum was predictably rather shocked when they returned home and told her that Harry had caused an arrest of a predominant ministry man’s supposedly dead son as he tried to cast the mark of a supposedly dead dark leader.
Hermione had her trusty little blue notebook. It was almost full. She was going to have to owl her dad to send her a new one.
They stood like that for a while, Harry slowly dragging breathes into his body. Then suddenly Harry shifted and flung his arms around Harry in a tight, crushing hug.
Sirius and Remus remained in contact with Harry via a constant stream of letters all through the next term. Hermione’s mother also informed her that she’d struck up a friendship with the couple who had been invited to the Granger’s most recent potluck. Hermione wasn’t sure how her mother would feel if she knew that Sirius was an ex-convict, but she supposed that what her mother knew wouldn’t hurt her.
He turned his head and looked at her. They were mirrored then, knees tucked up and feet tangled, heads resting on the cool window.
“It all seems pretty… home-spun.” George said, appearing next to the wardrobe. Neville could only tell them apart because they’d slipped Weasley jumpers with their initials on. Then again, he had no idea if they were wearing the right one.
Ron saw Sirius shoulders shrug in the embers, “Who knows? But it’s safer to follow up on every sighting.”
“Go on.” Harry said grimly, and, in that moment, Ron could see the much older person hiding behind his best friends’ eyes.
“No one’s ever wanted to be my friend except you” Luna said, voice not changing from its usual bland honesty. “No one likes me except you and daddy”
The lower vaults were built like rows of verandas, all looking over into a cavern in the middle. A cavern containing a screeching dragon.
Harry does an odd full body spasm and almost knocks over a jug of pumpkin juice. Hermione flushes darkly and tells him. “Ronald people have
“I always thought this would be a cool place to hang out,” Harry said, benignly looking around the chamber. Neville questioned his sanity, not for the first time in the last twenty minutes.
Ron knew that Hermione often wrote to the bank demanding better treatment for the animals. It was a side project of her house-elf campaign.
The morning of September first was unsurprisingly hectic. All four of them woke up late, blamed the others for this, and spent the whole morning bickering and alternatively dodging/throwing forgotten items around the house in the vain hope that they would reach already overstuffed trunks.
with 12 exclamation points afterwards. Suffice to say Ginny’s crush on Harry was definitely on the decline.
“Run!” Harry hollered, finding his way to his feet and sprinting towards Neville just as another comet of green fire burst forth to take him.
“I’m Psychic,” Harry said, at the same time Hermione said, “Dumb-luck,” and Ron said, “We’re governmentally trained spies.”
Hermione stepped back from Neville, hand over her mouth. “You didn’t,” She said, more of a statement then a question. Clearly, they were aware of Harry’s idea.
“Oh shush, you misfit orphans.” Draco said, rolling his eyes. “I wanted to see Remus and Sirius tie the knot finally. They’ve only been talking about it for a millennium.”
They stopped once, and Harry hissed again at something before leading Harry through some kind of doorway- like the portrait-hole. Then after another small tunnel Neville felt the air open up around him. They were somewhere bigger now. A chamber.
“That’s what we think, too. They’ve increased muggle security in most European cities but—” Remus was cut off.
Their first lesson, and the many which followed after, proved that though she may be young, Fleur Delacour was astoundingly competent. And terrifyingly good at curses.
Neville nodded jerkily, spinning around on his feet so fast he almost fell over sideways. He was grateful when Sirius didn’t laugh.
“Not with your knowledge you cheater.” Ron huffed. Then he frowned, “Wait a minute. The bet we made at the world cup—”
That was the first time anyone ever referred at Hermione Granger as someone who might be good at having friends. She wasn’t a seer herself, but she had a hopeful feeling that it wouldn’t be the last.
Ron frowned, glancing at Krum. He seemed to be intently reading the blurb of a book, though Ron thought it was taking him longer than it should be. Must be because it’s in English, he thought.
magic?”) when Harry suddenly shot up from dawdling on Hermione’s plush bedroom floor with is Plan Face on. No good ever came of Harry’s Plan Face.
Then Harry Potter comes blazing into Ron’s train compartment with a baffled Hermione Granger in tow, headed straight towards him like Ron Weasley is the most special thing in the world.
The tunnel twisted often, like a drainpipe, and felt rough against his skin. He kept his hands in the air as if he were on a muggle-rollercoaster. Remus had taken them all to a muggle theme park in the summer. Sirius had loved every minute. Neville had very much not.
They waited outside the classroom, the Gryffindor students in two neat rows along the corridor. They’d done this same dance for so many years now they didn’t need telling anymore, just chatted quietly between themselves and waited for their teacher to summon them into the room.
“Don’t.” Harry croaked, standing still. He clutched his hair at the roots, rubbing his eye sockets with the butt of his hands. He seemed wrecked “Don’t.”
“Alohomora,” He said, not exactly expecting that to work. When it didn’t, he wracked his brains for the counter-spell to colloportus. Then, he casted that too.
A boy with blonde hair cries over a casket and thinks that he should have been smarter. Loved someone with the ambition to live, not the bravery to die a hero's death.
The boy looked up at her, startled, and stared at the red and gold foil wrapped biscuit in her hand.
“It’s all Amelia Bones this, Fudge that blah blah blah. Who cares?” Ginny threw her hands into the air. The grass she’d been angrily ripping up fell over her like slightly damp confetti.
Harry gave a short laugh. Hermione looked past Ron to see him. He was staring rather pitifully at the house. His eyes were glistening a little. “You’re right, Hermione. It is stupid. Welcome to Number 12 Grimmauld Place.”
“I was twelve. How much duress were you really under?” Hermione joked, shifting three chairs out from under dusty tables and into the middle of the room.
“A spell Fred and George invented” she shrugged “It’s like a muggle repellent charm but instead it makes people suddenly stop being curious when they come to investigate what you’re doing. It makes mum leave Fred and George alone when they’re inventing”
She looked at him, trying to put on an air of confusion even through her revealing blush. Neville spotted Luna over her shoulder, dressed in yellow and dancing with her father and Harry in odd patterns.
The Beaxbatons students were ecstatic, and the other two schools were in high spirits too, despite their loss. They all cheered and laughed on the long trudge back to the castle.
At the end of term feast, the group positioned themselves strategically with all three Gryffindors on the bench facing the Ravenclaw table and Draco right ahead of them. They spent the whole dinner (including Dumbledore’s slightly frazzled speech) in an elaborate game of charades, with a few confused Hufflepuffs caught in the crossfire before they eventually gave in and moved out of the way.
“I need to get to dinner.” Another familiar voice said tersely. Neville frowned. He knew for a fact that Harry had just left after having dinner in the great hall with their group.
Kreacher let out a second of what was sure to have been an almighty screech, before slamming his hands over his mouth. The whole room waited in silence for a few seconds. Harry and Kreacher were listening out for something and when it didn’t come, they both relaxed.
Harry just shrugged, “Or I could be the greatest seer of all time.” Then he grinned, “Oh dear, if only we had someone who could tell us which one it was.”
Neville had never been quite sure how he became involved in their tightknit group of seven. He wasn’t really sure how Draco had ended up there, either. Death eaters’ kid as he was. Or strange Luna Lovegood. In fact, the only person who made any sense was Ginny, dragged along by her older brother.
On their way back down from Gryffindor tower Hermione lead them instead to an abandoned classroom on the ground floor, much to Draco’s further confusion. Hermione had lied and told him that she’d heard a rumour there was a boggart down there and she wanted to see it. Draco had accepted this is just one of the many extreme things Hermione was prepared to do n the name of education.
“‘- I hope I live another two millennia so I can learn to fall in love with you in a billion new ways” Lupin finished softly.
When Hermione looked back, there was suddenly a whole new townhouse squeezing itself between numbers 11 and 13. It had a shade darker bricks then the rest of the row and when the door appeared it was a deep black compared to the other houses London-red front doors. The windows were obviously grimy even from here.
Harry’s eyes kept roaming over the map frantically- then they stopped. “Fuck!” Harry yelled, throwing the map to the ground and tugging his hands through his hair.
But before Ginny could finish Cedric was breaking the surface of the water, Cho Chang gasping for breath in his arms Krum followed not even moments later, a bulky Durmstrang boy in hand.
Neville gaped. Harry had done it. He had kept the fire contained. It was going to be okay. Harry turned around, looking at Neville with bright eyes and the beginning of a smile curling at his mouth.
“Shh” Sirius said, smiling nervously “Let me- Let me do this properly, yeah?” His eyes began to fill with tears “God. God it really hasn’t been very easy for us has it, Moons?”
“Nymphadora.” Fleur trilled, the name sing song in her accent. They all exchanged looks as Tonks gave no protest. “I must thank you, merci beaucoup. Mille merci á vous. You helped me win.”
The rest of the girls came down after, dressed in pinks and lavenders. Parvati was dressed in a beautiful purple sari and looked surprisingly well matched on Neville’s arm. They smiled at each other awkwardly.
Dumbledore- who looked oddly even more impressive in his candy pink, cat patterned night clothes- looked a little bit like he thought he might still be having a dream. In fact, he’d had that same look on his face ever since Harry had knocked on his chamber door and demanded an ‘audience’ with him. He just stared at the shoebox, which Harry had flung on to the wizard’s coffee table, with befuddlement.
The answer was tied into those unknowable truths, the ones you knew and yet didn’t know- learned and yet didn’t face in yourself. As if by never looking in the mirror you might somehow change the reflection.
“You don’t have to punish yourself Kreacher.” Harry muttered, rubbing his hand over his brow and looking far older than his eleven years. “But I do need the locket.”
This is how Luna knows that Draco Malfoy is going to be her True Friend. It’s also why she feels comfortable laughing and calling him an idiot when she goes to visit him in the hospital.
. We can’t break into Gringotts. And before you say it, we are not breaking out on a dragon. Those poor creatures have been through enough.”
Ginny was on her way back from the Great hall on Valentines day- where Ginny and Luna had munched happily on heart shaped French toast and made fun of Valentines day in its entirety- when she spotted Harry Potter entering the second-floor girls’ bathroom. This was weird twofold. 1. No one used the second-floor girls’ bathroom. 2. Harry potter was not a girl.
“Why do you need to go there now?” Neville said, sharp. He thought that there were probably more pressing matters at hand than a thousand-year-old chamber.
Neville had been placed on disguise duty, while Harry focused on protective charms, Ron on strategy and Hermione fluttered madly between them all with biting critique and organisation.
The thoughts swirled in his head, making him frown, and he had almost moved on to full existential dread mode when—
“I guess I just… know a lot of the stuff already” Harry said, shrugging and sitting down on a bean bag.
The residents of the kitchen all stared at each other in confusion, though after Ron went and talked to him, they all agreed not to mention it to his face again.
They both watched for a long moment, though they couldn’t hear anything. Then Tonks shifted ever so lightly to the left. And there on the ground in front of the gates-
“Here,” Remus said softly as his mum stared at Sirius with a blank curiosity and he chatted away to her. “We looked through some of your grandmothers’ things.”
They drank, Neville only butterbeer, in companionable misery until the wedding ended. It was surprisingly pleasant.
ruined by it, because frankly mother’s had me in Paris half the summer and I’ve had rather more escargot and frogs legs then any Brit’s stomach can stand."
Which Ron thought, on the whole was a pretty hypocritical thing to say to one’s best friend when ones best friend had seen the way one acted around certain snarky blondes.
The sound of a scuffle and a bark preceded the experience of a large shaggy black dog bounding down the stairs. On the final-but-one step the dog shifted, a quick anthropomorphic change, and a man stood in his place. Luna had seen Professor McGonagall change often enough to not be too shocked, but it was still a surprise.
“Harry! Ronald!” A cloud of bushy black hair whipped by Ginny and engulfed Harry. It was the girl from the picture. Hermione, she thought. Ron was grinning so brightly at the girl that Ginny thought it might crack his face wide open.
Harry Potter was strange, Hermione couldn’t deny it. There were just certain things about the boy that didn’t seem to click. Unlike the rest of the first years, Harry never got lost and acted as if he knew every inch of the castle off by heart. When Hermione questioned this, asking if he’d ever been to Hogwarts, Harry had simply said that he’d grown up with second hand knowledge of the school from his Aunt, who had heard it from his mother.
Molly Weasley was desperately nice, a far more maternal figure than his late Gran had been. She fussed over him desperately. So much that Harry quipped it was nice to have a break. Arthur was kind to a fault, listening intently as Neville awkwardly stuttered through an odd fact about plants. He then excitedly had Neville explain to him the differences in the muggle plant kingdom, which Neville did as best he could.
Hermione and Ron exchanged another worried look before following quickly after him. Ron threw a harried “bye,” over his shoulder at Kreacher.
Ginny was watching bemusedly. “You know I’ve always thought that the gambling culture at Hogwarts was slightly worrying.”
Her Slytherin girlfriend Kassandra (in charge of the Layout) stood slightly behind her grinning and handing out copies to slightly intimidated students. But there actually seemed to be a lot of interest in the paper which made Luna unreasonably joyful for a project Harry had practically shanghaied her into.
Despite himself Ron turned on automatic to share a grin with Harry. This was going to be a fun year.
“Hermione,” Harry said with obvious surprise. He must not have seen her in the common room. He looked down at the rattling box in his hands, back up at her, and then back down. “This…uh…this isn’t what it looks like?”
“No. Had to save the world. Keep everyone safe. People are dying, Nev. People are dying and I could stop them.”
The three conspirators shared one final look of conspiracy, then Harry sighed, taking the satchel off of Hermione’s shoulder and pulling out the contents.
She brandished this piece of evidence at him as her magnum opus. Harry just blinked at her in confusion. “What notebook?”
“She won’t! We have an agreement. No eating anything me-shaped.” Harry said this calmly, as if he was certain a great bloody big snake would keep it’s word.
Draco didn’t talk until the first side had finished. “This is beautiful” He said, and Luna smiled at him and turned the record over. California began to play. Luna lost her self in memories of her mother. Her mother had said that any time she felt lost she would simply choose a record and listen to it completely with her eyes closed and suddenly she would be exactly who she was he first time she heard it. She said that records were like cameras; they snapped you and you were caught forever exactly as you were the first time the notes flowed through your blood.
Hermione was pretty sure this boy needed a friend. Or a psychologist. (She filed away a memo in her mind to ask for more information about magical healthcare and mental health attitudes)
They trailed about in one cluster, Hermione and Harry leading them like ruffled ducks. They loitered in record shops and laughed as Fred and George pawed their way through vintage 70’s jackets in a myriad of disgustingly clashing shades.
They burn and I cannot watch them anymore. They burn and I cannot shed enough tears to put them out.
All seven of them followed behind him as he led them to King’s Cross carpark. He stopped in front of a regular green three-door car.
He made his way to the lake, shedding his jumper and rolling his shirt sleeves up as he went and the heat finally began to hit him. At the lake edge, he sat on a fallen log, kicking his socks and shoes onto the stony shore.
Ron perked up slightly “And Draco said that if he could get a way from his mum, he’d meet us at Fortescue’s at three”
“Blindfolds,” Harry said, reaching in to take a pink strip of cloth. “I used to use muggle eye-masks, but Ginny brought me a load of these that she got off her mum. Scarp fabric, I’m guessing,”
“That man is a disgrace” Arthur spat at his retreating figure. Ginny reached out to catch Luna’s hand in hers again, seeking comfort. Luna squeezed it gently and smiled dreamily at her.
“Harry, my boy,” Dumbledore said in a tone that was just south of friendly, “We have important business.”
But Hermione cut him off, “We’re getting a cup. It’s a Hufflepuff artefact,” She looked at Neville steadily, “And we’re stealing it from the Lestrange vault.”
He wasn’t like she’d imagined. His skin was a dark tan, and his hair was black and unkempt, waves and curls and straight pieces of hair sticking up in every direction. In the photo he kept flinging an arm around Ron and then shoving a hand back through his hair to keep it from being blown about by the wind. When he did that you could see his scar, golden-red against his forehead. His glasses were round and crooked and unflattering. He was the shortest person in the photograph. He was grinning blindly, and near the end of the captured loop he would laugh at something the pointy blonde boy at the end of the row said and throw his head back. She watched the picture over and over when she did the washing up and had it almost memorised. Arm flung around Ron, hair pushed back, raucous laugh. Then again and again on repeat.
If girls were the way her brothers had taught her they were, then Ginny internalised that girls must be bad. This lesson, even more than not being able to keep up or needing to fight for food, was the one she would spend the rest of her life trying to unlearn.
Dad, who had taken that Wednesday off to come with them, stared at Luna with intense fascination. Mum looked at Luna like she wasn’t sure if Luna herself was actually a swarm of bats in a dress, before pushing forward with her day. “Right. We best go to Gringotts first, then”
“Thank you, poppet,” Her dad called back. She could here the repetitive click-clack of her dad’s magical type-writer. He must be writing a new article.
“Shit. Nothing else.” The passageway they had come in through was already swarmed by students. “Fuck.” Harry yelled passionately. Neville almost scolded him because of the first-year present, but quickly squashed that impulse. “Come on.” Harry said, tugging Neville’s hand roughly.
“Because we were fifteen once.” Sirius pointed out, looking slightly green around the gills. He tucked a comforting arm around his husband.
“Hey, Lu?” Harry says quietly one evening, plopping down the book he was half-heartedly pouring over in a dramatic cloud of dust. It had just been Luna and Harry available tonight, as both Ginny and Ron had decided to watch the Ravenclaw Quidditch practices and Hermione and Draco were writing their arithmancy essays together across the room.
“I knew I shouldn’t have told you my full name” Harry said rolling his eyes “You just use it to shame me”
“Sure” Harry answered ambivalently “She mainly just likes to inform me of the quality of the rats. It’s not like we can talk about the weather”
Neville was stoic, his initial tears replaced with a strength Ron had not expected. Ron should have known. Neville was a Gryffindor. He was a stronger person than any of them knew. Sirius and Remus had stepped up immediately to take him in and so he would be going home with Harry. Ron wondered what the mood of Grimmauld place would be like that summer. He wondered if his mum would even let him go over to see them, or if she would keep them all barricaded in fear.
“I didn’t have anywhere to go.” Harry said simply, in that way he had of saying entirely tragic things in a casual way. “You and ‘Mione were always good to me like that.”
Harry and Neville exchanged amused glances. All the adults had become more frantically protective as the summer wore on and more reports of unexplained muggle attacks had surfaced.
“You are so goddamn strange” She told him. They stared at each other, expressionless, for a few moments. The corners of Harry’s mouth twitched up. She let out a snort which she tried uselessly to hide behind her hand. Then they were both laughing loudly, heads buried in there hands.
Ron and Ginny, who had grown up in a house that defied gravity and also planning laws, just rolled their eyes, grabbing an elbow each to pull her along with them.
Harry was silent, too. Over the silenced was superimposed the crunch of chicken bones. “I don’t know” Harry said softly, sounding sad “I wish I could set her free, but…”
“I thought I would be alone while down here,” He said, curling his lips. Before the bored looking goblin could respond he cut in, “I pay you enough, don’t I? How can I expect my family heirlooms to be safe if just anybody can run around these floors while I’m here? I pay for this vault for the added privacy and security it provides me. Am I wasting that money?”
Luna had her hands pressed to the glass of the window. Ginny could just hear all the things her mother would say about smudges. Her nose was so close that it too almost pressed against the glass pane. Luna’s expression was thoughtful. “Look” She said, and tugged Ginny closer too.
“You’re all coming back to mine, anyway. I got sent as the pick-up party,” Sirius said. Neville noticed he looked tense.
Draco isn’t a very nice person, Luna thinks. He’s just far enough from sarcastic so as to come up snide. He’ll make biting remarks regardless of whether you be friend or foe and he’ll only ever consider employing kindness when telling the blunt truth if he thinks it will get him somewhere. He isn’t nice. But nice isn’t everything. Nice isn’t always anything at all. Nice is a veneer; a well-practised mirage. The glaze over a misshapen pastry. Nice is all well and FINE, for certain. But Draco isn’t nice. He’s good. Luna thinks Sondheim had it right with that distinction.
Ron gingerly held the goblins long fingers up to the vault door. They each waited with baited breath, before sighing with relief when the vault door grew gold for a moment, and then disappeared. Just as it had for the Longbottom vault.
Most of Hermione’s lists, however, didn’t actually let Ginny glean anything. They were written in odd codes and shorthand’s that obviously meant something to Hermione but were gibberish to Ginny. Plus, some of it was just plainly baffling.
Harry, strangely, seemed oddly Happy about the results of the house cup “Good for them” He said, smiling kindly.
It was May when everything finally came to a head. All through the whispered attacks and rising tensions, You-Know-Who had remained unseen and largely un-known.
The snake was beautiful, in that biblical awe some way. It’s scales shone emerald and topaz, it’s eyes were golden. Neville was
But Ginny and Percy shared the birthday month of August. This meant that their birthdays were usually accompanied by water fights and bare chests. Ginny loved this. Percy would sit in front of his cake, usually in the shape of something academically related, and pout before he reluctantly joined in. On his birthday, the twins always seemed to sign an unspoken truce, and the three would gang up as one team and bombard the others with water balloons. It was the only time during the year that Ginny saw Percy smile freely, without any of his usual reserve.
Harry finally stopped in front of a vault door not unlike Neville’s grandmas. “Okay, Ron. It needs his fingerprints."
Harry jerked suddenly, then stood still. His mouth opened and closed like he wanted to say something. His whole body was frozen, desperate for motion with no where to go. Suddenly, he turned. Ripping the door open, he stormed out of the room without a word.
A stack of books with limbs walked through the doorway, spelling its way clear. The stack was dumped unceremoniously on the desk to reveal a familiar face. Their group gaped at the young women. The rest of the class gaped at the teetering stack of books which, against all odds, was remaining upwards.
Mainly it had devolved into watching Ginny and Pansy Parkinson snipe at each other over the fashion section. Ron estimated a full screaming match might evolve over the next few minutes. Luna was serenely enchanting the printing press in the corner, oblivious.
“Yes, I didn’t think it was important. Now, Malfoy, are you sitting down or not?” Harry said, cutting off an increasingly baffled Malfoy once again. Harry cast a distasteful look at Malfoy’s two friends, “Sorry I don’t think there’s room for all of you.”
But it was staying put where the cauldron had been. It danced and surged, hooves seemed to stretch from the flames, galloping on the damp air, racing to get away but instead they were sucked back in. As if the flames were behind a whirlwind. The fames would reach up into the air, then surge back down.
In fact he was mainly focusing on the realisation that in asking Hermione to the ball he had failed to mention that he meant as just friends. had Hermione known what he meant? She had said yes anyway. She must know. He had a horribly unnerving thought; that perhaps if it wasn’t as strictly friends, he might not really mind.
If Ginny wanted to beat her brothers in a race, she had to expend twice the energy that they did. If she wanted to join in any of the games they played, then she’d have to endure the same exact lecture; Ginny, you’re
She looked at the shoebox, which was still valiantly trying to rock its way over the side of the table. “Is that really a dark wizard masquerading as Ron’s pet rat?”
The evening of her birthday was celebrated quietly. The Weasley’s always celebrated birthday’s in the same way; mismatched tables lined up in the yard, a magically extended gingham table cloth, mountains of food and a cake- specialised to each child. Never two the same, as if Molly had made herself a promise. All of the Weasley children had birthdays that fell in warmer months, apart from the two eldest who’s birthdays where only two weeks apart in the last two months of the year. On Bill and Charlie’s birthdays the whole family would eat outside, equipped with Molly-made hats and scarves, sheltered under a canopy of warming spells.
Harry looked uncomfortable, “I was given a choice. I thought I was choosing to go back to my own time, but instead I came here. Back to first year, and you lot.”
Upstairs it was barely lunchtime, and people were trading information about the coup like any other gossip, hands wringing with the unknowing. It had been only a few hours since they had heard the news themselves. Fleur still sat in her office, desperately awaiting another Patronus. The first wave of soft heat was only now drifting up through the stone floors. People were wondering why the weather had picked such horrible day to be so lovely and warm. They rolled their eyes, blamed it on the baffling British weather.
The only birthday dinner Luna hadn’t come to had been her ninth, which had only been a few days after Luna’s mum had died. Ginny didn’t have a birthday dinner that week at all, but just sat with Luna in her sun-yellow circular bedroom as she cried.
Sirius bent down onto his knees so that he was Harry’s height “Harry” He said nervously “I know you live with your aunt, but..” He bit his lip “We’d like you to come stay with us over the summer”
Harry shook his head “We never talked about it, I’m not sure. They gave me a joint Christmas gift once, though, before Sirius—” A dark cloud came over Harry’s face, “Before he passed.” Harry shrugged. “Remus married someone else actually. Had a baby.”
Ginny leaned down. Her and Luna were sat on the bench above them, with Dean and Seamus rounding out their little group. Fred, George and Lee were at the front of the stands waving about percussion rattles and riling up bets off students and teachers alike.
Ginny clapped happily. She walked towards the window and looked out. It was true that Hermione and Harry were gone, but she could still see tendrils of smoke rising from the copse of trees.
An empty room. Had they even been in here? Or was this just an old storage room, locked in past times and forgotten?
Ron hadn’t known that. The reminder of yet another thing Harry hadn’t thought it important to tell Ron twisted the knife in even further.
Neville was bumbling, he knew this. He had been a chubby kid, which meant he went overlooked and was teased when he wasn’t and generally disparaged. He was anxious, awkward, ungainly.
And final, with a curdling scream, the door snapped into place, the shifting stone snakes curling their way back into place. Harry and Neville stood in place, panting, hands still pressed against the door as if the fire might burst through at any moment.
Harry was quick, moving into the vault and picking up the small yellow cup from a high shelf at the back of the room.
Beside the frozen lake there were several pairs of pink ice-skates. “I just thought” Ginny explained “If we had to have such a frozen valentines day, then we might as well have some fun yeah? I got Professor McGonagall to check the safety and everything and she said the ice was thick enough, so”
Then she ran giggling towards the skates, shouting out a challenge that Ginny couldn’t beat her in a race. It was a wonderful afternoon.
Neville was desperate. He didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know how to stop Harry. “You could hurt people. There’s an entire castle of people upstairs.”
if you've got time i'd love it if you checked out my new one-shot "The Spider, the Snake, The scared". it's about Regulus if that's your jam.
Ron felt a surge of discomfort. There wasn’t anything special about him, he knew. Harry Potter of all people shouldn’t be singing his praise. But he couldn’t help basking in the praise slightly, even though he knew it wasn’t deserved.
Harry continued to look at the notebooks. After a few minutes, in which he finally managed to notice the ketchup and wipe it off and Ron actually managed to spill what seemed like half a bottle of the stuff down his white shirt, he cautiously spoke. “Would it be okay if I had one of those? Obviously, I’d pay you back ‘Mione.” He hurriedly added. “It’s okay to say no.”
Hermione grunted as Harry shifted her feet up and then back down onto his lap. Ron did the same with her head. Hermione put up with this position for exactly one second before swivelling up and sitting between them.
Harry passed the letter to Hermione, who skimmed it with a chuckle and passed it to Ron. He too skimmed over Sirius’ general updates and mother henning of Harry, then laughed out loud when he read Sirius’ description of his 34
The dynamics of Hogwarts was changing and changing fast. The Oracle was spitting out depressing articles about attacks ad safety measures alongside its usual light-hearted columns and think-pieces. People clustered together now, looking at outsiders with wariness and distrust. At DA meetings people pestered Harry with questions about the ‘Situation Outside’ as it had begun to be referred to. Harry seemed more and more flustered and hurt every time someone asked him if everything would be okay.
On the train back the four of them happily squashed into a carriage at the back of the train. A lot had changed in a year. Ron was now rat-less and relaxed in himself. Draco’s hair had thankfully been released from its gel prison (a Ron suggestion) and he now had actual friends instead of just people who followed him around. Harry was visibly lighter this train ride then he had ever been before. He would be spending the summer with a real family, free to see his friends at any time, and with someone who finally knew his secret. All three boys grinned the whole way home.
“Who’s Bellatrix Lestrange? I recognise the name.” Ron questioned, the name ringing a bell. For some reason Neville shot into his mind but he couldn’t say why.
. Neville assumed Ron must have drawn it, then. He turned the paper over. On the back was a list of names, a long slash of black ink drawn through them all. At the bottom Hermione had written ‘
“And I said yes, but only if it was three more millennia’s” Sirius answered, and opened the ring box with a deep click “Well Remus Lupin, its been a decade and a half but would you still want to spent the next three millennia’s with me?”
“Wait. You mean that cauldron” Hermione said, sounding exasperated “That one, right there, sticking out from under Ginny’s bed
She also spent a few frantic minutes inspecting all of her children, which had naturally come to include Ron and Hermione, for injuries. As if perhaps one of them was casually hiding a lost limb from her.
Harry had a skip in his step. Hermione had noticed that the boy, despite his exuberance and joy in seemingly all mundane aspects of Hogwarts life, seemed often weighed down by something. It must have been the knowledge of the murderer he kept under his bed. Alleged murderer, anyway. Hermione and Harry had been assured by an embarrassed ministry official that there would be an extensive- and he’d emphasised
Ginny did, avoiding her mothers’ judging eyes and placing the half empty jam jar on the kitchen table before running up to her bedroom and promptly screaming into her pillow for three hours.
Neville like Tonks. She’d been a very helpful professor, and less intimidating than Remus had been. Neville wasn’t sure why shabby Professor Lupin had intimidated him, and he was certain Harry would tease him mercilessly if he knew, but he had. Perhaps it was his self-assuredness.
“You orchestrated this.” Neville said, laughing and nudging Ginny in the side. He, Ginny and Luna were all squashed together on one sofa, with Ron and Hermione in another and Draco and Harry each curled up in separate armchairs.
When Neville stopped speaking, no one spoke. Mulling gently over what they had heard. It was a beautiful sentiment, but it wasn’t only that.
Voldemort was back. But you would hardly be able to tell from the crowd of happy weddinggoers, orbiting merrily the happy couple in the centre who swayed with each other, eyes never straying.
“It’s your lucky day” Harry teased, letting Hermione gain back her balance by leaning on his shoulder “Little Hangleton it is. Come on”
Great. Harry had attacked a high-up ministry officials house elf. Ron’s life shifted abruptly to include visits to Harry in Azkaban on weekends.
“You-know-who is dead” Ginny said, jumping despite herself at Harry’s casual use of the name of a man who had died when she was hardly a few months old.
Except the twins. The twins were apparating back and forth across the room with vigour. Neville could see Hermione’s jaw already beginning to twitch.
He blinks at her slowly, looking for all the world as if he’s talking to a rabid griffin instead of a twelve-year-old girl. “Erm” He starts, and Luna’s noticed that Draco is a person that only ever seems eloquent in situations he feels in control of. Otherwise he’s a stumbling mess. She sort of prefers it. She wishes she had a pair of her spectre-specs so that she could check him for wrackspurts.
“Yes, but we were enemies then.” Harry pointed out, voice making it clear that this was something Ron should already know.
“But I made sure it went right this time, Luna” He’d told her forlornly, holding his palm out flat so that Thomas the Thestral could chomp at a chunk of steak. “If this happens again…” He’d started, and then trailed off.
Tonks’ lessons were always interesting. Either because she’s actually a pretty fun teacher or because she was a terrible adult.
“Here,” Hermione said, handing Ron a lumpy and un-symmetrical knitted scarf, “Harry told me to take up knitting.”
“Harry’s got you onto that muggle rubbish too, eh? Knew he’d cause an epidemic one day” He jokes. Sounding much surer of himself.
Neville had just been pushed into the hallway when Sirius spoke. “Harry’s right, Albus,” His voice was chilly, “And I can’t believe this whole endeavour was over a prophecy saying my godson has to die.”
It was an idyllic week, even if Neville spent half of it accidentally feeling like a burden. There was only so many times he could walk into a room containing Hermione, Ron and Harry and have them jump feet apart from each other without feeling like the cause.
“Ever the charmer, Ronald.” Draco teased. He’d snuck his way into Gryffindor tower an hour earlier and had spent the last forty minutes roundly beating Harry at Chess on Harry’s bed. Harry looked flushed though Ron didn’t have any notion as to why.
But she cut herself off suddenly, almost as soon as Harry touched his proffered paper. In fact, everyone in the hall holding a newspaper suddenly froze, the lack of noise in the hall deafening. Neville, who hadn’t touched the paper placed in front of him yet, stared around in shock.
“I need your help” He said, dropping down onto the ground next to her and leaning back against the log. Luna had been sitting near Hagrid’s hut, soaking up the last rays of September sun. “Seriously. I have an ethical conundrum”
She smiled at them when they all awkwardly filed in “Oh, hello dears,” She said, standing up and bustling past the now silent room.
Ron gave her a sideways look of disbelief “What other reason would you be following him for? Are you, like, planning to steal his life force in a dark ritual?”
“Here?!” Ron exclaimed, throwing his hands in the air. “Harry you’ve gone absolutely barmy, you have.”
The weather improved over the next few days of Harry’s stay. The house was constantly bustling with activity normally, but with Harry there it seemed to double as everyone found new and improved ways to entertain him or things to show him. Ginny got the feeling that Harry would have been happy to watch paint dry with them.
Draco sighed dramatically and crossed his legs primly. He leaned forward and adopted a manner one could only describe as ‘child psychologist’. “Ronald. Dearest friend. I am not having my fourth year ruined by your snit.” He screwed up his face, “Furthermore, I am not having my
One day I find the end of the cavernous book shelves and I feel my own heart stop in my chest. I stopped reading the lives miles ago- just ran and ran and ran and tried to find a boy who God damn lived. But I am at my end now.
After they’d both sobered, and Hermione had given Harry a much needed hug, Harry looked at her wonderingly.
You couldn’t be a useless, bumbling fool if somebody wanted to be your friend. That had to make you worth something.
Harry looked at her, face blank. Then he gave her a small smile, lacking any real joy. “Thanks, Luna” He gave her a sideways hug “I’ll let you go back to your sun-nap now”
Harry’s red and gold patterned tie was slung haphazardly around his neck. He rolled his eyes. “Gotta go, Draco. The parental units are being demanding. Almost as if this is a special day or something?”
How were you meant to feel when all of your wishes came true? However, it was, Neville had imagined it would feel better than like his stomach had dropped into his feet.
“Why would we be governmentally trained spies if the government is who we’re spying on?” Hermione said, looking at her boyfriend with judgement, Ron just shrugged, going back to throwing Harry’s stuffed quaffel cushion into the air.
“Fudge has given another interview about what a terrible job he thinks Minister Bones is doing” Hermione said in disgust, tossing the offending Prophet onto the breakfast table. Hedwig jumps back and glares at her reproachfully “As if she isn’t the most effective Minister we’ve had in the last five terms”
He frowned, walking into the room a few steps. There was only one window, a long narrow one at the very top of the far wall. Hardly any light streamed in. He casted a lumos. Then he trailed the light of his wand slowly about the room.
Sirius Black wasn’t as scary as he had been made out to be. He was half a head shorter than Professor Lupin, but much broader across the shoulders and chest. His curly black hair was cut neatly to his shoulders, and well kept. He was clean shaven and fresh faced- a million miles from the scraggly and vicious man he had been presented as. His eyes sparkled with joy and his genuine smile carried unbridled mirth in its corners.
“Those are proper galleons as well.” Harry said, proudly ignoring his two male best friends. “Not that fake Leprechaun shite.”
“No one ever treats me normal. They act like at any moment I’m liable to break something, or explode, or say something dumb,” Neville shrugged, “You don’t.”
Ron had known Tonks for years. Mainly as the vibrant shadow that hovered behind Charlie in summers and tripped over mum’s shoes stand constantly. He remembered vividly the time mum had tried to teach Tonks how to knit. To say the results had been disastrous would be an understatement. Charlie had nearly died laughing.
Hermione seemed to notice that he wasn't telling them the whole truth, but surprisingly enough she didn't push. She only reminded him that she and Ron would always be there for him and that he should listen to the healers.
“Sorry, I can’t. You’ve been in love with the messy haired git for ages. I really don’t understand the appeal, but whatever. The thing is, I just can’t stand your pining any longer.”
I've also planned the last few chapters. There will be 22 total and probably an epilogue. So just a few more to go...
Harry didn't want to see a healer. Anything but that. But Hermione kept insisting, telling him over and over again that she only meant well and that she was concerned for him. And when that didn't work, she pulled her trump card.
It cost Draco a lot to say the name aloud, but he was determined to rid himself of that fear. It was only a name after all. If Harry could say it, so could he.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he heard Harry call out from somewhere to his right. “I’ve got it!”
Hermione went to bed as well and Ron returned to the kitchen to finish his scones. Sirius wandered off towards the study. Harry debated about following him, but then took a seat next to Draco on the couch again, wanting to talk to the blond first.
Rita Skeeter was no surprise and neither was the notebook in her hands, even if seeing it made his blood boil. Madame Maxime had come to the funeral as well. Even the merpeople looked on from the black lake and a herd of centaurs stood at the edge of the forbidden forest.
“Yeah. She also said that she told Voldemort about the diadem. And that he did something evil with it.”
Potter was very quiet the next morning. He kept glancing at Draco as if waiting for the Slytherin to make fun of him. When Draco didn't mention last night, he finally relaxed and they fell back into their usual routine.
“I know, Greg.” Draco said with a sigh. “Just... try to stay out of trouble as much as you can, okay? I think that's the only thing you can do.”
"Yeah, sort of. It's a long story and I don't have much time to explain. But.. I need to ask a favour from the Order."
He seemed reluctant to go and Draco found himself speaking up without really thinking it through. “Do you want to come back to Andromeda's with me? It's almost time for tea.”
He was eight and trying not to cry, while aunt Petunia berated him for burning the eggs and told him that he wouldn't get any food that day.
He pulled Harry out of the cell and dragged him along a dark, winding corridor, passing even more empty cells. In the distance he could hear faint yells and running footsteps. Malfoy cursed and broke into a run, still dragging a staggering Harry with him.
“Maybe.” Harry agreed thoughtfully. “Dumbledore thinks the was obsessed with Hogwarts and its founders.” he added with a shrug. “What was really creepy about those memories was how he looked. I mean, it was nothing compared to what he looks like now. He was still Tom Riddle, still looked human and all. But... I don't know. I guess I just thought he'd only changed into … well, that when they resurrected him. But he had already changed a bit back then. And it seemed to get worse.”
"So… someone sent you that book. You and Malfoy. Who the hell would want to bind you to Malfoy?" the red-head wondered.
"When he was a student here, he asked Slughorn about something called a Horcrux. Dumbledore made me view Slughorn's memory, but he said it had been tampered with. He wants me to get the real memory from Slughorn." he let the others know.
“She’s the Ravenclaw ghost. And also Rowena Ravenclaw’s daughter.” Harry explained. “It was Luna’s idea. Because it’s said that no-one in living memory has seen it.”
Draco swallowed hard. Crabbe had been an idiot and a bully. And unlike Goyle he’d actually enjoyed hurting people. But he’d known the other boy since they were kids. No matter what he’d done, he didn’t deserve to die like this. Even if he’d been the one to cast the spell in the first place.
“Moony and I are going to stay for a while.” the animagus promised. “I guess there'll be things to discuss, once the Ministry officials have left. We'll be in the hospital wing. Come and get me if you need anything, okay?”
“Good idea. Get them.” Sirius ordered. He knew that his boyfriend didn't do well on a broom, but it was their best bet.
This time the blond did roll his eyes. “As long as you don't expect me to gossip about boys and fashion with you...”
They passed through the archway into Diagon Alley and stopped for a moment. It looked different than it had on Harry's last visit. Even more shops were boarded-up now. New ones, dedicated to the dark arts, had opened in their stead. Wherever he looked he saw his own face printed on posters, declaring him Undesirable number one. It was disconcerting.
After a while the blond pulled back, causing Harry to whimper. For the first time that night Malfoy's confidence seemed to waver. He looked almost shy, even as his hand trailed lower, lightly cupping Harry's buttock.
Draco was dying to ask his aunt what exactly had happened. But he didn’t want to leave Harry alone right now. So he tamped down his curiosity and declared that he was tired and would be heading to bed as well.
“No buts you idiot Gryffindor! Will you listen to common sense at least this once?” Draco said harshly. “Strength in numbers. You can't do this alone. And you don't have to. This is our choice, like Ron said. And we chose to come with you, wherever you'll go.”
"What am I supposed to do? On one hand I feel like I owe it to them to show up. On the other hand it feels like I'd be intruding now. Like I don't really belong there. I .. I haven't really been in touch with any of them in the last couple of months. I didn't even answer the letter Mrs. Weasley sent me at the start of term. And... things with me and Ginny ended pretty badly."
“And you were a big help as well, Dobby.” Harry assured. “How did you even know we needed your help? And where you’d find us?”
The fight ended as quickly as it had begun. Harry rolled over onto his back, wheezing because the blond had landed a nasty punch in his side. Next to him, Draco rolled onto his back as well, panting and nursing a split lip and a bleeding nose.
The younger boy shook his head. He fumbled around on the bedside table until he found his glasses and put them on. Draco had sat up now. Harry noticed that he was wearing one of his old shirts. And suddenly it all came back to him. The cave, the fake Horcurx … and Dumbledore.
Which was easier said than done. Time seemed to drag on endlessly. Draco and Harry tried to occupy themselves with chess and other things, but both couldn’t help glancing at the window every couple of minutes. Sirius alternated between pacing through the house and joining them in their room to complain about being left behind.
A trap from which Draco Malfoy of all people had saved him. Harry glanced over to where the blond was lying. He could just make out his outline in the little light that filtered in through the window, but he was sure that Malfoy wasn't sleeping either.
The others had welcomed her into the group without question, once she'd apologized for her earlier stupidity. Neville and Millicent seemed joined at the hip. It warmed Harry's heart to see their happiness. At least something good had come of that horrible night. Ron and Hermione however kept dancing around each other.
Draco looked at him in surprise, but Travers came over, wondering aloud where he might have gotten a new wand made. Not knowing what else to do, Harry shot another Imperius at Travers, who fell silent and only smiled stupidly.
It was still strange to see the younger boy smiling at him, despite their interactions over the past two weeks.
“It could be. I mean, I know that Mione’s convinced it’s all a load of crap. But it’s not impossible, is it? There are stories about famous wands. And your cloak is pretty special.”
“Kreacher.” Sirius cut in. They all swivelled around to stare at him. Draco waited anxiously what his cousin had to say. It wouldn’t do to aggravate Kreacher now. Not when he’d just agreed to help them. And now that he’d heard his tale, he felt that the elf couldn’t be held fully responsible for the stuff he kept muttering. An experience like that could drive anyone insane.
He would rather keep his feelings hidden forever, if it meant that he could keep Harry in his life. As long as they were friends he at least had some part of the Gryffindor. That was better than nothing. He would be happy with that.
“Well, a Horcrux is nearly impossible to destroy.” Dumbledore started. “One of the few things that can be used is Basilisk venom.”
They skidded around another corner and as if on cue nearly ran right into Ron and Hermione, both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects.
Strangely enough, watching Draco Malfoy turned out to be a good way to relax. He was still convinced that the blond was a Death Eater, even if no-one (save maybe Sirius) wanted to believe him. So he had decided to follow the blond Slytherin and spy on him to find out what he was up to. People would have to believe him once he'd found proof. Right?
When Draco shook his head, he explained what he knew about them, starting with the diary in second year and ending with Dumbledore leaving it up to him to destroy them.
Despite his blotched Potion, Harry tried his luck and went up to ask Slughorn about that memory after class had been dismissed. But unfortunately the Potions master wasn't fond enough of Harry to freely hand it over. He got rather cold and told Harry only what he'd already witnessed in the false memory, before sending him on his way.
“Exactly. And now try to imagine that Draco was about to do something dangerous. Like going to confront his father. How would that make you feel?”
Once again thanks to everyone for all the lovely comments. I only managed a short update this time, but I didn't want to keep you waiting any longer.
Draco burst into the common room, startling Millicent, who was in the middle of tutoring one of the younger Slytherins.
Turning the corner they spied two tall figures up ahead. Draco's hand shot up, a curse already on his lips, when he recognized them.
Sorry that I kept you waiting. To make up for it, the new chapter is a bit longer. And a lot happens. Maybe too much? At first I thought about splitting it, but then decided against it. Sooo... only one more chapter to go.
Draco wordlessly handed him the letter and waited for the inevitable explosion. He didn’t have to wait long.
“Amycus sister Alecto is just as bad. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them. I noticed that when you did it, Harry. So we kept going. Everyone in the DA. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls and stuff. But it got more difficult as time went on. We lost Luna at Christmas and Ginny never came back after Easter. The three of us were sort of the leaders...”
Harry did just that, slipping on his winter coat, scarf and hat again. When he returned to the living room, Parkinson stepped into his path with a determined look.
“Let me get this straight: You've been trying out handwritten spells, without knowing what they did?” Draco asked sharply.
They joined the queue of students heading down to the village. Since it was a regular Hogsmeade weekend there were quite a lot of people, though Draco suspected that the dark clouds obscuring the sky prevented at least some of the older years from going. The walk was pleasant enough, despite the chilly wind and seemed shorter than he remembered.
Harry could have done without all these boring, historic facts. But he knew how Hermione got when she was researching something, so he nodded along and forced himself to smile. "Did you find out anything else?" Anything useful, he added mentally.
Remus was currently reorganizing the Black library and somehow managed to rope Harry into helping him. Since no-one asked Draco to help too, he went up to his room to read. He wasn't going to offer his help carrying books around if he didn't have to. And he also knew that Harry would come and get him when he got bored.
Draco’s cheeks took on a rosy hue as well. But he didn't break eye-contact. “I guess I might let you.”
“I'm sorry. He's a fool.” Harry finally whispered and she giggled, though it sounded more like a sob.
It wasn't a conscious reaction. Harry was almost surprised himself when his fist connected with Draco's jaw. Draco's eyes darkened in anger and before he really knew what was happening, they were rolling around on the floor, kicking and punching each other.
Harry suspected that there was some truth in the red-head's words. Draco's snark was starting to rub off on him. Not that he'd ever admit that out loud.
Harry had one private lesson with Dumbledore, where he learned more about Voldemort's family. He met up with Draco, Ron, Hermione, Millicent and Blaise the next day to tell them what the headmaster had shown him in his pensieve and to discuss what it meant. They all agreed that it was rather interesting that Voldemort was actually a half-blood, but no-one felt that this knowledge would help Harry defeat him.
Urquhart had booked the pitch on Saturday, right after the Gryffindors, so Draco and Millicent went down after breakfast to watch the Gryffindor try-outs first. It soon became apparent that a lot of people had only shown up because Harry was captain. There were an awful lot of giggling girls, people from other houses and even some who had shown up without brooms.
Harry’s eyes were drawn to her left cheek automatically. There was a line of scars from her ear almost down to her chin. A leftover from Greyback attacking her. And not the only one. She’d gotten off lightly, in comparison to others. She was lucky to still be alive. And yet he could understand her. To some extent.
“I know you don’t have a very high opinion of me. After that whole fiasco with Ron in sixth year…” she continued. “I can’t really blame you. Looking back I’m pretty embarrassed myself. But I can assure you that I’ve grown up since then. And it won’t hurt you to spend time with someone besides Draco every once in a while.”
Bogrod pulled out a metal instrument and started making horrible noise with it. The dragon recoiled.
“A bit.” Remus had to admit. “The problem is that this ritual was meant for when the person containing the horcrux is close to death. Extracting the horcrux weakens the person’s own soul and magical core, resulting in their death when they are already weak.”
“It's okay. Really. We were never all that close to begin with. At least Daphne and I weren't. And I don't mind being on my own. It's not like I ever had a lot of friends.”
In turn Draco had told him about growing up at the manor and trying to fulfil his father's high expectations, about lazy days spent with his mother in her garden, when Lucius was away doing business and even about his hurt pride when Harry had refused his hand in first year.
They advanced slowly, but the huge beast seemed to be trembling in fear. Harry could see scars made by vicious slashes across his face.
“At first I wasn't sure what to do with the two of you.” McGonagall admitted. “But I saw the pictures in the Prophet and I want to believe that you've outgrown your childish rivalry. Don't prove me wrong.”
They had all agreed not to wear the locket for a while. Things were bad enough without the added stress of the horcrux around their necks. They now stored it on the desk in the study, where Remus or Hermione could keep an eye on it at all times and grab it quickly, should the need arise.
