“I do love you, Draco, I love you so, so much-”
“I wandered into the Plot Knot, the bookshop he works at.”
Harry wilted and nodded. She was right. He was poisonous to Draco, and he had no right barging back into his life when he had made that monstrous a mistake.
Potter watched him, and Draco watched as his smile grew larger.
“And you’re an absolute liar.”
Insecurity flared through him like a flame. Of course he was right. That was all Harry saw him as. But when he saw Harry’s eyes widen to the size of dinner plates, and step closer to Draco as though he had broken something precious, he wasn’t so sure.
“We aren’t together.”
“That wasn’t funny. I . . . I’m not going to lie to you and pretend like I know what I’m doing. Ginny was my only real relationship before you. But what I can tell you is that I’d give it my best each and every day. I’ll make mistakes. Some days I won’t be so great. Some days you won’t be so great. But what I can promise is that I will always,
Potter frowned. “So all that stuff I’ve said to you, that was just a joke to you?”
When the doctors had gotten Draco stable, they called Harry back.
“But you don’t want him, either,” said Blaise carefully. “Right?”
“I should have tried harder to reach you. I gave up too fast.” She sounded absolutely decimated.
Draco swallowed thickly. “He, erm, well, he . . .”
“That’s not your choice to make,” said Draco. “Go.”
Once Harry had written down the hospital’s address and handed the paper back to Narcissa, she began walking out of the sitting room, gesturing for Harry to follow her.
Narcissa chuckled mirthfully. “I see you have aged well since the war.”
“Looking dashing as ever, Potter,” Draco teased with a smirk to match.
It was Parkinson.
Draco drew in air, and as he released his breath and relaxed, he sank deeper. His hole began stretching to accommodate the girth, and he had never felt so
Draco nodded. “Of course I know that now. It was a long time ago. I shouldn’t still be affected by it.”
Instead of shooing the reporters away or denying the claims like Draco expected him to, Harry did something else.
“What did they say to you?” asked Hermione.
Not likely.
He was going to head to bed, utterly exhausted, but then a noise thwarted his plan.
He wondered if Mother would even be devastated. She had stopped contacting him a while ago after a particularly prickly visit at the manor, though he supposed that was mostly his fault.
“Of course it matters,” Harry said softly. “It’s you.”
No answer.
“Not giving it to you,” she said. “I’m only trying to offer you support in the form of saying your name in a tone that may be
And Harry kissed him. Draco’s mouth moved hungrily against his, and Harry wasted no time in wrapping an arm around his lithe waist, pulling him impossibly closer until their chests were flush and all Draco could feel was
Draco loved him. Draco
these past few weeks. Asking me to spend the night, saying you love me while we fuck and then kicking me out, then turning around and saying I
“I-I’m fine,” said Draco, but his voice sounded unsteady to his own ears. “Just get on with it, Harry.”
“You heard me. Get out of my flat.”
“Mmm, Draco, you’re gonna feel so nice around my cock, aren’t you?”
“That’s it? You’re sorry? Just slap an ‘I’m sorry’ over my open wound and hope that’ll patch everything over?”
“Well, you asked how they were doing, and that’s how they’re doing,” Potter responded innocently. “And I don’t think they’d mind. They know I’ve been coming to see you.”
“You just kissed me,” Draco breathed out, fingers thrumming with electricity. “You just kissed me.”
Harry wandered into the small, homey Apothecary shop that had recently opened. He’d been hearing all about it in the Daily Prophet, but the owner of the shop had decided to remain anonymous. He wondered why, and perhaps if the owner was working he’d be able to get to the bottom of it, of course if they weren’t too busy. Hermione’s morning sickness was still going strong, and he reckoned he’d be able to find something in there that could help her. Otherwise, he’d see about the shop on Diagon.
“Mhm,” Harry agreed as he let go of Draco to work on his own belt. Draco, meanwhile, was urging Harry’s shirt over his head. Harry lifted his hands to allow the garment to come off, then resumed undoing his belt so he could remove his trousers.
with the way things were, and you had to go and mess it up by telling him to come here on the worst possible night-”
Draco ended the firecall.
Harry wanted to rip his hair out.
“You know that it’s okay to be. Right, Malfoy?” Potter asked him, eyes never leaving his.
Draco looked back up at him. If he was going to have this conversation, he was going to be mature and do it eye to eye.
“Wait.”
“I’m not sure we do,” said Draco, hyper-conscious of Potter’s unmoving hand on his.
“If you’re here to remind me about the stipulations of our
It wasn’t Mother’s fault. She, like him, had been sucked into something much larger than herself, and had only acted out of fear and self-preservation.
“I’m so sorry,” Draco murmured into the crook of her neck. “I’m so sorry.”
Potter must have read something on his face, for he sat down across from Draco and rubbed his leg soothingly. “Hey, baby, what is it? Talk to me.”
“So do we.”
“What would you like to talk about, then?” Draco asked anxiously, mostly because Potter’s stunningly good looks were incredibly distracting and he was having a hard enough time focusing without his heart threatening to jump out of his chest.
“You’re forgetting I know you. I can tell when you aren’t okay.”
Pansy’s eyes widened comically large, and she gasped audibly. “He
I just wanted to say again thank you for all the wonderful feedback you guys have left me on this story so far. It means everything :)
Draco heard the loud pop of apparition, and a long short minutes later there was a knock on his door.
“We’re not going to have sex right now,” Harry said quietly, and that unleashed something feral in Draco. He pulled away from Harry with a frustrated snarl, reaching down and picking up his shirt, tossing it over his shoulders and fitting his arms through the sleeves.
“You work tomorrow.”
Draco hung his head and obeyed.
“Yes, Potter?”
Fuck, Harry calling him
Death Eater, as his Mind Healer was slowly but surely conditioning to switch to- and live happily ever after.
“Not super recently,” Draco admitted.
“I was doing absolutely
“No, Ginny.
Annie was being so kind. Draco took pity on the poor woman. “Alright.”
When Narcissa Malfoy emerged into view, her soft, feminine features morphed into ice.
“Make yourself comfortable,” he said uselessly. “Is . . . everything alright?”
Which is why when he heard knocking on his door, he growled and cursed himself for giving Harry his home address.
Somehow, he had an intuition that Potter was too good for something like that, that he would never do that to Draco. But it still didn’t stop the doubt from creeping in.
Draco let out an audible sigh as Potter murmured a spell and Draco felt a cooling sensation spread throughout the inside of his hole. Potter had cleansed him magically. He nearly whined it was so hot. His cock began to fill rapidly again. Draco sagged into the pillows, releasing a big breath as Potter murmured another spell, this one for lubrication.
Draco sighed, and paused for a moment. “No. I wasn’t,” he finally said.
“I think the better question is, Potter, what damage
“What are you waiting for?” Harry snapped, reeling him back to reality like a fishing pole. “Go.”
Potter fixed him with that
Gentle, tender thrusts at first to warm him up, just the way he liked. And then once Draco began to loosen around him, Harry picked up speed, and set a fast, brutal pace, fucking into him in earnest.
Too many. But none involved the Muggle world, so Draco merely shook his head and replied calmly, “No.”
“Do what?” Harry asked.
So they talked and ate, and Draco found that pleasant conversation with Potter was just as engaging as emotionally intense conversation, if not more so. By the time Potter paid their bill, Draco was so full and sated and pleased that he actually smiled, dopey as a child, as Potter thanked the waitress and told them their meal was exquisite.
And that was when Draco realized.
“Close,” Harry warned, cutting himself off with a grunt as he squeezed Draco’s hips in a bruising grip.
“That isn’t fair for our baby to have parents who are split apart,” said Harry. “I didn’t have any parents, and I’m not going to put my child through that.”
Draco exhaled shakily as he realized that even if Potter didn’t harbour any resentment toward him, the chances of him returning his affections were slim to none because Potter was
Draco nodded.
“Wonderful,” Draco spat.
Draco nearly dropped the ladle onto the floor.
was going to be the bane of Draco’s existence.
Greg gasped. Blaise’s hands flew to his mouth. Theo’s mouth dropped open.
A quick update for you guys, because you rock
“I didn’t mean it,” said Harry stoically, avoiding eye contact with Draco.
himself for not remembering before. For letting the kiss overpower him.
Harry was borderline begging. Draco was puzzled. His frazzled brain couldn’t keep up. Harry wanted him, then he didn’t, then he did, then he didn’t-
He knew that Potter would never see him as anything more than a friend, but there was something in his eye when he looked at Draco that was more ardent, and zealous. And it made Draco wonder.
“You conniving snake,” said Draco. “Why did you send him? I was doing fine before he told me he loved me.”
“This isn’t happening. Harry’s not having a baby with . . . With
“Wow,” was all Draco could say.
, since apparently I’m not marriage material, but Harry told me he doesn’t plan on marrying the Weasel.”
“You’re always twisting my words,” Draco said lowly. “Always turning the knife to point at yourself. Always have to be the
“Is that a problem?” Harry asked, confused.
Potter chuckled. “It’s not exactly my cup of tea, either. But . . . It felt wrong not to take it.”
She picked up her tea cup and took a light sip.
“Goyle?”
“Are you sure?” he asked, sounding breathless.
Parkinson smiled softly at him. “Really?”
Draco quickly wiped his eyes, though the action was basically moot, and unlocked the door.
Harry grinned. “Brilliant.”
“Would it matter if she had?”
“I’m fine, Pans. Just tired.”
“You like it when I take my time with you, even though you’d never admit it,” he said. “You love the slow stretch, the way I slowly take you apart with my fingers. It’s maddening for you.” He pushed one lubed finger into Draco’s twitching hole.
“We’ll give you plenty of food while you’re here, but the rest is up to you once you’re discharged,” said Annie. “Do you have any history with medication?” she asked.
“You want to marry my son?” Narcissa asked faintly.
“They’re saying they can’t talk to me in person, that this is the only avenue of communication they have,” said Harry. “I’ve never been so confused in my life.”
Potter could see it- he could see everything. But before he could respond, their food arrived.
“I thought you’d be teaching at some prestigious-”
“Wouldn’t be a problem?” a flabbergasted Ron echoed. “Harry, you’ve absolutely lost the plot.”
at him let alone- Eurgh!”
He didn’t have long to wait- the witch in question walked toward him, and she looked as graceful and elegant as ever. Her long, silvery hair was draped down her side in a braid, and when her eyes landed on Harry she smiled softly.
“I didn’t ask him to do that,” said Draco, standing over the table again.

I’m doing here? I work here.”
. “Perfect.”
I was to bear his Mark?”
“H-He rejected me, a-and-”
and at home that Draco wanted to cry. “I’m taking you to get hamburgers.”
Greg chuckled. “You’re always talking about him, he always manages to get a rise out of you, and you always go out of your way to get his attention. Some might even say you fancy him.”
“It seems as if a conversation between you two is long overdue. I’ll let Draco tell you,” was all she said, and Harry smiled at her, feeling a flutter of happiness inside his chest.
“Sometimes I have dizzy spells,” Draco said with a shrug. “Another side effect of extended use of
It happened one cool, starlit night where the hum of the crickets almost overpowered her screams.
“Don’t lash out at me because you’re angry with Harry,” Hermione growled. “I value my friendship with Harry, and I would have done him wrong by telling. And can you blame him for not wanting to come to you? Look at how you’re acting.”
“She told me,” said Draco.
Draco cut himself off with a strangled moan as ropes of searing hot come shot out of his cock, all over his tummy, thoroughly coating himself. He rode his orgasm out, twitching and crying out Harry’s name over and over again like a mantra, gasping for air and mouth parting open in a little o.
“Not with Death Eaters.”
A second finger joined the first. As Harry scissored and stretched him, Draco began fucking himself back on Harry’s fingers, just because he knew Harry hated it when he did that. Also because it felt insanely good.
And they were kissing again, giggling into each other’s mouths, and a thought struck Draco. A wonderfully crazy thought.
When they reached the hospital, Harry fought tooth and nail with the medics and the nurses to go back with Draco. But rules were rules, and he would have to wait.
“You like that,” Harry murmured, hands tickling his sides. Draco tangled a hand in his thick, black hair that was so much softer than it looked.
He was stalling. He knew it, but the news refused to release its grip on the tip of his tongue.
“I see,” said Draco harshly, feeling a stab of hurt swell in his chest. “You two have fun.”
“You’re not a Death Eater,” Harry said.
“Harry,” he pleaded, “touch me. Please.”
“That may be true, but you never know. They could be playing a trick on you,” said Hermione.
A streak of come leaked out of his hole, past Harry’s mouth, and dribbled down the side of his leg. Harry leaned down to lap it up, taking a moment to savor the flavor of his creamy, smooth skin.
“Harry!”
Draco was panting heavily, clawing Harry’s back and wrapping his legs around Harry’s waist, which Harry found so
“C’mere, baby,” Harry whispered, pulling him into another searing kiss that had his very head spinning. To his surprise, Draco was the one to pull back first, and he shimmied down Harry’s body, pressing kisses all around his crotch.
But why was Potter touching him? Surely he wasn’t
have a choice,” Hermione said. “Children grow up with separate parents all the time and turn out fine. It’s called shared custody. You and Ginny don’t have to have anything to do with each other, and can still raise your baby while being equally involved.”
Potter gasped, hands flying over his mouth. Eyes filled with anguish. Draco hated being the one to put it there.
“I’m just the ugly, sloppy seconds,” he continued, throat producing a choked sort of laugh. “Ginny is younger and hotter, right? Someone to stick your throbbing cock into because I’m not easy enough, right?”
Harry had done this to him. Harry had put him here. Because of Harry, he was trapped.
on the floor- Do not tell me there’s ‘nothing to worry about.’”
“Right,” said Draco, absolutely
“You think our time together is a waste?” asked Harry, and trust him to twist everything Draco says.
“Ginny!”
Draco hummed again, loudly and encouragingly, and Harry stopped fighting it. He spilled down Draco’s throat with a loud cry, orgasm so strong he saw white spots.
“Okay,” Draco said. “We can talk about something else.”
“I never saw the point,” said Draco, and instantly Harry was hit with a thousand feelings all at once.
When Draco needed air, he pulled back and panted for breath. Potter seemed just as affected, if his heaving chest was anything to go by.
“Alright,” Draco found himself saying, unbelieving of the fact that he’d actually just uttered the words. “I’ll write to them.”
Harry pulled him into a bone-crushing hug then, needing to feel his closeness and remind himself that this was
Harry’s eyebrows raised slightly, but otherwise he looked unaffected by the abrupt statement.
Harry felt a blush coat his neck, traveling rapidly up to his cheeks. “Just because I’m relaying the fact that he didn’t kill Fred doesn’t mean I’m in
“I’ve always admired your bravery,” Draco admitted bashfully, feeling his cheeks stain pink. “You wear your emotions on your sleeve, almost begging to be read. You’re an open book. You see the best in people, almost to a dangerous fault. You’re that
After that last thread between them had been snipped, Draco realized that he was completely and utterly alone. How pathetic he was to have found solace in Harry’s arms, as though they could provide him a home. Who was he kidding? He’d never find a home, because home was meant for good people, and he was not good.
“Since when do you care about my feelings?” Draco asked. “We established rules for a reason to prevent things from getting
This time, Draco was the one to pull back. “You can’t just forgive me that easily,” he said.
want him,” said Blaise.
Harry got to work on his own belt, unbuckling the strap and pulling down his trousers. Long, hairy, muscled legs came into view, legs Draco loved to straddle.
He slumped back against the bed, panting, as Draco withdrew his mouth from his cock with an obscene pop, wearing a devious smirk.
“Real mature, Draco. You two might just work out with that attitude.”
“It’s fine.” Draco stood up, glass tight in his hand. “I’m going to pour myself another. Would you like one?”
“Goodness gracious, Potter, I didn’t ask you to drip half of London’s rainfall all over my floor.”
Harry’s finger jabbed mercilessly against Draco’s prostate. He pulled it out, and quickly pushed back in with two.
Hermione looked down at her plate. Harry, on the other hand, felt a deep, burning blush coat his cheeks.
Harry asking him to stay over last time was strange, and it messed with him a little bit. Okay, maybe a lot. But then Draco remembered that Harry practically hated him. He was still a Death Eater, after all, who had fought alongside the monster who killed Harry’s parents. Harry would never see him differently.
Dinner, unlike at the Malfoy manor, was loud and boisterous and full of laughter and poking fun. Draco found himself nodding along to Arthur’s ramblings about Muggle items, finding himself rather interested in what the older man was saying. He found himself fascinated by Muggles and their innovative technology that seemed to come quite close to magic in certain regards, and realized how much he’d changed.
“What is it?” Draco asked softly, placing a hand on Potter’s bicep and rubbing up and down in what he hoped was a soothing manner.
Draco didn’t really want to die- did he? He wanted to apologize to Harry for everything he’d done wrong, and fix things. Right?
He looked back up at her, into those imploring eyes. “Yes.”
“You have,” Pansy agreed. “I won’t lie to you. But I forgive you, because you seem aware of it now.”
“And those machines that go fast on the roads. They scare me a lot, actually,” Draco admitted, flushing deeper. Here he was admitting to Harry Potter of all people that he found Muggle inventions interesting. What a strange day this was turning out to be.
“So why are you-”
Annie looked puzzled. Had Draco said something wrong? But before he could ask her, she fired off another question.
“Right!” Harry wanted to kick himself. “Yes, see I need something for Hermione’s morning sickness.”
than just one meal to get to know someone.”
“Just a shag.”
Draco’s words from last time echoed in his head.
“You’re sending all kinds of mixed signals, and I can’t figure out what you
As if on cue, Harry’s wrist tingled.
Then he’d used Draco as a means to cope.
Annie pursed her lips, scribbling away on that stupid notepad.
Harry was so
:(( It has to get worse before it gets better
He walked tentatively past the front gardens, adorned with flowers and well-trimmed shrubbery. When he knocked on the door, a house elf answered and offered to take his coat. Harry gratefully accepted, waiting for Narcissa in the . . . uniquely decorated drawing room.
“You have the right to feel whatever you want,” Draco said. “There are no rules.”
“Harry?” he asked, wincing at how delicate his voice sounded.
“Nothing’s wrong,
Potter pulled off him with a wet, obscene pop, looking up at him innocently.
“Really.”
Draco downed the rest of his drink in one go. Potter watched him with a questioning eyebrow.
“I know.”
Potter hummed again, hands tightening around his arse, and that did it for Draco. With a strangled cry he came down Potter’s throat as pleasure erupted in the pit of his stomach, momentarily wiping his vision.
“F-Fuck, Draco, if you don’t stop-”
Draco took a shuddering breath, shaking his head. “Harry, I-I’m sorry, t-this isn’t-”
Draco felt the pleasant atmosphere dissipate like a cloud over the sun. “Yes.”
here?” Draco couldn’t resist the urge to pick on him. It was too strong. “Still observant as ever, I see. What do you
“I’ve spilled all over this rug. Let me spell this clean before the stain sets. Excuse me.” She made to stand up, but Harry pulled out his wand.
Draco didn’t know whether he wanted to laugh or cry.
“You don’t see me freaking out, or leaving the table, do you?” Ron asked. “Although I’d very much like to do both those things, I’m not.”
“Then tell me,” Draco whispered. “What is it?”
this, was he?
“N-No . . .”
His tone was so casual, but Potter’s face was not. It made Draco want to cower away in fear.
“Could you go over to his place and check on him?” Parkinson pleaded. “I’m sure everything’s fine, I just want to make sure, and I know he’ll just shutter up and kick me out because we’ve freshly fought. At least your wounds are a few weeks old now.”
“So, Draco,” Annie continued. “Are you eating well?”
The glint in Harry’s eye and the matching smirk meant he was jesting, but the joke hit Draco a little too hard. His face must have done something Harry didn’t like, for Harry frowned and stepped closer to him.
Draco was a mystery he was nowhere near close to solving.
“Hermione, I never got the chance to formally apologize to you for all the awful things I said to you in school,” said Draco, wringing his hands. “It was terrible of me to treat you that way. You didn’t deserve it. You’re the brightest witch I know, and it doesn’t matter what your blood type is. I’m sorry.”
“He’s not the same person he was in school,” said Harry, letting all the words out in one big whoosh. “He’s hiding out in the Muggle world because he’s afraid of coming back here. He works in a bookshop- a
“Why not? Why can’t we be together?”
Harry’s touch was intoxicating, and he could never get himself large enough a fix.
“But he’s a total and utter prat to me.”
“Draco . . .”
“Well, I don’t have all day, Potter. Let’s get this show on the road.”
“Oh.” Harry felt very faint. Tonight had been a rollercoaster, but he had a feeling his ride was only just beginning.
Draco’s grey eyes narrowed at him. “What’s your angle?”
“Harry, who is that?” asked a feminine voice, and Draco
loud clink. “You were doing so well, too.”
“Ginny, I . . . I want you to know I’ll be here for you,” he said. The words battled against every instinct he had to kick and scream and shout like the infant they were going to have. Merlin, Christ, he was going to be a
again. “I’m not being polite. I’m just telling it like it is. It’s a whole lot cleaner than my place, that’s for sure.”
The shuttering of cameras and shouting of voices went on in the background, but all Draco could focus on were Harry’s lips on his, Harry vocalizing their relationship, Harry admitting for the world to see that he
“It wouldn’t have worked,” Potter said. “You have to really mean that spell.”
Pansy’s words hurt him deeply, because he knew she was absolutely, one hundred percent right.
“No,” said Harry. “I haven’t.A couple weeks ago he firecalled me and saw me with Ginny and totally freaked. He got completely the wrong idea. She was over because she and I had gone broom shopping earlier that day. Nothing happened.”
“What baby?” Draco breathed.
“That’s none of your business.”
things to work out between you and Potter?” asked Blaise skeptically.
“But we used a protection charm.” Harry was growing light-headed. He needed to lie down. “C-Can we sit, please?”
“He beat me until I couldn’t walk.”
“And something came over me. I had to defend you. I dunno what it was. But I couldn’t just leave you like that. And as for your mum, well . . . She lied to Voldemort for you. That’s about as brave as it gets.”
“I dunno, Draco, you look really sick.”
So Draco walked to the back office to fetch his clipboard and papers. On his way back out, he heard the bell ring. Sighing, he set down the papers and walked over to retrieve his customer.
“Because . . . You were so young.”
“I . . . I . . . I didn’t think about stopping and talking,” Draco admitted, feeling on the verge of tears. “I just wanted to keep kissing you and forget about it.”
Ginny stood up, adjusting her beanie, before turning around to face Harry.
“-and you are honored by
“It’s been seven years,” said Harry.
“Italy.”
“That feel good?” he asked softly, pressing a kiss behind the shell of Draco’s ear.
Draco took a deep, shuddering breath, fingering the bandage on his wrist. How was he supposed to tell her about Pureblood society, and arranged marriages, and all his internalized homophobia? The war, the Dark Lord living in the manor, the mark, the torturing, all of it?
“Your arrangement goes both ways, you know,” she said, as if he didn’t know that. But he didn’t want to be desperate. If he began initiating, he didn’t think he’d be able to stop. And it would eventually grow to be too much for Harry.
“Yeah?”
Draco flushed. “You can’t just . . . You can’t just
“Oh.”
“I’m sorry,” said Harry, because he didn’t know what else to say.
“You are so gone for him it isn’t even funny. Has he any clue how you feel?”
“You do realize how manipulative that is, right?”
“Do not call me that. I
“Thanks, Draco,” he said. “Maybe I’ll be back for more, yeah? Hermione gets sick a lot.”
Draco shook his head. “No,” he said, a choked sort of laughter escaping him. “He doesn’t.”
“What are they saying now?” asked Ron.
Potter reached his hand out, then appeared to think the better of it and pulled it away. Draco found he wanted, no,
a dream.
But he couldn’t. And it was killing him.
“Yeah, I- Wait a second, did you think I
“You just got out of the hospital. It’s kind of okay if you’re not okay right now.”
“Harry-”
“Merlin, Draco, you can suck cock,” said Harry. “I don’t even want to know how you got so good.”
Potter thanked the waitress, and removed his hand from Draco’s. His hand immediately felt cold from the loss. Draco looked down at his monster of a burger, which smelled
Draco scoffed, and it was a wet and ugly thing. “Are we really going down this road?”
Pansy looked down.
“I dunno what you’re talking about.”
In a daze, Draco nodded.
“I don’t want your blessing if it isn’t sincere,” Harry said quickly. “You’re the most important person in Draco’s life, and if you aren’t on board, then I walk. No questions asked.”
“I just got back from the fucking hospital,” Harry said. “He doesn’t want to see me. I can’t keep . . .
“Y-You can’t just- Just
“It’s no one’s fault,” Draco told her, horrified she would think such a thing. “Except for mine, of course.”
“No, really, Malfoy, that’s . . . That’s so fucking unfair.”
me, Harry Potter?”
“Your doctor told me they put you on medication. For depression and anxiety.”
“Darling,” she said, and her voice sounded so shattered that Draco’s already battered heart was breaking all over again.
Talk about selfish.
“Shit,” he whined.
“Only here,” he answered. The question was simple enough; but the odd way in which Potter had posed it, almost as if he were genuinely curious for the answer, left him feeling off-kilter.
“How can you honestly expect me to believe you just suddenly changed your mind like that?” Draco asked, snapping his fingers for emphasis. “You stormed out after I didn’t take the words the way you wanted.”
“You don’t even read,” said Hermione with a snicker.
“Why did you pass out?” he asked.
He pulled one out, examining its sharp, metal blades. He drew in a deep, shuddering breath, pulling back his sleeves on his left arm.
He half-hoped for Narcissa to wave aside his formal greeting and assure him that ‘Narcissa’ was fine, but of course, that didn’t happen.
“If it were, you and I would be sitting here arguing all night. But it’s not, and I’m just trying to tell you that maybe some of your views of yourself are a little . . . Harsh.”
Harry nodded and chuckled, pressing a kiss atop his forehead before rolling off the bed and padding to the bathroom to get a towel. Once he returned to the bedroom, he handed the towel to Draco, who began drying himself off.
“It’s just Weasley,” he began, wanting to kick himself for how weak he sounded.
about this,” Draco said despairingly, pushing Potter off himself. He buried his head in his hands as he continued to cry silently.
“Harry, this can’t happen!” he exploded. Under the dimmed lights of Grimmauld Place, he was rapidly unraveling, and he knew if he wasn’t careful Harry was going to get tangled in the remnants.
“Did I say something?”
“I know.” Draco glumly looked down, unable to make eye contact with his friend. Who may want nothing more to do with him.
“And you still held him and acted as a human tissue anyways?”
Potter only chuckled at his antics, green eyes twinkling, though not unkindly, as he pocketed the change. “It’s okay,” he said. “Nothing to be sorry for.”
“Draco, I-”
“What about you?” Draco asked. “You quit a job you hated. What are you going to do now? You have no idea, do you?”
be it, Potter had actually sacrificed himself for the wizarding world just like the Dark Lord asked him to, he had actually walked into that forest and
“She’s a tough cookie. I think she can handle it.”
Potter chuckled at him. “You’re cute when you’re nervous,” he said.
“I thought you said-”
“So . . .” Potter said, setting his cup down on the coffee table. “I wanted to bring something up, if that’s alright with you.”
“O-Okay.” Draco opened his eyes again.
He didn’t know why he felt so defensive relaying this information to Parkinson. It wasn’t as though he and Draco were in a relationship- if he wanted to fuck Ginny, he absolutely could.
“What do you mean, ‘what’s going on?’”
“I know what I said, and here’s what I meant. I think talking to you is the right thing to do, because you’re upset and I want to know why. Not because someone is upset, but because
Draco shook his head shyly.
The only sound that Harry could hear was the flickering flames of the floo.
“Draco . . .”
“This is exactly what I’m talking about. You are putting your problems on me. Blaming me for not being there to prevent you from hurting yourself. Y-You should . . .” She cut herself off with another gasp, “You should know
“I’m assuming based on your empty plate you had a good experience,” said Potter.
“And you think something’s wrong with him?”
“Harry, that’s sweet,” Ginny said softly. “But I know you don’t really want to do any of that-”
“Mhm?” Harry replied absently, spelling a pile of dishes clean.
“Fuck,
“Use Legilimency. I want you inside my head, Harry. We can do it.”
Harry scooped them bacon and eggs, then while Draco sat awkwardly at the table by himself Harry poured himself a cup of coffee, and asked Draco if he’d like any. Draco politely declined.
Draco’s head was swirling while he made the drinks. He was already buzzed from the beer because he was a lightweight, and he had a feeling that if he wasn’t careful, tonight had the potential to end very, very poorly for him. What was he thinking, inviting Potter into his home? What good could come of that?
, but it had still rattled him considerably. Potter had
The first time Harry and Draco made love was rough, quick and sweaty.
Potter chuckled. “Always like to lighten the mood, I see, Malfoy.”
They were standing awfully close together, and Draco was hyper-conscious of their closeness.
After a terrible night’s sleep of tossing and turning in bed, Draco landed on the realization that he was an idiot. A terrible, terrible idiot.
“You were
He didn’t receive a response to his second letter, either. He couldn’t help but feel discouraged and disappointed. And worried that Draco was going to pick Narcissa over him, which would be a perfectly reasonable choice.
Harry laughed, boisterous and beautiful as always. The windchimes rang pleasantly in Draco’s ears. “Eloquent as always, Draco.”
“We were never friends,” Draco said dryly. “Not for a second. I always saw him as something more. I knew he was special. When we were eleven, I offered him my hand in friendship, but he rejected me.”
“Please, call me Molly, dear,” she said kindly with a smile so big an outsider might have guessed that Draco was her own child.
Draco nodded. He wanted to get through this humiliating evaluation as quickly as possible so he could just be left alone and in peace. How nice would that be?
“So the sanctity of marriage means nothing to you anymore?”
“Why not?”
“Not every bad thing in my life is centered around Harry,” Draco said hotly. “I have my own problems, including the fact that I’m ostracized from society and cannot go within a ten mile radius of Diagon without people hexing and cursing at me everywhere I go.”
Not in the mood to deal with Parkinson for the second time tonight, Harry growled in frustration before rising to answer the door.
Draco nodded, feeling an onset of tears. Powerless to stop them, his eyes began to leak.
Harry stood in the frame, looking upset. The nerve of him.
“A sandwich.”
doing?” Draco exclaimed in shock.
Harry pulled away from him. Draco couldn’t see him, but he imagined his lips to be coated with Draco’s come. The image made him convulse.
Parkinson looked skeptical. “Nothing happened. Right.”
at the innocent Muggleborns, the Dark Lord’s thin, red slits for eyes that bore into his very soul, his tattered Occlumency shields. How both ends of the Unforgivable ripped his heart into shreds.
Hope fluttered in Draco’s chest, fragile as a hummingbird. He squashed it back down.
“What are you doing?” Potter asked him.
“Harry asked me to keep it a secret, and I wanted to honor that-”
Draco blinked owlishly, opening his eyes to see someone kneeling over him, hands hovering above him as if they were afraid to touch him.
“No, but you can move on from them,” said Harry kindly. “One day at a time.”
Draco had to still be sleeping, because there was no way this was his reality.
“That’s not what you said three days ago.”
Draco took Potter’s clear hint that he’d overstepped, and pursed his lips. “I’m sorry,” he said tightly. “I didn’t mean to imply that you aren’t entitled to your feelings. That would be hypocritical of me.”
“Harry, you have to talk to her. She can’t just take your happiness away from you like that- that’s not her place.”
Ginny’s eyes were ready to pop out of their sockets. “And you asked me to
Molly got him a jumper.
Potter had told him he was bisexual. Why had he considered it important to tell Draco this?
Annie frowned. “How has this affected your relationship with your mother? How does she feel about your sexual orientation?”
him?”
More accurately, it sounded like the old Draco. Ginny was not familiar with the new one.
“Murder.”
That was all Harry had ever wanted.
“Nothing, just relax,” Potter said soothingly, drawing another circle on his wrist for emphasis. Draco released a breath.
“Oh, fuck,” Draco whimpered, and the sound traveled straight to Harry’s crotch.
“You’ll only confuse him more, heavens knows he’s been through enough. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to St. Mungo’s right now to see him.”
“No milk, two sugars,” Draco said as Potter rummaged through his cupboard and pulled out two mugs.
“Because he-” She cut herself off, clearing her throat. “Because he trusts you.”
Harry nodded. “Eloquent.”
Draco, like a frightened animal, shook his head even faster than Harry had and shrank back into his pillows.
“Look, Draco, I have my own life, and my own shit to deal with. You’ve got to start taking yours a bit more seriously if you want to snap out of this funk, which I’m assuming you do, because if you didn’t that would be so depraved and pathetic that I think I might actually kill myself.”
Harry pulled his boyfriend into a searing kiss, easing him back on the pillows and pinning his wrists above his head.
Approximately five minutes after hanging up the firecall with Draco and lowering his wards to let him in, Harry heard a knock on the door.
Draco sighed. “Yes, I suppose it would be rude of me to leave you standing out in the cold, wouldn’t it?”
“You want me to go check on Draco?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said limply.
Potter held Draco’s leg open with one hand while the other moved past his balls, past his perineum, to the tight little ring of rosy muscle. The finger circled around his entrance, lubing him up, before slipping inside.
Ginny’s blue eyes widened considerably. “And I suppose you think I’m just going to
He made himself a steaming cup of Earl Gray and waited for two more hours. Harry may have been unemployed, but he still had a life. He was sure to be busy, right?
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Harry said, knowing Draco felt everything he was feeling and then some. “I’m so sorry.”
“It was . . . It was a really good kiss, for starters.”
The bell jingled as he opened the wooden door, and he looked around the shop. Nobody else was in there.
“That’s quite a sizable promise, Harry. Are you sure you’re up to the task?”
Seeing him shaking and sobbing like a small child had broken something in Harry; how had he left Draco alone? Because he’d said one mean thing?
Sorry it's been a while!! Little life update, school's been going well, I'm a writing tutor now so I'm busy with that, and I just went home this weekend to celebrate my grandma's 80th so that was a lot of fun. The gears started turning again, so this is the result :)
“Indeed,” Mother said, reading his reaction. “And he told me the most riveting thing.”
“What is it? It can’t be worse than the bomb I just dropped on you.”
Another tingle of his wrist, this time almost immediately.
Another glance was exchanged. This time, Ron picked up on it. “What’s going on?”
“That’s got to have taken a massive toll on your family.”
Draco repeated, feeling his breath come out in little gasps.
He didn’t need Harry’s
“I wish he’d written to me about it,” said Narcissa wistfully, then seemed to immediately recognize herself. “I’m sorry . . . I sound like a child, don’t I?”
He had willingly extended his arm to the Dark Lord to mark. He had willingly tortured all those Muggleborns. He could have fought back, like Harry- but he hadn’t.
Nearly.
“Lost touch.”
“Oh, nothing, just . . . You’re cute when you’re in denial,” Pansy chided. “It’s written all over your face.”
know that?”
“Why do you even
“You’d know that, wouldn’t you, Potter? You couldn’t keep your eyes off me, by the sound of it.”
Ginny sighed. “Do I know her? Or him?”
“Mrs. Weasley?”
“Hey,” Potter said, putting his hand on the table, very near Draco’s. “I was only joking. It’s okay.”
“Absolutely not,” Draco said. “If I let one more person into my head, I think I might explode.”
“It’s not much,” was the first thing to leave Draco’s mouth as Potter followed him inside, closing the door behind him. While he was taking a look, Draco locked the door.
If they were for himself, then Draco was concerned. His health couldn’t be in too promising of a condition if Potter constantly needed the Draughts, could it? What if he was having nightmares? What if he was having anxiety?
“Take your time to think about it. In the meantime, I’m going to tell my family about this.”
“Of course,” said Harry quickly, letting go of Draco and standing up, pushing down the hurt he felt from practically being booted from Draco’s flat. His hands felt cold from the absence of Draco.
But Harry had treated him exactly the same, hadn’t he?
“It’s not about me anymore, Gin,” said Harry. “It’s about our family.”
“I want to name her Rose. I haven’t told Ron yet, because I’m nervous he won’t like it, but something deep inside me is telling me that she’s a Rose. Does that make sense? I’m not making sense, am I?”
“He was-”
How dare he? Potter didn’t know what kind of friend he was, the awful way he’d treated Greg. How he’d pushed Pansy and Blaise away during sixth year, and never truly gotten them back. Pansy may still be a part of his life, and regularly made efforts to contact him and see him, but it would only be a matter of time until she realized how shitty of a person Draco really was and let him be.
“What, like this?”
Draco scoffed. He gripped his left arm, which was odd to Harry, but he reasoned there were more important things to focus on.
“I know you don’t want him, Potter, you’ve made that quite clear,” growled Parkinson, pointing an accusing finger at him. “But right now you’ve got a job to do, because Draco needs you.”
Draco’s eyes widened. He almost looked hopeful.
Unless she was only saying his name while offering her condolences.
“After-effects of Cruciatus,” Draco responded without missing a beat. “Mother says it will go away eventually-”
Harry had just settled into the sofa and flipped on the telly, surfing through the channels, when he heard a knock at his door.
Draco felt hot tears prick at the corners of his eyes. He blinked rapidly to rid himself of the rude intrusion.
“You sure?”
“I can if he’s a Death Eater.”
Once they got into bed, Harry pulled him flush to his chest, wrapping both arms around him, burying his nose in Draco’s hair and inhaling before setting his face in the crook of Draco’s shoulder.
“We start over.” Harry sounded painfully hopeful, and Draco didn’t know if he had the heart to crush him. “We put all that rubbish behind us, because we know we love each other.”
, you feel so fucking good around me,” Potter groaned, eyes fluttering closed as Draco continued impaling himself on Potter’s cock.
made him feel better.
“This is nice,” he said quietly with a small sigh as Harry walked them to the bathtub.
it. Harry sucked and sucked, bobbing his head up and down and allowing Draco to tangle his hands in Harry’s hair.
Once they reached the bedroom, Draco was all but vibrating. Harry sat on the bed, pulling Draco with him so he sat across from him.
“We’re going to get some blood work done on you, to run some tests and make sure everything is okay.”
This time, Harry tried a different approach. He tried reaching for Draco, who flinched away from him with a hiss.
And as for Father? Well. He would be none the wiser.
“Mhm,” said Draco, nodding, drawing a deep breath to steady himself.
Also i wanted to make something clear. After receiving some hate mail on ffn, I thought it important to share. If you're reading my stories of your own volition, minding the tags and everything, it isn't fair of you to get upset at the way things play out. No one's holding a gun to your head and forcing you to read my work. The fact that this has to even be said is sad, but hate will not be tolerated. There's a difference between constructive criticism and hate.
Harry squirmed with nervousness. “Narcissa, I’m so sorry. I promise I’ll stay away from him now while he gets the help he needs, and when he’s stronger I’ll-”
“But were
Draco sighed, closing the distance between himself and Harry and allowing Harry’s strong arms to wrap around him, holding him tight.
Glancing at Potter, Draco didn’t immediately see signs of sleep deprivation. Potter must have either glamored off the effects, which fractured his heart the smallest amount, or they must have only just started, and he was taking preventative measures. Draco sincerely hoped it was the latter.
“What does it matter if I’m happy?” Draco asked miserably. “I’m a Death Eater- we don’t deserve to be happy.”
“Why?”
Draco hummed around Harry’s cock, swallowing him even deeper as his tongue swirled and flicked and sucked.
“Draco . . .” She let it out in a ghosted whisper.
“More . . . More personal than our baby?”
But when Harry choked out another “I love you,” Draco didn’t feel like one. He didn’t feel like one when Harry clutched him closer and came inside him, crying out his name. He didn’t feel like one as Harry pulled out of him with a loud squelch and flopped down on the bed beside him and drew him in, pressing a kiss onto his temple and murmured how good he was.
Draco nodded. “Just a bit nervous, is all.”
“You’re not drinking tea, then, you’re just essentially drinking milk with leaves.”
“Draco.” Harry scooted closer to him on the couch, and reached for his trembling hand. Draco let him take it. Harry rubbed the skin softly, feeling every bump and ridge of his knuckles. “I don’t.”
“May I ask why?” Draco felt like a broken record.
Draco knew plenty. He knew Harry hated victimizing himself; he’d only said that to rile him up. He also knew Harry hated being called “easy” when he used sex as a means to cope after the war. Until, of course, he’d run into Draco at a Muggle bookshop. He’d kept coming back to the bookshop, asking for recommendations. Draco had eventually, boldly, asked him if he had gotten himself a girlfriend who really liked to read, shacked up with Granger, turned into a bookworm himself, or just found Draco really fit. Harry had smiled and pinned him up against the wall and kissed him.
“Likes would be an understatement,” said Parkinson, immediately followed by a groan of frustration.
“I was fine before Harry came along and disrupted my life,” said Draco. “Now that he’s out of it, everything will go back to normal, and I’ll be fine.”
“But you and Potter are meant to be together,” said Pansy. “It’s literally embedded in the stars. Don’t you, I dunno, want to at least try?”
Draco’s worst fears had been confirmed. Harry didn’t want him anymore. “W-What?”
“Why would I be cross with you?” Harry asked. “That’s very private information, and of course if we date I’d want you to tell me eventually, but I wouldn’t have any expectations for you to tell me before you’re ready.”
Ginny’s face hardened. “I remember him calling me a blood traitor when I was a first year and hexing me with dirt, saying I needed to go back to where I came from, anyway.”
“What’s your floo?” Potter asked. “I’ll firecall you.”
cried Draco, so loudly it startled Harry. “You’ve been so . . . so
“Gonna add one more,” Potter said huskily, withdrawing the two and breaching his puckered hole with a third. Draco nodded enthusiastically, moaning as Potter twisted and pushed the digits inside him, opening him up. He’d entirely forgotten how good this could feel. The feeling was similar to smelling something that aroused old, fond memories.
“Malfoy, that’s . . . That’s horrible.”
“That’s normal,” assured Harry. “Just . . . Don’t try and fight it, yeah? I’ll be able to read all your feelings, so I’ll know if you’re uncomfortable. But if you fight it, it won’t be a very good experience for either one of us.”
So he left.
“We can’t, and you know that,” said Harry. “We can’t.”
“What is it? Talk to me.” Potter lifted up off Draco to give him some breathing room, bracing himself over the other man and continuing to kiss his scars in an almost delicate fashion.
He swung open the door, and wordlessly invited her in.
that was of me, and I went back to his flat to fix it, but when I got there . . .” Harry drew another deep breath, locking eyes with Narcissa as her expression slowly morphed into horror. “He had gone and done it.”
“Clearly you aren’t equipped to make those decisions on your own!” Harry snapped. “Look at what you did to yourself.” The cancerous concern morphed into fiery, white-hot anger that flowed through him like lava on the verge of erupting.
“Why does this have to be so hard?”
“Is it because she and I used to date?”
“Where’d you learn to cook like this?” he asked, taking another bite of eggs, humming around the substance. Once he swallowed, he looked back up at Harry. “Your Muggle relatives must’ve been great cooks, teaching you all this.”
. He didn’t need anybody’s help.
“I can listen,” he said, sitting up straighter and looking Potter in the eye. “I understand more than you think.”
He knew his shutters were rising up, but he had to protect himself in case Potter’s interests were different. He couldn’t risk getting hurt again. Or humiliated, especially not in front of this man.
“Yes, alright,
, then why don’t you just go.”
“Because it
“Hold his right arm out,” instructed the nurse, almost robotically, all gentleness voided from her tone.
Harry closed his eyes in exasperation. “You don’t know the full story. Why I had to do what I did. But I’m going to tell you everything, if you’ll just-”
“Harry . . .” Draco’s breathing picked up the lower Harry kissed, and suddenly he found his hands tightening in Harry’s hair, pulling incessantly. Harry’s lips were instantly back on his, feral, demanding. Draco felt himself opening to his touches petal by petal like a tulip in the swell of spring, and he was blooming.
“I know where he works,” Narcissa said quietly. She didn’t sound too happy about it.
Harry feasted away. Licking and slurping, his tongue repeatedly stabbed Draco’s hot hole while he swallowed every last drop of come that came gushing out.
Draco parted his hands away from his face. “I didn’t press charges,” he said.
Draco’s eyes widened, and his entire demeanor softened. “Y-You’d do that?”
Draco felt the early onset of panic bloom in his chest, rapidly spreading. “No, that’s not what I-”
Potter’s expression softened. “It was the least I could do. I would’ve gone to your trial either way, and I actually wasn’t originally planning on speaking at yours- only hers, because I owed her. But I saw how . . . Helpless you looked, how defeated . . .”
“You have a point,” she conceded. “But, Draco, we’ve had this conversation before, and I’m going to ask you again. Is this really what you want to do for the rest of your life? Hide out in a Muggle neighbourhood, work a Muggle job, isolated from everyone you know? You have so much potential to positively impact the wizarding world, and-”
The group of friends was sitting together by the crackling fireplace. In spite of the warmth from the flames, Draco shivered.
“I’ll take care of you, okay?” Potter said, pressing a kiss to his forehead before sitting back up.
“No,” said Ginny. “As nice as that sounds, it’s really something I have to do alone.”
“What was it like?”
“Tell me it isn’t true,” said Greg.
. She gripped the edges of the toilet bowl and bawled herself raw.
that voice. That
“Draco?” Harry asked, manners completely failing him. “W-What are you doing here?”
“Erm,” he said, “I . . . That’s a very intimate thing to do.”
Potter must have heard, for he looked down at his stomach, then back up at him. He grinned, and the force of it nearly sent Draco to his knees. “I don’t blame you, Malfoy. I’m
“In spite of myself, I really wonder who it is,” said Hermione.
Draco opened his eyes, and the sheer effort left him winded and exhausted. He drew in a deep breath as he took in his surroundings.
He gave into the darkness and let himself go limp.
“This is my fault,” Pansy said dejectedly as they got ready to side-along. They linked arms. “I was too harsh with you.”
Draco took ten minutes, at least. He missed his expensive, fancy soaps and scrubs. Here, all he had was a tiny container for shampoo and an even tinier container for body wash. How was
“You’re white as a sheet.” Harry sounded far too worried for his own good. “What’s happened?”
“You wanted to tell me. May I ask why? I thought we kept personal conversations out of this.”
“Are you sure?”
“That’s what I thought.”
want to change the rules?”
Draco sighed, deep and full. Harry saw right through him like a glass window.
Ginny pointed, a choked laugh escaping her throat. “You so did.”
Harry had borne his soul to him, and Draco had crushed it with his Muggle shoes. He missed dragonhide. He missed his expensive, tailored robes that hugged his figure perfectly, and he missed carrying his wand in public. He missed the wizarding world. Harry certainly wouldn’t still want to get him a therapist after the way he’d crushed him tonight, so Draco figured he was still stuck here. He was too much of a coward to ever dig himself out on his own.
“He may have exacerbated things, but you weren’t doing too well before you met him, either.”
Potter scoffed. “It’s . . . Acquired.”
evil,” Pansy hissed. His other friends nodded in agreement.
“There’s no rule stating that if you take a guy home he has to sleep with you,” Potter murmured soothingly, rubbing a strong hand up and down Draco’s back. “That may be socially understood by many, but it isn’t a rule.”
“H-He’s this way.” He gestured to the bathroom, and the Muggles wheeled in a stretcher and lifted Draco’s frail body, securing him. They rolled him out of the flat and lifted him into the ambulance.
“You don’t realize how selfish you are, Draco.”
“Why are you telling me about it?” Draco asked. “It sounds like you’ve been miserable there for a while. You’ve had your fill of chasing Dark wizards. The choice seems fairly obvious to me.”
. I was
Potter was shaking his head, and Draco’s heart began to beat faster. “Malfoy, you’re as responsible for the war as I am.”
Once Draco had been transferred to the psychiatric unit, he was brought into a bathroom, of sorts, to strip and shower.
With a small smile, he flipped the pill bottle upside down and emptied a few capsules into his hand. This was it. He would finally be free.
Draco sighed. “It’s fine. Let’s just get you these Draughts so you can be on your way.”
“This is scary,” Draco breathed.
“Oh,” Harry said lightly, then recognition flashed over his face.
But it was like the more he tried to think about it, the more the memories attacked him, bludgeoning his hippocampus one by one.
“This is wrong,” Draco breathed, struggling in his grip. “This is wrong, I can feel it-”
“You’re right, you can’t, but you can be a part of his support system,” said Hermione. “If you really love him, you’ll spend as long as it takes showing him you care.”
Draco couldn’t stop a tear from falling. It acted completely of its own accord, utterly betraying him. He sniffled softly.
“No!” he exclaimed, shrill. “Please, stop-”
“But are you
“What are
He couldn’t help but wonder. How could life be bad, when things like this existed?
“It doesn’t have to make sense,” Potter replied. “Trauma rarely does.”
“I don’t think you have been for a while, Draco.”
Potter laughed. And Draco wanted to hear the sound again and again and again.
“I see that now.” Harry put his head in his hands. Was he wrong that he was less concerned about their baby and more about Draco?
. “Fucking.”
Selling seemed like the more sophisticated option. Draco wasn’t one to get his hands dirty.
How could just
“Lately it’s been hard,” said Draco carefully. “My appetite’s not the best these days.” He decided to leave out the part where some days he was so afraid to leave his home in fear that someone would find him and hex him that his stomach would twist and cramp up and shrivel into nothingness until the mere idea of food had him hurling over a toilet.
“Mhm,” Harry agreed. As he dove deeper into Draco’s head, memories from his childhood popped up. Memories of Lucius slapping him for arbitrary things, such as speaking out of term or helping a house elf.
“What if it isn’t?”
him, moving incessantly, setting a brutal pace that had him thrashing and moaning unabashedly. He clawed onto Harry’s back as pleasure swelled in his gut, and Harry continued to grunt “I love you”s as he fucked Draco so thoroughly he would feel it for the next week.
The beeping grew faster, ringing in Draco’s eardrums like nails on a chalkboard. His head was underwater; he couldn’t
“They abused me.”
“You should try it sometime. It does wonders for the head,” quipped Draco.
Once he was done, he dried off, then changed into the green scrubs that had been left for him. They hung, obnoxiously oversized, off his small body.
“Draco, please, sweetheart, calm down-”
“Mmmm,” he hummed, eyes rolling shut as a surge of flavor erupted in his mouth.
“This is twisted,” said Ron, shaking his head, “and wrong. And you can’t ask me to just lie down and accept it after what he did to Bill.”
“Good morning to you, too,” Harry murmured fondly, chuckling quietly to himself as he continued to fiddle with the food. “How’d you sleep?”
But when Draco’s eyes began to sparkle as he described in vivid, animated detail the exact components of the potion’s formula, effects, and flavour, he decided he wasn’t.
“I’m going to spell this away now,” said Harry, reaching in his pocket for his wand.
Draco knew it would be a long way before he was fully recovered. Even halfway. But here in St. Mungo’s hospital, under the rising sun and chirping birds, he felt a piece of himself heal.
Harry’s hands fell limply to his sides. He sat up straighter in his chair, training his eyes on Draco. “You . . . I . . . How could you . . . I mean, that’s not, you don’t have to answer that, I’m sorry, I’m only . . . I just . . . Jesus Christ, Draco,
“It’s about to get even nicer,” Harry said with a kiss to his head as he lowered Draco into the bubbling tub. Draco immediately began playing with the bubbles, smiling openly. “You used lavender. My favorite.”
“Go ahead.” Draco gestured with his hand for Harry to continue.
“Honey . . .” Pansy rubbed a soothing hand along his thigh. “You’ve got to put an end to this.”
“But I am cross. Why would you
He was pathetic. Damaged. Unlovable. Broken.
“Three days without him is hardly well. And that’s only because he didn’t initiate contact.”
“I still see her, though lately I’ve been pulling away.”
Potter cleared his throat, looking Draco deep in the eye. “I feel like . . . I feel like we sort of just let that kiss happen and didn’t really talk about it.”
Hermione gasped softly. Ron, on the other hand, looked outraged.
“This was an accident, I swear, I never meant to hurt you like this-”
Immediately a sense of calm washed over him like a nice, warm blanket. This was better than a Peace Draught. This was . . .
“Ron,” Hermione began, but she was promptly talked over,
“I know, baby, I know.”
“Of course it doesn’t.”
“Draco, I’m- That wasn’t- I’m sorry.”
Harry put an arm around Draco’s back, wordlessly maneuvering him to lean into the warm body. Draco was hardly in a state to refuse, and Harry’s touch felt so
So why was Draco freaking out?
“That’s because I don’t share my personal life with you. Until now.”
Potter finished the rest of his drink in one smooth go and passed the glass to Draco.
“You’re all nice and wet for me,” he praised, pressing kiss after kiss into the soft skin as he pistoned his fingers just right to hit him where he knew Draco would see stars. “So wet.”
“Draco, please don’t walk away from me again. You aren’t a body to me, you never have been. Fuck, Draco, I need you. I fucking
And Draco kissed him.
When they reached the restaurant, Potter held the door open for Draco, whose heart began stuttering. When they sat at the bar, Potter ordered them two pints while Draco began perusing the menu.
“Baby, I need you to be strong for me,” he whispered. “Gonna need you to open those beautiful eyes again.”
Potter hummed, chuckling as he kissed down Draco’s chest one more time, all the while easing Draco’s legs apart even more until he was completely spread-eagle on the sofa. By the time Potter had kissed all the way down his stomach and stopped just before his cock, Draco was panting heavily, filled to the brim with anticipation. He and Potter were about to have sex. Potter didn’t know he was demi. Was this okay? Was he deceiving Potter?
“How do you take it? I know it’s such a small thing, but it’s still something I don’t know about you.”
“What’s really going on?”
With regret, he pulled apart from Draco, who pouted adorably.
“He raped you?” Potter asked quietly. The silence that followed was deadly.
Draco had meant it plenty when Mother’s life was dangling before his eyes by a thread.
“It’s alright,” Potter responded gently, and Draco knew in that instant he did not deserve the man sitting next to him right now. He simply did not.
Draco nodded.
As Draco continued to melt into him, Harry continued to kiss down his beautiful body, humming and licking and sucking at certain spots where he knew Draco would writhe. He gently pried Draco’s knees apart, hands sliding down to grip his inner thighs.
Draco couldn’t help himself. He laughed with him, and soon the two were laughing in earnest together, and it was the most earth-shatteringly magnificent thing Draco had ever experienced.
Draco nodded, and to his dismay he felt his eyes begin to water.
Ginny’s eyes widened, and her mouth opened in shock. But she did not look pleased. Not in the slightest. Before Harry could ask her what was wrong, she began to speak.
“Oh, darling . . . It will be so good, I promise you. I’ll take such good care of you, okay?”
“It’s Malfoy.”
Potter smiled back at him. “They’re having a girl.”
“Him or us.”
Draco’s eyes were red-rimmed as though he’d been crying, and he wore a deep frown on his face instead of his usual smirk.
He pulled his finger out, quickly replacing it with two. Draco groaned at the added stretch, feeling his hole strain to accommodate the digits.
“Have you experienced any other major traumas besides being forced to hurt people?”
“What did you tell them?” asked Ron.
“It’s the little things, Draco. It’s the little things.”
Draco reeled back as if he’d been smacked. Shaking his head, Harry pulled open the door and stepped outside. “Take care, Draco.” And he was gone.
Because Draco was a coward, and because he didn’t deserve any kindness this stunningly handsome man had to offer him, his chest tightened and his throat choked up as he said the following words,
“Still see you’re humble as ever,” Draco mumbled, whacking Harry across the arm.
“No,” Draco responded, tone clipped.
who will do anything he says. It’s sick, Draco.”
“Oh god,” Harry choked out, breathing quickening as fast as lightning.
“There was no sale,” Draco blurted out, and honestly, trust his mouth to betray him at the worst of times.
“Unnngh,” Draco moaned, back arching as blinding hot pleasure washed over him like a wave. Potter began bobbing his head, hollowing his cheeks as he sucked, and Draco was already overwhelmed with the need to come. It spread from his belly all the way to his toes, and little pants left his mouth as Potter continued to suck him like a lollipop.
“Smells delicious in here, Potter.”
“And?”
Draco was ready to collapse into a fit of sobs.
“S-Stay there?”
“Mmmm, yes,” hummed Draco.
“I’m not trying to make sense of it right now. I’m still stuck on the actual event,” sniffed Draco.
Harry weighed his options. He could leave Draco alone, which was obviously what Draco wanted, but risk him self-harming again. Or he could go barge in on his space, possibly getting kicked out again. Neither option was favorable.
Harry continued to massage Draco’s scalp, eliciting various noises out of the blonde man, which caused his cock to twitch in spite of himself. Harry was ready for round two, but he had a feeling Draco would be spent after this.
“Fuck me, Harry,” he whispered in his ear.
“I’m assuming Ron didn’t take the news of you and Malfoy very well,” she said.
tile of the bathroom welcoming death, and waking up miserable and cruelly alive in that hospital bed. Potter had tried to kill him, and the knowledge hurt him to his very core.
“And . . .” Here was the hard part. Draco cleared his throat, steeling himself for the fallout of his words. “I want to do a lot more. Than just kiss. But I . . . I value our friendship. I don’t want to ruin it.”
“What else would you do to me?”
“Fine, Potter,” Draco snarled out, standing up and stepping closer to the other man. “You don’t love me? That’s just fine.”
And oh, how Draco wanted. He wanted as he watched Potter lean his head onto his elbow, twirling a strand of black, curly hair with his spare hand. It was unfairly sexy.
“Still want to hear that beautiful voice,” Harry told him with another kiss to his leg as he wandlessly spelled his fingers with lube.
He felt shreds of self-loathing, and they almost seemed like old cuts that hadn’t healed properly. He felt how Draco was experiencing this so far- so far, he was finding it far more tolerable than Bellatrix or Voldemort’s incessant probing.
“Thank you. But really, it’s okay.”
Draco was soaring, soaring, soaring, and he needed to find ground, and fast. What he was engaging in right now was very, very dangerous.
“You’re here right now because you tried to commit suicide,” Annie told him delicately, and Salazar, he didn’t need her to walk on eggshells around him. “You are probably suffering from some form of depression, and I’ve gathered from speaking with you that you may have anxiety as well.”
“Right. Because you think it’s the right thing to do. Not because it’s me.”
Potter’s thick eyebrows disappeared into his hairline. “Are you sure?” he asked quietly.
“You understand that this situation you’re in . . . Isn’t your fault, right?”
He was so fucked.
Harry cut himself as a choked noise escaped his throat. He wiped his eyes with one hand, the other squeezing Draco’s delicate hand tightly.
Draco felt his own cock begin to stir at last, and as he continued stroking Potter’s abdomen, admiring and feeling the muscles, his hardness came to full fruition.
“Draco, sweetheart . . .” The pet name slipped out so easily it scared Harry. “I’m restraining myself so much it physically
“F-Fuck,” he cried.
Potter smiled at him, all lopsided and open. “Yeah,” he said quietly, “I did.”
Well, shit.
When Draco had finished ringing up his customer, Potter walked up to the register with three vials in a bag. He passed the bag to Draco.
Draco shuddered involuntarily at the idea of another needle poking at him.
Harry rejecting him. Harry taking pity on him. Harry
“It changes nothing,” said Draco. “We still can’t be together. Mother forbids it. If she finds out, I’m in serious trouble.”
Draco fumbled with his key before turning it in the lock.
Why was Potter asking him a question about his personal life? Draco wrung his hands together.
Potter unfolded his hands, looking at them as if they’d changed colour, before looking up at Draco.
“Say my name,” Harry growled, sounding utterly wrecked. “Say my name.”
“It’s actually better if you keep your eyes open,” Harry said. “It will keep the connection stronger.”
“That’s beside the point,” said Harry, flushing further.
and frowning even deeper.
“So good for me, Draco,” Potter murmured against his lips, pressing one, two, three kisses there before moving back to his neck, biting and sucking and lapping over the tender flesh. Draco could only gasp and flail his hands as Potter worked his way down towards his collarbone, unbuttoning Draco’s dress shirt.
She lifted a questioning eyebrow, wordlessly gesturing for him to continue.
“Can I call you back, Draco?” he asked, sounding oddly distressed. “Now’s really not a-”
Draco sighed in relief.
Harry turned around, setting his wand down on the counter, full attention on Draco.
“I could have fought back,” Draco mumbled.
He knew that voice.
“I did, yes. But then I realized how hideously absurd that was, because you’re hideously absurd to hold my baby over my head like that. You can’t take me away from my child, Ginny. I won’t have it.”
“You ready, baby?” Harry asked, and he saw Draco tense up slightly before nodding. Frowning, Harry reached for him.
“Clearly something else is bothering you, because you looked upset before I accepted your apology,” he said, and Merlin, but the bastard was right. From here on out, Draco would have to be a lot more careful.
“Have you ever had any psychiatric treatment before?” Annie asked him gently.
Once he was gone, Draco’s face crumpled like a cookie and hot, fat tears rolled down his cheeks.
“Merlin and Morgana.” Draco rubbed his hands across his face before resuming eye contact with Harry. “You just said you want to talk to me because it’s the
say anything?” exclaimed Theo to Draco.
“No, it fucking isn’t
“Draco,” Harry breathed, rushing to his side and taking his cold, clammy hand in his own. “I know you can’t hear me right now, but it doesn’t matter, because I’m gonna tell you all the same things as soon as you wake up. And as many times as you need to hear them until you believe me. I’m not leaving you ever again. I’m gonna stick to your side like glue, and you’re gonna get so sick of me you’ll wish you could wack me with a bludger.
“I should have known!” she exclaimed. “You were
But he did love him. He loved him very, very much. But Ginny wouldn’t want him anywhere near his baby if she knew that. So it was better this way, he reasoned. It was better for everyone.
“Can I talk to you?”
Draco realized his mistake as soon as the words came out. They sounded
“No way.” Draco toyed with the linen of his sheets as a means of calming down. “I want you out. Now.”
that?”
“You- I- This isn’t-”
Draco blinked dazedly at his nurse, whose face was beginning to swim in and out of focus.
“Mione, I’m surprised you aren’t more curious. I’m the one asking all the questions. Normally you’d be all over this.”
with a low growl. “You’ll stay away from him, forever.”
because of what happened, but that doesn’t mean I don’t ever. And I don’t just want sex, not anymore. That’s what I meant when I answered your question. I meant that I’m yours. If you’ll have me.”
“Let me do that,” Draco coaxed, hands covering Harry’s. Surprised, Harry sat back and let him. Once Harry was completely naked, Draco stood up to remove his own trousers, then climbed back on the bed, straddling Harry.
“Are you doing this for yourself?” Pansy asked him with an arched, thin brow. “Or are you doing it for me?”
Draco gasped as a particularly vicious cramp stabbed him in the side. He curled into the fetal position, muffling his cries so his neighbours wouldn’t call the Muggle police. The cold, hard tile floor was going to be the last thing he ever saw.
“What?” Parkinson asked softly, freezing up.
“Yes, I do-”
Draco blinked some more, and the figure came into focus. He saw rectangular spectacles that shielded green eyes, curly black hair, and a worried frown.
“I heard what you said.” Ron looked utterly aghast, and his skin had paled considerably. He looked like he was going to be sick.
he snapped. “Go fuck Weasley instead for all I care.” Without even bothering to button, Draco grabbed his coat and made to storm out, but Harry clamped a hand around Draco’s thin wrist.
“Forgive me for interrupting, Mr. Potter, but I thought I made myself quite clear on the matter regarding my son.”
“You know why,” said Draco.
Of course. He was on suicide watch. He couldn’t be left alone, in case he tried to kill himself.
Every three weeks, like clockwork, Harry came and saw him. Sometimes he bought morning sickness potion, sometimes Sleeping Draughts and Draughts of Peace, which Draco didn’t want to ask about. He knew that was personal, intimate information Harry may not be keen on sharing with him after the way he’d kicked him out of his life.
“You come to see me?” Draco asked, teasingly. “Is that why you come back to the shop so often? Are the Draughts just an excuse to ogle my tantalizingly gorgeous physique?”
The question, for some reason, seemed heavier than it appeared.
This was trouble.
Finally,
“It was a long time ago,” Draco said kindly, willing the emotion to stay out of his voice. “It’s okay.”
Potter’s eyes blazed with something that made Draco’s fragile heart constrict, and his jaw went slack as he inhaled quietly. His eyes fluttered closed, as he shook his head back and forth. Then he opened them again, focusing on Draco.
Potter kissed him then, sloppily and hungrily, growling into his mouth and grinding down his hips on top of Draco’s. The friction was maddening, and Draco found himself arching up into the touch, starving for more.
“You okay?” Harry asked him.
Draco smiled softly at him. “I didn’t know you liked me back.”
“Okay, so I haven’t been eating regularly. But it isn’t anything to worry about- Sometimes I just don’t get hungry,” he assured him.
“That’s not going to work,” said Hermione. “She doesn’t want to hear what you think about Malfoy when she hates him that much. She needs to hear that she cannot control who you see. That baby is both of yours, and you can’t let her walk all over you.”
“Don’t touch me.”
people out there, Harry, and you are so easy to love.”
Harry could immediately tell something was off. He looked paler than usual, a bead of sweat was plastered across his temples, and his grey eyes looked frantic, like a startled animal.
“Mhm?”
“That’s completely normal,” said Annie. “If you weren’t at least a little conflicted, I’d be worried.”
“I thought my lack of a response to your letters was a clear enough message, but apparently I was mistaken.”
“Verbal abuse is hardly a pillar of a healthy relationship, Draco,” Annie said, and to his dismay she sounded sad.
Draco glared at her.
Ron seemed to relax a little, slumping back into his seat. “Mate, the way you were going on about him . . . Scared me for a minute that you were actually in love with him.”
Potter must have noticed him tense up, for the kisses on his neck halted. He popped his head back up and looked Draco in the eye.
“I don’t even need to speak,” Draco said in realization as Harry coaxed his legs further apart. “You can see everything.”
“We kissed,” Draco said simply. “Not sure how much simpler it can get than that.”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this,” said Ron, “but if you love the ferret, you need to go after him and fix this.”
“Harry,” he said brokenly, and Harry made a sound in the back of his throat. “I’m sorry-”
“Are you kidding me, Potter? Do you know how unhealthy milk is? Did you know most mammals don’t drink milk past infancy? We’re the only ones.”
“I have a little extra stored away, funds that your father can’t touch. And don’t say that, Draco. Your health doesn’t have a price.”
“H-Harry?” For the first time in months, adrenaline clawed through Draco, real,
And Harry was falling into him, his umbrella falling to the floor with a wet patter. He gripped him so tightly Draco nearly stumbled with the weight of him. Harry kicked the door closed and pressed himself tightly against Draco’s body, gripping him almost painfully hard with violently shaking hands and resting his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry chuckled. “Do I have to have a reason?” His hand trailed from Draco’s wrist back up his arm, past his neck, until he was cupping his jaw.
“This is delicious,” said Potter. Draco nodded.
A few moments of silence, and then,
“You know, I never properly thanked you. For saving my mother as well,” Draco said, scratching his head awkwardly.
“Good evening, my love,” Harry greeted, taking his hands in his and bringing them up to his lips softly, kissing them delicately.
As the ambulance took off for the hospital, Harry knelt beside Draco and took his limp, cold hand in his own warm, alive ones. Rubbed the skin softly.
“Relationship?” exclaimed Pansy shrilly. “What you have is not a relationship. It’s a toxic, twisted clusterfuck at
Draco looked furious. “You really just have the worst timing, Harry. I was about to go draw myself a bath, so if you could keep this brief, that would be appreciated.”
Draco immediately stiffened, but in his weakened condition there was not much he could do to escape his situation.
Harry looked crestfallen. “But, Draco, it’s so
New Years was celebrated with a mix of everybody. Draco had gotten back in touch with Greg, and he’d patched things over completely with Blaise. Ron and Hermione threw the party at their flat, and when the clock chimed midnight Harry and Draco kissed as though they were the only two people in the room.
want him around our baby.”
“Yes,” Ron answered. “The idea of you and Malfoy still makes me want to lose my lunch, but if he really makes you that happy, then go get him back.”
“How was work today, love?” Harry asked as he led Draco upstairs after he shed his coat.
Harry cut himself off with a choked sob, and he squeezed Draco’s hand tighter. “You made me better. I never told you, but you did. Even my friends noticed it. Once you open those beautiful eyes, you’ll get to hear it from them yourself. They forgive you, Draco.”
“Because you’re a human being who deserves basic compassion and kindness just as much as everybody else,” said Potter, and the answer shattered Draco to pieces because he was
“No, I do, I do,” Draco insisted before he could stop himself, then immediately realized.
“I shouldn’t have thrown you out like that.”
“You gonna owl Parkinson?” Ron asked.
“I dunno. I just have this feeling, that all your shit talking is really just an attempt to cover up how badly you want to snog his face off.”
“It’s a him,” Harry said, “and yes you do. But before you get all excited, we’re only shagging. We aren’t in a relationship.”
“You’re so daft.” Parkinson shook her head. “Draco’s loved you since sixth year, if not earlier.”
Draco gave him a nod of consent.
“Draco?”
Harry watched helplessly as Draco hurriedly unbuttoned his baby blue dress shirt, growling in frustration when his normally dexterous fingers slipped off a button.
said Ron. “I haven’t seen you look this happy in ages.”
Draco lay back on the sofa, allowing Potter to coax his legs apart.
“Draco-”
Instantly Draco felt bad. It hit him with the force of a freight train.
“You like my best friend enough to use his first name.” Harry was grinning ear to ear, flowing to the brim with happiness.
“I know.”
“How was it?” she continued. “Was it awkward, the two of you hanging out?”
“So tell me.” Potter folded his hands in his lap, green eyes never leaving Draco’s.
“Harry, wait-”
“Language.”
“But, erm, a couple of years ago, I was at a wizarding club, and I took somebody home.” Draco ran a hand through his overgrown blonde hair in desperate need of a trim. He sighed, realizing that fixating on his hair wasn’t going to make telling this story any easier.
The nurse tssked at him. “I’m afraid that’s not how it works, sweetie. You’ve been put on suicide watch, and will stay here for the next five days. That is, of course, assuming you follow protocol and stick to your treatment plan.”
“I just don’t want this to change the way you see me,” Potter continued, rubbing his nose. “I don’t want you to think of me as some . . . Some
Draco’s breathing had picked up considerably. The patterns stopped. He twisted his hands in the thin material of Harry’s tee shirt as Harry skimmed a hand over his back.
“And me?”
“Mhm,” Harry agreed, sounding affected himself for a change. He rocked his hips back, pulling out halfway before slamming back in.
“Harry, this is weird, I don’t- I can’t-”
Was he
It didn’t help.
It was
“Draco, that’s not normal,” said Harry.
“How has life been treating you?”
“Like a baby.”
Harry said soothingly. But truthfully, it wasn’t okay at all. Draco talking to his friends about Harry only meant trouble; it meant that there was a chance he felt something more for Harry than just sex.
Harry found it was hard to breathe. “They’re saying . . . they aren’t who I think they are.”
“Narcissa . . .”
“Just a shag?” Ron asked uncertainly.
“Yeah?”
in our world. Then there’s me. The Death Eater, the fuck up. The one who had no choice. I never wanted to join them, Harry.” His voice had gotten wet again, and he sounded on the verge of tears. “They were going to kill my mother, you didn’t see how scared she was. It was you or her. And I chose her.”
amount supposed to cover his entire body?
Someone must have slashed his chest wide open with a knife, for he felt as though he were bleeding profusely. Just like when Harry had spelled him with
Harry, the snide bastard, only chuckled. He was like an Olympic swimmer after a race- barely tired at all. “That good, huh?”
with me?”
“You didn’t mean it,” Draco echoed, in disbelief.
“It’s not that I don’t
“Draco, Draco,
Draco thought of Harry wrapping Ginny close and telling her he loved her. Whispering in her ear how Draco meant nothing to him, how it had been her all along.
Draco smiled. “The best way to your heart is through your stomach, I swear.”
“ . . . Now you’re saying all these things, and calling me beautiful, and you just want to sleep with me again. You miss me that much, that’s the only thing you miss, I know it is, you will only ever love my
Draco gratefully accepted the suggestion and took a seat. Harry sat down next to him, eyes glued on him. It unnerved him.
Harry sighed, gesturing to the couch. “Sit, please.”
“Harry-”
They were both very, very naked, and because of the intimacy of the moment Harry had to struggle to keep his cock down.
“Draco, you’re shaking,” Harry said as gently as he could, noticing not for the first time when they did this the little tremors that wracked his frame.
Harry wasted no time in pulling out and kneeling behind him, hands sliding down to his arse cheeks and holding his gaping hole open with his thumbs. A trail of sticky, wet come trickled out. Harry blew air on Draco’s abused pucker, and Draco shivered.
“I don’t think it’s too much to ask for my best friend’s support, but it’s
“Mother was devastated,” said Draco. “He was . . . Involved with some people he shouldn’t have been. He didn’t get her involved, but he . . . Tried to get me involved. Tried to get me to hurt people.”
“He wouldn’t.”
Harry looked at him with a soft expression, waiting patiently for him to begin. Draco began fidgeting, feeling sweat pool around his temples.
“There’s nothing I can do to change it, so there’s no use complaining about it,” Draco said, somewhat dryly, for Potter’s concern was beginning to get on his nerves.
“Gonna come,” Harry warned him. “Want me to come inside you?”
“You were not fine, Draco. You were barely skating by. You weren’t living a real life. Pansy wrote to me about you. She was so worried.”
“Well, then. You know where the door is,” Harry said coldly.
“You’re one to talk,” Draco seethed, setting his cuppa down and pointing a finger at her. “You’re too afraid to tell Blaise how you feel about him, so you two have been dancing around your feelings for years-”
“You want to keep having mindless sex, right?”
“I didn’t ask you to-”
Draco sighed. “Alright,” he said. “I don’t blame myself for the rape or the war. There. You happy?”
“Nothing’s a hundred percent effective, Draco.” said Pansy. “You have to know what you’re dealing with. He’s clearly not over her, and he may eventually see you as someone who’s getting in the way of his family.”
. Draco had been hurting himself, for who knew how long. “C-Can I see?”
“So,” he said, swallowing thickly as he felt the alcohol begin to take its effect on him, “are Granger and Weasley thinking of any baby names yet?”
“We’re just worried about you, is all,” said Hermione.
Draco couldn’t keep up with this rapid change of pace. Just minutes ago, he and Harry were simple, no strings. Now Harry was saying he had
“You don’t brew?”
“My treat,” Potter said with a smile. “I’ll take care of it. You just enjoy, yeah?”
Draco gestured wildly around with his hands, setting his glass down on the coffee table. “For my actions. For all of it.”
“What do you mean?”
“May I ask what?”
He leaned in for a kiss, which Draco happily granted him. When Harry pulled away from him, Draco looked dazed.
“You sure you aren’t just saying that to get me into bed?”
“I think I’ve done enough damage to the wizarding world,” Draco said frostily. “It’s best that I stay away.”
He deserved to die.
Feebly, Draco nodded his head.
“Because they abused me.”
him for leading you on like that. He told you he loved you, then he
Draco’s eyes shot open, and his cheeks were doused in a generous coat of crimson.
Cold and clinical he could handle. Sweet and warm and kind was uncharted territory, and even if Draco had a map it would have been no use.
“What’d they say?”
all night. We need this bed for other patients.”
But then he realized. St. Mungo’s wouldn’t know how to deal with Draco. Wizards didn’t take pills- they took potions. Harry would have to find a Muggle hospital.
“Is that really how you feel?” Mother asked him softly, sounding completely and utterly heartbroken. “That all you’ve ever done is cause me pain and misery?”
Hi, sorry it's been a while!! I've been working on this other Drarry series that I just finished up. If any of you are interested in reading that, it's up on my page. The creative juices for this piece just weren't flowing while I was writing that series, but I'm back, and without any further ado here is chapter 9!
Ginny’s mouth opened. “I do
His last day at the book shop had been . . . oddly quiet. Saturday was normally their busiest day, but hardly anyone had come in. But Draco appreciated the quiet. He didn’t have the energy for pleasant conversation anymore.
him. And he was unable to give back. How was he supposed to tell him that?
Harry sighed, relishing in the touch of Draco.
“I can’t expect you to be at my beck and call 24/7,” said Draco. “That’s not how real life works. That’s not how friendship works. I don’t-”
“Why aren’t you with her?” Draco blurted out, and fuck, he really hadn’t meant to ask that.
“Wow,” said Harry. “I mean,
“You . . . You do?”
“Of course it matters,” said Draco. “One means you came of your own volition. The other means you were goaded into it, possibly bribed.”
“Harry, I’m not going to tell you what to do with your life. But I will say this. I made it clear I don’t want him around our baby. So, it’s going to be either him, or us.”
“I don’t want to get married because it’s
, to keep from crying. He noticed Harry’s heaving chest, his darkening eyes filled with raw hunger.
Harry cast the coat aside.
“Draco.”
think it’s a waste, because ultimately it’s not what you want. You want stability, and peace, and calm, and I . . . I can’t give that to you.”
“Yeah,” Draco responded, sitting down on the couch, “it was.”
“I’m gonna be a father, did you know that? A real dad. And I’m terrified out of my mind. I don’t know what to do. I’ve always had a plan, had a next-step, but this? This is like veering off the marked trail into the wilderness without so much as a backpack. I feel like I’m going to somehow screw up my child because I’m so screwed up.”
Then she disapparated with a loud pop.
“I can’t play this game with you anymore, Harry.”
“Yes.”
Harry’s come flooded his arse, filling him deep, hot and sticky. Draco nearly collapsed, on the verge of orgasm himself, but then Harry was saying,
“So.”
“It’s when you’re only sexually attracted to someone you have a deep, emotional bond with.”
“Address?” Fuck. Harry hadn’t a clue. He only knew walking directions from the bookshop. “I-I don’t have his address.”
“Too long,” Draco panted, sighing as Harry’s finger crooked inside him.
“Merlin, he must be good in bed.”
“Was I any good?”
Harry responded with a snarl and a particularly ferocious thrust that had Draco writhing and clawing at Harry’s back as a garbled moan escaped his raw throat.
“I forgive you, Potter,” Draco said quietly. “To be fair, I did try to
“Too long,” Potter breathed, leaning in to steal one more quick kiss. “Too long I’ve been wanting to do that.”
“Turns out, we didn’t lose every last cent to war reparations.”
“It’s none of your business,” Draco said sharply.
, how was he already this close?
“Don’t be.” Potter waved it aside as if it meant nothing, which pained Draco. “It was a long time ago. I’m over it now.”
“Well, this is news to me.”
“So,” said Potter, twirling his glass as though it were wine to mix its contents. “I have to tell you, I never thought I’d see the inside of Draco Malfoy’s Muggle flat.”
Once Harry reached Draco’s apartment, he knocked gently. Mind stirring, he wondered how he was going to broach the subject with him. First thing was first: he was going to tell Draco that nothing had happened between him and Ginny.
He wasn’t going to think about that. Not right now.
“Because it isn’t right. This isn’t right. You need to stick to what you said in your letter, Harry. We aren’t right for each other.”
“How’s business been?” he asked casually, as if he and Draco were friends.
“Draco, if you knew what was good for you, you’d let me take you to St. Mungo’s right now.”
“No, it isn’t. We can parent the child separately, Gin. I talked to Hermione all about it.”
it,” said Draco. “I just think my talents would be better suited elsewhere.”
“Oh, please, you always were following him around on that stupid map of yours. You were
Draco’s cock stirred.
“I don’t need your help,” Draco snarled, pushing himself up into a standing position. Immediately he was hit with a spell of dizziness and began to wobble, and Harry was up in an instant to support him as Draco leaned on the Gryffindor, utterly humiliated.
She answered almost immediately.
“Not even if I spread you open and licked you until you were sobbing?” Harry purred filthily, stepping into Draco’s space and rubbing a hand up and down his arm. His sleeves did nothing to shield Draco from the heat of Harry’s touch.
Draco choked on a sob as Harry continued licking and kissing all around his fluttering opening, and when Harry’s tongue finally pierced him he let out a scream.
Was he about to do this?
“What happened, Harry?” Ginny asked. “Why did you miss the sonogram? I deserve to know.”
“Honey, it’s going to be okay,” Harry soothed, moving Draco’s hair out of his face. “Told you I’m gonna take care of you, didn’t I?”
“He scooped me up into his arms, which I found really odd, and I asked him what he was doing. He shushed me, saying that a pretty mouth like mine wasn’t suited for asking questions.”
“Draco?”
“No, it’s not,” said Draco miserably. “Harry, I-”
“Yes?” He blinked rapidly, trying to get rid of them, but it was no use.
Draco chuckled. “Thanks, Pans. That really means a lot.”
“Save it. I’ll firecall you. Or maybe I won’t.”
“H-Harry,” he greeted. “Come in, you must be freezing.”
Harry shrugged. “Because I trust you.”
“Harry, please.” Draco sounded utterly dejected. Why? He was the one kicking
That was . . . A really good point. Perhaps Harry was a smidge more insightful than Draco had given him credit for.
“You’re so damn beautiful, you’re a work of art,” Harry murmured, letting go of his wrists to ease his jacket off his body. Surrendering, Draco allowed him to remove the garment, swallowing a sob as Harry all but yanked his shirt over his head and fastened his lips around one of his pert, little nipples. He gasped, arching his back as Harry sucked on the sensitive body part.
“Good,” exclaimed Ron furiously. “As he should. You seem to forget what he did to my brother, Harry.”
“So.”
“You know,” said Potter, “I actually died. In that forest. I was alive when Hagrid carried me out, but Voldemort did kill me.”
He incinerated that one, too.
inability to manage your emotionally stunted feelings!”
“Because you don’t deserve to shut yourself out. And the longer you wait, the harder it will be to get them back. People don’t stick around forever if you push them away.”
Draco didn’t appreciate the role reversal; normally, he was the one making snide remarks to Harry, but he was too blissed out from the sex to care that much.
Harry furrowed his thick eyebrows. “Do you need any potions? I can run to Diagon and get you some-”
“I’m not your keeper, Draco, but I have my concerns, and I’m going to voice them.”
He could message Potter.
“Draco.”
“You look so pretty like this,” Potter praised him, pushing in his finger deeper which caused Draco to make a strangled sound. “Doing so well for me.”
“Y-You want to date me?” Draco asked.
“Don’t wanna move,” he mumbled.
“I’m glad he took you for a bite-
“Harry, I didn’t know you felt that way. I thought you were tugging him along.”
Draco hadn’t meant for that to slip out. “No reason,” he said. “I just . . . We fought, remember, and I wasn’t in the mood to talk to anybody.”
“What?” Harry was confused now.
“Zabini?”
your fault, Malfoy.” Potter had never sounded so serious, so sure, of anything in his life. Draco was confused. Why was he directing all this passion at him?
“Everything okay?” he asked.
“Erm, Malfoy?” Potter’s voice cut into his dangerous thoughts, and he jumped.
“No.”
Although he lived alone, he felt his cheeks begin to redden in embarrassment. “Yes.”
“Okay. Okay.” She released a deep breath, obviously relieved. “I don’t love the fact that you’re shagging the most hideous bloke I know, but I can get over it as long as he doesn’t come near our baby.”
In between the floor of the hallway and the bathroom lay Draco, face white as snow with his eyes closed.
. I’m content, and that’s all that matters.”
“Or are you just going out of your way to soil my afternoon with your presence?”
Narcissa’s tone was raw, wounded. Harry’s heart ached for her. Not for the first time, he yearned for his own parents.
“W-What the
“Draco, don’t be like that,” scolded Pansy, placing what was supposed to be a comforting hand on Draco’s shoulder. But the gesture just felt stifling. Her manicured nails scratched lightly at the material of his robes. “We’re just trying to talk to you.”
Draco didn’t have the first clue about cars, and frankly, they scared him too much to ever go near them. The idea of handling a machine that had the power to kill you if it hit somebody else was terrifying to say the least. He didn’t understand how they worked, and he wanted nothing to do with them.
rough, “because that’s not going to happen. Not after everything you put me through.”
Draco propped himself up on an elbow, halting the patterns. “Really? Just like that? Was expecting a bit more of a fight out of you, to be honest.”
“So, Potter,” said Draco, setting his menu down. “How’s Granger and Weasley?”
Potter’s lips thinned out to a little crisp. “I’m sorry, Malfoy. It isn’t your fault. It’s just . . . One of my patients died today.”
Soon Draco was buried to the hilt, and he began a slow, steady rhythm, moving his hips in time with Potter’s upward thrusts. With each thrust, Draco’s prostate was brutally hit, and with a particularly savage thrust the men moaned in unison.
He wasn’t sure why he felt such an incessant need to prove to Potter that he was doing fine, that he wasn’t doing humiliating work. But he did. And it bothered him. A lot.
“That’s not why I called you, though.”
“You think nobody cares about you?”
“Your parents are in an abusive relationship. An equal partnership does not function the way you’re telling me your parents do.”
Draco had to have misheard her.
“You what?”
“I could say it’s equally preposterous to blame yourself for someone else hurting you, but I wouldn’t want to overstep my boundaries.”
“Yes.”
Thank you to everyone so far who has commented on my work. It means the world to me, and I appreciate it more than anything. I check my inbox religiously, it's actually sort of a problem . . . Well, anyways, without any further ado, here's the chapter :)
“Okay,” he said. “I understand.”
This was not good. This was not good at all.
“He threatened you with your family.”
“Why are you telling me all this?” Draco asked, and he sounded on the verge of tears. “Why do you even care?”
Pansy would move on. He dragged her down, anyway.
“Okay,” said Harry, air leaving him in a big whoosh. “Okay.”
“Fuck,
Potter’s eyebrows raised. “How do
“Please,” Draco wailed. “Fill me up.”
“Mother, you’re lying. Tell me you’re lying.”
“Blimey, Harry, I forget how funny you can be sometimes.”
“Real mature of you.”
you?”
“No, really. That was insensitive of me. I’m sorry.”
“He swallowed an entire bottle of Advil,” said Harry to the medics.
“Ronald, please try to be mature about this,” Hermione pleaded. Ron rounded on his wife.
“You’re right,” he said, and her eyes widened.
All at once, he was overwhelmed by the amount of memories involving Voldemort. The torturing, both to Draco and to others, the maniacal laughter, the sleepless nights spent hurling over a toilet, missing Mother . . . Harry felt it all.
He sensed Harry’s grin. “These are almost done,” the Gryffindor said. “Would you mind grabbing us plates? Second cupboard from the left.”
“I know it’s risky, and it could fracture everything we have, but I feel like it’s the right thing to do.”
“And why’s that?” asked Draco. “You made it quite clear how you feel about me, telling me I’m just a fuck and nothing more.”
But, he rationalized, Draco was a rather complex person.
“I know you don’t want me to stop, darling,” said Harry soothingly. “You’re just overwhelmed, and that’s okay.”
“We, erm, did have a relationship, of sorts. A sexual one.”
Harry buried his face into Draco’s neck, breathing in his scent as a large hand wrapped around his weeping cock. He pumped once, then twice, then two lubed, determined fingers worked their way into his rosy pucker.
“Well . . . It’s him.”
“Yes.” Draco shuddered as Potter lightly scratched the inside of his thigh, a highly sensitive area for him as the skin was incredibly soft to the touch.
“What about LSD?”
“No,” Harry said. “I think I need to go it alone.”
Ron didn’t move for a solid five seconds. Then, he was laughing. Loudly, and obnoxiously, tossing his head back and wheezing.
“You most certainly do,” said Mother, reeling him back to reality.
“Silly me. That must make it okay!”
“I . . . I just want you to know, Narcissa, that he’s going to be okay. I’m going to help him in any way I can.”
“Draco . . . You can’t be with him, not after what he did to you. You need to focus on getting better. On yourself.”
Draco chuckled as he took another sip of his alcohol. “Most definitely. It would’ve been a stinging hex or something equally nasty.”
“What is it?” Ginny asked, concerned, squeezing Harry’s hand. But Harry let her go, opting instead to run both his hands through his thick, black curls.
“You’ve done enough.” Narcissa stood up. “You will not drag Draco along any longer than you already have, am I understood?”
“Incase you’re forgetting, he stalked you for an entire year,” said Pansy. “That’s gotta mean something.”
They appeared in an alleyway, and Draco took Potter’s lead as they began walking toward their destination. Draco let go of Potter’s arm, but he was very aware that their shoulders were touching.
“No one, Gin, just give me one moment-”
Draco’s eyes were watering, much to his dismay. That was exactly what Mother had told him. “I . . . I don’t know if I can-”
He had to apparate them to St. Mungo’s.
“I also quit,” Harry reminded him. “That probably helped.”
“I’m sorry,
“I know you’re sensitive, love, but we gotta make sure you’re all nice and clean,” Harry told him.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said as evenly as he could, downing the rest of his drink and allowing the sensation of the alcohol to wash over him. He was definitely tipsy now.
“So you
“Right there, Harry-”
“Well, then, Harry Potter, would you like to go out on a date with me? Let me take you out? I can show you a great time.”
“Okay,” Draco said. As if on cue, his stomach gave an angry rumble. He had been in a hurry this morning since he’d nearly slept through his alarm, so he hadn’t made himself breakfast.
Potter flirting back with him rustled something deep within Draco, something that had been left dormant for many years, and it was like poking a sleeping dragon. Now it was stirring, and soon it would fully awaken, ravenous and all-consuming.
Draco didn’t even bother stopping to tell her that it wasn’t a choice.
“He tried to kill himself.”
. We’re here for one reason, aren’t we? We’re gonna do this right. No feelings.”
The first time Harry owled Narcissa, he received no response.
“It wasn’t a good time, Pans. I have
Draco hissed as a third finger breached him, stretching him wider and coaxing out another lewd moan.
“For Mrs. Malfoy, and Mister Harry Potter, sir.”
Pansy, having knowledge that the rest of them did not, fixed him with a long, hard look. “You know, Draco, there’s ways to remedy this situation. Ways that do not involve being a total and utter prat to him all the time.”
“Potter,” she greeted, as she shrugged off her coat and adjusted her ivory scarf.
That was Ginny.
, Harry?”
Draco scoffed bitterly. “Did you not see the way I boasted about it in sixth year to anyone who would listen? How
It happened suddenly. So swiftly, Harry nearly missed it.
“Because I don’t want to bother her with my- Because she’s busy,” Draco amended, though the damage had already been done.
Sleeping next to someone else was a very intimate thing to do, something Draco reserved for only those he had formed a deep emotional bond with. Sleep, to him, was even more sacred than sex.
Now he was naked as the day he was born before Draco, and he was
“Oh yeah? What if I asked you to marry me?”
“Potter-”
“Come for me. Come all over this table.”
Mother only looked at him sadly, which pinched Draco’s chest uncomfortably.
Draco gave Cindy a curt nod before entering his room, and she left him to his own devices. He wasn’t tired, not even close; in fact, he was antsy and full of energy. He needed to get
Warning: All explicit sexual activity is consensual, but Draco's state of mind isn't exactly healthy
He failed to mention that Draco currently wanted nothing to do with him, and the likelihood of a conversation about his mother going favorably was slim to none. But Narcissa had sounded so sad, and Harry wanted to make her feel better. And who knew? If Draco ever let him in again, Harry could try it.
“Well,” said Harry, scratching his head, “I was going to ask you if you’d ever feel comfortable using Legilimency in a . . . erm, sexual setting.”
“I don’t care, Harry. People don’t change- not him, anyways. He permanently maimed my brother’s face, and Fred’s
“Alright, then,” she said, making to sit down in Harry’s chair. Draco instinctively shrank away from her.
Draco sighed, feeling himself age with the very coals in his firepit.
“You’re forgiven, Draco,” Hermione said softly. “You’re forgiven.”
Ron scoffed. “Then I’ll learn to tolerate them. As long as it isn’t Brighton . . . That scum. I’m surprised the Department even let him apply.”
“How are your symptoms in your day-to-day life? What are they, and how do they affect you emotionally?”
Narcissa chuckled. “Draco can be awfully prickly at times, but his heart is soft. Well guarded. Those he lets in get to see a side of him he rarely shows otherwise.”
He had a chance to tell Harry he loved him back. Harry might not take it well; he might tell Draco that he was too late. But Draco had to at least try.
“You don’t have to answer if you aren’t comfortable,” Harry said. “But after the war I started taking Occlumency lessons, practical ones, and I realized that if I wanted to master Occlumency, then I wanted to master Legilimency, too. So I took lessons for both.”
Potter looked at him seriously. “Then I’ll take as many as you can give me.”
“Maybe I should go,” said Harry quietly, standing up from his kneeling position. Draco followed suit.
After what felt like both a nanosecond and an eternity Potter moved away from him again and back into his own space. Draco could breathe normally again, and he didn’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed.
Harry asked. “You can’t possibly be serious.”
Draco couldn’t suppress the smile that formed on his face. “I’d really like that. Let me lock up.”
“Because it’s true?” Draco tried.
Draco nodded.
“Draco?”
“That’s too bad,” Draco spat, throwing Harry’s words right back in his face.
Parkinson nodded, looking Harry deep in the eye. “Be careful with him, alright?” she said as she rose and grabbed her coat she’d carelessly strewn across the back of the sofa.
“I . . . What I mean to say is, I know you heard it from Pansy, but I want you to hear it from me. I . . .” Draco drew a deep, shuddering breath. This was it. “I love you, Harry.”
“Draco.” The word was spoken with such soft fervor, and Potter leaned in to nip Draco’s lip.
“Hey, contrary to popular belief, I don’t entirely hate Muggles,” Draco said, somewhat defensively, though he knew it wasn’t fair. Potter was only teasing. “I find their literature to be . . . Quite stimulating.”
They disapparated with a loud crack, landing a few blocks away from Draco’s flat. Then they resumed walking.
Harry smiled. “I know we said nothing else can happen, and I’m okay with that,” he said. “But I’d really like to hold your hand and take a walk with you. If you’d like. And only if you like.”
“I didn’t know you liked to read,” said Potter.
Potter shook his head. “You don’t sound like you mean it.”
made of glass, so why was Potter treating him like he was?
Draco walked over to him, wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, and kissed him deeply. Then he pulled away, eyes flashing with mirth. “I had a feeling she’d cave, knowing how happy you make me.”
Draco felt something warm spread through his sternum. The idea of Potter paying for his meal, like this was an actual
Harry reeled back as though he’d been slapped. “If that’s how you really feel about all this, then maybe I should just go.”
“Narcissa . . .”
Potter pulled away from him before Draco had the chance to deepen the kiss and find out. A little whine bubbled up from the back of his throat.
Harry was emotionally attracted to him. Draco felt like he was sitting on a cloud. He beamed radiently. “Harry, that’s . . . I’m so glad you aren’t cross with me for not telling.”
“Okay, well, that wraps us up here for now,” said Annie, standing up. “That wasn’t so bad, was it?”
Once he had stepped into the shower and turned the water on as hot as it would go, he reached for the tiny plastic container of shampoo and began lathering his hair. To his annoyance, he heard a door creak open and footsteps.
“Just because I enjoy reading doesn’t mean I want to spend my life in a book shop, Harry.”
“I’d play with your balls until they were bulging and purple, filled with your hot, sticky come that you love to release down my throat. But you’re not coming yet. I haven’t even touched you yet.”
Draco seemed to curl in on himself the smallest amount, but Harry noticed.
Potter frowned at him. “What makes you say that? Is fourteen years not enough time for you?”
“He what?” Potter asked, that edge even stronger and honed than before. “Malfoy, what did he do?”
Parkinson immediately looked like she regretted every decision she’d ever made on this earth. “Oh god . . .”
“You’re my son. I forgave you before you even did it.”
Draco kicked the sheets off himself, swung out of bed, and as he walked across the hallway to the staircase, the aroma of fresh, sizzling bacon hit his nostrils.
“Right,” said Ron, though he sounded about as confident as Harry felt during his first match of Quidditch.
want to get your hands all over me?”
Harry asked.
When Draco emerged in the kitchen, he flashed a smile at Harry, who was in a red and black checkered robe flipping strips of bacon in one skillet and frying eggs in the next.
“Oh, I would. If that’s what it takes to get you the help you need.”
Pansy had held him the other night for what felt like hours, but her touches did nothing to balm his wounds. He was cut wide open, and an insatiable infection was spreading through his veins.
They didn’t talk about the hand-holding that went on at the pub, and it was about to drive Draco
It was three weeks before Harry came to see Draco in the shop again. This time, it was busy and bustling, and it took a while before Harry was able to pull Draco aside.
Draco drew a breath.
“So talking to him was nice?”
“Alright,” Draco said softly, curiosity blooming inside him like a flower. “Tell me.”
Harry reeled back, jaw going slack. “I had
“You don’t get to tell me to listen when you . . . You . . .” Draco cut himself off as he gasped for air, frustrated with himself for being unable to conjure an adequate accusation for Harry’s meddling.
“Everything’s obvious in hindsight,” said Potter.
“Do you see how that’s a problem?”
“He’s not good for you, darling. He doesn’t seem to know what he wants, and it’s incredibly unfair of him to drag you along. Especially with the baby.”
“Why not?” Annie pressed.
“Harry,” he breathed, reaching for him, needing him closer,
“Wouldn’t ever expect it,” Harry said with a smile. “Like I told you before, you’re it for me, Draco. I’m not going anywhere. I want- no, I need- for you to take as long as you like in deciding where you want to proceed from here.”
“I’m demisexual,” Draco said, instantly avoiding eye contact in favor of staring at his half-eaten eggs.
Ginny looked affronted, and Harry realized his mistake. “Excuse me?”
“Draco?”
“Draco, I-”
Draco figured he would rest here, just for a moment. It was where he belonged, after all.
“Don’t be absurd.”
Oh, god, that
“You have to tell him,” Pansy said, piercing the peaceful silence like a dagger. “This isn’t good for you, Draco.”
“This is
“I’m sorry,” Draco mumbled to his lap, then made eye contact with Potter. “We don’t have to talk about the war. Rather unappetizing, if you ask me. I’m sorry.”
“Well, it certainly does,” said Draco. “But, Harry . . . I think I need some time to think. About this.”
“Fuck!” Draco cried out, panting heavily.
Finally, after almost two minutes of no response, Draco answered the door.
“You think I cut you open on purpose,” Harry breathed out in shock, as memories of Draco sobbing in the bathroom, lying down on the floor welcoming death, and waking back up in the hospital disappointed flooded the forefront of his mind.
Harry had just descended the stairs before realization hit him with the force of an angry bludger.
“I just . . . He doesn’t want to see me right now. We got in a row. But I have a feeling he wouldn’t turn you away.”
“S-So you want to go for a meal. With me,” Draco clarified, willing for his head to remain attached to his body.
Draco, antsy as ever to make sure everything was okay, was the first to break the comfortable silence.
But he decided against telling Ginny that and making her more distressed.
“Don’t say that. I’m responsible for you. If you aren’t doing well, it’s a reflection of my parenting. We did you so wrong, Draco. So wrong. And you . . .” She paused for a moment to compose herself, drawing in a deep breath. “I see how much you’ve changed since the war. That was all your own doing. I love you so much. I just want you to be happy.”
“I thought you were just shagging him; I didn’t know you were in love,” Ron said meekly.
But when it came to Draco, he gave into his urges far too often. It was time to do the practical thing for once.
“They’re obviously too afraid to confront you head on,” said Ron. “But I think you should let this thing play out. Should be interesting.”
“When was the first time you self-harmed?” she asked gently.
to eat it, if you’ll let me,” Draco snapped back.
him yet.
not to bring a blade to your arm.”
Startled, Draco fumbled with a ladle and set it down in the cauldron. He walked out from the back of his shop, and sure enough Harry was standing just within the frame of his door.
Draco clutched his stomach and breathed heavily through his mouth as more cramps tore through him one by one, each more brutal than the last. His breathing began to slow. It was starting.
“I dunno how to feel,” Draco responded truthfully. “He’s my father, and I love him, but . . . A part of me is really glad he’s gone, because he hurt me so much.”
“It’s so I know when to come over; not everything is about you,” she teased.
No sooner than he spoke did someone knock on his door.
Draco shook his head.
“Do you want me to stop?”
“It’s getting late,” Draco blurted out, unsure why he was clamming up when all Potter was doing was checking in with him, but something about the situation didn’t sit quite right with him. He
Pansy bit her lip, looking away.
“But, Draco-”
Harry frowned. “You want me gone?”
Annie’s eyes had widened, but only slightly. “Your father’s in prison? What for?”
“He trusts me?” Harry asked in disbelief.
Draco smiled softly at him, rocking back on the balls of his feet. Had he always looked so radiant, and glowing? Certainly not. This must be a new development.
“It feels . . . Overwhelming. You have so much going on in here.”
“Draco?”
“How did you come into contact with my son?” Narcissa asked.
“So do I.”
“You . . . You can’t just throw an ultimatum on me like that.” Harry frustratedly adjusted the collar of his shirt. He was so exhausted from this god forsakenly horrible evening.
Draco flinched. Images of cruel, maniacal laughter, screams of Muggleborns writhing in agony on the cold, hard floor of the manor, red slits for eyes boring into his very soul, breaking down his Occlumency shields one by one . . .
“I both can and can’t believe you’ve never had a hamburger before,” Potter said, which earned him a playful whack on the arm.
“What about Parkinson?” he asked.
“I suppose I have to,” said Harry. He hadn’t even thought of that.
“Draco, what was-”
Somewhere in the back of his head, something along the lines of
“Harry Potter stopped by the other day,” she said.
mad at you.”
“You just . . . And we’re . . . I don’t want . . .” Potter sighed again, raking a hand through his dark curls. He looked so endearingly distressed on Draco’s behalf it was cute. “I don’t want to take advantage of you.”
Draco had to have misheard him.
“M-More, Harry, please.”
Merlin, he was good.
Saying
Draco did
Potter would always give him dirty looks in the halls, would always roll his eyes whenever Draco shouted something at him. Albeit, the things Draco shouted wouldn’t always be very nice, but Potter seemed to be annoyed by more than just his words. He seemed to be annoyed by Draco’s mere
Was seven a good time to firecall Harry? It was a Friday, after all, so he might be going to grab a pint with his friends or old coworkers. Draco’s mind dwelled on all the worst-case scenarios it possibly could.
I have no power. They don’t want me; I’m exiled.”
“Thanks,” Harry said, tossing him a smile.
you?” Potter repeated, sounding absolutely disgusted.
out that night I asked you to stay over and you know it. You self-destruct because you are so torn between wanting to come back to our world and wanting to stay here and rot away that it’s killing you. You used me just as much as I used you, and I’ll tell you what isn’t fair. Only pointing the blame one way.”
“Before I touch you here,” he said, squeezing Draco’s arse before moving his hand away to safer terrain, “I’d touch your cock. I’d pump you just the way you like, nice and hard, before I blow you so well your legs are shaking and your toes are curling.”
Draco felt a squeezing sensation in his sternum. Potter would never,
“So tight, Draco, always so fucking
They rearranged themselves so Potter was sitting on the sofa, knees spread. Draco climbed into his lap, and instantly Potter’s hands were trailing up and down his waist, softly thumbing the skin.
Ropes of white hot come spurted from his aching cock, as dizzying pleasure surged through his spine. His orgasm lasted for several seconds, longer than normal. When he came back to earth, panting, he turned around to see Harry smiling softly at him.
Draco found himself worrying so much for Potter that he ironically felt the need to take his own Draught of Peace.
“Clearly, you do.”
place revealing my secret like that. Why were you even talking to him in the first place?”
Next was his hair. He spelled it dry, then combed it until it fell as desired around his ears. Now he was ready to go.
“So let’s talk about it, then,” Draco said, taking another sip of his cup and letting the steaming hot liquid coat his tongue and run down the back of his throat.
“I’m terrified, Pans.”
“Seriously, Harry, what’s the big deal? As far as I know, you’re only shagging; it’s not like you’re in love with the bastard. So out with it!”
“Draco, I want to break the rules tonight. I’d like to talk to you, if you’re okay with that.”
to initiate contact with him,” he argued weakly. “It’s that I don’t think I’d be able to stop.”
be here for you. I will never abandon you again.”
“Draco-”
Nausea swam through Draco as he thought about Harry and that red-headed Weasel together, their bodies pressed close, tongues dancing together the same way theirs had.
Draco sighed. “I have for a while now.”
“It’s not like we have an audience.”
More sexual memories and preferences and thoughts flooded Harry’s mind.
Draco instantly shook his head. “Not in the slightest. How could I ever? He’s . . . He’s
“How so?”
Draco was quick to assure her that she made plenty of sense and that she was also full of nonsense; Ron would love the name.
He felt a prick in his forearm, and looked up at his nurse to see her pull the empty syringe out of his skin.
“But I miss you,” Pansy said forlornly. “Your mother misses you. Narcissa and I write all the time about you; you don’t visit her enough. Blaise even misses you. I know things would be incredibly difficult at first, and you’ll probably get like ten no’s before a single yes, but don’t you want to at least try?”
“How does it feel?” Draco asked him quietly, scooting closer. Harry squeezed his hands.
Now it was just Draco and Hermione, and Draco was anxious. To say the least.
“Hey, this isn’t a competition about who has it worse, alright?” Potter said, sounding slightly agitated. Draco’s chest squeezed again for having instilled that emotion in him.
“Love it when you finger me,” Draco said, and Harry felt a surge of fondness for the man beneath him. “Make me feel so good, getting me nice and ready for your big, fat cock-”
of here. But he didn’t want to be in the open room with all the other patients, watching the telly and mindlessly scribbling away at their coloring pages, docile as lambs. He wanted privacy. So he got under the covers and closed his eyes, allowing his thoughts to drift off.
The idea of Harry tasting himself while eating him out was insurmountably hot, and it was everything Draco could do not to come on the spot, completely untouched.
“Just because I’ve let you into my bed doesn’t mean you know me,” said Draco, and the words
Harry sighed. “I have no right unloading this on you. I’m supposed to stay away from you.”
“Draco?” she asked, sounding worried.
“Well, Harry, you wandered into my shop. Certainly for a reason, am I wrong?”
Christmas Day at the Weasleys, however, was an entirely different affair. He and Ginny had finally made up- she had apologized for attempting to take his unborn child away from him, and told him that although she didn’t see herself ever being Draco’s biggest fan, that she’d accept him because she knew he made Harry happy.
Draco didn’t want to think about that awful, awful day. When he’d sank to the wet
“Sure I do,” said Draco. “I know you have really bad nightmares, and I don’t want to be the cause of that. I’ve done enough damage in the war. Surely you can let me have this one good thing?”
“It can be,” he said, emptying three vials into a paper bag like usual.
“You know, I also like men, and only men,” he said. Potter’s eyes widened fractionally, but he said nothing.
“Are you with me?” Potter asked him quietly. “You looked . . . Far away for a second.”
Draco hadn’t brought it back up because he was afraid that he and Potter wanted different things- Draco couldn’t have a sexual relationship, and wasn't emotionally capable of one. If that was all Potter wanted, he didn’t know if he could handle that rejection. He also didn’t want to lose Potter as a friend, so he’d decided the best course of action was to shutter up and avoid the topic altogether.
“This. Us. The bantering.” Draco suddenly didn’t know what to do with his hands. Harry was looking at him far too intensely. “Everything got so . . . so serious with us when we started . . .
Harry looked sheepish. His hand was still on Draco’s wrist, drawing the patterns. “I wanted to break the rules, just for today.”
The laughter abruptly stopped. Ron furrowed his brows as though he were reading through a particularly nasty case. “What?”
Potter’s tone was equal parts curious and apprehensive.
“Oh.” Potter scratched his head awkwardly. Then he said, “Thanks for the potions, Malfoy.” And he was leaving. Draco watched him walk out of the store, listening to the bell jingle over the door frame.
That hopefulness he wore faded like a dream.
Harry was only human; the words had quite an effect on him. The image of Draco on his knees, sucking Harry dry was lewd and . . . enthralling, to say the least. Harry nearly shuddered from the force of it. But he refrained, because when he looked into Draco’s eyes he saw something else that didn’t quite match his tone.
Draco looked up at him in fear. “W-What did she tell you?”
A not entirely uncomfortable moment of silence stretched between them before Draco cleared his throat, startling Harry out of his trance.
Harry had attempted to firecall him several times the first few days after the incident, but Draco had blocked them all. He also sent Draco a letter, which Draco burned before reading. After that, he stopped trying, and Draco was on his own.
“Oh! Right.” Draco sheepishly let go of Harry’s hands, which sent Harry chuckling while he fetched his wand from his bedside drawer.
Sure enough, a tall, now-less thin blonde with stormy grey eyes and elegant, pointy features emerged into view carrying a clipboard of paperwork tucked under his arm. He wore a set of finely tailored robes, instead of those god-awful Muggle clothes that he’d practically swum in.
The talking, and the continuous battering of his prostate was all too much for Draco. He came with a whimper, shaking and tearing up. Ropes of white-hot come spurted out of his cock, all over his stomach and Harry’s large hand.
Breathless, Potter looked at him, black hair hanging down. He looked like a Greek God, and Draco shivered with anticipation.
“Really, Harry? You come into my home, and accuse me of wanting to h-hurt myself? What a preposterous accusation.”
Harry rolled out of bed and walked over to the bathroom, where he turned on the water and lit a candle to set the ambiance. He hummed an off-key tune to himself as the water began to fill, and he lined up all of Draco’s favorite soaps and scrubs, along with his shampoo.
to.” Pansy was looking at him, then, hard, and Draco didn’t know whether he wanted to shy away or get all up in her face and tell her to stop
“Y-You called me Draco,” he said quietly, feeling a swarm of happiness buzz inside him.
“I know,” Potter said as Draco handed him his change. “I was only wondering. So . . . Do you work here a lot, or do you have another job elsewhere?”
“Okay,” Potter said. “I must have misunderstood your question. I’m sorry.”
Draco could only nod. He couldn’t find it in himself to be happy for Annie’s kid.
“Nothing,” said Harry, feeling very far away all of a sudden.
Now was the part where Draco didn’t know how to act. He never spent the night after sex; he always apparated home. They also never fucked in the middle of the day, so this was uncharted territory.
“More rewarding than selling, that’s for sure,” Draco said jokingly, but Potter frowned at him and stopped in his tracks.
Draco visibly deflated, resting his head on top of Harry’s chest. “I know.”
“I know how to set boundaries,” said Draco.
“But I want to figure out who it is,” said Harry. “I already blocked my pathway to anyone I don’t know personally, and that narrows down the possible choices considerably. I just want to know who is going out of their way to talk to me.”
“It really isn’t fair how much I want things to go back to normal,” said Draco. “But I made myself a promise. And my Mother would never forgive me, but that’s neither here nor there.”
Harry couldn’t suppress the large smile forming on his face. “That’s . . . I’m really glad to hear that.”
He tried to hurry in the shower, but it still took him longer than expected to clean himself and wash his hair. He fussed over what he should wear, and eventually settled on a white dress shirt and grey trousers that hugged his figure quite nicely. He knew he wasn’t going out on a
“Really?” asked Harry, afraid that Ginny would have manipulated the Weasleys into taking her side and villainizing him.
“You let him fuck you at work?”
Draco silently crumbled apart in her arms.
Theo nodded. “That tosser doesn’t know what he’s missing out on.”
“You’re right. I’m sorry, Malfoy.”
Harry's gotten himself into quite a situation, hasn't he?
Potter cocked an eyebrow at him, staring at him as though he were a curious specimen. “Yeah, I do.”
what he was like.”
“F-For a while?” A stunned Draco was cute, really, but Harry was gonna need him to say something soon before he started panicking.
“Usually trust comes with . . . Other things,” said Draco, as a replacement for the words,
Harry soaked in Draco’s messed up hair from their earlier snogging session, his pale cheeks tinged pink, sparkling grey eyes full of life. He was walking art, golden, angelic, and it was
came along and ruined everything.”
Then he did another. And another. And another.
“Never done one of those, either.”
“Really?” Draco asked, heart soaring to hear that Potter was no longer involved with her. “That’s great.”
“I just can’t help but wonder . . . Why? Why have you isolated yourself?”
“We’ve had this conversation before.”
He considered Harry’s words. He said it would feel nothing like what he’d experienced with the Dark Lord. But nonetheless, letting someone into your head was an incredibly intimate thing. Draco would have to trust Harry to the end of the world in order to allow him to do that.
“Hey,” Harry said softly. “It’s nothing to be embarrassed about. I like it, too, you know.”
“What saving-people thing?” Harry asked.
Draco’s lip wobbled as he brought the blade to his skin again and tore up more flesh, scraping and cutting and demolishing like a bulldozer to a building.
“Not everyone gets to have their dream job, Harry. I worked hard to establish a good name for myself here, and people like me. It’s enough.”
Draco led him over to the same area of the store he had last time and plucked one of the units from the shelves, handing it to Harry.
“Your angle. Your intentions. Your game. Take your pick.” Draco nonetheless stepped aside to let Harry in from the cold. He shrugged off his coat and hung it up.
“I only work here, remember?” he asked with a slight bite to his tone as he recorded Potter’s items one by one before placing them back in the bag. He told Potter the total amount, and Potter paid him.
“He’ll never want me back.”
“So much,” agreed Narcissa. “I spent so long neglecting to show him I loved him, and now he’s pushing me away. I also think I remind him of everything that happened here. I can see it in his eyes, when he looks at me. I only want to spend the rest of my life proving how much he means to me, but he never responds to my letters.”
. I can’t do this.
Draco choked out. “Please, put your mouth on me. Please.”
“Who are you and what have you done with Draco Malfoy?”
Concern began to grow inside him like a tumor.
Draco was grateful for the words of support, although he had the smallest feeling they were empty. His friends knew there wasn’t anything that could be done; it wasn’t like he could force Potter to interact with him. Potter avoided him like the plague.
“Tell me,” Draco breathed, positioning himself halfway on top of Harry’s chest, resuming the patterns. “Tell me what you’d do to me.”
“They have so much history,” Pansy said. “They were Hogwarts sweethearts.”
“I was hoping that wouldn’t come up right away,” Harry said somewhat sheepishly. “That was incredibly manipulative of me, and I’m very sorry.”
Draco, as much as he didn’t want to, slowly slid his hand away. Touching was dangerous. Touching led to other things. Touching led to-
“Ohhh, Harry,” moaned Draco, throwing his head back as complete and utter ecstasy overtook him at the feeling of being so utterly filled, so thoroughly fucked.
“I love you, you know,” Draco murmured into Harry’s collarbone.
Draco shrugged. “I honestly wasn’t that good until you. You’re the biggest bloke I’ve ever sucked.”
He repeated the words to himself in his head like a mantra as blood began dripping off his skin and into the sink. Pansy’s harsh words echoed in his head, how no one would ever want him and how he was fooling himself by believing Harry would ever want anything more to do with him than sex.
“Harry stopped by tonight, after I firecalled him,” said Draco, certain why the only reason he wasn’t a sobbing heap on the floor was because he was still in shock, “and you won’t believe what happened.”
“Look at you,” Potter said, panting hard as he slowed his thrusts and braced his hands over Draco. He leaned down and kissed Draco, and Draco sighed into his mouth.
Draco watched, helpless to escape, as Harry shot up and rapidly moved his head back and forth, as though assessing the room for danger.
“Oh, I know exactly what he did to you, you dramatic tit. He scratched your arm the tiniest amount. And that was only because you approached him, all haughty and mighty on your high horse, without bowing.”
Harry’s mouth plopped open.
“What on earth are you sorry for?” Potter asked, and he sounded so worried that Draco wanted to reach out and hold his hand and console him that he had nothing to worry about. Which, of course, would be a lie, but Draco wanted to do it anyway.
Potter sighed. “Would it help if I told you something I still think is my fault, even though I know it’s not?”
Draco wanted to shrink into the couch and never come out. He would never be as strong, brave, or assertive as Potter.
And oh, it was so much
“Ginny, I care about you a lot,” he said, standing aside from the door frame to let her in. Ginny slowly walked into the house, keeping her eyes on Harry. “But-”
Harry felt his cheeks begin to colour. He most certainly was not flirting with whoever this messenger person was, especially not if they were a man!
“I just wanted to let you know that . . . It’s, erm, been a while for me, and I just- I just wanted to tell you that.”
So then where was Harry?
“Nameless faces you’ll never see again.”
Parkinson’s eyes hardened. “That’s personal.”
“I’d like to change that,” he said, and Draco fought to keep himself composed.
There was a not totally awkward moment of silence, and then,
So Draco succumbed to the growing agony in his stomach that made him feel like he was going to explode. He cried out in pain as a particularly fierce cramp throbbed through him. This process wasn’t going to be instant and painless like he’d thought it would be. He was so, so naive.
Draco white-knuckled the creaking and shaking table, and books rained down to the ground as Harry continued to fuck him at a brutal pace. All Draco could do was lie there and take it, burn in his arse be damned.
It was exhilarating.
“No milk? That’s barbaric.”
Draco shook his head.
“Yes.”
Draco nodded.
“The answer is no.”
“Draco, have you eaten today?”
Narcissa looked like she was going to be sick. “Harry, you need to leave.”
Harry sighed, shoulders sagging. He looked down at his breakfast, took a sip of coffee, then put the cup down. Then he looked back up at Draco.
“You don’t know that,” Harry said limply.
“You gotta tell us who your soulmate is,” said Blaise.
Draco’s hands shook. “It was fine,” he said shortly. “They’re gonna get married, eventually. He always goes back to her.”
And oh, how Draco wanted to
“Fuck,
“Anything but that!” Hermione cried. “There were a
, and Harry didn’t think he could hold on much longer.
“Thank you,” Harry said as they made their way into the living room. Harry set the cup down on Draco’s coffee table next to Draco’s own cup.
Draco deadpanned him. “With inventory.”
“I could stay like this forever,” he said.
“No, Harry,
want to have this conversation, not here of all places. Conversations about the war usually led to an attack, and attacks weren’t ideal in public settings. But he couldn’t leave Potter’s question hanging, so he decided to bite the bullet and answer him.
Potter responded fervently, hands sliding up in Draco’s hair. They caressed and pulled softly, and Draco found himself moaning into the kiss. Unsure of what to do with his hands, they found solace on Potter’s shoulders- That was all they
“I didn’t ask if you hated it,” said Harry. “I’m sure it’s fine work. I asked if you’re happy.”
When Harry washed between his arse-cheeks, Draco made an undignified squeal that Harry found downright adorable and squirmed.
“Draco, I said it was a long time ago,” said Harry, tone clipped. “Can we drop it now, please?”
Potter chuckled. “Yes. I mean, unless of course, you don’t want to go . . .”
“Yeah, I think that’d be best.”
Shocked and hurt, Draco white-knuckled a book with shaking hands.
To Draco’s utter horror, he
“Mrs. Malfoy, I swear to you,” said Harry. “I will never, ever hurt him again.”
“Actually, no,” Draco answered. “I told him how I befriended a Muggle gentleman at a gay bar who helped me form my resume so I could apply to the bookshop. He was curious as to how I’d so successfully ostracized myself, you see.”
If Father had been here, he would have slapped Draco square across the face for talking to Mother like that. But Mother only sighed agitatedly, running a hand through her long, blonde hair.
Ron scoffed. “At least he’s worth
Draco crumpled up the letter before incinerating it.
“I’ll go talk to Debbie, and we’ll work on getting you transferred to the psychiatric unit, okay?”
He didn’t feel like one when he asked if Draco wanted to stay the night.
“Please fuck me,” Draco pleaded, words so quiet they were nearly silent.
“I know what I want.”
“So what are you going to do about Malfoy?” Ron asked. “Are you going to write to his mother?”
“Why not?” Harry asked.
Potter smiled, properly this time, and Draco wanted to melt. “Rose.”
“Am I supposed to know who Molly is?” Draco asked.
Draco instantly reacted like a dog to a bell, wrapping a hand around his soaked cock. He began stroking himself up and down, up and down, until Harry’s hand came down on top of his and began stroking him harder.
When Potter released a low moan and began peppering hot kisses across his lips and made his way down his jaw toward his neck, Draco arched his back and very nearly mewled. The hands encircled his waist, pulling him flush to Potter’s chest, and Potter began to lean forward, easing Draco back against the sofa.
Draco decided to vocalize as much. “You don’t know that.”
“I-I’ve got to go,” Draco stammered, sitting up and fishing for his clothes scattered about on the carpet.
She spoke to him like he was five years old. It made him want to vomit.
“There’s nothing they can do to hurt me,” Harry said, thinking back to when the messenger had said that they hadn’t wanted to hurt him. He knew better than to take those words completely at face value, but there was something about the way that message had come across that made Harry feel safe.
“And lose out on the long line of people just waiting to come in?”
Draco knew he was being modest. Healing was one of the most rewarding jobs in the wizarding world, and everybody knew it. Few had the precise combination of skills and patience necessary to complete it.
Harry sank into a chair in the waiting room and let grief finally overcome him.
“Mmmm,” Draco managed to get out as Potter matched his rhythm, wrapping his arms around Draco and pulling him flush to his chest.
“Draco-”
. I like taking that sweet, juicy arse bent over for me. Knowing that all it takes is a few soft touches and you’ll fall to putty right in my hands. Do you like that, Draco? I think you do.”
“Ginny, I loved you.”
“Don’t you
Draco shook his head. “There’s no point, Pans,” he said softly. Then, resigned, he decided to reveal the truth to everybody, having already been so humiliated that it was impossible to feel even worse.
“Draco,
“I’m not going to unlearn it in one day,” Draco said softly.
Harry nodded. “That would be lovely.”
“I’m just not feeling well,” Draco said, and it wasn’t really a lie.
“I don’t need you to check up on me like a little kid.”
“Not the way you obsessed after him. It may not have felt like love, but you must have been in such deep denial the emotion was twisted a thousand different ways. You didn’t love me the way you lusted after him.”
“I quit the Aurors,” Harry blurted out, and that was unexpected. Not that Harry had quit; that he’d told Draco.
“What did you say to him?” asked Hermione.
Draco nodded before he could stop himself, and Potter’s hands and lips were back on him before he could even breathe. This time, Draco opened his mouth and prodded his tongue at Potter’s lips, asking for entry. Potter eagerly granted it, and Draco took his time exploring every nook and cranny of Potter’s mouth, just like he’d dreamt about. Potter wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist and pulled him flush to his chest, splaying his fingers out across his lower back. Draco sighed into Potter’s mouth as Potter began fighting back into the kiss, and began kissing Draco with more ferocity, with more hunger, like how he wanted to be kissed.
“What sort of work do you do?”
The words sliced deep. Because Draco knew that for himself, there’d be no one else. But as for Harry, he didn’t mean what he said. He’d eventually get sick of waiting for Draco and move on, find some respectable witch or wizard who wasn’t a Death Eater-
“Do you see why I have a hard time believing you?” Harry asked him, still holding onto him, walking him over to the reading area. “Here, you should probably sit.”
“It can be hard to make boundaries with those we love,” said Annie. “That’s something you can work on in therapy.”
“Well, not that I don’t love being the damsel,” Draco said, attempting to make light of the situation so he’d see Potter’s beautiful smile again, “but it was rather humiliating for me to see you up there, sure and strong as ever, defending a Death Eater.”
“I’m not a child,” said Draco, angry his mother was speaking to him in such a way.
Draco sank into the couch cushions and buried his head in his hands. He did not move for a very long time.
“Selling.”
Potter visibly wilted, and Draco wanted to take it back.
tried to fucking kill you?”
“He stayed with me here,” Draco said, unsure why he suddenly wanted to defend Harry to his psychiatrist so much. “That means he has to care.”
“I understand,” said Draco, then immediately regretted his words. “Not that I
Aaaaand I'm back! After 2 vacations, updates will hopefully be more regular from here on out, at least until school starts again. I'm also taking a summer class which will eat up a significant portion of my time for the next few weeks but fingers crossed it doesn't interfere too much :)
Harry sighed. “I knew you weren’t over it.”
Pansy smiled. “He better have paid.”
“Not Buckbeak,” said Draco. “He-”
“Sweetheart, it’s okay to come,” Harry cooed at him, pressing kisses to the top of his head. “I want you to. Come all over yourself, make a mess of yourself, all nice and sticky.”
“If he knocks her up, he might.”
“I don’t hate working at the bookshop,” Draco argued, though his determined tone was beginning to falter.
“I-I think I reacted too quickly,” said Draco.
“Harry,” he hissed, jiggling his foot in hopes of waking the other man up.
What the fuck.
“Then I’ll be here waiting for you as soon as you are,” Harry said, and his tone was so casual, so nonchalant, that Draco didn’t know whether he wanted to laugh or scream.
“W-Why did you want to tell me?” Draco asked.
“Harry, I’m coming, I’m coming-”
“It doesn’t matter how long ago it was,” Potter said. “If it hurts you, then you have every right to feel.”
“You broke into my flat.”
Bella’s cruel laugh that throbbed in his eardrums as he pointed a trembling
here? You work
“Yeah,” said Draco, and for emphasis he turned toward Potter and smiled at him. “I’m fine.”
Then Harry was pulling out of him, panting heavily, flopping back against the sofa, and together they basked in the afterglow.
No sooner than Harry left did his nurse come in, with plump, rosy cheeks, big, round eyes, and copper skin.
from my son, do you hear me? You stay away.”
Ron choked out an ugly, strangled sound. A sound of rejection. It shattered Harry to his core.
you talk about with your ex-nemesis that you’d suffered a war with? He took a generous sip of his drink, wincing at the bitter liquor coating his tongue.
Harry was beginning to get annoyed, which was the wrong emotion, he knew, but he couldn’t help himself. “I meant in reference to you, you tit.”
“They don’t trust me to. What with being a former Death Eater and all.”
“I can only imagine,” said Annie. “How do
“Potter, it’s okay,” he began, but he was promptly talked over,
as pity-”
“Why, is that not enough?” sneered Draco.
and well-dressed, and he’d leave with his three vials of Peace. Draco, however, was beginning to go crazy. Why did Potter keep coming back? Who did he need the Draughts for? Were they for himself?
“Okay,” Harry said as lightly as he could, willing his voice to stay steady.
Harry felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes. He swallowed thickly, forcing himself to remain composed for his friends. He’d be of no use if he were a blubbering mess.
“That’s for him to tell you,” Narcissa said quietly.
“Mother . . . I didn’t reach out. This is my fault as much as it is yours.”
“I’ll do it.” The words were out before he could stop himself. He was so fucked.
what are they saying?”
“You tried to kill yourself.”
“I’m gonna come,” Draco groaned, gasping as Harry hit his prostate again.
“I know that,” said Draco, feeling a sickness pool in his gut. He and Harry could never have what he and Ginny had; he knew that deep down.
Draco didn’t think anyone had ever quite so tenderly handled him before during sex, and it opened up the floodgates of emotions he’d have rather kept hidden. He gasped as Potter found his prostate again and pistoned his fingers to hit it every time, ruthlessly abusing that little bundle of nerves that delivered so much white-hot pleasure to Draco. He tossed his head back, crying out in earnest as Potter continued to finger him into oblivion.
Draco laughed boisterously as Harry exited the store, the bell ringing loudly in his ears. He felt slightly embarrassed, but mostly very, very pleased.
“You have no one out here. No one knows who you are. You aren’t making a difference anywhere. You’re just shelving aging books that have more of a spine than you do.”
“No you’re not,” Pansy said without skipping a beat. “You’re wilting away.”
only cause me pain and misery. I’m in pain and miserable right now, because my only son attempted to end his own life. But that’s not all you do, all you’re capable of. You bring me so much joy. You
She and Draco had owled over the summer, and as soon as Draco had found out he’d sent an owl to Pansy with tear marks on it explaining the whole thing.
Draco held himself together the entire short walk home from the apparition point in the alley. The instant he locked his door shut, he collapsed onto his couch in a fit of sobs.
“I work at the Plot Knot.”
“Draco?”
“Have you talked to Draco recently?” she asked.
Ginny inhaled shakily, toying with a strand of her ruby red hair. “Hey, Harry. There’s something I need to tell you.”
“Ron might not take it so well, though,” Ginny mused. Harry’s heart stopped.
When Draco returned with filled glasses, he sat down and experienced a headrush. He was already feeling the effects of the whiskey, which was embarrassing, because he didn’t want Potter to think he was some lightweight who couldn’t handle his liquor (even though that’s exactly what he was). So he waited for it to pass, staring straight ahead. He’d also sat closer to Potter on the couch than he had been sitting before, which was endlessly more embarrassing.
should have protected
“Water is fine, thank you,” said Draco.
“Who? Who’s gone?” Draco asked softly.
our child, am I clear?”
And, at the same time, he wanted to stay.
Draco shook his head again. He heard Potter sigh.
“And when you were in the burning Room of Requirement, screaming, begging for your life, did you think you deserved to die then?”
“I’m alright,” Draco lied. Then, remembering his manners, he asked, “Would you like some tea?”
“I’m not letting you go that easily, not this time,” Harry said, stepping closer to Draco still. “Not after what Parkinson told me.”
Draco insisted, sounding angry. Harry decided it was best to drop it, as badly as he wanted to know what it was.
of all people, was enough to puncture the fragile foundation of his front.
“Oh, sweetheart,” she murmured, pressing a kiss to the top of his head.
And Draco broke, ugly and uneven. There was nothing graceful or eloquent about the way his sobs tore through his small frame, overpowering him until he sank to his knees and buried his head in his hands. Harry was instantly at his side, pulling him into a tight embrace. He half expected Draco to push him off, but the blonde only wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and squeezed
“Has Ginny come up again?” she asked, completely ignoring him. She was unbelievable.
“You’ll be there with other patients. You can read a book, do a crossword puzzle or a word search. They even have a telly.”
Draco was no fool. He knew this would change nothing.
Draco apparated with a loud pop in a dark alley, and began the short walk home. His skin still tingled where Harry had touched him, and all his nerves were on fire from the fresh, raw fuck.
“Harry, I . . . I need you to know this isn’t the end,” said Draco. “I just need some time to think. That’s all.”
“Malfoy, that’s . . . That’s absolutely horrible.”
are you thinking, Harry?” Ron slammed his fork down. “You’re joking, you’ve got to be joking cause there’s no way you can be serious- How can you even stand to
“We can’t happen, Draco.”
“Because you are good,” Harry answered, and he said it so casually Draco wanted to melt. “I know you were mean once, but that was a really long time ago, and you are a completely different person now. I see the change and the growth in you. You should see it, too.”
All day at the bookshop, Draco was antsy. He kept nervously glancing at the clock, knowing that soon enough he was going to be putting his heart on the line, and he’d never been more terrified in his life. The fear engulfed him, like a tsunami over an unknowing beach.
“I took him to a Muggle hospital since they had to pump his stomach. He swallowed pills.”
“I-I told him I didn’t love him anymore, and that I didn’t think anyone ever could.”
“There are no
“Passing out in the middle of your shift isn’t
“Why should I care?” Draco asked callously. “We aren’t together, as you like to keep reminding me.”
Potter looked
“Yeah,” Draco said, somewhat breathlessly. He gasped as Harry lifted him off his feet and spun him around in a circle, pressing kiss after kiss to his lips as he set him back down.
“No, it is, Draco, because you do it all the time. You block my floo when we get into fights, you kick me out, hell, you kicked
“Are you saying you
“Then you move on and find somebody else to love you. There are a

“You don’t know how long I’ve been wanting to do that,” he breathed.

“You can do wandless magic,” he said. “Of
“So you admit it.” Harry pointed a finger at him. “At least I had the courage to leave. You’re staying put because you’ve become settled. It’s a routine for you. I know you always liked routines.”
“Harry,” said Draco, “what’s going on?”
“How are you, Draco?” Harry asked.
“Well,” said Harry, “I think that’s me. I’ll firecall you, Draco.”
“Then we’ll call you back when we’re ready for you.”
Harry felt the effects wash over him immediately like a bucket of water. Draco was a discombobulating mixture of nervous, excited, apprehensive, and eager. Harry had never been in quite so complex a head before.
I do?”
. He felt sick with his love for Harry, the way it ate him raw.
“I’m close,” Draco choked out, tightening his legs around Harry’s waist, sweaty hands gripping his shoulders.
“At least I have a chance,” Pansy said, and that cut Draco deep and wide like a blade to his flesh.
, I need you.”
“Did Malfoy have anything to do with it?”

“Go as slow as you need, baby,” Potter said, and all these pet names were going to be what really drove Draco over the edge.
“Harry, just
“Ohh, Harry,
Harry felt the onset of more tears. He sniffed loudly, wiping his nose. “And I forgive you, too. For everything. For breaking my nose in sixth year. For the Potter Stinks badges. Even for all the cruel things you said about my parents. You were just a kid. A stupid kid. I know you’re sorry for it all, too. I can see it in your eyes. You’re too afraid to tell me, to let me in. I know that fear. I can see it eating you alive. But I know someday you can tell me. You

“Are you, though? Are you really happy?” Harry asked him quietly.
“I just wanna be near you, and hold you, and kiss you, all the time.”
time to ask that question.
“Oh, Harry,” he cried, as Harry hugged him tightly to his body, shuddering. Draco’s resolve was beginning to crack, and he knew Harry could sense it.
needed to,” Pansy scowled, pacing back and forth in his living room.
Harry let go of him as if he’d been burned. It was all Draco could do not to burst into tears.
“If it isn’t love, then how come I notice you’ve been looking so . . . good, lately?” Ron asked. “Better is the word I’m looking for. You look better.”
Potter chuckled. “Would you like me to do it again?”
Harry surged forward and softly pressed his lips against Draco’s.
As if Pansy could read his thoughts, she tilted her head and sighed exasperatedly. “Draco, your poor self esteem is really getting old.”
my life, Draco, you are everything to me.”
“Let me at least spell you clean.”
It hurt, at first, the stretch. The girth was more than what Draco was used to, and he wasn’t even halfway down and things were already starting to feel tight. He felt himself tensing up, as his breathing picked up.
“They dated.”
Harry’s face grew serious again. “Missed what?”
“Draco?”
“Are you really that surprised?”
“What do you fancy?” Harry asked, walking over to the fridge. “I have milk, orange juice . . .”
He nodded stiffly.
The blonde woman looked back up at him, pain written all over her face. “Why?”
“Yeah, well, someone had to.”
“Well, yeah,” Draco said timidly, not liking the direction this conversation was taking at all.
Drawing in a deep breath, he figured it was now or never to rip off the bandaid.
“Sorry. Force of habit.”
Draco sighed. “Whatever.”
Harry pulled apart from him, catching his breath. “Do you have any idea what you do to me?” he asked. “I don’t think you do.”
“He rejected me.” Draco didn’t know what to do with his violently shaking hands.
Draco gasped. Who in their right mind, heroism and glamor aside, would ever give up Harry Potter once they’d gotten ahold of him?
. I couldn’t . . . I bury mine away. I could never do that.”
“Do you have feelings for him?”
“You loved it, and you know it.”
“Why do you think?” Draco asked wetly, swallowing thickly. “People don’t hurt themselves when their lives are going well.”
“So,” said Draco, forgetting for a moment what they were supposed to be talking about because Potter’s eyes were so
Draco nodded. He watched as Potter finished the rest of his drink, setting the glass down on the coffee table with a hard thunk.
“Harry . . .”
Great. A question about his
“D-Doesn’t matter. None of it matters.”
“My day was a little more stressful than normal,” said Harry, “but one of my coworkers brought me lunch from my favorite deli shop, which made it slightly better.”
“Yeah, baby, and that won’t be the only time I edge you,” said Harry, voice gone low. Draco moaned lewdly.
“No, it’s not you, it’s
“Aah, Harry, it feels so good-”
Draco sighed. This conversation wasn’t going anywhere; Potter would stop responding, and would soon forget it even happened. He had to say something meaningful.
“G’nite, Draco,” he murmured, pressing one last kiss on his collarbone, and Draco was allowing sleep to take over him. He should have been wide awake in Harry’s arms, but he was quite comfortable and sleepy. Before long, he was dead to the world.
“Of course,” Harry answered. “Draco, he . . . I love him with all my heart. I only want him to be happy. And if his mother isn’t happy with his partner, then how can that happen?”
“Sounds cryptic,” said Ron.
And as they finished their breakfast while they listened to the birds chirp outside and watched the sun rise the rest of the way, Draco felt a calm settle over him that he hadn’t felt in a very long time.
me already; I’m ready-”
“Screw my letter,” he said. “I love you.”
After nearly a minute, Draco was ready to hang up, but then he saw Harry’s face emerge in the green, flickering flames.
Draco inhaled slowly, releasing shakily. He hated himself for appearing weak in front of him-
“You needed help, and you were neglecting yourself,” said Pansy. “You were in such deep denial that you sincerely thought you were fine.”
“Are you, erm . . .” Draco cleared his throat. “Are you seeing anyone right now?”
Draco nodded.
“Okay.” Potter leaned down, and planted a kiss on Draco’s inner thigh. “Okay.”
“It’s nice, hearing you talk like this,” Potter said. “Do you think old you would’ve hexed yourself?”
, practically cutting off Harry’s air supply. But he didn’t care in the slightest.
“Every step of the way,” Harry continued. “I’ll take you to your Sonograms, I’ll hold your hair through morning sickness, I’ll even take you to one of those Muggle classes where they teach you how to nurse a baby.”
“Well, you can’t expect him to want to stick around if I’m having a baby, do you?”
“Look at you, all red and open for me,” Harry marveled, before pressing a wet kiss on his clenching hole. “You always taste so good.”
“It’s for the best,” she said, before apparating on the spot.
her and holding her the same way he held Draco.
“I’ve been . . .” He swallowed past the lump in his throat. “I’ve been so unfair to you.”
“Forgive me for being crude, but I think we both know
“Yeah,” Draco responded, though his voice sounded strange and far away to his own ears.
“You don’t call the shots,” Harry growled, pressing Draco down harder which elicited a high-pitched moan. Draco would never admit it aloud, but he loved it when Harry took control. It felt like a weight off his shoulders, giving him a funny, floating feeling that he couldn’t quite identify.
“Well, if you spent longer than a second focusing on someone other than yourself, you’d see that I have no desire to spend the rest of my life with Ginny. I value my friendship with her deeply, but I don’t see a future with her. When we made love, there was no . . . fire. No passion.”
“I need you to know that this isn’t your fault, and right now I’m not sure you know that. He violated you. He deserves to pay for what he did.”
“Then fight back to earn your place. Show them you’ve changed.”
The more Draco considered it, the more intrigued he became. In spite of himself, he found himself wondering what it would feel like to have Harry inside his head, or go inside Harry’s head. Both sounded equally daunting. And yet, slightly alluring . . .
The words stung more than he cared to admit.
“He took away yours when you were an infant.”
“I can’t believe I’m doing this, but yeah. I will.”
Was he not meant to be good? Surely being good came easy to the right people? And if it didn’t come easy to him, surely something had to be wrong with him, right?
“Well, well, well,” she said. Draco gulped.
“Because all the attempts I’ve made to talk to him have gone so well?”
“What?”
“Potter,
“I need to write to your mother again,” said Harry. Sighing, Draco nodded and let him go. Harry’s abdomen was instantly cold without his touch, but not unbearably so. Because this time, he knew Draco was coming back.
“What hospital is he at?” Narcissa asked.
“No, no, no, that’s not true, you are, you are,” Harry soothed, stroking Draco’s arm. “These things take time-
“I know who it is,” Pansy sing-songed.
Potter’s green eyes softened even more, if that were possible. “We don’t have to-”
“What’s the big deal?” Ron continued, sounding hurt. “I’m your best friend, and you were too afraid to tell me first?”
“Just like you’re not a hero, Potter.”
“Whiskey sounds great,” Potter said as he walked into the living room and plopped onto the sofa, stretching out and putting his legs up on the ottoman like an animal. But Draco
“We all do,” Potter answered, tone soft as a quilt. “But you especially have demonstrated tremendous improvement. I look at you and I no longer see the sniveling, tyrannical boy you were in school. I see a genuine, warm, heartfelt man.”
Outraged, Draco white-knuckled the rickety table. “I can’t believe she told you that! I didn’t tell you for a reason, Mother. I didn’t want you to worry about me. You had . . . You had your own problems to deal with, and I was just . . . I was just baggage, and I didn’t want that on your shoulders. I know all I’ve ever done is cause you pain and misery, but-”
Had Teddy not wanted a book that day, he might not have wandered into the Plot Knot. Had he not wandered into the Plot Knot, he might have never seen Draco again. He imagined what would have amounted between the two of them, if he had settled down and had kids, or if his son had stayed alive. Draco might not have ever been more to him than a mere head nod at the train station.
“It’s okay,” Harry said truthfully. It had taken months of therapy before he was even able to sleep properly at night again, but he was getting better. Slowly but surely.
Draco scoffed. “Thought I’d be scraping owl dung off the bottom of cages, Potter? Well, think again.”
“Soon,” Ginny answered, fiddling with her hair again, a nervous habit. “I reckon some will take it better than others.”
Harry’s gaze moved to Ron. “Like you took the news so well?”
“It’s not like I have a fucking choice.”
After nearly a minute of no reply, Harry knocked again. The cancerous concern fired rapidly inside him, eating away at his intestines.
“I dunno,” said Draco, toying with the linen of his dress shirt. He truthfully hated Muggle clothing, thought it was too tight and constricting, but he would play the part down to a T for peace and quiet. He had worked too hard to attain it; he wouldn’t sacrifice it over a few garments of clothing.
A small piece, but a piece none the same.
“No.” Draco swallowed thickly. “I want to.”
“Because we’re both incredibly difficult people who like to make things much harder on ourselves than necessary.”
“Harry?”
Draco leaned in again, and Harry happily obliged, and their lips met once more, tongues curling together deliciously. They kissed for quite some time, until Draco was dizzy for air and had no choice but to release Harry as he greedily gulped breath after breath.
“So I’m assuming you didn’t end things.”
More importantly,
The next day, he received another one.
“I know a place. I can include their information for you on your discharge paperwork, if you like.”
“If you mean that he has lots of feelings, then you’d be correct,” Parkinson said. “I know this isn’t really my place to say, but that boy is so gone for you I swear he gets stars in his eyes every time he talks about you.”
. If you try and do it for somebody else, it won’t work. Narcissa and I will be here for you and love you and support you through it all, but getting better has to be for you.”
erotic. Harry had half a mind to ask if he could join him.
“Possessive?” Potter echoed, a definite edge to his tone that wasn’t there before.
“You have nothing to worry about,” said Harry, utterly humiliated. “Now, can we please drop this? Now you know. It’s all out in the open. We can move on.”
Mother hissed. “And he found you. And saved your life.”
Harry knew Draco was close. He also could feel Draco’s embarrassment from having to come so quickly.
“Alright.” Draco gestured for Potter to follow him to the right side of the store, where he kept the Draughts. He retrieved a paper bag, and placed one, two, three units inside. Then he handed the bag to Potter, who followed him to the check-out desk.
“Oh god,” Harry choked out, kneeling down and moving Draco so he was lying face up. His chest was still as a statue. Next to his limp hand was an empty bottle of off-brand painkillers.
“Let’s say I wanted to be a Healer,” Draco continued, barrelling through. “St. Mungo’s denies Death Eaters from being
Draco sighed exasperatedly, standing up and stretching. “I’ll get out of your hair.”
“Harry, how many times do I have to tell you? I’m
“I know that, Mother,” said Draco, looking down.
“Hmmm, feels so g-Aaah!”
“You’re doing so well, baby,” he said soothingly, prying Draco’s cheeks apart and thrusting his tongue back into the wet heat.
me. The things I want to do to you . . . You have no idea.”
“I was,” Harry admitted. “But not because I didn’t know what I wanted. Because I was too afraid to tell the truth.”
“Will you let me show you?” Potter asked him, so quietly Draco had to strain to hear him.
“It sounds like you need to relax.” Draco walked until he was close enough to Harry to touch, and he placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders, thumbs making small circles over the fabric of his robes. “I can blow you so well your entire body will quake from the force of it. If I’m feeling generous, I’ll even let you come down my throat.”
Harry looked glumly to the floor.
“For . . .
“I’m fine. Just, just give me a minute.”
“Erm, hi, Mrs. Malfoy.”
“Love it when you beg.” Harry manhandled Draco off the table, spun him around, and yanked down his boxers in one go. He pushed him down so he was bending over the table, with a large hand splayed across his back. “Gets me so hard.”
Potter picked up on the change in atmosphere, for he reached for Draco’s hand again. Draco let him take it.
“It’s rather lovely,” was Potter’s response, and Draco wanted to swoon for this man because that was
asked for that,” Harry said hotly.
Harry shrugged. “It’s just a question.”
Someone had saved his life. Someone was responsible for his continued beating heart.
“It’s my godfather, Sirius,” said Potter. “He died fighting for me. I blamed myself for his death for years. Of course, I work on it in therapy, and it’s helped tremendously. But some days, I still blame myself. And that’s okay. I know recovery isn’t linear, and I just keep working at it.”
“Would you care to tell me?”
It seemed to work, for Potter smiled at him as he removed his jumper, revealing a tan, hairy, muscled chest. Draco ached to touch, so he reached up and caressed the taut muscles and firm abdomen. Potter shuddered.
“That’s terrible, Potter. I’m so sorry.”
“Can I do this?” Potter asked him quietly, eyes boring deep into Draco’s. Draco, feeling as though he were about to fall off his barstool, could only nod. Potter rubbed Draco’s hand softly. Draco knew his hand was trembling; it had to be. There was no way Potter could touch him without setting him aflame.
Harry reached for him again, pulling him by the hands until they stood close enough to breathe the same air. He only had to whisper to be heard.
“Mr. Potter, it’s lovely to see you.”
Harry reached a hand inside Draco’s boxers and fondled him, causing the blonde to cry out as pleasure washed over him like a foamy ocean wave.
Harry found himself trembling slightly as he knocked on the door to the manor for the second time this year.
Once he got his wand, he climbed back up on the bed and sat across from Draco.
“I don’t need your coddling,
understand- That would mean I would’ve had to- So I guess I don’t understand- But I do understand in the figurative sense, which is- You know what? Never mind.” He finished speaking with a sigh.
Harry smiled softly at him. “You don’t have to, but . . . Would you like to stay the night?”
Annie looked up from her notepad, raising a thin eyebrow at him. She stared for several seconds, as though something odd had sprouted on his head, then she returned to her notes, scribbling away.
“Narcissa, I’m not giving up on him-”
It was a cool, drizzling, April morning. The rain pattered on the roof of the Apothecary shop, thoroughly coating the windows and giving them a good wash. Draco had a feeling it was going to be a slow day; not many customers ventured out in the rain like this. He decided it would be an ideal day to catch up on inventory. His boss Joanna would be pleased.
“What if I told you it was someone you didn’t like?” Harry asked, hating how uncertain he sounded right now.
“You’re so in love with him.”
“And then I’d lay you down on your back, nice and comfortable, so all you have to do is relax while I kiss and suck and bite at all the sensitive spots on your beautiful, writhing body.”
“Draco,” Harry pleaded, mouthing at his jugular before traveling down to his clavicle. “You’re so . . .
“It’s clearly not nothing if it has you this upset.”
He practically preened as he felt a probing finger at his entrance. When had Harry spelled them? Sucking in breath, he braced himself. It had been a whole week; he was sure to be tight.
“I know,” he let himself say, sighing against his lips. He was so
Annie kept writing, and the questions kept coming.
“Ham and cheese with lettuce and tomato,” Draco said without missing a beat.
Harry stepped away from him, fiddling with his pockets. “Just like that? You aren’t even going to give me any reading recommendations?”
“It would break her heart if she found out I went behind her back like that.”
Potter’s features softened considerably, and his eyes crinkled with mirth.
“It’s not,” Draco said. “It means we both broke the rules.”
“What are you guys talking about?” asked Ron, knowing how instantaneous the messaging system was. Harry was most not definitely going to tell him that they were discussing his potentially fluid sexuality. Nope, not at all.
Draco ended the firecall with a wordless, lazy flicker of his wand.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, as a tear slipped down his cheek. “I’m so sorry.”
“I don’t think so,” Draco said with a smile.
, for so long. Why did you give me a chance? Why do you see good in me when I have the potential to fuck up again?”
And suddenly, in that moment, he wasn’t Potter anymore, he was
“We were all so young.”
He looked absolutely
Draco smiled at him. “You don’t have to make excuses to see me, Harry.”
, and took a big, hefty, generous bite. Some of the garlic aioli dripped from the bottom, and a couple pieces of onion fell out.
Potter could do
“Well, clearly you need someone to step up since you’re neglecting your own.”
“You ready?” he asked again.
“Comes to his senses?” exclaimed Draco. “Am I not marriage material? And by the way, not like it
Draco wanted to ask him to say it again and again and again, thinking he’d never tire of hearing the name leave Potter’s lips, but instead opted for leaning in and capturing Potter’s lips in another searing kiss. His hands tangled in Potter’s hair, pulling as Potter released a little growl into his mouth and bit his lip, which was so scorchingly hot. The hand around his waist tightened as Draco’s little sighs and gasps sprinkled the otherwise silent room.
Harry frowned. “Am I really that disgusting to you?”
He left no room for argument, and Draco was left with no choice but to obey.
Draco felt himself shrink under Potter’s gaze. He didn’t think he’d ever felt so small. He looked up at Potter, then down in his lap, lips parted slightly. Then he looked back up at Potter, when he felt those blazing eyes pierce him like the sun on a hot summer day.
He had ruined everything.
The question stopped Draco’s heart. “W-What?”
“Okay.”
Harry’s gentle expression wilted like a dying flower.
After Draco completed the last of his closing duties and locked up, he and Potter made to walk outside. As Potter exited the building and put his umbrella up, Draco realized that he’d left his at the flat.
“Gonna fuck you so good, baby,” Harry growled, pinning Draco down and easing his trembling legs apart. “Gonna fuck you ‘til you cry.”
“When my child’s with me, you don’t control who he sees,” said Harry. Although his chances of ever seeing Draco again were slim, Ginny didn’t need to know that.
. I mean . . .
“Malfoy, I need you to tell me you don’t think this was your fault. The war, the rape. All of it. You can’t blame yourself for all that. Any sane person would go crazy.”
“The sale,” Draco choked out, thoroughly embarrassed now, cheeks aflame. “When you first came in. Where I gave you Hermione’s potion for half off. There was no sale. I just . . . Wanted to do something nice for you, because I thought I’d never see you again.”
Was the idea creepy? Absolutely. Was he going to do it anyway?
That was exactly what Harry had said to him. But Draco wasn’t done self-destructing quite yet. He had a traitorous friend to sever ties with first.
But Harry had never been much of a rule-follower, anyway.
Harry walked inside, and Draco shut the door with trembling hands. Now was not a good time, it was really not a good time. His shoulders were shaking with the effort not to cry, and Draco had to bite his lip to keep it from wobbling.
“Wow,” said Pansy. “I genuinely don’t know who I’m talking to right now.”
Guilt latched itself onto Draco like a bloodthirsty leech. He couldn’t help but glance down at his arm. Then, realizing
Draco felt his eyes widen. “Why?” he asked.
“I’m trying to eat it, if you’ll let me,” Potter said through a mouth of burger, tossing him a wink. A
“But I need you to know I care about you, a lot,” said Draco, and truthfully, that didn’t help much right now.
“You hear me, Draco? I can’t lose you. You’re going to get better. You just have to want it. You have so much to live for, if you’d only just open your eyes. Our world has changed. Sure, there may still be some people who won’t see you as you are, but there are plenty of forgiving souls out there who are just waiting to give you a second chance. Wouldn’t you rather know and say you tried?”
Harry deflated with relief, head sinking into his hands.
“Okay, okay, okay. We don’t have to talk about this,” Harry told him, feeling as though he were placating a small child. Draco exhaled in visible relief.
better ways to solve that situation. And you chose the one that would leave him tattered in pieces? Why didn’t you come to us first? We would have helped you!”
“Which isn’t happening,” Draco said dryly. “Not while I’m at work.”
“I know someday you’re going to get tired of waiting for me when I take longer to heal than you expect. Because that’s just it, Harry. While I’m still like this, there’s no hope for us. I’ll sink back in all the way and lose all semblance of self-respect. I’ll let you use me. I’ll-”
“Harry-” Draco’s lip wobbled as he blinked heavily to stave off his tears. His emotions were bubbling to the surface, and it would not be long before he burst.
