I hesitate but say another, "thank you", to the empty air before picking up the clothes and changing in the bathroom. I shiver in delight at the warmth coming back to me, now that I'm dry. I feel the material of the trousers and dress shirt mildly wondering how expensive they must be since the shirt feels like silk and the trousers are soft, rather than the scratchy texture I'm used to. But I give a small smile at being able to enjoy them even if for just a little while.
"just because you seem unwell and I'd like you to start taking them daily. So once these 12 run out come back for more alright?"
Harry takes a hold of my hand and we both get out of the chamber with the other kid trailing behind us floating all the way to the infirmary. I get there and Pomfrey places the guy on a bed before turning to me and casting diagnostic spells.
I am in love with Draco Malfoy. The time traveling baker who always puts everyone else on a higher pedestal than himself, because of how guilty he feels of things he did in a past time. The same one that came back to relive his damaged life to help me, and those innocents who lost their lives for a cause he was forced to intermingle with.
I slowly turn trying to put on my innocent face in case I'm about to get in trouble only to see Blaise!
I carefully weave her strands into two perfect french braids but finish it off with two conjured red and gold stripped bows. I run a hand through my own hair as I take in the braids making sure they are even and in the right place. when I hear a horde of foot steps coming from the stairs along with Rons voice, it makes me turn towards them as I place a sparkling charm on Mione's hair.
I hated how much I liked debating with him and putting both of our theories together before writing back my findings. which always led to greater revelations and breakthroughs for the things we both decided was “our Project".
He says and it makes me look up through my blurring vision that I desperately try to clear so that I wouldn't miss a single moment of him alive.
She nods and I open the door. It felt like everyone did a double take at us as we made our way to the table and Ron couldn't keep his eyes off of Hermione. Harry's eyes lit up with understanding and he was grinning at us as well as Neville. Blaise looked at me and smirked wiggling his eye brows as he glanced at Hermione. I just smirked back knowing he wouldn't have a chance with Hermione.
"Who was that and why on earth did he hurt you?!" Harry exclaimed all while everyone else just nods wanting to know as well.
I give a sigh of relief. "There's going to be a war, he comes back Blaise. Voldemort comes back. Too many people die and I came back to save the ones who died and help Harry Potter defeat that psychopath once and for all."
I stare at the letter trying to see if I can get some other clue to the writer. I don't know anyone who's handwriting is this neat or who would do this. D? How peculiar. I say a soft thank you out loud to the person who sent this and the owl trilled once again. I smile wondering if the owner is just as nice and affectionate as their owl. I open the parcel with cold fingers and my eyes widen at the items I see just at the top. Small pieces of parchment name certain items inside with instructions all in the same penmanship as the letter. A wizarding tent, a bag with an undetectable extension charm, sleek filtering water bottles, and several other items for cooking and storing. After taking those out I find literally an entire wardrobe. Robes both casual and dress, shirts of several styles and colors, trousers all in the latest fashion style. I'm absolutely astounded as I reach the shoes and under garments near the end. The socks are designer for goodness sakes. Who ever sent this payed no mind to expenses that's for sure. I found several toiletries and even a self heating blanket at the very end. The only thing left was a small burgundy velvet pouch tied with a leather strap. I open it up after marveling at the feel of the item itself for a minute, to first grab a note.
He sighs and his giant glowing green orbs stare right into my own aged silver ones, making my heart stop and give me doubt. Should I tell him?
That made Harry less anxious and laugh happily at my dramatics. So I smiled at my success and enjoyed watching the others eat their food without any issues. All while I unconsciously scratched at my left arm under my robes. I met Blaise's stare and my eyes widened at the realization of what I was doing. His hazel gaze travels to my forearm only to go back up with only encouragement in his expressive eyes.
So I take a piece of hair from his right side and begin to braid the small strand before tying it off with a spell and then taking one of the antique carved metal beads from the small box, and spelling it on his braid. The braid was partially hidden by the rest of his hair and I liked it because it felt sort of like a secret. When I was finished he gently touched it and smiled widely before hugging me. A thank you slipping into my mind as I enjoyed his warm body against my own.
Of me accidentally stumbling onto a secluded sword practice area at sundown, as a high ranking trainee readying for battle, only to see a frail silver haired man try his hardest to wield a sword. His technique and movement was fantastic as if he was dancing in the fire light instead of sparing, but he was too weak. His hair glistening almost as much as his silver eyes in the glow of the fire and normally pale skin flushed pink from exertion. I felt mesmerized by the sight of him even when he collapsed, sword in bedded into the soil beneath his hands and knees, while gasping for breath only for him to weakly punch the ground with a cry. I knew from word of mouth that only the royal family had silver hair and knew that this was the genius but fragile prince who came up with our battle plans. I knew that now wasn't the time to interfere despite my heart hurting from seeing him try so damn hard. But I knew I'd have to wait. Little did I know I wouldn't get the opportunity later on.
It's finally troll day today, and I'm trying to figure out exactly what's supposed to happen. All I know is that Quirrell is the reason for the troll and that everyone was evacuated by house. I'm guessing that the golden trio was somehow involved in this whole mess because everything happens to them.
There was a ledge above to block the rain and I took a moment to thank the heavens for any help they gave me, before looking at the huge doors. This place was a literal castle and I was wondering what could have happened for it to be abandoned like this, but I just bit my lip before knocking. I didn't expect an answer really but the door did open, which made me startle a little. I hesitantly looked inside before stepping in and taking off my soaked coat.
And Draco returns it with one brow tilted up and the other down in a worried manner, his face saying,
By the time dinner arrived Aristotle came back with a note. I read it with a smile. Madam Flores was absolutely ecstatic at my order and assured me that I would receive my entire order as soon as possible because I was her favorite client. I wrote a gracious reply back, as well as a packaged scone, and sent him off again. The others questioned me but I told them it was a surprise. They pouted but relented.
"Hey there, I'm Harry. I'm waiting for the owner of this amazing castle to come join me for dinner. What brought you here? You know, out of all the wonderful things in this place you are by far the most beautiful thing here. I hope we can be friends. And if you ever need any help I will always be there for you okay? If any other animals try to mess with you they'll have to answer to me first."
"thank you, Draco it meant a lot to me to hear that. I might also want some help with this frizzy hair..... I don't mind it really but maybe it would be easier to do potions if it wasn't everywhere. I'm also just a little curious and a bit self conscious about it."
I just give him a sad smile as he finishes and I thank him while buttoning my shirt back up. His eyes echo my sadness but I give him a real smile hoping to lift his mood. But he just looks as though he's in even more pain, that's when I realize that maybe he knew what it felt like as well. I give him a quick hug and warmly thank him again confirming that I will meet him at seven. I see his resolve harden and he gives me a warm smile.
It was only a few minutes until Sev passed by with a slight limp and Harry pointed it out with some concern. It was then that an idea occurred to me. Maybe Uncle Sev was trying to figure out what Quirrell was up to yesterday. Was he figuring it out on his own? I didn't have any knowledge from the last time so I'll just have to figure it out as I go too.
I look at Harry and I see a spark of doubt come over his features but I just smile at him for comfort and turn to stare into Sev's eyes. I just reply with, "look". He startles as he takes in the meaning of my response and hesitates but nods tensely as he places his hands on the sides of my face. I smile warmly knowing he only did that motion to be closer and more affectionate. He just chuckles and then he makes the connection.
And right as I burst through a tall wall of bushes I saw a huge castle. I didn't waste any time and crashed against the metal gate from the force of my speed. I didn't care, because as I threw the library book over and desperately climbed my way up, an entire pack of crazed wolves banged against the bottom of the gate. I cried out when I almost lost my grip from the slick metal but I held on and threw myself off into the inside perimeter. I gasped in pain,  almost letting out a sob of relief despite the wolves still throwing themselves against the metal rabidly. The thick sheets of rain pelted my skin so harshly I had to move my tired and battered body sooner than I would have liked. But I stood and picked up the no doubt ruined book before stepping under the front entrance.
I walk backwards to enjoy the show of him frantically trying to brush flour out of his 'luscious curls' as he so loves to flaunt them. I laugh and spell it away with a wave of a hand as he smiles at me.
I bury my face into his neck, feeling his warmth. I say a thank you and I'm sorry that's muffled. He just rubs my back and doesn't let me go until I pull away. By then everyone else is starting to fall back asleep. I whisper a thank you and Harry smiles warmly at me whispering "anytime".
I give her a giant smile and she seems to take the strange situation in stride with an open olive branch on her end. So I return the favor. I extend my hand.
I see Harry holding a sword all while he and siren hiss back and forth to each other, Harry with his eyes closed. I turn my head quickly when I hear a giant slithering sound come from where he is, in an effort to not die from the basilisk. When I do, I see a random student passed out a few feet away from me and a translucent image of a handsome guy becoming more opaque. I furrow my eyebrows slightly before seeing the journal by the handsome boys feet. My eyes widened and I call out to him.
I sigh and pick at my food for a while when I catch Blaise's eye and I can almost see the shadow of emptiness in him. Blaise was another thing that made me worry if I'm being honest. Draco was his only support and that support was now compromised. I still had Ron, Neville, and Mione to keep me in check and hopeful but Blaise didn't have that because that's what Draco did for him. I motion to the doorway subtly and Blaise gives an imperceptible nod of confirmation from the slytherin table, so I tell the others I'm going to check up on Blaise. Mione gives me a proud smile and with wishes of good luck I'm off. Blaise comes out after a few minutes and we both leave everyone to their dinner, to go out by the black lake.
He nods and levitates me before turning me face down, to reveal ripped whip strikes. Seven in total and not at all neatly placed. He sighs softly next to me and places a warm hand on my shoulder before explaining he will have to heal it the muggle way.
He looks at me and shrugs, "I'm not sure but I hope I get griffyndor. Hagrid said my parents where in there though I had no idea what he was talking about at the time. Which one do you think you'll be in?" Internally I laugh at the possibility of being sorted into hufflepuff for being loyal and self sacrificing before I say, "my whole family has been in slytherin for generations but I have a feeling I don't belong there" well not anymore I think. "Maybe we can be in griffyndor together Harry ", and at that madam Malkin looks at me in shock but smiles and says "well that's it for you Mr. Malfoy you can step down now and I'll have your robes sent to you, exactly how many do you want?" I respond with ten, six black with gold stitching, three dark grey with silver stitching, and one sea foam blue robe with black stitching. All of them in the cut she thinks is most flattering. "Alright then will you be paying that now or should I just put it on your parents tab?" "On the tab please madam Malkin". I look over at Harry who is smiling but I can see the reluctance in his eyes so I ask, "is it alright if I wait for Harry to finish? I won't bother you." She smiles and says, "of course you can." So I just go and stand far enoughto not get in the way but give Harry the peace of mind that he isn't alone. Harry brings me out of my thoughts when he asks, "hey Draco do you want to get our supplies together? I already have my wand but I need everything else?" He looks at me with hopeful eyes that I can't help but smile at, "I'd love to, if that's alright with Hagrid that is." Harry nods happily and in a few minutes is done but stalls when asked how many he'd like. He looks at me for help and I nod to him, "I think he will be good with ten as well, six black with silver stitching, three bottle green with blackstitching, and one Crimson robe with gold stitching, with a cut of your choice as well. Does that sound good Harry?"
First I take out all of the supplies. A silver comb, and a nice handmade rose wood brush with soft sturdy bristles. As well as 20 regular black hair ties that I charmed clear, a 50 pack of Bobby pins in shades of black, brown, gold, rose gold and silver. Then decorative bobbypins with jewels, some in a spiral shape and others in the basic pin form. Then I took out thin dainty headbands in gold and silver with delicate leaves and flowers on them. Lastly I brought out clips and a giant pack of small clear elastic bands. Hermione's eyes Widen at everything and she protests immediately when I tell her that everything is a gift for her but I insist and she relents with a giant smile.
It's so close now, I think to myself  as I sneak off into the girls dorms now that Penelope Clearwater was petrified. I make sure to not be seen or heard and I successfully sneak the basilisk page into the correct textbook before leaving as swiftly as I came in. I smile in my victory and make my way to the kitchens. Last time I sent the page into her text book when she was looking away but because I'll be letting the basilisk out I won't have the same window of time due to being unconscious of my body.
"Hey Draco how does it feel to be a blood traitor?! Bet it feels dirtier huh?" I just look and see him standing in front of Crabb and Goyle with pansy giggling, it's like he's taking over my old role. I think of all the pain he might go through if he does take it over. The loneliness and devastation that follows the blazing trail of guilt from your actions. I can't even trudge up any anger or dislike towards him because I was just like him, brainwashed and lied to my whole life. All I feel is unbearable sadness because it's all I felt growing up, and just knowing he's feeling it as well makes me distressed at the destruction of a chance to live a happy life. I look at him with soft sad eyes and give him an encouraging smile with a small wave as a greeting. His face remains straight but his eyes flicker with pain and then anger and resentment. I started walking away but he wouldn't let me.
As soon as I get back to the Dursley'sI carefully creep into the house but hear no one, I sigh out in relief and find a note on the kitchen it read, 'we will not be there until you have left for that school so don't expect us anytime soon. We will know if you take anything so don't even try.'
“Also Light wizards and dark wizards aren't synonyms for good and bad, it just means some wizards have an affinity for light or dark magic. Just because a spell is dark like a cutting curse doesn't mean it's used for evil. It all depends on the intent behind the curse, are you using the cutting curse on a person or for potions class on ingredients? The world isn't just black and white! It's grey as well and too many people aren't aware of the grey. I want to change this. I want us all to be better, to know more, to be aware of all the options we have to be great in life. And that is why I'm helping you, Zabini, because I know deep inside of you, your just waiting for the right opportunity to live freely. To not have to fight, to not be under your mothers thumb. And I will help you be who you really want to be. No matter how hard the road is, I will be here."
"Are you two like......never mind I'll know soon enough. Anyways what's the plan then oh wise time traveler?"
"Oh uhh right, I'm just a little advanced but that's just from practice?" They nod and smile at me with pride making me give a ghost of a smile.
He releases a harsh gasp and I fear the worst as I continue to cling onto him not wanting to admit he was gone. That Pansy might not have gotten her last few hours of today and became a candelabra for all eternity.
As soon as I burst into the kitchen I'm met with a smile and warm eyes that make my chest fill with fluttering butterflies.
He nodded and his rapid breathing was beginning to regulate itself ,even though his eyes were frightened, but I just kept eye contact and said encouraging words. I tried hard but the pull of the dementor was too great and Harry fainted. I barely had enough time to pull him down on the seat before seeing a flash back.
"Oh well two years ago I had long hair and used all of those things myself in private. My mother used to love doing the styles and seeing me with it all. But don't worry I
We all sat and Hermione gushed about how skilled I am, as I sipped on my juice. I only managed a few bites of fruit until I felt a wave of calm and I knew it was Harry. I scooted closer until our sides touched and was able to eat a muffin and all of my fruit and juice. All while Harry seemed extremely pleased with himself. That sly kid.
He gets a bruising balm and an antiseptic serum but instead of putting it on me he hands them to me.
I exclaim as I cast a healing spell over the hit and checked him over. He gives a faint smile through his annoyance and shakes his head.
We all sat together and the others were beaming at each other Harry to my right and Neville to my left. I just watched them seeing how innocent and filled with childlike joy they were, not ridden with hard faces and haunted eyes. They were children not soldiers being forced to lead and fight a war before they're even of age. I'll do everything in my power to keep even the tiniest bit of joy in them, I'll protect them and guide them, to make their difficult lives easier. They deserve that. I look up to see the teachers table only to meet uncle Sev's eyes. Sev! I feel pain shoot through me, I can save him! I used to wish he was my father when I was young and I'll be damned if I let him die this time. He must have seen something on my face or in my eyes because he looks shocked and concerned, of course to everyone else he looks the same but his eyes tell a different story. I know that soon I'll need to talk to sev, I need to explain everything to him and somewhere deep down inside of me selfishly wants to see if I could find some sort of parental love from him, that maybe I could have a dad for once. He gives me a nod asking for a talk and I nod back eagerly, and I see the ghost of a smile. I give a small smile in return then turn to Harry who called my name. He asked about who sev was and I said he was my godfather Severus Snape the potions master. He nodded and smiled seeing that sev was someone who was important to me.
I pat his back in comforting motions to bring down his nerves. I felt for Blaise as much as I did for Draco because I know if I ever felt like I had harmed Draco, I would be filled with horror and misery at knowing I was the cause for his pain. So I just tell him that it wasn't his fault and that it needed to happen because it was an important point in the last time line as well. He looks up at me as if searching for any deceit in the words and I could practically see the relief pour into his eyes at hearing the information. The guilt didn't fully leave but I was glad that I could help relieve any unnecessary inner turmoil that could harm him emotionally.
”I did horrible things and experienced terrors that no one should......things that haunt my dreams every night. I will never be a good person, I know that. But that doesn't mean I can't try to fix things. Help those who need it. Help you. So I came back and my only goal is to make sure you have all the help you need........and save my mother. "
So they rushed to give me the basics of where everything was stored and where to find the recipe books in case I wanted to do it by myself or they were unavailable. Then they taught me how to use the oven and all the machinery used. I was proud to learn everything they could teach me and then we finally started to make my first dish. They decided to make something simple. Pasta sautéed with white wine, onion and rosemary and some oven roasted honey butter chicken and carrots. The pasta was simple and I was very skilled with the knife due to potions. Though the others were so proud of it that I felt a warm glow in my chest as I smiled with them the whole time. I successfully sautéed the pasta and was very pleased with how it turned out. Next was the chicken, not going to lie it was gross touching it and rubbing in the seasonings. But I tied it up how I was instructed and placed it on a bed of honey buttered carrots. As that cooked in the oven I learned how to wash the equipment by hand and where the cleaning supplies were stored. Many times during this the guys wanted to take over but I just kindly denied it and told them to go rest. Soon we were all sitting at the old wooden table kept in the kitchen, and we sat around with them telling me funny stories and jokes. It was all laughter and smiles with them and it made me glad I decided to let my walls down with them.
Despite how funny it was we were all glad that we finally had a place to call our own and couldn't wait for Draco to become acquainted with our new space.
He had an affronted look at what I had to say and frowned as I continued to retell all of my adventures in getting help from healers because the matron was so biased in treating certain students. In the end I just give a shrug and say.
How dare you embarrass us with such a failure as to be sorted into Gryffindor?! Your mother and I always knew you were a good for nothing son but to go this far, I can't even comprehend it. We will not disown you this time, but know that you will be punished severely for this mistake. Be grateful for this second chance, you are only getting it because we need an heir and you are still young enough to instill what it means to be a Malfoy. But one more mistake and you will no longer have family, one more chance Draconis. If you fail then we will have another child and you will be nothing to us. Enjoy your time at Hogwarts and don't bother coming back for the holidays, because once it's summer your training to be a true Malfoy will start.
"Yes It's not good, the problem is that once they do this,  they become mentally unstable, and so he went from someone.....Tom. That was his name, he went from being Tom to..... Voldemort the insane megalomaniac. From what I understand Tom was driven to this idea of making a horcrux because, when he was growing up it was during a war.”
And though he didn't say a word It's like I can hear the words being whispered in my mind, though it didn't sound like anyone had said a word. More like the words appeared in my mind but I know with everything in my being that its Draco.
I softly place a hand on his shoulder, "hey none of that talk of loosing me, I won't abandon you Blaise. Say what you have to, even if that means I get roughed up by your body guards, it doesn't change anything. I'm very good at spells so I can protect myself, you protect yourself by acting the part of Slytherins ice prince alright? We can even plan fights and duels ahead if we need to, were in this together you and I."
“I KNOW Tom. I know better than anyone else how it feels like to fight with everything you have to just touch the rays of sunlight under stone rubble. To desperately try to escape the heavy feeling of death from every corner and forget the pained screams of those just right next to you. But you don't need to use a persons life force, what about an animals? Please, Tom you already have one persons blood on your hands don't make it two."
We both sigh into our tea and before I leave I get stocked up on potions. Once I get back to the others we all retire for the night and it's a bit tense in the boys dorm as we get ready. Last night still apparent on everyone's mind and it feels suffocating enough that I rush through my routine and quickly close my curtains, spelling them silent.
I gave a ghost of a smile and held up my hand to Harry, apparently knowing what I wanted and High-fived  me with a bubbly laugh. The rest of my time was spent helping those struggling and as class ended the professor called for me to stay for a minute. The guys say that they will meet me in potions so I nod and wait until everyone leaves.
And then the day finally arrived, the day Draco would forever stay this way if I couldn't find the answer I've been hunting for, for the past months. I hadn't slept the night before as I kept searching and even refused to let Draco wrap himself around me so I wouldn't sleep. He sighed but accepted it and placed his head in my lap as I tried to stop myself from crying in frustration. Draco was going to be gone from my life and after the clock strikes twelve I can't do anything about it.
Draco pulled the smoke deep into his lungs and his eyes fluttered in satisfaction, he blew the smoke above himself and Harry, stretching his neck to do so.
They had sent Draco Malfoy his letter of invitation to Hogwarts to receive his N.E.W.T.s a month before school started.
“Malfoy? Are you alive in there? It’s been like 30 minutes!” Potter’s voice rang and Draco doubted largely it had been half an hour.
“It can’t be stupid if it’s making you this upset.” The words left Draco without a thought, but he was glad they did because it seemed to cause a shift in Harry as he leaned into Draco’s side and closed his eyes for a moment.
Draco looked to his damaged skin and was satisfied. He rinsed his arm and rolled down his sleeve. He apparently had impeccable timing because a startling knock pounded at the other side of the bathroom door.
Draco shivered desperately as Harry seemed absolutely unbothered by the cold. Draco’s warming spells kept falling away within minutes of casting.
At lunchtime, Draco had managed to stumble over to their window and smoke out of it, attempting to be courteous to his roommate.
There in front of Draco lay Tilly’s dead body. Draco’s wand was pointed and the taste of the killing curse still sat in his mouth. He had killed her. Her tiny body leaked blood that began to stain his shoes. His favorite pair of shoes were now sullied with an elf’s blood. A hand crept to his neck and grabbed hold, the unmistakable cool of his father’s hands burned as he heard the whispers began.
“Don’t be sorry! I don’t need anything, I just stumbled across this and thought of you is all.” Harry pushed the package into Draco’s hands.
Their trek up to the dorms mirrored their journey to the Great Hall in silence and anxiety in Draco’s chest.
Harry’s eyes glinted with a mischievous nature that made Draco’s heart thrum, and Draco couldn’t stop himself. Draco craned his neck slightly and brought his lips to meet Harry’s. Harry’s lips were warm and soft, just how Draco had imagined. Draco took in Harry’s aroma of pine and mint and felt much more intoxicated from Harry than he had felt from the butterbeer.
When Harry apparated to Malfoy manor he shivered, but that shiver had nothing to do with the spell nor the weather. The gates were open and without protective spells, leading him through their open arms and to the front door, also left open. Harry’s sense of foreboding tingled as he drew his wand and crept inside. The house was quiet save for the whistling of the wind.
“Alright, Draco. Can I heal those hexes for you?” Harry’s empathy was leaking from his every pore and wrapping Draco in it.
He had known he had a crush on Harry Potter since he had seen him getting his robes tailored their first year. Harry Potter was not only the boy who lived, but the boy Draco dreamed about. The day that Harry rejected Draco's hand in friendship was the worst day of little Draco's life. He had craved Harry's attention from then on.
Draco turned and looked out to all the land that had been preserved by his family's money and wondered what would happen to it when he sold. He couldn’t find it in himself to truly mind, though.
Draco was grateful his spoon of food hadn’t yet met his mouth because he was certain it would have gone flying as soon as the hex had landed.
“Alright, alright. Let’s go.” Harry had slid into a comfortable smile that reeked with the sense that he had gotten what he wanted.
As Draco pushed open the grand doors, he felt warm air rush past him, escaping into the chilling evening. His shoes clicked over the marble as he walked past the sitting room, glad that the charm to light the fire in anyone’s presence had long since faded. The house felt hollow and much too powerful to be in Draco’s charge. It was like the thrumming heartbeat of this grand estate had died with his mother, now all that was left was unbridled death. Draco’s stomach churned unpleasantly at the thought.
“Is there anything to go back to?” Harry’s question was innocent enough, but the answer ached like a hole in Draco’s chest.
Draco felt clothes being slid over him and he was thankful for Harry’s desire to help every miserable creature he came into contact with.
“Er, that’s really nice of you Draco but I’m not sure I’d like to visit that house, no offense.” Oh yes, Draco had completely neglected the fact that his family had held Harry and his friends captive in the manor's basement and tortured some of them for good measure. The red on his cheeks darkened.
Harry’s tears picked up again and Draco held on for dear life until eventually, Harry fell asleep in Draco’s arms. Draco slipped away when he was sure he wouldn’t wake Harry and headed over to his own bed. That night, though he was not religious, he prayed for the wellbeing of Harry Potter.
Potter had stood then and walked out while Draco tried to look uninterested. Draco was jealous. Jealous of the friendship, jealous of the ability to cast a Patronus, jealous that he hadn't been on the right side, he was so green with envy that his skin crawled and he felt appalled at himself, disdain for those better than him was truly unbecoming.
Without hesitation, Draco’s boney fingers stretched to his razors, and he clasped the cool metal. Rolling up his sleeve was like revealing an atrocity.
Harry swung the door to their shared room open and walked in, closing it behind him and gazing directly at Draco. Draco felt a sudden sweltering heat that must have blown in from the window, so he flicked his cigarette out of sight and shut it.
When the final days of school crawled towards them Harry and Draco decided to rent an apartment together. Harry didn’t want to go back to his godfather’s house, and Draco didn’t want to return to the manor.
As he brushed his teeth, he looked to his reflection, and it pleased him to not see Lucius Malfoy looking back at him, but that's where the pleasantries stopped. His gaze fell to his dark mark, and he sucked in an icy breath of disgust.
Draco nodded in and out of sleep until his stomach’s grumbling woke him. He cast a Tempus only to see it was 5:00 pm and everyone would be at dinner. His aversion to The Great Hall had only been growing as he thought of all the faces of hatred and the boils across his body from hexes cast by them. He knew he could call for a house-elf to bring him something to eat, they often did this for sick students, but he couldn’t bring himself to take advantage of a house-elf’s generosity.
“You must forgive my foolishness, I’m so sorry for the trouble, please feel free to send me the costs of your trip back.” It was easy for him to slip into the way he had been raised, especially when it came to speech patterns, the formality lathering his every word like he was performing.
“Draco, would you look at me? Please?” Harry’s voice was gentle and caring, yet it took all of Draco’s force to bring his eyes to Harry’s.
“Just call for a house-elf, you know they’ll be happy to bring you something,” Now Potter looked at him as if he were daft for not having the idea. “Then you can stop giving yourself lung cancer for a bit.”
With little of a thought, Draco walked to the bathroom where he took in his reflection. His eyes were still sunken, skin grey, and his body still looked sickly and frail. He then remembered the blemish he could remove, that sat right under his sleeve, that if gone would surely make bounds in his appearance.
Draco took his time, licking the pre-come from the top of Harry’s swollen member, and then without warning, he slid his mouth around Harry’s prick all the way down to the base. Draco had never struggled to take a man in his mouth, but the tears in his eye told him that Harry was larger than anything he’d experienced before.
“It’s rude to stare, you know.” Draco tried to make it come off as biting, but it merely sounded like he was about to cry, and he wasn’t sure that was untrue.
He found that asking a house-elf to do away with his luggage made his gut churn unpleasantly. Images of his father sneering down at the unlucky elf who was forced to throw himself at a wall flicked violently through his memory. Draco couldn't even think of what the poor creature had done to deserve it but he was certain it didn't warrant that abuse. He approached the painting of none other than his ex headmaster and the man he had once been ordered to kill; Albus Dumbledore.
“Shh.” Harry soothed as he sunk his hand down Draco’s pants and pulled Draco’s aching prick free. Draco couldn’t help the whines that passed his lips as his eyes fluttered shut. Harry’s hand felt so warm and big around Draco’s cock,
Harry’s glare was cut short by Draco leaning down and kissing his cheek. Harry shuffled, more awake, and quickly rolled the both of them so that he was on top of Draco.
“Who’s table is this one?” Draco asked tentatively, feeling out of place as he sat beside Harry, their backs to the other tables.
Draco was curled on the floor of the bathroom as blood dripped from where his dark mark used to be. He pulled a cigarette from his pants and lit it as tears streamed down his cheeks and blood hit the floor.
Draco found himself asleep before Harry had even left the room. His dreams mingled together in a blur of confusion until one stuck out like a sore thumb.
The decorations were simple and neutral, the room empty of movement save for a crackling fireplace that sent a shiver down his spine. He missed Goyle sometimes; they were never close but Vincent was a constant protector and now his absence was a reminder of the death of his childhood.
“Harry. Call me Harry and you have no idea how much I wish we could.” Harry’s voice cracked, and he scrubbed at his face.
Walking through the castle was uncomfortable, Draco held his head high as anxiety pulsed through him. Draco had no intent to make conversation with the man striding contently beside him, so they walked in silence, heels clicking.
“Please don’t apologize.” Harry’s warm breath brushed Draco’s cheek as they were both sitting now, inches apart.
“Harry? How can I help?” Draco was becoming more frantic, he had never seen Harry Potter in this way and he truly never wished to again.
He always knew that humans had large capacities for hate, having been raised by Death Eaters and later the Dark Lord himself, but he had never known that self-hatred could be so prominent. As a child had no reason to dislike himself, he was an heir to the Malfoy throne after all. As a teenager, he had started to have doubts about his family and consequently himself. He found those doubts to have come far too late when he watched the atrocities inflicted by the same man who had branded him. There was no escape for him, he has been claimed by his heritage before he was even given the chance to have distinct morals. Now that he was far away from that life, it never seemed closer. Disgust crawled his spine and reminded him that hundreds of the students in the castle he sat in right now had been harmed by his actions and had seen the hatred he reaped. Draco’s body curled further into himself and he hoped against the odds that peaceful sleep would take him.
Draco was a sexual person, he learned that quickly. His first wank being the best discovery of his life. He remembered how often he would hook up with Blaise in 6th year as a stress relief. Now, with his only love interest straddling him in a deep kiss with a rock hard erection between them, he felt his confidence growing.
When they finally pulled apart, panting slightly, Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and laughed.
Oh, thank Merlin. Harry didn’t bother to respond as he gasped and swam himself and Draco to the ladder. Getting Draco’s dead weight out of that God-forsaken pool was one of the most difficult things Harry had ever managed. Soon though, he had Draco’s form in his arms, bridal style, and was rushing them back to the manor.
“Okay, Draco, okay.” Harry’s eyes met Draco’s and Draco broke. Draco broke naked, in front of Harry Potter, in a bathtub.
“Thank you, Mr. Draco, thank you!” Tilly wrapped her frail arms around Draco’s knees and then left with a pop.
“I try,” Draco whispered as he crawled up and planted a kiss on Harry’s lips before laying down next to him.
“I’m going to kill you if that’s true.” Draco laughed as he threw himself at Harry and began to wrestle him.
He loathed to admit it, but he would miss Harry’s sun shining smile and the comfort it provided. Harry had become a constant in Draco’s life, he brought calm where Draco sincerely doubted he would find it organically.
Draco felt a hand running through his hair and his gut tangled in disgust that someone would dare comfort his shame.
Classes were shit. No one sat near Draco, giving him a wide berth and plenty of room to remind him of his past actions. He was bored with the droning teachers and tired of sitting ramrod straight as to not irritate the hexed skin of his body. At lunch break, he retired back to the room he shared with his nemesis. He would do any homework sent his way. He was in no mood to be around others and their opinions of him, so the decision to alienate himself came with ease.
After scrubbing himself clean of the treacherous day he had suffered, he turned off the shower and grabbed his toothbrush.
Harry was sitting at the head of his bed, staring at the empty bed directly in front of him. Draco had changed a lot, maybe not for the better. Harry knew what depression looked like, and he looked it in the eyes every time he talked to Draco. Draco’s eyes were empty, and he looked starved. Harry hated himself for not trying to save Draco along with everyone else, as if Draco didn’t need saving when he very well may have needed it more than most. Maybe it was Harry’s hero complex talking like it had for Ginny, but Harry couldn’t help his pinning. One evening Harry came to their room and found the blonde asleep, and that was when Harry knew that he had feelings for Draco. The way his features had relaxed and his hair had been tousled made Harry’s heart clench.
Draco gasped as he felt the panic in his chest grip ever tighter. He was hyperventilating, choking on his words, and part of him hoped this was death.
The brunette starred right through Draco and took a long blink before nodding. Draco’s mouth went dry. He turned stiffly to his bed and rummaged through his bag, more so for something to do than anything else.
It was Halloween, Draco wouldn’t know this except whenever he opened the window for a smoke he would glance around the grounds and he was surprised to see first years carving pumpkins by the lake. He checked the date on the calendar and sure enough; it told him that time had passed at a surprising rate.
Draco pulled gingerly at the atrocious wrapping until it was completely unwrapped, there in his hands was a picture frame with a pressed and dried Narcissa within.
“No need to apologize, I well... I get them too so I suppose this evens the playing field a bit. Try to breathe with me.” Harry’s voice was calming and Draco caught more frequent breaths, focusing on Harry’s hand resting lightly on his shoulder.
Maybe Harry knew he couldn’t convince Draco of his innocence because he only whispered; “Shhh, you’re having a panic attack, has this happened to you before?”
He glanced at the full body mirror across from him; it startled him to find his father staring back from his reflection. He shuddered, shaking his long bleach- white hair away from his face, deciding that he’d rather look like a steaming pile of garbage than like Lucius Malfoy. With a dizzying rise from his packing, he walked to the scissors on his bathroom counter.
Draco snipped the scissors with anger at his appearance. He had been damned with his father’s striking likeness that had just barely been softened by his mother’s features. He gave himself a cut similar to his 6th year and as far from his father’s overlong hanging hair as he could manage. That's when he really looked at himself. Oval-shaped darkness surrounded his eyes, and he looked gaunt. His ribs stuck out under his skin and his collarbones looked sharp. He was naked, making it much too easy to notice the scars scaling his body, his porcelain skin disgusting him. And last, that damned mark. Draco smirked with no humor. He was the property of the tyrant that had threatened the entire wizarding world. He was only a surviving reminder of his family’s ignorance. He put out an order for his school supplies and promptly sought sleep where his eyelids could block out his reality. Any nightmare where he ended up dead was one he took solace in.
“Alright Tilly, it would make me very happy if you,” Draco rummaged around in his pocket for a second before pulling out a galleon. “Would accept this as payment.”
Malfoy must have seen his distaste, and misread it, because he flushed and pulled himself tighter into his sleeping bag.
He wanted more. He almost wanted to go and find a record shop right this second. Malfoy's face of discovery, his occasional awed commentary — it was good. He hadn't expected to feel anything at all today, but now he was feeling good.
he would be leaving the criminal life, I asked him if he could stop having people over late at night, I told him how much I hated him smoking in every room in the house… we'd shout. I'd shout at him. I wasn't
"I fucked up," said Harry, after a long moment. "You tried to tell me, and I didn't like what I heard so I went ahead and ignored you, and I did it in the stupidest way I could possibly think of and now he's leaving."
"So I've heard," said Draco, looking down at his plate. Pansy shot Harry another inexplicable glare.
you're Muggle-born," said Harry, grinning to cover his discomfort. "Maybe you're related to a Shafiq."
"What exactly is a neo-Nazi?" said Harry, frowning. "Like I know Nazis — kind of, I mean Binns was a bit vague about the Muggle bits…"
"As if I'd give a wastrel like that the time of day," said Malfoy. "Did you see the rips in his jeans?"
Neville raised his eyebrows. "Come live at Harry Potter's central London mansion and make him hangover potions? You'd be overrun."
"Right! Time for proper introductions," said John, proffering a hand and shaking enthusiastically when Harry took it. "I'm John, volunteer coordinator for this run. Our church does several routes in the local area and this is mine. Do you think you'll be able to commit to a regular day? Continuity matters a lot when you're trying to create a rapport with people. A lot of the people we meet here don't have a lot of trust, and even less interest in hearing how we can help them beyond soup."
don't know anybody mean," he sneered, "Because all your friends are good little Gryffindors or poor dim Hufflepuffs or ever-so-clever Ravenclaws. Can't be that clever, though, if they want to hang out –"
Unlike Andromeda's house, Grimmauld Place exploded into a mess of glitter, every banister a prickly bush of vibrant tinsel. Neville's elegant floral arrangements drowned in lametta. Their tree looked like it had been designed by a rag-tag committee of eggnog-drunk children — which was basically the case — and someone had cast a charm that covered everything in the hallway in fake snow, a spell which could not be banished and that nobody would own up to. Another nameless menace stuck magical mistletoe above the oven in the kitchen, and Harry had been obliged to kiss Ron three times so far.
"Fine, if it's like that," said Harry, trying to think like a Slytherin, "I might as well use what I have against you now."
Harry sighed and pushed the plunger down on the cafetière, no longer caring if the coffee was ready or not. He poured them both a cup, and Malfoy pulled his close in both hands as though savouring the heat, even though the kitchen was warm. Malfoy's shoulder-length hair was drying quickly, the ends curling up in a strangely soft and endearing way that Harry had never seen before.
"Oh," repeated Harry. "No, I don't think I'm in the mood for some ritual humiliation tonight, thanks mate."
"I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you it's wrong," she said. "Yes, he called me a Mudblood and broke your nose and let Fenrir Greyback into Hogwarts, but I honestly don't know if I'd have done anything different if I'd been born in his shoes. Nobody is
"I'm not who he's hiding from, but I probably know who that is," said Harry. "How about if I'm not a stranger?"
"Mmm," said Harry eventually, when no clever or coherent comment came to him. Malfoy laughed breathlessly in his ear.
Harry weeded the vegetable beds by hand in the hot sun, and they sowed radishes and sugar snap peas. Neville, in ecstasy, drew him a plan for planting more throughout the year.
"For conversation," Dean clarified, and Harry could almost hear him rolling his eyes. "I mean it, Malfoy, you can't keep hiding in your room trying to pretend you don't exist, that's no way to live. Come in and read a pamphlet or something."
"Very different," said Harry, eyes narrowed. Pansy swallowed, eyes flicking downward, but she wasn't cowed for long.
The stairs to the attic rooms were less narrow now. The squeak was gone from the third step. In the bathroom, there were three shelves where once there had been one, a messy battleground for Harry, Dean and Seamus's toothbrushes.
"What?" said Hermione. "You're not actually worried about him bringing people home? There are rules at the soup run, and supervision, he won't be allowed to get over-involved. I think it would suit him."
The food was good, and Harry felt warm and well in a way he hadn't for a while. There was a charge in the air that night, something heavy like static, something that put the party on edge. The wine was finished before they moved up to the drawing room, and vodka and oranges became drinking games; Harry brought the record player down, and they danced to Muggle albums by bands Harry knew Uncle Vernon would have indiscriminately and contemptuously called
They walked to the nearby park, the November chill nipping at Harry's ears even through his hair, making him wish he had a hat. Hermione didn't speak, and so Harry didn't either, until they settled down on a bench and she gave him a long, anxious look.
The plum pudding was deliciously sweet, and the atmosphere among the table softened as they ate. Pansy listened in dismay to Draco, Ron and Ginny debating Quidditch minutiae, and after a while began to tease Ginny about what it was like to
"Um." Malfoy's head turned in the direction of the record player. "I was going to put some music on, actually, but I can see you're concentrating."
Neville, to Harry's immense affection, looked disarmingly embarrassed. He adjusted his cardigan self-consciously.
And, of course, they'd have to be someone who didn't idolise him for the mere fact that he was Harry Potter.
"And I hate that you always do the right thing, and I hate that fame and glory hasn't even had the decency to go to your head, and I hate that you're actually funny, and actually smart, and that you're kind without having to try, and you're good at things, and you're unfairly blessed in the looks department —"
on me? I'm not going to do any fucked-up Dark Minion stuff, you know. Or do you think I'm that insane?"
"Malfoy!" said Ginny, bounding up to him and pulling him into the room. "Has Harry told you the news yet? I got an owl from the manager of the Holyhead Harpies! They want me to try out for the reserve Seeker spot!"
Harry's last thought before the memory was wiped was that Draco spoke of family, of family loyalty - but loyalty to the Dark Lord?
"I'd want a lily," he said, from nowhere in particular, but as soon as he said it he knew it made perfect sense. His mother had left a mark of love on him, a mark that had saved his life. It seemed fitting that he should honour that with a mark of his own making. It felt like the
To his surprise, a hot tear fell from his face, splashing him on the hand. He looked at Adhikari; she caught his eye, looked down at her notes, and silently pushed a box of tissues towards him.
They poured their coffees together, Harry fighting to resist his urge to keep touching Draco, to keep exploring the angles and curves of all that smooth skin. Draco dragged him up the kitchen stairs before they could get any more involved in the kitchen, but Harry stopped him on the landing. Paused to bite one pale shoulder.
His eyes flicked to Draco beside her. Draco's eyes were down, mouth twisted in dismay. Harry stared at that sad quirk of lips and racked his brains for something to say that might lighten the mood; he wished he'd thought to put on some music, at least.
Harry looked at Malfoy's profile, pale and stiff and beautiful in the autumn sunlight. There were spots of colour high on his cheeks, embarrassment lingering in his downturned mouth. He looked at the place where their arms pressed together, radiating warmth like a beacon.
"Ooh yes, I'd love to help with the decor," Luna agreed. Seamus looked at them, grin a little tight as he clearly imagined the kind of glittery chaos the pair of them would create.
"Early night," she said firmly. "We really ought to ease up on the weekend drinking, it can't be good for any of us."
"Righto," said Seamus, and pulled himself up. The drawing room had a rather lovely mahogany drinks cabinet; Harry had judiciously thrown away the bottles they'd found inside, and at the moment it tended to contain mostly cheap vodka and a few bottles of white wine which Hermione liked to buy for Saturday night dinners and everyone else liked to steal and then stealthily replace before Saturday came around.
carved deep into one of them. The letters were etched defiantly amongst a dozen other names and initials, some too weathered to read now.
They made it through The Wall, and then Harry put on the well-worn single of Paint it Black, which Malfoy insisted he play three times. And then because Harry was running out of sad music, he put on The Kinks, mostly to see Malfoy's eyebrows raise at the lyrics to Lola. He could tell Malfoy was getting bored halfway through the album, however, and was flicking through the collection trying to decide if it were worth putting on more singles and having to get up every three songs, to play one of the albums he usually saved for happier company, or to risk breaking the fragile mood by suggesting they do something else.
"A little-known fact about me," he agreed, and took a large gulp of coffee. He stared into the cup, trying to figure out what a normal person would say next.
"I told him I will never accept his apology." He grinned. "And that I only let him into the house so I could try my new Auror skills on him."
"Now you're angry at me for leaving?" said Harry, taking a step closer. "Do you want me to go or not? God, what are you afraid of?"
speaking, a Mind Healing Potion. It's used in rare cases of neurological trauma, particularly the Cruciatus. It's a kind of… brain refresh. You might not know this, but opiate abuse can seriously damage your brain. This can go
"Oh hey, I forgot it was basically a Gryffindor Quidditch team reunion in here," said Ron, looking much happier. He jumped onto the nearest available bed. Harry sat down on the one beside it. He wondered which one Colin had slept in.
Harry didn't think he ever truly could believe that, for all that he trusted Hermione's honesty. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was unremarkable; that he didn't really deserve attention.
," said Harry, hand out, and his tube of lubricant shot out of the bedside drawer like a bullet. Harry dropped it, hand stinging; Draco laughed, and Harry decided to shut him up by kissing him.
"I know things," she said, straightening her spine. Harry raised an eyebrow at her, but she didn't blink under the scrutiny, and Harry decided not to ask.
He reached for the biology textbook. Harry went for it as well, but Malfoy got there first and held it out of Harry's reach.
"I said I couldn't just forget the past because of an apology, but I didn't really know what he could possibly do that would make it better either. That it's beyond anyone's power at this point. I did tell him I respected him making the effort to change, and that I did understand he was a victim as well as a perpetrator. He didn't seem to like that much, but he did seem pretty genuine about wanting to be better." He heaved a breath. "I dunno. It's a lot to handle. And honestly, I don't really know the guy. He could be an unmitigated wanker or a really nice guy or anything in between and I don't know which he's going to be and how much energy I want to put into him. Guess I just have to give him a chance."
"Be my guest," said Harry, letting his eyelids lower a fraction, and he was treated to the sight of Draco's composure dropping again just before he moved in for another kiss. Harry felt devoured, undone, turned on more than he thought he could ever feel, but then Draco's hand slid to unbutton his jeans and he realised he could feel it more.
But for all they'd shared a dorm, Harry didn't know him that deeply, hadn't had any truly serious conversation with him until this point. It felt like there was something missing. And besides, he was with Seamus now, and that was good.
"Ready to talk about it yet?" said Hermione, patting the back of his head with cotton soaked in healing salve.
Inside the shop was close and busy, full of strange patrons drinking tea from mismatched cups in similarly eclectic seats, and the walls and tables were covered with multicoloured, exotic-looking fabrics. From the ceiling hung an array of glittering knick-knacks: bejewelled bird ornaments and dangling fairy lights, flower garlands and Moroccan lamps. A silver CD player on the counter was playing the sound of running water for some reason, and the whole place smelled of patchouli.
Harry stared at the shuttered windows. He could see slivers of the street outside — people striding past in suits, a couple walking their dog, a delivery driver on a moped.
And then she was gone, swirling away in her designer robes and leaving Malfoy forlorn, staring after her.
"No, I was trying to tell you I snogged Draco Malfoy and liked it. But I guess it comes with the territory."
"Very good, thank you for asking," she said, equally polite. "I've been writing a paper on mind potions which you might find quite interesting. You were rather good in school."
it's because wizards are sophisticated international travellers and are more culturally aware than silly old Muggles. Did you know that's what the textbooks say?"
Harry settled into Draco's chest, hope soaring. It was a tentative plan, fragile, but it made him deliriously happy to imagine. Cutting the ribbon on the grand opening with Draco — the two of them, dust-covered and wands out, turning another Dark-tainted shell into a place of light and happiness. It could work. It seemed
"Look, I'm really sorry to ask you, but it's… well, I blame Ginny really. I was narked when she moved out of the Burrow in such a hurry, and Mum was so worried about her, especially since she didn't want you two to rush into anything, but that was because I didn't realise quite how much of the
Malfoy turned his head to look at him. His eyes were wet and red-rimmed. He took a deep, shuddering breath.
go to school with'im," he said. "Sheltered toffs, the pair of you. You know, smack as in heroin. I don't know for sure, mind… all I know is that he left where he was living and came to find me last week, sick as a pig. I figured it was likely smack, on account of the puking and the company he was keeping, but he wouldn't talk about it except to get annoyed and swear up and down he's not a junkie. Seemed alright after a few nights kipping on my mate's floor. Just have to see how long it sticks I guess. 'Ere, waiter, I'll have another beer please."
"Pans, dear, we're embarrassing Potter," said Draco eventually, as though she were the one who'd made a scene.
"Well I'll be. Is that Draco?" said the man behind them. Harry turned and found himself looking at Fish, grinning like a mad thing with his hands in his tracksuit pockets.
"Then we'll begin at the most logical point — what brings you to seek Mind Healing? What would you like to achieve from our sessions?"
"Wouldn't you?" he said, using a weird voice he obviously hoped would make him sound nonchalant, which didn't work at all.
"No, I'm single," said Harry in a low tone, wondering how you showed that you didn't care that you were being hit on by a man. It was excruciatingly embarrassing, Harry was useless at flirting, but he'd managed to convey
"I rule my piano lessons with an iron fist," he agreed. "Now move over, Potter, so I can show you how a Master works."
Harry, the Harry he would have been without the Dursleys. A Harry without death dogging his every childhood step.
Malfoy pulled his knees up sharply to his chest at that. Harry stared at him, spine crawling with a feeling he knew but could not entirely name. An old feeling, one that made him think of dark cupboards and spiders.
"I don't think it's that kind of place, Harry," said Luna, smiling, and Harry's blood ran cold at the possibility of Malfoy moving into some dank drug den. But it was done, and there was nothing Harry could do about it now.
the houses," said Hermione primly. Harry, too shocked and alarmed at that last part of the exchange, was still standing dumbly by the door when he realised Hermione was about to open it; he took a sharp step back, out of viewing range of Malfoy but completely obvious to Hermione, should she look right instead of down the stairs. Hermione emerged, shut Malfoy's door, glanced in his direction and then jumped; Harry winced, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Ron sat up in bed, squinting at the hallway light; he looked at Harry, and his eyes focused. He flung back the cover, subjecting Harry to the puffskein-patterned boxers George had bought him last Christmas, but Harry was too tired to tease him tonight.
"That's easy," said Draco, pulling his hips closer. "You would have been too busy in Auror training to go rescuing a Death Eater in trouble. You might not even have heard about me. You and Weasley would pass training together and become an Auror dream team and everyone in Grimmauld would pair off and make little homes for themselves until it was just you and Ginny, barely living in Grimmauld at all, saying hello to each other in the gaps between your whirlwind careers. You'd probably end up hooking up with her out of sheer convenience. And if that happened, convention and Mrs Weasley would push both of you towards marriage. Ginny would probably agree as long as you didn't insist on monogamy."
Harry watched the curve of that smirk and bitterly wished that he could put his mouth over it. He set down his piña colada without tasting it, and slunk off to bed.
Draco dragged his teeth along Harry's jaw, and Harry tried to get his mind together enough to say the thought that was pressing at him.
"I really don't know," Dean was saying. "They etch it on with lasers or something. In like, ones and zeroes."
His shoulders shuddered. Harry wanted to touch him, but he didn't know if Malfoy would get the same comfort out of touch as Harry did in these situations. He took a deep breath, hoping Malfoy would hear it and follow his breathing.
The brand new Magic Mobile shop stood out like a sore thumb at the end of the street, a glass-fronted box stuck down in place of one of the war-damaged terraces, and it was very busy. Mobiles were still novel to wizards, but judging by the queue spilling out into the street, that might be about to change. Harry slunk into the queue with his sunglasses down to buy one for himself, and one for Arthur. He planned to show Arthur how to phone for a takeaway, although Molly would never forgive him for it.
"Alright, Harry?" he mouthed. Harry shook his head, dull embarrassment washing over the roar of his burning chest.
They pulled their robes on and attempted to look a little less shagged. Malfoy probably had nail marks on his hips.
of it Gin was taking… " He trailed off, looking guilty and exasperated in equal measure. Harry raised his eyebrows.
Something about seeing the House in full health made it easier for Harry to start the things he knew he had to do. He had a responsibility now, the House had expectations of him, and he was tentatively ready to accept it.
"Malfoy," said Hermione. "I don't even know what to say to that. If you'd told me a year ago that Draco Malfoy would be lecturing me on Muggle rights —"
"And he can't stay forever," said Neville. "A month. Then if we haven't murdered him and fed him to the roses, we can vote again."
"And you'll buy me this dress?" said Ginny, showing him a short, backless thing constructed mostly of string and silk.
Harry stared at the lips that formed such beautiful impossibilities. It didn't seem real, skirted far too close to the hero-worship he despised.
"Well," she muttered. "I might have once intervened in an attempt that was made, to, er, sell pictures of you in the Quidditch showers. As I prevented the sale and destroyed all copies of the pictures before they got loose, I decided you probably didn't need to know."
"Okay, here, you'll need to lie down," she said. There was the sound of Malfoy's bed creaking, and Harry held his breath for a long, agonising moment before Malfoy said,
It seemed to be a day for interrupting kisses, because he got an eyeful the second he walked into the dorm. After they day he'd had, though, it didn't feel like much could shock him.
It was Harry's turn to ignore Draco, but it hurt him like a physical ache. He found himself listening for Draco's steps on the stairs, playing scales on the piano when he wasn't there, reading books he thought Draco would like, doing things because Draco would approve. He booked an appointment with a Mind Healer, a good few weeks away, so he could chicken out if he wanted. He kept up his walking, but he didn't go to Camden, perversely reluctant to go without Draco but not wanting to invite him either. And he watched Draco, the way he opened up with every passing day, the way the rich brat act became softer and more genuine.
"Got all the important people here, haven't we?" said Dean, grinning at him. Harry looked across the drawing room at his scattered friends, nibbling canapes and covered in glitter, and felt warm to the tips of his toes.
Harry touched the necklace and thought of Camden. Of that feeling of discovery and a sense of belonging, of knowing he was no longer a freak. He'd felt that here, once. He could feel it again. He could feel the ambient magic of a thousand strangers and know this was a
Harry closed his eyes. He thought of the Dursleys, that summer after Cedric, about how he'd felt furious and deserving of suffering all at once. He thought about those moments in his life, those rare and bittersweet moments, when Aunt Petunia treated him like a human being. He closed his eyes tight, and understood.
"Malfoy Manor has a lot of history," Draco conceded. "Not all of it bad. I just… don't know. I don't know whether I want to look after a manor. I don't know what I want to do with my life at all."
"What is it?" he said, although even in his lust-addled state he had a suspicion. Draco Summoned his wand from his jeans and touched his forearm. Under the glamour bloomed a cacophony of brightly coloured flowers, roses and lilies and Narcissus in an arcing path. Harry leaned in to see the details, conveniently pressing his crotch to the groove of Draco's hip as he did so; Draco hissed.
"You mean... Malfoy was affected by the deodorant? Oh, Harry, poor you... it must have been dreadful!"
haven't found a reserve Seeker?" said Ginny brightly, cutting through the tension in her usual manner.
"Have at it," he said. Malfoy pulled a surprisingly reticent face for someone so skinny. He dragged a tub of egg-fried rice toward him and stuck a spoon in it, swallowing each mouthful quickly with his head down. It reminded Harry of his first feast at Hogwarts, where despite it all he hadn't been able to shake the feeling he would have his plate snatched off him.
"Happy to join the unremarkable and kind of gross club," said Harry, winking at Dean. "It's probably true."
?" said Draco, and his voice was weird and tense. "She's my best friend in the whole world and she hasn't seen me in a
"It's alright," said Hermione, and Harry relaxed. "You can put the broom down. I'm guessing it didn't work?"
to mean travel and adventure, Hermione had instead taken a part-time research position at the wizarding section of the British Library, and kept her journey of self-discovery limited to bringing home books with titles like

Seamus came back up the stairs after a few minutes looking rueful, with a full tea service and four types of biscuits. Harry smirked.
"Give it back, Malfoy," said Harry, with the voice he reserved for Dark Lords. Malfoy's sneer dropped a little, but he did not move.
"No… it's just… It's an observation I've made that boys — lots of boys, many different boys, not singling anyone out here — they tend to get a bit… jealous."
like he didn't fancy Harry. It wasn't really about wanting Harry — it was about the fact that Harry had been angry, and jealous, and he didn't feel safe around him, and that was much,
a lot of things," said Draco. "But quite a lot of them were astonishingly wrong. Frankly, almost every single one."
"Don't worry, mate, there's a whole bunch of new seventh years between us and him. And you get to be in Ginny's year – that's good, right?"
"You're joking," he said. "Surely Potter would have — I mean — no, I really don't have a problem, excuse me, sorry for disturbing you —"
"There," he said, face pinched and voice rough from the drink. There was green glistening on his lower lip. "Damage is done now."
. Like it hurt him to be so. He wondered what Malfoy senior had to say about it… not much he could say from Azkaban, Harry supposed.
In the case of Arthur's Magic Mobile, he suspected Molly really meant it. Hermione had bought Ron one, too, and Harry had spent most of Boxing Day exchanging texts with both Ron and Arthur on his own phone until the beeping began to drive Molly so mad that she threatened to confiscate them all.
Draco unfurled the scroll and pulled it close-in to his face, eyes devouring it, and when he'd finished he set it in his lap and
"I suppose there's no reason why not," said Ginny, when Seamus had resumed his position on the floor next to her. "Except for the fact that men —" Something flashed over her face and she bit her lip.
"I think it is," said Harry dully, pressing his face between Hermione's arm and the pillow. "That'll be why he's leaving."
"I don't —" he said, and it came out hoarse. He cleared his throat. "I don't want to be treated differently."
Draco accompanied this with a casual shrug, an elegant toss of his hair. Harry didn't know how one person could make him
"So do you, and you're still here," said Harry. Draco looked startled, but then his lip curled in amusement, eyes laser-focused on Harry's.
Fish spread himself out along his side of the red leather booth, throwing his arms wide. He gave Harry an appraising look.
"I don't think I've ever really heard Muggle music," he said, his voice full of wonder now. "My parents played classical, and I'm pretty sure the WWN only knows how to play Celestina Warbeck. But that was…"
His hand grazed the front of the desk; the faint hum of magic prickled over his skin. He touched it again, slid a finger along the edge of the desk. Something was there. He couldn't tell what, exactly, but he could feel the faint hum of a charm that felt familiar.
It started with Dean jokingly trying to get tiny plaits into Seamus's short, shaggy locks one lazy Thursday afternoon, and ended up with Seamus and Ginny sat together on the floor, both looking dreamy as their amateur stylists quietly carded hands through their hair. Harry, half-reading an uninteresting novel, had been watching the scene unfold from the opposite sofa for the better part of an hour.
In the same week, at her birthday breakfast, Ginny announced that she was not going to take her seventh year in September. That had been followed by a tense conversation with Ron, which Harry thought was rather rich — but then again, perhaps Ron was simply preparing her for the chaos her announcement would cause at the Burrow later that day. Since she was of age, however, there was nothing that anyone could do about it, and Harry rather agreed that the idea of stepping back into school after the year they'd had seemed strange, absurd.
"Shall I have a go?" said Hermione kindly. Ginny, behind him on the sofa with a full view of his wardrobe malfunction, snickered.
"Potter, how dreadful to see you," she greeted, waving a manicured hand and then, to his surprise, leaning in to air-kiss a spot near his left cheek. "I see you've become even more ruggedly attractive, how terribly annoying. You'll excuse the
Harry, laughing, decided he might as well join in, and pulled off his threadbare t-shirt to try on one of the new ones at the very moment the drawing room door swung open again.
"No, I don't suppose you have." Draco's eyelids dropped, as though he were composing himself. "Do you have anything you want to try?"
"So then the missus kicked me out. Tells me I drink too much, which is rich considering how much she profits from the likes of me."
He set the basket down on a desk and pulled out the Marauder's Map again. He was delighted to see that Ron and Hermione were in the classroom – he watched their dots join the throng of those exiting the room.
"Thank you, Weasley," he said, "Although I'm still not convinced it isn't a prank. I notice nobody else's clothes are see-through."
"Read out the list, Dean," said Harry tiredly, passing it to him and letting the catalogue slide to the floor. Ginny leapt up to grab it back.
"It'll pass," murmured Harry, low and soft, hoping it would help the way it sometimes helped him. "It's okay, It'll pass."
"Great, see you there," said Seamus, although Malfoy's answer had not strictly been a yes. "Anyway, I can see you're busy, so I'll just — "
He prowled closer, and Harry was sure his heart stopped, but Malfoy just came up behind him, peering over his shoulder at the pictures.
"I don't really want us to be enemies," said Harry desperately, wishing he could wipe the look of despair from Draco's face.
"And your current wardrobe does?" said Ginny. "I'm pretty sure the only things you own that fit you, you bought from an Asda while on the run from You-Know-Who."
" Malfoy asked, and Harry knew rock bottom well enough to pick up the thread of self-hatred amongst the incredulity.
"I won't," mumbled Malfoy, still face down on the top of the bed, and Harry sighed and left him to it.
at the sight of it… of Malfoy's hip arched up, the slash of pale white skin, the slim fingers working in —
Hermione had also decided not to return, but that was largely because she'd already arranged to take her NEWTs at the Ministry at the end of the month. More surprising was her plan to take a gap year before making any further decisions.
Face-to-face with Draco's cock, pink and bobbing, and he smiled to himself at how the fear left him, how easy it was to lick a long, slow trail up the underside.
Harry studied Malfoy, still a little too skinny and pale and pointy but perfect even so, reading a laundry list of Harry's supposed virtues, and felt his stomach quiver, his limbs go hot. He looked at Malfoy's mouth, taut and down-turned. He looked at Malfoy's eyes, widening now, pupils blowing out as he trailed off under the force of Harry's stare.
"Having him in the house makes me more uncomfortable than I thought it would," said Neville quietly, poking at his rice. "I keep expecting to turn a corner and have him be there in his Hogwarts robes, calling me names."
to be a gentle person. Because he hung on to his essential nature, even if that made him a target. He had such a strong sense of himself, even through the years of mockery from spiteful little snots like Malfoy.
"No," said Neville. "Not on my watch, thanks. Remorse is one thing, but punishing yourself is the coward's way out. Find a way to deal with it and be better, Malfoy, or you'll become all nasty and twisted with it, and that'd be a waste of everyone's time."
"This really is so much worse than I thought it would be," said Malfoy quietly, staring at his fork. Harry sighed.
Harry laughed into his damp shoulder. They were sticky with cooling sweat and come; Harry rolled to Draco's side and waved a lazy hand over them both. Draco squirmed.
to Harry. He mentally shelved that for later exploration, when his blood wasn't roaring in his ears, and clumsily obeyed the command, unhappy that it meant standing up away from Draco.
"I've changed my mind," said Harry, sitting up and catching Malfoy's wrist. Malfoy looked alarmed. There were scarlet patches on his pale cheekbones, and his lips were damp from kissing.
"Additionally," said Adhikari, straightening up, "I hope I am not presuming too much to assume that confidentiality is very important to you, so let me reassure you that the security spellwork on my client files is of the highest quality and regularly evaluated, and I am bound by law and more importantly ethics never to disclose the content of our sessions to anyone unless compelled by Ministry warrant, or in cases where I believe you or another person is at imminent risk of harm. That said, given that this is such a special circumstance, and in case there are things you might tell me that might pose a risk to public safety if disclosed, I am happy to make an Unbreakable Vow to the same effect."
The day of the revote, Harry woke up irritable from dreams of Malfoy running away from him, tear-stained and pale, fleeing as though Harry were the next Dark Lord. He dragged himself down the stairs and wasn't surprised to spot Malfoy himself in the drawing room doorway, like a spectre designed specifically to haunt him.
"Nah," said Ginny, not noticing the wave crashing over Harry. "Makes it easier. Besides, it helps, you know? Being possessed, being groomed — that's what they call it, when you're persuaded into something nasty as a child — it makes you question your version of reality. But nobody in group gives you grief if your grip on reality isn't that strong. Being a bit weird is… you know, okay."
"Well then we'll have to get you to the prefects' bathroom. And quickly. Ron, keep that spell handy."
"I'll kiss it better," he added, low, and Draco's eyelids dropped. True to his word, Harry kissed a long trail up Draco's forearm, lingering over the skittering pulse at his wrist.
He had his first panic attack on the threshold, and when it was over he picked himself up, dragged his leaden body to the kitchen, and made himself a cup of tea.
"I don't think anyone pops to the soup run because they fancy a spot of free soup, Ron," said Hermione. "Besides, he didn't look in great shape. Pretty bad, to be honest."
Harry listened to him walking down the stairs, bleakness now a background echo against a sudden zing in his limbs. Was Malfoy not well? Was he going out again?
"Look…" said Dean, slowly. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but… I had this friend, right. In primary school. We sat next to each other every day. His father was an absolute dickhead. Banned me and Mike from talking to each other, so obviously we spoke in secret all the time. Then secondary school hit, and I went to Hogwarts, and Mike started hanging round with his psycho older brother and a bunch of fucking pricks who thought shouting the n-word at younger kids was the height of hilarity. When I came home for the summer and saw who he was hanging out with, I just… I cut him out. Never spoke to him again. He kind of tried to talk to me a couple of times when nobody was looking, but I just pretended he didn't exist. After a while I didn't even think about him. I only found out later that he failed his GCSEs, downed a bottle of vodka and then threw himself off the top of his apartment block."
"And what a pleasure it is to be here," said Harry, equally dry. He crossed his legs and sank down on the cold tiles.
Malfoy showed him some more scales and made him repeat them all, gently adjusting his hand position in a way that sent shivers along Harry's spine, the whole world narrowing to just that one touch along his wrist. Harry pretended he wasn't enjoying himself, complained about every repetition, shoulder-barging Draco for a laugh as he played down a scale, and Draco played the beleaguered teacher and slapped his wrist if he went wrong. Then finally Draco let him learn a song, and he ground out a fairly dreadful rendition of Three Blind Mice, and then a better repetition when Draco looked at him sternly and told him to try again.
"Mmmph!" protested Harry, shoving at the dead weight of boy sprawled all over him, eventually managing to roll Ritchie onto the floor.
"Oh, come on, Potter, you can't say something like that and then run away," said Malfoy. "Don't think I won't hex you because you're the Boy-Who-Lived."
"No, of course not, why would you? You've got plenty on me and my family, you don't need anything else. My life is in your hands, I get it. Just don't expect me not to hate you."
His ex-girlfriend, kissing a friend in front of him. A handsome, sweet friend, someone Harry cared about. He figured he ought to feel
"Oh… yes." Ginny's eyes flashed with something sharp and painful. Harry wondered if he should have looked more sad; he wasn't good at this. He stared at her, and she stared back.
"We'll be late to get our timetables," said Hermione kindly. "We'll pick up everything you need, don't worry. Coming, Ginny?"
"Obviously," Harry continued, very slowly, feeling that Malfoy might need it spelled out. "I would not do that. Because that would be the sort of thing
Too soon after that day, it was Christmas Eve. Ron and Hermione were at the Grangers', having what Hermione had called a Norwegian Christmas, so they could be at the Burrow all day on Christmas Day this year. Seamus and Dean were heading to Ireland — and it was a significant holiday, Harry knew, because it was the first time any of his family would meet Dean properly. Harry hugged them both goodbye at the Floo, and wished he could take away their fear. Neville was already staying with his gran, so only Luna and Ginny remained. They had lunch in the kitchen together, Ginny in bright spirits in her lurid orange Christmas jumper, Luna smiling at them both past her violently flashing earrings.
Hermione cleared her throat. Everyone looked at her; she opened her mouth as if to speak, frowned, and shut it again.
"No. We were more enemies, actually. Not now though. He did me a favour, kind of saved my life a few years ago, and I want to repay him."
"Seems like he has good taste then," he said, letting himself stare at Draco properly for the first time. Draco's eyes widened and he fumbled over the CD in his hand, but then he slipped the CD into place and speakers began to play the opening bars of something winding and strange in a minor key.
Harry tried to engage the chattier folk in a way that didn't seem like he was trying to sell them something. He didn't manage to give anyone a leaflet. Within an hour he was exhausted, Malfoy hadn't turned up, and the clothing box had nothing but a particularly hideous cardigan left. Harry leant against the van for a moment, taking a deep breath, twisting his necklace.
"Well that plan would work a lot better if you didn't insist on saying it in front of Harry," said Malfoy, and then looked like he wanted to bite his tongue off. He put his head down, feigning focus on his task, but it was too late. Joy bubbled in Harry's chest; he slid up to Malfoy, smiling.
"Not in the ways you should have been, no," said Dean, suddenly serious. "I guess when we were thinking about girls, you were thinking about Dark Lords."
"’Scuse me, lad!" An elderly wizard barged past him, knocking Harry inside. The wall closed behind him.
bit different to a proper holiday," said Ron. "The hotel we stayed at in Egypt was just nuts, Harry, honestly, they had these amazing columns and tiles and an
"You can tell me later," said Pansy gently, leaning into him, and Draco nodded. His jaw was tight as he pushed open the dining room door.
"Come on," said Harry, giving her a shoulder barge. "Let's go lose chess on purpose so Ron can do the silly victory dance again."
"You will not take a seat, sir?" said Kreacher, who was already dragging a chair over to a nearby countertop. "There is cottage pie and apple crumble if you wants it, or ice cream, or roast chicken from yesterday –"
"Are you trying to drag me into a threesome?" quipped Draco, looking like he wasn't sure if he were being teased. "Because I think it should be clear by now that I'm absolutely the
"But you said not to tell anyone, back when I was wearing that bloody deodorant. When you snogged me first."
— he knew, at least, that he wasn't white, even though he wasn't quite sure what else that made him. People had asked him where he was from and didn't believe him when he said Surrey. People looked curiously at him when he was out with the Dursleys. And there were memories of primary school insults, with definitions that hadn't made any sense to him, because he wasn't from Pakistan and he wasn't entirely sure why it would be bad if he was. He hadn't really known how he should feel about the words as a child, but he knew they were
"I can freehand you a lily if you take it now, my last appointment was a no-show. You can see Ellie's arms if you want a live example of my work. Show him the rose, babe."
Ellie, giving him a look that was definitely flirtatious, held out her left wrist. Harry went hot with embarrassment as he caught her hand to examine it. In amongst the swirling patterns and winding calligraphy was a black outline of a rose, the petals delicately shaded with appealing dotwork. Harry didn't know much about tattoos, but it looked really good.
"Of course not," said Ron, patting him on the arm until he settled back down. "None of us would let that happen. It's not the same as it was before. Draco's in a good place, he's got documents now and a Muggle job and enough Muggle knowledge that he won't kill himself with a toaster. He'll find somewhere to stay. And none of us are just going to cut him out, are we?"
Harry mostly watched Draco. The Quidditch talk had defused his tense expression, and now he was lazily scooping custard from his bowl with a faint smirk, occasionally adding something inflammatory to the Pansy-Ginny bickering match.
Harry bit down on the side of his tongue. Malfoy didn't appear to need a response to that, thankfully, because he kept talking.
"But –" protested Ritchie, looking quite deranged, "But you're so delicious Harry, I can't bear to sleep in these dorms knowing you're near!" He tried to lunge again.
"Kreacher will be serving hot drinks in the drawing room." He accompanied this with a deep bow. Harry shifted in his uncomfortable chair, and wanted to hug him a bit. He wasn't sure what he'd do without him.
"I have absolutely no idea," said Malfoy, catching him by the arm before he swayed into the wall. "Harry Potter has dragged me into a tattoo shop in Muggle London and now he's grinning at me like a drunk and I have absolutely no
He pressed against Draco, taking control, tearing Draco's shirt open and running his nails over the flesh revealed. He ran his fingers over a faint indentation over his ribs, then froze as he realised what it was – a silvery, S-shaped scar.
Then the Weird Sisters came on and Ginny dragged Neville up for a re-enactment of their awkward Yule Ball dance, but they were both much smoother now, and Neville looked kind of red and Ginny looked kind of serious and at the end of the dance Ginny gave a little tug to the front of Neville's jumper and then they were kissing. Harry found himself looking at Luna; she was sitting on the arm of the armchair, knees up, just watching the kiss as though everything were so very normal.
"Slap me with a splintered ruler," crooned Seamus, doing an ungainly jive, and wiggled his eyebrows at Harry and Malfoy as they entered. Malfoy actually snorted.
He found Malfoy in the drawing room. He'd flung himself across one sofa, too long and too sharp and too pale against the worn chintz. He was wearing a pair of grey jogging bottoms, and a brown jumper that was too big — an outfit he would have expected to have come out of his own wardrobe rather than Malfoy's.
catalogue," said Dean, shrugging. "Dunno if it's any good, I can't remember the last time I bought something Muggle that wasn't from JJB Sports." He plucked at his football t-shirt.
on, and that was that it was quite funny. He nearly choked on his tea three times, and when a woman entered the shop who looked just like Umbridge but was dressed like Trelawney, Draco did a skit about the two of them combining until Harry couldn't breathe for laughing.
"Well," she said, "My — er, Grace recommended attending a support group for childhood trauma survivors. And I thought it was going to be a total mess but actually it's really good —"
"Maybe not then," said Harry, smiling again, and Neville's returning smile was warm and genuine for a moment until whatever it was that was making him awkward resurfaced.
Harry barely saw Malfoy until the next weekend — his building firm secured some big construction job in the City, and Malfoy was tired or absent every evening. Harry tried not to think about him — about the hot stab of rage he felt whenever he thought about what had happened to him. By Saturday night, Harry had got a handle on his desire to curse Spider and damn the consequences, and Malfoy was finally at dinner. He was blasé as ever, dramatically waving a forkful of sausage at Seamus as he insisted that yes, he absolutely had seen Hooch kissing Sprout in the greenhouses in second year and everyone had been very cruel and unkind to disbelieve him just because he'd lied about Snape and McGonagall the week before.
"Closest I've come to potions in a while," said Malfoy, smirking at Luna as he passed her the final glass.
"Would you like to play something with Harry, Teddy?" said Andromeda, and Teddy wriggled himself out of Harry's grip, nodding.
"It's just Harry. He gets like that sometimes. It used to scare me a bit, in school, but I know better now. You wouldn't know, you never saw him with the DA, but he's gentle and patient when you need it most. It's kind of impressive, considering who brought him up."
"Actually," said Harry, looking around at the greasy shops opposite the park and taking a calculated risk. "Why don't you go ahead? I want to grab a snack from the kebab shop over the road. Unless you want to join me?"
. He'd loved Harry, and he'd tried for him, and he was gone now, along with so many others. He curled up on Sirius's bed, breathing deep as though he could still smell him on the pillow, and cried for the first time in a long time.
Harry curled under the covers and tried to let his tiredness take him away, to let the reassuring presence of Ron and Hermione make him feel safe again. He dozed a little, waking from nightmares of Draco running away from him, the lick of Fiendfyre at his back. Ron or Hermione would pat him in their sleep, and his eyes would close again, only for the nightmare to begin anew.
"Fuck, Potter," said Malfoy, hips bucking, choking Harry, but Harry struggled to care when Malfoy was groaning like that, when every uncontrolled movement seemed to go straight to Harry's cock. Malfoy's hand found its way into his hair, held him in place as he thrust – then Malfoy pulled him away, pulled him upward, devoured him with a fierce kiss. Malfoy caught Harry's hand and led it to both their cocks; Harry groaned into Malfoy's mouth, thrusting, grinding against spit-slickened flesh until the pressure was too much, too much – he bucked his hips wildly, panting against Malfoy's mouth, and came. Malfoy followed, with a shuddering moan.
Harry began to wonder what he might find when he got there. He was not overly surprised to see Ginny leaning in to kiss him as he arrived.
"Ha," said Malfoy, but he pulled himself up straighter and flung a casual hand over his broom, which jumped obediently into his hand.
"You," said Neville. "You're alright by me. There's some things I can forgive and some things I can't. But I reckon those are things I can, and I believe you regret it and you want to change, so you're alright by me. As long as you don't, you know, hurt anyone again."
grieving, but she has completely lost all sense of boundaries. She's obsessed with trying to convince us to go back to Hogwarts, she feeds us
Neville murmured something to Malfoy, who raised his eyebrows and said something quiet and sharp in return, and then Neville laughed, and Malfoy's shoulders dropped imperceptibly.
Harry looked around and met Ron's gaze. Ron grimaced. He glanced around the rest of the room; nobody else had noticed this exchange, which was a small mercy, as he wasn't sure whether the housemates would take this as a violation of Malfoy's deal.
Andromeda took the box, tapped it with her wand to expand it, and then looked at the label in dismay.
's obsession with one particular photo of him had been eye-opening; he'd been snapped at Hogwarts during the early days of the cleanup efforts, standing amongst the rubble in the sun with his shirt open, hands in pockets as he took a break to gaze out over the lake. The associated article had jumped straight past complimentary and into terrifyingly breathless commentary on his bare chest. Harry couldn't get past the feeling that his fame had something to do with it, but there was only so much fame could explain.
"How about if we ditch the soup and go get a takeaway or something, you get to know me and hear me out, and then you can decide."
John hefted the box up and pushed it into Harry's arms. Harry followed John to the front of the van.
A few weeks after, Ron announced that he intended to accept an offer to join the Auror training program. Harry, who had been staring at the very same offer for a week, tossed a Knut for it.
"I'm definitely not going," he said. "But Gin — I appreciate you asking. And I'm glad you're going."
"I don't think so," said Neville. "I mean, she really wanted to — er, that is to say, I don't know if I should say — well, anyway, I think she's looking for different things than I am. Which is not to say I'm not tempted, I mean,
The group, it turned out, was not half as bad as he thought it was going to be. The Community Centre reminded him painfully of his old primary school, with its pockmarked polystyrene ceiling and blinking fluorescent lights. The group room was laid out as a circle of moulded plastic chairs, with cheap vinyl tables pushed back against the walls.
"I wish she wouldn't," said Harry, slumping onto his usual chair. "I do go outside. I go to Tesco, and the Burrow, and the pub."
Warming Charms cast, Harry slipped on the wellington boots beside the back door — he thought they were probably Neville's — and let Draco pull on his trainers. Grinning at the sight of the frosty grass, he pulled Draco across the lawn, dodging the scorch-mark evidence of last night's fireworks. Then he wrapped himself around Draco in the dawn light, lingering under the archway to the secret garden. The morning rays were shining on the dew-glittered ground. The branches of the apple trees were bare now, ready and waiting to grow new shoots.
Luna smiled at him again, but mercifully her eyes drifted back to her embroidery before he had a chance to get uneasy.
"Is he alright?" Ron muttered as they stood outside the dining room, blinking to adjust to the hallway light.
"Not like it can get much worse," said Malfoy. "Nobody believes that I thought the Dark Lord was a sadistic nutter who never should have been born, they all think I'm mourning and plotting resurrection. But don't change the subject – you had a bit of
"Thank you very much, Harry," she said, as Harry handed her the biro back. "I look forward to working with you."
"Hope I've found something to please the housemates," said Harry. "They get mad when I buy things that are too depressing."
"I used to be an illustrator," said Shev, not looking up from her work. "My husband was a botanist. He wrote books about plants and I illustrated them. When he died I just… needed a change. I couldn't stop drawing flowers, I was a bit obsessed, but I became obsessed with skulls as well. The juxtaposition of it, you know? Life and death."
Then Draco launched into a jaunty rendition of Three Blind Mice himself, and everyone in the room laughed, and Harry abruptly became aware that the entire time they'd been at the piano they were being watched.
Hermione gave him a peck on the cheek and headed off in the direction of a large bush. Harry waited until he heard the familiar crack of Apparition, then before he crossed over to the lamp post.
Further down the street, he slipped into the warrens of the Christmas Market and bought an exotic silk pillowcase, a new bed designed for large Crups, an expensive cleaning potion, and a mug that said 'World's Best House-Elf' for Kreacher. Then he bought out half a sweet stall for Ron, and an array of expensive chocolate boxes for everyone else he could think of except Seamus and Dean — he planned to buy them the expensive Muggle trainers they'd admired the other week.
"You're not wrong, Luna," said Harry. "I don't think you're that weird at all. Or… you are, but in all the good ways."
Luna and Ginny looked at each other, eyes sparkling, and Harry smiled through his lingering sense of unease.
"It's for the best," said Dean, reaching over the arm of the chair to clap him on the shoulder. "It doesn't mean the end."
Neville didn't look entirely convinced, but he did look determined. Harry, still jittery from realising yet again that there was something fundamentally wrong with him, found himself smiling anyway.
"Snape was shit at teaching," said Harry. Malfoy looked as though he wanted to defend Snape, but then he gave Harry a silent shrug of acknowledgement.
Harry nodded. "It hasn't been long. But I went to Diagon Alley the other day. Which reminds me, I have a present for you too. I haven't wrapped it, and it's not as good as yours, but — "
"Alright Harry?" Seamus called from across the room, winking. "What do you think of the theme? Apparently Gin was worried I'd forget me heritage."
," said Malfoy. "Because I'm a coward who doesn't know when to quit when he's in trouble. I swore to myself, Potter, that I wouldn't fall in blindly with the wrong people again. That I'd say
"No," agreed Harry. "Yeah, no, I know that. But I'm bisexual. Well, I think. I don't think I work the same way as everyone else when it comes to this sort of thing so I'm not sure."
They finished dessert, and Harry pushed his chair back to stretch out his legs. He wished he could kick his chair out, like he did downstairs, but it felt rude in this atmosphere of formal opulence.
"Of course... because you're heroic Harry Potter, aren't you? Well guess what – I don't need saving, and I don't want to be in your
"Fuck no," growled Harry, pushing Draco backwards, continuing to push until Draco was up against the wall. "I'm not done yet."
Post dealt with, Harry felt a little lighter. By evening he was almost in a good mood again, humming to himself as he collaborated with Kreacher on a roast dinner. It was nice to know they'd all be in tonight for the vote, even if the vote itself made Harry jittery.
"Things turned quickly after I moved in, kind of embarrassing really," continued Malfoy, blank-eyed and oblivious to Harry's shame. "He asked me to earn my keep, which was fair enough, but if I didn't cook or clean to his liking he'd get upset.
Thankfully, only Ron, Hermione and Ginny were left, obviously waiting for him. Ginny looked up as he arrived.
He leant against the wall, gasping for breath as Malfoy regained his senses. His lips looked bruised.
"I won't be much good," he said, raking a hand through his hair. He didn't think he'd last one moment in the heat of Draco's body. Draco gave him a long look, mouth curving into that impossibly wicked smirk. And Harry had seen that mouth around him, in his own bedroom, had seen that smirk with the filthiest of promises attached — how could he ever look at it again?
"It helped," said Hermione. "It helped a lot. They remembered me almost all the way through dinner. I think it's sticking, too."
to be ignored. After breakfast Harry returned to his hopeless attempt at reading a book in the drawing room, where he heard Malfoy pacing up and down the stairs at least six times. After the seventh, he wasn't entirely surprised to see his white-blond head poke around the drawing room door.
They had another garden picnic for the solar eclipse. A freshly eighteen-year-old Ginny joked it was symbolic of the death of her childhood, although the pronouncement might have been more dramatic had they been able to see anything of the eclipse through the clouds. Regardless of the anticlimax, they all got a little drunk, culminating in Ron deciding to make three o'clock Irish coffees and promptly puking all over the kitchen sink.
He looked around at the guests. It wasn't as bad as he thought it would be. Parvati Patil was dancing in a circle in the centre of the room, a little unsteadily, grinning at her sister and Lavender on the sofa. Padma looked embarrassed, and Lavender's anxious expression wrinkled the scars on her face. Her expression softened into relief when she saw Harry, and she waved at him a little, subdued and self-conscious in a way she'd never been at school. Neville was by the record player with Hannah, leaning in close to talk. Ron, Ginny and Hermione were clustered around the drinks cabinet nearby, casting shifty glances over their shoulders. Ernie MacMillan was perched on the other sofa, talking to someone Harry suspected was Seamus's cousin, and Seamus himself was standing by the long buffet table by the window, wearing a paper crown on his sandy blond head and talking to George. The buffet table was groaning with snacks, many of which were a lot more green than they had been when Harry and Ron had made them. Harry watched Seamus point at his birthday cake and mime something which looked suspiciously like an explosion. George laughed.
Hermione cleared her throat again. Harry gave her a shifty look, and kept his eyes on his plum pudding.
"Go to bed," he said, when Ginny tried to play the wrong suit three times in a row. "I'm going to see if Kreacher needs help with the dining room."
"Besides," he said, voice low, trying to pretend he wasn't enjoying the wide-eyed way Malfoy was staring at him. "You can't honestly think
"Amazing," said Ginny, her grin spelling terrifying things for Harry's house. "You two are planning on changing into something other than
Then he leapt. Harry was knocked back onto his bed, and Ritchie's mouth seemed suddenly very close and
Harry chanced a glance at Hermione, who had schooled her face into that of a woman who would not be badmouthing her future in-laws, no matter how annoying they were.
"Thank you," said Harry, pulling himself to his feet. "For the tea. I'm so sorry I haven't done more —"
. It made Harry feel strange, exciting; like Sirius was there with him, eighteen and drunk too, kicking his feet and sticking two fingers up at his family.
"So many reasons," said Harry, sighing. He watched a plastic bag as it drifted across their path, an eddying ghost. "All those expectations. Everyone's opinions. The complete lack of boundaries. The photographers, the hungry journalists. And sometimes — sometimes people are angry at me. For not killing him faster. For not saving someone they loved."
"A jolly old time, I'm sure," he said, and Hermione gave him a smile back that was definitely forced.
to describe to you how different this is," said Malfoy. He cast a pointed look at the fluorescent lighting, and Harry laughed.
Harry stuck his head around the door. Malfoy was shivering over the toilet, damp with sweat. The room smelled of vodka and bile.
Draco was still hard, pressed wetly against Harry's t-shirt; if Harry was terrifying, Draco didn't seem to mind.
"You're a dick, Harry Potter," he said, but he was smiling now, and Harry grinned and flopped sideways onto the grass again.
"Too right," said Dean. "Besides, Harry, you can trust an addict even less than you can trust a Malfoy. Why'd he spin you this sob story, anyway? Sure he doesn't just think you're a soft touch?"
Time stopped when Draco's palm cupped him through his boxers. When Draco slid a hand in to free his cock from the cotton, Harry thought his heart would stop too. Then Draco was sliding away from his lips, shimmying down the bed with his hands on Harry's chest, slipping lower, gripping his hips with bruising fingertips.
the Pamphlets?" said Malfoy, inspecting the runes with interest. "She's actually mad. This is a madhouse."
They trudged up the familiar route to Gryffindor tower and trudged up the stairs to their own not-so-familiar dorm rooms. There were seven beds in this room, a few more than Harry and Ron were used to. Dean was already there talking to their new classmates.
But before she could say any of them, Draco flung himself down the stairs and into a hug, forcing Harry to take a step back to avoid Pansy as she staggered back.
"If I thought every day was going to be like this I'd top myself," said Malfoy, glaring at his knees. Harry winced; Malfoy noticed.
"You're kind of the opposite, Malfoy," said Harry. "You've been through all kinds of hell and you're still here."
known Sirius was a weak point that Voldemort would exploit, and Harry had fallen for it anyway. Why couldn't Dumbledore have just
"From the man on Diagon," he murmured, a faint smile playing across his lips. "Mother used to get me one of these every Christmas. I think I had every type, but this one was always my favourite."
"Got some nice hats, scarves and coats here," said John in a loud, clear voice, to a crowd that developed surprisingly quickly. "You know the rules — one item of each, take only what you need and leave the rest for others. Form an orderly queue and Harry here will be able to help you out."
"Ah," said Luna, apparently oblivious to the tension. "Yes. I suppose it ties in with what you said about Bubotubers. It's hard to feel safe while your lover is with someone else if you don't feel like you deserve them in the first place."
"Have you got any more?" said Malfoy, looking like he was trying not to seem too interested. Harry snorted.
Malfoy stared. Harry smirked, and licked the tail end of the scar where it trailed off just below his navel. Draco's eyelids lowered.
Malfoy stopped looking embarrassed and started looking endearingly confused. Harry hadn't realised just how readable Malfoy could be; it was a trait he appreciated in a person.
Cho, apparently, still had a thing for him, which Harry found a bit mysterious at that point considering he'd had time to reflect on just how generally useless he was when it came to romance. She asked him outside to talk, and she was so pretty, the lamplight shining off her hair in a soft halo, her body angled towards him, and it seemed at least half the party thought they might be a good idea. But Harry was too drunk to kiss someone, and if he hadn't been too drunk… he didn't want Cho. Something was missing there, some depth of connection Harry craved, that he already knew they didn't have.
Malfoy stood where he was for a long time. Dean paid him no attention until Malfoy, eventually, jerked forward.
"I like that explanation," said Harry, thinking of how actually, he certainly didn't want to sleep with Ginny, and had there been any girl he could actually imagine sleeping with? Not there were any boys, either, he'd certainly never thought of
He looked away. Harry wanted to touch him, felt the warmth of Malfoy's fingers around his wrist like a brand.
In the drawing room, Draco settled on the sofa and Pansy curled up beside him immediately, head on his shoulder and legs up on the seat. Harry remembered that they'd always been clingy, but he didn't remember a time when it had truly annoyed him. In school, it had been Hermione who'd hated her.
We're making our way to the kitchens with damp hair and fresh clothes side by side. Once we get there I show Harry where everything is and he surprisingly knew what it all did so I didn't have to explain it. We both decided on making brownies and honey scones. We worked extremely well as a team and moved as if we've been doing this for years. We would talk about anything and everything, and I learned new things about Harry I hadn't ever known. Like how all his clothes aren't actually his, they're hand me downs from his over weight cousin.
She just meets my eyes with warmth. "I don't think of you differently Draco. I will always be there for you when you need help, and I'm happy you trust me enough to tell me."
I aim him a soft smile and explain how we're going to meet Ron, Hermione, Neville and Harry and tell him a run down of what they looked like. I finally make my way to the compartments and check to see if any of them are in one and much to my delight I find Harry and Ron.
He cast the counter spells for whatever dark curse made the injury on my sternum, and my once bated breath turned into half choked sobs that wracked my whole body. The gaping ripped up flesh once absolutely grotesque and hideous, knitted back together into it’s original flawless pale canvas. The only hint to what it had once been is the faintest seam of nearly invisible white scar tissue.
I grin from under my invisibility cloak gifted to me by Dumbledoor if Draco is to be believed, and I feel my heart beat fast. I had taken to going out and wandering the halls at night while Ron and Neville sleep, and Draco is nowhere to be seen. I knew that if I went to the kitchens I would see him and always made my way down there once I finished sneaking around. It wasn't long before my thoughts of finding something new turned to what happened a few months ago. The year felt as though it had gone as fast as it came, and soon it wouldn't be much longer until the train taking me back to Surrey would leave the station with me in it. And even with that thought in mind I couldn't find it in myself to worry about my situation when all my anxiety was for Draco. Ever since that night Draco was never quite the same.
Harry's emerald eyes are so big and worried that I can't look him in the eye, or anyone for that matter. "No nothing like that Neville I'm just not very.... Strong I guess is the word. I'm not good during stressful situations physically or anything that's extremely emotionally draining."
"Don't worry he has us to help him. We are stronger together so don't loose hope or happiness, because everything will turn out fine. We'll all be stronger by the end of this. So don't loose sight of the friendship between us."
He immediately shuts his mouth with an audible click as Severus gives a deep chuckle. I give him a smile as I leave his embrace and he informs us that we should let Draco rest here until he wakes up. We all nod knowing he will be in safe hands with the dour potions professor and we all made our goodbyes to our sleeping friend.
Everyone was very understanding and volunteered to join him in meditating if he felt it would help, and he agreed quickly. From there we all began to tell Draco of what had been going on before moving on to playing a few games in our common room while he read a book Dobby brought for him. He had to write down what book he wanted and I had to ask Dobby. Even if he was reading he was practically glued to my side and deep down I really liked that he felt safe around me. So I put an arm around him so he'd be more comfortable and played games with my other hand, which he blushed at but curled up into me anyways.
Harry, Ron and Neville are all showing different levels of anxiety and it makes me acknowledge the reasons for it. Neville, because he's never given anything with the intent of hoping he likes it. Anything his grandma gifts him is a reminder of how incompetent he is or how different he is from his parents. Note to self, get him a wand.
"That's incredible I've only ever heard of that happening with extremely powerful wizards that are attuned very closely with their magic."
H:[don't worry I've got you now. You'll be alright okay? I'm taking you to Severus' classroom. Not much farther now!]
I raise my eyebrows filled with disbelief. He can't mean, actually telling me right? I place my quill back to the journal once the ink fades.
"I won't let that happen. I'm going to do everything in my power to stop this curse and give you guys your rightful bodies back. I promise. You guys will not be stuck like this forever.... not if I can help it. So don't worry about me leaving because of that. I won't leave until everything is set back to how it should be. You have my word as a knight Draco, everyone here does."
Hermione asks and I just tell her it's a silencing spell so that the teacher is more comfortable. Harry though is staring at Lupin and I could understand why. He wants to know this person who was a good friend of his parents. So we began to talk softly amongst each other and I brought out the snacks much to everyone's excitement. We were only halfway when the train stopped and with it so did my heart.
The quiet room being pierced by the shattering of ceramic mugs that I flung to the ground in my desperation to do something. The need to destroy something wether it be a random object or myself was an urge so strong I knew if I didn't grab something quickly it would not end well for me. So I had gripped the mug perched innocently on the counter next to me after wildly throwing myself at it. Clenching it in a bruising hold before smashing it shakily from the pent up nerves.
It only took a few minutes until we reached the castle and there was a huge crowd of people there just waiting and cheering at the sight of us. I hear a loud,
It took everything in me to just whisper, "the loosing side." His breath hitches and he buries me closer into his chest as if he can protect me from the things that had already happened.
She leaves with a bounce in her step and Tonks jaw drops, as my face blushes. Tonks turns to me saying,
"I'm afraid neither of us are quiet normal compared to everyone else Tom. And I'm frankly upset that we can't meet in real life. All the things we could create together."
"I'm so sorry....... I don't want you to get hurt anymore! Don't go back there please. I'm so sorry I can't help you."
I bolt upright gasping and clutching my chest covered in sweat, I look around but I'm not in the cells at the manor being cursed as punishment for not killing Dumbledoor, I'm in the dorm. I'm safe. It was just a dream. I swallow feeling as though my throat is sore from screaming but I don't see anyone moving or awake thankfully. I decide to get up and shower to rid myself of the sweat making my clothes stick to me. So I gather some fresh clothes and my toiletry bag quietly and head to the showers. After scrubbing myself down with my chocolate scrub and washing my hair with my mint shampoo and conditioner I dry off. I dress in fresh clothes and fix my appearance after brushing my teeth. Then I make my way down to the kitchens to see if I might be able to convince the house elves to let me bake some stuff and help them with breakfast later since it's only three in the morning.
I felt guilt, horror, and relief all mixed up in my gut before I passed out. The next thing I knew I was being awoken by fingers carding through my hair softly and I couldn't help but smile at this. I blinked my eyes open and I was met with Ron laying his head on Miones shoulder as they sat on a transfigured armchair together sleeping.
Mother purchased the wand for 10 galleons and leaves quickly, so I follow after thanking Olivander and saying farewell. Once I'm outside I see mother narrowing her eyes at me and very coldly she asks me, "did you just thank him?" I had never before seen my mother act like this. It made me nervous and unsteady so all I could do was whisper, "yes". Her eyes hardened and she said, "finish getting your supplies, and do not thank people who are below us do you understand? I don't know how your father and I got stuck with you." And with that she turned sharply and left me standing there, abandoning me outside the wand shop. I look at my shoes and give myself a minute to calm the emotion swirling inside me and accept the consequences, when I feel a warm comforting hand on my shoulder. I look up to see Mr. Olivander smile sadly, and I understand what he's trying to say, "you're welcome to come here anytime you need to." I smile at him and thank him once more, then head off to get my robes.
After Dumbledoors announcements and warnings of the third floor and forbidden forest the feast began. Everyone enjoyed the food and happy atmosphere but I couldn't help but be disconnected from it all, I would flinch at loud yells, laughter, and fast movements, always reaching for my wand out of reflex. I tried to do my best but everyone noticed anyways. I was extremely happy to note that all five of us were now close friends. All throughout dinner I couldn't bring myself to eat much and nibbled on some mashed potatoes and juice as everyone else ate their fill. After dinner we were all lead to the dorm where the prefects gave us the password, "chocolate frogs". We all got settled and ready for bed, and soon everyone was sleeping soundly as I stay awake thinking of what tomorrow would bring. I knew I would either be getting a howller meaning a reprimand and public embarrassment, or I would get an official Malfoy letter telling me I'm being disowned when morning came. If I get disowned hopefully I can convince uncle Sev to let me stay with him during the summer and I'll have to ask Dobby to bring me the picnic basket as well if he can. I sigh and try to meditate to calm me down and soon find myself slipping into sleep.
He asks while piping filling on tiny little macaroon tops. I just bring a stool over next to him and plop down as I retell what I just stumbled upon. He pauses and thinks for a few minutes and goes.
I knew he would know which one. And by the crestfallen expression on his face I was correct. He bit his lip and set his shoulders back before giving me a warning look and casting the counter curse. My hand squeezed his in a signal that I was ready and once I was hit with it, it felt almost reminiscent to a crucio that stayed in only one specific spot.
He begins to cry and nods before popping out of existence. After a few moments the curtains open and Harry shows up looking like a nervous wreck.
I ask but he just hangs his head resting it against my shoulder, his hands going under my arms and resting on the back of my shoulder blades. It was a much more secure and intimate type of hug, that had me cradling his head as he let out a few sniffles and tears.
"I would be honored if you helped me and those living here in finding a solution, but I hope you know that you don't have to. Don't feel obligated to do this just because we helped you."
"Sev I need to tell you something and it's dangerous. Just what ever you do don't yell at me please and just wait until I'm done......... Okay I- there's no easy way of saying this. I'm from the future. I came back in time to help and save people who died, to save mother."
The note makes me still with unease unsure of just what I have lost.A knock at the door brings me out of my thoughts only to hear her voice, "Draco today we are getting you supplies so hurry up." But something is wrong, that's not her voice. I open the door to see my mother standing tall and stern, it makes the uneasy feeling return twice as hard. "Hello mother how are you today? Did you sleep well?" I smile at her and go to hug her when she steps back from me looking as if I was a house elf. "How many times must I tell you not to touch me? It will wrinkle my clothes. Now go eat we need to leave."
“That's like saying every brunette is evil because Voldemort was brunette. Or that French is evil because Voldemort could speak French. And he could by the way, every pure blood or wanna be pure blood does. Though not many choose to learn Spanish, I did, just because I think it sounds nicer.”
And this is what brought me to my problem at the moment. There, by the trees facing outside the window I was looking out of, was Cedric. Iv'e been tailed by him for the past hour through town and I could feel it in my bones that today he was going to do something to me whether I wanted to or not. I looked out the dusty window and the predatory look in his eyes proved that gut feeling. I looked around but no one was this far out where the library was located, and to get back to the bustling part of the village, where my house was, I'd have to walk past him.
Sev just scoffs and unbuttons my shredded shirt to reveal the four gashes on my shoulder and collar bone making it look more like minced meat when adding the troll injury. Harry grabs my hand and I feel glad to have both of them to help and comfort me. Sev quietly cleans up the blood and seals it with a spell making me unconsciously squeeze Harry's hand. As Sev dabs ditanny, Harry softly cleans my face of what I'm guessing are stray drops of blood with the warm wash cloth before he cleans my red hands.
"That my friends is Blaise Zabini, Slytherins ice prince, I think I caught his eye and we have a complicated relationship. He isn't bad honest, he's just in a very bad spot and has to pretend to be something he isn't. He's a friend. But no one other than us can know this do you understand, this is very serious and if people find out we're friends it's not going to be pretty. So can you guys keep this a secret please?"
So we make our way to transfiguration on time and as I pass McGonagall in her cat form I wish her a good morning, before we make our way to some seats together. Harry and I sit in the third row all the way to the left as partners. Neville to my left with another Gryffindor, and Ron and Hermione sit in front of Harry and I. As class begins McGonagall turns back into her human form and everyone gasps and murmurs all while she looks at me with a sparkle in her eye. As the lesson goes on she has us do very simple exercises. Our first lesson was changing the color of a button. I naturally did it with ease and since I was getting bored I changed the button in the sequence of the rainbow one color after the other. McGonagall saw and her eyes lit up from excitement.
"Draco I really don't know what to say or how to put it all into words but I just, thank you. I don't want to mess this up and I don't want to be a jerk to people and I don't know if I hate muggles, I just don't know anything. But I can't be nice to you in public and I don't want to loose my only chance at having a real friend if I say something out of line. I just don't want to loose this or hurt you. You're the first person to notice and care enough to see what's happening, and then you reach out to me after I said horrible things to you. I'm so sorry Draco."
I begin telling them about Harry and when we would see him next just out of habit of now having some one to talk to. He doesn't seem to mind either and I make sure to not say anything if he seems tired or when he's sleeping. Our time together is mostly spent next to one another as I read some books on horcruxes I found in the manor library. I had to research how to move the piece of Voldemort inside harry out of his body so he wouldn't have to sacrifice himself, or risk dying like last time.
They all nodded but glanced at each other and looked determined, for what I don't know but it's better than them being upset. We all head back to do our potions homework, with me helping the others out on some things until Its time for my meeting with Sev. Once I see it's time for me to go I tell them that I'm not sure when I'll be back.
I smirk and shake my head. "Mmmm no I can just apparate to your home." He raises his eyebrow and his eyes brighten.
And I didn't care to find out I'd been expelled from school for preforming magic outside of Hogwarts so I grabbed my stuff as quickly as I could and got on the knight train. It was an experience I hoped I didn't have to go through again despite how much fun it was after a few minutes. Once I was able to make it to the Leaky cauldron someone came up to me, saying they were Fudge, and that I would have to stay in the leaky cauldron for now. I was not expelled from Hogwarts and to just enjoy my time while the ministry took care of the accidental magic. I didn't oppose and now found myself with a full three weeks of no Dursley's!
That line of thinking was put to an abrupt pause when a howl caught my attention and I looked up to see a raining dark sky. Trying not to panic I kept walking hoping to any deity to help me as I clutched an accidentally stolen library book to my chest. It was only a few minutes until I was thoroughly soaked and hearing a wolf howl some ways behind me.  I gasped while making a run for it. My heart was beating so loudly and now was one of the few times I cursed at having more muscle to lug around. All I could hear were my boots thumping on the wet ground as I ran as fast as I possibly could.
As the weeks continued he was such a main part of my life that I couldn't imagine not having him in it. It made me continue my search for a cure despite the sad affection in Draco's eyes that persisted the closer we got to his birthday. I couldn't handle looking at the resigned glimmer in those wonderful silver eyes the more time passed.
By the time the others got back I was sitting on a stool in the kitchen as Draco twirled around making whatever crossed his mind. Most of my time was spent guessing what it would be based on the ingredients and little hints he dropped. But I failed and it was surreal hearing him "laugh" in my mind. It wasn't so much that I heard a laugh but it was more of like a soft tinkling of a bell, so quiet, that I wanted to hear it all the time. It took me only a few seconds to figure out what it meant and my heart beat picked up at the realization.
I just laugh along with him but get a sinking feeling when Dobby came back practically crying. Draco got up quickly as Dobby said,
Draco was sitting quietly, thinking about what I'd just said when the food appeared in front of us. He gracefully ignored how I jumped at the food and gave me a nod before saying,
Zabini looks close to tears and not a second later the doors are bursting open with a group of Gryffindors clamoring inside. They see Malfoy on the bed and it's like they were in a funeral. Harry rushes over eyes wet and takes a hold of the boys hand before giving Zabini a nod of greeting.
"Alright I admit I like him okay?! Just please stop Pansy, he would never like me in that way anyways. I mean look at me I'm not even human! He's so nice and caring already too-but-I-I'm just........ I'm just a weak person trapped in a dragons body Pansy. What on earth could he even like about me? Besides, I doubt he would even like me enough for the curse to break and I'm not going to manipulate him into liking me either."
I reach into my pocket and take out a small package. His eyes widen and he accepts the package after saying I shouldn't have, and my own assurances of me wanting to get him something. His elegant fingers unwrapped it and when he sees it he smiles warmly at me. I just smile and say,
He seems to be trembling and I find myself confiding in him, "I miss you too Harry. I miss you all. I promise it'll all end up okay. Just remember to keep Siren with you. She will be of help to you later."
I can't lie to him, I just can't. Not to Blaise. Maybe its because he's like me in so many ways it would be like lying to my past self. But I know I can trust him. I know it deep inside, because he needs someone who trusts him and I will not betray that trust. I would have been devastated if I were to have finally gotten someone who cares about me and then they don't trust me enough to lie to my face. So I know what I have to do.
"I realise now that there are a vast spectrum of evils humans will visit upon each other, when given half a chance, and I intend never to disbelieve a victim of it again. Or do the evil."
Harry looked at Hermione's dear face, soft and worried and safe. He thought about how much she loved him. He ground his teeth and stared into a nearby bush, working up the courage to say it.
"Got shoes in an eight?" asked a young man with two missing front teeth, strolling up to the box and giving it a kick.
"Harry," he murmured, soft as silk. Harry groaned around his mouthful, and Draco's hands tightened sharply in his hair.
"Yeah," agreed Ginny, pulling a face, "I'm no fan of Malfoy, but what kind of person looks at a washed-up little snot like that and goes 'ooh, I know, let's give him some horrible Muggle poison drug'?"
"Potter, I hate you," he said again, which Harry was beginning to suspect actually meant 'Potter, you're right and I'm angry about it.'
It didn't feel like half an hour. It felt much longer and much shorter at once. Shev was right, though, the shading did hurt less — it was almost satisfying, burning warmth running up his wrist.
"Yes, well, glad I could help, but you're rearranging the beans in an unwelcome manner," he said, looking at Harry's position beside him.
"On an unrelated subject, do you think we could talk somewhere later?" whispered Harry, pulling her closer.
"You're very famous. You own property in central London. You're the heir to the ancestral Black home," said Malfoy. "And
He turned around and walked out of the shop, slightly dazed, with a strange feeling bubbling in his chest. Malfoy ran to catch up with him in a huff.
cool — but seeing it laid out here in such a teenage fashion, so deliberately constructed, made it so much less mysterious.
charge rent," said Seamus, making himself at home on one of the drawing room beanbags. "Have you any idea how much I was asked to pay for a
"Trains," she translated. "He's absolutely obsessed with them. He's got toy dragons, toy Hippogriffs, little Quidditch figures that actually fly, toy blocks, picture books that sing a song… but no, what he loves right now is his plastic Muggle train set. Just like his grandfather."
"Little known fact about me," said Harry, and winked at the girl, who actually blushed. "Um, custom I think, unless you have any lilies, and not too big. Er, on my wrist."
"I suppose I should be grateful that Great Auntie Walburga isn't here to blast me off too," said Malfoy after a moment, slim fingers tracing the line that led to the Malfoy family.
Harry grinned and tugged at his pyjama bottoms, somewhat short in the leg nowadays, before descending to a squat on the hearth.
"Oh no," said the shopkeeper, grinning at Harry. He was kind of attractive up close, a bit older than Harry but still in his twenties, with deep hazel eyes and cheekbones to rival Malfoy's. "I think your housemates will hate your new collection. Barring the Basement Jaxx album, that's pretty banging."
"First of all, he's in a bad way. He's sick, and he's got nowhere else to go, and he could do with some… positive influences, you know?"
"Thanks," said Draco against his lips, reaching behind Harry to push the plunger. Harry blinked, dazed with lust, and Draco smirked at him.
"Obviously I wouldn't keep the profits," said Draco offhandedly, leaning over to inspect his handiwork inside the carrier bag.
"She's her own," Ron corrected, sternly but still with that wry smile, and Hermione's face went all soft and shy, and then it was
"Honestly, I think it'd be hilarious," said Ron. "Malfoy in the lion's den. He'd be scared shitless the whole time."
"I don't care how good you think I'd look in it, I am not putting on any of that weird rave gear." Harry folded his arms, looking stern over his glasses.
"I have come to apologise," said Harry. "I am a terrible boyfriend, and I don't mind if you hate me for it, and I wish it could be different because I want the best for you. And I know I love you... Like a sister."
Neville had stopped in the corridor by the front door, side-on to Harry, his hands tucked into his pockets and his eyes fixed on Malfoy. Malfoy looked short next to him, wide-eyed and staring as though Neville were a troll in the dungeon rather than a human man.
they hurt, he didn't know anything at all. It was probably one of the more ridiculous things he'd ever done.
Harry wasn't entirely sure where that left him. He didn't think he wanted anyone he knew, and he didn't know how to meet someone he might want. He didn't even know what that someone would look like, what kind of person they'd be.
"Oh you would say that," said Seamus, "Weren't you dating the Tutshill Tornados' biggest fan that year?"
He went to see Teddy every week of December, and Teddy was almost uncontrollably excited for the entire month. He babbled at Harry with enthusiasm, showing him the decorations, pointing at his Christmas-themed picture book, ostentatiously inspecting underneath the tree for 'pesents'. Andromeda's decor was classy, her Christmas tree pristine and traditional in silver and gold, the whole thing held together with some impressive charmwork to prevent Teddy from dismantling it. The baubles had tiny Christmas scenes floating inside them: Hogsmeade in the snow, the Northern Lights over mountains, tiny house-elves singing silent carols.
"Here, put your arm here," said Shev, pulling an armrest out and covering it with paper. "I'm going to hold you down a bit, but try not to move too much anyway. Breathe deep, and if you need a break, let me know. It's not a big job, half an hour maybe. I'll do the outline first, that's the bit that will hurt more so we'll get that out of the way. After that, the shading will be easy."
"Labouring," said Malfoy, looking up from his book to stare at it, as though it were some sort of cypher.
"Ellie lost her father," Shev added, drawing her first sweeping line up his arm. "Ten years ago. My husband."
, Potter, drop them, because I'm going to do what I have to do and you can't stop me. If you've got any sense you won't even try, because if you do you'll get hurt, and I'll be happy to do it."
"One of my housemates. Can't figure him out. He's got the face of a sixty year old and the body of a twenty-year-old, and he has a habit of sitting around in his pants all day like he's not in the company of six other people at all times. Nice enough though."
"I'm going to pour another drink," he said. He curled into an armchair, trying not to think, humming to the music and drinking until he slept, flung out over the arm of the sofa.
the article," said Harry, rolling his eyes for comic effect and pulling Malfoy up to standing. "Follow me in the papers, do you?"
"Given that I have no money or resources to buy my own food at this present moment, Potter, it doesn't feel like I have much of a choice."
"That's quite alright," said Malfoy, doing his polite voice, and his eyes-down, pinched look was what pushed Harry forward.
"Dear God," said Harry, rubbing his face. There was another long pause, Harry's eyes tracing the snake embroidery on the bedspread in a loop.
exactly, but every day Harry would wander about the house until he found a new thing to fix or clean or tidy. Then he would summon Kreacher for advice or tools, and Kreacher would complain about Harry's aversion to using magic, and then Harry would settle into working on whatever it was until it was done. There was something peaceful about the repetition of a manual task; even scrubbing the grout in the bathrooms with a toothbrush felt more meditative than boring.
It surprised Harry how the fear rose in him. The book had warned him about relapse. It told him to keep his expectations in check. But Harry's fluttering heart hadn't got the message.
It was nice, at least, to chill out for a little bit. He scrubbed his underarms thoroughly, then kicked back and dozed for an hour or so. He did have to make sure, after all.
"Well?" said Draco, after a minute, tilting his head to look at Harry. "Alright, fine, I'll start. Do you have any
"Can you think of someone you want to dress like? Someone you think is cool?" said Luna. "That's how I decide. My mum was ever so sparkly, and she never wore anything like anyone else I know. I dress like her, mostly. It makes me happy."
It was kind of true — he had a small pile of owls he'd been studiously ignoring. But it still felt like running away.
Ginny looked up at her, smiling. From anyone else, Ginny would have taken that as an attack, but it was impossible to take a question from Luna as anything but earnest.
"Er," said Harry, filled with a sudden and passionate curiosity, but suspecting tattoos to be the last thing Malfoy wanted to look at right now. But Malfoy had stopped, transfixed, staring at a design. It was a skull, but from the eye sockets burst bright flowers, lilies and roses and curling leaves in a trailing halo all around it.
After the storm, the weather turned hot and bright again, and Harry began to spend more time in loose-limbed, sweat-damp work in the Grimmauld garden. With Neville and occasionally Ginny's help, Harry broke through weeds and brambles, peeling back each section to find exciting new treasures: a patio, a broken-down shed, an ornate birdbath.
"Yes. When I was made to. I did it. I wasn't very good at it. I don't — I don't really want to hurt people. I know you might not believe me, given that I
Malfoy's hand felt unnaturally cool. Harry started at the point of contact, trying to remember if they'd ever touched before, outside of throwing a punch. It came to him in a rush — Fiendfyre, Draco clinging to him, heat and noise and desperate panic —
"I'm unlikely to ever like you, Malfoy," said Neville, cutting him off. "I accepted your apology for the things you did
"So you've never desperately wanted to fuck someone you loathe?" said Draco, pushing him back into the bush a little with his hips, smirk playful.
"Right," said Harry again, getting up, making Malfoy dip awkwardly as the pressure on the beanbag changed. Malfoy scowled; Harry threw a smirk over his shoulder as he left the drawing room, and Malfoy's face did something strange in response, and then Harry was flooding with inexplicable heat as he fled.
Harry decided it was time to clean the study that day. He left the door open as he worked, trying to pretend to himself that it wasn't transparently obvious he was waiting by the front door. The study was nice, all gleaming wood panels and a leather-topped desk, well-maintained now that Kreacher and Harry worked together on the house. Kreacher himself came to check on him at lunch time, handing him a rag and the wood polish with a look that was far too knowing.
"You can't say that about Muggles, Thomas," said Malfoy, and Harry thought he sounded kind of snide rather than funny, but Dean huffed a laugh anyway.
"Big words from someone who did three times as much and made it look easy," said Malfoy, not meeting his eye.
"Er, Harry?" said Ritchie. "Thanks. For using that spray, I mean. I mean, if you hadn't, I wouldn't have... well, I would never have got up the courage to tell anyone, and..."
"I'm not looking to judge. I'd want to be out of my mind too. I don't even want to be in my own mind half the time. Come on, we're not going to murder you."
house, what they've done is painted up a warehouse. I'm pretty sure they stole the carpets out of a skip, there are bizarre art installations everywhere, and the whole place is heated with a pot belly stove that seems dubiously safe. And I'm not entirely convinced anyone in residence actually pays to use the building."
"Seamus Finnegan!" shouted a voice from the second floor; Ginny poked her head out of Luna's window. "You better have a
"Malfoy…" he kept his voice low and gentle, like soothing an angry Hippogriff. "I told you, I don't blame you and I don't judge you. I just don't want to see you lose control, not when you've come so far."
"Har har, no." Hermione rested one hip against the table, leaning the sandwich-filled hand on the table beside Ron. Ron took the opportunity to snatch it back from Hermione's loosened grip, grinning.
"Much to my surprise, I miss them too," said Draco, slumping against the van. "Who would have thought?"
"Oh, come on, Potter, come and talk if you want to," he said, nodding up to his bedroom. Harry's heart raced, the promise of Draco's bedroom loaded with something else now that Harry felt the weight of all the longing in his chest.
Harry slept fitfully that night, strange dreams of running and spiders and Malfoy screaming his name, pale and pinched, blood pouring from his chest. He woke with a start at the sound of the upper staircase creaking.
Malfoy flinched at his tone, and Harry's anger dissipated into icy shame. He looked at Draco for a long time, tension snapping a pulse along his jaw. He didn't want to see Draco's face like that, but he couldn't go to the group. He
He could have stayed, but he said his goodbyes shortly after, and spent Christmas night crying hot, uncontrollable tears into his pillow.
Harry, Ron and Hermione all winced, and Ginny pulled a guilty face, but it was undeniably true. True, and desperately sad. He lived in Weasley jumpers and plain shirts and supermarket jeans. He had holes in everything. He still owned things that had once belonged to a twelve-year-old Dudley.
"It looks good on you." Malfoy set his arm back down on the table. "A lot of the guys at work have tattoos. One of them said the Mark was
After being plied on all sides with offers of desserts, Harry thought he had quite outstayed his welcome. He shuddered to think what Hermione would say if she saw him. He accepted a final basket of chicken sandwiches, and with a wary glance at the map – which he'd never be able to check and carry the basket at the same time – he donned his cloak and set off back to Gryffindor tower.
Harry wanted a drink, but now that Malfoy was here, he knew he'd have to brave the dining room to get it. Still, he felt better now, and he wasn't honestly sure if downstairs might be more on his level — virtually everyone else was down there. In contrast, Blaise and Padma sounded like they were debating magical physics by the fireplace and looking thrilled about it. Ernie had managed to corner Hermione to talk politics. Lavender was sitting on the rug trying to persuade a giggling Parvati to eat something, and Neville and Hannah were in the corner, kissing. Malfoy lingered at Blaise's side, eyes vacant and the corner of his mouth downturned.
When they left the bathroom, the door was shut, and Hermione was nowhere to be seen. Malfoy, eagle-eyed now that the alcohol had gone, immediately went to poke at the printer.
Harry woke up the next morning, emerging from nightmares he couldn't remember. A bleakness fell over him, the kind that usually meant a day in bed without the energy or desire to do anything at all but stare and doze. They happened sometimes, but less than they used to. Harry had become accustomed to it, knew what to do when it happened — he'd accept Kreacher's haphazard but determined care, do what he was told, and wait it out.
"No, of course not," he said. "I'm just saying that this, the agoraphobia stuff… isn't helping. And I'd like her to respect that."
"I see," said Slughorn, eyes softening as they came to rest upon him, and Harry wanted to vomit. "Well, my boy, perhaps you can bond in a more
They sipped at their tea. Harry wondered if it would be okay, if it would make sense, to pat the hand that Ginny had left resting on the table.
Draco's face went through a complicated shift of emotions before settling on dark-eyed lust. He pulled Harry close again, and for a long moment Harry lost himself in the kiss, the feel of Draco's bare chest, the silk of his hair under Harry's fingers.
Malfoy, as he'd done every night since Luna asked, joined them for dinner. He looked well today. His polite conversation flashed with genuine pleasure. It was nice — it felt good. Even though Malfoy had decided he would always hate Harry, Harry knew he'd done a good thing. And he was sure the others wouldn't vote to kick him out now. They liked him, tentatively, and he seemed to like them.
"Trust me, that's no good thing," said Draco darkly. "Have the council still not found you a place?"
Malfoy took a deep breath, but he still looked grey. Harry considered him, wondering what it was that was bothering him, specifically. He'd said it was different from his experience with the Dark Mark, he'd encouraged Harry to say yes, so it couldn't be the principle of the thing. Wet, black ink was oozing from his freshly drawn lines, but it was hardly gory — he couldn't even see the needles. He wondered if it were about the pain. God knows they'd all seen too much torture.
"Hi, John," said Hermione. She strode forward, holding out her hand to the friendly looking older man. "Got another willing victim."
"Making us coffee." He gave Draco a slow, curving smile. Draco smirked back, slipped forward into the circle of Harry's arms. Kissed him, long and slow and possessive, until Harry had forgotten all about the cafetière steaming gently on the side.
"Without telling you? I don't want to watch my girlfriend go insane over my best friend. Or my sister, to be honest." he pulled a face. Hermione smiled.
Harry, too, felt like he was fixing up by degrees; the lights and sounds of the pub slowly stopped bothering him, and he hardly ever touched his wand at the sight of a strangely dressed customer in Tesco anymore. But sometimes, for no reason he could fathom, something dark and terrible would still set upon him, some nameless fear that whispered
"I'm aware I'm describing a squat," said Draco, scowling as though Harry had said something insulting. "But honestly, it's rather nice. Very artistic. I sleep on a
"Well he said you were living with a dodgy bloke who dealt drugs, but I don't think he knows you were
," said Harry. "Everyone does. Even Voldemort did, if he'd been a happy child maybe none of this would have happened. Misery is never the answer. Misery just creates more of itself. We deserve to be
"You try," Draco murmured, and Harry raised his hands and tried to copy. Malfoy huffed a laugh. Harry glared at him.
Harry tried not to think too much about any charming sober arty types, and whether Luna thought they'd be a good match in any other ways. Draco, mercifully, didn't seem to notice Harry's inner turmoil.
The kitchen was at its fullest on a Thursday morning, as Dean and Luna both had to be up for work that day, and Seamus usually arrived home from his last night shift hungry at the same time as everyone came down for breakfast. Harry decided to make pancakes today, listening to the background chatter of his friends and trying to let it soothe him though his eyes were prickly from his poor night's sleep.
He was making himself a cup of tea in the kitchen when he heard the front door shut, and as he snuck up the kitchen stairs he told himself he
Harry took a step, caught Draco by the elbow and tugged him towards the bed. Then he flopped down onto the mattress on one elbow in a manner that Harry hoped conveyed 'comfortable conversation' and not 'flailing idiot', or worse, 'very bad come-on'.
Seamus grinned back at him, and Harry had a sudden flash of panic. Seamus was provocative by nature, and Malfoy was — Harry wasn't sure what Malfoy was, but certainly up for repartee. Were they going to flirt?
"I just don't want it to be a big deal," said Harry, cringing a bit at the idea of a song and dance about it. God, would the
"I can't say I'd noticed," he said, with a smirk that was undercut by a shifty look at Ron — like maybe, actually, he had a bit.
Harry didn't follow this apparent non-sequitur. Until he realised, at which point he stopped breathing for a moment.
"I didn't give it much thought once I realised you weren't being murdered," said Luna. Ginny made a choked sound. "Besides, I don't mind. I think it's nice when someone's having fun."
Everyone looked at Luna, touched by this unexpected insight into her eccentric style. Harry took in her glittering silver pyjamas, her radish earrings, and then looked down at the catalogue. There were really only a few people he knew who dressed anything like what Harry thought of as
"Nope," said Harry, grinning, and he tried on a pair of sunglasses shaped like stars over his glasses. Malfoy folded his arms and shook his head as though to say they didn't suit him, but his lips quirked, and Harry had to resist the urge to buy them just for that.
"Fine might be a bit of a stretch," said Ron. "Thought this Malfoy redemption plan was your idea, anyway?"
"Where do you get your skin colour from?" Harry blurted. Dean looked up from his sketchbook with an expression of surprise. Harry's stomach dropped, his entire body crawling with the desire to curl in on itself and spontaneously combust.
"Oh," said Harry, glancing at the darkness beyond the window. "Actually, I think I said I'd cook tonight. I best get back."
"My liege," he said sarcastically, and to his surprise Malfoy's eyes went wide at that, scarlet flooding his cheeks. Suddenly uncomfortable with a feeling he couldn't name, Harry busied himself pulling out his wand, wordlessly summoning the milk and cups.
"Thank you," said Luna brightly, as everyone else stared, wondering if she'd somehow managed a silent Imperius.
"Very, thank you," said Luna, glancing at her vaguely before looking back to her meal. Pansy, to Harry's pleasure, looked visibly annoyed.
They found a record shop in the end, tucked in between a shop selling corsets and one selling giant flares. CDs dominated the first half of the shop, a few extremely fashionable patrons flicking through them, but the back was decorated in vinyl records from floor to ceiling, with many more boxes and racks stacked up in front.
"I've joined a group," said Ginny, collapsing into the chair beside him one February morning, her enthusiasm not at all dulled by the fact that she was still in her Quidditch gear and dripping with rain. "I think you should come."
"Not a single decent potion maker in the whole house, barring Hermione who is a sadist and thinks we won't learn to moderate our drinking if we don't suffer the consequences. Perhaps I should put out an ad for a competent potioneer."
"My pleasure," she said, grinning. "Now, I'm going to wrap it in film. You can take it off after a few hours. It's going to be pretty weepy for a bit, and then it might get a bit crusty and itchy, then the top layer of skin will start to flake off and reveal your healed tattoo." Harry glanced at Malfoy, whose slim nose was wrinkling. "It's very important that you don't itch it, that you keep it clean with water and gentle soap, and that you don't pick any flaking bits. If you're worried about it at any point, give the shop a call. Here's a printout of the care instructions because I can tell you're not going to remember all that. Okay?"
Seamus pulled a dubious face, and Harry thought of Sirius again, of drinking away everything painful and difficult. Seamus loved to drink — was that what he was doing? It didn't
"That a leaflet about sexual health and a post-it note with a list of Silencing Charms appeared on the coffee table this morning?" said Luna quietly, and Harry paused with his hand on the door handle, grinning. "I suppose it could be, but I think it seems a little unlikely."
Harry relaxed back into his chair, staring at the bare red-brick wall of the chimney breast. It wasn't
"Hermione's getting less subtle," said Harry dryly. Ron followed Harry's eyeline to the coffee table and winced.
"Oh, about an hour ago," said Luna, waving a hand. Ginny sighed, giving Harry a conspiratorial eye-roll.
so hard to get those muscles and you must be very proud, but not everyone in the universe needs to see! Have you no respect for your house guests?"
"I wasn't sure," he said, folding his arms. Then, when Harry looked skeptical, "I didn't do it as part of some heroic plan."
"Oh!" she said. "Oh, of course. I'm an idiot, of course I knew you could be bisexual, I just thought maybe that was why you and Ginny — I mean, you're not going out, but you get on so
The waiter did not look thrilled to have to seat two scruffy-looking young men in sports gear at nine o'clock at night, but his demeanour improved immensely when Harry made a show of counting the cash in his wallet and then ordered a substantial amount of food and drink for them both. Fish was quiet for a while as he ate his meal, focused in a way Harry found familiar, but once he'd finished half his curry and most of the beer he wiped his mouth on his sleeve and said, "Alright, so who are you to Draco?"
Harry bit down on the inside of his mouth in a silent attempt to prevent his brain from finishing that thought.
"I was livin' with my girlfriend at the time," said Fish, oblivious to Harry's distraction. "Above the pub, on account of her being the landlady. Because he seemed like such a soppy pushover, she said he could stay a couple of nights while he figured out what to do. He ended up helping out at the bar for a few weeks, and she chucked him food and a bit of cash. Then he met
"Elliot made it," repeated Harry. Draco gave him a sharp look. "Is that your sober friend? What's he like?"
"Fair," agreed Seamus, and Harry's whole body flushed hot with embarrassment. "It's a bit outrageous really. Not sure he's got any idea, bless him. I'm sure he has
"Hi!" a middle-aged woman greeted him. She had a stature that reminded Harry of Mrs Weasley, but a fashion sense that was more like Celestina Warbeck's, wrapped as she was in a fur jacket, tight black dress and knee-high boots. Her hair was red, too, but it didn't look natural; it matched her lipstick. Harry found himself smiling at her, even through his tension.
But that skirted uncomfortably close to thinking of Dumbledore, and his role in both their lives, and Harry tried not to focus on that too much.
me to catch you? It certainly took you a while to get rid of me this morning, and don't think I didn't feel –"
"Me? Ha! You're too proud to admit you're only doing all this because you want to fuck me," muttered Malfoy. His grey eyes sparked, dared him to deny it.
. So I grabbed what little I owned and went back to Jen's pub. They told me he was a nasty piece of work and a prick and Fish even offered to smash his head in, and for a moment they made me feel like I was maybe not entirely deserving of what I'd got. But then he turned up with flowers again, and he promised that he'd book himself into anger management, and that he'd never felt this way about anyone or anything, all the things he started out saying… and I was too exhausted to say no. I didn't
"Because it hurts," he muttered. One strand of hair was falling in his eyes; Harry wanted to push it back. "Here in front of
Downstairs, the coat rack had expanded to fit each person's coats. Walburga's portrait was gone, swallowed back into the wall, as though it were never there. The space wasn't obviously bigger, but it
"So, you marry Ginny," he said, one hand gesturing wide. The other remained firmly on Harry's hip, nails digging into his flesh, pleasantly possessive. "I'm sure your wedding would be very romantic. You'd probably be the youngest Head Auror ever or some such thing, and Ginny would win the World Cup, and you'd both end up having at least three babies that would be substantially raised by someone other than the pair of you. They would probably grow up to be entitled little rich brats, just like I was." He put a hand to his heart in mock-affection for Harry's imaginary children.
"It's been like this all afternoon," said Ron, raising an eyebrow as Harry sat down beside him. "Hermione showed him her papers and that was it."
"I just don't think you should go to Paris," said Harry, and Draco's face twisted into a sneer so familiar it slammed Harry back to a time when he would have been happy to hex Malfoy in the face.
Harry looked at Draco. Draco looked at the soup. A skinny older man in a Christmas hat looked between them both expectantly, until Draco seemed to remember what he was doing there and dished out another cup.
Harry considered backing out of volunteering a hundred ways, but he couldn't think of a way that wouldn't make Hermione disappointed in him. But the evening stroll with Hermione was nice, at the very least, and the soup run itself wasn't at all what he expected. He supposed he'd been imagining something more polished than three middle-aged ladies and a round-bellied older man loitering at the back of a van.
But then Malfoy had downed his second drink and shoved the cup into Harry's unresisting hands. He wasn't quite looking at Harry; Harry set the cup on the drinks table and stared at it. For a deep, visceral moment, he
"Not a bad idea, actually," agreed Malfoy dryly, making Harry's panic rise. "I could make my fortune back, hanging around here writing a tell-all. Shame absolutely
