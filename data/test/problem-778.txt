He was silent listening to the beating of Draco's heart before he opened his mouth to speak. "It's like you're screaming... in a crowded room and no one can hear.." He cleared his throat a bit. "You feel ashamed, that someone could be that important.. that without them, you feel like nothing. Completely numb."
Hermione giggled. “I’m not sure when it happened, but looks nice.” She said making Harry choke on his drink, turning red.
The girl smiled at him. “Let’s see what you got there.” Draco bit his lip and took a deep breath, pulling his shirt sleeve up. She took hold of his arm, looking it over. “What do you want to do with it? Why do you want to cover it?”
“It’s really none of your business, to be honest.” Harry told him. “You don’t have to come over, you don’t even have to look at him. But he will be living in my house for the short time before we go back to Hogwarts.”
Harry chuckled. "I will get there, I promise. It's just going to take some time."
Harry frowned, shifting a bit as he opened his eyes but didn’t turn to look at the redhead. “Is it because of what happened at dinner last night? Mum… she was just trying to help…” Ron trailed off.
“NO! Tell me! Make me understand, Draco, please!” He called back.
Harry turned,  walking back to the door. “What does he like to eat?” He asked, turning back to Pansy. “I know nothing with meat.”
Harry was the first one out of the carriage, wearing his Gryffindor robes and looking sharp for once. He turned and helped Draco out of the carriage, who had donned his Slytherin robes proudly. The blond took his hand as he stepped down, his eyes cast to the ground to avoid everyone's looks.
"Dean Thomas and Neville Longbottom."
“I got a letter today.” She told them quietly. “I’m assuming all of you got one too.” She said, looking over everyone. There was a collective yes from the group. “Draco didn’t.” She told them.
Ginny seem to get even more irritated at that. Pansy swore the small redhead was about to combust. “Why does everyone forget about me??! I mean Harry, you,
It was towards the end of the next week that they started on the apartment. It was musty so he told Andromeda that he could do it himself if she just wanted to watch Teddy and do errands. She argued at first, but then relented letting Harry have his way.
“Am I to believe that you got into Hogwarts and allowed us to get off probation early without any help?”
“Make your own dinner, the muggle things don’t bite.” He said, turning off the stove and pulling Pansy out of the kitchen. “Let’s go.”
He looked up at her. “I can fix it… If you want.” He offered as she took the bag. She opened the door, silently inviting him in. He ducked into the foyer, kicking off his trainers before walking towards the kitchen.
There will be more journal entries from Remus. They will be placed as little intermission chapters as the story goes on, and will be titled by their dates.
He paused, trying to get his thoughts in order. "And when it's all over, and everything is done. Everyone is gone... you almost wish that you could have all the bad back... so that you could still have all the good.."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Potter?” He asked, raising an eyebrow. “Why would I go to Potter?”
“Your parents..” She said but Draco held up a hand to silence her. His face was furious as he got out the second container. He frowned, looking down at it. “I know someone who will help me.” The venom in his voice undeniable.
“Draco might kill me.” Ginny said, pecking her lips once more before moving to the window and down the garden trellis.
"Oy!" Draco protested, lighter out and already in position. Harry smiled at him as he placed it in his own mouth, leaning in for Draco to light it. The blond smirked, shaking his head as leaned in cupping his hand around the flame as Harry puffed a bit and pulled away.
“It’s your birthday, Harry. Everyone should have cake on their birthday.” She smiled at him before grabbing his hand and pulling him over to where Pansy and Ginny were dancing. He felt so much better. With people crowding around him, looking up at him expectantly, a panic attack had started to rear it’s head and Luna had pulled him away just in time.
“No.” He shook his head. “I haven’t really done anything. I mean, I cleaned up my house but that’s about it.” He said before remembering the stupid portrait. “By the way, I was wanting to ask you about something. How do you get a portrait down that is put up with an everlasting sticking charm?”
…’ He thought as he stood in front of the fireplace, grabbing a handful of floo powder. He chuckled a bit at that. ‘
She leaned in, kissing his cheek. “I’m only an Owl away and you have Andy and..” She trailed off, looking over at Draco. The blond shifted, glaring at her while Harry had his back to him.
“Dyed hair, piercings, tattoos and muggle clothing.” Harry answered George before turning to the couple in front of him. “When did this happen?” He asked, shocked.
"Like your godfather and his friend being a poof?" Draco asked.
Walking into the tattoo shop was a little surreal for Harry. He had seen all the tattoos on Bill, Sirius and Remus but never thought he would be the one getting one. It was even more surreal to be here with Draco in a muggle tattoo shop, looking at home.
“No, Potter. Technically I am in my city. And you are invading it with your unwanted presence.” He said, pulling Pansy into the café without another word.
“Because that’s what they want. They want you broken. Crying. They are out for blood and don’t care how they get it.” He told him. “I know that isn’t going to happen because you are too stubborn and too much of a prat to give in.” He turned Draco’s head to the other side, replacing the piercings in his other ear. “This is the time you can show them that you aren’t like your father. You are strong and you will not bow to them.”
“I have an idea, but I’m not sure if you will like it. Oh, by the way, my name is Stephanie.” She told him as she let go of his arm. He automatically covered the mark with his hand. Stephanie gave him a hard look before nodded in understanding.
He placed the phone back on the table before getting up. He went exploring a bit around the house before finding Harry’s bedroom. He walked in, opening his armoire and stealing some clothes before heading to take a shower.
Harry blinked at that, taking in that information before opening the door and inviting him in.  Draco walked in, blinking at the brightness of the foyer.
“Go to your little outing.” He told Harry, hanging up the rest of his things before starting on another box.
She looked shocked. “James Potter, thanking me?”
"Someone let it out that Draco couldn't use Magic and everyone is plotting." Dean continued, crossing his arms. Harry's face darkened, his lips turning down in a long frown. "Let them bloody fucking try." He spat.
Another chapter or so and then the letters go out! I can't wait to write about it! Hope everyone liked this chapter! Please comment!
“No, it seems like everyone got a letter.” She beamed at him. “Let’s celebrate! Get everyone together and meet at the pub?” She asked him.
“In the forest when Voldemort thought that he had killed me, he sent Narcissa to check on me. She lied to him, even though she knew I was alive. She felt my heart beating. She asked if Draco was alive and I gave her a nod and she lied to Voldemort.” He reached into his pocket pulling out a wand.
Draco looked over the tattoo with wide eyes, not believing what he was seeing. "It's not my best work, he kept moving. Unlike you." Chris told him.
Sirius nodded. “Thanks..” He said, turning on his heel and hurrying up the staircase.
“I don’t know..  There has never been anything like this in the history of all of Hogwarts.” Hermione gushed, looking at him in shock.
"Maybe he was just trying to make a point. A bad point but it seemed like Weasley wouldn't stop for anything. Didn't you notice Harry was shielding you from him and looking you over for damage?" She asked him. He shook his head. "Walk with me. I need air."
He made his way to the bathroom, looking his face over in the mirror. He had a busted lip and a nice lovely dark bruise sprouting over his cheek bone. He washed up before padding down to the kitchen.  He stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Andromeda sitting at the table, drinking coffee and reading the paper. He turned and made his way back up the stairs as quiet as he could be. He was on his second step when she called out to him.
He had called Chris soon after, hanging out with him a bit when they went out. He was a part of a muggle band and had invited both him and Pansy to watch the show a few times. After a week, Draco had even let the muggle boy talk him into getting multiple piercings along his ear lobes and one in his eyebrow. The next time he had seen the other, after Pansy’s makeover, the man had looked like he was going to faint.
He rolled his eyes. “Fine, I won’t freak out.” He settled down in the chair. “I need to meet this girlfriend of yours with all the muggle knowledge.”
Harry had dismantled most of the stove, figuring out what was the problem by the time the takeaway arrived. Pansy called Draco down, sitting out two plates and opening containers. Draco came running down the stairs, dressed in nothing but boxers and a band shirt.
“It’s fine Harry. Come have some breakfast.” She told him with a smile, motioning to the stack of toast and eggs behind her. He smiled. “Thanks.”
"Seamus Finnigan and Oliver Rivers."
Oh god I don't even know when the last time I updated this story and I am so so so sorry. I have ch 15 written out, just gotta finish it up. My job is pretty demanding and I just graduated from college and I'm transferring to finish up my second degree. Things are kinda hectic and have been for a very long time. I love this story and would never abandon it. I will ch 15 up tonight or tomorrow before I go to work! I hope you guys are still with me and that you still love this story.
“You are going to be fine.” She told him, pulling away and walking over to Draco. He straightened up, staring at her suspiciously.
There was no answer. After a few moments of silence, Draco turned to see if Harry was still there only to see him climbing up the trellis just like Weasley had done.
Draco sat there on his knees, quiet. “You called me Draco..” He finally said, his voice rough.
"Awww, well maybe Lunch sometime?" She asked, batting her eyes as her friends giggled. Harry looked at her a bit confused and shook his head. "Sorry, I'm having lunch with Draco."  Draco chuckled with relief upon seeing her disappointment. "Maybe I could see you in between classes?" She told him.
“About time.” Harry laughed, “I was wondering if it was just the adrenaline.” He pulled on a clean shirt and joined Ron on the cot. “Nah, we’ve been taking it slow.” Ron confirmed.
He remembered the outraged screaming, the spells flying overhead. His mother’s panic and worried expression, along with his father’s disgusted and frightful one. He didn't know what he had been thinking of at the time when he had thrown Potter his wand. He just wanted it over with. He was tired, emotionally drained and hollow. He couldn’t do it anymore. So he had thrown away his future, his friends, his education, all for what?  A gamble that stupid Saint Potter would be the end of it all, finally, once and for all. A gamble that he really didn’t believe would pay off.  A gamble that in the in the end cost him his home, friends, education, future and pretty much everything that he could remember.
Pansy gave a chuckle and Hermione seemed to relax a bit. “Draco and Potter are more fitted for each other than I thought.” She shook her head. “Thanks Kitten.” She leaned over, giving Ginny a kiss on the cheek before putting her sunglasses back on. Ginny turned a bit red, looking away. She watched as Harry pulled himself out of the pool, wringing out Draco’s flannel shirt before making his way back into the house.
The rest of George’s letter was a lot more interesting. According to George, Charlie was kind of dating but not dating Oliver Wood of all people. Harry had always wondered what had happened to his old Quidditch captain. Though Harry was confused on how someone could date but not date someone,  George went into an explanation of that. They did date things like dinner, movies, coffee and gifts; however, they didn’t do date things like kissing, shagging, etc. It confused both George and Harry greatly. The last two pages were just about how amazing Romania was and how Harry should visit, now that he was done saving the world and what not.
“It’s sort of a culture shock.” She went on, motioning for the boy to drink his tea. “First things first. Is your friend, Pansy was it? Is she alright?” She asked him still in the same soft voice. He reminded her of how Harry was the first time that he had visited her. Shaky, jumpy at every little thing. Uneasy and uncomfortable with the unfamiliar surroundings. Hermione was right about those two.
“You can call him Harry.” Ginny stated offhandedly.
He hissed as Teddy started to cry again. Draco groaned, letting out a frustrated breath.
She visibly stiffened at that comment, her shoulders tensing. Draco knitted his eyebrows. “Are you alright?”
“I… want to do it. I can come back another day and get started. I just need to go to the store.” He smiled. “I am in need of a sledgehammer.”
Ginny bit her lip, shoving her hands into her pocket. “I like you.” She said, looking up at her.
“Okay, this is just three different planes of mind fuckery.” Draco said, gesturing to the new comers with his cigarette. “But do you really blame him?” He scoffed at them both as if they were daft.
“Hello?” He called over the music, coming around the corner and finding a pair of
“What do you mean a buzzing needle??” He asked, concerned. “Why would muggles make a buzzing needle to put pictures on themselves?”
“What are you doing here?” He asked him.
Pansy’s mask melted away and she grinned, placing her fingertips over her lips.
“I’ve seen it, Remus would go in for a good night kiss and you would turn it into a cheek kiss. ’Remus, have you seen my potions book?’ ‘Remus can you help me with this calculation?’ ‘Remus, do you want something from the kitchen? I was going to get Prongs something and thought I’d ask?’ And I haven’t even seen you two share a bed in a long time… not to mention, you don’t comfort him after nightmares anymore. I know you’re a heavy sleeper, but Remus has been trying to be quiet about it and I hear him.” He looked away from Sirius. “He crawled into my bed a week ago because he couldn’t sleep. He just wanted someone there.”
“Your sister has been hanging out with Parkinson.” He muttered, taking a sip of his coffee.
“Harry, of course I’m fine.” She sighed. “Ginny and Me were waiting for Pansy the other day and she looked like she was about to cry. She wouldn’t tell us what had happened, but I’ve never seen her like that. She was as white as a sheet, and shaking. Like she had seen a ghost. I just know it was something to do with Draco.” She confessed.
Draco froze, staring at him. "Your aunt and uncle?"
Pansy stopped Draco outside the entrance when they got to the club. “Draco, I need to talk to you.”
*The lullaby that Draco sings to Teddy is Lullaby by Tim Minchin. He is great and so hilarious. I recommend you guys watch his performance of this song.
“Everything.. Everything scares me… “ He chuckled, his throat tightening. “Everyone is so excited and celebrating and I’m… I’m not happy.. I don’t like the idea of going back.. Going back and seeing it… I see it enough in my head…. And in my dreams.. I don’t need to see it in real life..” He choked out, blinking the wetness from his eyes.
Harry nodded, “Yeah, Hermione told me you guys went to Ireland for a bit.”
Harry nodded, walking over to her as he opened the journal. He stopped at the page with the letter to Teddy, handing it to her. She shook her head, pushing it back to him. “I don’t want to read it.”
He stared at the glasses laying so innocently next to his book. They didn’t look out of place, but quite the opposite… Like they belong there..
“The only reason I have a bunch of Gryffindors in my garden is because Pansy asked me to. It’s not like I want seven people that talk behind my back and can’t even get the broomstick up their arses out long enough to eat cake at their friend’s birthday party. ” He turned on his heel to leave but Harry jumped up and grabbed a hold of his flannel, pulling him backwards into the pool. Luna covered her mouth in shock, standing there looking at where Draco had fallen. Pansy slowly lowered her sunglasses, mouth open in shock. The only one that moved was Chris, who had hurried over to make sure Draco was alright.
“Yeah, don’t get used to it, Evans.” He smirked, running his hand through his hair.
“Come on then hit me.” Harry gloated.
"How can I not? Ginny's dating a bloody Slytherin, Hermione having girl outings with bloody Slytherins, when did they get so chummy with Slytherins? It's like we are the only sane ones." Ron frowned.
"Says who?" He demanded.
"You don’t have to do this, you know?" Draco told him, biting his lip and playing with his piercing.
It took not even two full days in the house for him to crack. Arriving at 12 Grimmauld Place had been like resurfacing from under water. A breath of very much needed fresh air after such a long time of suffocation. He had immediately fell in love with the silence and isolation that the place offered. He had moved into Sirius’s old room, crashing onto the bed and sleeping for the rest of the day. When he woke up the silence was unnerving. Looking around the pure darkness pouring into the room, he assumed it must be pretty late.
“Yes.” She laughed.
“Really..” He said, turning to George. He pleaded for the other to know what to do. George took the hint and distracted everyone by spilling his beer all over the table, letting Harry disappear behind him.
Remus snapped his journal shut, looking up at the two quietly arguing in the middle of the common room. Marlene, Dorcas and Lily were standing in the corner looking worried. Peter was cowering at the bottom of the stairs to the dorm.
Pansy scoffed. “The Almighty Granger, admitting she was wrong?” She chuckled. “No, we have done everything right. Draco is possibly the most stubborn person in the world and Potter is just oblivious to everything in the world.” She shrugged it off.
“Bad breakup.” Pansy offered, which made Draco chuckle. “Something like that.” He agreed.
“You only have two months left of probation. What point is there to leave you out of Hogwarts?” He asked, moving closer.
Ginny opened her mouth to say something, but then stopped to give her a look before turning to Hermione who just shrugged. “It seemed like a good idea at the time considering that Harry hasn’t talked to anyone in weeks and you saw how he was when we visited him the other day.” Hermione explained, looking worried.
“Malfoy?” Hermione asked shocked, looking him over.
Hermione laughed at the expression on his face. “Seamus and Dean are going to be there. They just came back from Ireland. Needed to get away. Luna also said that she will be able to come. I haven’t been able to get in touch with Neville though.” She nodded. “I have a place to have your party but if you aren’t up to see anyone, we can really not do it.” She assured him.
"I'm not sure what I am doing? I'm not sure what I am feeling or what I am doing. I just get so overwhelmed when... when he's not there... The way Chris was looking at him..."
“I’m not obsessed with you! You wished I was!” He fired back.
"Good. Let's get started." He said, pulling out a pen to sketch.
Draco stared at him, a little shocked. “Are you drunk?” He asked, keeping his voice low to not wake Teddy.
Pansy nodded. “I’m not leaving you here alone…” She insisted. “Maybe you can go live with Andy.. She offered..”
That seem like the wrong thing to say. Pansy caught the immediate reaction. Potter had gone from proudly gloating Draco into arguing to almost a complete shutdown. It was like almost a Draco type of shutting down and pulling away. He just completely stopped.
Harry looked away from him for a moment, going completely silent. “Because she thinks you’re going mad.” He said, looking up and locking eyes with the other. His stare was intense and made Draco want to take a step back. “So she came to see me; to see what a mad person looks like.” He finished.
“Alright.. I’ll let Pansy know.” Ginny said with a chuckle. “Night Harry.”
Harry stared at him, biting his lip as he thought over what to say as Draco moved to get up. The blond was wearing his clothing again. The shirt that he left at the party and the boxers that he had stolen that day the blond had stayed over.
“Why not?” He asked curiously.
Ron frowned, crossing his arms as he gripped his wand tightly in his hand.
Harry chuckled. “The great Draco Malfoy actually thanking me, I might actually be insane.” He said, grinning. Draco rolled his eyes, looking over the books the other had gotten him. He picked them up, placing them on the desk. “Don’t get use to it. It’s a one time thing.” Draco said, moving back to the bed.
The last straw had been dinner. It had been going great, he had been in the process of hiding his food and making it look like he had been eating, even fake chewing when Molly came over and hugged him tightly. He flinched, going rigid. She seemed not to notice as she pulled back and plunked a large book on the table, gaining everyone’s attention. All eyes turned on Harry as Molly smiled at him. He looked down at the title of the book and felt his blood run cold.
“I don’t know if I should be relieved or scared.” Hermione said hesitantly, taking the paper back and looking at the addition. “Um… that’s Malfoy’s address…” She recalled, looking up at the other.
“Go on Draco, no one is going to get mad or judge you here.” She said softly.
. While everyone was frozen in shock, he pushed past some stupid Gryffindors, running towards where the other stood unarmed. He didn’t know what he was doing or thinking but his previous immobile body was moving of its own accord. He yelled for Potter, running between him and Voldemort. Another stupid decision that could have ended his life. He threw his wand to Potter before running towards his mother, pulling her out of the way, over rubble.
“Excuse me,” She glared at him, a towel twisted up onto her head. “ You are going to eat something that you don’t know what is in it?” She asked, watching him as he popped it into the microwave,  pressing the buttons indicated in the note.
He remembered the marks on the blond’s arm, vividly, and it worried him. But Malfoy wouldn’t try to kill himself, would he? He wasn’t like him, he was better. He wasn’t like him…
He scoffed, crossing his arms. “I don’t want to be home, I certainly do not want to play third wheel to Pansy and her miniature, plus there is someone I really don’t want to deal with right now. Andy is not home. Sadly to say, this is the last place I want to be, but the only place left.” He glared.
“I haven’t done anything to it. You don’t have to.” He muttered, looking down at his arm. “I know.” Harry said with a smile, running his  fingertips over the cuts gently before letting go. He leaned forward making Draco freeze up as the other came extremely close. Harry reached around grabbing the mug of coffee. He took a sip of it right in front of Draco’s face with a smirk. “You look good.” He turned moving to the table. Draco flushed, turning pink before becoming angry. Stupid fucking Potter.
“Oh, alright.” Narcissa said softly, giving her a smile. “How is he?” She asked her. Pansy sat up fully, pulling the covers from herself. “He’ll be alright… I promise.”
"Your unfortunate 'I'm not a poof' speech." She told him with a sigh. Draco groaned, laying his head on Pansy's shoulder in defeat. She rubbed his back. "So, how was it?" She asked with a smirk.
Harry frowned. "It's not like I have the dark mark on my arm. I have a serpent, the symbol of Slytherin House wrapped around the Sword of Gryffindor, which symbolizes the Gryffindor House."
“That’s amazing Luna. I’m so happy for you.”
“If I die then I die and I won’t have to worry about any of this.” He muttered, grabbing a fork and shoving food into his mouth.
“I was getting food for Draco and I bumped into her. After some really horrible words from me,” Pansy paused, “And some apologies, we started talking.”
“That’s great.” Pansy gave him a smile. He looked at her suspiciously. “What is going on? Why are you cleaning?” He said the word with disgust.
“Have it at my place.” She smirked. “I can talk Draco into it. Especially after what happened this morning.” She muttered, mostly to herself.

“Where is he?” He asked, taking a sip from the mug as his mobile started to ring. “Can you grab my pants?” He asked her, grabbing for his glasses and putting them on. She raised an eyebrow before getting up and picking his jeans from the floor. “What did you and Draco do last night?” She smirked. “Nothing.” He said, taking his jeans and pulling his phone from the pocket.
“You should listen to her.” Ginny chuckled.
“Oh no. It’s fine, It’s just…” He bit his lip.
"Own that shit." He repeated, biting his lip as he looked down at his tattoo.
“What the fuck are you doing?! STOP IT!” He screamed, trying to pull his arm from Harry’s hold.
“What are you doing up there?” He called to him.
“Take all the time you need.” Harry told him.
He shoved the photos back into the box, taking a few deep breaths. He went to close the lid but something shiny caught his eye. He reached in and pulled out a necklace. On the chain hung a simple black band with what looked like a rune engraved into it. He couldn’t remember which one it represented though. Was this Sirius’s? He never mentioned being married or being with anyone. Nor had anyone else. All he had heard was that him and his father were joined at the hip and that Remus was always around. There was never any mention of any girlfriend except for his mother. Not even for Remus. Though, he had been kind of oblivious to Remus and Tonks’ relationship so it was possible that he overlooked something.
“Harry?” Ginny’s voice sounded over the mobile.
She opened the door a bit more, crossing her arms. “What are you talking about?” She asked defensively.
“For once in your life, I’m going to have to ask you to do something I will never ask you again. Trust me, Granger. Just this once, and then you can go back to being suspicious of me. If this doesn’t work, than I am out of ideas and we are, pardon my language, royally fucked. And not in the way I usually like.” She stated.
Sirius let go of the other pulling away. “We really made Moony pretty mad…”
“It’s okay Harry… I’m sorry, I forgot.” She said, biting her lip. “Come on!” She said with a smile, offering her hand. He gave her a fake smile, taking it after a bit.
Harry smiled at her. “You can get whatever job you want. You have the skills for anything.”
“It’s impervious to any magic. I’ve tried.” He shrugged, finishing up her nails and letting her hand go. He closed up the polish and was silence for a good bit. “Thanks Pansy.”
“Did I do it right? I followed the instructions Pansy left me.” She said, hopefully. Draco gave her a small smile. “It’s fine Mother.” He answered her, his voice flat.
Harry had stopped to get something to snack on while he waited for the address and was eating chips when his mobile beeped. He read off the address before looking around. He wasn’t that far from it actually, nor did the other live far from himself. He shoved the rest of the chips into his mouth before replying that he would be there in a bit and headed off. When he arrived at Malfoy’s house, he spotted the other hanging out of his window, smoking. He stopped right before his garden gate, watching him.  He noticed how his lips held the cigarette by themselves, emitting small puffs of smoke. How he was staring off in the distance as if it held all the answers he was searching for. He licked his lips before shaking his head, hitching the shopping bag up higher on his shoulder.
Draco watched him go, feeling a bit of panic rise in himself. He took a breath before ditching his cigarette and grabbing their trunks, making his way to the train, jackets under his arm.
Harry grit his teeth. "I will protect him. How can I do this Pansy?"
When Draco finally registered the world around him again, he was sitting in his bed clad in a band shirt and sweats. He was curled up into himself in the middle of the bed with his hair still wet. He was about to get up when Pansy walked back into the room carrying an armful of clothing.
“Yeah.” She said, looking down at her tea. “There is something else that I wanted to talk to you about.” Her voice and face turned serious.
“I could…” Harry begin to say but the blond cut him off. “I can’t.” He wished he could just use magic to make the pain go away.
Dean and Seamus burst out laughing. “So that’s why we can’t go back to Kimchee To Go.” Hermione said with a frown. “I really liked that place.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Sirius asked, shocked. “Because it’s you and Remus. Pads and Moons. You can’t have one without the other. I thought maybe you were just having trouble adjusting or something and you guys would be okay again..”
“The chlorine is killing the germs in your cut. It’s not anything to worry about. Just hurts.” He explained.
Harry frowned. "You've been at the bottom only surviving. You decide who you are now, no one else." He said sternly, taking Draco's face in his hand. "I'm with you through everything. It doesn't matter to me. I'm tired. I'm so tired. And summer isn't going to stop just because school started. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere." He paused, placing his forehead against the blond's.
birthday.” She shook her head. “That boy kills me sometimes with the things he does.”
There were a lot of things that I wanted to really work into this scene but had to cut half of it out from next time because god i didn't realize i wrote that much. I will explain more on Pansy later though. She is currently the only one that talks to Draco now.
“Oh that is complete shit, Potter and you know that.” He spat. “I know that the only reason you are here is because Pansy told your little Weaslette shit because she can’t keep her mouth shut.”
“You’re not looney.”
“Just know my offer still stands, and don’t worry about anything. Things tend to have a way of working themselves out.” She smiled at him. He gave her a smile in return. “Thank you.”
“Why wouldn’t you let him in? You know what he did during the war! You know how he saved our lives, my life. How he helped me defeat Voldemort! He had no choice during the war! Like I did! He lied to numerous Death Eaters, to his own family. Went against everything he knew to just end the war. He did everything he could to keep his family safe during the war!” He yelled.
“Wear the silver stilettos.” He answered, staring at the ceiling.  He hadn’t really did or said anything the entire day, just stayed cooped up in his room the entire time.
"Yes, I have your wand with mine. Nothing is going to happen to it." Harry assured him before  lugging the trunk out of the room to line it up with his own and Pansy's.
Ginny ignored both of them in favor of Pansy. “He’s been really distance. Andromeda is worried about him. He’s been drinking a lot and sometimes it’s like he doesn’t even realize where he is.” She explained to Pansy, who nodded.
The Great Hall hadn't changed much from where they had left it a few months ago. The tables where there and so was the houses, split into four as usual. Harry frowned, coming to realize that he would have to let Draco go so that he could sit with the Slytherins at their table. He turned to look at Draco who had paused and was going to pull away but Harry frowned, clutching his hand tightly before marching over to the Gryffindor table. Draco stumbled, trying to follow along behind the other in shock and confusion. "Harry…" He hissed, eyes darting to the many shocked faces. "Harry.. I need to go to my table.." He pleaded to him as they got to the Gryffindor table.
“We don’t have time for impossible questions. Just don’t freak out.” She told him. He frowned at her. “I am not going to freak out.”
The last month had been the worse in Draco’s life. He didn't know what he had been thinking when he had thrown Harry his wand. He had been stupid. He hadn’t been thinking, he really hadn’t. He had just wanted it to end. Just to end. When his father called to him, he couldn’t move. He couldn’t breathe. He physically could not bring his body to move. People turned to stare at him and he couldn’t move. Not even when his mother called for a second time. He looked away, wanting nothing more than to hide from everyone. He silently prayed for the ground underneath him to open up and swallow him whole.
The next one was with all four marauders. Sirius on the far right, school shirt and tie underneath a leather biker jacket. His hair was almost pass his shoulders, one part pushed back behind a pierced ear. He had on fingerless riding gloves and an arm was thrown over Remus, pulling him so close that the top of his head rested under Sirius’s chin. Remus was in his proper uniform, smiling as he wrapped an arm around Sirius’s waist. James was next with an arm around Remus’s shoulders, his school shirt underneath an opened black waistcoat and his tie undone. He had the nerdiest looking black rimmed glasses and was pulling Peter into the photo. His arm draping over the blond as the other smiled. Harry didn’t pay much attention to him. He couldn’t deal with the feeling that went with Wormtail on top of everything else.
“What? Are you mental? Mum is going to have kittens!” Ron said as Harry shook his head. “I don’t care. I NEED to get out of here… it’s nothing personal… I just can’t- with all
Both Hermione and Pansy looked at her like she was mental.” Are you serious right now?” Pansy asked her.
“Harry isn’t oblivious.” Ginny said with a chuckle.
“What is going on?” Ginny asked again, not letting go of the clasp as she stared at Pansy, her eye contact with the dark haired woman never wavering. Pansy bit her lip, pulling her sunglasses off in defeat. “Granger and me wanted to try to get Potter and Draco together so that maybe they could work out whatever it is that they have going on since they both know how the other feels.” Pansy muttered to the redhead, the intense gaze she was getting making her a bit nervous.
“What in Merlin’s name is Buffy the Vampire Slayer?” He asked as he moved to make coffee. He was all too aware of the fact that he was standing in front of Potter in nothing but pants and his tshirt, like some weird morning after a shag thing.
The blond sneered at them in perfect Malfoy fashion as he pulled his pack out of his pocket, placing a cigarette between his lips. Harry rolled his eyes as Pansy smirked, crossing her arms and examining her nails. She glanced over at Harry, giving him a small nod.
He had done the singing, the food and the cake. Which was a nice cake. Chocolate with nice but thin frosting. It tasted good, though Pansy, him and Ginny were the only ones who ate any of it. Everyone else just stood there and stared at it as if it would sprout fangs and attack them. Malfoy stayed pretty much to himself, except when he was approached by Chris or Pansy. He seemed kind of lonely. The band was really good and he suppose he should  thank the singer.
“We couldn’t either.” Dean said with a laugh.
Pansy blinked, not expecting that one. "A lot of things. Why?"
Harry frowned. “Then why are you here, Malfoy?”
Like I said in the tags, this is gonna be a slow build, hope you guys stay with me. XD
Dean chuckled. "Hey, you saved my boyfriend, I thought I would return the favor." He told Harry, who flushed. "Draco isn't my boyfriend."
Harry chuckled, choking a bit on his coffee. “I’m already Uncle Harry so that ship has already sailed.”
“What are you talking about?” He asked her with a frown. “Oh come on Draco, you can’t lie to me. He looked like Potter’s twin. Instant Potter, just add glasses.” She accused.
“Oh nothing kitten.” She said, dismissing the question. Ginny frowned, grabbing the clasp on the front of her bikini top and yanked Pansy back towards her.
"Seriously, you don't have to save me or whatever your crazy Gryffindor hero complex is telling you to do." Draco sighed heavily. "I'm going to drag you down. I was on the train for not even fifteen minutes and it started. People hate me, Harry. And you can't protect me nor can you change their minds."
Andromeda chuckled. “Nice work on Harry’s face. It really goes to show that you can make your point even in the muggle way.”
“What has Potter been doing?” Pansy asked, curious. “I’ve heard rumors but nothing really concrete.”
“I don’t understand what-“ He started but was interrupted by the other.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What are you going to do?” She asked him as he opened the polish carefully. “I’m not entirely sure. I just wished she would stop hovering. She was never like this before, I don’t see why she is now.”
“I haven’t told Ron because he will explode.” Hermione told her. “And you know it.”
Pansy watched him, curious as the dark haired man seem to take utter joy in pushing her best friend’s buttons.
Draco pulled back to look down at him. "They are giving you an Order of Merlin?"
"I don't have my schedule yet, sorry." Harry shrugged and Draco frowned. "We have to get ready. Bye now." Draco told them before shutting the door. "Go back to sleep." He told Harry. "I'm sorry they woke you."
"Soft. Just uncharacteristically soft." He pulled his head up. "Like he was trying to be gentle with me. His lips barely touched mine."
He had been talking to Andromeda over the last two days. There was just something about her that compelled him to tell her about everything. Well
“You’re living in my family’s ancestral home, of course I know. People talk.” He rolled his eyes before looking around. “Can I see the rest of it?” He asked, turning to look at him.
Harry pushed his cereal around in his bowl for a moment. "What can you tell me about Chris?"
, he sighed making sure he got everyone’s names right in his head.
birthday, of course we are going to do something. Not only are you of age in the wizarding world, you will be of age in the muggle world as well. You could possibly get a muggle job, if that is the sort of thing you want to do.” She said softly.
“Who said you could unpack my things?” Draco asked him, raising an eyebrow as he took a sip of the tea.
He moved from across the room, hugging her tightly saying nothing.
“Hermione, what are we doing at Malfoy’s place?” Harry asked her. She just gave a devious looking smile before moving to the door and opening it. “Malfoy offered to have your party here because I can’t find a venue. Come on.” She said, pulling him through the threshold. They walked out back to find music playing loudly. Harry smiled at that. “Nirvana.” He said, looking around at everyone. “I know. Pansy was able to get a cover band for them!” Hermione said excitedly. “They will be playing in a bit after food.”
Harry came to a stop at the bench, and Dean pulled Seamus into his lap to make room for the two. Ginny giggled, making room as well as she could. Hermione smiled at the two as she looked at them, jumping into conversation with Harry as he sat down. Draco sat down, swallowing hard before looking at the angry looks from the Gryffindors that weren't in their bubble of friends.
Draco walked into his room, having yet to run into . He found Pansy in his room, talking on the mobile with Ginny. “Where is everyone?” He asked her. “Your father went to the ministry for a probation meeting and your mother is still asleep.” She said before telling Ginny she had to go. She hung up before turning to him.
“Feel free to move into the guest room.” He told her as he grabbed the container, walking off.
"Harry, maybe he's just-" She started before Harry gave her a frown, growling in frustration. "Leave it alone. I don't meddle with you and Pansy. Don't meddle with me and Draco." He said pointedly. "I know that's what you and Hermione have been doing."
She giggled. “Sirius would have loved to see this. Give it a few whacks for the old wanker.” She told him.
Pansy smirked. "Going back to Hogwarts will be like feeding Draco to shark infested waters. You can't be a Gryffindor going into this. You have to come at this with a Slytherin mindset."
Draco was very suspicious of her still, but didn’t think that Pansy was able to do all of this by herself so he brushed it off. Not only did she have to worry about the Potter Plot, she had to worry about Chris. Draco had been pushing him away and she could tell that the other was getting a bit irritated by Draco’s push and pull. As much as Pansy had tried to break him of that Draco was still battling himself.
“The brilliant chosen one everyone.” Draco smirked. Harry shoved him, turning red. Draco grinned, smirking wider. “They probably wouldn’t even do it if you ask them to.” He said, jokingly.
Being in Harry Potter’s home was weird. He had been here before, had stayed the night before but there was something different about knowing that this was his home too, now. The house was huge, even to Draco. It was more compact than he was used to, but it possibly had more rooms and space than the manor.
“I’ll try.” He huffed, but hugged her back. “I’m going to get some sleep.” He told her before letting go. “Alright. I’ll be in my bedroom if you need me.” She gave him a peck on top of his head before getting up and walking out.
"You did something Potter." Pansy eyed him suspiciously.
"Bollocks! Sod off, you literally came in here and attacked me." Draco said, furious as he peered around Harry at the redhead.
“I know.” Harry said, splashing him. “Sod off, prat!” Draco yelled, splashing him back. “You better be glad Pansy has my mobile or you would be dead.”
"Well for starters, it explains a lot about third year." Draco commented offhandedly. "I never really understood why everyone was so uppity about Professor Lupin. It makes since that... They were together."
“What is going on?” He asked George who he spotted leaning against the counter in the kitchen. He dodged a few more things before coming to a stop next to him. The former redhead looked great. Still tall and lanky, but he had died his hair a sandy dirty blond and was a crisp golden tan.
Draco started to laugh. “See you?” He asked, appalled at the very thought. “You wish! Did you lose some marbles over the last few months?” He asked, glaring at him. “No one would want to come here voluntarily. No one likes you.”
“Who is that guy Malfoy talking to?” Harry asked, looking over at the pair.
“Oh..” She said, nodding. “It’ll be alright, Draco. Just another six months. It will go by so fast and then we can go back home.” She assured him. He choked on his drink, eyes wide as he stared at her. “Six more months? But it was only six months’ probation. We only had two months left.” He all but yelled at her.
“I can’t believe this. They gave us more time on our probation because of him?!” He sputtered, spilling his drink a bit in his outrage.
She shook her head. “Not really anything you can do about it, unless you remove the wall.” She joked.
It was a picture of very bright vibrant flower blossoms that were curling around a stem that was made out of a previous tattoo. “Daffodils for rebirth and new beginnings. Gladiolus for strength of character. White Heather Lavender for protection and wishes come true. Blue Iris for hope. Orange Lily for passion.” She explained. “We can play with it a bit if you don’t-“
Draco sat on the bed, staring around him for the longest time. He didn’t know what to do with himself. He had never been on his own before. What was he supposed to do? He didn’t even know where to start… He closed his eyes tightly, trying to quell the rising panic and the strong urge to run back to his mother. His eyes snapped back open at the sound of a knock on the doorframe.
“Thank you.” She told him seriously. “Don’t worry about it.” Harry told her, making Ron drop his jaw in shock. Ginny smiled at them, moving to continue the conversation with Seamus and Dean.
Pansy smiled at her. “You are welcome.”
"Better?" Draco asked him with a soft smile.
So sorry It took forever to update! I've been home from convention for a week now, but I had some school stuff to take care of so that kinda ate into my editing time. Also the Chrome update threw me because begone you damn black border boxes!
“And how you got me blind is still a mystery, I can't get you out of my head. Don't care what is written in your history, as long as you're here with me. I don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did, as long as you love me.” He sang, a small sad smile coming to his face as he pulled down a novel, running his fingertips over it carefully. He looked at the title and read the excerpt before placing it onto the table.
“Yeah, Harry, you’re worrying me..” He frowned.
“To see the band that played on your birthday, Go get ready.” She ushered. Harry looked at her for a moment. “I don’t want to go to a crowded concert hall.”
Draco rolled his eyes, turning away from him before shedding his own jacket, placing it on top of Harry's.  He turned to Pansy, giving her a pointed look before glancing back at Harry with all the subtleness of a bull in a china shop.
Luna was moving around trying to help but didn’t really know what to do as the two wrestled.
“All the more reason.” Harry and Pansy muttered at the same time, making them both freeze in shock. Draco stared at them both, eyebrows raised. “That’s just freaky.” He said before laughing. “This is insane, you know that right?” He asked them. “I can’t just up and move in with Potter.”
“No one Father. There is no one.” He said, stirring the coffee slowly.
“Why do I have a feeling I’m going to feel like hurting you when you finish that sentence?” He asked with a groan.
She chuckled. “Potter left them here. Ginny said that he was so drunk he walked home in swim shorts and trainers.”
Next chapter will be the birthday party. Also another thing, if something or someone seems out of character, it usually has its reason and they will probably explain it as we go along. Those of you who are unfamiliar with my work, every detail has a reason behind it.
"But.."
“I really like yours.” Harry told him, making Draco look away and swallow a bit.
“What happened?” Hermione asked, looking up.
“With my
Holy fuck that felt good. He gave a scream and started to swing the sledgehammer over and over with abandon. He knew he was screaming things as he reduced the wall to rumble, but he just couldn’t make out what. Sometime during this he had started to sob, switching direction and knocking off the elf statues from the wall. As he went he tripped over the same loose floorboard he had the other night. He collapsed to the ground, a frustrated sobbing mess. He turned his attention to the floorboard. He never remembered that being there. Surely if it had, Tonks would have tripped over it along with many other people. He pulled his glasses off, wiping his eyes and glasses before moving over to it. The board look like it had been wretched up and tried to be replaced in a hurry.
those actions. "You, now." She said before pulling him to the train.
He spent some time with Teddy and Andromeda before heading off to the shop to spend some hours trying to fix his motorbike. He stopped on his way home and grabbed some food and alcohol. It was routine and it felt familiar and safe. The alcohol kept the memories, the thoughts and feelings away. It kept the nightmares and anxiety away. It numbed him to everything that could possibly hurt him. He felt himself treading water, just barely catching wisps of breath occasionally. He wasn’t living, he was just existing from day to day as he tried not to fall apart.
"I think I should just go back to my room." Draco said turning again.
“Your nephew has a great right hook?” He explained, taking a sip of his coffee when she let go.
Draco moved down the train hallway, looking into windows to try to find where Harry had gone. Every time he only was met with the nastiest looks. He adverted his eyes, taking a shaky breath each time before continuing on. He had gotten halfway down the train when he was hit with a spell, knocking him off his feet. He fell hard, letting out a loud groan as the wind was knocked from him. He shook the disorientation off, lifting his head to see some Gryffindor (he was already in robes) standing over him, wand raised high.
“No. I mean I know that you didn’t stay for the sentencing, but you haven’t read the papers have you?” She asked.
“I’m not sure why she is bothering actually.” Harry shrugged. “I don’t care really about it.”
Harry sighed, scratching at the back of his head. "I can glamour it, if it makes you feel better." This was not the reaction that he had really been hoping for in the end. He just couldn't get over Chris's smug look and the way he looked at Draco. He wasn't jealous. He wasn't. He just had the strong urge to bash Chris's face in. He hadn't really been thinking when he had the other design it, just wanting a little piece of ownership over the other. Just a tiny inside detail that they only knew. Of course everyone would blow it out of proportion if anyone found out.  He was stupid not to think of that. He grabbed his flannel from the chair, pulling it on.
“Then stop staring.” He muttered, “Or I swear to Merlin I will hit you.” He threatened.
Draco nodded, getting up from the bed and gently knocking Harry away from the box. He continued what the other had started. “That seems reasonable.” He told him as Harry gave the blond’s back a soft smile.
He turned back to look at Harry. He had looked so exhausted when he had arrived, almost dead on his feet. He was snuggled up to his pillow, snoring slightly as he slept. Draco leaned down, moving his fringe off his forehead and looked at his scar. How did his life get this fucked? He let the fringe fall from his fingertips before biting his lip. He reached over, removing the lipstick smudge that Pansy had left earlier. He moved closer to him, lifting his arm before snuggling close to his chest. He placed his arm down around him, burying his face into his shirt. Harry pulled him close in his sleep, burying his face into his hair with a puff of contentment.
He stared at the other for a very long moment before setting his mug down. “How do you do it?” He asked him, sitting up straight.
"I'm not really sure. I think I am." Harry shrugged.
“Harry… it’s fine…” He said with a sort of half smile. “Actually Hermione said you might do it.” He chuckled. Harry gave him a weak smile. “Really now?”
“Basically.” Harry chuckled, settling down. “I’ve been watching it for a bit and it’s kinda grown on me.”
Harry bit his lip, scratching at the back of his neck. He shrugged. “I… I’m just used to it. I mean, there isn’t any reason to get upset because it won’t change anything.”
“Yeah… He hasn’t yelled at us like that in a while..” James nodded, scratching the back of his neck. “Is that stuff he said true.. about you and him?” He asked.
Your music for this chapter is 'Light a Fire' by Rachel Taylor, 'I'll be Good' by Jaymes Young and 'Scars' by Boy Epic. All and some new songs can be found on the spotify playlist.
Draco moved to the bathroom, looking himself over in the mirror. He washed his face, wiping the last bits of eyeliner from his eyes. He bit his lip, taking each piercing out slowly. Each time he felt like a piece of him was dying. The life he wanted so much and yet he wanted his world back even more. Every piercing solidified this decision. After he was done, he looked at himself in the mirror, just staring at his reflection. He looked naked… He didn’t even recognize himself anymore. He was neither the Draco before or the Draco after. He shuffled around in the drawers before finding a pair of scissors. He sat them down, leaning close, staring at his long hair in the mirror. He took a deep breath before taking up the scissors and moving towards his hair.
“You want to know?! They gave me six more months because they thought it wasn’t long enough! They will find every and any excuse to keep us here, isolated, without magic!” He yelled.
“I… I’ve been reading Remus’s journals. It’s been helping me through a lot of things actually.” He admitted. “It makes me cry sometimes..”
“You could always come stay with me?” He offered, looking away and scratching at the back of his neck.
He had spent the most miserable month of his life in this muggle hell, living off the meals and takeaways that Pansy brought him when she visited. His mother had been reduced to tears, he didn’t know his mother could cry, and had been begging help from her sister. The one he had never met. His father had locked himself in his room, going through at least a weeks’ worth of alcohol in a days’ time. He hadn’t talked or seen his father since they had moved here into Muggle hell.
Harry looked down at the letter, not sure if he actually believed it or not.
“How is Teddy, by the way?” George asked.
"What do you mean?"
Andromeda moved, hugging him and Teddy. “Do what you feel. There is no one or anything that you need to concern yourself about but you. Do what your heart is telling you, what you are feeling. You don’t need to decide right now.” She reassured him.
"How was your nap?" Harry asked him, pulling his uniform and robes from his trunk and pulling his shirt off.
"Kind of. A bit." He looked away from him.
"How original." She rolled her eyes before looking at her mobile. "Ginny should be over in a bit. I should get dressed." She told them. "Yeah, I should get dressed too, going to see Andromeda." Draco said, hurrying out of the kitchen and disappearing up the stairs.
“I get it. You don’t have to explain anything to me.” He said, with a nod as Pansy joined them. She passed Draco a flask and he took a long sip from it.
“Oh, yes, well I’ve been traveling. Finding new creatures and writing about them. I want to write a book about them.” She smiled.
"I'm not sure Pans. How long have you been there?" He asked, clearing his throat.
She snorted. “I should be thanking you. “ She shook her head. “Biscuits?” She asked, pushing off of the counter and walking over to the pantry.
“So, I’ll let you think about that before you sentence them out of just plain spite and prejudice. Some people do what they do just to survive.” He said before tucking his wand into his pocket and storming out.
“I’m going to go home…” He whispered after a long silence, getting up from his spot. He threw his cup in the trash before grabbing his shoes. He slipped them on, grabbing his wallet and phone from the table and walking out.
“You don’t have to. But do try to be civil. If you make a scene, both your sister and your girlfriend will kill you.” He told him.
Harry sighed. "I fucked up didn't I?"
“I was wondering if you could help me by cleaning up the guest apartment. I’ve tried to do it but I really can’t with work and Teddy. Plus, I think those things would mean more to you than me.” She looked up at him, holding his gaze.
He reached behind him, grabbing a spoon from the drying rack. He handed it to the other before coming back to his seat. Harry accepted the silent invitation, joining him and eating in silence for a bit.
The young man walked over and took a sit beside Draco. “So we are doing a covering up?” He asked in a thick American accent. Back Draco and Pansy stared at him for a moment before Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, there is a page right there.”
Whispers started going around as he reached up and pulled the cigarette from the blond's mouth.
Harry nodded. “Hermione helped with most of it, but so did Parkinson.” He said, making Seamus and Ron snort.
Teddy was watching him from his swing, dozing a bit to the sound of his voice. Draco on the other hand, was sorting through some novels on Andromeda’s shelf, not even paying attention as he sang the song without any hesitation, or holding back.
“Is that why you are here?” She asked with a laugh.
He took a few deep breaths, trying to calm his rapid breathing. One hand gripped his sheets as his othe hand gripped the wand underneath his pillow. He pulled it out, brandishing it with a shaking hand. “Lumos!” The light filled the room, and he made a sweep over all the shadows. When he was sure that he was alone, he slowly started to calm now slightly. “Nox.” He whispered, sitting his wand in front of him before rubbing his eyes.
Pansy smiled, watching her as she moved around the kitchen, getting ingredients down. “Of course, Kitten.” She paused. “Should we be worried about Potter?” She asked her.
"Stop trying to leave me!" He shouted, getting irritated. Draco froze, his breath catching. "Everyone bloody leaves.." Harry whispered, feeling something crack.
The next chapter time skip to boarding the hogwarts express!!! I'm really excited to write about that and Harry's furthering jealous and feelings for our resident Malfoy!
“I won’t go.” Pansy said softly after a few tense moments.
“Yeah, just really drunk.” He chuckled, staring down into his cup. “Do you think things will ever change?” He asked her out of the blue.
Harry shrugged. "I'm not really sure." He said, thinking it over.
Hey guys! Sorry it's taking me this long to get a new chapter out! My job just went into off season and I have a week before school starts, so I'm trying to get everything updated during this week I have off! I still in complete love with this story. I really am.
James gave him a smile, pulling him into a tight hug. “Thanks.. I’m sorry too, Mate.” He said as Sirius gave a laugh, hugging him back.
Draco smirked. “It goes in my eyebrow.” He told him, picking it up and placing it back into his brow. He turned around and moved back to his room. Harry took the scissors from Pansy, placing them back into the drawer before following Draco.
“Mother broke Parole and went to stay with her cousin in  Scotland.” He said evenly, even though his movements were jerky.
.” He waved his hand motioning to the room that was crowded with beds and cots.
“What’s wrong?” She asked him, a bit concerned. He let out a sigh. “Pansy got invited to go back to Hogwarts to finish her last year.” He told her plainly.
"Okay, the total knobhead makes me want to bash his pretty little face in. Happy?" Harry sighed, rubbing his face. "I think I crossed a line, and I think you are the only one that I could possibly talk to about it without any lectures, or really any bias opinion at all which is really weird." He frowned, looking at her.
“If I explain things to her, maybe.” Hermione gave a little shrug. “I didn’t say that it was a good plan, but it’s all I’ve got at the moment’s notice.”
“Captain Oblivious is not going to know what hit him.” She scoffed. “If he can go seven years without realizing what was right in his face, then he won’t realize what we are doing.” She moved towards the bar with Hermione trailing after her.
“Draco Malfoy saved my life numerous times over the past year, not to mention he was the reason why I defeated Voldemort that last time, him and his mother.” He stated.
“Buggering shit, my mother is home.” He called to Pansy, stubbing out the cigarette before moving back into his room. He shoved some laundry off his bedside table before grabbing some air freshener. He sprayed his room, waving his hand around to try to get the smell to dissipate.
Draco was the first to wake up, a few moments after Andromeda left, and blinked a few times before realizing where he was and who he was with. In all honesty, that had been the best sleep he had gotten in months. He stared at the other, seeing the dark circles that his glasses hid. He weighed a few options in his mind before just closing his eyes. He didn’t know when and how this had happened but he didn’t want to think right now, just take in the smell of rum, grass and body spray.
She shook her head. “Andromeda, you know this Harry.” She said sternly, giving him a scowl.
Meeting the Ministry with Pansy was kind of a wild ride. They directed all questions and conversation to Harry without once looking at her. She didn't seemed bothered by it, only gritting her teeth a little. After being asked repeatedly what was being taken and where it was, Harry frowned. "Ask her, she knows where everything is." He said, pointing to Pansy.
“They weren’t sure that I was myself and asked Draco to identify me. Hermione had cast a spell that had screwed up my face where my scar was, but you could still obviously tell it was me. He told them that it wasn’t me, that he wasn’t so sure about this and that they shouldn’t call Voldemort until they were completely sure.” He paused again, a hush around the court room as everyone was stunned.
He read the journals every night before getting drunk and passing out in random places of his house. The home improvement project was actually coming along nice. Most of the house had been torn down, replaced, repainted and redecorated. It was large and spacious with tons of natural light and bright paint. It didn’t even look like the same place at all. He had added some brickwork around the fireplaces using light colored stones. The kitchen was a light sunflower yellow, the various other rooms where white while the sitting room was colored a light bluish grey. The furniture looked more like something you would find at the Burrow, handmade and comfy. Handmade throws from Molly littered the place along with plush rugs on the hardwood floors.
"Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter."
“So do you.” She said, patting his hand. Harry snuck a look at Malfoy.
Harry waited patiently before Chris left them alone to ring up Harry. Draco looked over the tattoo again, staring at it transfixed. "Why did you do this?" He asked, motioning to his arm. Harry shrugged his shoulders.
“Has Ginny talked to you?” She asked him, biting her lip as he walked over to him. She looked a little worried and slightly scared. For a moment Harry had a flashback to when they decided to go back to Hogwarts before the Battle. He felt his chest tighten and he couldn’t breathe.
“No one likes you Potter! You are a waste of space!” He yelled in Harry’s face, breathing hard.
“What do you want Harry? Chicken noodles or shrimp?” He asked, turning to look at the other. The name leaving a weird feeling on his tongue and a fluttering sensation in his stomach.  The sound of his name startled him as he stood up, making him slip as he turned towards the blond. He landed on his ass with a yell as Draco watched him with a twitching smirk. “The savior of the Wizarding World everyone.” He deadpanned.
Chris smiled sadly. “I know, but I least I tried.” He told him with a nod, leaning away. “Whoever he is, he’s a lucky bastard.”
Though, it seemed like the other kept seeking him out to say something, but didn’t go through with it in the end. Even though he had been trying to pull it out of him. He could see it in his eyes, the way they flickered, the way that he held himself back. He recognized the mask the other wore, because it was the same one that he wore for Andromeda and Hermione.  He also recognized the skittish movements the other did, because he had the same reactions to large crowds.
Harry nodded, kicking his trainers off before shedding the hoodie and hat.  Draco faked being focused on his book but his eyes were almost glued on the other through his fringe. Harry undid his jeans, pulling them off before climbing into the bed and moving to the empty side. He settled down underneath the covers, taking his glasses off looking for somewhere to set them. Draco scoffed, taking them and placing them on his bedside table.
I am looking for an rp partner for a variety of fandoms, so hmu if you are interested!!
“For what?” He asked confused, as Teddy wiggled a bit getting irritated.
"Harry in?" Ron asked, clearing his throat as Draco shut the fridge door. "No, him and Pansy are off." He answered, staying on the other side of the room.
After two hours in Kingsley’s office and another hour quarrel with the Head of the Wizengamot, Harry was finally granted the letter and sent off to talk with McGonagall. If and only if she agreed with the arrangement to let Draco back to Hogwarts, Harry would then be given custody of Draco’s wand. He was not allowed to give it to the blond until they were back at Hogwarts and the blond was to be kept under the terms of his probation until September 1
“Thank you.” He nodded, sipping the tea. “She just wanted Draco to be safe. I don’t think she ever wanted any of that. She was never really cruel to me, unlike Lucius.” He bit into a biscuit, his shoulders hunching in on themselves. Andromeda smiled at him as she sipped her own tea. “Lucius needed to be in Azkaban..” She sighed.
Hope you guys are doing well and you like this new chapter!!
Draco hoffed. “Is this going to take long?” He asked, irritated.
“I’ll go.” Harry told him, turning and walking off. Draco watched him go, lingering at the door before walking inside. He met his mother, father and Pansy in the kitchen. Pansy was making breakfast for other two, being extremely quiet.
They had been hanging out with Chris for a month when it happened. Draco had been sharing a cigarette with him outside after his show, talking about just random things as Pansy just fluttered around, drunk. Chris stubbed the cigarette out and leaned close kissing Draco’s lips lightly. Draco reacted immediately, pushing him away gently. “Chris...”

Harry had stayed for two episodes of his Buffy show that morning before leaving to go to his house, leaving Draco to do nothing all day. He fiddled with the remote to the telly, figuring out how to work it and completely being absorbed by a muggle show called “Real World” for a couple of hours.  He played with Teddy for a bit before getting sucked into a show called TRL.
“What do you need?” She asked, lounging back in her chair and glancing at her phone. Draco had been gone for almost four hours.
Draco stood there, mouth open in shock as his body went into complete shutdown. Pansy ran over to him, staring at him with large eyes. "What just happened?" She asked him, looking back to where Harry disappeared.
“Go, go have fun on your date.” He said, ushering her out.
“Stop.” He stated.
He knew he looked ridiculous, standing in their front garden in last night’s clothes and holding a cup of tea. Pansy didn’t really look that well herself, her makeup was a bit smudged around the corners of her eyes and her lipstick had rubbed off. Her eyes were a bit red.
He shook his head, pulling his hand back. Maybe he had gone finally mental. He was just so tired of people,
Over the last few weeks, Harry had been drowning his crushing emotions and feelings in a steady supply of alcohol, sometimes not even waiting for the days that he wasn’t going to Andromeda’s. He would then arrive at her home, reeking of alcohol and having the worse hangover.
"Well," Harry huffed, "Sometimes people don't want to talk about certain things."
Ron’s ears turned as red as his hair. “It’s getting…” He said quietly.
Harry wiped the tears from his eyes, smoothing the creases out of the pages as he reread the words. Some things made sense now. Actually a lot of things made sense now. He didn’t know what or how to feel. He didn’t know what to do. It was like he was getting a glimpse of something extremely private. He wanted more but he wasn’t so sure if he should.
He shook his head of his thoughts before sighing. “I think my mother thinks I’m gay.” He told her with a frown.
“I owed them both.” He shrugged. “Honey, please.” She nodded, fixing both their teas. “I just… couldn’t believe that Cissy would do that? Draco, yes, that boy doesn’t have a cruel bone in his body. I was wondering when he was going to break. Reminded me of Regulus, honestly.” She paused. “But Cissy… She-“ She stopped, plating the biscuits before bringing it and their teas over to the small battered table.  Harry joined her as Teddy settled down, nodding off to sleep.
“Draco, you didn’t do anything wrong.” She sighed. “Let’s go out tonight.”
Harry woke a little after Draco had fallen back to sleep. He grabbed his glasses, putting them on and staring down at the blond. He gave a slight smile, pushing his bangs back off his forehead, his fingers lingering there before he carefully detangled himself from the sheets and him. He covered him up again, making sure he was alright before leaving reluctantly. He might not have to worry about being hexed but Malfoy did have a damn good right hook. His face was still throbbing from last night. Probably not the best way he could have handled it, but it worked.
Let me know what you think and I have added more music to the spotify playlist!!
"Let's go home." He told him as he walked out to the lobby to pay Chris. Draco followed with a slight frown.
"What is going on out there?" Hermione asked her, blinking a bit as she got up and gave her a hug.
Harry laughed, finishing up his coffee. “Now that you mention it, she kind of does.” He grinned.  Draco turned to look at him. “You tell her that, I will murder you in the most gruesome muggle way possible.”
The trial was hasty as no one wanted to be his defense. He was dragged in like cattle to angry faces not once but three times. Once for interrogation, once to plea for his life and the last time for witnesses to speak on his behalf. Every time he was dragged out, his hands shook and he felt like he wanted to vomit all over the floor. He prepared himself the last time he was brought in to be sentenced to a life in Azkaban. He knew his fate. The judge was about seal his future at Azkaban when someone yelled out for him to wait.
He nodded, finally catching sight of Harry. “Morning..” He muttered, turning a bit pink before hurrying over to the stove.
She looked at him for a moment and then nodded. “Sorry, I didn’t think about that.”
Harry felt his face flush a bit at that. “No, not really. We had cake and everyone got drunk. Traditional 18
Hello! I hope everyone is well. I spent over a week writing and editing this massive update for you. Over 12 pages and almost 6k words. I really wanted to get into the slow mindset of Draco and Harry again, but I also wanted to get Ginny's insight over all of this. I feel like Harry would really talk to her about things, which was what lead to the events in the beginning of the fic. I really hope you like it! Kudos and comments are appreciated!
After a few moments, he let out a long sigh before grabbing his phone. He sent a text out to Hermione, noting that it was almost seven in the morning. He had at least maybe three hours of sleep then. He chucked his phone onto the bed before getting up and making his way to the kitchen.
"Harry..." He pushed his bangs back again, holding them up as he looked down at him. "It's fine... I have a feeling you have been bottling everything up. Pff Gryffindors.." He said with a smirk.
“I.. have been talking to Malfoy..” He muttered.
After getting everything unpacked, Pansy and Draco took the money that Harry had given him and bought groceries. The other had nothing in his kitchen but bottles of alcohol. Which Draco poured out in the sink, Potter be damned.
“Why wouldn’t you?” He countered, pulling the soup out of the bag.
"Yeah, just people." He joked. The other looked at him suspiciously. "I'm fine, Draco. I swear."
“Like she would know what they were if she saw them.” He rolled his eyes. “She put my mobile in the ice box and then almost had a break down when it started to ring.”
He felt his chest constrict as flashes of their hollow lifeless faces came and when and his ears filled with the sounds of screaming. He gasped, wanting nothing more to shut down. He called to Andromeda that he was leaving before hurrying out as fast as he could.
“Looks can be deceiving.” She told him with a smile. “Also you can’t compare yourself to someone else. It takes time to be okay…”
“Do you really think that you are singularly the only person?” He continued with a hiss. “People died, Malfoy. People died and they aren’t coming back.” He yelled, making Draco bit his lip with a frown.
“Yes, mother. I was thinking of eating in my room.” He told her.
“No, I’m here to see George, but I thought I would ask since the last thing I kind of remember is talking to you.”
Draco shook his head. "I just wanted it to be as normal as possible."  She nodded. "Pansy and me wanted that too, so that’s why we didn’t enter together." She told him before looking over and scanning the Slytherin table.  "Follow me." She said, taking his hand.  Draco looked at her confused before she leaned over to Harry. "You're a prat." She told him, making Harry chuckle after a bit. He shrugged his shoulders before Ginny scoffed. "Prat. I'm taking him." She got up and pulled Draco with her before walking over to where Pansy was and sitting down next to her. Draco sat down on the seat on the other side of Pansy with a smirk. "Hello, love."  He greeted.  Pansy chuckled. "Missed you."
Ginny got up, shouldering her bag. “I can understand if this was just a summer thing.” She told her with an awkward smile.
Draco took a deep breath, walking into the room and moving to Pansy’s side. Pansy gave him a nod, her eyes darting to Lucius. The old man was sitting at the kitchen table, a mug of something in front of him and a scowl on his face.
“I know Pans, but you don’t have to worry about me. I’ll be alright, I have to live with my decisions.” He said quietly, turning all his attention on perfectly painting her nails.
“Call me if you need anything..” She told him, leaning down and pecking him on the cheek. He gave her a tight smile before nodding. “I will.”
“Draco..” She whispered, biting her lip. “Draco.. is that you or your father talking?” She asked him.
I'm pretty sure everyone can see what Pansy is planning to do.... Who else could get under Harry Potter's skin like a Malfoy? XD
He didn’t know how he had come to be standing outside a very shady looking muggle “tattoo” shop but he was never one to question Pansy when she was on a mission. He took a look at his Dark Mark, biting his lip. Did he really deserve to start a new life?
"I can't... sleep.  I haven't really been able to since that night..." He told him, pulling his knees up.
Please Comment and tell me what you guys liked about it.
Once he was packed he and Ron slowly brought his trunk down the stairs. He peeked around the corner to see that all the commotion was taking place in a far corner of the sitting room. Molly had her back to them as George yelled over Ginny’s loud sobbing, covered in something green and nasty as the rest of the family circled around them. George got louder when he caught sight of Harry and Ginny shoved him, smearing the green slime on his face. This resulted in a terribly fake but convincible enough fist fight that completely distracted Molly from everything else.
He felt Hermione's worrying eyes on him as he felt panic bubbling up in his chest and he quickly scanned for where Draco had gone. The other was standing a few feet away, talking with Pansy and smoking away. His body felt heavy and he felt paralyzed to do anything about it.
“She is not my girlfriend.” Pansy said loudly as a tall lanky man appear from behind the curtain.
“What do you mean?” Hermione asked, frowning. Draco rolled his eyes. “You might be smart but you are really dense Granger.” He blew out smoke. Hermione waved her hand in front of her face. “Smoke, Malfoy.”
Draco leaned over the kitchen sink, waiting for the water to turn warm, biting his lip against the stinging pain from another botched attempt to remove the mark from his arm. It was one of the reasons why he hadn’t gotten into the pool at all. The chlorine stung worse than anything he had ever felt in his life. He was leaning over the sink when he heard the sliding glass door open and close.
Harry paused, thinking a bit. Draco frowned, staring at him. “What is that face? Are you having like a stroke or something?”
Especially times like this.
“Me and Pansy are about to leave!” He called back. “Oh, Pansy dear would you mind making Dinner? I can’t start the muggle Firestarter.”
Harry closed the journal he had been reading, and looked at the time on the display of his phone. He sighed heavily before getting up. His birthday party was in a bit and Hermione would be here soon to “show” him the way. Right now he was feeling that anything would be better than this party. Washing the floorboards, watching lint collect in the corner of his wash room. Visit his parents graves.
“Andromeda Black? Do you really think she will help us?” She asked, a little skeptical.
Draco watched him with a worried look. “Don’t..” He said before clearing his throat. “Don’t hurt my tattoo.”
“Broke him?” He asked, hugging himself.
“You’re stuck with me.” Harry told him.
I will get back to writing as soon as I get back from Con. I don't plan on drinking this con because of my new medications so I won't be hung over. XD lmao.
Ginny and Hermione started to giggle at that. “He’s not lying.” Ginny said with a smirk. “Apparently I can’t win this.” Dean said before sitting back in defeat.
"I... I lived in the cupboard under the stairs until I was 11." He whispered. "When I was living with my aunt and uncle."
Harry frowned. “No
“Leave me alone  Potter!” Draco yelled.
Harry actually felt sorry for the other. He moved into the room as Draco buried his face into blue hair. “I’ve shushed and I’ve cooed and I’ve even try to sing in the exact voice of Ringo. Now all I have left is to hope that a dingo will sneak in and rip off your fat bitching head…*” He whispered, just giving up.
Sirius opened his mouth to say something as James stood there, looking guilty. “No! You don’t get to say anything!” Remus spat. “Is that what you have been doing? Have you ‘gotten over’ me? Have you just ruled me hopeless? Is that why you have been telling James these things. Because the Pads I know would have encouraged and supported his brother!” He was breathing hard. “I at least deserve the truth and a goodbye. I don’t need your pity or you staying with me because you feel guilty or obligated to!” He bit his lip, shocked that that had come out of his mouth. This wasn’t about him. It was about James and Sirius and Lily. His love life could come later. “Nevermind, dealing with that later. NOW APOLOGIZE TO YOUR BROTHER!” He demanded, making everyone jumped and Lily tried to hide a smile.
“So assuming from Malfoy’s reaction, you haven’t told him about us all hanging out all this time?” She asked. Ginny sighed. “Just like how you haven’t told Ron?”
“Ron and Hermione aren’t the only ones with a kiss before Battle story.” Seamus smiled at Dean.
It starts off during the hours that Draco went missing at the party and continues till long after the party is over. PLEASE READ THE NOTES FOR WARNINGS FOR THIS CHAPTER!
He sat up quickly when he heard the floorboards outside his door creak. The door slowly opened and he brandished his wand, breath coming out in quick pants. It took a moment for the panic to subside when he realized it was Draco and he laid back down rubbing his face. The blond didn't say anything as he moved quietly into the room stopping at the bed hesitantly. He wrapped his arm around his middle before turning on his heel and hurrying back to the door.
“Back in my sixth year at Hogwarts, he didn’t know it, but he saved my life by appearing in the tower. If he hadn’t shown, I wouldn’t have hidden, nor would have Snape appeared. I would have surely been captured by Death Eaters that night and tortured by Voldemort. A month before the Battle of Hogwarts, me, Hermione and Ron were captured by Bellatrix and a bunch of other death eaters.” He paused, taking a deep breath as he clenched his fists together to still their shaking.
“Making breakfast, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and it’s a little after 7.” He answered in order, taking down a plate and placing eggs and bacon on it.
"No, Harry. School is in a week. You have a serpent on your left arm. Harry, your left arm." Draco said, worried. "What are people going to think?"
She looked at him pointedly over her shoulder, taking down the chocolate biscuits. She moved to the cupboard and took down two mugs. “You didn’t have to. You could have just washed your hands of all this madness.” She told him. “Milk or Honey?”
Draco gave a chuckle, shoving the other away from him. “You are really damaged Potter.” He said, shaking his head but couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation.
"Move it, you birds!" Dean muttered, shoving through the crowd with Seamus and shutting the door behind them. The compartment was starting to get cramped now. "Just Harry's fan club outside and also it's pretty much open season on Malfoy." Seamus explained.
He took his mobile out of his pocket, walking down the pavement as he texted Hermione to ask Pansy for Malfoy’s address.
“5 galleons he doesn’t get it and continues to piss of Ginny.” George said with a smirk.
Draco looked at him unsure. “It wouldn’t violate your probation and they shouldn’t have a problem since it’s me.” Harry added.
“They can and they are!” Draco yelled back.
Draco nodded. “First of all, what are you doing? And secondly, what are you watching? And thirdly, what time is it?”
, treating him like glass, like he was fragile and would break at any second. He just wanted to be normal. Just Harry… He didn’t know what was normal anymore, but it just felt great to have someone not give a damn about how they were around him.
Chris sighed, pulling the cigarette from behind his ear before slipping it between his lips. "Of course." He muttered before moving over to Harry. The other looked up before blinking. "You were at my birthday party." He said, remembering that night.  He also didn't like the way that Chris was a little too comfortable around Draco.
“No, I don’t. I don’t even like anyone.” Harry said with a shrug. “It’s alright Harry.” Hermione said with a pitying smile, placing her hand on his. He pulled his hand away and placed them both under the table in his lap. He saw Dean and Seamus giving him the same look. “I’m fine.” He told them. It wasn’t that far from the truth. He was fine in that department. His love life was something that wasn’t even on the list of things he worried about. He didn’t really have a good track record to start with. He had liked Cho, and Ginny… And had liked Luna for a while, but that turned into a more of a friend thing. He really didn’t know where he stood on the dating thing. He didn’t think he could be comfortable around another person to even consider dating.
“Harry knows more than he lets on, just so you know. You really don’t have to work that hard to make him really acknowledge what you want him to. A soft nudge in the right direction should do it. By the way that everything just went down, that was more of a violent shove.” Ginny laughed.
“My friend.” She said pointedly.
After a bit, he placed his fork down, giving a hollow chuckle. “They left me.. and I have Potter of all people making my breakfast.. And I thought it couldn’t get worse..” He sighed.
“You were the one stalking me! You’ve been completely obsessed with me!” Draco yelled, stepping closer to Harry in his anger.
"Yes, called me a stubborn twat. That I didn't have a self preservating bone in my body.  Said that everyone would blame him." Harry shrugged.
’ card and everyone just did what they were told. Not only was his probation cut two months early, actually eight months early, but he was getting his wand back and he was going back to Hogwarts. He shook his head. Fucking Bastard…
Hestia Jones-
It was his signature move. He would push and pull until he pushed the person to the point of not even wanting to bother with him anymore. He would let himself have what he wanted for a moment’s notice before his mind realized it, pulling back and doing what he thought other people expected of him. Mostly his parents. He would talk himself out of anything that brought him an ounce of happiness, feeling the compulsion to be this rigid model that his parents had cut out for him.
“I know something is wrong, what is wrong with him? He looked exhausted last night.”  He asked again, knowing that if it was enough to break through the ice mask that Parkinson was famous for than it must be something bad.
“Why not?” Pansy asked him. “Just don’t think about it. Just do it. You have to leave your parents some time Draco.”
“I have a date… but if you want I can cancel.” She told him, sitting up. Draco was silence for a very long time, so long that Pansy became worried and moved to get up. “Bring her along.” He finally stated.
Harry chuckled. “Nevermind, I mean I have enough money I suppose and I have a house, so I guess I just need to make the most of it.” He gave a small nod as a sharp knock sounded at the door. He looked up to see George and Ginny hurry in.
Draco felt the blood drain out of his face, staring at Harry in shock. It was there for a moment before it disappeared. "He's not abusive." He muttered.
“You truly are mental.” Draco said looking up from his food. “You want me to hit you?”
Draco nodded. "Why are you going back to school if you already have a job you wanted while you were there?" He asked him.
“Oh, that’s Chris. One of Pansy and Draco’s friends.” Luna said as she drifted over, bringing Neville with her. Harry was now in the center of a very small circle. “Draco baked you a birthday cake.” She continued. “Pansy says it’s either chocolate or Angel food. She couldn’t remember.”
“I brought Lunch.” He told him, reaching up and  scratching the back of his neck. The blond’s face scrunched up in confusion. “First of all, if you haven’t noticed it’s dinner time. Secondly, what are you doing?” He asked, placing the book back onto the shelf using his left hand.
He bit his lip, growling in frustration before marching off, making an obscene gesture with his finger at Harry as he left.
and her friend. I know a few nice places. Put everything behind you. Especially that.” She said, moving her free hand to where his dark mark was peeping out from underneath his rolled sleeves.
Harry took a deep breath through his nostrils. "What's it to you?" He moved over and snatched the book from him.
“Why are you coming out of the window like some bad romantic comedy?” He asked, chuckling. “Draco’s parents are home.” She said, laughing at how absurd the whole thing was. Harry laughed with her. “I won’t tell Hermione.”
“Don’t you listen, I told you why I was. Pay attention, you can do that simple thing can’t you?”
The abrupt screaming cutting through the unnerving silence that he had gotten used to caused him to break. He screamed along with the portrait he slammed his fist into the corner denting the frame. He needed to get out. He knew one place that he wanted to go, been needing to go. Andromeda had sent an owl asking after him, and maybe he could ask her how to remove this blasted thing once and for all.
The next photo was one that look like James and Peter were helping Sirius serenade a bandaged and blushing Remus in the Hogwarts courtyard.  He raised an eyebrow but just shrugged it off. He smiled at the photo of his parents in Christmas sweaters and his dad with an antlers headband atop his head. He never knew his dad was such a nerd. Antlers? Really Dad? His mother seems to echo that thought as she rolled her eyes in the photo but still smiled.

Draco woke up first, moving down to the kitchen leaving Harry sleeping in his bed. He was in the middle of making Harry a cup of coffee when his mother walked in. She moved close to him. “Making breakfast?” She asked him, a bit softly.
Draco turned on his heel frowning at him. "I was trying to be considerate. I shouldn't be here."
“*Sleep little baby, try not squawk. Tomorrow and tomorrow you’ll learn how to walk. To love and laugh, to toddle and talk, but for now beddy-byes.” He sang in a frustrated, lofty voice that Harry recognized from school.  He bit his lip to keep from laughing before inching closer and watching the blond.
“Let me have him Malfoy.” Harry said, giving him a soft smile. Draco’s head shot up and he glared at him. “What are you doing here?” He asked, but handed over Teddy.
Draco looked down at his feet for a long moment before answering. “I will.” He assured her.
"Just wondering. The guy was at my party." Harry shrugged.
“Go on.” The judge urged as hushed mutters echoed behind him.
Harry took his mobile out of his pocket and brought up a photo he had snapped at the party. He handed it over to George. He took it, staring at the image. “That is really freaky.” He said before handing it back.
and come scream at me on insta @havenskyward13
“He said that did he?” He muttered, looking at the blond. “When did he start to look like that? Mr. Prim and Proper with piercings and tattoos.”
“So that’s the complication.” He said, nodding as Draco covered up his arm as he moved to go upstairs. “Does he know that you like him?” Chris asked again.
Hope everyone is doing well and is safe.
Harry frowned, shrugging of his robes before moving over to the other's bed. He picked up the scarf that Draco had disguarded and wrapped it around his neck. "How do I look?"
“Yes and no.” Ginny answered her. “I really don’t know anymore.” She paused what she was doing. “But I wouldn’t worry about Draco. Whatever set Harry off, he won’t stop until everything is taken care of.”  She gave her a small reassuring smile.
Draco frowned. "I was just trying to have a conversation, Potter." He said, the last name feeling weird around his tongue now.
Ginny took mercy on Draco and moved over, sitting down next to him. "You don't have to say here if you don't want to. Harry gets an idea in his head and he doesn't think." She told him with a smile.
Harry stopped what he was doing, turning to him. “Me? You are the one that is stalking me.”
Harry looked up from the journal, wiping at his eyes as he clicked his mobile to check the time.
Seamus smiled. “Great, we got a place near here. Nothing too fancy but it’s home.”
"To be honest, yes." He said, looking up at him.
"Last time to back out, Potter." Draco chuckled.
“You don’t think it would be too much?” She asked him, turning around. She was dressed in a black tulle dress that was almost completely silver with the waterfall of sequins.
"My... friend wanted to get a tattoo done. He has an appointment with Chris." He told her. Stephanie smiled. "I'll get him." She said, walking off.
Narcissa smiled tightly at her son, not getting too close to the muggle appliances. “Thank you Pansy. You are such a dear.”
It took a long time to do the things he had wanted to do because his brain was all over the place. He felt like he was suffocating. The dread completely covering him like a thick blanket and he just couldn’t move or breath. He felt like he was going to break but he kept pushing through, the words of both Pansy and Hermione running through his head on a loop. His stomach was tight and a few times he had to stop and be sick in a few bushes, but he kept going. He had to do this. He
“I’m sure Remus has a lot of things that belong to your parents and photographs and such.” She shrugged. “I really haven’t moved or looked at anything so I don’t know what is there.”
She turned to face him. “What do you want to do?” She asked him. Harry took a moment, standing there thinking about it. “I don’t know what I want..” He finally said softly.
Harry moved to help her, turning the trunk right side up and placing He the items savaged inside. Once that was done, he moved around, collecting over things like books and journals. He left the clothing there, not even bothering with it. With Pansy's help, they pretty much cleared the room of everything Draco left behind that was valuable to him. Once they were given the go ahead, they left carting the trunk back home.
“What in the name of Salazar are you wearing?” Lucius hissed, staring at his son. Draco was still wearing Harry’s shirt and a pair of ripped skinny jeans. “Muggle clothes.” Draco replied, his head held high and the mask back in place.
“Oh Harry! Perfect!” She smiled at him, dusting herself off. She had on a pair of blue jeans with a flannel shirt on over a grey tank top. He smiled at her, shrugging off his jacket before walking over. “What are you going to do with it?” He asked her, pointing to the motorbike. “I was going to see if you wanted it.” She told him, looking it over. “I’m sure you can fix it up, give you something to do, other than destroying my aunt’s house for the greater good.” She winked at him.
It was another two days before Harry was able to get back to Andromeda’s. He had been working himself to death fixing the house up. He had become a regular at the DIY Centre, the cashier knowing him by name now and always seem delighted to help him. It was always strange that he dropped everything to help him with his questions every time he came in, no matter how many customers were there in the shop.
“Because I want you there, and Pansy wants me there. It’s the last time I get to hang out before I go back to Hogwarts. Please?” She pouted.
Ginny bit her lip, looking down at her feet before looking back up as George sighed. “Hurry up and go, we will handle Mum.” He told Harry.
“Merlin stripped pants I am putting the fucking bloody muggle money into the slot.” Draco fumed softly, the loud computer generated voice of the checking machine screaming at him about his purchase.
“It’s okay. We can hang out some other time before you go back.” He told her.  She leaned over hugging him. “You’ll be fine.”
"Get to bed." Draco told him, lightly shoving his shoulder. Harry's eyes flickered to the bed behind him. "I don't know if I can sleep.." He admitted after a moment.
"Pansy is not officially dating your sister because the Weaslette doesn't want to upset you." He chuckled as Ron looked away at that. "Dating a big bad Slytherin will definitely twist  Mummie and big brother's knickers."
Harry came back in about an hour to check if the blond was still asleep and froze when he slipped into the room. Draco looked up guiltly. "It was stabbing me in the neck. " He explained, and Harry wanted to kick himself.
“I.. guess..” Harry said, moving to the window.
“Why not?” She asked, adjusting her cleavage before the master bedroom door opened again. “Draco? Can you make Dinner?” His mother called out.
“I think I’m just a little too old to be going to parties, and no one wants a toddler at their 18
"Sorry about the feast. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable." He told him.
“If you need anything, just text or ring me.” He told him, moving out of the room. “I will.” Draco told him. Harry turned back, walking over to him and fishing something out of his pocket. “Here.” He said, placing a wad of muggle money into his hand before leaving. Draco stared at his hand in complete shock.
"Just wondering huh?" She asked, unconvinced.
come scream at me on insta @havenskyward13
He turned, walking backwards a bit. “Yeah, most likely.” He called back with a laugh.
, Pansy thought as she hurried off.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco bit his lip, not wanting to answer. It seemed so stupid now. A complete invasion of privacy.
“You make shit eggs.” He said after a bit, finishing up his breakfast. Harry smiled around the brim of his mug.
“What about you Harry?” Seamus asked. Harry looked up from his drink. “What about me?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Dude, ask him the fuck out. He's already turned me down once before, but I can always try again." He said, making Harry jerk. Chris leaned his body onto Harry's arm. "Stay the fuck still. I have a reputation to maintain." He grunted, finishing up before wiping him clean.
“Why would you?” Draco asked him, staring at their joined hands.
He picked up one of the piercings from the counter. He turned Draco’s head, placing it back into the hole.
(Also I might have taken a day or two off to binge Riverdale. SO GOOD!)
Harry smiled at her. “Do you happen to know where I left my clothes at last night?” He asked her.
“What have you two been scheming?” Ginny asked from Pansy’s other side.
“ ‘mione what’s going on?” He leaned forward concerned.
She took hold of his hand, following him out.
"Ministry?" He asked, laying his head on Harry's chest. "To get your school things from your manor." Harry told him.
“Sure.” Harry said with a nod. “This way..” He motioned for the other to follow him down to the kitchen. “Are you hungry?” He asked when they reached the bottom.
Harry snorted. "Like you are one to talk."
"Ron Weasley and Blaise Zambini."
Ron walked over to his side, biting his lip. “I read your message… Hermione is busy with the birthday planning. Apparently the place that she was going to have it at canceled on her.”
Harry stopped what he was doing, taking his face in his hands. “You are not a bad person. Just a person that had bad things and bad choices put upon them. You did what you had to do. The world isn’t black and white.” He told him, looking at the last piercing, unsure of where it went.
“No, because he’s a muggle.” He frowned. “I will not
Ginny smiled, shaking her head a bit. “Harry is going through a lot of shit. We talked about some of it after the trial, the night he came to the Burrow.” She told Hermione. “He’s just tired and scared. He just wants to be left alone. The kind of alone that isn’t alone though, because being alone with your thoughts is dangerous. I should know that. And I.. I wasn’t the right person for that.. for him. I knew that, even before the battle, but more so after. I couldn’t be the person he needed. Because I couldn’t be anything but gentle with him, because I cared too much.” She sighed. “We all need that special something or someone to help heal. He wasn’t mine and I wasn’t his.”
“Nothing.” Pansy waved off the question. “I’m not doing it for you or Potter. I’m doing it for the last shred of hope that this awful plan of yours still works, because I don’t know about your end; but mine is doing down fast.” She frowned deeply, thinking about the note she had fished out of the bin after Draco had left.
"I don't follow." Harry said, whincing.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “And leave Pansy to the mercy of my parents?” He asked.
“Good morning.” She smirked around her cup, turning to look at him.
Harry finally removed his arms from Draco's middle, reaching out and taking hold of Draco's wrist. He looked over the puckering flesh of the never healing wound. "You need to stop picking at it." He said, making the blond jerk it back a bit. Harry swallowed. "Sorry.."
Pansy bit her lip, trying to keep the laugh in but couldn’t stop the smile on her face. Of course that’s what Potter would think.
“No. This is the most “you” you’ve been in all the years I’ve known you. I am not going to just let you lose that. I am not going to let you shrivel up into something that isn’t you just to please other people.” She glared at him. Draco nodded, looking away from her.
“My name is Chris and I’ll being doing your tattoo.” He said, taking the page and nodding. “Shirt off.”
The Aurors turned and looked at Pansy in her short skirt, heels and designer blouse. "Follow me." She said, leading the lot into the house before going up to Draco's room. It was small in comparison to the house with large windows over looking the garden. It had a reading nook in one of the windows near the oak four poster bed. She moved to the trunk sitting spilled over on its side and started to sift through the contents, much to the displeasure of the Aurors.
“Brands aren’t really easy to get rid of, especially ones with dark ink. But it seems like yours is faded a lot so it shouldn’t be too hard.” She opened a large binder, flipping through some pages. She turned the binder around for Draco to see.
Harry sighed and looked at Ron finally. “I need to get out of here… No offense Ron but your Mum has really lost the plot… I know she means well but bloody hell…” He whispered, running his hand over his face before reaching for his glasses. He sat up, pulling them on and sighed.
Draco was wearing a flannel long sleeve shirt over a black tank top and ripped black jeans. He was barefoot with a cigarette hanging between his lips. “Yeah, I’m done with everything basically.” He sat  down next to her, knocking ash off onto the stones before opening his beer.
"Ron, seriously, you said you weren't going to do this." Harry told him with a sigh.
“Are you sure? Because Hermione told me another story.” He frowned up at him.
“My girlfriend is very bossy and controlling.” She smirked. “And Draco wanted to go out.” She told him.
The line that starts with 'its like your screaming' comes from the opening of Rihanna's We found Love. I just couldn't stop thinking about it and well it fits!!
“Your grandmother is a very scary woman.” He cooed to Teddy, getting hit with the letter on the shoulder by the older witch. “See.” Harry laughed, taking the letter and putting it back into his pocket.
“Just let her have her fun I guess…” Ron shrugged. Harry chuckled, placing his mug on the table. “How is the shop doing?” He asked, curious on how the joke shop was faring with George still in Romania.
"Couldn't sleep." Ron muttered and the sentiment was echoed by  everyone.  "Has anyone seen Harry and Draco?"
Harry rolled his eyes, “Shut it Malfoy.” He chuckled. The blond stood there, his eyes locked on the other’s fingers on his arm. Harry’s thumb was slowly rubbing right over the dark mark without flinching or any signs of disgust or hesitation. Draco took a sharp intake of breath, pushing down those feelings before clearing his throat.
“How have you been?” She asked him as he settled Teddy on his hip, bouncing him lightly as the toddler sucked on his thumb.
Draco listened to him without interrupting, holding him still. " No one will ever understand just how... much it hurts.." He breathed. "You feel hopeless, like nothing in the world can save you.."
… He thought turning back to the stove.

Draco laid there, breathing hard before slowly pulling himself up. He moved  gently to the bathroom to wash his bleeding nose before going back to find Harry.
“At least your parents have like 6 other chances to have an heir.” She muttered, moving to her armoire. She opened it, shifting through it before pulling out a shirt. She closed the drawer before pulling off her other shirt.
Harry chuckled. “Had to do something. It was more for Sirius than for me, to tell you the truth. At first, I was just angry and then it sort of morphed into this challenge.” He chuckled, going into an in depth retelling of his first night at Grimmauld Place.
He chuckled and started to dance with her, flittering around with his arms in the air just like her.
Harry watched him go, confused before turning to the dark haired woman. She shrugged, grabbing her own food before following after the blond.
“I have Andy… and Potter… as much as I don’t understand that. Go. I won’t stand here and let you throw this opportunity away. You’ve already stopped using magic because of me.” He said calmly.
There was more whispering when they got off of the train at Hogsmeade station, not to mention Harry was practically bum rushed by the gaggle of girls that had been waiting, or more like stalking, outside his train compartment. They were all fawning over him and Harry was trying to be nice but just wanted to be left alone. Draco could see the irritation slowly rise on Harry's face before he moved in, parted the fan club like the red sea, and pulled Harry into the next available carriage. The dark haired man didn't miss the nasty looks the girls gave Draco as they took off.
“You changed it a lot.” He said, surprised as he looked around.
“Easy?! You think this is easy?” He hissed. “Having no magic, living without any magic? Without anything or anyone?!” He yelled, rearing back and punching him in the face as hard as he could. Harry’s head jerked to the right with the force, knocking his glasses askew.
He bit his lip, looking around the room before coming back to look at them. “You are serious?” He asked again before getting up.
He nodded, making sure that he sat with correct posture and on the edge so he didn’t leave an imprint. Andromeda gave him a knowing smile. “You can relax Draco, I have a toddler. Spilt tea and sofa impressions are the least of my worries.”
“You have to remember that I know what I am doing and that I am of age and that like I said I don’t want arguments.” He told his coffee.
“If you are so smart, fix it then.” Draco hissed at Harry. “That was the plan. I wouldn’t want you to go without a stove.” Harry smirked. “Though, don’t let your mum touch it again..” He said, turning back to it, stripping the wires off and started to put the new ones on.
"Arse." Draco scoffed after a moment before letting go of his fringe and letting the other go.  Draco rolled his eyes as he moved back to Pansy, who more than happily gave him his cigarette back.
“Apologize.” Hit. “NOW!” Hit. “I can’t deal with a Sirius and a James like this! I miss old Padfoot and Prongs!” Hit.
It had been really late when he had finally finished fixing Malfoy’s stove. No one had come downstairs since the blond had stormed off. He had looked through their fridge before making a nice breakfast that the others could heat up in the morning. He left a list of instructions for the two on top of the Tupperware, before cleaning up and walking out. He made sure he locked the door behind him before rushing home.  Malfoy actually only lived a little over two miles from him, so it was a fairly easy and quick walk.  When he arrived home, he shrugged out of his jacket and past out in his bed without much help.
"I got a snitch. On my ass." He told him as Draco poured the liquid into the mug.
Harry snorted. “Well her coping mechanism is driving me around the bin.” He muttered, stretching before getting off the cot. He stopped and sighed again. “I’m moving into Grimmauld Place..”
"Are you gay Harry?"
Ron stared at him, gaping like a fish before closing his mouth and scratching the back of his neck. “Alright..”
We've had Harry's thoughts on the matter, Draco's thoughts on the matter, know it's time for Pansy's thoughts on the matter. Also more of Draco is clueless about muggle things.
“I’m surprised he hasn’t caught on to something being wrong. I mean I called Malfoy fit for Merlin sakes and he said nothing. Nothing!” Hermione frowned, crossing her legs under the café table. Pansy was sitting across from her, compact open and reapplying lipstick. “Are you serious?” She asked, eyeing her over the top of the compact.
“It’s like he doesn’t even register what is going on around him. Like he just isn’t there, and that scares me.” Hermione shifted, uncrossing her legs again. “I don’t know what to do.”
So it was a little odd that Andromeda sent out Pansy with a message for him. Teddy’s babysitter hadn’t shown up and she couldn’t get in touch with them. She couldn’t leave the house and had asked if Draco could maybe go find them. The address she had given him was not that far from his house actually so he agreed.
“Of course she bloody fucking did.” He spat. “I miss when she could keep her mouth shut about everything.”
“Draco’s.” He answered, saying goodbye before hanging up.
“I can read.” He huffed at her around his cigarette, stirring the contents in the skillet as Pansy moved to grab the sauce. “I’m not sure what it means by saute, but I guess just let it cook? Why in Merlin’s name did you have to buy something so complicated.”  She frowned. “All because of Potter.” She muttered under her breath, making Draco whack her with the spoon he was using.
He shoved the letter into his pocket, moving to the floo. He arrived to an uproar in the Burrow. He walked out to see Molly crying, Ginny dancing around cheering, Ron completely red-faced and shocked and Hermione beaming.
“I don’t know what happened, exactly. He just stopped being Draco. Right after your party.” She told him straight out, a frown on her face as she stared at him.
Draco was humiliated. He couldn’t even look up from his shoes. If they still jailed him, he was as good as dead.
“Zach, it’s fine, I’ve got it.” He said, popping out of his hiding spot as Draco rounded on the other.
Narcissa nodded. “You are such a great girlfriend.” She smiled at her before leaving, shutting the door behind her. Pansy moved over, hanging off the side of the bed to check on Ginny.
Harry didn’t get a chance to answer her because Draco appeared at the bottom of the stairs, looking a bit disheveled. He stared at Andromeda before smiling widely. “Andy!” He moved over, hugging her tightly. “Is mother at home?” He asked her, completely forgetting that Harry was there.
Draco looked over the bright colors and the openness of the room. He smiled slightly, feeling calm for the first time since his father came back home. He hugged himself tightly before turning to look at the other. Harry had picked up the bottle of bourbon before twisting the top off.
“Fuck you!” He yelled, grabbing a spatula and hitting Harry square in the back. Harry jumped, choking a bit on his coffee. “You wish, Draco.” He called, settling down in his chair and starting to eat. Draco bit his lip, shaking his head. Fucking Gryffindors.
He sat the mug on his desk before going back to laying on his bed. Six more months. It would be February when, or even if they let them off probation. Because his father would never change. The wizarding world would love nothing more than to keep them here, away from their home, away from family and friends. Away from everything that they had ever known. Away from everything he knew and known. He moved to the window, opening it looking out over the street.
fit and tan naked torso, covered in grease and sweat went along with those legs. Draco bit his lip as the other emerged fully. Green eyes locked with grey and they both froze in sheer shock.
“Draco. I asked a question.”  Lucius said, his voice rising.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know because it happened to me." He said, getting up from the floor. Draco looked over at him, raising an eyebrow.
There was no one to ask all the questions filling his head. Everyone was dead! THEY WERE DEAD! They were dead and no one could answer his questions!
Harry checked his phone seeing two missed calls from Hermione. He should have known she would want to know why he left last night and if he was alright. He moved around his house, picking up things and looking around for something to do. He sent a quick text to Hermione, telling her he was fine at home before retrieving the journal he had been reading the other night.
Harry gave him a smile. “I know… but they are changing and Pansy isn’t a bad person.” He told him.
"I don't see you sitting anywhere else." Pansy smirked at him. "Well, you're here." He chuckled.
He showered taking his time before standing in front of his closet trying to decide what to wear. He settled on a pair of acid washed jeans and a tshirt before grabbing his swimming trunks.  He was just finishing his coffee in the kitchen when Hermione appeared out of his fireplace.
“Sure you do.” Draco chuckled hollowly.
“Saute means.. you turn the heat down and you let it cook for a bit.” Harry wheezed, walking into the kitchen and taking the spoon from Draco and moving to the skillet. Draco moved to check on the rest of the things and Pansy moved to set the table.
“Who said you could come in my house? Maybe I didn’t want to fix it. What makes you think you are wanted? Why are you always around?” He growled.
"What am I inking you with today?" Chris asked him, looking Harry over as the other did the same. Chris was a few inches taller, only because of his boots. They had the same black hair, Chris's was a little shaggier. They both had green eyes, though Chris was covered in piercings and tattoos, and all Harry had going for him was glasses and scars.
Harry snorted a bit at the question before nodding. “Yeah, if you want to.”
Harry’s mobile rang around 1 am. He quickly answered it, making sure that it hadn’t woke up Draco. The blond was asleep, snuggled into his side with his head tucked in the crook of his shoulder and chest.
“Completely serious.” He asked with determination.
Ginny jumped down, dusting off her jeans before turning around and jumping. “Shit Harry!” She hissed, placing her hand over her heart. “Why must you always do that?” She hit him with a frown. Draco snickered, his sentiments exactly.
Pansy coughed to cover up the laugh she couldn’t hold in. Draco’s head snapped to her. “Traitor.” He whispered to her. She broke down a bit, laughing softly. “You bought a spout..” She muttered, covering her face with her hands.
Pansy was trying to not laugh, hiding her mouth behind her hand. “Traitor.” Draco hissed at her.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What is it?” Hermione asked hesitantly, not sure if she liked where this was going. “Oh, don’t give me that look Granger. It has nothing to do with Ginny.” She scoffed. Hermione relaxed a bit at that. “So what is it?” She asked.
His dreams that night were filled with dark marks. His fingertips slowly running over soft but scarred skin. Colorful flowers blooming as he made a pathway….
“And it seems the big bad Draco Malfoy has conquered the big bad microwave.” Harry chuckled, watching him.
“Hear me out.” She said, raising her hands up as if to caution him.
Harry nodded. “I understand.” He said, dropping it.
“Thanks..” He said, beating his pillow before laying down and closing his eyes.
"Ah yes, the Great Harry Potter in Slytherin colors. I think the Gryffindors would have a stroke." Draco muttered sarcastically. Harry looked over at him, taking in everything as the other stood there, slightly self conscience. "Is there something on my face?" Draco asked after a bit.
could be better than this party.
“This is very hard on him, Draco, please understand.”
"Did you read it?" He asked, looking away from him.
Draco didn’t answer him as he grabbed the mug and walked out and up the stairs. He moved into Pansy’s room, crawling into her bed and close to her. “Draco? Draco what’s wrong?” She asked, sitting up and pulling him close. “C-Can you give this to Harry, please?” He asked her, not able to stop the tears.
After a tour of the house, they settled down in the front room to eat and watch movies. They ate in silence for a while, watching a random movie that Draco had picked.
He shook his head. “I’m a high school dropout, Hermione. Nothing for me now.”
“Where are you?” She asked him.
"Ginny, what the bloody-" He protested, tripping over his feet before giving up and following her.
“Set them up?” Hermione asked her skeptically. “I’m not so sure Harry would go with that.”
“You’re a good girlfriend.” He told her, motioning to Pansy with his cup. He knew the only reason she hadn’t was because of Pansy. The dark headed woman looked up and between the two as Ginny blushed.
“Good.” She nodded, going back to her paper.
He took a deep breath just as a knock sounded on his door. He wiped at his face before getting up and answering it. His mother stood there in her dressing gown, holding a steaming cup of what smelt like hot chocolate.  He bit his lip as she offered it to him with a soft smile. He took it, looking down at the mug. “Where is Pansy going?” She asked him, looking him over.  He took a small sip of the drink.
Harry chuckled. "I guess not."
“What?!” Ron nearly yelled.
“Me and Ginny have been hanging out with Pansy.” She told her slowly. “Pansy?” He asked, raising an eyebrow. “I thought she might be seeing someone, so that makes since now.”
Hermione, Pansy and Ginny all looked at each other. "You don't suppose…" Ginny trailed off. "Well I it did happen, I'll hear about it." Pansy said with a snicker.
"Hermione Granger and Pansy Parkinson."
Harry grinned, pulling out the letter from his pocket, handing it over to the blond. “I told you I would make it right.”
The blond sat down carefully in the open seat next to the window and closed his eyes. Been on the train for all of fifteen minutes and it was already starting. Must be a new record, he joked. Harry grew silent as his attention shifted to Draco, raising an eyebrow in concern. Draco shook his head before curling up in his corner and tried to rest. Maybe some sleep would ease some of the pain in his ribs, also he wouldn't be intruding on their little gang.
"No.. it's just I'm not use to it. Even Pansy, she doesn't." He trailed off. Harry nodded in understanding. "It has no power anymore. Just a bit of ink, just like this is just a scar now." Harry told him, sounding and looking exhausted.
“I’M GOING TO DROWN YOU, YOU LITTLE SHIT!” Draco screamed, shoving Harry underwater again. At this Ron and  Dean hurried over to the side of the pool. They froze next to Chris when Harry resurfaced, laughing hysterically. Draco held him up with his arm around his throat. Harry just let out the most honest and wholesome sounding laughter anyone had heard from him.
“I don’t know.” Harry admitted, shrugging.
“Yeah, you know her, bloody know it all.” He looked away embarrassed. “How is that getting along?” He asked, kneeling down in front of his trunk and digging around in it.
After a bit, Harry joined him. “What is this rubbish?” Draco asked, picking at his eggs. “So this Buffy is a vampire slayer? And she goes to school? And she’s in love with this Angel bloke?” He asked with a frown.
Draco gave her a slight smile as he slowly moved back into his seat. “Is… Potter coming over here?” He asked hesitantly.
That statement shocked her enough to open the door all the way for him. Harry took that as an invitation and walked in only to meet Ginny there.
“What do you mean, what I did?” He asked, confused.
Pansy answered the door, staring at him with a frown and knitted eyebrows. Before she could even open her mouth to say anything, Harry blurted out. “What’s wrong with him?”
“Well.. It’s better than nothing.” She grabbed her drink and walked off towards the redhead. “Don’t fuck it up Granger.” She called over her shoulder.
"A week ago, I think." He ran his fingers over it lovingly.  Ginny smiled at him. "Love it." She dropped his arm before Hermione shook her head. "Can't believe you went through with it."
“Experience.” He said with a frown, one hand holding the blond’s wrist straight while the other gently but firmly held the cloth onto the wound.
“I’m moving in.” She said sternly. Before Draco could object the microwave went off and he switched out the containers.  “But seriously, are you going to eat it?” She asked again, poking the container.
The blond felt a jolt again, the sound of his name passing through the other lips making him feel a bit hot.
It really had boosted his spirits, considering he was not at all confident in his new muggle clothing. They were nothing much more than ripped up rags in his opinion. Why did Muggles even wear this garbage?
Chris laughed. "That boy is gayer than a two-dollar bill."
“Yeah, that’s me. Fine.” He said with a chuckle, but the fake smile didn’t reach his eyes.
"No, but it's alright. I've faced worst." Draco said, his head held up high. Harry looked him over, biting his lip. The plan that he and Pansy had made was rolling around in his head. He was to take any and all spotlight off of Draco, to make it easier for the other. Then he was going to, as Pansy put it, 'own that shit.'
They were soon joined by Ginny, Hermione and a very begrudgingly Ron. "Harry must you smoke those?" Hermione asked with a frown, waving away smoke from in front of her face.
"What are we, in second year again?" He chuckled. She frowned. "Draco's right, you are an arse."
“Pans, are you ready yet?” Draco asked from where he was hanging out of his bedroom window. He took a long drag from the cigarette, flicking ash. He looked at his arm, running his fingertips lightly over his tattoo. It had been almost a month since he had done it. Every night since, he had gone out with Pansy, drinking and dancing. The fresh air was freeing and the anonymity of all the muggle places was like an addiction. It made Draco feel alive for the first time in his life.
Harry moved closer. “Pansy told me what happened.” He called back.
She froze, sitting up straight in a shot. Hermione stared at her, raising an eyebrow. “Pansy?” She asked, a bit worried. “I know what to do.” She said, reaching over and grabbing the first paper she saw, amidst protests from the other.
Harry walked up towards the blond’s house, looking it over from the corner. He swallowed over the lump in his throat before noticing him sitting crotched in the corner of the balcony. He smiled softly, moving up to stand a little bit from the door.
“I sort of promised Granger that we could have Potter’s birthday party here.” She said in a rush, clenching her eyes closed.
She smiled. “Good, I was making sure that you were willing to defend this. There will be a lot of anger pointed at this decision. Are you willing to stand by him and this decision? Against anyone?” She asked him. “Because if you are not, I’m not bringing him back here where his safety is questionable.”
“Can I borrow a few of your novels?” Draco asked, making his plate. Andromeda looked up. “You’ll have to ask Harry, they aren’t mine.”
Pansy stilled, staring at her armoire. “And I won’t be.” She nodded, drumming her fingers on the wood surface before turning around.
Ron looked around the kitchen, taking in the extreme changes as something to do. “You did a great job, with this.”
"No, because of you. I actually wasn't friends with Hermione then." He said with a smile. Draco looked up, raising an eyebrow. "Why me?"
Harry sat there, trying to breathe, hands shaking as Draco hurried over. Once he was in reach, Harry wrapped his arms around him, burying his face into his shirt. He pressed the side of his face against his chest listening to the other's heart beat for a bit, his breathing ragged. He felt the tears rolling down his cheeks before he even realized he was sobbing, holding the blond hostage in his meltdown. Draco looked down at him, terrified before slowly wrapping his arms around Harry. He pushed his fringe off his forehead, wiping at his tears. "Shush..." Harry clung to him as the sobs were retched out of him. He yelled himself hoarse long before his tears dried up.
"Thank you." Harry said appreciatively.
“Ginny? What’s wrong?” He whispered, wrapping his arm tighter around the blond. “Do you know where Draco is? He just ran off and he’s not at his house nor is he at Andy’s.”
“Some things are best left to others that are more suited for the job.” She gave him a knowing smile before going to check on Teddy.  He stood there in the kitchen, holding the journal like an anchor. He couldn’t make heads or tails of his feelings at the moment and just wanted the painfulness to go away. He wanted to be free of everything. He wanted to be drunk. To be numb. He wanted to have never read this journal. To never find out what felt like the most hushed secret there was.
"No, but isn't that them right there?" Ron said, pointing to the two walking into the Great Hall. Harry and Draco were dressed in their house robes but Harry was wearing a slytherin scarf around his neck.
“What the fuck are you doing?” He frowned, trying to worm out of Harry’s grip. Harry just smirked, placing another piercing back in.
“Pretty much the same.” She said, turning around and leaning against the counter to face him. “I’ve been worried about you, to be honest. It’s hard to deal.. when you lose everything but we must go on.” She said, her eyes pointedly going to Harry’s hands. He pulled the sleeves of his flannel down with his thumbs. Her eyes moved back up to his face. “We must go on for him.” She motioned to Teddy. “If nothing else.”
The sorting went as the sorting always went and was soon over with each house having a few new members. Professor McGonagall stood up and moved to the center of the platform. The stance reminded Harry of Dumbledore and he felt a ping of heartache.
“I think it’s a great idea.” Pansy piped up from behind Harry, making him jump.
“What more can I do to put a stop to this mind numbing noise you are making?” He sang, nuzzling the child. “I don’t know what else I can do to try to hush you. My heart says ‘I love you’ but my brain is thinking ‘fuck you.’  And hoping a child trafficker will abduct you at least then I’ll get a few hours in bed.” He sang almost pleading as Teddy wailed.
“They can’t just not let you go. It’s not right. It’s insane.” He called to him. “What they are doing is not right!” He yelled, seeing the curtain flutter from one of the windows. He took a deep breath. The only thing that they could would be yell at him.
"Tell me next time." He said sternly as he got dressed. Draco nodded.
“Nothing.” He shrugged.
Pansy's narrowed her eyes at Harry. "What did you do?"
“Malfoy? Are you crazy?” He asked before catching himself. “Sorry, right, no arguments, forgot. But it’s Malfoy!” He said, crossing his arms.
“Yeah, I can. I think Ron might have an aneurism when he finds out that his sister isn’t friends with a Slytherin but dating one. “ Harry laughed.
"This is going to be ten times harder for you. For me." He told him, shaking his head. "Why couldn't you get something nice, like flowers?"
“So how am I helping you?” She asked, glancing over at Ginny.
“And get rid of that muggle trash before you go back to civilized society.” Lucius added.
“Watch it Malfoy.” Harry snapped back. “It’s not my fault that you can’t come up with a better excuse than that to see me.”
He perked up at that. “What she say?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco couldn’t keep the chuckle in at how Potter had side stepped him and refused his handshake. Chris walked over to the blond. “I would ask if you were alright but it looked like Harry had you taken care of.” He said, a note of jealousy in his voice.
“I’m not going to Hogwarts without you.” He told him. “I’m not going to let them get away with this.” He promised him.
He bit his lip, turning around looking guiltier than she had ever seen him be. “ Er, Hi, Andromeda, you’re back.” He greeted, feeling his face heat up.
“This is not going to end well.” Pansy hissed from where she was standing outside the café with Hermione. “I’ve already gotten three angry texts.” She said, holding up her mobile. “I can practically see him doing the ‘I’m not talking to you but I have this whole bag of judgmental looks I’m going to try out on you later,’ thing that he does.”
“This is not a democracy!” Draco yelled at her. “I think my father might have a stroke.” He added.
"I did." Draco said, closing the journal and holding it out. "Your godfather right?" He asked. "It's talking about your godfather right?"
Harry chuckled, opening the box only to find a small message on the inside of the box.
“No.. It’s fine.. He would love that someone was reading them.” Harry told him as the blond joined them at the table.
“Yeah, a headache. Probably brought on by stress or exhaustion.” Draco told him, soothing the tension away.
“She can come too.” Harry told him quickly. “I’m pretty sure Ginny would like that.”
“If I tell you something, you can not tell Ron by any means.” She told him.
“Defensive.” She smirked. “At least now I know what to say when you become extra prat-ish.” She laughed, letting go of his arm and skipping off down the pavement. “Draco and Potter sitting in a Tree!” She sang loudly as she went.
When he got home, he couldn’t really stay still. The quiet was unbearable. He checked the time on his mobile. It was late but wasn’t too late. Andromeda wouldn’t mind if he stopped by. He missed Teddy and hadn’t seen him or her in days.
“And then he starts being a complete prat.” Harry told her as he stuffed his face with bread. “What?” He asked. Hermione smiled at him, shaking her head. “I haven’t seen you this lively in a while. Also it feels like we are back in Hogwarts.” She told him.
"Because of the way you acted at Madam Maulkins when we first met at Diagon Alley."
(See the end of the chapter for
Ginny grinned at her, tucking her red locks back behind her ear shyly. Hermione shook her head. “Never mind, I don’t want to know.” She held up her hand.
Draco was a bit suspicious when Pansy came over, relaying an message from his aunt. He had been talking to her through Owl over the last couple of days, ever since she had finally came over to help his mother. He knew about his cousin, but had yet to meet the toddler. Andromeda had shown him pictures and told him stories, making him curious, but yet he hesitated.  He didn’t know why, but he just felt like he didn’t belong. He was the reason why the boy had no parents. It didn’t feel right to come into his life as if nothing had happened.
“When was the last time you called him Moony to his face?” She asked him. “Or,” She paused, “when on a date?” She shrugged. “Kissed him, held his hand, was anything other than remotely distant to him?”

Pansy mocked him before pouring the sauce into the skillet. “There, is the majesty happy?” She asked, knocking him out of the way with her hip. “No, I’m not!” He yelled at him, pushing her out of the way and stirring again.
There is a lot of action in this chapter and a lot of time shifts. The shifts are tiny and all happen within a day and a night, I believe.  It starts from the exact same time as the end of the last chapter, just Pansy's side of the morning. Then it goes on from there.
Harry looked up from the mess. “You were having a panic attack… among other things.” He dropped the sopping rag into the sink.
“Draco!” Pansy called, smiling at him as he walked over. “Finally joining us?” The small group turned and the reactions made him smirk. Seamus spat his beer out in shock as Dean coughed and shifted. Longbottom just looked shocked while Luna pulled her pink glasses up onto of her head and whistled softly.
"Sure." He said, unconvinced. "Fourth year doesn't count."
“That he’s been living in your aunt’s house. Been gutting it.”
“I mean, I can just go and talk to Kingsley. They would have to do it if it’s an order from the Minister.” Harry said with a smile.
Pansy pulled a flustered Draco out of the shop, laughing as she linked arms and started to walk down the street. “You know the point of flirting is not to replace what you can’t have with something that looks like it right?”
She shoved him into a room, following him and locking the door. Harry turned to look around the room, spotting Draco reading on a large frameless bed. He looked up, marking his place before getting up.
"Don't.." Harry repeated. "I can't... even to begin to understand it or explain it but I haven't sleep as well as I did at your house and at Andromeda's..." He confessed.
“Fuck, Potter, stop doing that!” He yelled, turning around. “What are you doing here?!”
I hope everyone liked it! We are only that much closer to hogwarts letters!!
"I would love to, but I'm actually not dressed and I was going to have breakfast with Hermione and Ron."  He told them. At this point it was tradition and it was the first time they had been in separate dormitories.
He had never seen Remus in this light. A sad, confused man who was just trying to be a good father and husband. Trying to make a better world for his child. Just like Harry’s parents had done. It really was history repeating itself. He was the lone survivor with a child left. A child who would never know their parents. Who would never understand just how brave and loving they were. He kicked the box in front of him, spilling out more books but he didn’t care. He pulled himself up and walked out, down the stairs to the main house.

fit looking legs underneath a motorbike. The legs were clad in dirty acid washed denim and a pair of old trainers. He cleared his throat. “Hello?”
“What does it say?” Draco asked, worried.
Harry laughed, smiling at the complete joy on his friends’ faces. He hadn’t seen them this happy in a very long time. “Yeah, mate, we are.”  He said softly, as Hermione giggled.
“Is Father coming out of his room today?” Draco asked, his voice a bit irritated.
Hermione turned to Pansy, raising an eyebrow. “Looks like someone doesn’t it?” The dark haired woman purred with a smirk.
Spending time alone in Andromeda’s cottage was very cleansing for Draco. He felt like there, with no one around, he didn’t have to be on guard all the time. He could just
“Yes, Mrs. Malfoy!” She chirped as Draco rolled his eyes. The bedroom door closed and Pansy turned to look at him.
“I should have known something was up. You are wearing your “shag me” top.” He rolled his eyes.
Ginny raised and eyebrow as Harry looked away sheepishly, scratching at the back of his neck as he shuffled his feet. Oh, she
"Muggles. Hated magic. I was treated as hardly a human being... like a pet you didn't want but had to take care of." Harry whispered. "My room was the cupboard under the stairs until they were threatened. Hell, Ron and his family had to kidnap me right before 2nd year because they shut me in my room and put bars on my window." He gave a hollow chuckle.
The shop keep in the liquor store gave him a weird look when he staggered in and bought his usual supply of rum and bourbon but didn’t say anything as they rung Harry up. He staggered back to his home, locking up behind himself before opening the bottle of rum. He had half the bottle gone by the time he fell into his bed, passing out in nothing but his swim suit and trainers.
Draco ignored him as he opened the soup, taking the spoon out of the bag and starting to eat it out of the container. Harry turned around, watching him for a bit. “Dammit Malfoy.” He growled.
“He better be.” Ginny growled, glaring at him.
Harry was at his side in an instant. "What happened?" He asked as Draco threw his shirt to the side. "It's nothing." He told him as Harry took in the darkening bruise on his ribs and stomach.
As always, check out the spotify playlist, I've added a few new songs.
“Stupid Potter.” He shook his head. “I just tired of being here with them…” He said, talking about his parents. “At least when I went to Hogwarts I had a break..” He whispered. He sat there for a moment before flinging himself backwards onto the bed, letting out a frustrated sigh. “How did my life get so fucked?” He asked her.
“Stop whatever you are doing. I don’t want it.” He hissed, glaring at him.
Draco was standing there, looking completely uncomfortable. Harry looked at him confused for a bit before opening the door all the way. “Malfoy? What are you doing here?”
