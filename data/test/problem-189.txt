“I have a good time with you,” Davies continued when it was clear that Harry was not going to say anything. “But I don’t think I’m ready to make that kind of commitment.”
“At best, they fall in love and then we can take credit for it and we’ll get their approval and we can move on from these godforsaken jobs with their highest recommendation,” Draco tapped his fingers on Harry’s desk. “At worst, they’re distracted for a little while and I can at least take a nap or go on a date with my boyfriend. Please.”
If you take Harry’s acceptance of Dumbledore being a fool at seventeen and learning the error of his ways, Regulus’s attempt to take down Voldemort but keep it secret because he was trying to protect his family, and the transformation that Kreacher underwent when he was finally shown love, you can start to see Draco’s redemption arc. Going back to the sixth book when Narcissa declares that Draco is too young to understand, Draco going along with trying to murder Dumbledore not because he wants to do it but because it would protect his family, and the mercy that he’s shown in that moment by Dumbledore...Draco is well on his way to being redeemed. It’s just going to take Harry Potter putting the pieces together for it to happen.
“GryffinDORK, you mean,” Draco said, the only thing giving away his anger was the way his eyes briefly flamed. “Besides, I’m not overly concerned about what my father would think considering he died in Azkaban several months ago.”
“Just a letter I was drafting,” Roger said hurriedly and went to snatch it back. But Harry was too quick for him and had already begun to read what was written. A lot had been scratched out with edits in the margins, and even though it appeared to be the first of many pages Harry was able to get the gist.
“I mean, honestly, is it that odd to enjoy the classics? The Weird Sisters, really? I mean, surely you’re into that sort of plebian nonsense, but I’d bet Granger doesn’t listen to that drivel.” Percy said.  It was clear to Harry that Percy was even more upset than the glares and shut doors implied because he so rarely acknowledged Harry’s existence beyond piling work up for him to take care of.
The second story of redemption is Regulus Black.  I brought him up earlier as an example of why Draco would be too afraid to stand up to his family, since he didn’t know the truth of Regulus’s death and would have come to the same conclusion (that he tried to back out and Voldemort killed him as a result) as Remus and Sirius.  But Regulus did much more than that. He saw the evil that Voldemort was doing and wanted to end it. Sure, he went along with it for a while, but when it affected him personally (with Kreacher), he decided he needed to try to stop Voldemort. He was a 17 or 18-year-old who was in too deep with the Dark Arts, but changed his mind and wanted to stop Voldemort as best as he could. His story is incredibly similar to Draco’s: wealthy Slytherin home, certain expectations about supporting Voldemort, doesn’t comprehend the severity of Voldemort’s actions until he witnesses it firsthand with his family. Once again, Hermione comes in with a nugget of insight when she says
“Yeah, Hermione is constantly on me about my ‘savior complex’, I suppose she might have a point though,” Harry shrugged and brushed the torn napkin bits to the side of the table.
“Oh, Harry. Stop.” Hermione burst into tears which caused Harry to nearly have a heart attack.  It was not made any better by Hermione rushing at him with a hug.  Harry awkwardly patted her significantly less bushy than normal hair.
“I’m happy for you.” Harry gave him a small smile and patted him on his shoulder. He excused himself to go talk to Ginny and Pansy who had already taken their seats at the table.
“Fair point, but you’re our best bet, so go on in there.” Ginny practically shoved Harry through the door.  Harry barely managed to find his footing before he was faced with an incredibly beautiful but incredibly nervous Hermione.
“You will,” Ginny said. “But for now, we’ll just dance as two friends who used to date. Shouldn’t be awkward at all.” Ginny smirked as Harry pulled her a little closer.
“Oh, that,” Oliver brushed it off. “That’s nothing. He told me about that. He’s been meeting with Cormac for a work related project. Maybe it’s above your pay grade. Thanks for looking out for me, Harry, but I’m good.”
“Ah, well in a shocking turn of events Potter, we seem to be in the same boat as far as bosses go” Draco drawled, inspecting his fingernails in an attempt to seem completely unaffected by an encounter with his school rival. “Where exactly were you getting food from?”
“Well maybe it doesn’t need to be a full fledged date.  Oliver feels like an idiot for picking something Percy hated and Percy wants to be recognized for having taste. I suppose I could sacrifice one of the vintage reds from the Malfoy cellars for the cause. Pinot Noir or Cabernet?”
“Oh, no,” Draco said, continuing to walk down the sidewalk toward the Ministry of Magic entrance. “I believe that is
Even though Harry had been placed on desk duty nearly a year ago, he still fought the urge to roll his eyes as soon as he stepped into Percy’s office. Behind Percy’s desk were awards from his time working in the Department of International Magical Cooperation, a framed letter from the Minister of Magic thanking him for his service (on which, Harry noticed gleefully, Weasley was spelled incorrectly), certificates for each O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. exam he passed, and his Head Boy and Prefect badges.
“Mr. Potter, while I’m glad that you’ve made yourself at home, the feast is moments away from starting and you’ll miss the sorting if you don’t come to the Great Hall right this second.”  The patronus’s tail swished twice before vanishing. Harry stood up as quickly as he could, and started making his way to the start-of-term feast.
“Interested,” Oliver repeated absentmindedly. But Draco had worked for Oliver long enough to recognize the wheels turning in his head. He slipped out of the office as Wood distractedly tapped his quill on the desk.
“And finally, you may notice a new, but recognizable, face at our staff table.” McGonagall motioned towards Harry. “This is Harry Potter. He worked as an auror for many years after he defeated You-Know-Who, and has graciously returned to Hogwarts to share what he’s learned with all of you as the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. May we all have a successful year, and enjoy the feast!”
There’s enough hope for him that when Harry is trying to escape from the fiendfyre that Crabbe unleashed he circles back despite Ron’s protests in order to save Draco:
“That’s only a contributing factor.” He waited for Harry to swallow the potion. “Unfortunately, your behavior was deemed as reckless, you endangered yourself, your coworkers, and countless others, and you disobeyed a direct order from a superior.”
“You know Malfoy, you could consider not being a condescending arsehole?” Harry yelled, his anger nearly sparking at the ends of his fingertips.
to set a good example for the students.  And I’d appreciate it if the next time I’m giving a speech, you keep your bickering to a minimum.”
Harry limped over to his bed and collapsed into it.  He knew he was expected at the feast in a few hours, where he’d have to plaster a fake smile on his face and pretend to be normal for the students. He’d briefly considered pulling a Mad-Eye and being cranky and mysterious… Then he remembered that that had really been Barty Crouch Jr. and determined that might not be the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor he’d want to emulate.  Especially given all that he now had in common with another of his DADA professors.
“I guess it’s a good thing you have me, eh?” Draco retorted. “While you’re doing that, I’ll drop hints that the Weasel is interested in Oliver, and set up a meeting with a to-be-determined colleague for next week. The plan will be for Wood to meet with this colleague at the Leaky Cauldron and then proceed to have a business dinner at La Sirene.   You will also schedule a work meeting for Weaslebee that will take place at the Leaky Cauldron at the same time. Since the colleague won’t show up, they can bond over the incompetence of others and hopefully, Wood will ask Percy to dinner so the reservation won’t go to waste. That should impress Weasley enough for him to accept.”
“Gin, you know it’s more than just Percy turning out to be just as bad, if not worse, than anticipated. I had started to actually
“Of course I hated you,” Draco replied. “But I also liked you. A lot. I was so concerned about blood status and how my family saw me that I was terrified by how I felt about you, so I may have overcompensated a bit.”
“Alright, Mr. I Vanquished Voldemort, are you really letting my prissy, status seeking, absolute twat of a brother get you this upset?” Ginny put her hands on her hips, reminding Harry of a much scarier Molly Weasley.
“I see what you meant, Pans, he really is like a walking advertisement for draught of living death.” Ginny was sucking on what appeared to be an acid pop.  Pansy came into the room, clearly having just buttoned her blouse.
Harry, realizing Malfoy wasn’t going to join him, and still drunk from dinner and the drinking that followed, stopped mid-flail.
Early on in the book, Draco is proud and pleased with his new role as a Death Eater. He hints at how important he is when he’s on the Hogwarts Express.  He’s confident and unconcerned about the consequences of his potential failures. His mother cries to Snape,
“Right, reporting to Oliver Wood in regard to magical sports is incredibly important work.” Harry replied, sarcastically.  “Must really make ole Lucius proud, to work in such a prestigious department, and for a Gryffindor no less.” Harry smirked while staring Draco down.
“You’re probably right.  Gotta save some of my jokes for the reception anyway.” George winked as he went to grab his suit jacket off the hanger next to them.  Just then, a somewhat distressed Ginny popped her head in.
Draco bent down, picked up the wand, tossed it to Harry and quickly scrambled down the hill back to the relative safety of the path.
“Clearly I was, Malfoy.  That’s how I recognized how badly it was going. It’s not as if all of us were trained to pick up on subtleties to exploit later.” Harry said.
“I have to ask,” Harry began again. “What are you doing here this late? I really thought I was the last to leave the Ministry every night.”
“What about you, Malfoy?” Harry changed the subject. “Why are you working for Oliver? Surely you have enough of an inheritance to never have to work.”
“Fine, whatever. But we better leave now so we’re not late. And Potter, do try to keep any rude or sarcastic comments to a minimum around my boyfriend today. I don’t want to have to deal with your critiques, I just want to have a good time playing Quidditch.” Draco added in a whisper as the trio apparated to the Quidditch pitch.
“Well, that’s incredibly offensive,” Draco sneered. “You testified at my hearing years ago, surely you believed what you said. Or is the great Harry Potter harboring some prejudices and unable to accept that people can change?”
In this same Potions class, Malfoy makes it known that he knows a lot about the Sirius Black situation. I’m not sure how much of the story he actually knows, but he knows enough about it to know that Harry should be bothered. All Draco should know is what the general public knows: that Sirius Black was arrested for murder and escaped prison. But he knows more than that. Surely, the story of his first cousin once removed is not something that is widely discussed in the Malfoy household. There’s no reason to discuss someone who has been burned off the Black family tapestry and if they really did believe that Sirius was the one who betrayed the Potters they wouldn’t want to talk about it since it was the day that Lord Voldemort was defeated. Which means that Draco Malfoy went out of his way to know a lot about Sirius Black because he cared about knowing anything and everything that had to do with his crush, Harry Potter.
“All of those Hogwarts students just look...so small?” Harry slurred to the bartender at the Hog’s Head. “And they’re so...annoying.”
“Or I’ll… I’ll…” Harry stammered, anger and annoyance intermingling too closely for him to finish his threat with words, so he just pressed his arm into Draco to finish his point. Draco’s eyes dropped, but not to where Harry’s arm was now digging in. No, if Harry were being honest, it looked like his eyes dropped to Harry’s mouth. Harry couldn’t be certain though, because as quickly as Draco’s gaze had dropped Harry felt a wand pressed into his abdomen.
For Harry, this book is about him learning to understand feelings. He suddenly is feeling not only his own emotions but Voldemort’s and he’s finally starting to get it. When he’s in his first detention with Umbridge, he feels Voldemort’s happiness and doesn’t even recognize it. But later in the book he’s able to translate Voldemort’s feelings and that’s a sign that eventually he’ll be able to translate his own.
“I suppose you’re right, Gin.” Harry said, resigning himself to the fact she would let him sulk no longer.
Oliver Wood threw his cloak over his shoulder as he entered The Leaky Cauldron. The bar wasn’t exactly big and he immediately saw Percy was seated at a stool alone.  What Draco had said to him the other day rolled around in his mind.  Maybe it wouldn’t be the worst idea to sit somewhat close to Percy while he waited for his peer to join. He could try to be civil.
“‘We have a few more minutes before the portkey will be ready!” Oliver said, knocking on Percy’s office door and letting himself in.
“That’s almost exactly what your ex-Weasley told me,” Draco said, leaning against the bar. “But he’s nice to look at. What about you?”
Harry has been, up until this point, pretty consumed with thoughts of Quidditch. Quidditch was Harry’s life. But now,
With a name like The Burrow, Draco had been sure that the Weasley’s lived under the ground, perhaps like a pack of nifflers. Instead of an intricate collection of tunnels, Draco took in a home that was made up of several haphazardly constructed stories.  It was no Malfoy Manor, but Draco hadn’t expected it to be. What surprised Draco most as he followed Harry into the home, was that despite its shabby appearance The Burrow felt more lived in and loved than his home ever had.
“Well, Malfoy, I think you might just need to try loosening up a bit. No one’s paying us any attention right now anyway.”  Harry gestured around to the group that was spaced sporadically throughout the tent. “Now is as safe of a time as any.” Harry grabbed Draco’s arm to pull him toward himself and began flailing about more earnestly than before.
“Thanks, Headmistress.” Harry responded, eager to be alone again.  While he knew solitary confinement was bad for his ‘emotional healing’ as Hermione put it, it was certainly better for the unbridled anger he always had bubbling under his skin since the incident.  McGonagall seemed to accept Harry was not in the mood for further interaction and nodded at him before turning around and briskly walking away.
“Those were excellent seats...” Percy folded up the paper and stuck it in the pocket of his robes. “I have to admit that it does sound like Oliver Wood is at least more competent than Ludo Bagman was.”  This, Harry knew, was as close to a compliment as he could have hoped for from Percy. When they returned to their office, Harry sent off a memo to tell Draco that the seeds had been planted and he was ready for phase two.
"I gave you back your wand, what else do you need from me?!" Draco could feel his anger rising. Why did Harry always bring out this side of him?
(129). It’s not just Harry being obsessed in the immediate moment of action, now he’s dwelling on it. And he will continue to dwell on thoughts of Draco Malfoy. He spends an entire page theorizing about Draco, and Ron and Hermione remain unconvinced and even share skeptical glances at each other.
“Yes, ok. When will dinner get here?” Percy asked, without looking up at Harry. Harry wasn’t sure what irked him more: the fact Percy expected dinner without ever having asked for it, or the fact he was going to have to figure out what Percy wanted without giving away the fact he hadn’t expected Percy to want anything at all.  Harry stared down at his hand where
Unfortunately for Cedric, he happens to also fall for the only seeker that Harry’s willing to acknowledge his feelings for and Harry starts to be jealous of Cedric (although still pointing out all of his strengths):
“What about him?” Draco asked Harry, tilting his head toward a slender man with cropped dark hair and a tattoo running up his right bicep.
“I wanted to talk to you about everything that happened with Oliver and Percy.  And us… I know it seemed like I-” Draco began, but Harry interrupted.
“Er, right. Sure you didn’t… Anyway, I wondered if you might want to grab dinner, or I mean, food, something casual,” Harry stammered out.
“Shit.” Harry said, patting himself down. “I was trying to get some work done before I came upstairs and I must have forgotten my cloak. Go on without me, I’ll just meet you at the house.”
“Insufferable, really,” Ron added.  “Ow, still got that right arm on you!” He yelped as Hermione elbowed him in the ribs.
Meanwhile, Harry’s luck was only slightly better.  He managed to catch Percy when he was in a lift reading the latest article in the Daily Prophet about this year’s World Cup plans, and Oliver Wood’s name happened to appear in a quote in the first paragraph.
“He asked me to marry him, Harry!” Hermione shouted, coming around the corner and flashing a sparkly diamond in his face. Harry, who was in the middle of taking a sip of firewhiskey, began to splutter.
The reader, luckily, doesn’t have to wait for Harry Potter to figure out that Draco is already starting to feel remorseful.  In the very first chapter, we get to see into Malfoy Manor and how Draco is starting to understand that life under Voldemort isn’t as grand as he was raised to believe.
“Anyway,” Harry shoved more food into his mouth. “They put me on desk duty with Percy because he only takes calculated risks and they thought maybe I would learn from that experience.”
Harry managed to get through the ticket line and up to his seats without any issue. He saw a few of his former classmates as he made his way up the stands and exchanged pleasantries with them. An air horn broke through the chatter. Everyone stopped milling around and hurried to take their seats.
Meanwhile, Draco is stirring up trouble. By fourth year, he has figured out that the best way to interact with Harry while also hiding his true feelings is teasing. He also knows that he has to initiate contact because Harry certainly isn’t going to make the first move. At the World Cup, the Golden Trio happens to find Draco Malfoy in the forest. Sure, this could be a coincidence. But maybe Draco was keeping tabs on his favorite boy-who-lived. Then on the train, Draco seeks them out and appears in the doorway, once again inserting himself into Harry’s conversation.
The referee blew her whistle, signaling the start of the game, and released the bludgers, snitch, and quaffle. Ginny made her move, and grabbed the quaffle first. She streaked through the air with her fellow chasers flanking on either side. She scored. Then several minutes later the Harpies scored again.
Tom, the barkeeper, grunted in reply and put a glass of lager in front of Percy. Percy sighed and accepted this alternative. He took a sip of his drink and looked around the room to see if the person he was meeting had arrived without him noticing. He didn’t see his colleague, but he did notice a familiar face walk through the door.
“Oh, I have. For instance, I have learned that first impressions aren’t everything.” Harry leaned in towards Draco.
All quotations in this chapter (unless otherwise noted) come from my copy of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (US hardcover edition, 1999)
“I’m really just hoping it might cause enough brain damage for me to reasonably quit.” Harry responded, lifting his head up and tilting it back against the chair.
Cormac had taken a rather tight grip of Draco’s elbow and was briskly walking him toward the door.  Draco rolled his eyes, as if he wasn’t in a hurry himself to leave Cormac’s stupid flat.
“He’s… fine… but not quite my type?” Harry said, finishing his drink and finally taking the time to stop and actually take in the full scene before him. There were almost exclusively men littered across the dancefloor and booths.  In fact, the few women he saw were entangled with each other.  Suddenly, it dawned on Harry, “Malfoy, is this… is this a gay bar?”
Draco, thoroughly confused why Cormac was entertaining anyone other than him at 8PM on a Friday night, managed to pull his wits together.
The biggest moment for Harry, emotionally, is after he and Cho have their very wet kiss in the Room of Requirement. As expected, Hermione is there to sort things out for Harry:
“This isn’t over, Potter,” he spat. And then he swept from the Great Hall praying to Merlin that he wouldn’t trip on his way out.
Over the next few days, whenever Draco and Harry had time to spare (which was not often), they would send paper memos to each other trying to work out the ideal time to send their bosses to the lift. Harry could always tell if it was a note from Draco because he had a habit of charming them into paper cranes instead of planes.
Mrs. Weasley ushered them to the table as Harry pulled the maroon and gold striped sweater over his button down.
Draco and Harry circled the small dance floor once. It was crowded with people and even though he was wearing his glasses, Harry was having a hard time making out people’s appearances beyond vague shadows and the occasional flash of color.
“Mr. Potter, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen someone carry in quite that much soot via floo travel.”  McGonagall quirked an eyebrow as her eyes traveled up and down Harry’s ashy and disheveled appearance.
His leg healed as well as could be expected, but Harry was dismayed to see that he had developed a limp. Hermione offered to make Harry a wolfsbane potion, but Harry declined. Instead, he barricaded himself in one of Grimmauld Place’s many unused bedrooms once a month. The pain of transformation was a reminder of his failure to save Ginny and he thought it was a fair punishment.
“I’ll have an egg white omelette with spinach, tomatoes, and mushrooms with wheat toast, no butter. And he’ll have a full English, eggs extra runny and sausage well done, please” Draco said, dramatically snapping his menu shut.
And while the obsession bit is unquestionably accurate, the ‘rapidly becoming’ part is less so. This quote happens nearly two-thirds of the way through the book and is a testament to how un-self-aware Harry Potter truly is, because he thinks he is only now becoming obsessed. However, there are 400 pages of book filled with moments that show that he has always been consumed by thoughts of Draco Malfoy.
“He was a major part of the redesign of the Quidditch uniforms to be more aerodynamic and safe, he worked as an ambassador to include more countries in the World Cup which strengthened our diplomatic relationships all around,” Harry continued. “And honestly, just think of the seats that Bagman got your dad for the World Cup when he was in Wood’s position, I bet Oliver can get seats like that whenever he wants.”
“But if someone were here and that someone was acting like a miserable mess… I think I would recommend that they think about
“Harry,” he said calmly. “You must know that there’s no way for you to return to work. We can’t have an Auror who turns into a wild animal during the full moon. Besides, your condition is...it’s unprecedented and there’s so much more that we don’t know. You could be entirely unstable. We’re worried about the safety of the rest of the auror department. The healers are hopeful that in a couple of weeks your condition should be manageable enough for you to return home. But you won’t be returning to a normal life.”
Harry isn’t wrong that Draco sent Dobby, and I’m sure that Draco would be very glad that Harry jumped to the conclusion that he did it out of malice. But I think that he had other motivations. First, if Draco has spent the summer back in Malfoy Manor and outside of the influence of Hogwarts, he’s probably starting to figure out that his world is different from the wizarding world as a whole. For a twelve-year-old, this knowledge is probably overwhelming, and Draco being the coward that he is, figures that the best way to deal with a threat is to remove it completely. He can’t not go to Hogwarts, but Harry Potter is the embodiment of his self-questioning. If he can remove Harry Potter from the equation, then he can continue to ignore the other thoughts he’s having that might lead him to question his upbringing. No Harry Potter means no crush and that means he can go on with life as he always has.
Harry had sent an owl to Davies before shit hit the fan at work inviting him to be his plus one to Weasley Christmas and Ron and Hermione’s engagement party. It had been a bold move, but Harry prided himself on being a man of action.
“Do you always let your employees speak to you like that?” Percy whispered at Oliver. “You should fire him, it’s what I did.”  Draco’s eyes widened slightly when he heard this. So that’s why he hadn’t seen Harry around...it was because he got fired.
Draco Malfoy clearly can’t stop talking about Harry Potter. Their summer holidays are only like two months long, so if Lucius is not exaggerating, Draco brings up Harry Potter more than once a week.
.  The note caught on fire as soon as Harry finished reading it, and he swept the ash into the trash bin next to his desk.
A glint of something white near one of the trees caught Harry’s eye, and he turned to Neville giving him a questioning stare. Neville ignored him and waved toward the tree.
“That’s different, that was Quidditch!” Ron yelled.  “I was convinced everyone was going to make fun of me.”
“You know as well as I do that this is standard procedure, Mr. Potter. We have to do a full investigation any time there are casualties. From what you’ve told me, and from other eye witness accounts, it sounds like Ms. Weasley put up quite a fight out there. But she shouldn’t have been fighting in the first place, much like yourself.”
“That...could have been worse,” Draco leaned back in his chair and propped his legs up on Harry’s desk. Percy and Oliver had both left for the day, but made sure that they left their assistants with reports that needed to be finished that night. With their bosses out of the office, Draco had relocated to the Improper Use of Magic Office to get his work done, as well as to discuss their failures over some beers.
“Technically he has an open invitation to everything,” Harry explained. “But I don’t think Ron will be bothered if he doesn’t go.”
“Yeah, but that was different. It was a holiday and I was an unexpected guest, of course they were going to act like it was okay. But this is a
he finds out, right?” Draco corrected. “Because surely you’re not suggesting to me that after all of this, you’re going to tell Oliver. He would fire me, for sure. And I already confided in you that this was the best and only job I was able to find.”
Draco stuffed the chipped kettle back into his pocket. Portkey travel sucked. And it sucked even worse when it was pouring rain and your boss insisted you expend your efforts keeping
“I understand the need for discretion perfectly.” Draco said, turning toward where Cormac had just re-entered the room.  Cormac briefly fumbled the scrolls and quills he was carrying before placing them on the coffee table in front of Percy.
Draco rolled his eyes before responding, “I have it on good authority that Percy Weasley and Oliver Wood play for the same team, if you catch my drift.”
But this book isn’t all about Draco.  Near the end of the book, when they make the announcement about the mandrakes and everyone starts cheering, Harry makes it a point to look over at Draco Malfoy when he should just be celebrating with his fellow Gryffindors.
Fueled by the adrenaline of a successful fix, and his own proclivity for rash decisions, Harry apparated to Roger’s flat instead of Grimmauld Place.  He knocked on the door and Davies answered.
Before we dive into Draco and Harry specific scenes, I think it’s important to look at the three redemption arcs that will make up the backbone to the redemption arc that Draco should receive in a post-canon world.
“Double?” Draco raised his eyebrow and paused to make Harry sweat it out a bit. “I suppose that’ll work. But I’m taking the side of rashers. And if you don’t get the money back to me by tomorrow night I’m going to start charging interest.” Draco quickly handed the pancakes off to Harry, sticking a rasher in his mouth and headed back to the elevator.
It felt like all of the air had been sucked out of the room.  This was the opposite of what he wanted to happen. His fingers stopped moving and clutched the edge of the table. Why, in Merlin’s name, was his school rival currently limping towards the empty chair at the end of the table. Draco tried to school his features from shock to passivity but it ended up just making his face look like he’d eaten something sour. Of course that was the exact moment Harry looked up and met his eyes. Harry went from limping to nearly stumbling, his dirty trainer squeaking as he tried to catch himself.  Naturally the sound echoed through the room and it took every ounce of self control Draco had to not burst out laughing.
“Well Harry, we do have an opening here for next term… as the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor.  Professor Murphy has accepted a position at Ilvermorny, he missed the States too much to continue here.  But it does leave Hogwarts in an utter predicament.”
“You...I...er…” Harry stammered, noticing the bright red blush that had overtaken Draco’s normally pale complexion.  “I guess..how long have you felt this way?”
“Please come in, Mr. Malfoy.” The house elf said, bowing just enough to not be considered impolite. Draco nodded at the elf and began to walk toward the parlor when he heard not only Cormac, but another very familiar voice.
“You’re aware that there are a lot of tests you have to take to become an auror, right?” Harry swallowed some of his chicken tikka masala. “Most of them are practical and written exams, but there are a few that are more like personality evaluations. I was doing fine. But then the Department decided that I was too hot headed and could be a liability because of  an ‘unprecedented need to save everyone on my own without any consideration of the consequences’. I don’t see what’s wrong with saving everyone.”
“What do you mean, they don’t even like each other? Oliver seems pretty smitten to me.” Draco responded.
"I tried," Harry brushed away some dirt from his pants. "But, I'm having some patronus performance issues."
It starts even before they get to the Hogwarts Express. Harry runs into Malfoy at Madam Malkin’s, in a scene that mirrors their first interaction. After they met in Sorcerer’s Stone, their relationship shifted into the Enemies/Rivals phase, and now at the beginning of this book they meet in a similar fashion, perhaps foreshadowing that a shift into the Friends stage is in their future.
A week later, Harry was sitting in the parlor when the fireplace roared to life and was filled with the green fire of floo travel. Professor McGonagall stepped out, and brushed some soot off of her emerald robes.
“You know it pains me to defend a Weasley, but it is her day too, you know.” Draco said. Somewhat distracted by Harry’s outburst, Draco began adding more milk to his tea than normal.  Harry reached across the table to still Draco’s hand before carrying on with his wedding rant.
“All my ideas are much better than ‘half bad,’ I’ll have you know! And since, I’ve got you upright per Ron and Hermione’s request, I’ll be off. Pansy and I have plans. But let me know if you need a swift arse kicking again. I’m always happy to help.” And with that, Ginny left Grimmauld Place via the floo with as much dramatic flair as she had entered it with.
Harry stood up, and without thinking, he removed his Weasley sweater. The process was a lot less coordinated than Harry would have liked because he was still drunk from the party. He hastily pulled down the corner of his button-down that had started to ride up when he took off his sweater, but not before Draco caught a glimpse. Draco swallowed.
“I didn’t know how to say it without sounding like an absolute prat,” Roger said “So I hoped that by not responding you would understand.” Harry stared at him blankly.
Harry didn’t wait to hear Roger’s reply. He had already shredded the paper that was in his hand and scooped up the rest of the papers. He slammed the door behind him and began the long walk back to Grimmauld Place.  That was not at all how he had planned on this going.
“Ron and I just wanted to thank everyone for joining us tonight, and tomorrow.” Hermione began. There were some polite nods and smiles from around the room.  “Now as you all know, Ron and I did not exactly have the most pleasant of beginnings. I was somewhat, well, a bit of a know it all-”
The following morning, Draco woke up to the sounds of birds chirping, and the smell of breakfast wafting up the stairs. He rolled over to see Cormac still asleep and smiled to himself. He slipped out of bed quietly, and headed downstairs to see what the house elf was cooking
“Cormac needs another chaser for the Quidditch match today, and you’re the only person I can think of on such short notice. Fancy playing a round?”
“It’ll also be good to spend some time together outside of work,” Oliver added. “It’s been awhile, you’ve been very busy.”
“But you’ve already saved the world in the biggest possible way. You didn’t have to be an auror to do that.”
“I suppose you’re right. I let the jitters get the best of me.” Hermione smiled at Harry. “Thanks for talking some sense into me.”
“Especially if you’re planning on being stuck with someone for the foreseeable future.” Harry added.  He smiled and then kissed Draco again.
Ginny smiled in response and disappeared into Pansy’s room. When she emerged a few minutes later she was wearing her Quidditch gear and holding her broomstick. “Harry, you should come too!”
“The Weasley’s house. For the engagement party and Christmas dinner. I had already hinted that I’d be bringing Hogwarts Hottie so there will definitely be plenty of food. It’ll get your mind off what a jerk Cormac is, and I’m sure any one of the Weasleys would be happy to talk shit about him if you wanted.” Harry shrugged, trying to make it look like he didn’t care either way what Draco’s response was.
“That’s only part of it,” Draco busied himself with eating his food, as Harry waited for more of an explanation. Instead of elaborating, Draco swore.
First Seeker: Cedric Diggory. He plays a minor role in Prisoner of Azkaban, and Harry is too distracted by his beloved broomstick being destroyed and the mass murder that he thinks is after him to really figure out that he’s not entirely unattracted to Cedric. Early on in the book, we are reintroduced to the Diggorys, and Cedric is described as
If Chamber of Secrets was the beginning of Draco’s clarity, then Goblet of Fire is the start for Harry.  There were hints about a crush on Cho Chang in Prisoner of Azkaban, but by Goblet of Fire Harry has finally discovered romantic feelings--not that he has any understanding of them whatsoever. And to quote Hermione after the first task when Ron and Harry are forced to deal with emotions they don’t understand:
“Very good. I have a Transfiguration class to teach, so please take a biscuit and I trust you’ll be able to find your way out.”  McGonagall stood and walked towards the door.
"Heed our warning, a ghost from your past will return and bring nothing but tragedy." The centaur bowed and disappeared back into the trees.
Harry was a little embarrassed when he discovered that his eyes had filled with tears and he tried to blink them away before anyone would notice. He was so misty eyed that he actually almost missed the glint of platinum blond in the crowd. The sun was reflecting off Draco’s head and Harry couldn’t believe that a moment like this was when he would recognize Draco had actually showed up to the wedding.
“In the most basic way to human nature, Potter. Sex.” Draco responded. “You are familiar with sex, right?”
Harry sat back down, and leaned over the table to pass Draco the sweater. As he did so, their hands brushed and Harry felt the same sensation from earlier. He wondered if it was just him, or if Draco was feeling it too. Draco put on the sweater and looked up at Harry. Somehow in the exchange they had become incredibly close. Their faces were only inches apart, and Harry was able to see that Draco’s eyes weren’t a solid gray like he had always thought, but actually had flecks of blue in them.
Unfortunately, we both know that by the time that the epilogue rears its ugly head, Harry Potter no longer hates Severus Snape. While not directly connected to Drarry, this does set the precedent for Harry forgiving his first-year grudges and opens up the possibility for Harry to move on from the enemies stage at some point.
He was so caught up in the implosion of Percy and Oliver’s failed date (and the mountains of work that followed), that he hadn’t had time to think about the fact that Davies had never responded. But now that the Holiday Trip was back on, and Harry was back to a more manageable schedule, he realized that it had been several days since he had spoken with Hogwarts Hottie.
“Is that true, Percy? Did you lie to me about the nature of your relationship with Cormac?” Percy gave a slight nod. “I don’t care about the Quidditch tickets, you wouldn’t be the first person to date me for those.” Oliver smiled slightly, but then frowned again. “But you lied to me, and that’s really not okay. I may not be the most successful when it comes to relationships, but I know what I’m worth. I’m going to go to this Quidditch game alone, and I’m going to keep my flat. If you want to move into that house, maybe Cormac will help you afford it.”
“Two shots of Firewhiskey, Tom,” Oliver said as Tom quickly filled the glasses and set them in front of him and Percy.  Percy raised an eyebrow, but before he could comment, Oliver raised his glass in salute, “To Gryffindor and old friends!” Oliver clinked his glass with the one Percy had reluctantly picked up.
“You’re pretty cool and collected for a bloke who’s about to get married.” Harry said, while he adjusted his tie.
The visiting team, the Appleby Arrows, was announced first and they took a lap around the pitch. Next, the names of the Harpies were called out by the same magically enhanced voice.  Harry cheered extra loud when he heard Ginny’s name.  He could have sworn that Ginny spotted him in the stands, but it was hard to know for sure.
“We aren’t lying, though.” Draco reasoned. “What has gotten into you? You didn’t have a problem with setting them up before.”
“Cheers!” Ron yelled boisterously.  Harry clinked his glass with Ginny and Pansy.  He was happy for his best friends, but he couldn’t help feeling wistful about not having that type of bond for himself.
“Oh, Potter, didn’t see you there.” Draco said, swiftly turning on his heel and picking lint off his robes in a bad attempt at nonchalance.
“Draco,” Oliver shook his head like he was talking to a small child. “If this is about Percy and Cormac, Harry already spoke to me about it. And I’ll tell you what I told him, Percy explained everything to me about how it was a work related thing and had nothing to do with our relationship.” Percy tensed slightly. Draco allowed himself a moment of relief when he realized that Harry hadn’t sold him out completely. He only warned Oliver about Percy but didn’t mention their involvement in the fiasco.
“Long day at the office, Draco?” she had asked, as the faint beat of techno music could be heard from Pansy’s bedroom. Draco couldn’t remember the specifics of the conversation, but he remembered complaining about Oliver Wood, lamenting the lack of time he was able to spend with Cormac, and asking if Pansy had a girl over (which she usually did). Pansy was uncharacteristically coy in her response and it dawned on Draco then, and also now, that there had really only been one girl other than Pansy occupying their flat over the last few months.
“Seriously, Harry? Yeah sure, maybe Malfoy isn’t the 100% upstanding citizen you thought he was, but everyone is entitled to lapses in judgement. AND even if what he did was as egregious as you’re making it out to be in your own mind, is that really a good enough reason to lament on your couch for days?” Ginny grabbed his shoulder and forced him to turn back toward her. “Come on, Harry Potter, where is that Gryffindor bravery?”
Hermione shuffled over and gently put Harry’s glasses on his face. The room came into focus. The room was brightly illuminated and made his eyes water. There was a distinct sterile smell, as though everything had recently been scrubbed with a particularly potent cleaning potion.
Draco, without hesitating, grabbed Harry’s wrist and they spun out of sight.  Only Ginny had been close enough to see the exchange, and she smiled to herself as she explained to her mother a few minutes later that Harry was sorry that he had rushed off so quickly, but that he had a lovely time.
“Oh, there’s no way that we’ll lose today!” Cormac declared. “Especially with Weasley AND Potter on the team. You were a questionable Captain but a fantastic Seeker.”
“Percy, probably,” Oliver grumbled and narrowed his eyes. “He works here in the ministry, but I’m not sure I would have pegged him for a gambling man.”
“That’s not the only bad news,” Hermione said. She gingerly pulled the sheet back from Harry’s leg so that he could see it clearly. A sizable chunk was missing just above his knee, and there were deep claw marks around it as if something had dragged him down by his leg.
Once again, Draco Malfoy goes out of his way to find Harry’s compartment on the Hogwarts Express. He waits for Harry to get off the train just to make fun of Harry for fainting on the train. It was information he heard secondhand, but he had to bring it to Harry because he desperately wanted some interaction. Later, Draco does some idiot teenage boy stuff to show off, and ends up getting attacked by Buckbeak. After he’s released from the hospital wing and goes to Potions class this scene occurs:
“I did… but now I’m curious as to why we’re taking out the best bottle of liquor this old dodgy place has to offer?” Harry asked, genuinely confused why Ron had chosen the bottle they’d been saving for ‘truly good news.’
He rushed around his desk and tried to finish at least one assignment before he left to meet Draco at the row house they were looking at for Percy and Oliver. He checked his watch, ten more minutes, Draco was going to be annoyed.  He was just about to head out when a delivery wizard approached him.
“Do you, err, want to go to Ron and Hermione’s wedding with me?” Harry spluttered. “Just as friends, I know you’re with McLaggen and all. But I had fun when we hung out in a not-work setting before, and I got the impression that you did too, so I thought maybe…”
"Just call the damn patronus, or lumos, or something. I don't want to move, otherwise this plant is going to swallow me whole!" Harry was also furious and yelling.
Slightly before 10:15, Harry knocked on Percy’s door and ushered him to the lift for one of his many scheduled meetings. Harry followed Percy into the lift and casually leaned against the buttons to “accidentally” stop it on Draco and Oliver’s floor. The doors opened on the seventh floor and Oliver walked in as Harry slipped out with the excuse of needing to return to his desk to send a last minute memo to the Muggle Liaison Office. Draco quickly sent a message to Stan to make sure that the elevator wouldn’t make any additional stops.
(457). This is an odd thing for Narcissa to admit to a room full of Slytherins. Why would Draco be able to recognize Harry any better than the rest of them? It’s not as though he SHOULD have been spending a lot of time with him at Hogwarts since they were in different classes and houses. Years and years of Draco’s obsession, and attempts to cover up his crush, are coming back to haunt him as he’s forced to stare into Harry’s disfigured face. But then, Draco does something both incredibly brave and incredibly stupid. He lies to Voldemort and all of the Death Eaters and says that he doesn’t know that it’s Harry Potter. It’s obvious to the reader that this is a lie because it has been made clear that Draco Malfoy has, up until this point, gone out of his way to see and spend as much time as possible with Harry.
“Mind if I cut in?” Draco Malfoy drawled. Ginny waggled her eyebrows and backed away leaving Harry no choice but to accept. “It is a waltz, after all.”
“In fact, first impressions aren’t anything at all if you’re going to be stuck around someone for the foreseeable future.” Ron continued, having clearly not realized Harry’s internal struggle as he was very preoccupied with his own wedding. “Thanks for teaching me that and for always laughing at me as much as you yell at me. I’m glad that you were finally able to sort out your priorities, and agreed to marry me.
Hermione is talking about Cho and Harry, but she could just as well have been talking about Draco and Harry. They would both feel guilty about their feelings, thinking it’s an insult to either of their families to be involved with the other. They’d certainly be worrying about what everyone else might say if they started dating. And they would both have trouble working out what their feelings are towards each other because they’re each so involved with the opposite sides of the wizarding war so it’s all very mixed up and painful.
Harry had owled McGonagall as soon as Ginny left.  The now headmistress quickly replied that of course Harry was welcome at any time and he could drop by at his leisure so long as he didn’t disturb any lessons. Harry, after showering as Ginny had requested, grabbed his Firebolt 3 and apparated to Hogsmeade.  The walk from the village to the castle gave Harry some time to clear his head. The air was crisp and cool, giving him a sense of clarity he never would’ve gotten cooped up in Grimmauld Place.  When he finally reached the gates, he immediately made a course straight for the Quidditch pitch.  A few laps around the goal posts would do him good.
"I didn't know how," Draco said through gritted teeth. "I gave you your wand back. You could have helped yourself."
Ginny’s voice broke Draco out of his reverie. “I heard you finally realized I’m here for Pansy and not just for laughs?” Ginny chuckled as she leaned against the door frame. Draco covered his head with his quilt.
“You’ve always had quite the skill with imparting knowledge on others, at least when it comes to defensive magic.  I’d rather think going through Auror Academy would only make you more qualified.”
And then there’s the Marauder’s Map. Harry literally spends hours in front of the room of requirement trying to get in, he ignores his friend’s birthday because he’s too busy looking at the map, and goes out of his way to stalk Draco:

Harry stared at the letter, scratched his chin, and wrote back to McGonagall thanking her for reaching out to him with this information. He trusted McGonagall, so he told her the truth of his condition, and although he had made it through several full moons at this point, it wasn’t getting easier. He was in a considerable amount of pain for most of the month, and just wasn’t sure if he’d be up to teaching by September. He tied the letter to the owl’s leg and sent it on its way.
Before Draco could respond with his true thoughts on the matter, the waitress appeared at their table.
“I could say the same thing about you,” Ginny scowled. “You were just supposed to be a spectator at a quidditch game today. If you’re allowed to help out then so am I.”
“It might be too late to fix anything tonight.  Percy and Oliver are supposed to be heading to a World Cup qualifying match,” Draco checked his watch. “Very soon. Maybe I’ll just try tomorrow.”
“Of course, Harry, of course,” Hermione cautiously stepped aside, allowing Harry to roughly grab his trunk.  “Please write to us once you're settled.”
"Malfoy!" Harry yelled. "I think whatever this is, is afraid of light but I can't reach my wand. Can you send a patronus?"
“He made himself comfortable at the Hog’s Head last night,” Neville explained. “So we’re here to pick up some ingredients for a hangover potion in addition to everything else.”
“You’re right, as usual.” Harry ruffled Ginny’s hair, “I’ve got some thinking to do and I know that this isn’t the right place for that.”
“Well,” Harry said, finishing his drink. “I don’t usually drink on the job. Besides, that wasn’t the test that I had a problem with anyway. But speaking of drinks, I need another.”
Even Voldemort is suspicious of Draco’s allegiance later on. Lucius is concerned about the well-being of his son. But Voldemort retorts,
had overheard him talking about getting stuck in the lift last week and he spoke very highly of the gentleman that was stuck in there with him. He was very impressed, and dare I say,
“To send the most dull and conservative person alive to a rock concert? You may think I’m slow, Malfoy, but even I could see that spelled trouble”
Harry closed his eyes and tried to think of a happy memory. But every time he did, he pictured Ginny's face and was reminded of the terrible day that turned him into a werewolf and a disgrace. He shook his head to clear it
By the time they make it to the Hogwarts Express, things are heating up. Or at least Draco wishes they would. Draco specifically goes looking for Harry on the train (an action that will eventually become a habit for both parties) and offers Harry his (morally questionable) friendship. With this seemingly innocuous question, Draco’s villain origin story begins, and we’ve entered into the Enemies/Rivals phase of our ship. Draco wants to be friends, Harry declines, and Draco immediately retaliates by making fun of Harry because he’s hurt and that’s how he deals with embarrassment. Mocking Harry Potter becomes his defense mechanism to hide the fact that he was upset by rejection.  This particular moment will fuel Draco’s path through the Enemy/Rival phase.
Ron was beaming at the head of the altar with Harry and George to his left.  Harry wasn’t sure he had ever seen his best friend so unabashedly happy.  Ginny and Luna looked beautiful as they walked down the aisle and took their places on the right side of the altar.  Hermione and her father, memory restored after months of her research on memory charms, began to walk down the aisle as well.
"MALFOY!" Harry screamed as the snare bound his left arm. He couldn't believe he was going to die here and his last words were going to be Malfoy. How embarrassing.
“You remember Ginny Weasley, I’m sure,” Draco said gesturing to the redhead next to him as an introduction. Cormac was beaming.
“The only wedding I’ve attended in the wizarding world was interrupted by Death Eaters,” Harry said pointedly. “I want to be able to experience a true wizarding wedding with Ginny. I want to pull out all the stops, and make this an event that nobody will ever forget..”
“Hogwarts Hottie,” Harry said. “That’s what I’ll call them for now, I’m not ready for you to know who it is, especially if it ends up being nothing.”
“Oi, Malfoy. You’d find it perfectly acceptable to go to a concert for a date, yeah?” Malfoy raised his eyebrows and began to open his mouth to reply when Oliver cut him off, “I mean the Weird Sisters are well-known. They were huge during our Hogwarts days.  Seats in the second row, who could complain?  But no, that pompous, boring piece of-” Oliver was cut off by a memo zooming past him and hitting Draco square in the chest. Oliver sighed, the sudden arrival of the paper plane having knocked the wind out of his rant. “Best take care of that, Malfoy.” He said in a clearly dismissive tone.
A quick side note before we continue. In Goblet of Fire, I promised a third seeker explanation, so here it is. Seeker Three: Ginevra Weasley.  Harry spends more time than usual with Ginny over the summer holidays. Ginny, bolstered by the fact that she has a boyfriend, is able to actually communicate with Harry. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry starts to feel the first hint at liking her:
“Have you finished the report on owl sightings yet?” he asked, crossing his arms impatiently. “These are all of the disputes we received regarding under-age magic. I need you to read through them tonight and debrief me tomorrow morning as soon as I get to the office. Put the report on my desk as soon as you’re done.” And before Harry had a chance to respond, Percy walked into his office and closed the door.
“A touching speech, Mr. Malfoy.” Percy said as he reached for the glowing kettle. But Oliver slapped his hand away.
“What? Only the Golden Boy can interact with muggles? It’s not as if we’re all still in Hogwarts, you know.” Draco said. “And if you must know, I’m trying to find a place that’s still serving food. What are you doing here?”
“Well Cormac, I am curious as to how Draco and you became friends.  A rather odd pairing, I think.” Percy interrupted, clearly missing the anxiety rolling off Cormac in waves and Draco’s nearly
Draco drummed his fingers on the table at the head of the Great Hall. The sorting ceremony and feast had always bored him. There had never been a lot of excitement for him regarding house selection, considering he had known he’d sort Slytherin since he was old enough to comprehend words. And though time had passed since his days in Hogwarts, the association of Slytherin and evil hadn’t gone away nor ceased to upset him.  Honestly, he couldn’t wait for it to be over so he could just get on with his life. Just as he was about to completely zone out, McGonagall’s death stares be damned, someone burst through the doors and caught everyone’s attention.
“When there’s Quidditch scouting reports, broom research, AND a brand new chasing formation to explore?  Yes, yes there is a reason to be a bit impatient about being trapped in a bloody lift in the Ministry!” Oliver exclaimed.  Percy was clearly just as uptight as he had been in Hogwarts.  They’d barely been stopped a full minute and he was already complaining.
“Just because the outcome wasn’t what we had planned, doesn’t mean it was a failure.” Draco replied evenly. He waved his wand to straighten out the papers that had been displaced when his legs returned abruptly to the floor. “At least they interacted with each other. It would have been worse if they hadn’t acknowledged each other’s existence. We can learn from this and work it to our advantage.”
All quotations in this chapter (unless otherwise noted) come from my copy of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (US hardcover edition, 2003)
“Surprisingly enough, I haven’t been called in for some Saturday emergency in the office yet,” Draco said, setting The Prophet down on the table and taking a sip of his tea. “I followed the advice of Ginny Weasley, and if the plan keeps working, I might be able to spend more mornings...or nights...here with you.”
“Careful, if I didn’t know any better, I just might think The Boy Who Lived was uncomfortable with the gay community,” Draco said, staring into Harry’s eyes with an edge of superiority.
July arrived, and with it, Harry’s birthday.  He was surprised to see that, despite his months of solitude, he still had to spend most of his day fielding owls as they delivered cards and cakes and gifts.  He allowed himself a small smile as he read through the letters at the end of the day.
“Err, yes, I’ll let Malfoy know. What do you have planned instead? You don’t have any other appointments for tonight.” Harry asked curiously.
“I guess my ‘miserable mood’,” Draco sighed, replaying the events of the last week. “Probably started when I had a row with Har--, I mean, Potter in the terrace house we were looking at for our bosses.”
“That’s not what I meant,” Neville explained. “I have a couch you can sleep on. I just don’t think you should be alone in the castle in your current state.”
“Oh,” Harry sighed. “Yeah, you’re probably right. Wouldn’t want to run into anybody. Like...Malfoy. So weird that he’s also a professor here.  What does he even teach?”
It took a few days, but the vintage pinot from Oliver (provided by Draco) and a bouquet of roses adorned with small, enchanted broomsticks with a small handwritten note signed by Percy (but purchased by Harry) seemed to do the trick. Harry left the office on time, and felt particularly good about how this was all going.
Harry watched with pride as Ginny continued to lead the way. She was unstoppable. The crowd roared in support.  Harry recalled his sixth year when he and Ginny first got together after a Quidditch match, and began to daydream about using a Harpies victory today as a catalyst for asking her out again and rekindling that relationship.  Harry was distracted by this fantasy, it took him a moment to notice that the sun, which had been shining brightly in a cloudless sky all afternoon, was shrouded in darkness.
“Potter, please do remember we’re under an invisibility cloak,” Draco whispered whilst elbowing Harry in the ribs lightly. Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed Draco’s arm so that they could exit The Leaky Cauldron under the invisibility cloak and then re-enter without it.  It would be far too suspicious for them to suddenly appear at a booth that had been empty for nearly an hour.
On about lap six, he noticed a few students had gathered in the stands.  By lap ten, it was more than a small crowd.  He sighed to himself, he should’ve known better than to openly fly on the pitch wearing his old seeker jersey, especially when school was in session.  Harry figured this was probably his cue to stop his quidditch endeavor and go to talk to McGonagall as he had really intended. He came to an abrupt stop on the ground and walked directly toward the castle, ignoring the gaggle of children whispering and following behind him.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever,” Draco waved him off dismissively. “You and Ginny can both tell me ‘I told you so.’”
Oliver fetched the rusty kettle that he always had Draco set up as a portkey.  Draco seemed a little off this last week...ever since he had told Percy about Harry’s strange outburst regarding Percy and Cormac and the plans for the house.  Oliver briefly considered that maybe getting his assistant (and his assistant’s school rival) involved in his own personal life and house hunting was a step too far. But no, that was what Draco was here for, and he was normally a surprisingly efficient and hard worker. Perhaps when he and Percy got back from this Quidditch match and finished closing on the home, he would have some words with Draco and discuss his current underperformance.
As the gate began to shut, Harry turned around and stuck his arm in to stop it. “This plan is going to work,” Harry asserted with a spark of confidence that surprised Draco.
“I’m not sure there is ever a right time to tell your boss that you’ve been lying to him and manipulating him into a relationship with a callous elitist. So, you can’t put it off until tomorrow.  It feels like this might be a good time to fake some Gryffindor bravado and tell Oliver the truth.”
“I’d rather not have this cretin any closer to me if I can avoid it.” Draco finished, setting his wine glass on the table where it quickly refilled. Neville sighed.
Harry had been moping on the couch at Grimmauld Place all week.  All of Hermione and Ron’s attempts to get him to move, go out, do
“Your boss is Percy?!” Draco guffawed. “Oh that is rich.” He backed away quietly, hoping that Harry wouldn’t notice. Luckily for Draco, he had plenty of muggle money on hand just in case there were muggles to bribe near the Quidditch match earlier.
“Potter, I don’t think this song requires looking like a bowtruckle. I think there should be some rhythm involved.” Draco barely suppressed a laugh. Harry stopped moving and rolled his eyes.
“I realized that the outfit I wanted to wear today was here,” Ginny said and held up a pile of clothes. “And Harry was actually here looking for me. He needed some relationship advice regarding Hogwarts Hottie that wasn’t from Hermione or Ron.”
“You always were one for the dramatics, Draco. Luckily for you, Gin is a genius and can get you out of this hole you’ve dug yourself.” Pansy said, grabbing Ginny’s hand and squeezing.
Harry ran his hands through his hair, which he hadn’t bothered to cut in quite awhile. “Fine,” Harry answered. “I’ll be the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.”
“I can’t pretend to understand the inner workings of your mind, Potter.” Draco crossed his arms angrily. “We need to fix this, and quickly.”
“‘Look, Draco,” Ginny replied. “You need to fix this thing with Oliver and Percy immediately. If you can manage to do that, I’ll help you fix the situation with Harry.”
“It. Contains. Everything. It. Should.” Draco mimicked Harry, poking his own finger into Harry’s shoulder. Then he added, in a much calmer tone, “I may have spent the better part of the last three years working on a variant that didn’t taste like it had been pilfered from the bottom of the lake.”
button from Goblet of Fire. Draco spent way too much time enchanting it since it still works three years later. But there’s no reason that Harry should have kept one. No reason, other than the fact that he liked Draco (though is unwilling to admit it to himself). Harry smashed Sirius’s mirror when he was grieving the loss of Sirius, surely he would have wanted to throw out anything that was a painful reminder of Cedric Diggory’s death, and yet, here it sits in his trunk as a reminder of his archrival, and future boyfriend, Draco Malfoy.
He reached for the final envelope in the pile. It was addressed in dark green ink and had a Hogwarts seal on the back. Odd, Harry thought. He pulled out the letter and read:
“Well, if we’re both stuck waiting at least a little longer, might as well order another round.” Oliver finished his drink and eyed Percy’s half full glass speculatively.  “If you finish that drink in one go, I’ll buy you your next one.”
“What’s going on?” Harry’s voice started to come back. “Where’s Ginny? Why am I trapped in this bed?” He shifted his left leg slightly, but this caused him agonizing pain and he cried out. “SOMEBODY. TELL ME. WHAT. HAPPENED. NOW.”
“Master McLaggen has retired for the night, sir, and is not to be disturbed,” the house elf squeaked. With a bow, she closed the door in Draco’s face. Draco tilted his head back and groaned.
“It appears so,” Ginny said. “That’s the way it was supposed to be all along, you know. Lucky that Charlie happened to be at that Quidditch match. Thank Merlin Draco got there in time to stop Oliver.”
A dementor swooped down toward an unarmed Appleby player and lowered its hood. Harry heard a shriek as the player plummeted from the sky. By the time Harry made it down to the pitch, the Auror department had arrived.
“Hey! Those are mine. I earned them fair and square for cheering up another utter tit I know.” Ginny playfully slapped at Pansy’s hand, getting her a glare from Pansy before she gave in and handed Pansy one.
Oliver Wood, ignoring the fact that Draco was dripping wet, was still animatedly discussing the Quidditch match that they had been watching. Draco followed at Oliver’s heels, his shoes squelching on the sidewalk.
“That’s the problem!” Harry threw his hands up in the air. “Oliver only thinks that he likes Percy because we made him think that! Percy is not the charming guy that we painted him to be. He’s a social climber. He’s only interested in what will get him ahead in his job and he doesn’t care who he hurts along the way.”
“Ginny?” Harry croaked. He watched as Ron and Hermione’s faces fell. Harry’s eyes widened as images floated through his mind of Ginny collapsing at the quidditch game. Surely that was just worried subconscious and not what actually happened. But...what if it did? She’d be fine. She was Ginny Weasley, after all, raised in a household with six brothers, she could hold her own against any foe.
“He’s got you there, George.  Plus, it’s hard to make fun of him when he does it so well himself, eh?” Harry laughed.
“I know just the place.” Draco smirked, as he strode toward the doors of the exit of the Ministry. Harry, having paused in confusion at Draco’s confidence in a restaurant, had to sprint to catch up to him.
“Worse?” Harry said, pushing Draco’s legs off his desk. “How could this possibly have gone worse? They hated each other. That isn’t even close to what we wanted.”
“We need to get Percy and Oliver to go away for several days over the Christmas holidays,” Harry said, as he took his usual seat next to Draco on the edge of the recently renovated magical fountain. The Ministry was quiet because most people had gone home for the evening, but this time Draco and Harry were there late by choice. It was the easiest way for them to plan the next date for their bosses.
“Sure, you deserve to have some input into your wedding, but honestly, shouldn’t the fact that you get to marry her be enough?” Draco knew that if he were ever fortunate enough to find someone to look beyond his past and marry him, he could get married in the Shrieking Shack and would still be overjoyed.
“Ever a man of many words, Potter,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes. “As I said, I assure you the potion is brewed to exact qualifications required,” Draco continued even as Harry seemed to want to interrupt, “and it is absolutely not poisoned. Had I known it was for you however…”
“Yes, well, sometimes you’re wrong, Potter. Sometimes you realize family expectations are based in years of racism and hierarchy…” Draco continued, “But correcting you wasn’t why I bothered to show up at your desk this morning. I have an idea that I think you might like."
evening. The two of you surely deserve each other.” Draco pulled the cloak he hadn’t removed tightly around himself and began to exit the room when Cormac crossed the floor to meet him.
As the pair walked into the Ministry of Magic to finish their reports, Draco had a moment of regret. He really wanted to get a job without the help of his name to prove that he was different from his father, but Oliver Wood certainly tested his patience. He knew he would be stuck writing up the report about Quidditch pitch and supply quality while Oliver Wood reported on the more exciting play-by-plays. But that was the price he paid to be an assistant. What he really wanted was the British Quidditch League position, but the only way he’d’ be able to get it is if he dealt with whatever grunt work Oliver Wood threw at him.
“Well,” Hermione cleared her throat and fidgeted a little bit. “They weren’t really sure what was going to happen. You didn’t get bitten when the full moon was out...but there was a full moon that night. There isn’t really a lot of werewolf research, since it’s not exactly ethical to test out what happens if a werewolf bites someone the day of a full moon. As it turns out, you did...well. You transformed last night. That’s why you’re restrained. They were hoping to keep you from injuring yourself or other people. But you still scratched yourself up pretty bad in isolation.
“Oh, there you are, Harry!” Draco called from the empty living room. He was chatting amicably with the estate agent. “This home is beautiful, so much natural light!”
Throughout the rest of the book, Harry wrestles with his thoughts of Ginny and his fear of Ron’s disapproval as he watches Ginny’s relationship with Dean crumble. But Harry doesn’t act on his feelings right away because he’s so wrapped up in thoughts of Draco.  But then Harry royally screws things up with Draco and gets himself a detention for the last Quidditch game of the season:
“Nothing definite,” Harry said, looking around with his drink in his hand. “I suppose if I’m charming enough tonight, maybe I’ll find somebody here.”
They each placed their order when the waiter came over to check on them, and before they knew it the chicken tikka masala, lamb kabobs, and naan were placed in front of them. Harry dove in greedily, and Draco took a dignified bite.
““I’m just helping out my...good friend...over there,” he pointed at Harry and leaned over the counter to read her name tag. “In fact, Danielle, you could say that I’m coming to his rescue” He winked at Harry, and pulled out the correct amount of muggle cash needed for the order. Danielle, the cashier, shrugged, took the money and handed Draco the food and a receipt.
Hermione let out a small scream when Harry’s body swirled into the fireplace. Harry had hoped to sneak in via floo powder, since nobody ever expected him to arrive that way, but unfortunately his good luck had run out and Hermione had been in the parlor reading at that very moment.
“I wasn’t peeping on you at Madame Malkins, if that’s what you’re worried about.” The trademark Malfoy sneer flitted across his face before he sighed. “But long enough. Far longer than I probably should have safely, given the number of Legilimens crawling around the Manor the last few years before the war ended. I was a bit obsessed with you. I kind of assumed you had figured me out.”
“Honestly, I don’t know.” Harry said, fiddling with his napkin. “Being an auror has been my dream since I was 14. Granted, some of that drive is fueled by a need to prove Umbridge wrong,” Harry laughed a bit to himself before becoming subdued,  “but I still can’t really imagine a scenario when I’m not out saving the day.”
“It’s about Percy.” This caught Oliver’s attention. “I don’t think that you should move in with him.  I think it’s too fast, and I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
This is not something that Draco has ever done, perhaps his brush with death has made him bolder. He then spends the entire class making innuendos (bad ones, because he’s 13) while also having Harry help him with his potion ingredients (
“I’m going to have dinner with Cormac McLaggen, I believe he was a year or two younger than you at Hogwarts.  He’s very well connected at the Ministry, and I think a relationship with him could be very advantageous.”
If you’re still not convinced and require actual, canonical ,support of Drarry I have provided it. Proceed with caution.
“The beat so phat, gonna make me cum,” Pansy shouted as she grabbed Ginny by the waist.  Draco threw a pillow at the couple as they danced their way out of his bedroom. He sighed, and rolled out of bed to get ready for yet another Saturday spent working for Oliver Wood.
Harry looked over to where Draco’s eyes had gone and saw McLaggen sidled up a bit too close to the guy next to him. Harry wasn’t one to judge, but it looked to him like McLaggen was trying to pull a guy more than Harry was. Draco leaned in towards Harry and whispered in his ear,
“I… I think I need to talk to Ginny.” Harry grabbed Draco’s hands from across the table. “But I can’t deny that you’ve been there for me these past few years. And you’ve always been an important part of my life, even when we weren’t exactly friendly with each other. You always motivated me to be a better person. And I have this sneaking suspicion I can’t really get rid of you. You’ll always be a part of my life.”
“I’ll have a Cosmopolitan,” Percy said. He had recently watched some muggle television and was very intrigued by this beverage.
There were two scenes fairly early on in the book where both Hermione and Harry acknowledged that Draco could actually be right. This is a big shift from their previous thoughts of Draco, especially from Prisoner of Azkaban when they are adamant that Draco can only do wrong and Hermione punches him. Hermione agrees with Draco in Care of Magical Creatures when Draco insists that the blast-ended skrewts are terrible and she says
Later, when Harry, Hermione, and Ron are captured and brought to Malfoy Manor it is Draco who is called to identify them. Narcissa says,
This final chapter brought to you by 4 Coors Lights, 1 mint tea, way too much packing for a move, and a roommate leaving for several days.
“Yeah, Charlie and Oliver makes a lot more sense and- wait, Draco stopped Oliver?!” Harry was both shocked and relieved that he didn’t have to bring Draco up in conversation, even though he was curious about how he was doing.
“Just send some home with Hermione and Ron,” Ginny said, taking a handful for herself. “I’m sure he’ll appreciate it.”
“I WAS SEVENTEEN!” Draco exclaimed. “You have no idea what it was like for me back then, and I’m not going to have this conversation with you right now when there are witnesses.” He motioned to the entrance to the kitchen where the estate agent was waiting patiently. He composed himself before turning to her.
Draco groaned as he fumbled with his keys and finally unlocked the door to his flat.  He used to enjoy the reduced workload that came from Oliver being preoccupied with fake bliss and Percy, but now all it did was give him more time to ruminate on how lonely he was.  As if missing Cormac wasn’t frustrating enough, he was also beginning to think Harry might have been right about coming clean to Percy and Oliver. They were set to close on the row-house Draco and Harry had seen in three days and Draco felt like he, maybe, owed it to Oliver to keep him from making such a lasting commitment with someone who was as shady as Percy.
“I don’t have much time, what is it?” Oliver didn’t bother looking up from the stack of Quidditch game notes in front of him.
“Why don’t you pick out a guy,” Draco offered. “And then I’ll go over and talk to him, get the ball rolling, and you can come over and insert yourself into the conversation. That way there’s less pressure on you to make the first move.”
“Maybe it’s not one of the three emotions you’re capable of feeling Potter, but I was embarrassed!” Draco yelled back. “Do you have any idea how much it sucked to find out that the person you thought you were dating would rather date A WEASLEY than you because of the optics? I didn’t want to talk about it, and I didn’t think that it would matter.”
Harry rushed after Draco to catch the lift he was stepping into, but Draco shut the door right as Harry reached him.
“That’s exactly the problem, Mr. Potter.  You rashly assumed that the only way for you to help was to jump into a fight that was being handled by aurors who were on duty.  Did you not even consider that you could have helped by emptying the stadium and guiding people to safety ? Or contacted the department to receive instructions? Your inability to follow instructions directly lead to you becoming a ….well, you know, and the deaths of other people.”
“So you’re firing me because I’m a werewolf?!” Harry bellowed, unable to contain his frustration any longer. Robards flinched, and a healer entered the room to see what the commotion was about, and handed Harry a cup with a potion to help relieve some of the pain from his first shift.
“Potter!” His boss yelled when he saw Harry. “You’re not on duty, you need to get out of here. Leave it to us, we have this under control.”
Harry screamed in agony, and Ginny instinctively turned in his direction.  When she noticed that Harry was down and barely conscious, she changed course and started to run toward him, firing spells as she went.  The last thing that Harry saw before everything faded to black was a spell knocking into Ginny’s side. She crumpled to the ground with his name on her lips.
From their corner of The Leaky Cauldron, Draco and Harry watched as Oliver held the door open for Percy and the pair walked out in the direction of La Sirene. Draco cheered silently while Harry let out a somewhat loud whoop that caused the few other patrons in The Leaky Cauldron to look toward their seemingly empty booth.
(294) because he’s thinking about Draco.  Later in the book he’s almost late to a Quidditch match because he runs into Draco in the hallway and can’t decide if he should follow him or not.
“You know that the goblets refill automatically, right Malfoy?” Harry chuckled. “How much did you drink to have the house elves cut you off?”
Percy felt the lift lurch, groan, and then stop. He wanted to groan along with it, but he knew that would be completely undignified. One must always maintain the facade of calm when faced with adversity.  He would never continue to rise through the ranks of the Ministry if he let small things bother him.  Though, his former classmate in the lift with him was certainly testing this conviction.  Percy took a deep breath and channeled what he thought was an incredibly even voice,
“To Gryffindor, I suppose,” Percy said while tossing his shot back. Oliver winced as he took his but for all Percy’s face gave away, he might as well have been drinking pumpkin juice.
At quarter till, Percy Weasley strode into the Leaky Cauldron looking a bit put out and headed towards the bar. Draco and Harry shuffled closer to each other with pained looks on their faces, and Harry swung his invisibility cloak over both of their heads.
“It’s just, the wedding might be all we really get and agree on, you know?” Harry fiddled with the napkin in his lap.  “Ginny wants to go off and play for the Harpies. She’s not exactly interested in really settling down and starting a family.”
Harry Potter started expressing concern for Draco at the end of Half Blood Prince, and his worry continues throughout Deathly Hallows. He has a vision of Malfoy Manor and wakes up from it with,
Hermione brushed imaginary lint off Harry’s coat for what felt like the thousandth time.  “I’m quite sure you’ve gotten anything that might be lingering there, Hermione.”  Harry barely managed to suppress rolling his eyes.
“Do you trust me?” Harry asked. “Because I’m telling you now, that it’s going to be fine, Draco. Will you just fucking go with me, please?”
Draco and Harry were too busy trading insults with each other and draining their goblets to notice that McGonagall had dismissed the students, and the Great Hall was empty except for them and a few ghosts that were still milling around. They also didn’t notice that McGonagall was now standing in front of them with her arms crossed with a stony expression on her face.
“Draco,” Harry said. “It’s fine. I’m fine. I have a new job lined up that I think I’m going to enjoy much more than working for Percy. As for your job, I don’t know that you needed to go so far as to quit. And I’m….sorry for the things that I said in that row house. I was out of line.”
Lost in their endless bickering, neither Draco nor Harry registered that they were heading in the same direction until Madame Pomfrey opened the door.
(212). Draco could have made the remarks quietly to his classmates, but he wanted to make sure Harry heard, because he needed to make sure that Harry would never get the wrong idea about his feelings. And lucky for Draco, Harry is an absolute idiot. Later, when Harry and Ron are in the Slytherin common room Draco makes fun of Colin Creevey by making fun of Harry and it’s obvious that it’s something that he does regularly.
“Cool,” Cormac said, reaching for a piece of toast. Draco thought he caught a smile flit across Cormac’s face. “The elf will be thrilled, you know she loves cooking for two.”
“Oh,” Harry said, clearly not expecting him to actually ask this. “He decided to try to profit off sleeping with me by writing to Pansy about our...relationship, if you could even call it that.”
“Never you mind that,” Draco waved it off. “Isn’t this your stop?” And he gave Harry a little shove out of the gate.
“But maybe more people would have died if I hadn’t been involved!” Harry argued. He could feel his eyelids getting heavy.
“Your rooms should be to your liking.  However, should you wish to change anything, you need only ask for Tilly and she can accommodate you.  The room is password protected.  The current password is ‘Golden Snitch’ but you can change it to anything you’d like,” McGonagall paused, remembering she was talking to one of Hogwarts’ most notorious troublemakers, “within reason, that is.”
, Oliver thought to himself as he made his way toward the floo and the large glass of firewhiskey that would be waiting for him at his flat.
“You are absolutely insufferable, Weasley! It’s a wonder anyone puts up with your antics at all! If it were up to me, I would-” Oliver’s rant was interrupted by the clanking of the lift grates opening on the ground level of the Ministry.  Percy wasted no time in delicately stepping around Oliver and exiting toward the floo, his robes swishing behind him.  Oliver clenched his fists and talked himself out of following Percy to continue telling him exactly where he thought Percy could shove his thoughts.
“Well maybe,” Harry retorted. “You should have considered the optics when you decided to align yourself with Voldemort.”
Harry slid his now empty glass over and motioned for a refill. The bartender reluctantly filled it, it was The Harry Potter after all, but he kept peering at the door as if he was waiting for someone to come into the now empty bar.  Harry, who had been drinking since early evening, was too busy ranting about his students to the bubbles in his freshly poured glass to notice. However, the sudden bang of the old and tacky door being opened caught Harry’s attention.
This description gives us more of an insight into Draco’s character that isn’t being influenced by Harry’s unwillingness to see anything other than a rich, pureblood, bully.  The version of Draco that Harry has built up in his mind isn’t the whole picture, and Harry will come to realize that as his feelings change by the end of the series.
“Merlin’s beard,” Harry muttered, finally rolling his eyes like he’d wanted to for several hours.  He rubbed his temple and pressed the button for the next available lift.
“Before he was your boss,” Harry continued, “Oliver was my friend. And Percy is only using Oliver until something better comes along. Wood deserves better than to be Percy’s backup plan, and he’ll be furious when he finds out, especially if they spend all this money on a house.”
A week before the full moon, Harry, late as always, was rushing to the infirmary to get his first dose. He rounded the corner as quickly as he could with his bad leg and crashed into something solid.
He loved his mother dearly, but he had made it a point to avoid going to Malfoy Manor to visit.  It wasn’t that he didn’t want to see her, it was just that being in the house that morning had reminded him of a lot of bad memories of his teenage years and of his father. As soon as he had finished his filial duties, he quickly spluttered out a ‘have to get to a Quidditch Match’ and ‘love you’, and left.
And it’s true. I disagree with a lot of Dumbledore’s actions, but I have to admit that he has a knack for understanding other people’s motivations, even if his own are questionable.  As Dumbledore is preparing for his death, he explains all of the ways that Draco is not a killer. He points out that Draco’s first few attempts were
“Oh,” Oliver said as they got in the lift. “All of that excitement really made me hungry. Do you think you can run out and get me something good to eat?”
The waitress efficiently wrote down the order and walked away as Harry gave Draco a piercing glance.
“Honestly, Ron. This is about more than reigniting schoolyard antics. This is a chance for Harry to move on and live life to the fullest.”
“What are you doing in Muggle London?” Harry asked incredulously. He fumbled for his wallet, trying to find another bank card to try.
“Not as much as I would have liked,” Harry sighed. “I drew some unwanted attention when I was out there.”
Second Seeker: Cho Chang. This one is a lot more obvious because he spends half the book mooning over her. But I will be fair to Cho Chang and include a few excerpts of canonical proof that Harry was into her. He starts off by embarrassing himself at the World Cup when he sees her
(198).  Kreacher was absolutely horrible in Order of the Phoenix, but he, like Regulus and like Draco, was a product of the environment that he was brought up in.  Kreacher’s attitude improved so much when Harry took the time to treat him well and show him compassion.
” Harry hissed, and grabbed Draco’s arm. “Can I speak with you for a moment.” He gave a strained smile to the estate agent who was grinning cheerfully.
“Delivery for Percy Weasley.” The wizard said. He had a large bouquet of flowers in one arm and handed Harry a delivery slip to sign with his other. Harry signed his name without much thought, put the flowers on Percy’s desk and sprinted to the lifts. Draco was waiting in the atrium with his winter coat and scarf.
. Narcissa makes it clear that she knows the real reason that Draco was tasked with this impossible challenge--it isn’t to prove his worth or because he’s exceptional like Draco would like to believe, it’s punishment. Lord Voldemort intends for Draco to die, but it’s not until part of the way through the year that I think this actually starts to sink in. Subconsciously, Draco finds the line that he is unwilling to cross for Voldemort, and this is the first step for him to become disillusioned with the Death Eater movement and move towards the redemption arc that he rightfully deserves.
“Cretin?” Harry’s chair squeaked as he scooched it closer to Draco. “You’re even a snob with your insults, Merlin.”
Harry Potter explains that a house elf appeared in his bedroom with the mission of stopping him from going back to Hogwarts. Dobby is worried about Harry Potter’s safety and knows that there’s something sinister in the works, but the Weasleys explain that Dobby is also probably following orders.
“Oh yes, of course, how silly of me,” Draco’s voice dripped with sarcasm. “They’ll just welcome me, a former death eater, with open arms and throw flowers at my feet on the most important day of their lives.”
“Er, sorry, Profess-I mean, Headmistress.  Floo isn’t exactly my preferred method of travel.” He shook his shaggy hair out and put his luggage down.
“So the other day when you were in a meeting I had lunch upstairs,” Draco attempted another conversation in Oliver’s office. He had a two hour break between meetings and a Quidditch match, so Draco thought this would be ideal. “And I overheard some interesting Quidditch talk.”
want to do with your life.  Being an auror was a great wish at 14 when the whole world was in wartime chaos… but we’ve all grown up and changed. Maybe it’s time your career path does too.” Ginny added, with more seriousness than she almost ever had around Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes and vanished into the fireplace. He hoped he’d be able to stop them before they left for the match, otherwise he’d never hear the end of it from Ginny and Pansy.
“Potter, anyone with eyes can see you want a family more than anything.  Are you really going to go through with a wedding if that’s not part of the deal?” Draco asked incredulously.
Draco put his head in his hands and tried to pinpoint the moment when things turned to shit. It dawned on him that his fight with McLaggen, and subsequent breakup, happened nearly a month ago. Even though it was embarrassing and unpleasant, he had only been operating under this fog of gloom for the last week, so he couldn’t honestly attribute this feeling solely to his breakup.
“There’s a hangover potion you can drink,” Neville said. “But we’re going to have to go into the Forbidden Forest to get the ingredients. Think you can handle that? It’s a job that requires more than one person.”
“True, which is why I’m not attempting it and risk making a fool of myself. You, on the other hand…”
“Yes, of course, Quidditch is just life or death, isn’t it?” Percy let slip out. He managed to school his features from outright annoyance, but he couldn’t quite stop his mouth.  Wood was clearly just as obsessed with Quidditch as he had been in school.  While Percy had been reasonably up before sunrise for academic purposes, Wood was up studying his Quidditch playbook.
“Fine, as long as he doesn’t slow us down,” Draco turned on his heel and headed back toward the forest with Neville and Harry close behind.
“You know it goes against everything I stand for to agree with you, Malfoy” Harry said, placing his hands on Draco’s wrist and leaning in. “But, I think this might be a brilliant plan.”
dry… as if that wasn’t a task he could manage himself!  Draco closed his eyes as he wrung out the bottom of his shirt.
Ron looked up and over at Hermione who was brushing away tears. He took a deep breath and explained to Harry that Ginny hadn’t made it.
“Oliver, can I talk to you?” Harry asked the next day at work. He had been skulking around waiting for a chance to catch Oliver when Draco wasn’t present.
“I think he gets it, ‘Mione. You’ve only said it a couple hundred times.” Ron said, placing his arm around Hermione and patting Harry on the back.  “You’re going to be brilliant at Hogwarts.  Plus, you might even get the chance to mess with Filch or Peeves.” Ron winked as Hermione huffed.
“We’re messing with their lives, Malfoy! It was one thing when it was a date here or there so that we could have some time off, but helping them move in together when they don’t even like each other…that’s just not right.”
qualifications and yet… It. Doesn’t. Taste. Like. It.” Harry emphasized each word with a sharp jab to Draco’s chest. Draco, while somewhat matured from their Hogwarts days, was certainly not above rising to Harry’s bait.
Ten minutes later, Harry dropped into a dive and ended the game before the other team was even able to make any attempts at scoring a goal. Harry was feeling better after being in the air, so he figured keeping Cormac from doing anything useful in the game would be a good way to thank Draco for letting him play.
“Well, they were discussing whether or not Wales had a shot at making it into the next round of the Cup,” Draco said calmly. “They were also talking about various bets on matches that they had made, and a name kept cropping up. Peter? Perry? It was one of the Weasleys, there are too many of them to keep track.”
“Err, thanks.” Harry replied and rubbed the back of his neck. “I actually applied for a position at Hogwarts that I’m really excited about. Are you still with Percy? What are you doing here?”
“Oh,” Harry took a sip of his tea trying to hide the redness of his cheeks. “I guess...I guess I never really considered another option. Ginny just seemed like such an obvious choice. It’s certainly what has been expected of her and I for years.”
“I mean, er, yes. Of course I am. There was Ginny, and then that time with Dean before he got back together with Seamus and-”
“To what do we owe this pleasure, Harry?” Ginny looked over at him as he took a seat.  Harry opened and closed his mouth several times trying to figure out how to ask the question that was on his mind.
“Malfoy, I’ve worked up an appetite with all of this dancing.  I need Indian food right now. Want to get out of here?”
McGonagall may have been older than she was when Harry was in school, but she maintained the same clipped walking pace she’d had when he was a student. He struggled to keep up with her, his injured leg protesting the overexertion of the past few minutes.  Finally, after turning down a corridor past the Fat Lady portrait, McGonagall stopped in front of a large expanse of wall that had no portraits or other decoration.
“Well… Wasn’t Ginny’s initial interest in you because you were famous and her brother’s best friend?” Draco questioned, “And besides, just because you defeated a Dark Lord doesn’t mean that there aren’t people out there who like you for you… And maybe you wouldn’t have to look that far to find them.” Draco paused, his pulse racing. Then added quietly, “Maybe they’re in this diner.”
Draco clenched and unclenched his fists, pressed the button to go back up to the Atrium and said, “Whatever you say,
The first mention of Draco Malfoy in Chamber of secrets is in the first chapter, when Harry Potter is desperate for Hogwarts interaction and is even willing to admit that he’d be glad to see Draco just to make sure that he hadn’t imagined his entire first year. Draco’s name pops up again twenty pages later when Harry is rescued from Privet Drive by the Weasleys and taken to The Burrow via Flying Ford.
Second, Ron and Hermione. “It’s not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, he had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later.” (283).  Ron and Hermione are at odds with each other for a lot of this book. In fact, the only time they seem to agree with each other is when Harry is obsessing over Draco and they roll their eyes or tell him to drop it. But, as mentioned previously, this constant bickering resulting in them ending up together is not a shocking turn of events for Harry because it’s the only sort of relationship he’s ever seen. Which means that Draco and Harry’s constant stream of insults and rivalry being the predecessor for an eventual relationship is not completely out of the question.
“‘Mione, you look gorgeous.” Harry was almost awestruck by how good his best friend looked.  It was an even better transformation than the Yule Ball.
was the right sort of man for her.” Draco leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms behind his head.
“Merlin knows I owe you that favor after all the times you’ve talked some sense into me.” Harry smiled back. “Now, I have to go perform my best man duties.  I’ll see you at the altar.” Harry squeezed Hermione’s shoulder as he walked toward the door.
Sure, Harry had his bisexual awakening when he realized that his admiration for Cedric was less about appreciation of his magical prowess and more about finding him incredibly attractive.  But he hadn’t really considered Draco as an option.  Draco was a co-worker who had become his best friend as Ron and Hermione grew closer as husband and wife, because he understood what it was like to have the monumental pressure of high expectations placed on you at all times.  Draco was often there for him when Ginny was out training for the Harpies. And it was Draco that convinced Harry to drop out of the Auror Academy and become the DADA Professor at Hogwarts instead.  Could he really have been oblivious this whole time?
“So how long is long enough to wait it out for them to show?” Oliver said right before taking a big gulp of his lager.  While Percy was being somewhat friendly, alcohol usually made everything a tad bit smoother conversation wise.
The last thing that Oliver heard as he grabbed the kettle and felt the customary, but unpleasant, tug of the portkey was Draco calling out: “Oh, and Oliver! I quit!”
“Oh,” Oliver smiled. “No, I saw the error of my ways and broke things off with Percy. But then, when I was at the World Cup qualifier in Romania, I ran into Charlie.” He gestured to the Weasley standing a few feet behind him, chatting with his siblings. “We just sort of hit it off right away.”
“I believe I mentioned that my father died in Azkaban, yes?” Draco pushed his food around with his fork. “The Ministry took a lot of our fortune as retribution for our crimes. And the Malfoy name does not go nearly as far as it used to. The job with Oliver was the only one that I could get that wasn’t a complete embarrassment. I’ve always fancied going back to Hogwarts to teach Potions but I doubt McGonagall would give me a job.”
“I told you Cormac was a jerk,” Harry said, approaching Draco after the match was over and handing him his broomstick.
“I, err, was thinking about ordering from the Indian place down the street? With the samosas?” Harry figured if he was going to be stuck here for the foreseeable future he might as well get food he’d also like.
The pair has put their differences aside. They might not yet be friends, but they’re no longer enemies/rivals. Their relationship has changed enough in this moment where Draco trusts Harry, and Harry is willing to risk his life to save him, that they open up the possibility that they could be friends (or lovers) in the future. But saving Draco once is not enough for Harry Potter, who definitely gets off on saving people. He saves him again later by stunning a Death Eater that Draco was pleading with, and
“HERE,” Harry said, slamming an assortment of muggle bills and coins down in front of Draco the following night. “You could have at least told me which department you worked for last night. I had to ask Zacharias Smith, and he is the absolute worst.” Draco, much to Harry’s annoyance, had the audacity to look smug.
Step Three: ship Ron and Hermione. Their relationship is set up as an enemies-to-friends-to-lovers romance as well, but they get through the Enemies stage by Halloween (mostly) in the first book. Ron and Hermione’s constant bickering throughout the series (and it resulting in love) is the peer relationship that Harry is exposed to the most during his formative years. Harry has no idea what a healthy relationship looks like--his aunt and uncle are monsters, his parents are dead, and he lived in a cupboard for the first decade of his life. So, to Harry, the natural course of a relationship involves years of bickering and rivalry before some catalyst (like a mountain troll, or a wizarding war) finally forces you to acknowledge your feelings for the other person.
“There are other ways to save the day besides being a glorified wizard cop. Especially if it’s motivated at all by trying to prove that frilly pink toad wrong“
“Are you sure they would want me there? Just in case you forgot,” He raised his sleeve quickly to remind Harry of the Dark Mark branded on his forearm.
“We just recently began talking. Cormac’s uncle is an old friend and he suggested Cormac and I get to know each other better. He thinks we’d make a fine match.” Percy didn’t notice Draco’s brief moment of shock. The one positive of growing up a Malfoy was his ability to quickly school his features into a mask of indifference. “Please understand this is a matter of utmost privacy, of course.” Percy continued.
After the article about Hagrid comes out, Draco is the first to break the news to Harry. He plays it off like he didn’t want to be the one who told him, but honestly why else would Draco be carrying around a folded newspaper in his pocket if it WASN’T to bring it up to Harry and to have an excuse to talk to him.
“Uh, huh. Sure. Okay. So...food?” the waitress asked again. She dramatically flipped the page over in her notepad.
“I don’t give a flying fuck what you think, Potter” Draco spat. “You already took the potion, so if I had messed with it, it’s little late now, huh?” Draco went to turn away but Harry roughly grabbed his arm and spun him around to back him into the wall.
“I guess I’ll just go home then,” Draco muttered to himself. If he wasn’t going to be able to distract himself with Cormac, he’d have to settle for a glass of vintage red. He was in the mood for something dry.
"Madame Pomfrey asked me to deliver this potion as soon as it was finished brewing." Draco motioned to the goblet in his hand. "You're lucky that I didn't spill any of it when you ran into me. It's very important."
Another thing to note in this scene, is that Draco is interested enough to strike up a conversation with Harry. Given Draco’s obvious disdain for anything that isn’t pureblood, it seems reasonable to assume that he wouldn’t just talk to anybody out there (heaven forbid he talk to a muggleborn accidentally), so something about Harry intrigued him enough to take that risk.
“Yes, Potter,” Draco let out an exasperated sigh. “We need to lay the foundation by having them interact in some way. Then we can send them off on a date or something. But we have to make it seem natural, the last thing I need is for Oliver to think I’m setting him up.”
“I appreciate the concern for my ‘new life journey,’ but if the two of you don’t let me get my trunk and leave, none of it will matter because I’ll miss the beginning of term.”  Harry could feel the now familiar rise of anger and frustration threatening to come to the surface.  He knew his friends meant well, but acting as though a position at Hogwarts was going to make up for the fact his girlfriend died because of him was a ridiculous notion.  Not to mention that if word of his condition made it to the Board of Governors, he’d be kicked out and locked back in Grimmauld Place in a heartbeat.
Also established in the introduction, Draco Malfoy is a coward. That wasn’t my focus when I was reading the first few books (and even I have my limits on how often I can re-read these books in one calendar year), so I don’t have the specific page numbers to back up this assertion, so you’ll just have to trust me on it. He surrounds himself with bigger, more intimidating people than him (Crabbe and Goyle). He’s afraid of rejection so he throws his money, power, and family name around in order to ensure that he’s accepted (i.e. buying the Slytherin Quidditch team Nimbus 2001s in Chamber of Secrets). But he also doesn’t want people to know that he’s afraid, so he continually overcompensates by being mean to Harry Potter because he wants people to think that Harry’s casual rejection of him meant nothing. He also can’t tell Harry how he really feels because the only thing that would be worse than Harry Potter rejecting his friendship would be Harry Potter rejecting his love. Anyway, keep in mind that Draco knows that he likes Harry Potter and he is doing his damnedest to make sure Harry doesn’t figure it out.
“The attack wasn’t during the full moon though, so it’s like Bill? I’ll have a few wolfish tendencies and some more scars, nothing I can’t deal with.”
Draco thought. He went to summon a glass and a bottle of wine but overshot it. The glass shattered and he swore. The door to Pansy’s room opened slightly.
“Or what, Potter?” Draco and Harry were inches from each other, Harry’s arm blocking any chance for Draco to escape. Harry felt like the temperature in the hospital wing had risen significantly in the past few minutes, sweat beading on his forehead.
“Oh, shite.” Harry bit his lip. Draco was pleased to see that he at least had the decency to look embarrassed. “I...didn’t know.”
Meanwhile, Draco is having some self-reflection as well.  In Chamber of Secrets, Draco started figuring out some truths about himself. He was able to ignore them for several years and hide behind his pureblood security blanket. But now, in Half Blood Prince, Draco is starting to discover some truths about his family.
Maybe Harry only liked Cho because he thought he should, and the frightening possibilities involve admitting his feelings for...other...seekers.  Harry continues to screw things up with Cho, and Hermione is there after one of his bigger blunders (Madam Puddifoot’s) to explain more feelings to Ron and Harry which leaves them dumbfounded.
Now that the fear of the repercussions of the full moon had passed, and Harry had mostly recovered from his first transformation, the Healers gave Harry’s superior officer, Robards, permission to visit. During these visits, Harry was forced to relive the events of that day in order to debrief the Auror Department. Despite all of the questions Harry dutifully answered, neither his boss nor the healers extended the same courtesy to his inquiries.
Harry nodded and scanned the bar.  Finally he caught eyes with a tall, sandy haired man. “That one,” Harry said, pointing towards the guy.
“Try talking to Harry,” Ginny added, patting what she assumed was Draco’s ankle. “I know you don’t get along, but he knows Oliver and my brother so he could offer some help. It’d probably be good for him, honestly. You know, he spends all his time with Ron and Hermione, which must be dreadfully heterosexual.
“Do we have anything stronger than butterbeer?” Harry asked as he sprawled across their couch and covered his head with a pillow. “I have had the most ridiculous day ever, and I would like to be very smashed.”
Draco led him into an area of Diagon Alley that Harry had never seen before.  He tapped on a wall and muttered something under his breath.  The wall transformed into a small doorway that Draco began to step through, until he realized Harry wasn’t following. He roughly grabbed Harry by the wrist and pulled him into what was clearly a bar. It was loud and dark, and truthfully not the scene Harry would’ve chosen for himself.  But the fact that he hadn’t gotten laid in months and Draco was clearly getting some, even if it was with douchebag McLaggen, had Harry biting his tongue at speaking his thoughts out loud.
Harry Potter accused Draco of faking his injury in an attempt to get Hagrid fired. Harry assumes that the other benefits are making him and Ron do his potions work. But there were benefits Harry never considered. So far, the only times that Draco is able to interact with Harry are when he seeks him out to make fun of him, or on the Quidditch pitch (which as mentioned, I think Draco only joined for Harry). By faking this injury, he’s also able to use it as an excuse to sit next to Harry in Potions, a class in which he is otherwise expected to sit with the Slytherins, and nobody else (especially not Harry Potter) will think it’s for any other reason.
“Well, Potter, as our assistants, you and Mr. Malfoy here, are going to find us the perfect place to live.” Percy explained.
“Did you forget that it was winter, Potter?” Draco rolled his eyes fondly, eyeing Harry’s lack of outerwear.
“We’re both facing a lot of...pressure, at work,” Draco began. “And I think that we could use some time off. Not that Wood or the Work Weasel will let us. But hear me out...what if we were able to distract them?”
It didn't take very long for everything to fall apart. Draco and Harry were both grumpy as they trudged through the forest. Harry, wanting to appear brave and like he knew what he was doing, veered from the path and towards a group of trees that surely had mallowsweet.
Harry probably wouldn’t want to admit it, but Draco was able to tap into a piece of Harry’s identity. He knew Harry well enough to know that he would want to avenge his parents. Harry cares enough about what Draco is saying that he considers, however briefly, to not listen to his two best friends and listen to Malfoy instead.
“No. I meant when.” Harry said definitively. “Oh, by the way, Percy wants to cancel his dinner with Oliver tonight to go on a date with your boyfriend, McLaggen.”
“Haaaaaarry Potter,” Ginny sang as she walked over to him. “Dance with me.” She grabbed his hands and pulled him out on the dance floor.  Harry put his hands on her waist as they swayed to the beat of the music.
“It’s been awhile since you were here for breakfast,” Cormac said groggily when he made his way downstairs a little while later. He sat down at the kitchen table across from Draco and snapped his fingers. The house elf came running over with a steaming mug and a plate of toast.
“Yes. This is the third time we’ve gone over this.” Harry replied. He shifted awkwardly in the bed. The lights of St Mungo’s made him look even paler than he was.
“Oh, Harry!” Molly Weasley’s voice rang out. “I’m so glad you finally made it!” Harry was immediately enveloped in a hug.
“No Professor,” Harry and Draco said in unison, and then they turned to glare at each other, as if it was a personal affront that the other person responded too.
If Draco had his way, he would have continued to avoid Harry Potter for as long as he was employed at the Ministry of Magic. He spent a not insignificant amount of time replaying the events of Christmas Day in his mind and he’d never be able to look Potter in the face after his unceremonious departure.
“Right, sorry Harry. I just want you to be ready for this next step.  It’s an important part of the healing process.”
“Yes, Potter,” Malfoy answered.  He had hoped that by picking the diner, Harry would feel as awkward as he did so they would be on more even ground. “It seemed like a fitting locale, since this is where it all began and now we’ve successfully convinced our bosses that they like each other so much that they’re going to move in together.”
Harry was speechless. He couldn’t decide what felt worse: to be fired by Percy Weasley, of all people, or to know that his dream of becoming an auror was crumbling in front of him.
line earlier, but I think making that the Drarry line is a mistake. Harry and Draco have been obsessed with each other since book one, Harry is just finally figuring it out. I think the more appropriate Drarry line from this book is this one:
“Actually, having a long weekend for Christmas would be beneficial for me as well,” Draco replied. “Cormac has been trying to get me to commit to playing Seeker in his pickup Quidditch League finals on Christmas afternoon.”
“Can’t say that I had thought of a specific place.” Harry finally answered. “Anywhere you want to go?”
The next morning, Draco woke up to loud music blaring.  He truthfully couldn’t believe Pansy had fallen so quickly and deeply in love with muggle music.  Could he have done without the phrase “Sleazy, sick of all your lines so cheesy, sorry daddy but I’m not that easy?” Probably.  Did he have the rock solid balls to ever mention that to Pansy? Probably not.
”  Harry hoped that the delivery of this report would mean he could leave for the day, but he should’ve known better by this point.
“No, I’m not really in the mood for Quidditch right now because of…” Harry trailed off waving his hand dismissively, but Draco knew he was referring to Davies. “Besides, I don’t have a broomstick here.”
“They’ll get over it,” Harry said, putting his arm around Draco’s shoulders amicably. “Ginny and I will both vouch for you. Come on.”
“You’re writing to Pansy to give The Prophet a scoop on what it’s like to sleep with the-boy-who-lived?” Harry was furious. “So you don’t want to be my boyfriend but you’re fine with telling the entire world that you slept with me? Did you only invite me home that night after the bar because you figured you could get a nice paycheck from a gossip column out of it?”
“Yes, just what every man who’s dumped by his school time sweetheart when she realizes she prefers girls to boys dreams of.” Harry replies, not missing a beat despite the topic of conversation.
*** Please be advised major edits have occurred and the previous six chapters were edited/added to which results in a longer one chapter. We plan on there being 5 chapters total***
Harry gulped,audibly, but managed to pull himself together, “No, just, uhm, surprised, I guess.  Figured you’d end up with a nice pureblood witch.”
“Maybe,” Draco said, thankful that Ginny couldn’t see through the quilt and notice the blush he could feel spreading across his face.
“That wasn’t really an answer, Potter. Besides, your failed relationship was in the Prophet ages ago.  One would think the Great Harry Potter would’ve moved on by now… Or does the darling of the wizarding world still hold a flame for his wartime weaselette?”
“Is that everything you remember?” Robards asked sternly.  Harry rubbed his head with his right hand.
Harry wanted to protest, or perhaps even punch Malfoy in the face just because, but he could think of no excuse quickly enough.  Resigned to the fact his schoolyard nemesis now knew his deepest secret, he merely glared.
Hogwarts Hottie?!” Ron asked Harry a little too loudly when he sat down. Harry quickly shook his head. Draco looked away. Mrs. Weasley walked in from the kitchen holding up her wand with dozens of dishes following behind her in the air.
McGonagall looked like she was going to say something else but shook her head before calling out, “Tilly!” A small House Elf wearing what looked to be a cloth placemat appeared. “Can you please make sure Mr. Potter’s belongings end up in his quarters?”
“Obviously. Percy made some comments about any man worth knowing would be aware he has a more ‘refined’ taste… So can we get them both somewhere that meets Percy’s ridiculous standards that also won’t bore the pants off Oliver?”
“Under control?!” Harry exclaimed. “I just watched a man fall off his broomstick after being attacked by a dementor. How is that under control?”
“What can I say, l’ve always been a hopeless romantic for a getting together at a wedding story.” Ginny grinned as she grabbed Pansy by the waist and pulled her out towards Harry and Draco on the dance floor.
“Do you need me to spell it out for you like Granger would, Potter?” Malfoy set his report aside. “We learned that in order for Weasley to be interested, Oliver needs to have a prestigious position at the Ministry. So you just have to talk him up, and make him seem important. Percy is also keeping tabs on Quidditch matches which should be easy enough for us to exploit. Were you even paying attention?”
“Smooth, Potter,” Draco said, waving his wand to clean up the mess. “What’s wrong with him?” He directed towards Neville.
Draco and Harry fumbled for a moment before Harry awkwardly placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders and Draco placed his somewhat sweaty hands on Harry’s waist.
“If only we could coordinate them getting stuck in one of these,” Harry said, tapping the wrought iron frame of the lift. “It would definitely be a conversation starter, but I have no idea how we’d pull it off.”
“People can surprise you,” Draco’s mouth twitched up into a small smile. “At any rate, they were talking about Percy and mentioned that
Harry skirted the edge of the party, staying close enough to the bar for a refill. But he made sure he always had a clear exit in case Draco happened to wander too close. The last time they spoke, Draco had made it clear that he would prefer that Harry never speak to him again. Although Harry was not usually one to shy away from confrontation, he felt like it was easier to just avoid any potentially awkward small talk all together.
“Percy was only dating you because Harry and I planned it. We set everything up from the beginning because we were both exhausted and wanted to be able to have social lives of our own. It wasn’t supposed to be anything serious, and maybe that’s why we were okay with it before but now….Oliver,” Draco turned his head so he was looking directly at Oliver when he spoke. “You’ve been my boss for years, and I’m incredibly grateful that you gave me a chance when nobody else would. And even though you apparently lack the ability to tell when your employees are being overworked, you still deserve to be with somebody who
wants to be with you for you and not for tickets to Quidditch games or co-signing houses that are close to work. Leave Percy. Let him fend for himself with Cormac, they’re both prats. But you deserve better.”
Neville just nodded, ignoring the question, and made sure Harry was gently lowered onto the couch, a feat in itself given Harry’s state of inebriation.
“You really thought this through,” Harry responded once he had a chance to let it sink in. “If only you could apply this same work ethic to your actual job.” Harry waved his finished report in Draco’s face and pointed to Draco’s abandoned report. Harry cleared up the empty bottles and packed up his stuff.
“Well, Ginny’s always been one for a challenge.  And if I’m going to lose out to anyone, probably better for it to be because I have the wrong bits,” Harry laughed. He was long past the point of lamenting his failed relationship with Ron’s sister.
"Has it ever occurred to you to watch where you're going?" Draco said, picking himself up off the ground.
Draco got off on Harry’s floor and rolled his shoulders to release some of the kinks that had developed from being hunched over his desk all day.  Oliver’s foul mood had translated to a work day that rivaled some of his worst pre-set up days.  When Draco rounded the corner to Harry’s desk, he quickly realized Harry’s day hadn’t been much better.  Harry was sitting in his chair with his head down on his desk, lightly banging it against the wood and muttering to himself.
Harry was running late, again. He had underestimated just how long some of his work tasks were going to take that morning and it wasn’t until a paper crane landed on his desk with a very curt where are you? we’re supposed to be at the open house in fifteen minutes that he even realized what time it was.
Oliver and Percy started animatedly discussing Quidditch and barely noticed that another twenty minutes went by.
“Are you… are you suggesting I take the post?” Harry couldn’t believe that a woman he’d spent his school years tormenting with his blatant disregard for rule following would be offering him a job.
“He didn’t tell us much about it,” Ginny answered. “Just that he didn’t want to be an assistant forever and maybe it was time to take a risk and do something he actually wanted to do.”
“It’s so unprofessional to not show up to a meeting on time,” Percy scoffed and took another sip. Oliver smiled into his beer because it seemed as though Percy hadn’t changed that much since Hogwarts.
“There’s nothing wrong with it,” Draco said solemnly. “But sometimes you can’t do everything on your own, trust me I know. If the aurors are supposed to be a team, then you have to let them help you.”
“And also, we’ve been spending so much time together, it seemed like the next logical step on our relationship.”
His leg ached more than usual, his temper flared, and he was dreading his first transformation outside of the walls of Grimmauld Place.
But luck was rarely on Draco’s side, and a few weeks after Christmas, Oliver requested his presence in one of the conference rooms.  This was unusual, only because Draco was the one in charge of scheduling meetings and the calendar was empty.   Draco entered the room, and fought the urge to walk right back out when he saw that Percy and Harry were also in attendance. Harry tried to silently get Draco’s attention, but Draco stubbornly refused to look his way.
Draco picked the letter up and read it quickly. It was from Cormac telling him that one of the chasers had backed out of the tournament, so please, for the love of merlin, find a seventh because he was too busy to find one himself.
Then there’s the whole dragon thing. Malfoy’s obsession becomes apparent when he’s listening in on Harry’s conversation and he risks punishment by sneaking out just to catch Harry Potter with a dragon. Meanwhile, Harry is so distracted by his thoughts of Malfoy that he forgets his invisibility cloak and gets a detention.
“Harry, duck!” he heard a familiar voice cry from behind him. He followed the instructions as a curse flew over his head.
“Uh huh, yes.” Percy continued. “Oh, it looks like Potter just arrived. I’ll let him know to clear my schedule. I look forward to our date.” Percy waved Harry into his office.
“Yes, well, beggars can’t be choosers. Now let’s get us both a drink while we scope out the scene.” Draco said, sauntering up to the bar and ordering two sickly green drinks without consulting Harry. “Drink up, Potter.” Harry took the drink from him and gulped half of it down.

“Well, obviously, she’s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying.  Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can’t work out who she likes best.  Then she’ll be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that’s all very mixed up and painful.” (459)
“Draco, you and I both know we were casually dating at best,” Draco almost interrupted but Cormac blazed on, “and I have a reputation to think of.  Shacking up with a former Death Eater from one of the most disgraced families in the wizarding world? Surely you had to know I wasn’t serious.  Percy comes from a family of war heroes. He’s quite well-off and is a respected member of the Ministry. You understand, right?”
Harry also considers in one of his important, save the world meetings with Dumbledore what would happen if he refused to allow a change in subject and insisted upon discussing Malfoy.
At some point before Harry confronts Draco in a bathroom, he runs into Moaning Myrtle and she describes a boy who is
“Shunpike!” Draco exclaimed. Harry raised an eyebrow, not following Draco’s train of thought. “He works in the Magical Maintenance Department and owes me a favor. If we can get Percy and Oliver into a lift at the same time, then I bet Stan can get it to stop.”
“How are you doing, mate?” Ron asked quietly. We waved his wand in Harry’s direction and Harry felt the bed beneath him shift into a more upright sitting position.
“I’ll have what he’s having,” Oliver said, gesturing to Percy’s beer. He hadn’t pegged Percy as a beer guy, but he supposed the man might not be quite the same as he had been at Hogwarts.  A foaming pint appeared in front of him. He took a large swig and nodded at Percy.   Percy, slightly confused, nodded back. Oliver took this opportunity to speak,
“This house was very lovely. I’m sorry to cut this visit short, but I really must be going. I’ll talk to my boss, and we’ll be in touch.” He turned back to Harry. “If you tell Oliver about this, don’t bother speaking to me ever again.”
“I recommend you learn to control your attitude, Wood.  I have a feeling that the Bulgarians won’t appreciate it next week when you visit for their match against England.” Percy looked away with the ghost of a smirk on his face when he had finished speaking.
“Not that I’m trying to be disagreeable,” Draco replied slowly. “But I don’t exactly think I’d be welcome at a Weasley wedding.”
(71).  You might try to pass this off as just an objective description of Cedric Diggory, but then we hear Harry’s actual thoughts:
Harry slammed his forehead onto his desk next to the large pile of disputes. It would take him at least an hour to read all of them and several more to write up a debriefing that was good enough for Percy’s high expectations. Luckily, he had finished the other report that Percy wanted, and so he pushed back his chair, grabbed his binder and knocked on Percy’s door before entering.
“I’ll see you out, Draco.” Cormac said tersely, then continued to Percy, “It’s only polite to see a guest out.”
After dinner, the firewhiskey kept flowing. The party moved outside to a tent that the Weasleys had enchanted to stay warm. Music was playing, and the crowd was loud and laughing.  Draco very quickly noticed that Harry’s dancing skills had not improved since the Yule Ball.  If anything, they seemed to have gotten worse with age and alcohol.
“Draco,” Neville pointed towards one side of the path. “The mallowsweet you were looking for should be over there. Harry and I will go this way to see if we can find the newts that I need.”
If the analysis for the next few chapters sounds familiar, it’s because Harry Potter still hasn’t figured out his feelings, and Draco Malfoy is still dealing with his by mercilessly making fun of Harry. In my personal head canon, by the second book Draco Malfoy has figured out that he has romantic feelings for Harry. There’s not really definitive proof of that because Harry’s POV does not allow for that sort of realization, so WHEN Draco figures it out is a personal decision by the shipper, but narratively it makes sense that Draco would be more in touch with his feelings than Harry and it would happen earlier on for Draco than for Harry.
At half past two, Harry decided it was time to head out.  He gathered up that morning’s Prophet and skimmed through the first few pages until he got to the sports column.  Oliver Wood, his old Quidditch Captain, was working as the Senior Quidditch Correspondent these days, as well as running a Quidditch Supply Store in Diagon Alley.  Harry could always count on Wood to give a brutally honest forecast of an upcoming Quidditch match.  He imagined that the Quidditch-focused manic energy Wood had when he was at Hogwarts had only increased in the years following.
“You always were the most clear-headed when on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch or trying to keep your wits about you around McGonagall.  Maybe that’s the best place to be.”
Then about 85 pages later, Harry Potter dreams of Draco Malfoy again. Because Draco is always on his mind.
There are two not-Draco centric moments in this book that are key to Drarry.  First, Harry is introduced to Slughorn in this book, an ambitious but generally not-evil Slytherin. This is the first time that Harry meets somebody from Slytherin house that isn’t involved in some way with the Dark Arts. It’s important for Harry to learn that being a Slytherin is not synonymous with being a Voldemort supporter. The Slytherin brand has been corrupted over the years, and now Harry is starting to see that there’s a possibility for Slytherin redemption.  The reader also sees a bit of this with Narcissa Malfoy visiting Snape. Harry doesn’t witness any of this, but the reader is exposed (possibly for the first time) to a Slytherin caring about the fate of someone else as well as admitting that she does not agree with Voldemort’s plan.
“Speak for yourself,” Harry replied. “But nobody is going to be able to see us anyway once we put on my invisibility cloak. And before you question it, I coordinated with Tom the Barman to keep this table reserved while we’re here so we don’t have to worry about anybody sitting here when we’re invisible.”
“Yes, my social life acutely feels that pain,” Harry replied, not quite grasping Draco’s train of thought with this.
“Better work on those seeker reflexes, Potter.” Draco taunted as the doors finished closing and the lift shot off.
Ginny sat down on the foot of Draco’s bed and continued, “Pansy is worried about you. You’re incredibly overworked. But I think I have a solution. My brother is just his type, you should try setting Oliver up. Maybe then you can see Cormac more regularly.”
“I want somebody to like me for me.” Harry sighed. “I want somebody who looks at me and sees someone other than ‘the-boy-who-lived and...the boy-who-lived, again.’”
Harry thought to himself… bright lights meant it was at least 7AM, which meant he was already running late. And to make matters worse, he was twisted in the sheets yet again, with the cusp of a memory calling to his mind. He had the disconcerting thought that Malfoy had made an appearance in his dream last night, which was something that hadn’t plagued him since his Hogwarts years. Maybe he shouldn’t drink so much firewhiskey before bed, he mused to himself, grabbing his robes off his bedside chair and combing his fingers through his hair. Sure, he didn’t exactly look well-groomed, but one of his only joys at work was frustrating Percy with his somewhat disheveled appearance.
“Yes, of course, misery loves its company, I suppose,” Draco sighed, promptly tucking away the strange sensation of grief, regret, and closure he felt at his father’s death. Draco desperately wanted to change the subject. “So, uhm, working for a pseudo family member who’s the brother of your ex must be buckets of fun, huh?”
Finally, the gang ends up on the train.  The second that Ron comes into the train compartment and talks about Draco, Harry sits up straight and is way more engaged in the conversation.  He’s thinking about various theories regarding Draco when he’s interrupted to go to a Slug Club meeting which he uses an excuse to spy on Malfoy some more. First, he thinks about using the cloak to get a look at Malfoy on the way, but then when that doesn’t work, he follows Blaise into the Slytherin compartment. Also of note, this idea (to follow Blaise) interrupted his conversation with Ginny, and at this point the hints for them eventually getting together are in full force.  Giving Draco priority over Ginny is a big deal. Once in the compartment,
Drarry, like all good head-canon ships, requires a little bit of ingenuity on the part of the shipper. Just because Harry and Draco don’t end up together during the seven books does not mean that Drarry isn’t plausible. There are three steps to becoming a Drarry believer. There isn’t a particular order for the steps, but you can’t truly take up residence in the Drarry dumpster unless you follow these rules.
“Ugh, that stuff upsets my stomach,” Percy said. “Just get me pancakes from that 24-hour muggle diner.” And with that, Percy shooed Harry out of his office and shut the door again. Harry trudged back to his desk to call in the order.
“Malfoy!” Harry began, realizing that Draco had started briskly walking away as soon as he saw Harry. “Seriously, wait up!”
“It’s fine, Pans. Just a long day.” Draco replied, swishing his wand and repairing the glass. “I’d hate to interrupt whatever it is you have going on in there… Who do you have in there?”
“Okay, we’re almost back. I think that maybe it would be better if you stayed in my room tonight,” Neville put his arm around Harry to keep him from falling over again.
“Great, so you have captaincy in common,” Draco said, pushing Harry closer to Davies. “I’ll let you two talk about that, I think I see my boyfriend over there.”
“And I’m just supposed to believe that Draco Malfoy, poster boy for blood purity, has been working on improving the taste of a
Draco thought to himself.  He didn’t know a lot about Percy, but he knew enough to know a Weird Sisters concert was so far out of the realm of enjoyment for an uptight dud like Percy.  Now he was going to not only have to work late tonight, but he was also going to have to figure out a way to fix this in time to create the Christmas holiday Harry needed their bosses to take so badly. He pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath.  He would stay calm and he would solve this problem.
“Before we tuck in,” Ginny said, standing and raising her glass. “I’d like to make a toast to my good friend and brother.” The rest of the party raised their glasses as well.

“Oliver wasn’t thrilled about having a Friday night meeting out of the office,” Draco told Harry . They were seated at a table close enough to the bar that they would be able to hear Percy and Oliver’s eventual conversation, although Harry had some extendable ears in his pocket just in case.
“You know, ‘must not tell lies’ and all that rubbish,” Harry shrugged, suddenly feeling awkward. “I, uh, have to admit it’s somewhat nice to see someone suffering at work as much as me,” Harry tried to smile at Draco, though it teetered on being a grimace.
“Looks like she saved the best for last.” Harry whispered, leaning over Neville so that Draco would be able to hear him.
“I don’t care!” Ginny hit a death eater in the chest with a stunning spell. Harry knew he wouldn’t be able to convince Ginny to stay out of a fight. She sprinted deeper into the struggle with fierce determination. Harry moved to follow, but was forced to deal with several more dementors instead. While he was focused on that, he felt something hit him between his shoulder blades and he collapsed to the ground. He felt a sharp pain in his leg, and then a burning sensation radiated through the rest of his body.
“Right, right,” Percy said distractedly, still admiring the flowers on his desk. “While you’re with Mr. Malfoy, can you have him tell Oliver I won’t be available for our dinner this evening, something else has come up.”  This surprised Harry, which is something that Percy rarely ever accomplished.
They were too caught up in each other to notice that Ginny and Pansy were watching intently from the other side of the dance floor. Pansy sighed and placed five galleons in Ginny’s outstretched hand.
"You can ignore that," Neville said encouragingly. "They say things like that a lot, and they only come true about half the time."
The first five books are the foundation of The House of Drarry. We have cleared the construction site with my three steps to success and we have poured the foundation of enemies/rivals. But now, we shall start to see the fruits of our labor by building the framework of the house, which is of course, Half Blood Prince.
“Yeah but this,” Davies said pointing to Harry and then to himself. “This is just shagging. It’s not meet-the-parents (or best friends). It’s not spend holidays with each other. It’s blowing off steam after work. It’s getting laid.”
Harry sent a few stunning curses into the onslaught. With the chaos of the crowd and the dementors it was difficult to tell if he hit any of his targets.
It all starts when Harry and Draco meet for the first time at Madam Malkin’s. Harry is intimidated by Draco, and even though he immediately doesn’t like Draco, there’s still something about Draco that makes Harry want to impress him anyway:
“Yeah, sure whatever,” Draco said to the now closed door. “I’ll just find out who it really is in the morning if they haven’t already snuck out by then.”
Harry and Draco sat down at a table and the same waitress as before brought them a menu. Draco glanced over the top of his menu at Harry.
Ginny thought to herself. To Draco she exclaimed, “But I didn’t mean Percy, you absolute dunderhead! I meant my brother Charlie.”
(174-175).  Then, when Harry finds himself in Malfoy Manor and up close and personal with Draco’s face, he notices that although he looks a lot like his father, Lucius, Malfoy’s expression was full of reluctance. Harry is starting to figure out that Draco Malfoy is not his father and that there’s still hope for him.
“You’re still a very good flyer,” McGonagall pointed to her window.  She had a clear view of the Quidditch pitch. “Did you have a good time?”
“So I’ve been told,” Harry muttered, thinking back to the conversation he’d had with Draco weeks before. “But I haven’t figured out what the other options are.”
“I’m not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it,” Ginny sang, kicking open the door to Draco’s bedroom. “Sup, Malfoy?”
Draco scoffed and gathered his belongings to go back to his own desk so he could finish getting his work done without any more distractions.
"Malfoy made this?" Harry stared at the swirling liquid. Madame Pomfrey, sensing an argument was about to escalate and realizing she was too old for the typical Potter and Malfoy antics, ignored Harry’s question and quickly made her way to her office.
“You dolt, they’re both reds. I should’ve known better than to ask you. You probably had never expanded your palette beyond firewhiskey before I took you out in Diagon Alley. I’ll give him the Pinot. I have more of it at my flat and I prefer Cabernet anyway.”
Mr. Weasley may not always understand muggle things, but he isn’t an idiot. He can see what Harry isn’t able to see yet: Harry is obsessed with Draco, and he doth protest too much.
The trio started making their way back to the edge of the forest when suddenly they heard a voice behind them.
"Oh, you found something all right," Draco muttered as he put some of the plant he had been looking for into a pouch and turned back to see what disaster awaited him.
Sure enough, when Draco reached Harry a minute later, Harry was wrapped up to his waist against a tree in devil's snare and his wand was laying uselessly a foot away.
“Well, I placed an order for take-away at that diner,” Harry pointed distractedly next door to the ATM. “But they only take cash, and I didn’t have enough muggle money on me and I really just don’t want to go back up and face Percy.”
"Oh good," she said. "You're both here. Hurry up and get in here before too many students show up and start asking questions.
“Did you hear something, Pans?” Ginny looked around the living room and pretended not to be able to see Draco.
“Yes, yes, Potter. We’ve all seen The Prophet sexual exploits of one Harry Potter… Though one must admit that for a Gryffindor, Dean is still an impressive catch,” Draco said, waggling his eyebrows to emphasize the point.
Draco was pleased to see, when he looked at his silver watch, that it wasn’t even midnight yet. McLaggen had sent him an annoyed owl earlier telling him that if he wasn’t done with work by 11:30 then he shouldn’t bother coming over. But Draco wasn’t that late, and after his day at work dealing with Oliver and then running into Potter, he really wasn’t in the mood to go back to his apartment right away. It would be much easier to ignore his thoughts if he was in somebody else’s bed.
The rest of the family made their way over to the table and sat down. Everyone chatted loudly as plates and platters of food landed in front of them. Once everyone was seated, Ron and Hermione stood up.
“Harry,” Hermione started before bursting into tears. Ron buried his head in his hands. Harry tried to reach out to comfort them, but discovered that his arms and legs had been magically restrained  to the sides of the bed by what appeared to be thick leather belts.
“Oliver told me what you said, and I can’t have an assistant who is going to undermine me in any way.” Percy crossed his arms. “I’ll be writing to the Auror Department to explain your departure, and to tell them that you do not have my recommendation for auror qualification.”
“I did that as a favor,” Harry grumbled. He turned towards Neville for support and discovered that he had left him alone with Draco during the argument.
After his detention, Harry returns to the common room where we are treated to one of my favorite book scenes that should have been in the movie but wasn’t (I’m only a little bitter):
Harry barely had enough time to catch his breath after delivering Percy’s unnecessarily complicated coffee order before Draco appeared out of nowhere in front of his desk.
“That, Harry, my boy, is what taking a calculated risk is all about! You’ll keep this between the two of us.” Without confirming, Harry grabbed his coat from his desk and grumbled to himself for the entire trek to the open house.
The pair made their way back to the bar to order another round.  This time Harry chose the beverage: a deep red drink with gold smoke billowing from the surface.
Draco casually bumped into Harry’s shoulder as they walked through the door of their favorite diner.  Ever since he’d popped the question to the Girl Weasel, Harry had been yoyo-ing between extreme happiness and extreme despair.  The happiness made sense to Draco, it was like the perfect ending to a fairytale: the Golden Boy ends up with the beloved damsel.  The ultimate Hogwarts sweetheart story come to life. And yet… Draco could see so clearly that Harry wasn’t as happy as the rest of the adoring wizarding public seemed to think. Pansy had given him quite enough shite about his possible “ulterior motives” for seeing cracks in the Chosen One’s happy facade. But Draco was a Slytherin, which meant reading people was one of his greatest assets.  And if there was anything he could plainly see, it was that Harry Potter was not enthused about marrying his best friend’s little sister.
Drarry may not be your ship of choice, and that’s understandable. Not every ship is for everybody. But I do think that Drarry has its merits and that it’s a very plausible ship. Do not pity the dead, my friends. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without Drarry.
“Just take it Potter. Let off some Davies related steam, I’ll just go sit over there,” Draco waved in the direction of the makeshift bleachers and sulked over, as Harry hesitantly accepted the broom.
Harry winced as the morning light shone through his shades on Monday morning.  Was there anything worse than blinding bright light when you were hungover?
Harry decided not to go back to his office right away. He didn’t know if he could face Percy right now, so he wandered around for half an hour before making his way back to his desk. When he got there, he found that his desk had been mostly cleared out and all of his personal effects were in a cardboard box.
Draco walked through the front door of the flat that he and Pansy shared. He immediately noticed two pairs of shoes tucked into the corner by the door to Pansy’s room, and a denim jacket thrown over a chair that he knew he’d never seen Pansy wear.
The waiter subtly cleared his throat as he placed the check on the table, and they were brought back to reality. The spell was broken. Draco’s eyes widened. He hastily fished a note out of his pocket and mumbled a quick thank you to Harry for the sweater before sprinting out the door.
“I will.” Harry grunted while hoisting his other bag over his shoulder and limping toward the floo. Ron made a move to help him lift the trunk, but quickly thought better of it.  Harry hadn’t been exactly receptive toward unrequested help since the accident. Grabbing floo powder, Harry nodded at Ron and Hermione before yelling “Hogwarts!” and letting the green flames whisk him away.
“Err, right, sorry.” Harry said, mentally kicking himself for apologizing to Draco, of all people. “No, we set this muggle account up back when we were still dating for emergencies, and it’s too much of a hassle to change it. Plus, it’s not like either of us uses it that much. Just when I need to get fucking diner food at 9pm for my fucking boss. She must have had a muggle-money related emergency and didn’t replenish the funds.” And then, Harry Potter, kicked the brick wall.
“Sure did,” Pansy nodded. “My girl here talked some sense into him. She didn’t tell him to quit his job though, I’m not sure why he thought that was a good idea.”
“Oliver Wood,” Harry mused. “He was Quidditch Captain when I was there. Incredibly focused and driven, it’s good to see another Gryffindor in a high ranking Ministry position like yourself.”
“It’d be fine! Your past is ancient history at this point, they aren’t going to hold it against you, especially if you’re with me.”
“Neville, Neville, Neville,” Harry garbled. “Were we ever as small as the Hogwarts students are? They’re just so, so small. They’re smaller than we used to be right?”
Draco hurried down the sidewalk toward Cormac’s.  He had barely seen him since Christmas and while he was still a little miffed about being sidelined in favor of Harry, he also wanted to get laid. Draco managed to not scowl while rapping the hideous door-knocker and waited for Cormac or his house elf to answer the door.  He hadn’t owled ahead of time, but he figured Cormac would be as desperate for a lay as he was, so the lack of courtesy would be forgiven. When the door still hadn’t been opened a minute later, Draco began to get truly impatient. He was just about to knock on the door again, when the house elf opened the door.
“Oh right, because Improper Use of Magic is just integral to wizarding society, how dare I forget?” Oliver said, sarcasm evident. He leaned against the edge of the lift, desperately hoping his comment would shut Percy up.  He was quickly proven wrong.
At their apparition lesson, Harry abandons Ron and Hermione in favor of standing directly behind Malfoy. He’s also unable to focus on the hoop he’s supposed to be apparating into because
“I expected...you...to be...in...your office,” Draco huffed between breaths. He inhaled deeply and then composed himself. “I was hoping to catch you before you left, and then you weren’t in your office, so I ran here. Merlin, I’m glad you’re here.”
“It’s silly, honestly. I’m almost embarrassed to say.” Hermione stepped out of Harry’s embrace and blushed. “I just, marriage is quite the step.  And I guess I just got myself in a tizzy over it.”
So far, I’ve discussed Draco’s path and Harry’s path, but there is a third path that is also crucial to Drarry’s formation.  I recommended in the intro that shipping Ron and Hermione was necessary to ship Drarry because they bicker constantly and still end up together and it’s the relationship that he’s closest to growing up. But in Order of the Phoenix, Harry is also exposed to his parents' relationship. He always assumed that they were this perfect, loving couple. But he discovers in Snape’s Worst Memory that Lily Evans couldn’t stand James Potter (at least in their fifth year), and this really shakes Harry. Luckily his godfather and Remus Lupin are there to explain that Lily didn’t hate James, and that once he 'deflated his head' and 'stopped hexing people' she started dating him and fell in love. Another enemies-to-lovers relationship for Harry to base all of his relationship expectations on. Sirius also leaves Harry with this important nugget of information, which I think that later on Harry will really take to heart:
“When,” Draco sighed. “When Percy was at his house discussing the arrangement that Cormac’s uncle had suggested.”
“This has been going on for weeks?” Harry was absolutely livid. “Why, for the love of Merlin, did you NOT TELL ME SOONER?!”
“Because, as Ginny reminds me at every turn, ‘Hermione is much too good for me’. It’d be difficult to make fun of me for marrying someone out of my league.” Ron said with a self-satisfied smirk.
“Listen, Potter,” Draco began. The pair sat down in the red, vinyl booth of the diner as the waitress brought over a kettle and empty teacups for them to fill. “You know I’m happy for you and your upcoming nuptials, but you have been absolutely miserable to teach with since you proposed to Ginevra.”
“It was a werewolf, Harry.” Hermione’s voice hitched slightly. “The wounds are cursed so it’ll take some time for them to heal, and as you know with Bill...they’ll never really heal properly so…”
“I’m actually just leaving,” Harry stuck his head in. “I have an appointment with Draco for a potential house for you and Oliver.”
“Right, of course. You’re very used to the Gryffindor approach of rushing in and asking questions later.  Luckily for us both, this is a situation that needs a lighter hand which I just so happen to have.” Draco handed Potter another beer and continued, “I think you were on the right path with getting them stuck in the lift. But perhaps, they would benefit from a different set of circumstances.”
“What do you think I’m possibly going to do in the forest, Potter? Sacrifice a unicorn to bring You-Know-Who back? Perform an elaborate ritual to break Death Eaters out of jail?
Molly Weasley, of course, insisted that they all stay for dinner afterwards.  Harry noticed that Percy hadn’t made an appearance yet, so he was surprised when he felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around to see Oliver standing there.
“Let me spell it out for you,” Draco said, pulling out a notebook. “We are essentially in charge of Percy and Oliver’s lives” Draco paused because Harry looked like he was going to interrupt, but Draco stopped him. “Don’t deny it, I know you have a calendar for Percy just like I have a calendar for Oliver. We can just...make them ‘accidentally’ meet up at the same time.”
This chapter brought to you by an embarrassing amount of sobriety, the Celtics winning game 3, and the phrase "f*ck it, it's 2020!"
“She’s in a full blown anxiety attack. Luna and I did our best to calm her down, but well, Luna isn’t exactly a wealth of comforting words at a time like this. And I’m not known for my bedside manner. I’m much too blunt for this type of thing.”

“I guess I haven’t really considered what happens AFTER the wedding... I’ve just been so caught up with the pomp and circumstance.”
“Honey,” Cormac said in a stage whisper. “You know how important this match is to me, and you know that I have the best chance of winning if he’s the Seeker.”
“There’s nothing to fix with Potter. We only became friends because of this whole setting up our bosses thing. And since that’s clearly not happening anymore…” Draco trailed off. “Besides, he is convinced that I’m the same person I was at seventeen and I may have told him to never speak to me again.”
“But did you see that wronski feint?” Oliver exclaimed, throwing his hands up in the air. “It was incredible! He’s nearing retirement and still nearly as good as Krum was in his prime. Amazing. We should keep our eye on him if he ever wants to work in the Department of Magical Games and Sports when his Quidditch career is over. You know, I’m going to need an expert Quidditch player for the Quidditch League Headquarters opening soon.”
“I’m covering the Quidditch match between the Harpies and the Cannons for The Prophet today, and I figured Oliver was going to make you go to report on, I don’t know, something boring probably,” Ginny crossed her arms and shrugged. “She also mentioned again that you were more fun to be around when you actually had time to shag your boyfriend. Can’t say I think highly of your choice in men though, McLaggen was such a prat in school.”
Pansy was out of town for the holiday, so he expected his flat to be empty when he arrived home. So it came as some surprise when he could hear loud voices from outside the front door. He opened the door slowly and breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that the voices belonged to Ginny and Harry who were lounging on the living room furniture.
“Morning?” Draco rubbed his eyes, and yawned. Why was Ginny here this early? Was she here last night? Conversations from the night before started to come back to him in bits and pieces, blurry in ways that suggested wine and explained his headache.
“I’m trying to apologize and tell you that you were right, you prat, just let me say I’m sorry!”  Draco pushed Harry’s shoulder playfully. “And thank you, you know, for not selling me out.  You could’ve so easily blamed everything on me and you didn’t. You were right about warning Oliver about Percy, and I should have told you sooner. I’m sorry that I pushed you to keep setting them up just for our benefit, and I’m sorry that you lost your job because of it.”
“If the auror thing doesn’t work out, what would you do instead? I can’t imagine you’d be able to live with yourself if you had to work for Percy forever.”
“It’s only the first day of us working together, I hope your vocabulary is big enough. It’d be a shame if you ran out of insults before the Quidditch season started.”
“I guess the only way the Weasel could forgive you for your romantic involvement with his sister is if she decided not even the
“Hermione Jean Granger, you and Ron are best friends and absolutely perfect for each other. You know I question most things and always have, but I have never questioned your love for each other.”
“Oh, gosh no!” Percy declared. “Things with Cormac are still very new! I wouldn’t want to put all of my eggs into one basket. Oliver is a perfectly suitable backup, and I don’t want to burn that bridge until absolutely necessary.  I’ll keep things more casual with Oliver until I know for sure that things with Cormac are more concrete.”
In fact, he’s already starting to show some characteristics of being a friend. He actually has some concern about Draco’s safety and worries about what else Voldemort might do.
Percy was not one to turn down free...anything, so he took a deep breath and chugged. Oliver was both incredibly impressed and shocked, but held up his end of the bargain and got the attention of Tom so he could purchase another round. This time though, they’d be shooting Firewhiskey.
“Yeah, sure,” Harry said through his fingers. “I will do literally anything to get rid of this hangover. My head hasn’t hurt this much since Voldemort was inside of it.”
Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy started off on very different paths: Harry was unloved until Hogwarts where his found family showed him compassion, understanding, and light. Draco was loved until Hogwarts where his found family showed him competition, hatred, and darkness. They balance each other out. Harry can be the beacon of hope that Draco so desperately needs, and Draco can show Harry how to navigate the Wizarding World (he certainly has had more experience in that matter than the Weasleys). Harry can learn to think before he acts, and Draco can learn how to support and build people up.
“I know that, but don’t I deserve a say?  Isn’t this supposed to be the most important day of our lives?” Harry ran his hands through his already mussed hair in frustration. “The whole reason we fought a war was to have a chance to really live.”
He walked a few blocks away from the Ministry and apparated to Cormac’s front door.  Draco reached for the ridiculously ostentatious door knocker. He never understood why Cormac insisted on having these ornately carved broomsticks on his front door. He rapped three times and waited. The door swung open, and Draco was disappointed to see that it was McLaggen’s house elf.
“Yes, well, I would hope it would be clear a man of my caliber would be interested in something more refined. Anyone worth associating with would be able to tell that.” Percy said, slightly puffing his chest before his eyes darted to the pile of papers on Harry’s desk. “Please organize this mess and finish those reports. I don’t employ you to be an office decoration.” Percy turned on his heel and strode back into his office. This time the door did slam, so hard that the mug on Harry’s desk rattled and nearly fell over.
“Figure something out.” He said as they arrived at the seventh floor. “You can finish the report on hoop stability when you get back with my dinner.”
The tea kettle began to glow a radiant blue behind them, but nobody reached for it.  Draco wasn’t used to being this honest and open, but he knew he was running out of time, so he powered through.
He hadn’t seen Harry around the office, so he assumed that he had told Oliver at least part of the situation and was following Draco’s request to cease communication.  It was all making itself out to be an absolutely dreadful week. He was greeted with a loud pop when he entered the living room.
He looked up to see low clouds swirling overhead, and a chill filled the stadium. The match continued, but more and more people in the crowd started paying attention to the odd weather instead. Harry instinctively reached for his wand and made his way down a few steps to the edge of the platform so he could get a better view of what was going on.
“I figured I would drop by to say hello.  I wasn’t aware he’d have company. I didn’t know the two of you were friends,

“Well,” Harry paused.  He had tried to come up with ideas, but by the time he got home from work it took all of his energy to deal with Hermione and Ron who were always loudly arguing about wedding related things. Ron, having no experience with muggle weddings, could not wrap his head around some of the traditions that Hermione insisted were necessary for their celebration. “I thought about it...a little. But, err, I don’t really have any suggestions. We have to figure out a way to have them run into each other, right?”
“No doubt,” she took in his disheveled appearance. “I figured it would be harder for you to refuse the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor if I made my case in person.” McGonagall took a seat in the armchair opposite Harry and crossed her legs.
He once again thought of Draco as he passed the display of licorice whips, Draco’s favorite.  But his anger and hurt were still fresh, so he walked by and brought his other sweets to the counter to pay.
“So the rumors are true, then.  And here I thought my best friend was yanking my chain this whole time.” Draco responded. “Really didn’t peg Ginevra as a Slytherin chaser and yet…”
“Easier said than done,” Draco walked into the lift when it arrived and lowered his voice so the other people around them wouldn’t hear. “But they work on different floors, so how would we get them in the same place at the same time?”  A few paper airplanes flew in as Draco and Harry continued to muse over how to make this happen. The lift made a few more stops, and a variety of witches and wizards came and went.
Step Two: accept that Draco is a child who deserves a redemption arc. I know Draco Malfoy is a little shit. He has to be an insufferable fuckweasel in order to firmly establish the Enemies/Rivals phase. There is no Drarry if they are not enemies first. It is their constant rivalry that fuels what will eventually become sexual tension, and the romance would just not be believable if Draco weren’t, well, Draco.
“Potter, this is utterly ridiculous.” Draco said, as Harry bopped his head and moved his arms about in a chaotic fashion. Draco stepped out of Harry’s reach and raised his eyebrow at Harry.
He was used to a revolving door of women, each as haughty and pureblood as the next. But then, a few months ago, Ginny Weasley had stumbled in giggling with Pansy after a night out drinking. Pansy had mentioned her occasionally, they were both employees at the Daily Prophet (Pansy was a gossip columnist, Ginny covered Quidditch), but he hadn’t realized they were
By the time Harry walked into the terraced home, his mood had not improved at all. If anything, he was even grumpier than before. Now, instead of just being mad at Percy for being a prick (which, Harry had to admit, was par for the course), he had also worked himself into being mad at Draco. He hadn’t figured out how, but he knew this was all Draco’s fault.
Draco hurried out of Malfoy Manor on Christmas morning. As glad as he was that he and Harry had managed to smooth over Percy and Oliver’s first big fight in enough time for the Christmas Holiday Trip to still happen, he realized as soon as he stepped foot on the sprawling grounds just how much he relied on the excuse of working for Wood to get through the holiday season.
“Walk with me, Potter.” He said guiding Harry around the newly renovated magical fountain in the direction of the lifts. “Have you thought any more about what I proposed the other day? I have a few ideas, but unfortunately I need your input.”
“I guess,” Harry shrugged. “It just feels like last names are so impersonal... for people you’re acquaintances with or don’t particularly like, and I thought that we’d reached the point where we were actually, maybe, friends. I wasn’t wrong about that, was I?”
“Erm, well,” Harry started. He hadn’t realized how difficult it was going to be to admit to McGonagall that he didn’t want to be an auror. She was the first one to really believe in him and had even stood up to Umbridge on his account when it came to the OWLS needed to progress on the auror path. “I’m just not sure being an auror is right for me anymore.  Feels like maybe I’ve spent enough time hunting down bad guys.” Harry managed to get out after his awkward silence.
During the day, Harry was thankful for the open floor plan in the Improper Use of Magic Office. The constant stream of people running in and out, and the fluttering of paper airplane memos overhead almost made him forget that he was stuck on desk duty for the foreseeable future. Almost. But now that the work day had ended, and everyone else hurried out of the office towards the magical toilets and floo powder fireplaces, the empty desks mocked Harry.
“Yeah, yeah, I get it. I’ll shower and cease all brooding activities.” Harry laughed and began to get up off of the couch.
But, in the books he is a child. He’s an only child, with overbearing parents. They’ve indoctrinated him from birth into a specific way of thinking. For the first eleven years of his life, he’s in this bubble of pureblood superiority where nobody ever dares speak out against their beliefs. He has, for sure, seen the tapestry at Grimmauld Place. He knows what happens if someone disagrees with the family-- they get disowned. He might not know the specific circumstance around Regulus Black, but if Sirius and Remus both assumed that Regulus was trying to back out from being a Death Eater and got killed for it, then the Malfoys probably came to a similar conclusion. For the Malfoys, blood is everything. Not just blood status, but also their families. In Draco's mind, if he doesn’t have his parents’ love and support, then what does he have? Abandonment? Death? Choosing family seems like a pretty easy choice for a kid given those alternatives.
“He can use yours,” Cormac replied. Draco’s hands instinctively clutched his broom tighter. “If Harry’s playing Seeker you won’t need it.”
"I don't know Neville," Draco muttered. "I think maybe this one has already come true." He narrowed his eyes at Harry, only to discover that Harry was already glaring back at him.
Perhaps the most telling thing that Dumbledore says in this moment was when he questions why Draco would have let Fenrir come to the school where so many children were and Draco admits that he didn’t, he didn’t know that Fenrir was going to invite himself. Draco cared about the collateral damage, even if he doesn’t want to admit that. There’s also the fact that Draco had Dumbledore alone, and he couldn’t do it. It’s all fun and games when you’re not the one who has to do the murdering, and it was easier for Draco to compartmentalize when he was only hearing about the deaths of a bunch of faceless blood traitors without having any personal stake in it. But when suddenly there was a face to go with the name, and the face was standing right in front of him and he was the one who was supposed to do the killing, I believe he really started to understand the magnitude of how evil Voldemort was.
Harry looked up as he heard the diner door chime, and saw Draco’s blond head disappear into the diner. “That son of a bitch.” Harry sprinted into the diner behind him, and watched with horror as Draco sweet-talked the cashier.
“Have fun with Hogwarts Hottie.” Draco winked. Harry watched Draco walk away and refocused his attention to Roger.  Roger smiled at him and Harry felt like things were finally looking up.
“You sounded a bit like Hermione for a second there,” Harry muttered. Draco took a swig of his beer in response, and looked down at the inkblot forming on his report.
“Possibly, but based on all of the testimony we’ve received, your involvement with the auror office is too much of a liability. Now please, get some rest.”  As Robards left the room, Harry drifted off into a fitful sleep wracked with nightmares of the Quidditch game and what his future would hold.
“You can pay me in acid pops for my problem solving services.” Ginny smiled smugly. “Well, what are you waiting for?”
Percy took off his cloak and draped it carefully on the back of his seat at the bar.  As always, he was five minutes early.  Percy strongly felt that getting somewhere early was being on time, getting somewhere on time was being late, and being late was inexcusable… It was one of his many gripes about his brother’s best friend and his assistant. Normally Percy would wait for his colleague to arrive before ordering a drink, but given that it was a Friday night and he had some nerves regarding the bet he placed on Tutshill Tornados (they were an underdog but if they could upset Puddlemere United, Percy would win quite the share of Galleons). He signaled for the barkeeper,
“Actually,” Harry said, feeling the need to defend himself. “I stopped reading the Prophet ages ago, so much gossip.”
“Harry was just about to tell me that when you interrupted,” Hermione told Ron. She put her hands on his shoulders and kissed his cheek. “Please, continue, Harry.”
“Oh wonderful! I’m looking forward to this. I haven’t had seats this good to a Quidditch match since the World Cup was in England and I went with my family!”
At the end of the last chapter, the seed had been planted that Draco could move on from the Dark Arts, and here is yet another moment to water that seed and help it grow into a redemption arc. Harry hadn’t personally witnessed anybody turning their back on the Dark Arts successfully before, but he can’t deny that he saw Dumbledore fight against them. Maybe there’s a chance that Draco, too, could change his mind. After all, Draco is only seventeen and he has the rest of his life ahead of him to see the error of his ways.
” Draco suggested, pausing just long enough for Harry to look nervous... “Oh, relax,” Draco waved his hand dismissively,  “I had an idea that might benefit us both, don’t worry.”
Thirty minutes later, they made it to the entrance to the Forbidden Forest. Harry was looking a little bit green, but he was determined to get this over with so he could have his hangover cure.
He remembered coming back to the flat he shared with Pansy distracted because he was replaying the conversation he had had with Potter as he walked back from the office after working late. He remembered sitting down on the couch and summoning a bottle of wine and two glasses, pouring one for himself and one for Pansy who was already sitting nearby.
“Well, you wouldn’t, would you?” Draco said, crossing his arms and looking away. “It wasn’t on the front page of the Prophet when it happened, and your name wasn’t mentioned so you wouldn’t have noticed.”
, and he absolutely didn’t want Draco Malfoy to see him like this because Harry Potter always wants to be his best when he’s around Draco). Draco spends most of this scene complaining to his father.
