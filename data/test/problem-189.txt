“A key?”
He must have made it out with Narcissa. Somewhere between their desperate flight, her capture, and her sentencing, Draco had escaped. He was probably in some Parisian apartment now, planning lavish funerals that no one would go to. Considering what Narcissa had done for Harry, what Draco had done in pretending not to recognize him, Harry didn’t even begrudge him his freedom. Not after losing his parents.
“It’s a question of ownership,” the other voice agreed, and there was a hum of agreement from the first voice. Harry knew one of the portrait subjects was an old Malfoy wandmaker, but wasn’t sure who else had come to visit with him.”Father said…”
He tried the door, but got a little resistance from the wards for the first time. Fair enough: he was there to prove himself to them, anyway. “This is my house,” he told the doorknob, and it gave a creak. He waggled it again more firmly, pushing some magic into his wrist as he shoved.
He stopped babbling and Draco sat without responding. The bench seats were stiff and uncomfortable, but the lean-to gave them a modicum of privacy. Harry cast a quick wandless muffliato, and Draco’s eyes darted over to him. “Isn’t that dangerous?”
“It’s my house, and I’ll wall the whole thing off if I want to,” Draco said sternly, and Harry made a show of rolling his eyes. He’d woken up feeling leaden and vaguely as though he was forgetting something. Maybe he needed more tea.
“Yeah, of course. Next week.” Harry let them keep talking, though he was sure they sensed his mood shift. They’d planned it all out, Ron and Hermione, and all he had to do was go along with the plan. It was a good plan, too. What he’d always wanted, what they’d all worked so hard for. He picked up another scone and began to pull it into dust.
Draco cleared his throat. Harry thought about Summoning him a glass of water, but didn’t want to be rude if he couldn’t drink it. Did ghosts like water? He seemed to remember the Bloody Baron sailing through Hagrid’s whiskey one night, when no one was looking. Did that count?
“New York?”
They watched The Craft after dinner and Draco laughed himself sick at every scene with magic in it. His laugh sounded a little stale, but soon the girls were playing Light As A Feather, Stiff As A Board, and Harry laughed, too.
He went to Draco’s room next. It was clearly Draco’s room — the second-biggest and the most modern, it was all pale wood and rich blues. It was surprisingly bright, actually, and Harry found himself drawn inside out of a genuine like for the surroundings. He’d never have guessed that Draco had a reading chair tucked into the window, a huge desk covered in schoolbooks he wouldn’t need anymore. There were additional Potions and Transfigurations books, one on Vanishing objects, proof of the task he’d been forced to complete for Voldemort piled up next to the evidence that he’d worked hard to compete with Hermione. He usually came in second to her, Harry remembered. He’d always assumed it had been from the most inherent magical knowledge, making Hermione’s studiousness all the more impressive. Now Harry thought maybe he’d been wrong — Ron’s family was just as old, and he hadn’t had nearly as many extra study materials near his bed.
A bus rattled up to them, and Draco’s head jerked up. Harry waved it on, and it pulled away. The moment of rumbling broke the pause, Draco continued.
He smoked a gross Dwarvish cigar and judged a Charms contest, where Padma and Luna raced Levitating footstools around the room. He held Neville’s growing hair back when he got sick in the garden, moaning all the while about the rarity of the plants he was puking on. He even made out with Dean and Ginny, just a little, but let them go upstairs without him.
“Then let’s go,” Harry said, seizing his bravery, and whirled them away.
“Yeah, we thought we’d stop by in person!” Savage chirped. “After all, we’ll be working side by side soon enough. What are you doing in this creepy old place?”
He jerked upright, but she had already put her hand out to calm him. She had balanced two biscuits on the knee of her pyjamas, and they wobbled alarmingly with the gesture.
“Rude,” Draco mumbled, as though he weren’t the one who had started it, and they wound up with a bizarre but delicious pizza cobbled together from what was left — purple kale and crushed walnuts and apple slices and some dark cured meat that Draco said was elk.
“Potter? Granger? What are you doing here?” Robards asked, rather politely, all things considered.
“Undead,” Harry teased softly. Draco huffed out a laugh.
Draco didn’t even bother to answer, but he did hold the door open to the front hall, letting Harry pass before swinging it shut behind them. He followed Harry to the kitchens, where he made a pleased sound upon discovering the coffee, but didn’t say thank you before picking it up. He just took a sip and pointed to the magic cupboard. When Harry opened it, he found an herb drawer, which accepted the bundle of greenery he dumped inside and immediately began organizing it, labels springing up wherever a new bunch folded together.
“Can I sleep here tonight?” he interrupted, before the fight could kick into some new gear.
Draco scoffed. “You don’t know what you want.” And that hurt to the core. Because as confused as Harry was, as surprised as he would have been a year ago to have given up Ginny, to reject Auror training, he
And the water poured and poured. Harry sobbed for breath, falling a little against the stone stairwell as the floods finally reached his knees. He felt drained suddenly, too exhausted to stop the upward-swelling flow. It tickled his toes, his calves. He sat down on the step and waited for it to take him.
Like anything between them, it became contentious immediately, hard and furious like a hardscrabble Quidditch match, both of them diving recklessly down through the sky after the same shining object.
He kicked his shoes off instead, leaving them sideways and nowhere near his mismatched socks, which sank into the mud when he stepped on them. Draco puffed out a sigh of exasperation and twitched his wand, sending Harry’s things into a neat line next to his own.
Draco watched, leaning against the counter without saying a word, just out of arm’s reach. He just watched as Harry started chopping, grating, peeling, and eventually sat on the countertop. Harry didn’t look at him directly, afraid of scaring Draco away before he’d had a proper meal. For someone like Harry, cooking came naturally, but he suspected the blond had been scavenging just cold, uncooked foods – bread and honey and apples, bits of jerky and assorted nuts. The new foods that had showed up with the appearance of Draco’s wand must be his favorites, but he looked like he’d been starving for most of the time he’d been alone here. And if anyone knew anything about keeping quiet and hungry in closed-off rooms, it was Harry.
It didn’t work. He still felt like a child, lost and adrift in legal papers and cursed elf-heads. And Draco was probably dead. He didn’t know why that made him feel the most unbalanced.
They assembled a heaping pile of biscuits and crisps, with an even mix of newspapers and celebrity magazines on top. Harry hadn’t thought to bring a backpack, so he hefted the bag over one shoulder, not wanting to lighten it magically if it would make Draco worry.
Harry hid his thoughtful frown in his cup. He was sick of not knowing the shape of his future. But Draco… Draco was suddenly, definitely where he wanted his future to start. It seemed too much to ask for, but if Hermione thought it was possible...“Am I really all that stubborn?”
He wondered for a moment if he should hold a funeral, then shook himself. It was his
“I’m not an idiot,” Harry said automatically, mostly for the sake of having something to say.
Draco watched him get in, lingering outside the tub like a suspicious cat. “I thought you just had the lightning bolt.”
“I’m not saying he did the right thing. But I understand more than I used to.”
They Apparated to the top of the manor at sunset to eat and to drink. Draco had pulled another bottle of wine from his secret hiding spot, and he opened it with a lazy pass of his wand.
Draco picked his head up a bit as they headed to the Floos to leave, holding it high as Ministry workers started to notice Harry, and then him. Harry’s heart ached to see it, the way Draco had left after their fight to see a movie in peace, the hours of fear he’d faced, and the deep-bred pride that picked his head up despite it all.
“You coming home?” Ron asked, rubbing his hands up and down Hermione’s arms as if to warm her. He’d looked after them both all night, but he still looked pleased and tipsy, his smile crooked as his nose. Hermione had finally seemed to relax as well, and he longed to confess everything to their familiar faces.
“Was it following my lead to take me to muggle London? Some fucking lunch date?” Draco shook his head, looking regretful. “I shouldn’t have agreed. I’m not safe here.”
“What, the Muggle kind?”
Ron took his hesitation as an answer. His face softened. “You know we’re still brothers, right mate?”
Harry nodded. When Ron left he Levitated the boxes upstairs. From the landing of the grand staircase, the layout of the house was pristine. Not a drop of blood. Not a speck of dirt. Upstairs was much the same: he put his things into the first bedroom he found, which was packed with gilded Florentine furniture that was so tacky it had to be unbearably expensive. It seemed like a guest room, though, and Harry wasn’t about to curl up in Lucius Malfoy’s spot.
“Oh.” He didn’t know what Pratt was, but he wasn’t stupid. During the beat of silence that followed, Molly peeked out of the curtains and pulled them shut again. Ginny and Harry both rolled their eyes. “She knows?”
Hey all!!
“No, no.” Hermione waggled a carton at him. “I’ll just sleep for twelve hours, and then tomorrow I have an appointment with Professor Vector. I owled her to ask if it was too late to change my Arithmancer’s Thesis from last year if I were to retake the class, because I have a lot of new ideas after what we did with the Horcruxes, and I think if I were to - Don’t look at me like that, I wasn’t going to
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, grasping her wrist to keep her from looking. He kept his eyes focused elsewhere, deliberately ignoring the flash of blond that had sent a shock through his stomach. “Just the birds. I’ll come next week. I promise.”
“Who says
“I’ll be there,” he promised. “I came out today, didn’t I?”
“Are there more?” Harry asked, instead of rising to the bait, and searched the ground around him. All the grass just looked like grass.
Draco glanced down at Harry’s hold on him. It was a tight grip, and not strictly necessary anymore, but Harry hadn’t released him yet. Pain made him sway a little:, Draco moved with him before he captured Harry’s forearm, just as hard as Harry must have been holding onto him. The world had shrunk down to the pain in Harry’s arm and head and hand and the sound of Draco’s voice and the unreadable expression in his eyes.
“Could you not point your wand at me so I don’t kill you by accident?” he griped, finally giving in and sitting down. And even though he’d taken down the Dark Lord, Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Take your stupid clothes off, Harry Potter” Draco said against his neck, as supercilious as ever. But Harry, driven unreasonable by the pressure of hands and dick and mouth, Vanished them all in one surge of almost-accidental wandless magic. Draco laughed, delighted, and the fire sprung up higher behind them, casting strange shadows on the dark-wooded walls.
“What, mate?” It was Ron, popping up into Harry’s line of vision half-dressed. “Is something wrong?”
With every surge of the magic that poured out of him, loose and sloppy with no wand but endless emotion, he remembered. He remembered the Muggle bodies that had bent and broken, the diary of Tom Riddle stashed between family photo albums upstairs. He thought of Luna down there, not crying, but humming, and about her laying on the couch, stringing popcorn garlands. He thought about Ollivander and finally Draco again, Draco trying to sleep as Voldemort sat below. He’d grown to pity Malfoy in the last few years, but now he thought maybe he respected him too. Harry had thought he’d known everything about growing up in a house of horrors. But what good were loving parent, if they led you into darkness? What was the love of a parent, if they died and left you to fend for yourself amidst every evil in the fucking world?
They ate the pork pies standing up in the kitchen, Draco dripping grease over the newspapers he spread across the table. Harry skimmed them for a while, equal parts amused and offended by the public perception of his last years’ reality. Draco lingered over a spread about his father, a few recent pieces about the reparations to Hogwarts, and found a full-page spread of photos of Harry, published when he’d been in hiding.
It had felt like seconds as Harry rushed in with Hermione that morning, but now the seconds stretched into eons as they made their way out in silence. Silence between them, anyway. In the enormous marble hall, the whispers were getting louder, irritating Harry and likely overwhelming for Draco, who had spent so long hiding from these very eyes, and been thrust so unwillingly in front of them.
“Oh, no, I… no.” Draco sat up, and Harry, upset with himself now for losing his warm body pillow, sat up with him. “I don’t look nice.”
“He’s out. We’re working to get his house back, and all that. Pansy’s in on it too. He might need character witnesses, actually, Luna.”
“Ah. Right.” Draco finally passed the bottle back, and their hands brushed. It felt weird, that shock of skin, but at least it confirmed Draco was alive. “Are we going anywhere?”
Harry stopped in the door frame and glanced back. Draco
Harry hesitated. He hadn’t expected to be handed an excuse. Ron didn’t understand the way his and Ginny’s love had devolved into something strong yet familial. He was tempted to take the excuse, even if Hermione wouldn’t fully buy it, but of course it wasn’t Ginny. Not with his dreams of Draco gnawing at him. Guilt rang through his body at the thought of keeping anything from Ron and Hermione, but he wasn’t about to tell them about a wet dream any time soon.
Next he let the peacocks in the house — there were three, and they seemed pleased to be inside, shitting everywhere and curling up to sleep in odd places. Harry was sure they had fanciful names like Veni, Vidi, and Vici, but he called them Snow and Pearl and Betty White for their coloring. Betty immediately started sleeping in Draco’s bed with him, and Harry was grateful to the Manor for clearing their messes.
He didn’t have much to share in response, but it was nice to catch up. He promised to Floo soon before they parted ways, doubling back to the apothecary that Malfoy had mentioned.
“It’s not fucking funny,” Harry snarled. His knees stung like he’d ripped through his jeans and into the skin with the fall. He levered himself upright with a vicious yank on Draco’s arm, drawing himself up to face the other boy properly.
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco swore, turning now to pinch at him. He wound up half on Harry, and Harry wrapped one arm around him to ruffle his hair, dropping it down once Draco was distracted in fixing it and tugging Draco up against his side.
Harry could feel the disbelief in the air and knew they were seconds away from being approached. He always was, these days, and he longed to be back to the peace of the manor too.
“No promises,” Hermione said with a sniff designed to wind him up. Ron grinned.
It was strange to step through the fireplace, Ron behind him, both carrying a battered cardboard box. The place felt like no time had passed, like Bellatrix was just around the corner. Harry shivered: who knew what was left in this haunted place?
Draco looked up at that, and his eyes were dark and huge.
“You watch it,” Harry warned, and mussed up that perfect hair up, getting gel in his hands and a stinging jinx for his trouble. “Ow! You fucker.”
As always, Ron’s chatter was aimed to soothe, and as always, it worked. Harry let himself be walked away, once again, from the planning committee. “You’re going to be a good Auror, Ron,” he said with a sigh.
“No, no, no,” Ron lamented, and Harry shut his eyes, and they jostled each other into a tight grip that felt, to Harry, like every other time they’d hugged like this, Quidditch victories and reunions and the terrifying joy of having survived something awful together.
“Do you want some more stuff, then?” Ron looked to Hermione, who nodded and disappeared again. Harry was starting to feel like he was watching some sort of puppet show.
“Okay there, champ?” Ron was asking. He tipped his head down toward Harry’s, checking his eyes like a mother hen. Harry suppressed the smile that Ron always brought out in him — Ron’s urge to check Harry’s forehead like Molly would was evident. “You smoke anything, snort anything?”
In his arms, the stack of newspapers twitched with moving photos. Harry’s own face stared up from the top, and he shoved them all into his bag so fast that he saw his black-and-white doppleganger wrinkle.
Williamson nodded, but Savage didn’t know when to shut up. “I’ve heard tale of criminal mischief and attacking other students-“
“If you’ve ever a moment,” Harry agreed, although he kept his voice light. He didn’t want to put any pressure on them coming — even just on Ron, if it would make Hermione feel like she ought to go, too.
“She did!” Hermione smirked at Ron, who went pink and happy. “I meant to tell you, I found out yesterday.”
Harry paused. It sounded like there was a compliment on there somewhere, albeit unintentionally. “So not only can I stay now, you need my help?”
Harry tried to look friendly. “Well if I want to sign up then I know where to find you. Thanks for coming by.”
“Okay, weirdo,” Ron said, after a minute of silence. “It can be your comfort zone. Let’s just go get dinner, Mom says she’s making trifle.”
“Not until I’m dressed!” Ron looked guilty, then pleased, then embarrassed, all at once.
“Oh,” Harry remembered, delight growing at the chance to annoy Malfoy, “you mean Snow, Pearl, and Betty White?”
Harry didn’t answer. His eyes were glued to Draco, whose face had lit up with the happiest expression that Harry had ever seen on him, barring the times he’d been doing something especially horrible in school. He was laughing, grinning, crying a little, holding Pansy to his body like a precious gift.
Draco and Pansy started talking over each other, rapid-fast, and Hermione hovered as close as she dared, interjecting here and there when Draco got to the plan. Pansy had gone from
Things were normal again now, the new normal that was easy banter and endless shoving - though each brush of contact made something dark flutter in his gut. It was all too easy to get caught up in some stupid conversation, something about apricots and Harry’s apelike clothing choices, the obvious pointing out of Draco wearing Harry’s clothes, the furious backtracking. The rap at the door took them both by surprise.
. His presence woke Harry up, and he propped himself back up without saying anything. Eventually Draco perched on the other arm of the couch, fidgeting with his knee. He was wearing his old clothes, but the knees looked worn, the black trousers less than black.
There was a snort. Harry whirled round on the portrait behind him, which stayed quiet.
“I’m not leaving.” Harry argued, rolling his eyes. “You may be bound to the Manor by blood but it’s mine legally now. If I leave, you’ll get Unplotted, and you’ll have to haunt a house in some magic black hole somewhere.”
“I… sure,” Harry offered, though he didn’t. “So you’ve gone to parties there?”
“I know you are,” Harry said sweetly, and didn’t move, “but what am I?”
“Cheers, Hermione.” He signed off and stared at the sweater in his hands for a moment before dropping it to go back outside.
. “I’m some kind of invisible man.”
It felt like what he needed. Draco felt like what he needed, ribs and teeth and fingertips. So he kissed him again. Draco’s lips were a soft press of sweetness, opening in a slip of cool sparks that was a slow motion revelation. Their bodies bumped and pressed and aligned in a delicate hardness that sent shivers through Harry’s scalp and spine and teeth alike. Every twist of air and fate brought their hips together, the friction buffeting them ever upward toward the light of every chandelier above. It was erotic in the most painful way, burning through Harry so fiercely that he wasn’t sure if he would come or burst into light.
“What’s that?” he asked, nodding at a dish across the room. Harry laughed. They were tucked into a corner table, where they could spy on passerby through the draughty window. But Draco had zeroed in on a burger and chips being served instead.
He didn’t want to leave the safety and peace of the theater, not really, but a teenager came in with a broom and dustpan and they let themselves be kicked out. It was the best date Harry had ever been on, and it wasn’t even a date.
The shock of eye contact then would stay with Harry his whole life. It was magnetic, how their eyes caught, the way they always had, even across a Quidditch pitch or a room full of tables. It was iron and irresistable, just like the pressure of that overwhelmed him now — the grey buzz of Dracos’ gaze as demanding and rewarding and sweetly painful as the up-and-down of them.
“No, Hermione. I should have, though, shouldn’t I? I’ll go back out later.”
“My mom would braid their hair,” Draco added, perhaps sensing Harry’s momentary slip into malaise. “She had a way with hair, she would always braid my dad’s, too. I think she wanted me to grow mine out, too. She used to play with it a lot when I was a kid.”
Now he saw the proof of all the awful ways he’d tried to do something to Draco, do
It was nothing like his dreams.
Draco.
“Look at the projector!” Ginny crowed on the way, and Harry glanced back to see Ron checking in on Hermione. He left them for the moment, showing Dean and Ginny where to slide bottles into the fridge and twitching his wand out of his pocket to turn the lights up and set some wards to keep people from sneaking upstairs.
He dreamed of Draco.
“I have time.” Harry stirred, tasted again. The spice had cooled to the level he liked it, still hot but not hot-hot-hot. “I have nothing but time.”
“What?” Harry couldn’t work out if he was surprised. She
“She told me that too,” he remembered.
“My wand?”
He wriggled down on his belly, tugging the trousers further as he did, until Draco was kicking them off, Harry shifting to let him and helping yank them over one bony ankle. They had one moment of muffled laughter and a shared grin, their eyes meeting in a shock of intimacy, and then Harry kept his eyes locked on Draco’s as he swallowed his dick back down. The new angle allowed him to choke it all down, and he fought a smirk as he saw Draco’s eyes widen, then flutter shut.
Harry couldn’t seem to relax, though. He was in disbelief, still, and a part of him felt near-frozen in shock. The touch of Draco’s hand had done something to him, something that felt heavy and permanent.
“You have to learn how to cook at some point,” Harry groused, but only half-heartedly. He liked being useful, and he whipped up an omelette with leftover ham and cheese. They ate sitting side-by-side, bumping feet and tangling ankles, and when Draco finished his food, pecked Harry on the forehead, and went back to his books without helping with the washing-up, Harry did his best not to get upset this time.
He still didn’t know what had made her say it, and Draco was dodgy about the details of their conversation when he asked. But the next day he half-woke to Draco’s chaste, early-morning kiss, fell back asleep to the sound of puttering about in the walls, and woke up for good to the sound of the Floo and Hermione’s familiar footsteps coming up the stairs. He turned his head on the pillow to see her come in, smile at whatever she saw on his sleep-addled face, and then knock on the wall.
After the movie Draco stood and stretched. “Did you eat?”
He’d arrived early, and the Floo at the Three Broomsticks had been empty, only a breakfasting elderly couple and an unfamiliar server there to see Harry arrive. Still, he kept his head down on the walk, not trusting himself to be kind with anyone who might approach to thank the great Harry Potter.
“I don’t want you to stay, I need you to stay.” Draco shoved at Harry, perhaps to cover the weakness of his words. But his shove wasn’t much stronger.
Harry laughed: so be it. It wasn’t like Draco could hate him any more.
“But he won’t explain it!”
He picked it up, twirling it idly as he remembered the slain unicorn in the Forbidden Forest, Draco’s abject terror. How had such a scared kid ended up with Dumbledore at the wrong end of his wand?
. He could have talked to me, hidden with me, but instead he’s been with you.”
“You don’t have to eat it,” Harry said mildly. Draco watched him set the cakes to baking, being good until there was an empty bowl to steal and stick his fingers in. “Put the kettle on, won’t you?” To his surprise, Draco actually licked his fingers clean and hopped down to obey.
Draco disappeared for about five hours, apparently content to return back to his walled-off apartment, unconcerned with the fact of Harry in his house, altering everything.
Harry bit back his instinctive retort. It had occurred to him, somewhere around when Draco’s voice had hitched on “tomb,” that this was what panic looked like on him. Maybe it always had been — maybe the worse Malfoy had been as a kid, the more stress he had been under from Daddy Death. It almost put the heights of dickery that he’d reached in sixth year into perspective. “I got caught up.”
Harry sighed. One hangover and he was throwing Draco’s will to live back at him like a bad thing. “Maybe we could use some Pepper-Up,” he added reluctantly. “Do you have any?”
More than anything, Draco reminded him of a cat. There was a bit of Crookshanks about him, in the way he pretended to ignore Harry until something caught his interest. It was there in the twitch of his foot like the twitch of a tail, there in the way he pushed an egg off the counter when Harry got too absorbed in baking.
It was hours before they got sick of flying, weaving back through the trees to the concrete benches where Harry had been completing his morning trips. Draco touched down first. Harry followed after, noting as he descended that Draco had picked up some leaves in his hair.
It was nice, for a moment, to be back on the same page, and Harry felt a pang when Draco redid his hair once it was over.
“Dial it down, please, Ron.” Hermione pushed off the wall and went to him, pulling Ron’s long, freckled fingers out of an angry gesture and into her own hands. “This must have been a hard decision for Harry, to make him change his mind.”
“If nothing else, you’ll always have that Malfoy blonde,” Harry said, and then regretted making the joke, but Draco surprised him with a smile.
He fed the fish. Ate a slice of Molly’s quiche standing up over the sink. And left for Hogsmeade.
She squinted at him, then nodded. “Okay. And you’re right, we don’t know what it’s like to be or lose a twin. I just hope he doesn’t do anything like that again. It’s good that they’re circling the wagons, it will help remind him of all the brothers he does have.”
“He’s done nothing wrong, Kingsley.”
“How do I look?” Draco turned to the time-smudged mirror that sat above a console table, squinting at his face. His hands went to his hair first, and Harry stepped behind him, watching both of their reflections. Draco looked plain, like an off-brand Seamus, but there was still some essential Draco-ness to the lift of his eyebrows. Harry caught Draco’s eyes: he’d been staring too long.
Oh boy your eyes betray what burns inside you
Harry’s anger spiked into place, coming easily as ever. He bit some down with effort. “Well, as the Ministry knows, I inherited this
it!” Harry pressed the palms of his hands into his eyes. “Don’t you get it? I want
Hermione and Hannah were chatting in low voices at the kitchen table while Harry made tea. He Levitated the tray back and waited for everyone to prepare their mugs before he took Hermione’s hand under the table. She squeezed tight and leaned against Ron, who mumbled something about piskies.
Harry took a step forward, then another. He kneeled for the second time this night, more carefully this time. His thighs ached.
He turned the floors into thick glass, dropped balls of illumination into the the dark water underneath them. He’d let the pent-up magic in his wand unfold for a moment, before screwing up his face and bringing the koi inside. They popped up in the waters, one after another like spots of blooming color, streaking quickly and then settling, more sedately, into a rhythm.
Ron was biting his lip, running through some spells. He tapped each wall in turn, waiting until the orange light he was conjuring turned green. Finally he turned to Harry and shook his head.
“I doubt it. My property is in your name right now, the Gringotts accounts may as well be, too. If they aren’t already.”
So he handed the paper over without unfolding it, and left with a heavy bag that tinkled and clattered as he walked. He’d been right not to worry: the potions were labeled, and they were fairly dull. There was a hangover cure, a general Pepper-Up, and some coagulating and anti-scarring serums. Most guilt-inducing of all were the ones Draco had been trying to hide. There was a weight gain supplement made with sea-dragon blubber, the legal maximum of Dreamless Sleep, and an ingestible dilution of dandelion root that had had a Cheering Charm placed inside.
“That’s right,” Ron jumped in, coming back with three pints held close to his body. “If Malfoy’s dead, that house is yours. Plus you guys are cousins, right?”
He liked all of it, really. He was surprised, but maybe he shouldn’t have been. He’d never spent time alone like this, save a few weeks at the Leaky Cauldron the year he’d blown up his Aunt Marge. He liked setting his own hours, eating his own meals, hearing his own thoughts. He liked the Manor, now that he’d been there long enough to think of it as having two distinct identities. It was a benign, beautiful place, and it was a place where horrible things had happened. He thought maybe horrible things happened at all kinds of places, and it wasn’t the fault of the stone and the grass.
Where everyone had lingered in Grimmauld overnight, there seemed to be an unspoken agreement to leave Malfoy manor en masse. The party had gone better than Harry could have imagined, but it would be nice to keep it lit and friendly throughout the night, to make a huge breakfast and distribute Pepper-Ups alongside a hungover Draco.
Draco’s face went through a dozen more pinched emotions that Harry wouldn’t have been able to read a month ago. Anger, at the implication that Harry would defend the manor better. Shame, at returning to hiding. And back to fear, above all a worn-in look of fear. “Okay. Harry- okay.”
They were both laughing when Ron’s Patronus came racing in.
“I told you, safety.” Draco sounded calmer now, more openly sad. He kept his eyes closed, so Harry didn’t stop petting his hair once it was fixed. He risked rubbing a thumb over Draco’s ear, and it was softer than it looked. Draco’s breath caught, and Harry pulled his hand reluctantly away.
Harry backed up to let her in, surprised. “You didn’t have to come over.” If Hermione had good reason not to come back, certainly Luna had even more of one. But she stepped forward, unconcerned, ignoring Harry now to wander over to the window. She sniffed the air, then went around a corner. Harry, bemused, trailed after her.
“You haven’t been going to the dinners.”
Harry frowned. “Are you sure? Maybe being a ghost takes some getting used to.”
“You don’t think the plan will work?”
They put lunch on the table in silence and Draco came down twenty minutes later, his nose still in a book.
“I look un-Malfoy or good?” Draco’s strange face relaxed a bit with a new opportunity to mock Harry. “Those are mutually exclusive. Shall we do you?”
“I’ll keep it in mind goodbye,” he managed to say, waving like an idiot until they took the cue and popped into nothingness. “
“Do you want to go in?” He wasn’t sure what made him say it, but he didn’t expect to see Draco’s eyes widen in horror. “What?” Draco was still staring past him, so Harry turned to see what he was looking at.
“Mm.” Draco seemed to be falling asleep now, his chin tucked into his chest as he blinked at the scenes of spacecraft shooting across the wall. “Mhm.” His voice had gone low and sleepy, and it sent a thrill through Harry that startled him.
He stood carefully, Draco releasing him, and avoided eye contact as he found his wand on the floor and Summoned his sweatpants and a tee. The sweats tangled on the stairwell, and he had to wobble over to retrieve them, dressing quickly while Draco was distracted cleaning up and tucking his dick away. He felt sore and shy and heartsick, and it didn’t sit comfortably. He wanted to  sit back down, to curl against Draco’s chest or hold Draco against his, press their full bodies together for a dose of nonspeaking comfort. He wasn’t sure how sex fit into the relationship between them now, or how to talk about it now that it was happening. It was good, so good, but this pain between his legs was new to him, and Harry felt vulnerable all over again in a way he hadn’t realized Draco may have as well, when it had been his body making way for Harry. If that had even been Draco’s first time — he didn’t even know.
“I’m pureblood,” she confided. “Sacred twenty-eight, on my mom’s side. Of course my dad took her name, you know how that whole thing goes.”
“Crookshanks, come on Hermione, the house let me in.”
“You didn’t go off with them? FIll out a job application? As if you’d have to keep going past your name.” Draco shoved the pile viciously to the side. There were linen trousers wrinkling underneath everything: he checked them, too, before adding them to the pile. “There. I can live off of that for a year. I can’t sell Mother’s gowns, of course, but maybe some costume jewelry.”
“It’s okay, she didn’t see us.” Harry tried to touch Draco’s shoulder, but Draco pulled away. “Even if she had, it’s just Hermione.”
“What else?” Harry waited for Draco to open his eyes, and caught his grey eyes with green.
The elder Malfoys were dealt with, and so no one had gone looking for him at first. Lucius had died when another Dark lackey aimed their wand sideways in the last battle, some ice-cold revenge from the long years of infighting. Narcissa had caught a cold while awaiting trial in Azkaban, which carried her off swiftly after. Harry had felt a whiff of regret when he’d heard about it: she’d been a mixed bag, not all evil. He spared a thought for Draco, even, feeling something like reluctant pity when he remembered Draco’s pointy eleven-year-old face, mocking Harry for being an orphan.
“Give that back,” Harry demanded, reaching up into the air above his head. He only succeeded in brushing the floating disc, sending flour snowing down into his wild hair. He swiped for it again, shirt coming up his belly as he reached.
“Is your house Grimmauld Place?” he asked instead, surprising Harry.
“And I bet you don’t even know what day it is,” Hermione finished, jabbing at the air again.
“Maybe.” Harry worried his lip, thinking. “I went out to the edge of the property the other day. I’ll try it out and let you know. There’s something I’ve been wanting to do outside anyway.”
“Hmmm,” Hermione added, sounding thoughtful. Harry kept his eyes shut to avoid whatever look she was giving him.
Harry hesitated, but he’d already unleashed his inner Gryffindor. “Do you trust me?”
“Debatable,” he lied, and because he didn’t want to give her the space to list examples, he kept talking. “I’ll be out of there soon, anyway.”
“Malfoy!”
“Fucking clearly,” Draco said, his patience depleted. “Spit it out, Potter.”
Harry shut his eyes again, comfortable in the white noise of their familiar arguments. His nose still hurt: he knew it was a phantom pain, but it was easier to focus on than the hurt in his chest. Even now Draco was likely licking his wounds, shutting off walls, dumping Harry’s things into the lawn to be shat on by Betty White and Garuda.
“I just— I feel like I finally understand the summer you’ve been having. I wish I’d known earlier.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, when it was his turn.
sounded ridiculous. They wouldn’t have gone on a date, in the world. There was only the manor, and something too precious to take outside of it.
Draco ate his way through a cheeseburger, two orders of chips, and half of Harry’s burger as well. It felt strangely comfortable, now that Draco didn’t look so much like a cornered animal, sitting out in the world and sharing a meal. Harry had worried that the peace between them was tied to the manor and its isolation, but it seemed to have gone into Islington with them. He only wished they’d done it before. Draco had lost so much over the last few months and years, it felt good to give him something, small though it was. Or maybe it wasn’t small, but it was just the start of what Harry wanted to give him.
“I knew,” Harry said, although that wasn’t quite true. “At least, I hoped.”
Well then.
“Sometimes the House Unplots itself,” Ron supplied reluctantly. “Goes missing. Whole Wizarding colonies have done it before, you know. Roanoke, Atlantis, even Brigadoon had a variation of it for a while. Think of it like Grimmauld to the Muggles. But no worries, mate, right? You gave it a try, you can’t be locked up in here forever. How many places do you even need?”
He scraped himself out of the sheets and padded down the hall, where the smell of tea and reheated Weasley leftovers were leaking up the stairs. For a minute, he stood at the door to the drawing room, watching the back of Draco’s head. His bony shoulders rose up from the couch in a thin t-shirt and his long legs were propped up on the table in front of him. He was watching Ferris Bueller’s Day Off with the volume low, and as Harry watched, he laughed quietly at something Matthew Broderick was saying. He didn’t know if Draco’s low volume was coming from his months of isolation, or because he thought Harry was sleeping. Both possibilities made his heart clench.
“Thank fuck, me either,” Harry agreed, and Draco gave his cheek a light smack before releasing his face. “I don’t even know where to start.”
“Hilarious.” Draco’s eyes finally met Harry’s again — they were cool with anger, in that very Malfoy way that always reminded Harry of white fire. Draco was better at it than Lucius. Lucius’ rage was usually hotter, but Draco had just as much of his mother’s ice. The result was so cold it burned, and Harry couldn’t help the smug feeling that rose up at having caused it. It was the most life that Draco had shown since his appearance.
“Perhaps I’ll go bald. Or dye it some atrocious color.”
“I was getting to that.” Draco lifted his wand and directed a slow stream of water back into the kettle, avoiding Harry’s eyes now as he spoke. “I have a few errands you could run. At Diagon, you know. Basic potions ingredients and such. And then we can fix up the house some more, if you’d like. We have to compromise on the koi, they don’t need the entire floor. The sitting room would suffice. We can Charm the walls to match, I know a good one. And if you’d like to make some more changes, there’s a gargoyle out back that’s been hassling me since childhood. I can’t unStick it myself but surely your freakish magical ability should extend to stonework.”
“See? Muggle stuff. There’s a Starbucks and a McDonald’s by here, you can’t beat that.”
The only thing in Harry’s head was
“I heard you, you know,” Draco said instead. “I hear everything in here.”
“We’re not handing out detentions, man. See if there’s enough evidence for a trial. Act as though you need justification to detain a boy.”
“I fucking swear that I told you to shut up,” Draco said again, and then leaned forward, the blankets between them shifting as loudly as crashing waves. It took him a thousand years to cross the inches between them, and Harry felt the years within each second as acutely as any pain he had ever felt in his short, painful life.
“The restorations are done, at least, so I’ll have access to everything I need on-campus,” she finally concluded that day, lifting her mug to her lips before discovering that she’d drained it in her distraction.
I started a new job and another WIP, but I'm back to working on Rapidly Becoming!
Around him the bickering had moved on from mobiles onto the emotional labor involved in buying Arthur’s father’s day gift, which had clearly been kicking around the argument bank since June.
I am softly watching you
“Perhaps there is some… mutual… unusual behavior,” Draco allowed, and then surprised Harry by tilting inward, pressing a kiss to his mouth. He looked equally surprised afterward, but Harry kissed him again before he could regret it. And then they were just kissing again, slow and lazy, Draco nestled against Harry’s shoulder as though he weren’t slightly taller.
It felt like hours that he was locked in terror, screaming, crying, Vodemort’s eyes, his mother’s screams, Dumbledore’s hand. Ron walking away, Hagrid weeping, Fred on the ground. He felt locked in, like it would never end, like he would live forever in a soul-suckingly horrible moment, like the mouths of Dementors, like the feeling of Avada Kedavra invading his body.
Still, he didn’t want to disturb their reluctant truce to the point of breaking, so he redoubled his efforts to find another bowtruckle. Harry ran his fingers through the undergrowth, watching his chewed-on, much-scarred fingers spread out through leaf after tumbling leaf. After a moment, something moved at the touch of his hand, and he found himself lifting another strange creature to his face. The bowtruckle looked just like plant life, its camouflage better than any butterfly. A curious little face peered up at Harry. He grinned, delighted.
“You’re wrong!” Harry could feel his magic building in his gut, and he fought to hold it down. “We can’t stay there forever. You know we can’t.” He hadn’t wanted to admit it, really, but it felt truer than ever out here in the fresh, free air. He was tired and wanted to go home to the manor, but he wanted to be able to come back, wanted this day to be the start of Draco’s freedom. It was so frustrating to think of the world around them, the world Draco had wanted to know more about all day long, disappearing again.
Ron tipped his glass and said, tightly, “Fred.” Hermione said “Tonks and Remus.” Dean, thoughtfully, said “Snape,” and almost no-one booed. “Dumbledore,” Ginny added, and Transfigured everyone’s drinks into a Sherbet Lemondrop for that sip.
“I think it looks better this way,” Ron said helpfully, and ran away when Harry tried to smack him. He gave chase, and cornered Ron in the sitting room, grabbing for the drumstick in a brotherly fight that felt a world away from the one he’d just finished. “Don’t you dare,” Ron laughed, cradling his prize to his chest like an infant. “I’ll poke you in the nose.”
“Shut up.” Harry told him, naked and blushing, angry and jealous and turned on. “You wanted me to.”
Harry gave up and crouched down, meeting Draco where he was at on the floor. “I’m not going anywhere, Draco. If I even consider it, you’ll be the first to know. I promise.”
Draco was leaning on the kitchen island, uncertain, when Harry came in. His hand was wrapped around a bottle of Firewhiskey, and he still held himself in that proud, prickly way that signaled fear, though his shoulders had come down from their catlike hunch.
Harry just stared. Neville chuckled, and shrugged at him. “Again, she only told me.”
“Scared, Potter?” Draco grinned, and Harry gave up.
.” Harry poked Draco, who turned back to him with a smile. He seemed relaxed now, more excited about the discoveries there were to be made now that they were snack-related and not Voldemort-related.
?” she asked again, this time desperate. “Please. I just want to help him, and I need all the information I can get.”
He’d never had a

“Killing’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he murmured, and then some bubbles tilted down into his eye, and the tense conversation was broken up by splashing and eye-rubbing and cautious laughter.
“At least you’re a sexy savior,” he retorted, folding one side of the paper down so Harry could see its cover.
Harry felt slow and tired and stupid. He reached up and carefully began setting Draco’s hair back to rights, moving slowly. Draco bowed his head and shut his eyes. Their voices had gotten quieter as they’d gotten closer together, and the peace of the night emerged from the silent minutes between them.
The last words had the stink of Hermione all over them, and Harry finally opened his eyes to study her. He found her already looking at him, her rich redwood eyes seeing, as always, to the heart of him
Harry turned his head and his body followed, rotating on a floating axis that would never let him go. Their chests bumped, their legs tangled, and Harry watched himself reach for Draco’s face, holding it carefully to take it in.
Harry cleared his throat. He had to stop thinking such maudlin thoughts or he’d never survive the week. It was basically a week alone in a luxury hotel, keyed only to let him in — even if he couldn’t quite bring himself to treat the place with disrespect, it was important that he keep filling it with things like vindaloo instead of things like Unspeakables.
It turned out that Lucius Malfoy had been something of a secret dork. They found the game boards in the bottom left corner of the enormous oak desk, under a stack of Martin Miggs comics. “
Call me morbid, call me pale
Harry curled and flexed, tensing then relaxing as Draco’s long fingers skidded over his dark and hair-spattered chest, catching against his ribs and his muscles. It didn’t feel strange that they were touching, or strange that they were floating, or strange that they were pressed naked against each other like fruits on an overripe tree.
He shrugged and followed her in. He’d already been to see the small flat, which was a renovated storage attic, part of Hogwarts’ last-minute scramble to find enough housing for their returning eighth years. It was cramped and askew and homey the same way the Burrow was, only on a much smaller scale. The whole place was the size of Draco’s bedroom, with the bed stuffed into a walk-in closet that was spelled to be bigger on the inside for Ron’s long legs. Hermione had to climb over the open trunk of her books to get to the kettle, and Harry sank into the overstuffed couch. He watched her bustle around in the kitchenette fondly.
“Cool,” Harry couldn’t help but say, watching the tidy piece of magic.
“Why’d you take both wands?” Harry asked, to distract Draco as much as himself. He’d squeezed a lemon over some chopped chicken and veg, following with oregano, pepper, salt, garlic, and olive oil. He wasn’t sure what vitamins you gave someone who had been hiding in a walled-off room, so he’d mixed red onion, some peppers, and a courgette in. There was feta in the fridge: he set it aside to add once everything was done roasting. Everything went on one pan and into the oven at the same temperature: he’d kept it easy, just in case Draco was paying attention.
He was straightening up from the floor, where he’d been laying on his belly for an hour, eating a sandwich and reading the spells woven into the rug, when he saw something weird. A — a
“And sister,” Hermione agreed. “Their going-away dinner at the Burrow is in three weeks, you know.”
Nothing. Although the house wasn’t exactly cooperating. He could feel a resistance in the air, like the magic in the house had been polite so far, but wasn’t about to let his spells reach their full power now. Light started reflecting into his face from the windows, and dust flew into his nose in the owlery, though he knew it had been clean that morning. Determined to force a reaction, Harry took a deep breath and then sprang around a corner to the hallway, wand drawn to cast a Revelio again, battle-quick.
Harry put significantly less effort into the jeans and jumper he slid on after a shower, but he did try to calm his hair before heading downstairs.
“Some Seeker.” Draco seemed strangely upright. He held it together all the way down the stairs, while Harry had to clutch the railing. He didn’t mind, but it kind of hurt his eyes how the bright top of Draco’s head kept blurring into the magically-enhanced candlelight from the chandeliers overhead.
“Fascinating, was this the muggle war—”
“You could try telling me. Or wait, you did that. Safety. Safety, at the cost of your entire life, at the cost of the whole fucking world.”
, and it was everything he’d never imagined it could be,
“Granger, I— I should apologize, I—”
“For fuck’s sake, you
“I’ll dive into this and Floo call tomorrow,” Zara said, shaking Harry’s hand before turning to Draco and clasping him by the shoulder. “It will be alright. It’s going to be tricky going, but a lot of the law is on our side. I’ll have the death certificate overthrown and new ownership paperwork drawn up just in case — I can move faster on that than the Ministry can freeze things.” Hermione had explained the plan to her, how they wanted to keep the home in Harry’s name in case Draco went to trial and stood to lose it. She’d draw up multiple contracts, see which stuck. “More than you expected to inherit in the Manor there, eh, Mr. Potter?”
“The same ones, actually.” Draco peered at him now, and Harry became conscious of the sweat on his forehead and at his underarms from their flight. He pressed his arms closer into himself. “They live a while.”
can’t wait,” Harry threw back. “You said you needed me to stay, but you don’t anymore. You get to be a Malfoy again, and be with all your real friends, not just whoever moves into your house.”
“Where’d this come from? Are there secret hidey holes still?” he asked, taking the bottle to peer at the faded label. Draco actually laughed at him.
When Hermione left, Harry considered asking Draco what they’d been up to, or if he could see the shut-down rooms that had become Draco’s secret apartment. Instead he suggested a game of Quidditch, and Draco seemed relieved to accept.
They’d arrived ten minutes into a nostalgic showing of Casablanca, but Harry talked the ticket-taker into letting them in anyway. They slipped past the snack booth and a series of posters and cut-outs advertising upcoming films, Draco looking around more openly now that he’d had a couple of pints.
“Well.” Draco shrugged, and a look Harry had only seen on him a few glorious times before bloomed pink. It was embarrassment.
Harry stepped back, startled. Draco rolled his eyes and stepped in again, more carefully this time. “Here.” He stuck out his hand, and after a moment, Harry took it.
“You’ll find out if he’s dead soon anyway,” Hermione assured him in the matter-of-fact way she had talked about school, peering into her pint glass. “What with the M- the Manor and all. Saves them a trial.”
“You been watching me?” Harry set the broom beside him carefully — more carefully than he would set his own broom down, without being under Draco’s watchful eye. Draco didn’t answer, and Harry was relieved. He didn’t really like to think about the show he’d given: he was creepingly becoming aware of how weird and antisocial he had been, how naked and crazy. For some reason, even though he was now stuck keeping Malfoy’s secrets, things felt more settled now. Less manic. The exercise had helped, certainly, and having someone to live with made a difference too. Harry had always liked having roommates at Hogwarts, and it was good to have someone to hang out with. Not just someone.
“Hey, I would have told you,” Harry pointed out, offended. “I’m not trying to steal from you. You’re the one who doesn’t want anyone to know they’re alive.”
“I know, but.” Draco pulled his knees up, hugging them and setting the point of his chin into his arms. “Now I’m just leaning on you. And for some reason you seem to like it, but you were right. We have to leave the manor. Do things. Be people.”
“Hit up Ginny,” Ron suggested. “Seriously, Harry, try to enjoy yourself. The war is over, and we’re the ones still alive. Maybe try to do some living.” He wrapped his arm around Hermione, and she tucked herself in tight to his neck. Brilliant freckles and nut-brown skin, his two best friends.
, of course, but it’s a little murkier in the
“Gee, thanks. I just love having my life in your hands.” But the sarcasm belied Draco’s real fear. Harry paused, waited for him to get it all out. “Just another day where Potter can handle it. Where Potter decides who lives and who dies. You couldn’t just leave me with Greg in the Room of Requirement, no, you had to keep me alive to waste away in my ancestral home. Thanks. I don’t feel like waiting around for you to get bored of leaving bowls of water out for me.”
He walked into the newsagents reluctantly. A small man looked up and smiled at the doors’ jingle, warm eyes the color of mud fixing on Harry from between a mop of grey hair and the most wrinkled little body Harry had ever seen outside of a raisin. “Ah, Mr. Potter,” he said, voice as small yet warm as the rest of him, “what can I do for the man who sells most of my papers?”
“You might have to,” Ron sighed. “Bad luck, mate. And there’s one more thing… they’ve paired us with partners already, to train with. I just got mine.”
The buzz and the excitement was cut off in one step, the silence in its wake enormous. Draco dropped Harry’s hand, still without looking at him, and moved toward the kitchen.
In his dreams Draco had floated and flown, had radiated peace and beauty, compelling Harry to be a part of him and the manor and its magic, all in one perfect impossibility. In reality their teeth clashed and Harry was afraid to let his hips land against Draco’s, but when Draco lifted up to meet him the reality was better than the dream, for all of their awkward bumping and aligning and inelegant grinding.
Harry drew away a little, which allowed Draco to smack him right in the face. “Oi!”
“I can’t leave being protective of Draco alone, not when I just got him back,” she insisted. Their voices had become less intense, somehow, but no less direct. “I’m all he has now.”
“What do you think?” he asked quietly, not wanting anyone to overhear as they passed. A family squeezed by them, and then they were alone again.
They sat in the water until it went cold.
“Where are we going? I saw the pixies.”
“Don’t worry,” Harry assured them both, squeezing them before letting go. “I just want to hang out at home for the next year.”
“I’m not?” Dream-Draco seemed surprised. He looked down at himself, chin tucking down, and Harry realized he was naked. His body was blue-tinged alabaster, the hair on it shockingly dark against his skin. His veins showed starkly under his skin, and a path of scars was spread over his chest, glowing dimly underneath the water. His hands and penis were floating upward, nearly breaking the surface, and Harry looked away, filled with a half-woken shame that surprised him.
The bed was a curtainless four-poster, four wooden posts carved into griffins that framed a surprisingly inviting pile of white-and-grey sheets. One of the griffins yawned and turned its head to look at Harry. He stroked its knotted head, and it blinked sleepily.
It felt weird to wake up the next morning, as though nothing had changed.
, though he hadn’t known to wish for this up until a month ago. It still felt like the biggest payoff since Voldemort thudded into the earth, and equally as life-altering.
But now this house was silent.
“You saved everyone,” Draco told him back. “You really did it.” And Harry believed it for the first time, felt his throat close on the panic and the pain and the relief of it, the sacrifice and confusion and vestiges of rotting, leftover fear. He swallowed it, and a little piece of ugliness stayed down.
“Let me eat my sandwich then,” he suggested, but his voice was too warm and teasing for Harry to take him seriously.
“Give me a key,” he said suddenly, struck by inspiration. He stuck his hand out, wiggling his fingers at Draco.
“Because it’s what you wanted, you berk. I was following your lead.” Harry felt himself being plunged back into another argument with Draco’s fear, another unwinnable battle against the self-defenses that had kept Draco hidden away and alive.
Dean nodded, missing the way Harry flinched at for good. “Club Godric! Now take this.” He shoved the box at Ron, who took it and tossed it roughly into the living room. “Nice.”
. Maybe I can come over and watch it.”
“Did you have peacocks, too?”
The Floos were close. People were closer. Harry reached for Draco’s hand, and Draco — without looking over — let him take it.
Draco found the back of Harry’s neck and gripped him tight, apparently unaware of how rough his hold was, but Harry didn’t mind. He ran his cheek across the soft skin and the dark hair he’d dreamed of on Draco’s lower stomach, feeling the muscles there tensing underneath.
“Merlin and Morgana both,” Draco said faintly. “You truly are so fucking stupid.”
“Apparently I am.” Harry scrambled up and rolled his eyes at Malfoy, but it was just to cover his relief. Draco ducked the eaves above the window they’d climbed out of and disappeared. Harry picked up the near-empty  bottle and glanced back out at the sky. It was dark now, the warmth of the day leeching into a preview of the autumn to come.
, and Draco had certainly let Harry save him before, but that hadn’t meant he’d liked it.
to leave. I wanted you to have some freedom, fuck, how is that a bad thing? And if we see Hermione, is that really the worst thing either? She’s my best friend, she won’t turn you in to anyone.”
“Can we Apparate from here?” Harry reached down his legs to roll his pants back down, but Draco huffed at him before standing.
“I told you to shut up,” he said, his voice more strained now. “I know. I thought you weren’t coming back, Harry.”
“You look good,” he managed, after clearing his throat. “Very un-Malfoy.”
For a moment Harry’s heart stopped, and then Draco rose slowly back into view, grinning from atop his broom. He looked brilliant and untethered, free from the walls of the manor and all of its expectations, at least in that moment. Harry glanced below Draco’s dangling feet: the grounds were far below.
“Your owl?” Harry nodded, his throat closing up, as it always did when he thought of her. She’d been a good girl. Draco hesitated, then reached out, giving his forearm an awkward pat. Because his arms were crossed, Draco’s hand caught for a moment before sliding off. It helped.
“That’s one way to get me to shut up,” Harry joked, breathless. He wanted to smile, laugh, cry, but he didn’t know where to start.
“Because we’re fucking,” Draco deduced, and Ron coughed, sputtering until Hermione had to pat him on the back, hiding a smile.
Draco, on the other hand, wasn’t quite sure about Kingsley. But Kingsley was all Harry had as far as someone he could trust in the Ministry, at least until Ron had more power or Arthur dropped his blood feud with the Malfoys. And while Hermione and Draco still worked on the legalities of his freedom, Harry also knew that he would have to work on Kingsley to buy them the breathing room they’d need.
Ron and Hermione started out well enough, shaking Draco’s hand and accepting seats on the sofa, though Hermione perched on it as though the cushions would gobble her up. Harry perched on the coffee table and took her hand, and Draco hovered over the lot of them for a moment before he dragged over an armchair from the fireplace, which shrank a little to accommodate the space he lodged it in, overclose to Harry in a way that meant Harry had to scoot down on the table.
“Shut up, you’ll scare them.” They were approaching the wood now, the house disappearing behind them as the path in front of them began winding through trees. The main drive cut through them, disappearing up to the main gates, and Draco cut left, entering the nearest copse through a smaller, less well-defined path. The gravel faded into dirt, and the trees swallowed them before they’d walked twenty yards. Harry bit his lip and tried not to think of the Forbidden Forest, but he couldn’t help stopping as the light behind them disappeared, reluctant to follow the path into blackness.
“I love him,” he admitted, so quietly that he wouldn’t be sure he’d really said it if he hadn’t seen the way her expression shifted like Stunning spell hit her. “I know it seems crazy, but I do.”
Harry thought, smiling briefly before surrendering back to sleep.
Harry nodded. “I think I could leave soon. It even played music when I was, uh, upset last night,” he offered.
And then, with a pop, he disappeared.
“Are you?” Harry drew his knees up to hide, hugging them tight to his body. Draco mirrored his posture a foot away, turning his body into matching origami. “I know you don’t have any reason to trust me, but I really don’t have some secret plan. I’m just as stuck as you are.”
He’d had a dig through the outbuildings and discovered a shed that operated like the Malfoy larder, supplied with endless magical fertilizers and seed packets that would have sent Professor Sprout into fits. He suspected that some had been Snape’s, or some past Malfoy potioneers. It was everything you could find in Diagon Alley, all preserved in perfect order. When he pulled out a few packets, they snapped back into place, popping into his hand and back onto the shelf in a satisfying piece of self-duplicating magic. Harry, delighted, did it three more times.
“As long as you’re in possession of your wand and using it regularly, you’ll be fine,” she promised him. “The house will come to recognize you as its master over time. Now, then.”
?” He thought about his naked tantrum and covered his eyes, pressing the palms of his hands into his eyelids until spots appeared. Then he pulled them away. “Wait, did you seal off half the rooms?”
uhhh yeah I guess this is just gonna have 103983484 tiny chapters sorry
Harry slid down onto his back and turned his face to the window of Draco. “True.” He wondered if he should apologize, but Draco half-laughed before he could, his eyes sliding shut.
“You’re so slow,” Draco complained. He had opened the window and now stood in the breeze that had wafted inside, preparing to hop out. His hair hadn’t been trimmed in months but was free from gel: Harry wondered briefly if it wouldn’t get in his eyes.
Well, he may as well keep going.
underneath him the way a broom brought with it that giddy sense of flying.
“Sorry! I thought you would block me, fuck.” Draco came closer, touching Harry’s face, and Harry turned his chin away before the other boy saw anything in his eyes… or noticed the beginnings of the erection that was threatening to make itself noticeable. “Are you okay?”
how he wanted to ask her more about that, with how warm it made him feel, but he had to make her understand. “We’ve been talking, and hanging out, and you already know how amazing he is, how difficult and strange and special, but you don’t know me. So maybe it doesn’t make sense to you, but it doesn’t have to. I love him. I always will now, no matter what happens, even when this is all over.”
“Just what I required,” Draco sniffed. Harry rolled his eyes.
He called Luna next. “I think I’m going insane,” he told her, as soon as she popped her head into the fireplace.
Draco just shut his eyes, letting Harry carefully put the strands back into place. Harry couldn’t stop watching his rough fingertips and bitten nails sliding through its softness, the way Draco’s ears and his closed eyelids looked like transparent, beautiful shells. “What do you want?”
had sent through him. He couldn’t keep track of what was happening and what they were actually acknowledging anymore. “We just had a great day, I thought.”
Even Draco had been converted by the waves of leftovers coming home with Harry, and he popped up while Harry was yanking his cloak out from the pillows on the back of the couch. “Do you think she’ll do popovers again today? Dutch babies? Or are there leftover apricot scones?” He was wearing pajama pants and a hoodie that Harry had lent him and he had yet to return. Seeing him in it did things to Harry that he wasn’t sure he liked. He still hadn’t recovered from yesterday’s dreams, but he thought he’d hidden his awkwardness well enough.
“Are you hungry?”
“Did Ollivander tell you that when you had him locked up?”
“People aren’t going to like it,” Neville warned him, meeting Harry’s eyes with his freckle-framed ones. The laughter in his expression had faded, but his eyes still looked soft. “I don’t trust him, and it will probably end badly. But we’ll back you up, like always.”
They Flooed over in two groups, Harry hand-in-hand with the girls, then Ron and Dean with their arms loaded up with the decorations and, yes, some whiskey.
“Fat chance,” Ron said gleefully. “You know I don’t share sweets.”
“That would be a clever thought, if this house had a key. You were so close.” Draco drew his shoulders in and hopped off the counter, brushing around Harry for the kettle. The steam had just begun working up a whistling whisper, and he stopped it with his wand. Draco stared at the wand in his hand for a moment, then handed it to Harry.
you were leaving so—foolish, really, and I just… I wanted to get out and I thought if I could cook or go to the Muggle cinema again that it would help, it might be enough to show you—”
“I know. I know. I know that now. You don’t understand.” He turned to Harry, and Harry saw fear in his eyes, now of what Harry would think. “I’m sorry, I know I can’t defend it. But I was taught the same way I was taught to read and to write that we were better. That we were special, and that there were people who hated us for being special, and that we had to protect ourselves. That muggleborn wizards just opened the door to more and more people who would hate us if they knew us. The Malfoy family has a long history, you know that. Some of us
“No, I mean, maybe. I just need to ask her something, want to come round?”
“Hmm.” Harry studied him. He certainly wasn’t trustworthy, but if Malfoy believed the house would be fine, Harry was inclined to believe him. No one knew the manor better. But if he left and Draco somehow altered the wards...
“Er, just a summary of the last few months, really. Whatever you have.”
“Let’s check.”
Legalwizard Shafiq — Zara — might have been a true professional, but Harry was still in a bit of a daze. The firm she worked for, Shelter & Stotkins, had clearly not cared whether Harry was ready or willing to receive a second ancestral home. They’d called him in, handed him the papers, and scheduled him for a wand-inspection-slash-bloodletting. Business as usual.
This early in the morning, the Manor felt the most innocent, its bushes hanging lower with dew as bees nosed along their flowers. The sunlight was weak but greatly appreciated, and Harry lifted his face to it as he walked down the main path to the gardens. He was surprised to see movement behind a basil plant, Malfoy becoming more visible after a moment, low to the ground. He was wearing his nice clothes again, despite the dirt he was now kneeling in, and it felt strangely right to see him in pressed trousers and a button-down, incongruous though it was to the greenhouse behind him.
She hadn’t seen them yet, and Harry reached for Draco’s sleeve, tugging them back behind the stoop they stood near. Hermione had blended into the crowd, but now her hair was fully visible, along with her trademark overloaded bookbag. She was sifting through the pages of a book now, bustling along half-reading. The sight of her warmed Harry’s heart, as always, but he turned away, pretending to be preoccupied with the grocery bag as she passed across the street. It felt wrong to ignore her, but their disguises wouldn’t fool someone as smart as her, and he waited for her to disappear into the wards before speaking again.
If Draco were free, he could choose someone else, something else. He would help, of course, but something small and anxious had started to burn in Harry’s chest as soon as this new thing had settled between them. In a way, it felt comforting, since Harry had never had anything stay good or calm for long. A part of him had been waiting, was still waiting, for the catch.
Draco looked sick — wan and pale and wilting, like some exotic plant that had been kept indoors and away from the sun. But Harry supposed ghosts looked like that.
“There are a lot of old films we should watch,” Harry agreed. “And we can come back for the next classic they show.”
Harry had never felt that way before, like a caretaker. He thought he finally understood Hagrid’s need to care for dangerous and exotic creatures: it made him feel less rudderless, having Draco to worry about in lieu of himself. It made him feel warm and proud and special, seeing Draco drip grease on the table and swipe Harry’s fries without any insults or fear.
“Purebloods,” Harry scoffed, but Draco interrupted the rant that was forecoming.
“None taken,” Harry allowed, smiling a little despite the tenseness in his body. “But I think Draco and I…
tell you!”
Under the table, Draco’s socked toe found Harry’s ankle, and when he looked back up from his plate, he caught Draco’s small smile.
“I’m alright,” Harry lied. “You?”
“Nice,” he said mildly, and began pinching more dough into place to close the pork pies, Draco only a moment’s hesitation behind.
“If you hate it so much, you may as well leave,” Draco said, voice turning cold. “You have that option, but it’s the only place I can still be a Malfoy. I can’t pick and choose like you. The supermarket is cute and all, but I’m not a fucking muggle and our own world doesn’t want me to be alive.”
The curtains came down with a good yank, and he shook them out over the floor, walking across them as he Charmed them all white. When they were back up they made the newly-emptied room feel more modern, and Harry took his shirt off to keep working. A few hours later, he’d Transfigured all the ornate bergères into squashy sofas and armchairs, changed the walls from damask to dark grey, and turned the curtains into one enormous, stiff piece of fabric. The projector didn’t want to work, unsurprisingly, but he fed it some magic until it kicked into life, spitting distorted images onto the curtain until he used a sticking spell to keep it high on the wall.
“Hmm.” Hermione worried her lip, looking around. “It doesn’t feel like your magic. Still, you’ve done a lot with it, I’m sure the spells will recognize you when you come back tonight.”
He’d shoved all the tables and chairs to one side, losing track of hours and days in the sweat-inducing labor. It felt good to use his muscles, to scrape priceless furniture across priceless floors. He scuffed the wood in one place and kicked a rug over it, not bothering with a Mending charm.
“She’s with Thomas again?”
, Draco was
“What’s my cats name?” Hermione demanded, not relenting. A spark tumbled out of her wand and skittered across the old carpet.
Hermione arrived at half-past eleven, lugging another bagful of books in her endless purse and carrying a notepad with what looked like color-coordinated notes. “Are you ready?” she asked once situated, having dusted off her pants and set her things down.
“What, get all the way in?” Harry peered into the water, surprisingly tempted. Only the thought of stripping down in front of Draco in broad daylight stopped him, the strange frisson between them unable to bear the weight of shirts shaken loose, of trousers slipping down.
He was late already when the Aurors came.
Ron tilted his head and Harry nodded at him, standing up to follow him out the door. Draco glanced up, but Harry smiled at him in what he hoped was a reassuring way, and Draco seemed to take a deep breath before he refocused, nodding at whatever Hermione was telling him now.
“Draco?” Harry sighed and approached the empty space. He could feel tomorrow’s hangover sliding into place already, regret close behind. He’d said goodbye to Ginny, sure, but why punish Draco with a party to do it? What kind of a punishment was it anyway, blessing a girlfriend’s goodbye to make room for another romantic rejection? Thank Merlin for Ron and Hermione, who seemed to be the only ones who would accept any part of the love Harry had waited his whole life to offer.
Draco hesitated, but followed him, glancing at each building they passed as though he’d recognize Grimmauld in the next one. “Mum used to take me. We’d Floo in and stay overnight sometimes, I think especially if they’d been fighting. Is there still an awful old portrait that yells at you?”
The lift started slowing, and Harry hissed his worst fears helplessly, pouring it all out at Hermione’s feet in the seconds he had left before facing whatever was to come. “What if they arrest him? What if they think hiding was a crime? What if we’re too late, what if he hates me now? Hates me more?
He’d been sure that Draco would have emerged from the walls by now, but the place was silent.
A deep, dark humming seemed to turn the grain of the wood floors into crackled, glowing streaks. Upstairs the phonograph turned itself on again, the faraway tune old and jangling and sweet. Harry wasn’t sure how much was him or Draco or some combination, how much was the house itself, but either way he pushed Draco’s shirt up and his trousers down and he went hunting for more freckles to the sound of buzzing, clanging chaos.
“I lied to my parents a lot this year,” Draco said after another long silence. It was his turn to unburden himself, apparently. “I know that’s stupid to care about— I did a lot worse. But I still feel bad about it. Maybe I should have been more honest with them… not about everything. But about, you know.”
“Not sorry,” she said, and quickly restored Harry’s normal features before storing her wand away. “What happened?”
After breakfast Harry returned to a slow-moving Draco, who looked and sounded like he’d been in the pain potions again. Harry had immediately decided against suggesting they go flying, though he still needed a distraction. They wound up thumbing through Lucius’ study, picking through the drawers and shelves that Harry had left alone so far.
“‘Mione!” he was shouting into the Floo a few minutes later. “Oi!”
That hurt too, and Harry had barely glimpsed the answering regret in Ron’s steady blue eyes before he launched himself upward, catching Ron in an impulsive hug. “I’m sorry, Ron. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t let you go be in danger without me, I should just join—”
“Ron. Ticket salesperson. Pounds,” Harry corrected quietly, reaching for Draco’s flailing wrists again. Draco stilled, letting him take them, turning his body toward Harry’s. Their toes bumped together, and Draco’s breath was still sour with stale fear, but near-invisible freckles from a summer of Quidditch spread across his nose and his hair in this light was more gold than silver.
Harry tried not to laugh. After all, he’d been behind on childhood films, as well, hence the movie theater he’d made — to fulfill that childhood fantasy built on peeking into Dudley’s room at cartoons just out of reach. Plus purebloods were weirdly ignorant about Muggle things — and you didn’t get much more pureblooded than the Malfoys. Still, he had to bite his cheek before he could answer.
Harry looked up at him, shading his eyes. Draco’s calves were bare, his trousers rolled up past golden-haired calves and hanging off of his narrow hips. His Quidditch shirt was the same he’d worn in school, sparking a hundred memories that felt like they were from another lifetime. And his hair was sweat-tousled, his face that same face that Harry had obsessed over punching a hundred times. He looked amazing, but Harry wasn’t about to say anything.
Draco frowned, clearly surprised. His troubled expression doubled, and for a moment Harry regretted bringing it up. He hated to make Draco think of it, a day marked by nothing special, alone with no family but the portraits, half-hidden in his own home. “Yes,” Draco said reluctantly, and he shifted, putting some space between them again. “Why do you mention it?”
“The propaganda stops in mid-May,” he said, marking the date with a red-inked quill. “It will be obvious in the
There was a beat. Savage glanced down the hall, clearly expecting to be invited further in. Harry stayed quiet. He was ready to hear what they had come about, and wasn’t willing to let them stumble upon the two teacups on the counter.
“Hey,” Harry said, confused and beginning to be embarrassed, but trying for stern. “Come off it. You disappeared and the house went to me. That means you’re dead.”
“Upstairs, too,” he assured them. “It’s much easier now.”
“Er, I’m good,” Harry offered, trying to sound unconcerned. “Plenty good here.”
“Quidditch, is it?” Draco sounded indifferent to the suggestion, but they both started heading upstairs without further discussion. Harry glanced over as they neared the door to the Quidditch room and found Draco looking back, both of them anticipating an attack from the other. They laughed, and then, feeling awkward, Harry let Draco enter first.
The living room looked just as it had before Harry and Draco’s ill-fate trip into London, the blankets a mess from their movie-watching. Draco’s mug was still on the table, and Harry was relieved that they had shared it, not leaving evidence of two mugs side-by-side. Two days ago they’d been sharing a cuppa, and now the house was as silent as a tomb. He knew without checking that all Draco’s favorite rooms would be closed off. That he was probably already listening.
“Wow,” Harry said, pulling a face at himself just to hear Draco laugh again before he darked it to the same middle brown as Draco. “Well, no one will recognize us now.”
“Fuck yeah, especially after I bring in Draco Malfoy.” Ron waggled his eyebrows and followed him to the fridge. “I reckon I’ll get a medal.”
It wasn’t that he knew what he was doing, so much, as he knew what he wanted to do and he wasn’t at the point anymore where he could keep himself from doing it. He wanted to taste the magic in Draco’s skin, to know the sweetness of the sweat-matted curls that brushed his nose. He wanted to give the best head he could dream of getting, and from the sounds that Draco seemed to be making despite himself, he thought he was doing okay.
hi I just meant for the sexin' to happen and then they got into another fight. but then they made up! ah, drarry.
“You’re leaving, then?” Draco looked more exhausted than he had when Harry had first found him, had mistaken him for a ghost. “As discussed?”
“Yeah, otherwise you’ll just lock me out of here. How do I know I won’t just go run all your errands and be locked out afterward?”
Harry sped after him, and a game of chase began. Harry had been going south across the grounds, but Draco hugged the building in the other direction. He had to drop a little to keep up, and then zoom around a gargoyle that Draco had been trying to steer him into.
“What’s that for?” he’d whispered, feeling undeserving.
“So far so good,” Draco allowed. He couldn’t seem to focus on any one thing. He was still acting as if every shadow was dangerous, not that Harry blamed him.
The Aurors looked up as Harry and Hermione passed by, one of them jumping up to say “Here, now, aren’t you-” as another said “Excuse me, this floor is private-” and Harry ignored them all as he strode past and tried the door. It was locked tight, but he was angry enough to
Another bottle sailed up from the chimney, bursting out in a shower of dust before it settled in Draco’s hand. He coughed, then laughed.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Honestly, Harry, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you liked it here so much. But you still can’t stay forever!”
Ron shook his head. “That’s the other thing. You’ll never guess. It’s Pansy Parkinson.”
Harry buried his face in his hands. He was missing his owl, and Draco had lost his parents. He was hiding from the world, and Draco was no longer welcome there. “I’m such an idiot,” he sighed, mostly at himself.
“Merlin’s beard, Mr. Potter, call me Zara,” she said, smiling.
“I certainly did.” Draco leaned back to look him over, and Harry tried to look more confident than he’d felt. Years of Quidditch practice had fallen to the side, and the months of starving in the woods had taken a while to feel behind him. Only now was flying and working the gardens and fighting or sleeping with Draco making him feel normal in his skin again. Draco’s gaze on him was sharp and bright, but it wasn’t critical. It didn’t seem possible that Draco could be as deep-down satisfied as it made Harry, to have his body against his. Like scratching an itch he’d had for half his life.
It was too late to change his mind, either way. Neville and Luna and Parvati and Padma and Lav and Anthony and Susan and Hannah and Mandy Brocklehurst were suddenly there, loading up the kitchen and putting down beers on the Transfigured furniture.
“Newspapers. We’ll find newspapers.” Draco was moving down each aisle with a speed that Harry had to hurry to keep up with. “Muggles have those, right?”
“I’m sick of hiding, though,” he muttered, so softly that Harry thought he hadn’t heard it right.
“Everyone knows that,” Draco agreed mildly, and slapped him hard on the back. “Let’s go.”
The guilt disappeared when they got to the dungeons. Harry would rather clean a thousand bedrooms than be left with these grim reminders of the War. Each one had been scrubbed clean, which was somehow just as awful as finding something. All that remained was a heavy, horrible feeling.
“Spill it,” she said, before setting about fixing his face.
“So he’s a werewolf with a Time-Turner?” he asked finally. “And he’s flirting with his own mother instead of undoing his Bite?”
“Enough?” Harry’s heart was beating very fast, the whorls of unbalanced magic from the Ministry stirring up in his chest.
“Who’s your partner?” Harry asked miserably when they let go of each other, and tried to blink his tears back discreetly.
“I think you’d turn into a fish,” Draco said dubiously, peering into the water. It was koi-free, but still swirling with some of the magic that had kept them fed and temperate. Harry laughed, then stopped when he saw Draco’s serious expression.
“Oh Harry, no,” Hermione said, her faraway stare focusing back on him. Ron sagged a little behind her, relieved. “Please don’t get all wrapped up in following Draco Malfoy around again.”
Ron went back to training the next day with a new plan, though none of them had total faith in all of its elements. Draco had latched onto Pansy’s name like a drowning man, clearly trusting her over Ron, but Ron insisted that, even if they could trust her, the Ministry still didn’t— some of the comments he’d been getting about Harry involved digs like “
Maybe. Fuck.” Draco looked terrified. It was a familiar look on his face, one that sent pain and regret singing through Harry in complicated patterns.
They raided the wine closet and watched Toy Story, socked feet tangled in one squashy chair, and Luna cried. Then she wanted to make popcorn garlands, and somehow there was popcorn in the cabinet.
Draco glanced away, but when he looked back again, the calm seemed to have stuck. “I want my family back. I want to go back to the time when I was just a spoiled kid and Voldemort was some story my dad told when he was drunk. Barring that? I want my home back, so it can stay with a Malfoy. I want the wizarding world back, shopping on Diagon and eating Elvish bread and using my own wand without someone covering for me. But that takes money and acceptance. I’m dead right now.”
“I’ll let you know what I decide.” Harry tried to sound firm, but there was a bottomless pit of doubt behind his words. Summer was ending and he had to decide his future, at least for the next year. What had happened to the time? He’d spent it all coaxing Draco out of the walls and watching old films, and he’d let that distract him from everything that had felt important beforehand. Now all he wanted to do was chase the Aurors away so he could eat scones and fly with Draco. The weight of responsibilities he’d had his whole life had finally waned a little, now that he didn’t have to be a live-in servant or a student or a warrior or a sacrificial pawn. He didn’t know if he wanted to carry that weight any more, if it was selfish not to. He certainly didn’t have an answer for Savage and Williamson right then. They were still looking at him, waiting, and Harry sighed. “I’ll talk to Ron about it today. I’m was just about to head over there.”
“Of course not,” Hermione answered, exasperation showing around the edges of her voice. “But you can’t lock yourself away forever, people need to know you’re okay. No one’s seen you since your birthday. And this house is still evil, no matter what good you’ve done to it.”
Harry glanced over, expecting Draco to object to being called a boy, but he kept his head down. It was strange to see Draco so far out of his element. Usually he was the brightest thing in the room, but now he was washed out, colorless. He was barely blinking, and Harry knew how terrified he must be.
her about them! I can keep my mouth shut, you know. I haven’t asked why you’ve been using Draco Malfoy’s wand all day, have I?”
“The kind like we’re out of milk and I need to call you? For the last time, Ronald…”
He waited a few days to be sure the rooms wouldn’t come back, but finally he seemed to be living in a pared-down, liveable version of the Manor. He felt like he was rattling around in it less aimlessly, at least. Strangely, the house didn’t do anything about the dungeons or the dining room where he’d had so many horrible memories. He started to think he should do something about it, if this was his place now.
“Lucky.” Pansy considered him, her eyes so keen that Harry could believe she’d be a great Auror, just as easily as he’d believed she could turn him over to Voldemort. “Living with your enemy, lucky.”
“I put a film screen in the Manor,” Harry told her, gesturing at the wall in front of the bed with his chopsticks. “We could be watching something right now.”
“I know,” he said, giving a hug to Ron, as well. “Maybe you can bring me some of that trifle.”
Harry slept in Draco’s room after that. It just felt friendlier, more lived-in somehow, less cramped and formal then the other one. He only had a couple more nights, anyway, so he thought it didn’t matter much.
“Stop that, you’re like a naughty child,” Harry said, swishing the egg clean and depositing his wand back on the counter.
on and they ate in silence. He glanced over every so often, gauging Draco’s reaction to the movie. He wanted to talk more, to ask a hundred questions, but he was afraid of sending Draco back into the walls. He’d just come back from the dead — questions could wait.
“This place is really something,” Hannah put in, and fuck, she seemed buzzing to be seeing Harry again. That sobered him. If he got any drunker he might find himself doing something that would lead her on out of sadness or revenge.
“It does,” Hermione agreed, joining them now. Her shoulders were stiff but she’d thrown her head up straight and Ron slid in behind her, his hand going to rest on the back of her neck. “It’s much more you now, Harry.”
He got Draco started on the dough until he had pulsed together apple, onion, pork, bacon, and spice, then had Draco stir them in a pan while he took over setting the dough in place. “Ramekins,” he muttered to himself as he smoothed the dough out inside, and Malfoy snorted next to him.
“Draco?” He lit up the hallway with another wave of his wand, but nothing was illuminated beside the dusty old carpet and the faces in the paintings along the walls, horses and ancient Malfoys blinking in the new light.
“No one’s saying you have to, Harry,” Hermione said in her most reasonable tone. “But it would be nice to have some path to go down. You can always use your Auror training to go into politics. Or you can study something you didn’t have time for in school, maybe Transfigurations?”
“I can’t tell, honestly.” Harry hovered awkwardly behind Draco, not sure if he should sit. He hated hanging out in cupboards. “Can I help?”
“Only if you mean it,” Ron said, severe now. He was a stickler for the truth, Ron, and bound to it now besides as an Auror-in-training. Harry knew he’d spent the morning in paperwork, and would spend the next six months learning the job. “I suppose you know I’m sworn to the Aurors, and I believe I can help you there, but I have to know that sticking up for you won’t backfire on me.”
The door burst open, nearly hitting Harry in the shoulder. Draco smirked when Harry jumped back, but turned to let him in the room. Harry followed him over to the cupboard, where Draco had piled everything onto the carpet. “What are you doing?”
A little embarrassed now, but glad no one had caught his strip show-slash-tantrum, Harry gathered up his clothes and went up to take a bath.
“Pansy Parkinson? I heard she’s in Auror training,” Neville mused.
Draco had handed him a piece of paper and encouraged him to pass it on to the proprietor, but Harry reached for it as he went in, wanting to make sure that there wasn’t anything evil or put there to embarrass him. He touched Draco’s wand in his robe pocket first, and felt a surprising spark of shame. Malfoy had trusted him, hadn’t he?
“Call yourself a bloody Gryffindor,” Draco huffed. He looked as though he was on the verge of pushing all the pieces to the floor, spoilt only child that he was.
“For fuck’s sake,” Draco said weakly, and Harry nearly choked trying to smile. It was like being given the keys to a kingdom, and he was greedy for every inch of it. Draco’s nose was wrinkled up tight, and he didn’t protest when Harry moved back for air, stretching his hand across the inside of Draco’s thigh, to grip it and nudge it aside.
“Are you using jar jam for a Victoria sponge? You heathen.”
,” he said with feeling. And then: “Are you coming inside?”
His eyes were so, so grey.
“You bring me whatever I want. But I want more than you can bring me.” Draco put his cheek on his knees, and Harry scooted closer. He wanted so badly to touch Draco’s hair again, to fix the mess he’d made there. When Draco let out a long, ragged sigh, Harry let himself.
Harry passed the bottle and watched him drink, the long, cool plane of his neck stretching and swallowing. Somewhere around fifth year girls had started giggling at the sight of him, and at the time Harry had been furious that they saw Malfoy as rich and handsome and bitingly clever, instead of seeing the evil bastard he had believed Malfoy to be. Even after he’d grown accustomed to recognizing male beauty alongside female, grown used to the butterflies Oliver Wood and Charlie Weasley could spring on him, the fact of Malfoy’s perfect face had continued to bother him. It had seemed unfair that someone so awful hadn’t looked as bad as he was, hadn’t worn his dark soul on his face the way Voldemort did. But Malfoy was paler now and too-thin, and all Harry could do was blame the evil of others. In a luxurious manse that was packed with antiques and art, Draco had always been the most precious object inside.
Harry nodded. “He was. But he had sworn to protect you, and he didn’t want you to kill.”
But Draco seemed encouraged somehow, and he licked his lips before reaching for his shirt. Harry scooted forward, splashing some water over the rim of the tub to put his arms up on its edge. He wasn’t ready for what he saw underneath the soft cotton — scars, and lots of them.
The peacock cried out again, closer now, followed by an echoing crash.
Draco nodded. “Far be it from me to cast aspersions on the three-headed dog you’ve always been, but you’re worse off for not being in the couple of the group. They have each other to lean on. I’m sure it’s nothing against you deliberately. My parents were the same way.”
“I highly doubt you can.” Draco gave Harry a once-over, and the dismissive ice of his gaze convinced Harry that he was upset. “Do you have an eye for luxury? No. Can you help me price out my wardrobe? No. Would anyone believe you were selling your own clothing? No. Can you get me access to a Gringotts account? No. Ah.” He found a Sickle in the pocket of another jacket, this one shifting colors softly from green to blue.
Harry shrugged. “Muggles are stupid.”
They all laughed, and it helped a bit. Ginny let go of Harry to help Dean with the box, and Harry lead them into the kitchen.
It was Draco’s ghost, it had to be. The presence he felt in the house, the voice he’d heard. The moving rooms, the missing wand. Draco was still here, in some invisible way, and Harry wasn’t going to let the last remains of him disappear forever. He wanted to protect him, whatever was left.
“I just want to be safe,” Draco corrected. He picked up a pile of silky ties, let them slip through his fingers. “Safety takes money.”
“It’s Harry, then.” He shook her hand and left, shuffling through the packet of papers as he walked down the street. There was another newsstand: this one had Harry’s face, next to a photo of the Manor. Well, no way to hide it from Hermione and Ron, then. She was keeping up with the post-War fallout, sending overseas owls by albatross once a week with her thoughts. It would be a change to have her lecturing him again —  he usually had to scan through two separate political diatribes before finding any news about the elder Grangers, or words from Ron. In the last month, they’d tracked her parents down, but feeding their memories back was slow going. Hermione had theories about Pensieves and spell reversals, and her determination was easy to sense on the page. Harry thought that even if the Grangers couldn’t remember everything, they wouldn’t be able to help but love their daughter and the man she’d chosen.
“Fucking Snape,” Draco said, in an entirely different tone of voice. “Always protecting idiots.”
Thanks for bearing with me during my writer's block! I have a much clearer vision to the end now, which shouldn't take much longer. Love you all!
So instead he did shots with Ron and danced with Hermione and then watched with the others, giggling and shoving, as a bewildered Muggle deliveryman followed their instructions to leave three large pizzas on the sidewalk outside the invisible Grimmauld Place.
,” Draco hissed, and shoved him. Harry hadn’t even realized he’d stepped close again, but Draco’s push sent him stumbling back on the bridge’s slope. So he did what his raging magic and complicated feelings and history with Malfoy had always made him do: he dug his heels in and swung.
They collapsed into a sticky mess of sweat and saliva, viscid come and a loaded silence. They’d traded heavy breaths and muffled sounds, but now it was quiet, and Harry was naked and cold.
He dreamt again. Malfoy, peacocks, caves and cool water. It wasn’t a nightmare this time, but he felt weird, like there was something he’d forgotten somewhere. This time Harry was naked, but it was alright, in the dream it was alright and he wasn’t afraid of anything anymore. Voldemort was dead and he was alive and Draco was… was…
Ron, Pansy, Williamson, Savage, Robards, and Kingsley looked up at once, but behind them, the only one sitting down, was Draco with his head tipped down. He looked like shit. Pale, colorless hair covered his eyes, and Harry longed to run to him, but he jerked himself together and assessed everyone’s expressions.
“You are no such thing. You’re a pedigreed, powerful wizard, with mastery of multiple historic estates, and you could be Minister in ten years if you would bother to go to Auror training.”
“They’re definitely magical, my mum loves these.” Draco was too distracted to correct the present tense.
Cold anger filled Harry’s throat, and he felt the air in the house shift a little around him, cooling. “You just want the Manor to disappear?”
“Harry vouched for me,” Draco pointed out. His hand twitched as though he wanted to reach for Harry, but he refrained. “Isn’t that enough?”
“I cast Imperius to break into Gringotts. And I Crucified someone during the battle,” he tried first, testing the waters. Draco gave him a sharp sideways glance, but didn’t answer. “Carrow.”
“Just getting bladdered,” Harry assured him under his breath, while the others bravely pretended not to hear. They were Hermione, Hannah, Neville, and Seamus, so Harry didn’t mind. Everyone was bound to think he’d be upset about Ginny, and he knew better than to protest too much. He didn’t see Ginny and Dean anywhere, or Luna for that matter, but they were probably just in the kitchen.
Hermione lifted a smoke to her mouth and leaned forward: Harry lit the tip with a wordless spell.
Draco gave Harry a pitying look. “You, you idiot.”
“That’s… a good point.” Harry scooted closer, the carpet catching under his ass and coming with him. “So you’re not dead.”
“It’s a little more complicated than that,” Hermione interjected, though she saved them from explaining how.
“Excuse me?” someone called from downstairs, sounding confused. “Did anybody order from Min Jiang?”
Harry’s scalp was gritty with cornmeal and flour, and Draco had a smear of tomato sauce on his arm by the time they stopped, and the pantry refused to replace the food they had wasted.
“It’s next week. You don’t remember? We talked about it all last year.”
“I’m undead right now. No one is bothering to hate me. But to get anything back, I’d have to face everyone. The Ministry. Azkaban, probably. Everyone who hated my family, or who owed my dad revenge. Death Eaters who blame us for failing the Dark Lord. The fucking Gryffindor cartel, judging me every day of the rest of my life, poisoning any career or family I try to build.”
“No, I just… it just seems like they expect me. And I’m sick of doing what’s expected.” He stared into her steady brown eyes, hopeless to say more. But Hermione just kissed his cheek, gave it a pat, and nodded.
“Are you okay?” Harry whispered, touching her hand.
Their kiss deepened slowly, moving from a touch of sleep-chapped lips to a slide and a press and a slip of tongue that buzzed like a live-wire shock. Harry reached out, sliding the arm that wasn’t trapped underneath him over Draco’s jagged ribs, bringing his hand up to cup Draco’s shoulder, the motion curling them tighter like two halves of a magnet. Harry’s blood was singing, burning, and underneath his hand he could feel a rash of goosebumps across Draco’s back. He slid his hand down and up, under the hem of Draco’s soft, thin shirt, spreading his rougher palm across the soft skin at the small of Draco’s back, where each bump let Harry know this was really happening. He tilted his head, and Draco followed, then broke off to breathe, both of them staring at each other too closely to truly take anything in. Without his glasses, everything behind Draco’s face was blurry, but Harry didn’t care to see anything else.
“How do you know?” Draco wondered. He’d gone slightly blurry, but this close up, Harry could still read the myriad of emotions on his face. “Did Snape tell you? My mother… she thought he was a spy.”
Or was it twinkling because the lights were on?
Ron was going to bring her over at lunchtime, as soon as they had a break in their training, but Draco was up at the crack of dawn. Harry watched him putter around again, faking sleep from his position in bed. Draco was too distracted to even touch, the last few days, and Harry could recognize the signs of a person preparing for battle. He’d been messy-haired and laser-eyed, but today he dressed and arranged himself with military precision. First the robes, which he held up to the light before hitting with a steaming spell, and then the shoes, which Draco shone by hand. Lastly he rubbed a few  potions into his skin and tapped a frame on his desk with his wand, which turned into a mirror. Harry had to roll onto his side to watch Draco arrange his hair back into its strict slick style, which sent a strange wave of nostalgic regret through Harry that was hard to name.
“For cooking,” Draco said, obviously and a little stiffly.
“Spill, then. Let me guess, you’re fighting with Draco.”
Draco sighed. “I don’t know what you’re imagining—”
“You have been working toward this for a long time, Harry,” Hermione interjected. She was leaning on the farthest wall now, apparently reluctant to come back in any further. “Remember all the extra classes you took? McGonagall really did a lot of work to help you.”
Not Malfoy. He’d never felt less like the Malfoy Harry had known, although he’d come to see that name in a whole new way. The ancient, noble historians and potioneers who lined the walls were worlds apart from the petty, standing-obsessed Malfoys he had known. The boy he was starting to...something. Like? He didn’t think it was worth denying anymore, really. He’d grown to like Draco, as a friend, as a person. As more. Even now, with the dull despair that had been building when he thought about what was coming after this summer, getting up to hang out with Draco made it all feel okay. At least for now.
“I love you, Ginny,” Harry sighed, though he didn’t know what that meant.
“Yes,” she said definitely, and patted his knee. “But it’s okay. It’s one of the things we love about you. Ron says it’s what makes you a good Seeker.”
“I went to get everything, and that was fine. I saw a couple of friends by chance, and then I thought, I hadn’t been out in a while and I ought to pop in on Ron and Hermione before they popped in here.”
“Am I-” Draco glared up at Harry. His face was open and pained, and Harry finally saw the fear there. “No, you are.”
“You don’t know that,” Harry lied, ashamed to think that it had once been true. “Why aren’t you asking him, anyway? He’s supposed to be your friend.”
“Me too,” Draco said glumly, and toed the carpet under their feet until it bunched up. “I really don’t want to lose the Manor.”
Wordlessly, Draco did. Harry followed him for a block or so, back past the liquor store, back to the bus stops and metro stations of High Street. It was hard to keep up with Draco now, and he could tell from the sinking in his stomach that he’d pushed Draco too close to discovery, that their day had just been ended.
“I don’t mean magically, Merlin, Potter.” Malfoy set the bottle down, a little harder than he had to. “I’m better than you in lots of ways that don’t involve my father’s outdated ideas about blood purity.”
“Thanks, Nev,” Harry said, touched. Luna nodded her agreement and he raised his stubby bottle of beer. They cheersed, spilling some of Luna’s Red Stripe and foaming up Harry’s, but he felt a lot better for having it out there.
Harry scrubbed his hands over his face. “No. No, I don’t want that either. I mean, thank you, but I don’t want to make you guys share that place. And Grimmauld will be fine, and I love Quidditch. I love you both. I just need more time to decide what to do next. I’m not going to make some huge decision about my life in the next week.”
“I thought it would be fun to hang out in here,” Harry shrugged, and turned to face him. Draco still had his shirt on, but Harry didn’t, and he could feel Draco’s eyes flit across his chest before looking away. From the walls, and in the passion of their morning, he probably hadn’t seen just how many scars Harry had apart from the one that everyone defined him by. He looked back, seemingly unable to help it, and Harry beckoned him all the way into the room.
It really was strange, how much more comfortable he felt with Malfoy these days than his own friends. Strange how not-strange it was. There was no plan here to follow, no expectation. Harry suspected that Draco wouldn’t blink at Harry’s worst thoughts and deeds, could match or beat each one of them. And yet if he didn’t think of Draco as evil or awful or unforgivable  anymore, how could Harry think of himself that way? It was a perverse comfort, yet one he was eager to embrace. To test.
, not Potter, and Harry had said
Ron directed the garlands up around the kitchen and main living room, tucking some around the movie screen while Dean loaded up Dazed and Confused. Ginny poured another round, Hermione corrected Ron’s garland placement, and Harry opened up the Floo.
Cooking together — or teaching Malfoy indirectly to cook — was one thing, but waiting around for dinner to cook was another. Harry cleared his throat and went for the tea, needing something else to do with his hands.
“You also?” Harry tugged, pulled Draco stumbling against him, enfolded every bone of Draco’s body against him like they were slow dancing. The thing that was rotten inside of him had gone, replaced with a perfect lightness he’d only ever glimpsed before. It felt like flying or magic or getting wet fingers into Draco.
“Wh- You can’t just
“I could see a lot of what Voldemort did, by the end,” Harry admitted, ignoring Draco’s flinch at the name. It was hard to believe he’d recently walked the halls below them, holding court where they now watched Star Wars. “It’s why I did Occlumency with Snape, we thought he might have been able to see me.”
, floating in a dreamworld, beside his in a nest of pillows. He’d have to tell Ron and Hermione something. But he didn’t know where to start.
Draco didn’t bother to ask what those were. He pulled his coat on, pulling it tighter around him as he looked around. He was trying to be inconspicuous, but his eyes were wide. With a twinge, Harry recognized his expression— it was the same one that Sirius had worn, right after being released from Azkaban. Muggle field trip or not, this was freedom, and he wasn’t going to let Draco waste it.
One corner of Draco’s mouth picked up into a half-smile before dropping back down. He looked wistful, sad. But he didn’t say anything of the sort, just nodded to the gargoyle that lived beneath the eaves, the one that had tormented a young Draco, yet resisted destruction. It glowered at them from afar, its heavy brow reminiscent of Dudley. “Except that ugly fucker.”
“Apparently it isn’t, since you seem to need help remembering.” Draco turned, Harry’s proximity trapping him back against the counter’s edge. Harry put his arms out to trap him there and leaned in, but Draco put a hand across his face and kept it there, his fingers smudging Harry’s glasses. “I honestly don’t know what to do with you.”
“Good afternoon,” he said to a portrait on the way out. “I know what day it is.” It didn’t say anything back, but he saw it blink at him as he walked away.
“I always wanted a pet growing up.” Harry settled on keeping his arms crossed. “I was so happy to have Hedwig over the summers.”
“Now say ‘my father will hear about this.’”
Harry glanced over his shoulder, searching for something to say. The little plant on Draco’s desk that usually had a rain cloud covering it had cleared, an itty-bitty sun hovering in its place now. What could he say? That his nightmares had gone from dying in a forest to finding Draco dead in the walls of the manor? That his dreams had become lurid and haunting, starring the backs of Draco’s knees and the taste of his tongue? He couldn’t promise much on behalf of the wizarding world. He couldn’t make promises for Ron and Hermione, even, as he’d hidden Draco from them too. He could offer to fight for Draco, and he knew he would, but he’d just turned down the one job in which he could protect him. In the end, there was nothing to say, except “I’m lucky you were here.”
She clasped his hand back. “None of us are,” she whispered back, a touch of wry, horribly adult humor in her voice.
“Yes, very good, now shut up,” Draco hissed. Their feet were touching, and the heat between them gave away how long Draco had been under the same blankets.
“It’s me!” he said quickly, raising his hands. “Sorry, it’s a glamour, sorry.”
and I have every right to be here. As for the wand, it’s also in my possession. It’s linked to the magic of the house, so it’s been helpful to use. Hermione Granger can attest to that, if you doubt me.”
In the end they got beer. The York was stodgy and ancient, and it looked enough like the Hog’s Head that Harry thought Draco might feel at home. It seemed to be working, at least once he’d finished his first pint, and started looking around at people freely.
“Stick to your disgusting half,” Draco advised, and smacked Harry’s hand when he reached for the ham. “You’re such a mongrel.”
Draco’s trousers looked too expensive to be tugged half-down his thighs, and his skin was so pale as to look translucent. But his dick was pink and heavy, and Harry tried his best to taste every inch.
So, I owe you all an apology/explanation! I am LOVING all of the thoughtful comments on this fic, and I apologize for the short and inconsistent updates. I lost one of my parents over the holidays, and it's been hard to focus on any of my hobbies. It does bring me so much joy to write and share this story, though, so I'm not giving up. :) I really appreciate everyone's patience, please do keep reading and commenting!
“I don’t want to be an Auror.” Saying it to Draco, having Ron and Hermione know, made it feel real. Harry felt the truth of it settle in his stomach. “I’m not going into Training.”
There had been a split second, just before Draco popped into nothingness, that Harry had felt something shift. It was a long way from kissing him back, but it wasn’t nothing. It might have been everything, if he’d chased Draco back instead of nursing his own anger in his oldest sweatpants.
“It looks good,” he offered finally, as Draco turned his chin one way and another. Draco caught his eyes in the mirror, not reacting to Harry’s sudden awakeness. Maybe he’d known.
“You were sleeping in there, you potion-huffing simpleton. I didn’t want you to find me.”
“I will.”
He grinned, despite himself. “It did a bit.”
“Well, everything’s fine, mate, no active Dark magic. I’d sage the place though. I’ll send some from mum’s garden, she harvests it at full moon.”
Harry had changed into some other older clothes, things that hadn’t made it to the Manor by virtue of being more formal or less favored. A black pair of trousers that were slightly tight now, a t-shirt that wasn’t one of Dudley’s hand-me-downs. He put on one of Mrs. Weasley’s more minimalist creations, a loose-knit emerald jumper the same shade as his eyes in daylight, and his stupid brain wondered if Draco would like it. What, from the walls? Draco would probably burn the whole place down with everyone inside once he realized his home had been invaded.
Neville nodded and cracked open a Red Stripe for each of them, passing Harry’s over with dirt-speckled hands. “Speaking of which, has Malfoy come out of the walls yet or what?”
Draco allowed it, his body folding forward toward Harry so they  were linked, floor to chair, in front of the fire. The carpet was plush under Harry’s knees, and he was tempted to stay down there, but Draco wound a hand into his hair, kissed his forehead, and tugged him up painfully.
“I thought… but you’re leaving. I always knew you would.”
“You are not Bellatrix Lestrange, and I won’t have you taking on her sins,” Hermione said severely, and surprised everyone by reaching out to touch Draco’s knee. She didn’t drop Harry’s hand to do it, and so there was a moment that she held both Draco and Harry’s hands, Ron’s arm around her, all of them connected for a split second before she squeezed and let them both go.
Finally, seemingly stubbornly, the door appeared. Harry knocked again. “I brought leftovers.”
. Instead he kissed Draco again, carefully, and offered the most loving words he knew.
Then there was a gap between them, and the fear of scaring Draco off became the fear of missing his chance, and Harry chased Draco’s lips down the distance. He caught them roughly, too-fast, and the press between them shifted into something impossibly urgent.
under the headline ‘Malfoy Innocence Tour 1998” and buy us a Muggle flat—”
“I’m not sorry for everything,” he mumbled, not sure and not really caring if Draco could hear him anymore. “I don’t regret— I mean, I shouldn’t have kissed you either, but I wouldn’t take it back.” Harry pulled the sheets up toward his now-burning face, unsure how they would ever have this conversation in the light of day. “I hope that’s okay.”
Draco climbed in with him, one long step of one long leg that brought him down into the bubbles beside him. Harry pulled him into his lap, letting Draco’s legs untangle around him underwater. It should have been strange, to touch so much all of a sudden, but it wasn’t. It felt like the dam had broken, and Harry no longer had to steal a mug or start a fight to get his hands on Draco, something he now realized he’d been itching to do for longer than he knew, for more reasons than he’d ever understood.
“I’ll definitely go to the Burrow,” Harry promised, thinking with a twinge about how much harder Ginny laughed with Dean, the months they’d been together while Harry was sleeping in a tent somewhere. Ron shrugged and got up to buy another round. Hermione rolled her eyes after him, but her expression softened a bit as Harry watched.
The shopkeeper had returned the list too, and when Harry scanned it now he saw one more thing on the bottom.
“Now, that’s not true,” the Minister said sternly. “But the point in question is his motivations. Fortunately for your roommate, Dumbledore and I once spoke about him at length, and I have some testimony from his mother-“
“Where is this coming from?” In the months that Harry had been living at the manor, Draco had never seemed to want to leave. But maybe he hadn’t had the money to consider that an option. “Are you going somewhere?”
It was cramped and uncomfortable and over quick. Harry barely got his hand around himself before coming, Draco’s hand’s preoccupied with gripping and pulling and holding, holding him.
She nodded and stamped something he’d signed, passing her wand over the mark to seal it magically. “As a girl. It was gorgeous then, but I heard about the occupation...” she shrugged. “It can’t look great now. Apparently You-Know-Who kept a werewolf and Dementor army there.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He’d just have to do it. Because he did love Draco, whether or not Pansy believed it. And Harry had spent too much of his life locked up under the guise of protection to do it to anybody else. That wasn’t love. Being trapped, whether in cupboards or mansions, was the opposite of love. And so he’d go along with the plan, even if it killed him.
“It’s fine, Ron and Hermione know now,” Harry said, trying not to sound shell-shocked. “And Pansy.”
Ron and Hermione were in a circle of people around the fireplace, off to the side of another group that had taken over the couch and movie area. Their giggles gave away Parvati’s famous stash of billywig stings, but the group by the fireplace seemed more level.
“My — I switched wands recently,” he said carefully, thinking of the pieces of the Elder Wand, of Malfoy’s in his underwear drawer at Grimmauld. “Will that be a problem?”
“She’s my best friend.” Draco’s fingers tapped a beat on Harry’s thigh, but his face was far away. “She thought I was dead.”
been a while since he’d seen his friends. Hermione was right to have worried, he realized, as she always was. He’d sealed himself off with Draco Malfoy and summer was ending and everyone was going to go on to the next thing. Everyone
“Look at how they stock this. They have to store everything in one place! No Summoning or replenishing. The cost to operate these places must be phenomenal. What do you know about the muggle economy?”
It was the work of a minute to put the package away, and then Harry took the time to feed the koi and say good morning to a few carved serpents around the first floor before looking for Draco.
They paged through the comics next. Draco scoffed at Marvin the Mad Muggle’s misadventures in space, and it took Harry a half hour to convince him that muggles actually had made it to the moon. They ended up back in the living room, where Harry searched his collection for educational films, and settled on Star Wars. That only confused Malfoy more, and he spent the first hour pointing out what technology was clearly magical, and which aliens were based on Ukrainian merpeople. Harry gave up.
“I’m glad.” Harry couldn’t help the smile that broke over his face, and the watery, small smile Draco gave him in response felt like winning the Quidditch World Cup.
“I wonder if they’d say it was worth it.” Draco didn’t say it, but Harry could tell he wasn’t just talking about Lily and James.
Finally, arms stacked with goods, Harry left the damp air of the shed. Enormous topiaries dwarfed the walk up the main drive, manicured English lawn perfectly green underneath. Around the front entrance were more small shrubs, each trimmed into a fussy M. Harry dumped his armload and set to work.
“I’m sure,” Draco said, but didn’t follow that with anything about the barbarism of muggles, to Harry’s relief. Instead he said “Is a Hutt a kind of flobberworm?”
“Like what?” Harry stretched and sat up, trying to imagine Draco with periwinkle hair.
After dinner he went back to the library, looking for something to do. He found a wizarding phonograph and rifled through the ancient records stored underneath. It was mostly Mozart and goblin jazz, with one lone Celestina Warbeck hidden away, sending that same singing regret through Harry when he imagined Narcissa swaying to it.
“You just showed up.”
He picked up the newspaper. Draco blinked, over and over, his face grainy and grey.
Harry had given up the pretense behind teaching Draco to cook, and now forced him into chopping from the start. Predictably, Draco used his wand for everything from peeling to stirring, even levitating the pizza dough from Harry’s hands when he went to toss it.
Oops. That hadn’t been kind. But she seized on it anyway, expression lit up like he’d given something away. “Draco, is it? What kind of relationship are you hiding from the Ministry, anyway? You’ve always hated him.”
“I’m one of them as much as I’m one of you,” Harry reminded Draco, and Draco considered him.
“Have you seen it?” Harry asked, on impulse. He wasn’t sure if solicitors got to tour properties they were handing out to third-cousins, but she seemed to understand what she was saddling him with.
“Like a party?” Hermione asked, her nose scrunching up.
,” Ron added quickly, his eyes lighting up in sudden realization.
Harry, tipsy now and still sipping beer from the bottle, lit all the candles and played You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me on repeat. He closed his eyes, and between the music and the food and the lights, he no longer felt alone. Maybe he could do this. Maybe he could wake the house back up, make it listen to him. Live here, even. There was a savage beauty to it that he couldn’t help but appreciate, as if Hogwarts had an evil twin.
“You could come here,” Ron suggested warily, instead. He was still clutching his trousers at the button, holding them upright. Harry had just started to take in the fact that Ron was very underdressed when Hermione interjected, shouting from somewhere he couldn’t see.
Except, of course, he wasn’t.
“The Man,” he tried to tell his reflection, half-blurred by an unwashed window. “Who Has His Shit Together.”
“I don’t trust it, I guess, and I’m taking it out on him. And we’re both on edge not knowing what’s going to happen. I don’t know, it’s probably stupid. Everything will be okay now, right? He’s different.”
He took out an enormous pork shoulder, and another one popped up to replace it. He picked a tomato off a picture-perfect vine, and another one bloomed in its place. Harry had one bitter moment of thinking how much he could have used a pantry like this at the Dursleys, and then went to work.
“No Legilimency,” he said half-heartedly, But he had known that she would know. She always knew. “All right, a little bit. Maybe. I don’t know but probably. How did you guess?”
The dream hit him and his head snapped to the side. He was terrified that Draco would be awake, watching him, knowing the things that Harry had just been imagining. But he was asleep, eyes closed around some dream of his own. His arm was stretched out across a pillow, reaching toward Harry.
Draco met Harry in the hallway, dressed for war. He’d swapped his Quidditch cast-offs for a suit of black: denim trousers that looked thick and expensive, topped by a lightweight henley that barely hung loose anymore. There was a coat slung over his arm, too, also black. The overall effect was that of blending into the shadows, with every detail polished and menacing in its elegance to anyone who dared to look twice. He had also run a cleansing spell over his hair, and it was still slicked back a little, reminding Harry forcibly of the way he wore it when they were kids. Draco tugged his hand through it again, looking nervous. “I think so. Can you do a Disillusionment on me?”
like to kiss you again, but you have to
The whisper turned into a buzz, but Harry tuned it all out. All he could feel was the cool press of fingers under his, and he didn’t let go until they stepped through the flames.
Ron and Hermione were arguing lightly as they packed up Hermione’s notes and books about the correct way to do so, the background squabbling that Harry could barely hear anymore. Draco had run upstairs to see if he could find a particular deed, and Harry was trying to slip up after him when Pansy caught him.
“Was it a sickness?” he asked, testing his theory since he didn’t know where else to start. All bets were off when it came to the way he normally talked to Malfoy. They were past that somehow. He felt like they were in the middle of a conversation that he’d just realized they were having.
“I’m better at drinking than you. Superior genes.”
Harry shrugged. Ron seemed torn between concern and laughter, but the tense moment seemed to have passed. Hermione sagged a little, then pressed a quick kiss against Harry’s cheek. “You know we love you,” she grumbled, as Ron took her arm to Apparate away.
“Did you go through my underwear drawer?” he asked, affronted.
Draco had covered the stain up to his satisfaction, and was reaching for the sealant. “Which one?” He uncapped it with one hand, holding the broom in place so it didn’t roll and muck up the new varnish. “The twin, I expect.”
He thanked Ron and Hermione, releasing them back to whatever unthinkable things they’d been up  to. God knew they deserved it, even if Harry wasn’t getting laid.
“Well, all right,” Harry whispered, and he reached between them as he began to move.
Someone had brought muggle sparklers into the kitchen, and Lee lit them all at once with an Incendio. Ginny, encircled  in Dean’s arms and nestled against his chest, was at the head of the table. Her brothers stood on either side of her, Hermione looped her arm into Harry’s, and the others crowded into the kitchen, sparks flying between their flushes and illuminated faces.
“Go,” he snarled at her, hating his own tone but unable to spare the seconds to apologize.
“For the
,” Harry said, baffled. “If you’re alive we have to tell someone.”
He didn’t say anything about it, instead taking his normal seat. “I always stop here.”
“Here you are,” Harry agreed, his face red, and turned to Draco. “I need all of you to trust each other. That’s the only way this is going to work.”
,” Draco replied, but the insult was delivered automatically and without heat, he was peering at his knuckles, focused on the Bowtruckle.
Harry was grateful for the wide, squashy sofa that he’d replaced the stuffier leather couches with as soon as he and Draco sank into them.
“Good morning.”
No one had spoken for a few minutes. The water had stopped at the top stair, and Draco had watched as Harry turned back to the top of the cold, black waters. He closed his eyes, and the floors beneath their feet flickered. He’d turned to Draco, who had handed him his wand. Not Draco’s, Harry’s. Harry just took it without speaking, turned back to his spell.
“I think it likes me now,” he was telling Ron, sitting cross-legged in front of the Floo with Pearl in his lap. “It stopped hiding my left socks.”
“Aw, thanks for protecting my face.” Harry realized he was teasing again, and flashed back to his thought from earlier — was he being friendly? or
“Can I?” he asked, though his mouth was already there, but it took Draco’s jagged nod for Harry to give his dick a long, determined swipe of the tongue, following with his hand to twist the spit around and hold tight, to pop the head into his cheek with a showy swallow. He sucked down and his hand moved where he couldn’t reach, a synchronized determination setting in to tease, to touch, and to take him apart.
Harry looked down at his chest, surprised. He’d been so comfortable the last day or so, he’d never bothered to dress properly. He threw a sweater on now, though, and went out to the grounds, trailed by peacocks.
“Coming!” Harry shouted, then turned back to Draco at the door and kissed him again, as quick as before. “I promise, it’s okay. I would have died without their help a hundred times.”
“What’s it about, then? You’ve been weird all summer, mate, and now this? Who am I supposed to go through training with? Who am I going to partner with? What the hell are you going to do?”
“Not anymore, I guess.” Draco drained the bottle and threw it from the roof, winding his arm back to fling it high in the sky. Harry squinted at it and made a trigger motion with his fingers, shattering it in mid-air. “Nice.
“I love you too,” she insisted, and gave his shoulders a shake. Her face was bright and clear and beautiful, her hair a wash of flame. “Listen to me. I’ve loved you my whole life and I always will. But we weren’t supposed to be that way. Only one person can have been possessed by the Dark Lord in a healthy relationship.”
