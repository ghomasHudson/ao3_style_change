Harry looked despairingly at Ron, hoping that his best friend would help him out. Ron gave Harry an odd look but still changed the subject.
But no matter what, he was going to at least try.
Ron bent down to look at Harry in the eye.
“It wouldn’t matter! As long as we have each other, everything would be fine!” Potter reassured.
Hermione’s explanation left Harry dumbfounded, he’d never guessed in a million lives that Hermione Jeans Granger would set him up on a bloody date, with bloody Draco Malfoy.
Draco knows that after this he’d have to leave, leave the school, or maybe even worse, the wizarding world behind. It doesn’t matter anymore though. This year had been enough, the manipulation of the Dark Lord, the Mark, his mission, Harry Potter, it’s too much, maybe he could just run away and pretend he never existed. With his talent, he could surely find a place in the muggle world, even if it meant leaving everything, everyone behind and learning the stupid ways of muggles. When he’d found out the news about his father being sent to Azkaban, and what he did to deserve that, all this admiration towards his fatherly figure had crumbled, leaving him with the dark and empty spaces in his mind. His world had been torn apart in this war, and Mother is worried sick.
A loud rumble shook Harry out of his trance, a wide door had appeared in the wall before him, just like the one the last time he saw it.
“Who cares, but if it is, serves him right for being a prat.” Ron spat.
“Of course no- “Pansy stopped herself, “What did you just say?”
He watched as the Horcruxes were destroyed, one by one, with each he felt the Dark Lord weakening. Lastly, the shock of Snape’s memories, his love to Harry’s mother; the truth of Snape’s past; and what Harry had to do: destroy the last Horcrux—himself.
Draco walked on, hearing the next set of footsteps approach. He was definitely in the right spot. Grumbling softly he waited for spells to come his way, which they did. From several angles. He managed to block several, a stinging curse hitting his arm. He swallowed through the pain as he shot his own spells back. He heard rumbling above him. The sound of tables crashing and people screaming.
After gathering the stuff he needed for his potions, something he still enjoyed thoroughly  even though he had been forced into taking it. He ended up at the bird store. No owls. A common sight here. See. Due to the influences of Norse mythology, they only had Ravens. Based upon Odin’s messengers Huginn and Muninn (thought and memory in old Norse), two great ravens said to deliver messages all over the world. If you got a speaking raven it was a blessing of the gods, and you should only send such a bird to great friends. Malfoy however had learned that ravens were just really smart and picked up certain words over time. But he respected their culture.
“Fine.. Dare.”
Draco seemed to decide against pressing the matter more. “So Helve, you said it would be ok to take Potter out on a trek with one of the therapy horses?”
They got up. Both seemingly a lot happier than before. Draco lifted the silencing spell as they walked back. He left Harry’s side at the entrance, heading back to Pansy and Jackson. Blaise and his partner were missing, probably in a broom closet. The pair gave him a knowing look. “I take you made up?” Pansy asked softly.
It has been nice getting to know you. But it is not safe. It never was and never will be.
“we won’t trust me. And if Ginny tries to change her mind I’ll stop her. Its been 20 years since the war. You weren’t to blame for it. We were kids.” Harry huffed, he was sick of people still holding grudges. When he was an Auror they had the monthly case of death eater hunters killing an ex members partner who had nothing to do with it, killing their kids, beating up family members. It had been absolutely disgusting.
“I was yeah… I love the game but honestly. Playing professionally isn’t for me. I’ve been trying to kind of lay low you know.” Harry rubbed the back of his head, feeling a bit awkward. It had always been a dream of his to join the falcons but he didn’t feel like he had it in him.
“I am staying here yes Potter. But there is more to it.”
“Not asking.” Harry muttered, stumbling to his feet. “Sleep on me all you want but the floor is where I draw the damn line.”
Once at the Inn and getting the first glares from whomever heard his name being called. He headed into his room. “What am I doing to myself. I’m not welcome here. I shouldn’t be here” he grumbled. Plopping on his bed. Skadi cawed in response. “You’re right. I’m here for a reason. I need to get my life back together. Good bird.” He snorted. The dinner was planned for later tonight. He might as well take a little nap before getting ready right?
{ another authors note, fun I know. So I plan on using norse mythology throughout the story. It takes a bit of explaining sometimes. Let me know if there’s too much describing and to little plot and story.
“I understand you may get along for our sons sake. Do not get close to that man. If it weren’t for the healing spells I would still have the scars of what he and his buddies did.” She hissed, oh god she really was pissed off now.
Now Harry was just as confused as everyone else had.
Who do they think they are? Trying to fight him?
He leaned back on the wall, resting his head on the cold wall. Last night was surely remarkable, Draco Malfoy, the ferret; Malfoy heir; Slytherin Ice Prince; crush/love of his life, fell asleep on his shoulder.
Guess he was wrong, again.
Draco tried to think about other things to cover his obvious boner, but it doesn’t seem to be working. Whatever that spell was, it had something to do with Aphrodisiac because the heat surrounding Draco just wouldn’t go away, and the ropes aren’t helping either.
“We need to protect him.”
Just a little.
Finding Draco Malfoy was easier said than done.
Draco, who was already pissed at Pansy, decided to shock her.
“And you’re blind.”
When did he become Draco in his mind?
Hermione Jeans Granger happened to be very easy to find.
Both of them stayed silent until they couldn’t hold it in anymore burst out laughing.
Still, he’d expected Malfoy to be more discrete about this, as it concerned both the Malfoy heir and the Boy Who Lived.
Pansy turned to Blaise and smirked, Blaise returned it. They’d be finally getting rid of the daily basis rambling.
Draco knows everything will change after this, “So how should we do this?” The golden boy asked, placing himself on a dusty table.
It would be nice to think that Potter was worried about him, but Draco knew when to get his hopes high, and when to let go. Right now, is obviously the latter.
“Harry, mate, did you see what Malfoy did last night?” Ron spluttered.
Draco stared at the brunette in front of him. “Is that all you have to say?”
He expected the same warmth to hold him, but the sharp stab of cold tiles against skin snapped him out of his sleepy trance.
“I didn’t know about anything that happened last night, Potter.”
He waved his wand and muttered a counterspell.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck, his mind was blank, what should he say? Tell the truth? He considered that for a moment, Hermione seemed to be easy enough to talk to. But replaying all the scenes of Hermione with Malfoy, it didn’t really seem appropriate.
Harry had just called him a “Moron.” And laughed it off.
A few hours later he was looking fresh after a shower. His hair back up, it was dark out anyway, no one would notice him. He put on his cloak, it was nice to be actually able to wear wizards clothing again. Muggle stuff was comfortable. But it held no nostalgia, it had no familiar feeling and it made Malfoy feel uncomfortably normal. He had been humbled a lot. But he wasn’t a bloody peasant fully yet.
She came back just two days later. Carrying nothing but a small letter in the most horrific handwriting. It seemed so  zero effort it almost pissed Draco off.
Ill be there. The bird did indeed bite. S gonna leave a scar. Thanks for that. Ginny won’t attend. She’s… angry enough you asked.
“Whatever I did went so horribly wrong. They enhance my magic at night, which might explain why we can’t sleep. They should have been able to slide off when I found you. But something happened and the only reason I haven’t … lost my arms is because being closer to you loosens them slightly. Keeps them from tightening.”
When Harry came back he smiled softly. Putting out the stuff and taking a bite out of his muffin.
Draco’s POV
“You’ll do fine. Just keep off the fire whiskey. You were hammered last night and one of us has to be responsible. Clearly I am incapable.”
Draco had seen her. Spoken to her. She said she had an idea but she would look into it. For now she advised to move closer to avoid his core from taking too much damage. She also gave him a small red pouch and note with a plea to the Valkyrie Eir. Asking for her healing and protection. He gratefully took it from her and thanked her.
Since they would have to be attached at the hip Harry agreed to take on horse riding for Malfoy, if Malfoy agreed to come to Weasley night. Which was meeting and visiting with the Weasley family every month or so for a family day. Harry had to explain that despite the divorce. They were basically his only family and Draco with some snide remarks about this being a far greater sacrifice agreed to it.
“don’t you have like a phone or something? To watch a movie or play some music?”
They all laughed it off. Even agreed a date for the dinner.
As soon as he left. Draco went to setting up an altar. He wasn’t as familiar with the Norse traditions. But he decided he would look into it more as he went along. He had his guidance from Mormor, it interested him and the more he looked into it. Their beliefs seemed to fit a lot of his.
“I’m glad you agree Harry. I’ll contact McGonagall to see what can be arranged. The castle would be the safest place. The new spell wont let anyone in with less than good intentions.” Hermoine said, taking out her wand and tapping lightly, soft scribbling from her bag indicating a note was being made on the matter.
Malfoy sighed. “It’s busy. So he might come out to grab a bite to eat somewhere if he is still in London. Keeping up appearances. Ever thought about that?” he said.
“You didn’t put me through anything. Granger told me what happened.”
“Dear mom and dad,
“Fine, Malfoy. Let Harry do your hair. Same as his. You gotta leave it till the end of the game.” Draco pulled a face that could only be described as horrid. “I.. no that is to cruel. I’ll take the glass of water.”
Draco was out. He felt a lot better nowadays and had decided to pick up an old sport he used to enjoy. Horse riding. He had to learn it as a kid because that just was how wizards used to get around before apperating was a thing. His family originally got rich selling the best horses, ones people would now consider sport horses. Wizards horses had unicorn bred into them. they had a certain elegance, and depending on the line bred, they were enhanced in certain things. One of the Norse wizards he’d gotten to know bred horses with certain calming and healing effects. Normally ridden by people with disabilities and or severe anxiety issues. Mainly Fjords, tall fjords because well.. unicorns were gigantic.
“He’s not here.”
“Sure potter.”
Harry took a step back. He hadn’t expected that. he opened his mouth, but there was nothing to say really. He had heard Ginny was friendly with some healer at work.. thought nothing of it. It wasn’t like Harry had given her what she needed. A loving caring husband. Yeah it was… it was probably for the best right? But damn. Damn did that hurt.. She should’ve told him at least.
He wrote a letter back. As well as a potion recipe Scorpius was unable to find but wanted to try out.  Just as he send out the bird, there was a knock on his door.
When Harry returned his gaze to Ron and hermoine, he was met with wide eyes and Ron’s mouth hanging open.
Only when he was home he crashed again. Putting on ward after ward. No one should be able to come near his home now. He was afraid, fearing for his life. He erased every single trace of him traveling there and by the time it was night. He calmed down slightly. Taking a long shower to try and wash off the nasty feeling. The feeling that he was missing something. Something important. He blamed it on not having done enough spells… but he’d have to check tomorrow. Right now he needed to stop panicking and try to relax and rationalize and….
“What moine, don’t kick me I said nothing wrong.” He hissed, looking at the direction Hermoine was nodding. “That’s bloody Malfoy and his gang. Last thing I heard he joined Goyle’s little death eater gang and disappeared of the face of the earth.”
Draco stayed silent, looking at him.
“Sod off.” Draco grabbed the phone out of his hands, looking like a grandfather as he attempted to tap the replay button. Listening to it again. Closing his eyes. “I like this song.” He muttered under his breath. Harry stayed silent, watching him, only taking his phone back to play him another one.
“Dare.”
Harry looked drained himself and agreed without much protest. They agreed to meet with Hermoine, Ron and Pansy  in Draco’s room for some after drinks. Jackson was absolutely pissed and needed to sleep. Much to Malfoys amusement.
I also had some trouble deciding how to continue after the drink night. anyway. Enjoy}
Harry did as told. Glaring into Malfoy’s eyes as he did so. His own widening. “damn you actually did a good job too. “ he hummed.
“Fine. Ronald. Truth or dare.”
Soon enough he got a hand in it though.
So she cheated on Potter. And that made him leave like an idiot.. he should have been back already. Potter was dramatic, but when he cooled down he would have at least contacted Hermoine or Ron right? It was concerning he wasn’t back yet, even Draco found himself getting increasingly more worried. Something must be wrong. Terribly wrong.
“Draco watch ou..” too late. Draco dropped to the ground. Screaming in pain. Another spell silencing him.
After months and months of delaying he now had to.  He could no longer say no to going out with Ron and Hermoine. It wasn’t that he hated them. they just.. they always treated him like he was fragile. Like he couldn’t handle things well. He always felt more like a burden than anything despite their best efforts to make sure he wouldn’t.
“what do you mean Harry. Seriously. You and Malfoy at a friendly dinner? Who poisoned you and why didn’t that poison exist in sixth year.” Ron said raising his brows.
While Astoria knows he’s gay, most people do not. He’s not fully come to terms with it and he’s ashamed, feeling like he’s disappointing his family yet again. There will be a line of how mental abuse affects ones life and how it can impact someone. How hard it can be to keep seeking help. If anything like this triggers you, please find another fic. I want this to be a slowburn and a writing practice. I want to add some harsh reality to a normally magical story.
“I don’t think its any ones fault.” Harry mumbled, carefully running his fingers along the bands and hurt skin around them, trailing down but keeping his hand on Draco’s lower arm. “I think you did everything you could to try and get me back safe and sound I.. hope you do not regret doing so. Whatever I am feeling right now is better than death to me.” He said it, dragging out the words as if thinking of what to say while he was saying it.
“You want me to stay with you? Pansy is occupied collecting her muggle boyfriend and Blaise is shagging half the castle. I’m a fan club deterrent as you can see.” He offered, getting a small hopefull smile from Harry back.
“Does Ginnevra want her husband back or not?”
Draco snorted. “I’m gonna grab a drink, Have you tried Firewhiskey yet Jackson?” he asked, walking to the bar with them. snorting at the literal flame the other spit out after his first tip. “Swallow faster. I promise its good once you get a hang of it.”
“Go drink a darn glass of water.”
“I don’t think I’ll ever get used to this..” Dean uttered, looking at the two of them.
“Fair point. I suppose I hadn’t spoken to Draco in years till he and Potter met up. He’s… being Draco again. The snakey bitch I loved so much. He had bit of a breakdown over what happened but.. It’s to be expected. I don’t think he’s ever been able to forgive himself.” Pansy sighed. “I need to go find Jackson. I’m fairly certain Draco fed him drunk and send him off to geek on everyone.. If I were you I would go and stop my husband before he… he’s skulling the punch.” Pansy snorted.
This afternoon the kids had been allowed to visit him, he smiled at them. hugged them carefully. Apologized for disappearing. Told them to do good at school and how much he loved them. Lilly had bawled her eyes out. Even Ginny had been there. They had a short version of the hard conversation they were meant to have. He forgave her. She cried. He kept telling it was all good and she deserved to be happy.
They agreed to go to dinner with Seamus and Dean jus a few days later. Dressing up in some semiformal attire, mostly because Malfoy refused to wear jeans and denied Harry his right to. They already felt and looked loads better. The bands around Malfoy’s arms were only a little tight. He had full access to his magic again and he was getting the sleep he needed to function like a decent person.
“What did you say that ticked him off enough to make him go away. Isn’t potter more of the let them walk all over me type? Trust me I can take it if it was about me.” Draco said, staring at her.
“Whats that.”
“What do you mean?”
“You must be Scorpius.” Harry said, shaking his hand.
But… here it comes… I got sorted into Slytherin! Like a real Malfoy! I haven’t had to use my scary spell yet. Everyone has been nice to me and Albus. Have I told you about that yet? Me and Albus Potter. Friends! We share rooms and we met in the train, he gave me chocolate frogs. Now I know I’m not allowed to have those because they make me hyped. But this was a special enough occasion right?”
He was seething with anger. So damn pissed off. He apparated them out of pure spite. He was lucky he didn’t Splinch the both of them. They landed not far off of London. In one of the fields he used to go to as a child. He threw Harry’s wand at him , hoping to hit him in the face. “How fucking dare you?!” he yelled, ignoring the overwhelming need to hug the other and check him over. Ignoring how even grasping his shoulder had temporarily lifted the pull of magic on him and taken away the sore feeling after having the torture curse used on you, how it relieved the pain of the stinging curse.
“Second door to the right. Use a locking spell. The actual lock is broken.”
Harry snorted. “that ain’t true. I had dinner with him a few weeks ago. He lives up a mountain in Norway I think?  He’s been doing quite well really.” He nodded at Malfoy, raising his glass at him. Malfoy returned it with the same gesture, just smaller before he got pulled back to the conversation, Parkinson seemed to be questioning him now.
Helve gave Harry a meaningful look. “Almost. Just gotta do the bridle what do you thing, bittless?”
“Don’t worry bout it Potter.” He handed the smoke back to him.
“You’re afraid of dogs. But a giant killer machine doesn’t make you shit your pants.”
Harry stood up, putting a hand on her shoulder. “Ginny I’m… I’m sorry. I didn’t know how much I’ve been hurting you.. I didn’t realise I was hurting the kids with my work. You know what I’ll stay home. I’ll find something like an office job and I’ll be home more.” he said it softly, trying to calm her down a little. “I’ll do better. I Promise.”
{ a short authors note, this is bit of an introductory chapter, explain what has happened in short. I’ve decided to rewrite my previous work from December. I wasn’t happy with the style and I wasn’t in a good space to write. So this is me redeeming that and making some changes.
And he most certainly knew Draco was in no state of mind to be in isolation. To be alone and fend for himself. Harry most certainly didn’t feel like being alone and he at least had people close to him who knew how to deal with him. He’d just have to explain how as soon as he apparated in front of Luna’s house. He was taken away. He had planned on just taking a breather, talking to Luna and clearing his mind and returning.
“Fine, Harry. Truth or dare.”
“You’re the ridiculous one Potter.” Draco cracked a small smile. He was back.
He was very straight to the point, but he seemed relieved with the new topic.
By the time he found the street he felt incredibly out of it. It was dark out, the moon was up high and lighting an empty street Draco faintly recognized. Wasn’t this were Voldemort had taken his residence while regaining his strength? Probably. It was a clever spot really. The big abandoned house in the middle of the street.  it gave off creepy vibes from the outside because of all the spells. But the inside was gorgeous, stunning. A rather classic interior, furniture dating back centuries, way back to when the Riddle family had been founded. Draco, thanks to his dark mark could still enter the building easily. Walking through the wards. His wand ready in his hand. Skadi up on his shoulder, scanning her surroundings and ready to get out to find help.
Harry shook his head. “I’m… what were you saying?” he asked softly. He felt so drained.
“Did you just friendly nod at him.” Pansy shook her head. There was the drama queen Malfoy knew. “Leave it. It’s fine.” Malfoy said, glaring at her slightly. “We spoke the other day, Scorp befriended his son. I had to make sure he wasn’t going to break them up harshly. He’s got no class and Scorpius is sensitive.” He shrugged.
Its certainly been a while hasn’t it. 18 years since the trial? It has come to my attention that my son Scorpius has befriended your son Albus. Now before we both take rash actions and take them apart, which I am assuming would be best to save them from ending up hurt later. I would love to have you and your Wife over for dinner to discuss the matters at hand. Perhaps clear up some stuff of the past?
“You know… we should talk.” Harry started, making Draco freeze as he was bout to take a bite of his toast.
“Harry?” Ron waved a hand in front of him.
“Well…” He wracked his brain for some kind of excuse. But soon dismissed the idea because Hermione would just see right through it.
Meh, everyone has their first times.
“People can change!” He heard Granger yell. He poked his head out a tiny bit. Potter’s back was to him, Granger was too busy staring at Weasley to notice and the Weasel was just yelling his arse out.
“Ah! Nice to see you again Dave!” A dark-haired man sat down next to him.
As soon as Draco ran out of the room, Harry quickly bid his goodbyes to Katie and rushed after the blonde.
Draco acted as if he didn’t care, in fact, the inside of his mind if racing at 1000 miles per second. He didn’t what to say; how to act; or even how to breathe anymore. Everything within him is screaming for him to stun Potter and run out of there with all his might. But the more logical part of him knows that Potter wouldn’t give up until he gets the truth out of him, so why to suffer a bit longer when you can just get it all over with.
(See the end of the chapter for
There was Potter, or Harry, as Draco liked to call in his mind. Even after everything he still couldn’t get that idiot out of his head. He had to admit, that stupid schoolboy crush never subsided.
“I just want to talk you Malfoy, civilly,” Potter reassured him.
Draco made a mental note to never call Granger a mud blood ever again.
The two arch-nemesis in Hogwarts, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, had a big fight, again. It went something like this:
Water was everywhere, the sinks were spraying out jets of water, the mist covered the bathroom, everything was damaged quite hard, but the only thing in Harry’s eyes was red.
Hearing Harry’s suggestion Malfoy snorted, “The Golden boy, Saviour of the wizarding world, dating the son of a filthy death eater? Oh, what news would this be to the Daily Prophet!”
Hermione raised an eyebrow, what could Malloy have said to make Harry all uneasy like this? “So?”
“I got a letter from you saying to meet here at midnight!” Potter said, rubbing his stubbed chin.
“I-I didn’t mean to do that- “
She slowly lifted open her heavy eyelids, it felt like someone had done a ridiculous prank and stuck lead to her eyes.
“Figured out what?”
“He-uh-was drunk, and we talked.” Harry carefully said, taking in the expressions of his friends.
What a smart response, Potter.
-Harry
At the same time, he wanted so much to just rush out there and rip Potter’s limbs out.
Somewhere in the castle, two girls are snickering at their clever plan.
Before Harry could figure out their grand plan, a black swirl of fabric blocked his view and Professor Severus Snape was at the front of the classroom. Soon after Professor Snape came in, the rest of the year 6 Gryffindors and Slytherins joined them.
He had learnt to glue on his Malfoy mask at a very young age, he was told to never take it off, unless in front of the Dark Lord, but Potter was an exception. He’s risked breaking himself once and for all by somewhat agreeing to date the chosen one. But if Potter really was playing with him…
The intrusion was hot and uncomfortable, especially when it swept across the top of his cavern it would always tickle. But the sensation was so new and…lewd, he couldn’t help but let out a small moan, that only enlarged Potter’s self-ego.
“Tell us what happened mate, you know that we won’t judge.” The ginger said gently. But that was the problem, Harry knew that Hermione had a chance of understanding the situation he and Malfoy had both been in during the war, but Ron wouldn’t think about that. Draco Malfoy had bullied the Weasley’s family for as long as they remember, criticising them for being ‘Mudblood Lovers’. He doesn’t think Ron would accept this calmly, instead, what Harry is afraid of is that his best mate since he knew about the wizarding world would use that piece of information against Malfoy and end up badly. The worst thing is Harry doesn’t want to see Malfoy sad or miserable.
“Anyone who dares to hurt our Slytherin Prince will pay for their actions,” Blaise said coolly.
“Tell her Harry, tell her how Malfoy is a disgusting worm.” He seethed.
Katie Bell had been cursed, right in the middle of the pathway, the culprit was a piece of jewellery. But Harry had long learnt his lesson of looking down at jewellery.
“Calm down Pansy, it’s just me.” The person who the pointy face belonged to shush. It was Draco.
It was the break time after potions and Ron had stopped Harry and Hermione at the door before Harry could even think about running away. And now he must listen to Ron go all detective mode on finding out who Malfoy kissed.
But one can still try, right?
Harry had known about the crush those two had on each other for a while now, and he wasn’t worried that they won’t get together in the end. Ron was dense but Hermione wasn’t if Ron really didn’t make the first move, Harry was sure as Dumbledore’s left kneecap that Hermione would.
Draco did not just say thank you to Granger in his mind.
“Looks like you need to lend Weasel here your glasses Potter.” Draco sneered back. Blaise and Pansy both rolled their eyes, here he goes. The truth was, Draco did not hate Potter, in fact, he felt to complete opposite. You see, Draco here had been pinning over that Golden boy for like, who knows how long.
“Ha! Good one mate!” Ron exclaimed, patting Harry hard on the back. Harry should feel proud of shutting Malfoy once, but something just didn’t feel right. Hermione must have thought so too because she looked like she was in deep thought.
Blood…?
“P-Potter!” Draco immediately rose from his seat and stumbled towards the puzzled man, who was trying to figure out who was calling his name, until he saw Draco.
Oh no.
Ever since the war, he’d left the wizarding world behind. He tried the blend in with the muggles. At first, it was pretty tough, since Draco didn’t know anything about muggle inventions, and the whole Ministry was out for leftover death eaters. But Draco was a fast learner and found himself a job at a little shop down the road.
“How?” He croaked, the thought of Hermione knowing about him and Draco all along somehow scared the heck out of him.
Draco huffed and shuffled in his uncomfortable position. What he forgot was that he still had a rage on. How would someone forget that they’re hard? Draco has no idea, or maybe he’s just weird. Probably the latter.
“It’d work out in the end Draco!”
Oddly, Malfoy had also only drunk once. Which meaning he was not as dirty as Harry thought, or maybe he just had more meaningful secrets.
Pansy frowned. Did Granger really not know? She thought Potter would’ve told her already.
But all these thoughts were blown away when a disarming spell was shot his way. Out of instinct, he raised his wand and cast a shielding charm. He backed away a few steps and waved his wand, a stinging hex.
After they’ve had a few rounds of that embarrassing game, Padma admitted that she was still a virgin; Neville had revealed his crush on Luna and was making out in the corner, and Ron had told them that he had Hufflepuff themed underwear.
The silence wasn’t awkward, even a bit peaceful if you ask Draco. Of course, as peaceful as two rivals since eleven can get.
Harry felt like he was drowning and falling at the same time.
Harry shook himself out of the depressing thought, still, if the Dark Lord kidnaps Malfoy right now, Harry most likely will blame it on himself and do everything he can to save him, which will lead to certain death.
Draco can’t allow anyone to take control over his emotions anymore, it just couldn’t happen if he were ever going to finish the mission the Dark Lord had for him.
Draco immediately put down the teacup and the towel, his brows furrowed.
“Then…what...?” Harry asked, even more, confused than before. He knows that even he went and asked Parkinson and Zabini, they wouldn’t tell him shit.
Wow, Harry thought, he’s never going to be able to resolve the hate between Ron and Malfoy, is he?
Harry wasn’t the type to give up, but given the current circumstances, and the war still going on, Malfoy, whose father was still in Azkaban? He wasn’t so sure anymore.
Her quick strides make her seem pissed, but when no one could see her expression, she let out a small smile.
“What did Malfoy tell you then?”
“Oi! Wait Malfoy! I need to talk to you!” Draco heard Potter yelling faintly in the background as he ran the opposite way.
All those kisses seemed so passionate…He hate to admit it, but he’s fallen for the idiot quite some time ago. As previously said, since third year.
If Potter came to his aid, it would be extremely suspicious as they always despised each other. And if he doesn’t, Draco thought numbly, I’d know that’s he’s just playing with me.
“Yes, I know. But he was just following in his father's footsteps! He was taught to be like that!” Harry was also yelling now. How could Ron not understand? It wasn’t right!
Draco lifted his head to meet the speck of moonlight shining through onto his hand that was laid next to Harry’s, on the cold stone floor.
Why do I keep losing my cool to Potter?
Harry had just entered the gates and unfortunately bumped into his friends there.
“I- “
He’d know that voice anywhere.
Malfoy obviously tensed.
It was tight and…
How much would Draco give to make that come true? But disappointingly, it wasn’t.
“Charming Prince? Thank you.”
Not now. He mouthed. And Hermione nodded.
He shook his head, he hadn’t even told Pansy and Blaise about his task, it was best to stay low for now. Or more of it just wanted to keep bloody Potter safe even after all he’s played with him.
Letting slip and lonely smile, he drifted off into the realm of dreams.
Harry watched as Malfoy let the thought travel through his mind, how his nose scrunches up in either disgust or disbelief, Harry dared to hope it was later, and putting back up the Malfoy mask of utter coldness.
“Right! I’m hungry too.” Harry said while half-heartedly waving at Terry Boot who walked by.
Everything was fine at first, everyone was happy and even the Slytherins were enjoying themselves and not hexing everyone’s balls off. But it all started when Pansy Parkinson announced that they were going to play ‘Never have I ever”.
Following Draco up to the third-floor bathrooms, where Moaning Myrtle was, Harry watched as Draco ripped off his sweater, and started sobbing.
“Their feelings.”
He knew he wasn’t going to do anything else except tear himself apart physically and emotionally if he stayed any longer. Ignoring the gasps from the golden trio, he sprinted down the corridor as fast as possible from sight.
Blame everything on me, typical.
“Don’t shove your pointy face in mine while I’m sleeping!” She groaned; boys are such muffin heads.
“I-uh don't think that’s any of our business, I also don’t think it’s right to go public with this Ron,” Harry said, staring right back him.
“Potter, watch it!” Draco snapped as Harry bumped into him down the hallway.
She huffed but obeyed her boyfriend.
Since it was still class time, no one disturbed his pity sleep. It wasn’t until after dinner when everyone came back to the common room did the two other Slytherins of the silver trio notice that Draco was back.
Harry didn’t know if it were him who could see through Malfoy’s acts, or Malfoy is just a horrible actor, but he knew what Malfoy was thinking. Or maybe it was his thought too.
Harry took a deep breath.
A wide grin broke across Harry’s face.
With that depressing thought in mind, he sat down next to Potter, who was already down on his golden arse.
“What did he say?” Hermione asked, shuffling closer to Harry, who was seated across from both.
“You can’t force him to say something that he doesn’t believe in, Ronald!” Granger growled.
“Don’t you agree with me?”
“Ronald understands the LGBT+ community, even Charlie was gay…but if this is regarding Malfoy, then I don’t think he’d act mature if he hears about it.” Hermione frowned. This was a problem.
He’s stuck some night stars on the ceiling facing him, it was absolutely invisible during the day, and only he can see them in the night.
Draco’s legs gave out, he whimpered and fell to the ground, his hands rose to grab a hold of something. Unfortunately, his whole body was bound. He could only pant as he dropped to the ground, trying his best to keep his thighs together and not falling over.
The news would definitely get out quicker than you can say Dumbledore’s full name, and with that, it’d mean that the Dark Lord would know, which meant they would most likely hurt Malfoy to get to him.
Still, a small voice was nagging at the back of his head that it was Draco Malfoy who did this.
“Why are you defending him mate?” Ron accused.
And of course, that didn’t end well.
She giggled and kept walking. Leaving a confused Harry and a scared Ron, as the sudden smile surely meant something is being planned in Hermione’s brain.
He didn’t expect a civil conversation on a sofa with Malfoy and holding his hand.
Pansy Parkinson was shaken awake from her beauty sleep, with a mop of platinum hair in her face. She recognises that hair, she used to dream of inhaling the scent, and brush her fingers through them, but now? She just wants to push them with that stupid brunette.
“Wha- “He’s question was cut short when Draco punched him in the stomach, quite hard.
“So, here’s the plan…”
“Didn’t Malfoy kiss a Gryffindor? Do you have any idea who it might be?” He heard Granger ask.
He noticed how Potter tensed when he sat down, that made him grimace. It meant Potter actually cared about that drunk confession of his in some way, and that is definitely not a good sign coming from the chosen one, as he always manages to get his Gilly-weed wrapped brain into trouble.
Oh? Was that it?
Harry had to ask, he still didn’t know if it’d be a good idea to tell his other best friend yet, since this is Malfoy his talking about.
“What do you plan to do?” Blaise asked, the fire still roaring in his pupils.
Draco was confident in not getting hit by any spell for the two seconds he spent looking at the clock, but how wrong he was.
He sighed. Slowly stretching and rising to a sitting position, making sure that the silencing charm is still effective, he began retelling the events of this afternoon.
“Pansy! You don’t need to be so loud! Besides, I was drunk!”
“We’ve been looking everywhere for you!” Blaise added.
Harry wants to point out that he IS the bloody saviour of the world (not that he’d ever admitted it properly), and that he does NOT walk around Hogwarts as if he owned the school. But in case drunk Malfoy tends to find the urge to hex him before Harry got the juicy information from him, he decided to just shut up.
Dr-Malfoy seems to hate it when others take control of him or the situation.
There are many things that Harry regretted in his life, for example, listening to Hermione’s bloody idea and landing himself in this mess.
With a wary, Draco scowled and burnt the letter, stretching out on the bed covers.
“Oh!” Potter exclaimed.
Spells and hexes were flying everywhere, the sinks broke, the toilets exploded, mirrors shattered. Harry let his magic take over, returning all the jinxes in a matter of seconds. Mist clouded his mind; he couldn’t reply to his brain anymore. Harry didn’t know who he was fighting, of why he was shouting spells, but the only emotion that he felt was rage and frustration.
“You wouldn’t believe what just had happened!”
He watched himself leap out of Hagrid’s arms, the expression on his face like someone’s torch relit itself in a haunted house, an ‘Incendio’ out of his mouth, aiming at the snake. The shock and happiness on Draco’s face when he saw Harry alive and kicking.
Draco turned his attention back to the boy before him, “Do you need new glasses, or can you not see that I’m stuck like this because of your horrible failure at a proper binding charm?”
But he ignored all that.
He unconsciously purred and leaned in more for the warmth that gave him comfort.
“I said I’m fine! I don’t need your pity, although if you could release this kind of magic, I expected the Dark Lord to be gone already.” Harry could make out a little sneer through the dust on Malfoy’s face.
Maybe I should start calling him ‘Draco’.
“As expected from the top girl,” Pansy smirked, trying to lighten the mood. This has been the most civilised conversation she’s had with any Gryffindor ever.
From the corner of his eye, he saw Ron mouth to him:” Beat him to pulp, mate!”
He didn’t know what to do, his main concern was having a proper talk with Malfoy, all the Voldemort thingies are buried in the depths of his mind.
“Harry, tell me the truth. That wasn’t all he said right?” Hermione looked calmly at the boy who lived.
He nearly thought he was going to get away, but a strong hand grabbed onto him. He flinched at the touch because he knew that it was Potter’s hand.
Harry muttered; the last part barely recognisable to Hermione.
So, with a sigh, Draco made up his mind. He can’t keep on sulking like this, he knows that Potter hates him, so he’s got to break this petty little crush once and for all. If Potter invited him, he’d better be ready, Draco sneered to himself.
Draco gritted his teeth, “It wasn’t a simple binding spell Potter, a normal binding spell doesn’t make your legs weak and gives you a full-on boner.” As soon as they were out, Draco wished he could swallow them back.
“Oh, um…” Potter awkwardly pulled back his hand and scratched the back of his neck.
“Why not, you destroyed the Dark Lord at the age of infancy, what can’t you do, Oh saviour of the world?” Draco teased.
“Granger.” She stated as she sat down opposite the Gryffindor.
Was that…Draco?
Reflectively, Malfoy also had a smile on. Remind you, a genuine smile, not a smirk. Which Harry presumes is quite some progress.
Now it was Harry’s turn to become speechless, he’s never really thought about what would become of them after they confessed, would they count as boyfriends? That word just sounded weird inside his head. He’d always expected Malfoy to bolt off and never show up again.
Oh no SOMEONE SAVE ME!
Draco only wanted to drink until midnight and think about how annoying and oblivious Potter is. But the fates apparently didn’t like that.
“Ron, I don’t think that’s the sensible thing to do.” Harry tried to turn the tide.
When he saw those plump pink lips, he just couldn’t help himself. He hadn’t kissed many people before, but this one that he shared with Malfoy was just too different. Sparks went up to where the skin met, and though only their lips were touching, Harry felt dizzy, as if he’d finally done something right, something he wanted to do for once. Which was kind of true.
With that thought in mind, he excused himself from the party and walked over to one of the tables.
“Who’s?”
“You defeated the Dark—Voldemort again, Harry, I think you’re mature enough to know how to avoid trouble.”
Only when he was outside the Slytherin dorms did he allow himself to stop and breathe.
She doesn’t know why she’s telling Granger this, but from how Draco had said she’d stood up for him yesterday, Granger wasn’t that bad after all.
“I fancy Malfoy.”
“No one, now it’s my turn.” Malfoy switched the topic smoothly and put his glass down.
“H-how dare h-he *hic* say that t-*hic* to me!” Draco slurred between hiccups. He often went to this bar, to get his mind off his ignorant crush. Not many people here knew him since he was always under a false name, Dave.
“Hello? Anyone home?”
Draco felt tears gathering at the rim of his eyes, no one’s ever told him this. Not even his own mother.
“I can’t.”
“Potter confessed tonight and now we’re dating. Still not big enough news?”
The chosen one had no idea what was coming, but did that stop him from confessing?
“What are you doing?” Draco had a bad feeling.
“I don’t need you to tell me how to be a Slytherin thank you very much.” He snapped, and Harry could tell that he was about to explode. Just like everyone else, Harry did not want to be in that scenario.
Pulling himself back together, Harry made some promises and bid his goodbyes. He is officially retired from war and death, now he’s going to go get his man!
Draco didn’t care, it seemed like when Potter was with him, everything would fade, into a world only with the two of them.
“It was just a simply duel! How could you two turn it into an invention of a new spell that no one knows how to counter? Heavens above, you two will be serving detention for the next month! Also, since Mr Potter is also at fault, I suggest you two go wait in the abandoned classroom that we will lead you to and clean up everything without wands since the binding charm on Mr Malfoy is very likely to wear off in the next hour.” The old hag had said.
Draco couldn’t find any snarky retort in his dictionary, so he quietly chose to shut up.
“How’s my face pointy?” Draco shot back. Pansy forgot that true Slytherins never just accept an insult. But she was ready for a fight, no one who disturbs her beauty sleep is worth forgiving. Absolutely no one.
Draco didn’t feel like going to herbology anymore, and so he spent the afternoon curled up on his bed, with the curtains closed with a silencing charm and wept like the first time his favourite broom was broken.
“I just want to talk Malfoy.”
No one dared to speak.
Wasn’t he the one who made the first move?
This chapter is for Lillyfox5522 for being the first to support me on my work! Thank you so much, I really appreciate it, and I hope you enjoy the story. :P
It worked, quite well. Harry was approached a lot less. They got some glares but neither of them cares as they got to drinking their usual. Ron and Hermoine checked up on them, but after deciding it was all fine, they went back to socializing.  Though they did have to promise Hermoine that they would be able to find Hogsmeade by themselves later. Which they heavily nodded to, bursting out in laughter after. “Weasley did most certainly marry a mother. I swear. He needs it though. The poor lad would be lost without her.”
Either way, you’re both welcome, next Saturday. I will send a portkey for 8 PM with the bird.
Potter stared at him expectantly, “Well? I don’t have all day for your stupid questions you know.” Draco drawled, finding a little bit more confidence in himself. Maybe he still had a little bit more control over this situation than he originally thought.
But Draco didn’t say anything as Potter slid down the wall and sat next to him.
At Draco’s big confess, Harry just sat there stunned, brain unable to process what his enemy since 11 years old had just called him hot, and all sorts of other things that he’d never expect to come out of DRACO MALFOY.
“Woah, careful there!” Potter hushed as he grabbed hold of Draco’s upper arm, with Draco’s face buried in his shirt.
“Are you crazy? Don’t you remember? Potter hates me, to the guts!” Draco shouted, ears turning red, “Besides, by now the whole school probably knows that the Great Draco Malfoy is gay, and for bloody Harry Potter, the boy who lived!” He ranted.
But why would Malfoy want to meet him in secret after dark? After ignoring hi for so long that Harry was certain he hated him. Only one way to find out. Harry has to go.
He couldn’t believe it, after all this time, Potter was only playing with him.
But you can’t run from the truth.
“Of course, Harry, I know how you feel.”
“Today, we will be revising the importance of a formal wizarding duel, does anyone remember the pose for starting?” Professor Snape said, in the same slow, bored tone as always.
Now he was stuck with some immature but super famous boy in an abandoned classroom for who knows how long. The thing is, Draco still hasn’t given his answer to Potter’s confession, and he doesn’t plan on doing so. And this, he could tell, is going to be the breaking point where he will be forced to admit everything.
Wasn’t the detention they’d given enough? Who is behind all this and what do they want from him?
Draco squirmed in the embrace of his so-called-arch-nemesis, but since he was bounded, nothing he could do except for letting Potter do whatever he wanted with him.
Harry didn’t even know he had these retorts in him.
They stared at each other, Draco contemplated the idea of starting another conversation, but quickly dismissed it as Potter turned to the brooming cupboard on his left and took out a broom.
They were talking about him.
Harry and Ron both panted and huffed as they sat down under the glare of Hermione Granger.
So, Draco just sat there, watching as Potter swung the broom back and forth on the floor, layers of dust flying around, causing Draco to cough, from one end to another. He noticed how Potter’s arm automatically holds the broom in flying stance, how when he sneezes his whole body goes rigid.
Of course, Harry hadn’t told anyone about his new relationship with Malfoy, but from the snickering looks he’s received from Parkinson and Zabini this morning, he’d say Malfoy had other plans.
“Love me so much that you can’t even be in the same room without a boner, Malfoy?” He teased; Harry knew he couldn’t hide his excitement.
At this Potter seemed to tense up, this smirk all gone. “What do you mean, weird spell?”
Frankly, it wasn’t Potter who had cast the spell, Draco didn’t know who, but he just knew that it comes from the audience, presumably one of his Slytherin friends.
The first thing that came to mind was: Where’s Draco?
“What are you laughing?” He stabbed a slim finger at Harry’s chest, shortening the distance that he’d just lengthened a few seconds ago.
“Spit it out then, Potter. What are you waiting for? An invitation?” Draco spat, fully aware that this was not the appropriate time for his snarky business.
“Parkinson.” The other girl didn’t even raise her head from the book.
“Well, he has these stupid emerald eyes that you could always get lost in; those wrinkled clothes that he never irons or changes; that tuff of messy hair that pops up all the place; and those amazing lips that you just want to desperately have a taste of them.” Draco sighed into the air, eyes and mind drifting away to a certain Saviour of the Wizarding World.
Draco resisted the urge to snort. Your saviour seems like he’s in his right mind.
He watched as Malfoy flushed all over again.
Also, the reason I decided to made a sequel for this is because the sequel will be about one year after the war, which is a whole other story, that's why I think it shouldn't be in 'The Drunk Accident'.
“Okay, okay, I’ll let you be.” The man, no, Ethan stood up again and headed towards another table.
He muttered as he stuffed a treacle tart in his mouth.
Perhaps it’s for the best.
“Never have I ever kissed a Gryffindor.”
“If you don’t have anything to say, then I’m leaving, I need my sleep for tomorrow.” Draco turned around, reaching out for the sliding door.
Darn it.
“Oi! ‘Mione! That was my line!” Ron whined.
*That night*
“Haha…yeah…They probably hate him for even touching them already…” Harry felt his heart clench as those words flooded out of his mouth.
From the bar, from Potter, from his emotions, and himself.
Draco groaned; he could tell from her tone that she was serious. Another thing to remember, never ever make Pansy mad.
Granger stiffened. Pansy thinks that she’d probably proved something Granger had hoped was fake.
Potter just chuckled awkwardly.
“Is that enough reason? To save whom I love?” Harry looked around the room.
Time went extra slow, or was it extra fast? Before Harry had known what he’d done, it was already too late.
“Malfoy!”
Tomorrow is going to be quite eventful.
Still deep in thought, but his mind slowly switched the topic to Malfoy, while hie eyes are subconsciously drawn to his lean frame, Harry vaguely notices that a hand shot up next to him.
“For being a jerk Potter!” Draco pouted.
He stood there, for longer than he’d expect, before wobbly stepping out into the corridor, the image was still fresh in his mind.
The windows in the room that Harry didn’t even notice shattered and the slim figure of Draco Malfoy flew back and hit the wall with a pained “Oof!”
Draco bore the dark mark. He was a part of the Dark Lord’s army now, serving under his name as evil servants. There was no turning back ever since that day the blazing pain had scorched his arm.
“You can’t!” Ron yelled.
And so, he sprinted back to the castle, checking on Hagrid half-way, also noting that it was just time for breakfast.
Hermione didn’t reply, but she turned and strolled along the corridor.
He slowly pressed his palm to the door, if the ROR had provided him with a door when he’d thought of Malfoy, that must mean he is in there, right?
Harry doesn’t know if Malfoy thought about what he said last night or not, but he knows as a matter of fact that the blond boy has not yet accepted Harry into his life. As a friendly way.
Draco raised his head and saw that idiot staring right at his pants, and quickly reddened. He thought Potter had already forgotten it, guess he was wrong, again.
“He…well…accidentally let slip that he uh….”
“No, Ron! Just because I have some decency doesn’t mean I’m guilty!” She screamed back.
“Yes, Miss Granger?”
He flinched as Hermione glared at him and Ron.
“Malfoy…loves me…huh…” Harry muttered, trying to get the piece of information through his thick head.
One year later
“Oh, just from the tone you talked about him.” Harry quickly covered his mistake.
“I- “Draco was choking on his own words. IT WAS ALL HIS FAULT FOR BEING SO STUPIDLY ATTRACTIVE! It wasn’t like Draco didn’t want to get over Potter, a stupid crush that’d never work out, but every time he sees him, he just wants to sit there and watch him, drooling all day.
They were broad and fit, muscles ripping through the fabric. Draco always played quidditch but had never gotten such fit before.
After the shock, Harry seemed to adore the idea of him resting on his shoulders, as he hesitantly brushed a hand through Draco’s neat blond locks.
“What!” He snapped, trying to draw Potter’s attention from his pants. But Potter’s smirk just grew wider.
Pansy spotted that bushy head as soon as she set foot in the library. It was deep in a book around ten inches thick.
“Ron, Harry, stop this.” Hermione finally said.
Harry waited for the confrontation. He shut his eyes tight, wondering when the first question would be thrown at him.
“Um…” Harry was afraid, he didn’t know what, why was he afraid? That Ron would spread the rumour? But why was he defending Malfoy anyway? His mind was completely messed up. He must talk to Malfoy.
Uh oh.
As soon as the ropes touched him, the pain was gone, replaced by something…warm?
“I say Malfoy at the bar.” Harry simply shrugged, as if it weren’t much of a deal.
Hearing Draco’s un-Malfoy-ish squeak, Potter turned around with confusion, that is, until he sees Draco trembling, while trying to hide the tent in his pants. He smirked.
“Sure! What about you Ron?” She turned her attention to Ron, who’d finished dressing as they were talking, with a faint blush on his face.
The silver trio was walking to the Great hall for the breakfast Draco had been dreading since he woke up this morning, replayed the scene from last night in his head, told Pansy, who told Blaise and was dragged out of the dormitories to breakfast.
“What else do you want me to say Malfoy?” Potter sighed, placing his face in his palms.
But he did make their lives at Hogwarts miserable for years, he does have a reason to hate him. Draco had to admit, he was a git.
Draco didn’t realise that the duel had begun, but he soon got back into the mode, he shot hexes and spells at Potter, who shielded them cleverly, while Draco reflected or dogged most of the spells sent his way.
Draco spun around at the comment, a scowl on his face.
“Go on, what does he look like?”
Harry couldn’t believe that McGonagall trusted him to stay out of trouble after everything his existence had caused.
“Where’s Draco?” A tall black male stood in the Slytherin common room, leaning against an armchair.
“He’s bullied us for years!” Ron shouted.
Sometimes he’d call out Potter’s name in the dark, listening to it echo in the cold apartment. He wished he could say it to the actual person, but Draco did not live in fantasies. He knew that as the defeater of the Dark Lord, the saviour of the wizarding world, Potter was far beyond his reach.
“Pansy Parkinson, she’s one brilliant schemer.” Hermione chuckled, “In fact, I’m not afraid to tell you, that night when you and Malfoy were in the broom shed? Yeah, we set that up.”
“That’s not an excuse! So now Potter knows that you’re in love with him?”
Harry’s heart was beating unspeakably fast. What did Malfoy think about him? He’s never seemed any other emotions coming from him other than hatred, anger, sarcasm, and more hatred. Harry cannot think of anything else coming from Malfoy. But come to think of it, Malfoy isn’t really the person you’d expect any positive feelings from.
Pansy took that as an acknowledgement.
“Better get him while you can Potter.” Blaise dropped before walking after Draco, with Pansy right behind him.
Hermione was the first to break the silence.
“I assume you’ve figured it out?” The dark-haired girl asked.
“Ahh—” a slim figure plopped his head on the table, with four empty jugs in front of him.
“Yeah.”
“Why would I say such things if otherwise?” Draco managed a sneaky retort.
The next day
He watched as the unforgivable curse was cast, ‘Avada Kedavra’, Dumbledore’s spineless body falling through the air and out of his life. He watched, replayed the scene too many times to count, nothing he could do. Even though he knew that Dumbledore had raised him up to die, he was still a fatherly figure in Harry’s heart.
Draco continued.
“But it’s Malfoy!”
Deep down he knew that Harry was lying, but he couldn’t let this moment go. It was too precious for him.
“I…uh, want to tell you something.” He almost whispered.
He had to do the task the Dark Lord had sent him for. Draco knows that he can’t escape fate.
Draco blushed. A vibrant shade of red across his cheeks, ears, and neck. He’s never been romantically involved in anything, in fact, he’s never really felt loved. It’s obvious if you think about it, living in Malfoy Manor with Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy wasn’t really a great childhood for Draco, or for anyone. The Malfoys don’t like to show emotion and was taught from a very young age to never cry or show signs of affection, it’s like they’re trained to be strong leaders from infancy. Naturally, so has Draco. That is why he never got hugs or kisses, on one hand, it’s the Malfoys-don’t-show-emotions thingy; on the other hand, Draco’s father also doesn’t want Draco to grow up to be a cry baby. It was rare to see Draco Malfoy show anything on his face except for anger, sarcasm, hatred, and coldness. Really, there’s nothing much to show when you have a childhood like that.
And in that peaceful atmosphere, both boys fell asleep.
“Potter and Draco’s.”
Finally, Malfoy glared at Hermione, who was next to Harry, but completely ignored Harry as he went on to glare at Ron. Understandable, Harry thought, if he was in Malfoy’s place, he would’ve barged out of the bloody room already.
Perhaps was infected by Potter’s serious tone, he dropped his attitude and actually thought about it, “Just before you cast the ropes, I took a peek at the clock and I think someone used that time to cast an unknown spell my way. They were definitely good at charms because I only looked away for two seconds.” He added, to make it clear that he wasn’t that easy to take advantage of.
“People can change!” Hermione yelled.
“Oh, he’s*hic* no one.” Draco laid his head on his hand, “Just an arrogant prick that does not know anything other than the fame going to his head.”
He still hadn’t had the ‘sibling talk’ with Hermione yet, since he used the excuse of “My head hurts, can we talk about that tomorrow?”.  Furthermore, they had a billion practice tests today and so they never got the chance to talk.
The memory of the dark mark burned his mind before he could relive that horrid moment, Draco snapped out of it and turned towards a worried Potter.
“I guess I can think about this relationship of ours…” Malfoy drawled, eventually.
“You- “Draco choked on his own words, again. “Ho-how long have you been here?”
A body was lying on the ground, twitching. The mob of blond hair confirms that it was Draco Malfoy, currently lying on the ground, chest bleeding fast and unstoppable.
The handwriting was neat, definitely from someone who was well taught.
“WHAT!” Ron bounced up from his chair.
Well, people thought it was impossible to survive the killing curse, but he did.
“Is that all?” Hermione didn’t quite believe Harry, as his expression showed that he was clearly hiding something else.
So straight forward, once a Gryffindor, always a Gryffindork.
Harry was stunned, the first bit of the sentence seemed reasonable since he never ironed his clothes or gave the effort to tame his wild hair, but what was up with that last part? A taste of his lips? And it’s coming from Malfoy? THE Draco Malfoy of all people? Harry feels as though someone had just turned the world upside down, and Voldemort no longer exists.
However, his gaming mode was ruined quite quickly when Potter agreed with what Weasley said.
The tears dripped down his chin and wet his robes, but he couldn’t care less. Nothing could take away the pain, how his chest ached so much.
“Harry, why are you standing up for him?” Ron took a step towards Harry.
Everyone was quiet, no one knew how to react.
Harry sure hopes so.
Deep down in the dungeons in the Slytherin dorms, a particularly loud scream woke many Slytherins.
“That whoever kissed Malfoy must be either imperious-ed or out of their mind!” Weasley exclaimed, while Draco just covered his mouth with his hand to stop himself from laughing.
He used this time to wonder what Potter’ intentions are, sneaking a letter into his dorms just to meet at night.
Sometimes he wondered was it really a wise choice to choose Gryffindor instead of Slytherin only for the sake of Malfoy, he seemed more suitable for the more ambitious house.
“Hmph.” Hermione pouted; she obviously didn’t believe Harry’s see-through lie.
“Wait, are you telling me you’re hard right now?” Potter stared at him in disbelief.
He saw as Potter looked at him, then Weasel and Granger, Draco could see the hesitation on his face, and he knew what Potter was thinking.
“Was it one of the Patail twins? Was it the Brown girl? Was it Granger?” Ron snorted, “Was it...Weasley?” Everyone shouted ‘Ewww’. But Nott won’t give up, “Was it Potter?”
He heard Potter growl from his throat, the sound sent shivers down his spine, and Potter began nibbling on his lip. Draco couldn’t help but let out a little whimper at the action, but still refused to open.
“Your cute reaction, like how you squirmed under my grasp, and how you have a sensitive waist.” He teased. Harry’s intention, which was to make Malfoy as flustered as possible, was achieved quite easily to say.
Every time when he thinks of the Golden Boy, Draco imagines him being surrounded by pretty girls, it was revolting, but he just couldn’t stop. Because he knows what he really desires is to sit next to him, as his partner.
“Let go, Potter!” Draco snapped, the place on his arm burning under Potter’s touch.
“Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy, would you two mind coming up to do a demonstration?” Upon hearing his name, Harry looked up, aghast, that Professor Snape would request such a thing, to see Malfoy, who was sitting on the opposite side of the classroom with the same expression.
“He said he wanted some space to think, so he went down to that bar he always goes to,” Pansy replied, slouching back in the armchair.
We’re doomed.
“I promise I won’t let you down! I’ll protect you with all my life.” Potter patted his heart, as a sign of promise.
“Well, I’m sure you don’t want to sit like that for the next hour before you could do it yourself right?” A tingling sensation sparkled through his spine.
They were enemies just until yesterday, and Draco still doesn’t know if Potter is toying with him or not, so he’s surely not going to fall for Potter’s worried boyfriend act.
With that, Hermione stormed of to transfiguration, leaving Harry with a very angry Ron.”
Harry really didn’t want to hurt Draco, even if he was such a sneaky bastard sometimes. Whatever Draco is planning to do, he must stop him before the damage that’s too late to reverse happens.
“Duh, what does Pansy always say? You’ve been pining after him for years Dray! Ask him out or get off his case!” Draco mocked, totally unaware that the person he was talking about was right next to him.
This is getting of hand.
Sighing, Draco picked up the new cloth beside him and began to wipe the spilled tea that lad overflowed.
“What? No way! We got to make those jerks pay!” Pansy shouted.
“What do you want from me?” Malfoy glared directly into Harry’s eyes; unwavering heat rushed over both boys.
“Well, that was surprising to know. Who knew a Potter would fancy a Malfoy?” Draco mocked, with his head still turned.
Potter was in a similar state, except for an annoyed expression that Draco was sure was what he had on his face, he was puzzled. Draco waited for the question.
That would just be humiliating.
Which in fact Draco has.
Harry was not surprised this year when Professor Snape, probably his second least favourite teacher—Umbridge comes first of course—became the DADA teacher. There are rumours all around Hogwarts saying that the place is cursed, which lead to not many teachers willing to take the spot. Professor Snape had always applied for the DADA spot, that is probably why he’s the DADA teacher for 7th years.
They swished back to the source of the sound and Harry caught a glimpse of platinum blond hair before the person dashed off the other way of the corridor.
“Too bad.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine ‘Mione.” He murmured.
Meet me by the broom shed in the grounds tonight, 12 am.
“We are not dating, Potter, don’t get ahead of yourself.”
“Harry?” Draco focused back on the person talking.
“For confessing your undying love to Harry Potter. I think not.”
“Bingo.”
He signed for the millionth time this week.
“Draco’s a Malfoy, he’s never had many emotions in his life. All purebloods do that, they don’t show affection, not even to their kids.” Pansy sighed, thinking about her own childhood, “They are really sensitive to things like feelings, that’s why they’re always sharp towards others, they don’t know how to show emotions, nothing but negative ever finds their way through their masks.”
So that’s why they’re along in the classroom along with the three royals from Slytherin, including his new boyfriend, Draco Malfoy.
Draco couldn’t help but groan at the scent of his so-called arch-nemesis. After the kiss, he was always longing for Potter, and that did not make his attempt to cut things off with Potter any easier.
“What? Didn’t like the domination taken all out of you?” Harry snickered; Malfoy looked so…so…. delicious when he was flushed all over. Harry wanted to see more of that side of Malfoy.
Why does life love to play tricks with him so much?
