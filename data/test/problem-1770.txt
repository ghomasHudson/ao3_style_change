Oh fuck it, the future was at stake, plus, becoming friends with a Weasley would surely make Lucius disown him, the quicker that happened the better.
Draco wanted to write what he looked like, but he thought he was privy to at least a few questions.
"What do you want, Potter?" He didn't want to talk; he wanted to be alone.
Draco took a seat next to Harry while Ron sat right behind them.  The classroom slowly filled with other students, some who looked disheveled, probably because they were in such a hurry to get to class. All in all, most of the students were late. And the teacher still hadn't shown up. Trelawney knew they would be late, of course. She had likely given herself a few extra minutes of sleep.
Like Draco, Harry, shot up and started panting. His eyes were unfocused as he tried to ground himself. And then, to Draco's horror, he threw up right in front of him. Almost
"You little-"
"Draco! What did you two do to him!" They were greeted by a very frazzled Hermione when they entered the room, the common room was empty except for her as the rest of them were sleeping.
Rage filled Harry. He began to shake as he got his wand out of his pocket; he pointed the wand at Tom and was about to say--
"I don't know, that's why we're going to do this, I'm going under the invisibility cloak, and you and Hermione will use the polyjuice, you can ask him questions, and I'll spy on him." Harry cringed at how wrong those words sounded, he didn't want to invade Draco's privacy, but something told him that Draco wouldn't tell them what was happening, or he would have already.
Lucius stood over him, "Draco." He drawled and narrowed his eyes.
"She wouldn't believe a bunch of little kids, Hemione." He told her, not focusing on them, he was still confused and shocked about what had happened, he couldn't speak, why couldn't he speak about it? Did he break some sort of Seer rule? There was only one person he could ask about this,
"I.. won't speak to him," Harry said, closing his eyes. It hurt him to think that Draco might really be like Nott, and this was all some elaborate scheme to get them to trust him so that he could blow it up in their faces, he certainly was smart enough to do it.
Draco sat in Professor Trelawney's office. It was finally time for their tutoring lessons. He had arrived around ten minutes ago, but Trelawney wasn't here yet. But that wasn't exactly surprising; Professor Trelawney wasn't known for her punctuality. Draco had begun meditating. He had been doing it in the last timeline. It helped him relax. And boy, did he need to.
"Oh my! What's happened to Mr Malfoy!" Professor McGonagall ran over to them and started to inspect the unconscious Malfoy.
"Dumbledore is out on emergency Ministry business today." McGonagall narrowed her eyes, looking at Draco.
Lucius sighed. This child was going to be the death of him. "Very well."
He said it again, this time louder, and Draco could make out the smallest hints of a voice, "What?" He asked again, and Ron sucked in a deep breath, getting ready to yell as loud as he could.
"Ron, are you sure you know how to fly this?" Before Ron could open his mouth, Draco interrupted him,
"He tried to kill you?!" Draco screamed.
They headed towards the portrait of the fat lady.
"Probably a stray," Hermione said, not paying attention.
Didn't Hagrid hold a shindig for the students at his hut? But that could be one of the things he had done in Draco's time. He still got memories mixed up sometimes.
"A month."
"Hiya Harry!" Ron chirped, and Draco nearly fainted in relief at seeing Harry in one piece, if the Muggles were outlandish enough to put
"I always am."
She fist-bumped Anthony and did a weird series of hand movements towards Terry, which he mimicked. Once she was done greeting them, she turned back to Draco and looked above his head, frowning.
"Thank you! Hermione was already working herself silly trying to figure out a way to stop them from killing Buckbeak. We didn't even think about asking you!" Harry gave him a quick hug. So quick that Draco could still feel the arms wrapped around him even when they were gone.
Draco's eyes widened. "
Something that wasn't propaganda bout how better Purebloods were. Really, there was a whole section dedicated to Blood Purity! It was becoming increasingly tiresome to find some of those books in places where the obviously didn't belong. It seemed the house-elves had been slacking. Not that he could blame them. No one really wanted to step foot in the musty old library.
"Now, you have to register with the Ministry of magic if you become an Animagus, can anyone tell me the punishment for not signing?"
"Yeah, that awful Nott stole Neville's remembrall, you should have seen it, mate, Harry caught it right before it hit the ground!" Ron seemed more happy that Harry had gotten on the team than Harry himself.
"You scared your mother to death, she thought you ran away." Lucius raised an eyebrow.
"She's alive. She's petrified." McGonagall said.
"Hey! What was that for?" he asked, rubbing his skull.
"Master, you are not strong enough." Quirrel talked to himself.
"He's spoken a lot about both of you."
"Hogwarts rumor mill, mate," Ron answered.
"Don't worry, it's okay." Draco continued to rub circles on Harry's back, it was a tad bit awkward, but he could get through that.
"Although I can't guarantee word won't get out. I'm sure you know how gossipy Ravenclaws can be." Lupin tried to smile, but it came off strained.
He had lost a whole year because of his carelessness. He would have to be more cautious, checking all of his things for dark enchantments would be a good start, he could be better, he knew he could. He wouldn't let all that research go to waste, all that planning and even what Potter had did for him.
"Ingredients for the potion aren't exactly common. It will take a few months for them to arrive."
I am really excited for this year, can't wait to see all of your reactions to what I have planned.
She smiled, Harry was listening to her, he had given Draco the flower that she had recommended. She sighed... lovebirds.
going to stay here crying. Come on, let's save Malfoy." Ron crossed his arms.
Draco slapped him across the head.
But how would he find Tom again?
"No one is saying that he will, he does have power however, a power that Lucius Malfoy can not know if he doesn't know already."
"I don't know, we'll think of it as we go along." Ron dragged Harry up.
Draco walked over to the king and yelled, "Checkmate!" And the sword fell.
"You know?!" They said at the same time.
"Yes! Hermione figured it out, but I helped! We know that something's wrong and we'll help you. I mean, what are friends for, right?" He tried to smile.
, the Horcrux will behave
"You think?" Draco looked over at him.
Draco nodded and left the room, he could feel all three pairs of eyes on him as he walked out, the tension in the room still hadn't disappeared, if anything, it had grown while Draco was out, most of it came from Snape.
"I just want all four of us to go together. Is that so much to ask!"
Draco started to stir, holding his head, his face contorted in pain.
It took a lot of strength, but Draco grabbed the Diary and gave it to Harry. "An elf can only be free when his master gives him clothes." Draco smiled softly. It took a minute, but Harry's face lit up when he realized what Draco meant.
"You should select one of the blue patterned ones now," she said in her normal airy voice.
"Oh, Malfoy, you've seen our new brooms, Nott's father gave them to us." He snickered as he pushed Nott to the front of the group.
"Oh, we're here!" Hermine cheered.
empty.
Draco ran out of the bathroom. Hermione had his book.
Narcissa Malfoy sat in her living room, still in shock from the letter she had just written. A part of her was gaping at the fact that she had just granted permission for a
Potter was looking at him, and Draco was suddenly aware of how unnaturally green Potter's eyes were, how much pigmentation did the boy have? Draco felt his cheeks getting hot, but he didn't know why, he wasn't embarassed, was he? Draco cleared his throat, trying to break the awkward eye contact.
An elf with green eyes appeared instantly, it bowed and whispered in a shaky voice, "Yes Madam Malfoy?"
"You haven't even had a small vision, a flash?" Professor Trelawney looked pale.
Tom wrote, and Draco's eyes started to flutter shut.
Draco owed him so much.
"I've told yeh, Snape had nothing ter do with this, he doesn't even know how to calm Fluffy down, he never did like classical music!" Hagrid seemed dead set on defending Snape's honor, while Hermione was still trying to keep him quiet, she never did know when things were hopeless.
Draco hesitated for a moment, "Thank you, father."
"Do you have any idea how serious this is?" He put down the newspaper and glared at Draco in particular, Draco looked back at him, or at least, the one that he thought was him,
He wouldn't use the
Hermione, however, wasn't backing down, "It is! How are we supposed to get good grades in the subject if we can't study?"
The basilisk recovered quickly and Fawkes flew over away, dropping something while leaving. Well, Harry didn't know if Fawkes left; he was a bit focused on the snake.
Speedwalking over to Potter, Draco started to do what he thought would calm him down, rubbing his back and whispering in his ear, like his mother had done for him when he had nightmares,
Draco nodded and calmed himself down, he waited for a bit and then he left the room without saying goodbye to Flitwick.
"Myrtle! You didn't happen to see a... a book, did you?" Draco was acutely aware of how desperate his voice sounded.
The mood in the Transfiguration classroom was somber. Everyone who had come from Divination seemed to have a permanent frown on their face. Hermione was scowling while Ron kept on shooting Harry piteous glances. Harry was the worst of all, however. His mood had soured and every attempt at magic seemed to be going wrong for him. Draco tried his best to help his friend but even he could only do so much when a Wizard's emotions were running so high.
He dug into his backpack, looking for one of the books he had bought from Flourish and Botts. It was a new theory about Prophecies from a former Unspeakable, Arianna Smith.
"You can't stand not knowing things, and you do anything to make sure that you know the truth, but the flaw is that you don't trust anyone but yourself, well, you did trust me before, but that was broken when you realized that I had secrets, so, you use Legilimency to get the truth." Draco answered, there was no point in holding back, he was mad at Snape, Draco wasn't an eleven year old in mind, he knew that he was allowed to have his own secrets.
"That's disgusting." He whined, looking at Hermione, then he noticed his surroundings, looking around, he asked,
His Sixth year was full of sadness and stress, but he had never felt so mad at someone. It was uncontrollable. Yes, he had almost
Potter however, was starting to confuse him, he was looking at him differently, and he was acting all shy, Draco was confused by his behavior, and he didn't like being confused, he would have to add 'find out what's wrong with Potter' to his to-do-list.
"Of course, Anthony. But I swear that I won't let anything bad happen to you guys. You're my friends." It was one of the rare times Terry could see such an earnest expression from Draco. Make no mistake: Draco was never cold with them. But he wasn't as open as he was with his Gryffindor friends.
Myrtle seemed to notice it too, given how she giggled. "The same book that you flushed down the toilet, that was awfully rude you know!" she berated him.
"You're freezing!" He exclaimed and rushed him over to the lit fireplace. It was no use, he wouldn't feel warmer. He had given up on feeling warmer a few hours ago.
******************
"Sorry mate, but we don't have enough room for all of you back there, you're gonna need to sit on Harry's lap."
"Me," said Harry, with an air around him that screamed,
Hermione looked at him, ready to say something, but before she could, Ron said something. "I know, there's something super wrong with Draco..." He still looked guilty and kept his gaze on the floor.
"No, I fashioned myself a new name, a name that I knew every wizard would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world." His eyes had a red tint to them as his voice became louder and louder.
Draco shoved the door closed and flinched away as the keys made holes in the wood, barely there, but noticeable.
Draco sat down and pushed himself up against Harry, wanting the cold feeling to go away. And Harry pushed back, probably wanting to feel the same. They both dug into their chocolate, Hermione and Ron slower than them.
And just like he had predicted, a few of the upper Ravenclaws had started giving him dirty looks, that was the thing, they were all obsorbed in soaking up as much knowledge as they possibly could, they didn't focus on much else.
But it wasn't Draco. She didn't know what it was, but it wasn't Draco.
"Did you bring the invisibility cloak?" Ron asked.
Just because something's abnormal doesn't mean it's wrong-
Draco scrunched up his face, he looked like he was in pain, he held his hair with one of his hands, grunting in pain, "Draco?" Harry said, he was worried and didn't care what Ron or Hermione said to him anymore.
"Don't forget who actually found the thing!" Ron squawked. Hermione laughed, putting a hand on his shoulder.
Hermione snatched the book out of his hands, immediately spotting a flaw in the theory. "It says that the Basilisk will
Draco was sitting with Terry, Anthony and Luna, talking about miscellaneous topics, when Nott entered the Great Hall. Draco knew when Nott entered because Terry nudged him with his elbow (with far too much force in Draco's opinion). Draco looked up to see almost everyone at the Gryffindor and, surprisingly, Hufflepuff table glaring at Nott. It looked like a lot of people cared about Hagrid.
Draco opened his mouth and then closed it. Severus caught the movement.
It was completely different, seeing things from an outsider's perspective. He felt... detached, in a sort of way. He knew that he had been like that, but it hadn't sunk in yet. That he had been awful. All that anger whenever Nott insulted one of his friends or called Hermione that awful slur had been the same anger Potter had felt on Malfoy all those years ago.
Luna put a finger under her chin. "Hmm. I would have to ask the Moon Frogs about the treaty between the Flobberworms, but I know that Nargles and Flobberworms are extremely friendly with each other. Trust me, the only time they were less than friendly was when the...
He seemed surprised for a moment, but only for a moment. He unsheathed his wand and cast a
A teardrop hit the page, and it faded.
"Lovey Doveys?" Draco questioned.
McGonagall sighed but said the password. "Sherbert Lemon."
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. "Sometimes you two act too much like the Weasley twins."
"Not right now," He said quietly.
"Professor Quirrell." Harry breathed out, looking at the man in betrayal.
He was speechless. He hadn't expected Terry to care this much about him.
"'Arry! Ron! Why's Hermione crying?" Hermione looked up, trying to explain, but just ended up crying harder, she put her head on her knees and continued to sob.
Draco hesitated for a moment, he probably shouldn't tell Tom that he was a time traveller, he should wait until he was back in his dorm, but what could happen, he should tell Tom now.
Harry aimed his wand behind his back and yelled,
"There," Ron whispered.
Draco still had the book in his hand, he ran through his dorm. Where could he get rid of the book? The bathroom, no one used Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, that was why Draco had gone there so much in his sixth year. He could get rid of it there, maybe he could flush it down the toilet? Crude, but it could work.
Now that I'm done with excuses, you can read this chapter.
And he felt better.
He wobbled to his feet and staggered to his trunk, picking it up as Harry and Ron chased after the car, apparently it was going into the dark forest.
"Where are you going?" Dean asked in suspicion right as they were about to leave.
"Harry…" Ron croaked out and Tom focused on him.
Harry looked at him, confused. "What about it?"
it's victims."
A self-satisfied air surrounded McGonagall, like it normally did with Hermione when she had gotten an answer right or when she had gotten them house points.
Draco quickly launched into a lecture. And his thoughts were turned away from what he had been thinking about.
"How are we going to get to Hogwarts?" Harry looked absolutely crushed, no doubt his mind was going into overdrive, and for once, Draco was stumped, how would they get to Hog-
"What English word has three consecutive double letters?" The Eagle asked.
"No?" He looked between both of them.
Draco gasped. "Dobby was behind the Bludger?" he said, mostly to himself.
The only thing that he could make sense of was that he missed Tom, and he didn't know why. He knew that Tom was most likely the reason he had called Hermione that word; but was he really that bad? Maybe Tom was like him, a boy who had thought that he was above others because of his blood. Maybe he could convince Tom that he wasn't above them?
Draco stood outside Dumbledore's office, he had been instructed to come here before any of his classes.
He looked up at his mentor to see her smiling widely.
Myrtle giggled. "That brown-haired girl took it."
Hermione elbowed him and Draco turned to look at her, "And good job with the Devil's Snare, Hermione." He nodded.
Draco quickly lost that train of thought. He wouldn't think about that disastrous year until the mysteries surrounding this one were gone.
"The sixth month." Albus finished for him.
"These grades are satisfactory at best, I don't see why you're showing me this, Narcissa, he is still in Ravenclaw." Lucius ground out, and Draco scoffed in his head, he would never be satisfied, Draco hadn't tried his best because he didn't want to look like a prodigy, he liked the attention, yes, but too much of it would get in his way.
" There was such pain in his voice, that Draco cringed, he
"Alright, keep the boy here, once he wakes up, give him this." Poppy handed him a white glowing potion.
And so, when the day to go to Diagon Alley finally arrived, everyone in the Malfoy household - even the house-elves - breathed a gigantic sigh of relief. Lucius had given Draco an even larger amount of money than usual. After all, the man had too much pride to simply apologize.
It leapt forward and Harry thrust the sword forward.
She only just caught Draco leaving. She left the common room and tailed Draco as he walked down the hallway. She didn't know where he was going. He turned multiple times, but he didn't look lost, walking with purpose confidently. He held his chin up high and the eerie grin never left his face.
"Pardon?" He tilted his head, he didn't know what they were talking about, he had said something about Harry, he had seen Harry doing something?
"Come on, we're going to be late!" Draco yelled as Harry and Ron struggled to keep up with them, he didn't know how they had been so late, but they had and he was currently zooming across the train station to get to the entrance, he would be dammed if he didn't get on the train.
"Anything else?" Snape asked this time.
"You must leave-" He cut himself off when his eyes landed on Draco.
Tom ignored him. "How is it that a baby with absolutely no magical talent managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort?" His voice had lost its amused tint and was now filled with rage as well as dark curiosity.
Sure, he had a fear of failure but this boggart wasn't even fully grown. If this was what his fear looked like now, what would it look like with an adult boggart?
"-But Dobby's free!" Harry smiled shyly, trying to temper Draco's anger.
"Draco!" He heard someone call his name, but he was still stuck there, stunned by the realization.
"Mr Malfoy, what's happened?" Snape came up to them, and Harry opened his mouth, ready to answer, but was cut off by Snape.
Draco gave her a questioning look, but he wasn't weirded out. They had all gotten used to Luna's tendencies. Anthony laughed to himself and nudged Terry in the rib. He let out a little 'oof' but returned that mysterious smile. Draco felt like he was missing something.
"What if they didn't look directly at it?" Draco questioned and Hermione's eyes widened.
knew where the Divination classroom was, but they didn't know that. After all, it would look odd if he knew where the classroom of a subject that the rest didn't even know existed was. Well, they had never heard of the subject until about a day ago, when they first got their schedules.
His eyes felt heavy.
"Because I've answered all the other ones I think, they are fun though." He tried to remain as childish as possible.
"Draco, follow me." He commanded.
"Potter?" He rubbed his eyes, that was a Potter shaped blurb.
On the front, right at the bottom, it read, Tom Marvolo Riddle.
"I don't know, but that's what we've gotta find out. Your invisibility cloak," Ron said suddenly.
"Yeah, you seem to really like the Professor," Harry chimed in before eating a spoon of potatoes.
Draco supposed that made sense, he would have to look into that, Tom always gave him the most interesting things to think about. Draco yawned, suddenly sleepy.
"Where the punishment for failure could be expulsion," Luna said breezily.
"Harry, are you alright?" Ron asked in alarm, concern written on his face.
"Hey, mate." Someone called out and Draco groaned; didn't they see he was trying to sleep?
"Sorry," he mumbled.
Flitwick was looking at him in confusion, as well as fascination, "Your words were not your own?" He inquired.
A witch came up to them, "Lost?" She leered.
The world went black.
"I don't know." Draco tilted his head slightly, thinking it over in his head. If he remembered correctly, Harry hadn't gone to Hogsmeade last time. He grimaced at the reminder of his first Hogsmeade. That was a weekend he would never forget, if only for the sheer embarrassment that had accompanied it.
And then, another vision, this time of Quirrel yearning for power, yearning to prove himself better than those who had mocked him, yearning to be taught by The Dark Lord, to achieve the level of power that he had.
Speaking of sleeping, he didn't feel energized at all, he felt more tired. He yawned again, looking for the diary, it had been moved as well, who had come in his room? He grabbed the book from where it was now resting at the windowsill.
"You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, and I won't breathe a word of it to the headmaster,"
"Yes, Hagrid's always been quite curious about the creatures Luna sees."
"That's why he looks so awful! He fainted and then that... thing took him over. Merlin, what type of friends are we?" Her vision blurred and she sat down on the couch in front of the fireplace.
It was a habit of seven years, it was pretty hard to get rid of.
Finally, the boggart seemed to settle on something, Draco raised his wand and was greeted with a sight of—
"You are welcome to take him back to your dorm until he has recovered." Professor McGonagall told them, a small smile on her face as she looked down at Draco, and Harry and Ron nodded with a smile on their face, they rarely got to take Draco into their house, they normally went into Ravenclaw.
"How dare you!--"
Dumbledore stroked his beard, "I see, and what spells did you perform, Mr. Malfoy."
He was so lost in thought that he didn't even notice he had made it to the classroom already, he only noticed when he bumped into the closed door. He looked around to make sure no one saw that (he hated humiliation with a passion), fortunately, no one did.
"Yup! We get to cheer on Gryffindor… unless... you don't want to cheer on Potter?" Anthony's face softened.
********************
"Do you think me a fool, Mr. Davies?" Clearly, Snape wasn't fooled.
"Well, I will be leaving." Dumbledore looked at Flitwick and they both left the room, leaving Draco alone with his friends. He looked over at Ron,
He had about 10 minutes before he had to be in his next class, he had left early on purpose, wanting to talk to Tom.
"Sorry, customs." He shook his head.
Draco yawned, deciding that tomorrow, he would look for Tom.
"Mudblood." He spat, his lip curling as he was shaking with anger. He must have recognized her, that was the only thing that could explain the absolute fury in his eyes.
at the snake.
"I was really looking forward to this class," she moped. It was odd, seeing Luna in such a down mood. Normally, she was the one who offered comfort, no matter how odd it was. She was always the person that made you feel better or made you laugh when you needed it. And half the time, she wasn't even trying.
"Miss Granger, no one is going to expel Mr Malfoy." Dumbledore stopped her speech.
, there was limited knowledge on Seer's in general, but it was speculated that the amount of energy it would take for the eye to force the vision's out would be enough to force a prophesy out of the Seer, and that was what happened to Draco, that was why he had felt so exhausted after the prophesy, because it was forced.
"Does he even like us?"
"You just, bought a Dragon egg from someone?" Hagrid shurgged.
Harry gave Draco a look. "Nothing," he mumbled.
"Harry, what are you doing!" He heard Ron whisper behind him.
He turned and jumped when he saw Harry facing him with a sheepish smile on his face,
Of course, he knew about that house.
Had that look been there before? Lucius couldn't say. He had never paid much attention to Draco. Most of the things he knew about him were because of Narcissa. Or Draco would tell him himself.
"Mr Lockhart!" A small man pushed Draco out of the way,
, a true seer, that would explain the advanced magic. But what the boy had said sounded terrifyingly close to what Sybill had said.
It was a sword.
"See? He has his thinking face on, he knows something!" Harry smiled smugly at Hermione and Ron.
The Eagle on the entrance to the Ravenclaw common room came to life as the young Malfoy approached it. The boy waited for it to speak its riddle, they were hardly challenging for someone of his mental capacity. It appeared as if the Eagle also know this, as his questions were always more challenging than the other first years.
"Well, most of the courtings that start around now are for those arranged pureblood marriages. The Cupid babies don't like arranged marriages that much. But the Lovey Doveys are fine with it." Luna put a finger under her chin, narrowing her eyes. Soon, she started muttering under her breath.
"I'm a Veela," Draco sighed, not looking him in the eye. Even though he had done this once before, it still wasn't any less nerve-wracking. There was always the smallest possibility that Severus really didn't like Veela in this timeline.
Even with the muffs on, Longbottom fainted, Draco could still hear the shrill cries of the creatures and his face twisted in disgust, they were ugly little things. Draco turned to see Hermione Ron and Harry looked much the same as him, except Ron's hands were on his earmuffs.
*************
, he adored the man.
"Don't cry." Harry tried to say, but the words wouldn't come out.
Hermione hadn't reacted well to the overflow of letters he had been receiving, she had tried to be happy for him, but her jealousy had shown threw for just a moment, but he knew that she would get over it, that was just Hermione.
And the most loyal of Hufflepuffs.
Draco realized that he was really tired. He looked at Harry, yawned, and rested his head on Harry's chest, dozing off.
The Hufflepuff looked at Harry. "What are you playing at?" His voice quivered.
"You're definitely coming down with something," Terry said next to him.
"Draco, we need your help, we think Snape's gonna steal something from the third floor." Harry whispered.
Suddenly, Ron sprung up, looking triumphant. "It's a Basilisk!"
He had overheard the conversation between Weasley and Potter, Potter had managed to get through Weasley's thick skull, he was impressed. They would ask him soon, the perfect moment to form a friendship. The Halloween feast was coming up soon anyway, the sooner he got rid of Quirell, the better, he had to preserve Potter's innocence, at least until 4th year.
Breathing was getting hard.
And thus Terry landed himself with Professor Snape as he ran through the types of potions that would help settle his... hormones.
Draco stumbled as he pushed off of Harry and spoke, "I think the death tree did more damage..to.." Draco couldn't finish his sentence as his eyes rolled to the back of his head and the world went black.
"I asked her for hair! Not for hair of a hare!" she sobbed.
Poppy looked at the floor to see the young Malfoy, her jaw dropped, but she shook her head, she could ask questions later, right now, helping Mr. Malfoy was more important.
Now, there was the matter of dealing with Pettigrew. The damn rat was nowhere to be seen. He had asked Ron about it, but that had only led to an argument between him and Hermione. Harry had been the one to explain to him what happened. Apparently, Crookshanks had eaten Scabbers and he was still nowhere to be found. That was another difference. He specifically remembered Weasley having the damn rat in the old timeline. But, for some reason, Pettigrew had disappeared. A small difference at first glance, but when Draco was turning the situation over in his head, he had almost had a panic attack.
******************
"Mr. Malfoy." McGonagall raised an eyebrow, why was she-
A man came in through the door, "Morning, Weasleys!" Draco recognized him as Arthur Weasley.
know. I am not the only Seer in the world, Draco. I have never met a time traveler before. I do not know the effects of time travelling on your Inner Eye." Trelawney spoke in a soothing voice. Even when he was yelling at her, she remained calm.
Draco stumbled backwards, but suddenly, he stopped, looking up at him with empty eyes, Harry stopped for a moment at seeing them, they looked so
Draco's head throbbed again, and he whimpered. He couldn't do this alone. He knew that he couldn't do this alone. He always knew. It was Tom who made him think otherwise. It was Tom who made him do this. It wasn't him.
"Anthony?" He whipped around and was met face to face with Luna.
(See the end of the chapter for
Weasley put his hand on Draco's shoulder, "Knew you would come around, mate."
"My dear boy, my poor dear boy," she started. Everyone seemingly leaned forward in their chairs, the interaction getting more interesting by the minute.
"He's just feeling a bit under the weather." Anthony looked worried, were they hiding something from him? Strangely enough, Draco couldn't find the energy to care.
The fraud was back, he had to suffer another year of his 'teaching', he wanted to smash his head into the wall, repeatedly. The fraud was just in the middle of one of his ridiculous speeches when he spotted Harry,
"Then how will I-" He cut himself off, realizing that he had just been about to tell her he was from the future, he looked at her only to find her smiling.
***************
"Oh, Harry. Ron and I have something we need to do together, will you both be fine alone?" Hermione said but she didn't wait for an answer before dragging Ron away and leaving them both alone.
________________________________
"You look exactly like him!" Fake Terry exclaimed.
Opening the door to his room, Draco made his way inside, the room was full of books, ones that he himself had chosen to decorate with. Some were ones that you would expect to find in a first year's dorm, some weren't, but those ones were well hid, he was far from an idiot.
"He did that... for me?" Draco asked softly.
There was a small part of him that knew that he wasn't dying, that this was most likely a panic attack, but that was only a small part. The other parts were completely convinced that he was going to diediediedie--
"Leave him alone, you bully!"
But the ring, what was the ring, all he knew about the ring was that Dumbledore couldn't wear it, he couldn't.
"POTTER KILLED MRS. NORRIS!" He yelled at the top of his lungs, and Hermione, Ron and Harry jumped all at the same time.
*****************
It started off as normal: the Slytherins were cheating, while the Gryffindors were trying their best not to fall off their brooms. Gryffindor scored most of the time-- the Slytherin Keeper was trash.
Dumbledore and McGonagall chose that moment to burst in, "Severus I know you're upset, but-" Dumbledore stopped in the middle of his speech as he noticed the lack of Professor and the unconscious male in Harry's arm.
Draco looked at her, a hand on his face, desprately trying to keep himself from bursting into a fit of laughter.
, Potter's cheeks pinked again, did he have a condition or something?For some reason, Draco was tempted to put his hand on Potter's forehead, checking his temperature, but that was ridiculous.
"You're stepping on my foot," Ron complained as they crept through the hallway. It was nighttime and they had just left the common room. The cloak really was not made for two people. Harry had barely managed to fit them both under it.
"Yes, sir?" Harry asked.
"Of course I'll go." Draco smiled, which Harry returned.
"Yes...?" Ron's eyebrows furrowed in confusion.
"Infirmary."
A silent, awkward period followed as they stared at each other, Weasley was staring at him in surprise, his face had lost a bit of his colour and Granger was looking at him with his mouth open.

Trelawney narrowed her eyes. "Perhaps this is a punishment," she muttered.
And then, the players came out.
"Sherbert Lemon." She did a motion with her hands and the door started to move.
Lucius ignored him completely, frozen when he saw the book that was lying on Draco's side table. It was a rare crack in his normally calm demeanour: his eyes were slightly wide and his jaw very narrowly hanging open.
"There it is again!" Harry tried to follow the sound, walking down the corridor.
"You don't want to go home on the holidays. Don't think I haven't read about how some muggles react to magical children,
"There's a lot of corruption here, Hermione, and discrimination, some people here don't accept the idea of girls like you being here, girls who don't have magical parents, you're going to face a lot of bullying here if you don't make friends, and I'm willing to be your friend, even if my father might disown me for it."
Then, Draco remembered,
"You know what? I'm sick of this, you all judge him because of his family, just like his family judge's yours! You're a hypocrite, Ronald Weasley!" His jaw dropped open, and so did hers.
"My family owns a summer house. It's not that big but it's pretty close to where you live. It has a few non-perishable foods there as well. So, just in case something really bad happens, you can go there. I'll give you a key in a bit." Anthony had thought about this a lot.
Harry could look at it.
"Yes, the courting process normally takes about a year or so. It's traditional, and you know how traditional Draco is," she reasoned.
"Sorry." He rubbed the back of his neck, feeling blood start to rush to his cheeks. Merlin, he hated humiliation, it was the worst type of torture imaginable.
"Yes, Potter, you've figured it out." He said when Potter opened his mouth.
****************
, Draco was already so far behind with the whole Diary thing. She knew that he needed his sleep, but he also needed to
"If one of the students tries, I want you to report it to me immediately." Flitwick had taken an authoritave tone of voice, he seemed rather serious about this, and Draco liked it, Flitwick was a nice man, strict, but nice.
"....Pardon me?" Lucius Malfoy asked his one and only son. The light of his life. The child he had spoiled. The perfect Pureblood heir. And the son he had almost killed, but they would get past that eventually.
worried about Draco. Professor McGonagall had completely ignored him when he had asked about him, but she had heard him. The only reason she would do that was if something was really wrong.
"No." Draco kept his answer short, there were other things, yes, but they could figure that out themselves, there were other things that Draco had to figure out right now, like how the hell he would stop Quirell, he had forgotten about him in the haze of things, but right now, shouldn't he be doing something to stop him, how did Potter do it in his first year again?
, he had the right to be angry at him.
The only thing to do was use the flying car, but who the fuck would drive it, Draco didn't know how to operate a 'car' and these two weren't exactly the brightest of the bunch. There was no other way, however, "The car?" He suggested, and Ron's eyes lit up,
****************
He was standing next to the mirror for some reason, he looked into it, and saw Harry, holding the stone. He looked at Harry, who winked at him, the stone was in his pocket. Quirrel was saying something again, but another vision, a shorter one this time, came into his mind, Harry touching Quirrel and him melting.
Lupin quickly waved his wand and the boggart turned into a little dancing moon. Lupin forced the boggart back into its closet before turning back to the class. They all looked traumatized and Draco's friends were looking at him with clear horror and worry.
"Because it
Draco laughed nervously and speed-walked out of the great hall, he would definitely tell Tom about this, they hadn't spoken much last night, Draco had to go back to his own dorm that day so he hadn't had much time to talk to Tom.
"Tell Mr. Malfoy's friends that he's still in the Headmaster's office, please, Poppy." He politely asked Poppy.
I'm sorry for the slow updates. I'm going to be rereading the series.
"Well, if I stayed..." Harry trailed off, seeing the look on Draco's face.
"If she won't help us, we need to stop Snape ourselves."
"Hogwarts, now." He wanted to limit his speech and get into the castle as fast as possible. Harry helped him walk as he was still stumbling, and he was grateful, his legs felt like they were putty.
"Your hair grew at an abnormally fast rate. You have the shine that all Veela normally do, but it's dulled enough so that you can't see it unless you look closely. You're obviously not a full Veela. I'm assuming less than half as well. The magic is focused on your hair and face," he said in his usual drawl.
"Wakey, wakey." Someone started slapping Draco's face lightly.
Especially considering the events of fourth year...
Draco started, "I can't stop him from going back to school-" Draco was cut off,
He shuddered at the thought of being in Gryffindor, yes he wanted to change, but he had
That relief was shorted lived however, when he heard someone clear their throat, he was reminded of Umbridge and he whipped out his wand and pointed it at the toa-
But now? He had a manual. For flirting! He had to admit, Purebloods really did think of everything--
"You all treat him horribly, he doesn't pay attention, and he treats me fine, he isn't racist!"
"We don't even know where it is," Harry said and Hermione smiled.
, knowing something?
"It wasn't him, he was fighting something, it wasn't him." Hermione would put her hands in her face if she could.
Did she scream that, looking around, she definitely did, Draco was looking at her with a smile on his face. Even McGonagall was stumped, this was her chance.
He still didn't like going there for his supplies every year. But that was obligatory. Even then, if he really wanted it, he could just ask one of the house-elves to go get him his things. Or one of his parents. But he didn't want to go just to have fun. Besides, there were plenty of things he and Harry could do in Hogwarts while most of the teachers were out playing supervising the others. Most teachers would let them have more free time at the castle because they were missing out on Hogsmeade anyway.
, I care about other people. Hagrid has helped me in the past and if he hadn't helped us with the Basilisk last year my chances of survival would have gone down the toilet." Draco raised his head, not looking like he was going to back down anytime soon.
Harry glanced at said book that was resting on the small table next to the Hospital bed. Draco couldn't bear to look at the book for longer than a minute. All the things he had told Tom, all the secrets he had divulged, and for what? Because he needed someone to talk to. He let his feelings cloud his judgement and that would
"I don't want to talk about this. With any of you," Terry looked away.
"It's my parents! It's my parents! And..it's yo-"
"Come off it you two, listen Draco, I know you've got a thing with Flitwick soon, we'll come to you when we need your help, alright?" Ron asked him, and it wasn't alright, Draco wanted to ask them about Snape, had his own Godfather really tried to murder Harry, no, that couldn't be true because he was still a teacher in the original timeline! It had to be Quirell, but how had they managed to fuck that up.
"Please excuse him, Professor. You know how teenage boys are. He's just turned thirteen. Perhaps he should
*************************
"Oh no. How ever shall you live without me?" Draco answered sarcastically.
"Draco, are you okay?" Potter seemed concerned, causing Draco to calm down, of course he said that out loud, him and his big mouth, but still, Potter had basically recaped his whole life to him when Draco was getting ready to leave, but he couldn't tell him that he had an invisiblity cloak that basically gave him the ability to do anything at all, well, perhaps the fate of the wizarding world was a tad more important, but-
Vapor?
Hermione took a shallow breath. "Oh god, we left him when he needed us," she whispered.
curse this time.
Professor Trelawney went on to explain, "This is a flower that is often used amongst older Seers. It is sporadic, and you need much patience to grow it, but if the conditions are just right, it will release a vapor that will heighten the clarity and length of your visions."
Luna silently patted Anthony on the back and Draco shot him a smile.
The last thing he saw was Harry crashing to the ground before he followed.
"Yes, sir." He responded and Flitwick squealed.
"30 points from Ravenclaw for bullying another housemate, and you will be serving a week's detention with me." Thirty points was a bit much.
using this as a cover, with the artist's permission of course!
"Dobby!" He called, his suspicions were confirmed when the elf didn't appear immediately, and when he did, he was frantically shoving something in his clothing.
Harry's breath caught, hoping, desperately hoping that it wasn't who he thought it was.
Luna walked over to the wardrobe with a smile on her face. It didn't take long for the boggart to come out.
"Justin's been petrified?" Lavender asked, looking pale.
Hermione thought for a moment. "You could still court him. But once the year is up you would have to ask
"Sheild the car! We can't go to Hogwarts if we get

closer to this one.
Probably because I am absolutely ecstatic to write 2nd-4th year, because there are so many things that I have planned for them, but 4th year's plan might have to be pushed to 5th.
"No, we will not send him to Durmstrang, I do not like him conversing with such filth, they are beneath us, Draco." She turned to face him briefly and then turned back to Lucius.
Many things ran through her head. The first was that Draco was a Parseltongue. The second was chilling: Draco was the Heir of Slytherin.
The young girl started reading from her textbook, tears slowly started to fall on the paper, causing her to wipe her face again.
to try and open
was wrong, something more, something that Draco knew, but couldn't put his finger on, the frustration started to build up inside him, and he grabbed his hair, desperately trying to remember, pulling at it, remember
Draco froze. He looked up and sure enough, his father was standing in the doorway. An elf was peeking out from behind him. Dobby.
"That's what they feed on. Human souls," Draco answered. He knew how awful it sounded to anyone who hadn’t grown up hearing the stories. The Muggleborns always paled whenever they talked about them.
almost 24/7.
"Can I call you Draco?"
"Yeah." Draco raised an eyebrow while nodding his head.
"Well, we snuck out of our dorm to duel Nott, right? And we kinda bumped into a three-headed-dog." Harry's voice got softer as he went on.
"Do you want my father to hear you?" Draco opened the car door and hopped in the already squished thing.
Lucius made a sound of absolute fury, spinning around to face his wife, "I told you! We should have sent him to Durmstrang, Dumbledore has already started to corrupt his mind!"
I'm so sorry for such the long wait. There's been many things going on in my life, a few of which are; preparing for a new baby, a religious holiday and a lack of motivation. Sorry, again!
"That is none of your business, Mr Potter, now, what have you done to him!" Snape was red in the face and Harry and Ron baulked at how bare the emotion was on his face, Snape wasn't just angry, he was furious.
"They are not meant to work-" He cut himself off yet again, looking at him intently.
Now, all they had to do was wait.
They were coming this way. He got a book from his bag and started walking while seemingly reading it.
Another gasp, this time, not his, it was Harry's, the figure spun around, just noticing them. It ignored Draco, instead, it got up and made its way towards Harry.
"Be back before dark," was all Lucius had said before he abandoned Draco in the middle of Diagon Alley with nothing but a pouch of gold and a list of what he needed for the year.
Lupin raised an eyebrow at the reaction.
"I can't believe you got your Dad to do that!" she squealed.
" She scowled.
It was Monday. Hogwarts always started on a Monday. That meant there was just barely less than a week before he could meet Trelawney for their 'training.' He had made sure to take Divination. It was a win-win really; his friends were taking the class too and this way, he could use his 'Seer powers' to get good grades.
Rooster?--
Draco sighed. Oh well, the fun was good while it lasted. They cracked open the door to find the room decorated in purple and a few shades of red. It was a familiar sight. One that brought a smile to Draco's face. The rest just looked on in slight surprise; none of the other teachers dared to decorate their classrooms like this. Trelawney, however, had never been like other teachers.
"But there's nothing you can do about it," His grin faltered.
He swallowed and tried to ground himself, pushing the thoughts of Draco out of his mind, he focused on Tom "....The mandrake draught will be prepared in a few hours. Everyone who's been petrified will be back," Harry said in triumph.
"Yes, Professor," Draco looked down.
"Draco, are you coming to the Quidditch match?" Anthony came up to him while he was studying in the library. Draco looked up from his book.
"This is completely optional, but I would like you to read this book, it focuses on Male Veela." He handed Draco a maroon colored book, in big gold letters, it read,
"A boggart, sir," Draco answered easily.
Suddenly, Lupin jumped in front of him. The scene quickly changed from the battlefield to a moon.
"Let's go!" Ron ordered the twins, and they started to move backwards, the bars came off just like that, they opened the back of the 'car' for Harry to put his things into, Draco was starting to calm down when he heard someone scream,
"Hermione you haven't been expelled-"
He looked back at the flower on his bed, why would someone leave this here? He walked over, carefully inspecting it. The thorns had been charmed so he could grab it just fine.
"Yeah?" he said, grabbing Ron's hands to stop him from shaking Harry.
"Of course, mate." Draco nodded and Ron smiled, Draco didn't know if it was because he was glad that he heard him or if it was because he was coming to practice. He wanted to see Harry fly anyways, he liked quidditch, maybe he would try out this year.
Shortly after he had sat down, the Headmaster came into the room, and all the memories of that faithfull day came back in an instant, the astronomy tower, Dumbledore falling, his stomach filled up with dread almost immediately.
"Potter and Weasley are planning on making up with me, I overheard them."
"Draco, did I say something wrong?" Harry asked, despite the circumstances, Draco laughed, even now, Potter was still a self-conscious idiot, how had he changed so much over the years?
"We're Ravenclaws. Third years, yes. But we can put our brains to good use. Think of it as a thinking exercise." Anthony clapped his hands together.
"But why would he do this? That's not the Draco that we know." Harry said, and Ron looked at him in pity,
"Draco!" She waved him over.
But maybe-
The three looked at each other, what had they done without him?
Some part of her brain knew she was going into shock
_____________________________________________
"And he hit his head when we were spinning around in the car when you fell out, remember?" Ron added, and Snape lost some colour in his already pale face.
Why did he say that? He didn't want to, but he knew that he was going to, why didn't he stop himself from saying that? It was like someone was forcing the words out of his mouth. Draco scoffed, like that explanation would hold up against Hermione, it didn't make sense to even himself.
, the Nicolas Flamel who was the man behind time travel, that Nicolas Flamel? How had he been involved in the golden trio's lives? Did he play an even bigger role than Draco had thought?

"What is this, Professor?"
things he had done. Really, was it that hard to remember to bring a bloody bird?
"Is it ready?" Harry asked her, mindful that Seamus was in the room.
Draco rolled his eyes before giving Harry an apologetic look. "Make sure you eat some chocolate before bed," he commanded.
don't know where the Chamber is." Hermione paused, leaving them in suspense.
"Professor Trelawney." He inclined his head respectively.
"Miss Granger, I believe that is something that you will have to find out yourself." Dumbledore smiled.
The eyebrow inched higher.
"You should really learn to respect your superiors, Potter." Tom completely ignored his question. It seemed like a barb, clearly meant to get a reaction out of him but Harry wouldn't let it get to him. Even if his insides really were burning with hatred.
It was a short process, the actual healing, once all the potions and spells had been administered, all they needed to do was wait, there was no rushing the waiting process, it was a crucial part of healing.
Potter and him weren't exactly 'foes' anymore, as the prophesy had put it, they weren't friends, but then again, prophecies always were a bit off on the details, they didn't exacty have a big vocabulary, did they?
"I'm afraid you'll have to ask me that, Draco." She smiled.
"Well, here we are, and Malfoy, I'm sorry too." Weasley said as he walked away.
"Our new Seeker." Flint laughed.
Harry whispered, but his voice had a sort of ethereal tone to it, a different, quieter voice alongside Harry's in the background. Harry said a few other words after 'Don't' but Draco couldn't understand them... well, he could, but they didn't make sense. They had an element of hissing to them, but they sounded like random words strung together; gibberish.
Wait, had Hagrid just revealed how to get past that three headed dog, Draco would need to remember that.
"Fascinating." Dumbledore breathed out, he whipped out a peice of parchment and a quill and started writing with it.
"I appreciate your opinion Davies, but the hat has spoken, are you questioning a thousand year old magic hat that was charmed by the founders themselves, do you find yourself a better judge of character than the brightest witch and wizards our society has known?"
He was more irritated by the former than the latter. But the trio had noticed his discomfort. It was oddly endearing how they shot him sympathetic looks every time he winced and held his head. Harry especially, was fussing over him.
"I can't believe you got a courting flower," Anthony fawned again.
"How do you know?" He wasn't referring to how he knew about the art of Occlumency, Severus had taught him about the art himself, he was asking how he knew that he wanted to look inside his mind.
Draco had enough experience dealing with creeps before he had presented, and being a Veela didn't exactly help to ward any of them away.
Draco appeared to look both shocked and mortified.
, is that what they expected him to do?
"Oh, and Draco?"
And he really did. Harry's face looked much better than it did when they had come in. Instead of the sickly white he had been sporting ever since the train, his tan hue was coming back to his face. His eyes no longer looked dull, returning to the same spark they always did. And his mouth that had looked to be stuck in a permanent frown was smiling softly at Draco.
And yet, here he was, standing outside Hagrid's hut, where Harry had dragged him, not telling him why they were going there, staring at a Dragon egg in shock.
Anthony sighed. "That's true, but you do understand why we feel a bit nervous?"
"Malfoy? Why are you here?" he asked.
"Mr. Potter," Dumbledore addressed Harry, the twinkle in his eyes still shining brightly.
Flitwick hopped onto the side table and began to talk. "I apologize for not believing you, Draco. It was foolish of me. Are you alright?" he said sincerely.
what happened, Mr Potter." He gave him a death glare and then looked back at his godson.
"Every great wizard needs an apprentice. Draco would do great as one, and now that you-" He pointed at Ron who froze, "are here, I don't need to kill him. Your energy would be enough to sustain me. Once he wakes I'll put him under an Imperius, a good little slave." He laughed.
He looked around left and right with an impassive stare on his face.
Voldemort started saying something, but Draco wasn't listening, suddenly, pain exploded in his head, and visions of a boy, a boy who looked like Quirrel getting harassed by his peers for being quiet, he was an easy target, they had said.
Draco was still unconscious.
"Hmm, seems like it worked," Professor Trelawney smiled.
"Hey, Dray, Hermione, Ron and I wanted to tell you this after we got rid of the dragon, but you know.." He trailed off, but Draco got the idea.
Speaking of Veelas, he was showing even more now, his hair had been growing and was now resting at his shoulders, he knew that in a week or two, it would be at mid-length, he would probably tie his hair into a ponytail when that happened, it was one of his favorite styles.
"Of course," Draco breathed.
"It would be a rather odd romance," Hermione giggled.
What he really wanted to do was analyze the vision he had, it was rather important.
Narcissa, try as she might, could not help them get over it. However, much to Draco's relief, she did
"And you know her?" Hermione asked in a voice that clearly said she didn't believe him.
The Dragon probably in Romania by now, and here
"Draco, please, we can't be too late," Harry muttered to himself as he held Draco's body. He felt cold, so,
"Hermione." Harry got her attention and she finally left poor Seamus alone.
Draco was leaning towards the latter.
Draco paused for a moment. "I know you want to protect everyone around you. But...try to protect yourself sometimes too. You can't protect us if you're dead." Draco put his hand on Harry's shoulder.
******************
Harry winced, no doubt remembering how he had almost become a pancake because of Weasley's awful driving skills. But it was mostly the house elf's fault. He still held a grudge against Dobby.
"I have to go ask Professor Snape something." He gestured to the head table where Snape's chair was clearly empty. Draco knew Severus would be in his lab brewing the Wolfsbane potion for tomorrow.
"Draco." Harry choked out.
"It's important. Trust me."
The Fat Lady looked shocked, but opened the door. "They're not supposed to tell the password to those outside of their house," she mumbled.
laughable! But not this time.
Oh, that was his godfather, he didn't look happy, and Draco was pointing a wand at him. They both looked and it and Draco laughed nervously, desperately trying to remember why he was here and where here was-
Draco gave her a look but backed off. Ron, however, did not.
"Malfoy, what did you do to the cat?" Hermione was poking the cat, it wasn't moving, she was looking at him in horror and fear, and Draco smiled at her, an evil smile.
"What happened?" Harry breathed out in horror.
Maybe he shouldn't-
They were wrong.
The car shot them out as well as their things, and Draco wanted nothing more than to just fall asleep on the grass, the tree had hit in the back of his already pounding head and he knew that he most definitely had a concussion.
Harry nodded but stopped when he saw Seamus rubbing the back of his neck, looking down.
And Draco was happy.
Except for that awful Zacharias Smith, of course. It seemed that boy just couldn't let go of the fact Draco was a Malfoy. But no matter, he was pretty sure Smith wasn't even in this class. He had heard that bumbling oaf had spilled a potion on him the day before and was resting in the hospital wing.
"We don't have to go... down that, do we?" Ron said behind him.
*********************
"Hmm," Hermione hummed thoughtfully and tilted her head. Oh, that was her
"No. He has to be less than half. It would be much more prominent if he was." She answered sagely.
He hadn't been paying attention to the conversation, but for some reason, he started paying attention when Hermione started talking, it was as if he couldn't control why he was listening,
******************
Draco put away his notes and got off of the couch, following Harry, he didn't know where the ghost's party was.
"Potions, O. Defence Against The Dark Arts, O. Transfiguration, O. Herbology, E. Flying, O. Astronomy, E. History of Magic, E." Once he was done, he looked up at Draco, looking slightly impressed but far from satisfied.
She took a deep breath and took off in Draco’s direction.
After all, who better to answer his questions about Seers than a being who had born as one?
Summer was going to be a circus and it would be a miracle if it didn't end with Draco being the youngest person to receive a life sentence in Azkaban. Mother was going to lose a lot of sleep.
She looked around and paled when she didn't see anyone in sight. No one was around to see anything. She looked back at whoever it was and glared at them. She knew she couldn't fight them, but she would definitely try.
Harry flushed. "Can we not talk about marriage right now?" He mumbled.
and how
"The plan won't risk anything being traced back to you. If something happens all the blame will be put on me and Harry. You know they would never expel Harry, and my father would never let me get expelled anyways."
Harry, Ron and Hermione sent him grateful looks. Draco noticed that many of the Ravenclaws were giving him a thumbs up and even a few Slytherins were sending him hidden looks of gratitude. That would help his popularity.
Blood purists? He didn't remember anything like this happening last time. And why hadn't he heard of this? His mind immediately began to leap to worst-case scenarios. Was Voldemort back already? No, it wasn't physically possible for him to be back. He had planned everything so carefully. Did he manage to fuck up the timeline this badly? No, things were going so well. No, no no
"Mr. Malfoy, I can already tell that your hair is growing in quite fast." Draco knew that his hair was growing at a faster rate than any non-veela's would, but that was to be expected, it normally stopped growing at about mid-length.
"Yes, but how don't ye think the Nargles wouldn't like the Flobberworms that much because of the war between the Moon Frogs?" Hagrid asked.
"Swish and fli-"
Where did sewage go?
"But Mr. Malfoy, before you go, if you haven't told anyone you are a seer, do not." Dumbledore told him, he was rather serious about it. Draco didn't mind, he already didn't want to tell them that he was one.
"Oh, that's it,
"Take your soul?" He asked in a small voice. It sounded so vulnerable that Draco was brought out of his reverie as he stared at Harry in concern. Had the Dementors affected Harry this much in the last timeline?
Now, all he needed to do was ask Narcissa Malfoy. He hadn't met her specifically, but Draco liked to talk about her. But he had a feeling he might be just a tad bit biased as to what his mother was really like.
The snake looked at Harry, and then reluctantly turned back to the Hufflepuff.
"My name is Professor Trelawney." She clasped her hands together.
She had never heard a seer make a real prophesy, it was beautiful, even if the words carried a dark meaning, the pure magic that came from the boy as he spoke the words were utterly beautiful, now she understood the look in Albus' eyes when he talked about them.
"He never stutters," Ron whispered, looking horribly guilty.
"Oh my god, Draco, I'm sorry." She hugged him, it looked like Harry and Weasley wanted to as well, but they weren't that sure.
"And, pray tell, how do you know about the stone?"
"Both of yeh should be careful, Knockturn Alley's full of dark wizards and witches," Hagrid told them and Draco scoffed, like he didn't know that. Hagrid stopped and turned to face him,
Hermione and Ron looked at him, happy that he agreed with them, and Hagrid made them all a nice cup of tea.
"It would be a rather
He didn't know the-
Draco reluctantly sat down. He wondered what excuse the man would come up with.
"And then we'll be able to bring Harry back to the Gryffindor common room without anyone noticing he left," Draco finished.
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "I am putting flobberworm puke in his hair gel," Draco promised.
"But, I really am sorry for what I said at Madame Malkins, Potter, I was just being a brat then and I don't have an excuse for that." He bowed slightly, god he would have to start doing that.
"I have no idea." Harry had theories, but he doubted any of them would be true. Draco was clearly looking for something. Maybe he had found it; maybe he hadn’t.
"But aren't people all over Veela normally?" When Harry was staying at the Weasley's Charlie had mentioned something about Veela and how everyone seemed to love them. A lot of Quidditch teams liked to use them for their introductions and half time shows.
going to hate Theodore Nott in fifth year, that I can promise you.
"Come on!" Ron said and grabbed his hand, leading him through the group of students and in the direction of the Hospital wing.
"We should get into the trapdoor-" Ron was opening the trap door, making his way down, but Draco had no interest in staying with the damn beast, he pushed Weasley out of the way and jumped down, he was soon followed by Ron, Harry and Hermione, he tried to move, only to have something wrap around his arm.
Professor Trelawney, who had disliked Hermione the moment she had entered the door, gave her a look that was filled with equal parts pity and dislike.
And just like all the other times, Draco answered, "Yes, just a headache."
Well, it was either him or Voldemort and he didn't even
"Dobby said that his Masters threatened him," Harry said, and Draco looked down, a glimmer of sadness in his eyes.
he thought.
"I'm not an idiot, Godfather, yelling at him would've given him more ammunition, like I'd want that, being smart with him shut him up."
Malfoy looked over at Potter, with a slight smile and a calculating look on his face, his eyes were narrowed slightly. The great hall may have quieted down but everyone still payed attention to the young Malfoy, this was a sorting no one would forget soon, least of all Lucius Malfoy.
Potter giggled along with him, even though he didn't know what they were laughing about, perhaps his laugh was contagious. Potter snorted and Draco went into fullblown laughter, Potter followed him soon after, it was weird, not less than half an hour ago, he was crying, and now, he was laughing, but he didn't feel like thinking about it.
He looked around the corner and saw Malfoy talking with some older students.
"I know...I just..." He trailed off, his eyes never leaving the Diary. Just then, Harry came barreling into the common room.
Draco was worried, Harry wasn't getting any of his letters, he had sent them, but the ones that he got back were heartbreaking, the latest one was tear-stained, and they weren't Draco's tears.
Draco woke up on a much softer surface than the one he had collapsed on, for a moment, he thought he would wake up back in the future, in his manor, the empty, empty manor, the screams of people outside like there was every day.
Instead, he put it on a desk near him.
"Correct. This flower is called the Vide Supra flower. Its name translates from Latin to 'see beyond'; see beyond what you see at first. Always give things a second glance."
And then he ran out of the office.
And then, they heard a voice,
"Why are you here?" an irritatingly high voice called out.
Draco smiled and got out his quill.
"I can't tell y-"
Hermione chuckled behind them. Harry relaxed just a tad and Ron sighed in relief. Draco, however, still had his doubts. He didn't remember much of the Golden Trio's adventures in third year. The whole year overall had been mysterious. That year had left Draco with questions, mainly because of how elated Potter had looked by the end of it. But that did give Draco hope for this year; something had happened in the last timeline that had brought joy into Potter's life. And Merlin knows this Harry needed something to pick him up.
He had known that Quirrel was the bad guy, he had known that he had helped Voldemort in some way this year, but he had never considered that he would have the man attached to the back of his head!
"You see a boat filled with people. You look again, but this time you don’t see a single person on the boat. Why?"
"I thought that much was obvious." He raised an eyebrow, Snape narrowed his eyes even more at him, did he expect Draco not to know he was one?
"They're attracted to negative emotions. They don't go after animals, only humans. They feed off the despair that comes off of you. Normally they're kept in Azkaban, but there are stories of the ones that roam free. The Ministry wasn't able to catch all of them, you know?"
Draco waved to his
Draco said nothing. He wouldn't trust this werewolf. Wait, no, he needed to
Draco’s thoughts turned to Snape.
Peter Pettigrew, the human embodiment of a cockroach, was missing. The man who was responsible for something major this year. Draco still didn't know what happened this year, but he knew that it had something to do with the whomping willow. He needed more data.
He heard banging in the direction of his door. Anthony and Terry were probably knocking on it. But he wouldn't let them in. He couldn't let them in.
Draco laughed. "Just
They took off towards the library.
Anthony and Terry would work excellently.
His own name.
Draco left the hall with a quick wave goodbye.
The boggart swarm looked over to him. All the creatures tilted their head at the exact same time.
He knew why the Eagle was changing its riddles, and it wasn't because he had answered the first year's riddles. Maybe the others knew it as well, but it wasn't likely, they weren't exactly above average, the most above-average Ravenclaw he had seen was Patil, and she wasn't a match for Hermione, he always did wonder why she didn't make it into Ravenclaw, perhaps because she was as loyal as a Gryffindor, or maybe because of her bravery.
"You were quite spectacular in class today, Mr. Malfoy." He nodded, that was a complement, that was good.
"The what?" Terry asked.
"Devil's snare." He spoke to himself, he had learned about it in Herbology, a deadly plant.
That was all he needed to know. He looked out the window and saw watched the Manor become smaller as they rose higher.
"We have been here since yesterday night, I called Professor Snape and Professor McGonagall when I noticed that you were moving." Dumbledore answered.
"Harry Potter." Arthur's eyes lit up, but before he said anything to Harry, he turned to Draco, still waiting for him to answer,
Draco frowned. "Of course," he said, motioning to one of the shops he knew no one ever went to. It was fairly new anyways. People tended not to visit new shops around here. Not when they could go places they were familiar with.
The only highlight of his summer was when he got owls from Harry, Ron and Hermione. Sometimes, he could even
Draco and Anthony were quietly talking (well, Anthony was talking.) Draco wasn't really paying attention to him, the other boy never had anything of value to say anyways.
But Draco knew that this was only a few of the changes to come, soon his hair would start growing madly, cutting it would be useless, and his voice would become 'as soft as silk' as people had put it, how one's voice could replicate a texture, Draco did not know, but he did have a faint idea of what it would be like, given the fact that he had heard his voice multiple times in his full Veela.
There were multiple advantages of this form, but the one that was most prominent for a eleven year old was that he could appear as a scared child in front of the older witches and wizards that would no doubt be inside the headmasters office, a boy who didn't know what was happening and what was going on with his body.
Draco choked on his pumpkin juice.
Harry made an offended sound and Draco turned to him last, "And excellent job saving me, Harry." Harry's cheeks pinked at that, but it was true he had saved him, he didn't understand why he was embarrassed.
He didn't even want to think about what would happen if he said no.
"Headmaster-" He started, meaning to ask Dumbledore about that mist that had caused him to faint, but he was interrupted by a small man, running into the room that Draco recognized as Professor Flitwick.
Draco walked over to her and looked her in the eyes and spoke one word.
"You firecalled the Weasleys?" Hermione asked.
"I have to admit that I didn't expect this from you, Mr Malfoy." It wasn't 'Draco' anymore.
________________________________
"Now get
"Professor RJ Lupin," Hermione answered as they both took their seats across from them.
Draco let out a sob.
"You can take the Dragon there, I'll be on guard duty." Hermione seemed confused, but she didn't protest, she merely nodded, and since they were all there, Draco decided to voice another question of his.
"Alright," he said, even though he had no idea what she meant. But then again, most of the books he read were always so confusing on the subject of seers. It was hard to put into words just what you felt when you had a vision or compare the feeling of a prophecy to something else. Perhaps he would have to reach into his imagination.
Luna poked her head in. "You both think too small."
"There's something wrong with that book," Hermione swallowed.
on him. Draco knew for a fact that Snape didn't like Lockhart. He never did like frauds.
"Of course." They all said in unison, and Harry beamed at them.
"What did you see?" Draco stopped for a moment, should he tell Potter, of course he couldn't tell Potter the whole thing, that would raise more questions that he couldn't answer.
"I am proud to announce that I will be teaching at Hogwarts this year, I will be teaching Harry Potter as his Defence Against The Dark Arts Teacher." The man proudly declared, and Harry looked like he wanted to push the man away.
And the world went dark.
Dobby nodded and disappeared leaving a stunned silence behind him. Draco seemed oblivious to the tension, however, and he turned back to Harry with the same small smile on his face.
Probably not, he didn't have a 'power that they knew not' back then, maybe being a Veela, but that wasn't a unknown power, (well, if you included seduction), male Veela's weren't unheardof, they were just extremly rare.
"I never liked homework." Terry pouted.
Harry raised his eyebrows. "Fred and George have a business?"
"So, Harry, tell me about muggles." Arthur ended the conversation and turned to Harry, Draco cringed at the thought of those horrible muggles who had put bars on Harry's windows, but other than that, he tuned the conversation out and focused on slowly eating his breakfast.
It still confused Draco how suddenly Weasley's attitude changed towards him, he still wondered whether the Weasel had ulterior motives, but he knew it was unlikely, maybe he really could just become friends with anyone, didn't know it did that.
"Your friends are looking for you, Mr. Malfoy, we will have time to ask all the questions we need to when you are in better health, right now, you should go to your herbology class." McGonagall said, she was pointing to the door, practically kicking him out.
Brown-haired-
He grabbed a quill and some ink, he should write in it, yes, he would write in it. He opened the book and wrote on the first page,
He laughed at that, poor Potter and Weasley, they were still so naive.
He flinched but looked back at Snape who was looming over him, looking at him with an accusing glare.
"I have no need to go to Hogsmeade. I could stay with you if you needed me to." Draco offered again.
"Tell you what?" Hermione asked.
"Headmaster, don't wear a ring in the future, just dump all the ones you own." Draco said spontaneously, Dumbledore chuckled but nodded nonetheless, he would have to keep an eye on the jewlery this man purchased.
This certain author specialized in many Seer related subjects, Draco had done a bit of research on her and had learned that she had been rumored to have a seer relative, a close one, that would certainly explain why she had such reliable information on the subject, when Draco had first figured out he was a seer (6th year), he had found comfort in this woman's books, mostly because of how accurate the information was.
"Cheers!" Ron chirped, and they knocked their glasses together.
And then, things started getting weird. A Bludger came out of nowhere and almost hit Harry, that would have been normal if the Bludger didn't come back, again, and again. Oh, he had forgotten that this happened!
"T-That's not true!" Harry said, looking back at Draco in betrayal, this wasn't the Draco he knew, and he still felt wrong! Harry didn't know what was happening, but he was certain of one thing, this wasn't his Draco! Something was very wrong.
"Oh, here's the book you wanted me to get, Clearwater."
Ron's eyes widened; they always did when Harry spoke parseltongue.
Harry didn't waste time. The fang that had bitten him lay on the floor and he picked it up, saving a quick glance up he saw Tom running towards him, worry on his face.
"I should have known it was your kind that kidnapped my child." Lucius pushed Arthur to the side as he made his way towards Draco.
Draco sighed and turned his attention back to his Charms book. He was due for a lesson with Flitwick soon enough. Last year had been a bit of a drag, for obvious reasons, and he was determined to make sure this year didn't go the same.
Snape quirked an eyebrow, “Is something wrong, Draco? You look paler than normal.”
Professor McGonagall whipped around, her lips pursed. But what worried Harry the most was how... less cheery the Headmaster looked. The twinkle in his eyes was gone and his normally mysterious smile was replaced by a deep frown. Harry knew something was wrong.
"I'll think about it," He finally answered.
"On the floor." Albus gestured.
************************
was, in trouble because of fucking Nott, and his fucking tattle tail arse.
PS: If you want to keep up with me you can
*********************
"Remember, the match, we had asked you to come but you had said that you were busy?" Harry looked confused.
"You lost that privilege."
She couldn't have been more wrong.
"Where is the bloody classroom?" Harry asked for the thousandth time. Draco was right next to him, smiling and giggling ever so slightly whenever they took a wrong turn. Sure,
"I want you to make sure Hagrid doesn't get fired and that the Hippogriff doesn't get executed," Draco repeated, a fire in his eyes Lucius had only seen in the most stubborn of Gryffindors.
Terry smacked him on the back of the head.
"Ron?" A voice called out from the window.
"Those are Nimbus 2001's!" Ron gasped, looking at the brooms in jealousy, while Draco was looking at them in confusion as well as curiosity, his father hadn't bought them for the team this time, it looked like Nott really was the replacement Malfoy this time.
A pop sounded and the elf appeared again, holding out a letter with shaky hands, Narcissa grabbed it and showed it to Lucius, who started reading it out loud.
Draco looked up, "Look out!" and Weasley narrowly missed the clocktower.
"I merely have a... request." She hesitated at the last part, as if looking for the right word.
"What even is this?" He asked.
"And the mirror with Justin." Draco nodded, a small smile on his face.
"Well, Snape's gonna try to steal it."
"I was showin' the class Buckbeak an' Nott insulted 'em even though I told 'em not tah. An' Buckbeak slashed 'em!" His accent got heavier and heavier.
"You seem off? Do you like Hermione or something?" He asked. There was a prickling feeling at the thought of him and Hermione snogging each other. It had to be disgust.
"Why did you apologize for what you said? I mean, you just changed, like that." Weasley snapped his fingers.
Why were they blaming Harry already? That wasn't supposed to happen until the duelling club, and he had already made preparations to make sure that didn't happen, he would have to scrap those now. Oh god, what happened-
All of Terry's life, ending up in situations where he couldn't predict how people would act had always ended with him getting hurt. Whether physically or emotionally.
He started flipping through it, taking out his quill when someone burst in,
"Are you just going to let me treat him on the floor?" She hissed to the others.
The writing was back.
"Draco, he was born on June 5th." He tore his eyes away from the unconscious boy to look at them both.
"I know. Despite what you and Hermione think, I'm not completely an idiot." Harry laughed but Draco could see something serious in his eyes.
"I believe that you need to be trained, Draco," Trelawney started as soon as the man went to the back (well not immediately, she had insisted on waiting for 46 seconds.)
"You're sweaty," Draco said dully. Stupid! It was the first thing that had come to mind. His mind had shut down and, of course, the first thing that had come out once he had successfully done a reboot was a 'You're sweaty.'
"Mr. Malfoy, why are you here?"
"You've been acting incredibly different since you've came here."
"If you do not have the sight, there is very little I will be able to teach you." Draco smiled a bit, remembering how easy and naturally the class had come to him. Back then, he had bragged about how smart he was. But now, he knew it had little to do with studying than natural skill.
"Are you writing in your
Lucius was looking around the shop and Draco didn't have a chance to hide as Lucius' eyes locked on him.
"Herbology is my first class, how long have I been out?" Draco asked, he was a tad bit worried considering the fact that it looked like the sun was rising.
"Why doesn't he tell us anything?" Terry said, finally.
Hermione looked over at him, "Snape's gonna steal the stone today."
He had glanced at the Gryffindor table a few times, only because he thought he felt someone looking at him, but every time he looked at the table, Harry was looking somewhere for some reason, Draco had caught him looking at the ceiling several times, not to mention that his face was always red, he had to get some pepper up for him, Draco was starting to worry for him, maybe he had a cold.
"Professor." He nodded at both Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape who were standing beside Dumbledore, talking to him, all except Dumbledore seemed startled at the new voice.
"Yes?"
"Draco-" Trelawney got up, making her way towards him.
Well, this would be a fun conversation.
Wait, did he say that the Headmaster was going to hear about this, of course Dumbledore had to hear about it, oh well, he might even get a few more points for his house, even if he didn't, it would give him a chance to talk to Dumbledore.
"I don't see why not!" Lockhart smiled and almost all the girls fawned over him instantly.
"DO YOU WANT TO COME TO QUIDDITCH PRACTICE WITH US?" Draco swore he heard his ears ringing.
"The day we discovered your origin, Severus came to me with a request. He asked me to Obliviate him. You see, Lucius is one of the few people able to get past Severus' shields. Back in their school days, they would practice on each other's minds. Your father knows how to get into Severus' mind, and he didn't want to take the chance of Lucius finding out and jeopardizing your safety. He knew he wouldn't be able to Obliviate himself, as I'm sure you know how dangerous that is, and so he asked me."
Grabbing his hairbrush from his nightstand, he brushed his hair, fortunately, he had stopped using gel on his hair, that was an atrocious look, what little him was thinking, he couldn't fathom.
"No one was screaming, mate," Ron said, confused. Hermione was just watching them, her eyes narrowed, and Draco was suddenly reminded of McGonagall.
Sorry for the late update! It's Ramadan and I normally spend the whole day wallowing in fanfiction complaining about how hungry I am.
"So you don't want to be seen with me?" More tears.
Draco looked Potter directly in his eyes. "Alright."
Draco had done a little bit of digging. He was a curious child after all; and had looked into a few Ministry files. He had seen that the man hadn't even been given a trial. There was no way to determine if he was guilty or not, but he was sure that the trial, or lack thereof, was unfair. Sirius Black had either confessed and felt so guilty that he had requested not to have a trial, or he had been wrongfully imprisoned.
"Are you still mad at me?" Harry asked.
But why would you, you could learn so much from this-
He was surprised to see a racing broom (a rather ancient one), and a flurry of keys with wings flying above them. It looked oddly pleasing, he liked the little humming sounds the sentient keys made. Ron and Harry were right behind them, Ron was looking at the keys while Harry was staring at the broom. Draco looked over at Harry, a glint in his eyes,
Draco sat down on the stairs in the hallway. He curled in on himself, put his arms around his legs and put his head on his knees. He didn't have time to do anything else before someone came barrelling down the stairs.
"A mudblood." He cringed at the word and Hagrid gasped.
Lucius stomped over to Draco, Dobby scurrying behind him.
Draco frowned, silently asking the woman to go on, and go on she did.
"I mean, I disagree on that, why would seven be such an important number in Arithmancy?" Tom was going on about the number seven and how magical it was, Draco was interested.
"He's been acting... odd lately," Draco said, reminiscing about all the times Harry seemed to look away and the stares he received in the Great Hall. Even when Draco sat at the Gryffindor table, Harry's eyes never seemed to leave him.
"Remarkable." He breathed out.
, unlike Moody's classes. He was excited to go through them again.
"Welcome to my world."
"Even if you don't know you want it, it'll show it, you probably see your parents right?" Draco smiled, he thought Potter had told him what he wanted, but Draco had been so focused on his own desire, that he didn't pay much attention to Potter's words.
Harry, he just felt so
"Mr. Goldenstein!"
Tom let out a cruel laugh.
"Of course he is! This is ridiculous, how are we supposed to
Harry's smile faltered a little, dying into a small smile. "I can't do that."
"Thank you, Professor."
"Simplicity leaves room for change. If we plan everything to a tee we won't know what to do if anything goes wrong. Same thing for backup plans," Draco countered.
She looked at Draco (who looked paler than a sheet of paper). His eyes were wide and clouded with fear and suspicion. They had a glassy look to them, and his mouth was open slightly. He was taking shallow breaths. She glanced at Harry and Ron, who were standing on either side of her, and saw the despair on Harry's face at seeing Draco look…
He opened his mouth to say something when he heard a voice, whispering,
"Did I say that out loud?"
"These two idiots managed to give him a concussion!" Snape scolded them as he came out of the back room with a few potions in his hands, one was blue and the other was red.
Someone knocked on the door, Draco had to wrap up their conversation.
Draco groaned. "How ignorant are you?"
"Hey! Leave him alone!" He whipped out his own wand, he knew he couldn't beat him, but it just felt right.
Dumbledore chuckled. The tension slowly left the air as the dreamy smile came back onto his face. "He asked me to, Draco. You know that Severus is a master Occlumens, yes?"
Hermione's face brightened. "Yes! It is! Come on." She ushered them out of the room, but before she closed the door, she looked back at Seamus.
Draco looked at Harry, who shrugged back at him.
"Yeah." Ron agreed with her (as always).
Draco's eyes widened. "What?"
"Mr. Malfoy, is everything okay at home?" Lupin asked.
"Are they talking about Nargles?" Harry whispered.
"Oh my- just don't worry about it okay, McGongall will just make you write some lines on a board."
Before Hermione and Ron could leave, Dumbledore spoke up. "There is something happening with Mr Malfoy," he stated.
"Yeah, he definitely is." And then, Harry hesitated.
"Here Harry, I'll get them signed for you!" Molly took the books out of Harry's arms.
"Luna...?" Terry looked green.
"But why would you do that?"
" The voice whispered louder, it sounded familiar.
"Send for Poppy." He whispered to Fawkes, he understood and took off for the hospital wing.
That did make sense, he supposed. Lucius didn't exactly come off as loving at first glance, and sure Draco held a lot of resentment towards him. But that didn't mean he would just let people make these assumptions about his family.
McGonagall sighed, "Draco Malfoy."
She never thought she'd say this, but the detention was worth it just to see the look on Weasley's face.
"I asked
And yes he had done what no one else had and had done a non-verbal spell in his first year, but they didn't need to talk about that, there were other things that Flitwick liked about him, he was nothing like how his father had been in school, and while he tried to keep himself from prejudice, he couldn't have helped being surprised at the young man's attitude towards everyone.
"Paulene!" He heard Luna cry from across the room. He turned around to see Luna happily chatting to a Hufflepuff with short, curly, dark hair and skin.
A year? Would he really be willing to wait that long? Well, he had been waiting since first year. But his feelings had only grown with him. It seemed every year Draco could come back looking even better than he did the last year and Harry would make some bumbling attempt at flirting and Draco would have no idea what he was talking about. And then the cycle would repeat. Every. Year.
"Catch them?" Harry asked.
Tom raised an eyebrow in amusement. "Well, well, well, Potter knows my name," he said, walking over to him.
They stopped in front of the door and McGonagall spoke the password.
"Oh yeah, I came up here because Hermione wanted to invite you to Nearly headless Nick's birthday, we all don't wanna go alone."
"Catch the key!" Harry threw the key over at Draco, who caught it without much thought. He ran over to the door and shoved it into the keyhole, twisting it. Once the door opened, Harry zoomed right into it, as did everyone else once they saw that the keys were following him.
"Dobby, we need a rooster. You should keep one with you, and when we call for you, bring it with you." Draco ordered in a high and mighty voice. It was odd, hearing him like that.
Harry didn't hesitate, he dove for the key, and was barely keeping up with it, finally, he caught it, but that wasn't the end, he had to use it now. The swarm was still following him but he made his way over to them,
"Jeez, Malfoy, we get it, you're smart, no need to rub it in." One of the boys who was in the dorm looked up from his book, the others were all looking at him weird, but he was the only one who said anything, Draco thought his name started with a E.
"This meeting is over!" Snape yelled at the remaining students.
The Diary was in his room; he had been researching talking objects, but he couldn't find anything like Tom. He would talk to Tom today, but right now, he needed to sleep. Draco brushed his hair out of his face and put his hands under his head and closed his eyes.
He heard Tom hiss behind him, "Fools." He heard him mutter.
They hadn't even thought of a way past the three-headed beast, they were
He was used to being able to figure everything out. He knew things before they were going to happen. Both because of his knowledge of the future and his visions. It was weird, not knowing what was going to happen. It was a feeling he hated. The last time he had felt so...unaware was last year.
That took him by surprise. Severus had gotten the ingredients for the potion immediately in the last timeline. Maybe he already knew? Severus always was perceptive.
That was when Neville dropped his teacup. 9 minutes had passed. Trelawney didn't look surprised. Instead, she walked towards him and waved her wand.
"Pray tell, why do you need Veela suppressant potions?" He slowly added the Aconite to the mixture, his movements clearly second nature. He wasn't even looking at the cauldron, instead looking at Draco.
Lucius may love his son, but he always had dark intentions when it came to any sort of power he was gifted with.
Ron and Harry hesitated for a moment before drinking the potion, while Hermione drank it right away. It took a moment, but eventually, their bodies started changing. It was a weird feeling, and it looked even weirder in the mirror.
In the corner of his eye, he saw Dumbledore stop his movements and try to look him in the eye, trying to get into his mind. Dumbledore breathed in sharply.
"No more secrets between us, alright?" Harry tried.
, plural. He belongs to the family. His true Master would be my father. House-elves always listen to the Head of the Family before anyone else. He'll be passed on to me unless my father frees him." Draco scoffed at the end.
"Thinking you could keep me away from my dearest Draco. Really, I don't know why he even deals with you in the first place. Oh wait, I do!" He laughed.
Lucius and Narcissa were not abusive. If anything, they were too loving when he was growing up. All of his faults were, while a product of his upbringing, at least partially his fault. It was always his fault.
"Of course I will," Draco spoke in a tone that suggested it was stupid for him to think otherwise.
"I have to go ask Flitwick something!" He lied, not wanting to explain to her why he was going to see the divination Professor when they didn't even have divination until third year.
Draco's hair had now grown out fully, and he recived many questions about it, but he had blown them away, eleven year olds were very gullible, it was the upper years that he had to actually bulllshit his way through.
There was a part of Anthony that felt hurt that Terry didn't immediately accept. But he had dealt with these situations before. Whenever a kid would be sitting at the dinner table of their summer house, looking at them with clear suspicion.
Draco's eyes widened, he had never earned that many points at once.
"I saw one the night I left the Dursley's."
Harry gulped but stood his ground, "When we landed in the tree I think it hit him in the back of the head, it did break the glass." Harry looked at Ron,
, a major change in the Seer's life or major disruption in the Seer's magic would cause their eye to promptly close, making it hard, near impossible to get vision's or even listen to the stars.
Terry and Anthony were saying something, but their voices sounded warped and far away. He pushed Anthony away and ran to his dorm.
He regretted becoming friends with this death trio.
"I am." Harry nodded seriously, a fire in his eyes. Hermione and Ron often told him - and on some occasions Draco, but it was almost always said as an insult - that he was extremely determined.
He wondered what blue roses meant in the language of flowers. He put the Vide Supra flower on his side table.
Draco did as he was told, but the other didn't sit down, had Snape made him sit down because he thought what he was about to tell him would be too much for him? A silly thought, even as an eleven year old he wouldn't think he would have, what,
Harry didn't try to break out of Draco's grasp, which Draco thought was strange, but he was too focused on getting him out of here, this place screamed danger.
Luna took a deep breath and faced the wardrobe again. She shakily raised her wand and yelled,
Hermione shrugged and handed the page to Draco.
A book that talked back, how interesting-
"It's how I'd speak to someone who tried to kill my best friend." Harry scowled.
She readied another spell but didn't even have time to cast the wand movement when she was suddenly overwhelmed by pain. She tried to scream but her voice wouldn't work. She fell to the ground, she couldn't move but she could see the blood oozing out of her left leg. There was a huge gash on it. Hermione couldn't think, she was blinded by pain. She struggled to breathe.
Draco turned around and followed his father who was already quite a bit ahead of him, he smiled,
. Draco could do that spell non-verbally, would it be so bad to just do it. It wasn't like the first years were going to taunt him because of that.
Draco could feel his cheeks getting warmer, he always did like when people complimented his intelligence, it was something he and Hermione both shared.
He was so tired.
"Come on!" Harry said, ushering Ron to follow him through the cave.
The teachers were gathered around McGonagall's desk, all except Dumbledore. McGonagall stood behind her desk while the others stood in front of it. She looked incredibly stressed.
For a second, Draco considered lying, but decided against it when he knew that they could just inspect his wand to see if he really had used the spells that Weasley said he had, and they would, of course, show that he did. He didn't need to dig a deeper grave for himself.
He gasped as a figure came into view, a person, standing over a dead Unicorn, such a magnificent creature, dead, the sight hurt him, but he was too focused on the figure in front of him, someone covered in a cloak. He felt like he recognised him, his mind was screaming at him to remember, but it wasn't letting him remember-
Draco opened his mouth to say something before closing it and taking a deep breath. It wouldn't do good to lecture Harry without a cup of tea first. He would need it to hear what he knew would be an absolutely ridiculous story.
Nearing the portrait, Draco waited for the Eagle to rise, it always took a bit too long, was it faulty or something, it could be another project to work on, fixing the damn door.
