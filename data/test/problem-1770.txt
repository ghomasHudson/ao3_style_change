"Potter!" Draco spat the word and charged up to Harry, grabbing his jumper in his fist and shaking Harry in his anger. "You can't just tell me you love me the second you realise that you might lose me to someone else!"
"Mallow-sweet is being used in Butterbeer," Winky sniffled, "Dobby is being telling Winky that children like Butterbeer."
Harry had finished off an enormous pile of bacon and eggs and was about to pull a roll onto his plate when Draco stopped him and put a small ramekin in front of him instead. Harry cracked the sugary top and scooped the custard into his mouth and groaned in pleasure.
Harry turned back to the Aurors as Draco's hand slipped from his wrist. "I've done everything anyone asked me to, I killed that fucking evil git-" Harry was cut off by an objection from another Auror about the Malfoys before his temper flared out of control. "I FUCKING DIED IN THAT FOREST FOR YOU ALL, AND WHEN I SAY YOU WILL NOT TAKE ANY MORE FROM ME I SODDING MEAN IT!" The entire group stared at him dumbly, Harry could feel a placating hand between his shoulders, trying to smooth the hunched muscles there. "Draco Malfoy lied to Death Eaters weeks ago to stop Voldemort being summoned when I was captured by Snatchers. Narcissa Malfoy lied for me merely hours ago to Voldemort's face to keep him from knowing I had survived! You'd all be cowering at Voldemort's feet right now if not for them!"
"Well, yes," Molly leaned over to grab the carrots Ron had been grating, "She passed away two nights ago. The Healers were unable to reverse the curse damage."
George nodded and stood up, pointedly looking at Pansy. Luna stood and pulled Pansy along by hand, kissing Harry's cheek as she went, "It's okay, Harry, I don't think you'll hurt Draco again." Harry flushed at her blunt words and nodded to George as the trio slipped out of the Hospital Wing. Draco regarded Harry blankly, he knew Harry was going to apologise. He wasn't sure if he could bring himself to continue to be upset with Harry. "Draco-" Harry immediately choked up and threw himself onto Draco's shoulder. Draco moved his arm up automatically to cradle Harry, who was now sobbing into his neck. "Shhh, c'mon Potter, I'm fine, I'm fine." Harry hiccuped a little and scrubbed his face with his sleeve, "I am so sorry. I just- I just reacted and Hermione yelled at me and said you were trying to cast a Shield and I am such an idiot."
Draco's anger was evident on his face but he picked up the file and continued to read dispassionately, "Patient shows extreme changes to personality, according to interviews with his family and friends. Aggression towards his partner, Trainee Healer Malfoy. Resentment towards expectations of him to be the same person he was, arrogance displayed when informed of his status in society. Patient quit job when he became aware of his financial status."
"I have another gift for you." Harry pulled out the hastily wrapped box from his jacket and held it out.
Draco smiled at the thought of Jean, he had gone with Hermione to Australia. Harry and Ron had decided leaving George alone a month after Fred's funeral was too much for them. He and Hermione had come back firm friends, successfully restoring her parents memories with her Charms expertise and his Potion skills. They had also enjoyed the break in Australia, a chance to get to know each other and heal the wounds of the past. Draco had learned so much about Muggles in the time he'd been there and he missed the casual setting of Jean and Roger's beach house. He had also kissed a very cute Australian boy with messy brown hair and bright blue eyes and realised he was gay. No one in the family had said anything negative about it when he got back and told them. Charlie was gay and in a relationship with a very handsome Argentinian man from the dragon reserve, Matias.
"You cannot blame yourself, you couldn't know that the barb would go through your back and puncture him instead," Draco's mother wrapped him in her arms.
"I did enjoy a rather long bath but I missed putting Araminta to bed and without your midnight trudge into the kitchen for tea the house felt a bit too quiet." Draco's words settled into Harry's stomach like warm treacle tart, sparking hope in him once more.
Luna eyed Harry for a few minutes, "I'll write to them and explain. Do you want to write the list of people or do you trust me to recognise who you need to hear from?"
Malfoy and Hermione caught the brunt of the blast. Kingsley just said that Malfoy got up a Shield Charm a second too late to stop the bomb completely. I can't believe he knew what it was once he saw it. What the fuck did Death Eaters get up to for Malfoy to know what bombs are? Shit, sixteen are injured. Proudfoot told Ron that it had enough power to kill half the Great Hall if Malfoy had not reacted in time.
"Draco fucking Malfoy. Boy, did you blow the right hero, huh?" Nott kept his wand dead centre, pointing to Draco's chest. Hermione cast a wandless Shield Charm, cursing internally about not practicing wandless
"Oh, er. We wanted to let you have the house to yourself tonight. Um, because you won't see, y'know, her tomorrow." Harry felt his breath shorten at the idea of Draco alone with Celia.
Harry felt his concern for Draco being Marked bloom into something suspiciously like horror. Draco's arm was indeed marked - but not how they had all expected. Scars ran over his arm, clearly making words which overlapped and crossed each other, some livid and red, some a dull lilac that had been there for longer. Harry caught a few of the words,
"Tomorrow, after everyone has given out the presents you will give Draco this, somewhere private." Narcissa handed Harry a small, elaborately carved wooden box.
Harry wipes his tears on the back of his hand and sits up. The tall blonde man in the doorway is his Draco - but it isn't his Draco at all. This man has his hair cut in a neat fashion, short back and sides with the top combed over so it falls in a soft wave across his forehead. The narrow half-moon spectacles perching on his nose are new, as are the lime green robes of a full Healer - not the washed out aqua of a trainee.
Harry thought back to the Fiendfyre, the screams of Crabbe as it burnt him to death, "Yeah, I reckon I can understand that."
"It's a Muggle protocol, it's called defibrillation," Healer Gurjeet pointed to the interesting looking metal contraption beside her, "We, er, shock Harry into waking up."
Harry glanced at the ground behind them, at Lucius's corpse, unable to protect or harm his family further now he was dead. Harry was immediately angry, only because of Draco and Narcissa's actions, had he had the chance to destroy Tom Riddle. Harry knew that they had just followed the head of the family out of misplaced trust and familial loyalty. How could Harry have ever expected them to reject everything they'd ever known in the face of either submission or death? One of the Aurors was casting an
Draco and Luna Apparated into Harry's hallway, he hurried out to greet them. Draco shoved a box which was chinking slightly at Harry and got a firmer grip on the Pensieve he and Luna were carrying.
"It's your fault the bomb went off here," Harry snapped, "It's your fault Hermione lost an arm and Marcie lost a leg and everyone was injured!"
Harry reached out his hand and ran it down one of the long slashes across Draco's chest. "Draco-" Harry choked on the words of his apology. Draco had been so caring with him today and Harry had nearly killed him. Draco grabbed his hand and pressed it flat over his heart. Harry calmed at the steady rise and fall of Draco's breathing. Draco's Legilimency push into his mind again, a soothing whisper, it was nothing like Snape or Riddle blundering through his mind.
Astoria Malfoy died at 8:47PM on the 9th of January, 2019. Harry vividly remembered the day a haunted looking Narcissa Malfoy appeared in his Floo at the Ministry, begging Harry to take Scorpius home with him to Albus and keep him busy. Albus had mentioned that Scorpius hadn't come over for Boxing Day because he was so anxious to spend time with his mother, halfway through a very difficult second pregnancy. Harry had barely affirmed they would take him when the boy tumbled into his arms through the Floo.
Draco stared back at Harry and pulled up his sleeve, baring the Dark Mark to all, "I shouldn't have been given the choice between servitude to a killer or my mother's life."
I don't understand what the Healer is saying anymore. Why do I need counselling? I went through a war and no one tried to make me have that. Well, Hermione did. She dragged me to a Muggle and told her that I'd been through a Muggle war and had some stress thing. The Muggle said I didn't have the stress disorder but that I was depressed. Of course I'm depressed, everyone I've ever seen as a parent was murdered - mostly in front of me.
"Because you've been exposed to a traumatic event. I've been in two wars, one magical and one no-maj - Muggle, as you call it," Sergeant Parrish looked at them with knowing eyes.
"Y-you want me to be part of your family?" Harry's voice was quiet and hesitant beside Draco. He turned to look at the black haired boy and thought he'd never looked so unsure. "Well, Harry you don't have to, of course, but you are Teddy's godfather and the Lord Black. It makes you one of us," Harry stared at Andromeda like she was going to take it back. He stood, hesitating, before racing around the table and throwing his arms around her, "Thank you." Draco had barely heard the quiet words but he heard the sadness behind them, and realised Harry hadn't felt like he had a family before now. He felt the beginnings of anger in his chest, who the hell did Harry live with before this, to make him feel like he'd not had a family?!
Narcissa looked to the closed kitchen door and flicked her wand at the door, warding it, before conjuring a sturdy desk chair for herself and sitting next to Harry. "He is happy with her because he thought you were never an option."
He was vaguely aware of Hermione shouting and red light flying around him. Draco thought dying was very dramatic, as he felt his stomach drop and his vision blur. Draco opened his eyes an infinite amount of time later to a cool white room, extremely dim and with various whisperings. Draco breathed in, gasping a little at the pain in his chest. It seemed very unfair that he had to take the injury with him to the afterlife, but supposed he had no reason to expect he wouldn't take the pain on. The whispering got louder, and he realised his mother was whispering to someone, "I think this tea is about the worst thing I've ever had, do they just pour the Bubotuber pus in directly or do you think they mix it with Goblin piss?" Draco huffed a laugh, confused. Why was his mother whispering in the afterlife? Fear gripped his heart, had Nott killed her too?
"I haven't been able to go back to the Manor since the Ministry gave it back to us," Draco chimed in, "I spoke my first words, learnt to walk, to ride a broom there. But it's not my home anymore, it feels like a prison to me."
"I do," Draco shuffled his feet, "I think... I think if there'd never been a war, I would have done the expected. Secure the future line, be a proud Pureblood, live a boring life. I'd like to rebuild the family, but differently. I want my kids - if I ever have any - to be proud of their family because they're good people. They probably won't be mine by blood anyway, so they won't learn about all that garbage."
Harry is crushed under the weight of the cabinet but doesn't feel too badly injured, until a strange looking gem slides down a shelf and onto his forehead. A blinding crimson light envelops Harry, his last thought of Draco and the engagement ring sitting in his desk at work.
" Hermione whipped her head around at the quartet of voices, Harry, Ron, Pansy and George sending blasts of red light at Nott. "Help me! Draco!" Hermione was handed Pansy's wand and immediately Apparated Draco to St. Mungo's. She felt the floor of St. Mungo's slam into her knees, hardly registering the pain she started screaming for Healers. A kind looking wizard pulled her hands from Draco's chest, electric blue waves rippling over the open wound while two Healers lifted Draco from her arms. Hermione watched them disappear down the hallway and allowed herself to finally fall to pieces.
"Fuck!" Harry raced back to the Burrow (forgetting Apparition in his panic). He barged into the living room, dripping wet and out of breath, but Draco was not there. Narcissa gave him a disappointed grimace and rushed out the front door, her crack of Disapparation heard soon after.
"I cannot believe I missed it. Was there any damage to Hermione's books?" Draco asked while pressing kisses over a squirming Minty's cheek.
Luna held up the jar and smiled, "I wish I had known how to conjure these in your dungeon Draco, although I don't know if I could have done it wandlessly." Draco stiffened. Luna didn't mean any harm by her comment, she knew he was just as much a prisoner of that house as she was. Harry must have noticed his disconcertion and nudged Draco in the ribs. Draco got the hint and pulled his glove off and gripped Harry's wrist.
how Harry felt. They'd shared a bed for a month before the Australia trip! Harry had only shared a bed with 'Mione and Ron before - and that was not romantic in the least.
His mother and aunt were clasping hands and sitting on a wooden bench, whispering to each other with tears down their faces. Draco thought if anything could mend the decades old rift between the Black women, it would be shared grief and a new baby. He startled when his mother roughly pulled his aunt into an embrace as sobs wracked from them both. He felt drawn into their grief, moved by the casual familiarity of his mother's embrace, until he caught sight of Harry awkwardly holding the still screaming baby.
, wedged between a pouting Lily and a cheery Ron on a two person couch in the Burrow, watching Draco and his girlfriend, Celia interact with the Weasley family. Ron had guilted him into coming, because 'you can't miss family events because of her forever, mate'. It wasn't that Harry was avoiding Celia, so much as just refusing to deal with the fact that Draco was in a relationship at all.
Harry always liked the little stone bridge that crossed the creek behind the Burrow on the walk up to the main village, so he steered them in that direction. The morning sun was weakly shining over the snow encrusted scenery and gave them a scant amount of warmth. Harry shuddered as Draco's warming charm washed over him.
Ron and Pansy were already sitting with an extremely bloody Hermione. Harry snapped to attention when Aurors appeared behind him, transporting the unconscious body of Theodore Nott. Harry didn't know why Nott had gone after Draco, but he didn't care. He started towards the boy again before he was pulled back sharply. "What the fu-" Harry was drawn up short when he found himself looking into the teary eyes of Narcissa Malfoy. He was about to ask how she had known so quickly that Draco was injured when he saw who had an arm around her shoulder, Kingsley nodded at one of the Aurors and turned back to Harry.
"Well, he wrote a lovely apology and asked that I consider letting him join us as otherwise Andromeda was likely to feel guilty and he didn't want her to only have him for company," Molly fussed over her cake batter, "Such a polite young man, terribly sad about his mother."
Harry knew he wasn't really angry at his friends, he was angry at himself. Draco had gone to Australia and kissed a boy. A boy who was not Harry. Harry hadn't been handling the information well and had been moody with Draco since. Narcissa - who had insisted on Harry calling her Cissa - had noticed and quietly told Harry that "one does not punish a beloved when one does not own one's feelings entirely". Harry didn't quite understand the statement but gathered she meant that he couldn't be pissy at Draco when Harry hadn't told him how he felt. Harry indignantly thought that Draco should
Narcissa squeezed her shoulder and moved away, "I know, dearest, but Harry is our family too. It can't be easy for him seeing Draco like this and knowing that he contributed to it." Narcissa brushed a lock of hair off Draco's face, leaning in to press a kiss where his bruising was darkest. Not for the first time, Narcissa's quiet dignity and easy forgiveness gave Hermione pause. She suspected if Draco had been raised by Narcissa alone, he would have been a very different boy at eleven. Hermione felt a small squeeze against her hand, surprising her. She looked at Draco's face, tears springing at once when she saw grey eyes meeting hers from behind heavily bruised lids.
Draco looked around, noticing Harry was clearly absent. His heart sank, was Harry injured or had he just not wanted to be here? The door opened, slamming into the wall and startling Hermione and Pansy awake. Potter stood in the doorway, looking like Voldemort himself had been chasing him and stared at Draco. Before Draco could greet his friend, Harry threw himself into Draco's arms. Draco relaxed and then tensed again as Harry pulled back. Harry looked at Draco like he had never seen anything more incredible, then crushed their mouths together.
"I'm good, Gramma. I just want to hug Uncle Harry. I missed him," Teddy sulked and tucked his head against Harry's chest.
Molly and Arthur stood tall in front of Draco, he straightened and regarded them with a fear on his face that Hermione could understand. Molly had killed Bellatrix Lestrange and was worthy of Draco's fearful respect. Arthur held out a hand and told him stiffly that they accept his apology. George stepped up and took Teddy from Molly's arms, whispering to the baby about teaching him pranks and tricks. Hermione felt grief run cold through her, George had lost half his heart to the War and was barely acknowledging Malfoy.
"Healer Malfoy assures me you have no memories past the moment of injury until you awoke three days ago, is that correct?" Luna asked.
Hermione was browsing quills at Scrivenshaft's, comparing nibs with Draco to find the best option for their exams. Harry and Ron had rolled their eyes at her and Draco when they announced their plans to buy stationery for their N.E.W.T.s. They had begged off to Honeydukes and promised to come back with Tooth-flossing Stringmints for Hermione and caramel fudge for Draco. She and Draco had found three exceptional candidates for their exam quills, and were going to use them for the next month to determine the best choice. Hermione also bought a handwriting improvement quill for Harry. She was fond of but pragmatic about his atrocious scrawl, Harry could use some help with his penmanship.
Harry stares at the familiar wooden door which is now closed and turns on the spot, aiming for The Burrow. Harry has barely stopped spinning on the back path when Ginny explodes from the back door, eyes blazing and wand at his throat.
Draco watched as Harry stared down at his grimy clothes, miserably pulling his filthy sweater away from his chest. Draco realised that Harry mustn't have been able to travel with much, before wandering into the room without his trunk. Draco started opening the drawers to find clean clothing in warm colours. "I think Kreacher must have bought you some new things Harry-" Draco whipped around to see Harry crumple into tears on his knees, heaving huge sobs. "Harry!" Draco kneeled before the boy, deciding in that moment that Harry looked tired, miserable and extremely in need of some comfort. "C'mon Potter, I've got you," pulling the smaller boy up by his arms and half dragging him into the bathroom.
"Hello, Mr. Potter. Healer Malfoy has referred you to me, stating that your retrograde amnesia has turned into something of an anterograde amnesia," Luna's voice had the same clinical tone as Draco's.
him to pack a week ago. Ginny was lounging on the couch, half in Neville's lap, feet resting on George's leg. Ginny had taken as much of Fred's space as she could in George's life. Ron and Draco tried to fill the rest with their ideas and inventiveness. Hermione felt a pang of grief. It had only been four months since the Battle of Hogwarts - as The Daily Prophet had styled it.
"The day you told me that I shouldn't presume to know anything about you or what you want in response to a cup of tea and disappeared for two days." Draco's cautious expression hurt Harry deeply.
"You're - you're alive," Harry was gripping Draco's hands as hard as he could - not that that was saying much.
There were gasps at this information - Narcissa and Draco's trials had been closed to the public, due to the information about Horcruxes being sensitive - and few knew about Harry's attempt on Draco's life.
Yes, I'm fine. Let me out of the damn bed. Why am I restrained? God, Healers are pricks. Who cares if I had internal bleeding from the blast? I'm fine now, let me go home. Well, to Hogwarts. Oh, they've called Molly in. Fuck, I feel awful. She has enough to deal with without me being her problem. I know she was upset when they wouldn't agree to let her and Arthur adopt me, just because I'm 'of age'. It's nice that she wanted to.
"My, you do get around. What is it this time - herpes, syphilis?" An angry looking matron greets him as he arrives in the Emergency Room.
Harry felt embarrassed, he was covered in filth and Draco was treating him like a small child. He tried to push Draco's hands away and Draco looked up at him, grey eyes meeting green. "Harry, let me look after you. You're exhausted." Harry bit his lip, nodding, feeling his cheeks colour at the smile Draco gave in response. Shoes and socks removed, Draco moved to help Harry with his shirt and trousers before turning and fiddling with the taps. Draco ran a pearly pink bath for Harry, the water giving off little wisps of rose coloured steam. "It's a healing bath, it'll calm you and relax your muscles and help heal the cuts." Draco turned away while Harry shucked his pants before stepping into the wonderfully hot water.
Harry just smiled and scooped a pile of eggs in his mouth, already used to their silent communication, he revelled that no one else seemed to know about Draco's talent. Molly served him a cup of tea, and Andromeda began talking again of the funeral arrangements. Harry stopped eating and it dawned on him the conversation he must have interrupted. Andy fixed him with a stern look and nudged his arm discretely to force him to continue eating. Harry dutifully finished his food, not wanting to disappoint
"I'm sure he just needs time, love. Come help me prepare the potatoes for dinner." Molly swept him off to the kitchen and kept him occupied with various side dish preparation for the next few hours.
Ron knocked half the chess pieces into Harry's lap, breaking his reverie. "Sorry mate, bit tired, y'know," Ron yawned and gathered up the pieces. Hermione had gone up to bed an hour ago, Harry was sure she was already in Ron's bed reading. Ron wandered into the dormitory towards his covered bed, followed by Harry and Draco. "Night Harry, Draco," Ron yawned while he closed his curtains behind him. Draco settled on Harry's bed and smirked at Harry, "Goodnight Ronald, and goodnight to you too, Hermione." Harry heard Ron's guffaw and then a thud and an "Ow! 'Mione!" Harry smiled, stripping his trousers and pulling on pyjama pants. He crawled into his bed while Draco adjusted the hangings, producing one of the prototype Safe & Sound orbs and suspending it from the ceiling with a flick of his wand.
"Honestly, I can't think of anything else to do with it," Draco suddenly grinned, "Finnegan, you've always been good with pyrotechnics, do me a favour and try to brew something explosive in there, will you?"
Uncharitably, Draco thought, it was his father's only true act of love towards his family, stepping between the curse and his wife while a teacher - it might have been Flitwick? - cut the Death Eater down. Draco considered that he would be the new Lord Malfoy and felt another hysterical wave in his chest. He would never see the inside of the Manor again, relief mixing with trepidation at the idea of spending the rest of his life in Azkaban. Draco knew it was what he deserved, but felt the fear of the unknown sit in his stomach.
Draco pulled his scarf tighter and huddled into his cloak. It was still bloody cold but the entire group had come to support Ginny at her trial for the Holyhead Harpies. December's frost had seemed like a summer's day compared to what January had brought with it. Draco was glad it was the middle of February, though spring seemed to be dragging its feet. Hermione shuffled closer to Draco. He was glad he'd sat next to her, she'd conjured some blue flames in a jar and it was warming him slowly.
Hermione sniffed and nodded, finally allowing Ron to lead her away without a fight. Draco flung himself into the chair she'd vacated next to Harry, hanging his violet lined cloak up on the hook beside the door.
"Hermione wasn't as nice as you are when she joined me," Harry admitted. "Plus I had Lily and Minty in my bed with me and they both kick."
Andromeda and Narcissa were already sitting together, baby Teddy in an antique looking bassinet which was rocking itself slowly beside Narcissa. "Kreacher is being hopeful the young Masters found their rooms. Kreacher is thinking that the attic might be being welcome to Master Harry after living outside, Master Harry might be missing the openness of the sky." Harry smiled wearily at Kreacher and nodded his thanks. Draco added, "It is wonderful what you've done with the house Kreacher, it feels most befitting a Noble and Ancient family such as the Blacks." Kreacher's face shone with pride as he started to serve soup to the table, small loaves of bread at each place with large pats of butter in a dish.
The bathtub reminded Harry of the Prefect's Bath, each of the taps had different coloured gems on the handles. Draco had turned on one which resulted in an aroma of honey and lavender, letting the potion glop into his hand before turning to Harry. "Duck your head under the water, I'll wash it for you." Harry obliged by dunking and looked at Draco blearily. Draco chuckled and pulled off Harry's glasses and placed them carefully on the side of the bath before bringing his other hand up to Harry's head. Long fingers immediately worked the potion into his hair, and Harry teared up at the tenderness of Draco's touch.
"What? I've never had anything like that!" Harry objects, "Please, tell me, does Draco Malfoy still work here as a trainee Healer?"
"Love, you need to sleep. Harry would be livid if he knew you were putting yourself in this position," Ron tried to reason with her.
"Perfect, now open it and-" Dawlish begins but as Harry yanks on the door of the cabinet eagerly, the force of his movement topples the cabinet over onto him.
Pansy finished asking Harry his questions and told him his choice of guy was an intelligent and cultured gentleman type. She turned to Neville and forced him to complete the quiz too. She told him his type of guy was a sporty outdoorsman, causing Ginny to cackle and ask Neville if she needed to worry. The afternoon passed with everyone completing the quiz and being teased for their results. Pansy had just turned on Draco and was trying to force him to take the quiz when Ron and Hermione burst through the door. "We found an apartment!" Hermione was glowing with happiness. "Yeah, it's not big but it's enough for me and 'Mione and can fit you lot in the living room for a party so it's just right." Everyone clamoured around the couple to congratulate them. Draco was excitedly talking to Hermione about stone bench tops, so Harry turned to Ron and punched him lovingly on the arm. "I'm happy for you mate, you and 'Mione deserve to get everything you want from life." Ron clapped him on the shoulder and turned to his bed. "Bloody hell, Luna! It looks like a flower shop blew up in my bed!"
"Harry, I know it feels like there is no way forward, but you're strong enough to recover from this," Healer Gurjeet gave him one of her 'you can do this' looks.
"Maybe in a few weeks, Teddy. Not right now," Andromeda's voice was carefully held together, but the crinkling of her nose told Draco she too was holding back tears.
Harry barely noticed the rest of the family, he only had eyes for the blonde in the hospital bed. Harry threw himself onto Draco, forgetting that he'd been sliced across his chest in his desperation to feel Draco alive in his arms. Harry felt Draco relax and then he pulled himself back to look at the only eyes that mattered in the world at this moment. Harry leaned back forward to kiss Draco. A hand rested on his cheek,
here with my son?" Narcissa's eyes were softened by the wrinkles from her frequent smiling but her flinty glare was as effective as ever.
Draco glanced at Dean and Seamus cuddled up by the fire on his way out of the Common Room. There was something that had surprised everyone except for Draco. He had actually been confused that they weren't a couple earlier than in the summer after Voldemort's defeat. Everyone seemed to be settling into relationships without fear, now that their future was guaranteed. Hermione and Ron were looking at flats for post-graduation already, Ginny and Neville were inseparable and Blaise had been delighted to find that Justin returned his attraction. Pansy was happy just to be alive and spent a lot of time talking to Harry and Luna, who had come back extremely brown from a month away in Romania with Charlie and Matias. Draco was feeling like he might actually have a decent final year.
Everyone turns to look at him, half shocked he's spoken but all nodding in agreement. Except Harry, who is furious.
Draco's chair scraped as he got up and left without excusing himself. Harry dithered for a moment before everyone's eyes turned to him and he raced out after Draco. He heard thundering steps going up the stairs and took them two at a time, coming to a halt behind Draco who was looking around Ron's old room with a disconcerted expression. Harry closed the door behind himself quietly.
"I cannot believe you're sleeping on such filthy sheets, I'll change them," she flicked her wand again, changing the bedding without him moving.
Susan gives Harry a cheesy look, "I still cannot believe you two are together, you're both so handsome. What a waste."
Draco looked around the room, Andy was pushing a stroller back and forth, assumedly containing a sleeping Teddy, Molly and Arthur Weasley were sitting in two chairs next to George, whispering to Bill and Fleur and shooting Draco grateful smiles. Kingsley was the person his mother must have been whispering to, they were sharing a chair. Draco's mouth fell open with shock. His mother and Kingsley Shacklebolt were
Harry heard another swell of noise and glanced at a group standing combatively off to the side. The light caught on silver hair, his world immediately snapping into clarity, emotions roaring into his awareness again. There were a group of Aurors and Kingsley talking to the Malfoys. He saw Malfoy - Draco - surrender the wand he held and then help his mother to stand beside him. Harry felt a shock go through his body as the realisation hit him like a Bludger - they were here to take the Malfoys away to Azkaban.
" The force of Harry's spell crushed Draco into the wall behind him, he slumped and dropped his wand.
Harry laughed at Draco's surprised expression and kissed him before tugging him over to the food table.
"You should not feel guilty, this was not your fault. You could not save him from this," Healer Gurjeet reminded him kindly.
"I hated myself. It was selfish, to fall for you so soon after Ginevra passed... But I did. I do. I love you." Draco leaned down to capture Harry in another kiss.
Narcissa moved to sit on his bed, leaning in to kiss him gently and whisper, "If you ever do that to me again, Draco, I will fucking hex you into next week." Draco squeaked his shock at his mother uttering a curse word. He clasped his hand in hers, and nodded frantically. "Draco, my love, I am so proud of you, you saved Hermione today." Narcissa shot a fond look to the sleeping brunette as she spoke loud enough for the rest of the room to hear. Draco looked to his mother and then to Kingsley, "Nott?" Kingsley frowned slightly and sighed, looking to Ron and George who were studiously looking at their shoes. "Well, after you took the hit, the rest of your friends arrived for your lunch date. Amazingly," Kingsley sounded a little sarcastic here, "they
Harry grips his wand and follows Susan Bones into the building, the senior Aurors have already cleared the dangerous ring of criminals from the building. They're here to learn crime scene processing and how to handle evidence.
Six Curse-Breakers, led by Bill Weasley, cast large detection spells over the remaining soil, but gave Harry a thumbs up after a few minutes.
"Come on, you promised I was stuck with you," Draco managed to get out before the words failed him and the tears fell.
Harry Potter grinned at Kingsley Shacklebolt as he accepted his stripes, marking him as a fully qualified Auror. Draco Malfoy, Harry's unlikely training partner, clapped politely for his colleague. Ron Weasley and Seamus Finnegan showed no restraint and whooped loudly from their seats in the civilian section.
Hermione wandered out into the weak spring sunshine, tomorrow was George's first birthday without Fred. They were having a small family party at Hogwarts with McGonagall's assistance. She had bought him a shocking turquoise velvet suit, not necessarily her style, but Pansy and Fleur had assured her George would love it when they went shopping for gifts the previous weekend. Hermione smiled as she and Draco wandered past George's new shop. Pansy and George were arguing at the door about the colour of the frontage, slashing their wands to change the colour as they debated.
Draco wasn't sure where they were going to sleep, but noticed the stairs to the attic - maybe there were more rooms? Draco wandered up to the attic floor, followed by a quiet Harry, where they found two comfortable looking bedrooms and another bathroom with a large bathtub. The tub sat under a huge window, too grand to be considered a skylight. Draco thought longingly about a luxurious bath looking out at the stars.
Scorpius Malfoy was an uncommonly kind and incredibly intelligent boy. Scorpius took one look at Harry, his face furrowed (so like his father's) and said, 'They're dead, aren't they?' Harry tried to tell him that his grandmother or father would talk to him but Albus gave Harry a glare that Molly would have been proud of and he broke down with the news. Draco collected Scorpius the next morning, leaving with his son and a permanent invitation from Ginny to come over 'whenever you need us'.
Harry shot a Breath Freshening Charm at himself and slumped into the chair, "I-I'm a monster. Luna I - I raped Ginny!"
Harry stared at the sparrow outside, "I don't know if I can. I think I died when he did. He was the first wizard I met, aside from Hagrid. It's always been him and me."
"You were pushed by the curse to act differently than how you normally would," Draco confirmed, "Not that it makes it any easier for anyone to accept. Ginevra in particular has said that she does not care."
"I don't want to cast offensive spells anymore," Neville's voice was shaky, "I don't ever want to hurt anyone again. Defence is really difficult."
Harry ran a shaking hand over Draco's jaw, "I thought you had died before I could tell you that I'm in love with you."
"My brother," Ron spoke up, "Greyback got him in sixth year. Not a full wolf, but like you, has some traits."
Harry immediately interrupted his protests, "No, please Kreacher, don't cry!" Draco placed his hand on Harry's shoulder under his collar and pushed out his Legilimency again,
Harry was helping Hermione clear up the living area when there was a crack of Apparition in the yard and Harry raced outside to find Draco standing in the yard with a bloody lip and a furious expression.
Hermione slumped back against his shoulder, "Do you think you'll ever rejoin us in the land of the living?"
Draco was slowly getting used to his new family being together in the Hogwarts setting. Nothing had really changed in their relationships. He was Hermione's study partner and academic rival, Ron's chess partner, Ginny's confidant and footstool (filling in for George) and Harry's... friend? Draco was trying to be patient but Harry still barely interacted with him. Draco was sure now that Harry had a problem with his orientation, because he grumbled frequently about Dean and Seamus sharing a bed and kissing in front of him.
The thought startled Harry into action, striding across the Great Hall towards the group. His wand held aloft like an accusing finger, Harry wordlessly dropped the restraints away from the tall boy before him. The Aurors burst into furious action and faced Harry, whipping their wands up before realising who they were opposing. Harry pushed into the group, placing his back to Draco and Narcissa, staring down the Aurors with a cold look on his face. "What are you doing?" He faced Kingsley as he asked this question, hoping their previous friendship would stop the challenge in his voice from angering the man too much.
He shifted to lean against Draco's leg and propped up his Herbology textbook on his lap and tried to continue reading about Moondew. Harry felt Draco's hand card through his hair idly and relaxed into the touch. His nightmares had been worse than ever after he hurt Draco and had been sharing a bed with him since the first night Draco was back in their dorm. Blaise had switched rooms with Harry once he and Justin started dating seriously. Harry felt a little guilty at how pleased it made him to be sharing Draco's bed again. He knew Draco would never love him back, but Harry was just happy to be close friends again.
The smoking howler the owl was carrying activated as Harry tried to stop the owl from knocking over the gravy boat. The shrill voice of Celia took Harry a moment to identify before he registered the actual words it was speaking
at the attacker. The monster wasn't satisfied at watching the boy thrown into the wall of the Hogs Head, it demanded more. Harry stormed up, hand shaking as he prepared to cast an Unforgivable Curse at this miserable human when he was suddenly wrapped in strong arms. George was murmuring to him, "C'mon, we've gotta go to Mungo's. Hermione's already taken him. The Aurors are here now, they'll take care of that fucker." Harry nodded, and allowed George to pull him away. He felt the tug of Apparition and found himself in the Spell Damage ward.
"Mum and Dad know too." Ron had stepped beside him, his arm snaking around Harry's shoulders. "They approve." Harry felt the drops slip down his cheeks and he leaned into Ron's embrace.
"You did what you could, you couldn't protect him any more than you tried to," Andromeda brushed her hand over his knee.
Hermione rolled up her sleeve and showed her 'Mudblood' scar from Bellatrix, "I shouldn't have been discriminated against because of my parents."
." Hermione elbowed Ron for his rude statement and turned to smile at Narcissa who was quietly glowing at the sight of Harry pulling back from his kiss to lean his forehead against Draco's. Hermione agreed with Ron, though less vulgarly. She felt tears prickle her eyes at her happiness that Draco was okay. Bill laughed warmly and congratulated the boys, before turning to Ron and George. "Anyone have the 31st March in the pot?" Arthur Weasley looked amused and commented, "Actually, Bill, I think you'll find it's nearly half twelve in the morning."
"Andromeda is bringing Teddy to Christmas dinner," Molly informed them on Christmas Eve, "And her nephew, as he's not anywhere else to spend it."
Nott continued his tirade, "I wasn't Marked, I ran away from the bloody fight and helped get the First Years away safely. I still had to change schools! Do you know how fucking awful Durmstrang is? Bloody miserable chunk of rock, honestly." Draco just stared at Nott, Hermione thought he looked paler than usual. "Meanwhile, you and your Death Eater-whore mother somehow wind up under the protection of The Boy Who Just Wouldn't Fucking Die." Hermione inhaled sharply at the insult to Narcissa and spoke up. "Theodore, right? Our friends are meeting us here soon. Maybe we should just go inside and get a drink and chat?"
James' bellow of pain startled Minty who burst into loud tears. The books began to shake in their shelves as Minty's upset took the form of wild magic.
Harry was breathing hard, eyes darting around the room furiously before his eyes fixed back onto Draco. "You - were - dead," Harry's voice was croaky from his dry throat.
"I don't know, Harry. I know for you this is new, shocking information. For the people you've hurt it's been five years of constant cruelty on your behalf," Luna replied.
Harry chugged down the rest of his drink and met Andromeda's knowing gaze. Narcissa and Andromeda would never be so childish as to name a group 'Phoenix Team' but he didn't doubt they encouraged the antics.
Hermione's head snapped up at Harry's shouted declaration, she knew it meant he was quickly losing control of his temper - and therefore his magic. She could feel it in the air, thicker than the dust still rising from the ruined castle. Harry had slipped away from them during the armistice, but she had suspected that he'd go to see Dumbledore's portrait for guidance. Hermione and Ron had entered the office too late to catch up with Harry, seeing the glowing Pensieve, Hermione had drawn her own conclusions and pushed her head into the liquid.
"About three years ago you became aware of your former relationship with Ginevra Weasley. You proceeded to get her completely intoxicated on Firewhiskey and fucked her on the lounge in the flat she and I owned. I would say it takes two to tango but I don't believe her blood-alcohol level allowed her to consent properly. I returned home to find you both drunk and entangled, still naked. Unfortunately, her and my relationship was unable to recover," Luna turned away from Harry at this point.
Harry was shocked to see Hermione, Ron, Bill, Fleur, George, Teddy, James (holding Minty), Scorpius, Albus, Lily, Rose and Hugo all look up in delight. Harry hissed to Charlie, "How many people
"No. I love you, I have been yours for a long time. Maybe longer than I realised at first," Draco's nose was brushing Harry's now.
Charlie looked a bit abashed but his creeping grin stole across his face, "Well, most of us, but Phoenix Team actively are trying to help you."
Hermione left with the children, James couldn't be separated from Minty and Draco passed over the one year old's nappy bag to Hermione to take with her. Draco remained, sitting beside Harry and reading him the finance pages from the Evening Prophet.
"Aberforth," Draco shook his head, "Cast the Killing Curse on her as she turned into a wolf. Aurors didn't charge him, as he was defending his and my life. They took Mother to St. Mungo's, but it was an old Russian curse. They couldn't track down the cure in time."
"You always make dinner and never let Father clean up. You always bring home flowers for Father when he's had a success at work. Oh, you look at him like you want to eat him!" Scorpius listed gleefully.
Harry followed Ginny to where she had indicated, he stared at Hermione and Ron over her head for support. Hermione heard Ginny's voice crack as she started talking, she had barely spoken since the fighting ended, "Harry, I... You have to understand, I thought we were going to die. I spent all this time thinking I'd never see you again, while trying to keep these students safe with Nev and..." She trailed off and looked at Neville, he stood tall while talking to Professor McGonagall, his grandmother's hand on his shoulder.
Draco turned to Harry who quickly shot out his stag Patronus and sent it soaring past the large circle of witches and wizards who surrounded the Manor, signalling the beginning.
Feeling someone against his side, Harry dismissed the notion and tried to identify the body beside him. Flaming hair told him it was a Weasley, but it took several moments before Harry could recognise that it was Charlie, pulling Harry to his feet and over to his family. Except they didn't feel like his family anymore, Harry didn't deserve to share in their grief. In the midst of his haze, Harry wondered if Ginny would want to resume their relationship. He felt a brief moment of
"I'll be by with dinner later, something healthy but comforting," Molly promised. She brushed a kiss to his temple and headed back out the door. Harry heard his front door slam as he slumped back against his pillows.
" ripped her and Draco's wands from their pockets. Hermione whipped her head around, suspecting it was a joke by Harry. She was stopped when she realised the man who had thrown her wand aside wasn't anyone familiar. Draco must have recognised him because he swore and breathed out, "Nott?" Hermione looked closer, recognising the young man who had never spoken a word to her in six years.
Harry smirked to himself, it wouldn't surprise him if Ron did propose. He and Hermione had been sneaking her into his bed every night since the start of term. Harry wasn't sure why they bothered sneaking, Neville, Draco and Harry didn't care at all. Harry sighed and closed his textbook. He was getting tired. Ron took Draco's queen and called checkmate. Draco stood, stretching out his long arms, exposing a stretch of his flat abdomen. Harry felt himself stare at the skin like it was an
Harry didn't reply, he just leaned against Draco carefully. He felt the firm press of Draco's shoulder against his and they settled in to watch the game in comfortable silence.
"Draco swore me to secrecy when I noticed how he looked at you. You were still grieving and it was only just past the first anniversary of Ginevra's death. He held out hope that you would come to care for him too but when the Prophet started talking about your relationship with your assistant at the foundation-"
"Because I thought I would lose you if I told you. I thought I would lose you until last night when your mum told me I would lose you if I
"Are you two still bickering over who loves who more?" Dean Thomas had accepted his stripes and plonked down next to Harry.
Hermione turned to Kingsley, "Sir, what is going on?" Kingsley cast a cautious glance at Harry before fixing Hermione with a knowing look, "We were attempting to take Voldemort's soldiers into custody to await justice-" Harry hissed in response to his words, "but Harry feels that Mr. Malfoy and Mrs. Malfoy should not be included in the arrests." Hermione turned back to Harry and then considered the two figures behind him. Hermione knew it would be easy to be angry at them and blame them for the evils she had experienced in their home, but the pleading in Harry's eyes gave her resolve to speak with forgiveness.
"I'm good, Gramma. I just want to hug Uncle Harry. I missed him," Teddy buried his black hair into Harry's shoulder.
"Here, dear, have some food," Molly placed a covered plate with some muffins down on Harry's side table, Draco picking at one to appease her.
"Teddy, love, be careful," Andromeda admonished. Harry's six year old godson was crammed into Harry's side, clinging to him resolutely.
Ron held Hermione close to his side and had his other arm wrapped around Harry, "Mate, we'll come over in a day or so, once you're all settled and er..." he looked to Hermione, unsure. Hermione finished for him, "We'll bring the family over and talk it out, okay? If you've chosen to bring the Malfoys into the family, we will support your judgement." Harry nodded and waved goodbye as he headed back to the Malfoys and Andromeda.
"Our thoughts exactly," Draco smiled shyly at Neville, he took the longest to come around to Draco's acceptance into their group of friends.
Harry felt Draco's hand tighten around his wrist and felt a push in his mind, startled, Harry turned and looked Draco full in the eye before words came whispering into his head.
Harry shrugged, feeling her hair move against his cheek as he did, "It's normal to be depressed like this. My partner died saving me. Healer Gurjeet says I'm doing well, all things considered."
"Okay, I wanna play with Jamie and Teddy." Minty scrabbled down to the floor and ran off to demand attention from the young men.
"Harry, you've been very taciturn since we got back from Australia. I know you thought we hadn't noticed, but we're worried about you." Harry bristled, they were talking about him again. "Harry James Potter, the
Arthur placed a hand on Harry's shoulder, causing Harry to jump. Arthur seemed to be saying something but Harry couldn't hear him over the deafening sound of his pulse. "Mr. Weas- Arthur, I can't, I'm sorry..." Harry couldn't put into words his discomfort. He felt that he was intruding and it tore at him like claws through flesh. Arthur pulled him close and pressed his chin to Harry's forehead, "Go, find us when you're ready, son." Harry felt Arthur release him and stumbled away blinded by his hot tears.
Draco and Harry had dressed in comfortable silence, both wearing soft pyjama bottoms and comfortable sweaters they had found in Harry's room. The pants were a little short on Draco's longer legs, but it was warm at Grimmauld Place. Harry looked dead on his feet, so Draco took his hand and led him back downstairs. Draco thought the kitchen must be in the basement, as they hadn't passed it before. His eyes widened appreciatively in the kitchen doorway, a long polished wooden table shone, while the room exuded warmth, from the candelabra that lit the room to the large fireplace.
Harry rolled off his couch and landed on the floor with a 'whump'. "I'm 'wake, 'Mione. What's going on?"
Draco stepped into the entry hall at Grimmauld Place and instantly thought he had arrived to the wrong house. It was all light wood and bright fixtures. He immediately slammed into the back of Harry, who had stopped to gape at his hallway. "So, I take it your reaction means you weren't expecting this either?" Harry drifted through the doors to his left, Draco followed him into a wonderfully warm sitting room, complete with a wall of books and a fireplace. "Wow, er, Kreacher?" Kreacher appeared beside them with a crack, "Yes, Master Harry?" Harry looked at Kreacher like he was unsure how to word his feelings, and promptly dropped to his knees and hugged the ancient Elf tightly, "Thank you, I can't believe you did all of this."
Harry's apparent resurrection had birthed in Hermione a new respect for the magic of life itself. After watching Voldemort fall, she was determined to never allow hatred to shape the world again. She suppressed a small smile, she knew they were going to be grieving for months for all they had lost today, but she knew it meant that they actually had a future in which to grieve. A whole future with Ron and Harry and their families.
"Mr. Harry Potter is being thinking Winky trying to harm him?" Winky's eyes filled with tears. "Winky is never being hurting Mr. Harry Potter, sir, Mr. Harry Potter is a great friend to elves - "
Harry looked over at Hermione, she was casting diagnostic charms over the Marauder's Map. Hermione was trying to replicate the spell work for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. She and Kingsley had had an idea for Aurors to use something similar on building blueprints when they were conducting raids. If she could make it work, it would reduce casualties in the Auror Department considerably. Hermione dropped her wand, exclaiming, "Harry!" He moved to look over her shoulder, Draco Malfoy was in a small classroom, surrounded by younger students from Slytherin. Harry frowned, puzzled, Draco had barely interacted with anyone younger from his house since they had come back. Ron leapt out of his armchair and grabbed the map, gesturing to Neville while Hermione picked up her wand and followed them out of the Common Room. Harry hurried along beside Hermione, he felt nervous about what they might find.
Harry melted a little more into the comforting bubbles. Draco continued cleansing Harry of the dirt and blood quietly. Harry wouldn't have believed he could feel so safe and comfortable in a bathtub with Draco Malfoy. He suddenly worried that he was pushing past seven years of animosity without considering that Draco might turn on him. Harry pushed the negative thought away, Voldemort and Lucius were the catalysts for their antagonism, and both were dead now.
Harry poured the first memory in the Pensieve, dunking his head in and falling into a consultation room.
"Are you two seeking to ruin the tranquility of the village or do you just like the sound of your own voices?" Draco's cheeky drawl drew George's attention. "Drake, mate, please tell your friend here how incredibly incorrect she is. I keep telling her that Fred came to me in a dream and told me to make the shop acid yellow." Draco scowled at George, though it was without any real menace, "Call me Drake again and I'll hex you acid yellow in the name of Fred Weasley's honour." George laughed at Draco's statement and Pansy took the opportunity to flick her wand and change the frontage to a peppy blood-orange.
Lucius was covered in grime, the blood matting his clothes and hair barely of consequence as Draco silently observed him. Years blindly following this man's lead, trusting Father to know best. Now he was dead, laying on a dirty floor like a spider someone had swatted away carelessly. Draco felt a bubble of hysterical laughter form in his chest and squashed it down. While the Dark Lo- Voldemort was being dealt with by Potter, a furious Death Eater had cast a curse towards Narcissa, deducing she had lied to their Lord about Potter being dead.
Harry was on Draco's left side, an arm slung around Draco's shoulders and Luna leaning into his other side. Draco smiled as the breeze ruffled Harry's messy hair. Harry finally seemed comfortable with Draco's sexuality, they'd been closer than ever since Christmas. Draco thumbed the band of the ring on his right hand through his glove, Harry had gifted Draco with a new signet ring, replacing the one he'd destroyed to hand the Manor over to the Ministry. A handsome platinum ring with an engraved dragon decorating the face, it was Draco's most prized possession now.
"Shut up, Potter. Firstly, you never sit with your back to the door. Ever. Secondly, she wasn't aiming for you. She shot you with a cutting curse before casting Pandora's Downfall at Ginevra - it only works on women." Draco's eyes were steel, his steady gaze ending any rebuttal Harry prepared.
"You may not remember it, but I do. You heard about your two year old godson and told us in no uncertain terms you didn't want anything to do with him," Andromeda scowls, "He has no memory of you. As far as he knows, Ronald and Draco are his godparents."
Harry had no words of comfort, so he let go of Draco's hand and wrapped his arms around him instead. Draco leaned into Harry's chest, sobbing quietly as the tears spilt over. Harry felt stinging at his own eyes and let the tears fall. Tears for the pain that he and Draco had been through, tears for the loved ones they lost, tears for the loss of their childhoods.
Draco flushed pink and his grip tightened on Harry's wrist. "Shut up, Potter. I'll take the night off but don't think I'm dropping this 'Phoenix Team' nonsense."
Harry's eyes filled with tears, "I was the one who was dying? But I remember everything - Hermione and Ron sleeping here, Healer Gurjeet?"
Draco was not prepared for Harry's body to arc up off the bed like it was possessed before slumping back into the mattress.
"Sometimes I wish I hadn't survived," Harry ventured, "Because then I wouldn't have had to deal with the pain."
"No, I woke up in bed with some bloke with red hair and tattoos who wasn't you and I panicked and tried to work out what had happened," Harry flinched again at admitting his infidelity.
Except Molly. She's still holding my hand and crying over Hermione. She doesn't deserve to cry anymore. I'd give anything to make Molly's family whole again. Hey, Andromeda has arrived. Oof, Teddy is getting heavier. I love you, Teddy. I'm going to be the godfather we both deserved to have. I'm going to do everything I know Sirius wished he could have. I will keep you safe, I will love you, I will make sure your life is nothing like mine.
Harry was completely distracted from his devastation, "Er, are you two...?" Kingsley spoke, "We were having lunch in my office when Ron's Patronus delivered the news." Harry nodded, not caring for more information before he tucked himself into Cissa's arms. "I was too late to help him, I'm so sorry." Narcissa smoothed a hand down his shirt, "He sacrificed his safety for his friend, Harry. If Draco was forced to take that action, I don't know that there were any other options." Hermione let out another sob behind him, Harry turned and dropped on his knee in front of her. "He's going to be fine, 'Mione. He survived Tom Riddle in his house."
Draco felt his heart clench for this boy, this man, who had clearly never been loved like he should have been in his life. Draco felt a cold rush of shame, he had tormented Harry with his loveless, parentless existence for years.
"Have a good afternoon, Potter," Draco smiled and let their hands drop. Harry missed the feeling immediately and shook it off as needing comfort after the difficult afternoon.
Draco smiled and pulled Harry back into his chest, Harry swung his legs up onto the bed and curled into his side. "I'm sorry I've been so angry since you got back from Australia with 'Mione. I think I felt left out, er, from you and 'Mione becoming such good friends." Draco frowned, he hadn't considered that it was his friendship with Hermione that Harry had been upset about. Draco pulled Harry tight, squeezing him and slipping his hand onto the bare skin at Harry's hip where his jumper rode up.
Harry surfaced from his nightmare about Sirius's death, gasping like a fish out of water. His bed was soaked in sweat and his body was shivering from the cold.
Harry felt Ron's calloused hand surrounding his, squeezing his fingers. "I love you and 'Mione, Ron. I'll always be here."
Draco was watching incredulously as he watched Harry Potter drag his mother across the Great Hall towards her estranged sister. He had jumped when he had first seen her, only to relax once he saw the baby in her arms - no way that Bellatrix would ever hold a child willingly. His mind was still reeling with all that had occurred in the last few minutes, so he joined the odd trio a few minutes later. Harry had let go of Mother's hand in order to take the bundle from his aunt - Andromeda, he recalled.
. Draco had never seen his mother do something as plebeian as perch on the arm of someone else's chair, much less in front of a crowd of people. Everyone had noticed that Draco was awake and were whispering congratulations and well wishes, trying not to wake the two girls sleeping in the corner. Kingsley waved his wand, sending a feline Patronus off like a wisp of wind.
"Lied, cheated, drank yourself to death, beat me, took advantage of Ginny, hurt Hermione and Ron beyond repair, manipulated me," Draco listed tonelessly.
"Sorry, sorry, shhh. I'm sorry," Harry took Winky's wrinkled hand, "Sorry, I'm just tired and I couldn't remember what mallow-sweet is."
When Harry returned - in clean pyjamas - Draco had clearly tried to spell the sheets clean as best he could.
"Morning, Mr. Potter! Oh, hello Mr. Malfoy, beat me here. No changes?" Healer Gurjeet nodded at the medi-witch taking readings from Harry's vitals, who shook her head sadly.
"Draco, come for a walk with me?" Harry stood up and jerked his head towards the back door. He grabbed his coat and Draco's before they stepped outside into the wintry air.
Draco signed the waiver he was handed and Marcie removed the supporting charms keeping Harry's heart beating.
"If you don't wish for me to get fired for hexing you senseless, you'll leave," Susan storms away from him.
Harry felt a wave of possessiveness roar in his chest as Draco rested his forehead against Pansy's. Harry stormed up to the Slytherins, before realising Pansy was wringing her hands and weeping. Harry felt relieved that Zabini had a claiming hand on her waist. "H-Harry, I'm so, so sorry. I was so scared, we were going to die and he wanted one person and I just... He was so-" Pansy sniffled and shook her head like she was clearing away a Billywig and resumed, "I apologise for my behaviour. Draco has told us how you've protected him and I never thought you could do that for someone like us."
"Draco, what the hell is happening? I remember being hit with some red light yesterday and I wake up this morning and there's some man in my bed - I am so sorry, I have no idea but I think I cheated on you. I went to Hermione and Ron's but apparently the witch there had been there for years but we were there on Sunday for brunch. Ginny hates me and I'm not an Auror and you finished your Healer training?" Harry had started to tear up again.
Draco hadn't returned in the afternoon with Narcissa, who told Harry Draco needed some time and went to put her granddaughter down for a nap. James and Teddy took charge of all the cousins and arranged a pick up match of Quidditch with Ron, George and Charlie. Percy acted as referee, he was the only member of the family who would know all the rules and would have no bias (even to his own daughters).
"No permanent damage, Mr. Malfoy. You were quite lucky, the barb shot straight through your back before it could pump the venom sac. You can go home today," Healer Gurjeet gave him a weary smile.
"A lot." Draco's hand was in his and a wry look on his face, "I get it. I've been seeing a Mind Healer for the last six months. Especially after the bomb... I only stayed at school because Professor McGonagall asked me to not let the bastard win."
"I need to know what I've done, I can't live my life in ignorance while the rest of you have these awful memories," Harry hoped she understood.
"We gotta... go downstairs. Before our first time is on Ron's bed." Harry bit his swollen lip and pushed Draco back to open the door.
"It's not surprising that with everything you've heard about yourself recently," Luna seemed more kind, "you've become depressed."
"HARRY!" Hermione whipped her wand on him after she had taken care of the last attacker, "What were you thinking?!" She rushed to Draco's side, casting spell after spell over his chest, before Levitating Draco carefully to transport him. Harry could feel panic rushing in his mind, when he stared at Draco's limp body he could barely see his chest move. "I - I reacted. He was casting at me..." Hermione looked at him with an expression that ran his blood cold, "He was blindfolded, injured and afraid. What the hell is your excuse?" Hermione drifted Draco carefully into the hall, followed by Neville, who shot Harry a loaded look before rushing after her. "Mate," Ron looked at him like Harry had disappointed him. He supposed he had. "Mate, might be best if you head to McGonagall. Give her the heads up on this lot," gesturing to the knocked out students on the floor. Ron ran after his girlfriend, leaving Harry to an overwhelming sense that he had just decimated his family in one moment.
"I will kill you, leave now or I'll do it, our friendship has nothing left for you to salvage," Ginny spits, her eyes narrowed with hate.
"I've been told that the last five years have been," Harry cast around for the words, "dreadful? Because of me."
. He thought the words gleefully, trying not to feel guilty about the despair he should be feeling while funerals were being discussed.
George had been silent for most of the planning, but stood bolt upright and stared down at Draco with a wild look on his face. Harry started for his wand, ready to put up a shield charm, before catching Draco's eye. Draco shook his head minutely and turned to face George. "You! You're, you! You were good at Potions!" Draco looked confused at George's outburst and nodded, "Er, yes. I earned an Outstanding on my Potions O.W.L. I hope to earn the same on my N.E.W.T. if we get a chance to sit them." George nodded maniacally, "Yes, and you swore allegiance to the Weasleys, did you mean it?" Draco stood and gracefully bowed, "Of course, how can I be of service?" George grabbed him by his arm and yanked him out of the kitchen, "Malfoy, you better be comfortable with hellebore!"
Harry sighed and rested his head on Draco's shoulder, wrapping his arms around Draco's left arm. He ran a finger over one of the scars closest to Draco's wrist. "Have I said that I am sorry yet today?" Draco rolled onto his side, pulling Harry closer with his right arm. Harry felt a cool hand slip under his jumper.
"We'd better get downstairs soon, or they'll all know what we were up to." Draco cast a wandless cleaning spell over the both of them and tucked his shirt back in.
Draco felt a bolt of amusement at Harry's enthusiasm as he watched the boy throw his arms around Mother, trying not to laugh at her shock over Harry's exuberant affection. "Harry," Narcissa quietly assured him, "You are part of our family now and for us Blacks, family is
Harry clung to Draco with shaking hands, allowing the medi-witch to force feed him Pepper Up, followed by Insta-Hydrate and a nutritional potion.
"At least he came back?" Hermione's words drew Harry and Molly to both give her a look of disdain before returning to the warmth of the house.
Kingsley considered the position Harry had taken with something of a smile around his eyes, before his deep voice provided calmly, "Harry, we must take the remaining of Voldemort's forces to Azkaban, where they will await trial by the Wizengamot." Harry felt a hand on his wrist, he barely turned his head before he realised it was Draco and simply turned away. "Not these two." One of the other Aurors - Proudfoot, Harry recognised - started to explain with more irritation, "Look, Potter, Harry, they will be tried fairly-", before he was cut off with Harry's raised voice. "I said.
"You looked remarkably well suited to the dress. Ginevra... She made it okay for me to be sad, to be angry, to rage at the misfortune and unfairness of it all." Draco looked rather fond for a moment before his smile dropped, "We all lost a remarkably bright light in her. The world is a little poorer for her not being in it."
"Sometimes," Draco whispered back, "But my Mind Healer says that the war was not my fault and I should only feel guilty if I don't learn from the mistakes I made."
"I cannot believe you're sleeping on such filthy sheets - I'll change them," Molly flicked her wand at the makeshift bed Draco had arranged against the wall. George had smuggled in a Muggle camping cot that Arthur had in the back shed.
"Better? Even after thirty years it's like you forget that you're a wizard sometimes." Draco's smile tugged at Harry's heart and he stopped them. "Harry?"
"Doesn't matter, what matters is you've finally realised if you don't tell him you're going to lose him." Hermione crossed her arms and put her best 'Minister of Magic' face on.
so the loud boom of the cracker wouldn't upset the baby. Hermione pulled hard and came away with the cracker, winning a pair of glittering reindeer horns on a headband that had luminescent flowers and, oddly, small Kneazles decorating the band. She also won a small sewing kit with Self-Threading Needles and Many Coloured Thread that matched whatever garment you were sewing. Hermione smiled, it would be useful to have in her and Ron's new apartment. They had been going over a list of locations where they would want to live after graduation. Hermione's smile faded, she wondered if whatever was bothering Ron was going to impact their relationship so badly they wouldn't be living together.
Harry had realised when Draco opened his bedroom drawers that there were clothes in there. Kreacher had known Harry had been running for his life for the last year and had made sure if Harry came home there'd be clean, warm clothing. Harry felt incredibly vulnerable at the small gesture. He was finally safe. He felt his fear, sadness, hunger and fatigue overwhelm him. He barely heard Draco over his sobs, he felt strong hands wrench him up by his underarms and arms wrap around him. He was promptly placed down on something solid and cool, Harry found that Draco had sat him on the bathtub and was gently removing his shoes and socks.
"The ring was found by Draco when he went to clear out your desk," Andromeda told him, "It was after the first time he caught you cheating."
"Draco and Narcissa Malfoy should not be taken into custody, they were merely family members of a Death Eater, one who, I will remind you, had no wand for the better part of the last year. Lucius and Narcissa didn't take part in the battle, and Draco was a scared student, trying to keep himself alive." Harry was staring at Hermione with a look of wonder on his face, but his astonishment was soon turned to Ron, "'Mione is right. Mrs. Malfoy didn't do anything, she just married the wrong kind of bloke, and Malfoy was just a dumb kid doing what his dad said to." Hermione felt pride welling in her chest at the mature statement Ron had made - even with his dig at Draco.
Celia was thirteen years younger than Draco and was a trainer for the Wimbourne Wasps. Celia was pleasant enough to Harry but had already started to hint to Draco that perhaps it might be time for a new living arrangement. Albus, Scorpius and Lily had arrived home from Hogwarts just a few days prior and were all refusing to speak to Celia after overhearing one of these loaded suggestions. James had met Celia a few times and dismissed her based on the Quidditch team she worked for and Minty copied everything James did.
He heard Charlie's rough voice whisper to his mother, "I've got him Mum, Harry's here, he's safe." Molly looked like she'd been Kissed by a Dementor, all her warmth and love had been eaten by her grief. Harry mumbled his condolences, clutching his hands into his filthy jumper. Percy was holding George tight against his chest, trying to contain his wordless anguish. Bill and Fleur clung to each other as though they were still bracing for death. Hermione was on her knees at Fred's side with Ron, who looked like he too had died in the battle.
"Congratulations on finishing your traineeship," Harry's voice was rough, "I'm sorry I wasn't there to see it."
Healers came and pulled Narcissa aside to get permission for various treatments and Harry found himself staring at the room where Aurors had taken Nott. Harry heard one of the Healers tell Narcissa that Draco's liver and kidney had been damaged and he gripped his wand tightly, shaking with anger. A knowing Kingsley told him that if he liked he could stand guard at the door where Nott was being treated. Harry slumped against the wall opposite the door and held his wand ready. If Nott managed to take down the Aurors, Harry would finish him as soon as he stepped into the hall.
Harry stood when the healer did, he automatically reached for Draco - to comfort, to apologise, to something - but he withdrew his hand and turned to Narcissa instead. He promised to keep Scorpius as long as they needed; he would key them into the wards so they could collect him at any time. Harry returned home, drained and desperate to curl into Ginny's reassuring embrace, only to find Albus and Scorpius sitting in the living room waiting for him.
Hermione joined in the conversation with her own suggestions and she and Draco spent fifteen minutes chatting with Pansy and George. "We're supposed to meet Harry and Ron at the Hogs Head in about ten minutes, would you like to join us?" George and Pansy agreed and popped back into the building to grab their things, telling Hermione to head on without them. Draco chattered about parchment thickness for the duration of their walk to the pub, Hermione providing her own input on ink saturation.
Hermione thought the street was rather quiet for a Friday, she frowned, surely this was unusual? Her instinct was proven accurate just a few moments later when an "
Hermione saw the flinch in Draco's face as the matriarch reached out, before he stiffened and offered her the baby to hold. She took the bundle before staring back at him and asked, "Lucius?" "Dead." "Your mother?" "With Aunt Andromeda." "You?" "I'm not Marked, so we're free to go, but..." Draco had trailed off, Hermione watched Harry take his hand and squeeze -
"Actually, yes," Ginny took Neville's arm and Disapparated them away. Ron stared at the spot where his sister had been and paled, allowing Hermione to resume her conversation with Kingsley.
Harry's wails startle the witch into action, she hikes him up in a rather firm grip on his elbow and drags him off into a consultation room, "Wait here."
Hermione giggled as Harry turned to look at the room with horror, "You lot were betting on us and when we'd get together?" Fleur spoke up, "Well, 'Arry, not all of us are tactless imbéciles 'oo bet on true love. Some of us are just unfortunate enough to be married to zem." She gave Bill a sharp look, Bill laughed and pulled her into a kiss. Draco commented slyly, "You know, Fleur, I'm hurt that all the times you tried to talk me into confessing my love to Harry were trying to help Bill win a bet." Fleur looked horrified and protested, Hermione saw Draco's amused smirk and knew he wasn't serious. "Chérie je te crois." Fleur relaxed at whatever Draco had said, offering him an affectionate smile. "Draco, I am 'appy your cœur belongs to such a worthy man." Ron protested, "Alright, that's enough French. You could be giving us the meaning of life right now and we'd have no clue what you're on about."
"So, the curse took all memories of your life, for exactly five years. Upon waking this morning, an assumed time release on the curse expired and you regained your memories of the day you were cursed and everything proceeding. Nothing since then?" Draco's voice was clinical.
Hermione watched the barely concealed hurt on Draco's face at Harry's rejection. Ginny met her gaze and rolled her eyes dramatically. Nearly everyone in the family had worked out how those two felt about each other just by watching them watch each other. Ron and his brothers had a - heavily disapproved of - betting pool about when they'd realise and get together. Bill had bet on Christmas Day, to everyone's laughter and mocking. Charlie had Valentine's Day - which was met with as much scoffing as Bill's choice. Fleur had disparaged her husband and his family's sense of romance heavily in French for betting on the love of two innocent boys. Fleur had taken to Draco, Cissa and Andy immediately, the four of them gabbing away in French quite often. Hermione knew Fleur had tried to convince Draco to take a chance on telling Harry. Draco remained convinced that Harry was angry at him for being gay. Ron flew past with a cauldron and knocked over a table lamp. Hermione scowled, she was very annoyed indeed.
Draco was very upset with Harry when he met him at the Burrow with the children, but he was mollified by James' mortified recounting of the entire story (with some key details removed).
"I can't sit with fires in smaller rooms. At least in the Great Hall, it is away from me," Draco murmured, "I don't like fire."
"All of it. Me being awful about you being an orphan, me being awful about the Weasley family," Draco sighed, "Here I am, an orphan on Christmas, welcomed with open arms by the Weasley family for dinner."
Harry was ejected from the memory as it ended, gasping as he sprawled back on his buttocks. He grabbed another green vial and tipped it into the Pensieve, forcing his head into it again.
She was drawn out of her musings by the ground of the Hall shaking under her feet. Unsteady while getting up, she felt Ron pull on her sleeve as he stood with her, his strong arm wrapping around her waist as they moved across the trembling earth to Harry. She felt the wild magic under his skin as she took his right hand, the magic easing when her thumb ran over his clenched fist. Harry turned, fury clear on his face as he looked at Hermione, but the ground stilled slowly after a moment as his face smoothed out again.
Dinner was an uncomfortable affair for Harry. Draco was back to his polite and charming self (Audrey having fixed Draco's bruised and bloodied mouth while they watched the Quidditch game) to everyone except Harry. Harry was picking at a Yorkshire pudding when a pile of greens appeared on his plate. Harry looked up to catch Draco holding the spoon that applied the greens, his conversation with Percy on applications of lilac in Replenishing Potion uninterrupted by the action. Harry didn't allow himself a smile but ate the greens with gusto.
Draco had dropped his head onto his hands as soon as the words, 'I am so sorry for your loss' exited the healer's mouth. She went on to explain that they could keep Astoria's body functioning long enough to make the pregnancy viable. Draco hadn't acknowledged the news that his daughter could survive, provided his wife's body was kept animated for another five to ten weeks. Narcissa murmured that they would discuss it and provide an answer to the healer in one hour.
Harry sat down on the stool beside the stove with his head in his hands and sighed heavily, "He's happy with her."
"I'm on leave, 'Mione. I'm allowed to sleep in as much as I like," Harry grumbled from his spot on the floor.
Harry glanced over and met Draco's eyes before looking away. Draco's heart fell, Harry had been distant since he and Hermione came back from Australia. He didn't
"I'm not sure actually - she could have been talking about V-Voldemort or the idiot who sent the bomb," Draco smiled gently, "But when I woke up at St. Mungo's she was sitting next to me, fiddling with knitting needles and muttering about 'assholes endangering her school again'."
