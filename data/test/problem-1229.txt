Harry looked over to Draco, to see him clean, and following along, he flicked his wrist silently cleaning himself as well. The healer behind him still looked at him in awe that a- he looked towards the staff table and spotted Horace- 6th year could do wandless
“-I mean there's literally no telling how long they have left, maybe we should, I don't know, GET TO WORK?”
, Harry wants to scream but he manages to bite his tongue and just lets out a half-sob and turns back around and shuffles back to his room. He throws himself face down on his bed and puts the pillow over his head, muffling Hedwig’s hoots and his dads murmured voices from the kitchen, and before long, he’s dozed off again.
”Potter, eat up already!” Flint says and stands up suddenly. ”That goes for the rest of you as well. Warm-up in fifteen minutes!”
”Salazar”, Professor Snape tells the paving stone between the last two torches and immediately the wall begins to rearrange itself until a doorway has been created, and Severus gestures for Harry to enter first.
”It won’t do you any good that they can beat a bludger hard enough to break both broom and limbs, if they’re too stupid to aim it
Harry recoils in fear as the pink-haired witch suddenly grows a beak and lurches forward, about to strike…
”…just going to carry it around and not even use it… could just give it someone else then, what’s the point of having it if you’re not even—”
Harry keeps brooding over it for the rest of the lesson, but finally forgets about it again as they make their way to the next lesson. It’s their first new subject of the year — Divination — and if the long trek up the North Tower wasn’t enough to distract him, the gloomy, incense-heavy classroom surely is.
Harry feels a sinking sense of disappointment, but claps his hands dutifully. Some of his fellow Slytherins promptly puts their hands in their laps in pure protest however and simply glower at the grinning Hufflepuff, and even the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws applause is lukewarm, but it’s barely even noticeable as every single person at the Hufflepuff table jumps to their feet and shout themselves hoarse, clapping furiously and stamping their feet so loudly Dumbledore’s shouted
”You can’t just say something like that!” Draco says, scowling at her and despite everything, Harry’s heart leaps in his chest.
”How are you feeling, daddy?” Harry asks apprehensively as they take their seats around the kitchen table. ”I was going to visit you, but Professor Snape told me you weren’t at the school…”
But obviously Professor Snape has no interest in standing back and simply observing as someone else teaches, so it’s hardly a mystery that he hovers at Diggory’s shoulder, just itching to jump in and take over.
”I’m sorry…” Sirius murmurs and reaches out to cover the other man’s hand with his own. ”I’ll make sure to be home for dinner.”
He cuts himself off suddenly and takes a quick, deep breath. Harry frowns, sure he saw the man’s dark eyes flicker over to him for a split second.
He moves as quickly and quietly as possible through the corridor and as soon as he reaches the spiral stairs leading up from the dungeons he starts running, but stumbles almost immediately and nearly goes flying back down again. Swearing silently to himself, he kicks off his slippers and starts up the stairs again and as soon as he reaches the top landing he begins running for real, thudding to a stop only when he reaches the bottom of the marble staircase… Suddenly he hears voices and approaching footsteps and he wheels around in panic, scanning the Entrance Hall… It’s coming from outside, he realises and just as the thought has occurred to him, he can see the door handle begin to turn.
A deafening silence rings out in the dorm after he trails off, suddenly stomped out as Malfoy’s voice cuts through it harschly; the next thing Harry knows, the back of his head explodes in pain and he crumbles to the floor.
”What is she even doing here?” Harry asks one of the twins in an undertone, as the others begin to set up the game.
He sits down and lets his legs dangle over the edge, then looks over his shoulder at Draco who is standing as though petrified just inside the door.
Dumbledore goes on to explain about the three tasks of the Tournament, all of which have been pre-approved and prepared for by Mr Bagman and Mr Crouch, but the three champions — one from each of the participating schools — will be chosen by an impartial selector… Harry frowns at the chest, wondering if the impartial selector is inside the chest or if the chest itself is somehow in possession of such abilities, like the Sorting Hat…
”I don’t know what all Professor Snape might have done to you before that day, but I can’t think of anything that would warrant that treatment — How would you feel”, he ploughs on stubbornly, before Sirius has a chance to retort and the man snaps his mouth shut again moodily. ”If someone did that to me? If I sat here and told you that yesterday at school, I was sitting outside working on a homework essay and before I knew what had happened, I was hanging upside in the air, and then Crabbe and Goyle came over and started taunting me, humiliating me in front of everyone and they all laughed at me… You would be out of your seat before I finished talking, halfway up to the castle ready to hex the pair of them—”
Harry cringed. He did remember that- it had not been a good time in his life. He’d been on his second break from Auror training, after Ron had dropped out, and Hermione had been… not well. Her depression had her barely getting out of bed, and Harry and Ron had been sort of caring for her in shifts, except then Harry’s anxiety had spiralled out of control, so it had just been him and Hermione staying in and not doing anything, her out of apathy and him out of intense fear. Ron had been their rock- and as such, he’d tried to keep the talk of Harry Potter Day to a minimum, because he knew how much it upset Harry. He remembered the run up to that event, but only through a cloud of stress and anxiety. It really had not been a good year.
Putting this out of his mind, Harry stepped onto the front steps of Grimmauld Place and apparated to work.
“Well, fuck,” said Harry, to the empty corridor. At least the brown of his robes would hide the stain.
The strangeness of it was enough to break him out of his panic. The war was over- Voldemort was dead, and the Malfoys hadn’t done anything in years. He knew- he still sometimes snuck into the archives to look at their files while at work.
“Oh,thank Merlin,” he said, once he managed to close his gaping mouth. “Oh, Rowena, I know , sweetheart, I was worried too. Chrysanthemum is a naughty girl, isn’t she? Running away and scaring us like that!” Draco’s voice was warm, soft, and openly relieved. It took Harry a moment to realize that he was talking to the two kneazles currently in residence in his arms.
Harry walked to his desk, which was just as he had left it the day before, covered in parchment, quills, and empty tea cups.
“Kreacher, are you telling me this is a… a cat?” Harry asked. “ Because, er, I have noticed that it doesn’t have any fur.” Harry remembered Crookshanks leaving great piles of it all over his robes- Hermione had known clever spells to get it off before classes, but every once in a while he’d forgotten to check, and gone running about with great orange strands of hair clinging to him with intensity.
“But hey, if you want to back out of the gala, just send an owl. Say you don’t want to go. But if you do still want to go, well,” Ron paused, and appeared to consider how best to say something. “There are worse people to spend time with than someone who sees you for you. Just make sure that there aren’t, ah, other underlying issues that you don’t want to deal with.”
“Malfoy… he did the same thing, too. He just used my image, and he didn’t ask. But then he knew I would hate it, and I do hate it, a little, even if I’m not really made. I hated it, and he knew that, and he apologized, and tried to make it up to me. Granted, he was very rude, and I don’t really care about the kneazles, and he still used my face like everyone else, but… he knew I’d hate it. And I just felt… seen.”
Reaching for his wand, Harry prepared to blast the intruder out of his home, and was trying to decide how much trouble he’d be in with the aurors if he used one of the spells specifically for apprehending criminals, when he saw what it was that he had touched, and stopped. His mouth fell open, and his eyes grew huge as he stared.
“I wanted a really unusual pattern, something that would stand out, and be quite unique, and perhaps become my signature, so I thought of my time in Minnesota, and how much I loved raccoons, and I set out to recreate their masks, because they are adorable and I thought it would be very daring and dashing, to be known for selling kittens that look like Zorro.”
Malfoy fussed with the tea things for more time than Harry thought strictly necessary. He arranged the tea cups, measured the sugar incredibly carefully into his own cup, and then took a long time arranging the tea service to be juuust so on the low table in front of the two armchairs.
“Potter!” barked Robards. “Good! Just the man I wanted to see. We’ve got another inspection coming up, and I’m putting you on it. Have it completed by the end of my day, and for the love of Merlin, please make sure you ACTUALLY file the report on time. For once. Am I understood?”
Harry’s alarm went off, as it always did, at six thirty am, before the sun was even thinking of peeking over the horizon. As he always did, he shut his eyes tight, and gave himself 2 more minutes of ignoring the harsh, beeping sound of his alarm. After the two minutes were up, his alarm clock began to emit a high pitched screaming noise, as it always did, and he had no choice but to get up and turn it off.
Her voice may have been stern, but Harry caught another glimpse of her expression through her long, dark braids as she leaned down to examine the sleeping kitten more closely. He thought she looked fairly charmed by the kitten, despite her initial protestations to the contrary.
Harry sighed. Some things had not changed, even with the improvement of his relationship with Kreacher.
The room was large, with a flagstone floor and stone walls. The walls were covered with rich tapestries in jewel tones, and there were many wooden doors with elaborate brass handles, all polished to the point of gleaming.
Harry took it, and noticed with interest that it was indeed glowing slightly, and that the parchment it was on felt thick and luxurious. He flipped it over to look at the information and almost dropped the card in his shock. In swirling, silvery ink, the business card read:
“Anyway, along with my apologies, I would like to extend an invitation to the Annual Kneazle Fancier’s Show and Gala. After all, it is quite literally due to you and your face that I am even invited, and I am permitted a guest, and it would be my very great honor if you would attend with me, to show you my sincerity in my apologies, and also to give you an introduction to the very great world of kneazle breeding.” Malfoy almost managed to get through his speech without incident, but he couldn’t seem to stop the scowl that crossed his face as he forced himself to actually invite Harry to his fancy kneazle party.
“It was after the toilet paper thing that I realized I was sitting on something that people might actually WANT. I sent out a few inquiries to Magical Menagerie, because I know she finds good homes for kneazles, and she said she would absolutely take some Harry Potter themed kittens. Well, they sold immediately, even with the screening that I required before my kittens go to a home, and people were clamoring for more. As I’m sure you know, kneazles cannot be bred too quickly, so I was prepared to let this opportunity pass me by, when I received a call from the original witch who’d gotten me into breeding in the first place. She was looking to retire, and wanted to rehome her breeding pairs, and she had a pair of pregnant kneazles who were ready for their Aesthetic Charms, and I figured- what the hell. Here was my chance to make a mark on kneazle breeding- I’d be a fool not to take it.
Harry sighed. He had flooed in somewhat of a panic, it was true. He was grateful to Hermione for coming over, but he did understand that she had a life outside of dealing with his issues. Sort of. That didn’t mean he had to be happy about it all the time.
Huge, live trees grew from the carpet, arching up to meet the ceiling. Where the branches touched the ceiling, they fused with the plaster to form intricate pathways upon which cats could run, with occasional cat beds sticking out for a nice spot for a nap, or dangly toys where a cat could bat at something shiny. Giant, rope covered towers soared into the air, with dangly bridges and clever wicker cubbies interspersed. Soft, plush looking beds and blankets lay draped about on every surface, and Harry could see on many of them the same self-heating charms that he’d glimpsed in the Magical Menagerie. A glittering pond full of magical koi gleamed in the center of the room, and hundreds of colorful, squeaking toys jittered underfoot. Enchanted butterflies flitted about, dancing and dangling just out of reach.
That thought struck him as so pathetic that he looked down at the parchment in his hand just for a distraction. He winced. It had not escaped the sloshing tea either, and a very visible brown stain covered the bottom left corner.
At first, Harry was too awed by his surroundings to even see any cats (kneazles, he corrected himself. Malfoy would certainly not tolerate his kneazles being called “cats”). But as he adjusted to the room, he began to see them. They draped themselves on blankets, chased tiny objects around the floor, and generally looked like the spoiled, pampered pets that they almost certainly were. He recognized, now that he was seeing so many of them, that their larger size and tufted tails DID set them apart as kneazles rather than cats. He’d looked up the entry in Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them the night before, embarrassed by Hermione’s assertion that he should know that, and curious about his nighttime visitor. The sheen and luster on their coat was also somewhat magical- he was certain that cats did not have iridescent white fur that glinted in the light, nor did they come in magenta spots. He felt he could be forgiven for making a mistake with Chrysanthemum, who had once again curled up on his shoulder to sleep. She was a kitten, she was small, and she didn’t have ANY fur, let alone the characteristic tuft.
Hello everyone! Sorry I took such a long hiatus- I assure you, it was not planned. I returned to work, wrote a capstone, did nanowrimo, and fostered an actual litter of stray kittens since I last updated- it's been a whirlwind! Anyway, things are calmer now, and I plan to update more frequently. I hope you enjoy Chapter 12 :)
“Yes, of course, I’ll just, er, go now, then,” said Harry. “Bye, Chrysanthemum, it was nice to meet you.”
With that final pronouncement, Hermione stood up, gave one last stroke and fond look to the sleeping kitten beside her, kissed Harry on the cheek, and stepped into the fireplace in an elegant swirl of grey robes and green flame.
Hermioned laughed at his expression, and shook her head at Harry. Her expression was fond, and her whole body seemed relaxed. Harry loved seeing her like this- after the war, they’d all been so tired, so withdrawn, and it had been hard to be around each other, even as it was hard to stay apart. Hermione in particular had been drawn and gray- her hair had gone wilder than ever, and her skin had been flat and unhealthy. To see her like this, several years and who knew how many therapy sessions later, with her dark brown skin glowing, her hair neatly done up with one of the million braiding spells she’d learned after Hogwarts, was like a balm to Harry- even if she was being somewhat unhelpful with regards to his kitten.
“Anyway, my three weeks in Minnesota came to an end, I portkeyed back to London, and then I sat alone in my house for about a year, being very very bored, doing nothing to change that and wasting my youth and my good looks- don’t laugh, Potter, this is my story, until my mother announced that there was no living with me anymore, and she was moving to Greece.
Hey everyone! Chapters are probably going to be a bit shorter from here on out, because I need to spend my writing time working on my thesis, and not on writing about wizarding catteries. That being said, I plan to still update frequently- just with slightly shorter chapters so that I can make sure I get my masters degree on time! Wheeee hope you enjoy!
Malfoy frowned, but accepted this. With another enviable swirl of robes that had Harry wondering if dungeon living somehow taught Slytherins things about robe twirling, he stalked off towards one of the shiny wooden doors, and strode through purposefully. Harry, kitten still on his shoulder and purring madly, followed him.
Harry snorted. Ron’s unwavering support in the face of his (numerous, potentially ongoing) sexuality crisis had been the best shock of his life.
Hermione must have seen something of that in his expression, because she took pity on him and offered up a flurry of suggestions as she ,
Harry stared at his hands. Ron had grown up secure in the knowledge that his family loved him, even if he felt a bit overshadowed, and it showed. He’d never really gotten Harry’s rabid, anxious desire to belong, and to have someone care about him. However, a bizarre little voice in Harry’s head that sounded like Ron himself, told Harry that Ron never WOULD understand if Harry didn’t make the attempt and use his words to tell him. He could at least try. Ron would like that.
Harry had assumed that there would be as many kneazles as there were pictures of cats in the foyer, but as he scanned the room, he was surprised to see that there were only about half a dozen cats, not including Chrysanthemum. He recognized the fat gray kneazle from yesterday sleeping in a basket with a velvet pillow, and then there was the pink spotted one (hard to miss) stalking some butterflies, the iridescent one sharpening its claws on a rope tower shaped like a mushroom, a long haired calico that seemed to shift the location of her orange, black, and white portions of fur, and then two identical looking black cats that were closely curled together, sleeping, in an orb of wool that was hanging from nothing in the middle of the floor.
“I suppose you have questions. Well, let’s do this properly. I’ll get us a cup of tea, and you can ask all the questions on your form, and I will tell you about the, er, Potteazles.” He turned away, snapping his fingers, causing a tea tray and various tea making supplies to fly out of a cupboard and towards a pair of overstuffed armchairs in front of a large fireplace that was nestled into a nook in thecorner.
As he stepped out of the floo in Grimmauld Place, ready to commence his previously planned evening of lying around doing nothing, he realized that those words, rather than being a comforting, were actually just really fucking depressing. Pushing those thoughts away, he toed off his shoes, and collapsed onto the couch. He needed to get some serious relaxation in if he was going to be ready to face work again the next day.
Harry walked into Grimmauld Place, shaking the rain from his hair and shrugging off his outer robe. It fell to the floor and lay limp and accusing on the dull hardwood floor. Harry stared at it. He knew he should pick it up, put it away, and ensure that it was ready to go again in the morning, but the thought of even that level of effort left him feeling bleak. He trudged into the house, dripping on the floor, ignoring the vague voice in his head that kept softly saying that being an auror was not supposed to feel like this. He shoved it down, and went to sit on the couch. He could smell something savory wafting from the kitchen- it seemed that Kreacher was making a French Onion soup.
Swallowing a groan, Harry follows Remus out of the room and into the kitchen. The sky is already light outside the windows, even though the sun has yet to climb over the horizon.
Clearly swept up in the hilarity of the situation and aiming to get Daphne to laugh loud enough to snort like a pig (one of the girl’s favourite passtimes, Harry has learned as he’s begun to spend more time with the girls), Pansy shakes her head and chokes out, ”Not really… because… well… it sounds like…
”Listen, I’ve been meaning to talk to you… I feel really bad about not tipping you off about that egg, you know after you told me about the dragons…”
”I’ve been asleep this whole time, it’s only been about twenty minutes, maybe half an hour, since Moody woke me up”, he says.
. He gives a wry smile. Trust Professor Snape to set a homework assignment the last week of the school year and to be marking them all when everyone else is making their way to the Feast.
They sit in silence, watching the sun set and then they make their way back to the castle for the feast, which is even more magnificent than any Hogwarts feast Harry has ever sat through before, but he barely eats anything anyway. As the sky begins to darken outside the windows and in the enchanted ceiling, and the task draws closer, Harry’s nerves begin to set in for real.
Harry thinks, just as he hears Fleur’s unimpressed voice drift over from a few seats away, claiming that the Palace of Beauxbatons is more impressive and magnificent in every way, her date nodding his agreement with a snooty look at the ceiling. Harry snorts softly to himself and looks away.
”The heir of Slytherin left another message”, she replies curtly, but her face is whiter than Harry has ever seen it and her lips are trembling slightly. ”Right underneath the first one.”
Heart hammering excitedly in his chest, Harry starts digging through the mess in his desk drawers until he finds a blank piece of parchment and then fumbles with a quill, eager to start his reply so that he can tell the blonde that he loves him too… but as soon as he puts the quill to the paper, he suddenly doesn’t know what to write…
He hadn’t realised he was worried about his dads reaction to him being a Parselmouth until Sirius made a joke about it, but now he feels completely fine about the whole thing. If Sirius isn’t worried, then there’s definitely no need for Harry to be.
The next time he wakes up, the dorm is flooded with a soft green light which tells him it’s morning already. Draco is still curled up next to him, but he can tell by the boy’s breathing that he’s awake. He turns his head and brushes his lips over the blonde hair and inhales happily… they’re safe…
”Let me see that, dear” the wispy voice Trewlawny interrupts them suddenly and she grabs the cup out of Theodore’s hand and peers into it with narrowed eyes while turning it around slowly. ”Ah, the falcon… My dear, you have a deadly enemy…”
”That sounds fine”, Granger says, inclining her head and still ignoring Pansy. ”I’ll bring the book I told you about.”
Harry corrects himself, watching his boyfriend put flat side over a bean and then his whole weight on top of it, crushing it.
”Well, I would be, yes”, Draco says bracingly. ”But she’s been living in our world for five years now and she’s a bloody information sponge, so she should
On friday afternoon, he’s making his way down from his last Transfiguration lesson of the term when he suddenly hears Filch’s outraged voice from the floor above. Curiosity piqued, Harry turns around and hurries up the stairs. He slows down close to the top and hangs back just out of sight and listens closely…
… what do you think she would do to the Head of House of the group of students that vandalised her office?”
”In fact, we’ve gone so far as to device an entirely separate curriculum for you for the better part of this and the next term, so you don’t need to work
Flint seems unusually chipper when they gather around him and Harry can only imagine how Ron’s first practise with the Gryffindor team had gone for their Captain to be in such a cheerful mood… but it can’t have been pretty, Harry thinks and he resolutely avoids looking at Draco for the duration of Flint’s pep talk, because he doesn’t want to see the blonde come to the same conclusion, and react to it.
After much struggle, Harry manages to descend the stairs and the floor is once again flat under his feet, even if it is undulating. He tries to get his bearings, but before he can he’s being hauled across the floor and before he knows it, the hands have pushed him away and he’s falling… Gasping in horror, Harry starts to flail in panic, but he’s already landed softly on his back and only ends up squirming in place.
Draco blinks and hands him the letter without a word. Blaise, Pansy and Seamus all scramble up from their seats and lean towards him, crowding around him excitedly to read the message and Harry huffs, elbowing Seamus in the chest when he gets so close to Harry’s face he can smell the cinnamon on his breath.
”Where are we going?” he asks in trepidation as the blonde continues to pull on his arm in determination.
Professor Snape swoops round the desk in a flurry of billowing robes, then slowly sinks into the seat opposite Harry and pins him with his dark eyes, and Harry suspects he’s remembering the last time Harry was here, too… he barely resists the temptation to hang his head and resolutely maintains eye contact with his Head of House, whose sharp glare never wavers.
So for the next few days, this becomes Harry’s new routine. He retires early in the evening and spends most of the night tossing and turning in bed, dreaming of being chased by images of himself and startling awake every so often with a gradually growing sense of dread in the pit of his stomach. There’s also a niggling thought that lingers at the back of his mind, but he stubbornly waves it away every time and goes back to sleep.
”How was it?” Draco asks, tearing his attention away from his books when Harry sinks down on the sofa next to him. ”Harry? Are you okay?”
”When your dad and I were sixteen, he decided to tell his mother about us… At first, I think she was actually relieved to hear that he hadn’t been consorting with muggle women despite the pictures he insisted on sticking to the walls of his room…”
Draco takes his sweet time deciding his flavours, but finally orders a cherry sauce dripping four-scoop ice cream tower, swaying precariously in a waffle cone, and then proceeds to lick sticky, multi-coloured drops from the back of his hand until Harry has got his own cone, then insists on paying for them both.
Harry is on all fours on the floor and his scar is prickling with pain, but it’s a sense of pure triumph that wells up inside of him, because finally —
Harry swallows down a persistent lump in his throat. Even though Draco is safe, here with him… his chest feels tight thinking how close he’s been to losing him forever. The thought of the blonde being anywhere near Voldemort and his Death Eaters, the thought of his delicate wrist gripped by those skeletal fingers and branded with his mark… Harry shivers, and snuggles a little closer to the other boy under the duvet, just to reassure himself that he’s here.
which he’s never even heard of, and what’s even weirder is that it’s got the exact same layout and typeface as
”Hey, anyone else curious about where she’s getting her information?” Blaise says. ”Dumbledore banned her from Hogwarts ages ago and yet she keeps printing stories. I mean, it’s all pretty much the same but it’s always sprinkled with new details… where is she getting those from, if she can’t come onto the grounds anymore?”
”Come on now, round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies…” Lockhart yells tauntingly, and then with a patronising grin he rolls up his sleeves and brandishes his wand. ”
”Oh, I’ll take them through the creatures that would most likely show up in their OWLs — not much left to do actually, since they’ve already studied unicorns and nifflers — I thought we’d cover porlocks and kneazles, make sure they can recognise crups and knarls, you know…”
He knows Professor Snape has very limited patience for when students are incompetent or slow to pick up on what he’s teaching them, remembering how Potions used to be before he got the hang of it and he really don’t wish to go back to that. Most of all, he doesn’t want Professor Snape to be disappointed with him. Not after everything he’s put the man through…
”What — what are you —?” Harry gasps, scrambling up to sitting and reaching for his glasses. ”What are you doing?”
”Settle down…” he says silkily, even though they all are as settled as can be already. ”Before we begin today’s lesson, I think it’s appropriate to remind you all that next June you will be sitting an important examination, during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions. Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are, I expect
and the day’s batch of hate letters, and he scrambles to his feet in a hurry to open the window and let the birds inside.
Suddenly they hear a soft creaking and look up at each other in horror.  The unmistakable sound of footsteps can be heard getting nearer and nearer, but it’s not the uneven hobbling of Filch, rather the swift footfalls of —
”No?” Sirius says with a teasing grin as he brings his coffee cup over to the table and plops down in the seat opposite Harry. ”When did that happen, then?”
As they trudge up the winding stairs to the North Tower for Divination class, they pass the portrait of Sir Cadogan and his chubby pony and the short, squat knight immediately lets out a battle cry and leaves his pony to continue munching listlessly on the grass in the painting, in order to pursue the group of Slytherins through the neighbouring picture frames, his panting breath barely audible over the clanking of his armour.
the shriek stops with a rasping gurgle and the banshee clutches her throat indignantly. A few people laugh nervously. The banshee looks around in confusion…
Harry startles and looks around. Two Dumbledores are now next to him, one watching Barty Crouch Junior getting dragged out of the courtroom with sad eyes and the other watching him. Harry nods hurriedly. The Dumbledore of the now gives him a small, sad smile and then cups his elbow and pulls gently on it.
A few nervous chuckles can be heard from the other Death Eaters. But Lucius keeps his eyes firmly fixed on Voldemort’s chest.
Of course, by the time the team has changed into their quidditch uniforms, the Gryffindor team has shown up and most of their allotted practise is spent watching Flint and Wood flex their muscles and scream in each other’s faces.
The door to the staff room bangs open suddenly and several people jump, including Harry and Draco. For a second, Harry almost expected to see Dumbledore waltzing in, but it’s not Dumbledore… It’s Lockart, and he’s beaming.
Harry pulls a jumper and a pair of clean pyjama bottoms on and pads out of the bedroom. As soon as he enters the hallway, he can smell coffee and freshly baked bread coming from the kitchen and feels a warm tingle in his belly.
He feels Draco’s hand rub across his shoulders and shoots him a half-hearted glare. The blonde gives him a look of compassion, but still chuckles helplessly.
Despite everything, Harry can’t help but to smile. Sirius gives him a sheepish look, then fidgets a little awkwardly as if the embarassment from talking about sex is finally kicking in. Harry walks over and takes the seat next to him on the sofa.
And he’ll get to meet lots of other wizards and witches, and hopefully make lots of friends… He tries not to think about the blonde boy, when this thought pops into his head, but since the blonde —
”At Hogwarts, when daddy was — erm — talking to Dumbledore and Mr Crouch from the Ministry, Mr Crouch kept calling him Mr Black, like he thought he was you.”
”Don’t be sorry”, Remus chides gently. ”Come on… Let’s go get some lunch, and maybe an ice-cream for afters, what do you say?”
Having been reassured that Harry won’t make a habit of diving head-first into the challenges, Remus relaxes a little more and the smile on his face softens.
”I offered to help”, Seamus shoots back with a teasing grin. ”You said you wanted to figure it out yourse—”
He startles awake and sits up in his sweat-damp bed. For a moment he imagines he can still smell and taste blood, but gradually the scent of coconut overpowers the coppery tang.
”Oh come off it”, the other Gryffindor says. ”There’s nothing wrong with Malfoy’s arm! Right, Harry?”
He nibbles his lip anxiously, forcing himself to maintain eye contact with Remus now even though he feels mortified talking to him about his sex life, because he needs to see if there’s recognition or not in his eyes. But Remus face gives nothing away, nothing but reassurance and patience.
Towards the end of breakast, Hedwig brings him a sugar quill and a note from Sirius that simply says,
”Well, o’course he was interested in ’im! How often d’yeh come across a three-headed dog, even if yer in the trade? But I told ’im, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake as long as yeh know ’ow to calm ’im down — jus’ play ’im a bit o’ music an’ he’ll fall righta sleep!”
I don’t know! I don’t know what happened, I just woke up here and everything is different — you guys are different! I’m sorted into Slytherin! All my friends are different! I DON’T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING!”
Blinking his eyes open, Harry squints up at Remus and catches the look of relief that flickers into the man’s face, before he gives Harry one of his warmest smiles. He then begins to sit back and Harry barely resists the temptation to reach out and hold onto him, scared of being left alone suddenly… but Remus doesn’t leave him, he just leans back and reaches for something behind him — a slab of chocolate, as it turns out — and he breaks off a large piece of it that he holds out to Harry.
”Weird”, Pansy comments, frowning at the roll of parchment as Harry taps it with his wand and unrolls it. ”Who’s it from?”
As they tumble through the doors, they find themselves unexpectedly face to face with Draco and Pansy, and Harry startles as he accidentally locks eyes with the blonde boy, quickly dropping Ron’s hand again. The other Slytherins’ eyes narrow as they glare between the two of them and knowing what it must look like, Harry feels his face heat up and silently curses himself.
Adrian slams his coffee cup down on the table and gets to his feet as well, storming out of the Great Hall in Flint’s wake. Harry looks at the rest of the team. They all give him smirks and head shakes, before finishing their breakfasts quickly and getting to their feet as well.
” Remus repeats incredulously and is halfway out of his seat, when Dumbledore stops him with a gentle touch on his arm.
Harry is inclined to agree. Even if it’s only the second day and the stress of being in their OWL year really hasn’t grabbed them yet, Harry still could have used an hour and a half to just
Draco frowns when Harry hesitates to answer and places a hand lightly on top of his arm. Harry just shakes his head.
He climbs off the bench and holds out his arm for Hedwig. She immediately flaps her wings and flies over to him, landing gracefully on top of his arm, then digging her talons into his school robes and climbing to the top of his shoulder. He gives her a tired smile as she nips affectionately at his ear.
The circular rooms with all the doors are suddenly engulfed in darkness. Harry opens his eyes. The stone ceiling of Professor Snape’s office comes into view and he realises he’s lying flat on his back on the floor, panting as if he’s really been running through a corridor…
”It’s not like that, I promise!” Ginny says in exasperation. ”You guys have a date, I’m assuming? Well, go on your date, and then meet up with Hermione after? Malfoy, you can tag along, I’m sure Hermione won’t mind, and that way you’ll know it’s nothing like that, it’s…
Lupin nods sadly in understanding. He reaches out and covers Draco’s hand with his own and gives it a gentle squeeze, but doesn’t say anything else. Sirius looks from their interlocked hands to Draco’s face and ducks his head a little, scooping the blonde’s tear-filled gaze up with his own.
They melt together and make out for what feels like hours, yet no time at all at the same time and Harry could easily stay in the embrace indefinitely, if it wasn’t for the cool breeze from the slightly uneven window panes and the goosebumps on every patch of his skin that doesn’t touch Draco’s. The other boy must have felt him shiver, because his caresses turn from slow and sensual to more of a brisk rubbing and then he breaks the kiss again and steps away. Harry shivers in earnest then.
Draco just shakes his head, but his breathing is getting under control again and at the mention of Harry flying, the panic disappears from his eyes again as well.
The worst part isn’t the exhaustion though, it’s the hallucinations… and Harry knows they’re just figments of his sleep-deprivation, but that doesn’t make them any less scary when they happen.
”I can save her”, Harry says stubbornly. ”I know where the entrance to the Chamber is and I think I know how to open it. If I’m right, not even Dumbledore will be able to open it. It has to be me. So I have to at least try and save her.”
”No, she can’t”, Snape agrees. ”At least not at the time being. Let’s make sure it stays that way… all right?”
”I’m not hungry”, Draco says dismissively around the piece of chewing gum and then starts blowing a large, pink bubble that steadily shifts colours the larger it gets.
”Of course we don’t”, Blaise says. ”Don’t be so dramatic. Seamus is right (must be a blue moon), no seriously, even if we
He suddenly becomes aware of Snape’s eyes on him again and quickly tries to smooth his face out into a neutral mask, but it’s too late. Snape is already studying him with narrowed eyes flashing with suspicion and Harry swallows thickly.
”Get up, Avery”, Voldemort hisses. ”Stand up. You ask for forgiveness? I do not forgive. I do not forget. Thirteen long years… I want thirteen years’ repayment before I forgive you! Wormtail here has paid some of his debt already, haven’t you, Wormtail?”
”The new password is Parsletongue”, Cowley says in a loud and clear voice, with a sideways glance at Harry.
In the remaining two days leading up to the First Task, the anti-Harry campaign seems to double its effort and even though Diggory and his closest friends in Hufflepuff (who were the ones who used to quote the
Sirius continues to argue with the Minister, and Harry can hear Dumbledore’s voice join in through the hysterical screams and worried voices of the crowd. But it all blends together as Remus carries him further and further away from the commotion. He is aware of someone else walking alongside them, but doesn’t lift his head from Remus’ shoulder or open his eyes to see who it is. He’s still fighting nausea and adrenaline is pumping through his body, making him tremble violently. Remus’ heartbeat is a soothing distraction, but not nearly enough.
”That’s… none of your concern”, Snape mutters with a forced calm, negated sligthly by the agitated look in his eyes.
Draco rolls his eyes at him, but they glint with a warm kind if happiness and his lips twitch. But then the blonde glances into a nearby mirror discreetly and Harry spots a small but unmistakable doubt flare up and push the happy away.
Madam Pomfrey comes bustling out of her office with a breakfast tray and Harry awkwardly starts in on the scrambled eggs with his left hand, while she examines his right.
A small smile flickers onto the blonde’s face and he leans down to capture Harry’s lips with his own in a sweet, shallow kiss.
In the end, he ends up ticking all the same subjects as Draco, figuring if he doesn’t care about the subjects anyway, he might as well pick ones in which he knows he’ll have the blonde for company.
Umbridge approaches Pansy and asks her in a loud, carrying voice if she can understand Hagrid when he talks.
Harry’s invigorated spirits carry him through several hours of celebrations in the Common Room despite a building headache and he decides that, instead of giving in to it and going to bed like he would normally do, he is going to take Seamus’s advice for once and simply
Suddenly there’s a minor explosion on the other side of Harry, who whips his head around just in time to see Seamus’s feather burst into flames and Harry quickly smothers it with his own hat.
”Wait, stop”, Professor Snape says, waving a hand to emphasize. ”What are you talking about now? What interview?”
”That is a very good question, Potter”, Snape says and then remains silent until they reach the secret doorway to the Slytherin Common Room. ”The others are surely waiting for you to tell them all about what happened tonight. I will return in exactly ten minutes to make sure everyone is in their dormitories, and anyone who
”Detention, Mr Potter!” Umbridge cries and he catches an almost triumphant light flare up in her eyes, just before she turns her back to him. ”Tomorrow evening. Five o’clock. My office… I repeat, it is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizards. But if you are still worried, by all means, come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. You see, I am here to help. I am your friend—”
”Okay”, Granger says decisively and sits up a little straighter again, pulling the notes closer and grabbing her quill. ”Then let’s get you home… Now, you said you were in the Department of Mysteries before the change happened —”
Moving slowly along the inner edge of the circle, Voldemort throws his head back and inhales deeply through the slits where his nose should be.
”Sure”, his voice slithers out of him like it’s the easiest thing in the world, like everything really
He’s always thought of Draco as being his best friend. But that’s not been true for quite some time either. Their friendship, which was never
”—because I don’t know”, the portrait finishes snidely. ”Unless it’s official Hogwarts business, the Headmaster doesn’t see fit to inform us of his goings-on…”
But Harry can’t wait. He needs to speak to Hagrid right now, before it’s too late. He can hear Draco running after him, but he doesn’t slow down to let him catch up. He can see Hagrid across the lawn, almost at his hut already and he runs faster.
Harry frowns and looks over at the Gryffindors. He doesn’t think the girl is that unattractive. Granted, her front teeth are on the larger side and that hair… But he wouldn’t go as far as calling her
”It’s too dark, right? Makes me look too pale? Remus, you agree?” the blonde continues, turning to Remus with a miserable look.
”No…”, Harry says. ”It was now, I’m sure of it, and Voldemort — Voldemort was alive, but I couldn’t see him — there were two men taking care of him, one I didn’t recognise, the other —”
He’s aware of Voldemort moving closer and closer, his soft voice slithering around Harry’s pounding head like an insistent fly, as he tells his Death Eaters the story of what really happened that Hallowe’en night almost fourteen years ago. He casually mentions Lily’s
Before Remus can question Harry further, Snape straightens up importantly in his seat and shakes the hair out of his face.
He turns his pale blue eyes onto Harry again and twinkles at him over the rim of his half-moon glasses.
Finally, the old wizard let go of him and returns to the Great Hall. The second he is out of sight, Harry bolts… He skids across the floor towards the spiral staircase to the dungeons and takes the stairs two at a time, then jumps off and hits the dungeon floor running.
, and still he feels like he’s floated away from his own body, away from the chair and the classroom…
When they return to the castle at the end of the lesson, a rather large crowd of students are gathered in the Entrance Hall and blocking the way to the dungeons.
He keeps glancing over at the blonde next to him and every time they accidentally lock eyes, they both blush and smile secretively at each other — until finally Blaise tells them in a carryingly loud and clear voice to knock it out before he chucks up his christmas pudding…
”I will probably be out of your hair…” Harry says, giving an almost imperceptible pause as he glances at the man’s receding hairline with a smirk. ”…in the morning and that will be the end of it. Now, please go back to bed.”
”Oh, no, you didn’t do anything”, Draco says sarcastically. ”Apart from landing yourself in detention
For the next few days, the group devices several plans for how to keep Draco safe as well as how to get rid of Crabbe and Goyle without resorting to Unforgivables and Draco is on board with all of it. But by the end of the week you would have thought the attack never happened judging by how dismissive he is about any potential danger that he’s in.
The blonde ignores him and keeps staring at Umbridge, his eyes glinting with some barely repressed emotion and chest heaving with quick, shallow breaths.
Barty Crouch Senior had managed to escape the house — that was Wormtail’s big blunder, that almost got him fed to the snake Nagini — and he’d come to Hogwarts to warn Dumbledore and come clean about everything. That night when Harry found him. He feels sick thinking about it now. The insane ramblings, they all made sense now. And the feet sticking out from behind the tree. Dead. Killed.
”Potter, I know what I’m talking about!” she says shortly and waves her wand at the books and makes them pile up in her arms again. ”I suggest you two go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.”
”, Remus says loudly, as Harry and Draco both open their mouths to protest once more. ”Harry, we can’t risk inviting Theodore when we know his father is a Death Eater, but how about you invite Blaise and Seamus? — Sirius, I think that’s a good compromise. Neither Cara Zabini or Fiadh Finnegan are affiliated with the Death Eaters—”
Harry does manage to finish his chart — although with two Neptunes on it — but Trelawny still sets the whole class a rather massive homework assignment.
Despite the spring sun shining down on the castle, the fire is as ever lit in Divination classroom, turning the cramped room into a oven. Within minutes, Harry is boiling under his robes… but despite this, the lack of sleep the night before starts to catch up to him in the dim light, especially when Professor Trelawny dims it even further by extinguishing all the lamps, so that they can all study a miniature of Mars inside a glass dome that she places in the middle of the classroom.
But it appears Pansy had been telling the truth. The Gryffindor is clearly tipsy, her body language a lot looser than normal and her face open and happy, with unexpected ripples of giggles bursting out of her every so often. But other than that, she seems fine. Harry still sticks to her side, though.
”Oh, um, I’m not sure… I mean, I must have had it when we left the Manor, but I never used it at the World Cup so I could have lost it at any time, I suppose…”
Harry looks up in surprise. Remus is frowning at his husband, but Sirius seems to be ignoring him and keeps his eyes trained on Harry instead.
”He’s incredibly talented…” Remus murmurs. ”Take a look at this, Pads. Draco made Harry another drawing. This one is unbelievable!”
”I don’t want to anymore”, Harry insists, but judging by the other men’s chuckles he figures he’s not very convincing.
He frowns in confusion when Remus gives him a sidelong look, before walking over to gently rub Draco’s shoulder.
”I eh… Wouldn’t know”, Harry says shrewdly. ”I don’t really hang out with the team all that much anymore, I guess I miss flying more than anything… It always used to help clear my head, you know?”
More snickers and chortles from the Death Eaters. Gritting his teeth against the pain, Harry pushes himself to his feet and squares his shoulders.
Defence Against the Dark Arts… It turns out that Lockhart ran away the night Ginny Weasley was taken into the Chamber of Secrets, so the morning after when Dumbledore called Remus to his office for a meeting, he’d wanted to ask him to fill in as DADA professor for the last few weeks of the school year. Remus had accepted, as long as Harry would be okay with it, and of course he was!
Harry had said of course, but now that he thinks about it, really thinks about it, he’s not so sure he would be able to deny it. And it’s not for the reason Granger had insinuated, waggling her eyebrows like a lunatic, he thinks.
The Dumbledore in the memory has got an equally long hair and beard, but rather than being snowy white they are both auburn so Harry guesses he must be decades younger than now. Although it’s hard to judge the old man’s physique through the style of robes he always wears, Harry thinks this younger version is also slimmer and he does walk with a younger man’s energy. He’s wearing a purple suit that is cut closely to his body and made of velvet that shines in the sunlight. Harry isn’t surprised to see several people stop and stare at him.
. He scowls at her, but she simply sits back still smirking calmly, looking very much like a cat that’s just stuffed itself on cream that wasn’t meant for it.
The ceiling is soo high Harry can barely make it out, and a large staircase of gleaming marble rises from the flagged stone floor and disappears into the depth of the upper levels of the castle.
— we should be doing everything we can to help make that happen, but what do we do? One of us is off
It’s very obvious who is on her list of suspects for the prank, he thinks. Because he never catches her narrow her eyes suspiciously at Draco or Blaise, nor Pansy and Daphne, as she does at him. He does catch her do that to Seamus, though. And the Weasley twins and their friend, the Quidditch commentator, Lee Jordan.
It’s with trepidation that the Slytherins make their way down the frosty slope towards Hagrid’s hut for Care of Magical Creatures with the Gryffindors later that afternoon and when they catch up to the lions, it immediately becomes clear that the Slytherins aren’t the only ones feeling apprehensive. Even Granger looks wary and she’d been happy to see Hagrid in the Great Hall earlier, Harry remembers. Ron had looked happy too, and Fred and George had gone so far as to run up to him and shake his hand. Harry shakes his head. He doesn’t get how anyone could be happy to have the half-giant back as a teacher.
Ron spins him round and round on the dance floor at the Yule Ball and when he stops, Harry crashes into his chest with a laugh…
”Mighta come up…” Hagrid says, frowning as he tries to remember. ”Yeah, he asked me what I did, an’ I told ’im I was gamekeeper here… he asked me wha’ sorta creatures I look after, so I told ’im… an’ I said wha’ I always really wanted was a dragon…” Hagrid heaves a sad sigh. ”Tha’s when he said he had the egg, said ’e could play me for it… but… let’s see… can’ remember too too well, he kept buyin’ me drinks, yeh see… no, yes, he said he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old home o’ course…”
Harry stares at Fawkes, so he doesn’t have to look at anyone else’s face, but something about the bird’s sad eye reminds him of Dumbledore so he looks towards the window behind the Headmaster’s desk instead. An acid green beetle is scurrying back and forth on the window sill.
Harry is still moping about it the next morning, and not even Selina’s playful mood is enough to shake him out of his thoughts. Finally, at lunch, Remus offers to contact the Malfoys to see if they can arrange for Harry and Draco to get together one day before Harry has to go back to Hogwarts and Harry looks up excitedly then, his half-eaten lunch forgotten.
Harry sighs, then begins talking. He knows there’s no point in sugar-coating anything, so he simply ploughs through everything that he remembers Dumbledore telling him, more or less verbatim. Then finishes by reciting the prophecy about himself and Voldemort.
Lupin is standing at the stove, waving his wand over the various breakfast foods cooking in the pots and pans
”You too”, Remus smiles thinly, gaze darting away briefly to scan the gathering crowd in front of the till.
He points a gnarly finger at the door of the classroom. The girl’s face flushes a bright pink and she stammers something about not meaning she wanted to leave, then falls silent.
”Not all of it, but enough. I know what happened — To James and Lily — I know Pettigrew betrayed them, but —”
This up-close, he can make out Draco’s features despite not wearing his glasses, even if they’re slightly blurred, and he can tell when the blonde’s smirk widens into an actual smile. That’s the only warning Harry gets before the other boy kills the distance between them and gently rocks their hips together, allowing Harry to feel just how hot he himself also is.
Harry glances at Pansy, then thrusts his head to the side to indicate another door on the left-hand side of the ante chamber. They walk inside and Harry makes a beeline for his animagi potion, brewing in a small cauldron in the corner, whilst Pansy has an idle nosey about.
”What’s that?” Draco asks, looping his arm around Harry’s shoulders and pulling him even closer to his side.
he’d asked, since he never even noticed the shift when he’d spoken it in Duelling Club… And the blonde had nodded excitedly and… and then he’d made a
Harry is so excited he can barely sleep a wink all night and asks whether he can have coffee instead of chocolate at breakfast, but Sirius lets him try a sip from his cup and Harry immediately pulls a face at the bitter taste and opts for chocolate in the end after all.
”When I was your age, I used to tell your dad the same thing and he always shook his head at me as well… he was rebelling against his parents”, Remus says. ”Is that what you’re doing, Harry?”
Remus guides him over to the bed and they curl up together against the headboard, Harry leaning his head back against his daddy’s chest. Remus gently combs his fingers through his hair and brushes his thumb over the lightening bolt scar on his forehead.
Suddenly, the dream he’d been having of chasing a Snitch through the library, unable to get his broom off the ground, evaporates and he begins to become aware of being in his bed and feeling
As soon as Sirius is out of sight again, Harry releases the breath he’d tried not to hold in and his entire body sags.
”Better, thanks… I’m ready to tell you what happened in the graveyard”, Harry says firmly, anxious to get the whole thing over with.
”Dumbledore”, Fudge protests. ”I really have to get back to the Ministry, so if we could get this over with—?”
The crowd turns around and Harry and Draco move further into the hall and look up to see Professor Dumbledore standing on the first landing of the marble staircase. As some of the students move out of the way, Harry and Draco finally get a glimpse of the Weasley twins and Harry lets out an incredulous chuckle at the sight of them: both twins have magically sprouted long, white beards.
Harry can tell the man’s voice is heavy with meaning this time, even if he doesn’t know what the meaning is. Sirius obviously does, though. He finally stops glaring a hole in Harry’s skull and gets his wand out to levitate the trunk from the ground. He directs it through the doorway ahead of him and disappears inside, leaving Harry behind and assuming he’ll follow, which Harry does but at a safe distance.
Harry glances over at McGonagall again, wondering if she’s at all concerned about the results of her inspection. But Professor McGonagall couldn’t look less concerned if she tried and the sight of her stern face as she continues to explain the challenges of Vanishing a mammal compared to an invertebrate, as if everything was normal, makes Harry feel a fondness for her that he hasn’t felt since she stepped in and helped Draco when Moody the imposter had transfigured him into a ferret.
”Please, mister Potter”, Dumbledore says and Harry turns his head back to look at him again instead. ”Continue your story.”
Everyone looks towards a section of witches and wizards to the left and Harry looks over as well. Not a single hand is raised. Several people along the walls clap in appreciation.
the lingering sensations of the dream are still running up and down his arms and legs; he tries to pinpoint if it feels hot or cold or both, and if Lupin woke him up before he got the message,
”I vas vondering if you could maybe give me some ideas for vot I can do to get her to see how much I like her… ”
Harry has thought about writing him every day for a week, but something has held him back every time. He can’t quite put his finger on it, but he has a feeling that it would be a bad idea.
The door swings open and a very handsome boy of about sixteen years enter. Harry stares up at him, feeling oddly starstruck… The boy ignores him and walks right past him.
”Here you go, Sir…” the shop assistant twitters, placing a frilly pink and golden parcel on the counter. ”That will be ten Sickles and three Knuts, please…”
Harry gives him a scandalised look and Draco huffs, rolling his eyes again. Then looks around for the shop assistant instead. Harry shuffles over to stand at the blonde’s shoulder awkwardly while he and the chipper witch launch into a discussion that is way too passionate for Harry’s liking, considering it’s about women’s perfume…
Draco waits until everyone leaves the compartment, avoiding Harry’s gaze until they’re completely alone.
When he returns to the dorm, the others have all gone to bed and Harry feels torn between relief and disappointment as he looks at the drawn hangings around Draco’s four-poster.
”The point is”, Harry continues seriously. ”And I’m not asking to be friends with you or anything, I’m just trying to prove to you that, where I’m from we
But all things considered, Theodore had been right in thinking Divination is an easy O and with Potions and Transfiguration being as hard as they are, and History of Magic as dull… Harry figures he needs Divination and Care of Magical Creatures to balance things out. Although, ever since Draco’s injury, Care of Magical Creatures has gone from easy to dull as well, which kind of sucks but at least it’s another class in which he can be on auto-pilot now…
Harry suddenly feels his blood run cold as he turns to look at Hagrid as the half-giant gets up and starts walking out of the Great Hall.
Harry flashes back to his last dream about Voldemort, when he’d killed an old muggle man. That was in August. Harry stares at Dumbledore. He is dying to ask him about what he’d seen in the Pensieve, but at the same time, a part of him just wants to forget… Finally, he decides to leave it for another day and stands up.
have seen it… If I go to Snape and tell him, I’ll have to explain to him that not only did I not do my relaxation exercises before bed, I was also completely sloshed…”
Harry nods quickly, then watches the other boy leave the dorm again. A sinking sensation in his stomach tells him he’s somehow disappointed, but at least the ball of guilt has settled down a little.
Harry lets out a frustrated yell. Wormtail frowns at him and fumbles with one of the pockets in his cloak, pulling out a piece of black fabric that he shoves inside Harry’s mouth. Harry tries to push it out again with his tongue and immediately gags on the taste of it.
! In just a week it will be Christmas and he gets to leave all this chaos behind him and go home to his dads!
”Nothing”, Draco mutters and goes back to his essay. ”You know the exams are only ten weeks away, it wouldn’t hurt you to do a bit of revising…”
”Harry Potter… my name is John Dawlish”, the older of the two Aurors introduces himself. ”And this is my partner, Hubert Williamson.”
”N-Nevertheless”, Crouch insists firmly, although a light sheen of sweat has broken out over forehead.
”My cat has been Petrified!” the caretaker exclaims shrilly, jumping to his feet. ”I want to see some
The blonde turns his head to look at him over his should. His eyes look haunted and empty all at once, the shadows underneath them disturbingly dark in the gloom. Harry frowns.
The figure is only metres away from him now, towering over him and with another rattling breath, it seems to suck the very air out of Harry’s lungs and before he knows what’s happened, his knees have buckled under him and he’s crumpled on the ground, with his own breath caught in his chest… the cold has seeped into his bones now, into his very core… he’s drowning in it… gasping on lungfuls of stinging, ice cold air… it seems to be rushing in his ears as well, it’s all he can hear…
”Yeah, so? I didn’t really know anyone but Pansy and I wanted to go check you out, so I needed backup…”
Sirius laughs. Remus pulls his hand away from Harry’s chest, but before he’s had a chance to stand up, Harry reaches out and catches his wrist. Remus sinks back down and gives Harry a knowing smile, then gently strokes his head.
Grabbing his Nimbus from the hiding place under the fourposter bed, Harry puts on his boots and sneaks out of the dorm. Stopping at every corner to check the map to make sure the coast is clear and narrowingly dodging a run-in with The Bloody Baron, he slowly makes his way out of the dungeons and out into the cold night air.
”Mmm”, the elderly witch says and marches past him to the very last bookcase in the Language Section and Harry follows gingerly. ”Have a look at this one…”
Whatever Lockhart might subject Harry to, at least Professor Snape will be able to sort it out again. Not to mention, they might actually get to see Snape beat the obnoxious prat in a real wizard’s duel.
The wailing has quieted down and been replaced by tiny gasps and sobs. It’s coming from the top floor, and it’s the thought of Lily and Harry that finally manages to shake Sirius back into action. He heaves a couple of desperate breaths, then forces himself to stagger into the house. He sidesteps James’ body and tumble up the stairs.
”Don’t worry”, he mutters and his mouth contorts into a grimace that doesn’t look anything like a smile. ”You’ll see that, in the morning, everything will be… It will be…
The words gleam up at Harry for a second, before they too vanish… Harry lets out an excited breath and hurries to dip his quill in the ink bottle again and scribbles out the reply;
”Of course I did”, Draco says dismissively and bounces slightly on the balls of his feet, wringing his hands anxiously as he watches Harry step into his boots. ”Come on, I’m starving!”
Sirius’s singing morphs into a bark of laughter and he squeezes down next to Harry on the bed and proceeds to ruffle his already messy hair. Remus finishes the song by himself and then levitates the cake to hover in mid-air in front of Harry so that he can blow out the eleven candles.
As soon as they’re back in the Entrance Hall, Draco disappears under the Invisibility Cloak again and Remus leads the way back into the street outside.
”No — come on!” Hagrid protests feebly, his bruised forehead glistening with sweat now. ”I mean, a dog’ll bite yeh if yeh bait it, won’ it? — but thestrals ’ave jus’ got a bad reputation ’cause of the death thing!”
He doesn’t look at the back of his hand again, just continues writing quickly, efficiently, mechanically…
”Lie back, Harry”, Lockhart says soothingly and Harry feels his hand pushing against his shoulder. ”It’s a simple charm, I’ve used it countless of times —”
Harry had had a talk with Theo right after his short conversation with Professor Snape and stammered out an awkward apology for naming his dad in the interview — the truth is, it hadn’t even occurred to Harry at the time, when he rattled off the names of the Death Eaters present in the graveyard, that
”At the end of your first year at Hogwarts”, Remus adds and Harry’s heart does a double tap, as his mind flashes back to the moment he woke up in the Hospital Wing, after his run-in with Professor Quirrell and Voldemort.
Walking closer to the shelf, Harry squints through the dim candle-light at the small words penned to the faded label. Draco moves to stand next to him, watching his face closely and Harry can just feel him work up the courage to speak, to gently suggest they get back to Hogwarts before they get into even more trouble than they already are, but before he can say anything, Harry raises his hand slowly to stop him. His heart has begun to pound quickly again.
The more Harry thinks about it, the more certain he becomes that that’s where Draco is, maybe not at the edge of the Forest, but somewhere around the Quidditch pitch… His dads — well, his daddy — made him leave the Invisibility Cloak at home at the start of the school year, so he will definitely risk getting caught if he leaves the castle, but… He has to make sure Draco is all right!
”Yeah”, Remus says softly. ”I’ll ask Severus to keep a close eye on him tomorrow. Do you think he could have been exposed to something in your Department, something that Poppy wouldn’t be able to detect—?”
Harry nods, draping his arm over the back of Draco’s and giving his hand a grateful squeeze before shuffling around to face him.
Mind made up, Harry begins to run in the direction of the staff room. But he’s only made it a few metres, when a familiar voice calls his name. Skidding to an abrupt halt, Harry wheels back around.
He stalks over towards the marquee and Harry can see Ron and the twins standing just outside the opening. When Remus reaches them, Ron’s face goes red and he smiles nervously in greeting before gesturing for Remus to follow, then hurriedly scurries inside.
Draco tilts his head and plants a soft kiss to the inside of Harry’s wrist. And just like that, both the hurry and the awkwardness drain from the moment, leaving it heavy with affection instead. So heavy, it almost makes it hard for Harry suck some air into his lungs.
”Ehm…” Harry looks down at his plate and prods the pie slice awkwardly. ”Yeah, almost… I eh… kind of gave him an ultimatum…”
”Now then, now then, now then…” Slughorn says jovially, sinking into the straight-backed chair behind the teacher’s desk and clasping his hands on top of his large, round belly. ”Scales out, everyone, and potions kits, and lest not forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making… But before we get started, I have taken the liberty of preparing a few potions for you to have a gander at, see if you can work out what they are, eh? Just for fun, you know? Allow me to gauge your level, so to speak, what…”
He looks around half-expecting to see Hagrid lead a couple of live lions into their midst, but Seamus points to the approaching Gryffindors.
The scowl on Professor Snape’s face softens slightly and leaves him looking less furious and more mildly annoyed, which Harry will take as a victory considering his first year at Hogwarts was riddled with rule-breaking and poor potion-brewing skills — not to mention the fact that he made no secret of his suspicion that Snape was trying to steal the Philosopher’s Stone and bring Voldemort back to life…
Acting on pure instinct, Harry lunges head-first into the water and as he’s submerged in the depths of the lake, something incredible happens… the temperature of the water doesn’t feel cold as ice anymore, but rather pleasantly cool and as he gulps in a mouthful of water, he feels it pass through his new gills and as the oxygen is passed to his brain, his mind begins to clear again.
It’s not until later that night, when he’s trying and failing to sleep, that it hits Harry. She must think
”Don’t apologise!” Sirius grouses, then spins on his heel and turns his back to the tapestry, his hands deep in his pockets as he glares across the drawing room. ”I just hate being back here, that’s all… it gives me the creeps…”
”Should we speak in private?” Remus asks quietly and Harry looks over in time to see his gaze flit away from him and back to Professor Snape.
Harry feels his eyes sting and quickly spins around and runs into his bedroom, slamming the door behind him. He throws himself on his bed and curls up with his face pressed into his pillow, muffling his sniffles and waiting for his dad to come find him… Except he doesn’t. He lets Harry be, and Harry should be grateful for that, but he isn’t.
On an unspoken agreement, the both of them drag their feet as they start to amble towards the cottage. Sirius shoves his hands into his pockets and eventually comes to a stop below the small step outside the front door. He twists his body around and gazes out over Hogsmeade thoughtfully. Harry gives him a curious look, then turns to follow his gaze.
”But you said it takes years”, Harry protests. ”I’ll be in my twenties by the time I’ve finished if I don’t start now!”
he thinks wildly, the Unforgivable building up inside him as he raises the wand higher, it’s trembling tip aimed squarely at the man’s heart —
Harry glances back at the half-giant and the two winged creatures next to him. He hesitantly holds his hand up and in his peripheral, he can see Theo and Longbottom do the same.
The woman nods her approval and offers them a cup of tea. Draco checks the time and accepts, sitting down in the grass opposite Blaise, pulling Harry down next to him.
But then he remembers the talk he needs to have with Draco and decides that that is more important, not to mention urgent.
By Monday morning, the rumors about Creevy’s attack has definitely spread across the whole school. Everywhere they go, Harry is followed by relentless chorus of whispers and just like the weeks after the attack on Mrs Norris, he is once again the target of suspiscious and scared stares.
, Severus”, Remus grits out angrily. ”I merely want an explanation as to how my son has been put in mortal danger
When Harry pulls the book towards him and puts it in his lap, his dad becomes extremely distracted by a bird flitting past the kitchen window, but his speech never wavers.
”Don’t be so sure!” Lockhart says dramatically and wags his finger at the sniggering Slytherin. ”Devilish tricky little blighters they can be! Right then… Let’s see what you make of them!”
”Orange”, Snape growls. ”Really, Longbottom? Orange! Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn’t you hear me say, quite clearly, that only
”Yeah”, Harry says shortly and turns to face him for the first time since he started talking and he feels his heart break a little when realisation flares inside the grey eyes. ”I’m sorry…”
A Dementor comes gliding towards him and he collapses on the ground, feeling like all the pain in the world has settled into his limbs and frozen his veins; somewhere in the darkness a woman screams,
”And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?” Dumbledore asks calmly, but his light-blue eyes seem to be flashing behind his half-moon glasses.
Sighing heavily, Harry unties the small roll of parchment from her leg. An immediate reply can only mean bad news… the fact that Hedwig doesn’t take off again, but waits for him to read the letter, only confirms that his dads are upset…
As the pain steadily eases, Harry manages to get back on his feet and wipes the tears from his face before he tilts his head back and stares up at the centaur that just saved his life; he has white-blond hair and a palomino body, and his eyes are a light blue colour that seems to glow in the darkness.
When he walks into the Common Room, he’s nearly mauled over by a very livid Draco waving a piece of parchment around in silent fury and Harry staggers back from him and gently cradles his injured hand to his chest with a frown, but for once the cut on his hand is not the first thing the blonde notices. In fact he seems so outraged by whatever is written on the parchment, that he barely notices anything else around him.
The next time he wakes up, the dorm is still dark. Draco is cuddled up next to him on the bed, his pale fingers gripping Harry’s hand loosely in his sleep. Harry gives them a gentle squeeze and watches apprehensively as the other boy blinks his eyes open. They’re slightly swollen and bloodshot, but he still looks beautiful to Harry, who feels a weight sinking from his chest into his stomach when he thinks about what’s going to happen now… He opens his mouth to speak, but can’t get the words out.
They eat in mostly comfortable silence, Remus breaking it every so often to ask Draco about his studies and if he’s excited about the World Cup. Draco is always quick to answer politely and sits up a little straighter every time Remus talks to him, Harry notices.
… Harry stares in wonder, feeling a mix of dread and amazement. As the creatures get nearer to the paddock and he can see their plumage gleam in the sunlight, he can’t help but admire them…
As if reading his mind, Madam Pomfrey asks him if he wants to stay the night in the Hospital Wing. But Harry quickly shakes his head. He wants to go back to his dorm, so he can see Draco… Even though the other boy will probably be sleeping already when Harry gets there, he just needs to be close to him… Needs to have that reminder that they both made it out of the Chamber in one piece…
At the very back of the room, Harry’s dads are standing in front of the fireplace, and they both beam at him as he hurries over and hugs them both.
Harry quickly got to his feet as well, prepared to restrain Ron in case he decides to actually attack.
”I don’t know. I suppose so. It was sunny and the water was quite warm. I mean it was cool, but it wasn’t cold, you know…”
”Yeah, see yeh, Harry! Yeh be good now!” Hagrid’s booming voice follows Harry as he hurries off again.
”Harry Potter…” a cold, high-pitched voice rings out in the silence. ”Here you go, Nagini… Tuck in…”
