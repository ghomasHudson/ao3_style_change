“I hope you guys don’t mind but I’m going to do a few wildlife projects out here. Like a bug tower, and homes for hedgehogs and birds, and I’ll find flowers that attract bees and butterflies…” she goes on but I don’t mind what she does because she did this for us. From where we are standing at the treehouse tree, I look over to the apple tree, I wonder if that's the one..
Harry Potter
Harry Potter
“Hey, don’t speak to me like that! I did nothing wrong. I just came to say that I will speak to Ron tonight and you should go be with Draco.” I sigh and look down at my shoes, while leaning against the fireplace.
“I love it. Harry Potter, you are such a romantic.” We laugh and we kiss again. Then he places his hand next to mine on his belly and talks to the baby. “How about that Leo?” Then he pauses for a second and looks at me. “Leo James potter?” He asks shyly.
We both glance down at the bed at the same time. It’s covered in stains. It seems Harry cast a cleaning spell on just us and not the sheets. I blush.
“You’re so dead!” He said and jumped on my back while smearing his brush all over me.
The surge of jealousy I felt only moments ago tells me that I have deeper feelings for him than I have admitted to myself.
My frown deepens. How can he tell?
She holds me while we cry for another 10 minutes and then helps me up. I’m really weak and she has to help me to the bathroom. But as soon as she lets me go my knees crumble and I nearly fall. We look at each other and decide she’s going to have to help. We lived together in a tent for months so it’s not like we haven’t seen each other naked. Plus I can’t think long enough to care about it.
“You know all the wrong things.”
“Palm-twitchingly mad?” I ask nervously.
“Do you mind keeping an eye on him for a bit while we sort these Harry?” Angelina asks me.
“Come on.” We go downstairs and grab our coats, then head off to Whipped.
“What would you like to drink?”
“Like the name?” I say and put my hand on his belly. “I know your family goes for constellations and Leo is my star sign. Which I didn’t know until I looked up the name.  So I just thought it would be nice.” He looks down at his ring and I answer his unspoken question. “Yes that’s why I got your ring done like that. This baby has brought us closer than ever so I just thought he should be a part of this engagement. But if you don’t like the name I can get you a new ring.” He kisses me then to shut me up I think.
“That’s great mate.” Ron tells me.
You are so bossy.
“What’s going on? Is everything okay?” Then her eyes widen and she bounces down the rest of the stairs. “Is he in labour?!” I shush her.
I watch him run with excitement and then turn to Draco and he kind of looks like he’s about to cry.
May 24 00:10
“Me to.” He says. It's so simple and strange because Draco’s usually the one for words but that just says it all.
“And he turns up? Dray, that’s genius.”
“Oh, I exercise control in all things, Mr Malfoy.” He says this within any humour in his smile. I look at him and he gazes back steadily, impassively. My heart starts beating faster and I blush again.
Oh so he noticed that too, oops. I flush again. Is he teasing me? I hope so. I blink at him because I don’t really know what to say and he makes me nervous. He must see it in my eyes and he takes pity on me. “No, I don’t mind.”
“Why?” I whimper softly.
I’ll come to you. I meant it when I said I wasn’t happy about you flying that broom.
Harry Potter
“Yes, probably. Thank you again.” I go get Draco and we leave with a wave to Nia.
Draco Malfoy
“Your welcome. Anytime Harry.”
“I wondered if you would join me for coffee this morning?”
After the war Andy struggled a lot, she had lost her husband and her daughter and her son in law. To top it off she had a baby to look after. I tried to help out as much as I could at the time but it wasn’t enough. I was struggling to keep myself going. That’s when Draco appeared in her life and offered to help out, he even gave her Lottie to help around the house. She got back on track after a while and deals quite well nowadays. But if it wasn’t for Draco back then, Merlin knows where she would be right now. It’s actually how me and Draco met again after the war. But that’s another story.
So here’s the next chapter, we go back to the present and there’s a big reveal.
Charlie looks like he’s arguing with Ron, whose ears are turning red.
“Yes Harry, we really do. We should have talked days ago and I’m sorry for kicking you out of the room.”
“Hmm” I hum while kissing his neck and pushing my hips down into his, which made him moan loudly.
“Is he okay?” George asks. I nod while still looking over at him.
“Oh.” I stare at him dumbfounded as I stop breathing and my insides clench. Ohh….that’s so nice. I suppress a groan.
But the thought of not seeing him again is agonising. How has he gotten under my skin so quickly? It can’t just be the sex...can it? I dash my tears from my eyes. I don't want to examine my feelings for him. I’m frightened of what I’ll uncover if I do.
He grins. “I won’t.”
“Oh, please.” I hand over my jacket and smile politely.
9: Obey you in all things? Accept without hesitation your discipline? We need to talk about this.
“My room? You’re expecting me to move in?” I can’t hide the horror in my voice. Is he fucking serious?!
may 22 23:15
15.4    The Dominant shall maintain a stable and safe environment in which the Submissive may perform his duties in service of the Dominant.
“Thank you for the tea, Mr Potter.” I say and he smiles his I've-got-a-secret smile.
“What do you mean?” I ask him, confused.
“She is valedictorian, couldn't miss that. It’s not like she’ll rub it in my face for the next two weeks.” He grins back, but still looks immensely proud of his sister.
“Good evening, Mr Malfoy.” His voice is polite and professional. Harry meets me in the middle and grabs my hand, giving it a gentle squeeze that vibrates through my body.
“If I cancel now it will take months to reschedule and by then we will both have finished our finals and will have graduated. It took me 9 months of persistence to get this interview with him. Please Draco, I’m the editor and I would be so upset to miss this opportunity.” Pansy rasps at me. She is huddled under a mound of blankets with a littering of dirty tissues around her. Her black, normally straight hair, is in a messy bun and she really does look a sight.
My curiosity kicks in big time.
“No. And I don't want you touching yourself, either.”
“Well you're a good uncle, so of course you’re going to be a good dad.”
“I wanted a diet coke.” I whisper.
I wrap it up, I take it back to him and tell him how much.
“I wondered what your bedroom would look like,” he says.
“But we won’t have any sort of relationship?” I ask.
Mr Malfoy,
“Yes, it’s been a long day for me too.” We start walking, Merlin knows where, but I let him lead.
“Of course. I grew up with him. He’s the father I always wanted.”
“Tomorrow, late evening.”
“He gave me his card with his phone number and floo network.”
“Yep and the baby. Baby Rose Harriet Weasley.” I smile proudly at the name and Draco punches me lightly.
As if by magic, Hermione comes around the corner just then. She sees Draco crying and me panicking and rushes over.
“You can touch him Nia, just be careful.” She strokes his head and kisses his cheek.
“Dray, are you okay? You look odd. Is that Harry’s jacket you’re wearing?”
“It was okay...we got up every couple of hours with him and then he’d go straight back to sleep like now.” Draco tells her, then smiles down at Leo again like he can’t help it.
No activity that involves the use of the unforgivable curses.
Me and Draco both take a deep breath before heading to the door. It’s family meal day and everyone is going to be there, so it’s going to be loud as hell. Leo hasn’t experienced loud yet, so this should be good. I squeeze Draco’s hand and he smirks at me.
As I’m just about to go he stands up and offers his hand.
I get to the bathroom and Draco’s already washing his face.
“No, I’m okay thanks. Harry Potter rescued me.” He winks at me and I know his dizzy spell has passed. I go to get up but his hand stops me.  He sits up and places his hand on my check.
“Well, the difference is that I don't want to know about his sex life.” Harry murmurs dryly. “Theo’s a nosy bastard. But only about what we’ve done so far.” he warns. “She’d probably have my balls if she knew what I wanted to do to you.” he adds so softly I’m not sure I’m supposed to hear it.
“Why?”
“Let go, baby.” he murmurs. His teeth close around my nipple, and his thumb and fingers pull hard, and I fall apart in his hands, my body convulsing and shattering into a thousand pieces. That being the most intense orgasm I’ve ever had. He kisses me, deeply, his tongue in my mouth absorbing my cries.
I can’t help it. I grin, and he leans down to deliver another delicious mouthful. He shifts so he’s lying beside me, his cock hard against my hip. Oh, I want him inside me.
“We will be arriving in a few minutes.” Harry says and suddenly my heartbeat accelerates and adrenaline spikes through my system. He starts speaking to Weasley again but I stop listening. I feel faint. My fate is in his hands.
“Oh yeah.” We were both laughing quite hard now and all I felt was love for this man. This man who was the most unlikeliest of men to fall for. But I fell hard and I don’t think I could ever stop loving him. With that thought I made a plan and apparated to grimmauld place with my lover.
“Fine, you’re right. Now where’s this smudge.”
“Merlin, I’d like to give you a good hiding. You’d feel a lot better, and so would I.”
The whole table exploded in cheers and excitement. Congratulations is being shouted from everyone and both Ron and Hermione look over the moon. Ginnys shouting about being an auntie and Luna’s saying something about wrackspurts and the increase of them around pregnant people. George is saying good luck and Dean and Seamus are still staring at each other. Draco looks at me as if to say ‘I told you so’, I just roll my eyes and turn to Hermione.
His lips arch with a trace of a smile, and my eyes are drawn to his mouth.
“Why didn’t you tell me the appointment was with her. I told you my past was coming back.” He’s starting to get a bit hysterical now and I’m frightened he might have a panic attack.
Personal hygiene/beauty:
“I just remembered something Harry said.”
I open the door and she falls in on her back. She is lying on her back looking up at me with tears in her eyes. “You ready?” She says and smiles.
“Ohh. Merlin I wish I could have.” He chuckles and looks down at his stomach. I start moving towards the stairs again, thinking. We have a lot to discuss tomorrow. And we still have a house to rip out and put back together. I'll worry about that tomorrow though. For now, sleep calls for both of us.
“When did they go so close?” I ask Andy. “It’s like I’m not even here.” I snorted.
“Okay Miss Granger, you’re almost fully dilated. Do you definitely want the spell?” The healer asks Hermione after she has finished down there.
I have no answer for that. On one level it’s up there with ‘I want to bite that lip’; on another, it’s so selfish. I frown and take a bite of cod, trying to assess mentally what concessions I’ve gained. The food, the sleep. He’s going to take it slow, and we haven't discussed soft limits. But I’m not sure I can face that over food.
“I feel fat and tired and achy and bored! How are you Ginevra?! Oh and by the way, Nia is clearly A hufflepuff.” He says angrily. I send him a look telling him to cool down. Ginny just laughs though and doesn’t take any crap.
“I didn’t hear you come in.” He whispers, still facing the piano.
“Fuck, Draco.” he breaths. He pulls out of me immediately and rolls onto his side of the bed. I slide into a comfortable position and instantly drift off or pass out into an exhausted sleep.
Then the elevator stops and the doors open. He is off me and away in a blink of an eye, leaving me hanging. Three men in suits stop and look at us. They smirk and climb on board. My heart is racing. I feel like I’ve just run a marathon.
“She fell asleep on my belly.” Draco cries to her. Realisation dawns on her as she roots through her pockets.
Trust me.
“Potter?!” Malfoy says from the door. I look up and frown.
“Yes.”
“Oh….” even I hear the disbelief in her voice.
“Oh. I’ll bear that in mind.” I murmur. “Though...I’m not quite sure I’d fit in here.” Oh no, did I say that out loud?
My hips flex automatically.
“Excuse me,” I say to Mr Potter, and follow Harry out of the dining room.
“I will. I love you, Sev”
“We need to make sure you are simply irresistible for this evening.” She says, sounding more like the slytherin girl I know.
“Try saying that when she has been kicking you all day. She’s like a bloody worm today.” Hermione laughs. The baby stops kicking then, but I keep my hand there anyway. Hermione leans her head on my shoulder then. “Not long now and neither of us will be sleeping through the night.” She laughs again. “Are you scared Harry?”
“Congratulations, Mr Malfoy.” he says as he shakes my hand, squeezing gently. I feel the charge of his flesh on mine. “Do you have a problem with your laptop?”
“Only following orders….sir.” he says slowly.
“Draco, you sound distracted  - are you okay, sweetheart?”
“Thank you guys!” She lets go and I hand her the card. She looks even more excited than Teddy at his birthday party. She opens the card and reads it and then looks up to where Draco is holding a key in his hand.
“Oh, I hope so.” I admit to her.

“You are gay then?” I blurt out, my brain having frozen. Thankfully his eyes light up in amusement instead of anger.
“Yeah Hermione, I think I really do.” I grabbed her hands and gave them a small squeeze and smiled down at her.
What is that supposed to mean? I start thinking of all the possible reasons why he would say that and my mind goes into overdrive. Could it possibly be that bad?
I strain to hear him. I can make out low rumblings, and I know he’s talking to Pansy - oh no…..
I hit ‘reply’.
“Weasley. Have you brought it over?”
“Are you excited to find out the babies genders?” Neville asks Hermione and Draco, who are the closest to him.
“Don't what?” I haven't touched him.
“Come on then, we best be going. I can’t believe we forgot.” I hit my hand against my forehead.
“Of course babe.” I get up and give him a kiss and then sit next to him on the sofa.
I groan and desperately fight the urge to thrust, pulling on my restraint. Oh no….
“He likes you, Draco, that's why.” She drops her arm from around me.
The rest goes quite quickly, but not too quickly, and we are both on our backs sweating and trying to catch our breath.
“Actually it's guy Hermione”, I intervened quickly to stop the rant, “we know who it is but not how he’s doing it. So we can't bring him in as we have nothing on him.”
“Okay.” I say as casually as possible and carry on with my moving and kissing every inch of his beautiful pale neck.
“What do you mean?”
Soft limits
I nod, impassive.
“Oh.” I gasp. Why?
He closes his eyes and presses his forehead against mine, giving us both the opportunity to slow our breathing. After a moment, he kisses my forehead, inhales deeply, his nose in my hair, and then releases me, stepping back.
“No. I have work to do.” he says simply, gazing at me, his expression unfathomable.
“Yeah well, you’d hand her over to anyone too if she’d been up all night screaming.” He said half jokingly. Hermione whacked him for it anyway and we got on with the tour.
We chat for a bit in that same position, neither of us wanting to move. Also I don’t think either of us want to start the conversation we’re about to have. So we just won’t, not yet anyway.
“No!” It’s my turn to sound exasperated. “Introduce you to my godfather as what? ‘This is the man who took my virginity and wants us to start a BDSM relationship’? You’re not wearing running shoes.”
“Guys! What are you doing here?” I ask, holding Draco’s arm while trying to hurry over. Draco is too slow to do anything in a rush nowadays though.
“Merlin, too much information!” Ron blurted and made a sick face. I quickly threw a pillow at him for it. He burst out laughing then.
“That means a lot to me, Dray.” He whispers in my ear. “Another margarita?”
“Likewise,” Sev drawls. “Look after my godson.”
“Would you like a drink?” Politeness wins out over everything else I’d like to say.
“It's okay. You’re okay. Shhh.” I keep repeating. He seems to have stopped being sick for now so I accio the washcloth for him and he wipes his face. He puts it to the side and looks at me with tears starting to fall from his eyes.
Standing behind Potter is a man about the same age with the brightest ginger hair I’ve ever seen. It’s cut short and he has stubble. He is dressed in a suit and looks very sharp. His blue eyes are watching everyone as he stands quietly behind.
“Yeah I did, didn’t I. I’m just really craving it.” He keeps looking through the bag, but he wont find any. Then Nia laughs.
“Business is all about people, Mr Malfoy, and I’m very good at judging people. I know how they tick, what makes them flourish, what doesn’t, what inspires them, and how to incentivize them. I employ an exceptional team, and I reward them well.” He stops for a moment at this and gazes at me. “My belief is to achieve success in any scheme one has to make oneself master of that scheme, know it inside and out, know every detail. I work hard, very hard to do that. I make decisions based on logic and facts, I have a natural gut instinct that can spot and nurture a good solid idea and good people. The bottom line is it’s always down to good people.”
Where 1 is likes intensely and 5 is dislikes intensely:
“Thank you.”
I go bright red. I was just imagining myself running my fingers through your hair and wondering how soft it was. I just shake my head and look down again.
I go into our bedroom and close the door softly. Draco is just putting Leo down to sleep. I go over and kiss his head too.
“Oh be quiet George!” She says and glares at him.
“Oh, I fully intend to.”
“Morning.” I gratefully took my plate and tucked in. Ron was a great cook and must get his talent from Molly because I know for certain that Arthur can’t cook. I noticed Ron and Hermione looking from one another to him and back again, and decided to let them sweat a bit longer, Hermione at least deserved it.
“Mr Potter.” I nod in acknowledgment. I sit down and wince slightly.
“Didn't know you worked on the student newspaper, Draco.” Sev’s voice is quiet admonishment, revealing his irritation.
“Okay, I'll see what I can do Mr Potter. One moment please.” She disappeared for a couple of minutes and then was back. “Okay mediwitch Bell has a free appointment at 10 past 4, is that okay?”

“I really am sorry though Dray.”
“Do you feel that you have immense power?” I ask quickly and without thinking again. Control freak.
Weasley has bought me new black jeans, a pale blue T-shirt, new converse, socks, and underwear. They all fit perfectly and the jeans are amazing. They make my arse look great. I briefly feel weird that Weasley picked all these out but soon forget about it.
“Why?”
“But you're very high-handed.”
“Well I’m off, I wonder if he’s back yet?” Hermione says half to herself on her way to the door.
This chapter is set 3 years in the past. X
“Draco! I’ve heard so much about you.” She hugs me hard.
“I know.” he says, and for a split second sweet, young, carefree Harry is back. It warms my heart. He’s so excited. Boys and their toys. I roll my eyes at him but can’t stifle my smile. He opens the door for me and I climb in. whoa...it’s low. He moves around the car with easy grace, and folds his long frame elegantly in beside me. How does he do that?
“I assume you’re not taking any contraceptive potions.”
I nod, my eyes wide, my hands on his forearms. I feel so full. He stays still, letting me adjust to the intrusive, overwhelming feeling of him inside me.
“Harry!” She put her arms wide and waited for me to walk into them to give me a hug. “And Draco dear.” She touched his cheek and gave him a hug too. “So good to see the two of you.” She pushed us together then and eyed us up. She always did this to make sure we weren’t too skinny. She’s not been able to tell me I’m too skinny since starting at the aurors though. But she still tells Draco every time. “Yes, so good!” She seemed to stop at Draco’s midsection and didn’t say anything about how skinny he was which made me slightly nervous. So I moved us over to the rest of the family.
“I’ve told you I’m okay.”
“And right now, I want to peel you out of those clothes.”
“Don’t let grandma hear you say what?” Andromeda came into the hallway and inclined her eyebrow at us.
“Hmm, I like it when you beg me, Draco.”
“He was in the area.” I tell her, trying to keep my voice casual and the smile off my face.
“I proposed to Draco last week and he said yeah.” Then I smile and look at Draco. He is playing with Freddie and he looks amazing, I can’t get enough of him.
“Of course, Severus. Can’t I be happy to see you?”
"Who's Rolf?" I ask Luna, only for Theo to interrupt her and answer himself.
I put my tea bag in my cup of hot water and watch it change colour. It reminds me of my mind, a whirl.
“Right Harry, here I have his diet,” she hands me one piece of paper. “This is the things he’s allergic to,” she hands me another piece. “This is his exercise regimen, he needs at least 2 walks a day.” She hands me another piece of paper. “And finally, this is the things he likes to play with, and things he will try to play with but shouldn’t.” She hands me the last 2 pieces of paper and goes over to help Ron get crookshanks out of the carrier. I look at the pieces of paper in my hand and go speechless. Did she say I had to walk the bloody cat?! No way was that happening. I look over and she’s hugging the damn thing, he really only likes Hermione and he puts up with Ron because Hermione loves him.
“Hey Neville! Hey Hannah!” Nia says happily and skips over there. I throw my hands up and sigh. Then I remember I’m the teacher and throw a stinging hex at her leg.
“How do you know if you never tell him how you feel?” She kind of had a point there but I wasn’t going to tell her that.
We’ve cut to the chase quickly.
“That’s great! Can we take the baby to the park with us? Is it a boy or a girl? When’s it going to be born? Are you going to get fat Draco, like Fleur was?” He says rather quickly and then puffs up his cheeks and puts his arms out around his belly pretending to be fat. “Like this?” He says and walks around the room woddleing. I chuckle at that and Draco wacks my arm.
My mouth drops open and I am staggered by his lack of humility. Of course, I would know all this if I had done some research. Still, he’s acting like an arrogant prick. I decide to change tack and go back to Pansy’s questions.
“You seem nervous around men. You are gay right?”
“Dray?” she whispers. I open the door. She takes one look at me and throws her arms around me.
may 23 08:22
“I’m really starting to worry now Draco, you're scaring me. What is going on? Is it the house? If you really don’t like it, I will sell it.”
“Please start, everyone,” Lily smiles as she hands me a plate and leaves.
Does the Submissive consent to accept the following forms of pain/punishment/discipline:
“I’ll sit on a cushioning charm on the grass and watch you two.” He tells me and we go outside.
“Notre coeur.” He says with ease, but still is ignoring me for his book.
“Come on love, lets go to grimmauld and watch some tv and have something to eat, yeah?” I tell him and lift his face. I wipe his face with my sleeve and kiss him. He nods and I help him stand.
I make a stab at my food and take a long drink of my water. I vehemently wish it was wine.
I look at my kids and then the photos, and the sofas, and the room. I think of each room and the fun we’ve had in it. I think of the pond outside and the swing and the treehouse. I think of the stables with horses in and the orchard with apple trees. Then I think back on how this all started and I’m so grateful to Hermione. She really did see greatness in this house. And instead of breaking us, this house made us a family.
“How are you settling into your new apartment, dear?” Lily asks politely.
“This baby is going nowhere yet. He’s in here for another 10 weeks.” Everyone is laughing and retreating inside. 10 weeks. That’s all that's left before we meet Leo. I hope we’re ready.
“Yeah, fuck.” I say sleepily.  I hope he wants to do that again sometime.
Potter gives me a dazzling, unguarded, natural, all-teeth showing, glorious smile. Oh Merlin. I nearly drop right there and then. I turn away and head back to Pansy and Blaise.
“Hey cub, you know you can’t have hair that colour when we are around muggles.” He sulks a bit but his hair slowly changes to a white blonde the same as Draco’s. Draco turns to me and smirks. “That’s because you told him no.” He whispers to me. I shove him playfully and take his hand and Teddy’s.
I scowl.
“The line was long for the bar.” I tell her and avoid her eye. I take a big sip of my drink and regret it instantly.
“It looks amazing in here!” I tell draco. We are adding last minute things like cushions and a mini fridge.
June 5th.
“Yes okay I promise, i'll tell my boss and then i'll come with you.” Draco lets her up and she goes behind the counter. A minute later she is back with her bag in hand.
Internet research
“So Robards is going to try and contact Ron but it could take a couple of hours.” I say to her slowly. She’s breathing in and out and holding her lower back. When she hears me though she stops with the breathing exercises and learns forward in pain.
“No!” He says and crosses his arms. He shrinks back a bit and looks at Hermione. She just shrugs.
Pansy had ordered me to shave my face and legs (which I usually do anyway but they did need another quick shave) and then she had very intrusively plucked my eyebrows, put some mascara on my eyelashes to make them look longer and gave my teeth a very strong cleaning spell. She had assured me that Potter wouldn’t be able to resist. I had to promise her that I would text her as soon as we arrived in London. I told her we were flying but not by broom and she had a freak, naming all the dangerous ways we could fly to London.
Personal qualities:
“you’re beautiful.”
Harry Potter just sent me a winking smiley…..
“It’s okay. I told you, remember, together.” I feel him nod against my shoulder and help him up and onto the bed.
“Firecall your mother,” he says.
“I’d like to congratulate Nia on her new job. As the new potions master at my shop.” Everyone starts clapping but I frown.
“Thanks guys, now let's go join the party.” I chuckle.
Back to the present. Enjoy x
“I think if i had had another drink, I would have either been naked or on the floor,” i said hysterically, “or both.” I added.
“That’s a good idea.” I tell her about the pub. “Draco’s….cranky.” I decide with. Nia slaps my hand lightly.
want to feed the world. I desperately rack my brains to remember what Pansy had written in her article. Adopted at age four, I think. I can’t imagine that Lily starved him, so it must have been before then, as a little boy. I swallow, my heart constricting at the thought of a hungry, green-eyed toddler.

Harry Potter
“The guy from yesterday, at the pub. He’s not your boyfriend?”
Okay. what to do? My inexperience is an albatross around my neck. Picking up a spear of asparagus, I gaze at him and bite my lip. Then very slowly put the tip of my cold asparagus in my mouth and suck it.
“Why can’t I look at you?”
“Dray.” Blaise is at my side. “You okay?”
“My mother is wonderful. My father, not so much. She supports me through everything whereas he doesn’t even see me as a son sometimes. My Godfather practically raised me.”
A flogger….hmm. I think I'm in shock. I can observe and absorb but not articulate my feelings about all this. What IS the appropriate response to finding out a potential lover is a complete freaky sadist or masochist? Fear! Yes, that seems to be the overriding feeling. I recognise it now. But weirdly not of him - I don’t think he’d hurt me, well, not without my consent. So many questions cloud my mind, why? How? When? How often? Who?
“Wait, so you haven’t told him?” He says with a bit of excitement.
“Hmm.” He replies. What is he thinking?
I open my eyes reluctantly. It’s dusk outside. Harry is leaning over, gazing at me intently.
“Malfoy. Have you seen Andy around?” I ask him as politely as I could. His eyes go wide for a second and then his eyebrow goes up.
“Draco, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know and-“ He cuts me off with a light slap of my arm that’s on his chest.
I bristle. “I don't think so,” I murmur.
“Leo! Lily! Sirius! Scorpius!” He kisses each one on the head as they hug him. “Scorpius, Sirius, how’s slytherin?” He asks them. This was their first year in Hogwarts and both got sorted into slytherin. Lilys in Ravenclaw and Leo is a gryffindor.
“I’m fine.” I tell him, finding my voice. “Thank you.” I mutter, humiliated. I want his hands off me but at the same time don't want him to ever let go. How could I have misread this situation so much? I need to get away from him right now.
I inhale sharply. Vanilla sex?
He is so waiting for me to say something.
When we get there, we head to our usual table and Nia waves to us.
“That’s not the point. Why should you buy these for me?” Oh right yeah, he vanished my other clothes. But still!
“I can’t thank you enou-“ I start saying to Nia when Draco digs his fingers in my side.
“Hey, Harry, d’you get laid?”
“Stop biting your lip. It’s very distracting, especially when you are hardly wearing anything.”
“Harry - I can’t move.”
We finally leave the house with Leo in his pram, and Apparate to Andys. We walk up to the front door with me pushing the pram and Draco hanging onto my arm. He knocks on the door and Lottie answers.
“I’m a beneficial effect, now am I? Could you wound my ego any further, Mr Malfoy?”
“So you’re with him now?” His tone is full of disdain.
I lay back against the pillows and thought of Draco for about a second before Hermione popped her head back in and said, “now Harry!” and slammed the door. That made me jump up again much like I had when she had woken me not so long ago.
you trust me, Dray?”
“Harry! I’m so sorry.” He cries into my neck. I distantly hear the floo go again but ignore it.
“I really am sorry Harry.” He looks up with big eyes and how could I ever stay mad at him, except he’s not to blame. I start to protest when he kisses me. Then he chuckles and says “it must be the wrackspurts causing pregnancy brain.” We laugh together at that and share another kiss.
George came up to us then to say hello with 2 year old Fred on his shoulders. The little boy was giggling and holding on to his dad's forehead. Angelina shouted over to be careful with her son but George just rolled his eyes and carried on wiggling his shoulders and making his son giggle.
“SHIT! No way!” He shouts so loud that some birds in the trees get scared and take flight. Then he starts ripping the packaging open.
I do. But where to start?
We get going on the dining room again, this time Draco is doing the cleaning while I’m trying to fix the wall with magic. The wireless was on quietly and Draco was chatting to me, but I was too preoccupied with the wall to talk much.
“Come, I have a private dining room booked. No public.” He smiles at me enigmatically and climbs out of the booth, holding his hand out to me.
“I love you to Dray.”
I breathe deeply and collapse backwards onto the bed. That man is so confusing! He’s also kind of a tease, I think looking at my tented underwear. I roll my eyes and flip over onto my front. My hormones are racing and I feel needy and achy. Is this desire? Is this what that feels like?
“Okay Draco, next contraction I want you to start pushing okay?” Katie tells him after a couple of minutes. He nods and I can tell when it’s starting because he leans back ever so slightly and squeezes my hand tighter. “Push.” She says and he starts pushing.
There’s a knock on the door and then, without giving time to answer, Harry walks in. I can’t seem to find my voice and one look at him gets my heart pounding. Oh merlin...he’s all sweaty.
“Sorry Andromeda’s, is everything okay?” I ask her and look over to Teddy. He’s still asleep in his basket.
I thought I’d got away with this.
“Please, Draco.” As soon as I hear that on his tongue again, my heart starts pounding. He caresses my name and it sounds so...intimate coming from him. I can hardly breath and hurry to get him a bag.
“Oh….please.” I whisper. I try to stiffen my legs as my body goes rigid. I am in a sexual thrall to this man, and he doesn't let me move.
“Hello Draco, I’m.....pleased to see you too,” he mutters as he hugs me back slightly. Setting me back down, his hands are on my shoulders, he looks me up and down, his brow furrows. “Are you okay?”
“So, how did you end up in the barn Nia?”
“Yes actually, I’ve found you the most paradisal house Harry. I've been and looked at it myself and I could see it! You, Draco, and a few children running around. It’s absolutely perfect Harry and you have to go immediately and buy it.” Hermione seemed very excited about this, she was practically vibrating. What she had said made me actually look up and smile at her contrary to my previous mood.
Early the next morning Katie floos in. Me and Draco are both awake watching a sleeping Leo in his basket. Draco has just fed him again and put him back down. Katie quietly knocks on the door and smiles at what she sees when she walks in.
“Neither are you.” I tell him.
“So if she was a friend of your mother’s, how old was she?”
Draco is on his front on his bed, sobbing his heart out. I go up to the bed and slowly place my hand on his back. He jumps slightly and looks to see who it is. I think he is expecting his mother though because he quickly turns back around and shouts into the pillow.
“Or girl!” Hermione said coming in with her chin held high, about to spout about equality to us.
“Next?”
Delighted you had a good day.
I rub my wrists reflectively. I cannot take my eyes off him. He’s wearing that tie on purpose, no doubt. My mouth presses into a hard line. The audience sits down and the applause ceases.
“Well, when uncle Draco was saying those things, it didn’t seem right. It made me upset because I love you both and so should everyone else. And you guys gave me the best birthday ever, so I wanted to do something for you. Just because you’re two men, doesn’t mean you can’t love each other. And just because you both have different pasts, doesn’t mean you can’t have a future. Right? Why can’t everyone see that?” He’s so young and innocent at this moment, that it brings tears to my eyes.
“Are you impressed?”
“And I’m seeing him again tonight.” She claps and jumps up and down like a small child. She can’t contain her happiness and excitement and I’m so happy for her. A happy Pansy Parkinson...this is going to be interesting.
“If you were my Sub, you wouldn’t have to think about this. It would be easy.” His voice is soft, seductive. “All those decisions - all the wearying thought processes behind them. The ‘is this the right thing to do? Should this happen here? Can it happen now?’ you wouldn't have to worry about any of that detail. That’s what I’d do as you Dom. And right now, I know you want me, Draco.”
I take a deep breath and stand up. I wipe my face and head for the stairs. I am just going to chalk this up to experience, move on and concentrate on my exams.
“This is next-generation tech.” She raises her eyebrows at me. “Most people get flowers, chocolates, maybe jewellery.” she says suggestively, trying to suppress a smile.
“No!” I say too quickly and my voice too high. He cocks his eyebrow at me. “.....not anymore.” I whisper and blush. I look down to avoid his intimidating eyes.
“Amelia.”
“I didn't think you were familiar with the Bible.”
The food was lovely as always and time ran away from me. Teddy had long been put to bed and drinks were poured for us adults. Me and Andromeda sat by the fire talking and laughing and just having a good time. When I eventually realised it was dark outside I decided it was time to go back to grimmauld place. I thanked Andy for tea and for her company and told her I’d see her tomorrow. Then i went over to the fireplace and floo’d home. As soon as my feet hit the floor I was assaulted by screaming.
“It’s okay babe, go back to sleep. I love you so much and you did so well today.” I kiss him on the nose and he smiles.
Submissive [
may 23 17:48
“This is the nondisclosure agreement.” He shrugs and has the grace to look a little embarrassed. “My lawyer insists on it.” He hands it to me and I’m completely bemused. “It’s magical. And it’s needed if you want this to go any further.” He smooths his thumb over my knuckles once more and makes me shiver.
I hope you guys are liking this. I’ve given up trying to put my own twist on it and just doing what I can to make it Drarry compatible. Any comments and kudos are much appreciated. Thanks so far! X
“Yes, it was quite the experience for me too.”
“I don’t know Harry! I don’t know what I’m doing.” He sits up and leaves me to fall forward where he just was. I ignore the twinge of hurt and sit behind him while kissing the back of his neck now.
“I sowwy, uncle hawwy.” I can hear he’s near tears so I look down at him.
“I felt that your email warranted a reply in person.” he explains dryly.
“Better than I deserve.” I groan at him.
“If you call that a proposal then you are more of an oaf than i thought.” He got up and held his hand out. “Come on oaf, we are going back to yours and you are cooking me my favourite dinner, remember.” I grabbed his hand and he hauled me up. I smiled at him and gave his mouth another quick kiss.
“Drink it Harry! Now!”
An hour later, I was back at grimmauld place. I had sent Draco a patronus back at Hagrids because I couldn’t make him wait.
“I don't think that’s a good idea,” I murmur quietly. “We haven't had dessert yet.”
“It’s fine. May I hold Teddy please?” I ask him before he goes. He nods and turns around to give me the baby. He is still crying but as soon as Draco puts him in my arms he stops. He opens his eyes and they turn green, then his hair goes black. I gasp and look at Andy.
“Of course sorry. Oh wow, it’s so...so amazing.” Then she starts tearing up. She gets her picture out and shows Draco. Then Draco starts tearing up. Oh boy.
“Yeah I think we have too, love.”  I put one hand on his slightly protruding belly and gave him a kiss. “And I wouldn't change it for the world.”
“Merlin, you’re a shit Malfoy!” I grabbed him around the waist and lifted him up while spinning. He shrieked with laughter which made me laugh and spin some more. “POTTER! Put me down this instant!” He tried to say seriously but utterly failed while ending it with a laugh. When I eventually put him down, we were both out of breath and grinning at one another. I was just about to speak up when he grabbed my face and planted his lips on mine. It didn’t last as long as I would have hoped as we were both still out of breath and had to pull apart. But it was the best first kiss I could have asked for between us. His lips were so smooth and delicate, and his hands were ever so gentle on the sides of my face. I had also managed to put my hands on him. I can’t remember doing so, but there they both were on either side of his hips pulling him closer. It felt like it went on forever but not long enough and that we were in our own little world without a care for the real one.
“Draco, you don’t deserve anything bad to happen to you. Why are you saying that?”
I am plagued by one question - why is he like this? Is it because he was seduced at such a young age? I just don't know. He’s still such a mystery.
“I don’t subscribe to luck or chance, Mr Malfoy. The harder I work the more luck I seem to have. It really is all about having the right people on your team and directing their energies accordingly.”
“Ow.” I rub my arm where he hit me. “Yes Teddy, they can come to the park with us. We don’t know yet if its a boy or girl, and the little cherry is due October 26th.”
Good point, well made, as ever, Mr Malfoy. I will collect you from Hogwarts at 7:00 tomorrow.
“Oh. Does your mother know?”
“It's okay, open your eyes.” He says to me. I open them and nearly scream. We are in the air, flying over Hogsmeade. I look down and feel nauseous. Oh fuck! I squeeze Harry and hide in his back again.
“So, how did the doctors go?”
Mrs Potter holds her hand out to me.
“Oh yes please uncle Draco.”
“Dray.” He smiles his dazzling toothy smile, which his dark skin makes appear brighter, and I can’t be angry with him anymore.
May 24 18:32
The moment is interrupted by a phone ringing. For a minute I think it’s mine but before I have even gone to reach for it Harry has his to his ear.
“Merlin, you're not even showing yet Hermione. How are you 15 weeks pregnant and not showing?” I ask her because surely by 15 weeks you must be showing. How long will I have to wait to see a bump on Draco.
“ARRY!’ He says and takes me in a painful hug. “What are you doin here?” He lets me down and then fang comes out.
“Hermioneee, I drinking tha.” I say drunkenly.
“Blaise, I’ll call you later. I can’t talk to you now.” I hang up.
About an hour later, I’m giving Teddy his bottle when I hear the door open. I figure it’s Andromeda so I don’t bother getting up. I’m sitting in the armchair feeding Teddy and it’s sort of relaxing. Next thing I hear stops the relaxing feeling and panic sets in.
“So you never dated anyone at school?”
“A jacket.”
We are getting ready to go now and things aren’t going smoothly.
“Yes please.” I give in.
“That sounds great. Thank you professor! Nia will be so happy, and Draco too.” I laugh at how surprised he’s going to be.
“Wow.” I say to Teddy while trying not to laugh.
“Yes” I answer in a nervous, hardly there voice. I clear my throat and repeat “yes” in a more confident voice. Come on Malfoy, you got this.
“I’m fine, I’ll see you later.” I blow her a kiss, grab my bag, and head out the door.
At just gone 8 o’clock, Katie checks him again. He has had his pain reduction spell but the contractions are just getting worse. Katie has set up the birthing pool while I’ve been walking around and sitting with Draco. She kept checking him and still nothing. But he just said he feels he needs to push so she checked him again.
“Oh go and get yourself injured. Maybe your muscles will save you.”
“Thank you, I think she feels a bit guilty.”
“There’s no nicer wizard than you,” he murmurs, then kisses me sweetly. “Well, that’s brought some colour to your cheeks, Mr Malfoy. Thank you for the dance. Shall we go and meet my parents?”
“What is it?” I mumble sleepily.
We chat for a bit longer and then Hermione says she has to get back to work. We say our goodbyes and she goes through the floo.
“So, why did he turn up here today?"
15.13   The Submissive accepts the Dominant as his master, with the understanding that he is now the property of the Dominant, to be dealt with as the Dominant pleases during the Term generally but specifically during the Allotted Times and any additional agreed allotted times.
He hands me a quill.
“So, did you?” Pansy asks as soon as she shuts the door.
“I don’t know. She’s either shopping or cleaning. You find her yourself Malfoy.”
Harry shrugs innocently.
“What do you mean phew it worked?” Came Andromeda's voice from the doorway.
“Love you.” He whispers, still half asleep.
“And whatever you do, don’t shag the twat.” Ron shouted just before green flames enveloped him. I laughed despite myself at that. Having them two over had definitely calmed me down and made time go faster, so i guess I was ready. I took one last look in the mirror and happy with how I looked, sat down on the chair to wait for Draco. It was 5 exactly now and he shouldn't be too long.
“That’s great! Thank you so much.”
The next week goes pretty much the same. Me and Draco go to the house, or ‘Notre coeur’ as Draco keeps calling it, and work on the house until lunch. Then we go to ‘whipped’ and have our lunch. At 4 o’clock Nia joins us and helps clean. Around tea time we send Nia on her way back to the barn and lock up. We go to Andy’s most nights for tea but one night we went to Molly’s and one night we spent at mine. Then suddenly it’s Friday and Draco is 11 weeks pregnant. The next scan is tomorrow and I can’t wait. We get to see what the little cherry looks like this week Draco said.
“Oh yeah, let me get my wand.” She starts going up the stairs but I stop her.
“Eating my asparagus.”
“I don’t care, I’m your boyfriend. Please Draco…” Finally I hear the door unlock and open it wide to see Draco sat on his knees in front of the toilet. I go over to him and kneel down. He’s throwing up again now so i hold his hair out of his face and rub his back.
“Oh right sorry Harry. Well I just came to see how your date went?” She asked having recovered from the scene before.
He steps back, regarding me coolly, and his shoulders relax.
“Couple of weeks or so now,” he says smoothly. “We met when Draco came to interview me for the student newspaper.”
“Haven’t seen you around for a few weeks Potter, have you been rolling around in all your fame?” He sneers at me, but I don’t take the bait.
I nod.
Holy shit.
“Well, you know a lot more about me now.” he snaps, his mouth presses into a hard line. “I knew you were inexperienced, but a fucking virgin!” He says it like it’s a dirty word. I feel like I’m about to breakdown but I won’t give him the satisfaction. “Hell, Draco, I just showed you….” he groans. “Merlin. Have you ever been kissed, apart from by me?”
“Does this mean that you are going to make love to me tonight, Harry?” Holy shit. Did I actually just say that?! His mouth drops open slightly, but he quickly recovers.
He increases the rhythm infinitesimally and his breathing becomes more erratic. Harry keeps picking up the rhythm and I can feel my orgasm coming closer.
“Can I come over? I’m sorry about Friday night. I was drunk….and you….well. Draco - please forgive me.”
“Harry, wait!” Hermione shouts.
“I could try.” I whisper.
Soon enough we were back at the house and as promised we took a walk around the fields to see if we could find any apple trees left standing. The first field we looked in was the one with the stables in. It was just a bare field with overgrown grass and four shaky looking stables. The next field was a lot bigger and had a few trees here and there but no apple trees.
“Yeah we are good thanks mate-“ Ron says but Hermione interrupts with a squeak.
Harry Potter
“Bye guys! Have a lovely time! And don’t worry, the cat will be fine.” I go to stroke him to prove he’s okay but he swipes his claws at my hand. I laugh nervously and wave Ron and Hermione off.
I stumble over to the phone and ring Ron. After 3 rings Ron answers in a croaky voice.
“It was the summer between primary school and high school that I found out about my dad. I had gotten a letter from a place called Hogwarts telling me I could go there and learn magic and spells just like my father had. Things had always happened for untold reasons growing up, like things changing colours and things floating like bubbles. So as soon as I read ‘magic’ in that letter, I believed and knew it was true. When I asked him about it, he sat me down and told me I was never going to be a part of that world. He told me it was evil and that magic killed people. He told me I was innocent and pure minded and they would corrupt that. He said he left because he found my mum and he was grateful for the opportunity to get out. He ripped my letter up and that was that. He never spoke of it again….neither of us did. I went to a normal high school after the summer ended and things stopped happening by accident. Then when I was 12 bad things were happening around the country. Crazy things were happening all over and I was pretty sure it was magic even though the government had their excuses. One night I was woken up by what sounded like thunder and looked like lightning. I love thunderstorms so I sat up in bed but before I could open my curtains, my dad came rushing in and slammed the door. He had a stick in his hand and said something at the door. I didn’t understand it though. He looked crazy, and he was telling me they were here for him. He had to make a choice, he said. But he wasn’t going to go dark, he told me. He couldn’t do that. He told me he was sending me away, some place they couldn’t find me and that I would be safe there. As long as I stayed there and stayed hidden, they didn’t know about me. He started packing some of my things in my backpack and told me to get changed and pack what I wanted. So I started packing another bag. He pulled something out his pocket and said something else with his stick. The thing in his hand started growing and he placed it on the floor. It was a heavy looking trunk, the kind they had in the olden days. He sat me on it and passed me a carrier bag of what looked like food and my backpack. I had the bag that I had packed in one hand, the carrier bag in the other and the backpack on my shoulder. Then he got down and looked me in the eye. He said ‘I’m sending you to a safe place. Stay there until I come find you. You’ll have food and water to last a few weeks and your birth certificate and passport are in that trunk. Keep these things safe and stay hidden. My trunk has everything you need to stay safe if I don’t make it back. Me and your mother love you so much’. Then he kissed me and pointed his stick at me. I tried to shout and grab out but suddenly it felt like I was being pulled apart and put back together. And then I was somewhere else. That barn in fact, and I’ve been there ever since. But something happened when my dad sent me away. I landed and looked down to a small puddle of blood forming. My arm looked like it had been sliced open multiple times. I fainted and when I woke up, it was scared over.”
“For how long?” Harry asks, his voice deceptively soft.
“oh….please…..Harry…..Sir…...please.” He’s driving me insane. I
“Yes, sir. Which car are you taking, sir?”
I enter the castle with ease and get some odd stares. Either they think I’m a weird stranger, or they know exactly who I am. As I’m walking towards the stairs, I hear steps approaching.
“Night love.”
I push his drink towards him and he grabs it. Our fingers graze and there's that current zapping through me again. It goes straight to my dick and I gasp and let go.
“Well….yes.”
“No! Thanks Hermione but we just wanna be on our own for now.” I tell her.
“Hmm, delicious. Tastes of the sea.” He grins at me. “Go on,” he encourages.
He hands me an envelope.
I go to say some of the old sweet passwords like sherbet lemon, but change my mind and instead say. “Dumbledore.” And the staircase starts moving. I should have known it would still be that, or maybe she changed it back for me.
“Nia, are you okay up in the barn? Do you need anything?” Draco asks her as she too makes her way out.
“Merlin and Morgana, I thought something had happened.” I breathe for a minute and then look at Hermione. She looks in pain and I freeze. “Are you okay?”
“Oh healer Williams, Thank god. This is Harry, my best friend.” Hermione says and takes a gasp. The healer comes up to Hermione and does a vitals check spell.
silver-grey woven tie that leaves small impressions of its weave on my skin. He moves so quickly, sitting astride me as he fastens my wrists together, but this time, he ties the other end of the tie to the headboard of my bed. He pulls at my binding, checking it’s secure. I’m not going anywhere. I’m tied, literally, to my bed, and I’m so aroused.
“Tomorrow. I want an answer by tomorrow.”
“Oh Harry. I think we should leave today. I was going to call you, Teddy isn’t very happy today. I don’t want you to have to deal with this.” She looked like she was about to cry or scream herself.
“He doesn't approve of Wanda.”
“Just straightforward sex, Draco. No toys, no add-ons.” He shrugs. “You know….well, actually you don't, but that’s what it means.”
“Okay good, one 2 options left.”
“Miss Parkinson is expected. Please sign in here, Mr Malfoy. Then take the last elevator on the right and press for the twentieth floor.” He smiles at me again as I sign in and I’m sure he’s amused.
“May I take your picture, Mr Potter?” he asks. Harry nods and I move to the side out of the frame. But Harry grabs my arm and pulls me back to him. He holds me around the waist and looks back towards the camera. I look up to him and then give a small smile to the camera.
“What. The. Fuck?!” Ron says deadly calm. “Harry? We have been trying to call you and get through the floo for 2 days? You haven’t been to work, you haven’t seen Teddy, you didn’t even go to mums yesterday. We finally come around thinking you're dead and have to blow your front door off its hinges just to get it, and you're sitting here drinking?!” He throws his hands up and looks at Hermione. “I can’t deal with this right now. I need to get back to work. ‘Mione just… just-“ He shakes his head at me and throws his arm out and then just leaves.
“Merlin and Morgana Draco!” I hadn’t even heard the floo go, my mind was too preoccupied.
“There’s always room for Teddy, right Draco?” I say and look to him for support.
“Oh you're in the house now then?” She says excitedly. I roll my eyes at her and smile, she drops her excitement then “what?”
He is currently at his and I’m meeting him there at 5. I won't give him his present until later though.
“Mmhhmm.” He nods and yawns. “Yeah, they can come up.”
“How long have you worked here?” He asks me then. I turn back around and he is gazing at me and concentrating hard. I blush and wonder why he has this effect on me.
“Draco, just relax and have fun. Do you want to top or bottom, I don’t mind either way as long as you’re comfortable.” He frowns then and pushes me away slightly. I know he's using his mask as a safety net because he’s embarrassed.
“You’d be amazed.” He says dryly.
Harry Potter is holding my hand! Nobody has ever held my hand before and it makes me feel giddy. There is a ridiculous grin on my face that I try to hide. Play it cool.
“Babe, you can’t sit on pregnant people.” She tells Luna.
“Of course Teddy, go ahead love.” Hermione says and sits back down next to Ron.
He’s silent for a moment.
“Have you got any names for the little guy?” Katie asks while she examines Draco again for the afterbirth.
That’s a long list. Why are you still up?
I fire-call Severus, who is just about to brew a potion, so our conversation is mercifully brief. He’s flooing over on Thursday for graduation. He wants to take me out afterwards for a meal. My heart swells talking to Severus, and a huge lump forms in my throat. He has been my constant through all the fights with my parents, mainly my father. We have a special bond that I treasure. Even though he’s my godfather, he’s always treated me as his own, and I can’t wait to see him. It’s been too long. His quiet fortitude is what I need now, what I miss. Maybe I can channel my inner Severus for my meeting tomorrow.
“Draco, how lovely to see you again.” Lily wraps me in a warm hug. “Come in, my dear.”
15.2   The Dominant accepts the Submissive as his, to own, control, dominate, and discipline during the Term. the Dominant may use the Submissive’s body at any time during the Allotted Times or any agreed additional times in any manner he deems fit, sexually or otherwise.
“Okay.” Is all I say.
Hannah and Neville just nod and exchange glances. I show them the plants and then they take off. So I continue my lesson with Nia and she doesn’t turn her back again.
The quote is from Tess. From the novels of Thomas Hardy, whom I have just spent 3 hours writing about. I inspect the inside of the three volumes of Tess of the d’Urbervilles, and find that they are first edition.
“Hmm.” He tries to get up but I hold him down and shush him. “Harry? What’s… healer Bell?” He starts breathing hard and I shush him more.
“Sit,” he commands, pointing to the plush sofa, and I do as I’m told. He sits down beside me but doesn’t touch me.
He blows gently up my length. Oh, shit….
“Goodbye crookshanks, be good for Harry.” She kisses him on the head and he purrs, then she walks over and holds him out to me. I look at him and he seems to be daring me to touch him, the big ginger hairball of evil he is. I reach out and he pounces on me. He digs his claws into my arm and makes his way to my shoulder where he sits and makes no move to get down. He then licks the side of my face with his razor blade feeling tongue. Hermione awwws at it and scratches behind his ear to which he purrs, then she ruffles my hair.
The waiter arrives with our first course. How can I possibly eat? Bloody Merlin - he’s ordered oysters on a bed of ice.
“Sorry Harry, I hope this is okay. He didn’t want to miss Nia’s birthday.” Andy says while being dragged towards us by a blue haired Teddy.
2   The fundamental purpose of this contract is to allow the Submissive to explore his sensuality and his limits safely, with due respect and regard for his needs, his limits, and his well-being.
“Don't worry.” he breathes, his eyes on mine. “ You'll stretch, just relax.” He leans down, his hands on either side of my head, so he’s hovering over me, staring down into my eyes, his jaw clenched, eyes burning. It’s only now that I register that he’s still wearing his shirt.
That just makes me groan and hide my face again. It must be crimson by now. Trust me, I won’t be forgetting it either. I feel like he’s laughing at me and my anger flares. I am not the bad guy here.
“Yes, yes. I've not forgotten, we’ll be there. Bye!” I shouted back while smiling like a loon. Ron had said they had something to announce and that they wanted everyone there for it. I’ve been wondering what big news could prompt a get together. They were either engaged, pregnant, or moving. Or possibly all three but I doubt it. In fact I doubt its pregnancy either as it's being held in a pub. I bet they got engaged, which makes me a little jealous but me and Draco had spoken about it a few months ago and just weren’t ready for that yet. But maybe with the house it will be approaching. Anyway I'll be happy for Ron and Hermione whatever their news is, they seem extra snuggly lately whatever it is. If it makes them happy then I’m happy.
He smiles, his black eyes warm, glowing, and he climbs into the floo and shouts his address. I wave him off, and I wander listlessly into my room.
“I’m just wearing my jeans and a hoodie. Yeah you look nice in that, wear that.” At that he pauses and frowns at me.
“Let me go first Harry. I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have acted like that. Hermione said that you were going to tell me that night and just hadn’t had a chance before Luna blurted it out. I was just a little hurt that she had known and Ginny and Hermione but you hadn’t told me.” He looks down at his hands.
