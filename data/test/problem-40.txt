“I find myself feeling quite fatigued. Can someone see me home please?” Pansy asked quietly.
Both men appeared in the front yard of the cottage Ron and his wife had bought just last year. Hermione met Ron at the door with a kiss before noticing that Harry was even there. In fact, Harry had to clear his throat a few times before either of his friends broke off their liplock.
The children looked on in wonder while munching on their cereal.
The group agreed that since the book was his discovery, Draco should have the honor so the young blond turned to the index and quickly found the page he had been hoping for. "Horcruxes. Page two hundred and ninety three." Draco found himself breathless but quickly turned to the correct page. "It's a whole chapter!"
“Well?” Blaise panted with impatience. It wasn't like Draco to keep secrets from him.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Mr. Malfoy.” Robards had come up behind the elder Malfoy while they were yelling at each other. “Anyone can fall for an act like that. None of you may want to hear it said this way, but Draco was a victim.”
"Agreed." Tom replied. "Sirius, one of us will be in touch if you can help with anything, but for now, I think our business is finished."
Harry nodded and allowed a small smile to form as the boat finally began to slow. It blossomed as the vessel sailed through the illusion of the cliffs without a hitch. Walls of stone were on either side of them for several long moments until they suddenly burst forth into a large hidden cove. “That’s what I was hoping to find, Dudley.” He pointed to the island that dominated the space.
Blaise had evidently heard him because when Harry glanced backward, he nodded.
"Alright." Ron sighed as he took Harry's hand. "Maybe tone it down a bit?"
“Draco, we don’t want to think bad things of him.” Luna sighed. “We don’t even want to think them of Dumbledore. We just don’t know anything for certain and we’re speculating.”
"The round tables at the entrance to the room are reserved for the newly married couples. All students aged fifteen and under will remain at their house tables. Is that clear?" She decreed. "The faculty has decided that this is the easiest way to comfortably integrate mixed House couples."
His other hand joined the first to help him balance but Draco was panting as he lifted his hips this time. As soon as he felt nearly empty, Draco moaned and fell back down – impaled once again. Lifting himself quickly, he soon found a steady rhythm but not fast enough for his impatient husband. Lost in the sensation of Harry’s cock sliding in and out of his slippery hole, Draco barely noticed the sudden change in position as Harry rolled them over. “Touch me, Harry, please?” He whimpered and gasped for air as Harry pounded into his prostate. “Please, Harry… Need to come – please let me!”
Dinki appeared and faced the blond.
Tom looked between them. “Trouble in paradise?”
“Yes, and Zinnia will be her middle name,” the brunette nodded, happily explaining that Neville had told him the meaning of the zinnia flower. “We weren’t thinking of it at the time but it’s really perfect! You see, zinnias bloom in mid-summer and that’s when the babies will be born. Nev says that the flower itself is symbolic of lasting love, thoughts of absent friends, and daily remembrance of good memories.”
He asked Kreacher to get a pot of tea for their guest but was told that Draco had already fallen asleep so Harry quietly looked in on him. Satisfied that Draco was safe and calm he went to sleep in his own bed which was just across the hall.
Draco peeked back out the door and Harry could see that he was undressed. “Why not? You’re not the one who’s not allowed to wank…”
“Alright.” Harry smirked. “I’ll take you there tomorrow night.”
Tea arrived and Ziva was serving. "Ziva has added a plate of the chocolate biscuits Mister Moony enjoys."
When Harry indicated that he was finished with the blond, Draco’s wife placed clothing on the bed next to her husband and told him to dress, “It’s time to return to the Manor, Draco. We’ve much to do to prepare for Harry’s arrival.”
Draco blushed and ducked his head, knowing that means they all saw them holding hands. "Of course."
A quick examination of Draco had the girl sending off a quick spell and soon the Healer was hurrying in.
“Does this mean she’ll be spoiled beyond reason?” Harry asked as Molly held her arms out for the baby.
10- drunken confession
Harry watched Draco’s face for signs of discomfort as he moved his finger in and out a few times before adding a second finger.
“Secure. Just like he said they’d be.” Blaise returned to his friend’s side.
Draco nodded and thrust backwards to feel Harry inside him.
“What seems to be the problem?” Draco asked, in character.
"Yes." Harry paused. "With Pansy Parkinson."
“Yes, Master Harry Potter, sir?” The elf asked once he’d arrived and bowed low.
Teddy glared at his cousin’s friend. He hated being called kid or any of its variations. “Fine.” He growled in annoyance and once again told the story.
The only reason Draco knew this was because he didn’t have his doting husband in bed next to him and he heard the water running in the bathroom. After a second, slightly stronger and longer lasting pain, he shouted for his husband again.
Harry sighed. “I refuse to judge you for doing what you feel is right for yourself and your child. I can offer you support and I can offer you sanctuary but I can’t live your life for you. My floo is always open to you.”
Harry hurried off to get the tools.
Harry nodded solemnly as Draco opened the door to lead the way.
Harry nodded and followed as his uncle turned toward the door. "I think I'll need either several trunks or one with lots of compartments. And Dudley should have his own trunk."
“Ok. I promise!”
A light touch to each of Draco’s nipples had the blond moaning softly. “The wards, Harry! I didn’t have time to lock and silence the room!”
Harry chuckled. "The word is squib, Dudley. You're a squib."
“That was beautiful...” Draco whispered even as he reached for his wand. “
"Not exactly." Harry looked around and sighed. "Is there a spell that will make it difficult to overhear us? I think it best to keep this from Dumbledore...not to mention the general public."
“Yes. The abstract idea of a beast should’ve been enough to send the students home.” Harry quietly agreed. “If I’d had control of my lordship at the time I would’ve insisted. On the other hand, nobody knew what the monster was and hunting it under such conditions would’ve been difficult and dangerous for anyone who undertook such a task as that.”
Harry’s brow furrowed. “Really? I don’t know how that happened.”
He could hardly believe the words on the page.
Fred popped up next to Harry. “All aboard?”
“Our children are brilliant, Harry.” Draco murmured staring at them. “So Altaira went flying, did she? And then she came back with three friends?”
Harry nodded solemnly and stroked his back to calm the other man. "Ready when you are."
“I’m in the living room, Dray, and I’m not alone!” Blaise winked suggestively at Teddy causing the nineteen year old to roll his eyes. Blaise loved to misdirect people in the strangest ways.
Harry shook his head.
"Hi; how have you and Teddy been?" Harry asked softly as he touched the sleeping baby's hand.
Ernie bit his lip nervously. “Really?”
“Draco…Vait until ve are in the air to release the snitch, please.” Viktor’s eyes focused intently on the blond.
"Nev? Ron? Forge?" Harry called as he placed the dagger on the bed next to him. "I think I found something!"
“Mr. Malfoy, your baby is in perfect health. The outer wall of the fabricated uterus is bruised and you will likely feel sore for a few days but there is no damage to the child.” She told him with a gentle smile.
Draco nodded with pride. “It was very colorful.”
“You really fancy...” Ron’s brow furrowed with confusion. "Malfoy?"
Mac shook Harry's hand and urged him over the gangplank. "Now's the day. Now's the hour."
*******************************************************************************************************
Harry nodded.
She stared at him. “Lucius would’ve dragged him to the table and told him to stop being a brat.”
"Well, the potion only needs a couple minor ingredients and Fred can brew it tonight." Ginny whispered. "When can you get into the Hufflepuff common room?"
"Go on, Draco. Tell us more about how Harry is with you." Narcissa prodded.
Draco gasped, remembering now the rule that said he was in charge of placing wards on any room where he and Harry became intimate. “How will you punish me?”
Narcissa eyed her son-in-law. “Indeed, he never was told of it…though, admittedly…he never did ask if we had another residence besides the Manor.”
Previously:
"Yes, Harry... yes!" He cried out as he obeyed.
The elder Malfoys summoned armchairs from the sitting area and set themselves up next to their son.
“That’s ingenious, Harry.” Andromeda grinned. “If you need help with your studies just let me know. I’m an eagle owl.”
“You’re very welcome, Cissy,” was Andromeda’s soft answer.
“The chocolate cauldrons with Firewhiskey are so good!” Harry went on, obliviously. “But I think my absolute favorite sweet is chocolate frogs. They were also my first magical sweet ever.”
She nodded silently as Draco went into the bathroom.
“I think you should take her to Madam Pomphrey.” He said quietly while Draco and some of the others tried to calm her down. “There are only a few things that tend to make people overreact this way…”
"Yes. Then my friends weren't contacting me and my letters to them were coming back unopened... the newspaper wasn't even coming and there was no logical reason for it.” Harry explained. “So I began watching the skies... and the trees. Owls were coming but they weren't getting close enough to deliver anything to me. Hedwig wasn't restricted but she also wasn't bringing me mail and I wanted to know why."
“Looks like a hand.” Ron observed with a frown.
The next few hours were filled with animal noises from Teddy’s toy as well as other toys and the twins.
"WHAT did you DO to him?" Vernon snarled at Harry.
Harry teared up. “I don’t know what to say, Draco. This is a wonderful surprise!”
Draco’s lips parted as Harry ran his fingers through the blond strands of his hair. He used every part of his mouth to arouse his husband.
Draco tore his lips from her breast and trailed kisses down her belly to her bush. Without waiting for Harry to instruct him, he bent to lick the wet flesh of his wife’s pussy. He wasn’t fond of this act, but she’d had him perform it quite often since they’d gotten married and he knew what she liked. Harry knew he wasn’t allowed or welcome to touch her so he watched from a distance and had Draco do several things Draco wouldn’t have thought Astoria would like.
Draco could only moan his acceptance as he got to all fours to grant Harry access. He felt his lover’s fingers enter him and stretch his hole. He moaned and began to rock in place – effectively fucking himself on Harry’s fingers. Panting, Draco began to plead with Harry to fuck him properly.
"I understand." Harry nodded earnestly. "I have six cousins currently attending Hogwarts. I'll ask them when we meet for tea this afternoon and let you know."
“Seeing as I approve the design and intentions behind the rings, I can cover it if you’ve gone over your balance, Potter.” Lucius smirked.
The elves began to look at each other with a mixture of confusion and disbelief.
"Yes, what sex is our Savior's child?"
"The diary held my thoughts and feelings... I  wasn't able to express them, after all. After a failed attempt at making a horcrux out of something that wasn't important to me, he suggested that." Tom pursed his lips. "It worked, but only after Myrtle died. I assume it was a dark horcrux."
The blond wasn’t far behind but he was a little off balance with Lyra in his arms, so Harry had to catch him. He didn’t say anything but, with the sparkle in his grey eyes, Harry could almost hear Draco joking about his hero complex. That being the case, the brunette wasn’t terribly shocked to feel the soft pressure of Draco’s lips on his cheek a moment later.
"No problem at all, sir. There's a spelled panel we can apply with a corresponding ring that would serve as a key." Garnett explained.
Draco smiled and shook his head. "No."
“You didn’t, Father, but I had assumed nothing less of course.” Draco frowned and turned the page. “Here’s Ron and Hermione, Harry.”
Harry hid a grin. “That’s a good idea. I’ll think about it some more too.”
Harry grinned and pulled his gloves on. “I like the sound of that.”
Suddenly, Draco cried out covering their stomachs with cords of creamy white come. “Yours…” He murmured tiredly going lax in Harry’s arms.
Harry stared at his new boat. “Do you think we’ll all fit?”
Harry backed up quickly pressing against the wall as Hufflepuff's head of house made her way to her student's side. Unexpectedly, his hand went past the tapestries to the wall itself. He waited for the ghost and the professor to leave the room before investigating.
The table and other countertops were next to receive a coating of the Impervious Potion as Harry had deemed it. The ceiling was after that and then the door that led into the room. After they’d finished with the room itself, Potions Master Loveday produced Draco’s new robe and used a wooden spoon to help submerge it. “This is your apprentice robe, Draco. You should wear it for all of our lessons. When you reach the Master level you’ll get a new one and I’ll supervise as you personally brew this potion and soak the robe in it.”
“No. Merlin’s blood only joined with that of the founders' when my Uncle Xeno married Persephone Lovegood. Our family keeps very good records of such things. Perhaps Merlin foresaw his line joining with that of the founders.” Draco said, reminding them all that Merlin had been a seer.
Harry Potter was fast asleep on Draco’s chest.
Harry frowned. “That’s horrible!”
Lucius stared at the teenagers. They figured out the prophecy before the adult witches and wizards who were supposed to be experts in their fields. “So, Lord Potter, you said you know what the puzzle pieces are?”
“You are ‘in charge’ of your current decisions, Draconis, not the entire Malfoy family and estate.” Lucius snarled at his son.
"Oh?" Draco's eyebrow rose.
Had they been fully laid...or had they been laid to waste?
The birth hadn’t taken long at all and, just a few hours after Audra had been born, Jackson was taken home by family members. Susan and Chris had stayed for almost a week to recover and get used to the new baby. Now they were on their way home to join their son.
The twins instantly looked interested but Ron's eyes hardened. "My family is not a charity case, Harry!"
Dean and Ginny Thomas                     November 1998 - August 15 1999   - Twins    - Lucas Arthur and Lance Aldwyn
Harry just smirked and turned to look for the snitch.  Not finding it, Harry decided to make a lazy circle before any further decisions. Seeing a glint of light, Harry’s eyes focused on it, but it ended up only being Teddy looking at his watch. His godson was more of a chaser than a seeker so he was really only here to keep them honest. He was now waving at them so Harry signaled the blond.
Harry had escorted Draco to his last test that morning, and now he was sitting on the balcony that connected their bedroom with the nursery. Harry liked this spot because he could have a quiet cup of tea and yet still hear the twins without the alert spell if they fussed. He and Dinki had everything under control and, as soon as Draco returned with his grades, Harry would do all he could to reward his amazing husband.
Ron and Hermione Weasley                November 1998 – August 20 1999                             - Angelica Rose
“I see...but that makes it so difficult to make friends, find love and so on...doesn’t it?” Harry asked.
"Then..." Draco sighed dramatically, "I suppose I'll just have to get used to the company of Gryffindors at the dinner table."
Harry sighed sadly. “Did you check out their house? Attempt to owl?”
"Why...is Potter at our table?" Severus asked with a pained sigh.
"What? Why?" Harry objected to putting his cousins in Dumbledore's reach.
"What did you speak about yesterday, Harry?" Ron asked raising an eyebrow.
Draco sensed that the other man was being soft with him. “Harry...” He got undressed and then walked to his husband’s side. “You’re the one with the control. I like to be told what to do...submissive, remember...”
The light clicked on in Ernie’s mind as he met Harry’s gaze in shock.
“None of this was your fault, Harry.” Hermione broke in. “You do know that, don’t you?”
The door opened to reveal Percy Weasley who invited them in. "Lord Malfoy, young Malfoy... do come in. Luna has gate crashed your meeting and Lord Potter is speaking with her now but he has directed me to send you in upon your arrival."
“I still can’t believe my son has red hair!” Draco chuckled as his lips brushed Caelum’s temple.
Draco’s eyebrow rose. “Us getting together, you mean?”
The next morning, Harry was already outside the great hall when Draco and his friends arrived. The other Gryffindors were suspiciously absent as the young lord stepped forward to greet his boyfriend. “The terms of the bet stated that you would have dinner at the Gryffindor table...but I was wondering if I could join you at Slytherin for breakfast.”
He cringed and told them about the train incident. “So, I owled Draco and kept Harry company. Then Draco showed up at the lawyer’s office and...”
Fred immediately copied his brother's antics by kneeling at Sirius' feet. "We're so honored that you've revealed your secret identities to us!"
2nd Pregnancy (11 months later)           September 2000 – May 2001                                     - Edgar Fabian
He sighed in resignation. He seemed to have two options. He could wear the frilly g-string in the pouch and send Harry home without the wonderful snogging session that almost always led to sex or let Harry discover his deviant side.
“Yes...something about your grandmother.” Harry swallowed uneasily but nodded. “I’m really sorry, Teddy. Your grandma has gone to heaven to be with your mum and dad and grandpa.”
“Indeed; hello, young man.” She said to the blonde.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco cautiously mounted his broom and took off. The baby was buckled in tightly and he felt secure in his skill so he took them to fifty feet. Lyra giggled and chanted his name as he took them in a large circle. After a moment he guided the broom into some bouncing maneuvers before going back down to fifty feet. The girl’s face was alight with excitement as Draco pointed down at the party and encouraged her to ‘wave to Papa and Caelum’. He grinned as he did the same before giving his daughter a swoop on their way to land.
Marcus frowned in the direction Pansy had run off to see only Harry returning with Tanis and a sheet of parchment.
Biting his lip, Draco sighed. “I suppose you’re right. We’d be awfully distracted if the babies were here…I just feel guilty for letting my parents do so much for us.”
"You're coming with me. I don't think you'll be safe wandering the alley and if we get separated you can get in real trouble." Harry told the other boy.
Over and over he told of his beloved family members or friends and the ways he could’ve saved them if he’d only been there or knew something he hadn’t known. If only Cedric had obeyed Harry rather than question him when he’d said they needed to get back to the Tri-Wizard Cup, Pettigrew might not have gotten a good enough aim. If only Harry had procured some antivenin and gotten to the boat house sooner, Snape might’ve lived! If only Dumbledore had not cast Petrificus on him, he could’ve fought in the older man’s place!
Harry pushed forward until he felt Draco’s cheeks against his balls. “You’re so hot! So tight!”
The next lesson was less than a week later as Draco had finished his assignment and owled his instructor.
“And so I passed into the next grand adventure…as your Headmaster said.” Altaira sighed. “Thank the Goddess my husband’s family did not suffer a brush with it and young Gregory’s wife did not share my fate.”
A soft voice spoke up behind the young blond. "You know, Dragon; you had trouble speaking certain letters and sounds as well. Your children are lucky though; they'll only have to learn Dada and Papa. It took months for you to learn 'Mama'."
Harry nodded back. “I’ve got to get back... but I’ll be there on Saturday. I promise.”
“What?” Ron turned to him, wide-eyed.
“Let’s go to my place. I’ll make tea and we’ll talk.” Harry bit his lip. He wanted Draco to say yes...or did he? He wanted the man but was this only happening because of the dangerous situation Harry had put them in? Was he just rebounding from Ginny? Either way wouldn’t be fair to Draco and he didn’t want to lose the friendship he’d worked so hard to build over the last nineteen years.
Severus sighed heavily as every eye turned to him.
Draco sat on the white chaise and waited for Harry to hand him the treat.
A circular impression surrounding three smaller circles. Looking closer, Harry was able to make out a lion's paw print, a badger's claw mark and the talon mark of a bird - probably an eagle.
Draco stared at his husband. “I don’t remember you saying that before.”
"There is no age limit for admission to Zebrawood." Vera explained patiently. "We test all students on their first day to be sure they're able to keep up with their age group in the muggle material. Then we give out the wands and introduce them to certain aspects of the magical courses to see which they have an affinity for."
Percy had his wand trained on the door across from the grouping of furniture and looked like he'd been at it for a while.
Dudley processed this information carefully and nodded.
“Alright.” Harry’s heart sank. He’d really enjoyed the day and the snogging. “I guess I’ll just owl you later.”
Draco whimpered, “Please, Master? Just your finger inside me while she rides my cock is enough but I really want you in me.”
“I’ll bet it was something to do with your hair…wasn’t it, Dragon?” Harry asked to lighten the mood but he gave his mother-in-law a sympathetic look.
“That was worrying.” Draco sighed with relief.
Michelle came rushing in and threw herself at Harry without warning.
Harry's eyes closed of their own volition as he took this in. He took a deep breath and nodded as he opened them. "So you don't want to join me for a trip to Loch Ness?"
“Well, I sort of kissed him back…” Draco bit his lip and waited for their reaction.
Harry smiled as he opened the door Roody pointed out. It was a beautiful sitting room with a cathedral ceiling and a view of the whole cove. The bathroom was located at the base of the gently curved spiral staircase which led to the loft bedroom.
Ron didn't even let them get comfortable before turning to face Harry. "How much did the twins cost you? What exactly are they giving in return?"
“Being so good to Draco...” Narcissa said. “We love him...we do, but I now realize that our love always came with conditions. Yours doesn’t seem to and I’m glad of that.”
Fred took the first guess. "Well, we know Mr. Lupin is a werewolf..."
"Alright...Harry." Draco's heart ached in a good way as he hung up.
"Dobby, can I trust you?" Harry asked softly. "I have a secret...or two."
“It’s only one of the reasons he’s famous, Harry." Remus glanced at Sirius. "He also..."
“I’ll be home by dinner.” Harry didn’t hesitate to take Draco’s hand in his. He kissed his husband’s cheek and then his hand and watched the grey eyes of his lover flick down to focus on the coin he’d slipped into his grasp.
Harry grinned tremulously. “Thank you...”
Hermione took over at that point. “Harry and Draco will be attending all the weddings this month that will take place here at Hogwarts, as well as all of the Weasley weddings. The first couple from Hogwarts to marry will be Emily Hatterfield and Rodney Longfellow.”
"Lord Black, there is a ward on the door leading out of the lobby. Had you any evil intentions, you would have been trapped there." Tukron looked him over with approval. "I am inclined to believe Mr. Lupin and Mr. Potter that your imprisonment was wrongful."
Harry stared at them. “You believe me?”
"Coffee." He said, softly. "Coffee is on my mind."
"No? Not exactly..." Draco sighed. "No... but we walked in on Weasley and Granger in the common room last night... and Pansy and Theo were in here last week and we've only cuddled and kissed with a bit of heavy petting. I feel like I'm not keeping up."
"I get one of my own elves as well as a school elf." Harry eyed him as Dobby reappeared with the tea. "There's room here for all of you to live with me if you'd like, and if at least three of you do move in, we get a second school elf. There's a private owlry and the fireplace can send and receive floo-calls."
Harry took a step outside the room and closed the door. “Thank you all so much for joining us again. Draco’s just taken a potion for the pain and he’s not yet awakened from it.”
Draco frowned. “Letter from the Ministry?”
“You’ve always looked amazing in formalwear, Draco...” Harry looked him over even as he felt the other man’s grey eyes caress his own body. “Am I the last to arrive?”
Draco didn’t say another word until they’d finished eating. “I’ll think about what you’ve said, Harry. I promise...”
Harry smiled relishing in this simple contact. "I'm ok, Padfoot."
"Oh, Harry...you poor dear." Molly tsked at him as she walked over to the door and called Katie to get the tray. Penny picked up her wand and cast a hover charm while Katie hurried to steer it toward the table near the nappers. When she was sure her daughters-in-law had everything under control, Molly turned back to Harry.
The first thing they saw was a beautiful piano situated under a grand staircase that led to a hallway which overlooked the entry. Overhead was a wrought iron chandelier. Surrounding the piano and staircase was a semicircle of windows showing a courtyard that contained a flower garden and small waterfall. To either side there was a sitting room with couches and armchairs in small groupings.
"Me and all my cousins." Harry's eyes became haunted. "I can't tell them what I need to if I'm afraid someone will read their minds."
Harry’s lips curved slightly. “You really want me with you?”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said, taking a deep breath. “I’m suddenly getting nervous about this.”
Selene growled and took off into the marsh.
“Me too…” Harry replied softly as he retook his seat beside Draco.
"Draco, you coming?" Blaise asked softly from behind them.
"Luna, why'd you say that about the suffering and the one versus the many?" Harry asked gently. "Is it something you've
Harry looked at Remus, who nodded and subtly signaled Sirius and the others. The old man led them to one of the small towers and showed Harry the lock on the thick wooden door.
“Draco Malfoy-Potter! You wear make-up?” Harry was astounded.
"What do you mean?" Sirius asked, frowning.
They all grinned in agreement.
"Yes, my office is this way." Harry tilted his head to indicate the direction they'd travel.
"Yes. I want to see if they have a similar story to Roody." Harry said carefully. "If they work at Hogwarts during the school year I might be able to begin bonding with them."
“The letter to Kingsley?” Draco asked knowingly.
“We would’ve been separated.” Draco whispered finally realizing the danger he’d been put in by his so-called ‘friend’. He clutched Harry’s hand in one of his and placed the other on his belly. “And they would’ve put us through investigations and examinations! Our children could’ve been endangered by all the stress.”
The goblin watched until they left.
"You never told me about that one." Ginny said softly as she and Luna came in.
"Yes, Master Harry, sir!" Dobby saluted him and popped away.
“Yes, Harry,” Draco took another deep breath. “She’s been my family’s Healer for ages, though not long enough to have been here for my birth.”
Harry had to think for a moment before the meaning of the large word popped into his head. “What should I do? Does he need a healer?”
"Got it." Dudley grinned and hurried off.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat as he got impossibly more aroused. “Harry...?”
“Are you the Dominant or submissive spouse, Harry?”
There was silence for a moment before Severus Snape stepped into the painting of a large comfy armchair and sat down. “May I help you?”
Draco blushed and ducked his head as he felt a spell being lifted. “He must’ve seen you giving me improper attention and cast a notice-me-not charm for us.”
"Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you all that the list of banned items remains posted on the door to his office." Dumbledore told the crowd. "Also, please note that the forest is forbidden to all students and I know that we're all hungry, so that will be my last announcement." With that, he signaled the kitchen and the meal was served.
“I hope it doesn’t...” Draco’s voice broke as he looked back at his food. He lifted his fork and stabbed a tomato. “I hope you knowing about this doesn’t affect our friendship.”
“Well, I hope that can wait for the morning because I’m tired.” Draco said standing up.
“Yes, but I always thought that was quite strange,” Draco commented nervously as his wife took a seat on the sofa letting Harry dominate the conversation as well as him. “Anyway, this is the sitting room which leads to the balcony. You can see the whole garden from this spot.”
“I’m glad you like it, Dray; it’s all I have at the moment. Now I want you to be totally honest with me.” Harry smirked and lifted the blond’s leg to access his most private area. He tapped Draco’s puckered entry which spasmed, making Draco shiver. “When you wanked did you ever touch yourself here?”
"All of the core classes will, Lord Potter." She answered with her usual aplomb. "As will several of the electives."
For the rest of the day, Harry wondered why his thoughts drifted back to Draco Malfoy, but when he woke up in the early hours of the next morning after dreaming of different ways he would mess up the perfect blonde hair on Malfoy's head, he knew. He was going to try and get Draco Malfoy to date him.
"We thought it best not to let too much time go by or they might not realize why it was happening." Ginny smirked. "What kept you?"
Harry read each line carefully a second time to fully understand the ministry’s new law.
“Good, now I’m going to amend the first rule: you’re not to wear clothes unless certain conditions are in play. Number one…you are going out into the public areas of the estate or leaving the estate altogether.” Harry decreed, “Number two… your mother is visiting the suite for some reason. Number three…I give you something to wear. Am I understood?”
Dinki suddenly popped in with a bowl of apple sauce and placed it in front of Draco who sighed softly as he scooped some up and placed it in his mouth with a moan.
******** ******** Chapter 5 ******** ********
/*/*/*/*/*
Harry looked up where his son was pointing and grinned as their lovely barn owl – whom they’d named Altaira, after Draco’s aunt – took off from the attic window. “That’s our owl, Caelum. Owl…”  He sounded the word out for the children as the bird got higher into the sky.
Andromeda smiled softly. “What was your father’s form, Harry?”
Harry's eyes snapped to Tom's face. "You already knew about releasing horcruxes ...didn't you, Tom? That's what you needed the spikes for."
“Yes, Pansy; Teddy is a metamorphmagus. He gets it from his mother’s side of the family,” Harry interrupted.
Harry nodded back with a grin. He was so glad things were working out this way. He felt that Draco truly loved and understood him and Harry was making the effort to reciprocate. Together they could make a brilliant life and it was already happening…now if they could find a way to get the ministry to lay off of their fellow citizens!
"That's not what I think at all,” Harry gritted his teeth. “but speaking of chess, Ron; you're good at strategy. Think strategically from my position. What would be your first move?"
“Never have I ever wanted to kiss someone in this room...” Harry drank before Draco could protest that it wasn’t his turn. As soon as he’d swallowed it he leaned over and pressed his lips to Draco’s.
“Teddy, do come join us.” Andromeda was also grinning as she patted the settee next to her. “What’s new, Darling?”
“It’s a dildo that is magically molded to look like my cock. This will let me play with you without expending my energy before I really want to.” The brunette didn’t wait, but pressed the head of the dildo into Draco’s barely prepared hole.
“Nothing my parents had to say changed my mind about marrying Harry, Blaise.” Draco frowned. “Harry’s and my marriage has nothing to do with anything. Neither of us hates the other. Harry is sweet and kind and gentle with me.”
That had only been moments ago and he was now hearing a soft knock on the door. He laid his daughter down into her bassinet making sure the swaddling clothes hadn’t come unraveled before quietly opening the door.
He was a lot calmer with his arm around his husband. They entered the apartment and Kreacher greeted them with dinner on the table.
"I have no objection, Professor." Malfoy said, standing up.
Draco nodded and just commented that he needed his cloak.
"If he has, he didn't ask." Draco smirked. "I think he's afraid to think in that direction because then our mutual cousin is a much more powerful witch than he thought."
/*/*/*/*/*
Harry shook his head. "Afraid not. I knew it was him as soon I saw his hair."
Your original form has been reviewed and your name has been placed upon the appropriate list. You have been categorized as a submissive male seeking Dominant male partner. As such, you became a candidate for the role of our Savior's life partner and Mr. Harry James Potter has indeed chosen you to have the once in a lifetime honor of becoming his husband. You have only to check the box next to yes or no and sign your full name to accept or deny his offer.
“I’ll start by touching them…maybe I’ll lick them…Maybe I’ll beat them!” Harry smiled at the idea. “Yes! They’ll already be completely hairless, so at some point, I’ll bind Draco so his balls are perfectly visible and beat them until he begs for me to stop. I have many instruments and toys to keep us amused.”
Draco sighed the next day. He'd met Pansy for coffee and ended up having lunch too. "I hope this year's Christmas tree is nice. Last year the one he picked was skinny and sparse."
Narcissa graciously allowed her sister to avoid the subject for the moment but the moment she got her alone they would have words. Andromeda should’ve spoken to her – should’ve asked for her company when she attended the healer appointments at Saint Mungo’s. Andromeda should’ve been getting the best care from the Malfoys’ private Healer if the ones at the hospital weren’t good enough. She’d argue with her sister later, though. As she’d said – it was Christmas.
"How?" Zack asked, without hesitation.
Draco nodded agreeably. "I'll just see my father out, then, shall I?"
"Good morning, Harry," Minerva McGonagall greeted him.
“I forgave you as soon as you’d been properly punished, Dragon.” Harry hugged the blond tighter. “That’s how punishments work. If you do something wrong, you get punished and then it’s over. The slate is wiped clean and I won’t punish you for it again unless it happens again.”
“Well, for one, I think we’re well matched in academics. When you’re mentioned in conversation, it sounds as if we’d get along pretty well personality-wise. I figure that in combination with you’re being in the house that values hard work means that neither of us is likely to abandon the other to do all the work on the project.” Harry told her honestly. “You also have a relative on the wizengamut and will probably be understanding if I’m late for a meet-up?”
Harry grinned and took the ball of string back to unravel a bit more. He swung the string up into the air and watched Draco bat at it. After a few moments, Harry was bored with this game so he gave Draco a new order. “I want my kitten to be my pleasure slave. Come here and lick my toes.”
"Luna remembered lending the cloak but forgot the kit was in the pocket. The elf who gathered her things was approached while doing so." Harry nodded sadly. "She's a muggle-born and her parents hadn't gotten her a cloak. Luna lent the little one hers and was going to ask her father to send an old one to give permanently."
Harry nodded once and followed his estate manager into the other room where he was surprised to see three familiar faces beyond the Weasley family whom he'd been expecting. Luna Lovegood stood between her father and Ginny. Zacharias Smith stood beside an older man who could only be his father because they looked so much alike.
“If we feel differently about each other will you be ok?” Harry asked.
Harry looked at Remus and then back to Sirius. "Whose was it then?"
Draco glanced the same way and blushed as he squeezed Harry’s hand.
"I think I thought the passion was there but it wasn't. You know what I mean?" Draco asked softly. "I used to have more passionate arguments and fistfights with Potter than I've been having love affairs with these guys...longer ones too."
"Molly has already gone to floo the healer, son." Arthur said sadly.
“I’ve been punished before, Harry…it never felt that way.” Draco shook his head sadly and tugged Harry down to sit with him on the bench. “I accept that I need to be punished sometimes. I accept that you will be the one to punish me – as my Dominant husband…but please, Harry – allow me some input as to what I can and cannot take.”
Harry pushed the door wider, “How nice of you to state the obvious, Draco. Show me around my rooms.”
“I want you to use the toilet and then we’ll talk and get you dressed.” Harry instructed the four year old who hurried off to obey. Upon seeing Teddy walking back into the room, Harry rattled off the usual questions. “Did you make a mess?”
Luncheon was next on the schedule and – although it was served in the formal dining room – it ended up being a simple buffet with snack-type items to munch on informally. Harry and Draco sat at one end of the table with a small plate of vegetables and chocolate milk while the others were scattered through the room.
She nodded and pointed toward the sofa in the corner. “You might be comfortable over there.”
The twins got sidetracked by seeing Draco so Harry didn’t feel bad for greeting his godson first.
On his way to the floo, Harry visited the other rooms where he recalled Andromeda’s presence but he was much calmer this time. His last stop was the library, where he quietly but with much care looked over the family tapestry. A few hours later, when Harry felt ready to return home, he used the coin to tell Draco that he was finished in London and then took some powder from Dooley to go home feeling much better than when he left.
/*/*/*/*/*
Sirius was glancing between them trying to figure out what was going on. “Can we start with the word itself so everyone knows what we’re discussing?”
Harry nodded. “Luna.”
Draco was itching to hold his daughter and began fidgeting until the healer finally set the tiny pink and silver wrapped bundle in his arms. “Have you told them yet, Harry?”
Draco gasped theatrically. “You learned those? Do you know who Altaira is?”
Your parents have been informed of this also but, since you are seventeen, the decision is left to you. Please fill out the form at the bottom of the page and we will place you on a list of available young men to be matched with partners. You will be informed of your spouse’s name and other vital information as soon as it is available. You are allowed one veto. The second assignment of partner will be automatically accepted for you.
Zack accepted this and hurried away. Ginny followed suit and the others just enjoyed what was left of the tea as Harry wrote a note to his head of house. He informed her of which cousins were moving in and requested Roody as the secondary school elf citing Luna's familiarity with him.
Harry steadied himself to hear the rest.
“Two?” Harry frowned but then it clicked. “Oh, the Crouch elf is there too? I see...Roody, if I asked, could you bring someone here?”
Draco smiled back. “Really?”
"The stone fragment I placed into the Hogwarts coat of arms was made of the colors of the houses." Harry said as he watched his godfather's movements.
"I asked my elves to make Italian. I hope you don't mind." Harry mentioned casually.
Harry asked Ziva for a second chair and as soon as they were both seated, he looked his cousin in the eye. "I have class in fifteen minutes, so give me the bottom line. What do you need to do your job?"
“Would that even be legal?” Harry scoffed. “How would they be able to enforce it?”
Harry felt a shiver travel up his spine.
His friends just laughed and dragged him back to the table. When they got there, the music was slowing down.
“P-Potter! Harry Potter!” Draco gasped as Harry’s thumb grazed the tip of his cock.
“Sirius Black? My mother’s cousin was your godfather? I can’t believe I never knew that!” Draco was shocked.
“You are beautiful…” Harry told him softly. “Have I told you that today?”
“Hey! Its okay, Dragon, it’s all going to be okay…” Harry laid his cheek against the top of Draco’s head. “Listen to me, baby…I love you! We’re a family and I’m not going anywhere without you and Lyra and Caelum.”
“You know...don’t you?” Draco asked so quietly that Harry wasn’t sure he’d even really spoken.
The next morning Harry woke to the feel of feather-light kisses on his chest. He smiled sleepily at his husband before gently urging the pregnant man onto his back to ravish him. “Good morning, Dragon.” He whispered to the blond as he lavished attention upon Draco’s neck and chest.
It read - Headmistress Vera Prewitt.
Remus and Sirius shared a look. "Well, if it's true, those rumors will likely l be brought back up by the end of the summer." Remus began.
"I was fifteen months old." Harry reminded the group. "Albus Dumbledore is a powerful wizard who had access to both me and a Master of potions who has reason to dislike me - and my father before me - after he removed me from my rightful guardian's custody to place me in a home with people who hated me."
Now Draco knew Harry was feeling better. He smiled as Harry’s arms pulled him back against his muscular chest. He loved Harry’s dominant nature and felt himself melting into the other man. “I don’t know…I’m not sure I can muster the strength for that.” He teased.
“Oh...” Molly bit her lip.
“I got George to make it for us especially. It’s a magical chocolate snitch.” Harry explained with a grin. “It’ll fly and we can seek it and, no matter who catches it, it’ll break in half for us to share. It’s charmed to stay intact until someone catches it.”
“But if they’d remained private you wouldn’t be together now!” Teddy stopped. “You weren’t just playing, right? You’re together?”
“She did?” Draco smirked.
Harry said softly.
“Oh dear, I’ve put my foot in it again, haven’t I?” Al asked as Dinki announced that dinner was ready.
Harry came closer to find that the box contained several copies of The Quibbler which featured Harry on the cover and listed his official title.
Severus exited the floo behind him and looked right in the direction of the Dark Lord who had just emerged from the upstairs hallway onto the staircase landing.
Ministry of Magic, Department of Marriage and Families
“Perhaps it bothers us because the…” Lucius cleared his throat. “Voldemort used to speak to Nagini…issuing orders… and commanding…”
Dudley was barely interested in the academic side of things. "When do I get to pick a self defense form?"
“Draco, is there a possibility of creature heritage?” His friend asked quietly.
Chapter 11
“As you wish.” The older man said nothing as he stood and regally began to walk toward the door.
“Dinki,” Draco called.
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
"What suggestion, Mi?" Ron frowned.
"Thank you, Father." Draco smirked at the man who'd sired him.
The pair fell silent as Harry watched Draco kneel in the snow and pull out his wand. The blond wove an intricate pattern and soon a basket appeared before them. Inside the basket was an arrangement of lilies and zinnia along with many different colored roses and narcissus.
Harry looked at the statue of his ancestor and noticed that she was facing west so he turned to face that way too and smiled. Of course it was a bookcase. As he walked over to it, he realized he had drawn an audience so he smiled and nodded a greeting to Cho Chang and her friends but didn't spend much time thinking about them as he was concentrating on figuring out how to open the door.
“I would presume so, Harry.” Draco gave a strained laugh. “Dobby, is it possible for you to take us back to the other side of this wall?”
Draco shuddered in Harry’s tender embrace but remained pliant as Harry took his place between Draco’s pale thighs. He lined his cock up with Draco’s slick and ready hole and proceeded to push inside. Draco gasped at the sudden fullness. “Gods yes! Oh Harry!”
After a silent pause, the reporters began to clamor at them again.
Ron's face turned bright red while Hermione giggled; McGonagall just closed her eyes and shook her head. Kingsley chuckled silently. Narcissa blushed and cleared her throat, but Lucius' expression was beyond description as he choked.
"You remember what we discussed about the dreams, Blaise." Draco looked around the dormitory. With the others gone, he could talk about it so, as a precaution, Draco cast muffliato around their beds. "With my heritage, I could have any number of powers I don't know about yet. Let’s not forget that Potter's mere presence was enough to trigger an early awakening of them. Now that he knows he's the lost son, anything can happen."
Harry smiled as his lips parted to allow entry for Draco’s tiny pink nipple. He suckled as Draco whined under his attention. Taking the ring into his teeth, Harry tugged which put a stop to the whining and made the blond begin to moan instead. He lifted his head and moved over to the other nipple. He kept his hands off of his slave’s body to distract Draco into thinking of what else they could be doing. Suddenly, Harry had a rather evil idea, so he had his quite aroused slave rise up onto his hands and knees while he summoned a toy he’d forgotten to tell the blond about.
Draco sighed and nodded digging into his trunk for parchment and a quill.
Harry merely smirked in return.
Harry grinned at his platinum haired companion and gave a sheepish chuckle. “I suppose that’s true, my dragon.”
Draco nodded and stood up as Harry vanished the cushion. They walked back to their dorm holding hands in silence. Draco tossed and turned as he tried to sleep.
"That's great, Winky! Thank you." Harry smiled at her while slipping it into his pocket. "I'll call for you in London. Once you've finished helping Roody close the property for the school year, I'd like you to do me a favor and check in at Hogwarts with Dobby."
"Christmas." Dudley said with a jerky nod before retreating to the drawing room.
"I've ordered her a new cloak. She's sweet and kind-hearted...if a little kooky." Harry growled and, as he paced, the earth rumbled beneath them. "She doesn't deserve to be treated the way people have been treating her."
This was mildly startling so Draco wrapped his arms around as much of Harry as he could reach. “Harry?”
“Draco, why don’t you go to class and tell Flitwick that Pansy and I will be along shortly while we bring Tanis to his daddy,” Harry said.
"That sounds nice, Harry." Draco nodded as he slipped his hand into Harry's.
Harry smiled. “Good idea. Meet me in there.”
“Well, we can’t just conspire to take him from her, Harry…But we do have extra suites at our estate.” Draco was calm in the face of this worrisome news and it helped Harry come to terms with reality.
"Ziva, call Dudley for a short visit so I can introduce him to Draco properly." Harry said, not looking away from the blond.

"That is Rowena Ravenclaw's son, Warin, and he appears to have wed Helga Hufflepuff's granddaughter, Gunnora - as indicated by this gold line." Korlag stepped up to touch the parchment. Using his finger, he traced the names as he read them. "Their daughter, a witch named Felice, married a muggle and birthed three children - a female squib named Edith and two wizards.  One for each line. Your mother, Lily, was that squib's great granddaughter and she married James Potter. Let's open his now." He motioned for the other goblin to bring the Potter chart. "Now, it is known that James Potter descended from a pureblood line - the Peverell family, I believe. Among that family's descendants, there are several fairly famous ones but the one who stands out is Godric Gryffindor - yes there he is..." Korlag traced a line on the chart. "And he was rumored to have conducted an affair of the heart with Salazar Slytherin's elder daughter, Sabelina. The affair is now confirmed by this red line. They were unwed when the child was born and she apparently allowed Godric to raise him with his wife who was infertile due to a childhood disease."
"Lyra…" Draco whispered. "It's a constellation – the harp."
Sigmund's eyes began to glow as he travelled the path given to him.
Pansy started things off for their not-so-small group of friends. She experienced false labor on the morning after Harry’s party. Marcus saw her to and from St. Mungo’s but little Ambrose remained a resident of his mother’s womb. Pansy and Marcus married on the second to be sure that her son wouldn’t be a law breaker before he was born. Professor McGonagall consented to perform the ceremony as she had with all her other students and staff back in October.
"Yes, sir; I understand that." Harry nodded.
"More interesting things to come in this conversation..." Harry chuckled. "Draco Malfoy stopped in during the train ride. It seems that we've all had the wool pulled over our eyes."
Draco's gaze swept the compartment, taking in the casually entwined hands of the two girls sitting among them. "I can see how that would be a problem and although I'm not in a position to do much about it, I shall address the matter with my father."
"To the point of ancient being an understatement?" George finished with a wide grin.
Harry chuckled. "True."
"Ernie summoned the shoes. The socks were inside them." Zack confessed. "Roger Davies - the Ravenclaw - he took her socks and they decided to hide them around the castle."
Andromeda watched peacefully as Harry allowed it for a moment or two before transforming into himself and tickling the little boy. She was unsurprised when her sister’s husband joined them with the newest Malfoy heir. “Good morning, Lucius.”
"So, you think that because you randomly said you had an office, the magic interpreted it as a need and gave you one...?" Draco looked around. "That's... strangely wicked, Potter."
The waitress brought their meals and Ron eyed the blond but said nothing as he used a fork to cut into the fish. Harry and Draco dug into their own meals as well, letting the matter of the bruises fall to the wayside.
The Healer nodded. “Again – that’s the perfect response. Draco will be sensitive to high temperatures for almost a week. Keep him rested and cool and call if you need me but I’m certain he’s in good hands.”
“I’m so glad you woke me, love,” Harry moaned into the blond’s ear. “The dream I was enjoying was nothing compared to this.” He thrust into Draco again and had them both screaming in ecstasy soon after. Harry cast the cleansing charms minutes later, but just in time as Dinki popped in to make sure her masters were awake.
"Good. Dudley, come on." Harry motioned for his cousin to follow. "We're expected at the Leaky Cauldron, if you please, and if you can keep it quiet that I was traveling...just for a day or two... it would be helpful."
Harry didn’t ask permission as he rolled Draco’s sleeve up and surveyed the damage. That whole portion of skin was black and blue. “Draco, my God! Let me guess: he wouldn’t let you use a healing salve. Was this supposed to teach you a lesson?”
Harry smiled as he saw the owls fly in and swoop around delivering envelopes and packages. He was pleasantly surprised to see Altaira among them. He waited to greet her until she set down on the back of his chair. He stroked her feathers once and then took the envelopes. One was a letter for both himself and Draco from his in-laws. He would read that with his husband in a little while. The other one was from the Ministry. He’d open that one now and show it to Draco later.
Draco winced. "I'm sorry. I just..."
“You and I were always more than a match for each other. Perhaps we should have a game too.” Harry saw a glare appear on Viktor’s face.
Harry shook his head. "No."
“We’re alright,” Harry told them, nudging Draco toward his parents while he shook Arthur’s hand and hugged Molly.
Fred pouted. "Still not sure I believe you."
“Oh! My goodness, no!” The man agreed. “Your refreshments are on the house, Mr. Potter, and my staff will search the premises at once!”
Harry couldn’t help it; he burst out laughing.
Draco kissed her cheek. “We’d best hurry. The healer’s time is valuable.”
Harry laughed. "Ok. Ok. What do you want, then?"
“You lied to me...What else did you do, Draco? What did you say to her in that letter?” Harry frowned.
"The wards are keeping him from hearing me, Father." Draco glanced over at him.
Arthur handed him a sheet of parchment. "These are the hand motions you need to memorize. That's the way you'll tell her what you want. Look there – the man in the distance is her trainer, Jon Turner. He's got a dummy and they want to show you what she can do. Using the hand signals, tell her to disable the bad person."
Ziva opened the door and let them in. "Ziva is so happy to see Master Harry! Did Master enjoy his trip? Please to be telling Ziva all about it?"
“Alright, tell them I’ll be right there.” Harry sighed as he turned to let Goodman in on the news before he turned to fuss with his tie. “I can never do this right. Ask Draco to meet me in the hallway, will you Lucius?”
Draco had made an appointment to take the practical portion of his NEWT tests starting on September second, so Harry decided that they should move into the new house before then. Without telling Draco, he ordered furniture and bedding that was an exact duplicate of the things they’d had in their suite at the Malfoy’s London townhouse. He also chose to order duplicates of the cribs and other baby furniture. Dinki was getting it all set up and all Harry had to do was pack his family’s clothing while Draco was studying for his series of tests.
"No, Harry, dear." Pansy smirked as she glanced up from the book she'd been reading. "That was the informal dining room. The formal dining room is only used on major holidays, weddings, deaths and important milestone birthdays or anniversaries. There's one in every pureblood family Manor and it magically changes décor for the appropriate occasion with just a spell."
"A big part of it is that you were raised in the wizarding world. That means you know loads more about it than I do. Most of my other cousins have this in common with you and while they're..." Harry mused. "Quite unique... you run in different circles."
"It was long ago decreed that the ruler's family need not bow to each other. Bealush is my father - the Emperor's - mother." He smiled at her. "Before joining you, she informed me that my presence was needed because a prophecy of our people had come to pass and the subjects of the prophecy had a child who was here in our establishment. Korlag?"
Harry smiled through his disappointment and nodded. “What about lunch? I can get Kreacher to make you something...”
Roody tensed up until the new elf appeared in their presence.
“I was in Godric’s Hollow seventeen years ago, Potter. The Dark- Voldemort took a few of us with him when he went after you and your parents. I was there when Bellatrix killed Sirius Black and I saw from afar the curse that was thrown at the window where Lupin and his wife stood firing their own hexes.” Lucius paused as Harry’s face settled into a mask of calm sadness at the mention of his departed friends and family. “I and all the other Death Eaters knew we were taking loved ones from you. They didn’t care...I didn’t care at the time and I didn’t understand what else we were taking either...but I do now. We took so much from you, Pot – Harry…and I’m sorry.”
“First of all, there is a child present!” Harry gaped at his companions as he took the tacit invitation to sit on Marcus’s sofa. “And second, what the hell is that supposed to mean?”
“That’s wonderful, Lyra!” Harry’s praise and applause led to a high pitched giggle.
“You may walk to the floo but you must strip and kneel as soon as you reach my home.” Harry commanded.
“Open your mouth, Dragon...” Harry said kneeling next to him.
Glancing quickly around the room, Harry saw most of his friend’s family members – the only exception being the elder Notts. Minister Shacklebolt was there with a few key members of his staff. Headmistress McGonagall was also in attendance, along with Madam Pomphrey and former-Professor Slughorn. Another face popped into Harry’s vision and he made a note to bring Draco in that direction while they mingled later.
“Did you do this when you wanked, Draco?” Harry asked squeezing his husband’s nipple again.
Being that the little ones were all at different stages of development, they played with different toys and got different encouragements from their parents. One thing was certain, though, all the babies were happy and healthy…and that was the best thing they could all hope for.
“Yes, Harry. It is meant to protect items and clothing from any damage – be it graffiti, fire or a simple yellowing of the page.” The older man said.
The glowing eyes didn't falter as he answered.
"Yes. All of that. Your fans are a rowdy lot... Harry." Draco gulped the last of his coffee and chuckled in surprise as someone brought another cup.
"Perhaps the magic was assuming you had siblings." Snape suggested callously.
Harry blushed but otherwise ignored the provocative statement. “Hello, Kingsley; how are you?”
Harry nodded. "Let's do it."
Nagini hissed as she finally joined them, winding around Tom's legs.
Draco kept sighing and was barely meeting Harry's eyes. His answers to Harry's questions were soft spoken and one word instead of the usual open and honest exchanges Harry was used to.
Draco turned when he heard Harry pull out a handkerchief and blow his nose. “Harry? What’s wrong?”
“You, Harry! I’m yours!” Draco cried out. “Merlin! Oh, Merlin! Harder, Harry; please?”
Harry’s tears began again as he helped Draco stand. “Thank you, my love.”
"You barely greeted him, to start with. You wouldn't let him touch the baby. Your answers, when he speaks to you are curt and short – not to mention cold!" Harry glared. "If you're not planning to be civil then why bother coming at all?"
Harry nodded to reassure someone - he wasn't sure if it was Dudley or himself - and then he opened the door leading the way to the brick wall that would allow them passage to Diagon Alley. A glance told him Dudley was not convinced this wasn't a dead end so he smirked as he tapped the bricks in the correct order.
"Well...my word..." Korlag didn't seem to realize that nobody else in the room could read it.
Draco was beyond speech as he felt Harry's hands touching him.
"Are you sure this is a good idea..." Draco hesitated, his voice shaking a bit. "Harry?"
“Knowing we were coming to Loch Ness, I looked up landmarks in the area.” Luna’s soft smile settled Harry’s surprise but she went on. “Mac said Loch Ness was south of Loch Dochfour and I recalled that Aldourie Estate is a castle at the north end of Ness. I have a very good memory.”
“They never did.” She confessed with a glint in her eye. “My brother told me.”
“You can bring dinner now, Dinki,” Draco smiled at the creature. After she popped out, Draco turned to his friend. “If anyone had told me years ago that I’d end up as Harry Potter’s submissive spouse, I would’ve hexed them into St. Mungo’s Janus Thickey ward. But here I am, in love with and submissive to, the Boy-Who-Lived. And the most unbelievable part isn’t that I’m happy…it’s that I chose to be here.”
Harry felt butterflies begin to flutter in his stomach and blushed. “I promise.”
When Pansy and Draco were out of sight, the argument began again.
"I'd like that." Draco smiled. "What should we do on our date?"
"That's fantastic! Thanks!" Harry grinned at his cousin. "Now, these three items are being asked for as part of a betrothal contract with Draco Malfoy. Do you remember them?"
Harry nodded but was interrupted by Ron. “Wait for him out by the gargoyle. He’ll be there in a minute.”
"There's more than one test?" Dudley asked, now worried.
Harry smiled. “I remember you inviting me to stay and get drunk that night! I didn’t think you were serious.”
Before long, he was rushing through the floo again and spinning out into Arthur's office. The tour of the ministry went quickly and with only two small glitches.
“Really?” Draco bit his lip.
Harry smirked. “What ever will we do without the children here?”
"I'll make it up to you later, Dragon." Harry kissed him again, this time also caressing the bulging five month baby-bump. "Nice and slowly…a sweet and careful love making…"
Harry grinned through his tearful outburst. “As soon as I talk Draco into pressing charges. It’s got to be done legally. Ron...we can’t let on that we know. You especially - He doesn’t know that you and Mione know.”
Harry’s eyes darkened as he became even more aroused. He placed his fingers on Draco’s nipple and squeezed lightly.
Harry turned away just as the fire died. He rubbed his eyes and climbed the stairs with Selene on his heels. As soon as the door opened the black dog hurried inside to lie on her bed while Harry took his place beside Draco. Looking at the blond he knew he didn’t like the idea of taking this post. Even the thought of being away from Draco and their children was a painful one and, with Draco due to give birth in under a month, he couldn’t bear to do this favor. He’d speak to Draco and his in-laws at breakfast and then he’d fire-call the Headmistress to give her an answer.
“Especially seeing as my name is no longer just Potter… Draco and I have hyphenated our names, Blaise. We are now both Malfoy-Potters.” Harry nodded as the coin told him the others were on the way. “The others should be here soon.”
Dean looked from the paper to Draco's face and bit his tongue. "Well, do you have a preference?"
Harry jumped, accidentally making his daughter’s highchair wobble. Dinki, who was feeding Harry’s son Caelum, quickly used her magic to steady it again but the damage was done and little Lyra began to cry. As he lifted his daughter into his arms, Harry glared at his friend’s fiery head. “Get one what? What are you talking about?”
“Mmmm, Dragon, you taste so good…”  Harry grinned, coming up for air. “I’ll have to do this more often.”
Draco found peace of mind in Harry's arms and he was able to return the favor. It was his favorite place to be anyway and it was never one sided.
“No. What was it about?” Draco frowned.
"Ritual magic is quite rare and complex. Do you really think that will be necessary?" Zack was understandably surprised. While not unheard of, rituals were only used in special cases.
Ron sighed, shaking his head. "I wish I'd been there."
"What's with the huge sigh of relief, pup?" His godfather asked as he joined Harry in the library.
“So I hope the world remains at peace.” Harry told them with a shrug. “I hope my family – and yes I’m including all of you – stays happy…and healthy…and safe.” Harry glanced at his friends – the ones who were affected by the Ministry’s decrees. “I also hope that the world goes – somewhat – back to normal and allows its young people to make their own decisions regarding marriage and children. We’re twenty years old and we’ve fought a war to stay free from evil. I think we deserve some respect and freedom. Here’s hoping we get some.”
Harry considered this and nodded. “Alright…Place your hands on the back of the couch. I’ll take your trousers down.”
“She sends her regrets. Unfortunately, she had to visit Father.” Draco sighed. “She was contacted by the ministry this morning. He’s ill.”
"It's this!" Harry cried out as he rushed to push the poker into the hole.
"I was going to say... but it couldn't be... could it?" Sirius whispered in awe. "Elemental magic?"
"Yes, sir." Draco pouted. "Sorry, sir."
“Wait! Draco, did Harry give you that rose? Harry, was it a spelled rose? What does it mean?” Rita shouted, following them.
Draco gasped as he obeyed. “Yes – yours, Harry! I’m all yours!”
******** ******** Chapter 36 ******** ********
“It’s a beautiful ring, Draco.” Harry said, looking down at it.
Pansy’s head came up. “What was it?”
Still taking things slowly, he had yet to let Harry into his bed. The pair hugged and kissed regularly they’d even frotted on the couch once but lately he was getting antsy. He didn’t miss Viktor but he did miss sex and masturbation wasn’t cutting it. Even his favorite dildo fell short of his fantasies of Harry making love to him.
“Please, Master? I need to come,” He whispered. “I’ll do anything.”
"Harry, you and Draco may take Teddy for a little while." Andromeda said softly. "Cissy and I have some catching up to do."
Draco restrained his relief, “I’ll continue to accept a spanking if you wish, Harry, but allow me the dignity of choosing the position and counting the strikes myself…please?”
Draco nodded off on a comfy chaise lounge while Harry and Andromeda watched the babies play.
“No.” Blaise shook his head. "We narrowed it down further than that and you know it."
Harry was determined to show Draco just how much his words had meant to him. Since Harry was forbidden to mention it, the brunette did this by cuddling him longer than usual in the mornings and holding the blond’s hand whenever they walked the halls of the townhouse.
“Wow, mate; that makes things way easier. So which is it?” Ron asked.
Draco stared at the wrapped box in Harry’s hand. “What did she say?”
Harry frowned. “Yeah, he’s good at those.”
When they’d finished their morning meal, Harry summoned the small box that contained their brooms. It had been placed lovingly on a shelf in their bedroom until now. It floated down the stairwell and directly into Harry’s hands. As soon as they got outside, the brunette carefully took each broom out and enlarged it. When they were both flight-ready, Harry turned to Draco, “They are supposed to be an even match for each other and we can change their color with spells. Once we take them up, they’re going to be imprinted with our magical signatures, so you take one and I’ll grab the other. They’ll be ours alone after that and an alarm will sound if someone else tries to fly them without our permission. There is also a spell that will allow it to find you and if you fall from it, the broom will follow you to the ground.”
“Will we do that every day?” He asked smirking, though still a bit red in the face. “I loved the feel of having you inside me, Harry...”
Teddy took a deep breath and glanced away before letting it go. “Ok…Does that mean I won’t visit her today?”
As predicted, Harry went silent for a moment. He picked up their son and placed him into his crib before coming back for Lyra.
"Now, we know you've got your own plans for living elsewhere, Harry," Arthur began. "But you've always been like a son to us."
At those words – too erotic to resist – Draco couldn’t hold back. His hands sank into Harry’s hair as he emptied himself in his lover’s mouth with a loud cry.
For the most part, Boxing Day was quite pleasant. In the morning, Andromeda and Teddy left to visit friends for a few days but she promised to return for the New Year’s ball.
Voldemort hummed. “Perhaps so...Tell me, how is Severus doing with his favorite subject!”
Harry waited until the g-string was the last item still touching Draco's body before speaking.
"It's in my trunk. I had it on but felt too warm, so I took it off." Draco pulled out one of his monogrammed handkerchiefs and blew his nose.
Draco rushed over and carefully found his way into his fiancé’s arms.
Harry grinned at her. “I believe our first few arguments paved the way for this slightly more than civil relationship to develop… Those arguments proved points on both sides and we just seem to understand each other now.”
Sirius took a deep breath and set his resolve with a nod. "I promise to be good, pup."
"Theo, Blaise, Millie, and..." Draco paused, suddenly unsure. "You...?"
Draco relaxed. He’d thought Harry was regretting the decision to have another child this soon. Thank God he was wrong. As they went back to their meal, he told Harry his plan for the next few days. “I can’t take the potion until it sits overnight, so Mother is coming first thing in the morning to get the children.”
"I'll take care of the rucksacks myself. Uhm, I have a snowy owl named Hedwig. I expect her to find her way here soon." Harry instructed the elf. "Please let me know if she arrives?"
Hannah Finch-Fletchley wrote to Hermione after she gave birth to her and Justin’s daughter, Shannon Josephine, in the early morning hours on August twenty-eighth and Harry grinned as his friend read the letter to him. He was glad to hear that everyone was making the best of this crazy marriage law.
“Unfortunately this type of secret is akin to the fidelis charm. Only the current head of the family can share it.” Draco confessed.
Harry took the letter and gave the stately eagle-owl a treat before opening it.
"Yes, but your body knew before your mind, darling." Narcissa pointed out. "You and your father and I - we are Slytherins. We tend to think of our bodies as tools and use our minds before our hearts, while Gryffindors like my cousin, and I think Harry too... they go with their instincts and then think about it later."
******** ******** Chapter 31 ******** ********
When Harry reached the first floor, he noticed a short hallway. He found a small empty bedroom with a small bathroom next to it and moved on to the drawing room. A sofa sat facing the fireplace with two armchairs flanking it. There was a desk off to the side and a tapestry hanging on one wall.
Draco's face went red but he took the lead and stepped into the room to interrupt. "I'll make a deal with you, P- Harry...If you try to handle my abnormalities, I'll try to handle yours."
“I’d love to, Harry… If you don’t mind of course,” Al was grinning as the tiny girl squirmed in her daddy’s arms. “My little ones were born after my mastery was finished, you know.”
“Dinki?” Harry called.
“I hear you’re doing quite well for yourself, Draconis.” The portrait said mildly.
"I guess that makes sense." Ron grumbled.
“With Draco and Auntie Cissa and Uncle Luc and the Weasleys…yeah…we are all taking care of you.” Harry nodded hoping reassure Teddy that all was well.
“I’m sure you’re right, Harry.” Cedric laughed. “That sounds just like him!”
"Shall I ask my elves to assist in moving the plants?" Harry offered.
"We could ask the elves for a picnic and go to the Room of Requirement?" Harry suggested. "Or we could go to the astronomy tower with it?"
“Dragon, there’s a lot of time before New Years. You could work hard and meet your goal by then.” Harry encouraged his husband.
"Has your shop been running long?" Harry asked to pass the time.
“Draco? Are you alright, love?” Harry called through the door.
Blaise was shocked and staring at her while Zack was just gobsmacked. “D-Dragonlord?”
Harry paid no attention to Draco’s words but pulled the blond onto his lap. He stroked his husband’s hair and whispered, “I’m just so glad it wasn’t us!”
"I did some reading yesterday with Blaise's help." Draco told him carefully.
“I have a theory, Harry… I think he’ll only respond to you…to your special brand of humiliation – if you will … and I want you to help us conceive a child.” She said it so plainly…as if asking for tea.
Harry tried to keep his face clear of emotion. He wanted this to be a surprise and he didn’t want to ruin it by smiling too obviously. He shrugged his shoulders and casually uttered, “Oh, haven’t I said it yet? It’s the cottage in Kent.”
“Well, it’s true. So you tell me if I’m alright.” His voice was hoarse as he pocketed the coins and gathered up the bottles.
"Yes; I’ve ordered tea here and Dinki is bringing yours to the suite." Narcissa beamed. “Pansy will be joining you.”
It wasn’t a request and Draco knew it.
"And you're grateful to him." Harry said in understanding. “How is she bad?”
“If you think it’ll help, we can push the boundaries a little.” Harry suggested as he placed his hands on Draco’s neck and shoulder muscles and began to knead them.
The elder Malfoy slowly lifted his cane and placed it against the sketch for comparison.
A moment of consideration gave Draco the answer he needed to elude Pansy’s interest and pique Blaise’s. “History of Magic.”
Draco frowned. "What do you mean by that?"
Harry cradled the blond for a moment before cleaning them both up and settling into bed beside him. The two young men slept for a while but Harry woke to find Draco rubbing against him begging for another session of love making. This time Harry was gentle and sweet as he lubed and stretched his husband. He kept Draco on his back and reveled in giving his Dragon as much pleasure as he could. They slept the rest of the night and into the next morning.
"Oh my!" She squeaked and tugged her ear lightly. "You is being my Master Harry, for certainly!"
"Korlag, your letter said there's an issue with my vaults and you're supposedly my estate manager but I was unaware there was enough of an estate to manage, let alone that I had more than one vault." Harry said quite seriously.
"I do as well, Harry." Remus smiled sadly. "I looked around when we got here and the yard has a good muggle security system in place and passive wards that I traced to a young witch living a little more than a mile away, perhaps a family member of his. There shouldn't be anything to worry about."
Draco’s fingers dipped back into the jar as his eyes swept Harry’s body and finding the spot he wanted, Draco drew a deliberate line down Harry’s happy trail and over his cock. Then the blond dropped to his knees and began licking it off. When he reached Harry’s cock, he wrapped his lips carefully around it and proceeded to suck him off.
"Lord Potter, welcome." Dumbledore smiled down at him before addressing the rest of the students. "Now, Lord Potter will have ministry business as well as school work to take care of. I don't want to hear of anyone pestering him."
"Why, I must send an elf to fetch your baby pictures, of course!" Lucius grinned slyly.
Harry told him and Draco became intrigued so Harry promised to take him someplace with that amenity during the summer.
"Muggles are non magical people with no blood connection to a magical person." Harry explained patiently. "Somehow you aren't a muggle, Dudley. You're a squib, which means that one or more of our shared ancestors were magical. That would also explain why our grandparents were so happy that my mother was a witch."
Harry had sworn it wouldn’t work and put it off until the last second. Directly after the last trial’s result was announced and Lucius was set free to join his family at the Manor, Harry and Draco met at Hogwarts to cast it. Harry hated to do that to his love but desperate times called for desperate measures and the submission aspect of it already meshed well with their lives and desires. The ritual bound Draco’s soul to Harry’s and wouldn’t allow Draco’s body to respond to anyone else, so the trick was to keep Harry and his effect on Draco hidden as long as possible.
"So you believe that because Draco has a creature mating bond with you and it will happen eventually -" Lucius demanded suspiciously.
“Yes, Healer.” Draco sighed.
Draco nodded once before beginning to move his head up and down on Harry’s long hard member. He moaned as he got a taste of pre-come from Harry’s slit and dipped his tongue under the foreskin to give his master more stimulation.
Draco cast the spell to change the coin and asked Harry to join him here at Hogwarts.
“As you wish, cousin.” Luna’s smile unnerved him and he didn’t know why but he relaxed.
“You lost your ‘L’ again, darling.” Harry sighed. “It’s colors…”
A little over month later, Harry reluctantly shared a birthday celebration with his children. He’d wanted to have a bunch of small dinners for himself with each group of friends and family and a separate party for the twins but he was overruled by his husband, mother-in-law and Molly Weasley.
Snape looked uncomfortable.
"The 'thing in the water' was the illusion spell Rowena Ravenclaw put up." Harry smirked at his friend. "I'm getting there, but the dream hasn't come back yet...not sure what to do without more information."
Draco frowned, looking skeptical but sat quietly as they began the discussion.
"Maybe I'm just tired but you're not making sense, Malfoy. You have been such a git for the last several years and now you need to speak to me urgently, but you're not afraid of your father or Voldemort. " Harry looked incredulous. "What's the bloody emergency that couldn't wait for morning or the train?"
"The reporters outside all know that you missed several days of classes and have just now returned, Harry. You can tell them whatever story you want and we'll all stick to it." McGonagall told him gently.
Draco nodded sleepily and his eyes drifted shut just as the door closed.
Draco’s cheeks flushed with color as he nodded his agreement.
"He's staying the night to advise me on a number of subjects and he'll be leaving in the morning." Harry informed her. "May I offer him breakfast?"
“No.” Draco said, shaking his head. “I’m only observing.”
"Don't forget we arranged to see the Tower of London on the 27th." Harry reminded his husband.
Draco blushed. "Don’t mind him, Harry. He’s just not happy that I’m part succubus.”
Harry felt like they'd made progress. He looked around. "When you contact me, do it through Draco or Severus. We don't want Dumbledore to know how far off I've gone from his side."
McGonagall smiled. "You want to give him a Halloween wedding and allow the ball to be your own private reception; how romantic."
“It doesn’t suit him at all!” Harry’s face scrunched up in a distasteful grimace.
"I tested quite high and, although I thought it was a good thing, he informed me that it was not." Tom gritted his teeth. "I was told that I was a danger to myself and others. He said that, due to unstable magic, there was a possibility of me becoming an obscurial."
“You didn’t tell me that was the reason you wanted that name!” Draco felt his cheeks heat up as he gasped quietly. “I thought it was because Aunt Altaira’s baby who died with her was going to be named Silvana.”
"This shop?" Mac asked, his eyes widening as he finally found what he'd been looking for. "My family's been running it since the late nine hundreds. The name has changed a time or two but it's always been the same business. We rent boats to muggles and magicals alike. We also run a sightseeing tour of the nearby loches." He held out the envelope allowing Harry to see the label.
Ziva nodded, her ears flapping. "Oh, yes, Master Harry! I is serving the Potter family for several tens of years! You is looking like your father! So much! Ziva is missing Master James!"
“Pansy went into labor!” Draco told him. “It just happened. Marcus only just called Madam Pomphrey. That’s why the portrait is open.”
With a nod, Harry sighed again - sadly this time. "Good luck with the house, Draco. Good night." He walked away, down the hall and into the foyer where Malfoy's elf met him, blocking his way.
“Was she?” Harry asked, eyes shining as he lowered his son back into the crook of Draco’s arm. “Was Papa’s princess eager to meet him? That makes her first in everything, you know, because when Madam Pomfrey cast the spells, the cloud turned pink first and then we named her first, too.”
“So you looked to your own age set.” Starla nodded.
Harry nodded and watched the blond tip-toe around him. Tears pricked his eyes but he refused to let them fall. “Draco...do you regret this - what happened last night?”
Narcissa had the elves bring everyone tea and sandwiches, but they didn’t arrive before the Healer poked her head out of the birthing room. “Harry, everything went well. Draco is asking for you.”
“Draco, it’s so good to see you.” Adrian smiled warmly. “But as I was just saying to Harry, we need to be going. Daphne’s parents have the kids and we promised them we’d be back as soon as we could.”
“I was sure Draco was leading this meeting, wasn’t he?” Harry asked in mock confusion.
“I came to visit Pansy because I thought that a little time with my friends would keep my mind busy…and then we got word that Lavender is in labor.” Draco told him with a shrug. “I was right that the visit would distract me and Pansy was just saying how much she’s missed me.”
Harry sighed contentedly as he and Draco relaxed on a conjured cushion in the Astronomy tower. A languid makeout session was coming to an end and they would soon have to walk back to their dorm. Tomorrow was Valentine's day and Harry was looking forward to the party at Muni's.
"I'll be taking you up on it, Harry." Ginny broke in with an exasperated sigh. "I'd love to have more space and be able to floo-call mum and dad on their birthdays and Christmas ...if we're not home."
Sighing again, Draco admitted to the others that he’d heard Caelum’s excited squeals from the ground as well.
Left to his own devices, Harry decided to explore the upper levels of the house. The door he was standing beside was slightly ajar so he peeked in to find a lovely - if small - formal dining room. As he was about to climb the stairs, he noticed another door. He thought it might be a closet but it was actually a restroom. The staircase was steep but sturdy. He was relieved that the hallway was brightly lit and the walls were white or he might be struggling to find his way.
Nodding, Draco sighed knowingly. “After a visit with your friends, you’ll need to see the goblins about Ginevra’s settlement.”
As Draco threw the floo powder into the grate at the safehouse, he realized that he'd missed seeing Potter at breakfast and in class. He then berated himself for being a sap and spoke the name of his family’s estate.
Harry drew himself back so only the head of his cock was still inside, “I want you, love.”
“Yes, Ron!” Harry laughed as they climbed the moving staircases. “Look, he’s got his own money and he’s from a powerful family so I can be sure he won’t be with me just to use mine. He’s...pleasant to look at...more than...”
“Yes. All during my free periods and on the weekends.” Harry left the door open as he turned around. “I must acquaint myself with my fellow members, mustn’t I?”
They were led to the sitting area of Korlag's office where they both retold the story of the dementor attack and Harry getting booted from the Dursley house as well as Dudley's insistence on going with him.
"I’ve been thinking about it and, well...since seventh years are allowed to visit Hogsmeade any weekend we like and sixth years are allowed as long as they’re accompanied... Why not have lunch there tomorrow?" Cedric smiled at her. She nodded and hurried away with a wave to Harry prompting Cedric to give up on the unnecessary task of holding up the wall. "I hear you have your own password. Do you want to use it or shall we let you in?"
“I’ll set Polli to watch Andy.” Narcissa said quietly. “We have the children to see to.”
Harry chuckled and sent Teddy and the twins into the large bedroom to play while the adults settled things. “Yes. I found out that Draco dreamed of being a Potions Master and did my research. Since it is a dangerous field of study and I wanted my husband to be safe, I looked for a knowledgeable Master that would train him properly. Master Loveday has been a wonderful teacher. Draco is already in his seventh level of training. Did he not tell you that?”
If Harry were capable of rational thought, he would’ve found that funny instead of alluring. As it stood, Harry simply nodded and answered. “Absolutely.”
“Do you still want me to…?” Harry started softly, moving up to lie next to his lover, but Draco cut him off by leaning up to kiss him hard on the mouth.
“I haven’t gotten past the fifth level, Harry.” He whispered. “I promised you I’d be ready by now for another pregnancy and I didn’t get to the seventh level in time for my promise.”
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
“Luc, be nice…I know you remember how we were and I’m sure it’s the same with them. Call for dinner, please, darling; I’m ravenous.” Narcissa smiled softly.
"And during the potion…?" Lucius asked hesitantly.
Harry relented and moved lower onto Draco’s shoulder before giving in to the primal urge and marking his lover. “Cum with me, Dragon…”
Harry James Potter – Savior of the Wizarding World and Destroyer of Voldemort – had taken the name of Malfoy and added it to his… in essence; he was giving redemption to the Malfoy name.
“You know, Harry…” Andromeda paused to sip her glass of water. “I have a book of recipes. I’ll leave it for you.”
Dobby took his hand and popped them back to Harry's apartment allowing him to get some sleep before his first day of classes.
Draco chuckled as Harry’s mouth settled at the base of his neck, but the chuckle soon changed into a moan.
Harry chuckled again. “Anyway, remember the bludger?”
“I’m sure, Mione. Look guys, he’s never fawned over me or pandered to me…you know how much I hate that. He treated me like a regular person who’d annoyed or insulted him rather then falling all over himself to get my attention or ignoring me altogether. He saved us at the Manor when he could’ve just turned us over.” Harry said defending his decision. “I’ve always been a bit obsessive over him…haven’t I? Now, just as I get a chance to date and find out about anyone I might wish to, I’m forced to marry. I think we’ll be good together, so I choose him. Please don’t make things difficult.”
“The public at large seems to have taken quite well to the new plan, Harry.” Draco heard the Minister’s deep voice echoing through the floo as he approached the living room three days after the article. “We’ve already received letters from over a hundred volunteer couples.”
Harry glanced at his husband and knew that’s just what the blond had been hoping.
Harry focussed on the floor and sighed. “On one of the days I am meeting with a member of the wizengamut, he could take issue with my going to the ministry alone and ‘have business there’...”
Harry handled Draco with care and supported him until he could stand on his own again.
"I think resisting it is going to ruin our friendship, Draco." Harry murmured, trying not to reach for his companion's hands. "I see it in myself, don't you? I've been trying to keep the 'just friends' vibe going for almost three months now and I'm getting jealous of the time you spend with Blaise and the others ...and that kiss?"
“Will you have a large wedding?”
“Yeah; I do.” Harry chuckled softly. “We’re a family and we should all have one last name.”
As Harry did so, the toddler waved his arms and grabbed his godfather's nose. Harry laughed. "Do you know what that is? That's my nose! Where's Teddy's nose?"
This was news to Draco. “Are you really thinking of going against them over Harry?”
“What about Draco? He’s due to give birth within that time as well. His parents have been helping so much but I don’t know if I can ask them to take over entirely until the baby is born.” Harry lamented. “At the very least, I’ll have to speak with Draco before I give you an answer.”
Draco focused on the wall as Harry took him. It didn’t feel real. It felt like he was watching someone else’s life – almost like a pensieve memory…and then a hard jab to his prostate jerked him back into himself and he was suddenly very aware of his own body and actions and what was happening to him. He writhed in Harry’s arms and soon breathlessly begged for the privilege of his orgasm. Harry filled Draco with his seed just before allowing the blond his release. Before allowing Draco to drift off to sleep, Harry had him lick the come from his fingers. While watching the blond’s sleeping form, Harry was left to fantasize about their future visit to his club. He’d wait until after the child was conceived…perhaps he’d use it as a celebration of sorts… It would take planning and preparation.
Harry nodded but made a note to keep an eye on his husband nonetheless.
"Remus and I will be withdrawing from the order as soon as we can." Sirius reassured Harry. "We'll make sure he's safe while you're at school."
"Harry Potter calls for Dobby!" Dobby already had tears in his eyes.
"Harry?"
“And save family members from being attacked.” Harry glared playfully at the blond before explaining. “Last week, Draco asked me to get some herb or other for his stomach calming potion and I almost got the wrong one but, luckily, I ran into Amice and she showed me the correct one.”
Blaise stared at him in shock. "You're other powers awoke when...and now..."
“Malfoy!” Ernie breathed.
"I can't even hold your views on blood purity against you." Harry shrugged. "I know that's what you were taught."
Narcissa bit her lip and seemed to be holding back a laugh. “Lucius had a little problem with the boys but it wasn’t anything to worry about.”
“Dobby and Ziva could mate?” Dobby asked, ducking his head.
Draco was watching his aunt and he got a feeling that what she was going to say would upset him so he nodded to Harry. “Yes, please add the calming draught.”
"You know, Harry, with that kind of training, you might want to think about applying to be one of Hogwarts' muggle-born contact agents." Dean suggested as he brought in a tray loaded with coffee, milk, and sugar.
“This is my way of saying that I do... love you, I mean.” Draco blushed. “Did you hear my explanation? It’s a promise ring and by giving it to you, I’m promising that you’re the one in possession of my heart and I’m promising you that I’ll take good care of yours.”
“Love how you respond to me, Draco.” Harry told him softly. “Love how sensitive you are...how vocal.”
"Show me this 'loose brick'." Harry said to Ron.
Divination might be helpful this year considering his dreams and the multiple prophecies, but Harry wasn't sure so he asked about private study for ancient runes and was told that not only would it conflict with his other courses but he would be two years behind his classmates. A touch disappointed, he at least had Hagrid's class to look forward to. Care of magical creatures was fun and interesting ... if a little on the dangerous side.
Astoria tuned Harry out as she concentrated on her task.
“You know she likes for you to use her first name, Kingsley.” Harry grinned and turned toward the active floo with his wand drawn in case it wasn’t Hermione.
"I see…You're not just trying to put it off as long as possible to avoid the issue?" The Minister asked.
“Harry...” He took a step forward. “I know we’ve gotten off to a somewhat horrific start...”
"For the honeymoon we wouldn't have gotten if it wasn't for your meddling." Harry smirked as he helped Draco get up on the medical bed that was there.
"Good." Draco murmured, kissing the brunet's cheek. "Wait here. I'll let Mother know and then I'll run you a bubble bath. That always calms me."
“If he is…” Lucius paused where his son had left off. “The prophecy could be about you.”
“Once per week?” Harry asked lightly.
Draco turned to look up into Harry’s beautiful green eyes.
They came up to the door and waited for Harry to say something but he didn't.
Korlag shooed everyone back away from the scroll as he unrolled it.
“You have?” Ron asked, sounding uncertain.
“There’s a door over here.” Cedric pointed out.
"That's when we gather in the parlor to open the rest of the gifts." Draco's eyes sparkled as he went on. "I usually hand out the gifts myself but this year we’ll have the elves do it so I don’t have to lift things that may be heavy. When that's over we each have some time to ourselves before luncheon which is served in the formal dining room."
Sighing, Draco nodded and added a short ‘meow’ for effect.
******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ******** ********
“Pfft.” Zack sneered and plopped down into a seat. “I’ve spent four years in and out of that common room. There’s nothing special in there.”
Draco smiled at him and waved his hand toward the table and the walls. "It's beautiful; isn't it? The elves did quite a wonderful job with the decor." There was a pumpkin in the center of each table with a large boquet of tea roses. Candles floated above them and the wall sconces held some also.
As they entered the study, Harry looked around. The room was larger than the one he and Draco had used at Potter Grove. It had the bookcases and desk Harry had been expecting, but there was also a snooker table, a chess set and a pensieve.
"You?" Draco gasped and covered his mouth in shock. "You stole all of my underwear?"
“That will be very important, Mr. Potter, but it’s not the most important thing.” McGonagall cut in. “From what you said earlier, Mr. Malfoy - Lucius, that is - seems most concerned with their name and reputation as well as maintaining a level of control over his son. He always expected to have Draco and his future spouse under his own thumb because in this world there are rules and procedures for relationships such as these.”
“No need, Diggory, I’m here. What’ve you found?” She asked as she made her way inside. “My word!”
“You did fine in the month before we got married. You’re probably just out of practice.” Draco smiled again. He knew just how to help. “You write the letter. I’ll look it over and make any necessary changes, alright?”
Lucius nodded. “Harry is correct, son. Your mother would’ve done the same in your state.”
“His name was Voldemort, Lucius.” Harry interrupted quietly.
"I feel the way I feel, Lord Potter." Zack turned so as to lean next to Harry. "I believe different alliances would benefit you more than the one you've formed with the Weasleys ...that being said, I will not attempt to interfere in your familial relationships from now on."
A silver tray appeared in the center of the table with dinner rolls and a large round crystal dish accompanied it with multiple servings of butter which had been transfigured into a distinctive daffodil shape.
“Please bring a glass of cool water for each of us. Draco isn’t feeling well.” Harry didn’t even look her way as he spoke.
Harry smiled as he waited.
Draco’s eyes welled up with tears. “Auntie, no!”
Draco looked over at his mother with a look of confusion which was echoed by Harry.
“I don’t want to strain your resources, Marcus, but I could use the money,” Pansy had a soft smile.
“He wouldn’t have cared. Riddle wanted things that were grand and worth lots of money and prestige. As the last living heir of Slytherin he felt entitled to them. Your Manor is a symbol of your wealth and power. He moved in and took it over so that his followers would see that he was powerful enough for even the Malfoys to bow before him…” Harry told them softly. “Now, if you don’t mind, I’d prefer not to spoil my first married Christmas with thoughts of that psychopath. The war is over.”
“Even after living in the same apartment for the last month?” Draco asked in disbelief.
“Yes, there’s a seal that protects that information. Once the paperwork was signed and submitted, only I could tell someone what my form is.” Harry said taking sympathy on his beloved husband as he told the story for him.
“Yes?” Harry looked down at his suddenly nervous slave.
"When did you change your name to 'Harry' Malfoy?" Ron frowned at him pausing in mid-scoop of some eggs into his mouth.
"Would Master like Dobby to bring him back to the apartment?"
"He didn't have to." Snape stood. "I didn't make it for him ... but I know how he got it."
Draco smirked at her. "Blaise's gift was the first one I found this year. He's been after season tickets to the Appleby Arrows for years."
“When I’d come out of the trance, I was in my owl form and coincidentally met by a barn owl that looked very familiar to me…” Andy looked sad. “By that time, I was engaged to my Ted.”
Al nodded understandingly. “It’s quite alright. I shouldn’t have brought it up. I hope I didn’t ruin your mood.”
Ron nodded slightly to accept Draco's interpretation of things.
Harry smirked as he ran one hand through Draco’s hair as Astoria had done before. “Good boy, Draco. Now I want you to stand and strip. You will not be allowed clothing unless you are going out in public.”
"The Minister told us of your consummation..." Lucius began as he looked mildly disturbed. "I hope all went well..."
"How does she do with house elves, Mr. Turner?" Hermione asked, sounding smug.
"They know?" Draco's eyes widened.
Dessert was dished out quickly and devoured in a pace that was just as rapid.
"They will glow blue while they process the blood and green when they are ready to be read." Korlag informed them. "This one will glow red if you are under dangerous enchantments and yellow if there are enchantments but they aren't harmful."
"Maybe you have a mail blocking spell too, Mr. Padfoot, sir." Dudley suggested carefully as he looked at the sandwiches on the table.
Harry bowed over Draco's mother's hand before meeting his host's gaze. "Lady Malfoy, it's lovely to meet you. Lord Malfoy, thank you both for hosting this gathering."
Harry’s mind raced as they fell. Teddy was gone and there was nobody around to help them if they fell to their deaths. His kids would be angry at him for being reckless and leaving them after already allowing their lives to be disrupted by the divorce. Somehow, he was staring into worried grey eyes. He’d never know how - maybe centrifugal force had something to do with it - but he was being held face to face with Draco. Chests pressing together as they were, there was nowhere to look besides each other’s faces and Draco’s eyes were so silver and so very different than his soon to be ex-wife’s brown ones. They spun as they fell and suddenly he was aware of the ground coming up to meet them. His wand was wedged deep in his robes so all he could do was hope Draco’s wasn’t. His hands skimmed the fit body and soon gripped Draco’s wand through the cloth of his stylish robes. He quickly cast a desperate spell to cushion the ground with just enough speed to save them.
The day seemed to go quickly after the small fireworks display. Harry fed them and changed them quite a few times while continuing to show them colors. When they moved down to the garden, he held up a green apple and showed them green sparks to match the skin of the fruit along with grass of a similar color. He showed them an orange and then showed them orange sparks. He tried to do the same with each color.

"Draco, I had wanted to speak with you before now... it's about your..." Narcissa bit her lip. "Marital duties..."
“I don’t know if the Malfoy name even deserves to continue into the future, Mother. Father has quite disgraced it with his choices in the past two decades.” He eyed Lucius. “Perhaps he can try to see things from my point of view…”
Draco clenched around him and cried out loudly as he came into his hand.
“We hated each other once, Teddy! I will not risk having my relationship with Harry revert to that!” Draco was adamant in this and Teddy could see that he’d be wasting his breath to say more until he heard Draco’s soft and barely audible longing sigh. “If only Hermione hadn’t shown up…”
Padma had given birth a week into March...almost ten days late. Harry and Draco had visited as soon as they got the news. The new baby was a sweet but chubby little girl named Yasmin Mary Boot.
"Don't you?" He frowned but Harry shook his head.
“Come on, Harry; I’ll show you the way.” Draco began to lead him out of the room.
Harry shrugged and began to follow but Draco hung back. "What is it, Mother?"
Harry’s lips mouthed the words ‘Thuban James’ over and over before biting down on his lip to stop the tears. “James?” He asked. “Really?”
Harry chuckled but it was a bit forced. “You could be around for years, you know! This condition might dissipate or be curable with a little research. You could outlive Draco and me, for all we know!”
During the visit, Lyra took her first unassisted steps. The Weasleys were ecstatic to be witnesses but Harry felt a bit guilty that the Malfoys had missed it so he had her demonstrate it for them later that night and this time Caelum joined her.
"Even at home the night sky shows more stars." Ginny added lightly and, as she took the spot next to Luna, their hands met.
"Yes. That was a difficult situation you walked into on the train." Harry winced. "On a lighter note, I came out to Ron. He wasn't entirely happy with me being gay but he wasn't openly hostile about it either."
"What's going to happen?" Harry asked his godfather as he fumbled with his tie.
“From the first part of your story, it seems like your father didn’t like Harry too much.” She looked at the other blond.
“Peas come, Papa.” The twins said, almost at once.
Draco blushed as he realized they were now alone and Harry’s arm had already curved around his waist to lift him into a tender embrace.
Hedwig flew into the room and landed on her new perch.
“Harry, I agreed to marry him! I promise you that he’s not usually like this!” Draco shook his head sadly while extricating himself from Harry’s warm safe arms. “Now, I’m expected at home and I’ll speak with him when he joins me.”
Dudley was shaking his head but it came again.

Draco shivered delicately at the sound of his married name. “Please, call me Draco.”
Draco walked over to Harry biting his lip. He reached around the knife, dipped two fingers into the chocolate flavored goodness and smeared it onto Harry’s chest. Innocent grey eyes flick up to meet Harry’s as if to say
Harry just nodded as Draco reached for his right forearm and was shocked when the blond licked it before shaking a bit of salt over the moist area.
"Alright, Moony. I'll be in touch." Harry answered with a wave, not wanting to watch him leave.
"I told him you were coming and asked what you enjoyed." Harry huffed.
Harry reached out to touch the fall of ice. “Oh Malfoy, I have ancient secrets to keep too. I don’t want Dumbldore or your 'uncle' to know about this just yet.” He could see that Draco was torn so he reached out to help the blond up. “Come to the meeting with your father? I'll be asking him here.”
“Alright Draco, it’s time to push. You’re ready,” the Healer said encouragingly. “Take a deep breath first and then bear down!”
“Why not?” Harry asked cocking his head to the side.
Harry shook his head. He couldn’t believe these people. The inquiry had taken place months ago and he was – only now – being sent the official letter? He sighed. At least they’d passed and there wouldn’t be more of their bothersome interference. He gave Altaira a piece of sausage before finishing his meal. She took it and flew off through the window.
Draco bit his lip and winced at the political statement. He’d wait until later to scold Harry. This was about being with their loved ones not politics. “To health and happiness…and love and life. Happy New Year!”
"How can Dobby help Mister Harry Potter, sir?" Dobby's hopeful expression almost made Harry feel bad for calling him.
“I’ve wanted them for a long time, Draco. Now they’re mine, and I can do anything I want with them.” Harry said as he rolled Draco’s balls in his palm.
“There, now…You see, Dragon? All you needed was a nice few hours alone.” Narcissa’s lips were curved in happiness that her son’s anxiety had been soothed.
“Dobby, fetch them.” Harry commanded. “Are they dangerous?”
“I want someone to love! Is that too much to ask?” Harry stood up and yelled. “I want someone to love… someone who has the guts to tell me off occasionally… someone who won’t let me walk all over them and pretend I’m always right when we both know I’m wrong. I’m not perfect, Draco! I know it and I want the person I spend my life with to know it too and accept it! I want you because I think you are the person who can do all of that and more! Our little duels, our witty banter and the little altercations… You make my blood burn and my heart race. We’ve such a passion between us in life outside of the bedroom that I want to see how it translates inside of it.”
