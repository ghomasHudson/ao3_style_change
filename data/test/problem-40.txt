For the first time in ages, the trademark Malfoy smirk felt right on his lips. “Well, then. Lucky you.”
Draco slipped on the long overcoat as he came down the stairs to meet Potter in the living room. He stopped short as Potter's eyes widened. "What?"
"He wants everything." The words fall heavy from his mouth, and Draco's a little amazed he didn't hear them thunk onto the rug.
Narcissa swallows as her mouth goes dry and her stomach pitches headlong toward her toes. It's a feeling she has to struggle to recognize.
Draco flips around and Harry gets a good look at his face. The man is wrecked. Sweaty, flushed, and glassy-eyed. There are smears of wet paint across his chest and thighs from where they pressed together earlier, leaving colorful, patchy smears on Draco's alabaster skin, hiding in the faint ridges of the scars on his chest. The halo of normally perfectly-coiffed hair is damp and mussed, his lips are red and parted, and his cock—his cock is long and hard, purpled with need, wet and shiny at the tip.
Harry made his way deeper into the line of trees, never altering his path. As he got closer, his nostrils picked up Draco's familiar lavender and citrus scent and another, blacker aroma.
All his years of pureblood training kicked in and he bowed formally before kissing the back of her hand. “Hermione. You look lovely this evening.”
Draco's head lifts slowly, and his breathing is shallow, like it's taking everything he's got to make his neck move. His lashes flutter, and those dilated slate eyes come up to catch Harry's. His nostrils are flaring as his jaw clamps shut. Harry can tell he's trying to get his breathing under control. He's trembling all over, shaking like the last leaf on a tree, hanging onto the metal frame as if he'll buckle without it.
“Harry, she wants to talk to Draco.” Hermione’s voice was insistent, but her eyes were tinged with trepidation, as if she couldn’t quite gauge how far to push. Draco had no doubt that she and the rest of the Weasley clan had been on the receiving end of Potter’s volatile vampiric temper.
Harry sat back down, feeling suddenly out of place. He straightened, hoping to afford himself some distance from the situation, from being alone with Ron for the first time in a very long while. It tickled at the back of his mind that the awkwardness was one-sided, because Ron sat next to him like nothing untoward had ever happened. Like nothing in the past between them mattered.
It is a glorious sight to behold. His mouth goes a little dry, in a way it hasn't in very long. The feeling is so welcome he has to say something to fill the silence and maintain his grip on his composure.
"Hermione and I, despite our differences, have always worked well as a couple. I mean, at heart, we are two totally fundamental people, right? But, we balance each other out. Even though there's so much we have in common, there are things about us that keep us separate. Individual. That's not a bad thing," he rushes to say, "It keeps us on our toes, you know? And for all that we are one unit, there's always been this tiny space that, I dunno, divides us somehow." He rubs a resigned hand over his face. "But Pansy—I mean, she just came over and stepped right into it and filled it. Like it was nothing. We came together, the three of us, and there was no awkwardness, no 'where should I put my hands' or 'am I getting this right'. She came in and we just…clicked. We clicked. A lot. There was a lot of clicking. I think we traumatized Crookshanks and ruined the good rug. My mother gave us that rug. I shudder to think what would happen if she knew what we did on it." Harry laughs with him as he continues, "She just takes up those parts that Hermione and I can't come together on. I mean, there we are, all three of us, naked on that fucking couch, her sprawled out between us. She's got her head in 'Mione's lap, and they're kissing and stroking each other's hair, talking about Shakespeare, and kitten heels, and quarterly fiscal earnings. Just all cozied up together, gorgeous and happy. And the next second, Pansy's poking me with a toe, giving me shit about the Cannons, and demanding a foot rub."
Harry narrows his eyes in acute displeasure and glides forward right into Malfoy's personal space, hovering just on the other side of uncomfortable. His voice is low, this time it's dangerous and he knows it, but he doesn't care. "I'm long out of school, Malfoy. And I may have been a Gryffindor, but I can assure you that I am in complete control of myself. I no longer 'blunder about' and you can be certain that for every move I make, for every word that comes out of my mouth, there is a reason behind it. So I'm going to figure out how and why I got here, whether or not it pleases you. You can decide to be nice, or you can decide to be a shit. But I'm telling you that if you expect me to revert to our old, petty ways, it's not going to happen.
Draco looks suitably fuddled when Harry pulls back. The sight is pleasantly arousing. He turns and heads for the doors.
Harry's head is swimming now with all the possibilities that are open to him, with all the ways that he and Draco can come together. It's a bit dizzying, and altogether perfect, and Harry reels against the thought. It's more than he ever could have hoped for.
Narcissa laughs despite herself. "Yes, Draco can be an acquired taste. But we've both learned over the years to cultivate new interests."
She scoffs, using her free hand to brush lint from his tie. "I've been running a business and making a name for myself. You know what that's like. Busy, busy."
Draco steps under the beat of the spray, rinsing out his hair, even as his hand starts pumping over his cock. Soap runs in his eyes with a slight sting, but even the hint of a burn only serves to heighten his arousal. The drag of his palm is bracing, and the faster it moves, the more the breath catches in his lungs. He throws his head back, giving into the harsh build of pressure, and lets the water cascade over his face and neck. It's Harry's hand on him now, he imagines behind closed eyes. Harry's hand stroking over his flesh, Harry's body next to him, Harry's words whispering in his ear.
He thought of his mother and his father, and briefly wondered if the flowerbed around their tomb was being kept. “I don’t have anything else to take.”
"Come for me. I want to watch you come all over yourself while I fuck you with my fingers."Draco's mouth falls open on a strangled hiss as he comes, his cock spurting in thick, heated ropes between them.
Potter swallowed hard, but didn't move toward him. His voice was raspy as he asked, "So you really did know it was me?"
Draco's laugh is utterly mocking. "Of course I know your wife. I'm a Death Eater with money. And your wife is Undersecretary to the Minister of Finance. Surely your tactical brain can put together how our paths might have crossed."
When the door shuts, Harry sucks in a harsh breath and adjusts the erection that's been insistent in his jeans.
Potter sat up and leaned forward, bracing his hands on his knees, continuing his scrutiny. Draco’s spine stiffened as Potter stood, gliding toward him on silent feet, that frank appraisal taking him in from all sides as Potter circled him like a bird of prey. He felt a pointed gaze at the back of his neck, but remained still, even as Potter’s head got closer, tickling the back of his neck with breath that was surely far too warm for the undead. As he came around front, their eyes locked and Draco swallowed hard, not missing the way Potter’s eyes snapped to the movement and remained there, mesmerized by the unconscious gesture.
Harry ignores him in favor of quelling the look of surprise on Narcissa's face. "Of course I'm sure. I wouldn't have suggested otherwise. Nev's the best when it comes to plants. He's the Herbology professor at Hogwarts now."
Hermione tilted her head to the side, thinking. “Possibly, provided that you and he are cohabitating and fulfilling the requirements of the Consort bond. But, he would have to find a Ministry-approved brewer willing to sell to him once he was back on the list. And given how the media has touted his every crime, it’s not likely. It’s terrible, but that’s how it is.”
And of course, standing to the left of the desk, is fucking Potter. Stilted pleasantries are exchanged, Potter looks indescribably smug, and Draco sits at Robards’ direction. From there, it’s all shot to hell when Robards opens his mouth and reveals the real reason for calling Draco back from France. This case has little to do with potions, and absolutely everything to do with rogue Death Eater terrorist cells. Even worse, they expect him to liaise with, of all people in the known universe, his fucking father. From Azkaban. Before Robards can say anymore, Draco bursts from the chair and tells them no in an exceedingly colorful series of expletives that makes Robards stand and splutter and Potter roll his eyes and chuckle.
She smiled back warmly as Potter and Weasley brushed past him. “Anytime, Draco. If you need anything, owl or Floo me.”
Draco scooted his chair back and came around to stand beside her. “I suppose I’ll be seeing a lot more of you if I’m living with Potter.”
She can't take her eyes off it. It's like the object and the image can't be disconnected in her mind. It is beauty, elegant and finely crafted. It's hard steel, fierce and arrogant. And even though it is static, it is
Draco noted that he only had eyes for Granger, choosing to ignore Weasley’s sputtering and the two other men in the room. The tall man was silent and foreboding, and Draco knew he was looking at a member of the vampire Council, and someone with whom Harry had no intention of acknowledging.
"God, you're gorgeous," Harry whispers. "So beautiful." He smiles down, full of dark promise. "Give it to me, Draco. Give yourself to me."
"Marry me, Draco. You wanted me to take a risk and allow myself to love you. So I jumped in with both feet. It took losing you to do it, and I don't ever want to make that mistake again. It's your turn to jump."
Potter's eyes held a world of untold emotion. "Because you were right. You've given me back my life, at least one part of it, anyway. This is me, trying to give you back yours."
He moves to the nape of Draco's neck, burying his nose in the fine, silky hair, mouthing at him as if he will learn everything about the man by taste alone. He bites along the line of his shoulders, teasing and tasting, alternating back and forth between right and left, causing Draco to pant and shudder.
The meddlesome house irritates him to no end. First, it's the silk-draped fantasy of Draco Malfoy in his bed, and now it's the high-handed show of power that's got him glued to this seat. But Harry knows that on some level he
Malfoy licks his lips and groans, and Harry thinks he might slide right off the sofa. "Merlin, yes. She's a terror, but the blasted wretch makes a chocolate trifle you'd ride to hell and back for. Just don't piss her off. Otherwise, every meal you're served for a fortnight will taste like Hippogriff piss and give you the shits."
After a few seconds, Potter relaxed, and the grip he had on Draco’s hand loosened considerably. Dinner plates were cleared as everyone finished and Molly returned from the kitchen, her hands full.
Ron’s body shook as he chuckled, and Draco’s gaze shot up to notice Potter had gone still. Moonlight passed over his face, and Draco saw the set of his jaw and the fierce emotion that danced over his skin and in his eyes. He knew that look, didn’t need the bond to spell it out for him.
“Draco, Draco, Draco.” Potter whispered the litany of his name against his open mouth like a choir of avenging angels, their blades black with the blood of his soul. “I’ll be damned forever with the taste of you on my lips.”
He buried his face in the crook of Draco’s leg where thigh met body and licked a long stripe up his skin. “Next time,” he promised, “I’ll bite you here while you fuck yourself on my fingers.”
“—and that’s what I plan to do.” Harry looked into the faces of Ron and Hermione, their eyes wide and surprised. Naturally, Hermione was the first to recover.
Potter pulls Draco’s wand from his back pocket (of all places) and holds it out with remarkably steady hands. He says that he’s been meaning to return it and apologizes for not doing so sooner. Draco’s fingers curl around it slowly, because he has to force himself not to snatch it out of Potter’s hand like the ungrateful little shit he used to be. He takes in a deep breath, but his brow furrows because it should feel like coming home, but it doesn’t, not quite. He stares down at it and realizes there’s something else there, embedded somewhere between the hawthorn and his skin, an old tension and a new warmth that he can’t place, but at the same time feels distinctly familiar. It prickles against his magic, starting a slow burn in his chest. He glances back up and knows precisely what it is.
"No," Potter repeated, biting at his arse. "I want you to take another. I want to watch you stretch for me." He breathed out against Draco's skin. "Do you know how gorgeous you are like this?" A third finger pushed its way inside and Draco's breath stalled in his lungs. "I could spend hours here, watching you take me in, licking you inside and out. I could rim your sweet little arse until you come, I bet. Would you like that? Want me to shove my tongue in your pretty pink hole and eat you out until you come?"
Potter moved his feet, shuffling them past the sofa to the far wall where Draco's back landed with a thud. With jeans shoved down to both their thighs, and Potter's hand on their cocks, it was a wonder they didn't tumble to the floor.
The fact is so bracing, Draco has to turn away, as if he can escape the memory it dredges up. Fear, thick and cloying, like the smoke of Fiendfyre.
Potter glanced down at his shirt and trousers, both impeccably crisp. He reached a hand to tug at his collar.
The proverbial ball is rolling, and Harry thinks it's time he made himself a little more visible in Draco's vision. "I think Blaise Zabini had you on your knees and didn't have the first clue what to do with you."
for this. He's still not certain if it's his magic, or the Manor, or a conspiracy of the two. He called for sanctuary. And this is what he got.
She doesn't spare another glance for Lucius and heads for the door. Neville is standing there, bare-chested and mussed from sleep, with eyes bright enough for her to know he's heard the whole exchange. Eyes only for her. He doesn't even glance at the portrait. As she nears, he pulls the door wider to allow her through.
Draco's long lashes fluttered at the change in subject, but he replied smoothly, "I'm in talks with Granger about the requirements for apprenticeship. She seems to think I can move forward with my business plan as long as Snape is listed as partner. Cuts down on my waiting time."
,” he sneered. “As if I’m not already intimately acquainted with the notion. And what the hell is a Consort?”
He shoots a glance at Malfoy, who inclines his head. "Of course, Mother. Rest well. We'll see you at breakfast."
Draco is beautiful like this, perched on the edge of orgasm. Submitting, but at the same time unwilling to cross that line and give into oblivion.
It's hundreds of condescending voices, some familiar, some not. It's the judgment he knows and the repudiation he can't escape.
Draco grabbed Potter by the wrists and wrenched his face free. He sneered at the vampire, "You're not the only one who can throw off a thrall, you know. Despite my failings, I'm still an above-average wizard."
"I'll expect to see you at dinner this evening," Harry says with finality. "Your mother may be used to dealing with your petulance, but I'll not tolerate it. She enjoys sharing meals with you. It disappoints me that you would deprive her of that for your own childish whims. Understood?"
The scarf clenched in his hand dropped to the floor without ceremony. Potter's voice was husky as he whispered, "I do."
Abuse is not in my nature. I will never do anything that is designed to injure you, humiliate you, or degrade you. Submission is a gift. One that I do not take lightly. Now get your things and go back to your room. We can discuss this at another time."
Draco's breath left his body in a slow exhalation down to his toes. Did he want Potter? There were a thousand reasons to say no flitting about in his head, and a thousand reasons to say yes hammering away in his heart.
Potter's brow furrowed in affront and he snorted out an indignant breath. "You're no one's consolation prize."
She poured him a cup and pushed the sugar bowl toward him. He helped himself to two teaspoons and stirred.
"Darling, you certainly look…refreshed this morning." Narcissa's smile is broad across her face as she takes Draco in with motherly scrutiny. "Sleep well?"
Draco's posture stiffens, but he doesn't rise. "No," he says firmly. "My relationship with Blaise has run its course. Permanently. There's nothing in Switzerland left for me but you and the chocolate."
“No!” she barked. “No. He’s changed, yes, but he’s still Harry. Somewhere. He’s lost himself, and he can’t find a way to reconcile the man he was with the creature he’s become. But if you-”
Draco smeared his fingers across Potter's lips, painting them with the mixture of blood and semen. "You owe me, Potter." His voice was a breath above deadly. "I have willingly given you everything, and you stole from me." Potter panted against his fingers, eyes now wide and apprehensive. "You owe me because I can give you your life back, but you can never give me back mine."
He let his hands press back against the shower wall, fighting against the urge to touch as Potter ravaged at his neck and rutted against him. He was afraid that if he disturbed Potter from his feed, it would anger him, much like a dog at his bowl, and he risked further injury, or worse, cause him to pull back and
"Still doesn't make it anything but rude." He steps back, crosses his arms over his chest and glares. "I'd like to know what possessed you to come here."
Draco dropped to his knees in one swift move, and Harry had to throw his head back and hiss as Draco's mouth engulfed his cock. No teasing, no pretense, no sense of heightening the experience. It was sharp and practiced, skillful and precise, exalting and damning all at the same time. Harry panted and gasped as Draco's lips tightened their seal, exerting pressure and suction and warmth that made him go boneless against the table.
"You said you were thinking about potions. Now you can do that. I'll explain how in a bit, but for now, this is yours. I know nothing can bring back your expectations of how you thought your life would go, but this could be your life. If you wanted it to be."
Narcissa's brows knit together at the change of subject. "By magic, of course. I don't understand, what does that have to do with my being happy?"
What doesn't help matters is the softly patronizing shake of Hermione's head and Ron's pinched glare of disappointment.
think is best for me. You've never trusted me to make the right decision." He opens his mouth to say something else, but snaps it shut at the last moment. "I'll owl you in a week or so."
"Well, pack them up because we're not using room, anymore." said Harry, gesturing towards his books.
"T'was fine. I made them practice expelliarmus, today.. It went better that I expected. We're calling it Dumbledore's army.. Oh and I think you're right about Cho fancying me, by the way." replied Harry.
"Well, you could ask him to send his reply by your owl? Owls are smart, Draco. If you tell him not to give the letter to anyone else, he won't. And you know that.. So, why are you making excuses?"
"He's not here, he was never here." it was Draco who spoke. "That wicked elf lied to you. You-know-who showed that scene to you on purpose, he knew you'd come here.. He wanted to bring you here." Draco was shaking with fear and Harry was frozen.
And everyone who didn't see their kissing incident and thought it was just a rumour would now be confirmed it was real.
"At Hogwarts, Harry. Hogsmeade is outside. I'm not ready to go outside." he replied, fidgeting with his hands.
"Potter was expelled.. But of course Dumbledore has to put his nose in every matter. He got the boy a trial and declared himself Potter's witness for defence. His trial is on the 12th."
“Saved Weasley’s neck, haven’t you?” Draco said to Harry. “I’ve never seen a worse Keeper . . . but then he was born in a bin. . . . Did you like my lyrics, Potter?” said Draco and smirked.
"Of course, Harry.. I just meant.. Nevermind. I suppose you're making it public, now. Come on, stop hogging the entrance."
"Dear Godric.. He didn't even go to Hogsmeade today because he was afraid of being taken away by his family and you're saying he cursed Katie?!"
When he was outside the compartment, Draco looked at Harry through the glass and gave Harry a wink which no else saw and departed with his stupid goons who were irritably sniggering.
"I did the same. But Remus said it must be stronger, the memory. Try again, think of something else." Harry said, encouraging Draco.
"It wasn't exactly a memory.. I was just.." Draco took a deep breath. "I thought of you." he whispered.
It smelled a little odd. Like a broomstick handle but there was also a hint of treacle tart. The most prominent smell, however, was a familiar smell with a hint of.. coconut?
"Oh, I'm going to kill that toad- How dare she use a blood quill on you?! THEY'RE ILLEGAL! And on a bloody student!"
"I'm a wizard, Potter. And in case you hadn't noticed, I would be on top of class if it wasn't for your.. friend, Granger."
The moment Potter was fully seated, he came unglued, ramming his cock into Draco with unfettered abandon. The deep thrusts seared him to the core, rocking him against the bed with bone-shattering force. He'd been fucked hard like this before, with other green lovers who coupled 'harder' with 'better', but like everything else, Potter fucked with an innate skill that was mind-blowing. It was raw and animalistic, rough with a sheen of underlying finesse that took his breath away. He grabbed at Potter, clutching to hang on under the assault. Potter gripped back onto Draco like an anchor and continued without pause. He was a beast, and Draco had to marvel that something this wild and uncontrolled could feel so devastatingly perfect. Each snap of Potter's hips shook his body until his teeth rattled, with an advance and retreat timed with paradoxical precision.
Draco's stomach did a flip, knowing that it only took the barest of touches from Potter to get him hard and wanting.
Potter’s fists flexed at his sides, and Draco knew he was fighting back the vampiric impulse to throw Ron away from him as far as possible. Potter knew it was a friendly hug, but the vampire was enraged at someone else touching what was his. No sense in causing him more discomfort.
He was scruffy, from head to toe, more of a general rumpled appearance rather than lack of hygiene. Because if that had been the case, Draco would have refused to speak to him until he was scrubbed clean.
There’s a bit of small talk, none of it about what recently transpired, thank Merlin, general pleasantries they never managed when working together a year ago, but that low fire in Potter’s eyes is growing and Draco finds himself responding to it without question. He is used to all sorts of pretext and innuendo which precedes a sexual liaison. Depending on his mood, he either finds it stimulating or tedious. But the longer Potter sips his drink, the longer his eyes linger over Draco’s body, it becomes clear that witty banter is completely unnecessary. They’ve done the cat and mouse, albeit under startlingly different circumstances. They’ve played this game. There’s already been a winner.
Harry chuckles at the thought of a house-elf insisting on anything from Malfoy. "And how did this come about?"
She prepares the tray and steps back, clasping her hands in front of her. She shifts from foot to foot, as if she has more to say.
Three years later, fresh off a French Potions Mastery, the hard soles of Draco’s bespoke Italian loafers echo down Ministry corridors. He’s flanked on either side by Aurors Ron Weasley (still ginger as fuck) and some Hufflepuff he can’t be arsed to remember. He can feel Weasley’s glare on the back of his neck like fingers, slowly threatening to choke the air from his lungs. Which is patently ridiculous because Draco’s done nothing in the past three years but catapult himself into the lauded position of youngest Potions Master…ever. Suck it, Father.
So, it’s back to England, and back to Potter. He’s dramatic enough to think that this means something, this coming full circle, but there’s too much of his mother’s stubborn Black blood in him to be maudlin about it. What’s done is done. He’s here and he’s always been a magnet to Potter’s true north.
It touches him, deep down, to see Malfoy standing there, all front and bravado, ready to defend his mother from wayward ex-Aurors who have suddenly lost the ability to not spontaneously Apparate. Malfoy, the ex-Death Eater, with his perfect feet, worn trousers, and no-good wand. Malfoy, looking delectably pink and flustered. Malfoy, who, in this moment, is the most gorgeous thing Harry thinks he's ever seen. It's absolutely ludicrous. And of course, because Malfoy is the git that he is, he has to ruin it by opening his spiteful mouth to snarl, "What the bloody fuck, Potter?'
He takes his leave of Millie with a kiss to the cheek and an apology, but when she tracks his line of sight, she waves him off and disappears into the throng of people. Harry hands off his half-empty glass of pumpkin juice to a passing floating tray and adjusts the line of his Muggle suit with a quick jerk to the cuffs and a smooth hand over his tie.
Narcissa pushes her chair back and rises to her feet, slow and graceful as always. "Well," she says on a sigh, "since we're all feeling so wonderful, I thought we might celebrate."
Draco's lips curved into a wry chuckle. "No, if she was bold enough to do that, then no, she wouldn't have cared who was watching." The image of his mother, holding onto Potter made something in his chest twist with a bittersweet ache. He shook his head, and then frowned. "Shacklebolt came? I think he hated my father even more than you."
Harry scribbles his signature on the contract with a flourish, rolls it up, and ties it to Pennywort's outstretched leg. She wobbles a bit and inclines her head, waiting for the affection she thinks she is rightfully due. When Harry takes longer than she prefers to give her a good scratch, she snaps at him and ruffles her feathers. Big, round eyes blink back at him without apology.
He makes quick work of his dinner and tidies up the studio, taking a moment to stretch once it's all done. He's made a bit of progress, and Harry has to admit he feels more accomplished than he has in ages. It's a good feeling.
The bed is turned down and the lights are low. Harry slides Draco under the sheets and slips in beside him. He spends several long minutes watching Draco sleep before gathering him up in his arms and curling around him. Sleep is easy to come after that.
"I'm enamoured of her already," Harry replies. The warmth he feels inside seeps out into his tone. "Thank you, Draco. It means more than you know."
"Awkward?" Draco replied. "No, Potter, showing up to a Ministry function in the same robes as a Weasley is awkward. This," he gestured between them, "this is untenable."
“Do it and I’ll come for you with Hell on my heels. There won’t be enough ash left for your darklings to scrape together. Now get the fuck out of my house before I forget my manners.”
Draco shook his head. "It is what it is," he replied softly. "And that's all it's going to be. Potter's made it quite clear how he feels. I know my place." Draco's brows knit together and he tilted his head in deference. "Draco is being serving Master Potter."
There was something in that statement that begged the question, “Protect me from what?”, but the doors in Potter’s face slammed shut, leaving behind an inscrutable mask. Even if he had asked, he knew he wouldn’t get a straight answer.
The sheepishness slides from Potter’s face in a slow spread at Draco’s humble pleasantries, turning into a swear-to-Merlin all-out smile. Draco’s breath seizes in his chest for a long, slow second as that smile crinkles all the way up Potter’s face into those green, green eyes. He inquires after Draco’s mother, ensuring she’s settled in at home after the trials, how she’s coping with his father’s incarceration, asking if either of them needs anything.
Draco barrels into the room, stomping across the floor like a man on a mission. His angry strides take him right past Harry; Draco doesn't even look at him, just tears across the rug until he comes to a stop at the reading table against the back wall.
, and the moan that comes out of his mouth is patently obscene. He feels Potter’s dark chuckle as it shivers its way down his body, ending at the tip of his confined cock. It’s the fastest he’s ever gotten hard in his life. And by Merlin, he is hard.
Harry raises higher on his knees, bearing more of his weight on his left arm. He's not squeezing any further, but rather letting his weight bear down on Draco in eased increments. His fingers curl, brushing against Draco's prostate, and he jerks upward on a strangled hiss. He pushes in harder with his fingers, faster, adding a third on the next upstroke. The pressure on Draco's body is tremendous, but so is the pleasure, he knows. All Draco has to do is lay back and take it.
“You’re making a mistake here, Harry. I am not often inclined to indulge you, but with such a treasure in your grasp, how could I not alter the terms of my offer?” Silvestri continued his silent perusal of Draco. “He is beautiful—”
He's gotten back into painting, and reached out to Luna at the prospect of opening a gallery in Hogsmeade. She readily agreed, and even made a trip over to the Manor to see Harry's studio and catch up. Luna's wise and accepting soul worked its magic on both Malfoys, and soon they took tea in the solarium as if nothing had ever happened. The Manor itself was pleased beyond measure at her forgiveness, thrumming happily as Harry and Draco gave her a proper tour. Now that he's sent Pennywort back with the signed contract, it wouldn't be long before their venture would come to fruition.
"Good." Draco shifts on his feet, and his fingers fidget by his side. "I was thinking, since I believe they'll be a while in the greenhouse, that you would join me for tea?" He hesitates, and then continues, "I just thought we might enjoy the pleasure of each other's company for a while."
“She was alright for a while, and we had sort of a truce going. But then I was Turned, and she became downright nasty.” He crossed his arms over his chest. “Should’ve known better I guess. But she pissed me off one too many times, so I shut her up for good.”
Granger dutifully ignored the outburst of her husband, waving her parchment instead. “I see you’ve validated the contract with the First Bite. That’s popped off and been filed with the Ministry. I have a copy of your release paperwork here, it’s been recorded and I’ll owl this to you at Grimmauld, Harry.”
Draco was incapable of speech, his body too wrecked and sated to form a reply. He eased back into Potter's hold and closed his eyes, chasing the lingering thrum of Potter's touch in his blood.
Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest. Potter, dead. It was unthinkable. “If he’s that dangerous, then maybe-”
Draco slid up and down his cock in a way that reeked of servitude. Desperately, Harry wished that he was just another nameless, faceless figure, one that his imagination could mold into something that mitigated his guilt. But he wasn't nameless.
Harry laughed at the mental image of Molly shoving a shrieking Ginny out the front door. “She really called her an obnoxious twat?”
His mother offers a delicate shrug and takes another sip of her tea. "Perhaps we have something to offer Mr. Potter, and perhaps he has something to offer the Manor in return. Who can say? It doesn't change the fact that he is here—" And this is where something turns over inside Harry's chest, spreading out an unexpected warmth that travels down his spine to his toes, "—and by his own admission, is in need." She sets the cup on the cart and folds her hands in her lap, linking her fingers together. "I think you should stay, Mr. Potter."
"Yes," Potter snapped, shaking in place. "You would have. It was the right thing to do." He stilled, and it softened out Potter's edges before he added, "You've done it before. You've saved me before."
The soft cotton shirt was indeed one of Potter's, left over from the things Potter had let him borrow. Somehow the shirt never made back across the hall. The fact that even after the wonders of house-elf laundering it still smelled like Potter was of no import.
Harry slides into wakefulness with a half-smile on his face and a comfortable lethargy in his bones. He stretches his arms over his head, relishing the tender pull of muscles and tendons as they unfurl, burning off the heavy fog of sleep. His eyes flutter open to take in the draped fabrics of the overhead canopy. He has to admit, this sort of luxury is something he can get used to. There's no alarm, nothing pressing, nothing that requires his immediate attention. No Ministry to rush off to, no Ron or Hermione calling from the Floo, demanding to know why he's still in bed at—he casts a quick Tempus—ten a.m. on a Thursday.
He canted his hips, feeling the rough drag of skin on skin and the tight vise of Potter's hand. Potter groaned against his neck, biting down on the mark, but not hard enough to bleed. Draco threw his head back and hissed, squirming, desperate to feel more.
He waves off the question. "It's just something I got after the war. I wanted a reminder of how much I'd changed."
He turned to head back up the stairs, calling over his shoulder, “One visit with her, and now you sound like Hermione. God help me.”
Draco's fist stutters as he fucks through it, panting and gasping as thick, white ropes of come spurt out between his fingers and splatter on the floor. The sight of him is filthy and gorgeous, sweaty and debauched, and Harry feels a distinct sense of pride as his name falls from Draco's lips in a half-garbled utterance.
"Okay, okay," he says, sidestepping Harry, "but if I turn up missing, then know she's killed me and disposed of the body."
Draco's moan isn't fully coherent. He's looking at Harry though shower-soaked lashes, and Harry can see that he's deep in the hazy, blissed-out fog of subspace. It warms Harry through because Merlin knows Draco needed it. He has no idea how long it's been for Draco to get this deep, or to get into subspace at all, given what Blaise had subjected him to.
“Even so,” Ron said, shaking his head sadly, “don’t you have to find someone who’s comparatively on Harry’s level magically? In case you hadn’t noticed, he’s pretty damn powerful, what with defeating Dark Lords and all.”
Everything came rushing back at him at once: a rejected hand, scorn and derision, the horrible crunch of a broken nose, the pain of his chest being ripped open, the cold tile of the bathroom floor, a bloated and misshapen face that could belong to no one but Potter, despair and utter anguish, the scent of sweat and fear as Fiendfyre raged, and the feel of Potter beneath his arms as they flew through the air. He took a moment and sat back, staring at the words in front of his face. Slowly, as if reborn, the ingrained sneer Azkaban had worked so hard to beat out of him reappeared. He placed the parchment of the table and raised his eyes to Granger.
Draco's mouth falls open, panting, and his tongue darts out to swipe over his lips. It's a blatant invitation, and Harry's just about ready to accept.
Draco couldn't tear his eyes from the head of Potter's cock, disappearing and reappearing in the loose circle of his hand. Moisture gleamed at the tip, reflecting in the low light against the ruddy redness of his flesh. His brain misfired on all counts, and his words lacked their usual teasing bite as he laughed hoarsely, "That's a terrible line. I can't imagine how many times you've used that."
He kisses his way up Draco's legs—over his shins and knees in turn—in a long, protracted sweep of lips and tongue. The scent of Draco's arousal is thick in the air, bittersweet and salty, and it makes Harry's mouth water. He's careful not to let any part of him brush against the straining of Draco's cock, and Draco whimpers as Harry bypasses it for the junction of where groin meets thigh. Harry closes his eyes and inhales deeply at this narrow strip of sensitized skin, committing Draco's scent and taste to memory.
"I don't know," Harry says, studying the way Draco's hair is falling softly into his eyes. "Might not be so bad."
If Potter wanted to deprive himself, who was he to argue? He certainly wasn’t going to bed, and he most definitely wasn’t going to push the issue, lest he find himself on the angry end of those sharp fangs.
"Ah, well, I'm sure he'll turn up. Were you planning on waiting for Potter, or are you going to keep me in suspense as to the fruits of my tutoring efforts? It wouldn't surprise me if you were." The tone was as dry as he could make it, and the sound hit its mark as Draco's lips curled into a fond smile.
Harry takes a tentative sip from his teacup, deciding how to explain the situation, especially since he's not really sure himself what happened. "I don't know," he says with a rueful, but respectful smile. After all, he did end up arse over tit on her sitting room rug. "Nothing like this has ever happened to me, but honestly, I can't be surprised by all the strange things that happen to me anymore."
“Think about it, Harry. Draco’s always been vain, that’s no secret, but his appearance is the one thing in his life he’s had control over.” She paused for breath. “He’s ashamed of the Mark, you know. Tried to keep it out of my sight line at Azkaban. He knows people see that and assume the worst of him. And now he’s got to try to acclimate himself to a society that’s already prejudiced against him. How do you think he’s going to feel when he has to walk in public, not only with the Mark, but you poking holes in him like a Crup toy? Or is that your plan, to deny him the right to be accepted by shuttering him away with you here at Grimmauld?” Her disappointment sat on his shoulders like weights. “It’s no way to live. You know that, so why in the hell would you put that on Draco?”
The void on Potter’s face shifted, morphing into several emotions too quick for Draco to reconcile, before settling to a strange, eerie calm. The fingers continued their tapping.
The Unspeakable held up a large staff made out of carved cypress and banged it thrice on the podium.  With each bang, more bonfires erupted into flames, to the awe of the pavilion.
As Harry expected, he slept through dinner and, to the next morning. He was woken up by Michael casting several screeching alarm clock charms and, feeling remarkably refreshed, he headed to the bathroom and got ready for the day.
Hermione was worried. She had only ever seen Harry get angry (not annoyed, irritated, or mad) two times. The first was in their 1st Year, and Draco had called Hermione mudblood scum. Harry had gotten all stony, icy, wrong, and Draco had woken up drenched in mud, pigs’ blood, and pond scum from the Black Lake (all of his clothes and bed sheets were too).
James hummed in agreement, entering the dining room, and questions buzzed in Harry’s head.  He had always gone to the Black family rites, so that was no surprise, and of course, he attended the Potter rites, but he and James had never been allowed to the annual event.  What had changed?  Harry had a sick feeling he knew, but he pushed that away when they entered the dining room proper.  There were bolts of fabric splayed across the table, and pincushions littered the floor.  Clearly, Topsy had been at work.
It would be nice to finally have a mask of his own.  Hermione and Draco had never talked about them around him since they knew he was barred from the annual rites, but he had seen theirs one or two times (Hermione’s being a deep blue general masquerade mask and Draco’s being a peacock mask) and had intense and quite embarrassing jealousy for them.  And now, his childish wish he’d had since his seventh birthday -- the year children could join in on rites -- would be granted.
The rest of Harry’s classmates walked up, sniffed the vial, and reported their findings. Harry didn’t pay attention to them overly so (it felt almost like an invasion of privacy) except for Hermione’s (her’s was lemongrass, mint toothpaste, old books, and menstrual blood).
Harry nodded in acquiescence and followed his father down the hall.  It was quite lovely at first glance, with its marble floors, and gaudy cherry wood, crimson velvet, and burnished gold decorations, but if one looked closely, the wood was rotten, the velvet faded and moth-eaten, and the gold tarnished.
To say the reaction was extreme would be a charitable understatement.  As soon as Hermione and Michael caught a glimpse of it, they practically screamed, and news spread like wildfire.  People were shouting, crying, and hyperventilating.  It was complete pandemonium and Harry sat back on his bench and smiled.  That smile quickly turned into a forced one, when he felt the Minister’s burning stare.  Didn’t the man have a job and whatnot??  Why was he here still??  Harry wanted to cry at the Minister’s overbearingness, and his own stupidity -- now the Minister knew someone (specifically Harry) was after his Horcruxes.
When he entered the Great Hall, flanked by Hermione and Draco, his magic hummed lowly, causing the candles near the ceiling to burn a little bit brighter, so he reigned it back in and bundled it uptight.
Comments give me life ngl and help me keep motivation for this project, so a big thank you to everyone who’s commented!
Harry, Hermione, and Draco sat down next to Luna, Cho, and a very lost first-year Gryffindor.  They quickly showed the youngster (Viktoria Rowe) where she should be, and she thanked them profusely, skipping off to join her house.  Harry served himself oatmeal, dusting brown sugar over it, as the rest of the students who were not naturally early risers stumbled into the Great Hall.  Harry took note of who was here: the Slytherins were mostly all here, as were the Hufflepuffs.  Only about half Gryffindors and Ravenclaws were there, and all the teachers were present, including a very deranged looking Minister.
Cho countered, “Yes, but not every spell needs to be time, focus, and energy-intensive.  You could quickly transfigure a thrown knife to butterflies or open up a hole in the ground.  If you were outdoors, you could use the environment to your advantage!”
Harry sent up a prayer to Mother Magic that the Minister stayed away for today (and the rest of his life) and left for breakfast with Hermione and Draco. He had Potions first thing in the morning (not double, thank Merlin, that was on Draco’s A days) with Hermione, Maisy, Anthony, and Terry. After breakfast, he walked to the dungeon classroom with them.
Hermione looked at him like he was denser than limestone before replying in a droll voice, “He’s coming to the Opening Feast because he’s looking for an apprentice. That was all was in your letter, Harry.  Please tell me you read it.”
Harry smiled and greeted Luna fondly before heading over to the 7th year section.  He chatted with some of his year mates, making small talk; yes, he had read the textbooks already Lisa, no he hadn’t seen the newest edition of
Hi!!! This chapter is longer than usual and it contains a bunch of spells of my own making, so a list of all of them and their meanings are in the notes below (for those who are interested).  Also, as usual, a lot of creepiness from our lovely Minister.
of Headmaster Snape, Harry turned his head to the head table.  Like the rest of the school, his eyes widened when the Minister ceased his disillusionment charm and was before them in all his glory.  He wore elegant evergreen robes with silver filigree.  From what Harry could see, Minister Peverell had an ivory dress shirt with an ebony waistcoat, and his hair was neatly done, combed, and gelled to perfection.  His magic washed off of him in sensual waves, heady, dark, and intoxication--it felt quite familiar.
“It is considered a Dark Spell because it relies on inner magic and is influenced by your emotions, even though you need to think happy thoughts.”
changing the ground underneath Harry to a slippery sheet of ice.  He tripped and quickly banished the ice, but it was enough for Susan to recover, and he lost his advantage.
“Mr. Remus, Mr. Black, Cousin Rhodesia, welcome, welcome.  Tinsel and Mipsy have been working quite hard on a lovely memorial feast.”
Sentinal Prison is the prison that doesn't, you know, violate all human rights laws and is for nonviolent crimes (i.e., tax fraud, drug selling, etc.) though Amortentia is the only drug that gets you landed straight in Azkaban.
Harry made himself ignore the upcoming events, how Father was angry, and everything else, instead of clearing his mind and leading Turnip down the leaf-strewn path.  Mother Magic and Morgana, this was good for the soul.
"It is a pleasure to be able to see the faces of the next generation, and I do so hope I will find an apprentice among you all."
"You know I love you, shortness notwithstanding." Harry mocked, before rolling his eyes, causing their small group of friends to laugh and were quickly glared into quietness by an irate Headmaster Snape.  They all winced and looked appropriately contrite, focusing on the sorting hat song rather than each other.
When he got into the room, Professor Black smiled at him kindly, but Harry was only focused on the Minister.  Rage crested in him, and he rudely asked, “What are you doing here??”
“Good to see your manners are still salvageable despite all the rumors I’ve heard about you.  Come in; you’re letting the cold and warm air mix.”
“Take three points, Mr. Macmillan.  As you learned back in your first year, Light Magic uses latent magic and intent. Grey Magic uses either latent magic and emotion or inner magic and intent, and Dark Magic uses inner magic and emotion.  You will with Light Magic, but you have to want Dark Magic.  To cast a
Hi everyone!! I hope you're doing well and I'm sorry for the long wait, I just could not get myself to write.  CW for ritual-based self-harm (like if that squicks you out I recommend not even reading this chapter) and like absolutely bullshit rituals from my imagination.
The man looked just as he always did: entirely put together, save for his thumb-print eye-bags, and the stale smell of fire-whiskey that perfumed his being.
“As you know,” the Minister stated, “I was the one to ban Amortentia, but it does have its uses. Tell me, Mr. Potter, why is that you smell what you do?”
The Minister smiled slowly and dangerously before speaking, “I would like to duel with whoever wins this one; you both are very impressive.”
Harry internally groaned before politely replying, “I fail to see how that is any of your concern, Minister, and I ask that you respect my privacy.”
Harry ignored that, though, in favor of listening to Marietta spin a wild tale about her eldest sister’s latest suitor.  He laughed, and joked, and gorged himself on delicious food, happy to be at Hogwarts and away from James, even if it meant that he couldn’t see Uncle Sirius and Uncle Moony.
She planted a soft kiss on his forehead and patted his cheek.  If anyone else had done that, Harry would have called them patronizing and condescending, but that was just how Hermione was.  To Harry’s embarrassment, the whole situation caught up to him, and he began to cry.  Hermione just hugged him even tighter, and Draco tilted Harry’s head towards him, wiping away Harry’s tears with the pad of his thumb.
I made some edits to the Black family lore (as well as other things, I've been going back and editing stuff -- mostly grammar and readability, so you aren't missing anything) and made it a matriarchy, so Andromeda, as the eldest daughter, is the Black heir, and her 'daughter' (I headcanon Tonks as genderfluid, and so they will be in this fic) Tonks would be the next in line.
Harry gulped and readied himself, loosely holding his wand and squaring his shoulders.  Professor Flitwick unhappily counted off, and the fight began again.  While they were both more than willing to throw the fight, their competitiveness didn’t let them, so they cast spells with unrivaled ferocity and talent.
Soon enough, Harry was more or less done with his makeup and put on his white shift-like robe, careful not to disturb any powder or anything of the sort (he had a preservation charm on, so it was unnecessary, but it was always better to be safe than sorry).  He attempted to style his hair as well, but the static of his magic made it near impossible to do, so with a sigh, Harry gave up.
Debates could go on for hours or even days, but thankfully Cho’s team won in time for them to go to bed at a reasonable hour (11 pm).  When they all finished, Harry was brushing his teeth and pointedly not thinking about the Minister’s
“Barely.” Cousin Rhodesia sneered before continuing, “I only have emotional connections with Harry, you and I are merely family members out of coincidence.  Nothing more.  If you aren’t paying your house-elves I will report you to an auror.”
It was time to get ready, so despite the fatigue still clinging to him like a fine layer of dust, Harry began to prepare.  He followed the same motions as last time: vibrant pigments filled in and sculpted his face, scented oils doused his body, and anything less than perfection was plucked, glamored, or smudged away.  Even though he was exhausted, rubbing a paste on his sore muscles worked wonders, and Harry’s overflowing magic was clearly unaffected by his truly awful nap.
When the Minister nodded, and his magic went back to normal, Snape could have cried with relief, but he had decorum, so, instead, he began telling the creepily interested Dark Lord the tale of one Harry Potter.  How a scrawny, malnourished 11-year-old boy was sorted into Ravenclaw.  He told him about his broken home with a dead mother and a deadbeat father and how his Uncle Moony, the Department Head of Dark and Magical Creatures, raised him.  How the boy was quiet, curious, and intelligent.  He told him of the boy’s magical prowess, academic strengths and weaknesses, and friends.
Harry’s second set of robes was a four-piece set, done in heavy black velvet and sickle-colored, silvery silk.  The high-collared top was first, gold buttons fastened into place with quick precision, and embroidery thread sewed itself as Topsy cut velvet with her fabric shears.  The pants piece was next, and pleats were ironed to a crisp fold by the palm of Topsy’s hands.  His skirt was draped and sewn into the belt piece that Topsy had decided fit better with the skirt than the top.  The cloak with its billowy shape and oppressive heaviness was the final part of the Black ritual robes.
The table laughed, but Hermione just rolled her eyes at Draco’s dramatics and responded, “You knew this would happen. Since when has Double NEWTS Potions not been in the first block?”
In addition to his embroidered animal mask, Topsy made a white linen shift reminiscent of an overly simplified dress and braided a rope of crimson and cornflower blue for the annual rites.  Though no longer popular in family rites, even among the most old-fashioned, traditional way of dress was always adopted in the annual rites. So, it was most important to have a white shift, rope showing your family, and an animal mask showcasing status and family for the annual rites of Yule, Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lughnasadh, Mabon, Samhain.
Headmaster Snape took a breath before answering, "That's all there is to the school files.  The only additional information that could be added is if he was a Quidditch player or was an especially problematic child, and he is neither."
Back in his dorm, after all the introductions and his overprotective friends were done, he sat on his bed.  He had changed into pajamas and drew the curtains.  He cast secrecy charms and wards, not wanting his secret to get out.  Harry could hear the rustling of Michael and Terry (his only roommates), so he waited till all he could hear was the flipping of pages and scratching of quills.
This chapter is a little shorter than usual, but I wanted to be mean and leave on a sort-of-cliffhanger so :)))
It wouldn’t do to contaminate the ceremony robes for this evening, so he dressed in soft pants and an overrobe for brunch.  Cousin Rhodesia and Father were already seated and responded to his late rising with a “Good morning Harry,” and a “You’re late,” respectively.  He just smiled apologetically and settled down to eat breakfast in response.
waiting in vain for an opening.  He never gave her that, and the class was waiting eagerly for the finale.
Also, this chapter was hardddd to not make into tomarry T-T so I just based it on seeing my best friend after a very long time (I've never been far away from my brother for very long).  I hope it doesn't come off as too shippy.
Harry took a deep breath and exited the train, excited to start his 7th year, his last year at Hogwarts.  He would be taking his NEWTS and applying for apprenticeships, hooking up with girls and boys, and drinking liquor until dawn.  This year was his last chance to go out with a bang, though, as the first Potter in Ravenclaw in four centuries, he had made his mark already.
And that box in the middle of his mindscape!  What on Mother Magic’s earth was that?? What did Harry deem to be so important to hide that he locked it up in a floating chest, chains, deadbolts, and numerous keys (useless, all of them) draped over the box? The Minister had tried and tried again to get inside of it, but the damned thing wouldn’t budge no matter how hard he pushed.  What was in there??
He didn’t care about the other’s reaction, that Harry went as stiff as a board and began to hyperventilate, that the magic made him think of his father standing over him and yelling that it was all his fault when he didn’t even know what was going on.  All the Minister cared about was how good that boy’s magic felt—thrumming with power.
The Minister paused and shuffled through the files in his mind, searching for Vivian Penmark when he got to the file, red hot anger, like fire and brimstone, burned through his core.
“I know.  I can feel his eyes burning holes into me.  It’s like he wants me to look at him.”  Harry whispered back.
If Harry had less competent occlumency shields, he would have rolled his eyes so hard they would fall out of his head. But he didn’t, so he just narrowed his eyes and tightened up his shields. They weren’t good enough, though, to stop him from rolling his eyes at Hermione when the Minister opened his Hecate-damned mouth and started to spew dramatics and absurdities.
Harry, Hermione, Draco, and the rest of the 7th years stood alongside the first years. They stood at the Ravenclaw exit as the first years walked single file towards them, Harry did a quick mental count, and the other 7th years did the same.  While they weren’t all prefects, as the oldest students, they had a duty to protect the youngest of them all.
Harry let out a small 'aww' when he saw the first years. They looked adorable and so, so young.  He could see Lisa’s little sister and Michael’s little brother in the group, but he didn’t recognize anyone else, though Hermione did.  She gave a couple of encouraging smiles to a few of them--probably kids she knew from Merope’s.
Was it any wonder that Harry had grown to resent her over the years?  He loved her, to be sure, but instead of focusing on the present and the future, James was focused on decades in the past.  It was nice to remember people, but to only ever constantly talk of her?  It was excessive and obsessive.
form.  He quickly filed that away, moved onto lunch, then Transfiguration, then the debate, and finally dinner.  Usually, he didn’t have to do all this work; it ordinarily did it itself, but with his mind shields newly rebuilt, Harry had to help all the functions run properly (cataloging information, filing memories, etc.).
Looking at the tapestry gave Harry a sense of pride, and it was with that sense of pride that he finally fell asleep, safe in the soft cocoon of his mind.
When the shade absorbed the last of the hyacinth tears, Harry poured his magic into the air, corralling the shade into the diary. It shrieked and screamed, and when Harry heard Tom scream too, he almost faltered, but he kept going until the wailing stopped and a strange feeling of
Finally, the sorting was over, and the Headmaster began to speak.  He had the same speech every year, so Harry tuned it out.  Instead, he took note of all the new students: Tallulah Cole, Bishop Corner, and Poppy Lake he knew from their older siblings, but he didn’t know the other 12.  15 students in total.  It wasn’t the smallest year, but it certainly wasn’t like Hufflepuff's year with 34 children.
"Calm yourselves!"  An agitated Headmaster thundered (he was exceptionally attuned to magic).  That had the opposite reaction of what he wanted, so the older years calmed down, the younger years, especially those sensitive to magic.  Some were crying, others had thick, red blood pouring out their noses, and many were pale and shaky.  One girl had even vomited and was extremely mortified.
"7th years, escort the first years to their common rooms. The rest will be dismissed in 15 minutes." He called out.
Before he did any potion-making, Harry set up his cauldron, knives, the salt mortar, and pestles, measured out all his ingredients, chopped the Io tongue with a copper knife, and crushed his purpura brassica.  Then he was finally ready to start making the actual potion, so in a brass cauldron, Harry poured 300 mL of Standard Potioning Water and the flame onto medium.  He cast
“Right!” Professor Black started, “Now after we went over the safety procedures on Tuesday, it’s time to start on our first project of the term. Ms. Brown, what can you tell me about Amarenovis?”
Harry kept chanting, forwards and backward, over and over, watching as the diadem began to shake and vibrate, a storm grey shade slowly coming out. The shade flickered in and out of existence, and began to absorb the blood, sated like a cat drinking warm milk. It had consumed all of the blood except for the Ayin runes and was a solid near-black color when Harry changed the chant.
They weren’t speaking at all, their shield charms flickering in and out, blocking spell after spell.  Harry hit Susan with an overpowered
The next day, Harry was in his Dark Arts class and desperately regretting waking up in the morning.  Breakfast had been fine, and so had Charms, but then he got to the DADA classroom and saw the blackboard with
Then the Minister got angry. “You will tell me why you smell green apples, dark chocolate, masala chai, ink, and vomit, Mr. Potter.”
“Exactly!”  Anthony added before continuing, “You could change trees into beasts, vines into rope, soil into ice, sand to glass, the list goes on!”
Harry just stood up, put his hands on his desk, and hissed, long and slow. Well, he actually spoke parseltongue, if the Minister angrily hissing back was any sort of indication.
I have the next chapter written already, so that should be up soonish.  Thanks for reading and have a great day!! <3<3
They waited for the potion to settle for precisely 24 minutes and 20 seconds before unceremoniously dumping the rose stems. After waiting 16 minutes and 12 seconds, Hermione added the rose leaves too.
Harry turned his attention to the blackboard where the instructions for Pellisseatio, or more commonly known as Pink Skin Draught, were and went to his cubby to grab:
Harry quickly summoned his DADA notes and fled down the hallway before the Minister noticed him, mind whirling, thoughts reeling.  When he entered the Great Hall and joined his friends, though, he cleared his mind and moved his attention to the bouncing conversation about the usefulness of spatial transfiguration in duels.
As soon as the Minister left Hogwarts, Harry felt the tension leak out of him, though he didn’t exactly know why he was so relaxed all of a sudden.  He just shrugged and headed to lunch with Hermione and Draco.  When Harry sat down at the Ravenclaw table, all the 7th years (and Luna) crowded around him, concerned.  When he was younger, he would have minded their nosiness, but now they were his family, and family could be nosy out of concern.
That brought out some laughter from their peers as they all continued to eat.  Professor Flitwick walked over once everyone was more or less there (except for Rebecca Dawlish, who was always late to absolutely everything).  He went down the table with a clipboard and the stack of schedules.  Professor Flitwick could have easily charmed them all to each student, but he liked to catch up with his Ravenclaws and discuss their programs.
“Today, we will be testing our Amarenovis and then going over what we did and how we can improve.  I know you did this in partners, but you will be graded and assessed individually due to the sensitive nature of Amortentia and Amarenovis.  In the meantime, you will be working on the potion written on the board.  I will be calling you individually, and you will switch potions with the person called before you when it is your turn.  This potion will be graded, so obviously, try your best.  Now, first up for Amarenovis, Terry Boot.”
Harry started from the very beginning of the day, pulling up the memory of waking up and breakfast.  He let the chill of early morning, the scent of tea, and the taste of bitter grapefruit wash over him but quickly discarded the memory, filing it in its proper place on the bookshelf, labeled with the date and contents in parselscript.  Harry recalled the next memory, Charms class, and spent time filing away each new charm and academic information he learned in their proper shelves before putting away that one too.
“But I am the older Parsssselmage, sssso you are automatically ssssubssservient to me, in a Parsssselmagic ssstandpoint. Now you have sssufficiently disssstracted me, but you will tell me why you ssssmell green applesssss, dark chocolate, massssala chai, ink, and vomit.”
“Anyway, I’m quite intrigued on why he’s coming to Hogwarts instead of having people apply like normal apprenticeships,”  Hermione said, addressing Harry and Draco in the comfort of the carriage.
“Good.  It is to both my relief and distaste that we are attending the annual ceremony for the first time this year, though I presume you will enjoy the chance to see that friend of yours, Hermione.”
"He was apologising to Voldemort.. for not being the one to resurrect him. He wanted to know how Wormtail had done it. He supports Voldemort. He was going to kill me and your father would watch without any shame or remorse. He would watch me die."
He was at Hogsmeade. Alone since Draco wouldn't come but was also whining about not having any chocolate left.
Harry stood up to leave before he decided to do something incredibly stupid such as walking to the Slytherin tables, pushing Parkinson away and snogging Draco or yelling at him for leaving. No, he needed to get out.
"Ah, Harry.. Ms. Granger just told me everything that happened.. Arthur had sent a Patronus and luckily, I wasn't away on a job." Dumbledore said.
He frowned. Had he said something wrong? Why hadn't Harry written back? Was Harry okay? Draco was filled with worry.
He thought he'd gotten far but he ran into something invisible- Draco - and they'd both fallen with a loud thud.
Draco was so enraged and so done with all the lying and everything that he didn't care, anymore. Plus it was just Blaise, he wasn't associated with any death eaters.
When they reached Hogwarts, they went to their own dormitories, none of them realising the Gryffindor scarf was still wrapped around Draco's neck along with his own scarf. Thankfully, the halls were deserted as most people were still out in Hogsmeade. The common room was also empty apart from Pansy who was smirking at him for some reason and a few first and second years who paid him no heed. However, as he reached his dorm, Blaise's eyes widened, Crabbe dropped the books he was holding, Goyle started choking on his water and Theo was staring at.. Oh shit. His scarf! Harry's scarf! He'd forgotten to give it back! Now he was the one who was wide-eyed.
Harry looked at Draco, curiously. Did it bother him that Harry's friends didn't know of their.. situation? But what would he even tell them? What were they? Were the boyfriends? Friends with benefits? What?
"I'm not really hungry.. See you later, Herms." Cormac said and left after kissing Hermione's cheek.
He had come to the library to meet Hermione. She wanted to discuss his progress on the egg. She was surprisingly not here yet and Harry was about to sit down when he saw a flash of platinum blonde hair. Malfoy.
"Ron? I'd reckoned you'd have been more excited to see your best friend after the Holidays." he said and raised his eyebrows. He really wished he could raise one eyebrow like Draco.
“Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a tray; she reckons you look underfed,” said Ron, rolling his eyes. "At any rate, you have something to tell us." he said, looking serious.
Fred and George, however, were enraged. They had sprinted at Malfoy and well eventually that had led to both twins and Harry - even though he didn't do anything, bloody Umbridge - being banned from Quidditch and their broomsticks being locked away.
"Harry, mum was- AHHH!" came Ron's voice when he saw the two of them kissing. They both bolted away from each other.
"I borrowed your cloak and snuck into the Gryffindor tower to get your uniform and bag, you complete idiot." Draco said, pointing towards Harry's things on the desk next to their bed.
"Just sit at your own table, tonight, Potter. We'll see later. Now, I have Prefect's duties." Draco said and ran off.
Harry didn't let go of Draco's hand and didn't leave the compartment throughout their ride back home. He was leaving Draco alone in that hell-hole for the entire summer..
"Believe me I know. He saw some of my worst memories.. And er.. he might have seen some.. memories of us.. Thank Merlin, he knew about us beforehand.." Harry said.
"Dobby will be making Harry Potter sir some food!" Dobby said and snapped his fingers to set a table for the two of them.
A sob escaped his throat. And another. And then, another. Soon, he was crying his heart out on Draco's shoulder.
"If I didn't know better I'd say it was Malfoy." Harry heard Ron whisper to Hermione, he was just outside the boys dormitory.
"I was only rude to the Weasel because I was jealous. How could it be that a Weasley had befriended Harry Potter and a Malfoy couldn't?"
“You see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.”
"Harry, relax! Pacing around and not eating won't bring his reply early! Now, eat.. I'm not leaving till you eat." she said, sounding like her mother.
They had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight. There was nobody there at all. All was echoing, dusty silence.
Blaise kept pestering me about how you're seeing a girl but I kept disagreeing with him. But, do you really think I'm a fool, Draco? I've known you since we were children, Draco. Who is it?" she finished.
Harry was doomed. Umbridge had surely heard that. He quickly shoved his cloak into Draco's schoolbag.
"I can't believe it! I thought you'd just get nasty looks and words but this?! People go this far for thinking you're a liar?! Who did it, Harry?"
He ran out, the tears refusing to stay in his eyes, anymore. As soon as he was in a secluded hallway, he broke down.
He lifted his head to look at Harry who was frowning. He traced the crease of his eyebrows with his hand and Harry relaxed.
"Dear Merlin, maybe I was right. He really is a barmy old wizard.. Maybe, the age has finally gotten to him?"
"Well.. I have a surprise for you. I was supposed to take you to.. it.. when I came here but as you know we got caught up in other things.." Harry said, making Draco blush.
"I do trust her.. But.. I don't know.. I mean if she knew I'm gay and never mentioned it to anyone.. Not to mention, she could help me skive off Blaise. Merlin knows to what extent he'd go to find out who I'm meeting in old dusty classrooms at midnight.
"L-let me.. go, P-Potter! Merlin, the.. the look on her.. f-face when you.. s-said.. boyfriend!" he uttered in between the laughs.
Granger had made up some ridiculous story about Dumbledore and Umbridge had believed him. They'd gone outside and Draco was still here. And his stupid housemates he'd once considered his friends were holding Harry's friends hostage. He had to do something, anything to help Harry. He looked at Pansy with pleading eyes and she nodded.
"She should know you're taken." Draco said, pulling back from Harry and admiring the mark he'd left on his neck.
"I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!" Harry panicked and blurted out, then his eyes widened as he realised he just came out to Cho of all people.
“I don’t —” Harry began. He swallowed. “In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room — that’s this one — and then I went through another door into a room that kind of . . . glitters. We should try a few doors,” he said hastily. “I’ll know the right way when I see it. C’mon.”
"And then Ron and I decided we should go to bed since only Hermione would know the properties of moonstone." Harry said and chuckled, while playing with Draco's hair.
Harry tried. He really tried but he couldn't prevent the sob from escaping his throat. And the tears from running down his cheeks.
Harry rolled his eyes and helped Draco on his own Thestral as there weren't any others.. He really didn't have any more time to waste.
"Get up, you lazy bum, you'll be late for class! Honestly! I woke you up before leaving and I'm back after taking a shower, getting dressed and having breakfast! And you're still- GET UP."
"Blaise. It is not her. Now, shut up. I'm not bound to answer any of your ridiculous questions." he said, taking off the scarf and putting it on his bed.
"This is amazing. The Hogwarts founders were great wizards! Merlin, a room that provides you with anything you require! Must've taken excellent spellwork and-"
She was interrupted by a large eagle owl that had burst into the room and flown towards Draco. He had a letter and a huge package.
"Well, what are you waiting for? Go find Harry!" he said and they all came to their senses, running out.
"Well then, let's make the most out of our last afternoon alone here before they all come back, shall we?" Harry said, climbing on the bed, settling himself on top of Draco.
So, here he was, now.. Contemplating on confronting Malfoy about the kiss and asking him to be his date. His hands were sweating and his heart was racing. He finally gathered up the courage to walk up to Malfoy.
"I.. I MEANT LITERALLY SLEEPING! JUST SLEEPING." Harry yelled at the compartment door. "Though, I wouldn't mind if there was more than sleeping." he mumbled to himself.
He wanted to cry but he wouldn't. He wouldn't cry for Draco Malfoy. The boy who had tormented him for 3 years and now had stolen his bloody heart.
"That actually hurt, you git." said Harry rubbing his lip and pulling away but Draco's hold on him was tight.
They were walking back to Hogwarts after the whole discussion with Rita Skeeter. Draco hadn't said a word to Harry since Ron and Hermione had left.
Harry flushed, again. Was Draco implying that they take a bath together? They hadn't done anything past kissing so far even when.. their bodies were very excited.. Maybe, Harry was overthinking. Draco probably just wanted to take a bath alone. Anyone could walk into the Prefects bathroom, anyway.. It's not like it's an old secluded classroom..
"I think you should.. I mean you need to choose.. I keep telling you everything and.." Harry paused to laugh humourlessly. "Well, that's not very smart of me if you're planning to stand with your parents."
Instead of telling how much he wanted Harry by words, he grabbed him by his sweater and pushed his lips onto his.
"If you didn't say that, I was just about to firecall Rita Skeeter." he joked, earning a glare from Draco.
"Well, I wanted to apologise.. For storming out of the Hospital wing like that. I was just scared.", he gave a small hysterical laugh.
"But it's not the same!" Draco whined. "We won't be alone and you Gryffindors are so bloody noisy and messy! Not to mention they all hate me."
"You seem in a good mood, today. Had a great time with the girl, yesterday?" Blaise said in an accusatory tone, making Draco choke on his bread.
"No need to thank me, Harry. If anyone wants to join the right side, who are we to stop them?" Dumbledore replied, his eyes twinkling.
"Have you finally made your choice and chosen his side, Dray? Look, I know what I said but I didn't mean you should just abandon me and your other friends if choosing Potter's your final decision.." she said, looking hurt and making Draco feel guilty.
Feeling slightly reckless, he closed his fingers around the dusty ball’s surface. Nothing happened. Then, they heard a voice he knew well.
Draco shrugged and grabbed his present. Draco's eyes widened. It was a silver snake shaped ring with a small emerald in place of the snake's and a note saying, "Happy Christmas, love."
Why did Draco have to be an idiot and keep trying to get rid of Hagrid? He gave Draco a glare and got an eyeroll in reply.
"Don't think about it so much, Harry.. You don't know the entire truth, you just saw one memory from Severus' point of view.. Now.. Come on, let me try to help you with Occlumency. I've got some books I found from the library and I did ask Severus to teach me, too.. Hopefully, he still will."
"Thank goodness, I couldn't take anymore of that.." she said and then hugged Harry. "Bye, Harry, have a happy Christmas."
"He never sleeps at this time." Ron said, pulling the curtains and letting out a shriek upon seeing Draco and Harry peacefully sleeping in each other's arms; fully naked save for the blanket that was thankfully covering the parts of their bodies Ron didn't ever want to look at.
“We’ll be in the library, Harry,” said Hermione firmly, and she seized Ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase.
Draco sighed and sat down. Images of aunt Bella escaping from Azkaban flooded his mind.. And Harry's words.. He'd have told Skeeter the names of all the death eaters.. including his father.. Maybe he does need to make his choice, soon.
"I think it was an archway between the living and the dead." Draco spoke for the first time since they'd gotten there.
"Come with me, please. Don't go to the Manor! I.. I'll talk to Dumbledore, the Order, anyone! They'll help, I promise.. Please don't go."
Harry slowly leaned in and gently pulled him into a kiss, not sure of how Draco would react but Draco responded as passionately as ever.
Snape had surprisingly gotten fed up from Draco's recent potion mishaps and paired them for that day's potion.
"Well, I had to take revenge from last night. Honestly, Harry, you're blind even with your glasses.. I'm not even in my uniform.
"And who's that?" Harry teased. "Draco Malfoy, the most dramatic git ever and the boyfriend of Harry Potter."
Draco blushed furiously. Harry had never called him anything besides his first name since they were together. And he'd just called him "baby". If it was another couple, calling each other lovey dovey pet names like baby, honey, darling.. Draco would've cringed so hard. But right now, there were butterflies in his stomach and heat on his face.
Later, when he told Ron and Hermione he'd scored an A, Hermione demanded to see his essay. The look she gave him after reading it made him squirm. He looked towards Ron who looked startled.
"If there's a problem with him being here, I'll take him to Grimmauld place." Harry said, glancing at the Weasleys.
Draco was now staring at Harry as if he was insane to be having a conversation with the crazy house-elf.
"Honestly, what is wrong with you Gryffindors? I saw another one of you exiting Umbridge's office, clutching his hand tightly.. You idiots certainly do take pleasure in pain.." Draco ranted.
"Really, Draco? I thought we were friends but I guess you think I'm also another minion of yours like Crabbe and Goyle." Blaise said, enraged.
Harry was just glad no one else was targeted like he was.  That gratefulness didn’t last the night, though, and when he was back in the Great Hall for breakfast the next morning, he was in a dreadful mood.  He picked at his omelet and couldn’t stomach more than a few slices of fruit.  A letter from Uncle Sirius and Uncle Moony brightened his temper, though. They apologized for the lateness and were appalled with the Minister’s behavior, though there was nothing they could do given their war criminal status.  Uncle Moony was especially incensed, and according to Uncle Sirius, was about to storm over to Hogwarts and
"I h-have Double Remedial Potions first thing in the morning on my A Days AND Double NEWTS Potions bright and early on my B days!!  Well, I’m afraid it’s been a good year, my friends; I’m going to check if the carriages are still outside."
These types of debates were not just common; they were expected.  Ravenclaws were constantly debating, educating themselves and others, and looking at things from new angles.  It didn’t matter what everyone’s actual opinions were. You just debated whatever you felt like and tried to win.  Despite the even number of students in their year, there was always a moderator to keep things from getting too heated.  (This was a rule imposed since Rowena’s time to stop students from hexing each other to get their points across).
That revelation complicated things quite a bit, the Minister mused.  Oh well.  Harry would have to get over it, because he was the Minister’s now, and the Minister didn’t care for silly notions like
The Minister recalled every person he had killed for his Horcruxes (Myrtle Warren, Tom Riddle Sr., Hepzibah Smith, Mcauley O'Brien, Eliyas Woodley, Bertha Jorkins) and he rarely killed outside of them.  He had only ever killed three people for non-Horcrux reasons.  Tom Riddle Sr.’s parents were two of them, and that was for revenge.  But there was a final woman he had killed.  Lily Evans.  Her death had been a tragedy, but she had discovered the Ravenclaw Diadem and figured out what it was (but not for whom), so, regretfully, he killed her in her own home.  The stupid woman had thought she was here for the baby and had practically thrown herself in front of his wand.
He was jerked out of his thoughts by Hermione exclaiming, "Merlin, Harry, I forgot that the Minister was coming to this feast.  I just remembered cause I heard Greengrass and Parkinson talking about it.”
The next step was far easier: setting up the white candles. Harry cast extremely overpowered sticking charms, so the magic spilled over, tacky and gummy like glue paste, and set the candles at the vertices.
He must not have hidden it well enough because Draco grabbed his hand under the table, his thumb rubbing soothing circles on the back of his hand.  They weren't together or anything like that (though that might change if Harry had something to do with it). Harry was just a tactile person.  It took Draco some time to get used to the frequent hugs and warm touches, but now he found himself looking for subtle contact and physical comfort.  Hermione didn’t mind as much because she was a touch-oriented person too.
They hugged and then went their separate ways, Harry walking with Lavender, Hermione with Nott, who always walked her to Runes.  Harry chatted with Lavender about their essays and what they had so far, sources, outlines, and the like, until they got to Alchemy, where they joined Padma and Pavarti and changed the subject to something more inclusive.  They all gossiped till Master Brewer Fleming strode in and began to lecture.  The class took notes for the first 100 minutes, and the next 100 minutes were focused on brainstorming for their whole year research project (there were an absurd amount of research projects this year, now that Harry was thinking about it).  Harry really wasn't sure what he wanted to do and still had no concrete idea by the end of class, so that was his homework.
Lunch was yet more mayhem, so Harry skipped it entirely and hung out in the library until it was time for Transfiguration.  He finished some of the Charms homework and felt quite accomplished when he walked into Professor McGonagall’s class.  Harry’s good mood was dashed by the magically taxing subject they were practicing: human to stone to human transfiguration.  He wasn’t the only one who had trouble with the subject since Helen Dawlish, Gregory Goyle, Hannah Abbot, and Vincent Crabbe all had to be sent to the Hospital Wing.  The whole mess of the Diadem hadn’t died down by dinner, and it didn’t die down until the weekend when a much more juicy topic was unearthed.  Aaron Woodbridge, a 7th year Ravenclaw, and Astoria Greengrass, a 6th year Slytherin were outed as having a pixie dust and blue genie elixir (along with other drugs) smuggling rings, bringing great shame to their families.
The Minister’s red eyes narrowed when he tried probing at Harry’s mental walls and found them stronger than before.
The Minister didn’t seem like he had caught on to Harry’s acting, and he was getting overconfident.  Harry inwardly smirked as the Minister started casting slower, using less impressive spells, and abandoned his shield.  After the Minister cast one last spell, Harry felt that he had learned enough and shifted onto offense.  He conjured a sand storm, and in the time it took the Minister to banish it, Harry was already shooting off spell after spell.  The Minister seemed shocked at Harry’s viciousness and attempted to gain ground.  He growled and tried to intimidate Harry by shooting off lethal spells, but Harry wasn’t fazed.
Harry drifted in, and out of sleep, shapeless dreams floating around his head; yelling here, blurry shapes there; a clear face of whom exactly, he couldn't say, and horses bounded across his room.  He slept restlessly, plagued by dreams as he was, so when Harry woke up, it was as if he hadn’t gone to bed at all.  Harry groaned and rubbed his eyes viciously till he saw yellowy honeycombs behind his eyelids.
Harry danced with people he knew and people he had never met before -- not even in a passing encounter.  It was truly a night to remember, and oh how Harry felt rejuvenated.  But more than that, he felt connected, one with the other wixen in a way he had never felt before.  Their magics were all intertwined and pulsed together with a singular heartbeat, all connected under Mother Magic.  Flushed and sweaty from the magical exertion, Harry let out a slow, measured exhale, letting his aching cheeks rest, and reveled in the ever-present, all-consuming
Harry took Tom’s advice and changed for bed.  He knew that he wouldn’t be up for dinner (a sort of bone-deep exhaustion was clinging onto his body from all the magical usage), so Harry just spelled on his pajamas and fell right asleep.
Harry didn’t know much about his housemates' projects, just enough to know what he shouldn’t do for his. He knew a little more about Hermione and Draco’s, but it was mostly cursory information rather than actual explanations. And anyway, it didn’t matter because Harry was much more focused on his own project: predicting chaos. In his youth, he had formed a fascination with predicting everything (hence why he took Arithmancy and Divination), and that had snowballed into a near obsession in predicting chaos. There were plenty of muggle studies on that sort of thing, but Harry wanted to know the true way to predict chaos, and that is why he needed to get scouted to become an Unspeakable. Being an Unspeakable would allow him to study chaos and eventually learn to predict it.
It wasn’t alright at first, with Draco being all snobbish about Hermione’s status as a muggle-born and her home at Merope’s Home for Mundane-Borns, but they eventually made a close friendship that Harry wouldn’t change for the world.
Harry immediately went on defensive as the Minister sent a flurry of spells, all of them a bright, sickly yellow.  When fighting an unknown opponent, Harry always went on defensive to see which spells they relied on, how they moved, and any other information he could catalog on them.  He used the Minister’s skill and his initial nervousness to hide that he was collecting data.  Sure, he had been scared, but now he was in his element.  Harry knew he had enough skill to come out of this reasonably unscathed, even if he lost.
Thankfully, the Minister kept his promise, and Harry spent the rest of the day and the subsequent weekend blessedly Minister-free. He caught up on all his work, finished his assignments, studied ahead, and finally, finally, got started on his house project. Each house had a final project that students had to create to showcase their talents and skills: Hufflepuffs did service projects, Slytherins had ‘if I had to change the world’ proposals, Gryffindors did impossible tasks from a list (ranging from retrieving three fae fruits to finding Atlantis), and Ravenclaws did research projects.
you cast with inner magic and emotion, making it a Dark Spell.  Now, Ms. Greengrass, can you tell us the incantation for the
Harry measured out 2 mL of peppermint oil and waited for the water to boil before pouring it into the cauldron. He crushed the sunstone, one gram at a time, while Hermione added each one, stirring clockwise four times between.
green orb began to glow, shocking the nearest Unspeakable.  Oh Mother Magic and Morgana, the Unspeakable thought.  This is quite bad.  This is very, very bad.  The Minister must never learn of this.
While Susan’s charms work was outstanding, it was clear she was fighting a losing battle as Harry’s dueling ability came into play.  He made no mind of Professor Flitwick’s narration and began to cast verbal spells quickly and harshly.
But Harry was getting ahead of himself, so instead of musing what it would be like as an Unspeakable, Harry spent six hours researching alongside his fellow 7th years on his Novo Novus Showcase project. They didn’t talk the whole time, but there was a sense of companionship, and it was nice to research next to all his friends, with the only sounds being quills scratching and pages turning.
I also thought I’d let you know that if you notice any mistakes and discrepancies, please let me know (nicely) as I’m only a high school sophomore doing this in my free time without a beta, except for Grammarly which is a lifesaver.
Harry was glad he could start the magical cycle for the first time and was looking forward to celebrating Ostara and Imbolc with his peers, especially.  He and other children of war criminals had been barred from all non-ancestral calendar rites, so Harry had never liked to think of the mid-September day where all his classmates were gone (with the exception of Neville Longbottom and few others) to celebrate Mabon, among others.  Mabon was actually the hardest because the Potter family didn’t observe it ancestrally, so it was just a glaring date Harry did his best to ignore.
Poppy was an older elf, shriveled with age, and wasn’t a fan of the new policies that required payment and off days for house-elves (years of being told you were nothing weren’t erased in a matter of minutes, especially not in a home as traditional as Father ruled). So he drank the last dregs of his mimosa to wash down the papaya and gather his courage.  Harry was no Gryffindor, but he wasn’t a coward when it came to those he cared about.
The Latin and Punjabi (sorry about the wrong script, by the way) mean the same thing as the English, and I used them because the British language of magic is Latin, and the Potters are Punjabi in this fic.
“That was one of the best duels I have ever seen; you truly have the gift of dueling,”  said Professor Flitwick.
Professor Flitwick then summoned all the essays with a flick of his wand and banished the chairs and desks in another, leaving an empty classroom perfect for dueling.
They exchanged charm after charm, sweat dripping down their foreheads, lungs pumping.  They circled each other and resorted to physical dodges and evasions.  Harry ran circles around Susan, but she caught on quickly and learned to predict where he would go.  After a few close calls, he went back to standing in place.  Flashes of every color under the sun went off, and reinforced shields were repeatedly dismissed and recalled.  The class waited with bated breath for who would win.
themselves were moved to a new book on his charms shelf.  By the time that was done, Harry had entirely left his body and was in his happy-fuzzy-not-entirely-aware headspace when not focused on his maze-library-mind space.  It took little effort to bring forth memories, but it would take insurmountable exertion to move his body without damaging his mind, which was why it was so important to not be in a vulnerable space.
Though he was happy and content, Harry couldn't help but feel uncomfortable as he felt a gaze on him.  While he was accustomed to people staring at him (he knew he had a sort of elfin sort of beauty that lent itself to many a crush), this felt different, more predatory.  His instincts proved right when Hermione hissed, “Don’t look now, but Minister Peverell is staring at you, Harry, it’s really creepy.”
Professor Black thanked him, and Harry took his seat, ignoring the Thoth-damned Minister’s heavy gaze. There were 10 minutes left in class, and Harry was praying that class passed without incident, but of course, it didn’t as the Minister decided to materialize and walk over to the front of the class, where Harry was sat.
“Cousin Harry!” Little Cousin Aquila screeched out, forgoing etiquette when she ran up to him in a flurry of wild hair and white linen.  Harry laughed and picked her up, spinning her around, Little Cousin Aquila squealing in delight.  When he set her down, Cousin Rhodesia, Uncle Sirius, and Uncle Moony all looked at the both of them with similar, kind fondness (though Uncle Sirus’ had a tinge of grief).  Cousin Ingram was apathetic as always, and Father’s face was pinched, though it was nothing to worry about -- he was always annoyed when he saw little children, even his own relatives.
Harry chuckled -- that was such a Hermione thing to say, so he just smiled and started writing his fifteen inches on the uses of purpura brassica.  Hermione worked on their other assignment (the long, six-sheave essay on the magical differences between Amortentia and Amarenovis).  There were only 10 minutes left of class, so they only finished their outlines, but it did give them both something to focus on, so by the time they exited the class, their minds were ready to focus on their next classes: Alchemy for Harry, Runes for Hermione.
A Gryffindor, Sophie Roper, raised her hand confidently. Professor Black nodded at her, and she came forward to sniff at a vial. She said, “I smell salted caramel, limes, and dung bombs.”
Everybody laughed, and Hermione replied after swallowing a bite of scrambled eggs, "I think it's inevitable that you’ll have Double Potions if you want to be a healer.  And, you know how Professor Black feels about having his NEWTS class early in the morning."
The instrument I reference (criyer) is an instrument I made up, and it's a wind instrument similar to a piccolo, and it's magically enhanced so it sounds like bird cries.
and from the tip of his wand, a nimble, silvery impala galloped over to join Hermione’s magpie and Draco’s hound.  The rest of the students had managed a shield and were told to practice till they could cast it for Thursday.
Harry closed the diary with a smile like he usually did.  Sure, he had terrific friends, but Tom was different.  Draco was nice, but Harry was much too interested in getting in his pants for him to be family (unless they married), Hermione was a girl, and while Harry loved her, they didn’t wholly understand each other. The other male Ravenclaws weren’t close enough to be family.  So, enter Tom, the brother he never had.
Content warning for verbal/emotional abuse, James Potter bashing, and the general icky feelings of going home to an abusive parent to mourn your other parent who is dead. It isn't explicit or anything though.
The Minister fell into a chair Harry quickly conjured and nearly roared in rage.  Harry ended the illusion spell and pointed his wand at the Minister from a safe distance.
When the chanting was over and magic swam all throughout the plaza, adults began to pluck marigolds and such from the garlands floating about.  “Here,” they all said, handing them to the smaller children, blessing the flowers as they traded palms.  “Set them in the fire,” was said next, and each person, child or not, tossed them into the bonfires.  Curlicues of scented smoke rose up as the petals turned to ash, and more flowers fed the fire.
He looked stunning, to be sure, but there was an undercurrent of misery Harry tried his best to wipe away, to no avail.  Oh, that wouldn't do.  He closed his eyes tightly and breathed in and out to counts of three.  Harry peeked out and smiled, satisfied.  Now that was someone who looked happy -- it wouldn’t be seemly to be seen as anything else.
As the trio approached the door, James swung them open, gesturing broadly, with a plasticky smile everyone could tell was false.
Then, abruptly, food appeared.  Merlin, he must have really been lost in thought to be this startled, but he shook off that thought and began to eat.  He chatted with Hermione, Draco, and the rest of his year mates, excited to have all his friends in one group after a particularly draining summer.  Uncle Moony had gotten promoted and was the new head of the Dark Creatures Department--James had taken that as a betrayal and had been wasting away with Harry as his only caretaker.
"Hello Harry, your wrackspurts are smaller than usual, but your midaleus is angry at being locked up.”  A dreamy voice noted, already seated at the table.
Harry had six minutes for the next step, so he quickly but carefully poured six grams of the dragon fruit gnats into the mortar and crushed them into a fine powder.  He then waited for the last two minutes and then turned on the hot flame and unceremoniously dumped the dragon fruit gnat powder into the cauldron.  Harry turned the flame back to low and waited for 12 minutes.  While he waited, Harry looked around the room and noticed that Finch-Fletchley was in the room, and Lavender looked more than a little queasy.
At that, Terry walked over to Professor Black’s office, where a ministry official -- Madame Spinstra, the only person legally allowed to touch Amortentia -- was waiting.
I'm going to try and get the next chapter up quickly, but I make no promises.  And, as always, thank you so, so much for reading!!
Harry sighed.  He was getting maudlin, and there was still the issue of Tom and the Minister’s magic.  Were they related somehow?  Or was there something darker at play?  He was sure there was. He just hoped he wouldn’t lose Tom.  He groaned and tossed his glasses haphazardly towards his nightstand (he didn’t worry too much since he had a catching charm on the furniture), set the diary under his pillow, laid his head down, and promptly fell asleep, forgetting the day’s troubles.
“Don’t thank me; it shouldn’t have happened in the first place.”  Professor Flitwick noted absentmindedly while writing the note.
He tried to corner the boy’s magic, but it quickly found a gap and slipped past before his magic could absorb it. Harry gathered the threads of his magic, trying to bring it back to his body, but he was too panicked to do it properly.  The Minister snuffed the candles hoping to confuse this other magic, but it was wily and slicker than oil. The useless children screamed, distracting the Minister. That was enough time for Harry to calm down and pull all his magic back in.
-- it wouldn’t do to be late after all -- and got up, sliding his mask on and tying a braided, tri-color rope around his waist.  When Harry got down to the foyer, Father, Little Cousin Aquila, Cousin Rhodesia, Cousin Ingram, Uncle Moony, and Uncle Sirius were all waiting, making awkward conversation.
Hermione and Draco both knew that there would only be one victor in this deadly dance between Harry and the Minister and that Harry was not the one dangerously underestimating his opponent. While they were initially worried, given that the Minister was a very powerful, very violent man, they weren’t as much anymore; Harry was not a being to be trifled with. He may have been complacent to let the Minister walk all over him for a few days in hopes he’d move on and find another obsession, but his power plays? His blatant perversion and disruption of his learning? The Minister’s general disregard and the false sense of ownership? Harry was not going to roll over and show his belly.
Eventually, they all had to head to their classes, so they said their goodbyes and went their separate ways; Harry with Hermione, Maisy, Anthony, and Terry.  Harry prayed to Mother Magic, Morgana, and all the powers above that the Minister wasn’t going to be in his Potions class - just this once.  Alas, his prayers were left unanswered, and the Minister was sitting on one of the observing benches, scrawling away with a quill.  Harry audibly groaned, and Maisy patted his shoulder in commiseration, but they had class, so they focused on Professor Black, who was writing instructions on the blackboard.  Once everyone was seated at each of the tables -- individually in this class -- Professor Black greeted them.
His white linen undergarments were first, so he stripped to his trousers and stood there, shivering, as his father looked on impassively, and Topsy did her best to work quickly.  After that, cornflower blue fabric draped over his lithe frame, wrapping snugly to his body in some places and flowing gracefully in others.  His Potter robes were arranged as Topsy sewed them, a deep v showcasing his embroidered chemise and crimson accents contrasting the soft blue of the Potter crest.
Daphne wasn’t seen the whole weekend and the following Monday and Tuesday, and Pansy, the notorious gossip that she was, refused to talk about it.  News still spread, of course, and as the names of their associates were leaked, the severity of the situation grew.  In raids looking at the friends of the two already caught, Romilda Vane, a 6th year Gryffindor was caught trying to dispose of Amortentia ingredients with her friend Leanne Maxwell, and Morsen Johnson, a 5th year Hufflepuff was caught with three kilos of tobacco-grade Alihotsy and a sack of Galleons.  All five of them were looking at three years in Sential Prison at minimum, and two years in Azkaban at maximum.
Harry cast charm after charm, all in a quick succession that had Susan backing up and reinforcing her
James is meant to be a perfectionist sort of father, and his normal state is just cruel and emotionally abusive, but his bad days, which you might remember from the legilimency chapters, are really bad.  I didn't show that because I don't want to, and also, I feel like showing him the way I did is more realistic and more impactful.  Likewise, it fits better with how Harry acts.
The minister watched the room with unfathomable dark eyes throughout the whole feast, purveying all the 6th and 7th years.  Promising candidates, all of them, but especially that one male Ravenclaw with messy black hair.  He was familiar, somehow.  Harry, of course, didn’t notice the eyes watching him like a hawk (Draco was not oblivious and was very worried about how interested the Dark Lord was in Harry).
The Minister let out a raspy, sibilant ki-ki-ki, and it took the class a few seconds to realize that the Minister was laughing.
kissed, but they hesitated long enough that the moment passed, and they pushed it out of their minds and switched partners.
The three of them entered the classroom and scanned the room for the Minister.  They didn’t notice anything at first, but Padma discretely pointed out the warped shadows in the front right corner, and they took seats as far away from him as possible.  Professor Flitwick was sitting at his desk, and he greeted them with a smile, acting remarkably calm, given the concealed Dark Lord right next to him.  Harry, Cho, and Padma just smiled and waved before going over their notes as the rest of their classmates trickled in. It was a mixed house class as there were only two NEWTS Charms.
Harry silently stood in the doorway and watched as a massive three-headed serpent slithered out of the man’s wand.  He smothered a gasp, and his eyes widened.  To have a runespoor as
written on it in blocky letters and the surprisingly visible Dark Lord in the back corner writing something on a long parchment.  Harry sighed and dropped his forehead on Hermione’s shoulder.  Draco just patted his head sympathetically and led them to a seat in the front of the classroom.
The trio was a few minutes late, so Professor Escrivá just raised a pencil-thin eyebrow, and Harry bashfully handed her the note from Professor Flitwick.  She let out an infinitesimal gasp, and her eyes widened.  Professor Escrivá then looked back up and waved them off, telling them to find seats and start taking notes.
Yesterday had been quite exhausting emotionally, physically, and magically, so it was no surprise that Harry slept like the dead, and barely woke up in time for breakfast the next morning.  He did, though, which was the important part.  And, he woke up just in time -- and refreshed enough -- to cause absolute chaos.  He did so, by quickly getting ready for the day, and shoving Rowena Ravenclaw’s Diadem that hadn’t been seen in centuries into his school bag.  Harry then proceeded to get to breakfast, sit down right next to Luna, and place the Diadem on Luna’s head, right next to her massive Queen Alexandra butterfly hairpins.
.  Perhaps it was psycho symptomatic, but Harry could taste the magic hanging damp and heavy in the air.
Harry retrieved a sharp iron blade from a hidden pocket in his satchel and grabbed the glass bowl he had stashed in there as well. Chanting, “
Soon enough, lunch was over and Harry, shielded by his friends who had Transfiguration with him (Terry, Sue, Helen, and Ophelia).  He had never been so grateful for the Head of House for Gryffindor, Professor McGonagall, as he was in the class period.  Her no-nonsense way of teaching made it so that Harry wasn’t bothered the whole time.  They were currently doing self-transfiguration, so everyone needed to focus.  It also helped that even the Minister was afraid of her, so he didn’t bother coming into her classroom.
and dismissed the class 25 minutes early.  Harry didn’t get up, and he waved away Padma and Cho in favor of letting his head rest against the cold brick.
Harry explained what had happened, going into near excruciating detail about the duel. Still, he knew his Ravenclaws wouldn’t be satisfied with a run-down, so he continued to go over spell after spell, minute by minute, till he finished.  They all looked stunned and started fussing over him.
“Pair up to work on gravitational charms,” Professor Flitwick said to the whole class, voice amplified by a
Harry talks to Tom!  Everyone is terrified of the Minister!  What on earth is going on?? This was a fun chapter to write because I love the dynamic between Harry and Tom.  I hope you enjoy it!
Also, I'm blown away by all of the hits and kudos' I have gotten in such a short time.  Thank you so much!!!
Both his emotions and his thoughts, memories, and information had to be put somewhere in his mindscape. While the idea of a library came immediately, Harry took longer to figure out what to do with his emotions.  He disliked the idea of keeping them in the same place, so Harry bounced between idea and idea on where to place his emotions.  He stumbled upon the idea of putting his emotions in a tapestry when Hermione talked about how sewing and other art projects helped calm her down, and Draco agreed, talking about his needlepoint with his mother and how it always soothed him and provided structure.  Potter Manor was decorated with tapestry after tapestry, so it wasn’t hard to make the leap and put two and two together.
Susan’s brow furrowed, and she double-layered her shield and quickly sent the spells back to Harry.  Instead of casting a shield, he dodged the charms and encased them with a
That didn’t show in his voice when he said, “I believe I am, though, from my understanding, you are not one of her victims.”
Harry put all the excess ingredients back in their storage cubbies, making sure to put them next to non-reactive ingredients and that all of it was inside the container. Simultaneously, Hermione methodically scrubbed the work table with a cloth imbued with a tumus bene. She scoured the cauldron, table, knives, and other utensils. When Harry got back, they both got out their notebooks to check the assignment. Pulling out parchment, quills, and ink, they outlined their 6-sheave essay since they didn’t have enough time to write the whole paper.
turned out to be a graceful swan; Lavender’s a flitting kingfisher, Blaise’s a spotted hyena, Greengrass’ an intimidating polar bear, Dunbar’s an ambling fox, and Weasley’s a terrier dog of some sort.  Right before class ended, Harry called out, “
If he had taken a step back and taken a breath, he would have realized he was acting irrationally; he didn’t even know the boy.  It was quite strange to be so entranced by this little twig of a 17-year-old after knowing of him for barely a day, even if Harry was very powerful.  But the Minister was not one for introspection, so he continued to rage and rant, uncaring of the frightened students in their classrooms, feeling the very foundation of the castle shake.  Nor did he care about the hysterical boy in the infirmary, his equally terrified friends trying to calm him down.
Harry brushed his hair and teeth, put on his school uniform, tied his tie, and meditated for 30 minutes before putting on his socks and shoes. Ever since he had gotten competent in occluding some odd four years ago, he had stopped meditating every morning, but now that he had to rebuild them, it looked like he was going to pick up the habit again.
His two friends nodded their agreement, the conversation coming to a close as they arrived at Hogwarts.  The view never ceased to amazed Harry, even after all these years.  He let his magic stretch out, expanding and contorting in the air as they made their way inside towards the Ravenclaw table.  It was very rare that he could do this, but Professor Flitwick, his Head of House, theorized that it was because he was so powerful and so small.  He didn’t take offense at that, even though he very well could have.  It was well known to those close to him that he was malnourished as a child and would likely never grow taller than his current 5’7”.  Harry didn’t mind overly about his height, though; he was the perfect height for Draco to put his chin on his head and the ideal size for a cuddle with Hermione.
We're 3/4 of the way through the Facetious Arc!! (Remember when this was supposed to only be 1 chapter skdfsdjnk)
“I’m fine. I’m fine. I’m fine.”  He repeated over and over as Draco cast all the detection spells he knew.  After Draco finished, his worries assuaged, Hermione, bundled them both up in a hug, slotting together like Matryoshka dolls.
They lit up their work table button that let Professor Black know they were finished without disturbing their other classmates. Professor Black strode over and looked impressed by their results. He complimented their potion quietly, took several samples, and vanished the rest. Professor Black then told them to clear off their work table, decontaminate, and start on the assignment he had written in their notebooks.
At least he had a day to mentally prepare before he had to face the Minister.  He looked to his friends taking Care and Astronomy (unless you had the sight, you couldn’t take NEWTS Divination, and Luna wasn’t in her NEWTS year yet) and exchanged anxious, sympathetic looks.  Whatever the Minister was up to wasn’t going to go well for anyone.
Hi!! So fair warning, there's mild blood and major creepiness from our favorite Minister.  This chapter is a lot shorter than the previous one, but it came to a natural close.
Like with the Amarenovis, I did make up the Pellisseato potion, so please use it if you want, and tag me if you'd like (I just want to see your cool works :P).
Harry sighed and sat back up, shucking off his blankets - it looked like he would have to file everything manually, so that’s what he did.  He went through memory after memory, cataloging, filing, and shelving each piece of information.  Harry wove his emotions of the day (icy, cold, blue fear, maroon shame, chestnut brown fondness, lime green satisfaction) into the tapestry, and took a step back, really looking at his emotions.  It was a marvelous piece of fabric, stretching eons, rippling with magic, the loom moving by itself, weaving spools of thousands of different colors.  Blues, purples, reds, and greens overtook the tapestry with threads of rose gold love and deep, charcoal black hatred forming geometric patterns throughout.
Lavender cleared her throat before saying, “Amarenovis has two main uses; the more common one is as an antidote to Amortentia, but if one uses a bloodstone rather than a sunstone, any feeling of romantic love can be erased. An overdose of Amarenovis makes it so the victim can never love again, romantically, platonically, or otherwise. It looks like onyx and smells exactly like Amortensia, but with an added scent of what you most hate.”
Harry let out a dramatic gasp followed along with smothered giggles, "A f-field mouse?! I know where you sleep, don't forget that."
After which, there were several more calls and responses, each in Latin and each welcoming Mother Magic and her blessings into space.  Though Harry knew some people still held doubts about the old ways (he vividly remembered when Lisa said her Mother would rant and rave about the heathenous rituals), he didn’t know how it was possible when during rituals he felt so
After, the rites would then begin.  It would follow much the same as the familial rites, but more generalized and entirely in Latin.  Harry was quite glad he was competent enough in Latin (like all wixen as they were required to take a Latin class first through the third year no matter the school they attended) to call and respond, for he didn't know the phrases intimately, like many others.  There would be buckets of live coals and ashes, marigolds and carnations, and a raucous celebration composed of dancing and music where they danced through the bonfire, cooling charms on their lower halves.  The more Harry thought about it, the more excited he got (it also helped the longer he was up, the less tired he was).
He just smiled affectionately and let Padma, Sue, and Cho fill his plate with doi maach, white rice, and dhokar dalna.  He may not like his father, but he certainly appreciated their heritage and the gifts it gave him, namely parseltongue.  Harry sipped masala chai and let Anthony and Terry grill him over the spells he used and how he could improve, listening attentively and bemusedly.
Their letter did much to lift his spirits during breakfast, but when he walked to his Double Charms with Padma and Cho, his mood soured, and his expression went stony.  They didn’t try to make him feel better, which he appreciated; they just quietly talked about the usage of charms in duels and which ones they thought were most useful.
The hat finished, and soon enough, the sorting started, prefects, standing next to the first year sides of the table to help them get settled.
Back inside, Harry noticed that Cousin Rhodesia had left, and a nervous Billa informed him that Father was napping and he, “Best be resting as well,” so Harry smiled and agreed, heading to his room.  He stripped and fell straight into bed, barely staying awake long enough to set an alarm.
.  He had 30 minutes to get to the Great Hall, so he reluctantly left his cocoon of blankets and got ready for the day.
At that moment, making eye contact with the Minister’s dark red eyes, Harry vowed to do whatever it took to take down that man in front of him. Whatever it took. (If a green orb in the Hall of Prophecies glowed even brighter at that thought, well, Unspeakable Larkspur wasn’t going to tell anyone).
(not angry, irritated, mad, frustrated), the Minister looked worried.  Professor Black stepped forwards and began to soothe Harry.  He said, “Harry, I need you to calm down for me; I understand that you have had a bad experience with Amortentia, but all of us are legally mandated to not take advantage of you, and if you really can’t do it -- Ms. Granger couldn’t, and neither could Mr. Malfoy -- I perfectly understand, and I will just grade based on the physical characteristics.”
said quite a bit about the caster, and Harry didn’t know if he really wanted to think about what it meant as a representation of the Minister’s soul.  (Though, Harry couldn’t help but recall that runespoors represented ambition, creativity, and vice.  It meant that while the Minister was powerful and thoughtful and intelligent, his blind sightedness and dislike of criticism or you know, his conscious, would be his downfall.)
Neville looks down at her, and this time she's certain. Certain that the interest she sees in his eyes goes beyond what should be considered appropriate. She can feel him beginning to speak even before he does, because the deep intonation hits her chest before his words hit her ears.
Narcissa's hands curl into fists at her side. "I am no Malfoy. You knew my nature when you bought my Black blood, like you bought my lineage and my fortune. It's too late for either of us to regret our choices."
Potter snorted out through his nose, releasing a grunted sigh, but made no move to bite. Draco swallowed, steeling his courage, and tightened his grip on Potter’s hair. He pushed, forcing Potter’s face into his skin.
“No,” she sniffed. “I have no doubt that so far he’s lived up to his end of the contract. You look better already. He’ll be good to you, and if you have any feeling of mercy left in you, which I think you do, you’ll return the favor. Be good to him, Harry. He’s the only one who can give you everything you need.”
Harry has to swallow back the lump in his throat. "Thanks, mate. That means a lot. You don't know how much. You're family, and Draco is important to me. I just want you all to get along without it being difficult."
“Andromeda and Bellatrix,” Draco supplied. “Long before anything, I think.” He sucked in a breath. “God, she looks happy. And Aunt Bella…she looks positively—”
"And you required this for tonight?" Draco swallows hard and Harry watches the long line of his throat. He's ready to put his lips and teeth on Draco's skin. He's ready to leave all sorts of marks behind.
Draco’s fork fell from his hand and clattered to the plate, causing Potter to swear and jump to his feet. The blood rushed from his face and he felt his heart drop into his stomach. He glanced down and picked up the fork. “Sorry. It-it slipped.”
It was obvious this was the only step Potter was going to take. Perhaps it was the only one he knew how to take. So, Draco decided he would pave the way. This time.
Harry watches her glide from the room, silk skirts swishing as she goes, before turning his attention to Malfoy. His mouth is indeed hanging open on a slight gape, and his expression is one of complete bewilderment. His eyes settle on Harry as he blows out a soft breath.
The moment Harry spies the trajectory of Ron's wand, he places himself in front of Draco. "Have you lost your mind? Put your wand away!"
Harry twists his fingers and batters at Draco's arse as he bears his weight on Draco once more. He knows there is nothing in Draco's field of vision but his face, nothing Draco's body can register but Harry. His weight, his scent, his taste. He is the only thing Draco can fathom at the moment. And it's right where Harry wants him.
"Coward?" Potter's voice held a deadly bite, and he stiffened, leaning forward as if to advance. Something stayed his feet, because he stood his ground, glaring at Draco. His lips pulled back to reveal the sharp points of his fangs. "How dare you—"
“On the contrary, the conversation she and I enjoyed was littered with ‘Grangers’ and ‘Malfoys’.” Draco shrugged. “It was all very nostalgic. Until she dropped this in my lap.”
Draco rocks against Harry's mouth as his legs shake to keep him upright. Harry feels his body flexing to maintain the posture.
"Day before yesterday, I think." Draco's face pinched. "It's not the letter. Potter needs to eat." The statement crossed Draco's lips as a matter of fact, yet Snape heard the underlying tone.
"Good," Harry purrs, and he can see the ripple in Draco's shoulders at the low praise. "Like that—slowly."
"I respected him for your mother," Potter said smoothly, and the weight of the statement made Draco feel a little guilty for not thinking of that himself. By her own hand, she had revealed how much Potter had meant to her. "And for you," he finished. "I came because I knew Narcissa would have wanted you there by her side, and since that wasn't possible, I came in your stead. I was a poor stand-in, I'm sure, but I think she appreciated it all the same." He smiled wistfully. "She hugged me. In front of the officiant and Kingsley Shacklebolt."
Ron slumped down into his chair on a huffed breath. “He-he just needs some time, that’s all. Just give him some more time to adjust-he’ll come round,” Ron’s voice choked on a sob. “He will.”
Harry's lips purse. "Aftercare is not an option. You have put yourself in my hands, and I am responsible for you. I have a duty of care toward to you that I take very seriously. It is an honorable obligation and an essential part of this relationship for me. I want to take care of you. In all the ways that I can. Aftercare is necessary because it gives me a way to assess your physical and mental health after a scene. It lets me know what I've done right, and what I need to work on. If I'm pushing you too hard, or—" Harry's tongue flicks out over his lips, "not hard enough. It creates closeness and cements the bond that will form between us." He steps closer, entreating Draco with a soft look. "Will you let me care for you?"
Pansy's grin is wide and self-effacing. "I'm an alcoholic." She drains the last of her pumpkin juice. "But I could do with a refill."
Harry’s stomach dropped.  That was his schedule, mocking him in black letters.  Divination, Double Astronomy, and Care today, but today was his self-study day.  What he was more worried about was the Double Charms, DADA, and Transfiguration tomorrow and the Potions, Double Alchemy, and Advanced Arithmancy on Friday.  Hermione and Draco both looked vaguely nauseous as they came to the same conclusion as Harry.
“Darling, you’re spacing out again,”  Draco said, silky voice tiptoeing the line between friendly and outright flirtatious.
He took a deep breath and pulled out his biggest secret.  It didn’t look like much, but the plain black journal with a gold embossed name that he had found in the middle of his second year (he had pilfered it from the youngest Weasley when his magic called to it) on it was something he
So Harry crossed each day off the calendar and lit candles for patience and good luck.  Class, after class, after class; three, two, one.
Standing at the gates of Potter Manor, Harry took a sharp breath in, and on the exhale, pushed open the wrought iron door, letting the familiar copper magic bathe him in a wash of rust and citrus.  It should be comforting, but Potter Manor had never felt like home.
slithered out of the memory’s wand.  Then his eyes narrowed as he realized what exactly the silvery blue, serpentine being was: a runespoor.
They kept going back and forth, beads of sweat forming, as the rest of their peers won or lost their respective duels, and began to watch Susan and Harry’s duel.  Susan was unparalleled in charms work, but Harry had the advantage of being a much better duelist, so they were more or less equally matched, and it was showing.
The doc with all the chapters is over 100 pages and my notes doc (that has a list of the characters, the general outline, and a bunch of other stuff) is almost 20. And we're not even 10 chapters in :0
Michael was still sleeping, so Harry shouldered the task of waking up Terry. It took three alarm clock charms, an
People gave Harry anxious looks throughout breakfast, but he paid them no mind and conversed with his friends instead, gleaning what had happened the past two days from them.  He tried his best to push all thoughts of the Minister out of his mind, but he wasn’t very successful.  Thank Merlin today was his self-study day.
I used pinewood for the buckets/bowls because they represent life and chrysanthemums because they symbolize remembrance. (I was thinking about using carnations too, but I think chrysanthemums tear better lmao).
And then, with the piercing note of a criyer, people began to dance.  At first glance, there was no rhyme or rhythm to the dancing, but as people found their tempo, pulling partners and children and cousins and aunts and uncles into dance, the plaza began to move in time.  A jaunty tune everyone knew played, and though there was no leading singer, everyone began to sing along, laughing and touching and being
Day after day passed by, Charms, Potions, DADA, Alchemy, Transfiguration, Arithmancy, one after another.  Assignment, after assignment, spell after spell.  Harry went through sheaves of parchment and dozens of quills as the school year progressed.  He couldn’t wait till the next break -- yet he also dreaded it with every fiber of his being, because Harry knew he would be expected back home.  For the next break was Samhain.  Day of remembrance.   Day of the dead.
is used as a defense against Dark Creatures such as Dementors and Lethifolds, so it would fall under learning about the Dark Arts.”
Harry stepped in, and the door slammed shut behind him.  He willed himself not to flinch and made indirect eye contact with James.
Harry let out a sigh of relief at the correctness and perfect timing because an embarrassed Chandan Moreau (a Slytherin who Harry had hooked up with at the end of last year, though Chandan was probably more embarrassed about the Amortentia incident than Harry’s blow job) was waiting for him.  Harry smiled gratefully at Chandan and walked over to the room, feeling like he was walking to his execution.
After quite some time on the path, he led Turnip back into the open fields and threw her into a canter.  She whinnied with excitement, and her strides lengthened till she was all but flying.  Harry let out a whoop of joy, laughing as he pressed flush against Turnip’s neck.  Harry was going to regret riding so hard, but he could always put on a balm and sleep it off -- he had magic, after all.
Was called, and Harry could tell Michael was nervous.  He didn’t need to, though, because after about a minute, “Ravenclaw!” was yelled.
"I.. I kind of messed up and told Ron and Hermione I have a date with Cho." he said, not looking at Draco.
"That's not.. I mean.. It's Hermione! Why do they think I'm better than her? And why do they think I'm so great at it just because I've managed to luckily escape Voldemort a few times?"
"Not to mention, Hagrid and Ron hadn't exactly put any good ideas about Slytherins in my head." Harry finished.
"I just fainted and you're going to leave just like that? My head still hurts, Draco. It slammed pretty hard on that damned table."
"Well, you can't just call me that and expect me not to react." replied Draco, cheeks getting redder and redder.
"Draco, relax! Fine, I won't use any other spells.. But Muffliato is really useful, you have to agree."
But Draco wasn't listening. His eyes had widened and he was staring at Harry with a horrified expression.
But Harry was nowhere to be found. Draco decided to transfigure the desk.. He had practiced a lot of transfiguration over the summer, even when he thought Harry hated him.. Just in case. And he was proud of the almost-bed he had transfigured the desk into. He was standing their admiring his creation when Harry's head, just his bloody head, appeared on the bed. Draco screamed and fell back. Harry rolled over in bed laughing, while clutching his stomach.
The day after the party, the Daily Prophet was plastered with theories about Draco's and Harry's relationship. The front page had the headline:
"Fuck you, Potter. Go sleep in Weasley's bed." he said and turned around to dramatically exit the room when Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him onto the desk-bed.
"Hullo Draco. Welcome to the Burrow.." she said and Draco's eyes snapped to her. She smiled. "Molly says to make yourself at home while you're here."
Wow, he had made Malfoy stutter. Never in the past 3 years would he have thought he would see Malfoy stutter.
"Harry.. Didn't we "hate" each other, too? Look at us, now.. I'm sure your parents loved each other very much and that is why they married each other.."
"Hmm.. What if I try to transfigure that desk into a bed? Or at least something that resembles a bed.. And we should put a disillusionment charm on ourselves and lock the door-"
"Can you at least stop playing with my feelings if you can't be with me? One moment you're here kissing me as though your life depends on it, the next you're gone, sitting in Parkinson's arms.. It hurts, Draco. Just.. Just leave me alone or be mine."
"If you're done gawking at the cake, come on.. Let's cut it." said Harry, bursting Draco out of his thoughts.
He glances at Ron from the corner of his eyes. He's looking towards the floor. He's listening. Harry really doesn’t want to have this conversation, right now.
"Of course, Harry. But, we can't just burst into Malfoy Manor and collect him." Dumbledore replied, gesturing Harry to sit down which he did.
They danced for a while and Harry was lost in Draco's eyes and had almost leaned in to kiss him when Filch burst in, dragging Theodore Nott who was soon taken outside by Snape.
"Okay so.. It's not very hard doing the charm, the hard part is focusing on the memory that aids it. You need to think of a happy memory and then say the incantation. Try it."
"Er.. it started in fourth year.. Y'know the rumours of me kissing Draco.." replied Harry, blush deepening.
Harry sighed. He'd been thinking of Draco, too. When his sleep wasn't engulfed with nightmares of Voldemort, it was filled with dreams of Draco and their.. desk-bed. He smiled at the memory. But then he got flashbacks of Lucius Malfoy,  face concealed with the Death Eater mask, at the graveyard.
Well, that girl is insane but she's right. He should follow them. He draped Harry's invisibility cloak over himself and followed.
“He might be . . .” Harry whispered hoarsely, peering down the alley next door. “Or maybe . . .” He hurried to look down the one beyond that.
He opened it carefully and found a beautiful locket inside. It was a lion with emerald eyes and a silver snake wrapped around it.
"He gave my task to Theo." Draco mumbled. "He needed someone inside Hogwarts and when I ran away, he went to the Notts."
Harry's heart was pounding loudly. His hands were sweating, he couldn't breathe. Draco, Draco.. His Draco, a Death Eater.. No! No, he wouldn't let that happen. Help.. Draco asked for help.. He needed to get it together.. Dumbledore.. He needed Dumbledore.
But, that was the problem, wasn't it? That Draco hadn't rejected him. And he didn't want to be with Parkinson, he's gay.
She turned away, walked over to Pansy Parkinson and began questioning her about the lessons. Snape looked around at Harry and their eyes met for a second. Harry glanced at his potion. It turned out to be good enough despite him not paying much attention to it. He had Draco to thank for that. When Snape came to inspect his potion, his frown deepened.
“You’re a r-really good teacher, you know,” said Cho, with a watery smile. “I’ve never been able to Stun anything before.”
"One would say this entire set up was a great birthday present but of course not for the great Draco Malfoy."
"I'm pretty sure she already knows, Harry.. Besides, I told you I'll always stand with you.. Don't you think you should tell your friends?"
She was sitting opposite Ron, chatting with Cormac McLaggen, obviously to annoy Ron who surprisingly didn't have Lavender nearby.
"He's Draco. Harry's boyfriend. That's all you need to remember. Come on, Ron, don't you see how happy he makes Harry? Even when Harry is gloomy or angry, one look at Draco and his face softens. Be a good friend and be happy for him, please. He needs your support, Ron, not your accusations at the person he deeply cares for."
Harry smiled at him. He looked beautiful on the broomstick, looking absolutely ethereal with the sun shining on his platinum blond hair.. Harry was so distracted by his boyfriend's beauty, he didn't even realise when Draco had dived for the snitch. Eyes widening, Harry followed him but the snitch had disappeared.
“D- Er.. Malfoy?,” replied Harry at once, without thinking about it. He had almost said Draco's first name!
"Harry Potter sir is right! Dobby is being free thanks to Sir Harry Potter! He is having no master! Or young master!" Dobby said and jumped up and down.
“I know prefects can’t dock points, your Highness” sneered Nott. Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. “But members of the Inquisitorial Squad —”
"Sorry, Pans, I didn't realise I was ignoring you guys so much. Tell you what, I'll do homework with Harry.. Come on, let's go to the common room." he said, closed his books and stood up to be pulled into a crushing hug by Pansy.
"Well.. That was certainly unexpected but you must leave, now." Dumbledore said and Harry nodded, not letting go of Draco's hand. "Take this Portkey."
Harry had a smug look on his face. He had never thought he'd see the day Snape was so flustered. It was oddly satisfying.
"Potter, this is serious. I will steal that book of yours and hide it so that you may never find it, again!"
"Tell him not to write his name on the parchment, then." she said, shrugging as if it was that easy.
Harry woke up to immense back pain. As he gained consciousness, he realised this was because he was sleeping on the floor. And there was something- no, someone- sprawled over him.
"Well, you better make up your mind and choose one side, Draco. Being caught between two stools will only make life more difficult."
"Oh, come off it, Ron. He was just a stupid child with bad parents. He's grown up, now and I'm sure if Harry likes him, he's changed.. And don't forget how he helped us a few weeks ago!" she said.
"Draco. As much as I love seeing you admire this room and the Hogwarts founders.. I believe you have homework." Harry interrupted.
"We're good, Ron. You know I love it at the Burrow but I don't want to make both Draco and your family uncomfortable."
"Just answer me Draco. Me or your father?! I'm sure Dumbledore can help you and your mother leave that sick man!" he yelled.
"No.. no letter?" said Draco, the smile drained from his face when he saw Arcturus return from Harry's house without any letter.
"Well. Then, clearly you don't need me here. I'll just head to my dormitory if I could have my arm back, Potter."
"Well, at least someone has a healthy and happy relationship.. Blaise and Theo have been fighting since the beginning of the year! At first, it was just ridiculous banter then it got serious then there accusations of hiding things and cheating and-"
Two days later, Arcturus returned along with his letter. Draco frowned. Harry didn't receive his letter? He really wished he could talk to owls.
"We'll have to go the Three Broomsticks at lunch. If you don't want to come along, you can find your friends, I suppose." Harry said, even though he wanted to spend the day with Draco.
"I've been so worried about you! Why didn't you write back? And where were you? You sent my letters back!"
Draco was humming to himself while doing his homework in the library when Pansy decided to loudly slam her books on his table.
"Well, no one I know has one.. What if someone other than me receives the owl? Even if Harry doesn't sign his name.. No." Draco shook his head and Pansy sighed.
On the way, he suddenly realised Draco must have needed the Gryffindor password to sneak into his dorm. When he asked about it, he received the answer, "Don't ask too many questions, Potter, or I'll change my mind about taking you along." and that shut Harry up.
"Felt a little weird without you there. Mum said to tell you that you were missed." he said. "Oh and.. I told Lupin about er.. Snape and Nott." Ron whispered. "He reckons you should trust Dumbledore which means trusting Snape and er.. he thinks you're blinded by your hatred for Snape which is why you want to believe he's evil. Dad agrees with him."
Dobby was wearing an atrocity. He had one parrot green sock with black birds on it and one bright red one with gold stars on it. To top it off, he was wearing a weird, royal blue outfit.
He grabbed Harry and kissed him passionately to describe how grateful he was for his gift and him being there.
“It’s time you learned the difference between life and dreams, Potter,” said Malfoy. “Now give me the prophecy, or we start using wands.”
“Hello, Harry, Hello Draco..” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes, who was just behind Neville.
"Don't be daft, Harry. You can't go on a rescue mission with an empty stomach." she said, making Harry smile.
Draco beamed and all of Harry's previous anger melted away. How did one boy who was supposed to be his enemy have such an effect on him?
"Well, I'm sure Voldemort would be grateful considering you'd have done something he hasn't been able to do despite getting numerous chances."
Draco's eyes widened upon hearing Snape's voice. No, Severus couldn't know of this.. He would tell his mother.. He can't let them know! But, what would he say? What is he doing with his supposed enemy in a transfigured bed, clutching his hand, at midnight? He was doomed.
"I know.." Harry said and sighed. "But he seemed to be getting irritated by my untrustworthiness of Snape so I didn't press on the matter. I just don't understand.. He's always so mysterious. He still hasn't told me what happened to his hand.. And now he bloody expects me to get a sodding memory from Slughorn."
Harry held out the lime green pygmy puff for Draco to see. He'd seen the adorable little creature and was sure it would cheer Draco up, even if just a little.
He was walking to the Hospital Wing to see his friends, lost in his thoughts, the following words echoing in his head:
He was running. Umbridge had found out about the DA meeting. Dobby had just told them. And now he was running.
Draco rolled his eyes and leaned in. Harry quickly glanced to the crowd, but no one was paying him any heed. Draco's lips were above Harry's, he could feel his breath on his lips.
Draco had come to his dorm today since Harry was busy with Dumbledore's private lessons and Draco wasn't well so he decided to rest a little. But just when he was outside the door, he heard yelling.
Harry sat alone in the compartment while Ron and Hermione were off doing prefect duties. He was happy for Ron but also angry at Dumbledore. He was contemplating the reasons Dumbledore suddenly hates him when the compartment's door opened.
"Please." Draco whispered, his hand resting on Harry's and his gloomy eyes looking straight into Harry's.
"Are you stupid? Or do you take pleasure in pain?" Draco asked, looking at Harry as if he was an idiot.. which Harry supposed he was.
"He's never here, you say? And for how long has this been going on?" Hermione asked, trying to put two and two together.
"You two do know I'm sitting right here between you, right?" Draco said, still staring at Harry who just winked at him. He winked at him! In the bloody Great Hall! Where anyone could've seen! His eyes moved to Uncle Severus who was luckily busy eating.
"Dobby was helping Winky! But then he heard someone entering the kitchen, Harry Potter Sir! And it was being Harry Potter Sir!"
He could hear the whispers but he was too cold to care. Hermione was yelling at him for not coming back when he freed his own hostage but he didn't pay her any heed. All he cared was that Draco and the others were safe.
"I'm sorry but- You can't just.. tell me.. Oh Merlin! I can't even.. What was Weasel..? Marching up to the girls' dorm-"
"You know me so well." Draco said, settling down on a couch. "So? Aren't you two gonna tell me how you finally got together?"
Harry sighed. He really didn't know what to do about this whole situation with Draco. He couldn't just forget about Lucius Malfoy being a death eater but he also couldn't stop his feelings for Draco. That boy was going to be the death of him.
"Draco, relax! I'm sure there will be Aurors to guard me." Harry said, rolling his eyes. "If you want, you can wear my invisibility cloak till you're on the train?"
"GIVE ME ONE SODDING REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T BLOODY HAND YOU TO FILCH FOR BEING OUT AFTER CURFEW AND GIVE YOU DETENTION FOR ALMOST KILLING ME BY SCARING ME TO DEATH!"
"See you at midnight." said Harry just as Draco was about to exit the compartment and Draco grinned at the door.
"You do have a fever, Draco. Kreacher, bring us lunch, here, and some soup for Draco." Kreacher's lip curled but he gave a small nod and disapparated.
"I know.. But I just.. My father.. What he did to Snape.. And he didn't even have a reason.. What if he forced my mother to..?"
He had been waiting in the shadows the whole night. Waiting for everyone to leave the Hospital Wing so he could go see Harry.
"Harry, just because you don't hate me, it doesn't mean the entire Gryffindor house is suddenly in love with me. They hate me."
“Harry, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?” screamed Angelina, soaring past him to keep up with Katie. “GET GOING!”
I have the headcannon that Snape and Narcissa Malfoy are like really good friends and Snape is Draco's Godfather. (though, I still hate Snape)
“No idea,” said Harry, his eyes flicking towards the door which had just opened and closed. Or maybe he was imagining things? Unless Umbridge had an Invisibility cloak like his.. He didn't realise when Cho had moved closer. His brain too focused on the door.
"If.. If I don't write back for some reason, go to Grimmauld place in the London Borough of Islington. Stand between the 11th and 13th house and think 12 Grimmauld place until you see it."
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. He seemed to be thinking for few minutes and paused his hand in Draco's hair but resumed when Draco shuffled his head.
"Honestly, Potter. What would it cost you to pay attention in Potions? It's like you want to fail.."
"Well no, she figured it out, herself. And she's the one who told be to write to you but that's besides the point. Where have you been?!"
"It's not really surprising, you know? I mean I expect the school to be divided on this matter. Who knows, maybe even some teachers don't believe you? That Umbridge woman is bad news. I heard father talking to someone about her."
When he came out of the lavatory wearing his newest Weasley sweater, he saw Draco was wearing the one he'd received last Christmas and the blue scarf he'd given Harry.
"I'm not saying you'll tell them deliberately. I'm just.. Well, Snape told me about Legilimency and what if someone tries to read your mind, Draco?" Harry replied.
What is he doing? The plan was to just give a small peck to Malfoy's lips to shock him and shut him up. Why is he still kissing him? And why is he enjoying it so much? He needs to snap out of it!
"Are you and Scarhead having a threesome with the Weasel?" Pansy asked, realising Draco wasn't listening to her rants about Blaise and Theo.
Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label reading 'To Master, From Kreacher.'
They stood grouped around the end of the row, gazing down the alley beside it. There was nobody there.
"Stop it, already, Draco." Harry said to Draco who was on the floor, laughing while clutching his stomach.
He closed his eyes and drifted to sleep. He knew Draco would run away, again, when he woke up and he wasn't ready for that, yet. So, he decided to enjoy this for a little longer.
"I wonder if she'd still be happy for me for getting away if she knew I'd joined the opposite side.. I mean she only wanted me safe because she's my mother, not because she doesn't believe in You-Know-Who’s views. She would've even encouraged me to join You-Know-Who if I was of age and he wasn't just making me join him for avenging my father's mistakes.."
"Mother took me to Madam Malkins, first.. I convinced her to get Potions ingredients while I get my books to save time." he replied, glancing around, nervously.
He was going to the Burrow on Friday.. He'd have to explain his relationship with Draco to everyone.. He wished he could talk to Draco.
"As much as I like it when you spit out my last name like that, I prefer it when you call me Harry."
There was the broomstick.. And some more money.. And some clothes.. Draco's school robes, the Potion ingredients Narcissa probably bought that day.. And some books..
"Sorry? No need. No need to apologise for something you are going to do over and over again." Harry said, closing his eyes to prevent the tears from escaping.
"Don't worry, Harry. We've helped you through the last two tasks and we will keep helping you with the final one, too! I'm sure you'll succeed, Harry."
"Stop ignoring me! Honestly, what has gotten into you? What are you even reading?" Pansy asked, trying to peek at the book cover but Draco blushed and hid it.
"Draco!" Pansy yelled so loud, the entire Hall was staring at them. He looked at Harry who was looking at them curiously. He raised his eyebrows as to ask Draco what's up. Draco returned a pained expression which made him smile.
“He’s right down at the end,” said Harry, whose mouth had become slightly dry. “You can’t see properly from here. . . .”
"Well.. I wouldn't say that. You're just following different instructions.. I'm sure Granger is just jealous you made a potion she failed to make." Draco said and smirked.
Like I said everything is the same as in the books. However, since Harry liked Draco instead of Cho in Fourth year, the scenes with Cho and Harry obviously don't happen..
"Well, who is then? Just tell us, already..We already know the worst part.. She's a Gryffindor.. What could be worse than that?" Theo said.
"I'm hungry." said Draco, settling in the armchair in front of the fireplace. Harry summoned his blanket and threw it over Draco.
Harry looked at him. He looked unsure as if he wasn't sure how Harry would react. Harry thought he looked absolutely adorable but he didn't want to die yet so he wasn't going to tell him that.
"Potter. I forced a seventh year Slytherin to transfigure my face because I wanted to prank you. I'm sure doing that again would be a ridiculously suspicious thing to ask for." he replied.
"Oh, Draco.. Don't you think it's still better than sulking like this and making assumptions about what could happen?"
"Oh, I forgot to ask you," said Hermione brightly, glancing over at the Ravenclaw table, "what happened on your date with Cho?"
"I was thinking it isn't safe for us to meet like this in here, anymore.. Now that Umbridge is headmistress, she has complete control over Hogwarts and well she hates you.. This could get us in trouble."
"I'll help you do it. I'd do it for you but you already don't pay attention in classes and you need to learn. It's OWL year, for Merlin's sake."
"I did have a great personal tutor. I think you helped me more than that little group of yours.. And I was good, anyway." he replied, haughtily.
"Hog's Head? I didn't want to draw too much attention to myself. I'll look like a maniac talking to myself.. Oh and Hermione wanted to meet up to talk about something. You can come along."
"Of course, you do.. Breaking rules like your ridiculous, arrogant father. Detention on Saturday, then."
The look on Snape's face was priceless as he handed Harry's moonstone essay with an A on it. Harry thought he'd deserved at least an E for that one but nevertheless, even an A was enough in Potions after all his suffering.. Then, Snape started lecturing the class about how cheating off their friends won't get them a good grade in their OWLS. Harry just rolled his eyes and glanced at Draco who was already looking at him, glaring in case anyone saw him staring at Harry. Harry gave a small smile and Draco winked while scowling at Harry.
"But you didn't know that, did you? And you tried it on your best friend! Harry, please. Using a book for Potions help is different but don't bloody recite spells you've got no idea about! How would you know it's not the Dark Arts?!"
"Why can't you just leave my friends, alone, Draco?" said Harry in a tired voice and dropped down on the armchair.
"I dunno.." Draco replied thinking back to what Severus had once said to him about not making the right choice. "I still feel like Dumbledore wouldn't trust him unless he was absolutely sure.."
Just as he was about to interrupt Harry's pointless pacing again, something incredibly strange happened and a door appeared on the wall Draco had just been staring at.
"Fine, then, be that way. We'll find out, soon enough." he replied. "Come on, Theo." he said and pulled Theo along with him, out the dorm.
More tears were falling from her eyes. Merlin, Harry felt so guilty. Why did she have to try to kiss him like that?!
"I suppose not.. At any rate, I reckon Hermione doesn't trust any Slytherins to keep quiet about the group. Of course, you're not all evil but.. most of your families are or are associated with Death eaters and those whose aren't are friends with y'all so.. I get her decision to not involve Slytherins, even if it is a little biased and unfair.."
"Um.. I'll check on him." Hermione said, leaving them alone with Luna. Neville and Ginny had already left to change their robes.
"Pinky has brought Master Draco his lunch." said Pinky, the only house elf allowed in his room at this point..
"We'll figure something out." he said, so confidently, Draco wanted to believe him. To forget everything and believe Potter would fix everything, make it okay.
“On the count of three then,” said Snape lazily. “One — two —” Snape’s office door banged open and Pansy Parkinson sped in.
"Harry, calm down, dear." she said pulling him down the stairs. "Breathe." she said and went to the kitchen.
"Don't you see how much I've learned from you, Harry? You can be noble and humble all you want, but come on.. You're probably the best at DADA in our year if not this entire school!"
Harry heard muffled sobs when he was outside the room. He went in. Draco had opened the package and it's contents were sprawled over the whole bed.
Harry was sleeping when he started getting pecked by the owl. He put on his glasses and recognised Arcturus. His heart sank. This could not be good news. He quickly checked his watch. 3 AM. He sat up and untied the letter.
But, just then, Malfoy's lips part a little and Harry leaves no time in sliding his tongue inside Malfoy's mouth. Malfoy jumps. He actually jumps from the surprise of Harry's tongue suddenly inside him, breaking the kiss.
He couldn't go to Draco like this.. He would ask why his hand is bleeding. What would Harry tell him? He would be furious..
"Well, I dunno.. I just thought it'd be a good prank if I kissed him, it'd shut him up.. I just didn't think I'd like it so much.. And well.. There was a lot of avoiding then some kissing and running away.. A lot of drama, honestly.. And some fights but here we are, finally boyfriends." Harry finished with a blush on his face.
"Do you know what giving a ring means?" Draco asked after their make-out session, staring at the ring on his finger.
“I know it must be horrible for you,” she said, mopping her eyes on her sleeve again. “Me mentioning Cedric, when you saw him die. . . .  I suppose you just want to forget about it. . . .”
"Oh, I never said they were a girl, Draco. I know you more than you know yourself. So.. Who's the boy?"
"Dramatic as always, Malfoy. Where've you been?" Theo asked, pulling his arm back from Blaise and grabbing his hand, instead.
Cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. She was even nearer him now. He was backing away.
Draco shook his head, trying to control his laughter but eventually giving up and bursting into laughter.
“Liar!” shouted Umbridge. She threw him from her, and he slammed into the desk. Now he could see Hermione pinioned against the wall by Millicent Bulstrode and Draco was standing in the doorway, wide-eyed.
Now, Harry was looking forward to the day. With everything that was going on, this could be a pleasant distraction..
"I bet the Ravenclaw showers are empty." Harry whispered when he "accidentally" bumped into Draco. Draco's eyes widened and a blush formed on his cheeks as he made his way to the changing rooms.
"Why are you so red? Are you cold?" Harry said and took off his scarf to put around Draco. He seemed to be oblivious to what hs had said, apparently.
"Please let me go, right now. He's waiting for me." he made his best puppy eyes which he knew would melt Pansy.
"Really, I thought you were past those stupid muggleborn prejudices but I guess not." Harry replied, furious. He'd really thought Draco had changed. But he guessed Ron was right. Family does matter.
"Er.. It was Malfoy. Dunno what's wrong with him.. He stunned Nott, gave us our wands and then Parkinson helped me.. And well.."
"Yeah, Hermione did.." Harry replied, his thoughts still lost in the discussion he'd had with Ron and Hermione about teaching them DADA. First, Draco, now them..
"Sorry.. I'm not feeling well.. I want to be alone, I'll- I'll eat in the kitchens." he said, glaring at Pansy Parkinson who's arm was around Draco's shoulder.
Was he telling Draco to choose Harry? But he hated Harry! And who was he talking about? Who had he lost?
“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually give their house-elves Christmas presents?” asked Harry while Draco waved his wand over the parcel.
He woke up with the light shining in his face. He was in Fred and George's bedroom, again. He checked his watch. 11 AM. His eyes snapped to check if Arcturus was still there. He was, thankfully. Harry got up and ran out the door.
"I know, Harry. He knows, too. He said he trusts Dumbledore and if you do too then you should trust Snape as well."
"I only disliked his favouritism towards you but seeing as I don't.. dislike you anymore..  I'm not sure I ever did dislike you, though.." he said, wandering off into his thoughts.
Then, Harry told him everything that had happened on the day Arthur was attacked and what Dumbledore thought of his connection with Voldemort.
"Exactly! Three days! We used to hang out and play games in the common room, everyday after homework! You don't even do homework with us, anymore. Blaise is very suspicious and completely convinced you're shagging a girl and at this point, I've stopped denying him. Crabbe and Goyle were already idiotic buffoons but now they're just miserable. Even, Theo was asking about you.. What am I supposed to tell them?!"
"It's perfect." he whispered and smiled, wiping away his tears. "You're perfect." he said as he leaned in to snog Harry senseless.
“It’s him!” Umbridge said jubilantly at the sight of Harry on the floor. “Excellent, Draco, excellent, oh, very good - fifty points to Slytherin! I’ll take him from here... Stand up, Potter!”
"Malfoy and Potter. Detention for fighting again, I reckon? Foolish students, always fighting! If only Dumbledore would let me-"
"Oh.. Oh my God! Harry, we need to get him out of there!" Hermione said, pulling Harry into a fierce hug.
As he emerged from the water with Fleur's little sister and Draco who was blushing furiously, the cheering audience went completely silent as they saw who he had brought.
"Hey! You know how he's been! Snapping at us for everything.. I didn't want to make him angrier by interrogating him!" said Ron and went to the lavatory to brush his teeth.
"I'm the Malfoy heir, Harry. There are certain.. expectations from me. I'm their only child, I need to produce an heir. And.. besides.. Homosexuality isn't exactly praised amongst the purebloods. I'd be disowned. I don't know about my mother but.. Father, he'd.. He'd probably kill me or lock me up or I don't know.. And not to mention, you're you. Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, the boy who defeated the Dark Lord.. I'm sure you know who my father supports.. What do you think he'd do with me if he finds out I'm- I'm dating you? Hypothetically speaking, of course. And and.. He said.. He said he's returning. What am I supposed to do?"
He could feel Malfoy's eyes tearing into his skull, from the other end of the hall. But, he didn't look up. He didn't know how to face his arch-nemesis after the stunt he'd pulled. Who in their right mind decides to kiss their arch-nemesis?
"I know you're hopelessly in love with Potter but that doesn't mean you should avoid all your friends and spend all your free time with him!"
"I won't. I'm sorry, okay? I- I didn't realise it would get that far.. I was just.. I.. I don't know! I was just trying to tease you and win the match for once but I.. I'm sorry."
"Pansy told me about that place." he said. "Now, can we please get inside some place before I freeze to death?"
"Ron was really curious about how I've been doing my homework on time, nowadays.. And Hermione was looking at me weirdly.. Like she knew something."
Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked Draco who was opening a box of Honeydukes chocolates.
"Don't be ridiculous, Voldemort wouldn't let anyone else kill me, he would like to personally end me." Harry said.
"Ah, there you are." said Dumbledore and gestured for Harry to take his arm. Draco looked uncomfortable at the thought of going with Molly but Molly would be nice to him, Harry thought. That's why he'd insisted she comes with them.
Draco had come with him empty handed. Of course, he couldn't bring much with him as he was supposed to be there for shopping not running away with his boyfriend. He'd only had his wand and a pouch of Galleons.
"Oh, don't look so surprised, Draco, you were after all the one who told me Theo fancied Blaise back in third year." Pansy interjected.
Draco frowned. He knew Harry was right. And it reminded him of the choice he was procrastinating on making..
“ ’Course,” said Ron bitterly, stuffing the rest of his chocolate frog into his mouth and taking another.
He couldn't care less. He wanted Draco. He wanted Draco to be his. But, Draco was too scared to be with him. He was probably upset about the whole situation.
Draco, who was looking flawless in those fancy dress robes.. Draco, who was standing with Pansy Parkinson. He knew Draco was gay, yet, he felt a pang of jealousy as he saw Pansy's arm in Draco's. He gripped his glass so hard it broke.
Harry threw a pillow at him and he threw it back, which led to a pillow fight, which eventually led to Harry tripping and falling on top of Draco on their bed, which led to snogging which turned into something more.
Harry's face fell. Of course. Malfoy was straight. It had been stupid to kiss him and even more stupid to ask him to go to the Yule Ball. Merlin, this was so embarrassing, he should-
Harry was opening his Christmas presents and found an unnamed box wrapped in red paper and gold ribbon - Gryffindor colours. He wondered who that could be from. He cautiously opened it - the Hermione-like voice in his brain telling him it could be a dark artifact or a cursed object, but he was ignoring that voice - and found a royal blue scarf inside. Well, clothes could hardly be harmful, right? Unless it was designed to strangle him.. He touched it and it was incredibly soft. A piece of paper fell to the floor. Harry picked it up.
