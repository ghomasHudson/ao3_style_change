“Potter, what’s this?”
Draco fixes him with a glare, and all playfulness is gone. “Oh there won’t be anything casual about this, Potter,” he growls, and Harry shivers in anticipation.
“You know I can’t stay here, Draco,” he says, looking fixedly at a spot beside your elbow. “You’re struggling. I see how it’s tearing you apart, and I can’t be the reason for this fight between what you want and what you think you’re obliged to do.”
And it’s easy talking to her, Harry finds, now that they’ve grown out of their awkward teenage selves and have some distance to it all, not seeing the world in black and white. She’s surprisingly funny, with witty comments about the game and herself and Harry, and Harry finds himself utterly charmed by her: time flies by while her broom lies long forgotten on his counter. So when she asks him if he wants to have dinner with her that evening, “for old time’s sake” and “while she’s still in town”, he doesn’t see any reason not to. He could use a distaction, and he needs to start dating for real anyway.
“Oh Merlin, spare me,” Potter muttered, which made Draco giggle, before Potter’s look of utter surprise at his behaviour made him realise what he was doing.
Harry doesn't return for several hours, and you have to prepare the flowers for drying by yourself, the usually so comforting task of monotony now just feeling tiresome. You’re in the church for Vespers when the door opens and he shuffles in, his head bowed. He doesn’t look at you when you try to catch his eye.
There was a murmur of disappointment, and then one girl piped up, “But what if we only wanted to know what our families and friends are getting us for Christmas?”
Draco sucked in a breath but tried to hide it by snickering.
Harry glanced at Draco and he couldn’t keep the laughter inside at his look of utter indignation.
Harry was sitting on the sofa, reading up on spell damage and the proper diagnostic procedures for it. It had been a long day, he had just started a new intense course and he was knackered, but he still needed to read for tomorrow’s test.
“Well, that’s obvious, isn’t it?” Dean Thomas said. “We have four rooms, and it only makes sense that Seamus and I take one, Ron and Hermione are together in one, and that the lovebirds — sorry, I mean Luna and Pansy, share one.”
.) I mean, yes?”
Malfoy took his sweet time choosing a glass, standing on tiptoes, and Harry distinctly did
But okay, back to Draco. Like I said, Hermione said I’ve had a thing for him for ages, and we both agreed that whatever those feelings were, I’m now probably (most definitely) in love with him. Hermione even thinks he might be in love with me as well, based on his behaviour (and she mentioned something about how he acted at school too), but I’m not so sure.
Draco folded his arms across his chest, lifting his chin. “I have no idea what gave you that impression, Potter, but—”
“Don’t,” you say to cut him off. “Don’t say it. I’d like to too, but we can’t. It’s wrong.”
“N-nothing, it’s just.. your eyes look ever greener without the glasses, or maybe it’s because you’re so close. I mean— ”
“ … Do you think…? Could you maybe show me how to properly remove it?”
“Don’t give me that speech on how I’m worthy of love despite my efforts, it’s not what I need right now.”
“Oh fuck me, that’s so hot,” he whispers, and then his lips are on Harry’s, nipping, biting, coaxing them open to slip his tongue inside Harry’s mouth, knocking Harry’s glasses ascew, and Harry’s spent cock twitches at the intensity with which Draco kisses him, his hand in Harry’s hair and his chest pressed flush against Harry’s.
Draco raises his eyebrows in surprise, and she continues.
Tears start sliding down his cheeks and he lets them come. He knows he should stop talking but he can’t, it’s like the dams have been opened and every frustrated feeling he’s ever had about Draco and their relationship and the end drawing near comes welling out of him. He lets his head fall forwards to hide his face, because he can’t bear to see the pity Draco must feel for Harry right now.
He talks a lot with Astoria now. It’s fucking annoying. I mean, Astoria is great. She’s funny and beautiful and witty and she has a pleasant voice. I don’t know why they broke up, she seems amazing.
, you moron!”
“Whatever you’re willing to tell me,” he says, sighing and then frowning a little when you take the dressings off the deeper wounds on his stomach.
Harry wasn’t sure if he was flexing his buttocks deliberately, or if they looked like that all the time when he was walking. Then Malfoy’s words caught up with him. “Date?” he managed to choke out.
“I don’t regret it either.”
“Yeah, well they still count! It’s not like they make you wiser anyway,” Harry said, taking Draco’s hand and dragging him towards the door. “Now, let me take you to dinner, Mindhealer Malfoy.”
coming?”
“Excuse me?”
“I must say that surprises me, I assumed you’d miss my perfect arse and my unprecedented blow job skills.”
You wait, until you realise you need to offer him something.
“I think you’re right, Neville,” he said as he waved him off. “We’ll try our best though. And… We’d appreciate it if you… didn’t mention this to anyone. Not yet, at least.” He glanced at Harry, who nodded.
Potter’s eyes widened and his mouth rounded into a perfectly shaped O. “Whoa. That’s— That was a lot.”
“Did he…” he swallows, “did he die here?”
Draco sighs, and even though Harry can’t see it he knows Draco is rolling his eyes. “Yes, Harry, I’ll marry you so you can keep fucking this glorious arse of mine. Once in a while.”
Jane chuckles and starts with the coffee, banging her tools. “One quadruple shot espresso, coming right up!”
It’s time for Vesper.
“Oh, Potter, didn’t see you there,” he said with an air of innocence. “But I’m happy you’re here so I can ask for your opinion. Do you think I’m dressed more appropriately now?”
of our problems at this point.”
Draco’s breath tickled Harry’s ear, his body pressed close, one hand resting on Harry’s shoulder. Harry turned his head, making their noses bump, and forced out a chuckle.
“You… You mean…”
You wait.
“I thought you wanted to stay, that’s all,” he says eventually with a shrug.
Harry shrugged, trying to sound casual. “It was Hermione’s suggestion after I asked her for an ingredient that would make the texture of the hair a little… rougher. Not as sleek and shiny. Easier to shape.”
”Our tests show that your roots go deep, which is why you’re having trouble moving now. This usually only happens when this condition has reached its late stages, where the patient can barely talk without flowers falling out of their mouth, a stage that you haven’t reached yet, obviously. So I’d say that the reason the roots inside you go so deep is more likely because the object of your love is someone that you’ve known for a long time. Possibly since childhood or early adolescence.”
happened between you and Potter on the night of Luna’s art opening?”
Harry grabbed one plate along with one set of cutlery, because he’d rather have his arm hexed off than wash up any more of Malfoy’s dishes than strictly necessary.
“Listen, Draco—” Potter starts, and Draco knows immediately what’s to come, and he knows he doesn’t want to hear it, knows it’ll only make everything worse. But he’s too weak to protest, so Potter continues. “You know we said, when we started this… this thing, we said that we’d only keep it up as long as no one caught any feelings.”
When you go to Lauds in the early morning sun, you wish he was well enough to join you. You take all the meals you can by the side of his bed, and talk about his life before he started his pilgrimage, but never touch the subject of what happened for him to set out on it. And you find that you don’t care what he did, that you’re happy fate led him to you, made you able to see him every day. Like a flower, you seek the warmth and light of the sun that is him.
“Thank you, really,” she says, hoisting the baby she’s holding higher up on her hip. “Although, I must ask… Forgive me for being frank, but as a thank you, could I perhaps introduce you to my husband’s niece? She’s old enough for marriage and she cooks well. She could really be useful to you, Mr Malfoy.”
There’s a knock on the door and Healer Goodwin steps in.
“They don’t
, I’ll go.”
“So it seems,” he says, looking defensive, but then his face softens. “Except…” he says, breaking off.
Draco stepped closer.
. My hips started bucking against him of their own accord, and I buried my face in the crook of his neck and I moaned so loudly I was practically screaming. It was embarrassing, except that it wasn’t, or I didn’t care, because it felt so
“No, I’m sorry to say that it’s worse than that.”
“No,” you breathe. “No. Keep going.”
The visitor’s chairs in the Healer’s office are, quite impressively, even more uncomfortable than the ones out in the waiting area, because why would you want some cushioning for your bum when you’re about to receive the worst news of your life?
“And this is the bed that we’re supposed to share?”
The only known lasting cure for the Hanahaki Disease is to have the victim’s love requited.”
His shoulders drop a fraction and he looks at you for a second before he resumes staring at the stream. Eventually, he says, “I did… improper things. With another man.”
”. He does casual sex, and even if it’s recurring, and even if he’s requested they’re exclusive, he’s still not ready to call it anything more than this.
It’s so unfair, Harry thinks while Draco needs to pause to cough up new flowers and Harry helps him vanish the mess. The attacks are coming at shorter intervals now, and it’s so unfair that it’s not him that Draco loves, that they’re both stuck here, both heart broken from unrequited love. And even though they’re being so open with each other right now, Harry has to fight the desperate urge to ask Draco if he could’ve done something different, something to make Draco love
I can’t stress enough how lucky I am to have him as a friend now. It still feels a bit strange that my former school nemesis (oh come on, past Harry, what eleven year old boy has a
Okay, I don’t really know what’s going on right now. With Draco I mean. This… sex thing we do has become sort of normal now? Or, well, we do it from time to time and… it’s always so good. It feels amazing. Strange but amazing. Sometimes I think it’s the best sex I’ve ever had because it’s like Draco knows what I want, but I guess that’s just because we know each other so well by now. I don’t know. I’m really confused and I don’t know what we’re doing. I mean we’re both straight, but every time we have sex it’s like… it’s exhillarating in a way I haven’t felt in a long time. If ever. Whenever I’m in my room I think about sucking him off, or him doing it to me, and I get so unbelievably hard that I have to work myself off to relieve the pressure.
”, and Harry drinks them all in, tries to focus on cataloguing Draco’s movements, the muscles of his back working underneath Harry’s hands as he’s moving inside Harry, his hair falling into Harry’s face, the warm smoothness of his chest against Harry’s, the weight of his body trapping Harry’s cock between them, rubbing it torturously. The air is hot and heavy, the sounds of Draco’s grunts along with the slapping of skin on skin so arousing, and Harry has never felt this good with anyone else, never had this complete trust with anyone, never felt this loved by anyone, even if they haven’t yet got to that point yet where they use that word.
Harry doesn’t know why he’s disappointed. This was what he expected, after all. “Right, I forgot I’m with Mr Heaven-forbid-I’d-let-my-casually-exclusive-fuckbuddy-stay-over. So sorry for forgetting.” Out of anger he gets up quicker than he means to and his head spins a bit before he gets the dizziness under control so he can start getting dressed.
things happen), and then we realise hours later that it’s super late and we ought to go to bed.)
behind his back. “Nothing, it’s, uh, I’ll have a closer look at this later.”
Your breath catches in your lungs, freezing.
Then, Draco’s motions turn shorter, faster, more irregular, and Harry knows he’s close. He has to look up at him, it’s such a beautiful thing to see Draco come. Because in every sense of the word, Draco is cutting and sharp, precise like a surgeon’s knife. One well chosen line and a perfectly arched eyebrow have made people at various social events crumble, and have had Harry almost offering his condolences for the loss of their dignity. And here, in private, with just the two of them, Draco is equally as deliberate, measured, every move designed to take Harry higher and higher, something that Harry loves. He loves all the ways Draco knows how to touch him to make him go crazy with want, loves how Draco seems to intuitively know what Harry needs, and when he doesn’t know he asks. But he also loves when Draco loses that control, loses himself in giving and taking pleasure, loves when his pupils go wide with lust, when his movements become erratic and he gives in to instinct.
There was another wave of laughter, and someone shouted “That’s not Legilimency, that’s
Draco couldn’t swallow him fast enough. He wanted Harry to use him and tear him apart piece by piece. He wanted this to last forever, but soon Harry's hips shuttered and he let go with a long groan and a few curses. Come spilled over Draco’s lips as Harry pulled out and slid down to lick and kiss the last traces from his face.
Draco laughed. “Don’t worry, I’ll help you. We have a week to prepare. Let’s start by going on a muggle date tonight and then brave the wizarding world. People need to believe it, Harry.”
“Not to sound…
Oh I forgot to write that the first sourdough base went bad so I started a new one. It’ll be ready to bake with tomorrow and I’m pretty excited about it.
You fail miserably when you hear a wolf howling in the distance, and you start running wildly into the forest, twigs and pine needles scratching at your face. But you hardly feel them, you need to keep running, need to find the cabin.
Even for a clergyman, you lead a quiet life, Brother Draco. You rise in the middle of the night for Matins, you eat your breakfast in silence, you attend all the prayers throughout the day, and you never stop to think about the comforts of your old life outside the monastery.
It’s funny how you can know, intellectually, that you should not have showed up at Potter’s party and fucked him senseless in an empty bathroom on the third floor.
Oh who am I trying to fool, I’ll let him have some anyway. If only to keep him from nagging me about having a taste. He can be so fucking persistent.
You make a noise of consent, and then you drop your forehead down onto the cool wood, focusing on breathing, on relaxing, on letting him in.
Potter’s gaze follows it as well, an awed look on his face.
He was so busy trying to figure out where the suspect was, Draco didn’t notice Harry come over to his side of the bed.
“Right, I’m off then. Good luck tonight”
going, and I assume
Harry felt bad, because Draco’s anger had now been replaced with an air of bitter resignation: his shoulders were slumped and when he turned to go back into the shower, he didn’t have his usual swagger.
He needed to get out of this.
Harry gulped down the water, “NO! I’m not okay!” Harry shouted, launching Draco magically away from him. “Innocent people are being forced into unwanted bonds here!” Draco held up his hands in an obvious show of submission, waiting for Harry to calm down.
“The very same,” Draco says, clearly relieved that she’s finally caught up.
“Yeah you’re right about that,” Harry scoffs. “And I assume that’s why you always want to keep this on your home turf, to be able to set the rules, keep the control. Why don’t you try coming over to mine next time and see how fun it is to have to leave in the middle of the night when you just want to fucking relax?”
“We need to dry these if we don’t want to get sick,” he tells you when he notices you’re staring, then he cocks his head to the side. “Or perhaps it’s a sin to be naked in the same room? Perhaps it’s better to die rather than to defy the Lord’s will.”
“Smug prick,” Potter says, but the words lose all bite when he snuggles in closer and slings an arm around Draco’s torso. He feels completely boneless and relaxed, a reassuring weight against Draco’s body.
“POTTER!!!”
Harry launched a Stinging Hex that left a red welt on the side of Alex’s face. “Also I’m able to resist forced persuasion through legilimency, I can resist the fucking Imperius Curse, you idiot. Read a history book.”
“Right now?”
He smiles shakily at you, looking relieved, and then he joins you on the bed again. He pours a generous amount of oil onto his fingers and brings his hand down between your buttocks, massaging your rim, making you hiss with pleasure.
!” Harry says when Draco uses his tongue to add pressure, making the pendulum inside him swing back to impatient.
So I was cooking us dinner, and Draco came into the kitchen because he recognised the smell. And of course, Draco being Draco, he said “What did you do?” because
The realisation makes him delighted beyond belief.
Harry stirs in his sleep, sighing and pressing himself closer to you, and you can’t find it in yourself to think about it anymore, not when you have this. You decide to let it go for now, to dwell on the consequences of your actions tomorrow.
Draco sets his jaw firm, looking away from her. She’s like a bloody badger sometimes, once she’s sunk her teeth in you, refusing to let go until something snaps.
Stay away from the crups
“How did you get into this starting group? It’s supposed to be for runners who’ve been seeded.”
Harry nods, his eyes locked with Draco’s, hypnotised under his mercurial scrutiny. “I did. And now I’m home and I’m all yours.”
“Hmm? Oh, sorry, I… I was… baffled - yes, baffled - at the fake modesty, that’s all.”
“What the fuck Malfoy, this is like our entire supply of plates that you’ve been hoarding!”
Harry snorts into Draco’s shoulder. “I can’t, remember?”
And you suck him off better than anyone else could, because you’re the best, aren’t you? You’re the best and you’ll never
“Doing what?”
Harry clenched his teeth, trying to come up with a snarky retort, but nothing came to mind. “You wish,” he muttered, trying but failing to ignore the low sultry chuckle from Malfoy.
Ron gave Harry an apologetic look. “Sorry, Harry, I’ll tell Ginny off for moving in with Parkinson,” which really was only half the reason Harry had ended up being flatmates with Malfoy.
“Okay, the potion I made should counteract anything they give you.” Draco shuffled through his bag and pulled out a portion of violet liquid. “Drink this.”
And now here Harry was, lying beside Draco, watching his sleeping form, unsure how to proceed. He really wanted to wake Draco up by kissing those gorgeous lips, or by letting his lips slide along the entire length of Draco’s spine, but something made him hesitate. He wasn’t really sure Draco felt the same way about him. It was obvious he enjoyed Harry’s company, but what if he found out that Harry was head over heels in love with him and had been for quite some time? What if he only wanted some casual shagging? What if his only reason for taking Harry to bed had been that it was convenient, them being two single gay men living in close proximity without much other company? Most of all, Harry wasn’t sure he could deal with that particular conversation at this particular moment.
“Go to your date before I hex you,” she elbowed him playfully, “and tell….Draco, that I’m sorry for punching him a few years ago. But he deserved it.”
“What's going on, Harry?”
“Dumbass.”
“So you know who is Harry’s crush, Ginny?” Asked Ron, one of his hands on his chest, “I thought we were your best friends, Harry. And you told my sister first?”
He breathed, trying to come up with a summary of everything that had happened, “Remember the conversation about my crush that we had on the first day? well, I’m… making some progress with that person, okay? we have been meeting these days and It’s going really well.”
“...What?”
“This is nice.”
“That would be… nice,” Draco answered, still sounding unsure, “but why me?”
And the destiny was totally in his favour (or against him, it depends) when he collided with the person that was owning his thoughts. The one and only, Draco Malfoy.
Harry raised an eyebrow, “Really?”
“I hope you don’t… blame yourself for everything that happened, Draco. Because I don’t blame you. You were a child, you just were trying to do what was best for your family and your pride. And I did the same.”
Harry tried to shrug, wincing from the movement and biting back a whimper, "I was just checking on you."
“Care enough to share them?”
“Ehm.. yes. I think so.”
“You're acting very nice to me,” He started putting on his glasses, “Is it because I almost died?”
As Harry was walking down the hallways, he remembered the conversation he had with his friends two weeks ago. They did have some good points- he wasn't that bad. And really, everything could happen, he didn't expect Ron and Hermione to be together, but they were. He also didn't expect for Ginny to get in a relationship with Luna in the two weeks that had passed, but she did.
“Oh.”
“Should I have asked before doing that?
The guy woke up disoriented and unstable, falling to his knees when he tried to get up. His eyes followed Harry's face and then Draco's, both of them watching him with unreadable expressions, but definitely not friendly ones.
Are you really in the position to be bossing me around? Draco shook his head, trying to remain calm. Healing was easier when you were calm, and Draco needed a steady grip on his wand for this to work.. He couldn't let Harry die, not like this.
Harry accommodated himself better, moving a little bit closer to Draco. He didn’t try to move away, instead, he leaned a bit on Harry. Their shoulders were touching and their hands were dancing near each other, doubtful and nervous.
Draco released the air he was holding and arched an eyebrow to the guy laying on the ground, falling on his back probably hurt, but he didn't care to be honest, “What an asshole.”
“Yes…..?” Answered Harry, not knowing if Hermione’s expression was good or bad, “I’m sorry if that bothers you, ’Mione.”
“Just because you almost died doesn't mean now you get everything on a silver plate.”
“It's not that.”
“I'm glad. I had a lot of practice, I guess I became good without noticing.”
“Weren’t you paying attention to the last class?”
“Ginny,” Ron scolded her, “don’t make Harry more uncomfortable.”
Harry grunted but nodded anyways, letting himself relax a little. You almost die a few times and you get all sappy he thought, brushing the thoughts away. They stayed in silence a few seconds, and Harry could sense how his heart was beating a little bit faster than usual- how was he still paranoid after what happened yesterday? It was Draco's house, both of them were there, it was safe. Yet he still could hear his heartbeat bouncing around like it was a goddamn party in his chest.
Maybe being warm wasn't that bad when Harry Potter was cuddling you.
His eyes tried to focus, but it was hard when his classes were nowhere to be able to reach them, “Did you get my glasses?”
The girl stuck out her tongue in a mocking gesture, “Oh, but you do have a crush.”
He was happy.
“I remember. But he isn't one anymore.”
“So… you didn't sleep at all?”
Clearly, they had something going on, but it didn’t have a name. Harry knew from the first day that he wanted to leave everything in the past and start again his story with the Malfoy, but was Draco on the same page? sometimes he would lay down next to Harry and laugh at funny clouds, or even play with Harry’s hair when he was falling asleep after a difficult match of Quidditch. All the signals could be read as something evident- but were they ready to take another step...?
“Any more words of wisdom coming from you, Harry?”
“I don't understand.”
All of the group laughed, taunting their pockets for their wands. Harry didn't want to fight anymore after the war, but they were surely testing him.
“Oh, so there will be a next time, Potter?”
Harry giggled a little, looking at his two friends. Not even a war could change who they were as people.
“What?”
But of course, his muscles were still aching like he had run some type of marathon.
“The whole... “ Harry coughed, “curse thing.”
“Yes, that. If one Auror knows that, I'm going to hex you.”
The candelabrum hanging above the living room was what reminded Harry the most of the Malfoy manor, with its expensive design and sparking metal accents. The sofa that Draco lead him was clearly expensive, too- and there was a certainly reason for its price. Harry sighed with relief when his body hit the soft cushions. It even smelled good- he sighed deeply as mil citrus scent- Draco's scent- surrounded him.
“The war ended. I’m just… Harry. I don’t have anything special besides this dumb scar.”
Draco ignored the comment and cracked his knuckles softly, his gaze noticing how messy Harry's hair got. It was cute seeing it sticking out in different positions and falling in a funny way on the man's face, “You were saying I'm good at healing?”
And then everything went dark.
“...Are you mad at me and Ron? Because I promise you we won’t fight that much if you come back and spend time with us. We are worried about you.”
“Well, I dunno, you're the one who can see me,” Harry grumbled, he made no move to get up.
“I thought every kid had to do it. And I assumed Dudley didn't because well… he was their son.”
Draco tilted his head, “Sorry about what?”
“'m fine,” Harry insisted, but he let Draco wrap his arm around his waist anyways, "What about my glasses?"
“Oh, wow. Now you're the one interrupting my sleep.”
“Just do it next time if you don’t want me to die from a heart attack.”
“Is that enough for you to feel like you have a chance?”
“Nothing important.”
“Why...not?” Responded Harry, confused.
“Yes.”
Harry nodded and shuffled forward, and he would have fallen over if it wasn't for Draco supporting nearly his entire weight.
“I don’t know. You were kind of annoying. I was also annoying.”
“I’m going to the Black Lake… why?”
After that day, everyone would’ve expected that they had become even closer, but the thing is- Harry was extremely oblivious, and he didn’t notice that after one week of meeting every day and holding hands, Draco could be expecting something more.
“I like your sofa,” Harry murmured.
Well, the thing is; it was another kind of nervousness.
Harry felt his body tensing and suddenly his two best friends were staring at him with suggesting looks, waiting for an answer. He couldn’t give it to them as if it were nothing- lying wasn’t an option either since they knew he was a pretty bad liar when it came to his personal life and interests. It was the first time he was head over heels with someone after spending so much time of his life trying to save the whole wizarding world and not thinking about what he wanted.
Draco decided to get up, stretching his legs while Harry was getting ready to say whatever he was thinking about. His eyes were squinted as he searched for the memory probably already forgotten, but when the light hit his eyes Draco saw it- he remembered.
“I slept a reasonable amount.”
“And if you were insecure,” Ginny was the last to say something, “You’re a very good boyfriend. Very pleasant kisses.”
When Harry realized he said Draco's name, he coughed to hide his sudden embarrassment. It came to him as something natural to say, but he didn’t know if Draco felt the same sensation.
“I can't hibernate like you, Potter.”
“You weren't talking about that?”
The question that flew on the air caught Draco with his guards down. He tilted his head a little as if he was asking if that was a joke or the boy was talking seriously to him. It was awkward, and Harry was ready to apologize and go running to hide in the bathrooms at any moment.
“That's because I wasn't interested in your blood staining my best rug, Potter," Draco said dryly, "besides, your life is a little more important than the Statute of Secrecy."
“You're actually warm.”
“Morning...?” Harry mumbled, looking around for a window to check if it was truly a new day, “How much time did I sleep?”
“I'm sorry about that.”
“Yeah, I guess they can. But didn't that asshole try to kill you?”
“Seriously, Potter, why did we hate each other so much when we were younger?”
Harry stopped walking, his hands shyly gestured to Hermione to stop too, she did, a confused expression standing out on her face.
Dracoa accommodated himself, “If one Auror knows we…”
“Merlin's beard,” Draco eyes got wide, “You were a child, Harry, of course it stuck with you.  And who in their right mind makes a seven year old cook?”
“Draco cast his eyes to the ground, but he couldn't see anything in the darkness. "I'll find them later."
“You sound like a mother.”
“...Did you sleep the same amount as me?”
“Checking on me? Why?”
Draco aimed his wand at the running student, but Harry stopped him by grabbing his wrist, denying softly “It's fine.”
“Well, it has to be since,” she spoke in her most reprimanding tone possible, “I was talking to you about this assignment we have to do in Defense Against the Dark Arts. and it’s very important.”
“Couldn't agree more, but I would rather not have him in here,” Harry complained softly about the pain of his broken nose, but before healing himself he pointed his wand at the guy's chest, “Rennervate!”
Harry let out a small nod and got up carefully, observing how his shirt was getting stained by the blood that was dripping from his face, “I have to say, this is not the first time someone broke my nose, but yes, I'm okay.”
“How are you still sleepy?”
“It's not fine,” he mumbled, “he left you looking like a mess.”
Harry accepted the apologies, nodding, “Don’t worry. Just… don’t make a big deal out of this. I don’t have a chance.”
“Sleep.”
“Like fourteen hours? It was a lot. I don't know how you can sleep so much.”
Harry laughed but instantly winced at the pain, leaning on the tree behind him to search for support, “I'm going to break a record if my nose gets broken one more time.”
“Potter…” Draco tried to convince him subtly to change the subject, but Harry was a stubborn bastard and he was about to start complaining again if Draco didn't tell him, “Yes, it did. Only one though, It wasn't healed fast enough I'm guessing..”
Draco took a rock that was nearby and threw it into the lake, watching it disappear into the distance, “Thank you… Harry,” Harry grinned when hearing his name, and he was sure that now the blond boy was blushing hard because of the intimate moment they were having.
Draco huffed, playing with the rings that adorned his fingers, “It sounds horrible.”
Ginny nodded furiously with the brightest grin on her face, while Hermione and Ron just seemed surprised, of course, they were acting. They were trying to make their friend feel more comfortable, but it was crystal clear they believed it before Harry said it was the truth.
“It reached your neck? Merlin, it had to hurt a lot.”
“Then what?”
Harry lifted his head, staring at the blood pooling from his torso. , “Yeah, it’s really bloody,” he agreed, “in case you couldn't tell.”
“I haven't seen you at work in a few days. I wanted to find out if something happened to my partner.”
Draco couldn't help but laugh a little, “It was years ago. Why wouldn't I be okay?”
Draco arched an eyebrow, “Potter?”
“What? Sometimes people are insecure about their kissing skills.”
“We have seen you.”
Draco pushed him against the tree (Harry couldn't deny he quite enjoyed that) and asked a new question, this time sounding more confused rather than surprised, “Did you mean to say that?”
“We haven't seen each other in a long time. As Aurors we need to have a bond.”
“What makes you so interested? I don't get it.”
“Would you like to study with me for the Defense Against the Dark Arts exam?”
“Hermione… I would prefer to go alone, okay?”
“Even without magic? The Ministry wouldn't like knowing you performed magic in front of muggles.”
“Fine, just-” Harry gestured with a limp hand. “try and make it quick.”
Draco searched for Harry's glasses and handed them over to him, they were shining clean and looked more new than ever, “I fixed and cleaned them. They probably broke when one of the … assholes yesterday hit you.”
“Then stop barking and get some sleep with me.”
Fuck Draco Malfoy and his perfect hair, beautiful features and elegant moves.
Draco arched an eyebrow, the corner of his mouth quirking up in a smile, "I noticed," he said, rolling up his sleeves, and kneeling on the ground next to the sofa, "You look like a mess."
───────────────────────────────────────
“You know… Now it's my second bad memory with a knife, not really fond of them.”
“Draco… Can I kiss you?”
“Where is the injury?” he asked, siphoning the blood off the ground with his wand.
“What? why? two hours is nothing. How are you even alive?”
“Your house is much nicer on the inside," Harry said, trying to fill the awkward silence.
“Bloody hell, Potter.”
“Careful,” Draco said sharply, "the wound is only knitted. It'll still hurt."
“Really?”
“.....two hours.”
Draco nodded and they stayed in an uncomfortable silence until he yawned, gaining Harry's attention- if he slept like fourteen hours, how many did Draco?
Draco pointed his wand at the wound, forcing his arm to stop shaking as he began muttering an incantation that made Harry wonder if Malfoy was singing to him at that moment by the tone every word was pronounced, the wand tracing the long injury slowly, it seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing, coming from some knowledge buried deep down in his memory. The flow of blood got slower and there was less, provoking a breath of relief from Draco, the spell was repeated one more time before the wound started to knit itself, making Harry flinch in discomfort for the suddenly burning sensation in the area.
Harry tried to make himself more comfortable to carry on the conversation, shifting around the couch, “Did it… leave scars?”
“You didn't mind that earlier. When I was drowning on my own blood.”
“And you are planning to hold me?”
“Yeah, he did,” Harry laughed, but nodded anyway, “I’ll tell him.”
Harry shrugged, “I don't know. Something amongst those lines.”
“But that doesn't make sense,” Draco was expecting answers, but he wasn't going to get anything when Harry was looking at his lips every time he talked, “You react pretty fast to attacks.”
“Come on, let's get you inside," Draco sighed, "before someone sees.”
“I would have managed.”
“Shut up and kiss me, Malfoy.”
And the damn butterflies came again when he spotted him entering the Great Hall.
Harry smiled at him, and for one second he was sure he saw Draco's face getting subtly red.
Ron acted confused, “But you are Harry Potter! You are practically a legend! who wouldn’t like to be with you?”
He really wasn't giving up.
And of course, when the guy noticed his friends had left him alone, he ran to the castle so fast that someone could have thought something was chasing him.
After what it was a very magical moment they both cut the kiss, breathing heavily.
“I have a lot of wards to keep things warm,” Draco explained, slowly guiding Harry to the sofa, "mostly for when winter comes around since I'm generally a pretty cold person.
“Er… Yes? I have wanted to kiss you since the first day ” Harry clarified to Draco's shock, “And every time you get close to me I get nervous and I know is dumb because we were becoming very good friends but is something that was really fucking me up and-”
“Well, I'm glad. I would be worried if you were fond of them.”
“Touch you, dumbass,” Draco chuckled when he saw Harry blushing, “To heal you.”
Draco grabbed Harry's shirt collar and pulled him into a kiss.
Draco looked down stiff but hummed from Harry to continue what he was saying.
And before Harry could distract them and run, the biggest guy in the group pounced against him, falling both of them to the ground without a second to lose. Harry was trying to get up but it was hard when that person was two times his size and had also more muscle than him. The guy didn't have to waste much time until his fist crashed into Harry's face, who even with his nose bleeding was thankful that his glasses had fallen when they touched the ground.
“You slept on the floor?”
Hermione raised an eyebrow, “Well, that’s what you get after you were mean to Crookshanks last night, no help coming from me.”
Draco denied softly and sighed, maintaining the charm drained his energy sometimes, “It's okay. Stop worrying about stupid things.”
Of all the things Harry expected to hear, that was the last one he thought of. Mad at friends? He could see Hermione was troubled about the whole thing, she was acting uneasy and insecure, the total opposite of her whole persona.
“Oh, well,” one of the girls crossed her arms, “Rumor has it you have been spending a lot of time with Draco Malfoy.”
“Sweet,” He answered rolling his eyes, “Thanks. You are very good at healing.”
“Harry!” Hermione called him, running to keep up his pace, “Merlin, you’re fast. Where are you going?”
“Good.”
Harry glanced at the blond boy that was sitting alone at what used to be the Slytherin table (because now everyone could sit wherever they wanted) and thanked every spiritual being he could think of that he wasn’t looking at their table. If he did, Harry would die right there without having time to react.
Draco rolled his eyes, but the faint smile drawn on his lips couldn't lie.
Hermione blushed, ignoring the now amused Ronald Weasley that was watching her expression with too much interest, “You were going to say something, Harry. What was it?”
“I think we can both agree it's too early to talk about this, Harry.”
“This is no time for jokes, you git!” Draco rushed over, fumbling for his wand. “What did you do?”
“Fine,” he mumbled, “I do have a crush on someone, happy?”
The most fun thing to do with Draco was sitting under the big tree that was growing in front of the Black Lake, working on their homework and then talking about whatever they were thinking.
“Cuddled until we fell asleep?”
Hermione took her special edition of The Ministry of Magic; A guide and smacked Harry on the head with it, making a soft thump sound. He was about to complain when she shut him off with her finger.
“I think I'm okay,” Harry grunted, relying heavily on Draco to stand.
“Harry?” Hermione called his attention, it seemed like she had been speaking for the last few minutes but the boy wasn’t paying attention to her, “What’s on your mind?”
Harry furrowed his eyebrows, “I almost killed you. It 's not stupid.”
The rest of the group stopped cheering when a voice a few meters again shouted: “Stupefy!”
“Somebody once told me that we've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on.”
“ Knowing if I left some mark on you thanks to how irresponsible my actions were is something I deserve to know. Right?”
Harry patted the empty space next to him, “How much is a reasonable amount?”
And then Dracos free hand was grabbing Harry's face by his cheek, his other wand pointing at his nose, “Episkey,” the blood stopped dripping.
Harry knew exactly what he was talking about- the whole sectumsempra thing. He knew Draco could not have healed himself that time because of how badly injured he was at the time, but he assumed he had to learn how to treat his own wounds after it happened.
It was the wave of shame that hits someone when they notice their crush is staring back at them, or the tension when they are sitting really close and their thighs touch with each other. When someone says something funny and that person laughs big and loudly, and the poor unfortunate soul that's in love with them can't help but wish that smile was for them and only them. Yes, that kind of nervousness.
“And why is that?”
“Draco..?”
If Harry thought he had any idea about kissing- all of them were destroyed when Draco kissed him. It was such an overwhelming feeling that he hummed into their mouths, grasping Draco's shoulders. As they deepened the kiss, Harry felt how his eyes were becoming watery at the sensation of the cold hands holding him caressing his face.
When Harry woke up he felt weak, the type of weakness where you move a little and your body sends a big alarm reminding you you're going to faint if you try to move a lot. It was annoying to feel so useless when there was probably someone out there needing his Auror services.
Harry chuckled to hide the fact he was becoming as red as a tomato, “Thank you,” he scratched his neck, “I guess.”
“I thought after saving the whole Wizarding World you'll be smarter, Potter. He's a Death-Eater, remember?”
Harry was about to turn back and run to the Black Lake when Hermione grabbed his wrist, narrowed eyes scanning Harry, “Your crush is…. Malfoy?”
The girl rolled her eyes and hit playfully one of Harry’s arms, a smirk appearing on her lips, “Oh, c’mon, do not play the fool. I can read you like an open book.”
Maybe… he just had to wait for the right opportunity to take.
“Hey, Potter,” one of the guys called him, and Harry rolled his eyes because he knew he was one of the main assholes in his same year, “We were waiting for you.”
Harry was already closing his eyes, “I save my tiredness in a little box in my brain and then I set it free.”
Ron snorted, but still smiled a little after doing it, “Thank you for that, girlfriend.”
───────────────────────────────────────
“You think so?”
“I don't really know. I guess…. to make sure you're okay?”
“But here I am,” Harry tried to play it off, but it was noticeable the subject was affecting him somehow, “all okay.”
Could it mean something?
Harry had been fidgeting with a weird toy Ron had received from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes as a gift after he helped George with the store for a whole month, it was small and shiny and since nobody had any idea what it did, Harry got to keep it, it helped him with his nervousness. But, how could the boy who lived be nervous? After facing deathly experiences so many times?
“Let's do this the…. muggle way, shall we? You were raised by them, maybe it's more comfortable for you.”
“Thieves. They were trying to get into your house.”
“Yeah, that too, Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes.
But silliness couldn’t feel better.
“Thank you… for all of that, you know, saving me from these idiots.”
“I guess I was a little bit distracted when they attacked.”
Ah, yes. Harry hadn’t talked about the crush thing with his friends since the first breakfast in the Great Hall. He was sure Ginny had seen him walking with Draco one or two times, but Ron and Hermione just received the I have things to do explanation and Harry would then leave. After one week or two, it was okay, but a whole month had almost passed and they didn’t have any idea of what Harry was doing in his free time, they respected his privacy, but it was becoming weird not to see that much as they were used to.
“Oh, great! I’m going too, I miss spending time with you.”
“Potter. While I appreciate the concern,” and Draco coughed to hide the fact his heartbeat was louder than he expected it to be, “I am, in fact, fully able to defend myself.”
“Well, hello to you too, Ginny,” he spoke, trying to redirect the attention, “I didn’t know you were having breakfast with us today.”
Certainly, Harry didn't expect them to know. He and Draco had tried everything to be subtle, just because they knew not everyone would be happy about them getting along better. But why did these people care?
“It's okay. It doesn't hurt.”
At the end, Draco stopped trying to ignore the idea. “Fuck it,” he mumbled, closing his eyes and letting his head rest on Harry chest, hearing his heartbeat.
“Bullshit, where is it?”
Harry managed to see Draco's silhouette casting the spell before the guy on top of him flew and fell unconscious next to him, his friends staring at his motionless body with surprise. Draco was getting closer, and with each step he took the students acted more and more anxious, deciding at the end to run in different directions to escape from the cold gaze the boy was giving them.
Harry yawned and looked at Draco, who was sitting on the ground next to him, a blanket covering his legs- it wasn't really clear, but Harry could see the pillow laying on the floor and the rug wrinkled under it. Connecting all the dots was easy.
“That doesn't matter. Why were you outside of my house?”
At least he's alive.
He met Draco, the boy that was sitting next to him whose hair was shining down the sunlight.
“You're awake.”
Draco hesitated a bit before slowly sitting next to the man- he would notice he was looking a bit tired. Well, it wasn't easy looking extremely bright when you spent most of your night making sure The Chosen One didn't die on your couch.
Harry tried to laugh, but he felt dizzy instead- like the world had stopped for a moment before getting back on route. His eyelids dropped, and the last thing he saw before losing consciousness was the worried expression across Draco's face.
“Please.”
It felt natural.
Harry noticed the knots on his stomach one more time, but they felt more like an elephant stampede rather than butterflies, “Maybe.”
The injury was starting to bleed again, so Draco didn't waste any more time. The slash across his ribs had torn a hole in Harry’s robes, so Draco used his hands to widen the hole to get a better look at the area. By now, the blood was pooling again- and the way Harry was squirming like a fish out of water was making it worse.
“Oh, I mean… if you want, yes.”
“Ginny!”
Draco laughed, his head going back with it. It was the first time Harry had seen him laugh since the war, and he loved it so much he wanted to push him against the wall and steal his air in the most desperate kiss ever.
Harry opened his mouth to say something but he got cut off when Ron sat next to him, big dark circles under his eyes.
Draco staunched the bleeding with a flick of his wrist and sighed,  trying to assess the damage. How did I end up here? He asked himself for the hundredth time. Finding your Auror partner bleeding out on your driveway should be a strange sight, but it was one that Draco was all too familiar with.
“I'm really sorry...Draco,” Harry tried to sit correctly, groaning when he felt a pull to the side due to the wound, “Can I see it?”
Harry kept the silence for a minute, admiring the views that Hogwarts offered. It felt like home, this school was his home- and he had to leave it after this year. Everyone felt nostalgic after spending most of your time in a place and then leaving it, but there was so much more to it. Harry lived his most life-changing experiences there, he met the people that filled his heart.
“For me?” Harry looked around, noticing that everything felt a little bit...fishy, “Why?”
Draco smiled and rested his head on Harry's shoulder, the cold breeze coming from the lake made them shiver, but it didn't matter because both of them were genuinely happy after so much suffering. After so many sacrifices, being in love or enjoying someone’s company was a silly thought.
Harry yawned, “Yeah, pretty much,” he tugged again, making sure Draco stayed laying on top of him comfortably, “C'mon. Sleep.”
“What? No, I’m not mad at you or Ron.”
Harry quickly put himself back together and muttered a low Thanks while picking up his wand. Draco was still standing there, watching him.
“It hurts.”
...............
“Sounds like someone really wise told you these words.”
“Not really.”
“It is…” Harry commented, his impulsive and nervous personality gaining against his composure, “I’m sorry if my hand sweats.”
Draco felt himself getting angry, “How old were you?”
“Are you okay… Harry?”
“You alright?” Draco asked tentatively.
Hermione (who had been looking at Harry since he started to act more and more nervous) hit the table gently, drawing the attention to her, “Harry, if you do. You don’t have to tell us who it is, but…” she laughed softly, “remember you are a terrible liar.”
Draco’s breath hitches, it’s almost imperceptible, but Harry notices, oh he notices, and that gives him the courage to continue.
“And did it work?” Draco pants, snapping Harry back to reality. His smugness is back, but he also obviously wants to know.
“Yeah, take a look. Does it work?”
“I’ll have to open my own flower shop?” Draco tries, and Goodwin draws her mouth into a clear attempt to smile.
“What’s that?” Harry asked.
“Take as long as you need,” he breathes, relaxing back against the bed.
“What do you mean? We have to get married or we’re stuck like this. Merlin knows how long it’ll take before Pansy or Granger find another solution to this.”
“Thank you,” you manage to whisper, every part of your body tensing, ready to take flight or to yield to him, you’re not sure which.
I absolutely
“Let’s go to your place, yeah?”
Potter casts a lazy cleaning charm over them and rolls out of bed, summoning his clothes. Fucking wanker always showing off his wandless magic. He probably knows what a turn on it is for Draco. Draco’s not quite sure what it is, but there’s a weird stirring feeling inside his chest again, similar to the one he’s felt earlier when he’s been around Potter. Today it feels a bit more insistent though.
“I still don’t see what the problem is. You and I are having casual sex. In fact,
And you tell him how much you loathe him.
close friends during his stay here,” he says with a hint of a sneer.
“Fuck Draco, I’ll miss you so much. I’ll miss that dry sarcasm and your snarky wit.”
Bye, I guess?
“See, that’s the odd thing about this. Usually there’s a quicker process with this disease, it develops inside your body about one or two months before the flowers start to come out, but once they do start to come, they do so more and more often, much faster than what you’ve been telling us. Which often means that the roots are shallow.”
It does hurt, a bit, but in a good way, in a way that sends sparks of desire through your entire body. The stretch as he’s edging himself inside you, bit by bit, the way your body opens up for him, willingly taking the entire length of him in, the way you have to bite your fist to keep from screaming out, afraid that if you do he’ll stop this slow enjoyable torture.
Draco nodded. “That’s right, we deal with those things, as well as —”
Pansy looks utterly confused for a moment, but then her eyes widen and she straightens up a bit. “Wait, are you talking about that old curse where if you have penetrative sex before marriage, the guy gets stuck inside you?”
“Fuck, Harry, I was so scared when I came to and you were gone,” Draco said between kisses as he yanked Harry’s trousers down. “Seeing you with that buffoon, looking all smitten, was just…”
So the other day (the day I almost set our kitchen on fire) Draco was in his room, lying on his bed reading, and I came to tell him thank you for saving me today. So, I sat down on the bed, and I was still a bit shaky after that whole crazy experience so eventually I lay down beside him, and his arm was outstretched so I put my head on his arm, and we sort of… cuddled? As in, I even took off my glasses. I think I let my hand slip in underneath his shirt as well, not consciously, but it did, and he didn’t say anything about it. He was raking his hand through my hair and it felt so nice, and I snuggled in closer, because it was all so soothing and I was so comfortable. I could hear his heartbeat, feel it against my cheek, and when I tilted my head up a bit his lips brushed my forehead, and it felt so nice, like… like that’s what we’re supposed to do.
They hear the door close behind Ron, and then everything goes awkwardly quiet.
It’s a beautiful day. May is almost here and this early there’s still a chill in the air, making the colours seem crisp and fresh, and as soon as you step out of the gates you feel like you can breathe more freely, like you can shrug a thick layer of dust off your shoulders. The sky is clear and the sun is warming your face.
“Are you sure?” he says, his voice trembling.
“I dropped something, and it rolled under one of your bags.”
Harry leaned forward, running as fast as he could to catch up with Malfoy, and to his immense satisfaction he reached the top of the hill a mere foot before the git. He only had time to flash Malfoy a smug grin before Ms Allen blew her whistle and he had to turn around to go downhill, Malfoy pressed to his side. The next round, Harry initially thought that he could let Malfoy win this time, but when he saw Malfoy’s arse flexing as he ran, Harry had to run past him again, because it was too damn distracting. The third time, his muscles started to ache slightly from the lactic acid, but he wasn’t about let Malfoy win even one damn round.
(which Harry had figured out was basically hard liquor with various spices, taken in tiny shot glasses after you had sung a little song) and Draco was a bit flushed from the alcohol, his eyes open and clear. Harry had tried to hold back on the drinking, partly because they were still on an assignment, but mostly because he didn’t want to lose control around Draco and accidentally blurt out his feelings.
far gone yet, thank you very much. At least not for the moment.
“In the days when society revolved around farming, the midsummer night was believed to be one of the most magical nights of the year, where our world and the supernatural were extra close to each other,” Ebba told them with her voice lowered mysteriously. “Wonderous things were said to happen, and people were especially fond of making predictions about their love life.”
Harry would gloat at the fact that Blaise gets stuck with this task, if it weren’t for the severe breach of privacy and the prospect of having Blaise babysit him and Draco for the unforeseeable future.
“I… I see,” you say, trying to swallow. “Is there something wrong with that? Are you displeased with our work in the garden or with the medicinal plants?”
Draco shrugs, obviously trying to look like he couldn’t care less. “It came up.”
Potter’s words made her tear her eyes from the man.
“Well, Draco, all your results look fine, and as long as you feel ready you may be discharged in the morning. There aren’t a lot of people reported to have actually survived the Hanahaki Disease, especially such a severe case, so we’re not entirely sure what to expect now, but we do believe that recovery will be more beneficial at your own home. We’ll send a nurse over to you every day to check on you, and you will need to bring some blood replenishing and oxygen enhancing potions, and of course, Mr Potter will have to stay with you to help you recover and to make sure you’re not relapsing. I would advise as much skin on skin contact as possible, however,” she adds, holding up one stern finger, “no physically straining activities until we see enough improvement, understood?”
). It feels nice, it’s cooling him off slightly, but it’s not helping his swirling mind, nor the heat in his body.
Pansy’s sharp voice cuts through his thoughts like a blade, along with the tray she’s slamming down in front of him, and he winces. Somehow it feels comforting that she’s straight to the point as usual. He wonders fleetingly if she’ll stay the same even after he’s gone, but he quickly pushes it out of his mind.
Draco freezes, and for once the air caught in his lungs is not because there’s no room for it. “You told them?”
“Show me instead of telling me.”
There’s a moment of silence, and then quietly, almost inaudible, he says “Me neither.”
“Now, repeat after me: rosemary,” you say, pointing at the bowl with pin prick needles in it.
Another silent shake of his head, more vigorous this time.
Shit, I’m so bored. I wonder what Draco is up to.
“We… We kissed. And I felt him. And I… I touched him…
, and
Anyway, after the interview (that went smoothly all thanks to Draco) I started a sourdough base. I’ve looked up how to do it the proper way and bought special flour to get the best results. Draco laughed at me. Bet he won’t laugh when I have delicious bread and he doesn’t.
“Ok.” Draco stood, “I’ll uh… I guess I’ll be back then.”
It had been a chaste, soft kiss at first, until Harry had involuntarily made a sound almost like a moan, which had made Draco yank Harry by the front of his robes, turn them around, and press Harry up against the wall.
On Whit Sunday, the Prior asks you for a private word in his study. He looks at you serenely over his spectacles, but you get the feeling there is a grim reason he wanted to speak with you, because he looks like a snake ready to attack.
“Yes. If I didn’t know about your ridiculously Gryffindorishness, I’d think you were in Slytherin.”
He gave her a short wave and closed the door, leaning his forehead against the smooth surface.
Malfoy was lying on his back on his bed, reading
“Why?”
Potter jerked and tore his eyes from the man. “
Draco shifts on the bed, prodding Potter’s shoulder. “Hey, don’t fall asleep, I have to get back to work five minutes ago.”
would like to know why Blaise is here,” Harry says.
“Yes, Potter, a date. You know, where you get to know each other and flirt a little and if you’re lucky you get laid at the end of it.”
“Yes, professor Potter,” the class answered in unison.
Slowly, he slings his leg around yours, hooking you closer, looking at you questioningly, but you can only nod, you’re too gone for words, too wrapped up in your desire. Then he reaches down between you, taking both of you in one hand and you gasp so loudly it’s almost a scream, your head tipping back of its own will. He takes the opportunity to kiss you right below your jawline, his mouth hot on you, his hand wrapping firmly around you and the hardness of him pressing so deliciously against you, and all you can do it try to remember how to breathe, because all else is forgotten: your family, the monastery, your own name, God himself.
THAT WAS RATHER BRILLIANT!”
Draco cut himself off, because Harry, who had started to get dressed, had lost his balance while trying to put his underwear on and fallen with a loud thud and a grunt of pain.
“ … That’s what you think I do?”
Harry doesn’t look at you, his eyes are still fixed on the swirling water. “You go. I need some time alone.”
Potter rubbed his neck awkwardly. “Yeah, I know. Ginny told me to cut it out because it’d give you the wrong impression, but I guess… she’s safe, you know? We don’t have anything going on and we never will. But with you…”
“Well, I guess if he fell for it, everyone else will right?” Harry’s face drooped a bit at Draco’s statement.
And then they’re kissing, Draco’s lips dry but pliable against Harry’s, the tip of his tongue sliding along his bottom lip to coax Harry’s mouth open, and he willingly obliges. And soon Healers and nurses start flooding in as all the monitoring charms are set off. They’re tugging Harry by his shoulders, shouting at him to leave, to let go, but he blocks them out, because he’s unable to stop kissing Draco, refusing to let go of him, and just as he decides to cast a
“You’re on, Potter.”
Maybe this could even put a silver lining to this lockdown?
Draco huffed. “Yes, he says like he’s not already made me wear this ridiculously warm outfit, and he isn’t now expecting me to run around a giant phallus singing about a virgin riding a carousel.”
His vision turns blurry as he dry heaves for the second time, his entire body shaking with the effort of breathing, of coughing, of gasping for air. Sweat starts to break out on his forehead, and then his body convulses again as the content of his lungs spills out from his mouth into the clean basin. Gossamer white leaves, their veining a deep red, resembling thin blood vessels running criss crossed over the surface.
“What do you say, Harry?”
“Don’t. Fucking. Call me. A coward,” he snarls.
Draco pants into his ear, moaning words like “beautiful” and “feel amazing around me” and “
before marriage. To avoid unwanted pregnancies and illegitimate children.”
“Mmm, thanks for the reminder, Sheila,” Malfoy said, and Harry noticed that he received an even filthier look from her. “Would you mind helping me out with the stretching, Potter?” Malfoy continued, turning to Harry. “Make sure I get all the
Defeated, you collapse on the ground, your legs unable to carry you anymore. So this is the end, then, you think as you slowly push yourself up to a sitting position. This is how you will meet your destiny: leaving your old life behind, seeking out a new truth, a new path, but without being reunited with Harry. It hurts more than you can admit even to yourself that he’ll never know you tried to come for him, that he was worth more to you than any reward in heaven. You draw your knees up to your chin as  tears start spilling from your eyes, a loud sob escaping you.
“What are the two of you on about?” Harry said, growing more and more irritated. “How did you not see
“Hey!” Harry said, batting his arm. “No judgement!”
“Yeah, I think Harry’s not entirely keen on this either, but you don’t hear him complaining, do you?” Weasley chimed in.
Harry gives him a quick kiss before he leaves, pausing a bit because Draco tastes sweet and heavy, like… like flowers.
Harry took the opportunity to continue searching for his wand, and after he located it, he started summoning his clothes.
In the few weeks that Harry is under your care, you realise you’ve come to appreciate his company more and more. There’s something about him that speaks to you, and he feels more like an equal than any of the other inhabitants of this monastery, even though you’ve known them for much longer than you’ve known him. Even when you both disagree on something, you feel a connection to him, as if he understands you on a far more profound level than anyone has ever understood you, and you soon notice a constant longing to be near him.
“Well, if not, I guess I can always fall back on Daphne,” Harry says, yanking his trousers up. “She seemed up for more fucking last time, and at least she let me stay the night.”
“But… I don’t understand?”
in the direction of Malfoy’s ensuite bathroom. “They’re still looking for us, and no one has thought about coming here to search.”
“Fuck, yes,” Harry whispers into the sheets, and then he arches his back on a moan because Draco is rubbing his cock along his crack, nudging slightly at his hole. He’s not prepared, not even with a spell, but he doesn’t want to ask for it. He likes Draco claiming him like this, and the tiny part of him that is still conscious files the information that Draco is quite possessive away for future reference. Maybe he can use this later, to goad Draco into fucking him rougher. Maybe he can use it now?
“No. No, no,” said Harry, trying to wrap his head around Ron’s words. “The um, the ‘love’ part?”
“I want you to lay me on my back and press your cock deep inside me, and I want you to be wearing those while you do it.”
When you open your eyes, Harry’s watching you with a thoughtful expression, sucking his bottom lip into his mouth.
A faint flush appeared on Draco’s cheeks, but his voice was casual when he spoke. “Would I notice if I lived with an erumpent and it suddenly disappeared? Of course I noticed, Potter, don’t be daft.”
He stills, stroking the hair out of your face and tilting your chin up to make you look at him, blinking.
But Draco remains on the bed long after his Floo has died down, work completely forgotten. He stays entirely still, his body going cold after the warmth of Potter’s body, and the only thing he manages to do is stare at the hellebore flower in front of him for what feels like hours. He recognises it from his childhood—it’s a flower his mother loved to have in their garden because it’s one of the first flowers to bloom, even when it’s snowing outside. He’s always associated it with the first signs of spring, new beginnings. But this one feels like a sign of something sinister.
“Come, join me,” he says, grabbing your hand and yanking it, making you lose your balance and fall straight into his lap.
“Your…?”
“So, Daphne told me the two of you fucked.”
“Are you…? Can I do anything? Do you want something to drink?”
“Oh my, Potter, I’m so sorry, did I distract you again?” he said, putting a hand over his heart, and Harry realised he’d been standing completely still for an entire minute by now, still holding a hollowed out half of an orange. His face heated at the realisation and he quickly turned away with the pretense of throwing the orange rind away.
“It has been brought to my attention that you and Harry the pilgrim have become, should I say,
“They took him in a few hours ago. Pansy called Blaise in a panic, and Blaise told Ron about half an hour ago, and Ron told me. I think it’s something really bad.”
It takes several seconds for Harry to realise that she’s talking to him, he’s entirely too busy falling into a black hole, and has to shake his head to clear it. “Um, no. No, I just heard someone mention it. In my shop. The other day.”
Ginny looks utterly bewildered. “But Harry, haven’t you heard?”
cabin. And don’t you dare snoop in any of my bags!”
You want to wreck him, you need to break him, tear him down, piece by piece. You want to show him his rightful place, because you can’t admit to yourself that he’s already got your heart.

“I cannot
“That’s the spirit.”
He helps you carry them all outside, scooping up the dirt and watering the tiny plants with fresh water from the reservoir. They cower under the spray but soon stretch up, looking like they’re turning their faces to the warming rays of the sun and enjoying themselves. You laugh quietly to yourself at the thought of them as miniature human beings, and when you look up at him he’s smiling, his face open and joyous.
“What, like a shrink?” someone said from the back.
He knew it was the raw magic and emotion from the process spilling over, but he felt as if he’d been slapped, and he shouted, “I’m trying to help! Do you think this is fun for me? It’s not. But I’m trying to help catch those bastards too. I’m sorry I’m the unspeakable with the right training and family history to pose as the awful fucking person that would drug a person in order to force a bond. But I am.”
Draco shook his head. “Can you imagine?” he said through bursts of laughter, “Can you imagine Robards face when we tell him what happened?”
It took a moment for the chattering to die down, and Draco cleared his throat again to regain his composure. “Right, where was I?” he muttered, taking out his notes from his pocket and rifling through them.
But one look at Draco made Harry realise that he needed to take the initiative now. He leaned closer, murmuring into Draco’s ear. “This thing that you want, does it include a pining fool who can’t take his eyes off you even when you’re behaving like a prick and complaining about how people celebrate the summer solstice?”
Malfoy’s gaze turned harder, more calculating, and Harry suddenly felt like he was becoming the underdog.
“Right… rig— oh.”
“Oh Draco. Oh, you feel so good,” he whispers wetly against your throat.
You feel your cheeks heat, and you feel his gaze on you as you reach out to take the cloth off the gash, and you notice that his breathing has become shallower, quicker. When your fingers graze the skin on his hip he gasps, his stomach tensing, and you can see goosebumps appearing.

,” he said finally. “
“Sir, do we file our request for time off for our honeymoon here, or do we take it with your secretary?”
“This isn’t the time to go into it,” Draco said. “It’s nearly eleven, Harry. There won’t be any way for us to test the theory if the hostages in question aren’t even awake to show it.”
“You need to calm down. Your emotions are all over the place. Projecting feelings worse than you did in school like that is going to end the investigation far faster than any argument we’d have.”
look at me like that. I understand that the mental exertion was more than you can handle at the moment.”
“No, I heard you the first time. I was just astounded that they didn’t tell me anything when
“I didn’t like it either. I didn’t push too hard, did I?” Draco ran his fingers over Harry’s face a little frantically, checking his temperature, down to his neck and wrist to check his pulse. “I know your experience with Occlumency is decent, but then, only against someone who was sharing the same link and had an equal disadvantage. Against others…you aren’t as proficient....” He summoned a calming draught from his bag and a bottle of water, wordlessly handing them to Harry.
” He rose up from his chair so quickly that it almost toppled backwards. “
“Draco. Draco, please.” Pansy is by his side now, throwing her arms around him, rocking him slowly, her tears wetting his cheek. “It’ll be fine, it’ll be fine, love,” she whispers.
Draco coughed. “I thought that would be something the two of us were experts in.”
And again.
“Cough up flower petals?” Hermione asks, and Rose takes the opportunity of her lack of attention to grab the bib and throw it on the floor.
“Harry James Potter, as I live and breathe.”
“You don’t have to tell me, Harry. But I do hope you know that you can trust me.”
” Ron shouted triumphantly. “Who’s the bad friend now?”
“Oh that would be
This is it, he thinks as Pansy helps him get up. His verdict is here. For some reason he feels strangely calm. He shakes off Pansy’s attempt to support him as he walks into the office. He’s not
The dance floor is packed with people. It’s hot and sweaty and Harry can’t dance for shit, but he wants to be close to Malfoy. Harry feels himself constantly drawn to him, and he wants Malfoy to dance up to him, wants to grind against him. But Malfoy keeps his distance, the bloody tease. Based on his smug smile, he’s obviously noticed Harry trying to catch his attention, but he never approaches him, never makes a move. It’s extremely annoying and not at all what Harry had imagined when he agreed to tag along, and eventually he gets tired of feeling like a Hippogriff trying to do ballet and gives up.
When we were in school, he probably would’ve thought I loved this kind of attention, but since we became flatmates he’s learned to read me better I think, and he was actually the one who offered to help me with the interviews and official statements a few months ago.
Draco flopped the down on the couch and pulled Harry up for a hard kiss, all tongue and teeth, nipping at his lips, tasting the pre-come in his mouth. “Bed. Now.”
And… and then we sort of ended up having sex. Not… not full on penetrative one’s cock up the other’s arse, but… some friendly hand jobs sort of. I don’t even know how it started, or, well if I think about it, it was that we were goofing around and I accidentally brushed my hand against his crotch, and… I could feel him through his trousers and he was hard and getting rapidly harder. And then I heard myself say “Would it be super weird if we wanked each other off?” and he shook his head vigorously, and before I knew it we had both shoved our pants and trousers down and were
“Well… the trust issues are one aspect of why I wanted to wait. But also…” Draco starts, turning away again and curling in on himself slightly. “I’ve used other things, as you know, and I’ve even started it a few times… I mean, to have someone… but… I’ve always backed out, because I couldn’t shake that thought of someone getting stuck inside me, and… it made me tense up so I had to put a stop to it.”
The pristine white of the lily of the valley. The hopeful yellow of the narcissus. The innocent pink of the honeysuckle.
Pansy turns to him, mouth opened in shock. “What?”
He turns to you, wrapping and unwrapping a stem of grass around his fingers. “I don’t… I don’t regret what we did either.”
Like he’s going to die.
, Draco thinks for a split second before he stomps that thought out of his mind. That’s not what they have, he does
“What?”
I had burned myself pretty badly on the oven mitts, but he took care of that as well. I don’t know where he learned those healing spells, he’s probably known them since he was a child, but he cast them on me and my hand got really warm, in a nice way. It was like his magic was wrapping around me and soothing the pain, more than the actual spell, it was like it was
“Gawain, relax, the vein in your forehead is about to burst.” Kingsley Shacklebolt was propped up on Robard’s desk, seemingly calm with a secretive smile on his face. “Harry, Draco, good to see you again.” He shook hands with each of them.
Draco handed Harry the map back and then shoved him none too kindly on his way to the bathroom. Ignoring the blaring sign in his head that said not to, he threw a cleaning Charm over himself.  They had a job to do. Throwing off the invasive scrubbed feeling all over him, Draco threw his uniform on.
Now that Harry looks at him properly he does seem rather pale, his hand now grasping around his throat instead.
“No.”
“I have no idea what you mean,” Harry said, arching his back as far as he could when he went into the upward dog for the last time. “Unless — mmm, that’s the spot — “ he said as he bent into the downward dog, “unless you find this… distracting?” He made sure to push his bum out as far as he could when he did the half lift, and Malfoy growled lowly. Harry folded himself, happy that this position made it impossible for Malfoy to see his grin, but gave him what Harry knew was a glorious view of how flexible Harry was.
You shake your head, deciding that what’s done is done, and you’ll do better from now on.
“ … I mean… “
You stand up so abruptly you almost lose your balance again, because you can’t listen anymore. You can’t stand to hear anymore of this, this
There’s still something Harry can’t quite grasp with this thing, and so he thinks about their situation for a while, because, well, there isn’t much more else he can do right now.
“Because she told you this is my room?”
“Don’t go. Please don’t go, Harry.”
“Breathe, Harry,” he says gently, and Harry exhales on a rush, realising he’s been holding his breath in anticipation of what is to come. Draco leans forward to stroke the hair out of Harry’s face, his hand lingering warmly on his cheek. “You need to breathe to relax, darling. I’ll take it slow, I promise.”
Potter looks both relieved and morose when he finally meets Draco’s gaze, and Draco will never know how a rejection can be so casual, when Potter apparently knows what the outcome is. There’s no remorse in Potter’s voice, only pity, and Draco realises this is what he’d been expecting if he ever were to let Potter close. This is exactly why he’s kept his distance, this is exactly why he doesn’t do feelings, and then his cursed body had to go and betray him like this.
“Right, right. Thanks Pansy,” Harry mumbled as he carefully peeled the tape from the paper, both so he wouldn’t tear it and so he could busy himself with the task instead of thinking about how Draco was holed up in St Mungo’s on Harry’s birthday.
Harry hated everything about Draco in that moment. Every atom in that man’s body was worthless to Harry as far as this investigation went. How could one stand back with the evidence that they had and just let it happen again?
And right now I want to go into the living room and bring up the weather or something else stupid just to annoy them.
When you wake up, your body is aching and you realise you’ve been crying.
“I thought we had that planned already. We pretend to be engaged to be married, madly in love because you’re under a love potion so I can get in contact with the persons responsible for the more shady things happening here,” Draco said while rummaging around in his suitcase.
He’s able to hide it from his friends by excusing himself to the bathroom every time he feels an attack approaching, but it’s always worse during or after he’s seen Potter. He often manages to hide it from him as well, but since Potter doesn’t have the boundaries a normal person has, he’s managed to walk in on Draco right after an attack to find blood and flowers in the basin before Draco has had time to vanish them. With time, Potter’s initial amusement turns into obvious horror, and Draco suspects that it’s only a matter of time before he figures out what’s going on.
You’re entirely speechless. Who knows? Who told him? What will he do to you?
“I’m sorry it took me so long to realise,” you whisper, feeling tears of your own forming in your eyes. “But I do love you, Harry.”
“What?” Harry said, pausing to look into Draco’s eyes.
Potter had apparently also had enough of the pounding music and the throng of sweaty people, and was now casually sauntering up to Draco. Draco’s stomach did a funny swooping motion, and even though he wanted to play it cool, he had to look away.
You scoff.
His words make you moan, the internal image of him so arousing as instinct takes you over and you rock back to meet him.
“Could be because I put an obliviation spell on the place to make everyone coming here forget what they were looking for,” Malfoy said, appearing in the doorway, with those joggers hanging on his hips. Those joggers that Harry knew the texture of by heart now. Those joggers that Harry had ripped off more times than he could count these last two days since Malfoy had apparated them here after their wrestling match had developed into a kissing match.
, and eventually Harry had resorted to casting a silencing spell. But what was even more embarrassing was that Harry’s body had responded to those noises, and if he allowed himself to think about it, he wanted to hear them again, wanted to be the one to make Malfoy sound like that.
I asked him if he wanted to sing that song he played me that one time, or maybe something else, but he just mumbled something about the book club and left.
I just, I get so sad thinking about how I’ll lose him, we’ve become really close lately and I honestly feel that he’s the only one who truly knows me, and… we just… fit? Or we used to. I don’t know anymore. And I don’t know if I can talk to him about this. Or
Ginny eyed him in astonishment, swiping a stray strand of hair off her face. “Don’t even think about it, Draco,” she said. “I’ll be taking the couch of course, since I’m crashing your holiday.
“Is this…? We don’t have to if…” he says, his voice trembling, and you know that you wouldn’t be able to stop even if you wanted to. This is the moment of no return, the moment that will forever change you, because you’ll never be the same after this. You’re about to cross a line now, and you don’t even want to look back.
