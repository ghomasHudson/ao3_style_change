Unsurprisingly, Molly promptly offered her help to Narcissa as well, which the latter politely declined, saying that she had plenty of aid from the elves. When Molly bristled slightly, a look of mild exasperation flitted through Narcissa’s eyes, gone so quickly Severus wouldn’t have caught it if he hadn’t known the woman so well, and she conceded that Molly join her to check on the dinner preparations.
. He would not let anyone in here right now, and he’d definitely not go outside. That door was to remain
Most Gryffindors gained fame through winning some battle, waging some war or similarly bold and brave deeds. Ravenclaws tended to be scholars, famous for breakthroughs in magical theory or wand-lore or something like that. Not all of them, mind; there was one in particular, Henry Moretz, who became famous for defending a village from a beast by drawing its attention to himself until the villagers could flee, which was a rather Gryffindor move in Harry’s opinion. Hufflepuff had mostly produced healers and philanthropists, but even from the house that valued kindness had come some bad ones.
Harry snorted and shook his head. “What I would give to see that, but no. We just talked about a few things that were bound to come up eventually. How he’s treated me in the past, how he’s treated my friends. He explained a little more about his history with my— with James Potter, and with my mother. It helped me make sense of a lot of things, but it also begged new questions. Mostly I’m conflicted about his character. I want to give him a chance, I want to like him—and I’ve started to like him, in a way, but there are things about him that I can’t ignore and I can’t approve of.”
He gave Blaise a nudge, whispered “Coming?” and they were off. During the class, Draco did his best to ignore Hermione, who wasn’t half as sneaky about the glances she kept throwing him. It took considerable self-control for Draco not to roll his eyes. For the fact that she was supposed to be the brightest witch of her age, she could be rather dense sometimes. He’d have to talk to Harry about it—it wouldn’t do to keep up their charade only to have Harry’s friends give it all away because they had as much subtlety as an Erumpent during mating season.
—in his mind. For two years he’d built and enjoyed a relationship with James’ best friend who had accepted him like a son. And now, within barely more than a week, he’d lost Sirius, learnt that the man he’d loved as a father—even if only in memory—was
“Harry,” Remus began, looking rather miserable, “I know this is quite a shock, trust me I’m just as shocked as you are. We all are. I—”
As a result, Harry spent the entirety of Saturday in his dorm, periodically messaging Draco through their linked journals and reading Severus’ old Potions book. His father had grudgingly allowed him to keep it, on the condition that Harry asked him about any spells he found in there before trying them. Most of the notes were things Harry already knew from Severus’ teachings over the summer, but there were more than just a few spells hidden in the margins that he had never heard of before. He assumed that Severus had invented them himself, like he had Sectumsempra.
Harry shifted, extracting himself out of Draco’s arms, eliciting an offended grunt from him. He laughed softly, and Draco felt his lips brush briefly against his forehead.
Severus tried to speak, but it took him several attempts to even make a sound. It was good enough in Harry’s book.
The portrait immediately stopped screeching and gasped instead, eyes bulging so much Harry half expected them to pop out of their sockets any second.
“An incredible understatement, but I’ll accept it,” said Draco, resting his forehead on Harry’s chest, a smile tugging on his lips.
Remus frowned. He hadn’t even thought about them going back to school at some point. They’d be facing a quite mixed response, he assumed.
“I mean, yes, but it’s still impressive. You seem to be rather comfortable with it already,” she said. There was something in her voice Harry couldn’t quite place, an edge he hadn’t heard before.
The mere thought of being in a tight space somewhere, hiding, with Harry made a familiar heat pool in Draco’s abdomen. The things he could do to Harry in a secluded alcove somewhere, the things they’d already
His train of thought about Slughorn was interrupted when Harry’s pull suddenly changed direction and Draco was being shoved into the train restroom—well, looks like he’d been honest with Blaise after all. The momentum made Draco stumble against the sink in the magically enlarged room as the hand on his wrist disappeared and the lock clicked shut.
Snape stayed quiet, however, simply staring at Harry with a scrutinising look as the silence between them stretched uncomfortably. It took Harry extreme amounts of self-control to keep from fidgeting. Snape’s face was unreadable, black eyes glittering as they kept staring each other down.
If Ron caught the hint, he didn’t show it — and honestly, that meant he probably hadn’t caught it. Harry reminded himself to stay calm.
Narcissa inclined her head, before standing up and clearing the table. Remus gave him an approving smile. Seemed like he’d given the right answer.
Remus shrugged, taking a casual step closer to him, then another. He heard Severus’ heart react, which only encouraged his own to accelerate as well.
Albus’ eyes lit up. “Why, that’s wonderful news! His refusal, of course, not Voldemort’s intention to recruit the boy. I gather you’ve come up with a plan?”
Remus gave his shoulder a light squeeze. “Sirius was as much Lily’s friend as he was James’ friend, and the same is true for me. But besides that; Sirius didn’t love you because you were James’ or Lily’s son, he loved you because you are a wonderful young man, Harry. In the three years since I’ve known you you’ve grown and achieved so much. You’re generous, kind and strong. I care for you because of who you are, not because of who your parents were. And I’m certain Sirius would’ve said the same.”
he thought wryly. When Blaise was a few steps further down the corridor, Draco turned so the notebook would be shielded from his view if he looked back and moved to open it again—and almost jumped as he felt something touch his arm. A hand wrapped around his wrist, causing him to flinch and instinctively pull away, until his brain finally caught up with the situation.
As he was trying to convince himself of it, Draco began to stir sleepily, effectively drawing Harry’s attention away from the Severus-issue.
Albus strode in with a smile. “Ah, I see the castle cooperated as anticipated. Are you content with the outcome?”
Harry’s lesson had begun at seven. Surely it couldn’t take much longer, right? They had agreed to meet at nine on the assumption that two hours were already longer than a regular double-period class. Draco then had assumed that Harry would most likely be done early. He’d been wrong.
They lapsed into silence and Harry snuggled closer into Draco’s embrace. Perhaps a locking charm hadn’t been the worst idea after all.
“I wanted to surprise you,” he repeated, cheeks darkening further. “You were so upset about having to keep this—us—a secret, I thought maybe a convenient way to stay in touch would cheer you up a bit.”
Just as Harry opened his mouth to reply, Ron’s face darkened and he added, “It’s because you were surrounded by Slytherins all summer, they’re far too comfortable with things like that.”
He forced himself to slow down and draw more air into his lungs. His heart slowly calmed down again as the images faded. He gave Severus a watery smile and picked up his wine glass, taking another sip. The slightly sweet taste of it spread in his mouth, grounding him.
“I’ve already mentioned in my letter that I have something to tell you all, but I’m honestly not entirely sure where to start,” he admitted.
“I’m not coming downstairs,” he declared, tone stubborn. There was a short pause before Severus spoke again.
“Wotcher, Harry! Blimey, you look even more different than the last time I saw you,” she said with open amazement, before quickly adding, “Handsome, though! It’s a good look on you.”
“Ah, but Narcissa tells me so are you,” countered Remus and watched with delight as Severus blushed. “How come you’ve never told me about Lucius Malfoy before?”
He tried to tune Remus out, he really did. In fact, he wasn’t exactly sure why he’d been stupid enough to even walk back into Harry’s room after his mother had laughed in his confused face and told him that Remus might as well not repeat himself and sent him back upstairs.
“Theo gets them too,” he explained, running one hand up and down Harry’s back. “I caught him once in the middle of an attack, back in second year. I had no idea what to do, so I got Madam Pomfrey. She explained that he was having a panic attack and then helped him to calm down. Ever since, whenever he gets panicky he asks me to pinch him, because that sometimes pulls him out before it really starts. And if it doesn’t work, I stay with him and do what Madam Pomfrey did, and it usually helps.”
“Oh, well then another time,” she said, sounding disappointed. Her smile returned though when she turned to Harry, saying, “Bye, Harry, take care of yourself!”
Nevertheless, he forced himself to break the seal and pull out the letter, unfolding it with slightly shaking hands.
Severus smiled as he closed his eyes again, giving Harry’s hand a weak squeeze. It was enough. Suddenly exhausted, Harry stepped back and collapsed into a chair. In the blink of an eye, Draco was crouching at his side, anxiously peering into his face, his hand on Harry’s cheek.
Weasley just stared at him as if he’d grown a second head. Then his eyes fell on Draco and darkened. He opened his mouth angrily, but Harry cut in before he could say a single word.
Harry, thank Merlin for stubborn Gryffindor bravery, managed to conjure an expression of mild confusion onto his face and innocently asked, “What?”
After an excruciatingly long time, the feast came to an end and Albus rose from his high-backed chair to address the school. He dismissed the shocked gasps at the sight of his marred hand with barely a sentence, then spoke at length about a variety of joke products that Filch had demanded to be banned. Only once Albus introduced Horace Slughorn as the new Potions Master did Severus begin to pay attention again.
Once Harry’s orgasm was definitely through, he pulled off and wiped his chin, before kissing his way up Harry’s body. Now that his attention wasn’t occupied with giving his first blowjob ever anymore, he became painfully aware of his own erection again. Reaching down, he began palming himself as he planted a hard kiss on Harry’s lips.
, I guess. You only did what you had to do. We’re just worried about you, because, well, you’ve changed.”
Harry looked thoughtful, then a slow grin spread on his face as he replied, “Alright, sure. Same rules as always, the match ends if either one is disarmed or stunned.”
“Quidditch Captain! Harry that’s amazing, congratulations!” He beamed at Harry for a second, before his face suddenly fell and turned into a scowl. “Oh no, that means Slytherin has to train double this year, brilliant.”
The fourth floor turned out to be by far the neatest, with Remus residing in Sirius’ old room that had been entirely refurbished. The empty bedroom next to it was just as clean and organised, as if waiting for its inhabitant to arrive any minute.
But Draco apparently didn’t need words, as he slowly edged closer to the bed, carefully keeping his distance. Remus smiled inwardly at how much courage it must cost Draco to even enter the room, all for Harry. He nudged the bedcover trapped under them with his snout, flicking his eyes to Harry again. Draco understood. With a whispered spell, he conjured another blanket, before cautiously creeping closer until he was able to cover Harry with it. He looked like he was about to hurry away, when Harry let out a soft sigh, snuggling into the blanket and deeper into Remus’ side, as a smile spread on his sleeping face. Draco froze, his face speaking louder than any words ever could.
With that she left, closing the door behind her. Severus remained in his chair for a few moments, wondering how Albus would react to Minerva storming his office with questions. He chuckled. Too bad he couldn’t be there to see that, it would be a sight to behold.
“Don’t beat yourself up,” Remus cut in, giving Narcissa an exasperated look. “I didn’t see it either. Not until last night, when Draco
“The potion won’t suddenly stop working, if we had messed it up it wouldn’t have worked in the first place. I’ll ward the door again from the inside if you’re so worried, you can even ward it from the outside if you want.”
“That’s Cousin Gia,” Blaise laughed. “She sings, too. She kept telling me that she almost joined a travelling group of performers instead of going to work for the MMI.”
Harry chuckled and took the potion without arguing. The effect was immediate and the ringing in his ears receded a little. He felt stronger again.
Only once Severus’ scent had finally faded almost completely did Remus’ mortification catch up with him. Severus had seen him
“Of course, of course. Well, as I mentioned back then, the group will need an adult supervisor. Now that you and Harry seem to be on good terms, I thought maybe you would want to take that position? It would barely be any effort, Harry appears to be quite competent as a teacher—”
“Oh please, don’t pretend you give a shit about my feelings, Ron,” he snapped angrily. “You want me to break up with him because you don’t like him, nothing more and nothing less. Were you maybe hoping it was already over? I haven’t forgotten what you said earlier. We will make it work, no matter how difficult it is.”
“I don’t want to do that,” answered Severus, though his voice had gone much quieter now. “I never meant to reject any of you like that and I’m sorry. Can you believe me when I say that I’ll do my best not to repeat such a thing?”
“Show me,” he whispered, finally moving his hands away to take hold of Harry’s face instead, peering intently into those unbelievably sad eyes. “Please.”
A twinge of guilt twisted Harry’s gut. She was right. At least he’d be surrounded by friends at Hogwarts; Narcissa and Remus would stay at Grimmauld Place, alone. He got off the couch and wrapped his arms around her. She returned his embrace, gently patting his back.
“And I do not mean to belittle your training with Remus in the slightest, but I still do believe it essential for you to also have some additional instruction from me.”
Albus regarded him for a moment, then nodded minutely. “You may bring the Malfoys to Grimmauld Place. However, should their presence there interfere with Harry’s training we must find another solution. And I must ask that Narcissa makes an Unbreakable Vow to ensure her loyalty—just in case.”
to be my son,” Severus snarled. “Not when he has Remus and Molly who love him like he’s their own blood.”
He kept his attention on his defence now, as Harry hailed spells on him. Strong spells. Strong enough that Severus felt his magic seep from him after barely a few minutes, and he hadn’t gotten in more than a few sporadic attacks himself.
Remus frowned at him and Draco’s heart sank. Would he forbid Harry to go? Even though Severus was Harry’s father, Remus was currently acting as his guardian, or at least that’s what Harry had told Draco.
To say that Severus was right with that assessment would’ve been an understatement. The Dark Lord was mildly insane on his best days, but now he barely showed any traces of sanity, as he raved about pure-blood superiority, how the Ministry had to be cleansed and how he would soon destroy Albus Dumbledore, so nobody would stand in the way of his rule over the wizarding world. It wasn’t like he had never said those things before, in fact they were all fairly routine raves from the Dark Lord—no, it was the way he ranted, the frantic undertone in his voice, the glee when he spoke of rounding up muggleborns to rid the wizarding society of their impurity, that gave Severus cold shivers.
“No, you didn’t! He was possessed by Voldemort and you just defended yourself,” argued Hermione, sounding desperate.
say he was destined to kill Voldemort. A familiar sensation of dread was gripping him, as memories from the Ministry threatened to overwhelm him.
“I thought he was dead,” he said softly, sounding much younger than Remus had ever heard him. “For a moment, I thought he was dead. I didn’t expect it to feel so horrible. But I can’t lose anyone else, Remus, I just can’t. Even after all our crappy history, despite every single bad thing that happened between us, I can’t lose him. How fucked up is that? Just because we’re related by blood? As if shared blood had any emotional value.” He scoffed. “If it did, my life should’ve been extremely different. No, shared blood means
“Mostly I attended social gatherings or organised them myself. I helped Lucius with the family ledgers, supported his aspirations at the Ministry through my own political connections. Those connections had to be cultivated and maintained—which happened largely at said social gatherings. Any time that wasn’t spent on networking or business—” She looked pensive, gazing into empty space. “I liked to tend the gardens sometimes, though Lucius never approved of it—he always insisted that was house-elf work. There wasn’t much to do there either otherwise. Books worked as a time-filler if there was no tea party to go to and no shopping to be done.”
“Perhaps they will do so more quickly if you do not provide them with such delicious dramatics to begin with. You have found a rather spectacular way to spend time with your father I’ve heard.”
“Severus,” Dumbledore said, his voice sounding alarmingly weak, “I’m afraid I have been foolish and require your assistance.”
, his mind supplied, and a wave of warmth went through him, finally loosening his chest up enough for him to suck in a real breath.
“You’re right. I will talk to him after lunch,” he promised, trying to reassure himself just as much as Remus.
Harry gestured for her to proceed, and Narcissa called for three of her house-elves. With three soft pops, the little creatures appeared promptly in the library, bowing deeply to Narcissa.
Draco smiled, then quickly added, “You’ll get your actual gift tomorrow, but I wanted to give you this in private—”
Phew, was about time to have some of these conversations. Good thing Harry has Narcissa looking out for him, she really doesn’t miss a thing.
“Yes, I used it,” Severus cut into Draco’s rapid fire questions. “It worked as any other shampoo would work, yes I liked the smell, and I wouldn’t know what to change.”
Well, that was…not better, if not worse. Harry tensed next to him and Draco gave his hand a gentle squeeze as they settled down.
It was a delight to watch realisation bloom on Harry’s face, followed by a mix of relief and pure, unbridled joy. Draco couldn’t help himself; he closed the distance between them and kissed him again. He felt him smile against his lips, a real, bright, wide smile, and it made him giddy.
“Now tell me, what can’t be a coincidence?” asked Draco, wrapping an arm around Harry and resting his chin on his shoulder.
He gave a sharp laugh and replied, “As if Albus would’ve let me go anywhere he couldn’t keep a permanent eye on me. He speaks of trust, but let’s be honest; Albus doesn’t trust anyone besides himself. Have you spoken to him about the mission he gave me?”
“Lord Potter and Lord Black, hm?” he teased, handing the parchment back to Harry. “Quite the titles for an almost-sixteen year old. I see you’ve already stocked up on suitable attire.”
their time together, which frankly impressed Remus if he thought back to how he and Sirius had been back at that age. James had nearly lost his mind around them sometimes. Once more he wished times could be as simple as back then again. Even though, if he was truly honest with himself, times hadn’t been simple back then either.
In the end, Harry had to admit that there seemed to be more dark witches and wizards coming out of Slytherin compared to the other three houses, but there also seemed to be more good ones. There were just more famous Slytherins in general, and the reasons for their fame were more diverse than in the other houses.
After the disaster at the Ministry of Magic, the Dark Lord had summoned his followers, to blow off steam if nothing else. As most times, Severus had suffered most at his hands—the joys of being the Dark Lord’s favourite. His bones still ached from the Cruciatus curses he’d endured and he desperately wished to sleep.
“Yes, I imagine you are,” the Dark Lord responded, stepping away from Severus and lifting his wand. Severus steeled himself for another Cruciatus but it didn’t come. What came was worse.
I just had my first exam and need to cheer myself up, so I'm posting this chapter early and hope your reactions do the cheering up. I present to you the longest chapter so far: 5663 words of Drarry crack. You’re welcome.
His good mood kept for once, and they spent the rest of the afternoon practising spells in the garden. Only when it was time for dinner and Severus was once again absent did Harry’s cheerfulness fade. He ate in silence, not feeling up to making conversation. Just when he was about to get up from the table and retreat to their room again, Narcissa held him back.
“Keep your voice down! Merlin’s fucking beard, we need some sort of codename for him, don’t we,” Harry sighed. “Yes, him. We went over all the sixth year potions, as well as the theory.”
“I asked you to meet me at Slughorn’s compartment, but then I decided to just follow Blaise because he’d surely lead me to you—I was right.”
doors leading inside and undressed to take a shower. The shampoo Draco had brewed smelled surprisingly good, and so far it seemed effective. Whether it lived up to the promise of withstanding potion fumes remained to be seen.
“No, of course we didn’t go there,” he said. “We went to the Room of Requirement. Now unless you want
Hermione was still studying him with obvious surprise on her face. After a few more seconds, she seemed to catch herself again and gave him an impressed look, saying, “Harry, that’s N.E.W.T. level magic.”
He walked around his desk and unexpectedly sat down in the second chair next to Harry’s, turning it to face him directly. Harry quickly turned his own chair to match.
“Remus, we’ll see each other once the DA supervision begins. Draco,” Severus continued, turning to clap Draco on the shoulder, “we’ll see each other soon enough. Don’t let your guard down, never forget that there could be a spy among your friends.”
Severus bristled. His voice dropped lower, threatening, “You may have gotten permission to keep your little club, Potter, but do not overstep your bounds. Is
Remus sank further into the hot water, his head surrounded by mountains of white sparkling foam. The heat of the water had filled the entire bathroom with steam, and he revelled in it. His thoughts drifted back to Sirius, how they’d sat in this bathtub together, in hot water like he did now, skin against skin—
Draco came running back into the room, several vials of potions hovering before him, and joined the table next to Harry. Without so much as a second of hesitation, Harry snatched a blue potion he knew to be labelled Blood-Replenisher and poured it into Severus’ mouth, making him swallow with a charm. Immediately, the blood spilling from the chest wounds increased.
, he corrected himself. With eight Weasleys in the house, he’d have no choice but to resort to first names.
He went to dinner with a distinctly nervous feeling in his stomach and barely managed to eat anything. Why had he wanted to do this again?
flying back towards Severus himself. His shield crumbled under the first one, then the second one hit him square in the chest and everything went dark.
“Attention, dear students! May I remind you that the Defence Association holds its first meeting today at seven thirty in the Room of Requirement on the seventh floor — it is open to second year students and older.” Dumbledore smiled as whispers broke out throughout the hall and Harry’s stomach churned.
Strengthening his own shield, Severus took a moment to consider his approach. Harry was fighting fast and with precise aim; the only spell that hit him had been reversed within mere seconds. If he wanted to land an actual hit, he’d have to occupy Harry for long enough to break through his shield so he’d be able to disarm him.
to keep it secret, but we have to because there’s going to be a Death Eater at Hogwarts next year.” All three of them gasped. Harry nodded gravely. “Voldemort managed to recruit a student despite Draco’s disappearance. Whoever it is was tasked with killing Dumbledore. Since it’s most likely to be a Slytherin, Draco would be in danger if anyone found out about our relationship.”
“Welcome everyone, thank you for coming — I didn’t expect so many of you, to be completely honest,” said Harry as Remus went back to watching the crowd.
“What?” he answered, aware that he sounded harsher than Remus deserved. There was a short silence, as if Remus was rethinking what he was about to say.
Draco kept his face neutral with considerable effort and quirked his eyebrows at her, feigning bored nonchalance. “What about him?”
With as much disdain as he could, he went on, “It’s typical, though, that Dumbledore would give Golden Boy his own club. Apparently Saint Potter needs more minions. I bet he couldn’t handle teaching anyone who doesn’t worship the ground he walks on.”
“It’s going—” Harry broke off as he felt the familiar sensation of the presence of a foreign mind prodding at his defences. He focused on his shields to strengthen them and a few seconds later, the presence retreated.
“I’m sure because there’s not actually a difference between ‘dark arts’ and regular spells — it’s just about intent and purpose.” He was infinitely glad that he’d taken the time to actually look into the books Severus had brought him on the topic when that debate had come up. At least he could argue his point confidently now, knowing it wasn’t just speculation. “The dark arts got their name — which is at least partially misleading, I might add — because of the way they’re used, not because there’s something inherently different about those spells.”
After a long while, the excruciating pain receded, and he could breathe again. As quickly as he could, he composed himself, knelt before the Dark Lord, bowed his head and then took his usual place in the Death Eater ranks, directly to the Dark Lord’s right. If that was all the punishment he was going to get, he’d gotten of far easier than expected.
“I don’t follow,” he said in a much milder tone than before. “Why would it be your fault? If anything it would be my fault. I shouldn’t have asked her to keep secrets.”
Remus took a moment to seize Severus up. While his posture was as impeccable as always, his face betrayed a hint of nervousness. Perhaps he should hear him out, even if he’d behaved abhorrently. He gave him a curt nod and stepped aside to let him enter. After closing the door again, Remus turned to face him with crossed arms, arching his eyebrow expectantly.
“I accept your apology, again, thank you. The past can be difficult to let go of, but I would wager that we have a rather good reason to do so now.”
“Go to sleep at a reasonable time,” he quipped as he pulled back, pointing at the clock. It was already past one in the morning.
“In a real fight your opponent wouldn’t wait for you to be ready either, and they’d do far worse than take your wand,” said Severus.
The seamstress picked up Draco’s robes, adding them to Harry’s pile—and his bill. Draco quickly stepped forward to correct her, “Those are mine, they don’t go on his check.”
It would indeed be. He’d resigned himself to the necessity of the lessons, and despite his conviction of never leaving this room again, he wasn’t stupid enough to believe that he didn’t need them anymore. His wand loosely in his hand, he pulled the door open, immediately peering beyond Severus down the hallway. No sign of Draco, good. Stepping aside to let Severus pass, he opened the door further, before quickly closing it again, replacing the locking spell.
“My point stands, you’re as qualified as me to have this conversation with Harry. Or is it supposed to be a secret?”
Remus hummed, thinking over her words. Social gatherings were not really an option and neither was the rest of her usual networking. You-Know-Who already had too many followers in the Ministry and too many more under the Imperius curse. It was a shame, really, those connections could have been incredibly beneficial to the war effort if Narcissa were—
Draco gave him a curt nod, relieved that Blaise had accepted his lie. Chances were that Blaise knew that it wasn’t the whole truth, but didn’t care enough to pester him. It was one of the many things he appreciated about Blaise; the man knew when to leave him well alone.
Severus wasn’t quite sure how to feel. He could agree with Remus’ basic sentiment, but he made it sound like it was a mistake. It hadn’t felt like a mistake to him, not in the slightest.
He ignored it and moved down Harry’s cock once more, squeezing his balls the slightest bit. It was enough to send Harry right over the edge and Draco’s mouth was flooded with come. He kept sucking lightly as Harry came and did his best to swallow — which was overall fairly successful, even if he didn’t manage all of it.
“Fine,” Draco pouted, already having unbuckled Harry’s belt and sneaking his hand into his pants to wrap his fingers around his erection.
Ron’s face turned crimson and he seemed lost for words. Ginny shot him a reproachful look that made him shrink away from her, and Harry felt a wave of gratitude for her.
“I’m guessing this is why you always kicked me out to change your clothes,” Draco said, trying to keep his voice somewhat light.
Hermione blinked at him in barely veiled shock, before shaking herself a little and nodding. “Yes, I suppose I could,” she admitted.
Bracing himself for the expected disapproval of his fellow Order members, Severus stepped further into the room and approached the group of people that was so warily watching him.
“I’m fine,” Harry mumbled, giving Draco’s hand a reassuring squeeze before dropping it into his lap. “Just tired.”
agree with Voldemort’s ideas? It had certainly sounded like it in the past, and yet, Harry could barely justify refusing him protection with things he’d said when he was twelve. Although, Malfoy had been as unpleasant as ever not even a week ago, holding Harry and his friends in Umbridge’s office. But being a dick wasn’t the same as wanting to be a Death Eater. Zacharias Smith was a major prick and as far from a Death Eater as it went. If Malfoy was truly trying to avoid being forced into serving the Dark Lord, Harry would be cruel to refuse him because of a silly schoolboy rivalry.
“Uh, sure, I guess,” he replied, not having thought about dinner at all until now. “I, uh, I only just woke up today, we don’t really have a routine yet.”
“You better be, I put up with Weasleys for you, Potter,” replied Draco, his best Malfoy-arrogance on his face.
Draco cut him off with a kiss. It took less than a heartbeat for Harry to relax and melt into Draco’s arms that he’d put around him.
Harry’s hands had found their way under his shirt—again—and the feeling of short nails digging into his skin sent shivers down his spine. Merlin, he could lose himself in this. His own hands began to wander, letting go of black hair and travelling downwards over Harry’s chest. Teeth nipped at his ear and he tried—and failed—to suppress a moan. He felt himself blush a little, but the faint feeling of embarrassment vanished immediately when Harry responded in kind.
“I wasn’t particularly pleased about it either, trust me,” Remus retorted. He hesitated for a second before adding, “Though I must admit that I envy them a little.”
For a long while they sat in silence, each caught up in their own thoughts. Severus’ mind was racing. Potter—
The chatter died down immediately, even though there were still students scurrying through the closing doors. Harry ignored them, but Remus did see his eyes flit over to the Slytherins, his lips giving the slightest twitch. Remus was sure he’d find a similarly controlled expression on Draco’s face if he were to look, but he refrained.
Harry also knew how to decipher his moods by now, could tell when Draco tensed up or retreated behind his defences. Most of all, though, he knew so much more about what Draco truly thought about things. The day after Dumbledore had unexpectedly shown up at Grimmauld and Harry had revealed his past with the Dursleys, Draco had told him about his own childhood before coming to Hogwarts. About how Lucius had raised him to be the perfect Malfoy heir, disregarding almost all of Draco’s needs and wishes. Harry had simply listened, holding back any comments, so as to avoid derailing the conversation into something it wasn’t supposed to be. That talk had been about Draco and Draco alone. It all made a lot more sense now.
“The upper rooms are wonderful. The room I’ve chosen now is the one I used to sleep in when I visited as a girl. I must say it looks much better now,” Narcissa replied, probably going along with this pointless conversation for Harry’s sake, which he was grateful for.
Draco shook his head again. “I won’t avoid anything. I don’t care whether you have those scars, Harry. No, wait, that’s not true, I do care—it makes me fucking angry that someone did this to you—but I don’t think they’re disgusting. It doesn’t upset me to see them, or feel them. The only thing that upsets me is that they upset you.” He quirked his lips up into a smirk. “Fortunately, I think there’s a solution for that.”
He couldn’t help himself, a little chuckle escaped his throat, quickly growing into full-out laughter. Potter joined in, and within seconds they were a giggling mess. Two peas in a pod, really. When they finally calmed down, Potter was still standing awfully close, his hands still on Draco’s hips and Draco’s still on his chest. He had to fight the urge to simply jump into the next round of snogging, reminding himself that they couldn’t just stay down here forever, and, despite the heat between them, his bare feet were getting cold on the tiled floor.
Remus pulled back slowly, holding Harry’s face between his hands. “We haven’t been as close as I’d have liked until now, and I understand that I can’t ever replace Sirius, but I want you to know that I’m always here for you. In fact, I’ll be the one staying with you over the summer. Dumbledore agreed that you’d be safest here for the time being and approved that I be the one watching over you.”
Harry wasn’t even sure how exactly it had happened. He‘d been ignoring Draco just as he‘d ignored the rest of his house mates, but the annoying little shit had somehow gotten under his skin again. Alright fine, he admittedly might have let him a little bit.
Remus stayed with him as he brewed, talking about this and that, and Severus found that he appreciated the company. Usually, he preferred to be alone for brewing, but Remus’ soft-spoken chatter was oddly endearing.
“James knew and he named you his heir. And he would’ve seen this, because I know you weren’t named heir in his will so he must’ve gone there, he knew it was Severus, he— Holy fuck!”
quiet. No noise, no wind, no colours, no thoughts, no emotions.” He looked up at Snape, suddenly feeling awkward. “But it was over after barely more than a second, and it all came back.”
“I bet you are,” Draco replied, but his tone lacked its usual haughtiness. “That was amazing, though. That spell you did, I’ve never seen anything like it before.”
Just as it landed in his hands, however, a tawny owl came gliding through the open window and dropped a small package wrapped in brown paper into Harry’s lap. His green eyes were sparkling with such childlike joy at such a shabby looking thing, Draco wanted to kiss him senseless right then and there.
Annoyance bubbled up in Harry’s chest. “And how am I supposed to do that exactly?” he snapped, before quickly adding “Sir.”
Their trousers and pants were off as swiftly as the shirt had been and Draco gasped as Harry pulled his hips down, pressing their erections together in glorious friction. He captured Harry’s lips in a fierce kiss, plundering his mouth.
With an annoyed noise, Remus began to pace his room. Severus and his abrupt change in attitude was a problem for after he’d gotten to talk to Harry. Remus had already waited too long with it, and this morning had proven that. While he’d suspected that they were well underway to having sex, he hadn’t realised just how fast they were progressing until he’d passed Harry’s room this morning. He was both glad that they hadn’t and wished that they had put up silencing charms. No, he couldn’t stall any longer, he had to talk to Harry today. Now.
“Unbelievable,” Severus muttered under his breath. He handed her the glass and they settled in their usual armchairs.
“Harry now more than ever has to master Occlumency. I ask you once again to teach him. Will you be able to work with him this time? Perhaps you can adjust your methods to his needs somewhat?”
Harry hesitated. Dumbledore had warned him not to tell too many people about it, but these four people felt increasingly like family to him. He trusted them.
When the first week of classes came to an end Harry was thoroughly fed up with absolutely everything. Most importantly: people. People and their never-ending whispering, staring, even
Draco wasn’t sure how long it had been, how many times his hand had already travelled from Harry’s chest to his hips and back, when he suddenly felt skin under his fingertips where he hadn’t expected it, sending a slight shiver through him. Harry’s shirt had ridden up, exposing the narrowest band of naked skin above the seams of his pyjama bottoms. Once more, Draco’s brain was momentarily overloaded, and he didn’t think before slipping his fingers under the hem of the shirt onto Harry’s abdomen, pushing the shirt up further in the process.
The castle’s magic resisted him for barely more than a few seconds before it yielded, and with it the stone wall he had been aiming his wand at. A large, wooden door formed and promptly swung open, revealing a bathroom made predominantly of soapstone, with a large bathtub, separate shower and two sinks, as well as several mirrors. It resembled the prefects bathroom, especially the multiple taps lining the tub.
“I get it,” he said softly. “It’s not enough to just sit here, it feels like doing nothing at all. But Narcissa’s idea is perfect, we’ll have to be patient. For now, we should probably let it go, as much as that bothers me. Harry is safe now—or, well, he’s as safe as Harry can get—but he’s never going back there.”
, you bloody dunderhead, I was mad at the prophecy for targeting you,” Draco drawled, his usual sass apparently slowly returning to him.
A similar pattern repeated itself over the following few days, and Harry quickly settled into his new routine, quite happy to at least not be spending his summer doing chores and being locked up for once.
Dumbledore’s “Come in” came promptly after Harry’s first knock and he pushed open the door to step into the circular room.
Draco kissed him so suddenly that Harry lost his balance and fell back into the pillows. It wiped his mind blank for a moment. Merlin, would he ever get used to kissing Draco? He seriously doubted it—it overwhelmed him every time, even though they were taking things
To his horror, George gave him a contemplative look and nodded. “We should probably talk about that eventually, yes.”
He handed it to Hermione with a pleased smile. She eyed it critically, opened it, leafed through it, inspected it, until she finally looked up at Harry with narrowed eyes.
Remus gave him a surprised look, then his expression turned thoughtful. “Your eyesight must’ve been affected by Lily’s charms,” he mused and Harry’s breath caught.
Severus nodded and stood mechanically. As he left the kitchen, he heard the soft voices of Narcissa and Lupin continuing to talk. He didn’t want to know what else they were discussing. As if in trance, he made his way up the stairs and out the front door, before apparating directly to the front gates of Hogwarts.
“You have to be careful,” Severus admonished sternly. “Outside of these wards or the Hogwarts wards you are never safe, you can not let your guard down for even a second.”
“What happens to them now?” he asked, frowning at the thought of innocent creatures being abandoned.
“I’m sore, tired and rather hungry, but otherwise I feel surprisingly well. What happened? My memory is somewhat…foggy.”
Harry laughed at that. He’d never heard anyone describe Kreacher as helpful. Narcissa tilted her head questioningly.
They clinked their glasses together and drank, both relaxing a little at the familiar taste. Minerva glanced around the room. Severus knew that look — she wanted to discuss something that shouldn’t reach other ears. He drew his wand and cast a Muffliato.
Once he was gone, renewed silence fell over the group. Pansy was the one who eventually broke it by saying, “I wonder what he wants Blaise for.”
The following morning came too soon. Harry got up groggily, trying not to think about what awaited him at breakfast.
Draco just nodded, stepping closer to Harry and nuzzling into his neck. Harry felt some of his tension drain out of him as he leaned into the touch with a sigh. Odd, how Draco Malfoy of all people would be the one who could make him relax with a simple touch. He suppressed the urge to laugh.
“Good night,” said Pansy without taking her eyes off Daphne, who was beet-red and clutching her glass as if it was the only thing that kept her from combusting on the spot.
Eventually, Severus slowly said, “The incident in the kitchen broke down walls we were both hiding behind. Of course, that doesn’t mean that I suddenly know everything there is to know about him. Our relationship as father and son is still…delicate, but it’s there, it exists, and I’m beyond grateful for that alone. I honestly did not expect Harry to be able to forgive me for all my errors, but he has once more proven me wrong. I suspect you can somewhat relate to that.”
Draco stared at him incredulously, apparently still lost for words. Hesitantly, Harry reached out to him, letting go of his own knees as he moved towards a shell-shocked Draco. Suddenly, Draco seemed to come back to life, grabbing Harry and pulling him back into a tight hug, even tighter than before.
“You first woke up right after Harry cast that form, so that memory is probably as clear as it gets. But afterwards, he talked to you. He asked you about the curse, you even managed to answer him. That’s not when he called your name, though.“
Harry’s eyes darkened, his tongue darting out to wet his lips. Draco’s resolve wavered. Then Harry gave the tiniest eye-roll and, after getting out of his shoes as well, settled next to Draco and snuggled into his embrace.
“Gods yes,” Remus breathed, eyes lighting up a little. It sent a shudder through Severus, and he chuckled, hoping it wasn’t too obvious.
“It suits you very well,” said Romilda, her tone adopting a saccharine quality that somehow reminded Harry of Umbridge. “Why don’t you come sit with us? There’s still space in our compartment, you don’t have to sit with them.”
Snape frowned slightly, then stood and turned to Draco. “Would you mind?” he asked uncharacteristically softly.
Harry grasped the man’s hand as panic flared up inside him. He didn’t get a reaction. His own chest constricted, making it nearly impossible to breathe. He couldn’t die now, not after all this.
“Alright, consider this example,” said Harry, hoping to be able to explain in a way that would get through to her. “Would you say that Wingardium Leviosa is a dark spell?”
His eyes followed Harry as the boy left, leaving the door open behind him. All things considered, that had gone much better than expected.
He recounted how Umbridge had targeted him from the start, about the detentions and the blood quill. Narcissa bristled when she heard how Umbridge had tortured students, demanding to see Harry’s hand. He’d never seen her so angry before, so he quickly continued to tell them about the DA, about his vision that had saved Arthur Weasley’s life, until he finally arrived at the night Sirius had died. He fell silent then, unsure whether he was ready to relive all that.
His name was barely more than a hiss, but he heard it the second time. He felt his jaw clench. He’d be paying for that soon enough.
“I’ve been wondering about how your family treated you since you mentioned that you never had your own clothes. Did they…hurt you?”
“It is,” confirmed Harry, “and I think that should earn me some more attention from you, now that we finally have some time to ourselves in
“Never mind,” said Draco, taking a deep breath and reminding himself that Harry’s approach to magic just was like that. “Legilimency — why Legilimency?”
“Well, it’s the same with this. The more tactical plays—shield charm variations in this case—you know, the better you can adapt to whatever your opponent throws at you.”
Remus was astonished by the sheer number of students that filed into the Room of Requirement. It was close to seven thirty now but the steady stream of blue, yellow, and red robes just didn’t stop; Remus even thought he caught the walls of the room expanding out of the corner of his eyes. Harry’s nerves seemed to have calmed somewhat. He’d stopped pacing once the door had opened at least, but perhaps he was simply trying to look composed in front of what felt like three quarters of the entire school.
Letting the door fall shut behind him, he kicked off his house shoes and threw himself onto the bed. He was suddenly exhausted. It took him a great amount of self-control to force himself to get up again and properly get ready for bed, and when he finally crawled under the covers he barely managed to start his Occlumency exercises before drifting off to sleep.
Harry considered that for a moment. He wasn’t particularly fond of house-elves, and having Kreacher here was only necessary because he knew too much about the Order to be freed. Bringing Narcissa’s elves to Grimmauld Place would be far too risky. Still, he couldn’t very well ask Narcissa to free all her house-elves just so they weren’t stuck at Malfoy Manor by themselves.
“What?!” Harry’s voice had jumped up an octave. “No, absolutely not! Narcissa, I have my own money, you saw it yourself, I can afford those myself. I’m not a charity case.”
Ron didn’t react immediately, still gaping at Harry until she elbowed him in the ribs, and he gave a surprised grunt.
He hissed in pain as he felt the first blade slash across his face. It burned as if someone had poured acid onto his skin. The second cut came only seconds later on his other cheek. If he hadn’t been in so much pain he would’ve laughed. Of course, even in his crazed state of mind torture had to be symmetrical with the Dark Lord.
After a short while, however, the amount of people wanting to move on grew, and only a handful of second years split off to the side for more help with Expelliarmus. Harry gave the next spell to learn and made his way over to the little group, when Remus stopped him.
After a short silence, Narcissa drew a deep breath and levelled her gaze at Harry. “So,” she said, smiling slightly, “I’m guessing you have more than just a couple questions. And, I must be honest, so do I, but those can wait for now. Please, Harry, ask whatever you wish to know.”
Harry hesitated, unsure whether it was wise to voice his thoughts. Concern flickered over Narcissa’s face, and she waved her wand at the door to let it fall shut before erecting a silencing charm.
“Draco! Draco look, I did it!” Harry practically pounced on him, sweeping him up in a passionate kiss that was over as suddenly as it had begun, and eagerly pulled him over to the desk and pointed at…two plain black notebooks? Draco gave him a confused look, then glanced down at the desk again. There was nothing else he could be pointing at.
involved in Harry’s life. Remus and Molly loved Harry like their own son, the boy would want for nothing if he just left it all up to them. He’d be safe and loved and far away from the dangers of Severus’ position, too. It was sensible, really.
“I’m guessing you transformed, then,” Harry went on. “And I’m guessing that since you’re not making a racket and trying to get out of your room, that the potion is doing its job. Which means that you can’t
He eyed her suspiciously, but eventually gave in. There was no point in trying to deny Minerva McGonagall. “The day before her wedding. She came to say goodbye, after that I never saw her again. Still, we weren’t
Harry shot him a quick smile, still trying to calm himself down. Real or not, facing Severus in such a public confrontation was more than a little unnerving. He still didn’t like the attention and that story would make the rounds like wildfire, he was sure of it.
, that simply won’t do. Can you glamour his scar, mother? I’ll go pick some robes of mine he can wear until he gets some of his own.” He beamed at Harry. “Trust me, nobody will recognise you in wizarding attire, without your scar on your new face.”
“Explain everything you’re doing,” Harry demanded. “I want to know what the spell does, how it does it, how accurate it is, how reliable it is—everything.”
“Wow, you— You’ve changed, mate. What happened? Or is it a glamour to avoid the gawking masses? Merlin knows they’re even staring at
She frowned at him, but the plea in his face must have convinced her, because she eventually nodded with a sigh. “If you say so, Harry. But I truly believe that he feels the same way as you, he’s just—”
Harry sighed against his lips. “I’ll miss you, too. You have no idea how much I already miss you. But we’ll manage, we have the notebooks, right?”
say,” replied Harry flatly. “And it’s hardly proof. If I remember correctly, you yourself thought I looked like Sirius first, so it can’t be
Remus slipped inside quietly, carefully closing the door behind him. Harry wished he’d warded that damn door, that would’ve prevented such a blunder.
Tears began to spill from his eyes for the first time since his conversation with Remus on the day he’d woken up at Grimmauld Place. Grief, sadness, anger and desperation caught up with him, swallowing him, choking him, suffocating him. Sinking down to his knees, Harry buried his face in his hands and, for the first time in years, simply let go.
The letter from Hermione—besides her understandably shocked reaction at the news about James—informed him of the mountain of homework he’d have to complete over the summer. To his surprise he found himself quite interested in most of it. It was even fun to research some complicated antidote for a potion’s essay, although he’d never have admitted that in front of Snape.
“I’ll see that Draco behaves,” she assured him. Harry smothered a grin at the image of Malfoy being berated by his mother for bothering him.
Harry dashed ahead, almost toppling over Draco who came running down the stairs as well. Within seconds, the table was clear and Harry cast a strong
The concerned looks on both his and Narcissa’s faces only deepened when Harry recounted how he’d heard voices throughout second year, which turned out to be the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets. The only thing that momentarily distracted Draco was Harry’s admission that they had broken into the Slytherin common room with Polyjuice Potion.
. If there had ever been a time for him to cast Killing Curses to rival the Dark Lord, it would be now. What Remus had told him about that wretched, godforsaken
Harry didn’t want him. That was to be expected. No reason to be upset. He’d simply keep his distance from now on, allow the boy to live his life in peace. He could protect him from afar, there was no need for him to be
“I don’t owe you any explanations,” Severus said coldly. “Now if you would kindly leave, I did not ask for your company.”
. A son he barely knew yet, and already had begun to love somehow, not merely for the fact that he was his blood, but for his intellect when discussing healing magic, his kindness towards the Malfoys, his goodness that was apparent even when he hid from the world simply to avoid exploding in anger. How had he been so
A week after Harry’s birthday, Remus declared that Harry had mastered apparition. It should’ve made him happy, but in his downtrodden mood he barely managed a smile. Draco was doing his best to cheer him up, but despite his repeated success, it never took long for Harry to slip back into his sullenness.
“We think Scrimgeour himself might’ve overheard,” Ginny explained. “He’s been dropping by the Burrow
“Uhm, I’m afraid I don’t have my key with me,” Harry threw in, a shadow of anxiety creeping back into his eyes.
A group of third years scrambled out of his way with wide eyes as he hurried through the common room, before breaking into a jog as soon as he left the portrait hole behind. The corridors were uncomfortably populated as people were making their way back to their common rooms after dinner. Harry wound his way through the stream of Gryffindors, stoically ignoring their curious glances. Eventually he reached a corridor that was not part of the direct route from the Great Hall to Gryffindor tower and he breathed a sigh of relief at the sight of the empty hallway.
Draco’s eyes widened. He jumped up, hurried to the door, and was gone within seconds, leaving Severus standing alone in his quarters.
Relief washed over Harry, glad that her reaction hadn’t been condescending. Draco stared at his mother, incredulous.
“I’m just teasing,” Draco laughed. “But seriously, congratulations, this is no small thing. The Black and Potter family magics should support yours now, as if you weren’t bloody well powerful enough.”
Potter eyed him suspiciously, then suddenly, the blush intensified and his eyes turned frantic, darting around the room as if looking for a way out. Draco had to keep him here, somehow. Standing in the doorway was an excellent start, but simply blocking Potter’s way wouldn’t work for long. He didn’t
… remember when I said “the next chapter is gonna be shorter again”? Well, uhm, about that… it escalated, again.
“Hello everyone, sorry I’m late!” Daphne dropped into the seat next to Millicent and looked around with bright eyes. “Is there still some liquor left?”
“We’re going to Diagon Alley, do you want to come along?” Harry asked so innocently that Draco had to hold back a snort.
Mrs Malfoy plastered another smile on her face and nodded eagerly. “Thank you so much, aunt Walburga! Now, how can I move your frame?”
They spent the better part of an hour simply reading, occasionally commenting on something in their respective books—Draco was devouring a book on advanced transfiguration, while Harry was still immersed in healing—but otherwise they didn’t talk much. When Remus knocked on Harry’s door to check on them, Draco didn’t even move. It made Harry feel all warm and fuzzy that they could show their affection for each other so casually now. He felt peaceful, almost serene.
Of all the people here, Theo was the one Draco would’ve least suspected to be willing to interact with anyone who wasn’t a pure-blood. Hell, he’d even kept his distance from Tracey during the entirety of first to fifth year. Draco had always assumed that to be due to the fact that Tracey was a half-blood, but now it sounded like Theo wasn’t nearly as bothered by blood-status as Draco had thought. Perhaps it would be easier than he’d expected to get his friends to re-evaluate their ideals.
“Do you feel better?” he asked quietly into the silence. He felt Harry’s smile against his shoulder.
“Yet it seems that it does,” Draco insisted. “You feel it yourself, don’t you? Part of why you want to give Sev a chance is that you’re related by blood, so it must count for
“For one, as a peace offer and hopefully a token of gratitude for your hospitality. You would be doing me an immeasurable favour by allowing me to stay here. I know it wasn’t your choice to invite me here, that much I can deduce from your reaction. Since it
The staff lounge was filled with quiet murmurs and the sound of crackling fire. Several colleagues lifted their hands or cups in greeting, and Severus gave them a nod in return as he made his way to his usual spot by the fireplace.
“Tracey is probably already holed up in our dorm with some dusty old book, and Daphne—” Pansy hesitated and looked around. “I have no idea where Daphne went, she was with us during the feast.” She frowned for a moment, then shrugged and said, “Oh well, she knows where to find us.”
Harry laughed softly, running his free hand up and down Draco’s back as he simply continued to stare in wonder at the man in his arms. Even though Harry never even looked away, when Draco lifted his head again Harry’s breath caught anew and he felt an overwhelming wave of emotion rise in him.
It was a Slytherin move if Severus had ever seen one, for Harry to be using his forgiveness as leverage to bargain for his friends to be treated better. Slytherin move towards Gryffindor ends.
With typical Malfoy elegance, he got to his feet and shuffled through the potions scattered across the edge of the table, before returning with a small green vial.
She inclined her head in thanks. Remus was about to rise from the table and leave when she spoke up again.
“So,” he said, once they were settled on the small couch Harry had added to his seating area at some point in the past week, “what did Sev do to piss you off so badly? Do I have to go rip him a new one?”
The Room of Requirement outdid itself. The sight of it was so unexpected that Harry’s jaw dropped in astonishment when he first stepped inside. While they had never lacked anything during their DA sessions the previous year, the room that had formed back then had been embarrassingly bare compared to the one Harry was standing in now.
“I haven’t done anything!” Harry protested. “I only told him to hurry it up a little, he’s the one who drew his wand.”
Harry was facing so much, and there were only so few things Remus could actually help him with. He could duel with him, teach him everything he knew about defence and about dark arts. In fact, Harry was already winning some of their duels, and Remus suspected he’d be winning more of them if he didn’t let Remus injure him on purpose, so he could test his healing spells. And he was teaching him how to apparate. It was an incredibly useful skill to have, especially for someone so often targeted as Harry.
“You’ll be fine, mate,” Ron tried to reassure him. Harry gave him a feeble nod in response and stared down onto his plate, the last shred of appetite he’d had now gone.
“What about Crabbe and Goyle?” Harry asked before he could stop himself. He hadn’t meant to interrupt, but Draco just scoffed and went on undeterred.
Remus’ lungs protested against the lack of oxygen, and he resurfaced through the slowly diminishing bubbles with a gasp. Yes, much better now.
“Well, now that we’ve…resolved things, there shouldn’t be anything to keep you from coming downstairs anymore. Or was there another reason why you went into hiding yesterday?”
“You obviously can’t go to any of your Slytherin friends, since most of them are connected to Death Eaters somehow; the Dark Lord would find you in no time and there’d be no getting out of it then.”
Remus didn’t try to get him to talk as he gulped down a plate of food Narcissa had set aside for him at lunch, along with a piece of chocolate Remus practically forced onto him. The food did help, but it didn’t vanquish the empty feeling in his chest. Nevertheless, he felt considerably better by the time their peace was disturbed by Snape stepping into the kitchen.
But circumstances were cruel and as a result, Harry would look ten years older again as soon as he opened his eyes, set his jaw and readied himself to face another day. It really wasn’t fair.
Remus got a wistful look then, giving Harry a sad smile. “I know because Sirius would never have cheated on me.”
Even though he knew that his potion was perfect, Harry felt himself tense slightly as Slughorn moved on to his cauldron.
Draco snorted and it took all of Harry’s self-control to keep himself from laughing. Slughorn took the suggestion gratefully and carried Harry’s cauldron over to the Slytherin’s desk. After producing two leaves from a shelf, Slughorn paused dramatically before he dropped one into each cauldron. They both withered immediately.
“Oh come on, seriously? The amount of shit that goes down all at once in this house sometimes is really disproportionate!” Draco cried.
It had been a pure coincidence that it was Dobby who had answered a summon from Severus earlier in the week. After Harry had snuck into Severus’ quarters under his Invisibility Cloak, insisting on spending at least some time in his room that Severus had prepared for him, Severus had sent for a house-elf to fetch Harry’s homework from his dorm to ensure he could at least get his assignments done. Upon seeing Harry, the elf had gone quite frantic and insisted that Harry summon him without hesitation should he ever need anything, even though students weren’t supposed to be able to command Hogwarts’ house-elves. He was probably worried about Harry’s safety with Severus — meddling little elf. Having a house-elf at Hogwarts was a luxury Harry hadn’t expected to appreciate so much, but now that he was pretty much stuck in his dorm if he wanted to avoid the whispers, he was incredibly grateful for having earned Dobby’s loyalty.
It was an easy choice, barely a choice at all, really. He jotted down a quick message to Draco, telling him where he was, before finally fishing out the textbook to inspect it. Something was written into a corner inside the cover:
“I can help him if needed,” Draco interjected, earning a raised eyebrow from Hermione and a scoff from Ron. “What? I’ve had the best grades in our class after you in both those courses since third year. I’m sure I can teach him the basics at least, as could you, or couldn’t you?”
The thought of retreating to the safety of his bed and escaping into sleep finally provided him with the necessary willpower to get back to his feet.
Oh, and if you’re curious as to what I imagine Harry to look like now, think Ben Barnes (with the slightly longer hair, like he looks when people fancast him as young Sirius).
Severus and Remus reached the dining room then and stepped inside, slowing down for a moment in surprise. The table had been slightly enlarged to accommodate fifteen people, and the room was filled with subtly glowing decorations. Narcissa had done a thorough job in preparing Grimmauld Place for Harry’s birthday—or at least given comprehensive orders to the elves.
Harry rolled his eyes. “If that’s how Potions is going to be, I might as well not go to class.” Setting his glass down, he reached for his bag and pulled out the tattered textbook he’d taken from Ron. “I did find this, though,” he added, as he held it out to Severus who took it, raising an eyebrow at him. “Or, well, Ron got it from the cupboard because he doesn’t have his own yet. The notes scribbled inside match your instructions.”
, and she told me. Anything that would’ve resulted in you feeling betrayed would’ve broken the vow. It is my fault because—” Severus took a breath, avoiding to look into Harry’s eyes. “—because if I hadn’t made you feel the way I did you wouldn’t have been so scared of me knowing; you wouldn’t have felt betrayed by her telling me, and the vow would’ve remained intact.”
Severus realised with horror. But it couldn’t be. Absolutely impossible. He pushed the thought away, it was too ridiculous to even consider it.
Slowly, so as to avoid spooking Draco, Remus lifted his head to nudge Draco’s arm. It was as much as he could do right now to show the boy that he was accepted here. Draco’s eyes widened as they met Remus’, but he didn’t shy back in fear. Instead, he remained for another moment, his gaze travelling back to Harry, then he turned and left much more swiftly than he had entered.
“Double Protean charm,” Harry proclaimed proudly. “I had the idea because of how Muggle cell phones work, and I remembered that Hermione used a Protean charm for our DA galleons last year. The galleons only worked one-way though, so I did some research and found a way to make it work both ways. Then I thought it’d be convenient if the ink changed colour once a message is sent, y’know so we don’t write something and then forget to actually send it over. Oh and I added a privacy charm, you’ll have to imprint your magical signature on yours before you can use it. That way nobody else will be able to read it.”
“I can’t say for sure when or how it would have happened, but I don’t think I would have stayed loyal to the Dark Lord indefinitely. Looking back, I am appalled that I ever supported such a twisted man, such horrid ideals. When he decided to go after Lily, it opened my eyes to what he truly was. So, as an answer to your question: No, I don’t think I’d be a faithful supporter of the Dark Lord and his goals, but I’m not sure if I’d still be a Death Eater—I’m not sure if I’d have found the strength to leave or to approach Dumbledore, if I’d even have thought of approaching him for help. But I’d like to hope that I would have found a way to break free, somehow.”
wouldn’t stop pestering me.” He glanced back into the staff room, then doubled up the Muffliato surrounding them before continuing to say, “I had five galleons on Mr Malfoy.”
“And what about me?” The words slipped out against his will. Severus’ eyes widened marginally, barely enough to notice, but Remus saw it. Instinctively, he listened for the man’s heart, for his breathing, and found both accelerating. It gave him enough courage to continue, “You were afraid I’d drop you because Harry didn’t need you, what about you dropping me as soon as your relationship with him is stable? I thought we were friends, or did I misunderstand the meaning behind our hour-long talks every evening? You didn’t just abandon Harry, you abandoned all of us. Even Draco, who you’ve known and loved his entire life. How can I be sure you won’t leave
. So much of everything, and I have no choice but to keep going, all the time. An hour after Sirius died, Dumbledore threw that fucking prophecy at me. An hour! Sirius dies, I’m told that I’m the Chosen One and the next thing I know my dad is not my dad, I’m living with the Malfoys and then suddenly Severus fucking Snape is my father, and before I can even begin to wrap my head around that,
Draco paled significantly and hastily shook his head. “Of course not,” he replied, albeit still put out. “Alright, fine. But if Potter acts like a prat, I will hex him.”
he realised. Fuck. Those daggers were cursed to prevent regular healing potions and spells from affecting the resulting wounds.
And then there was Potter’s magic. Potter had always been powerful, everyone knew that. For Merlin’s sake, the boy had been able to produce a corporeal Patronus when he was thirteen! Now, however, the word powerful seemed like an understatement; magic was practically thrumming around him, coming off him in waves, as though his body simply couldn’t contain it all—and yet it hadn’t felt hazardous to Severus at all. No, it had felt…natural and somehow delicate. Whatever charm had altered Potter’s magical signature had clearly also suppressed quite a bit of his potential.
Draco scoffed, but didn’t argue. Or maybe he would’ve argued, except a low, frighteningly dangerous sounding growl from the door had made them both turn around in alarm. Remus stood in the doorway, looking more furious than Harry had ever seen him, like he was ready to rip a human apart limb by limb. Next to him, slumped on a chair with a look of pure horror on her face and tears in her eyes, sat Narcissa.
It worked. After they’d settled on the two armchairs between Mrs Weasley and Fleur Delacour, Harry finally sat down too. It was an odd sight. Draco’s mother to his right, separated only by an empty armchair from the twins and the Weaslette, Harry to his left, with Severus right in the first seat of the next couch. Both combinations seemed so unlikely it was slightly jarring, and yet here they were. An army of Weasleys, Granger and, utterly random, Fleur Delacour, all staring expectantly at Harry. Every fibre in Draco’s body was on high alert.
Draco sighed and began to recount his day—or at least the parts Harry hadn’t been part of. They kept talking, Harry complaining about the constant whispers that followed him everywhere and Draco filling him in on the latest gossip surrounding the Chosen One—the kind of gossip people were careful not to discuss whenever Harry was close by. Unsurprisingly, most of it concerned his obviously changed appearance. Rumours were already running wild, it was only a matter of time before the truth he’d given Luna and Neville would spread.
“Sir, I meant to ask you something,” he began. “Would it be possible to make the DA an official club? If war is at our doorstep, some extra defence training can’t hurt, right?”
his brain reminded him frantically. He ignored it, whimpering instead when Harry pulled back a little.
And since Draco was just one door away, he was literally stuck in this room forever now, because he couldn’t risk opening his door. Maybe he could teach himself to apparate, then he could at least visit the library downstairs. He had found an abundance of very interesting books there, ranging from obviously very dark magic to extensive tomes on healing. It had occupied him for hours on end, day after day. That was, until
“I’m not sure what is more astonishing,” he said with a chuckle, “that you’re in my bed and we’re snogging, or the fact that you, Draco Malfoy, just apologised to me.”
“It’s from Dumbledore, he wants to start our lessons this Saturday already. Right after dinner, at seven.”
“Harry, dear, how can you be sure that they did not manipulate you in some other way?” said Mrs Weasley, who Draco discovered with shock also had her wand out and aimed at him.
“Oh don’t worry, I can remind you of all the details you want,” Remus interrupted and Severus smirked. Yeah alright, he’d walked right into that setup, but he might’ve done it on purpose. Who wouldn’t?
They stayed unmoving for a moment, then Harry reluctantly dropped his arms and nudged Draco so he could step away from the wall.
The silence was broken by Harry’s stomach growling loudly. Right, he’d skipped lunch. And he’d never finished breakfast.
And then the second part escalated on me too, ending up at least double as long as planned, sooooo I split them up into two chapters.
Leaning in slowly, he placed the softest of kisses on Draco’s lips, trying to put everything he felt into it even though he knew there was no way he could ever convey that much emotion. Draco hummed happily against his lips, the vibration of it translating immediately to Harry’s insides. Gods, how much of this could he take before he’d just
“Whatever spells he used that made him lose his humanity; it was most likely an intentional change.” Ron paled significantly, but Harry went on undeterred. “There
, Harry realised. How the hell had he gotten to Grimmauld Place? The last thing he remembered was Dumbledore wanting to perform some spells on him, to make sure Voldemort hadn’t done any funny business while he’d possessed Harry.
“He’s quite taken with you. I must admit it’s almost flattering,” Severus replied cheekily, taking a sip of his own wine.
With that, Severus inclined his head and left the room swiftly, closing the door behind him. Harry stared at it for a long while, trying to sort his thoughts. Severus was
Harry wrapped his arms around him and pulled him down until he was lying on top of his chest, his forehead nuzzled against Harry’s temple. For a while, they said nothing, and Harry simply drank in the warmth radiating from Draco’s body on top of his as he waited for his heart to calm down and the heat in his groin to subside. Eventually, Draco pulled back, dropped another kiss on Harry’s lips and rolled off him just enough so he could comfortably look at him.
Severus raised an eyebrow at the two, who were glaring at each other in a way he had never seen between them before.
in bright yellow letters. A disbelieving laugh that quickly turned into giggles of pure delight escaped him. Molly looked horrified at his side, repeatedly mouthing “U-No-Poo” in disbelief.
He looked around the room again. To his left were two doors, and then a bigger door right in front of his bed. He spotted his trunk under the left window, next to a large chest with Hedwig’s cage on top of it. Someone had brought his stuff at least.
Severus frowned again, his worry growing by the second. For a moment, he was tempted to simply grab Draco’s arm and push up his sleeve, see for himself whether he was too late already. He controlled himself.
Remus nodded in agreement and took another sip of firewhisky. “I’m running out of things to teach him if I’m completely honest. Perhaps you have a few more spells up your sleeve?”
“It’s the name of a Celtic healing goddess. Since she has healing abilities and the scales are so useful for healing potions, it would be quite fitting, don’t you think?”
Moving slowly, he got off the bed, carefully steadying himself on the wall. He hadn’t eaten in a while, and a wave of dizziness washed over him as he stood up. When it had subsided, he noticed that he was wearing fresh pyjamas. His robes must’ve been in shreds, which meant that— He felt a blush creep up his neck. They’d probably had to undress him to treat his wounds.
The box was filled with all sorts of things—from Gryffindor scarves to closed bottles of Butterbeer that had expired ages ago—but Harry was mostly drawn to the countless letters covering the bottom of it.
“Love potions, little sister?” Fred teased Ginny. “Didn’t think you needed any help with that, or is the rumour I hear about you and Dean Thomas a fabrication?”
Maybe he could redecorate his room upstairs, make it feel like it was actually his. He owned a house now. He had a home.
“You can’t be serious, tell me you’re not going in there! What if the potion’s effect ebbs out too soon? What if he suddenly goes feral and rips you to shreds? Harry,
wouldn’t, love,” Draco appeased. “But the majority of people isn’t like you. The majority of people are judgemental and self-righteous about the judgement they dole out.”
“I’ll ignore this prophecy business for now, Potter, but don’t think you’re off the hook,” Draco threatened, before continuing in a much warmer tone. “I don’t know much about Sev’s time as a Death Eater, only that my father was somehow involved in recruiting him. What I do know is that Sev is a good man. He’s my godfather, I’m not sure if you knew that already, and he’s been there for me when my actual father wasn’t. Especially since I started at Hogwarts, we’ve grown pretty close. Close enough that I went and asked him for help to run from the Dark Lord—and he didn’t let me down. Yeah, your history with him is very different, and he really doesn’t treat students that aren’t Slytherins very well, but I know him as a good, caring man towards those he values. I think you can trust that he will protect his own, and you are one of his own now. If he still had any feelings of loyalty towards the Dark Lord—which I honestly doubt—they disappeared the moment he realised that you’re his son.”
He never managed to finish his sentence, as he was hit with the Cruciatus curse. Dropping to his knees, he tried not to scream, but it was hard to tell whether he succeeded or not.
“Thank you. First I want to know what happened to the others, though. Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and Neville. Are they alright?”
By the end of the first week he was just starting to feel truly comfortable, when his fragile routine was violently disrupted by the arrival of Draco Malfoy. Despite knowing full well that term was ending and that Malfoy was about to join his mother at Grimmauld Place, Harry didn’t feel at all prepared to face his school rival. Not here. Animosity like that didn’t belong here, didn’t belong in the first place that felt like a home to Harry that wasn’t Hogwarts.
“You did before,” Draco interrupted, before covering his face with his hands and letting out a groan.
It was at least several minutes before they finally parted again, both rather out of breath. Potter’s face was flushed, lips red and slightly swollen, green eyes sparkling. He was beautiful.
I have to say that writing Snupin is way out of my comfort zone, compared to writing Drarry, and if it hadn’t been an explicit request from my best friend, I’d be glossing over the details much more for that. I will do my best however to include as much Snupin half-smut (and hopefully smut at some point) as possible.
“No, no, you explained it wonderfully, I just have to process it properly. I’ll go downstairs real quick, I need a snack,” he declared as he got out of his chair. “Do you want anything from the kitchen?”
. When Harry got to the part about Voldemort on the back of Quirrell’s head, Draco went uncharacteristically quiet, until he finally walked right up to Harry and pulled him into a tight hug, as if he was afraid that Harry would suddenly drop dead out of nowhere.
The house-elf appeared with a soft pop, and the message was clear: Moving on, no more questions for now.
That means that the first part (Summer) of this fic is done, and we’re on to the second part. I will still include as many Severus and Remus POVs as possible, but from here on out it’s probably gonna be increasingly Harry and Draco focused (Harry even more than Draco), because that’s where most of the story happens, naturally.
because he’s claiming to be against You-Know-Who? He could be lying, for Merlin’s sake! What if he’s just here to get to you, so he can deliver you to his master?” The Weasel’s face was turning redder with every word.
“I’m afraid that’s a pointless discussion to have with him,” Draco cut in and Harry looked down at the Slytherin in surprise.
Draco frowned a little. “I don’t wager he’s told you any more about what those lessons are going to be about?”
“Perhaps seven thirty,” said Harry. “I want to get to the room a bit earlier to prepare, but I do appreciate dinner.”
She led him up to the second floor and into an incredibly messy room with torn, dark-blue wallpapers hanging limply from the walls. He was absolutely not in the mood to discuss decor, but he could hardly refuse her after all the work she’d put into the house.
“I’m sorry, my lord,” he bit out, hoping he sounded apologetic instead of angry and desperate. If he could reach his wand, he could activate the emergency portkey in his pocket that would bring him back to Grimmauld Place. But he was still bound, and the Dark Lord didn’t seem to be done with him yet.
“I owe you numerous apologies and explanations, and I would like you to hear as many as possible, which is why I’ll apologise for my comparably smaller mistakes first, before moving on to my more shameful failures.”
“No, go on. Speak your mind while we’re at it, because I’d rather not bring the subject up again and again. Say what you have to say,” Harry challenged, opening his arms in invitation.
Harry huffed indignantly, and Remus had to stifle a laugh. Yes, that sounded like Albus. The old meddler had probably already suspected it when he’d insisted that Severus was to give Harry daily Occlumency lessons.
Ron’s eyes widened, then narrowed in suspicion. Harry pushed his book further towards him and turned to look at Slughorn, who had just finished to introduce himself.
“It’s no excuse, however, for how I’ve treated you. Despite all those similarities, I should have been able to differentiate between you and James. Instead, I took your frequent involvement in trouble as confirmation of my assumption that you were just like him and felt justified in my dislike of you. I was blinded by a decade old hatred and I never bothered to look past the surface, to see who you really were. I am truly sorry, Harry.”
, and Malfoys don’t mix with the rabble. He wouldn’t even know how to be anyone else than the carefully trained Malfoy heir his father had made out of him. He would never fit in with them, so it was better to stay with what he knew, where his defences were firmly in place and the pain was familiar.
Remus just stared at him wide-eyed. What the actual fuck? Draco was right, the amount of shit that went down in this house was significantly above average.
“That won’t be necessary, you don’t need your key. Just let the goblins scan your magical signature to identify yourself,” Draco’s mother replied, giving Harry another small smile.
Harry only gave him a small smile and nodded, and then Draco was gone. Severus gently put a hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“I will continue Transfiguration, Potions, Charms, Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, Defence and Herbology,” replied Draco.
Snape narrowed his eyes and Harry’s palms began to sweat. He really didn’t want to talk about this now.
. If the slimy git hadn’t been so unpleasant for the past five years, maybe Harry would’ve been more amenable to the idea.
Not that they had kept to cuddles all day. The memory of Draco’s smooth skin against his made Harry shiver slightly. And now it would all be taken from him.
Suddenly, memories from the previous night came rushing back and he felt like someone had punched him in the gut. Sirius. Sirius was dead and it was his fault.
Severus waited for the man to continue, but when Remus stayed silent, he relented and asked, “So, what are your intentions?”
The twins cheered at that, and another round of laughter went around the table. Draco relaxed into Harry’s embrace as he watched his mother laugh with Fleur Delacour and Charlie Weasley. Perhaps he didn’t need to worry about Weasleys after all. And what a glorious feeling that was.
Narcissa nodded dutifully. “The first step is for both of us to make our own magical signature visible by revealing our magical core. Repeat after me, Draco: Subscriptio Magus Proprius.”
He extinguished the lights with another wandless command, then tightened his arms around Draco, wanting to keep him as close as he could, just to enjoy drowning in him a little longer.
“Narcissa,” he grit out, trying to stay polite. “You wouldn’t happen to know where all the chocolate in the pantry went, would you?”
Taken aback, Harry shrugged mutely. He didn’t particularly care. “Whichever you like, only two of them are occupied,” he mumbled, suddenly feeling awkward.
Remus seized her up carefully; her posture was as perfect as ever, her face composed—she could have sat for a painting like that. “I believe that you could. And I believe that if you did, it would make a noticeable difference in our favour.”
“I know,” Harry replied smiling, taking Draco’s hands into his own. “Anyway, so Hermione managed to trick Umbridge and she got carried away by centaurs. Does anyone know what happened to her?”
Draco bit back a groan. Right, Harry and his growing arsenal of silent wandless spells. Why did that have to be so hot? It was like the universe wanted Draco on edge at all times, because whatever Harry did, Draco’s first instinct was to melt into a puddle of want.
Harry shrugged. “I haven’t thought about it to be honest, I figured I’d do the same as always: Read a little, maybe some practice. Why, did you have something else in mind?”
I could not resist. It’s the best line ever. Obviously, that line isn’t mine and belongs wholly to JKR.
He returned her smile and shook his head. “I’ve suspected for a while that the Dark Lord might rope Draco into his plans, should Lucius displease him again. I’m only glad that it is not too late to assist you both. However, I must ask you to swear an Unbreakable Vow that enforces your discretion, regarding anything you learn while under our protection, and ensures that you will not betray any of us—a necessary precaution, I’m afraid.”
a voice deep in his mind supplied. Yes, the portkey. He had to activate the portkey. With tremendous effort he closed his fingers around his wand, reached into his pocket and pulled out the small pin that would bring him home.
He had anticipated rumours and gossip thanks to his new face. What he hadn’t expected were the giggling and gaping hordes following him around wherever he went. Six different girls, one as young as a
I really liked the idea of Narcissa eventually being free of the vow and instead actually having Harry’s trust because of their relationship.
Severus seemed to squirm a little, wringing his hands, until he finally said, “I have to apologise to you. For ignoring you this past week. I shouldn’t have disappeared without any explanation like that.”
, absent-mindedly chewing on a croissant, while Pansy was in an avid discussion with Millicent of which Draco had only needed to hear two sentences before tuning it out.
But Draco didn’t stop. No, Draco seemed to redouble his efforts after this first encounter, despite Harry’s ongoing outwards indifference. And Harry found himself appreciating it, in a twisted sort of sense. While Remus was trying to give him both space and caring attention, Narcissa had firmly retreated between invisible rules of conduct keeping a polite distance, and Sna—
“A variety of unpleasant things,” Severus responded, and Draco lifted his head again, watching him as he reported what he’d learnt at the meeting. “He has taken several hostages, most notably Garrick Ollivander, the wandmaker. The number of Death Eaters that hold Ministry positions is growing every day, and they’re putting people under the
Severus’ thoughts were circling around Albus once more. Ever since the headmaster’s appearance at Grimmauld Place during the summer, his faith in the man had taken repeated hits. His reluctance to tell Minerva despite his promise to Severus to inform her was just one more point on a growing list of things that made Severus question the man’s intentions. Or if not his intentions, at least his priorities.
“Hi, babe,” Harry said, giving Draco a kiss on the cheek as he slung an arm around his shoulders and pulled him close. “Missed me?”
