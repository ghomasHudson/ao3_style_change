Daddy returns with some of his homemade sweets, and then she’s cocooned on either side by both parents in a way she hasn’t experienced in quite some time.
“It’s because you’re so fat,” Draco adds, playfully, as Harry snuggles back into him. Harry growls and nips at his neck, and his shoulders shake with laughter. Then, after he sobers up, he asks, “Do you know when the Dark Lord plans to send you back to Russia?”
Scorpius bends down and asks her, nicely, for what must be the third time this week, to be careful around Father. As he rights himself, he locks gazes with Grandfather, who is staring at the both of them like he’s seen a ghost.
Harry throws his head back on a laugh. It’s a bright, lovely sound. Draco is always proud when he’s the one that caused it. When he sobers up, he kisses Draco’s forehead. “It was Peter Pettigrew.”
There are no words for the longest, the only sound between them the gentle slap of skin, the slick wet of their joining, and their soft moans. The smallest shift in angle pulls a throaty moan from Draco’s mouth, and Harry’s cock twitches as he pauses to check in.
Harry’s gaze is heavy on him as Draco bobs his head, employing every little trick he’s learned so far, his hand pumping what he can’t reach. Before long, Harry’s cock is twitching in his mouth, and his hand tightens in Draco’s hair. His knot is growing, pressing against Draco’s hand each time he pumps his hand.
He hasn’t ever been proud of his Dark Mark. He’s felt relieved to have it, to be sure, and even grimly glad of it, in certain situations where ordinary citizens wouldn’t have had the same society safeguard he does. Sometimes, when they are intimate, Draco will trail a slender finger along its shifting black length, or drop his head to press pink lips onto it in tender kisses--Harry hates it the least in these moments. But he has never been proud of this brand. As Black stares down at it, Harry is disgusted with it for the first time since he took it.
Harry doesn’t know how to respond to that, so he doesn’t, opting instead to guide Draco back against a nearby wall. He tilts his head up when Harry leans in to graze his teeth over the red bond mark, hands cupping Harry’s elbows. He makes a vain attempt to resist biting down, but Draco’s scent is familiar and safe, makes him greedy on a good day. Draco whimpers at the feeling of Harry’s teeth digging into the tender flesh, scent thickening on the air.
She'll always wonder why the Sorting Hat got her and James’ houses backwards, and then frowns when she remembers how it’d laughed in her head and said “Another Potter? Ah, but you are unique, aren’t you? I know just where to place you,” and then bellowed out
Al cradles his hips, enjoying the feeling of Draco's arse filling his hands. He squeezes, and then his hands trail up, appreciative of the softness he finds beneath his oversized shirt. He can feel the zig-zag of a stray stretch mark, which he caresses with his thumbs, enjoying the shy squirm it elicits. He still hasn't been able to convince Draco to undress completely when they do this. "You'll find out just how old I am," he likes to say, spinning insecurity into a joke. Al's not good with words, so he's still trying to find a way to say that he likes the story in Draco's body without sounding like the cornball love interests in those Muggle romance films Scorpius pretends he isn't obsessed with. Most days, like today, he settles for keeping his own shirt on in a show of solidarity.
She watches helplessly as Draco stands and begins pacing restlessly back and forth, shaking his agitated energy out through his hands.
“A little over a year ago, you told me that your husband was ‘very kind.’ Do you remember what I told you?”
. The Ministry added it to the list of Unforgivables. Aunt Hermione's been engaged in a flurry of medical research ever since.
Harry grits his teeth to hold in the knee-jerk bit of snark that’s begging to come out. Once the irritation has passed, he asks, “So when is the next trial?”
Namely, that he hates it when Harry walks into a door before him. It’s a baffling new habit, especially when it comes to Harry’s own home, where Draco has been tentatively spending the night for the past few days, getting a feel for this change in their relationship.
Draco’s first instinct is to snap that he’s certainly prettier than any of the sallow-faced spawn this man has ever sired, but then he recognizes him as one of the older Travers second sons (and, most importantly, one of Father’s most important business partners) and keeps his mouth firmly shut. Harry reaches out and grabs his hand, squeezing tight, and Draco’s irritation quiets. It’s still there, simmering tightly underneath his skin, but then again, part of it may be the modified amortetia that is racing through his system. Harry had taken its sister potion at the beginning of the day, a tricky brew meant to lower his control on his magic. It will make it easier for them to solidify a mating bond. Draco can feel Harry's enormous magic filling the room almost like a sentient thing, crawling curiously to meet each new visitor before skittering back towards Draco, curling contentedly on his heated skin. It's not quite a heat that Draco is experiencing, but he can feel a trickle of slick making its lazy way down his thigh. It's debasing in the worst way.
“Nothing. I just don't enjoy wasting my time trying to communicate with mouth-breathers. Not much going on up top,” Draco snarks. “Harry, I’m going to look over there.”
. “His son--your grandfather--invented Sleekeazy’s hair potion! The profits he earned from that will probably be enough to support our descendants for generations.”
They’re fresh out of the shower and clad in bathrobes. Draco has been leaning against the sink and covering himself in that confusing array of lotions and scrubs and potions that he always dives into after a morning wash. Harry watches, sometimes, fascinated by the whole thing.
“He’s just jealous! Bet you can’t stop thinking about the way little Draco rode Potter like a prize stallion. Never knew he had it in him! And did you hear what Potter had him saying—” Amycus says.
“I’m not naming both of these babies by myself,” Harry says, smoothing his knuckles over Draco’s cheek. “Now you’ve got to come up with one, too.”
Harry lets out a weak laugh and finally turns to face his friend. Fred’s giving him a tired smile, red-rimmed eyes alight.
“I can leave if you need privacy,” Draco drawls. “Is it something for the Dark Lord? Wouldn’t want to get my dangerous Omega eyes on
Viktorovich quickly catches on that Harry is following him, for he fires a wicked curse Harry’s way over his shoulders, one that makes his skin feel like it has been set alight with multiple prickling needles. Harry glances down at his hand and growls in frustration at the red marks popping up in ugly splotches.
They pass Thicknesse and Dolohov on their way out. Thicknesse sneers Harry’s way, though his face quickly schools into a bland look when Harry makes a show of pulling his blazer back to reveal his holstered wand. Harry snorts and rolls his eyes.
Draco writes to Aunt Bella for books on common rituals for couples, too embarrassed to ask Mother about it. Aunt Bella’s letter is dripping with dark amusement, and Draco knows they will surely endure her unsubtle teasing.
It makes his chest constrict. When he hums, Harry’s hip rock upwards, and it’s just deep enough that his tip grazes the back of his throat, and he has to pull back with a little cough.
Harry pulls back with a laugh. He’s never heard a sound like that coming from Draco. “What was that?”
That seems to calm him, and he smiles as Harry pulls his blanket back and draws delicate feet into his lap, massaging gently.
“Look at me, please,” he says, chest aching at the way Draco blinks rapidly. “You’re something else, you know that? I haven’t had someone that angry on my behalf in a lifetime. Thank you. But we’ve got to be careful while we’re here, you understand?”
When he bites down on it, he’s momentarily distracted by how unreasonably refreshing it is. Everything is always more intense, when he’s like this--flavors burst on his tongue and linger, fabric makes him shudder, cool air makes him stretch contentedly like an indolent house cat. He’s eaten the equivalent of two entire apples and then a slice of mango before he remembers the plan he’d devised.
Harry’s friends are a silent force at their back, faces drawn. They don’t fit in, and it shows, but even bringing them along is a calculated thing. It sends the message that they have Harry’s support.
“Lucius isn’t a good person,” Dad says, bluntly. “He’s learned a lot of hard lessons and yet always seems to end up the same on the other end of it all. I’ll talk to Father about it. For what it’s worth, though, having you guys is all I ever wanted, really.”
It’s been a long time coming, Harry thinks, when Draco finally snaps and pulls him into a biting kiss that is more teeth than anything.
Draco drops a loud, smacking kiss onto Harry’s knuckles, brows furrowed. “Don’t let it go to your head, but I’m very happy with you, Harry Potter.”
They catch their breath in comfortable silence, kissing lazily. The afterglow is cut unfairly short by Harry’s obligations. He slides out of bed with a reluctant sigh, leaning down for one last kiss before he begins to redress, carefully aiming cleaning charms over his person. Draco rubs his shaking thighs together and watches in forlorn silence, though he quickly affixes a lazy smile on his face when Harry finally looks back up at him.
Healer Ouedrago patiently explains what they’re looking at, but Harry’s ears are rushing the whole time. He catches snippets--about eight weeks--here’s the head, concentrate and you can see the tip of the nose--won’t be able to tell either gender for a while--yes, all babies’ heads look that big at this stage--but mostly he keeps thinking that it feels desperately wonderful to have a family.
to learn. And none of the staff were going to admit that they got bested by some war orphan, so while they hated it when they caught us practicing, there was nothing they could do about it without looking bad for letting us get away with it in the first place. Fighting is--it’s how those of us on the bottom bond with each other. That, and fucking. You just. Get good at both, after a while.”
“Yes,” Draco says, biting his lip. He raises a hand to his stomach, an endearing new habit he seems to have picked up. The reminder of the child he’s carrying brings a smile to Harry’s face.
With all of them set up, they begin their rounds, pausing by booths for pastries and souvenirs. They’re met with whispers wherever they go, but a promising number of people stop by to offer their blessings, gently pressing their hands on Draco’s stomach as they go. It’s a sweet-natured thing, all smiles and chattering, and clasped hands. The occasional group of children runs up full of questions about babies, and whenever Draco is overwhelmed, Narcissa gently intervenes with the answers.
A dimple pops into place as Draco huffs a surprised laugh. Then he’s crowding into Harry’s space, and Harry can’t be blamed for the speed and intensity with which he’s reaching out to wrap his arms around Draco’s distracting shoulders and pulls him down for the most legendary round of snogging he's every experienced. They make their way up the stairs on fawn legs, trading insults and pet names and promises, and it’s perfect.
Harry laughs, and tugs on his hand to pull him to a stop. He doesn’t have the proper words to express the brightness taking root inside him, so he settles for a deep, slow kiss. Judging by the way Draco squeezes him tight, he’s sure he’s been understood loud and clear.
“On your seventeenth birthday, Mr. Thicknesse asked for your hand in marriage. I refused him because I knew you were unready. His was the first of many offers I turned down. I admit that I failed you by indulging your weakness. It was also a failure on my part not to accept one of those offers in time to prevent the Dark Lord from intervening. We both know, however, that these bonds do not have to be permanent, and I should hope you understand why the Dark Lord would be amenable to considering a severance after all that has transpired.
They exchange a few more polite words before some guests approach to speak with Blishwick, who meets them with a benign smile.
As Harry has been dreading, the Americas are the next target--though Harry himself has been tasked with drawing up strategies to suppress skirmishes to the east, with an unsubtle reminder that he may have to participate to bolster forces. Fighting is what Harry does, and he has become scarily efficient at planning more focused operations in the past decade. No matter how much he suspects his heart is not in it, he will have to keep at it, especially now, when thinking about some secret growing rebellion makes his stomach turn in hot fear. At least he was not instructed to be there for every battle.
Draco clasps his hands together in front of him. “I’m off for a little while. I was wondering if there was anything you needed from me before I go, or if I can get you anything before I come back.”
“Don’t enter unless you plan to win.” Draco sniffs, playfully, which makes the assembled Death Eaters crow with laughter.
The Death Eaters bow, and then linger with bated breath, unsure if they can leave. They’ve razed the ground in places, melting away thick snow to the grass below in wicked stripes. Residual magic rises into the air, the cloying smell mixed in with a chaotic jumble of Alpha and Beta and copper. It’s not a combination that Harry has ever truly adjusted to.
As if sensing his gaze, she peers at him from across the room. Then, to his deep and genuine astonishment, politely disengages with them and beelines towards him. The Death Eaters assembled part for her in curiosity and astonishment, a sea of mostly dark robes pulling apart to make way for crimson red.
He’s surprised to see a framed picture of himself and Draco. Harry’s dressed in plain dress robes, but Draco looks breathtaking in silk baby blue robes with slit sleeves, his arms covered in long white opera gloves. He’s laughing privately at something Harry whispers in his ear, and as Harry pulls back, the two of them smile at each other with a tentative sweetness that makes his breath catch to witness.
He curls his hands into Harry’s hair, feeling the heels of his palms sliding against the silver wire frame of Harry’s square glasses. Impatient, he pulls them off of Harry’s face and throws them aside. Harry laughs, the tingling vibration of his voice a wonderful sensation against the sensitive peak of his nipple. Calloused fingers pinched the opposite one, twisting slowly. Draco gasps and bucks up, erection sliding deliciously against Harry’s neatly buttoned shirt. He’s rewarded with a heavy thrust, the length of Harry’s heavy arousal grinding into his heated flesh. He can feel the trailing wet of his slick, tacky on his skin, when he squirms.
Once all of the assembled chairs are filled--they line all four walls of the large Malfoy mating chamber, surrounding the plush bed on the dais in the center of the room--the ceremony can begin. This is where Draco is supposed to give a speech and thank them all for coming. Instead, he turns to Harry and says, simply, “Make me come.”
“No, Pansy. He’s mine.” Draco replies. There’s no heat in his words, but they’re said firmly. Harry’s smile widens.
A light flush rises on Draco’s cheeks, and he bites his lip as he shuts the door behind him, clearly trying to hide a smile. “I just wanted to sit with you.”
“Do you like it here? Do you like your work?” He asks, in a rush. He’d splayed his hands wide as he spoke, and now he clutches the shawl he’d thrown over his shoulders for comfort.
Draco laughs, leaning forward to whisper in his ear. “It’s a tradition. Haven’t you ever seen people doing it?”
“You’ve had us here playing house with snobs while they stare and stare and you supposedly try to help Fred, but it just feels like a whole lot of nothing!” Weasley says.
Malfoy narrows those glinting eyes at him, a teasing smirk on his face. "Only if you can make me loud, Black."
He’ll never understand Purebloods. They cherish family, but there’s something so desperately sad about the way their families operate. Omegas are revered, yet restricted so intensely that it feels cartoonish at times. When Harry first took the mark, Pettigrew fast-tracked him through a series of primers on high society: he learned how to bow to and who to kiss on the knuckles and who to shake hands with. He learned which laws no longer applied to him, which new rights he had, which events he could reasonably brush off and which would garner much more trouble than was worth a moment of peace. As he stares into the crackling flames, he can’t help but remember the conversations he’d had with Pettigrew about what would be expected of him if he were ever allowed to marry, and especially if he married an Omega. He’d scoffed at the idea of having the power to override medical decisions, and shook his head in irritated wonder at learning he had the right to attend any legal proceedings.
Harry chuckles, giving him quick kisses. “If the Dark Lord allowed all of us to bring our spouses with us, we wouldn’t get anything done. I’ll make it up to you, I promise.”
Even from a distance, and with his charms erected, the acidic stench of the poisoned forest is powerful enough to make his eyes water. His glasses fog over immediately. As is usual for him, he affixes them to his face with a sticking charm, spells them clean, and takes it all in. There is a sickly pink haze settled a few feet above the ground, obscuring it from view. The spindly, blackened limbs of dead trees reach high into the air, stark against the hazy morning sky. All around them is dead silent, and the powerfully lingering traces of magic sends gooseflesh rocketing along Harry’s skin.
They’re all gathered under the invisibility cloak atop the Astronomy Tower, because they’ve been scolded one too many times for sharing passwords and barging into each other’s common rooms, and they all like to glance up at the stars sometimes, wondering if maybe they can’t catch sight of the constellations Father is so fond of.
Mother gives the man, who Draco vaguely recognizes as one of Father’s simpering business partners, a wry smile. “Thank you for the suggestion, Mr. Bulstrode.”
Harry’s not one to stall things, but the thought of entering the Auror office right now turns his stomach. So, glancing at the glass door and all the drawn faces staring tensely back at him within, Harry turns on his heel and heads straight for the Ministry’s cafeteria.
” He repeats, in a voice raised to a not-quite yell. He is all of a sudden too weak to scream the way he really wants to.
There’s a daybed in Draco’s personal quarters that is settled into an alcove. Thin, gauzy curtains are clipped to a metal railing, giving the illusion of privacy. Harry outfitted the day bed with knitted blankets and an excessive amount of pillows and plush toys, mindful of Draco’s need to nest. He’d covered a few of them with his scent. Draco is hugging one such toy to his chest, half reading the aged diary of one of his Malfoy ancestors, when the curtains are drawn.
Harry does. The implications of it all are settling in like pins and needles, making his skin crawl with very real fear. He buries it quickly--he’s had years of training in abandoning that particular emotion.
In a flash of brilliant white light, a snake falls writhing to the ground. Once it rights itself, a rolling hiss falls from its mouth, neck flaring out to the sides in a brilliant display. Harry kneels as it slithers over to him, coiling to strike. And then he speaks. “
He slides his hand down Draco’s neck, massages gently over his bondmark with his thumb. Draco hums, eyes fluttering closed. Then, after a few moments of silence, he perks up.
“I love you, too,” Draco says, squeezing the dragon tighter to him. Every time Harry says it first, Draco is afraid he might fly apart at the seams in the best way. Harry’s arm lands around his waist, his hand splaying over his stomach, and everything is neatly gathered right back where it belongs.
They decide to have their first match in the gardens, away from most prying eyes. As they’re preparing for the day, Draco asks his maids for light summer robes, which Harry promptly vetoes.
“Well, it’s because he was utterly insufferable, of course,” Draco says, with relish. “But he wasn’t
Draco lets out a noise of outrage as Vince and Greg dissolve into knowing laughter. As junior Death Eaters, they’re probably well aware of the gossip. Theo rolls his eyes, unimpressed, and Blaise chuckles behind his hand. Daphne makes her way into their little sitting area, and when she sees Draco, her eyes light up.
“So what you mean,” Draco says, through grit teeth. “Is that you almost killed us. You almost killed my baby.”
Father had only suffered the presence of house elves at Malfoy Manor, scandalized at the thought of any Muggleborns or Half-Blood putting their hands on his person. For the first month of Draco’s marriage, he’d been ill at ease, finching away from every human member of the Newcastle estate aside from Harry. He clearly remembers every sad smile and accepting sigh, every doe-eyed house elf assuring him of his safety, every spare moment spent sticking his head out of the window in a desperate bid for reaching the wild magic, something he’d flimsily explained away as a need for “fresh air.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says. “Can I see your wand? They’ll probably want to see what spell you used.”
He gives Harry a quick peck on the lips and then pushes him gently out of the room. Laughing, Harry hangs his outer dress robes on one of the hallway racks and does as he was bid, sinking into a chair. A few minutes later, Draco joins him with papers clutched to his chest. He climbs into Harry’s lap, and hands the paper over.
Draco opens his mouth to protest, but Harry’s’ fingers thrust forward, spreading him open. He rolls his hips back into the feeling, and then rocks forward, the friction scoring the sensitive underside of his cockhead over Harry’s robes.
“If you want to be of any help to your friends, Mr. Potter, I suggest you act soon,” is what Davies says, the moment Harry steps into the office he shares with Auror Beauregard. “We’re thinking Weasley is going to get the Kiss.”
Anezka’s chin wobbles. She lowers her head and lets out a weak sob. Draco raises his hands to his head, shakily running his hands through his hair. There they stay for a few agonizing moments, suspended in the aftermath of this ugly truth.
Anezka turns her head to face him, and she smiles, though it doesn’t reach her eyes. “Draco! How are you?”
She asks Kreacher if he’ll accompany her, knowing how much he likes to visit his old home, and he agrees with a grumbly, “If it please the Little Miss,” and before long she’s holding his hand and waving goodbye to her family before they step through the Floo. She catches Grandfather’s tight frown just before they end up on the other side in Grimmauld Place, with Aunt Andromeda standing there by the fireplace, her hands on her hips.
It sends a similar warmth rolling through Draco, and they just smile at each other for a bit, probably giddier over the whole affair than is warranted. Still, the anticipation eases some of the frustration of his body rebelling against all sense.
“I am well, thank you. And yourself?” Theo asks, giving Harry perhaps the most strained look he’s ever seen from him.
Draco squirms against his side, something Harry has become to recognize as a sign that whatever he’s going to say is embarrassing him. “Well…”
“I just don’t get how something like that could be passed down as an heirloom. Why not… jewelry, or a photo album or something?” Harry asks.
He's not expecting Draco to nod, so he gapes for a moment before doing just that. He doesn't want to push it, so he does it just enough to display the lacy bralette beneath. He cups one breast, rubbing his thumb curiously over the hardened nub of his nipple. Draco purrs again, grinding down against him. Al can feel the head of his cock parting those folds, bumping against his cock where it rests up top.
on themselves unblinkingly. Harry ducks as the hags sail towards him, and in a fit of irritation shoots a freezing spell at upwards. The added weight drops them down to the ground. Bellatrix’s eyes flash at him in irritation, and Harry looks away, uninterested in engaging. He always slides into a particular apathy, in these moments. The detachment is the only thing that makes it easy for the killing curse to work. His colleagues like to play with their food, or they may pretend that they do for the sake of appearances, but Harry has very little to prove. He does what he always does, and kills indiscriminately.
Draco flushes. Pair upon pair of curious eyes are turning his way, eager for information. He clears his throat. “What about him?”
Sonja Avery is quite fond of making barely polite jabs at all within their society save her son (and the Dark Lord, who according to Father finds her entertaining). As the mother of the current Minister, she’s also impervious to most intimidation by virtue of her station. She writes an entirely superfluous column on whatever amuses her. Draco spent many a late night at Hogwarts fussing over it with Pansy and Daphne, gasping and laughing over so and so’s ill-advised affair and that person’s troupe of servants who looked suspiciously like their libertine spouse and the mishaps of the London season.
"The towel was too much, so I tried to use magic and I bullocksed it up. Please be careful in the washroom."
He’d disliked her quite a bit when he first met her that day in the Colosseum, and Draco often complained about enduring her excited tangents during noble gatherings, but now he wonders if he hadn’t misjudged her. He’d been in her position not that long ago, making faux pas after faux pas and generally doling out free entertainment with his cluelessness.
“Grandfather listens to me play sometimes,” Lily explains, unsurprised when Aunt Luna materializes a pen and pad and begins scribbling away. She takes her usual place, sitting beside Lily at her upright, the sunlight beaming in through the windows hitting the pale gold of her eyelashes fetchingly.
He learns through photos and off-handed remarks that he looks a lot like Father did, at his age, aside from the hair that apparently needs to be tamed. He and Albus are fraternal, night and day, most similarities in expressions and turns of phrase. But they’d never outgrown the errant curls of their early youth. (Dad’s fault, Father says, ignoring the way his hair begins to spiral at the ends when he lets it grow out too long.)
“Kreacher,” Malfoy is saying, in that irritatingly simpering tone of voice that means he’s Up To No Good, “would you mind putting this by Master Sirius’ bedside for me?”
Daddy waves a hand. She can feel the leftover glass lift from her bed and her floor, breaking in reverse, before her lights are restored and casts the both of them in a gentle green glow. Daddy’s always doing wandless, wordless magic in the house, and it’s never made her feel safer than it does now. He pulls her duvet back and hugs her tightly to his chest, stroking her hair. Once she’s calmed, he pulls back, wiping her face clear, uncaring of how gross it all is. He asks if she's hurt, gently checking her scratches, and then pulls her back into another hug when more tears slip down her face against her will.
Viktorovich laughs humorlessly and begins pacing. “Dark Lord uses all of you to take the world. If somebody stop him, maybe we get it back. If not, no surprise if the sky rains ash until the sun eats Earth. You people, you march into
“You don’t understand how much of a waste it is!” Dolohov protests, before Thicknesse can think of a proper retort.
-Harry and Ron are Not On Good Terms, which could be stressful to read? Struggled with whether or not this warranted a warning, but here it is just in case
As he was hoping, the nickname mollifies Harry into a sullen, attentive silence. Draco smiles despite himself. Harry always gets so proud when Draco calls him that. He takes his role so seriously.
With that, the room erupts into low chatter. Harry’s stomach drops. Several people are asking the boy if he knows which neighborhoods were targeted, and he is answering them as quickly as possible. Voldemort has adopted a veneer of calm, but Harry can feel the rage rolling off of him in waves. It is in deliberately lowered shoulders and pale lips pressed thin and the slant of glowing red eyes.
“That doesn’t sound like a very fun game,” Draco huffs out, even though he can feel himself releasing another embarrassing rush of slick. Harry rarely denies him anything in bed, and yet the thought of this is making him weak.
Nagini uncoils herself. Draco swallows, affixes his best look of awe onto his face, and asks, “What did she say?”
Her earlier query is abandoned entirely in favor of Draco’s explanation of his attempt at combining Dreamless Sleep with the Draught of Peace. He’s hoping to get some relief from nightmares and has been corresponding with Healer Ouedrago to ensure safety. It’s a temporary fix--Dreamless Sleep is notoriously addictive, and Draco doesn’t want to risk hurting his child--but one he sorely needs until he can wrestle his sleep schedule back into normalcy.
It’s nearing midnight by the time Harry leaves the Ministry, tense and so agitated he has to consciously avoid grinding his teeth together. Harry has done some awful things in his life. He’s killed and enjoyed it. He’s tortured. He’s contributed to the destruction of cultures and the fall of nations. And yet, he can’t remember feeling as torn up about any of that as he feels in this moment.
Something about Blishwick just sets Harry desperately on edge. Thankfully, he saved from further conversation by the arrival of several ostentatiously dressed people who Harry immediately clocks as new money. He resists the urge to roll his eyes. It might be a blessing in disguise. One of them is bound to try and chat Draco up, who is too well-mannered to cull a conversation with most people.
“That’s not fair,” Hermione says, her lips pursing into a frown. Then she grimaces, her hand rising up to her rounded belly.
The familiar crack of apparition follows. Malfoy smacks him upside the head, as if he weren't the one to cast the charms in the first place. Sirius saves himself an avalanche of complaints by stealing another kiss. There were certainly worse ways to approach that particular conversation.
Are you mad?” Harry yells. Noticing that he’s drawn more than a few curious gazes, he sighs and lowers his voice. “Let’s walk and talk.”
“What if you tell them I became ill?” He asks, throwing his arms around Harry’s neck. He spreads his thighs, gratified when Harry slides between them, right where he belongs. “What if you tell them I became deathly ill and you were worried about your heir so you needed to take me to see a Healer right away?”
--and then approaching the girl. He calls her an arch hypocrite, a piffler, and a jealous harpy. He methodically and systematically insults her family’s pedigree four entire generations back, confiscates her wand, and says that she’ll earn her tongue back when she learns how to address her betters. Insulting someone’s blood is pretty gauche these days, but it’s difficult not to find the promptness of Draco’s words darkly humorous. Draco’s Slytherin friends aren’t even trying to hide their amusement, tittering in that highborn way of theirs, ducking heads and smiling behind splayed hands. Harry exasperatedly takes the girl’s wand from (a suddenly very contrite) Draco, has one of his students take the girl to Madam Pomfrey, and then gives Draco detention with him for the rest of the month. Draco’s eyes light up. He can see some of Draco’s friends exchanging galleons.
Anezka has seen better days. This much is clear in lank hair, and glassy blue eyes set into pink-rimmed skin. She’s biting her bottom lip and shifting back and forth as she twiddles her thumbs, and startles the smallest bit when Harry says, “Please, take a seat.”
Draco opens his mouth to reply, but all the escapes his mouth is a low moan as Harry slides his fingers between damp cheeks and slides two fingers into him, meeting very minimal resistance before Draco’s hole eagerly sucks him in. He takes himself in hand at Harry’s soft command. Harry leaves off the nipple he’s been playing at before switching to the other, tongue flicking out over the hard peak. His thighs fall open, trembling with each searching pump of Harry’s fingers. He presses in at a few angles before he finally finds what he’s looking for, evidenced by the way Draco whimpers, abandoning his cock to grip Harry’s wrist for support.
Harry leads Draco out in the confusion of the crowd, and they frogmarch through the many gates leading to the exit, waved on by wide-eyed ushers. The moment they make it outside, Draco begins pacing, his arms crossed over his chest.
Harry opens the door with a heavy sigh and steps in. Ministry holding cells are as utilitarian as they come, outfitted with a shower, toilet, sink, table, and a cot for sleeping. Observers can see through the small window on the doors, but occupants cannot see out. It’s a desperately unstimulating space to be in, especially for someone like Fred, who has settled on his cot with his head cradled in his hands, knees jumping frenetically.
Mother leads him to the Hall of Ancestors, and some of the strange, pleasant homesickness he was feeling leaves him in a rush. Every private talk he’s ever had with Father in the room, lined with the portraits of Malfoy heirs and spouses, has been a harsh one. The portraits, who would sometimes offer the odd interjection but mostly observe in severe silence, only served to drive home whatever point about family honor Father was trying to make at the time. Such talks had become less common as Draco grew older, and he’d been spared one even after all of his vocal and disrespectful complaints about his impending marriage to Harry, mostly because Father hadn’t wanted him to marry, either. It was foolish to think these scoldings were over, though, and he supposes they are long past due at this point.
Luckily no one holds him with their eyes, but he can see that they’re watching. There are so many other couples around them. Draco can see one woman riding her lover with unbridled enthusiasm, her head thrown back, clutching at the hands taking greedy handfuls of her breasts. Another couple is tied, and the Omega melting onto the ground below looks suspiciously like Colin, something Draco privately vows to lord over him, because he certainly hadn’t had their permission to attend. So many people around them, bathed in the glow of their fires, and these Death Eaters only have eyes for Draco.
But he can’t. So it stays in his desk drawer locked behind various protective charms, waiting for him to pull it out and stare at it, wondering if his world is going to shift the moment he lets them into his head.
He gets three crooked smiles in return, all Dad. He’s probably making the same face right back at them.
Draco jolts on a particularly heavy push inside, tightening around Harry hard enough that it sends a pleasant ache rolling through him.
He feels a kiss land on his temple from behind. “I’m sure it will. Don't do that again without asking first.”
Crabbe stumbles and pauses. With a grumble, he aims his wand at the ground and casts a drying charm. The gust of air sends the pink haze scattering apart. He winces in disgust at the sight of a gnarled corpse half submerged in sludge-like soil, so bald and damaged as to appear genderless. Half of the face has been eaten away to expose the muscle beneath. Chipped white teeth are peeking through where the flesh thinnest. The withered fingers are curled around the imprint of a wand in the ground, though all that’s left of it is what looks like ash.
Draco flushes when he turns around with one of his hands covered in his own release. What Harry wants to do is lick his hand clean, but there's no use overwhelming him right now. He reaches into his pockets and lets a cleaning charm wash over Draco's hand, and then kisses the back of it, like he did all those weeks ago. Draco is goggling at him, but then he's beaming, looking all to the world like the cat that got the cream.
now includes him, however contentiously. Draco had once mused to him that it seemed like Muggles and Muggleborns have more freedom than Half-Bloods when it came to starting families, and in a way, it is true. The reasons it is allowed, however, are deeply sobering. He can feel his temper rising, but he doesn’t even know who it’s focused at. There are so many possible targets, including Hermione herself. He takes a sip of his tea. It’s bland and unenhanced. He finds that it’s a flavor he’s been missing, though he didn’t know until just now. There’s comfort in simplicity.
“I barely feel prepared for one!” Draco says, turning his face into Harry’s neck. “I didn’t think I would
They turn a familiar corner, and he notes with some surprise that he has been lead back towards the wing of the Citadel where he and Harry are staying. He does not know where Thicknesse is staying, but he does not remember sharing his location with anyone who would have reason to tell others. He blinks, and then laughs lightly at himself. It was silly of him to forget just how closely the inner circle must collaborate to do their work. Of course Thicknesse would know where they are staying.
Also, I feel like the new summary implies a slow-burn, so here is my first and last warning that this fic is not one. Actually, considering how self-indulgent this work is, I think it’s fair to say it’s a fast-burn in the romance department.
“That you, niece? Away with you,” he says, in a hoarse rasp. “I told you I don’t want to play exploding snap for the fourth bloody time in a row.”
“I’m not going to use any magic right now,” he says, at length. “I don’t have the right equipment, anyway. I want to see if there’s anything I can suss out from just reading.”
He grins when Draco punches him lightly on the shoulder, and then his face pinkens into a rare flush as Draco expresses his heartfelt thanks.
“I understand that you have quite a bit of responsibility on your shoulders, in terms of your family obligation. You and my nephew are expected to have your own heir, and then provide an heir for the Malfoy line, am I correct?” He asks this like it isn’t common knowledge.
Al comes just like that, like a shot, gasping and sobbing his release into Draco's collarbone, knot pulsing forth. He moves a hand down just in time, fingers sliding slickly where they're joined, to grip at it, soothing the need to just punch it in. He'd love nothing more than to tie with Draco, but they haven't had that conversation yet. He can feel some of his release dripping out around them, trailing lazily over his balls and probably down onto the velvet below. Draco's writhing on his lap, moaning weakly. Al helps him off his cock, eyes drawn to the trail of wetness that connects them and then breaks. He goes easily as Al pushes him onto his back, so trusting that it has something catching in Al's throat.
Draco nods, and then presses close, slender arms wrapping around him in a tight hug. He laughs and puts up a theatrical fuss as Harry immediately begins scenting him, nuzzling his face into the slender neck and along soft cheeks.
Beauregard leans back in her chair, brows furrowed. “Yes, according to the others, the woman said she could ‘take you in dead or alive’, does that sound right?”
Draco murmurs something. Harry reaches out and squeezes his shoulder. “I can’t hear you, sweet boy.”
Father already has the cauldron going when Scorpius knocks on the door to the brewery--none of them are allowed in without permission. Father spells the door open for him, and raises a brow. “Do you know what we’re making?”
“Why are you squeezing the spinach, Hilda?” Draco asks, half an hour into their companionable semi-silence.
“I just want to be good for you, Daddy,” Draco whispers, his eyes intent on Harry’s hands as they undo button after ribbon after button.
They link arms and take a turn in the halls, catching up in low voices. Draco is filled with a particular nostalgia he hasn’t experienced in a long time. He’d missed the manor more than anything, in the early days of his marriage, missed the glass chandeliers and winding staircases and even the odd little elf who’d patiently played dress up games with him as a child despite, shaking all the while in fear at the idea of Father finding them.
“Here is my advice for you, dear,” She says, as one of her desk drawers opens with a low, grinding sound. A roll of parchment unravels itself, and her overactive quill zips into the air to dip itself into the pot of ink on one hand of her desk. “Stop with that potion and tire yourself out. Your mate has told me you’ve become a bit of a homebody. I would like you to go outside and take walks. If you can’t bring yourself to do that, take a swim in the pool. Most importantly, test your magic--ah, with supervision! Nothing too strenuous or dangerous! But after your run-in with magical exhaustion, it’s important that you get back into the habit of using your magic regularly. If you’ve got to deal with a baby with a strong sire and your own restlessness, it’s no wonder you’ve been having a hard time.”
Harry sighs and turns back to Draco, who already has a look of resigned acceptance on his face. “I’m sorry, baby. Tell me in person?”
Harry shrugs, rubs a hand on Draco's arm as they walk on. “Well, they can be dead useful. The Dark Lord is a resourceful man. If the Muggles were making something of use to us, and we can figure out a way to do it better and make it work, well… we do it.”
Harry hums an affirmative. Draco smiles, mostly because he can smell Harry before he feels him. His senses have been ratcheted up of late, which is a double-edged sword if anything, but it’s always nice to be able to tell when Harry is coming a little sooner than usual. Warm hands smooth over his upper back, and a kiss is pressed onto the back of his neck.
Harry, usually so sure-footed, stumbles on his way to their plush bed and gives him a wide-eyed look.
The world is a dull roar of noise. Distant drums and druidic song travel across the expansive fields, carried on the warm breeze. As is customary, they feed each other with their hands, sharing sweet breads and lush berries, seared meats and tangy cheeses. Draco shares embarrassing stories from his childhood. Harry listens raptly. His warm attentions strip the tension from his shoulders in layers, until he’s loose-limbed and nursing low-level arousal. It isn’t long before muffled cries begin to reach their ears, and Harry gives him an amused look, brows rising.
It doesn’t feel like there’s any particular build up to his orgasm. It happens between one breath and the next, and then he’s bucking and coming completely untouched, spurting his release onto the sheets below, and then Harry’s rucking his hips up with insistent hands and pushing his knot past inside, the weight of it delicious and heavy as Draco's cunt flutters and contracts around it. Then Harry’s bending over him, his teeth finding the swollen gland on his neck and biting down. Delicious pain blossoming through Draco's neck in waves as those blunt teeth break skin, and they’re finally bound together, for all of Pureblood society to see.
Infuriated, Draco rises to his feet. Father gapes at him, his surprise echoed by the muffled gasps of their family portraits. “I am beginning to tire of being criticized for breaking a foolish law when my child’s life was in danger. Say what you will, Father, but if you were hoping I would admit to some sort of failing on that front, you will be disappointed.”
Draco reaches up and covers Harry’s hand with his own, eyes wide and earnest. He shakes his head no, and thanks Harry for telling him. Harry should move his hand away, but he realizes with a start that he hasn’t been touched with any measure of care or affection since the day Ron and Hermione hugged him goodbye on his way to Hogwarts, months and months ago. And there’s this--understanding, in the air, between the two of them. They’ve had many such moments, but this one feels the most important.
“Yes. And I know--I know it’s, well. That I don’t need to ask you for things. But I like asking. I like knowing that you’ll say yes. Does that make sense at all?”
“Then the floor started shaking, and I looked up and I was afraid the ceiling was going to fall, so I used
The admission causes a brief uproar. A few people rise from their seats in outrage, and others quickly turn to their neighbors to discuss. Harry glimpses Draco’s parents staring down in muted shock.
The rest of the hour passes in a quiet kind of anticipation. Their potion gradually changes from a dark, mustard yellow to the obnoxiously bright shade Harry vaguely remembers from that frustrating class in Sixth Year. Draco’s in his element, slender finger following along the instructions, his other hand wandlessly circling the stirrer in their cauldron, or imperiously directing Harry into one job or another. His wavy hair reflects fetchingly against the bright light bursting from the cauldron, pale blonde shining gold, and the few times their eyes meet, his face lightens on a smile. He’d tease Harry relentlessly for musing aloud that he might not need the potion after all, but he’s sure it’s true.
Draco nods wordlessly, and then climbs into Harry’s lap, arms wrapping around his neck. Harry rocks him back and forth and glances back towards the main estate. He sees nothing but a clear blue sky.
Draco leans in, like he might try to steal another kiss, and Harry stills him with a hand on his chest. They’re of a height, Draco only a few inches taller, but he seems
“But, we will need you and the others from that day as witnesses for the upcoming trial. You must not lie in front of the Wizengamot, as you know. My worry is that you might face unwanted, erm, social consequences. We can't protect you from that.”
“You’re smarter than that, sir,” Davies says, giving Harry a sympathetic look. “He took responsibility for cooking the entire thing up.”
She sends him a reply that’s dripping with polite surprise, inquiring after his health, and his friends, and his work in the Auror program. Then, she finishes with a simply worded post script:
Harry croons, a hand running up and down his side. “Shh, it’s okay, I’m being dramatic. Your scent right now, it’s--driving me mad.”
He doesn’t mind it. If anything, he’s relieved to see Draco entertaining a friend. He gets lonely when Harry is away and sleeps poorly more often than not. Harry just wasn’t expecting to feel so wrong-footed about the entire thing.
Daphne and Pansy support him as they leave on the other side of the alley. The cawing of the birds and the woman’s choking gasps are ringing in his ears. He doesn’t know how much longer they walk before pulling to another stop. It is promising to see other people gathered in tight groups, who look them over with mixed worry and despair, all of them in similar disarray. A pair of red-robed people approach them, only to falter in shock when Draco raises his wand to them.
When Harry tells him about their guests, the first thing Draco says is, “Maybe I should make myself scarce when they’re around.”
Draco’s parents established a secondary vault for him not soon after his birth, as is customary for any family in good standing. It’d been transferred to the care of the Potter family vaults upon his marriage to Harry, who began casually adding to it despite the glut of inheritance that already lay inside. He’s never acknowledged it, but it has always made Draco flush in guilty pleasure to be reminded of it. It’s the height of excess, and certainly not needed, but welcome in a way he doesn’t have the words to express.
“And I look after the people I care about. Used to get a lot of grief from my friends for being intense.”
He catches the fresh wave of tears before they fall completely, wiping them gently off Draco’s flushed cheeks. Healer Ouedraogo walks back in right as Harry cups Draco’s face and dots his forehead with smacking, staccato kisses. She chuckles as Draco whines and pushes at Harry’s shoulders, complaining that he’s an overgrown child.
Harry bucks up into him, eyes locked onto his face. Draco keens and leans forward, planting his hands on Harry’s broad chest as he begins bouncing on Harry’s cock. Harry meets him thrust for thrust, unrelenting, his hands bruisingly tight on Draco’s hips.
He’s still new to this, but he likes the strange power it gives him, knowing that he’s the one making his Alpha feel good. Harry brushes his other hand against Draco’s cheek, watching as Draco bobs his head, tracing his tongue along the heavy length. He’ll never get used to the weight of it in his mouth, and he doesn’t want to.
The Citadel is stark and severe in varying shades of white and black marble, chaotically decorated with paintings and artifacts looted from the people the Dark Lord’s forces have conquered. There’s a calculated disorder in the still paintings and busts and shifting magical items locked behind wards. On the way, they pass the remainder of the glittering Imperial eggs taken from Russia. Voldemort has absently mentioned wanting to complete the set, but they’re scattered around the world--and one of them is lovingly displayed in Draco’s things back at the estate in Newcastle. Taking it had been impulsive (he’d been thinking only of trying to participate in the celebrations his new mate held dear), but staring at the rest of the set is an ugly reminder that some of their suffering is of Harry’s making.
A year later, after Lily was born, he’d started his own restaurant, simply named “Potter’s.” Dad doesn’t speak much about the muggles who raised him, “But they taught me how to cook well enough, I suppose.”
Harry’s gapes openly as she approaches the projection and points first to one small, amorphous shape, and then another. “You mean—”
Harry’s friends sometimes stop by the study to talk. Unless it’s deemed especially private, the Alphas Ron and George are always stopped at the door to talk from a distance if Draco is resting, a quiet act of claiming that never fails to make Draco squirm in guilty pleasure. He feels a little guilty for listening in when he can, but he can’t always help when he’ll fall in and out of a doze.
Al watches as they sleepily exchange gifts and giggle quietly over the silly little messages they’d penned each other. Father bullies Dad relentlessly for his awful handwriting, as usual. Kreacher brings them plates of homemade eggnog and puts up his usual fight about there being presents for him, but then he snaps his fingers and summons the gifts they know he bought for them, and then leaves, having suffered his daily quota of odd wizards and their affection.
Sonja Avery’s mansion is nested towards the very back of a gated community in Richmond. Two footmen meet them by the front gates to guide them inside. The mansion is a beautiful eggshell blue on the outside, the vast green lawn overtaken by a grand fountain decorated with enchanted statues of mermaids wringing their hair into the clear water. Daphne waves excitedly at one, laughing in delight when it winks at her.
After a drawn-out silence, Minister Avery sighs and rests his forehead in his hand. “Please leave the chamber, Mama.”
She dares to reach out and take his hand so she can lead him to the music room. Whenever she tries to talk about what happened with Nan that day, her throat closes right up, like the time she’d figured out she had an allergy to raspberries. Maybe she can start making up for it in other ways, bit by bit.
His first inclination had been to tell the truth--that he has very few truly good days, that he might lose his husband if he can’t satisfy the whims of a genocidal madman, that he’s going halfway across the world to kill someone next year, with grievous collateral damage sure to follow. But it also feels distinctly unfair to lay such troubles at her feet, considering the wealth and security he’s gained for it all.
The other letters left for him are not as immediately frustrating as the howlers, but no less stressful for it. There’s a letter from Auror Davies asking him back to the department to discuss next steps; another from Pansy’s father Harlan, always eager for business support (working with him had been one of many partnerships astutely recommended by Pettigrew as a way to generate wealth); several dozen from a menagerie of wizarding publications desperate to get some word from him on current events, or at the very least some photos of Draco around the home in domestic bliss. Apparently his pregnancy has created quite the buzz in societal pages, Merlin save them.
“Well, I threatened to tell my father unless they told me everything. They begged me for mercy. You’re not supposed to share anything when you’re in the Order, but they were new. Eager. Their mission had been to scope out who among my father’s friends would be amenable to sponsor someone, and they’d gone too far and ended up… well, erm.” Anezka pauses, her face reddening.
It takes some work to get him up. Daphne is assisted by multiple shaking hands, and he’s lifted up up up until his head lists back. He opens his eyes, and he can see the sky through the jagged opening in the ceiling, still blackened by its hoard of agitated travelers.
His orgasm sneaks up on him, catches right behind his belly button in a burst of heat, makes his heart skip. He cries out Harry’s name, squeezes the head of his cock where it’s oozing streaks of warm come. Harry bats his hand away and swallows him down to the root, wet mouth a searing warmth around his twitching length. He gasps and bucks up into it, thrashing and curling his hands in the bedsheets just for an anchor. Harry sucks his release down, humming low, throat rippling.
When they’re done, Harry presents a bundle of blankets and clothes for nesting. He is content to be directed this way and that for optimal snuggling. The moment his breathing settles into the familiar back and forth of a doze, Draco reaches underneath his pillow, points the tip of it at his head, and whispers, “
“We must discuss how we will seize the school proper, if this plan is successful,” Voldemort announces. “I hope it won’t surprise you to know that I am trusting the senior Death Eaters in this room to lead the charge with me.”
Everyone chuckles. Mr. Bulstrode smirks, clearly pleased with his own wit. And just like that, the strange air around them disperses into something less unbearably tense. Draco sighs. He and Mother are quickly subsumed by their peers, patted reassuringly on their shoulders. It takes a while for the excitement to die down and normal conversation to continue, providing Mother with the gossip they came for. It isn’t anything especially new, which is comforting. What he really wants to do is return to St. Savior’s, but Mother would never allow them to make an exit after such upset. She needs to control the narrative of what happened to how she sees fit, or she won’t rest.
“Either the sea or the prisoners, Mr. Potter, sorry for the lack of warning. You get used to it after being on rotation for a while.” The Auror squeaks.
By “everything,” she means her father’s recent success as a trader of rare potions ingredients, lifting them from relative anonymity as a family of dubious heritage to one of the many new money clans that Father complains about having to work with on the regular. It takes everything in his power not to make an unkind comment about it all, and the thought that he almost lowered himself to doing it makes his cheeks flush angrily. Harry would be so disappointed in him for making comments about someone’s blood status, after everything.
“I can play for you if you want,” She mumbles, suddenly finding her chicken tikka masala extremely interesting.
, violence, general disturbing imagery, etc (this section is in italics if you feel like you might need to skip it. I've summarized it on my
“Begging your pardon, ma’am,” The Muggle gasps out, gritting his teeth against whatever magic is coursing through his system. “I’m awfully sorry. I didn’t mean anything by it. I was trying to make my way back, honest…”
“I need it, Daddy, fuck me,” Draco whimpers, lifting his hips as Harry draws closer, leaning down for a kiss.
“No joke! If you went poking around in some archives you’d probably find several dozen photos of me just popping away.” Harry snorts.
Anezka squeezes his hand again. “It’ll make sense soon, I promise. Draco, the things she told me about her life at home… Her mother being ashamed of her, her stepfather being cruel, all the things people would say to her in the hallways. She was miserable, Draco, the entire time I knew her. Yet she’d always find time to smile and cheer me up in dusty old classrooms.”
“Mr. Thicknesse? Is everything alright?” He asks, shrinking back at the blank look on the man’s face.
Harry blinks up at the man. Then he pulls away and looks at Draco, who has turned his face away. “The… baby?”
And so they collect themselves and leave, accompanied by Blaise and his mother Ilaria, who looks as unfairly beautiful as always. She takes one look at Draco’s face and gives him a wink, then proceeds to use her charm to redirect other guests away from him and Harry in each and every household they visit.
“At first it was because it was difficult to talk about. Then I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to worry you.”
“DO NOT PRESUME TO ASK ANYTHING OF ME. I WILL DO AS I PLEASE,” Voldemort bellows, his voice bouncing unnaturally off of the walls.
Harry smiles and ducks his head. Draco has taken to using the nickname more often behind closed doors. It’s silly, but it feels almost like a title he’s earned, a reminder of Draco’s trust in Harry as his Alpha. It’s one of the few welcome changes in the face of everything else that’s happened to them.
Draco reaches into his pockets and presents the vial to Harry, enjoying the way the fire’s warm glow bounces off its dark red color. “I would hate for this to go to waste.”
“Well, what?” Harry laughs, reaching under Draco’s robe to poke him in the side. Then he gets distracted by the softness of his skin and splays a covetous hand over his hip.
Some of James’ fondest earliest memories are of Father tutting over that, reaching out to slap one pale hand against Dad’s when he messed up a cursive letter. “Stop it, I won’t have you making my children write like common fools,” he’d say, an amused dimple creasing his cheek despite himself at Dad’s grumbled complaints. Now, dad’s iconic print is a staple on all his products, something the wizarding world at large views with affection. The Boy Who Lived, ex-Auror and chef extraordinaire, equipped with possibly the world’s worst handwriting.
He hadn’t taken Draco like that without purpose, though he does find himself regretting it a bit more every time Beltane is hinted at. He’d been high off of the thrill of good duels, still privately fuming about the eyes roving over Draco’s body, and half-rut drunk from the potion. He’d wanted to stake his claim, to prove that he was the only one who could possibly hope to keep Draco safe and satisfied. After they’d finished, Harry laid Draco on his back and carefully soothed him down from his giggly, fucked out high. He’d kissed and petted and praised him for taking his knot so well. He’d wiped him clean by hand, head to toe, occasionally dropping his head to press his lips onto soft pink skin. He remembers making very deliberate eye contact with their audience, asking, “Are you mine?” and reveling in the way their eyes flashed in the firelight when Draco babbled, “
-General gore warning for disturbing imagery and deaths described in various levels of detail, though they are minor characters. In particular the Death Eaters invade a school and kill regardless of age. While I made the conscious decision not to describe children’s death super explicitly, it is heavily implied
The London edict regarding travel in and out of London had been lifted in early March, but Harry’s place in the ongoing investigations has seen them rooted firmly in their place at St. Savior’s House. Many families had been happy to leave the city for their proper homes, Draco’s parents included, and while Draco longs for Newcastle with each passing day, it is still a powerful relief to step out of London and into another place he once called home. Wiltshire--and thus, the Manor--has not changed one bit.
Lily would pass this time making funny faces or doing little dances to coax the real smile out of her. Making Nan laugh, really laugh, was always something she was always proud of. It’d been worth it to sit through Nan pressing dress after frilly dress into her arms, cooing and humming over what worked best.
They share a look, clearly annoyed. Harry rolls his sleeves up. He can tell the exact moment they see his Dark Mark--their expressions shutter into neutrality. Murmuring their apologies, they take their leave.
Draco sits down, eyes welling with frustrated tears. “So you’ve established that I’m a disappointment. I am not sure what you expect me to do.”
Draco lets out a shuddering breath. Harry runs his hands up and down his arms until the trembling stops.
Harry’s friends tend to congregate in one of the smaller leisure rooms, sitting together by the fire with books or card games in hand, in a sort of comfortable bubble. None of them are ever unkind, and Hermione is actually quite kind, if overly talkative, but they always tense up as one when they see him, as if they’re waiting for a shoe to drop. It’s unsettling in a way he can’t quite name, and it’s becoming more and more difficult not to let resentment take root. He’s doing his best to be a good host. He’s lucky he doesn’t have an Alpha who boasts the sort of guests Mother had been expected to entertain when Draco was a child.
He can read pages and pages of a book without absorbing anything, he turns his parents away because he knows they’re just aching to launch into dramatics about Harry’s “horrible influence,” and he’s too worried about the looks on people’s faces to leave. Enduring two days of poorly disguised ostracization had been enough for him. Only Daphne and Pansy are allowed inside their quarters, and occasionally Sonja, who regales him with court gossip as if nothing has changed.
Draco kisses him softly. They taste like confectioners sugar, he thinks, and Harry smells especially good today. They continue on, eventually transitioning to the usual house calls.
“Merlin,” Harry says, and his voice sounds a bit more distant than it was a moment ago. “You and these lacy knickers.”
“So you’ll help me get dressed again. I miss you,” He adds, completely eradicating the last of Harry’s self-control.
Whatever Draco was expecting to hear next, it wasn’t this. He swallows. “My lord, Harry is very protective. I truly believe that he wouldn’t have thought to teach me that spell if I hadn’t given him the impression that I’m utterly helpless on my own. Being so young, I know very little about how the world works...”
Of the many surprising benefits to Harry’s new marriage, unveiling the layers of Draco’s personality has been the best. He’s not a morning person. He has a sweet tooth, but he hates peppermint candies. Their continued dueling sessions quickly reveal a competitive streak a mile wide. He’s got a temper that rivals Harry’s, but he’s been trained to contain it from a young age. Only a frustrating day or his snooty little friends can tease the worst of it out of him. Aggression and teasing and good-natured nagging seems to be their love language, carefully serene faces at odds with unkind words. Each time Draco remembers that Harry might be watching, he flushes and subsides, clearly not realizing what a delight it is to witness. Above all, though, the sweetest is the way he takes to praise, to admiration. He’s very different from the whirlwind Omegas Harry grew up with. He’d loved them all, of course--it was they who taught him to fight, to make love with anything approaching skill, to listen in to chatty nobles when they were sure the help wasn’t listening. There is just something about Draco, sly and prim and sweet in his own bratty way, that makes Harry feel desperately protective. That scares him. He soothes it by doing things like this, hoping that imparting skills will keep Draco safe when Harry’s away.
The door creaks open behind him, and Harry turns around, prepared to snap at Bolotin if she’s returned with more unsolicited advice. What he sees, though, is a dark-haired young man with a baby in each arm. The faded mark on his neck clearly denotes him as an Omega, though one sleepy baby palming at his half exposed breast through his thin robe would have been just as good of an indicator. His eyes widen at the sight of Harry, and he begins babbling in Russian, freckled face reddening. Harry looks quickly away.
“It’s fine, love,” Harry whispers back. He kisses the side of Draco’s mouth, which has begun to tremble.
He wracks his brain for an excuse to beg off. His Dark Mark surprises him with a sting of heat, and he nods mutely instead.
The reply stings more than it probably should. Usually, Harry will always find some creative way to answer Draco’s questions about his work, no matter how vague or confidential he has to be.
“It was Ginny,” Harry says, pointedly not rising to Draco’s stormy look. “She broke up with me soon after that because she felt like I was suffocating her. Do you ever feel like I’m suffocating you?”
Pansy announces that her father is calling her home and thanks them profusely for allowing her to stay. Though Harry will genuinely miss the music, he sighs in relief the moment she steps through that floo.
As they draw closer, the dull roar of their cries crawls deeply into his ears and sets him on edge, even under the layered protection of the groundskeeper’s charm. Draco snuffles and pushes closer into Harry’s arms. Harry shushes him, but it’s too late--he awakens with a gasp.
. It isn’t as though he would pose a significant threat, but Harry understands and appreciates the sentiment.
Sokolov lets out a shuddering breath. “I am sorry, My lord. Please, do not punish my people for my mistakes.”
Before any more protests can follow, Harry guides him over to Mr. Blishwick himself, who’d apparently been attempting to hail them for the past few minutes. He’s a tall man, and quite broad for a Beta. He’s got long dark hair, save for the graying strands at his temples, and a well-trimmed beard. He’s handsome in the way that most Purebloods tend to be, obvious and deliberate breeding in his light brown skin, the high bridge of his nose, and the almond-shaped set of his eyes. Draco briefly sorts through the mental map of family trees in his head and recalls that Blishwick’s late mother was a Shafiq before her marriage.
