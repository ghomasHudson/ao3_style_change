“Okay, out with it,” Draco replied, opening one eye and fixing it on Harry in the dark tent.
“Yup,” Harry said, trying not to be smug. “What was the memory?”
, I've been avoiding this question for months now, but. Harry. Are you okay?"
Owen stumbled when they got inside. Something about this place was making his head swim with familiarity. But that couldn’t be right. He’d never been in a place building that was so resplendent, so full of grandeur. Of that, he was sure. Not to mention that he’d
He only just heard her mumble how hopeless he was as he left the classroom at a quick clip. He caught Draco by the elbow and whirled him around just as he turned the corner. For a split second, a glare lit up Draco’s face. It was a strange reality, to say that a glare lit up a face, but it was true. He returned, for that moment, to himself. It made Harry’s stomach lurch, then immediately after, fall into a melancholy that was familiar and painful.
He would do whatever the man needed. It’s what friends were for. In return, Draco never, under
right?” Hermione said to his left. He nodded. “And are we in agreement that is likely the same family name as escaped-Azkaban-Sacred-Twenty-Eight joy right?”
He could work on ignoring the fact that he thought Draco was possibly the most beautiful human he had ever seen. In the deepest, most private place he understood about himself, he’d thought this since school. Draco had been untouchable then, even more than now. The elite of the heritage kids, cold and aloof until the day he mysteriously disappeared. Harry was embarrassed to admit that the aristocratic features, the feather-light hair, the delicate line and curve of every part of Draco really did it for him. Blondes were, after all, his type.
“I said,” Draco murmured, nuzzling Harry’s stubble filled morning face. “I’m exhausted. I’m not running anywhere anytime soon.”
Draco shook his head. "Thanks though."
In response, Oscar immediately made himself indispensable. Within the first hour of meeting him, Oscar had fixed the leak in the pipes that neither Luna or Harry had been able to figure out, hung the hand-painted DA sign, and solved the problem of a theme for the grand opening.
Hours later—after Draco had left with the pre-packed bags, after Neville had appeared, flitting silently in the kitchen and not forcing him to talk—Harry still had not moved. He wasn't sure he had closed his mouth, in fact, from the shock of Draco's words. He kept waiting; for Draco to come back in, saying he was done thinking, that he hadn't meant it. Waiting for someone to jump out and explain it was a joke.
The happiness wasn’t uncomplicated. It also, however, wasn’t delicate or fragile. It developed roots that sunk into the Earth, one tendril for every wrong ever committed toward the other; it found its leaves reaching toward the sun, a future that was growing more beautiful each day, providing light and simplicity to all that rested near it.
Harry laughed again. “Fine. But don’t get frostbite. That would be embarrassing.”
"Oh, Harry,” she soothed once she noticed his attention shift to her. “You've got to tell me what happened. Seriously. You have to."
"Heard you played well, Malfoy. On Saturday. Sorry I missed it."
“He comes back from his leave Monday, right?” Potter nodded. “And I assume you haven’t told him about what happened?”
This fic was strange and tenuous from the start. It's ending that way too, in a hurried, undetailed sort of way. I'm sorry, but also I think it needed to be finished. Thanks for sticking around. Love, PDrarry <3
badly. Back then,” Draco admitted. “And like...maybe now? I needed to know.”
“I know you don’t trust me,” Draco said after a beat, looking at the ground and playing the very convincing role of ‘contrite human’. “I apologise, though it isn’t worth much, I know. That kid that I was? He was an arse. A bastard. A fucking
“Hello,” a posh voice called loudly from the back. Harry braced himself.
“Not Malfoy,” he allowed carefully. “My students call me Draco. Or Professor Draco.”
“May take some getting used to,” Harry replied with a grin as they ascended three flights of stairs.
He pushed his hair back as he dried his face and turned to find Diego leaning on the doorframe, watching him steadily through hooded eyes.
He dragged Harry into the break room early one morning and held him hostage. "Harry, mate,” he mumbled into his folded arms. “What's up? You seem… ill. D'you need that number of the doctor at Mungo's I go to? He's excellent. Maybe he can sort some… dunno, vitamins, or something."
He smiled.

. Not only was he fun, but he was also laid back, adventurous, and downright
“Finally,” Theo said, sounding bored. “Potter, don’t do anything stupid, and we’ll have no reason to come back here.” He looked around once more, derision etched into his pores, “

A moment later, Ron plunked a cup of coffee down and threw the latest waffle into the pan that was already in the oven. No eating until everyone was awake. Another brunch rule he’d desperately missed. The smell of this kitchen, the warm yellow walls, Ron whistling as he spooned the batter into the machine. Harry had been right. It
Having decided to walk from the Apparition point on Tottenham Court back to the flat, Pansy had lit a cigarette from the crushed pack she kept in the side pocket of her bag for emergencies. She was therefore quite distracted as she approached the porch, and it wasn’t until the last second that she noticed Theo leaning on the rail, hands stuck in his jacket pocket, looking off into the middle distance. She stubbed out the smoke as she took to the stairs and ignored him as she fished out her keys.
“Hi,” he said unceremoniously, moving to the side and letting Harry into the entry.
am here this year. And I know you. I know the real you.”
“And now, of course, he’ll be even more sanctimonious, thinking he was right all along and only he could have caught me out,” he whined.
But, the long and the short of it was this; Harry Potter was quick to forgive. Draco Malfoy was quick to judge, but quicker to reassess and adopt hopeless causes. They struggled to stay put, struggled to settle down, never stopped helping others. Draco kept his job, Harry his. They raised two children with a foot in both worlds, and when the children asked questions about the past, Harry would spin fantastic tales that made them both seem more heroic and romantic than they were. Draco would fill in with just enough truth that they would believe them.
Part one.
Seamus groaned. “Oh, here we go.”
"Harry. Oh Harry James. It was
“What?” Oscar demanded. “Why are you looking at me—oh, bugger it, have I overstepped? I'm sorry, I do that. Forget I—”
“I’m sorry,” Draco replied automatically.
Draco is distracted, so Harry finds the snitch quickly and easily. Thursday practices are short. Mora calls it moments later. He suspects she's a bit hungover.
“Makes sense,” Ron nodded. “He had...access.”
"What?" he explained. "I am not!"
For a week after learning the news, Draco ignored the niggling feeling in the pit of his stomach that he might be able to do something, some small thing, to help Potter out. He mostly ignored it because he didn’t know why he
"One," Harry says, holding up a finger, "that is the last time you ever use the word 'hero' around me."
“Dunno,” Draco shrugged, petting the soft, fuzzy feathers beneath his hand and too enamoured to rise to Harry’s taunting. Just as he responded, though, Buckbeak lowered his front legs to the ground and chuffed.
everything, Hare."
“Says the one who proposed to her husband with a skywriter.”
“Yes, I know,” she said impatiently. “Which is why you’re here, with the box. He said it would only be a week or two, but..well, I think I told him that he was underestimating grief. He seemed convinced that Harry would be fine. But no, that’s not what I meant. I meant, where are you keeping Travers?”
Resigning himself to needing to know, he slipped into the closest branch of his bank, just a few blocks up from the store. When he got to the teller, he handed over his card and swallowed down his panic as she frowned slightly and rescanned it.
“Yes,” Draco replied, just as shortly.
many problems with me liking them, and absolutely none of them are that he is a he.”
And so.
“No, what?” Harry pushed. “Back to what? Normal? No offence, Draco, but you don’t even know what that would mean for me. Truth is, you've only ever seen me fucked, Draco. At least as adults. If I recall, you weren’t a big fan of who I was before that.” “That’s not the point, Harry—” “Admit it, Draco,” Harry interrupted. “You’re scared that this is as good as it gets. You know what? Maybe it is. I will not be chained to a desk.”
As the months wore on, Harry got decidedly worse. He stopped trying to sleep at all, instead spending most nights wandering the house until passing out for an hour-long nap. He also stopped coming home from work at regular hours, preferring to be busy as long as possible. He took on case after case, offered to finish other people's paperwork, and when these things weren't enough, voluntarily filed things by hand, a job no one in the Ministry ever did.
In that week, he also moved some investments around and cashed out some royalties so that he could pay Gloria handsomely to stay his ‘manager’ and de facto personal assistant until the end of the year. Although he knew it wouldn’t be fair to keep her after that much time, he’d grown incredibly used to someone else running his life for him and he wasn’t quite ready to give it up. Since, he reasoned, she’d seem ecstatic when he’d asked, he was going to put his guilt away for a little while.
"D, you had a spell fuck with your emotions. I've been there. That's not exactly easy to deal with. How are you feeling?"
Five minutes later, Draco was back in his clothes from the day before and bundled in his coat beside Harry and his long, skipping stride. He laughed lightly.
Thirty-five minutes had passed, every single one of them spent with Draco staring at his phone screen. He hadn’t stopped alternating between tearing up and overwhelming fury since his meeting with the head Cursebreaker the day before. It wasn’t the type of mood one brought into the Ministry, but part of him
As he turned the corner to head up the west side-street, a flash of something in the near distance caught his eye. Initially, he’d assumed it was just a rogue coin or wrapper in the cobbles and he’d continued on his way. When it happened again, however, he turned more quickly and saw that the glint was coming off a tall figure in a dark coat. A tall figure in a dark coat, dark trousers, but with shining, too-long, silver-blonde hair. There wasn’t even really thought before Harry leapt to the side of the street and watched the figure get slightly further away, studying it from a distance. There was little doubt about it, though. The furtive, cautious figure was
happy. For the first three months of this increased workload, he had been. He revelled in the fact that he was trusted, a good Auror, triumphing over his initial doubts and hesitations. He loved coming home exhausted and hungry to find a whistling, soft-haired blond puttering about in the kitchen despite his insistence that he would not become Harry's '1950s housewife'. He'd been so grateful those first few weeks that he had often found inventive ways to reduce Draco to finishing meal prep in only his pants. Things were good. Yet, in the back of his mind, Harry wondered. He wondered how long he could go before the nightmares came back. He wondered how long it would be before the panic returned. But, although he did wonder these things, it seemed too good, too safe, too right, in those first three months, to bother questioning when it would all collapse.
"Well exactly. And when we're done here, were going to go eat waffles with my family. And then tomorrow, I'm coming with you to the Auror department. And the day after
hours from home.”
He rested his head against the cool wood of his front door for a moment before fishing out his keys with a sigh and resigning himself to having to go in if he was going to be able to take off his overly-warm jumper and shower.
“Never really came up, did it? Besides, I never used to...before,” Harry said.
Jumping back like he'd been shot, Carl's hands went immediately to his back pockets, an adorable habit that had once gotten Draco into his bed.
“No,” Harry replied, grinning beautifully. “But it’s more fun if you dress up. Ask Pansy to help you. She’ll know what to do.”
There was a story within the walls of the Hogwarts, new and yet treated like it was ancient. It was murmured amongst the students, passed in whispers between the staff, and rumoured to have been spread so deeply among the House Elves that it would be passed on for generations. The ghosts didn’t like to talk about it since it often created uncomfortable dividing lines between them. Apparently, the story required you to land on someone’s side, and that made the ghosts — infamous for allegiance to themselves and themselves alone — uncomfortable.
“Bull shit.”
He spun around and marched back down the hall.
He was completely out of chances.
sending Travers backwards and flat on the ground. Harry leapt forward trying to block an impending spell.
Amanda led him to the door, tucking his recently abandoned coat onto his shoulders again and smirking.
“So, you
sweet one, who was blushing in the streetlights and panicking. It made Draco’s own neck warm and he looked away. Harry had no more idea why Draco was here than he did. It was almost comforting.
"That may be so," she said, gesturing with her own price gun, "but I have 30 minutes left, and if I'm here, I don't have to be out
"I'm comfortable wherever, much to your obvious disbelief."
Draco threw his coat on a hook and grabbed an apron instead. He lugged a bag of potatoes through the storeroom and into the kitchen, where Theo had already pulled out a giant pot and found the salt, a thing that constantly went missing.
Answer me in five minutes or I’m coming to your flat.
crush on you. Back in my Holden shop days. You didn’t know?”
” Draco scoffed. “We
Despite the knowledge that he was going to need more help at some point, Harry didn’t remember to start looking. In the chaos of finishing the work on the building, Luna filled in the gaps of his ability to do everything all at once so well that he was able to ignore the fact that she was going to leave him at some point.
“Thanks, Filius.”
Draco woke up the next morning in a state of slight panic. Not only was he hungover for the second time in the span of a week, but now he was in a strange bed and with very little memory of his night after around the third pint. He scrambled out of the twisted sheets around him, and got up quickly. He ignored the dizzy vertigo and pain that spread through him from his head to his fingers and rushed out of the bedroom wildly. His eyes did not land first on the kitchen table or the familiar man sitting there but instead found the old, gnarled broomstick bolted to the wall over the mantle.
“I should have bought new parchment.”
“That’s good. He was already scared of you,” Draco laughed.
“Draco. Not. Done.” Harry sighed.
“The Blueberry?” Draco deadpanned.
"Oh you know, a drink. Or a meal if we are adventurous enough?" Harry pressed on. "A walk, even. Somewhere other than the Ministry. You. Me."
"Why are we headed to your vault?" he demanded. "What’s waiting for us there? The people who murdered my husband? Was it you? Trying to tie up loose ends, are you?
he'd spat.
“What?” Draco snapped.
We should check.”
she continued in her Theo voice. “Yes, thank you, darling. I know I shouldn’t have meddled, but I did. Hence the cigarette. Now, are we seriously going to keep doing this?”
They agreed to meet and Harry left with the box. He spent the rest of his evening eating snacks at the bar and making a list of things he understood and things he still needed to know. For the first time in months, the columns were almost even.
He took a deep breath, calmed his nerves. “Owen. Travers.”
, not the Malfoy’s. I was under no obligation to inform the board.”
“I told you, I’m not going,” he said, turning to look at her, grinning to find her decked out in her black party dress, turquoise jewelry that stood out gorgeously on her skin.
For all these changes, however, Harry had still not actually completed his task; he still had not slept with Draco Malfoy. The goal had silently changed, sure, but Harry was no less convinced that he wanted Malfoy. He hadn’t failed for want of trying; Harry, he had to credit himself, knew how to pull. Malfoy was an enigma.
“What kind of important shit?” Harry said with a grin.
“Noted,” Harry said wryly.
Harry decided fleeing was the best possible option post-impromptu performance. Plus, Frederick was in a snit. He'd already gone out to wait by the car, leaving Harry to get their coats from the surly girl at the coat check.
“Not exactly what I
Harry glared at her for a fraction of a second before standing up, placing his coffee gingerly on the table, and pacing over to the desk where a card from a Godchild sat, a picture of a house and three smiling faces in scribbled crayon.
But Harry stood up, backed out of the room as he slowly lost the ability to breath. He ran up the stairs to the bathroom, vomited, and collapsed on the floor, shaking and hyperventilating as the familiar panic set it. How could this happen? How could people just get away with evil? He dragged at his shirt, freeing his neck from the strangling weight of his collar as Draco appeared at the door, desperately unlocking it with an outstretched wand and rushing to Harry’s side.
Abe sighed and dug into his pocket. “Wait, here. Take this. And don’t even think about arguing with me on that. You don’t have much time. Pansy is right about one thing; Draco
Jordan nodded and hurried off. Harry was satisfied. If it had been a real emergency, he reasoned, she’d have come herself or sent an adult who could cover his class.

Potter, wisely, eyed him with immense suspicion for a moment before he spoke. “I’m building this desk.”

“I have the baby,” Ron repeated miserably.
It was fair to categorize the event as

“Oh, don’t worry. I’ll get to her,” Harry insisted, crossing his arms and looking back to Draco. “So, explain to me how I brought you back to life.”
on his Muggle bank account.
“Well, look at that. Seems you have far better luck with baby hippogriff than you do adults, apparently,” Harry laughed. “Think we still get to go?”
"Lots of things
“What are you two doing?”
"This. Between us. Are we going to be together again?"
Draco closed his eyes, feeling a tear he had been trying to corral sneak past his defences. He may not have been surprised, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t sad. He took a deep breath before he whispered, "You won't like what you'll find. You'll be done anyway."
Harry grinned, coy and abashed. “He’s not here. You can be the first to know that I am here stag. Use the information wisely, and you could net yourself a tidy profit from the press.”
“I’m not quite getting how we ended up
Clasped against Harry Potter's forearm, however, his Apparating darkness was filled with some sort of - well, not light, not exactly. But certainly, it was filled with a
In a way, Gerard was what he needed, too, except that the level of need had quickly run through its usefulness. And now, Draco was apparently stuck with him for years.
“Morning, André,” he called to his coworker, who was perched at the top of the ladder, rearranging a high display of sweaters.
“You alright?”
It was ludicrous.
“Huh?”
“Seriously?”
“Sorry,” he muttered. “That was uncalled for. It’s just… Potter. This is what he does to my life. I feel like an idiot child.”
Draco was restless. He knew why he was restless, but the knowing wasn’t solving the problem. He’d already been banished from the kitchen by a frazzled Astoria, asked politely to leave the library by a silent, reading Scorpius, and had been bitten by the Crup for too much pacing while she was trying to nap. Finally, he’d settled in the slightly-too-cold solarium, staring out the window at the snow and unable to sit down or even finish a cup of tea.
Draco looked at him with so much fury that Harry was tempted to pick up his wand. It

explicit text to Amanda on his break.
Draco rolled his eyes at the ceiling but schooled his emotions as he calmly replied, “Well, I have confirmed new ownership of the shop, and as head of the board, you receive notification
Back in London, however, the veneer lost its shine and started to crack so quickly that Harry couldn’t pick up the pieces. It was like Spain had accelerated his descent. Like the sun and the contentment had washed away his ability to hide. Harry knew how much happier he could be, and now, he was unable to convince himself to pretend.
Harry conceded and followed Draco through the crowded hall, close enough that Draco could
“No, you don’t.”
He reached out and took Draco by the hand, pulling him forward until the door fell from his grasp and rested gently on Draco’s back instead. He waited for Draco to flee, to stop him. But he didn’t, so Harry kept pulling and Draco stopped resisting. When he finally had their bodies flush, trapping Draco’s hand between them, he smiled.
The forest burst into daylight. The force of the spell knocked Harry into his seat. The warmth suffused through him and his mind went blissfully blank; happiness radiated through him. He looked around, searching for it in the light trails. It
So, he decided not to follow ‘
me by telling me what the new bloke looks like.”
"Oh God," Draco groaned. "I have to call Pansy. She's going to gloat."
Harry shivered, turning his head.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked, not sure if his tone was aiming for concern or mocking and therefore falling flat.
“Jordan?”
“No worries,” Harry agreed easily. It was not uncommon for him to be shunted out of the bed for any number of Weasley relatives. There were all kinds of promises about ‘when they moved into the house’ and him having his own room, but the sofa bed wasn’t so bad and it honestly didn’t bother him. “Who is it?” he asked.
He was confused and tired and frankly, extremely pissed off. There wasn’t much point to any of these emotions, though, so he shrugged them off and threw them to the back of his mind. The one thing he couldn’t seem to rid himself of, however, was the lingering feeling that he was
“No, course not.”
he’d said to Neville on that high street, the sinful drip to his voice only partly voluntary.
The back room was a cramped space, full of colourful boxes and small whirling objects that flew over their heads. A desk was shoved in the corner, piled high with files and papers, more boxes perched precariously near the edge. Potter had hobbled over to the desk and sat down by the time he noticed Draco was also there.
"What, because we don't go out as often?” Harry shouted. “Is that the issue? You don't get to be
Or is it the blame you've hoodwinked?
“Knock, knock?” a tentative voice said from the door. Harry was standing in the door frame, damp from the outside and still wearing his coat.
How small the word seems now.
The one who proposed? You two gonna finally tie it up? He made you so happy."
On weekends, he went and saw properties. He hired a letting agent, a Muggle one who was endlessly confused by his non-specific purpose.
“Mhmm,” Diego grinned. “Have I ever mentioned that it is a very good thing that you are never expected to go to the book release events for the stuff you draw? Actually, it is a very good thing that you are
Upon arrival, he made a hasty decision and grabbed a room at the Leaky instead of continuing on to Ron and Hermione’s. Something felt fragile and desperate about the fact that he was in London at all. He wasn’t keen to bring them into it quite yet; they’d be comforting and understanding. It was possible they’d even be encouraging, but he couldn’t risk the alternative coming true. Not when he was just starting to let the fact that he still loved Draco wiggle it’s way back into his consciousness.
“Theo!” he called into the empty black of the dark storeroom his key opened. “THEODORE-O!”
“You bloody well are, idiot,” Harry returned. Ron nodded once as he sat back down.
“Well, it was either marry Marco or listen to him
“First time you enter, you’ll be able to set your password. I’ll leave you to it, but I’m just down there if you need anything before lunch.” Flitwick winked at Harry as he added, “I recommend a quick nip of port to get through the tedium of the evening meetings.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Harry replied airily, closing his eyes at the force of his blush.
The implications of that last one were making his heart race and sputter. He’d honestly not been aware of it until this very moment, which was ridiculous as he categorised all the things he’d been both noticing and annoyed by over the past to days.
Gloria waved him off. “Sure, sure. But they’re one of those mega-corp whatever they are. With all the money. They’re always at least a little bit corrupt.”
Draco looked up and was instantly met by bright green eyes and a shocked expression. “Harry,” Draco breathed.
“Honestly?” he asked softly. "Ginny, I think I need to go back to the hospital.”
Carl had happened two weeks before the wedding. Two weeks. Had he managed to avoid the situation for two weeks, they may have all been fine. He would be married to Harry right now, curled into this bed with him before his best friends’ Christmas celebration, working at the store at ungodly hours but heading home to Scotland to live in Harry’s quarters with him. Hell, maybe he’d even have gone crazy and quit the store job before this holiday season.
“I have three questions for you.”
. For some reason, he cared about the difference. Draco cared.
“So stop drinking it,” he growled.
“Oh, oh my God!” Harry shouted as he rose from a deep, mirrored bow. “Draco, come see! Come on!”
“Well,” Harry declared, dropping his wand and dispelling the buck. “The first thing you’re going to have to do is lighten the fuck up. This isn’t a...condemnation on your character or something. The Patronus is one of the most difficult—”
“See,” he began. “The simple answer is ‘Ginny told me to come’.”
He shrugged, returned his hands to his pockets, and walked past Draco to order coffee. When he had stopped speaking to the witch at the cart, he turned back around and slowly approached.
“I need you to be there, solving cases and kicking people in the behind to get things done. You know what I’m like. Flying in with no plan. I’m likely going to die by next week.”
my backups."
Harry cast a charm quickly, wandless magic coming easy to him in the midst of this much emotion. He pulled Draco's trousers and pants down completely, and wasted no time finding his own pleasure, unable to draw out the experience, lasting only a few moments before gasping and drawing down on Draco hard enough to make him gasp as well.
“Then why did you say yes?”
She laughed and released him. “Well, I
“Pansy bought it for me because I loved hers so much,” Draco replied lovingly. “I was worried I wasn’t going to be able to figure it out. Filius did have to help me with the electric thingy, but other than that it's actually pretty easy.”
Harry didn't shift when Draco woke up, didn't seem to care that he was going to leave him behind. They'd fallen asleep in the bed, fully clothed, just talking. Not about anything in particular. Nothing important. But while Ron and Hermione had gone to put Rose to bed, the two of them had wandered away and ended up lying down, a foot apart. Sleep, when it came, was surprising. Draco hadn't slept well in months, so waking up now, rested and alert, felt like a new start. One of many.
“So wait,” Harry insisted, sounding awed. “You...you too?”
“I got you a cookie. Best bakery in town,” she said, handing him a paper bag that he took mechanically. “Snowman, for the child-man I know and love.”
“Nothing,” Draco said lightly. “Just a weird thing we used to say at school. Harry reminded me of it. It’s stupid. Look, things between him and I were….complicated. And–”
“For now,” Draco muttered painfully, Pulling back and resting his forehead against Harry’s. “This is a game to you. We just… wanted to see how far we could push each other, and you’re winning. That’s always been the way.”

He had forgotten how much time he was going to have with his own thoughts.
sure how, but he knew he had. He’d stay here until someone dragged him out. There was nothing left outside these walls, so it seemed fitting to remain trapped by them.
When he finally admitted to her that he'd been with Harry that morning, over a stolen cigarette that he wouldn't have to lie to anyone about, she had been perfectly Amanda about it.
Ron Weasley, on the other hand, seemed to have decided this was unacceptable. At approximately nine that very morning, the fireplace in the corner of Harry Potter’s large bedroom flared with green light and a large, red-headed man stepped into the room in full Auror regalia.
He took another sip instead.
Harry, inexplicably, blushed and tightened his housecoat, before turning away and tossing a large stack of papers into an old leather bag. Without complaint, he followed Draco down to the end of the third floor corridor, through the hidden door in the tapestry, down the spiral tunnel, and out into the darker, cooler passage that led to his office.
Night after night, the tiny slips of parchment would show up on Draco’s porch. There was never a proper piece; bits of torn newspaper or flyers for broom oil. Either Draco didn’t warrant proper stationery, or else Harry was fixated on replying as quickly as possible.
“Nope,” Draco shrugged.
“I’d like to know why I wasn’t informed that he was going to be here this year!”
“Where is everyone?” Draco asked calmly.
“Doing what?” Theo said innocently. She slammed the cupboard he’d just put mugs into and glared at him.
Harry chuckled.
“What you did being ‘having me fired by lying about my character’?” Malfoy returned. “Just so we’re clear.”
“Harry!” Neville yelped in surprise. He sighed, next, though, and Harry laughed, already anticipating what was happening.
“Yeah,” Dean replied, eyeing Harry carefully. “We remember him.”
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was very far north, nestled in the foothills of Scotland, utterly unreachable to Muggles. It was difficult to get into without being invited, and truthfully, it didn’t get many unexpected visitors regardless. The castle was hidden from prying eyes, secure for its students, full of magical lessons, community, adventure, and happiness.
of that before it made his life more difficult. Instead, he’d been rash and childish, literally running away.
The sat and stared at each other across the table. Neither moved a muscle, neither dared enter the space between them, the years of unspoken history, the attraction they’d ignored, and then dealt with, and then ignored again. Finally, Barkley—likely confused by the silence and the disappearance of his scratches—sat up with his paws on the table and gave a loud and irritated bark. Both Harry and Draco looked at him in surprise. And then, both laughed.
“This is my father’s gala,” Draco replied. His tone was light but there was a flash of darkness in his expression that Harry stored away for further investigation. He didn’t push for more information. It made sense that Draco Malfoy’s father was involved in an organisation as huge as Borgin and Burke. It wasn’t exactly a secret that they were very, very rich.
“What? Draco, who is it? Do you know
He left the house with 4500 pounds in Muggle coin, no wand, and absolutely no idea how to live in their world.
But the words disappeared somewhere between his brain and his mouth and he hated it, because, in that instant, he
“You obviously like him. He obviously likes you. You’d actually be pretty good together, I think,” Diego said, gripping him on the shoulder gently. “Go back in there and ask him. Like, right now. Before you have too much time to think about it. We both know that would be terrible.”
Harry studied her for a minute. He was going to have to admit it, but he wasn't really sure what to say.
“Why on earth are you out here? Britain has remembered to be in Britain. Had you not noticed?”
“I can tell,” she said sympathetically. “In all fairness, I think he may have just hit his limit for how shitty he can feel. He doesn’t have any sense of self-preservation anymore. He just seems to decide he deserves whatever comes his way and deals with it. He never…Carl wasn’t really anything.”
sitting around and talking to him all day, the more certain he became that he needed more from Potter. He just had absolutely no idea what he was supposed to do about it.
"Banned. Subject," Draco interjected with a very pointed glare up at her. She held up her hands in surrender.
As the door closed behind him, Neville found himself bracing with weak knees against the crates behind him, unsure of what had just happened.
love us.”
Yes, September had been a hard month.
; we should go out. What are you up tonight?"
“You won’t have your wand for another
At first, he was exhausted every time she left him alone again. The emotional pain would throw itself back on him as soon as he Apparated home. Since he'd been robbed of his wallowing time and his despondency for the day, he would take it late into the evening before passing out wherever he was from pure exhaustion.
“You know as well as I do that this isn’t about the
? We’ve heard about him,” Pansy leaned on the counter, chin in her hand, breasts out. “Pretty. Not your type,” she said, blinking her lashes at him.
The buck leapt joyfully from the end of his wand and galloped around them once before rearing onto its back legs in triumph, then waiting patiently for its instructions. Draco watched the movement of the slightly glowing spectre with annoyance. Harry was glad for the sun. It was less impressive in the daylight than it was at night.
“I know,” Draco whined. “I’m so sorry. I just...I had to know.”
Draco hesitated, returning Harry’s glare until Harry sighed.
“Excuse me, Auror Lambert?” Harry called out, as calmly as he could as he entered his supervisor’s office.
’ meant Madam Malkin’s?
“What do you want, Pans?”
An eerie sort of silence fell around them as they marched up. When they entered the dusty apartment, Potter dropped his ridiculously worn out and too-small duffle bag to the ground right in the entryway and then crossed his arms and looked around, routed to the spot.
“You were sent a list of professors at the school. I don’t see how you failed to see
“Patience,” he murmured to himself. “She gave you a chance when no one else would.”
“You aren’t sleeping, either, are you?” Draco asked the darkness.
“That, and someone who knows you once fought in a war,” Harry interjected, looking instantly embarrassed.
With Harry Potter! In his little Muggle hidey-hole! Don’t you want an autograph?” Pansy simpered, stepping forward as Harry simultaneously moved toward her.
Harry grimaced and looked at the front door.
“Uh,” Ron started, picking up the paper and rifling through. “Oh. This one? Okay…”
He sounded so sad that Harry’s shoulders snuck up to his shoulders as he hugged his knees to his chest in the effort to not stand up and comfort him.
He curses and cleans and eats too much cheese on Wednesday. It's a strange response, he agrees. But the book is clutched in his hand all morning Thursday as he gets ready to go back to the field. He doesn't have a plan. Shoves it in his bag as he takes up his broomstick, and quite honestly forgets all about it as they fly. The only thing stopping him from ramming Potter off his broom when he appears, twenty minutes late and pinch-faced, is that he is on thin ice with the league as it is.
The complicated parts would fall apart in the middle of the entryway, when Draco’s back slammed up against the ancient wallpaper because Harry’s hands were behind his head, cradling a precious neck and crowding into the space that still remained.
late, but André always made the mistake of arriving at the same time as Erica. Draco actually suspected that he had a bit of a crush on their crotchety manager, which was fair, he supposed; from a strictly aesthetic point of view, Erica was probably pretty. It was hard to make a fair judgement, despite the fact that she was probably only about thirty. The years of retail and fighting with management who never bothered to check on the actual stores they owned had made her resentful, and she wore the bitterness like armour. He’d seen her drunk, once, at a May Day party the store had thrown. Since then, Draco had found charity for the woman in places he didn’t expect it.
“Hermione, I’m not. He’s been...there’s been so much doubt in his decision this year, and he just...I think, frankly, that we were always headed here. Isn’t it better that it’s happening
Harry truly wasn’t sure, since Crookshanks had almost ruined cats in general for him, let alone kneazles, but Neville insisted that the magical breed was far more docile when mixed, and far more intelligent than the average cat. Holding the tiny bundle now, who snuggled down beneath his cupped hands and almost immediately fell asleep with her pointy ears flicking gently, he had to admit he could try and let him be right.
Harry stared at the parchment for many minutes, half waiting for it to explode into flames.
“Whatever. Sit and listen. I’m going to tell you a very ridiculous story.”
Draco looked at Harry expecting to find him joking. Instead, he found a vulnerability that broke his heart. “Silly man,” Draco said, putting aside his own dinner and shuffling down under the covers until he was face to face with Harry. “I just wanted to say. I won’t do casual. I’m terribly jealous and kind of an asshole, and I’m far too old to not just admit that. So I don’t know what you want from me now that I’ve finally done you’re little ‘push you up against a wall’ thing, but…anyway.”
"Intentionally? And skin to skin? It might be. Harry, look, please just…shut the fuck up for a second, okay. I'm thinking."
"No, I know, I'm sorry. I just…"
The door at the end of the hall was propped open and the loud crashing and cursing were much more evident as a result.
“Harry,” she sighed. “Harry, Harry, Harry. Neville, even if he is questioning his sexuality or his marriage or whatever, is
When the five o'clock bells rang, he made up his mind. He'd organised his dresser, moved the kitchen around so he could actually cook, changed the order of the living room so that they had space to write independently, and had cleaned the bathroom. He was bored and he was hungry. Either Potter woke up, or Draco was going to eat without him.
He couldn’t look at the man across from him as his cheeks flamed with shame, the type of shame that he hadn’t felt since he was eighteen. He waited for the backlash, a pause that was becoming annoyingly familiar.
“Yeah,” Neville said a moment later, his eyes closing tightly. “Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.”
Grinning to himself, he threw off his shoes and leapt into the last remaining chair in the room, ducking as Seamus threw a plastic fork on his head, and pushed the remaining box of fish at him with his foot across the table.
“Draco,” Pansy’s voice whined at him. “How dare you send me on a wild goose chase to find your former obsessive crush and then not even answer my call. So bloody inconsiderate. Anyway, I, er, ran into that Granger girl at her office. Shut up. I didn’t go there on purpose, I had called Luna first. It’s just that….wait, no, never mind. You don’t get to know why. She wouldn’t give me his number, but she did inform me — after some convincing, mind, you owe me big time — that he walks that park every day on his way home from the school where he teaches. Around four.  If you make me regret this or become the lovesick fuck-wad you were in school, I swear to god I will just knock you out and move you to the coast to detox. Don’t call me again tonight. I have..erm, plans.”
“Mr Potter,” she intoned, looking up at him finally. “I have been at Hogwarts for a very long time. I was your
For a minute, Draco just stared down at the white, milky substance that had been placed before him. He watched it cautiously, as though at any second, it might rear up and kill him. He sniffed it. He held it up to his face. Then, carefully, he took another sip. There was way too much sweetness initially, but underneath, there was a complex, wintery spice that warmed the pit of his stomach comfortably. And it was sort of, kind of, hesitantly,
He placed the ring on his own finger before Harry got the chance, and the December 14th moving day would become the laughing stock of all their friends, full of accusations about planned proposals and cheesy photos. None of it was true, of course, but the date would linger as they planned a wedding and as they planned a life. It became an anniversary that they had never once had before.
Draco took a deep breath and tried to pull back a mantle of professionalism. “Look, Potter. I know we do not get along. I am not asking to be your mate. I just need a comment from you about the… incident. Then I’ll leave.”
More interesting by far, though, was how attentively Malfoy listened to Harry as he returned his stories of the past six years. As he described his travel and the training, and his final end in the career he'd always wanted, Malfoy watched him calmly, taking everything in, no judgement in his delicate features.
In less than 24 hours, Draco Malfoy, who he’d sort of fancied since the first year of training, was going to see him in fishnets, a garter, and his handmade, brocade-and-silk scarlet finery. The corset was his pride and joy.
! And Potter waltzes in, using his name and his clout, and suddenly, I’m under
Harry laughed. "Well, we definitely need to go find out?"
When he looked back down, Draco was beaming. “Pretty good, eh?” he stated, his tone quiet and proud, unlike Harry had ever heard it.
The first person he ran into in the street looked at him like he was insane when he asked about this Digone Alley place he needed to find, and hurried off with his shopping with nothing more than a few fervent glances backwards.
“Pansy,” he whimpered, ignoring her. “What have I done? I don’t want to ‘run the household’, and I just gave up the only job I was at all qualified for.”
pretty smart,” Harry replied nonchalantly. Draco ignored him and put the next mug beneath the coffee maker’s nozzle.
The Ministry never suspected a possible union between a Death Eater and The Chosen One, not even when they were married three years later; despite the presence of many Aurors, Curse-Breakers, and even elected officials at their small and intimate ceremony in the Highlands. No one asked any questions when their marriage certificate mysteriously managed to be processed without it ever leaking beyond the offices of the Magical Registrar.
"You already know the answer to that."
“Yes. Mr Wood’s doing, a few years ago when he was the interim coach.”
"Merlin," Ron complained. "This feels familiar. Are we sure Draco needs to be forgiven?"
we both know I’m going to die first. Your Gryffindor lack of care is going to
For months, he’d been scrambling to work out what had changed, why he suddenly felt so uncomfortable with Diego. Right here, on a November afternoon, Harry stared at him, hard lines in his face, defiance in his expression, and explained absolutely everything without saying even one word.
Ron stood up from where he had been leaning on Draco’s replacement desk and proceeded to explain the situation. As he spoke, Harry became more and more incredulous, and Draco had to fight the urge to laugh.
“Sorry,” he murmured absentmindedly, skirting the edge and moving to continue.
Draco nods. He can understand that.
Harry was pretty sure he blushed, though he couldn’t exactly say why. He shrugged in response and gestured for Malfoy to try casting. Draco shrugged back and turned to his practice space. As was the norm at this point, he closed his eyes and stretched out his wand. He reached forward, muttered the spell and opened one eye, like a cartoon character looking over the edge of the cliff.
“Non-optional if you want to keep your frontline position,” he declared unapologetically, wiggling the paper until Harry took it. “And Potter?”
He’s in Draco’s note. Just...let’s get this over with. Where. Is. Your. Wand,” he repeated through gritted teeth.
“No it’s fucking not,” Abe laughed. “He’s a louse who hangs about playing a guitar he never buys.”
"I know we all thought it was a little concerning," Ginny replied softly from across the table. She took his hand gently, snapping his eyes back to hers. "How close you were, so quickly."
to you. You were a dick, but I did talk to you.”
At least, that had always been Draco's experience up until now.
Owen stumbled out into the street in the frenzied chaos of whatever had happened in the hotel. Clearly the blast had been loud enough to alert others, but he managed to slip past them as they scrambled up the stairs.
“That’s going to be a problem, Mr Malfoy,” Molly returned, a bite to her tone that made him wince.
“This is the third night we’ve been here! I AM ANCIENT! Can we please leave!?”
“Mooncalves,” Draco repeated, looking down at his blank page. “Mooncalves might work.”
Fine. Serves you right, now that I’m here and see you aren’t even in yet. You hungover again?
“Okay,” he restarted, “you know that feeling that you just… want to be near someone. Because you like them in an indefinable way? It’s like… a calm. That is also a spine-tingling, stomach-to-your-ankles sort of thing? That feeling that you have to turn and look at one more time before you walk away, even at the risk of being caught?” Lou just looked at him. “Yeah. You don't have to answer. I know you aren't going to. It doesn't matter. I can tell you know what I mean. It's been ages since I felt that. Maybe even since…”
Harry laughed, for what felt like the first time in ages, and replied, “You're on."
Regardless, by the end of the day, he had a new assignment. He had also inherited a new partner — a young recruit whose voice reminded him unpleasantly of Winky's, but who was otherwise tolerable — and a rotation of surveillance in Hogsmeade. He hadn't lied to Kingsley, not really. He
“The tunnels. You know about the tunnels?”
A story: I was going to post two chapters today because I missed yesterday, but instead, I'm combining them. It makes more sense. Is this breaking advent rules? Yes. Yes it is. I'm super sorry. If that's hard for you, here's a chapter for December 11th: After Pansy left, Harry spent the whole day packing. He listened to too much sad Christmas music, decided to go to bed early, and woke up far too early for the train he was planning on taking.
“Alright, out with it. Are we fighting? Because of the Neville thing?”
“So then, what do you propose?”
“Well, you never get shopping done, and he kind of figured this year may be a bit harder, what with the whole—”
I’ll stop by and make sure Marco doesn’t burn the place down.”
“You have the hair.”
“Well then, that’s that. Harry has spoken, and we will continue forward. You have, I’m afraid, lost my trust. It’s not impossible to earn it back, but—”
“He’s going to meet us at the park. Something about the fresh air,” she waved, slipping her feet into boots that had appeared from out of nowhere. Harry nodded and followed her out the door again.
“Yeah, alright,” he sighed. “You… do I need to bring anything?”
“I don’t even
Remember crowds? Me either.
“My therapist,” Harry explained, with just a hint of challenge in his tone. He clearly still anticipated mocking from Draco; he wanted to take away all the memories that made that true. For a moment, he was so focused on the sadness that Harry’s tone instilled in him that he didn’t hear his words. When they filtered through, Draco froze.
Pansy glared and ignored him.
"We're moving,” Theo announced as Draco let the paper fall to the ground.
“Being left at the altar thing?” Harry teased, feeling just a hint of guilt at Bill’s pained expression. “I promise, it’s fine. That’s kind of him, though. I think I will go see him, actually. I could use some more exploding snap sets for school.”
“Don’t you
Harry laughed, snuggling closer to Draco and drawing him under an arm. “I can. This flat is cursed.”
When he returned to the school to take up his temporary post of Alchemy Professor, Draco was warned by every member of the junior staff to never, ever bring up the story.
“Um, Ron?” Harry wheezed.
Normally — any other day, in fact — the retort that Draco felt would have come easily. He could have started a battle that he definitely would have won. But he surveyed the room with a surreptitious glance and found it in utter disarray; multiple pieces of wood were strewn all over the floor, there were tools scattered everywhere. Potter, for his part, looked a little bit…unhinged.
“You don’t understand,” Theo said miserably. She shook her head at him in confusion. “Pansy, I’ll have to live there. In Wycombe. This back and forth won’t work when it’s more than two days a week.”
Harry shrugged apologetically. “Sorry, I guess I shouldn’t have woken you up. Or wait...is that sleepwalkers?”
Oscar cleared his throat and said, “They were full of silly activities. Nothing too flashy, not super expensive, but always so much fun. We have space for that here. Could be like a funfair, with games and practice duelling for those of age. Snacks, of course. And you could have rides outside—course, we'll have to put a shield up in the area or whatever, but if you're selling tickets, there'll only be so many people right?”
Harry stared at him for what felt like an eternity. “I mean. You’d have to…”
He stared at the framed photograph on the wall, one he’d taken himself of the
“Don’t know that we needed
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” Harry exploded. “I don’t owe you anything.”
Which was ridiculous, obviously. They were coworkers, not best mates. He didn’t owe Potter news.
"Oh my God, I
“He's an ass. And you know it. Take Draco out.”
No one said a word, looking at each other in such palpable discomfort that Draco had the inappropriate urge to laugh. Harry, beside him, smiled awkwardly and gave a small wave.
“Thanks, Potter. Very avant-garde. Ground-breaking. I’ll just have to go...what? Be
prejudiced towards
“Lily, why don’t you go get Draco’s present while he and Daddy have a quick look at your snowman outside.”
“Oi, Harry, look!” he shouted. “Your weird, nonsensical solution helped! Sometimes, I swear you two are speaking in code. I mean, I suppose we had strange, school-specific shorthand too, but…”
“Mine too,” Draco whispered, running a thumb across his cheek and grinning. “They should know better by now than to doubt
"I'm my experience, that may be uni in general. Do you ever wonder how the Muggles do it? Drink the way they do without potions?"
“Wait, are you serious?” Potter laughed. “You know how to build flatpack furniture. You. Draco flipping Malfoy.”
with Malfoy, he pulled back so far that it felt like a slap in the face. Harry just didn’t get it. He was trying. Trying to redeem Malfoy in his mind. Trying to forgive him. Trying to let him be this new person that Harry didn’t actually hate being around, who was acerbic and possibly even witty when he wasn’t spending every minute of the day a brooding, moody lump.
, and Ron had made his signature lasagna and homemade garlic bread. A relaxed evening with the air of celebration, wine flowing, and joviality all around. They sat around after dinner trading stories, and Draco was definitely on point, relaxed and sophisticated his complicated trousers and Harry's favourite soft blue jumper, a glass twirling gently in his hands as he told the story of his first case to Neville. Harry was completely enamoured. He could do nothing but stare in awe at how Draco held a room.
“Unfortunately,” Ron nodded. “Yes.”
“So, not my fault at all, then?” Pansy laughed. “Wait, are you ever so subtly asking if I told him about Astoria? Because yes. Yes, I did.”
“Okay, so we’re doing this?” Draco interjected gruffly. “Do you really want to go there? Really? Want to discuss how much your friends fought against you and I doing anything more than that kiss? How much they hated me in school? Pansy and…and Theo.”
and exploding snap in the break room."
Draco smiled a wry smile, more to himself than her, as he muttered, “Cinnamon latte, please.”
Against his will, the corners of Harry’s mouth turned up, and Hermione — who never missed anything, ever — hit him across the head with the tea cosy.
“I’m going to keep that desk. It’s...custom.”
"It’s not a problem,” the man replied, standing up and holding up the leash. “We had a lovely chat. He’s very friendly.”
Six foot, built, and with that nearly-too-long dirty blond hair. Draco knew intellectually that the man was gorgeous, simply from having spent two years existing in the world with him; it was hard to ignore the fact that everyone checked out your boyfriend, especially when he was in one of his ‘
“Malfoy!” Harry repeated.
“Because, you utter moron, I love you.” Harry tucked his arms around Draco’s waist and pulled him close, a hug that was meant to be safety, and dragged him off the wall to move him even closer. “At some point, I am determined that you will stop making it more complicated than that.”
“Spells a wizard can manage. I told you, Potter, I’ve heard it all before. Save it.”
Tonight, there was tension in his shoulders. What the fuck he had been thinking by inviting Draco Malfoy, king of proper and buttoned-up wit, he would never know. He held his breath through the Virgin announcement, waiting for Draco to storm out. A part of his brain did realise that as Draco was standing beside him nearly naked, there was likely more to him than he currently knew.
He instinctively ducked, just as a
“I’m afraid that will be utterly impossible,” the goblin replied with a malicious grin. “Every advisor has been booked for
“What?” Draco said sitting up.
But Draco knows only the important part is the disastrous reality that if Harry Potter is capable of being attracted to men, as this first authorised biography would suggest, then Draco is even more pathetic than he was before. Because if there is a possibility of Draco's exhausting little crush being reciprocated, then the fact that they have been fighting even more than normal, and not just on the pitch, just becomes hopelessly depressing.
“Neat. Cool,” Draco hissed. “So this is your inspirational speech?”
If he had been less rash, less proud, he may have been able to avoid this; he wouldn’t have been here so long. Time may not have been passing in the usual fashion, but Draco
“Yup,” Harry replied, unapologetically. “If we speak, we sleep together. It’s...so complicated, I don’t even...look, I meant to tell you, okay? In my defence, I seriously meant to tell you before you started at the school. But we were so happy, and you’re so...you. I just didn’t get around to it.”
“Yes, well, there is a reason I am an anonymous illustrator,” he said, muffled because his face was back on his sketchbook.
Draco was spinning in a large arc. He looked ridiculous like he was scared of his own wand.
“Okay. Love you.”
“What’s so funny?” Malfoy said from where he was tending the fire. His tone was intentionally cautious, innocent to the point of study, and it sent a comforting quirk of irritation through Harry that was almost welcome. They were back on familiar ground.
The moment he hit the street, though, it was hard to hold onto his resolute annoyance. Paris was just so...
“Fine,” Harry huffed. “Where is your wand?”
Harry looked down at his empty cup. She was right, of course, but it didn't really make much of a difference, not now.
Draco shook his head, amused, but equally confused at the slight blush on Potter's face.
“Pansy?” Draco said, dragging out a rusty, but serviceable, Pureblood voice of indifference.
Harry beamed at him, a wry twist to his mouth that made Draco smirk in question. “It’s just surreal, don’t you think? You told me, and I was instantly
Draco fought for the three days before Christmas to relax all on his own, to not need the emergency appointment he’d made with at Dr Stenhouse just in case. But, by the twenty-third, the reality was that he wasn’t sleeping. His friends all knew Christmas was usually bad for him and they were giving him lots of space; this year, leaving the castle took on some added weight that he could not yet name.
“You could—” Harry began, shaking his head as he realised what he’d been about to stay. “Never mind.”
“Look, I know how I sound, okay? Why do you think I haven’t talked to you until now. I’m...embarrassed isn’t even the beginning of what I feel. But more importantly, I am furious. My fucking father, from beyond the fucking
“Just,” Neville whispered. “Harry, I mean this in the nicest way possible, but please, just... get away from me, I need a break for all this, I just... please leave.”
“So let me get this straight,” Draco said, retrieving his keys and locking the door behind him. He waited for the lift while leaning on the wall, hating the wall sconces as usual, angry at the blandness of the carpet beneath his feet.
Potter has been reclusive since the moment he joined the team. He doesn't travel to away games with them, doesn't stay in the same hotels, doesn't come to team meals. Draco thought he understood why; after all, it took him a year to be dragged away from his own ghosts and made to be human again. A year of badgering and pestering from the captains that if he wanted to be on the team, he had to learn to trust them.
“I know, I just…owed you a coffee.”
“You seem happier this morning,” Draco noted.”
By the time he reached the outside of the shop, Harry was barely breathing, the hyperventilating feeling familiar and unsurprising. He was stuck, like the murky water at the bottom of a rain barrel. He wanted to run, to fly, escape. He didn’t want to face Ginny — or even more horrifying, Draco — and yet his body was unable to move. He clawed at the collar of his coat, dragging it away from his body until his neck was bare. He ripped his hands through his hair, trying to slow his breathing. Suddenly, Ginny was in front of him, directing him to sit on a bench, crouching at his feet, muttering soothing sounds until his gasps subsided a bit and he could actually see her, hear her words.
It was a Saturday—for the record if for no other reason. It hardly mattered to him what day it was. He had no alarms, nowhere to be, no reason to be awake at seven seventeen. He still wasn’t back to work, technically because he wasn’t due back at the school for two more weeks. Less technically, it was because he wasn’t going back.
In which Draco learns that Harry died. Not, 'was gravely injured or lost consciousness' or 'medically had no heart beat'. But actually fucking
“You know when he said you were good, I don't think I ever quite believed him. He tends to fuss over pretty things. But you
Harry rubbed his eyes, pushing his glasses onto the top of his head and exhaling. Draco—new Draco, adult Draco—had always been very paranoid about keeping money out of their lives. Even as their relationship had grown more intense, more solid, he’d never let anything go out of balance; he insisted on paying his own way, always split everything. He was frugal to a point of it annoying Harry, who’d always just assumed he was reading into things because of his own upbringing.
In the end, it was Diego who solved everything, which should have surprised him less than it did.
Draco now
"I know, but honestly. It's been nearly a decade. Surely the Aurors can see that we aren't a threat. For Merlin's fucking sake, he's been living without magic for three years!"
“I would much rather have had a less interesting one,” Malfoy replied darkly. “I never seem to be able to stop working, a sensation you might be familiar with,” he added, setting up the pensieve next to the bed. “Alright, Potter, since I’m on babysitting duty again today we may as well put you to work,” he decreed.
“Perfection doesn’t need fixing” Malfoy mentioned absently, already more absorbed by his chart than their conversation. Why wouldn’t he pay attention to him? Had he really become so stale through the years? Why couldn’t he get a rise out of him anymore?
"Trevor is in Hawaii, dealing with the fallout of a dragon-induced volcanic explosion, I'm going to catch up with him there, and then wherever the next disaster strikes. You know how I operate these days."
What do we think of the nice little Astoria cameo? and tiny Teddy?
"Just water," Harry replied, pulling a canteen from the pack and handing it over.
“Good morning Healer Malfoy. Your favourite patient is awake and fed, the new painkillers seem to agree with him.” She mentioned, giving him the efficiency he’d come to expect and welcome from her.
"Yes, Healer Malfoy." The answer came strangled.
"We still have time and it can wait," Draco assured.
“I have a battery of unusual tests to run on a patient, you’ll be doing most of them, it will be good practice for procedures you might otherwise have to perform in emergency situations.” He explained as they went to the lab to get all the instruments they needed.
Draco shook his head. "I should be thanking you, Granger, for bringing me along. Trust me when I say I got more than I gave."
“You can’t hurt me with anything you find in there, Potter,” he replied softly, like there was something Harry couldn’t possibly understand. “I know who I am and I’m not hiding, not from you, not from anyone else.” He gave him a smile so kind, Harry felt crushed under it.
Draco hummed softly, his hand finding its way into Harry’s hair again, holding him there, slowly combing through them. The ring on his finger glinted in the low light of the room, a solitary star in a sea of black, single witness to the inenarrable: Harry Potter kneeling and seeking comfort at the feet of a Death Eater.
“Thank you for letting us assist, Healer Malfoy.” Brown called, already halfway out the door.
It was oddly warm, and it took a moment for it to settle over Harry's body, dense and still, holding him up suspended in an earthy embrace.
“No,” Draco replied, feeling his cheeks heat up a little “I just… We’re thirty-two, nearly thirty-three, doesn’t boyfriend sound a little… young?”
Comment to shame Harry for the fact that he couldn't resist dragging Ron even while Draco was asking him out.
“As you know, I’m the hospital’s interim Chief Medical Officer while Healer Andrews gets investigated over his involvement in the crimes committed in his department,” she started, clasping her hands on the desk. “Even if it should result that he wasn’t directly involved in them, his gross lack of oversight destroyed his chances of ever leading a department again, especially not in this hospital.”
“That’s privileged information you’re not supposed to have,” Draco replied, distracting him with a kiss.
How many of you saw this coming? Be honest.
An internal investigation on his conduct was starting, nothing new.
Draco had to remind himself of almost ten long years of honoured career not to hit Potter in the head with his own chart.
Harry fumbled with his pockets, struggling to fish the coin out, then twisted it three times in his fingers.
“Can I help you?” Draco asked politely. The man jumped and turned around, looking at him like a deer caught in headlights.
Malfoy nodded and gestured for her to follow him through the camp. He moved with ease and confidence among the tents, the loose clothes moving with the desert wind.
I'm preemptively notching up the rating because my outline reads "boning" at some point but it's a long way away still.
"Sometimes a lady doesn't kiss at all." Draco shot back. Pansy didn't dignify that with an answer but teasing her about her very obvious, incredibly unsubtle crush on the opera singer distracted Draco enough to finish his toast and have another piece with his coffee while Pansy polished off her clafoutis, showering Soup with much deserved praise for his cooking.
"Everyone will love you at your birthday party," Rose assured, dipping the brush in the bottle and splotching a dollop of polish on Harry's thumb, dripping down on the glass of the tabletop.
“Still. It made my job easier.” Draco replied, shaking his hand and walking him out. In the morning he would start experimenting on Potter. If it wasn’t tragic and put his career on the line of complete annihilation it would be hilarious. A completely new case to study, it would be the opportunity of a lifetime for anyone whose name wasn’t Draco Malfoy.
“I’m going to become an Auror like my mum and my godfather.” He announced, puffing out his chest. Dana chuckled.
Harry had called him on the Floo the night before with some very interesting things to talk about. Apparently Blaise had come by to talk about entirely inappropriate topics. Draco felt a twist of jealousy, he wanted to be the one to push and prod and find out what made Harry tick.
“Auror Potter was unconscious and a next of kin wasn’t available to give consent in time. As head of the equipe working on him it was my call to make.” Draco replied without hesitation “As far as proper support goes, to my knowledge, there is no healer in Britain trained to perform such procedure since, as you pointed out, it’s not approved by the BOH.” Draco managed not to sound condescending by some miracle, but my Merlin he wanted to so badly.
"A winning decision, I'm sure. Looks like the British influence is still strong, judging by the unfortunate governmental choices," he muttered, glancing out the window to allow himself a moment of bitterness about the management of his country while he was growing up. He sighed and turned back to look at his companion.
He had another long day ahead of him. He just knew they would be under siege by reporters looking to get a piece of Potter and he would get caught into it too. He considered disillusioning himself to get in undisturbed, but he would still need so get past them which would be a hassle. It would give him a good excuse to be a dick to a reporter, he didn’t have many of those these days… Except he couldn’t afford any more bad press than he already got.
Harry moaned as he bit into the first, the soft creamy filling oozing and creating a symphony of pleasure in his mouth. He dragged Malfoy closer and held out the other half for him.
The press of Draco’s lips at the small of his back distracted Harry from the tingling of a deep Cleansing Spell, leaving him empty, fresh, and alight with the energy of Draco’s magic lingering in the air.
“Apparently in the last twelve months there were twenty-eight separate instances of you being exposed to potential magical degradation or contamination of some form.” Malfoy announced to the room, giving him specifically a stern look.
Harry slid his fingers into Malfoy's hair, feeling the soft short strands at the nape of his neck, like velvet under his hand. Malfoy's fingers were digging into his sides, holding him close as he sucked on Harry's bottom lip.
He grinned at the choked off groan that came from Harry when Draco licked the finger clean.
“No, he’s in recovery.” Draco shook his head. “That’s not the problem.”
“Will you keep your clothes on while you fuck me into next week?” He asked. Then he cracked one eye open. “Please?”
“The new painkillers agreeing with you?” She asked, placing a tray of food on the rolling table.
“Why?” Harry insisted. He was missing something, the panic he’d felt was too raw for it just be theoretical.
“I already started reading my divination book.” He told Harry after Andromeda served tea. She chuckled at the mention of it shaking her head, and Harry knew there was a story there.
“And I think I need boundaries. I can’t believe I’m saying it, but ever since I left Hogwarts rules have always been a bit of an option for me,” he ran a hand through his hair. “Not that it was much different while I was at Hogwarts. McGonagall put up a good effort to keep me in line, but Dumbledore...” He shook his head, chuckling at the distaste written all over Draco’s face. He still wasn’t over Harry’s early admission to the Quidditch team, or their first-year house cup, or the million small privileges Dumbledore allowed Harry. “Ever since the Battle of Hogwarts no one really pushed back or made me experience real consequences for my actions the way other people do. I didn’t ask for special treatment and I always said I didn’t want it, but the fact of the matter is that I received it anyway, and I didn’t exactly complain when it happened. It probably made my impulse control even worse.”
"Don't fall asleep, Malfoy."
Comment if you like perfect bookends and sappy wedding vows.
“Had enough, Potter?” Malfoy asked, a wide satisfied smile on his face as he reset the board.
When they gathered to share lunch, Draco was almost starting to think this might be an easy mission, a nice break from environmental disasters and collapsing buildings. He was fully committed to enjoying his fragrant fish curry and rice, wondering if he could maybe sneak some of those fried veggies that had been served to Potter and Healer Gupta. They smelled too delicious not to try and taste some, but in the end, he didn't get a chance to ask.
Harry turned to Taranjit. "You live here?"
"You're a lot more agreeable than I thought you would be," Draco elaborated, "Willing to follow."
When he did manage to doze off he found himself in a softly lit room with a mess of papers in front of him. He knew what they said, he’d gone over them multiple times but each time he made a new note in the margin in a neat loopy handwriting. There were potion ingredients, names, places all tightly organized in spreadsheets arranged in front of him and a sense of not having enough time that pushed him to work so everything was ready before the morning. There were people depending on him finishing his work on time and a sense of impending doom hanging over everything that made focusing on the work that much harder.
"You know, pushing me off the edge of a tall building is not that imaginative…" Malfoy mentioned as they walked across the Brigades grounds to reach the base of the column.
“How did you end up involved in it though?” was what he said instead.
“I… ah… yes?”
Blaise couldn’t say anything to that, he knew Draco wasn’t done by the lingering tension in his hands and his shoulders.
Surprise! No, you're not mistaken, it's a new chapter.
"The story has been making the rounds ever since Granger came back," Blaise told him.
As soon as Potter stalked off, Draco slumped down until he was sitting on the ground. He could still feel the magic crackling in the air where he stood just a moment earlier, leveraging all the accusations that Draco thought were secluded only in his head. He allowed himself a moment to breathe and stop the trembling in his hands before pushing himself up and running his fingers through his hair. He walked back to the field hospital and waved away Griffith's questions. Avoiding Miss Rana's enquiring gaze was a lot easier when he got to work but he couldn't ignore it forever when she was right at his shoulder, translating his words to patient after patient.
“My Master is the most adverse of circumstances.” Soup mentioned, threading the line of outright disrespect.
"Healer Malfoy?"
"That's too easy." Potter shook his head, "You don't get to step aside and let someone else deal with the mess. You have to listen and learn and then
(During his visit to Narcissa Draco reflects on the death of his child, the circumstances aren't explained. He considers the nature of a parent's grief, the fact that it would be the year they started hogwarts if they were alive, and how time can't really heal that loss.)
“But it doesn’t erase Healer Malfoy’s responsibility. And until the investigation is over we believe reasonable to suspend him without pay.” Andrews stated. Draco took a slow breath, it was fine, if Dana could fix Potter quickly enough he would be fine.
"I thought it would look great on my curriculum and I kinda also wanted to meet Granger," he admitted, pulling a smile out of Draco. "The five-star accommodation was a nice incentive too."
Saturday night he couldn’t sleep. It was too hot and humid; something must have been wrong with the weather control spells in his room. It couldn’t be by design unless they planned to sweat his ailment away, and what was it with the smell of pond? Was St.Mungo’s that close to the river? When he finally managed to sleep a little, he dreamt.
"Now chop chop, Soup made me clafoutis and you need to eat something too." This wasn't usually the hard part. He usually didn't have his stomach twisted into knots. Eating felt like a feat right then but following Pansy's energy was doable. Papageno helped. The trill of the glockenspiel infusing some artificial happiness into his dreary mood. Pansy chatted about her latest project while Draco forced himself to down some food. The honey tasted like ash on his tongue and not even the coffee brought him joy. He did catch on to the third repeat of the queen of the night aria and raised an eyebrow in question at Pansy.
To the drarry discord squad I hope you enjoy my struggle to find common words when my brain fails.
"I'm trying to heal your ungrateful arse from unknown curses; what I was hired to do."
Blaise slowly ran his hand down Draco’s spine. “Draco, Potter knows perfectly well what kind of man you actually are. I don’t think he has any illusions about you, he’s seen the good and the bad and he still wants to trust you, after witnessing you at your worst. And he’s right to do so because you
“We already established Potter is quite impressive, Bingley” He cut the conversation short.
“I can always look away if it gets to be too much, can’t I?” He pointed out. Dana shrugged and dropped it.
“Looks like you had an interesting night,” Harry commented, getting busy with his breakfast while Malfoy ran his diagnostics.
Potter’s laughter died on his lips. “Ginny and I didn’t get that far.” He said eventually.
"Are you trying to sell it to me?" Malfoy joked.
“He just passed out while I was telling him about finishing the investigation into his accident, must be exhausted,” Ron commented with a chuckle.
“For starters, you’re not going out yourself, with or without me.” By now Harry knew to recognize a deflection.
He washed his face, the water lending warmth to his skin for a fleeting moment. He moved with practiced precision as he shaved. Each kiss of the blade left his jaw smooth in its wake. when he moved down to shave under his chin he slowed down his breath. A familiar stillness filled him, all his focus narrowing into measured movements in a perfect economy of power as he leaned into the ritual to find a center. He washed off the excess soap and ran a finger along his jaw appreciating the smoothness left behind by the goblin steel before picking up his brush to take care of his hair.
"How do you still have the energy?"
Comment to show your support for Astoria's polite drag of Ron and Draco's need to spell things out to Harry.
“I believe that is a very reasonable request. Healer Malfoy will be suspended with pay until the end of our investigation. We’ll reconvene in three days to pronounce on the issue definitively.” She was calm and assertive in a way that reminded Draco of a young McGonagall in a way he never thought possible. Andrews didn’t find it in himself to argue. He exchanged looks with the rest of the committee and then addressed them again “If no one has any objection that’s how we’ll proceed.”
I hope you had/are having a great Christmas day, if you celebrate it, and to all of you who don't, happy holidays.
with Malfoy now?” Harry pushed.
“Something like fifteen moves ago,” Harry admitted, “but you two seemed so into the game I didn’t want to disturb.”
is the one that took the time to polish my draft into a presentable finished product.
A young woman poked her head in and smiled at him. She couldn't have been older than twenty, a colourful hijab in vibrant shades of green was neatly wrapped around her head. "I hope I'm not bothering you, Draco ji, I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Tvarika Rana, I'll be your interpreter for your stay," she introduced herself.
“Maybe another time, chéri,” Draco purred, finally getting on the bed and crawling his way up Harry’s body to kiss him once more. He doubted he would ever get over the small satisfied sigh that Harry breathed every time their lips touched as if he could only breathe when Draco’s lips were on his. “After we have a proper talk about it.” Draco pulled back and smiled down at Harry’s slightly dazed expression before leaning in to lick a long line up Harry’s neck like he’d been craving to do ever since the first time he shaved his face.
"Sir you can't—"
Harry put on his best smile while he was introduced to said woman. She was tall with the kind of strong frame that made Harry think of a devoted practitioner of physical disciplines. Her dark hair was pulled back into a stern and neat plait hanging down her back, but her smile was kind and genuine when she greeted him. Harry brought his hands to his chest and bowed his head.
Draco turned around, almost spilling his half-drunk flute of champagne at the sound of Potter's voice.
"Well, now I'm sorry for a different thing, Malfoy, it's my job to keep smugglers and less than reputable dealers from getting into hospitals, you see?" Harry retorted.
"I honestly don't know. You should try asking the community leaders, and see if they're willing to travel and help out."
"You'll see. Take off your shoes, socks too," he instructed.
“Ginny used to give it to me,” Harry mentioned a little wistfully.
Hermione nodded, “Yes, I imagine dating a patient wouldn’t do much good with your standing with the disciplinary committee,” she agreed.
"Which would in turn either kill him or turn him squib," she concluded.
“I just finished working on his wrist and gave him some pain reliever. You can go in if you want, the entertainment value is pretty high, but he’ll probably fall asleep soon,” he replied with a tight smile.
"I'm glad to have met you, Hari, but I see my presence is no longer welcome." Taranjit smiled warmly and with his whole face, in a way that hid no resentment. "I have no doubt we will see each other again, but I have to travel south soon, I heard Ambassador Granger is looking for mirror-makers."
"I don't hate you, Malfoy," he murmured.
Harry clenched his fists and was ready to bite off his head at that. Of course there was a point. If they could save even only one of them it would be worth it. But Malfoy held up his hand and continued.
"Is she now?" He teased, the barest hint of a smile touching his lips.
He and Teddy made a lot more sense now, someone to fill that void, the closest thing he could get to familial blood.
Things aren't going great for Draco.
Harry’s laugh turned into a moan at the slow tug Draco gave him before leaning down to kiss the head, his eyes fixed on Harry, greedily taking in every twitch of his lips, cataloguing even the most minuscule reaction. And Harry was so expressive, unashamed to make his pleasure known as Draco hollowed his cheeks and swirled his tongue around the head of his cock.
August was never easy for either of them. It was riddled with dark memories and grief. He knew he shouldn't leave her alone during it but it was hard watching her grieve his father or Aunt Bella when he had his own grief to squeeze the air out of his lungs and close his throat with the enormity of it. She reached out to take his hand, her fingers warm and strong on his skin.
“Thank you” he managed, relief flooding him. Malfoy was willing to let it go and pretend it never happened. He still felt like he had to explain himself though. “I know it must be weird for you… well… I… but it’s not…” Malfoy’s questioning head tilt made Harry forget where he was going with it. “It’s, you know, you’re straight and… ”
“Do I at least get a consolation prize out of this?” Harry asked.
“Good evening, Soup, how are you doing?” Blaise asked, the warm lilting tones of his voice instantly relaxing Draco as he listened to the exchange. They’d done this dance before. Blaise had his back and as long as he was there he was safe.
“I gather you might be interested in submission.”
Come over to
“So am I,” Malfoy replied.
Harry dutifully raised his hands so Hermione could see.
Draco quickly summed up the events up to the morning, laying out his working theories on why there was no residue decay, asking how they could work around whatever was causing it and eliminate the residue if the host’s body wasn’t collaborating.
That was how they ended up, the three of them, standing right outside of the wards of Grimmauld Place. Volatile was a very euphemistic way to describe it. It looked like a storm in a snowglobe, the house seemed turned almost liquid on the other side of the ward, warping and changing with every second they looked at it. Harry didn’t know what to say or to think. He had never been overly fond of the house, there were a lot of painful memories there, the shadow of war in every corner, but it had also been a safe haven. It had been the fleeting dream of freedom from the Dursleys when Sirius offered to take him in, a roof over him, Ron, and Hermione while they were on the run, a house to welcome Teddy in. And they’d worked so much to make it a home. Despite everything, or maybe because of it, Harry felt a clench in his heart at the thought of losing it.
“How are you most comfortable?” Draco asked, popping the bottle open with a grin.
"It's not truly relevant, is it? It's the best configuration possible. Am I undervalued? Yes. Do I enjoy that? Not really. But this is how your mission succeeds and I'm broadening my cultural and technical horizon. Wasn't that what you wanted from me?"
“To ‘Mione,” Ron corrected him. “I just happened to be the one with the means to actually do something about it, so I did.”
Hermione's frustration was far too easy to read in any language, the clenched fists, tapping feet and tugging of curls didn’t need translation. It was worse than she'd originally thought. Harry glanced at the kids gathered a bit away, trying to look inconspicuous as they eavesdropped. They couldn't have been much older than fifteen. In a better world, they would be about to master control of their power, they would have had years to explore the possibilities of magic. Instead, they were cut off from their history by a cruel trick of someone pulling the strings of something infinitely bigger than them and at the same time inconsequential, like the spasmodic desire for more of a man halfway across the world, a hunger that could never be satiated.
Some of you called it that things would turn out disastrous and... good job, you were right.
"I'll do my best," Harry replied with a half-smile.
“Nonetheless the committee cannot ignore the fact that you used unsanctioned procedures on a patient. That is not something we take lightly.” Draco nodded, fully aware of the cost of his actions. “It compromises the safety of our patient and we cannot abide that.”
His eyebrows were furrowed and his jaw clenched.
"A picture will last longer, Potter," Malfoy told him, a corner of his mouth curled in the smallest teasing smile.
Malfoy nodded, clearly pleased, an almost proud light in his eyes and the hint of a smile curling his lips that made Harry feel accomplished.
and tell me there isn't something magical about it. Pansy's crush might be based on real life events, sue me.
"Then keep me awake," he grumbled, pushing himself up to sit straighter. "Tell me about Amritsar. Have you been before?"
“I know, but I don’t think I really knew what I wanted back then, I went into law enforcement because it was the path of least resistance. People expected it of me and I didn’t hate it,” Harry replied, pushing the chessboard aside, this wasn’t a conversation to have with barriers in the middle.
Hermione held onto her hat, as the hot wind threatened to carry it off. The white sand was on the edge of too bright under the summer sun, even behind the dark glasses she was wearing, as the jeep left the outskirts of El-Tarif behind to head towards the desert. The streets got narrower and rougher the further they went from the city.
“Bonjour professeur, merci beaucoup d'avoir accepté de parler avec nous.” Draco greeted him.
"I've learnt not to underestimate you, Potter. You're a devious shit with the face of a Gryffindor." Malfoy almost sounded impressed when he said it, and Harry knew to take it as the roundabout compliment it was meant as.
As usual
“What you asked for, Master Malfoy,” he said handing him the board. “And what you didn’t,” he added, dropping the lunch on the table before disappearing.
Blaise would have never imagined that, after resolving to take the dark mark at sixteen, Draco would ever be in this kind of position again, fighting his every self-preservation instinct to protect someone else, falling apart in his arms. Being charged with the responsibility of Potter’s continued wellbeing was going to destroy Draco and Blaise wondered whether he could rise from the ashes again after it happened.
“No, he’s sleeping off the effects of the latest round of testing, and he hasn’t been sleeping well at night,” Malfoy replied, summoning a chair and sitting down next to the bed. He took out a pad and jotted down a few notes.
"Do I?" Draco turned his arm so Potter could see the entire image, the faded skull and vibrant scales of the snake were traversed by a wooden staff, filling the empty spaces between the coils of the snake. It was a simple detail, easily overlooked by one who knew of the Dark Mark, but it turned the vile brand into a rod of Asclepius. Potter's eyes flicked between his face and his arm, putting the pieces together.
"It seems there was a bit of a mix-up. I imagine the communicating rooms were meant for you and Granger." He waved a hand in the general direction of the room Hermione was currently residing in. "Security reasons."
“It was really no trouble. Anything you need to get Harry back into fighting shape as soon as possible.” He smiled, holding out a hand to shake.
“You have to use it for good sometimes. Can’t always be political scheming and manipulation of public opinion,” Draco replied casually with a half-smile, reaching for his wand and then hesitating when he realised both hands were covered in bodily fluids.
SHE LIVES!
"And how does she look without?" He asked casually.
"I was unprepared and of little help," he argued.
Malfoy hummed, slipping the list in his pocket. “You’re right, you shouldn’t, I’m sure you have everything Andrews needs,” he replied, leaning closer to the window and rattling off a few potions from the list and a few he suspected would be missing from stock. McReary’s cheerful smile slowly twisted in a grimace.
"I promised," Draco murmured, an aching tenderness filled his voice, as if it was the one thing he'd most wanted to do in the world.
Draco hummed his acknowledgement as he kept working. He wanted to get as much done as possible, but he doubted he could pull a complete reconstruction in one day.
“Draco, look at me,” Blaise told him. “What’s the goal here? What is it that you want?” he asked softly, resting a hand over his heart, searching his eyes for an answer.
Detailed warnings in the end notes.
“Thank you for the all-expense paid date!” Ron replied with a grin.
Draco woke early in the morning, with the sun hitting his eyes and reminding him they'd forgotten to close the curtains. Potter had wisely fallen asleep with his back to the window, and the white sheets were all tangled with his legs. He was restless even as he slept, but in that moment, with the clear blue sky outlining his profile and the shape of the Golden Temple over his shoulder, he looked at peace, even just for a second. His chest rose and fell slowly. The taste of sweet milk on Potter's lips still haunted Draco and he ached to reach out and run his fingers through his hair, growing longer, and by some miracle, less messy, but he was too afraid to disrupt that moment of peace.
"As long as I don't fall asleep, I can make it two days. Three is a bit of a stretch."
“I thought you would be a lot smoother,” Harry teased, kicking off his own shoes.
“I am,” Draco confirmed with a short nod. “And my perspective looks very promising,” he added, hoping it might motivate her to drop whatever was in that ominous envelope.
As usual, the comments section is the place to scream, alternatively, the ask box on
@Onereader this chapter is specifically for you.
The perfectly crispy hash browns didn't keep Draco from eyeing the pancakes Potter was having, or the dips arranged on the table in front of him. He was unsubtle enough that Potter ended up offering him a taste, in the name of Draco's cultural education, of course.
He wordlessly gestured for him to follow as he headed to the kitchen.
“Then what is it? This is good press. You saved the Golden Boy, they’ve got nothing on you.” Blaise reasoned. “Unless… How did you save our gloriously fallen hero?” he asked, the suspicion bleeding in his voice.
And with that word, the spell was broken and time started running again. Even as he went to shower, Draco could still feel the gentle caress of Potter's eyes on him.
"In September. I will take the recruits on a training retreat after my birthday and then take a sabbatical. I have already arranged it with the department."
“You go on home, Harry Potter!” Soup replied throwing his tiny hands up in frustration.
Hanson brought in breakfast and an update on Harry’s favourite news story: the potion smuggling ring. it wasn’t good news though, when was it ever? They had to release some of the people arrested in the latest raids because of lack of evidence.
Draco turned his left arm so Griffith could see the Dark Mark still undeniably there, etched into his skin and clearly recognisable even with the modification Draco did to it.
“Do you need something?” he asked, walking back up to the bed, when he got there Potter seemed to regret everything about his choices up to this point, avoiding Draco’s eyes at all costs.
Pansy gave him that look like he was missing the obvious, that small tilt of her head and twitch of her lips that spoke volumes. She shrugged off the light summer robes and revealed the corset underneath. It was paired with a skirt with a dizzyingly high slit showing off her legs and thigh high boots with way too many laces to be practical.
Next up: some more plot and then Christmas.
"It's a pleasure to meet you, sāhiba."
You can always come over to
Hermione hummed, “Always pegged Harry for a bit of a masochist,” she commented. Draco couldn’t disagree, but there was no way to politely agree with a statement like that.
"We'll work on it," Draco smiled, retrieving the toy and handing it over, "You're already pretty good," he assured.
Draco should have known better than to let himself get slightly buzzed on champagne. If he'd kept his guard up, it wouldn't have been so easy for Granger and Blaise to ambush him as the party got in full swing after midnight.
Draco hummed his agreement. "It's a nice change of pace for me too," he admitted.
“You’re dressed scary, I like it.” He announced looking at Malfoy’s clothes “Your robes are super cool.” He ran a hand down the lapel, studying it with furrowed brows. That did the trick and kicked Harry’s brain back online. Just as Malfoy said something about introducing Teddy to the designer he called
"Show me your arm, Potter, let me see the damage," Malfoy told him.
Harry's sense of loneliness and isolation gets exponentially worse throught the journey, he disconnects from his family back in England and breaks down in the arms of strangers. There is a vague mention of unwanted avances, blink and you miss it.
Departing the following morning was surprisingly emotional. Griffith in particular insisted on thanking him for the guidance in the past few months and asked for Draco to put in a good word for him with Wizards Outside Nations.
"I need you balanced, not sorry," Healer Gupta replied with a teasing smile. "Let's fix you."
Harry hummed, still unconvinced.
"How long until she gets suspicious about us being incommunicado, do you reckon?" Malfoy asked casually.
“He’s in a terribly inconvenient position, you see, he usually has Hermione to discuss academics, but she absolutely refuses to consider divination in any academic context.” She explained with a fond smile, making Harry giggle at the memory of Hermione’s contentious relationship with the divinatory arts.
Draco woke up feeling like a corpse washed ashore. His head throbbing with every movement. The single ray of pale morning light filtering in through the curtains felt like a needle stabbing his eyes. And his mouth… There were no words for it. The vial of hangover cure was like a heavenly vision on his nightstand. He reached for it, trying to move as carefully as possible not to upset the beast that had taken residence in his stomach and threatened to upend it at any moment. He forced himself to down all of the vile tasting liquid and not throw it up immediately. It was going to take a few minutes for it to take full effect and he breathed slowly through his nose, counting the seconds. Why did it have to taste so bad? It was probably karmic punishment for the drinking he’d partaken into the night before. He should develop a better tasting version. He could make millions out of it, better the world sensibly too.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Fuck, Draco…"
“Of course not.” Andrews didn’t falter “The reports were more than detailed enough for us to get a clear picture of the situation.”
“It migrated?” she was unconvinced “I think we should look into that if the patch gives us another day.” she pointed out
It took a bit of manoeuvring on Malfoy's part, switching hands of his wand, but eventually, he dropped the shirt on the wet cave floor.
His progress was tangible, literally. He spent a lot of time poking his new arm, which was starting to look remarkably like the old one. Where there used to be a gash on his chest, now only a faded discoloured patch was left. Harry could barely see it most days. But most importantly, he didn’t feel like he would split open every time he sneezed; he wasn’t afraid of breathing too deeply.
“Who do you take me for?” She asked with a small smile, offering him her arm.
He didn't get an acknowledgement back but he had bigger things to worry about than Potter's pissy mood.
“This is how it’s going to work: you get rid of whatever you absolutely do not want to risk me knowing and deposit it in the pensieve. Know that either way, whatever I happen to see in there will stay between us and I expect you to do the same for me,” Malfoy started explaining, plain and easy, his voice steady and much more comforting than the last time someone tried to train him in Occlumency.
A luxury hotel before dawn was an eerie thing to experience. Staff members walked quietly around the kitchen and the restaurants, preparing for breakfast service, but everything else was caught in complete stillness. A sleepy man at the front desk nodded at him when he passed by, heading out to the back garden. The air was still cool from the night, dew dotting every blade of grass and clinging to the edges of the big stone slabs forming the path.
“Auror Potter is currently under the effect of a… I believe you defined it as a /pseudo-bond/ as a direct result of Malfoy’s intervention.” Andrews interjected. Draco avoided Blaise’s look.
We're heading back to the beginning because what are endings if not new beginnings?
Draco had to admit the weather control, Egyptian cotton sheets and a mattress at the exact right level of firmness had its advantages when he woke up rested and refreshed. He still took the time to go out and do some yoga; he knew better than to skip it, given the long hours of fiddly work ahead of him, he couldn't afford to have a crick at the wrong moment.
He spent a lot of time sitting near the edge of the village, staring down at the path out the jungle, waiting for the man to finally show up. Vaisakhi came and went and Malfoy sat next to him as the sun went down after another hot day, the air around him cooling and the sounds of the jungle changing from the light song of the day to the quieter whisper of the night.
Before he had time to consider the possibilities and wonder how it would feel to spend long afternoons playing chess with Malfoy, if it would feel the same as when he did it with Ron over winter break…
“You can be whatever you want, Teds” Harry told him. “As long as you make all your NEWTs and train hard.” He added.
He didn't bother changing before going to the manor, his mother would enjoy seeing him dressed up and they could discuss Pansy's work instead of his own.
“Interesting idea. Not many people have the skills for using wild magic like that.” he pointed out.
"Which is explosively, horribly bad I imagine," Draco sighed, pushing off and walking closer to the window.
“I see. Quite daring of you.” He commented with a smile that went straight through Draco like a breath of fresh air in the summer heat. The gratuitous approval of his choices wasn’t something he got often and it felt better than he was ready to admit. “I’m afraid I don’t have any more advice to offer. These are delicate matters, quite unique to each patient, but feel free to call again, the school year doesn’t start for a while yet.”
"What now?" Harry asked.
Ron was MIA as well.
"Sure, Potter," Draco sighed with a shake of his head, throwing his free hand up. "Let's go to Mumbai. When are we supposed to leave again?" he asked Granger.
Malfoy took a step back as if Harry had slapped him.
Harry woke up to a very intense game of chess being played over him, he doubted either of them noticed he woke up and for once he could appreciate just how intense Ron got over chess without being the one to get utterly destroyed on the board. They were both so into it, Ron hunched over the board and Malfoy sitting even stiffer than usual, the tension between them was palpable as they stared at the pieces calculating and strategizing before each move. He’d never seen the pieces be so quiet during a game, when he played they were very opinionated about his choices. He tried very hard not to resent tiny chess pieces for the blind trust they put in other people, Malfoy he could understand, he must have played a million games on that board, but Ron? Why were they so trusting of Ron?
“Blimey, mate, you’re bonded to one of their cooks,” Ron chuckled.
"Hush, Draco, Hugo is a great kid," Astoria chastised him. Her chuckle made the reprimand less than effective and Draco allowed himself a private little smile behind the glass.
Harry managed a weak chuckle. “Yeah, the press doesn’t represent me quite accurately… Surprise!”
Healer Gupta nodded. "From 1858 when the crown took control after the East India Company, they made the communities"—she glanced at Yuvarani, trying to find the right word—"invisible?"
“That one you’ll have to figure out for yourself,” Harry replied with a grin.
“Not approved by the British Order of Healers,” He sighed, sipping a little more firewhisky as he slowly slumped down on the couch.
There's talk of James, Lily, Sirius and Remus being dead, it's not entirely sensitively handled.
"Why are you telling me all of this?"
“What do you think?” She rested her hands on his shoulders, meeting his eyes in the mirror. He just nodded at her.
“We need to be on a first-name basis,” Harry told him with a small smile.
first and I don't release you from your debt."
“I’m sorry for doubting you, Soup,” Harry apologized.
Harry nodded and took Draco’s hand. He breathed in deeply before taking a resolute step through the wards. He held his breath for a moment, every muscle tense as he waited for the pain of wild magic to hit him, but nothing happened for several long seconds. When he opened his eyes, Grimmauld Place was standing straight in front of them, the spring sun shining over it. It looked better than it ever had, almost glowing from the inside.
“I’m taking a trip to France to tour Laennec Hospital and take an interview with them,” Draco replied. “So it would only be you and Soup. Might be a good time to make peace with him, he’s not too happy with you still.”
Then, he joined Harry in the kitchen and casually told him to lose all his clothes and meet him in the living room. Setting the leather armchair just right to catch the light of the bay window didn’t take more than a minute and he suspected Harry might have vanished all his clothes with how fast he came to meet him.
She pointed at a tree stump and Draco flopped down with a sigh. He could have fixed his hands with a quick charm but the pain reminded him to pay attention to what he was doing.
“I want to see you come, Draco,” he purred, tightening his grip a little. “Are you going to come for me?”
"Can I ask you what happened between you and Harry?" she asked in a tone that was less Ambassador and more Granger.
"It's not like you put in much effort in the following seven years," Harry pointed out mildly.
“Sorry, people are usually asleep when we lift the stasis” Malfoy apologized, carefully applying a salve to his chest. The skin was pink and tender under his fingers, feeling almost fragile, like a barely healed burn. Malfoy’s cool fingers on him felt great, alleviating the tightness and bringing feeling back into the area. He wrapped him up in bandages, smoothing the edges down with a gentle swipe of his hand before addressing him.
He knew during the day he wasn't going anywhere. They were stuck on the island and Foster swore both he and Griffith barely left the field hospital's operating room. So, whatever it was he was doing had to be done early in the morning or late at night. Harry followed him out of the back entrance into the garden. Did he have a member of the staff helping him with his plot?
And then there was Malfoy playing hero, gloating and showing off, laughing with the locals like this was some kind of game to him, a different kind of vacation.
Malfoy gave her an amused look and pulled a scrap of paper from his breast pocket.
“I don’t care, I want to take the organization down,” Harry insisted stubbornly, staring Malfoy down.
"Very slowly and one at a time. We couldn't get to the entire population before our energy was too depleted to continue safely."
He woke up to voices in the room, bickering. As he blinked, Ron and Draco came into focus, arguing over a newspaper. For a moment his brain misfired, struggling to compute why it wasn’t Nurse Hanson the one in his room early in the morning complaining about the news.
“No need to thank me, my young friend. I'm always happy to help hard working healers, even english ones.”
"Do you want me to come along?" Draco asked.
Hermione had a one-track mind when she worked, the fact that she was even thinking about massages and flower baths meant something was up, and there was only one way Harry was going to find out what.
“Come on, let’s get you to bed. One of us can’t afford to go to work hungover tomorrow, and it’s not the sober one.” He carefully helped Draco to his feet and made a slow stumbling way to his bedroom. He made sure he was tucked in and left a vial of hangover cure for him, along with a glass of water.
“Before I leave you to an undoubtedly satisfying lunch I wanted to introduce you to Healer Dana,” Malfoy mentioned, gesturing to the woman next to him.
"He's going to be great," he murmured. He took a swig of lemonade and wished it was something stronger and distinctly inappropriate for a five-year-old’s birthday party. "You and Pansy will make sure of it."
“Healer Malfoy.” Brown called him after wiping off a rune from Harry’s chest “The patch” She pointed at the square of enchanted gauze keeping the hole in his chest stoppered. Malfoy stepped up to take a look at it and hummed.
Harry felt it as soon as they emerged back into florid vegetation. Something was wrong. It was in the eerie silence of the jungle, the stillness of it when it should be crawling with life. His worst hunch was confirmed as soon as they breached the wards to find what looked like a ghost town. The stench of Dark Magic was heavy in the air and while Harry's step faltered, Malfoy had already dropped his backpack and got his wand out to scout the first few buildings.
“Sadistique isn’t leaving if we don’t show up right at opening time, especially on Tuesday night.” He reminded her as he took off the cufflinks and unbuttoning his shirt a bit. “I think I’m keeping the hair for tonight.” He decided, quickly switching trousers. “Are you coming like that?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at Pansy’s work attire.
“What does Soup think about that?”
Teddy insisted on getting another hug and managed to extract a promise from Malfoy to come and have a look at his new potions equipment and test his new quidditch gear. Malfoy agreed easily, too easily, indulging Teddy’s request as if he wanted to look at cauldrons and scales during his time off. He even ran his fingers through Teddy’s hair, looking down at him with infinite fondness on his face and Harry didn’t know what to do with that as Malfoy left the room.
"You grew a pair of lungs on day one," Potter interjected as Granger stepped up again.
“Soup wasn’t as fond of old Master Malfoy as he is of his son.” The elf replied with a small melancholic smile before walking out, leaving worlds unsaid with that single sentence.
“You can stay at mine,” Draco offered.
Harry glanced at the men and women behind him and he knew he couldn't accept that.
Malfoy had brought him his own board. He picked up the white bishop looking at it, wondering what it meant. Did Malfoy had it laying around? Did he usually play chess at the hospital? What did Malfoy do with his downtime anyway?
"Mh?"
All in all, he came out on the other end of the week much in the same state he came in. Healer Dana couldn’t start the treatment until they had a clear understanding of his body’s reaction to it and neither she nor Malfoy seemed any closer to a breakthrough. On a positive note, none of the potions they tested him for poisoned him, which could only be a good sign and he was determined to take it as such.
Malfoy hummed and zipped up the suitcase before turning to face him.
Remember to comment if you're having a good time. Or if you're having a bad time and like it that way, we don't judge.
epilogue
He pulled back when Harry turned his head, burying his face in the pillow. “A-ah, Harry, eyes on me,” Draco told him, running a hand down his stomach, smiling with twisted delight at the needy whine coming from Harry’s lips. “As long as your eyes are on me, I will keep sucking your cock.”
"You heard Healer Malfoy," Griffith stepped in when the rest of the Healers refused to collaborate.
Harry turned to look at his face, the hesitance and anticipation swirling in his grey eyes couldn’t be masked by a tentative smile.
That was the moment Harry decided to try and keep the shaving to a minimum until he could do it himself. He would miss having Malfoy’s hands on him, but it was for the best of the community at large and the maintaining of whatever shred of professionalism he could cling to at that point.
"Can I come too? I'll help you pick!" Rose chimed in.
Share your love in the comments, it keeps me going and I love hearing your thoughts on this beautiful trainwreck
“Is it true?” Teddy asked Harry.
He was still carrying around that weight in the pit of his stomach when they got back to the hotel after the second day of work and decided he couldn't handle another meal with Malfoy's short hair shining under the lights and his perfect smile seducing everyone it was directed at. He excused himself with Hermione and walked out on his own. They were with Foster in the unlikely possibility that anything were to happen that needed Auror intervention.
He looked away and took an unusual interest in the potted plants on either side of the door to the restaurant until they finished their small talk. He could bite his tongue for a while, at least in public.
(See the end of the chapter for
They spent a lot of time together, and the more they did, the better they communicated. Harry found that it became easier to find words for what he felt and what he wanted, and save for his usual sharp wit, Draco always listened without judgment, encouraging that open line of communication, even when it came to the darker things. And it wasn’t just words. After spending so much time in and out of each other’s heads it became almost natural to do it when trying to find words was too difficult, or they were just too lazy to try. Much to their friends’ annoyance, barely two months into their (official) relationship, they could hold entire conversations in silence. Ron and Hermione had nothing on them.
I don't think any particular warning applies here, except the usual impending death but I believe at this point it goes without saying.
Harry did a quick headcount and then turned to Hermione. "Where's Malfoy?"
“Where?” he asked
"What is this?" Harry asked, trying to read it before Draco resized it and slipped it into his pocket.
Just as he leaned in to kiss her a door materialized in front of Harry, slightly ajar. As he reached for it, it shut and he was back in the darkness in front of the silvery dome, he was back in St. Mungo’s on his next breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
Finding Bill Weasley there was a surprise, albeit a pleasant one.
They ended up spending the afternoon playing scrabbles with Rose and trying to keep Hugo from eating the tiles. At one point, Hugo decided he wasn’t getting enough attention and decided to grace them with a song that Rose declared resembled a Kneazle’s mating call. Nurse Roberts was delighted enough by the show that gave Hugo a lolly, and it was of course a token of appreciation for his singing, not a device to occupy his mouth otherwise.
for the beta work, she's the real MVP, picking through grammar and syntax, forcing me to write things that make sense.
Draco leaned against the column of the bed canopy and crossed his arms.
Sunset found them slowly cleaning off the powders, aiming gentle sprays of water at each other and watching it sluice off into the ground in small streams of ever-changing colours.
Malfoy got them something to drink and the sweet milk and almond soothed Harry's parched throat.
And we're off, remember to leave comments and support your local angst dealer.
“I’ll have you know what distinguishes a proper gentleman is dedication to perfecting a craft,” he purred, jostling Harry a little as he blindly kicked off his boots.
“Alright, I’ll let you back to look for what you need, but you can’t tell anyone,” McReary cracked, opening the side door for him. Draco smiled brightly at him.
Harry shrugged, smiling back a little. “You got something for me?” he asked, nodding at the vials on the bedside table.
Still in its sealed container.
“You made the Prophet’s front page this morning,” She mentioned, sitting down on the chair next to the bed.
“Oh, no, that only collapsed the building,” Ron shook his head.
“Was it before or after the painkillers?” she asked as he put the kettle on. “Because he might not remember it in the morning.”
"Touch the egg with your cursed hand."
The gurukul was gorgeous in its simplicity, the domed roof and many arched windows made it elegant and the red bricks made that elegance welcoming to scholars looking for a home to learn and grow in. There were torches all around, giving a warm glow to every room, and somehow the men and women dressed for a formal occasion didn't seem out of place.
Harry pushed himself up, a wide smile never leaving his lips. “Yeah,” he replied, reaching for Draco’s belt, quickly unbuckling it. “You’re way overdressed.”
"People don't usually have very friendly reasons to try and get a hold of me, not people from my home country at the very least," he mentioned, holding open the flap of a tent for her to walk in.
"Yeah, yeah, just checking in." He invited himself in and flopped down on a chair, watching Malfoy pack.
“So basically magical equivalents of petri dishes.” Potter insisted.
Weasley narrowed his eyes at him, at the ease with which he came up with the plan and pushed him to lie again. He could tell he wanted to argue more but Potter’s voice cut through.
“Relax, Potter, it’s ok,” he chuckled, leaning back into his chair.
Draco was getting ready to leave when he realized the shrunken chessboard was still in his pocket. He sighed and decided he could just drop it in Potter’s room on his way out. He checked he wasn’t forgetting anything, picked up the damned green envelope and walked out, following familiar corridors at a brisk pace.
Harry sighed, picking at the patch on his chest. It started bad and it was getting worse. Malfoy’s optimistic outlook on his recovery was getting less and less realistic as the days went by, and Harry was already restless. His place wasn’t in a hospital bed lying about doing nothing. There was a potion smuggling ring out there that needed dismantling.
Malfoy and his mother had come up a few times but Harry never realized just how close him and Teddy had become through the years. Probably because by unspoken rule Andromeda and him avoided speaking about the Malfoys in his presence. He only had a vague concept of their relationship. Nothing had prepared him for Malfoy lighting up at the sight of Teddy, or his godson launching himself at the man filled with delight at his presence, or the way Malfoy caught him easily and held him like he was something precious and fragile. Like he…
The confidence with which Malfoy stepped into his personal space, the firm and sure way his cold hands manipulated his face, the smooth slide of light fingers on his neck made him almost wish that pale hand closed around it, pressing until it was hard to breathe, upping the sense of danger already coursing through Harry’s veins with every touch of the blade. Harry found himself instinctively baring his neck for Malfoy more than once.
"You did good work today, Griffith," he mentioned when he noticed the other man staring sullenly at his food.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Much, much cooler.” Dana nodded, jotting down a few notes on Harry’s chart. Harry couldn’t find it in himself to argue that point.
"It's not a question of how, Malfoy, it's a question of why," Potter interjected. "It's the new fashionable thing to do. We need someone committed who isn't going to baulk when things go wrong, who's going to know when to tread lightly."
“I couldn’t sleep all night, I kept having these odd dreams and now I feel like something crawled in my mouth and died, my head is killing me and I have horrible nausea,” he listed off dutifully.
"I have a duty towards you," Draco whispered.
Mind the tags and read responsibly, the angst, self loathing and self destructive tendencies are only just starting.
Harry hummed and helped her get rid of her scarf and coat, shoving them unceremoniously into her pouch, still envious of the ease she had around Extension Charms, then he headed out to the dock with the rest of the delegation. Foster caught up to him as soon as they stepped out into the late afternoon sun.
Once properly caffeinated and fed Draco went to get dressed, as he buttoned his robes, smoothing down the shoulders he swiped aside the vulnerability, cloaking himself in the impeccable composure he’d learned from his mother.
“Yeah” Harry confirmed with a sigh.
“I know about that one already,” Harry told him softly. He knew Malfoy had been branded. Everybody did.
“I have a job,” Draco told him, folding the parchment back up.
“It’s hard to describe but it’s not just dreams. It’s like I am another person, I feel what they feel, on some level know what they know… but not really, it’s just…” Harry struggled to put the feeling into words, it wasn’t something easily explained but he knew the sensation intimately.
As they lay down on the ground, dried and clothed again, Harry felt the urge to speak.
Malfoy scoffed "I let him win because his life was just tragic." He replied, the glint of amusement in his eyes unmistakable and so foreign that Harry did not have the processing capacity to find a suitable retort. Teddy narrowed his eyes at him.
“We have examined the reports and heard the accounts of the equipe” Andrews started.
“I know,” Blaise murmured, pulling him up, letting him cling to him and hide his face in his neck as the first sobs wracked him. “I know you do, and you are, Draco, but you’re entitled to happiness too.”
"Do you already have a departure date?" Hermione asked.
Andrews didn't tolerate tardiness unless it was his own apparently. It was just ten minutes before they were called in, but it was the principle of it, the implicit show of power in leaving someone waiting, that irritated Draco. The committee was supposed to be a neutral body, it should be supporting the staff, troubleshooting problematic circumstances and setting up protocols to prevent them from happening again, not a place to appease the power fantasy of some individuals.
"I'm listening."
Harry grinned and nodded. "Meet me back here at eight."
By the time Hermione came home Rose had switched places with Harry, kneeling on the couch so she could reach his head, and Harry had an undefined number of flower clips in his hair. Rose had given up on trying to braid it pretty quickly, but hair clips and decorative bobby pins were fair game.
"Right away, sayidi."
“I’ll leave instructions for the night shift about your pain management regime, if you get uncomfortable just ask to up your dosage.” Malfoy picked up the chart and jotted down the appropriate annotations about the procedure, he had Healer Dana sign off as well and put it back in place and then finally looked Harry in the face.
"Draco, you're turning twenty-eight this summer," Pansy told him softly, refilling his glass with something that definitely wasn't lemonade. She offered him a piece of ice cream cake as if that could in any way sweeten the bitterness of the truth.
The way the consonants rounded on her tongue already sent Draco back into his body. He sat straighter and closed his eyes. She clapped once and the light ringing sound of a bell resonated. The vibration resonated in Draco's ribcage much deeper than such a soft sound had any right to. The second ring started resonating with Draco's core, the wash of magic on his skin was warm and comfortable as it settled in a grounding weight. It pulled at his core like a harp string until his breath followed.
He was relieved when the door finally clicked open and Malfoy walked in.
“Don’t you think it’s a bit early to ask me to move in with you?” Harry joked.
Harry was torn when Hermione asked him to accompany her to a meeting with the head of the Department of Education. On one hand, he knew she would be able to make a stronger case for reform with him there, his name and his face had some international notoriety and this was a cause he didn’t mind his image being exploited for.  On the other, he wanted to keep a very close eye on Malfoy, but he couldn’t very well say that out loud.
“I should talk to the department head about it,” Harry considered. “It’s not a bad idea,” he hummed, a slow smile coming to his lips as he thought about it.
Harry groaned and slammed his head back into the door, hard enough to startle Draco and make him momentarily worry about the integrity of the wood.
“Draco, Astoria is at peace, even if you bring down the entire organisation she’s not coming back. And Potter...” Blaise blew out a breath “As soon as he’s out of your hands he’s going right back to stepping in front of curses. Is this really worth killing yourself over?”
“You thought about this a lot?” There was no teasing about it, Harry needed to know.
"You'll find out soon enough," Harry replied, too delighted to have such an easy way to get on his nerves.
It might have been Pansy's excellent research results, maybe some melancholy that came with the cold winter on the Mediterranean, maybe Draco was just getting old, but he let her and Blaise talk him into going back to London for New Year's Eve. From there, getting dragged to a Ministry party was a short stop.
They still took it as a victory, and planned to make the most of the time granted.
"Anything's possible, there was a lot of volatile magic in the air at the time. Mine, his, Murphy's, Orion's…" he shrugged. "By the end, the wards were supercharged with a mix of all our magic and they warped to revive Harry. At this point, I have learned that making prognoses about him is an exercise in futility, so we'll take it one day at a time and see what happens."
“You’ll be good as new by tomorrow morning.” He said, straightening up and reaching for a towel to get rid of the slimy residue on his hands. “The skin discoloration might linger for a while, but it usually fades with enough time.” He added.
"I'm doing my best, Potter," he whispered, "But I can't change the past any more than you can. I can only go forward and do better, be better."
Harry's eyes narrowed but he couldn't get a word in. Malfoy had him pinned in place with the weight of his disinterested gaze.
Pansy took the robes off their hanger and held them out to Draco with a small smile. He draped them on his shoulders with an expert move, letting them flutter and settle for a moment, their weight grounding and comforting as they wrapped around him, only one thing left to seal him in his armour.
We start to see Harry's stellar coping mechanisms, crushing loneliness and a touch of anxiety.
"Not even a little bit," he replied just as jovially. At least, save for Professor Chambers, the entire old team was present, which meant at least four people he didn't have to worry about. Three and a half. He wasn't that sure about Griffith.
Harry sighed and aimed his wand, carefully levitating the thing out of the water. As the dark liquid sluiced off it, slowly, as if trying to cling to it, an intricate tiger shaped brooch came to light, and Harry encased it with the strongest Containment Spell he could manage. As soon as the last line was drawn around it and it was cut off from its environment, the water cleared up, going back to its stillness and transparency.
We got a nice and rocky start to this whole thing, no one is happy about the situation except me because I love suffering.
"Sorry. I didn't mean… I was just curious."
The end result didn’t change much either way and after three games Harry sighed, leaning back against the pillows.
Harry tried to argue that it wasn’t true, but deep down he did feel purposeless, a prop for Hermione’s political game. Either way, Malfoy wasn’t done and a hissed word from him was enough to shut Harry up.
Griffith didn't have the chance to reply because Potter squared up with the unfortunate bloke.
Draco caved rather easily and pulled out his own cock, slicking it up quickly, and taking just a moment to enjoy in the incredible sight of his cock cradled between Harry's cheeks, sliding smoothly up his crack.
instead of just whiling the days away.
Of course it was all about how Potter got heroically injured during an extremely daring Auror operation. Words like
The perfectly hot shower he took after getting up did little to lift his mood.
Draco had to take a moment to rearrange himself, his pants growing uncomfortably tight around his hard cock. It was all made worth it by the way Harry’s eyes were drinking in the sight, his pupils blown wide with lust at the barest hint of skin revealed by the few shirt buttons Draco had undone.
The process of regrowing lungs was slow and fiddly, and as he made his way through the first lobe he spoke calmly with Griffith, explaining what he was doing to compensate for the lack of potions.
landed in the foyer of the British embassy in Calcutta Harry was ready to take on the world. The warm fragrant air energised him, but it only took the time necessary for his balance to settle after such a long Portkey jump before the universe hit him in the face with a cricket bat. Malfoy was there, sitting on a low couch, dressed in flowy robes and clearly waiting for them. And that traitor Hermione was greeting him like an old friend. He knew he should have been more suspicious of her evasive answers about the international expert coming in to lead the medical team. He bit his tongue until Yuvarani, the young woman who would accompany them and coordinate with the locals, had shown them to their hotel and helped them settle in their rooms. Then, he marched right up to Hermione's and banged on the door until she opened.
Thank you to Jay for the beta work on this chapter and for being the voice of reason that made me stop fussing and just post this already.
"This is Poddar Home, or as it used to be called Uktarsh Bagh," Draco replied, guiding him up the massive staircase to the upper floor.
Healer Dana came to check in on him after lunch, testing his mobility and asking him about pain level, tightness in the healed area and seemed satisfied with the results. Teddy watched over the process like a hawk, showering the woman with questions. She indulged him good naturedly and asked him if he wanted to become a healer when he finished Hogwarts. Teddy shook his head at that question
The breakfast spread waiting for him on the table did marginally better. He inhaled the first cup of coffee before even touching the food, but the progress he made in raising his spirits was balanced off by the front page of the
” in neat, sharp cursive. Harry watched them for a long moment, waiting for them to move but they didn’t. The black letters sat still, a sharp contrast to Malfoy’s milky complexion. He looked up at Malfoy’s face with a frown.
“I never said I’d do it here. You get me the ingredients, I’ll do my brewing at home. Say that after our latest mishap the Ministry is supplying the potions to treat their own. Wouldn’t even be that big of a lie.”
"It's not that I don't trust your abilities, Hermione," he promised. "but I have to try, you know? I'm turning twenty-eight."
"Yeah," Harry stirred his soup slowly, the clench at his stomach prevented him from enjoying it, not even the warmth of it in his belly was any comfort.
“The lead about the model’s dealer fell through.”
“What’s all the noise out there?” Potter asked, all too happy to change the subject.
Harry nodded slowly, too captivated by the perfect outline of an erection under the fabric of Draco’s underwear, and the curve of his arse that Harry was sure would fit under his palm like the missing piece of a puzzle.
“Yes, please.” Harry grinned.
"I appreciate you defending my honour, Potter, but it's in the interest of the mission to prevent internal conflict," Draco pointed out, taking off his sunglasses. He slid them in the breast pocket of his linen shirt and sat down on the small bench, looking up at Potter.
The amused curl of Malfoy's lips told him in no uncertain terms he wasn't going to find any support there.
The next chapter is not going to happen until the second week of October at least. I have two exams to prepare for and a thesis to write (also two fests to write for, but you get to enjoy those eventually).
“I did not have a thing for Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed, outraged.
“No?” Blaise’s hand stopped in his hair for a moment and Draco craned his neck to look up at him.
So there we go. First chapter out. What do we think? Let me know, I'd love to hear your thoughts on where this story is going I only have a moderately clearer idea about that than you. Love it? Hate it? drop me a line.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't do anything stupid. If there is something wrong in Jawhar send a message back, I'm going to say the same to Harry but I think you are the one who might actually listen."
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s irrelevant,” Malfoy brushed the argument away.
“Want to play some chess instead?” Harry proposed, resigned to the fact that no amount of stink eye was going to stop Malfoy, now that he was on a mission.
Blaise hummed, letting the silence stretch between them for a long moment, giving Draco time to settle the dissonance between what he was feeling and the facts that Blaise had him speak out loud.
"I'm guessing their name isn't Harry Potter and they aren't the literal most recognisable face in the entire UK," Parvati shot back with a knowing smile.
Malfoy sighed and closed his eyes, leaning back against the wall as all the fight left his body. "I suppose I shouldn’t be."
“I think a kiss might do the trick.” Harry grinned, lifting his chin, waiting for Draco to close the distance.
“Off you go, Mr Potter, out on an adventure. Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” she added, holding the door open for him.
for the beta, she came through for me even though she's pretty much in my same boat. Your work is very appreciated.
“And until it’s gone you can’t fix this.” Harry concluded, pointing at his chest, hoping Malfoy would say there was some creative way to work around it. He just nodded. Harry sighed “Alright, lay it on me, why’s it still there?”
When they stood up from the table and parted ways Draco realised that, despite the vegetarian nature of the meal he'd just had, he hadn't missed meat at all. Each dish had been hearty and filling without weighing him down, and the spices had tickled his nose all the way through. He spared a glance towards Potter's retreating back, his head bent to speak quietly with Granger as they made their way towards the bar with Healer Gupta. The rest of the British delegation hung back with Yuvarani in the foyer but Draco decided to lift the imposition of his presence on the group and headed out towards the hotel gardens, determined to finally explore his surroundings and decide how his precious little free time was going to be employed. He had to admit the luxury suites were a pleasant change from his usual accommodations, but after speaking with Healer Gupta about the state of the communities they were supposed to support, Draco doubted he would have many chances to enjoy the many amenities the hotel had to offer, or be a tourist in Calcutta for that matter.
She shrugged noncommittally before exchanging a few words with Miss Rana and one of the elders.
"How do you suggest we proceed?" he asked, picking leaves out of his once sterile equipment. There were some broken windows and the roof was bent where a tree had fallen on it, but the barebone medical tools he had seemed undamaged, if wet.
Draco answered with a look of polite confusion.
“Mhm… Yeah,” Draco sighed, remembering the struggle it had been.
"What?" he asked, "What's wrong?"
"Oh. I'm sorry."
The community leader explained to them how they took care of the island and the island took care of them in turn.
“Fair. So… you too?” Harry asked with a small hopeful smile. Malfoy nodded.
"Potter," Malfoy gently pulled his attention to a half-collapsed corridor.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked, glancing down at the elf.
the one to train you last year."
"And I think… I would like to stay even after that."
“Possibly,” he replied evasively.
“Harry, dear, thank the heavens you’re ok.” Molly’s round face greeted him from the door. “Ron told me about the accident, but I had to see you for myself,” She hurried in, followed by Malfoy at a more sedate pace and a tall desi woman sporting his same robes. Another healer then. He immediately relaxed having people around meant he could avoid going crazy for a little bit.
It took negotiating, needling, cajoling and polite threats for the local government to cave and grant a direct connection between the two communities in the form of a post slot.
He was going to have breakfast and then take a walk, stretch his legs, maybe sit a while in the tiny lounge, find someone to play chess with that might actually let him win… Probably Paediatrics would be his safest bet for that. He chuckled at the thought, imagining what Malfoy would say about that.
“I suppose I would if I read the article,” He offered, unsure what the right answer was to that question.
"Don't you?" Potter's eyes fell to his left arm, the coils of the snake visible where he'd rested it on the table.
He barely heard the “Thank you, Malfoy, you’re a saviour.” Potter called after him.
“I’m sorry for doubting you.” He replied, easily accepting it.
"What will you do with it?" Harry asked.
“Aurors, they win many duels, yes?” He asked “The loyalty of a wand goes to them often. Maybe this is your case?” He proposed.
As usual unbeta'd if you see something say something.
“Does it still hurt?” Malfoy asked, taking his hand and flipping it over, looking for any visible sign of injury, as if it hadn’t been the first thing Harry did upon waking up.
As usual the beta is by the lovely
you pull off exactly?” she asked.
Malfoy glanced at him over his shoulder, "You do know we don't leave for three more hours, right?"
"I know I said I would do whatever you needed from me, Potter, but I seriously hoped it would involve food."
We have a baby, a live one, and Harry getting better, a little bit at a time.
“Can I help you, Healer Moreschi?” he asked, taking off his robes and hanging them. It was clear this was going to take more time than he would have liked.
“No, I want to keep going,” he replied.
As usual
“Good morning, Mr Potter, are you ready for round two?” she asked, lining up the vials on the nightstand once Malfoy pushed the pensieve aside.
“Sure, Seamus will be happy to collaborate.” He replied with a nod.
As he slid between feather-soft sheets, he couldn't help but think about the following day and what might be waiting for them behind the protection of governmental wards confining innocent people away from the resources needed to understand themselves. As big as it may be, a closet under the stairs was still a closet under the stairs. He tossed and turned, as the thought of Malfoy wouldn't allow him to rest. Nobody seemed to be able to see him for what he was. He wasn't even trying to hide it, but somehow, he still had everyone fooled. Everyone except Harry. He was going to keep an eye on him, two if he could manage.
Draco loses his composture when Narcissa's furlough gets denied and he thinks he has to go alone to visit Astoria's grave on the anniversary of her death.
“I… I think I’ll go,” Draco said eventually. “You need to rest.”
They emerged from the gorge and the gentle slopes of dunes met them. Hermione squinted against the glare of the sun in the perfectly clear sky above them. Skilfully hidden under privacy and Muggle-Repelling Charms, was an entire camp. One moment there were only sand and sky in front of her until they kissed at the horizon, and a moment later, they crossed the limit of the wards, and a small city of tents and temporary infrastructure appeared like a mirage in the heat haze rising from the ground.
Harry faces reality and seeks help.
“But you’ve always wanted to be an Auror, ever since Hogwarts.”
"Aren't you asking awfully intimate questions?" Draco asked mildly.
"We would have to sleep outside," Harry warned him.
“No, it doesn’t,” he admitted.
“She works with Pansy. When we heard someone collapsed we thought it was her,” Malfoy explained.
Now onto the chapter, that’s what you all are here for after all.
"I… I don't know how to do that," he admitted.
"You owe ME, Malfoy. Fuck the world. Fuck your redemption. Fuck your ego. You owe
to chat.
The conversation veered into tales about his most interesting scars and he was halfway through the tale behind the hairless patch on his arm, trying to render the intensity of the situation via wild gesturing. It wasn’t quite so easy to mime a duel one handed but he managed adequately if he said so himself. Both the trainees were hanging from his lips as he built up to the climax when the door to his room opened and a nurse peeked in.
“Yes Potter, I favour hardworking trainees over entitled little prats. You should have seen that coming, even though it might be somewhat of an alien concept to you.” Malfoy replied, refilling his glass before sitting down on the chair next to the bed, leafing through the notes as Harry ate. Harry dropped the topic, he knew when not to push, despite what the record might show.
"Siddhima Gupta, she'll be joining us for dinner," Granger confirmed. "Trust me, you'll like her. Speaking of, are you ready to head down to the restaurant?"
I feel like I should warn that there's discussion of grief, in particular the loss of a child. It's quick but I feel like fairly intense. I'll put the spoiler in the end notes if anyone needs it.
“It’s not necessarily bad either. You’re just not bouncing back as quick as I expected, but it’s not like I have an abundance of cases for comparison. You are for all intents and purposes a category of your own,” Draco explained, halfway between frustrated and amused. He lived for research into new phenomena but why did it have to be Potter? “If things don’t change by the end of the day we’ll start looking into what’s causing it.”
"I don't even know where to find someone with the skills for that kind of enchanting," he sighed, and Harry knew there was no going back. It was a question of how, not if.
"Full outfit for this one." Pansy smiled proudly, showing off her work.
Harry and Draco took a slow tour of the house, it was cleaner than Harry ever remembered it being, even after renovations it had never looked so welcoming and warm. Everywhere it was buzzing with Harry’s own magic, making him feel more settled in his own body than he’d felt in months.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asked, the pinched expression on Malfoy’s face couldn’t mean anything good “Aside from the obvious” he added, looking down at the pristine white bandages on his arm and the patch on his chest.
Draco turned to look at him with an expression of polite confusion. He saw no point in discussing it but the deep frown of Potter's eyebrows suggested the man was of a different opinion.
Harry was once again at a loss for words, and Draco hesitated in front of his silence.
"Do I?"
And then they waited.
"We can't just do nothing, Malfoy," Harry insisted, frustration clawing at his throat. "You need to try."
“I hear we’re short stocked,” Draco mentioned casually. “I’ve got a list here from Andrews, mind if I take a look and see what I can substitute?” he asked, the lie falling easily from his lips, smooth and casual enough not to be questioned. Dropping Andrews’ name instead of Ross’ upped the stakes just enough for the boy to feel the pressure.
He stared back at his healer, a multitude of emotions swirling like storm clouds inside the grey eyes fixed on him but looking a thousand miles away.
In front of that irrefutable fact, Hermione backed down. They were all aware of what it meant, but it was Harry that felt the days tick by, each of them a step closer to death. It was like walking into the Forbidden Forest again, only this time it wasn't some grand sacrifice, it was just pointless, an empty void growing bigger and bigger behind his breastbone with each sunrise and sunset until there would be no more.
"I can't believe in a week I'll have to get used to not having you by my side, Miss Rana," Draco mentioned with a half smile.
“It was during the war” Potter said softly, his hand twisting into the sheet “Not many know about it, but I had a connection, a…” He gestured vaguely to his head unsure how to word it “Some kind of soul bond to Voldemort.” He struggled to get the words out as Draco listened quietly and intently “I got these headaches and visions of what was going on around him, feel his emotions when they were particularly heightened, things like that.” He described the feeling as best he could.
“Oh, that got you interested, uh?” Seamus teased him. “No, Zabini’s married to Daphne Greengrass” he told him “Come on, they’ve been to several ministry functions, you’ve seen them together.”
They were set up in an absurdly luxurious hotel smack in the middle of the business district. Hermione scored the diplomatic suite but if his room was anything to go by, they were all in luxury rooms. Somehow it didn't feel right. Neither did the marble under his feet as he walked through the foyer to get out of the perfectly weather-controlled air of the hotel and into the sticky warm air of the afternoon in the city. The sounds and smells of the city assaulted him all at once and pushed every other thought aside for a moment. It felt like being in Delhi for the first time: the giddiness of being back in his family's home country; the thrum of a different kind of magic in the air; the colours everywhere, vibrant under the warm light of the sun starting to lower towards the horizon. He picked a direction and walked, wide-eyed and hungry to get his fill of images, of women in colourful sarees, of men in kurtas, of rough streets under his feet, of white buildings shining under the yellow sun. He filled his lungs with the smell of spices and flowers the deeper he went into the city. Even the smog seemed sweeter somehow, and the sound of car horns less discordant.
"I want you for a mission I'm planning."
"Tvarika?"
You can always come over to
He put on his best kurta, shaved his face clean, and ended up sitting in a stuffed chair in a medium-sized office at the Bengal branch of the Indian Ministry of Magic. He had a chance to argue the fact that educating the entire population would reduce the international sanctions imposed on India for potential breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy, and it would free a lot of resources when they’d be able to resize the Obliviation and Muggle-Worthy Excuses Department, syphoning off personnel from every other department. He hated taking such a utilitarian approach when he wanted to grab the man by the lapels and shake him until he got that every person deserved an education, but Hermione was right to say they needed to court the public officials. She spoke about public support for humanitarian causes, and how no one would be against supporting magical children, how much international interest it would garner, let alone the national notoriety for being the one to start reform in all of India.
