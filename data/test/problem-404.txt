When Harry got down to the common room after having disposed of Dobby’s decorations, he caught sight of Ron disappearing out through the portrait hole, an angry looking Lavender heading back to the dormitories, and an unusually cheerful Hermione coming towards him.
It was with mixed feelings Harry watched Draco Malfoy being dragged by the ear by Filch through Slughorn’s party later that night. On one hand, Malfoy deserved the humiliation of it all, but on the other, he was about the last person Harry had hoped to see. So, when Slughorn declared that Malfoy might stay, no one except perhaps Malfoy himself, looked more displeased. Harry couldn’t keep himself from casting sidelong glances at Malfoy as the latter started chatting with Slughorn, having composed himself. His skin had a grey tint that hadn’t been there before, and his eyes were bloodshot. When Snape finally hauled off with Malfoy again, Harry only needed a moment to decide.
“I’ve figured it out! He’s going into the Room of Requirement! It must be unplottable and that’s why I couldn’t find him earlier.”
“How did you get into my vault?” Bellatrix could be heard shouting upstairs. “Did that dirty goblin help you?”
“Malfoy”, Harry started, then changed his mind. “Draco. We can’t keep doing this. It’s only making things harder.”
It was an hour or so before Ron entered the Gryffindor common room, holding hands with Lavender. Harry rose from his seat by the fire and stalked over to them, grabbing Ron by the collar and hauling him back out of the portrait hole.
The world seemed to slow. Harry’s heart sank, and Ron let out a soft sob. Then, Fred coughed and opened his eyes.
“Go on then, curse me”, Draco said and held out his empty hands. “I’m unarmed, perhaps the ever so honorable Potter has a problem with that?”
Malfoy was looking around, his eyes darting over the place where Harry stood hidden underneath the invisibility cloak several times. Two brooms lay on the stone next to Dumbledore, and Malfoy could see as much. Harry wondered if Draco suspected he was there, but if he did, he was willing to let Dumbledore distract him with questions of his own.
Harry supposed that after what had happened at Malfoy Manor, Voldemort didn’t much care to see that any of the Malfoys carried wands.
“Where are you always running off to?” Hermione asked suspiciously when Harry returned to the common room late one evening, just minutes before curfew.
This fic alters certain bits of the Half-Blood Prince. The parts not mentioned should be read as being the same.
“I got the idea from that girl Granger”, Draco admitted about the poisoned mead. “I overheard her saying Filch can’t tell different potions from each other.”
This fic alters certain bits of the Half-Blood Prince and The Deathly Hallows. The parts not mentioned should be read as being the same.
“Who else?” Draco said, wiping at his nose. He had a nosebleed and a red mark burning across his cheek where Crabbe had struck him. “I could hardly let these idiots wander off on their own. They’re just stupid enough to actually manage to kill you, and they would probably blow up half the castle in the process.”
Draco sighed and sat down on top of a desk. “How did you pass any of your O.W.L.s if you are this dense? It’s an enchanted galleon of course.”
Before they had a chance to revel in their victory, the entire castle shook. Screams could be heard in the distance. Suddenly, Harry was aware of the sound of dueling getting closer. The Death Eaters had breached the castle. Then, Fred and Percy backed into the corridor, dueling men in masks.
“Me and Cho, in here?” Harry said in surprise, turning over to his side to lie next to Draco. “It wasn’t like that. Why, are you jealous?” Harry grinned.
Although they didn’t say it out loud, not finding a new meeting place would be the end of their escapades. With Filch lurking around the castle and the new security measures, sneaking into empty classrooms wasn’t an option.
“Come on now, take a better look”, Lucius said, sounding increasingly excited despite his son’s hesitant response.
He was losing too much blood. In desperation, Harry pressed his hands against the gash across Draco’s chest. It was something he’d seen on muggle television and the only thing he could think to do. He knew it wouldn’t stop the bleeding, but he didn’t know a thing about healing magic. He was vaguely aware of Myrtle wailing behind him, her cries growing louder and louder.
Harry spun around, wand in hand. Crabbe and Goyle were standing shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing straight at Harry and grins spread wide across their faces. In the space between their ugly heads, Harry could see a third face staring at him. Draco Malfoy.
Draco stood up. “If you’re truly convinced I’ve done all these things you accuse me off – opening the Chamber of Secrets, cursing Bell, being a Death Eater,” Draco pointed to his left forearm. “Then, why have you been meeting up with me? Why would The Boy Who Lived run around with the son of a Death Eater if he thought the son was just as bad as the father?” He looked at Harry with the outmost disgust, his face distorted in a grimace. “I don’t owe you any answers, Potter.”
After dinner that day, Draco sent him a message using the coin. Harry was dubious if he dared sneak away on Valentine’s day of all days, but then he found Ron and Lavender, who apparently had made up, feeding each other the rest of Harry’s chocolates in the common room, Hermione nowhere in sight, and felt it was safe after all.
“We thought you might try and duel him”, Ron added. “But I guess you still might have, though it wouldn’t have been in the way we thought.”
When he first heard Narcissa Malfoy’s cool voice, he went stiff and kept his eyes to the ground. He could feel her gaze on him but didn’t dare to look back at her. Her face came close to his, but his features were so distorted by Hermione’s Stinging Hex it would be hard for someone who knew him well to recognize him, and she’d only met him a few times. She pulled up again and turned to the impatient Fenrir Greyback and spoke the words Harry so dreaded:
“I’ve never tried to hurt Weasley. Well, not recently at least.” He sounded confident but didn’t meet Harry’s gaze.
With a stab of fresh anger, Harry thought of Dumbledore’s dismissal when Harry had presented evidence in the past.
It was the first time Harry saw him up close in quite a while – before it had felt like Draco was lurking around every corner, but now that Harry had been searching for him he’d suddenly become more elusive than a Crumple-Horned Snorkack. He noticed that Draco’s face looked thinner, his cheeks sunken in and that he had bags under his eyes. Draco saw him looking and Harry’s eyes quickly darted away.
“They claim to have captured Potter”, Narcissa said and Harry was shoved forward by Greyback. He stumbled – he was still bound to the others and couldn’t move much more than a few steps forward – but managed to stay upright. “Draco, dear, come here and have a look.”
Hermione had stopped pretending to read and Harry saw her exchange a glance with Ron. At least their worry for his sanity had them acknowledge each other, he thought.
“Oh, yeah? Why is that? Tired of cursing Crabbe and Goyle? Want to fight someone who knows which end to hold a wand?”
“Well, I guess, ehm, I’ll see you later, in, eh, potions”, Harry finally said after several moments of awkward silence, hoping with all his heart that Draco wouldn’t bother to attend potions that afternoon.
"Hmph," she said, popping the disc into the player and handing the case to Harry. He slipped the little booklet from the case and opened it to read the lyrics to the song beginning to play loudly.
Ron looked at Hermione. As head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, she'd been receiving the updates from the medical staff in Draco's absence.
"I have to go home for a little while and see Lyra, but I'll be back soon, okay? Hermione's going to take care of you while I'm gone."
Draco looked as though he were about to speak, but closed his mouth on a nod. When he spoke again, the warmth had returned and Harry felt like he'd won a little victory. "Well, definitely not roses then."
Teddy, the boy who'd tried so hard to be like Draco when he was small. Teddy, who brought Harry and Draco together, who taught Draco what it was like to be a family. Their Teddy, who—
Draco felt as though he'd been hit by a train. Every muscle in his body hurt, and he was pretty sure he hadn't been this tired since Lyra was a newborn. At least then, he'd been able to share the experience with Harry.
"The only place in this house where you can tell that Harry was ever here… It's here. In this cupboard. He had a room upstairs for a while when we were teenagers, but Mum cleaned it out and made it into a sewing room after he was gone. She made it rather nicer then, with a rug and new wallpaper and good furniture. But when he was there—"
"I guess I never thought of it like that. I just…" Harry let out a long breath, wondering how much he should tell Draco. He was tired, though, and Draco was helping, so he just sort of decided to go with it. "Look, when I was a kid, I wasn't allowed to be myself. I didn't have a space to decorate, and I didn't really have anything that was mine — not even clothes. I was given something to eat and told to eat it, and if I didn't, I didn't get anything else. Deciding what I liked or not was a luxury I didn't have."
I got up and walked the streets of Montrose, too antsy to sit in one place any longer but not ready to go home.
"I reckon I can't argue with that. Just admire with your eyes and keep your hands to yourself, idiot."
"I don't like the idea of his going off with just anyone, though," he mumbled, his stomach turning at the thought.
"Why she's mad. Rose told Hermione they studied the war in detail in the last month or so of school. And they read parts of the Breddings book."
"Yeah, just a little dizzy. The Healers said I might feel like that for a few days after large uses of magic."
Draco let out a low hum, the sound he made when he didn't agree but wasn't going to argue. He didn't make that sound often, as he did love to bicker.
Harry stepped closer to take the offered seat, getting a closer look at Draco, his first since their return from the holidays. His shoulders were more relaxed, his hair looked softer, and his grey eyes jumped out at Harry, looking larger and deeper than he'd ever seen them, almost like liquid mercury. Was that…eyeliner? Harry swallowed, trying not to think about that, but Draco took the seat next to him, and when the Slytherin draped an arm over Ron on his other side, Harry's eyes widened.
"Oh," Alex said, and he stared at his plate before pushing it away. "I think I'm done. Can I go to my room too? I don't have a phone."
She sat down next to him, and when Ron joined them, she put up a privacy charm obscuring their voices and faces from others milling around nearby. "Right," she started. "So, I'll cut right to what we know."
But Harry was right, Draco could admit that privately. There was something special about doing this himself. Something magical about manually melding his life with Harry's. Because that's what this was, wasn't it? They weren't just moving in together. They were taking the final steps and merging their separate lives into one.
"How's it feel to be official, little bug?" Papa asks. Papa often uses big words that sound fancy, but Alex knows what this one means. It means that it's real. That his family name is now really Malfoy-Potter, just like Daddy and Papa and Lyra. And now, when Papa calls him his little bug, he really is
He hesitated and ran his hand through his hair. In that moment, he looked like Harry and Draco's heart thawed just a little.
When the door opened, it wasn't Lyra though, but Harry. He stepped close to Draco and pinned him to the counter with his hips. "Have a good eavesdrop?"
"Next time, we're bringing decorating and music catalogues. You need to do something about this room."
"I feel horrible. I still think I wasn't completely wrong, that he shouldn't feel obligated to help with the situation, but…"
"I mean that you need to get off your arse and start doing things. Teddy's at Hogwarts, not dead. You're mourning, for Merlin's sake, and I'm tired of watching you sit here every day, hopeless, as though there's nothing left for you." He stood up and grabbed his jumper off the back of the sofa where he'd draped it earlier. "Open your fucking eyes."
Lyra was the primary source, tears running down her face as she sat in the corner. "It's not fair!" she babbled over and over through her tears.
Draco closed his eyes. Cleaning… It was another piece of the puzzle that burned his stomach. Then he had another thought and he had to know. "Did they…beat him?"
"We're going to try for a baby," Hermione said a little bit later after the conversation had died down again.
Walking along the wall of photographs, Draco's eyes sought out any of a small boy with messy hair and glasses. Most were of Dudley at various ages, his parents sometimes present with proud smiles on their faces. As different as they were from Draco and his parents, the Dursleys still reminded him of his own family in photographs from his childhood. These images told the story of a close family and an overly indulged child. Yes, there were definite similarities.
"If I find someone, yes," Harry promised, and the idea of being himself, of being 'out' in a public place gave him a thrill.
He couldn't get it out of his mind as he spent the morning with his mother, Lyra playing with Linney, his mother's house-elf, while the adults examined the financial documents. The manor was not only in debt, but it was also growing further in debt with each passing season, the estate income no longer able to keep up with the increasing needs of the ageing buildings and grounds. Draco needed more than just a one-time cash dump to fix the problem. He needed to better utilise the resources so it became profitable again.
That was what duelling with Malfoy was like. I felt graceful and powerful, and the beauty of the dance between us was something I was aware of from the very first spell. Each spell I cast, I knew he'd be there to parry. When it came to an end, we were both panting and the room smelled of ozone and sweat. The rest of the students were stunned, but the instructor simply grunted, offered us a nod of approval, then told the rest of the class to do what we did.
"You need to talk about it, and Harry doesn't look ready." She flicked her eyes to Draco. "And it'll probably help him help Harry."
Mind whirling, Draco felt like every fear had been confirmed. "Can we see him?" he asked, trying to push his concerns for Harry out of his mind until they knew more. Teddy was the more immediate concern.
So it was that the two of them sat quietly together that Monday evening, exactly two weeks after Harry had woken up in the hospital room. The children were both tucked into bed, and Harry and Draco finally had a moment alone where they were both feeling rested and calm.
Draco was unsure if he'd ever sat through a more uncomfortable dinner in his entire life, and that included those that included the Dark Lord. His daughter snapped at everyone, including her little brother who apparently chewed and breathed too loudly. She'd been scolded for that and proceeded to glare at each person, refusing to say anything else as she stabbed at her meal.
I could hear the smile in his voice. I think that's one of the things I liked best about the Draco of my adulthood. It was like all the empathy he'd lacked as a child had simply built up, waiting to be used now. And he refused to hide it, to put on a stoic face like he'd been taught as a child. Instead, he embraced it.
She looked down and started playing with the skin around her fingernail. "Yeah, that's good. I'm also taking Ancient Runes and Arithmancy. Aunt Hermione said those were some of her favourites, and Auntie Luna says Runes is in the blood, so hopefully I'll enjoy those."
wanted to know more even eighteen months later. He wanted to see, wanted to understand. If only Harry would let him.
Draco changed his angle, and Harry's mind managed to focus long enough to realise his body was reacting in a very not-friendly-like way. He pulled his face to the side, and Draco's mouth began to nibble along the side of Harry's mouth. "Draco," Harry said, his voice barely audible. "Draco," he tried again.
And that was that. Things were back to normal and we stood, going back into the house to make our weekly Wednesday dinner together. It was a tradition we'd started back when we were partners, and it'd stayed around all these years since. He usually came to my house — I'd had Teddy and it made more sense, and now it was just our habit — but we took turns cooking.
Harry nodded, eyes still closed, his head leaning back against the seat. "Vernon's sister. She hates me. Suggested that Aunt Petunia should have put me down as a baby like a runt puppy."
Kreacher grumbled but divided the food between them, silver forks and knives and cloth napkins appearing next to each man.
Harry looked at Draco. Even after the day they'd spent together, the months of becoming friendly, it seemed strange that Draco would compliment him like that.
They went into their bedroom, each taking off their suits and hanging them up, but then Harry couldn't decide what to do next. It was too early to go to sleep, but he desperately needed the comfort it offered.
Harry rolled back, staring again at the ceiling, thinking of what it would be like to be bonded to a man, to have a husband someday. "How did you know it would be worth it?" Harry finally asked, surprising himself that he voiced the question that had been bothering him for so long.
She wiped the tears from his face and crawled into his lap, wrapping her arms around his chest. "Daddy is always okay, right?"
away in disgust. The Hogwarts Express rumbled quietly in the background, an accompaniment to the irritation stirring in his stomach.
Harry's rough, quiet voice woke Draco from his fitful sleep and had him bolting upright in his sleep chair. "Harry?"
Ron and Hermione were sitting across from me in the dingy library of Grimmauld Place. I couldn't concentrate on them, however, due to the incessant buzzing in my ears.
He looked terrible. His eyes were bloodshot and tired, and his hair appeared as if he'd spent the entire day running his hands through it, which he probably had.
Harry thought about his cupboard, about Dudley's second bedroom, about the Burrow and Grimmauld Place and all the places he'd stayed but never really called his own. He looked around his room and sighed.
Draco peeked around the door and could see Harry staring at the bag he'd set on his chair, his shoulders sagging. He withdrew a container of something Draco couldn't see, then tucked the rest of the bag under his desk.
Harry shrugged, feeling the vein in his temple starting to throb at the turn of the conversation. "Hermione and Ron always seem to know how I'm feeling, so I don't need to tell them. And everyone else, well, they have their own stuff to deal with, right?"
"Colour!" Susan said, looking up from her catalogue. "And fabric. Those are where we should start, I think. Harry, what colours do you like?"
Harry nodded. "Yeah. Yeah, I want to ask him. I don't want him to feel like he has no choice in the situation."
Sighing, Draco pulled Harry into his arms. "It was always strange for me, coming home to the manor after being at school all year. You lose autonomy. At school, you're basically on your own, making your own decisions, even at eleven and twelve. And then you come home and suddenly your parents are there, watching and evaluating your every move. Don't you remember?"
He opened his mouth to interrupt because of course, he knew all this, but she held up a hand to stop him, so he let her continue.
Harry narrowed his eyes, but his voice was resigned. "In my experience, getting it out just pisses people off and doesn't fix anything."
Harry thought back to his morning, remembering Susan's stiffened shoulders and sad eyes after he'd snapped at her, and suddenly had a brilliant idea.
"Yeah. And he's our cousin. Well, he was Grandmother's cousin, so that makes him our…" Lyra scrunched up her face like she always did when she had to think hard. "...first cousin, twice removed, I think? Papa would know."
Draco stared. There it was again. He was missing a major piece to Harry's puzzle, and he was feeling around the edges looking for the piece that felt like it fit without seeing the big picture.
An airy, feminine voice answered back. "Yes, he's fine. That bowl was attracting blibberpinks anyway, and they are terrible for creative activity."
"It's only procedure," she said, placing a calming hand on his arm. "Nobody's going to insist he sleep alone, but the option needs to be available."
Draco looked back to the crowd gathered in the cemetery, then he caught Dudley's eye across the distance. Dudley gave a slight nod of acknowledgement, and Draco squeezed Harry's hand again. "We can go. Maybe you can show me some of the places around Little Whinging."
"Well, yeah. I mean, Kreacher doesn't cook for me or anything. He cleans and all, but he doesn't really cook."
Harry drew back, horrified. "No, no, nothing like that. I had no idea you had a flower shop. In Muggle London, especially."
Lyra stepped off the train, her second year of Hogwarts complete. She'd return in the autumn as a third year, and wasn't that strange?
"What is it you want from me?" he finally asked, once Harry thought the silence would go on forever.
"I didn't know that. And I'm sure Vernon didn't either, or he'd have taken it, no question. I heard enough times growing up how much I was costing them."
Harry turned back and there were tears in his eyes. "A family thing. Right. Because I don't understand those, having never had a family."
Harry ran his fingers over the petals of a pretty, white and purple lily, one of the only flowers he did recognise, as he had a smaller version of the flower tattooed on his collarbone. But that wasn't right for today's bouquet. Lilies seemed so formal, and Susan was anything but formal.
"I missed you," she muttered into his chest, the tight feeling in her chest finally relaxing. Merlin, she hadn't realised how much she needed him. Her big brother. She pulled back and dragged him into her room, shutting the door behind him.
Harry's eyes snapped open and met Draco's smokey gaze. "Fuck. No, Draco. Being happy. I'm trying to figure out how you're able to be so bloody happy despite everything. Everything has changed for you — your status, your family, everything — and yet, you actually seem happier than you ever were before. I'm trying to figure out
Draco felt his lips twitch at the childish explanation for Apparition. He wouldn't have thought he had it in him to find humour in anything at the moment.
The following day, a large picnic hamper was sitting on Potter's desk when Draco entered the Aurors' offices. Potter looked up with a grin.
Harry closed his eyes, remembering. "When I got to Hogwarts, everything was new. The wizarding world was completely alien to me, so I just decided to wait and see. And then I was with the Weasleys, and they didn't have much money and I felt weird buying things that they couldn't, so I just didn't. It wasn't important. So here I am, eighteen years old and fucking boring as hell and I don't even know what kind of fucking music I like." His throat burned at the admission, but there it was.
Lyra put her hands on Draco's cheeks and made him look at her in the eye. She did that when she wanted him to know she was serious about something. Usually, he had to try to keep a straight face, but this time, he only had to hold back tears. "Daddy is going to be okay. I know he is, and then you can come home and take a nap too."
Harry groaned, trying desperately to focus on his exams when really all he could think about was his future. Yes, he knew that the best way to plan for his future was by studying, but he couldn't put the quill to the parchment when all his nerves went to thinking about becoming an Auror, not completing his review. In fact, it was so nerve wracking he wished he had some chips to snack on, not just rely on Draco's healthy-alternative snack bars. He wiped his glistening pre-sweat forehead and prayed Merlin for a stress release. Draco wouldn't be any help, since he was the one adamant on studying so hard in the first place. It was no wonder he was so high up the class rank in Hogwarts.
to do this Pettigrew, and today is finally the day!" The wolf screamed, now a dark-haired wizard. The rat whimpered in response, now a unusually looking man who missed a finger. Wait... Pettigrew? Harry remembered that name. That was the man who had been killed right before Harry's parents had... by a man named Sirius Black... "Hey you! Wolf! Turn around!" Harry yelled, finally brave enough to say something.
Hermione held up a third finger. “Three. You might also want to convince Harry there’s no hard feelings between Ginny and him. Without being the bloody obvious thing you are.” Ron put his head in his hands as a sign of giving up. Hermione held up a fourth finger. “Don’t mention his queerness. He’s awfully distant about it. Not even Neville has been able to get it out of him.” Hermione saw him stir and could guess that Ron just realized why Neville had been awfully clingy with him. Hermione held up a fifth finger and smiled. “Accept that they’re going to kissy kiss.” Hermione said, using the words Ron used whenever he saw one of his brother’s relationships. Ron gurgled. “HERMIONE!”
And Ronald had said to be in an interview. But he hadn’t said to be in an interview with the Prophet, and certainly not without Harry by his side. And the fact that it was this man-whoever he was, was asking it, made him feel queasy. “I don’t think I should.” Draco said with finality. “You don’t think? This is not a matter of thinking my boy, but a matter of you shacking up with the Boy who Lived Twice!” His voice was higher by the second. Draco felt him closing in. The door swung open and Zacharius was there with a devious smile. “Now, now, there is no reason to shout.”
A thought reached Harry at once. It couldn't have been a very intelligent one, since he knew they had already gone and looked for the kid, but Scorpius obviously wanted to find the person involved with taking away Draco's stuff. There was no replacing a Dark artifact. It was charmed or cursed. But Draco would know that. "And you let him go anyways?" The officer asked rudely. Harry wanted to jinx him. Or kick him under the table, where the detectives couldn't see. "No. Of course not. He left without my permission. He put a charm on one of the house elves, but the elf had no information when I asked."
“Harry, come on. We need to talk about this. You even brung Colin.” Draco said, concerned for Harry’s lack of ambition towards the subject. “I’m sorry it’s just- he hasn’t even appeared yet today.” He said, putting his face down near the mirror, trying to find out its secrets. But all it shown was Harry’s worried face. “Harry, I’m sure he’ll show at the game. Didn’t he love this kind of stuff? Maybe you can get a picture for him.” Draco knew Harry was just trying to change the subject, but his look was full-proof sometimes. “Yeah… ‘Sorry I’m being like this. You know how I am with… the dead.” Draco nodded. Harry had not been one for visiting portraits after the war, it was a wonder he was so invested in Colin.
Harry found out the truth about the Order of the Phoenix in a way he hadn't imagined. He had been flying slowly down the hill of his tower when he saw a rat scatter ahead of him. But it wasn't an ordinary rat, it was Ron's rat, Scabbers, who regularly went missing and was so old Harry had wondered how it hadn't died yet. Curious, Harry followed it, not sure where it was going and excited to have a reason to be late to study. But then, Harry realized with a disturbed notion that he was being followed as well. He could
He was currently drawing a complex diagram of some star or other with one hand while the other hand was drawing peacocks on his note paper. He was ambidextrous, mind you, and he was also a great multi-tasker, something his father often admonished him about. “Multi-tasking is for the weak-willed, low-minded people, Draco, a Malfoy takes great focus and marksmanship on his craft.” He’d always argue quite literally back, because the busy world left no time for working on one thing at a time. His favorite past time was art, but he’d never admit that to anyone.
“That sounds great! Oh, I feel like you guys are my detectives!” Potter laughed and Draco joined in to keep the two idiots happy. It was better when they were kept in a good mood, after all.
“What does that have to do with anything, pray tell?” Draco almost shouted, his cheeks red from the cold. George was unfazed and continued his speech. “Imagine. A Universal championship, built on Muggle ideas and non-prejudiced Wizards. Plus, the Grand prize.” Draco stole a look at Harry and he shrugged. “A prize that would keep the Weasley family from ever being poor again! And with all the galleons, we’d have loads of incentive to start our-my shop.” George said, choking. “But that still doesn’t explain how you found about it.” Harry said. “And why you refused Iota Mu Xi’s money.” Draco added on.
“So, mate, how’s you know, that?” He motioned to Draco as if he wasn’t there. They both turned to look at him, and Draco mustered his biggest glare to let Harry know that this was not happening again. He seemed to get the picture, as he turned back to Ron. “We’re fine. So, have you let Hermione know about your interest in Shop?” Oh, a secret career choice? How would the newspapers fare, Draco mused? “I let her know before we came. George is fine with it, as fine as he can be, though…” A silence flooded the room and Draco thought he might choke on the awkwardness. Harry seemed to be comforting the Weasel with his eyes, but he didn’t seem to be noticing, scuffing the floor with his foot.
“I… I can’t be here right now.” She schooled her expression into nonchalance and ran in the other direction. “Ginny- “Harry shouted. Draco glared at him. “Run after her and I’ll kill you.” Harry made a weak smile. “You know I have to talk to her.” Harry said knowingly. Draco sighed. The bastard always had to be heroic. “Fine. But not without me.”
Harry Potter." Neville said with faked grandeur. Dean and Seamus immediately abandoned Neville's arms in order to shake Harry's hand. Harry was then stuck in the middle of a circle like Draco was back at the ball. "Are they your friends?" Harry asked Neville, as the two preened.
Harry shuffled back and forth through the crowd, biting his fingernail nervously. He really had to stop, it was becoming a tick in the last half of month. In the course since that dreadful day when Harry really bared it all (he still wanted to puke whenever he thought about it). He had helped Draco start this fraternity thing, while at the same time juggling classes. At least Sunday was recreational day, but it wasn’t being recreational right now, as he was currently waiting on Draco to hand out all the fliers.
It surprised no one when we were officially partnered in our first years in the corps. For nearly two years, we worked cases side by side. We arrested dark wizards and suffered the drudgery of bureaucracy. We ate together, teased one another about dates, friends and media stories. And we probably would have continued like that, but then—
The nights passed in a blur of nightmares, and not just Alex's, which understandably continued with cries for his parents who would never come. Draco spent the first few nights handling those while Harry continued to recover, but when Draco woke on the fourth night and found the other side of his bed vacant, he crept down the hallway to find Harry in the old rocking chair they'd moved into Alex's room, holding the child and singing softly.
"Dudley," Harry said, his voice controlled and calm as he took Dudley's hand in his. "It's been a long time."
Draco closed his eyes, running through his plans. The holidays were coming up anyway. He rarely got much work done then anyway. And he could cancel the conference in January, which would free up even more of his time. He opened his eyes and nodded. "I can handle that. Are they letting you go back to work?"
Draco squeezed, hoping he'd reassure him. "Take some time with it, but not everyone is Harry. You've had your mind set on this for a long time, but there are other paths out there."
Draco looked so excited at the idea that Harry couldn't bring himself to disappoint his friend. Besides, the idea of finding a bloke to flirt with did sound intriguing. "Fine, we'll go Saturday night, but I'm not going to get off in the loo with some stranger."
"Nothing happened," she said, truthfully. When he raised an eyebrow, she rolled her eyes. "Seriously, it's nothing."
Harry quietly began to rub Draco's back, something that always calmed him. "Shh…you'll wake Draco," Harry said, chuckling.
"Yeah, okay," he said, walking over to the sleeping child and brushing his hand over the boy's forehead. "Alex," he said, squatting down next to him.
Harry looked at the bowls of crisps between them, trying to see them from Draco's point of view. His friends had been selecting various foods over the previous weeks to find things Harry had never tried before. He'd learned that he loved most kinds of pasta, really didn't enjoy crab — much to Draco's annoyance — and absolutely
Harry's breathing was rapid and his eyes glassy. He looked on the verge of a panic attack. The best thing to do was probably to get the call over so Draco could find Harry a Calming Draught, and then perhaps they could talk. But first, Dudley.
From there, everything seemed to move at the speed of light. The memory was examined and entered into evidence. The curse appeared to be something the Healers had never heard of, some Spanish invention, but the memory of the casting allowed them to study the wand movements and incantation, and they went to work. Hermione called in favours from the Department of Mysteries, and it was only a matter of hours until the Unspeakables and Healers developed a counter-curse.
Harry shrugged. "No, but I'm talking with McGonagall next week. She's going to help me come up with some ideas, things she thinks I'll be good at that I might not have considered." He hesitated, remembering their conversation, and his stomach warmed. "She says she's proud of me for speaking up and making a change."
As Molly predicted, "normal" over the next few days could practically be tracked by the noise level of the house at any given moment. It reminded Draco of the ebb and flow of waves on a beach. When the children were silent, things seemed eerie, as though the entire household was waiting on tenterhooks for another bomb to fall. When the children were noisy, there was laughing, crying, arguing, and the general noise of kids being kids.
The room was dark, the only light filtering in through the drapes hanging over the floor-to-ceiling windows. Alex stood at the threshold, watching his sister run over to the windows and pulling back the heavy fabric.
Draco had been right that just dumping some money into it from the Potter vaults wouldn't help, that they needed long-term solutions, but the money would certainly make it easier to put those long-term solutions into place. Draco only had to be willing to allow Harry to help.
And today, Draco would see. Draco would know. And Harry couldn't do anything about it, because there was literally no chance he could get through today without Draco at his side.
This time it was Hermione who reached out and put her hand on his. "Good. I need to update Helen, but I came here first. What should I tell her?"
She stopped and raised an eyebrow, giving him the same look she gave Lyra when she was amused at some antic. "Why don't you go put him down for a nap and take one yourself. I'll have Lyra help me finish dinner down here, and then I have an activity for her to work on. It'll keep her busy while you boys rest."
But, evidently, they were teaching it at Hogwarts now. And Lyra learned it all from a professor, reading it in her textbook, discussing it with her class.
Draco's eyes drifted to Teddy then back to Charlotte. They were good kids. "Me too. Thanks, Charlotte."
Alex squeezed Lyra's hand tighter, but she just narrowed her eyes and gave the Healer the glare she'd learned from Draco. It was generally quite effective, but with Harry's green eyes and her light-blonde curls, it was almost scary.
Harry shook his head and dropped his face into his palms, and Draco left him to think. If Harry wasn't going to talk to her tonight, he had a good idea who could.
"How about I leave it open just a little?" Draco suggested. When he got no response, he stepped into the hallway and left the door open several inches. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath and leaned back against the wall.
"Alex is kind of scared right now, so he's going to stay with your Daddy. I'll make sure you get to say goodbye before he goes, though, okay?"
Draco watched his daughter pull him into the kitchen where Hermione was waiting with the boy, then she wrapped her arm around Alex's shoulder and started talking about the family.
Draco wanted to rage, wanted to pull out his wand and burn this little cupboard, burn this entire fucking house. He wanted to curse this man who'd just admitted to hurting the man Draco loved when he was only a small child.
, was still in the next room. I imagined he was waiting for me to come and tell him a story about Amil, the Boy Pirate, who changes his looks at will, sailing the seven seas doing good deeds under the guise of piracy.
Hermione turned to look at the little boy who was now sitting on the other woman's lap, asleep. Her voice turned quiet and maternal. "Little Alex, there, is our witness to the uncle's attack on the family. He's traumatised, and we're having to be very careful with how we ask questions, but he's answering how he can. Children are unreliable witnesses in court, but they still see and hear things that can help."
He sat up, barely noticing Draco's concerned look as he moved out of the way. "Wait, what? Say that again?"
"So, it's your night, Zee. Papa's making your favourite spaghetti, and we have ice cream. What do you want to do until dinner, though? Watch a movie? Play a game?"
"Right," Draco said, his voice dry. "Yes, the boy helped. His name is Alex. He gave us his memory of what happened so they could see the spell and come up with a counter-curse." Draco considered it, and the gratitude he felt towards the child flooded his stomach. "Without him, I'm not sure they would have been able to do it in time."
Draco's eyes filled with tears. He couldn't help it; he loved her so much, and he was so scared. "Not really, baby, but I will be."
His solemn tone halted me from hitting the button on the remote. "It's just a story I made up for my godson," I insisted.
angry at everything she'd put him through, but someplace in his chest, she was still the woman he'd tried to impress as a small child, the woman he'd given a flower to on Mother's Day. He'd wanted more than anything to earn her love and approval, and though he'd never been able, that desire was a part of him and his memories, and now a part of him grieved the loss of the chance to ever make it happen.
"Draco," Hermione said quietly. "The curse that hit Harry… Going by what Alex told us, Harry had already sent Teddy to St Mungo's, but Alex saw it and heard it. He's three, so obviously he can't tell us more, but…"
"Not yet," Harry said, pulling him towards the door. "Let's wait until we've both had some rest, yeah? I don't think either of us are in the right state of mind."
"Oh." Alex couldn't help himself, his fingers giving in to the itch to trace the lines of the long branches that swirled across the trapestry, ending in the faces of people he didn't know. He tried to read the names of the people he could see. "Who is Reg… Regu…" He couldn't pronounce the name, and he gave up helplessly.
"Teddy! I can't wait to tell him all about it." She jumped up and ran to get her coat. "Can we go now so you can talk to Alex? Please?"
Harry froze, his belt undone and his hands on his waistband. "Business?" His eyes narrowed as his Auror mind connected the dots. "Alex?"
"Whatever I want. At the moment, I mostly want to piss him off, but I'm sure I'll come up with something better later. And I want to be myself. I don't want to hold myself back anymore, to worry about people's blood status or political clout before I decide to be their friend. I want to just
She nodded. "They found him about twenty minutes ago, evidently. It's nearly six in the morning now. Why don't you try to get some more sleep."
"Wow," Harry said, imagining the scene, Draco storming dramatically from the room as Lucius ordered him away from his childhood home. He replayed Draco's words in his head. "Wait, is there? Such a thing as a gay bonding spell?"
"Sleep, darling. I'll wake you when we hear anything." Her hands brushed through his hair, and he drifted off.
When I went off to Hogwarts, I'd begun to hope for something more, something different. And while it was indeed different, the darkness of my teenage years was haunting in a way that even my younger self could never have imagined. Later, I'd found my hope for the future in Teddy, and I'd wrapped myself in that entirely so when he'd gone off to school, his absence was filled by the darkness I'd always had chomping at the edges.
insanity, now that he thought about it. What else would convince Potter to bring him lunch to the office, leftover roast beef on thick, freshly-baked bread? And that was just the first day. The second, Potter's house-elf beat him to it, and a basket of fresh cheeses and fruits appeared on Draco's desk. The old elf barely had time for a bow before he popped away, leaving Draco speechless.
The song continued, and Draco flounced across the stage, singing at the top of his lungs, putting such feeling into each lyric. The entire pub was cheering and singing along, and Harry's chest grew with pride. Pride for his friend, pride for the decisions his friend had helped him make, pride for the next steps Harry had just decided to embark upon.
"Harry," he managed to get out, trying to explain to whomever it was holding him that they needed to worry about Harry, not about him. He was fine, even if a voice in his head told him he wasn't.
Draco cleared his throat and glanced at Harry, and when he spoke, his voice was solemn and formal. "Yes, hello. I'm Draco. It's good to meet you, Dudley. I'm just sorry it's under these circumstances."
He sighed. "Right." He took another bite of his leftover pasta and decided to move on to safer subjects. "So, what did she want to know about the war?"
life truly began. It's when I decided to stop living my life for other people, to figure out what it was I wanted. It was the day I chose to take ownership of my future. It was the day I dared to hope again.
Since my early childhood, I've had problems with this. I'd learned at a very young age that hoping for something would only leave you disappointed. My relatives would take advantage of this and promise me treats or privileges, then take them away from me for ridiculous reasons. So, I'd learned not to trust it.
"Listen, you're going to be here with us for a little while. I want you to feel comfortable. This is going to be your room while you're here, but if you want to sleep somewhere else, especially now when it's still scary, you can do that."
His other close friends knew, even if Ron seemed confused by the idea from time to time, but Harry wasn't ready to tell the world — just like he wasn't ready to tell everyone he wasn't going to join the Aurors, that he was going to let them all down, that he wouldn't meet their expectations.
Draco was quiet for a minute, but when he spoke, his voice was soft. "What's your favourite flavour of ice cream?"
Harry turned, a flirty smile already prepared for The Man with the Amazing Arse, and then he froze, stunned.
Teddy had long outgrown his pirate phase by the time he'd left for Hogwarts, but I still had deadlines for promised stories, even if my muse was gone and he was now much older than the boy pirate that brought hope to the wider world. Despite his age, Teddy still brought hope to me.
"Mum had it in her planner." It was Dudley, all right. Harry could tell now, though it'd been nearly three years since they'd spoken. Harry had gone to Mrs Figgs' to help her move, and Dudley had shown up. The conversation between them had been awkward, but not terrible. But they hadn't exchanged numbers or anything, and the idea that Petunia had Harry's number was a little…disconcerting.
Checking on Teddy, indeed. "Yes, well, he clearly still has all his teeth, so I suppose you did a good job of it. Do you mind if I talk with him for a bit?"
"It's a Malfoy problem, Potter. Not a grandmother problem, or a mother-in-law problem, or an auntie problem. The manor is in debt, and it's my responsibility to figure it out. It has nothing to do with you, and I refuse to let you use the Potter vaults to bail it out. It's not. Your. Problem."
The small group had dissipated by the time Draco reached the threshold of Harry's hospital room, and they could hear Lyra's chatter from inside mixed with Harry's low tones. Alex relaxed slightly, allowing Draco to hold him a little closer.
Harry grabbed Draco's wand from where it lay on the cushion and cast a lubrication spell, coating his hand liberally before grasping both of them together and moving.
"I have a very good memory." She ruffled Alex's hair. "But not as good as Alex's. I can't save people with my memory."
"Yeah, now," he said, but his voice was pleading. "Maybe we can drive around a little while before we go to the house. I'll text Dudley and tell him where we went."
"Yes," Draco agreed from the bathroom as he picked up another flannel and wet it. He gathered a towel and a comb and made his way back to Harry's bed, sitting on the edge and finally looking at his scowling husband.
"Do you think…" Harry trailed off, sounding more hesitant than Draco hardly ever heard him anymore. Harry was confident in his adulthood. This wasn't like him.
But it did. In the end, it did, and the danger was passing. The Stasis Charm was lifted, and Harry was going to recover.
He started laughing, which was exactly the reaction she was hoping for. "They can be pretty awesome, too."
"Lyra!" Dad called, and she saw Pa roll his eyes. He hated it when Dad shouted like that, and usually, their antics made her smile, but now they grated on her nerves because everyone was watching. She could feel their eyes on her and her family, just like her classmates' had been.
Alex did as he was told, but his thumb found its way into his mouth again, and he used his free hand to hold onto Lyra tightly.
Draco stared for a moment before raising a single, well-manicured eyebrow. "Is this just another test, Harry?" Draco asked, his voice challenging.
"Evidently they studied it in more detail after the Memorial in May." Hermione froze, her eyes widening. "Harry—"
— Harry knew. He knew too well what Draco fought against and still came out the other side. And Harry wanted it too.
Malfoy cleared his throat after several seconds. "Potter. Good to see you," he said formally. "How can I help you?"
The child was about three or four years old, with loose, dark brown curls falling across his forehead and over his ears. His skin was golden, perhaps of Mediterannean heritage, and though his small cheeks were streaked with remnants of tears, he was silent.
So, most of the angst is passed, but there will still be a few bumps as we close in on the end of the story. I hope it's not been too heavy for you all. Do you like the angstier turn of this story amidst all the fluff of the others?
Her eyes met Dad's green ones and she froze, nervous to be around him for the first time ever. He was just her dad, the same guy who sang her to sleep when she was little; who read her stories about elephants and The Three Brothers when she was smaller; who geeked out over Lord of the Rings with her when they read it together the previous summer.
Ron snorted and brushed Draco's hand out of his hair where it was playing with the curls at the nape of Ron's neck. "Worse, I imagine. I was harassing Hermione for answers while Harry worked on his by himself. And stop that. You'll make her jealous."
Lyra scrunched up her brows, clearly thinking that through. "Okay, but why does that make Alex poor? He's too little to be a bad guy."
"What's this?" It looked like a cupboard about four feet in height, but there were locks near the top of the door.
"Alex," Hermione said quietly. "You remember Helen, right?" She gestured to the woman who knelt in front of them. "Remember how she took care of you when they found you with Harry?"
"So I'm always told," I said, and the snarl in my voice irritated me even more. "Just, give me a few days. Please."
He just wasn't sure how choosing music would do the same, but Draco insisted. He had Hermione and Theo helping this time, Muggle CDs and wizarding records scattered around the room on a Friday night, two weeks later.
She nodded, and Draco was impressed when she kept her voice low. It was easy to forget that she knew how to do that, since her default volume was generally loud. "He won't talk to nobody, though. Just me. Grandma Molly says it's because he had something real bad happen and grownups probably scare him."
article, and Harry was finally reaching his limit. It was the middle of February and the stories still came nearly every day. Speculations now were that he and Ginny had split — finally, at least they got something correct — and that he was cosied up with Susan Bones — obviously, incorrect. A Potter-Bones wedding was projected to be the event of the coming decade, and while Susan had laughed it off, Harry just felt it as one more brick laid upon his back.
She shot him a look that would have looked at home on the face of any twelve-year-old, making sure he knew his warning wasn't necessary, before taking Hermione's hand. "I'll see you after we Floo, Alex," she said to the boy as Draco scooped him up. "Don't worry."
They're not the same as his Mamá and Papá were, of course. Alex doesn't really remember them much, his Mamá and Papá, except sometimes in dreams, but he feels like he remembers them because of all the pictures he has. Daddy and Papa gave him books of pictures, and they talked to Mamá and Papá's friends and got lots of stories about them. They put them in the book so that he can go look at them whenever he wants, and when he's bigger, he'll be able to read the stories all by himself.
"Yes, well, it did give me something to use to make that Patronus work. Anyway, that was in August. I don't think he believed me though, because he kept sending me letters all last term about Astoria Greengrass, my so-called betrothed, and didn't seem to be getting the message. I realised the only way to get him off my back was to come out to him over the holidays."
They'd spent the last six weeks of school, ever since the 2nd of May celebrations, learning about the first and second wizarding wars in class. Weeks of hearing her family's names at the core of her History of Magic lessons, weeks of her classmates staring, whispering, asking questions that she had no answers for.
I don't generally post a story until I'm done writing, but I really wanted to get this one out there. I am about 2/3 of the way done with the first draft, and I'll be posting updates twice a week (Mondays and Fridays). I expect it'll probably be around 8 chapters in total, as I'm currently in the middle of chapter 5, but that may change as I approach the end. I hope you enjoy it!
Harry's eyes flashed and his face hardened. "Gods, Draco, I love you, but you're so fucking egotistical sometimes." He plucked the wine glass out of Draco's hand and set it next to his own on the coffee table, then he moved closer to Draco, his eyes solemn. "I was in the field because I could see Teddy was questioning whether or not he wanted to be an Auror, and I wanted to give him a taste of the bureaucracy involved in a simple case of Accidental Magic. I thought it was an easy little case to show him the piles of paperwork he'd have. It had nothing to do with our fight."
"Does that mean we can actually do what our friends will imagine we're doing anyway?" Harry asked with a rough voice, slipping his hands around Draco's waist while capturing an earlobe between his teeth. "Because I can think of some things I'd like to do in our new flat."
Charlotte's face turned fully red, and Draco was satisfied. If the kids were going to snog in public places, even if Teddy
Hermione was right. Draco made him happy. How could he not? This pure-blood idiot who'd bucked off the yoke of his parents' expectations, who'd told them all to fuck off, that he'd be who he wanted to be despite his upbringing.
Draco had no idea how long he'd sat there, staring, but the light coming through the window was dimmer, falling low on the London skyline when the door opened. He'd ignored the same door multiple other times throughout the day, Mediwitches, Healers, Aurors coming in and leaving, none of them disturbing him.
That was the day I began to understand the fickleness of hope, and it was the day I understood that there was a much larger world around me that I had never accounted for.
Still, Draco's eyes widened, and he sputtered, "Yes, but mine tossed me out of the house on Christmas because I dared to tell them I like men."
So he drank, but in the process, he realised his hand was shaking and he managed to spill the tepid tea on his shirt. He couldn't bring himself to care.
She smiled at Draco, her lips tight, and pausing by him, she whispered, "Keep your wand handy, boy. Marge is coming."
"In this case, that's exactly what it means. Glad you're catching on," Draco said with a condescending smile. It really
"Respect?" Harry swung around and glared. "It doesn't feel like respect. It feels like you don't give a damn how I feel."
weren't okay, were they? They'd fought, and then Harry had gone out into the field instead of coming home and he'd almost died, and Draco hadn't known, he
Curious, Harry stepped closer to the doorway where he'd heard the voice emanate. A young man's backside was to him — and a gorgeous backside it was. His slim build was covered with a cool, blue shirt that pulled across what appeared to be a strong back and muscular shoulders. His arse, though, was where the man excelled. It was housed in a pair of trousers that should have been illegal, the way they outlined each perfectly rounded cheek and hugged the man's thick thighs.
"No, Billywig," he said, his voice quiet and sad. He looked down at the small boy cuddled between him and his daughter. He was so young. "Somebody murdered his mum and dad. That's why he's here with us right now, because they're trying to find the rest of his family so he can go live with them."
Harry chuckled. "Yeah, it is." He sighed. "This really sucks, though. She won't even look me in the eye, and she bit my head off anytime I tried to talk to her tonight. I wish I knew what was going on."
They were both lying on the fluffy carpet, looking up at the glowing, plastic stars on Harry's ceiling. Harry's Live cd was playing on his new music player, and the blue light Draco had conjured had made the room take on a strange glow — Hermione had called it a blacklight when she'd stopped in, but whatever.
"Are you sure the girl should be here? It seems very strange," the specialist said, addressing Draco. The man's bald head reflected the sun streaming through the windows, but Draco did his best not to be distracted from the matter at hand.
"Then what? Because every time I'm just being myself, enjoying myself, you stare at me like you're trying to unravel the secrets of Camelot. And I'm not
to wear his Chudley Cannons shirt, even though it was absolutely filthy and too far gone for a simple Scourgify. Sobs, screams, stomping of feet — most of this Teddy's — had given Harry a raging headache.
Harry got quiet, something that only usually happened when he was at the edge. He walked to the kitchen window and peered out into the barren garden, the November wind kicking around the leaves on the ground.
They changed the subject, and Draco sighed in contentment as their relationship fell back into its normal rhythm. This was good, and Harry would talk eventually. He just wasn't ready yet.
He was afraid to pick it up, afraid to see what might be printed upon it. Hermione entered behind him and cleared her throat.
So Harry took the smaller cupboard, and Draco had the large, walk-in closet with racks for all his shoes and space for the separation of his Muggle and magical wardrobes.
And of course, there are lots of pictures of Alex with his new family. So many pictures. Daddy is always taking more. Papa says it's because Daddy's family didn't take pictures when he was little, so Daddy has to make up for lost time. Papa says weird stuff like that, but it makes Daddy happy, and Alex does like the pictures. He likes looking at how his dark hair kind of matches Daddy's just like Lyra's pale hair matches Papa's. He likes seeing how happy Daddy and Papa are when they're with him.
Draco simply stared, baffled, but he understood. If there was anything that Harry was insecure about, it was people wanting to be his family. "Well, we'll have to ask him, of course."
Harry had his door closed to his studio, so he was working. The red light spilling from beneath the door made it clear he was mid-development of the film, so Draco didn't dare disturb him. Instead, he wandered over to the kitchen, looking for something to make for dinner. Harry generally did the cooking, but Draco wanted to do something nice for his boyfriend.
Draco laughed. "I believe that's good, then." He shook out his hair and leant back on his hands, grinning. "So you're well and truly bent."
"Yes!" Lyra turned back to Draco. "Teddy thinks he's going to try to be a Healer instead of an Auror. He's been talking to the Healers while he's here, and he thinks he'd be good at it." She smiled. "I think he would too. He's always been really good at fixing me when I get hurt."
A young woman took Dudley's arm. She looked sweet, her dark hair cascading over her pale shoulders and her dark blue dress falling to her knees. "Harry, Draco, this is Susanne. Susanne, this is my cousin Harry I've told you about, and his boyfriend, Draco."
"Oh, Potter, you should see yourself," Draco said after a moment, wiping the tears from his eyes. "Don't worry, his virtue is safe from me. Or perhaps you're worried about your own?" Draco winked, and Harry's face began to burn.
Alex's eyes seemed to be staring into the distance, unfocused. "Alex," Draco said quietly. "Buddy, do you need me to carry you?"
Potter. Who'd have thought that he'd partner well with Harry Potter? But they did, and hours spent together—every day, in fact—brought them closer to being friends instead of driving them both to insanity.
Harry reached past Draco to grab a sandwich. "He'll be fine," he said, ripping into his own sandwich. "Thanks, Gin."
He was starting to put the pieces together, and he didn't like the conclusion. "Hermione," he said, putting his hand on hers, seeing where her mind was going.
“Oh, Harry”, Hermione said in an exasperated tone. “What about all the things you’ve said about Malfoy? Was it all to cover up this?” She waved a hand around frantically.
Harry set off further into the maze. He could hear Ron and Hermione’s footsteps, softer and softer as their paths lead them in different directions. He quickened his pace, his eyes scanning the piles for familiar objects. He was running, his breath loud in his ears. Deeper and deeper. He couldn’t hear Ron and Hermione anymore; they must’ve gotten too far apart. And then there it was, right in front of him. A diadem on top of a bust of an old man with a wig on his head. He stretched out his hand, only a few more steps and then…
Harry thought and flicked his wand, but Draco parried. Suddenly he heard screaming and Myrtle came bursting out of a toilet stall, yelling at them to stop. A trash can exploded right by Harry, and when Harry retorted and missed, a toilet bowl was shattered, causing Myrtle to cry even louder. Water spurted out in jets, adding to the confusion.
To be fair, there’s actually a promise they have kept till now. A promise which sometimes, feels like a curse.
Little Ashley, well, let’s just call him J for short (it sounded cooler too!), was left alone in the empty house after his step mother and step siblings’ departure. He was very sad. But then, his Fairy Godmother appeared and gave him an even cooler dress robe. She even gave him a very cool motorbike for him to ride to the party. So, J went to the party. With his handsomeness which even when his face was covered in ashes still shone through, he quickly won the Princess's heart. J then married the Princess and became the candidate for the position of the next King. His step brothers were so jealous of him that they died from the shock of J's marriage.
The girl couldn’t stand the horrible curtains Harry chose so she had gone and bought them so that she wouldn’t “have to witness a couple falling apart because apparently, one of them has no taste in choosing curtains”. Harry had pouted at that comment but he was actually amused. He even promised Draco a night of making love behind those curtains as a “punishment” for nodding at Pansy’s comment.
Hermione’s books collection had fallen victim to the fireplace one night. The matching cups with hilarious emoji printed on Ron gave them aren't matching anyone, what with one lost its handle while the other shattered into pieces in the trash bin. The weird statue made by Luna lost its head long ago. The radio, surprisingly, given to them by Theo could only play a broken melody now, no matter which channel you turn into.
The game console Seamus and Dean had bought them just so they could play whenever they visited was broken. An ashtray had collided with it. Everyone had had so much fun playing video games with it, even Pansy and Hermione had played. The girls turned out to be pretty good at it. Draco still hasn’t gotten even with Dean for their last game together yet.
Harry's words are so sweet. Draco wishes he could believe in them. It won't be fine. He knows that. Harry knows that.
” James groaned. He was quickly losing his calm in this hot weather, not that he had much from the start, so he didn’t want to have to deal with his stepfather's questions. Especially when he often lost in a debate against him. James was simply not very keen on losing.
that no one could remember why he even had somethings against them. He’s tempted to point out how childish it was but scared of more punishments. Although Draco rarely gave them any punishments, his punishments were always more troublesome than Harry’s.
It seemed James’ painful cry had intrigued his siblings. Three heads appeared behind the opened door which led to the backyard. Albus, Scorpius and Lily were looking at Draco and James curiously, a bowl of popcorn was firmly in Lily’s arms.
Draco had thought it was a good thing. Even though they fight as often as they make love, they had thought it was perfect for them. It means their flame for each other would never burn out. It means they are special to each other.
James murmured after a silent moment. His head still hung down though. But just that was enough for Draco’s hope to start rising.
James groaned in horror. It’s as good as saying he would certainly tell her. They would make fun of him for the rest of his life.
One day, a messenger from the castle came to his house with invitations to the Princess’s birthday party. That year, his kingdom's only princess would be coming of age, so the King decided to hold a party to choose a partner for her. Every gentleman in the kingdom was invited to the party, and whom the Princess fancied shall become her husband. His step brothers were excited, anyone who held the Princess’s interest could become the next King, who wouldn’t be excited? Even his step sister was, despite the fact that she wasn't even a boy! Ashley, or mysterious little J, wanted to come to the party too but his cruel step mother and step siblings prevented him from coming by forcing him to do more houseworks and tearing off his dress robe.
“I’m leaving”, said Draco, simply, while standing in front of the entrance with his suitcase on hand.
“You can’t!”, yelled Harry. He looked like he’s gonna go insane at any moment with bloodshot eyes and disheveled clothes.
And those dungbombs James threw at them were pretty nasty. It took Albus and Scorpius the entire morning just to get the smell off. Must be new products of Weasley’s Wheezes. George Weasley should stop giving his nephew those things if he didn’t want to see more of his family crying and screaming.
Harry didn’t see Draco out of class after that. He stowed the coin Draco had given him at the bottom of his trunk to avoid temptation. It was unnecessary, however, because Draco didn’t try to contact him. Occasionally, Harry would sneak the coin out and turn it over, but nothing had changed. It was for the better, he thought. Draco had been right when he’d said that Harry, out of all people, shouldn’t be running around with the son of a known Death Eater. Harry had let his own physical desire get in the way of everything he was working for, let it get in the way of defeating Voldemort. Draco was on the other side of this and that made him the enemy. Harry had to remember that. He became even more convinced of this as he took up his old habit of checking the Marauder’s map regularly again, and saw that Malfoy was missing more often than not.
Harry’s heart sank. By the tone of Draco’s voice, Harry was certain it was someone fighting on the Order’s side. For a painful moment he saw Ron and Hermione’s unmoving bodies lying on the stone floor before pushing the image out of his head. He could hear the once distant sounds of fighting growing closer.
“Hey, lay off, Ron’s not stupid”, Harry said, feeling he had to defend his best friend. “If anyone has the right to spread nasty rumors about you, it’s him and Hermione.”
Next time had to wait, however. When Harry got back very late that night, he found Ron waiting for him in the otherwise empty common room.
“I’m not killing him! But if I get the chance, I will. What does it matter, when the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway?”
He was torn from his thoughts when the door opened, and Ron entered the room. Harry quickly hid the map underneath his pillow.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. At least Draco was alive then, he thought, and tried not to dwell on the fact that Draco probably had been torturing Harry’s friends while Harry had been wondering if he was dead.
Harry turned to Draco, who was staring down at Dobby’s dubious outfit. “Don’t you have something to say?”
“So, for today’s class you are going to attempt to make Amortentia in pairs. It’s a tricky potion to master, so be aware that your first attempt might not be successful. Just like the infatuation it tries to mimic, it’s fickle and one simple mistake might ruin it. The ingredients need to be added in the right order, to the right amount, and at the right pace. Alright then, I trust you can manage to pair up yourselves.”
Harry chuckled but did as he was told. He then turned to Draco and began pulling at his trousers as Draco lay down on his back and lifted his hips to help. Soon, they were both naked.
This fic alters certain bits of the Half-Blood Prince. The parts not mentioned should be read as being the same.
“Where you go, we go”, Ron said and there was such finality in his voice that Harry swallowed his protests.
“It better be a good apology”, Harry warned as he tickled the pear that would let them into the kitchens.
“What then? Why would you possibly hope I’d come down here if it wasn’t for some petty revenge scheme?” Harry squeezed Draco’s arm harder.
“I’ve been distracted”, he said so quietly it was almost inaudible. Then he looked over at Harry. “If that’s what you want, then go. I won’t chase after you again.”
Relief was written across her face. She let out a gleeful whoop and forcibly kicked the goblin in the face, making him skid towards the middle of the room where he remained motionless.
“My family”, he said carefully. “Is very concerned with the continuation of our bloodline. As long as I still produce an heir with a pure-blood, I don’t think they’d care.”
Draco’s free hand was caressing the inside of Harry’s thigh, pushing a leg up before adding another finger. Wave’s of pleasure washed over Harry with every push and pull.
They were herded further into Malfoy Manor, to the drawing room. The grand room had dark red walls clad with portraits Harry had to assume were previous generations of Malfoy’s, based on their blonde hair and the air of distaste they all emitted as the prisoners were led through their halls. Harry’s eyes were swollen, but he could see well enough to take in the grandeur of the place. The fireplace was bristling with yellow flames that lighted up the giant chandelier that hung from the ceiling, the crystal casting specks of light across the room. Lucius Malfoy’s drawling voice reached Harry’s ears and he went cold. How they would get out of there alive, before any of the Death Eaters managed to summon Voldemort, he could scarcely imagine.
In the moment, Harry didn’t care that they didn’t do this. He didn’t care that Draco hadn’t so much as brushed against him after they’d finished, not since that day in the Slytherin dungeon. It was as if a door to another realm of emotion, one that wasn’t all lust and craving, had opened before him. Draco seemed to sense it too; when Harry pulled away, the expression on Draco’s face was one of absolute horror. He shoved Harry aside, not too roughly, and sat up at the edge of the bed.
“Yes”, Draco said. “I keep an eye on Crabbe and Goyle and the rest of the Slytherin’s, and the Carrows too. Although that has become increasingly difficult. Let’s just say that neither my father nor I have the Dark Lord’s favor at the moment.”
Harry did as he was told. He sat on the floor, staring at his bloody hands until his vision was clouded by tears.
She didn’t bring Malfoy up either, although he thought it was to spare him. Her eyes were always on Harry when they had classes with the Slytherins and curiosity practically oozed from her. She’d cast sidelong glances at Harry and raise her eyebrows knowingly whenever he as much as breathed in Malfoy’s direction. At the end of those classes, she’d grab Harry and Ron by the arms and drag them out together.
Harry didn’t know what to say. In hindsight, it seemed like the obvious course of action. He hadn’t been thinking then either, just acting on his instincts that told him to kiss back. Then of course, there had been the second time, and the third, and the fourth, and so on, and he’d deliberately gone back. Perhaps it was the sixth year stress that had finally worn him down, or, he had to entertain the possibility, he’d done it because he wanted to, and he hadn’t cared to think too hard about the consequences.
Harry knew all too well. He and Ron had been chatting about Quidditch when Lavender had come over to sit on Ron’s lap and kiss his neck in a way that made Harry – and anyone else that had to witness it – feel like he was watching the start of a pornographic film.
, he’d gone back to checking the Marauder’s map almost as diligently as he had before. Draco only seemed to go to the same two places now: the Slytherin common room and Myrtle’s bathroom. The only thing that kept him from dwelling on this all hours of the day was the staggering amount of work they were assigned each week.
Draco’s wand was pointing at Dumbledore, but his hand was shaking. He glanced around again, as if he expected someone to jump out from the shadows. Harry fought against his invisible constraints, but it was of no use. Dumbledore smiled.
Draco nodded, seemingly unfaced. Then he glanced back over his shoulder. “Whoever gets here first next time must think very hard of a room with clean sheets.”
Draco lay on his back with his legs resting against Harry’s shoulders. Slowly, Harry guided his lotion covered cock up against Draco’s hole.
His face was red and sweaty, his blonde hair a ruffled mess. Harry grabbed it, but then proceeded to push Draco further down into the pillows.
“You know my family, you overheard Snape, you’ve seen what they’ve done to me. You’re not as stupid as you look, Potter. You know why.” He sounded as desperate, as if he was pleading in front of the entire Wizengamot.
The next time they saw each other was only a couple of days later. Harry felt the coin heat up in his pocket during dinner and when he looked at it the word
“Gather around, class, gather around”, Slughorn ushered as the class spilled into the room, waving them towards the cauldron. As they formed a circle around it, Slughorn continued. “Now, does anyone of you know what this is? Miss Granger?”
The possibility that Hermione really was dating McLaggen had been up for discussion on more than one occasion during their stay at the Burrow.
Draco stumbled backwards, clutching at his chest. Then, his knees gave in and he fell onto his back. Blood spurted from his chest, turning the water on the floor scarlet in an instant. It looked like he’d been slashed with a sword.
“Oh you know, blood and torture. I spent the better part of Easter break hanging upside down from the ceiling”, Draco said.
Fred groaned and blinked up at them and then proceeded to nudge Draco, who promptly shifted over to the side. Ron let out a laugh in relief and squeezed Hermione’s hand as Fred managed to sit up.
Malfoy had grabbed onto Crabbe’s leg to stop him from sending another curse at Harry, and Crabbe stumbling to shake Malfoy loose was what saved him from being hit by Hermione’s petrification spell, which passed only an inch to his left. Hermione emerged from around the corner, calling out Harry’s name and aiming spells at their assailants. Malfoy rolled out of the way, but Crabbe turned towards her.
Dumbledore assured him he mustn’t do anything at all, but Draco only scoffed. He continued, talking about the help he’d had from Snape and how he’d used the Imperius curse on Rosmerta. Harry felt a stab of
With that, Draco stood and pulled Harry up with him. The chairs disappeared, and the bed appeared once more. Draco pushed Harry down onto it none too gently. Harry couldn’t shake the feeling he was being used. As Draco lowered himself onto Harry’s cock, riding him fast and hard, he couldn’t help but think that if this was how Draco wanted to use him, he was fine with that.
Hermione seemed equally keen and swallowed what she’d been about to say without looking too disgruntled about it. Only Harry was still displeased. He snuck out the Marauder’s Map underneath the table under the pretense of going through some notes and finally saw him. Malfoy was in Myrtle’s bathroom.
“I gave Slughorn that bottle a long time ago. Months and months ago. You heard Snape, I stopped. I don’t want to be like that anymore, I’ve told – I’ve shown – you that.”
When he’d told them about what had happened, Hermione had immediately started smearing The Prince. Ron had said Malfoy deserved it and almost seemed relieved, like Harry had proven that he’d gone back to hating Malfoy once and for all.
As he burst into the bathroom, he was immediately taken back to the similar events that had led up to his and Malfoy’s first meeting there. He’d rushed off in a similar manner then too, months ago. This time, however, Malfoy wasn’t surprised to see him.
Harry relaxed ever so slightly. Even so, he couldn’t quite shake the feeling of dread that had taken hold of him when he’d thought Fred was dead.
Harry supposed she would believe this, it was close enough to the truth, and what she already thought she knew. Besides, he knew there were few things Hermione appreciated as much as being right.
When he at last managed to get Malfoy on his own, Ron had been out of the hospital wing for days. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were sitting in the library – if one good thing had come out of Ron almost dying it was that he and Hermione wordlessly had made up – catching up on another one of Snape’s lengthy essays. Harry hadn’t been able to keep his suspicions as to whom the culprit might be a secret in his rage, and his friends were once again looking at him like he was insane.
She reached out and touched it with the tip of her forefinger and Harry’s forehead was immediately set ablaze with pain. He had to struggle to remain himself and not wander into Voldemort’s mind.
Harry and Ron snuck up the stairs and back through the dark corridor that led to the drawing room, leaving Wormtail’s body lying on the basement floor. Dean, Luna, and Ollivander had all apparated away with Dobby. They peered in through the open door and saw Bellatrix standing over the goblin, Hermione lying lifeless on the floor at her feet. Lucius was watching with an almost bored expression from his seat by the fire, while Narcissa and Draco had retreated to the other end of the room and stood silent. Greyback was standing as close to Bellatrix as he seemed to dare, his hungry eyes on Hermione.
She looked over at Ron, who whispered to Harry: “I think she might be part basilisk. I swear I lost all sensation in my left leg when she looked at me like that.”
It took them a moment to figure out the best position to resume. At last they found themselves on the floor in much the same way they had before. In an act of chivalry, or something of the like, Harry had taken off his robes and spread them across the floor, so Draco wouldn’t have to lie on the damp clinker. A decision he immediately regretted, as Draco snorted and curtsied and said: “What a gentleman!” in a girly voice that still managed to retain his most contemptuous tone.
Harry forcibly turned back to Bellatrix. Greyback was already starting to stir behind her. She pulled Hermione forward so they were standing underneath the grand chandelier. The knife pricked Hermione’s skin again and fresh blood welled forward and Ron looked like he might lunge at Bellatrix, despite being wandless.
Ron and Hermione both reached for Harry at the same time, but Ron was faster. He grabbed Harry by the sleeve of his robes and pulled him back, almost sending him crashing to the floor. In an instant, everyone else had paired up, all except Hermione and…
They snuck down to the kitchens by hiding underneath the invisibility cloak. It was awkward being pressed so close together, especially since Draco was seething at Harry and refused to reply to Harry’s pointers and kindly suggestions.
Harry didn’t really want to focus on what he was feeling that very moment, so he squeezed her shoulder and said: “I think you’re right, look what a mess it all turned into.”
Kissing on a soft bed certainly was preferable to doing it in a bathroom stall. Harry placed eager kisses down Draco’s neck and after spinning them around, so Draco was on the bottom, Harry went straight for his trousers.
Harry looked up and saw the door open for just a few seconds to let a figure in. Draco’s skin was pulled taunt over his already sharp features. His hair was unkempt, hanging into his eyes instead of being neatly swept back as it usually was. A deep gash ran across his cheek and thin lines, much like the scars on his back, crept up his neck. He was skin and bones and looked is if a gust of wind might send him toppling over. Even though he looked weak, he strode in with purpose. His eyes, at least, looked alive.
When he looked back to Hermione, he saw she wasn’t paying attention to him anymore. Ron, Lavender and Parvati were heading their way and a foxlike smile had crept onto Hermione’s face.
“Harry”, Draco said slowly, taking a step closer. Harry jerked at the use of his first name – until now it had been reserved for the most intense moments of passion.
The Snatchers turned the band of bound-together prisoners around, so Hermione would come into better view, making them stumble and shuffle to stay on their feet.
It felt like he was falling again. Without care for his aching body and bleeding head, Harry rushed forwards and dropped to his knees beside Ron and Percy. Draco was lying partially on top of Fred with a large wooden splinter sticking out of his leg, but otherwise seemingly uninjured. Fred was lying underneath, still with the hint of a smile on his face. His eyes were closed, and his red hair matted by dust.
At this, Ron did look embarrassed and mumbled a “sorry” underneath his breath. Shortly after, he excused himself and when he left he refused to look Harry in the eye.
He slipped out the door after listening for footsteps and hurried down into the Slytherin common room, which was starting to fill up with students again. When someone came through the secret passage in the wall, Harry slipped past them. Well out in the corridor, he sank down to the floor and waited.
“Shit, I’ll come at this rate”, Harry finally admitted as the sensation building up deep within his stomach became too much to ignore.
Harry shook his head and closed the distance between them. Perhaps he’d intended to say something, but last time had left him unsatisfied and wanting. It wouldn’t be too bad, he thought as Draco pulled him in gently, grabbing his tie and leaning in to press his mouth against Harry’s, to enjoy this first and say what he needed to say later. Harry kissed back eagerly, his hand already rubbing against Draco, going for his zipper.
“Oh, I don’t think so, Draco”, Dumbledore said softly, slipping further down the wall he was leaning against. Harry wondered if Draco realized just how weak Dumbledore was. “You’ve had a long time to kill me, yet you haven’t done it.”
Harry sank down on the chair next to Draco’s bed and edged it a bit closer. They sat in silence for a few minutes before Harry whispered:
“Malfoy told me what happened at Malfoy manor”, Neville said in a hushed tone, so only Harry, Ron and Hermione, who followed closely behind, would hear. “But I thought it best not to tell the others. Some aren’t thrilled that Draco’s here, but I try to be more pragmatic.”
“Ron!” Harry screamed, and in the distance, he could hear Hermione call out for them, and then he cried “Finite!” and the wall stabilized.
Harry dropped the chocolate he’d been about to eat back into the box. “But you’ve already eaten half of them!”
birthday came around, Harry had hoped to get some respite from pin-balling between his two friends, thinking that this special occasion might create temporary peace. Instead, the day began with Ron eating the chocolates Harry had been given by Romilda Vane so long ago and ended in the hospital wing with a shaken Hermione and a crying Lavender sprawled across Ron’s hospital bed.
“So, Harry”, Neville said once Ron had wrapped up the story. “What we you looking for? Why are you here? Is it time to throw the Death Eaters out of Hogwarts once and for all?”
Ron, who’d been in a strangely good mood since the fight with Lavender, turned and spoke directly to Hermione. “Yeah, how did you manage that, working with Malfoy and all?”
Ron stood gaping at Draco in wild disbelief. Even Harry had trouble understanding what just had happened, although he supposed Draco didn’t truly understand the significance of what he’d just done.
Instead, Malfoy headed the other way and pulled open the door to an old classroom and slipped inside, gesturing for Harry to follow. The classroom was dark, but Draco sent soft lights up towards the ceiling with a flick of his wand. All the desks had been shoved around the room and the furniture wore a coating of dust, uneven in places, a sign that they were not the first ones to hide in there.
Draco laughed a cold, disdainful, laugh. “Help me? Potter, the only way you could help me is by distracting me from all the outrageous shit that goes on in this rathole. I don’t need or want anything else from you.”
Ron at least had the decency to look ashamed. “Well, we ran into her in Honeydukes and asked if she was going with anyone to Slughorn’s party, but she said she was but that it was none of my business.”
“Oh, that wasn’t me. She likes me, most of the time. Some girl went in there to tease her or something, she’s not exactly the most level headed being in existence, so it was hard to make out the details.”
Sorry for the slow update. I've been a little busy (also I hadn't even started writing this part when I published the last chapter, and that's just me planning poorly).
“Did you give Slughorn that bottle?” Harry rephrased, feeling sick of Malfoy’s games. This time, he’d get a straight answer, if he so had to force one out.
Harry thought finally having proof that Draco was doing something would’ve brought him joy, especially after their most recent falling out. Still he found himself feeling bad for Draco. He didn’t seem to want the assignment he’d been given. It sounded more like it had been forced upon him. Harry remembered the scars on Draco’s back and the terrible magic that must’ve been used to bring about wounds like that. Either way, it seemed like Draco had mostly abandoned whatever his mission was around the time he and Harry had started meeting up after curfew. Perhaps it had been wrong to judge so quickly, Harry thought, and now he knew Snape bore at least part of the blame, the way he’d been pushing Draco to continue.
Bellatrix’ smiled widened. “Good”, she said without releasing Hermione. “Draco, go and get their wands.”
Malfoy gave Harry a cold look and sat up. “Oh, right. I’d forgotten I was talking to Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, Friend of the House Elves – I’ve still not forgotten the way you stole ours, thank you very much. Is there another title you’d like me to add in there or is that enough for you?”
“’Assign to you?’ You’ve been spurting those things since the first time I met you, if you recall. Don’t act like I’m treating you unfairly.”
“Do you think whoever made this room intended it to be used for this?” He asked, gesticulating towards their naked bodies.
Hermione’s hand had shot up before Slughorn had even finished the question. “Amortentia, sir. It’s the most powerful love potion in the world.”
It wasn’t long before Draco came out, glancing around suspiciously before taking off along the hallway. Harry followed as closely as he dared, out of the dungeons and up the stairs to the seventh floor, down the hallway to the left to the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls ballet. Here, Draco halted and after pacing back and forth three times, he disappeared through a door that had magically appeared in the wall. Harry took out the Marauder’s map and stared down at it. He could see himself in the corridor, but neither Draco nor the Room of Requirement were anywhere to be found.
The spells passed each other midair, only inches apart, and both wands went flying out of their owner’s hands. Harry’s went up into the air and landed behind him, while Draco’s flew to the side and rolled underneath the stalls. Harry dove for his wand, and for a moment he thought Draco was doing the same thing, before he realized Draco was trying to tackle him.
Draco kept his promise. It was days before he returned to class, but when he did he didn’t as much as glance in Harry’s direction. Harry had to fight the urge to check Draco’s whereabouts through the Marauder’s map. He figured it would be easier to move on that way. For the first time, their separation felt final, and he couldn’t help feeling gloomy about it. He thought Ron and Hermione noticed; they shot each other worried glances whenever Harry picked at his food or went to bed early, but they never said a word about it. He wanted to tell them that he’d gone to see Malfoy, but he couldn’t bear their renewed disapproval.
Harry hesitated a moment, and then he pulled out the Marauder’s map. He wasn’t sure he truly wanted to show this to Malfoy, but then again, if Malfoy got caught Harry was sure he would be quick to give Harry up if it meant he could save his own fingers.
A flurry of silver, then the heavy pressing weight of apparition that was only made worse by the goblin weighing him down. They appeared again by the seashore. The stars shone bright above them, the air tasted of salt, and Dobby had the hilt of the silver knife protruding from his chest.
Harry was still boiling with rage. “You shouldn’t! He’s helped Malfoy with something, and now they’ve done it and… He was cheering, in the Room of Requirement. He’s succeeded, and he did curse Katie, and Ron…” He was rambling, and he knew that Dumbledore wouldn’t respond well to it. The headmaster had already scolded him for his accusation during their previous meetings. “I know he’s responsible, sir! He told me.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “I’ve been working towards this for the better part of a year, of course I wanted to succeed.”
“It’s a start”, Harry said. “You’ve been a shit for six years and probably before that too, you can’t expect to make up for it all in one night.”
“It’s fine now, you sneaky little twat”, Draco said sourly. “What? You’re acting like I sent you into the jaws of a dragon. You would’ve only missed a day’s worth of classes, at worst.”
Hermione drew a deep breath and looked like she was about to sprint into a series of arguments as to why that was unlikely, but Ron intervened.
came to mind and the phrase that was written underneath it in the Half-Blood Prince’s potions book: for enemies. Still, it felt premature for that, and Malfoy was still unarmed.
Draco didn’t say anything for a long while, and when he finally spoke, he seemed to be talking more to himself than to anyone else.
“There’s still time for you to come around, Draco. So far you haven’t done anything that can’t be undone. You haven’t hurt anyone, although that’s mostly due to sheer luck for your unintended victims.”
“I didn’t mean to”, Harry croaked, but Draco’s eyes were shut tightly, and he gave no indication he could hear Harry.
Harry stared down at his shoes, not wanting to meet Draco’s gaze that still lingered on him. He had to focus on the task at hand, not the fact that Draco seemingly had decided to pick a side. He couldn’t really believe it. Neville looked at them in confusion, clearly expecting more of a reaction. Harry couldn’t think of anything to say, not in front of all of Dumbledore’s Army, at least.
As he said it, the diadem suddenly glowed red and hot. Draco dropped it with a gasp, and it fell to the stone floor with a loud ringing sound.
to me. Not only was he not trying to be cruel, but he asked me how my holidays had been and if I’m still seeing McLaggen. He must’ve slipped and hit his head so hard he forgot who I am.”
Harry thought of the scars on Draco’s back and grimaced, or he would have, if he could move his face.
Before Harry could answer, Hermione grabbed Neville’s armed and hauled him back towards the other students.
“Come on, let’s focus on this assignment and maybe we can go fly a short bit afterwards.” Ron smiled, wanting desperately to persevere their newly won peace.
Harry suddenly felt angry, angry at Malfoy, angry at the meekness in his voice, as if they weren’t sworn enemies.
“There’s not a single girl at Hogwarts I’d like to take on a date to a Slug-club event”, Harry said in annoyance.
“Must see?” Crabbe laughed. “I don’t take orders from you anymore. You and your daddy are dirt! Barely better than mudbloods if you ask me”, he laughed, lifted his hand and gave Malfoy a backhanded slap across the face.
Ron sighed. “I know that you didn’t know about the poisoned bottle, and you didn’t know for sure he was the one who hurt Katie, it’s just… You were spouting shit about Malfoy before the schoolyear even started, and then you just went ahead and did
Harry knew at once that he’d said this too loud. He glanced around the room and everyone, including Draco himself, was looking over at him.
This last bit sounded utterly insincere, but Harry thought it was a decent attempt, more than he’d expected. He ruefully wondered what Hermione would say if he convinced Draco to join S.P.E.W.
He pushed down harder, but the bleeding continued. Blood welled up between his fingers and stained his shirtsleeves. The shaking wouldn’t stop, and Harry could feel himself tremble too. Draco’s face grew paler by the second and then, suddenly, he grew limp.
“But Malfoy could well have given him the bottle before he knew him or had someone else do it for him.”
Suddenly, Goyle’s face stiffened, the corners of his mouth freezing in a grin. For a moment he stood swaying back and forth like a rocking chair, before he toppled over backwards with a thud. Harry crawled up to his knees, his body aching and ears ringing. He saw Ron and Hermione standing side by side – Crabbe had managed to force them into a corner by almost toppling another wall of things onto Ron – and wondered how they’d managed to hit Goyle. Then he saw Malfoy, who’d emerged from his hiding place and managed to collect his wand. At first, Harry thought Malfoy was pointing his wand at him, but then the truth dawned on him.
As the flaming monsters crept closer, they pulled Goyle onto Ron and Hermione’s broom and they shot away. Draco climbed up behind Harry, wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry had to jeer sharply to the left as a chimera lunged for them with snapping teeth. Draco’s grip tightened and he buried his face into Harry’s shoulder as yet another monster had Harry sending them up into a climb. Harry’s heart was beating fast as he scanned the floor items that still were intact.
