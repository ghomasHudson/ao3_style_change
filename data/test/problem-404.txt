“Harry...I – ”
Harry took the frames and examined them. It was the first time he got to pick what he wanted his glasses to look like, so he figured he might as well do some playing before picking what he wanted. “Can you make them plastic and a bit wider?” Harry asked as he passed them back to the Potions Professor.
Severus stopped just outside the doors of the hospital wing as Remus whispered his name. He didn’t turn around or respond, but just waited for his one-time lover and ex-enemy to speak.
“Do not fret, Harry. You will see them all again very soon. You may have had to die to destroy the Horcrux, but the Prophecy states that one must die at the hand of the other. You died by your own hand, Harry, and so you are not truly dead. Do you know where you are?”
“I…Draco…What was that memory?” Harry asked in a horrified whisper as he dropped back down into his chair, staring wide eyed at the Slytherin.
Harry sighed deeply as he looked away from Remus and stared out the single sitting room window, towards the ever twinkling stars in the inky black sky, the brightest one mocking him as his godfather’s namesake. “The reason I pick up spells more quickly than my peers is because I have extra power; the power that Voldemort transferred to me as a baby. I have an unfair advantage, and it cost me my parents to receive that advantage. I just want to be normal, even if it means struggling to learn difficult spells and skills like everyone else in my year at Hogwarts.”
“The Headmaster said he’s of the opinion that my father is sincere, so that means we can trust him,” Draco argued. He knew his father was going to be a sore subject for him, he just hoped it wouldn’t cause some sort of rift between him and Harry.
Harry blinked and looked up, noticing that Mrs. Luther and Severus were both staring at him with a concerned expression. He shook his head slowly, meeting Mrs. Luther’s eyes directly.
Draco clung on to Harry tightly as more memories slammed into him with the force of a brick wall. He squeezed his eyes closed as the new information swirled around in his mind, making him feel dizzy and faint. “Bloody hell, that was not a pleasant feeling...” he mumbled, pulling away from Harry slightly with a grimace on his face.
“I’m sorry, Remus. I know you hate when I keep things from you, but I thought it would be better to keep this to myself until I was sure of my suspicions. Apparently I was wrong. I’ll tell you, but you have to promise me not to tell Harry or any of the others. I may be a fool for believing any of this could help, but I have to be sure.”
Remus looked up and shrugged, smiling lightly at his lover’s insistence in wearing his thick teaching robes when outside of his personal quarters. “Maybe it didn’t get sent until after the morning post? It had a Ministry seal of some sort, but I couldn’t get near enough to see the return address. That owl was pretty nasty.”
S~S~S~S
Hermione offered him a gentle smile, not really caring about the rumours that would crop up over this in the least, because Harry had needed her last night, and best friends always come first. “Don’t apologize, Harry. I don’t think either of us intended to fall asleep together last night, we were just too drained to get back to our beds. I don’t care what people think; it’s none of their business anyways.”
what I thought happened. I’m sorry to hear about your family, Harry, that’s horrible. You know I don’t really like Snape, but if he saved your life than he deserves a bit of credit for that. He’s not being so…nasty anymore, is he?”
then can you effectively go after the Dark Lord with any hopes of coming out the victor.”
Go to Dumbledore, tell him Harry is alive and seems well, but his family is not. I’m taking him to my home in Bristol,” Severus whispered to the silvery doe that stood before him. He flicked his wand and the doe galloped away gracefully.
“A glass of firewhiskey and a good night’s sleep, but that’s beside the point. Headmaster Dumbledore agrees with my findings that the ambush in Diagon Alley was a setup. Every last detail...The bastard knew exactly what would happen, though he did expect Draco to die, not fall into a coma. I should have seen this coming, I should have listened to Remus and left you and Draco at the cottage, but I didn’t. I let this happen, and here I am blaming you for trying to protect the people you care about, when that’s what I failed to do myself,” Severus said, his head cradled tiredly in his palm.
to the girls is pretty tame compared to that.”
Harry’s jaw dropped as he felt his heart plummet and settle somewhere near his toes. Mr. Weasley was dying...and he never got the chance to apologize. He stood up slowly and made his way over to the other two-thirds of the Golden Trio and Ginny, feeling his throat constrict painfully.
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I don’t know why I’ve been so horrible, Mum. I just miss having Harry to myself. He was my best friend, and now I feel like I’ve been replaced. I just want things to go back to the way they were.”
“You’re too paranoid by half, Lupin. That’s my cloak, by the way.”
“That will make the talk a little easier then, I suppose. It’ll be hard enough as it is, but knowing there’s still a chance to try to convince them to wait helps. Was Harry mortified at the very thought?” Remus asked knowingly. He knew he’d been beyond embarrassed when his father had sat him down at sixteen and given him the talk, none the wiser that not only was his son gay, but he’d already
“Should we perhaps tell the Headmaster about these dreams, Severus?” Remus asked as he climbed back into bed after making sure Harry was asleep once more in his bed.
revealed what Tonks had told everyone the previous night; an order of impeachment had been filed against the current Minister for Magic, and it was rapidly gaining popularity. There were many quotes from many high-up officials showing their support, including Dumbledore, who stated that though he did not want the job himself, he would support the order all the way to the Wizengamot, where he would vote yea.
S~S~S~S
“Ok, so we’ve established that Voldemort has split his soul into at least six pieces – ”
Harry heard somebody chuckling as he rolled out of bed, and glared at Draco as he waltz into the room, fully dressed and looking wide awake. Harry’s hair was even more messy than usual, and he was starkers besides his boxers, though he didn’t mind that fact in front of Draco.
“Potter, stop playing the hero and let’s go! Look, there’s other’s coming to help now,” Draco pointed out as he saw three people running towards Snape, Remus, and the two Death Eaters with their wands drawn.
MacNair had always been a notoriously bloodthirsty individual. As the executioner for the Ministry’s Department of Magical Creatures, the man had always taken a little too much pleasure from his job. It was no surprise when MacNair joined the Death Eaters after being promised all of the blood and gore his shriveled, black heart desired.
Minerva stood up and retrieved the vial from Severus, looking carefully at the cerulean potion. “Are you sure this will work?”
As Harry reached the headstone, he saw that someone had charmed every-living lilies to grow; a feat which required an enormous amount of magical power and skill. He dropped down to his knees and let his hand trail through the small gathering of petals and stems as his eyes finally met the words inscribed on the marble before him. There were names and dates, and even an epitaph, but it all blurred together as Harry traced first his mother’s name, then his father’s, with his fingertips like a blind man would read Braille, dipping into the loops and curves of the elegant script, trying to feel something other than cold stone.
Harry grinned at the bushy haired girl, glad he could count on her, even after being an arse. He really did have amazing friends. “Draco has been receiving threats from the Slytherins.”
Harry’s eyes went wide even as he tried to shield his lips with his hand. “Merlin, Hermione, calm down! I was going to tell you. It’s...um, well, not who you’d expect,” Harry said, trying to find a way to break it to her that not only was he dating someone, but he was dating another boy, and said boy was Draco bloody Malfoy. He received only a glare and a sharp jabbing movement with her wand.
“This summer, we unfortunately lost three of our dear students to violence due to Voldemort’s uprising. Would be fifth year, Warwick Davis of Slytherin; would be second year Delilah Jacobs of Hufflepuff; and would be seventh year Amelia Stoneheart of Gryffindor. Another student has also been hospitalized indefinitely, as he is in a coma from another Death Eater attack; sixth year Draco Malfoy of Slytherin.” The hall broke out in gasps, whispers, cries of shock and a few wails of grief. “I’d like to have a moment of silence for these lost souls and their grieving families.”
Remus took a deep breath, scrubbing a rough hand over his weary, prematurely aged face. “I’m…alive. It’s been pretty difficult, dealing with the aftermath. I’ve been helping with the cleanup of the graveyard, being interviewed by the Auror department over and over, trying to keep some semblance of sanity as the Order is in complete chaos. But Harry, you did it. We won.”
“You stay the hell away from her, you hear me?” Ron shouted, taking a step closer to the man who had put his little sister through hell when she was still so very young.
Harry, Draco, and Hermione were having a blast, dancing to the music blaring from the Wizarding Wireless, drinking butterbeer, and snacking on the trays of food the house elves had provided. There were very few people joining in on the dancing, but when Tonks dragged Professor Flitwick out to the dance floor and Metamorphosed herself to his height, the entire room was in stitches as they danced an elegant waltz.
At exactly midnight, Hermione shot off a colourful array of wand sparks and cheered. Harry looked down and saw that Draco had indeed fallen asleep like he’d warned he would. He smirked as he got an idea, and shifted himself to a better angle of attack. Lifting Draco’s chin gently, Harry kissed him quite thoroughly, laughing against the Slytherin’s lips as he woke up mid-kiss and gave a soft moan as he started to respond to the kiss. Only after the tolling of the bells ended did they stop kissing.
“We have a request for you, Black, but first, I think it would be wise to bring you up to speed on the year you’ve been beyond the veil. Much has changed.”
and rude comments like that! What in the hell has gotten into you?” Hermione shrieked, successfully gaining the entire corridor’s attention, paintings included.
Harry shook his head slowly, feeling his heart jump into his throat at the mention of Sirius’ death. He’d never forgive Dumbledore for that...
“Harry, we’re more prepared this time. All you need to worry about is finding the Horcrux and getting out of there as fast as you can. Let the rest of us worry about everything else; that’s what we’re going to be there for,” Draco assured the Gryffindor. He could feel his boyfriend’s hands shaking as he clasped them in his own. Draco pulled Harry forward and gave him a long, passion-filled kiss, trying to erase all of his worry with his love.
He pulled the blade away from the handle, careful not to run his finger over the sharp metal. He pulled his knees up to his chest, wrapping his arms around them as he laid the razor down beside him. He closed his eyes tight, trying not to second guess himself, but it was inevitable.
“Get up, Harry. You’re going to miss breakfast. Draco’s waiting for you,” Severus said as the bright light of his wand unmercifully poked Harry in the eyes. He pulled his pyjama shirt over his head to block out the light, and yelped quite loudly as all of his clothes, except for his boxers, vanished as well.
Shortly after, everyone gathered around the small marquee in the back garden, whispering their final goodbyes to Arthur as they added a single flower to the lid of his casket, each representing a different well-wish to take with him on the next journey. As was tradition, all the Weasley men and Harry (and Ginny, because Molly couldn’t persuade her otherwise) lowered the casket into the pre-dug grave, and reburied it by hand. A headstone was placed flat into the earth, marking Arthur’s final resting place forever more.
“No!” Severus yelled as he sat bolt upright in bed, his body covered in cold sweat as he trembled.
Severus easily slid a hand up to tangle in the fine hairs at the back of Remus’ neck, returning the pressure eagerly and, surprisingly, without any qualms this time. It felt good to just kiss Remus without feeling nervous or scared of what might happen afterwards. He had bravely set aside any room for uncertainty the night before. After what felt like days, Severus eventually pulled away, amused at the groan of protest from the werewolf. “Shower, Remus,” he said with a soft chuckle, only slightly aware of how close they still were to each other.
Dobby nodded up at the Potions Master, his ears flapping excitedly at the thought of cooking for Harry Potter. “Of course, Professor Snape, sir. Shall I bring the materials here and make it, or have it made in Hogwarts’ kitchens?” Dobby asked.
Severus sighed as he opened the door wider and motioned for her to come in, shutting the door carefully behind her. “He retired to his room about half an hour ago, but I’m almost positive that he is not yet asleep. You can knock and ask if he wants to see you; I’ll not force company on him if he’d rather not have it.”
Hermione was smiling as she hiccupped through the tears still streaming down her cheeks. She was startled into laughter as Harry was the one to attack her in a tight hug this time. “I’ll try to think more before I question you from now on. You’re right; I just get so worried that I sometimes don’t stop to think first.”
“Harry, it’s not your fault, shh…” Draco whispered as he gathered the Gryffindor into his arms. He felt useless as Harry ignored his admonishment and kept sobbing nonsense to no one in particular.
“Of course I do, you depraved boy! I don’t walk around in my underwear – Well…not anymore, at least. Your father saw to that. I made damn sure I wore pants from that day forth.”
“Remus! Is that – ?”
Harry smiled and pushed Draco’s feet off the ottoman so he could sit down, ignoring the glare he received from his boyfriend. His parents sat down together on the bed across from them, looking slightly concerned if still curious.
Severus groaned as every muscle in his body ached and he felt the blood seeping from his various wounds. He had many broken bones and plenty of internal damage, he was sure of that, but he had managed to hang on to his consciousness through sheer will alone. He couldn’t dignify a better response as his throat was raw and torn from screaming. He tried to open his swollen shut eyes so that he could see the man currently wrapping a cloak around his naked and bloody body.
S~S~S~S
“I think it’s a brilliant idea, Harry! You should talk to your dad about it,” Hermione said just as the Potions Master walked in, the door slamming behind him. Harry didn’t have a chance to respond as quizzes floated to each student.
S~S~S~S
White hot knives were carving into his flesh, his robes a tattered mess as blood sprayed and gushed from countless wounds across his entire body. It was as if he had been sliced with a thousand sharp swords. Severus knew this spell – knew it
WARNING: Tension, talk of murder.
“Yes, of course I know about it. I actually had a question for you concerning that. How do you feel about taking control of the Advanced group so that Remus and I may concentrate more on the lacking students?” Severus asked, trying to fight off a smile as a complete look of shock stole over his son’s face.
It was long after Madam Pomfrey had doused all of the candles and locked up her office for the night that Harry sat watching the steady rise and fall of Draco’s chest, just to make sure he was still breathing.
“It’s alright, I understand. How is he?” Harry asked as Remus led him back to the table and took a seat beside his son. He was glad when Draco stood and prepared them both a fresh cup of tea and remembered that the young Slytherin was probably as worried as he and Harry were; Severus
“I don’t feel so good,” he muttered, quickly extracting himself from the table and making his way out of the Great Hall. He hurried quickly to the front doors, hearing foot steps behind him as he burst through the doors, ran down the steps and across the grounds. Harry only stopped when he reached the beech tree beside the lake, gasping for breath and clutching a stitch in his side.
heal, and that’s what matters. I’m just glad nothing happened to you. I’m glad it was me that Voldemort aimed for, not you,” said Severus, though his tone had gotten pretty acidic in regards to physical therapy. This was clearly a sore spot for the Potions Master.
Draco slashed his wand nearly before the words had left Ron’s mouth and shouted, “
The Professor looked slightly disbelieving, but she nodded anyways. “Yes, you may. Mr. Potter, will you please escort Mr. Malfoy to the infirmary?”
Before Remus could respond, there was the sound of steps coming towards them, and the weight of someone sitting on the other side of Harry on the sofa.
Though it seemed like it had been hours, twenty minutes passed in silence as Severus and Harry both became lost in their own thoughts. Finally, Severus broke the silence as he turned to Harry.
New Years Eve arrived at last, and with it came a massive snow storm that kept everyone indoors and close to the fires. The usually festive day seemed somehow darkened and unimportant as Harry watched his father disappear into a quiet daze of despair, no matter how hard the Potions Master tried to hide it. Even after their initial talk following Remus’ departure, Severus had still been in a bit of a funk and nothing Harry did or said seemed to help. Draco had reassured Harry over and over again that things would be ok, but that didn’t help much while Harry watched his father lock himself up in his room with a bottle of firewhiskey.
“Aye, he’s still kickin’ so be careful. Get rid of the body tonight; Malfoy will kill us if we let Snape here smell up his pretty little cellar.”

Throughout the class, Harry worked diligently on his potion, being as precise as possible while still trying to finish quickly. He knew Hermione was off her game because of her row with Ron when he saw that she was at least four steps behind him in the potion making process. After the first hour, he looked around and saw that he was indeed ahead of everyone else, with Neville coming in close behind him. It looked like Ron had simply given up and was stirring around what looked like murky brown water lazily. After adding the final ingredient, powdered unicorn horn, Harry stirred his potion clockwise for four minutes, and then counter-clockwise for two before letting it simmer for ten minutes. He ladled out some of his potion and poured it carefully into a vial, corking it with his wand and holding it by the wax seal, as the glass was hot from the contents. He walked up to Snape’s desk and held out the potion, waiting for the class’s reaction.
The blood drained from the Slytherin’s face, even as Harry grabbed one of his hands and gave it a reassuring squeeze. He squeezed back a little bit harder than was strictly necessary. He already knew what the break-out meant, but it was vocalized anyways.
“Let go of me, you Mudblood little whore!”
Before Ginny and Ron could shout their horrified and angry out-bursts, the doors opened and in walked Professor McGonagall, leading in the long line of first years. The Hall remained generally quiet as the sorting began. Afterwards, the feast began after a few short words from Dumbledore.
Draco sighed heavily, trying not to let his irritation show. If it wasn’t for Harry’s insistence to leave Ron alone, he would have torn the redhead a new one by now. “Well, let’s go and find him then. I don’t want to sleep alone anymore.”
Harry moved towards the hall, heading to his own room. He was stopped by a hand on his shoulder, turning him around to face Snape.
“What,
“He means harmony,”
“Like I said,” Severus stood up and moved the chair aside, “It was no trouble.” He began to turn away but stopped as Harry spoke again.
Fifteen minutes later, as Harry was heading to the Great Hall for dinner, his father caught up with him from the stairs to the dungeons. He felt himself blush at the memory of nearly falling to his death on the sixth floor, and knew it was inevitable that his father would find out sooner or later.
?” Severus snapped, ready to give detentions until the girl graduated. The nerve, saying something like that right in front of him!
Hermione had been right; at lunch the next day, which was a Saturday, Harry received a small scroll, instructing Harry to meet Dumbledore in his office on Monday after lessons had been completed.
“Do not remind me of how very old I am, Draco. It’s uncouth.”
The entire class groaned and sent glares at both Harry and Draco, who were determinedly not looking at each other as they followed Severus out of the classroom and down the corridor a ways until the Potions Professor-turned-Defence Professor stopped abruptly and cast a privacy charm around them.
Hermione blushed, ducking her head as she copied down the address of the West London Hotel and handed it and the other fake credential to Severus. “I’m not sure if there are any floo nodes close to this hotel. Flying might be the best option. It’s not too terribly far from here, but certainly not walking distance, either.”
Avada Kedavra!
S~S~S~S
call home. The trunk that he had been so reluctant to pack and bring along sat at the foot of his bed, unopened and abandoned. Harry still hadn’t changed into his night clothes, nor had he gone down for dinner. In fact, he was trying to avoid everyone all together by locking himself up in Gryffindor Tower.
do you think you’re doing, setting up an engagement with some German Heiress I’ve never met before? For one, dearest father, I’m
friends do. I think you should just stop and think about all of this –
“I have a free period right now, and a barn owl was waiting in our quarters with it. I saw Remus’ handwriting on it and I brought it straight to you. I hope that fits in with my grounding,” Harry said with a cheeky grin as his father cuffed him on the back of the head and rolled his eyes.
“So I’m sure all of us here understand what the main issue is; the cores of mine and Voldemort’s wands are twins. They can’t be used against each other without weird stuff happening, like Priori Incantatem. I think that, perhaps, we have to go about this another way. The one thing Voldemort would least expect and be the least prepared for is an attack based on muggle technology.”
Remus copied Snape’s movements and did the same to Draco, shoving him close to Harry as the Invisibility cloak swung around both teens. “We need to protect Draco as well, Severus.”
Severus was looking suspiciously between Harry, Hermione, and Remus, but he didn’t voice his concerns as he bumped Harry’s shoulder and gestured for him to give his seat back. Harry obliged quickly, smiling at his soon-to-be father.
“Arthur had a stroke shortly before Christmas and was in hospital for a bit. He died. Not long after, Azkaban was infiltrated and the Death Eaters who had been imprisoned after the attack that caused your death were broken free, including Lucius Malfoy. He had no idea his wife had been murdered by her own sister, or that his son had been abused, nearly killed, was comatose and then amnesic.
Harry watched as the pompous, much taller Slytherin whispered to his friends before moving towards the centre of the classroom. He was eyeing Harry with a smirk that said he thought he’d already won. Harry couldn’t wait to wipe that smirk off of his face.
“‘Night.”
Remus shuddered as well, glancing over at Ron who was greeting his girlfriend with a chaste kiss. “Yes, I hadn’t really been aware of it until Ron told the story, actually. Bloody lucky he is, having Fawkes around to save him.”
He stood in the deserted corridor with the script still in hand, trying to make up his mind what he should do next: should he turn left towards the Headmistress’s office and just get this over with? He’d been desperate to go home since the moment he’d set foot on the Hogwarts Express. But if he was so desperate to leave, why was this such a difficult choice to make?
“I wasn’t going to say anything,” said Harry innocently before a mischievous grin spread across his face. “All I’ll say is that I think you’re going to make a lovely princess.”
“We’ve got some time to kill before we need to go to Defence class,” said Harry. “Where do you guys want to go?”
and plopped it onto his lap.
“Alright, I didn’t realise you were so sensitive about it,” Draco teased. “I suppose your hair isn’t all bad. The permanently unkempt aesthetic rather suits you.”
“That’s correct, Professor.”
Minerva wanted to say no. She wanted to toss Narcissa’s polite but pleading letter into the fireplace and forget all about her and her awful family. She’d had enough of the Malfoy’s schemes and prejudices. She wanted to say no and she was finally in a position where she could and nobody could argue otherwise. But instead, she thought about what was best for the school, what was best for the students, and ultimately, what was best for Draco. If Hogwarts was going to have any chance of reconciliation, she needed to include everyone, regardless of her personal feelings for certain individuals.
“What about Sunday after breakfast?” he offered. Initially, Harry nodded in agreement but then his shoulders sagged and he groaned.
“Draco, wait!”
? It’s not like anybody is going to see it.”
“...you are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.”
Ron glared at Harry for a few moments before huffing out a sigh and pulling a book about ancient sigils towards him, and they read in awkward silence for a few moments.
Tensions only mounted when the play received some unexpected (and for the majority of those involved, unwanted) attention in the media. When their first scheduled visit to Hogsmeade was announced at the end of January, Luna excitedly told Harry and the others that this was an opportunity to distribute more posters for the upcoming play to a wider audience.
“Harry, I know you’re out here,” she called, dipping in and out of view between the trees as she drew closer. She stalked forward in Harry’s direction and he held his breath as she walked past him without a second glance before coming to a stop between two trees. Turning in all directions as she searched in vain for him, she let out an exasperated sigh, brushing her long mane of red hair off of her pale, freckled shoulders and looking increasingly annoyed. She stepped under the shade of the larger of the two trees, causing a mosaic of shadows to dance across her sun-kissed face and Harry couldn’t help but think how beautiful she looked in that moment.
“A ballpoint pen,” he explained, finally pulling a battered quill from his bag. “It’s like a Muggle quill. Here…”
“You want me to ride it first?” he asked.
“Oh, right.”
“Have they found him yet?” she asked.
She could have happily spent the rest of the day with Hestia, discussing Tolkien and drinking tea, but when she glanced up at the clock above her desk she groaned as she realised the time.
“It’s too much, isn’t it?” Harry grimaced.
“Don’t remind us,” Snape muttered.
They clinked their metal tankards together and Liv took a deep swig of her drink, relishing the hot, sickly sweet liquid coating her tongue before flowing down her throat, heating her belly. Wrapping her hands around the mug, she enjoyed the warmth flowing through her fingers, banishing the wintery chill. Hestia snorted out a laugh and Liv frowned.
“Will there be anything else?” he asked.
“Well?” she inquired. “How do I look?”
As they made their way up the garden path, they saw Mrs Weasley waiting for them at the back door. Harry felt a pang of guilt at the worry etched on her face which only eased as she caught sight of them. Mrs Weasley had always been protective of her children, but her anxiety had reached new heights since Fred had died. She had even reverted back to carrying the Weasley clock around with her everywhere she went, constantly monitoring the well-being of her family. Harry had overheard Mr Weasley talking to her about it a few nights previously, saying that carrying the clock everywhere was an unhealthy coping mechanism. Harry, however, could empathise with how she must feel. He had often thought if he’d owned a similar clock with Sirius’ name on it, things might have turned out quite differently.
A few minutes passed and another paper aeroplane flew into the room, landing on the messy desk. Tearing open the letter, Liv read the short reply and sighed, thumping her head against the desk. She looked equal parts relieved and distressed that her younger cousin had also decided to turn up for work.
“Yeah? Glad that you’re finally starting to realise that,” he joked, then added more seriously, “You know, if you need to talk…”
“It’s as good as,” Harry disagreed. “Thanks for taking one for the team, mate.”
Draco lowered the mirror and pulled Harry into a deep kiss. He might not have thought to get Harry a gift of his own, but he could think of a couple of ways that he could make up for it. Breaking the kiss, he whispered against Harry’s lips, “Take off your clothes and lie down on your front.”
“I’m going,” he muttered, pushing past Draco towards the exit. “Just watch yourself with this one, Potter. He’s as trustworthy as his name suggests.”
“Are we still on for doing another rehearsal?”
“Yes, it is quite a pickle we’re in,” said Draco sarcastically. “If only there was some way we could transfigure out clothes to look the way we want them to—using magic, perhaps?”
“I doubt that’s what it’ll be, Ron,” said Hermione quietly. “Not after what happened the last time.”
“Who did this?” he asked.
Harry moved closer to Draco and everyone in the room seemed to hold their collective breath. Despite his calm exterior, he could feel Draco’s pulse beating as rapidly as his own heart. It was comforting to know that he was feeling just as nervous as Harry was.
“What can I say? We’re a competitive bunch. And let’s be honest, we were never going to be loved by the crowd, not against Gryffindor—not against you. Playing fair never got us anywhere, so we played dirty.”
“Not really,” he admitted. “But knowing for certain that it's not a problem puts my mind at ease a bit.”
He spread his legs wider then, a silent invitation to proceed. Draco let out a shaky breath and began to press forward. Harry winced and Draco felt the muscles clench with an instinctive flinch of resistance, but Draco took Harry’s cock in hand and began to stroke it back and forth at a leisurely pace.
“This...this is a lot to take in,” sighed Minerva, draining her cup of the last of its tea. It had long since gone cold but she barely noticed. She was trying to process everything that Liv had shown her. “The fire you set, I don’t remember it being reported in The Prophet.”
“Your mother and I are hosting a Winter Ball,” he explained. “Just a few close friends and foreign dignitaries will be in attendance, but your presence will be required.”
he thought ruefully. Hope was a lover’s staff, Shakespeare had said. Walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts. Well, since Draco had little else going for him at the moment, hope would have to suffice.
“The Slytherin students didn’t deserve it, either!” Hermione said angrily. “And if you ask me, doing the same thing to the people responsible makes us no better than them. As if Madam Pomfrey doesn’t have enough to contend with than to deal with idiots sneaking Fainting Fancies and Puking Pastilles into people’s food.”
Of course, Harry’s school experience had been nothing like what he had expected it to be. It had been magical, yes, but it had also been more challenging and dangerous than he could ever have imagined. His years at Hogwarts, as difficult as they had been at times, had helped to shape him into the man he was now. As he was about to embark on this next great adventure of his life, he couldn’t help but wonder what kind of man he would be when he finally returned home.
Harry tutted. “It sounds like I’ve been a very bad boy, Sheriff. Perhaps we can come to some sort of arrangement?”
They followed Liv back down the corridor, up the marble staircase, higher and higher until they reached the seventh floor. It was only as they approached the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy that Harry realised where Liv was taking them. Sure enough, she stopped beside the blank wall across from the tapestry and waited for the stragglers to catch up before speaking again.
Hermione’s hand had shot so quickly into the air that she nearly knocked Harry’s glasses off of his face.
Draco’s words were cut short as Harry deliberately directed his feather up Draco’s nose. Harry laughed as Draco spluttered and batted the feather away, looking miffed.
“Do you want me to come with you?” she offered, but Harry shook his head. She let out a tired sigh and rose to her feet. “Alright, I’ll leave you boys to talk it out amongst yourselves. Send a messenger spell if you need me.” She hesitated a moment before adding, “He might be less than understanding about your relationship with Draco, but he won’t abandon you, Harry. You’re his best friend. We both just want what’s best for you.”
“Naturally,” she shrugged. “I didn’t take Myra’s warning lightly, but I wasn’t ready to decide one way or another what I was going to do. Then things began to escalate—the Brockdale Bridge fell, giants destroyed large portions of the West Country, and then Amelia Bones was murdered.” Liv’s voice wavered a little as she recalled the death of her colleague, but she cleared her throat and continued, “Yes, Voldemort was back, but life continued as normal for most of us—we had work to do and bills to pay, war gave us no reprieve from our responsibilities. So, for the next year, while the number of disappearances and murders of Muggles and Magic folk increased, I kept going to work. I hoped, rather naively, that the Ministry would catch Voldemort and everything would go back to the way it used to be.”
“You went into work?” she asked incredulously. “After what you had just heard?”
“Sheer coincidence,” he lied. “Alright, since none of my costume choices have been to your liking so far, tell me what you’re looking for.”
“Well, I’m glad we managed to get our daily quota of weird stuff out of the way before lunch,” said Harry, stowing his wand back into his pocket.
“Just drop it,” Draco warned. “It’s not something I want to talk about, least of all with you.” Unwilling to discuss the matter any further, Draco used wandless magic to draw the curtain around his bed.
“I’d be crying too if I were sorted into Slytherin,” Ron said grimly. “I’m surprised McGonagall doesn’t just disband their house altogether.”
“Uh, Neville,” Harry began cautiously. “That tank is empty.”
“You’re a terrible liar, you know that?” she mused. “You look like you’re jealous of that quill of his.”
“Alright, I’m going,” he sighed dramatically. “I’m going to enjoy the feast and think up a whole host of other things I can say and do to annoy you this year.”
“I’m trying to keep a low profile,” he argued. “You convinced me that it was worth my while sticking it out here, but now I’m beginning to suspect you had an ulterior motive all along. Was this the reason why you convinced me not to leave Hogwarts? Just so that you could humiliate me with
“This isn’t really an appropriate place to discuss the matter,” Sir Nicholas replied evasively but not before casting a disparaging glance in Draco’s direction. Draco just rolled his eyes; he knew that he should be used to everyone being openly disdainful of him by now, but it still got on his nerves from time to time.
“Oh, I left that at home,” said Mr Weasley, hurrying around the car to pop open the bonnet. “Your mother finally forgave me for the incident with the Ford Anglia so she let me buy this!”
Harry threw another missile but just as it was about to land inside the bedpan it veered wildly off to the right seemingly of its own accord. Harry frowned, confused at what had just happened while Draco struggled to smother his laughter. Brushing it off, Harry tried again only for the same thing to happen. He threw a suspicious glance at Draco who tried to look innocent but was struggling to hide the smile that threatened to spread across his face.
“I didn’t think it would help the situation,” Liv argued mildly. “He was ready to pack his bags and leave, and I thought punishing him would have just pushed him over the edge. He needed someone to talk to—Merlin, he just needed someone to listen to him—not berate him.”
Hermione looked more startled that Goyle had addressed her directly than the revelation that a chimaera was inside their classroom, particularly since the hulking Slytherin had been glowering at the trio since they had returned to Hogwarts.
“HARRY POTTER!”
“You know, the last time I visited a zoo, I didn’t even know that I was a wizard yet,” he confided.
“Good. And while we’re on the subject of guests, it would be best if you didn’t invite Theo. You two may be bosom buddies, but his family name is less than reputable these days. You understand that we need to be careful who we’re seen to be associating with.”
Draco couldn’t disguise the nervous note in his voice but he didn’t object to Harry’s suggestion. Ignoring the sound of his heartbeat thudding like a kettledrum in his ears, Harry tentatively reached out to touch Draco. Draco remained perfectly still as Harry brushed their fingers together, and Harry couldn’t help but notice how much softer Draco’s hands were compared to his own; years of doing the Dursley’s housework and gardening had left the tips of his fingers calloused but smooth. Harry moved a little closer to Draco until their thighs pressed together but Draco didn’t move away. Testing the waters, Harry slipped his hand into Draco’s and although Draco didn’t seem to dare look in his direction, his thumb brushed over the top of Harry’s hand. Slowly, Draco’s head tilted to the left towards Harry. His breaths were uneven, betraying his nerves, but slowly his face began to loom closer to Harry’s. Harry felt like his heart was beating so hard in his chest that it might leap out of his throat, but like a magnet he leaned forward, drawing ever closer to Draco’s mouth which was only inches away from his own now…
“Would you like a biscuit?” she offered. Liv raised her eyebrows in surprise at the gesture before giving Minerva a small, but genuine, smile.
“You know why,” said Draco. “Because you’re too—”
Hermione and Ron both groaned in response to this comment and, mercifully, the conversation steered away from Harry onto more mundane topics. Sitting down at one of the free stools in Greenhouse Seven, Harry immediately unfolded the Marauder’s Map under the desk and began scanning it for Draco’s name, only vaguely paying attention to Professor Sprout mentioning something about fire seed bushes and dragonhide gloves. He checked the usual places that he might find Draco—the Slytherin Common Room, the kitchens—and just as Harry was beginning to suspect that Draco was either off campus or in the Room of Requirement, he spotted his name in a wholly unexpected place. And yet there he was, sat in one of the cubicles in the girl’s lavatory on the second floor.
Harry gave a dramatic sigh. “You’re right, that is a big ask. I don’t think I can refrain from making jokes about you either, you’re such an easy target.”
Minerva couldn’t help but snort at the shocked expression that flashed across Yaxley’s face before it hardened again into an ugly scowl. He quickly straightened himself to his full height, his hands clenched into fists at his sides.
“I don’t care!” Draco declared. Just then, Draco’s expression morphed from one of frustration to realisation. “I mean...
Liv’s heartbeat quickened as Hestia took a step closer to her, reached over her shoulder and pulled a book from the shelf behind her. Her heart sank when she saw the front cover of the book Hestia had picked up—another copy of
“Because, as you pointed out yourself, I’m more than qualified for the position,” she reminded her. “I possess a unique combination of skills and experience that others can’t bring to the role. I have over twenty years of experience in Muggle Liaisons and I have faced a lot of unique and challenging cases, but as I’ve already demonstrated, I’m adaptable to any given situation.”
“A little bit.”
Draco slowed down before finally coming to a full stop so that they could admire the beautiful view before them. A sea of fluffy white clouds lay beneath their feet, shining in the brilliant sunlight like nascent snow, stretching to the horizon. Harry’s grip on Draco’s waist eased but he continued to hold him close, resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco didn’t immediately respond and his eyes remained fixed on his shoes, but Harry felt the tension in his arm ease a little. Harry gave his arm a quick affectionate squeeze before withdrawing and picking up his own mirror, deciding to drop the graffiti issue for the time being. He thought to himself that he really ought to try and fix his hair. He figured that if he couldn’t transfigure it back he could just shave his head; no doubt it would have grown back to its normal shaggy length come morning.
“Who wouldn’t?” Ron shrugged, sitting back down. “He’s not exactly Mr Popular around here, is he?”
“Pumpkin pasties aren’t really a thing here, so I grabbed you a couple of Danish pastries instead. And I wasn’t sure what Draco would want, so I bought a few different things. Hopefully there’s something in there that he’ll enjoy.”
Harry was loath to admit that the risk of getting caught wrapped up in Draco Malfoy’s arms by an unsuspecting passerby did give him quite a thrill. The school year had been, for the first time since he had become a student at the renowned institution, extremely dull and uneventful. Not that he missed being in constant peril, but without even Quidditch to distract him from the monotony of lessons and homework, he had to find other ways of keeping the blood pumping and Draco was certainly more than capable of doing that.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. He was fairly sure that Harry was lying but he decided to drop his inquiries for the time being. Turning back to the blank wall, he said the password aloud.
“You don’t mind missing it?” asked Draco but Harry shook his head.
He knew that it was becoming a bad habit, but Harry couldn’t help himself; while Professor Switch was busy scribbling on the blackboard, Harry pulled the Marauder’s Map out of his bag and checked the Hospital Wing. Sure enough, Draco’s name was there with Madam Pomfrey at his bedside. He wondered if anyone would go to visit Draco while he was there. Considering Harry hadn’t seen him talking to any of his friends since they’d returned to Hogwarts, he supposed not. Harry had thought that it was strange finding Draco lurking about the Hogwarts Express on his own long after everyone else had left. At first, Harry had suspected that he was up to something—as Draco Malfoy was prone to do—but after seeing him sitting alone at meal times and during classes, Harry quickly realised that, for once, that wasn’t the case.
“I won’t,” Harry assured him. “What happened tonight isn’t funny. I overheard people confessing all sorts of things—private stuff. People are going to need counselling after this.”
—Muggle-Born?”
Neville chuckled. “So, you felt a bit of an affinity towards her in that regard.”
“I don’t care what other people think!” Harry cried. “My life is nobody else's business but mine.”
Draco strained his ears and frowned in confusion as he heard what sounded like the fluttering of wings. Curious, he stuck his head out of the cubicle to see if a bird had flown into the bathroom and was surprised to see what, at first glance, appeared to be a large seagull soaring towards him. A bundle of white paper flew into his outstretched hand and he tutted as he recognised it as the script of
Draco tutted, “More stairs?”
“Exactly, they’re your friends, not mine,” said Draco. “How can you be sure that they won’t say anything about us?”
Draco stopped at a seated alcove and sat down. He put his head in his hands and looked despondent. “Sounds stupid, doesn’t it? After everything that’s happened, I lose my cool trying to walk through a bloody door.”
wasn’t likely to ever happen. Harry liked girls, for one thing, but most damning of all was that despite them being on talking terms, he was still Draco Malfoy. Shakespeare had argued that a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet, but his name and his past deeds condemned him from pursuing anything more than a tentative friendship with Harry.
“You want me to slow down?”
“If you wouldn’t mind,” he chanced. “It would be a lot easier for me to remember.”
Their brief foray at small talk quickly descended into another argument as they proceeded to sling verbal insults at each other for the remainder of the journey. As the carriage jerked to a halt at the castle steps, the great oaken front doors swung open of their own accord to welcome them into the vast flagged Entrance Hall. They continued to bicker furiously as they marched up the steps into the castle and across the entrance towards the Great Hall.
?” Hermione stopped in her rush to hug Harry and stared bemusedly at the strange group in front of her.
The tension in the room became suddenly very noticeable and palpable. Harry felt Severus stiffen beside him, and it was his turn to squeeze the older man’s had in his own to offer some sort of comfort. He turned back to Mrs. Luther and smiled.
Tonks nodded, still feeling ashamed of what she had said and a bit disconcerted about being admonished by a sixteen-year-old and actually deserving it. “Yeah, sure. I’m sure everything will be alright, Harry. I’ll let you know if I hear anything, eh? Get some rest.”
“You can start explaining at any time, Potter,” Draco snapped as he sat on the edge of his bed, his arms still folded tight over his chest. He was extremely angry, of course he was, but he was also really hurt to think that Harry could have touched someone else, wanted to be with someone else. Especially a
Harry frowned at the crestfallen look on Hermione’s face. He’d been so wrapped up in everything going on with Draco and Severus that he’d not spared much time for Hermione, or thought about how she was fairing with Ron and Ginny on the warpath.
“Wait! Something isn’t right, here. Harry was dead; not on the cusp of being saved, but absolutely dead. That cannot be Harry,” Remus reasoned, his voice shaking as he felt the spike of hope in his heart that he was wrong. Had Severus used the stone after all?
“Sweet Merlin, Severus…What have they done to you? It’s Remus; I’m under Polyjuice of another Death Eater. I’m sorry it’s taken this long to get to you, but I’m here now. I’m going to get you to safety, alright? Just hang on for a few more seconds.”
like that, Merlin,” Hermione joked, though really, she wished Ron had been there to celebrate with them. She frowned at the thought, wondering what the red head was doing now, or if he had simply gone to bed without celebrating at all.
“Stop calling me Potter,
“Of course not, Harry. We would have told you straight away had we known, I promise,” Severus assured his son, who looked about ready to burst into a fit of rage. He’d need to head the boy off before he gained a head of steam to attack with.
Severus sniffed, his jaw tightening slightly. He would not allow Harry’s choices to hurt him. He already had too many problems of his own to deal with; he didn’t need an adoptive son on top of it all, or so he let himself think as a means to distract the slight twinge of betrayal he felt. “As a last resort, naturally.”
Severus began to pace amongst the fallen parchment and Potions journals, running a hand through his hair in frustration. Harry had been doing so well with blocking his mind, but the second the boy let his guard down, the Dark Lord was there to wreck it all. Severus was an essential part of the Order, being the main informant of when, where, and how the Death Eaters were going to try and spring on Harry again and wreck havoc on the rest of the world. With his cover blown, they were all in grave danger. He needed to get to Dumbledore, and fast.
Severus frowned as he lowered the cup of tea he was about to drink from. The way Remus was hesitating just slightly when he spoke of it told Severus that he wasn’t an exception to the torture. “Who were you masking as, Lupin?” Severus asked curiously. He hadn’t really been able to tell when Remus had rescued him, and had already passed out by the time Remus had retaken the Polyjuice potion.
“Yes indeed, Madam. It’s actually the papers for the adoption appeal,” Severus said distractedly as he read the address on the outside of the scroll and broke the wax seal to unroll it. His eyes scanned quickly over the opening paragraph before finding the sentence that told him all he needed to know. He broke out into one of his rare, unguarded smiles.
Remus sighed as he looked at his husband through his peripheral vision, unable to even move his head a few inches to meet the man’s eyes. “I was thinking that we needed to get this bloody Horcrux and get back home to our son and unborn daughter. Getting a new wand is a small price to pay for a piece of Voldemort’s soul. Now get the bloody thing before it decides to curse me on principle.”
“I did it for you,” Severus whispered against the werewolf’s ear, causing the man to shiver slightly in his embrace.
Remus sighed heavily, knowing he was probably promising something he couldn’t stick to. He nodded slowly, allowing himself to be pulled into a kiss. “Ok...I’ll go. I’ll take Harry and Hermione.”
“Forgive me, for I am curious; why do you need to know these things?” Lucius asked smoothly. He indeed sounded very curious, and for some reason Harry felt he could trust the man enough to tell him. After their talk not long ago, Harry thought he understood the man far better than even his own son did.
Draco didn’t bother to raise his hand this time. He’d answered nearly every question for the entire review session, and he was bored of it already. He scribbled down a few notes whenever something came up that he didn’t already know, but other than that, Double Transfiguration was extremely boring. Except for when his eyes trailed over to the other side of the room and focused on the back of a head full of unruly black hair.
“What is faith, Albus? That’s the second time I’ve been told to have faith in as many days. Tell me, what exactly does that mean?” Severus asked, feeling completely alien to the idea of faith. Faith was something that occurred in Muggle religion, which was a bunch of nonsense to him. But he knew that was not what the Headmaster was referring to.
“Thanks, Remus.”
“Did the Dark Lord say what it is he is trying to keep safe, what he’s willing to sacrifice?” Severus asked as he gave Harry a reassuring look as the teen fidgeted in discomfort at the scrutiny he suddenly found himself under from Pettigrew.
“Patience, Harry. It’s almost over,” Draco whispered into his ear, gripping his hand under the table as everyone began to break off into groups, each person knowing their role in what was to come. Harry sighed as he tried to draw strength from Draco’s words.
Hadn’t Harry sacrificed enough for the bloody people already? He’d lost his parents, was nearly killed himself, had a piece of Voldemort’s soul attached to his own soul, had a horrible, hate-filled childhood, battled the monster and his stupid minions time and again and tried to protect
? That nasty little son-of-a – ”
, right? “How’d the mission go, Remus?” Harry asked, trying to take his mind off the unsettling thoughts of Remus and Snape...
S~S~S~S
Before his mind and their treacherous thoughts could take hold of him, there was a soft knock on his bedroom door. He called for the visitor to come in, and Draco woke with a big yawn and a stretch. He sat up and gave Harry a good morning kiss, despite their morning breath, just as the Potions Master entered Harry’s room.
“That’s all I’ve ever wanted for you, Harry.”
“Mmm, I know the feeling. Bradley Barren, that thick-headed third year from Hufflepuff, decided to confuse wormwood and cedar bark. His hair thickening potion had the opposite affect when it exploded, removing everyone’s hair but my own. Poppy had a riot on her hands with a bunch of crying thirteen year old girls who refused to leave without all of their luscious hair back in place.”
“Is everything alright, at least?” Severus asked, annoyed that his son was seemingly keeping things from him already. That would definitely have to stop.
Harry closed his eyes and let the baritone of his father’s voice pull him into a sort of trance. He breathed in a shuddering breath, and breathed out all of the worry, panic, fear, and sadness. He felt his father’s warm, secure arms around him, could sense Sirius’ protective presence as well. He was not alone. He could do this.
Harry smiled as he caught Snape’s eye before turning around to go back and clean up his area and pack his things away. He felt very accomplished with his surprising performance and felt no sympathy as a few Slytherins and even some Gryffindors glared dolefully at him. After he packed away his stuff, he sat down on his stool to wait for the bell to ring. He jumped slightly when he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up to see Snape hovering over him, looking down his nose at him.
“Move to the dungeons with Harry and I. Move in with us for real instead of just spending the nights there. I want you there with me, and I don’t care what anyone thinks. I told the Casewitch about you, and she as good as told me that there will be no problems because of it. You belong with Harry and I.”
“Two,” replied Tonks.
fault for stripping me of it! I don’t care about the bloody money, Dad. Some things are more important than wealth!”
Pulling Harry close to him once more, Draco kissed him gently, lingering against his lips to offer some sort of comfort. He felt a wetness on his cheeks that was not his own tears, and he pulled away to dry Harry’s eyes.
“It took me a long time to figure out what to get you. I knew it had to be something special, something less typical than potions ingredients or anything of the like. I very nearly gave up and bought you a new cauldron, until I thought of this.” Remus gestured then for Severus to unwrap the gift, subconsciously holding his breath as the Potions Professor tore away the paper to reveal what was unmistakeably a ring box. Severus’ head snapped up quickly to meet Remus’ eyes, his jaw hanging slightly open. Neither of them noticed that the two teens in the room had turned to watch the exchange.
“Will three litres be enough, Severus? We weren’t sure how much to get, so we filled all of the flasks we could carry,” Remus asked nervously. He really hoped to never have to enter that dank and foul chamber ever again.
Harry stopped abruptly, watching as Severus distractedly kept walking a ways ahead of him before realizing he was alone. Harry had a scandalized look on his face, and Severus wasn’t quite sure he was prepared to handle what he knew was bothering Harry.
The next week was spent with everyone frantically flipping through books in the library. There had been a tense moment when Harry asked what had been done with Pettigrew, but Lucius eventually admitted to dropping him off at the Ministry the night before, where Pettigrew would be forced to confess his crimes against the Potters and the twelve muggle deaths that Sirius had been accused of. At lunch that day, the
“What’s your favourite season?” Severus asked the boy suddenly.
“Sounds fair enough, but how are we to fit that massive thing in the cauldron?” another figure asked while pointing at the statue before them.
“The next meeting will be announced at breakfast the day of. If you have schedule conflicts, please come to myself or Professor Lupin to discuss it. As part of your separate groups now, you all have a responsibility to each other. Like your Houses, these groups will be like your new family. You’re dismissed. Go straight to your dormitories, no dawdling. I
,” Albus pleaded as he looked straight into the black, fathomless eyes that held so much emotion, yet hid it all too well.
“No sir, I don’t think I’d ever be able to forget
The house elf nodded his understanding and snapped his fingers, a loud crack reverberating through the small cottage at his disappearance.
“I can’t explain everything right now, Dad. I’ll talk to you tonight, alright?” Harry whispered, watching carefully as Draco sat down and saved a seat at the front of the classroom for him. He made to enter the classroom, but the Potions Professor held tighter still.
Severus turned back towards the tall, elderly wizard who had taken him under his wing so many years ago and inclined his head in question.
“Good. We may need back up.”
anymore,” Sirius said quietly, rubbing at his chest. Throughout the barrage of information he was receiving, he kept all of his questions and confusion at bay, but after realizing that his Remus and the Potions Master were more than friends, he noticed the lack of connectedness the bond usually created between himself and Remus. He felt a hollow sadness, but tried not to let it show. A slight creeping anger and indignation was growing in his heart as well, but he squashed that down immediately. Remus had every right to move on with his life and fall in love again. Even if Sirius was not a big fan of his former lover’s new husband, he could not begrudge the man his happiness; that’s all he ever wanted for Remus.
“I’m going to kill my father.”
Minister for Magic
The Astronomy Professor accepted all the other well wishes and a quick hug from Harry before taking her leave, her trunk floating along behind her and she ascended the stairs into the entrance hall.
Hermione looked up from her diagram, a little shocked by Ron’s observation. She of course had already known that, but she was surprised Ron was finally starting to see it. “That’s because they are, Ron. They have a very deep understanding of each other. Not all couples are lucky enough to experience that.”
Draco sighed and nodded, pulling Harry close for one more kiss before gathering his cloak and leaving the dungeon quarters to study some more. He had a lot of work to do if he wanted to start the new term at the same level as his peers.
“Voldemort is, essentially, immortal. There are things, objects, which have to be destroyed before he can even be killed. That’s why he didn’t die when the Killing Curse rebounded on him when I was a baby. Have you ever heard of a Horcrux?” Harry asked, betting that Hermione had at least heard or read the word somewhere.
is important, I’d suggest divulging that information first,” said Lucius. He had a mad twinkling in his eyes that made Peter tremble uncontrollably.
A mix of emotions swarmed in Harry’s stomach, confusing his sense of relief with a sense of dread. Remus was alright, but there was no information on where Tonks was or who had her. That mixed with the very vague reference to being kept ‘warm’ by Severus and being referred to as ‘the pup’ sent a very strange feeling of warmth and indignation warring with all of the other emotions.
Severus’ eyebrows shot up reflexively as he stared at Harry, thrown by that non-sequitur quite nicely. He paused as he actually thought about how he would respond to such a random, yet important question. He loved Remus. He had finally admitted it to himself, and to Remus, not to mention said it out loud in front of Harry just minutes before. But did he love the werewolf enough to marry him, if it were possible? He knew there were other symbolic rituals that were recognized among the Wizarding community as near-marriage sanctity, such as the Joining of the Souls ceremony – the one Remus had already shared with another man. Severus was quite sure the question should be: would Remus marry
Draco smiled and leaned into his father’s embrace, missing the strong hugs he used to receive from the man when he was a much smaller child. He felt like he was perhaps regressing in age a little, but nothing compared to that of a parent’s undying love. “I am happy. Very much so.”
“Right you are, Ms. Granger. The Head Boy and Girl will be in charge and will be able to report to the Heads should they need to. You as Prefects are also in a position of authority, and I expect stand-up behaviour and applying of the rules to keep your peers in check. Of course, other staff members who cannot help in this process will also be there to help keep an eye on things.”
Severus nodded, twirling the small bottle in his hands. “Yes, I do. This is my last bottle, since I’ve been forced to ‘experiment’ on my store to appease the Dark Lord’s orders. I plan to make more but I figured that, since the full moon is so close, I would give this last bottle to you. I know I was your supplier before, so I fear you’d not be able to find any elsewhere.”
“So, how exactly are we going to retrieve Harry’s memory?” Draco asked as he moved the coffee table and the sofa back with a flick of his wand to make room for the rather large trunk.
Albus’ eyes flickered open, and it was immediately obvious that the Truth serum had taken affect. His usually sparkling blue eyes were dull and glossed over, and his cheerful expression replaced with slack indifference.
“I may have a way to obtain some more information on the matter, if I may?” Lucius interjected as he stood from the armchair he had been resting in while the other’s had their powwow at the table. They either hadn’t been aware he was in the room, or else they hadn’t cared what he heard.
He knew they must be talking about Remus, but he didn’t understand why they were talking about the wards. Only Severus was connected to the wards; killing Remus wouldn’t affect them at all.
S~S~S~S
“Yes, Remus, he is, but you are my husband and I want you safe inside the castle. You will recall another man who did not listen to the same advice from you, and it cost him his life?” Severus thought that perhaps reminding Remus of his dead ex-lover was a low blow, but if it made the werewolf stay safely in the castle, then it was worth it.
“Yeah, ok. Well, that night, the night of your little after party…well, you see. Hermione and I were both pissed up; she couldn’t even walk to her room. So I, er, I helped her to her room, though I couldn’t really walk either. I tried to help her into bed, ‘cos I knew she couldn’t do it on her own, see, but…well. Er…”
“Shut up, Malfoy.”
Severus had tuned Harry and Remus out and was focusing all of his attention on the broken boy cradled in the crook of his arm. He was shaking slightly and his skin was cold to the touch. “I think maybe you should get some rest for now. After you’re rested we can see about healing the rest of those bruises and cuts and try to get you eating and drinking normally again. Does that sound alright?” Severus asked the wounded Slytherin in a gentle whisper that was so unlike his usual drawl.
“Kingsley has just sent a message; they’ve found Albus.” The Transfiguration Professor looked incredibly tired and saddened as she walked over and pat Severus gently on the shoulder. She knew the younger man had thought of the Headmaster as a sort of surrogate father.
Severus gathered Harry into another hug as Remus released him, a niggling feeling in the back of his mind that something just did not feel right. He held his son close, knowing the boy was worried, and ran a hand through his hair in a comforting gesture. “Everything will be alright, Harry, you’ll see. We’ve come so far in just a few short months.”
He ran, but everything seemed to be in slow motion. Watching Severus fall, Mad-Eye Moody cursing Macnair, Ron and Draco running by with Hermione held between them, Tonks’ bloody nose and determined expression. Everything fell away as he dropped to his knees beside his lover, who was white as a sheet and oozing so much blood, Remus was sure there couldn’t be any left within the man.
Without so much as waiting for any questions or comments, Dumbledore ended the fire call, leaving Severus quite annoyed and Harry and Draco slightly confused.
“Actually, I wanted to go up to the Astronomy tower. I know we’re not allowed out of the castle now, but that’s technically still part of the castle, and I could use some fresh air.”
chance of the Dark Lord not knowing about his betrayal, he had to get to him before any other suspicions piqued. It was ultimately a simple question of doing what was safe, and doing what was in his best interest as a spy. The hard part was going to be his answer, which he knew Harry would fight tooth and nail against.
“Your father and I raised you better than this, Ron! Your taunting about Harry’s sexuality is no better than those who spout of about pure-blood supremacy. In the end, it is all just ignorant prejudice. You are not a stupid boy, but your actions of this past year have displayed that you can be an utter fool. What would your father say?”
“I wish someone would kiss
“We invoke the Debt and use it to get information out of him. This may be a long shot, but his proximity to the Dark Lord and his history of being an eavesdropper and traitor suggest he could know important information,” Lucius explained.
Remus had been awake since Draco had let the book fall unceremoniously to the coffee table, though he didn’t make it know until Draco was in the kitchen. He sat up and smiled at Severus, blinking the sleep from his eyes. “Sorry, I must have dozed off at some point. They didn’t burn the place down, right?”
Severus didn’t pause to explain, but continued up the spiral staircase to the infirmary, knowing that his son and godson would follow along. Once there, he laid Remus in the closest bed and swept the grey and tawny locks out of his eyes. Only a few minutes after Harry and Draco ran in, Poppy burst through the doors and made a bee-line for Remus.
Draco let out a sigh of relief, his shoulders relaxing as his sense of panic dwindled away. “Thank you, Harry. I promise…I’ll tell someone eventually.”
S~S~S~S
Harry tried to hide his laughter as he picked up a different catalogue. “You wear pants under all those robes and cloaks?” Harry asked with a snicker.
“But wait, that doesn’t make sense. The powers that he transferred to you are the ones ‘the Dark lord knows not’? How is that possible, if they’re his own powers?” Draco asked, becoming a little lost by Harry’s explanation.
Severus smirked as his eyes twinkled disturbingly similar to the late Headmaster, who snuffled in his sleep in the portrait behind the Headmistress. “Oh I doubt that, Minerva. Albus was as barmy as they come, and he was never admitted.”
Harry could only think of one option, even though he had told his father it would be a stupid move mere minutes ago. He didn’t have time to think just then; he preferred not to be cooked alive, thanks. “
S~S~S~S
S~S~S~S
“Give me a bloody second, will you?! I’ve just had Voldemort poking around in my head; it’s not a good feeling!” Harry shouted as his head pounded harder and harder.
The fire burst into brilliant green flames and Remus stepped out, carrying two heavy trunks underneath his arms. “Well, Dumbledore had a right fit about all of this.”
Harry paused at the closed door to the bedroom his parents shared, hesitating for only a second before Draco’s nod encouraged him to knock. There was not a long wait before Severus answered the door wearing a pair of sleep pants and a dressing gown that hung open, exposing his bare chest.
“I am, Dad.”
...” Severus heard Remus’ voice moaning behind him. He could also hear the sound of someone else hyperventilating, and a short scuffle before a heart wrenching wail echoed off of the tiles around them. Draco was being held firmly in Remus’ grasp, his face screwed up in utter anguish as tears streamed down his cheeks.
“What if I made Draco take a Wizard’s Oath not to discuss what he may or may not see while teaching you? Would that make you feel comfortable enough to have him help you? I know that it’s hard to trust someone you’ve harboured ill feelings for after so long, but it’s not impossible; look at us. I don’t believe Draco is anymore a threat to you than Remus or myself. He can help you, Harry,” Severus implored. This was too important to just let Harry give up that easily.
“Remus had to go back to wherever Voldemort is. He said he was on a mission for the Order under disguise and that’s how he got to you. We cleaned your wounds and Remus healed them. You had a few broken bones, but Remus healed those, too. You have a concussion as well, so you should take it easy for awhile. Remus said he would inform the Order that I was here alone with you, but I haven’t heard anything from anyone since he left nearly four hours ago,” Harry said, a bit miffed that no one had bothered to come check up on him or Snape. Didn’t they even care that he had nearly died? Yes, Remus had sent Charlie to tell Dumbledore, but didn’t he want to check on Snape himself?
There were many more people than the previous year gathered in the Room of Requirement. Harry looked around, amazed at the number of people, and blanched when they all look to him for direction. He cast Hermione a pleading look and she took pity, taking the lead.
“Wish someone would have done that for me in the first place, though it was quite fun to see Hagrid scare the hell out of the Dursleys,” Harry said with a sad little smile, remembering that those Dursleys were gone now, and it was because Death Eaters had been trying to get to Harry. He had no love lost on their account, but every human life was worth something, even if Harry didn’t particularly like them.
Remus felt his stomach do a flip as he felt Severus’ smooth hand in his own. He’d never seen or heard the Potions Master so very vulnerable as he was now, and he couldn’t deny the man the comfort he so craved. Remus sighed as he sat back down beside Severus, surprised when the man leaned against him and how easy it was to wrap an arm around him and pull him closer. He didn’t know what to say, so he didn’t say anything at all.
“But then how am I supposed to use the Elder wand against Voldemort. A wand won’t work against its true master, will it?” Harry asked incredulously. He should have known better than to think that this would be simple.
“Alright, I’ll stay.”
“Maybe because we are,” he muttered back before smiling up at the group. “Did you guys need something?” he asked politely, reaching for his own tea cup to take a quick sip.
Harry blushed slightly and frowned as he thought about his invisibility cloak, the Marauder’s map, and his Firebolt. He was lucky he had his wand still. “Yes, sir. I don’t suppose anything was salvageable?”
Without saying a word, Remus climbed into bed beside his husband, scooting close to wrap his arm around the man’s waist and lean his head on Severus’ shoulder. He felt Severus relax in his embrace, moving down to wrap his arms around the werewolf in return.
“I think, perhaps, there needs to be some sort of payment,” said Severus, his voice far away as he rolled up the left sleeve of his Muggle coat. The Dark Mark that marred his flesh was on full display, and suddenly the air around them became thick.
Hermione frowned as she turned back to her diagram and continued to write. Perhaps Ron had a point, but it seemed as though he didn’t really try very hard. She loved him, but she wished he made more of an effort in the relationship.
But he had to wait. They knew all but one of the Horcruxes now, and Hermione’s research may have uncovered the very last one. Once it was found, that would be Harry’s cue. Until then, he’d nod and agree that they’d find a way, that he wouldn’t worry, that everything would work out in the end. Until then, he’d ride this downward spiral until it hit rock bottom once and for all.
“Not since breakfast.”
“Five deaths in the Order, but the final death count for Death Eaters has not been revealed yet. Lucius Malfoy was among the Order deaths, as well as Nymphadora Tonks. Draco was with his father when he passed. I’m sorry, Harry.”
Severus leaned back in his seat and fixed Harry with a pointed gaze. Dumbledore had come to him near the end of the semester to ask him about lowering his expectations for his N.E.W.T.s course, and he had considered it for a little while, but hadn’t really made up his mind. If he did lower the minimum grade requirement, Harry would still be able to take all the Auror required courses. The fact that Severus was actually considering changing course material for Harry Potter made his very skin crawl, but his mind seemed to have made itself up.
“He’s got it. I sent him home for help,” Remus answered quickly as he countered a curse shot at Severus, hitting the Death Eater with both the man’s own curse and one of his own. Before Severus could respond, there was a terrifying female scream from the building two doors down; Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlour. It sounded like Hermione.
“Well, no, I don’t think I’ll even be allowed in the room, but I figured that I should come up with questions for the Headmaster to ask, just in case. See, I know my father, and I know what he will and will not find easy to misdirect about,” Draco said confidently, his looping script writing out question ninety-seven.
Now, what remained of the homely cottage was protected by certain wards to preserve what was left of the establishment. The garden no longer flourished as it once had, the white picket fence was gray and weather worn and the cottage itself looked as though it had been dissected and left open for the world to see. Of course, only those of magical blood could see the ruins. To Muggles, it looked like an empty stretch of land that had a ‘for sale’ sign, but no contact information for possible buyers.
The rest of the week passed by very quickly, a comfort to Harry, who had grown increasingly lonely and missed his best friends dearly. He was excited for the new school year to start up so that the castle would be teeming with students instead of cold and deathly silent. Just after dinner on the last day before the other students would arrive, Dumbledore asked Harry to come up to his office to talk about some things.
Tom watched the Headmaster disappear through the door behind his desk, smirking when the door closed behind the old man. Glancing to the right, he saw the glint of the candle light reflecting off of a sword; Godric Gryffindor’s sword. He stepped over, reaching out a hand to smooth his finger down the side of the blade. The rubies that glittered in the hilt looked like molten fire. He trailed a hand over the jewels, and felt a surge of glee when he felt one of the rubies come loose at his touch. He caught the red stone and quickly placed it in an inner pocket of his robes.
Remus nodded slowly as he played with the filigree clasp connecting the two sides of the expensive cloak. “I moved out of our room the day after the memorial service. I left all of his stuff untouched, but this I kept. I think…I think maybe you should have this, Harry,” Remus said, holding the cloak out to the frowning teen.
“Albus Dumbledore was my boss, my mentor, my saviour, and the father I never had. He took me in when I most needed it, and he gave me the second chance that I did not believe I deserved. While the man made many mistakes, he was only human, and though we expected so much more from him, he had his faults. He was powerful not only in magical ability, but in presence alone, and just the mention of his name is enough to cause a stir.
Harry smiled warmly at his friend, sighing as he pulled her into a messy hug. He’d be so lost without her, it was painfully obvious. “What would I do without you?” he muttered into her hair, earning himself a small chuckle as Hermione pulled away from the hug.
Remus had taken on the task of looking through Severus’ most personal belongings; things that required passwords because they were warded. So far none of them had had any luck, but Remus thought Harry might be on to something. He was glad that the rest of the room went back to their own business when Harry moved close to him, making it clear this wasn’t a public discussion now.
They met at the door, and the tension between them was almost palpable. Harry stood back and allowed Draco to pass through the door first before following, closing the heavy door behind them. The thick silence in the corridor felt oppressive and mocking, like the walls knew that the two teens were trying their hardest not to seem awkward around each other.
Harry grinned even as he scoffed slightly, pushing Severus’ hand away half-heartedly. “I guess I’ll take that as a compliment,” he said, though it came out as more of a question than a statement.
He was lost in his pondering when he heard what sounded like a song being chanted, the rest of the noise in the ward strangely gone. He looked up and saw the Head Healer of St. Mungo’s tracing the wounds littering Severus, chanting the counter-curse three times in a row. Remus stood and moved a bit closer, gasping when he saw the torn and sliced flesh begin to meld and knit itself back together, the skin raw and red. After the third incanting, another Healer moved forward and began to treat the healed wounds with Essence of Dittany, but even after two applications, the scars would not fade.
“The only problem with that is the need to get close to him. If someone tries to walk up and just stab him with a muggle knife, no one will ever get close enough,” said Tonks.
“Oye!”
Severus laughed mirthlessly as he gently pulled his wrist away from the Healer, wanting the tingling that travelled up his arm to go away – to go far,
“You’ve got to be joking. The Dark Lord uses beauty potions to sustain himself? That would be a good opportunity, if we had inside help. Do we have anyone on the inside?”
“Harry, we didn’t hear you come in. Sit; we’ve a lot to talk about,” Severus said, moving reluctantly away from his lover to face his son and godson, curled up together in a single armchair.
Harry was staring at the redhead as if he had grown three more red heads to join the first. He’d been prepared for Ron to insult Draco and say that it was good riddance if he didn’t want Harry anymore, but he was certainly not prepared for the level-headed reassurance he’d received.
“Albus, it is spreading,” Severus said in shock, moving forward as if to grasp the Headmaster’s arm.
“Settle yourself, you idiot child. I’m not going to harm you; I just need to perform a few spells to see if you’re injured internally at all. Sit still a moment,” said Severus as he waved his wand in a wide arch over Harry, murmuring in Latin under his breath.
“Congratulations, Severus. I wish you all the luck in the interview process.”
“Boys, that’s enough! Draco I need to speak with you about something. Come, join me in the kitchen,” Severus snapped as his patience started to wane already. This would be a long night, he could feel it already.
to defend him. I’m sure you know how that feels, having a father whose reputation isn’t a very good one. It’s easy to get defensive. Remus was just defending the one he loves, the same way I defended you when Ron and Ginny started to have a problem with you. I’m sorry...” Harry trailed off as he noticed the shell shocked look on Draco’s face, and the faint squeak of surprise he heard behind him from Hermione. Uh oh, what did he say wrong?
“One more question, and I’ll be out of your hair entirely. Professor Snape, as you know, the Ministry is a little prejudiced when it comes to single parent adoptions. They always prefer that the child have a steady, balanced home with both a male and female influence in their home life. You listed yourself as single, but sometimes prospective parents who have not married yet are simply still dating. Is there anyone you consider to be your significant other that could, perhaps in future, become a second parent to Harry?”
Harry sighed and nodded, appreciating Draco’s comforting weight even more as the Slytherin practically crawled into his lap like a house cat. “A little, but I’ll be alright. Severus will be there, and it’s not like I haven’t talked to the Weasleys a million times before.”
if it’s all for nothing! Now I’d like a moment alone with my godson, if you wouldn’t mind,” Severus snapped, clearly dismissing Remus rather than asking for some privacy.
Severus Snape sat in a large chintz arm chair, gazing out the window into the stormy night. He watched as the rain splashed off the dirty bricks of the surrounding houses and formed a muddy puddle in the middle of the cobble stoned street.
“Yes, Harry, I do already know it. My point in asking you to repeat it is to see if
“We’ll discuss the memory later and much more in private. Did you leave Albus alone in his office?” Severus asked as he began to lead the way out of the Great Hall, Harry beside him and Remus behind them. It was starting to become extremely obvious that the three of them were more than just Professors and student; they were so often seen together whenever trouble came round.
Harry blinked and shook his head, finally coming out of his depressing reverie as Remus spoke to him. “Sorry...Started thinking and lost track of time,” he claimed, knowing he should just open up the trunk and dump his belongings in, but hesitating anyways.
Remus smiled warmly as he stood up and crossed the room. When he reached Snape’s armchair, he reached out a hand and tugged Severus to his feet, surprising the man, who hadn’t noticed he had crossed the room. Standing face to face with the Potions Professor and pulling him close, Remus whispered gently, “We all make mistakes, Severus. The real test lies in learning from those mistakes.” He leaned in and pressed his lips firmly to Severus’, moaning lightly as Severus returned the kiss with much passion.
“Alright, thank you, Severus.” There was a slightly awkward pause while the two men simply smiled shyly at each other. Remus finally took the initiative, knowing he would have to make all the moves as the Gryffindor in the ‘relationship’, and leaned down to gently press his lips against the slightly shorter man’s.
” Hermione gasped as she spilled her ink well across the table. With a muttered oath, she whipped her wand out and siphoned the ink away, still looking directly at Harry with the familiar look of brilliant epiphany on her face.
Severus was secretly glad that Harry had decided not to leave with the Weasleys. Selfish as it was, he was hoping their first Christmas as father and son would happen that year. Shortly after the two youngest Weasleys bid their farewell to Harry and Hermione, Remus informed Severus that an owl had been looking for him at dinner in the Great Hall.
“No, Harry, not Obliviate. Cursed memories cannot be destroyed while in the mind, but they can be removed. So the best way to end the curse is to extract the memory and store it, either in a pensieve or a special bottle made for storing memories. Once the memory is in a pensieve there is a way to exorcise the curse from it, but it takes very strong and advanced magic. The hard part is, we have to wake Draco up and have him willingly think of the memory in order to extract it from him,” said Remus as he pulled out his wand and summoned a small green vial in which memories could be magically stored and preserved.
“Do you think it’s Voldemort?” Harry asked in a small voice, feeling completely lost. It didn’t feel like a vision, his scar never hurt afterwards, and Occluding didn’t do anything to prevent the dreams from coming. Even Dreamless Sleep was ineffective, proving that it wasn’t actually a dream after all.
“I know, son, I know.”
Remus smiled as he pulled away, still with eyes only for the Potions Master. “Teenagers...” he drawled in a precise mimic of Severus’ voice, earning a smirk from the man and chuckles from the teens. It had been a wonderful Christmas indeed.
Severus thought for a moment about that as he finished his cup of tea and conjured two fresh ones; one for him, and the other he handed to Remus.
“Well obviously the Weasleys would be the best option. They already consider you a part of their family, and I know Molly would have adopted you straight away if Dumbledore had let her. They’ll have no problem adopting you and agreeing to the bonding.”
“The Weasleys! They’d do it, I know they would. They already count me as part of their family,” Harry said excitedly, feeling his spirits soar as he thought about being a real part of Ron’s family. His good mood was shattered then, as he remembered that Ron hated him now. Dumbledore seemed to have sensed his inner turmoil.
“Yeah, I wish I could ask Remus, but I know the Ministry would never let him adopt me. I guess I’ll need some time to really think about it. Maybe I could talk to Ron and Ginny, try to patch things up and then talk to the Weasleys...” Harry trailed off, more talking to himself than the Headmaster. He distractedly finished his biscuit and finished his cup of tea, grateful that Dumbledore was letting him ramble and organize his confused thoughts. He really wanted to go see Draco.
Harry was out of breath, as if he’d just run a mile instead of screaming at the top of his voice at the Headmaster, his mentor and who he thought was his friend. The old man looked so tired and defeated that Harry began to feel guilty for his ranting.
“How can you defend this man, Harry? He’s part of the reason that Sirius is dead,” Remus said viciously, not taking notice of how Severus stiffened beside him.
“You look it, too. I just came to do a quick check-up on Draco before I have to do rounds at Mungo’s. I won’t be too long,” she assured the Potions Professor as she pulled out Draco’s chart and began scanning it over.
Harry was glad that he was invisible because he couldn’t help the amused grin that spread across his face at this suggestion. “Yeah, that’ll work. You’re sure you don’t mind?”
“None taken,” he replied lazily.
No, he couldn’t think of anything that he missed from the Muggle world. Nothing, except the anonymity. Going from living an almost invisible existence to suddenly being the most recognised face in every room he entered had been a shock to the system and it was something that Harry had never quite grown accustomed to. If he thought that he was famous before the war, it was nothing compared to the level of near-hysteria that followed him everywhere that he went now. It was another reason that he had seldom ventured beyond the boundaries of The Burrow all summer except for official engagements. Everywhere that he went, reporters and groups of ‘fans’ lay in wait for him. Harry didn’t know how they always seemed to know where he was going to be, but their pursuit of him had been relentless, and they were the main reason that he had been so reluctant to venture out to Diagon Alley for his school supplies. Today, however, Harry wasn’t going to let anyone deter him from a day out with his friends and family. Today, Harry came prepared.
Minerva’s head snapped away from the festivities and towards Liv in surprise, “The same evening as Potter and his friends fight in the Department of Mysteries.”
Harry snatched the script out of Ginny’s hands, his eyes darting back and forth across the page as he read and reread the scene. His heart began thudding painfully in his chest; there was no mistaking what it meant. “I need to kiss Malfoy?”
“Fuck no,” Harry ground out. “Keep going.”
“Are you in any pain?” she asked.
“That’s quite enough canoodling, boys,” she said brusquely. “Gather your things and depart the train, please.”
Harry looked surprised. “Uh, yeah. I did say that.”
“No, don’t do that. I think if Dennis really wanted you to leave, he would have told you to already,” Neville argued. “I think he’s just angry. Not necessarily at you, just angry about what happened to Colin, and maybe angry at himself for not being able to prevent it. We’ve all been there, sometimes when we’re angry and upset, we push people away. The best thing that we can do in situations like that is to stay put so that when they’re ready to talk, they’ll know that they’re not alone.”
He could feel himself rambling, keenly aware of Harry’s eyes watching him closely with a smile teasing his lips. Harry gave a slight shrug. “Maybe it is. I guess the only way to know for sure is to take them both out for a ride: contrast and compare.” There was a pregnant pause before he added, “Mine’s definitely bigger, though.”
“What on earth are you talking about, Granger?” asked Draco.
Draco slipped his hand beneath Harry’s trousers and boxers, taking the hot, firm flesh of Harry’s cock into his hand and swiping his thumb over the wet tip. Harry’s response was immediate; his breath stuttered and he clamped his eyes shut, pressing his forehead into Draco’s shoulder.
“It’s your line,” she hissed out of the corner of her mouth. Goyle looked flustered at being addressed and gave his head a quick shake.
“Yes, it’s quite a lot of responsibility but Professor Tonks thinks that I’ll manage...”
“I need to talk to you,” said Harry. The corners of Draco’s mouth twitched as though he were trying to suppress a smile.
“Like you’re any better,” Harry shot back and Draco chuckled.
Harry made to bypass the Halloween party for the Grand Staircase, but the noise within made both he and Draco pause. The music was no longer playing and there was a lot of shouting and screaming pouring out of the Great Hall. Harry and Draco shared a concerned look before they both hurried over to see what was happening. As they pushed open one of the heavy doors to the Great Hall, the sight that met them was one of absolute chaos: the room was packed with students and teachers, and it seemed like everyone was either shouting or crying. Several people had both hands covering their mouths but seemed unable to stop talking, their eyes wide with alarm.
“It’s more familiar territory,” said Draco, looking up at Harry. “You shouldn’t be so nice to me.”
“I don’t know what you’re on about,” he replied weakly.
Harry felt the heat rise in his cheeks. “Uh, yeah. I suppose so…”
Draco laughed gently. “You wish!”
“It’s a hand game Muggles play,” he explained. “Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: either a rock, a ball of paper, or scissors—” Draco cleared his throat and raised his bandaged hands. Harry looked down at his own bandaged limbs and his shoulders sagged. “Oh, right...”
“I take that you liked the gift then,” Harry grinned and eagerly complied, practically tearing off his boxers and t-shirt before lying on the bed with his face pressed against a pillow. “I’ve never had a massage before.”
She hastily scribbled a note on the front page of the script, tapped it with her wand again, and a moment later the script began to flap its pages like the wings of a bird before it soared out of the classroom and down the corridor out of sight.
“At the very least, can we settle for not pulling our wands on each other this year?” he suggested. “I’d like to have at least one year free from mortal peril. Or detention.”
Ron snorted. “‘Course I haven’t.”
Slowly, he opened his eyes and found himself in familiar surroundings: the coniferous hedges that ran either side of the wide driveway were topped with snow like a Christmas pudding, giving the place a deceptively welcoming appearance. In the distance, he saw that the wrought-iron gates had been left open—evidently, his parents were expecting his arrival. Drawing his wand, he tapped the top of his trunk once and it rose off of the snow-covered ground to waist-height. He slipped his wand back into its holster and began the long walk up the gravel path towards home, his trunk silently following him in his wake.
“Are you taking the piss?” he hissed.
Professor Switch, Liv and Hestia shared worried glances with one another but Professor McGonagall’s eyes never wavered from Dennis. “You’re also responsible for damaging the girls’ bathroom on the second floor.” Dennis nodded. “And for setting off those fireworks in the Great Hall this afternoon?”
Draco wasn't smiling anymore. He slowly turned to face Harry, looking him up and down as though sizing him up. Harry braced himself in case he needed to grab his wand...so much for staying out of trouble.
“Oh! Yes, thank you…”
“It was either that or we risked him making us his famous treacle fudge. I figured the rock cakes were the lesser of two evils.”
“Well, I’m not going to lose any sleep over Malfoy missing our Transfiguration lesson,” said Ron. “It’s bad enough that we need to put up with him in Muggle Studies.”
“I...um...yeah, don’t worry about it,” he stammered.
“Would you like to hear my suggestion or would you rather wallow in self-pity? Because if it’s the latter, I’ve got better things to be doing with my time.”
and panting hard. It took him a few moments to regain his faculties and slowly, he opened his eyes and looked up into Draco’s face. He was wearing an expression that Harry had never seen before, almost like he was drunk—drunk on Harry. There was a hunger in his eyes too, one that Harry could imagine the origin of all too well since he could feel the same want tear at him from the inside. The sight made him groan and he pulled Draco forward and kissed him hard, hoping to convey in one kiss the storm of emotions raging inside of him. When he finally pulled away, he pressed his forehead into Draco’s shoulder and sighed.
“You can hold her if you want,” Harry offered, but Draco declined.
Draco tried to push past Harry but was stopped by his large trunk which blocked the path along the narrow corridor. He turned to Harry and looked impatiently at him.
“Finally, something that we can both agree on,” Snape muttered.
“Who cares?” said Ron. “We’ve got more important things to worry about than Malfoy. Like acting in this bloody play! What’s that all about?”
Harry took the vial and hesitated only a moment before drinking it down in one gulp. It tasted and felt like acid, burning as it slid down his throat. He coughed and spluttered, trying to keep the potion down. “That’s horrible,” he complained as he pushed the vial back towards Snape.
“You see her, Harry?” the Potions Master asked in a strangled voice, his pallid skin so pale now it was slightly worrying. Remus reached for Severus’ hand under the table and gave it a reassuring squeeze.
Harry was glad for Draco’s perceptiveness as the blonde held his arms open and allowed him to fall apart once more, his face buried in his boyfriend’s neck as he wrapped himself completely around the taller teen.
“Dear Merlin, Harry, you have more lives than a cat. So are these Horcruxes destroyed? What’s the plan? Why am I here?”
Draco could not see through his tears as he desperately continued to send healing spells at his father’s back, but once he had moved the man’s robes aside, it was clear no healing spells would fix this. Muscle and tissue – even bone – were exposed, and there was so, so much blood.
“You don’t need to remind me, Hermione, I remember just fine,” Harry said with a deep frown as he looked over at Draco, who just kissed him firmly on the lips.
take points if I catch any of you out after curfew.”
Draco clasped his hand and squeezed it reassuringly, pulling Harry’s hand away from his eyes and kissing him gently on the forehead. “We’ll help you figure this out, Harry. You’re not alone in this.”
“Stop them!”
“Why did he let you go? Did he learn everything he wanted to know?” Hermione asked, her expression quite interested. She had been listening intently the entire time, the same way she did when she was trying to figure out a hard Arithmancy problem.
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat, torn between clinging to the Professor to keep him from leaving and punching him square in the jaw. He nodded his head jerkily, regretting it even as he did it. “I understand, sir…Please, be careful,” Harry said, his voice constricted as he watched the older man nod briskly, walk into the bedroom and step into the floo. The last thing he saw from the Potions Master was a surprising reassuring smile before the man disappeared in bright green flames.
“Draco Malfoy, and I am, I promise. So you knew my dad when he came here, eh?” Draco asked curiously. It would be odd to see his father at his age, how he looked and acted. Was Draco really so much like him?
“We have to get through rules and etiquette before any real duelling can happen. Some of you may be familiar with duelling already, but unfortunately most of your classmates are complete novices to the art,” Severus responded, flicking his wand behind him to make sure the doors of the Great Hall locked.
There was a loud commotion as the Professors all came out from behind their own personally erected shield spells, rushing towards Harry and Draco, who made a clumsy landing in the centre of the camp. Harry quickly scanned the teachers and realized his father and Remus were not there.
“Think of it as a clean slate, Harry. The past is the past, and Draco will learn that not everything he once believed is still true. I’m not guaranteeing anything, Harry, but I don’t think Draco’s feeling towards you will change as he gets his memories back.”
“I just happened to notice. It’s not like I follow you around or something,” Hermione snapped, opening her book once more and disappearing behind it.
“I vote we talk in a very wide open space next time. Like outside, where there aren’t any walls,” Ron suggested, his voice very close to a croak as the colour slowly returned to his pallid cheeks.
Harry frowned, feeling even more confused now then when he was reading the sodding book. It wouldn’t hurt to try, he supposed. “Alright, so what do I do? Just say the spell, try to detect your emotions somehow and try to read your body language?” Harry asked as he awkwardly pulled his wand and scooted back so that he was sitting face to face with Snape.
“You’re right, it is very unfair, but Remus understands my reasoning and accepts my decisions. He knows what he means to me, and I wish I could acknowledge him as my lover to the entire Wizarding world, but it’s not that easy, Harry. I hope for your sake, the media will make an exception with your sexuality because of your celebrity status,” Severus said, hoping Harry would be as understanding as Remus had been.
“Why did you stun them? So you can get all the glory from your Master when you take me to him?” Harry egged on, having lost any ideas for escape that he might have had before.
As his tears dried and his shaking came under control, Harry looked up to see that Remus had his head resting on Severus’ shoulder. He watched as Severus kissed the other man gently on the forehead, unknowing of their audience. Harry smiled, feeling completely content for the first time in a long time. He had two loving parents, who loved each other and were not afraid to show it, and were proud of him. One of his dreams had finally come true.
Harry had his eyes closed for a good fifteen minutes before his breathing evened and his body relaxed. If it wasn’t for his standing position, it would have looked like Harry had fallen asleep himself. He slowly opened his eyes, keeping the forest scene in the back of his mind as he moved towards Draco’s bed and the chair beside it.
The Potions Master was still spoiling for a fight, and wanted nothing more than to knock that smug look from Lucius Malfoy’s face. It was obvious that it was getting him nowhere, however, so Severus decided he would let it go, for now. Soon enough, the rest of the Order would come to see how sadistic this man really was.
“There are a few different potions that can reverse the affects of polyjuice. However, this one should clear the potion out of his system, even though it is a universal antidote, used for many different potions,” said Severus as he pulled a blue vial out of his inner-robe pocket.
S~S~S~S
Harry Potter woke abruptly in the middle of the night feeling as if a bucket of icy water had just been thrown on him. He squinted around the dark room for a few seconds before he remembered to put his glasses on. Even with the blurriness gone, he still couldn’t see anything out of the ordinary in his small bedroom, but that slight sense of foreboding that had fallen into the pit of his stomach when he awoke was still there. Harry carefully pulled his blankets away from himself as he withdrew a long, slender wand from beneath his pillow.
to go, and you
Harry looked over as Severus unfolded his own jumper, which was a beautiful muted sapphire. The lack of adornment was obvious, but that could only be considered a good thing, in Severus’ opinion. He cocked an eyebrow as Harry smirked at him, and Remus chuckled softly, holding up his own ruby jumper.
Harry wanted to protest and demand that the Potions Master see reason, but he knew that this wasn't about him, it was about Draco. He left the room without another word, nearly running into Draco in the hallway.
Remus felt a pang of guilt as he remembered his promise to keep Harry informed. He had been so worried about Severus and lost in his own grief that he had allowed himself to forget about his son. Taking a deep breath to pull himself together, Remus stood and nodded his consent.
“He’ll still be under the effects, Dad,” Harry reminded the Potions Master.
With a nod from the redhead, Draco took a deep breath, grabbing hold of one of Ron’s arms, his other hand gripping Hermione’s shoulder. He turned on the spot, and they were sucked into the tight ring of apparition. The landing was rough, as he’d never Side-Alonged with more than one person before.
Severus blew out a frustrated breath, knowing the old man was right, but not willing to admit he could be wrong. He decided a negotiation of the situation was in order. “You’ll use only my serum, and I want to watch the entire thing in your Pensieve after it is done. Deal?”
Remus smiled and nodded. It had been a while since he had been able to talk candidly to Harry, and he had missed the boy. “Yes. It means dream in French. Did you know I was born in France? I can even speak French.”
“What the
There was a murmur around the room that could have been counted as assent, but Harry’s hand shot up immediately. He waited patiently as Severus tried to ignore him as long as possible before finally sighing heavily and nodding at Harry to speak.
“I have
A funeral for the Headmaster was scheduled for that following weekend. Dumbledore’s death had been announced as headline news in the
“Foolish question, Severus. He was subjected to quite a bit of questioning under Veritaserum, not to mention a bit of torture here and there,” the blonde answered, giving the Potions Professor a look that said he should have known better, and that the torturing was most likely done by his own hand.
The portrait slid open smoothly to reveal Draco fully dressed in black slacks, a soft white cardigan, and charcoal grey robes that brought out his eyes magnificently. Harry almost forgot what he’d come for, other than to snog the Slytherin senseless. He blinked and shook himself as Draco’s eyebrow shot up, his expression one of obvious displeasure.
Remus cocked his head, curious why Harry would pick that time-frame. “Why fifth to seventh, Harry? Perhaps he didn’t create it until well into his Death Eater years. That would seem more likely to me. Severus…wasn’t a pleasant person, even as a teen, but I never thought he would create something so dark.”
“Draco, what’s the last thing you can remember?”
Remus was about to get up and leave when he received an armful of Harry. He smiled as he wrapped his arms around the teen, holding him close. He realized that Harry was lingering in the hug a little too long and pulled away to see his eyes drooping. Remus gently pulled the blankets up around Harry as he laid back down. He was already asleep when Remus left the room.
Remus moved around the classroom as he spoke, watching carefully as the Slytherins glared at the Gryffindors from opposing sides of the room. He had flashbacks to the Duelling Club in his Hogwarts years, and made a mental note to discuss starting one up again with Severus and Dumbledore.
“Ooh we could dress her up in cute little outfits and do her hair!” Draco exclaimed, causing both Severus and Remus to burst out laughing.
“Does the Prophet say where Wool’s Orphanage was located?”
“Please try to keep the classroom intact!” Severus shouted, sending a powerful
“This is the memory you used as the anchor to pull Draco out of his coma, isn't it?”
“I can bring him back.”
Severus’ brow creased as the blonde’s eyes flashed dangerously. Terrible didn’t even
S~S~S~S
Upstairs, away from the bustle of noise in the basement kitchen, Harry, Draco, and Sirius were also plotting. The emotions in the room were tense, but not because of Sirius, who was sitting in an armchair, twirling a lethal looking syringe in his thankfully corporeal hands.
“I didn’t include a picture because I think you should slightly alter your appearances, on the off chance that any magical folk are around and recognize you.”
Harry was shaking by the time he finished reading the article. Tonks, who he had just seen last night right before her shift, was missing, possibly abducted by the likes of Bellatrix Lestrange or Lucius Malfoy. He turned to Severus and Remus, who were sharing concerned and apprehensive expressions.
Healer Smithson had warned them all about the mood swings that would accompany Draco’s memory recognition. The change in his brain activity as new memories came into play would spike Draco’s irritation, as only certain memories would return, and sometimes only partially. It was already extremely infuriating having no idea who you were, but adding in half complete memories that made little to no sense would only make it worse.
“Severus, how is he, do you know?” Remus asked as he hurried forwards towards the Potions Master.
The wand. The Elder Wand. Harry could use the Elder Wand against the Dark Lord, without having issues of twin wand cores. He knew Albus had had the Elder wand at one point because he knew Grindelwald’s history and obsession with the Deathly Hallows, but he had never spoken to Albus about it. He knew, though, he was sure of it. The wand entombed with the late Headmaster had to be the Elder Wand. Could this be the opening Severus was waiting for?
“I’ve never tried to kill Draco or deliver him to the Dark Lord for torture, have I? I’ve done nothing but protect and treat him as my own, even when you
“Are you ready, Harry?”
Remus chuckled lightly as he reached out and moved a lock of Severus’ hair out of his eyes. “Just thinking about how nice it is to have a Knight in shining armor to come rescue me from the rude little Wizards,” Remus said in amusement.
“Nervous?” Draco asked as he rubbed Harry’s arms, feeling his own heart flutter with nerves. He had wanted to go into the shop with Harry as well, but they had all agreed a group of three people would just be too suspicious. As it was, Harry and Remus were going to enter Borgin and Burkes at separate times so that it looked as though they weren’t associated at all. Draco didn’t like it, but he accepted it.
Emmeline and Dedalus rushed forward, shouting a spell Tonks didn’t recognize to open the door. She followed just behind, and managed to shield her companions from another stunner. There was a loud bang as the door they had just come through opened once more, admitting Kingsley and Fred and George Weasley.
Remus fidgeted with his robes, holding tightly to his wand, which was stuck up his sleeve for quick access. He looked around distractedly as people gave their odd entourage strange looks. “Are you sure this was a wise idea, Severus? We could easily have gotten the boys’ supplies for them and left them home. We still haven’t apprehended the ones who attacked Harry earlier this summer.”
“It’s time we both sat you and Draco down and discussed some things. You’re both at an age now where urges are hard to resist, especially considering all of the stress you’ve both been and will be under – ”
Harry sighed heavily, not looking up to meet his father’s eyes. “Er...I can’t tell you. Dumbledore made me promise not to tell anyone besides Ron and Hermione.”
“Alright, I’ll actually go to sleep tonight.” Harry paused at the door of his room and looked back down the hall at Severus, offering him a small smile. “Are you nervous, Sev?”
Severus’ eyebrows rose nearly into his hairline, his arms crossed tight over his chest. Why had Dumbledore not told him about this immediately? Did he not have a right to know about these things while protecting the Gryffindor as he was?
Severus sighed as he led the way out of the bedroom, through the living room and into the kitchen. “I’m not a good teacher, Harry, I’m only a sufficient instructor when I choose to be,” Severus said as he started to pull out a few ingredients to make dinner.
group?”
Hermione sighed as she pushed her mashed potatoes around her plate disinterestedly. “During the attack on Diagon Alley, do you remember any of the spells the Death Eaters used when they attacked Harry and Malfoy?” she said, launching straight into the point of the matter. She’d been worried Ron would avoid the question out of sheer spite, so she’d dallied in asking.
S~S~S~S
“The wound should be healed up, now. The last potion you need is Dreamless Sleep, but I do believe I agreed to answer your questions first, so,” Severus pulled a straight backed chair beside the bed and sat down, crossing his legs rather stiffly as he gestured towards Harry, “Ask away.”
Draco stepped out of the tent to make sure their spell work had worked only on the inside, without altering the outside appearance. So far, so good. “Well, it was nearly an exact replica of the Chateau on the continent, but nowhere as enormous as the Manor.”
an eight year old. He was never allowed to be soft with Lucius around; his spy status would be too much at stake. That was his excuse for being so hard on his students over the years, though eventually that just became his nature; mean greasy old Snape, the Potions Professor of Hogwarts.
“That was my doing as well, Potter. I overheard the mission that the Dark Lord was sending them on; they were to kill
“This will be up to you, Harry, as you’re the one owed the Life Debt. Only you can invoke it,” Severus explained, still with that apologetic look. It was clear he thought the idea had merit; he just wished Harry didn’t have to make such a hard decision. His son had enough to worry about.
The Head of Slytherin and the young Gryffindor knelt together, facing each other. Harry offered his adoptive father a small smile and received a hesitant grin in return. This was it, the final step that would ensure Harry’s safety, and forever bind him to his adoptive father. He was ecstatic, but he was also slightly humbled. Harry remembered his birth parents, the people who had died to give him life, and felt an upsurge of gratefulness. His mother’s sacrifice couldn’t protect him any longer, but it had kept him alive until that time when he found an alternative in Severus, who had already vowed to protect him before they’d even met.
things to him. When I told him I would be moving in over here for the rest of the summer, he told me that he forbid me from leaving Grimmauld Place. The nerve of that daft old man! As if he had any say in where I choose to live! I grabbed my stuff and left. Oh, Charlie says he’s sorry he couldn’t finish the chess game, but he’s willing to have a rematch when he comes next to see you,” Remus added, not wanting Harry to think he was too temperamental with Dumbledore.
“From what I observed over lunch, and of his reactions regarding you after the attack, I believe that Harry has also grown to have certain affection for you as well, and he knows that you, in part, return that affection. What I want from you, Severus, is a promise that, if you continue to care for Harry the way you are, that you will not stop. I need to know that Harry is not being set up to be abandoned by another father-figure.”
“Minister?” Tonks called as she pushed the door all the way open. She had about five seconds to realize what was happening before Rodolphus Lestrange sent a stunning spell at her. He completed his task of securing the Minister before moving on to his next job.
“When you become a bit older, you will start to see the advantages of being a Legilimens. Sometimes it is not only comforting, but essential to know when somebody is lying to you or with-holding certain information. For somebody like myself, it is a matter of life and death to be a proper Occlumens and Legilimens. If you’re still harboring interest in becoming an Auror, I will inform you now that basic Occlumency and Legilimency skills are required to go through training.”
Harry’s voice whispering to him...
can’t stand her!” Hermione growled as she stomped her foot, glaring at the spot where Pansy had stood moments before.
Harry sent the bushy-haired girl a half-hearted glare. It was a good idea in theory, but considering it involved Harry confronting a Dementor, he wasn’t a huge fan of it. “Do you happen to have a Dementor stored somewhere amongst all of your books?”
“Oh thank Merlin,” Severus whispered in relief, placing a chaste kiss on the werewolf’s lips. There was a noise of impatience and a clearing of a throat above them, and the hug was broken as they all turned to look at Madam Pomfrey, who managed to look annoyed while still smiling.
Harry quickly folded it and shoved it in his pocket, not really wanting anyone to see it, least of all Hermione. “Just a letter from Tonks; she’s checking up on me after the whole Malfoy thing. She was there, too.”
“Now, now, Harry. Think – you had not yet figured out a way to even destroy the remaining Horcruxes, and you’ve not been gone long. Everyone will be too worried grieving over you to worry much about Voldemort, I assure you. Now, I made a grave mistake in not making some note of where I was going that night. I have no excuses, just my old age and concern for you. You’ll remember I had promised to take you with, but changed my mind last minute?”
“Please be careful,” Remus asked as he hugged his husband one more time, despite the fact that the man was wearing someone else’s likeness.
Harry snorted derisively as he tossed his book onto the coffee table. “I’m sure you are, but Draco is very good at being a stubborn prat, so good luck.”
Dobby nodded rapidly, all the while smiling over at Harry and making the Gryffindor feel slightly uncomfortable. “Of course, sirs, coming right up!” Another loud pop and Dobby was gone, preparing breakfast for two.
Remus, however, spent most of the day feeling like hell. He’d gone to Headquarters intending to stay there for his transformation, only to have Dumbledore tell him that he wasn’t allowed to use Headquarters for transformations anymore because it frightened the other Order members to know there was a werewolf in the house, whether it had Remus Lupin’s mind or not. Remus had promptly told Dumbledore what for and returned to Bristol, snapping irritably at Snape when he asked what had happened.
“I believe he called them Horcruxes. He said one was not a high price to pay in order to save the others.”
a heart.
“He’s dead, Harry, and I’ll be fine. Once my spine and nerves heal, I’ll have to go through some
“There’s something trying to get out, I think. Open the door, Tom.”
Severus let out a frustrated sigh but kept his temper in check. “We should get it done and over with now so that you can begin working with Harry. It is of the utmost importance that he learns quickly and properly, especially before Hogwarts starts up again.”
“I would hardly make a good escort for Harry, Severus. I would be so distracted, I’m afraid I’d let my guard down and something would happen. There’s bound to be some sort of trouble, what with that many Order members gathering, and Arthur’s death was not exactly a secret to the Wizarding world. After his promotion, he became an extremely important man; that
“In our last class, we discussed the use of modified shield charms to protect against rampant curses that are usually capable of breaching a standard shield charm. This is definitely a bit more challenging than learning a spell. The incantation is still
remember it, because Dementors can’t bring up memories you don’t possess. Dementors bring suppressed memories forward, your worst memories. You always hear the same thing, right?”
Remus nodded and leaned in for another kiss, brushing Severus hair out of his eyes as he pulled away. “Good luck, Severus. I love you,” he said quietly, smiling when Severus kissed him again.
S~S~S~S
“Oh Harry, please don’t let that Prophecy run your life. You are only in control of yourself; that’s it. Please stop taking on the weight of the world,” Severus insisted as he sat back down on the ottoman, pulling his son down beside him. He was feeling a bit lightheaded, but he did not want Harry worrying about him at the moment.
“I ran into Hermione on the way to breakfast; she said she may have had a breakthrough with Draco’s condition?” Remus said as he took the seat beside Severus, noticing how the man stiffened.
“Thank you, Minerva.”
There were a few minutes before the bell for the end of class as everyone moved all of the desks back to their original places. Harry was looking around for his book bag, which had been misplaced with all of the shifting of the desks.
Severus relaxed after a few more seconds of the forced hug and wrapped his arms around the teen clinging to him. He bent down and placed a gentle kiss atop the messy black hair, feeling extremely lucky to be able to cherish this boy when so many others who had loved him could not. “I love you too, Harry.”
“How are you doing, son?” Lucius asked as he sat down on his bed, motioning for Draco to join him.
There was a loud
Harry’s eyes met the over-bright, sad gaze of his stepfather and frowned. He hated that the man was obviously as hurt as he was, most likely even more so. “No, I don’t suppose I will be,” he said quietly, exchanging an understanding look with the werewolf.
“Draco...”
Harry turned back to the headstone before him and finally read the epitaph placed under the dates.
MacNair was fighting dirty. Many of the other Death Eaters were just sending Killing curses, trying to drop bodies as quickly as possible and move on, but not MacNair. He was sending gruesome, terrifying curses rapid fire: disemboweling, cutting, eviscerating spells that would mean a terrible ending to anyone unlucky enough to be hit.
As Harry felt the blast of spells hit Draco behind him, twenty or so Aurors turned up and quickly joined in on the battle, but the Death Eaters Apparated quickly away. Harry knelt down and whipped the cloak off of Draco, who was fully visible as whatever cocktail of curses he’d taken had lifted the Disillusionment charm. “Draco...” Harry whispered, horrified that the Slytherin had risked himself to protect him.
“But...but that post is cursed, every teacher can only teach one term,” Draco insisted vehemently.
“Why didn’t you tell me Dumbledore had left me stuff in his Will?” Harry snapped at his father, who looked rather taken aback at the sudden venomous attack after spending nearly an hour trying to console his distraught husband.
. Except for his diminished appearance from near starvation, he almost resembled his old self.
Severus stiffened at Remus’ words, suddenly knowing exactly what that letter was about. “The adoption appeal papers,” he said simply, his heart rate much faster than usual. He let out a deep sigh as Remus looked up at him with an encouraging smile, a slightly knowing look in his eyes.
“Oh, I beg to differ,” Remus muttered as he sat back and continued to stare disinterestedly at his book. He glanced up and found Severus’ burning gaze on him from across the room.
There was a sudden silence that took over the table as everyone digested the fact that Lucius had been there that night, and on the wrong side of things, and that disarming Voldemort seemed to be an impossible task. The group seemed to be fresh out of ideas as they all looked around at each other, waiting for more suggestions to arise, but none were forthcoming.
“There were three deaths yesterday, and not one of them was an Order member or Ministry official. Innocent bystanders were caught in the crossfire. That is not acceptable! We’ve been trained not only to defend ourselves, but others! Where did we go wrong?” Mad-Eye asked, though it sounded more like a statement than a question. The man seemed to be more blowing off some steam rather than really berating anyone present. After all, the occupants of the house were not the only members involved.
The Deputy Headmistress looked as though she didn’t exactly approve of what she was about to say, with her lips thinned and her back rigid. She met Hermione’s eye and relaxed a little at her gobsmacked expression. Of course the dear girl was horrified; no classes for a month!
Harry scowled darkly. “Remus has a big mouth.”
“What do you mean, Harry? Why can you tell us, but not them? That doesn’t make sense to me,” said Ron, his expression bewildered.
“So, Severus was kind enough to extend an invitation to dinner, but he said it was strictly up to you to inform us of what this was all about. Is everything alright, Harry? Ron and Ginny aren’t causing you any trouble again, are they?”
Lucius smiled indulgently at the witch, no doubt recalling fond memories of when he had imprisoned and questioned her. “Through cunning and ambition, of course. He was a member of Slytherin house when he attended Hogwarts, after all.”
“He also said our relationship is just a flight of fancy, and that it won’t last. I pretty much told him to stuff it, and if he’d had a wand, he would have hexed me up one side and down the other.”
Remus frowned. He knew that was coming, but it didn’t make it any easier to hear. He let out a sigh as he slowly pulled away from Severus, an apologetic look in his eyes. “I know, I’m sorry...It won’t happen again,” Remus whispered, swallowing the painful lump in his throat.
“What the hell? Granger and Weasley can know, but not me? That’s completely asinine!” Draco shouted, glaring at Harry. He hated feeling like, despite Weasley’s attitude in the beginning of the year towards Harry,
Harry felt a smile tugging at his lips as he walked through the infirmary doors and found Draco trying to levitate a quill with his wand, a look of deep concentration on his face. Harry had begun to teach him some simple spells, hoping that would help more memories break through. So far, Draco had only been able to pull off a weak
Remus stood up and moved closer to the Potions Professor, pulling the man into his arms. Severus seemed to turn to liquid as he felt arms wrap around him. He went limp, his knees buckling beneath him as he clutched onto Remus with all his might and sobbed into his shoulder. Remus used his extra strength to hold his lover up, pulling him close as their tears mingled together.
care what she says about Draco! I never said I would play reserve; you’re both taking the mickey. Snape’s rooms
Harry’s jaw dropped open as he moved forward and kneeled in front of the shiny new trunk. His old Hogwarts trunk had been second hand and battered and beaten from his many journeys. He traced the silver lettering on the front with the tip of his finger, feeling the smooth finish of the cedar. “I...You didn’t need to get me anything, sir...Thank you, Professor.”
“It’s easy to hide in a normal shirt sleeve or a robe. I got one too. They’re standard order for Auror training.”
“Right...I’ll remember that,” said Harry. He closed his bedroom door and ducked inside, his cheeks still stained red as he held out the envelope to Draco. “Looks like a creepy love letter.”
Peter was shaking and whimpering, fat tears leaking from the corners of his eyes. It was unclear if he was glad for the gift of keeping his life, or mourning the fact that he would spend the rest of that miserable life in Azkaban as per Harry’s request as a condition of releasing him from the Life Debt.
“Harry, come
“We’ll have to be very careful about this, but I think Harry is correct. We’ve called meetings based on Harry’s visions before; we’ll simply tell the Order that this is another one of those occurrences. It will be up to the few of us who know to deal with the Horcruxes, and let the rest of the Order cover us,” Severus said, feeling a very ominous feeling take over the room as everyone seemed to realize that this was it; this could mean the end of the war was near.
Remus stood and quickly made his way to the cottage, which was twenty feet away. He kicked the door open instead of trying to struggle with his wand. “Help, I’ve got Severus!” Remus yelled as two worried voices gave a shout of fright from the bedroom.
“The night I was taken, I was hit with a stunning spell. I had wards that would alert me if anyone came within ten feet of my patrol zone, just for security, but they never went off. I never saw it coming. The next thing I know, I’m laying on a bed in some strange room I’d never seen, tied up. I could hardly move, and I had a gag in my mouth so I couldn’t really make any noise. After about fifteen minutes of wondering about my fate, someone came into the room.” Tonks paused as she looked up at Draco. Her frown was enough to speak for her.
The tired slur in the boy’s voice, and the way he pleaded with Severus was the only reason the Potions Master didn’t go off on a tirade about respect. He let out a heavy, frustrated sigh as he picked up the shirt and undid the buttons, helping Harry into it and doing the buttons up with a quick flick of his wand. He allowed the boy the use his arms as support as he looked away so Harry could change his pants with some dignity. Severus looked back as Harry let go of him and climbed slowly back into the bed. The teen truly did look exhausted, and it sent another pang of unwanted guilt into his gut. He picked up the sleeping potion from the table and uncorked it, handing it to Harry. “Sleep now, idiot child.”
, did he miss that man.
“Well, a lot has happened. After the battle in the Department of Mysteries, the Ministry finally acknowledged that Voldemort was back. During the summer, the Dursleys and I were attacked by Death Eaters. I was the only survivor, and just barely. D – Severus came, answering my distress call and he took me to stay with him. A lot of stuff happened this summer…I don’t even know where to begin,” Harry trailed off, giving his fathers a worried look. He wasn’t sure if he should tell Sirius about how the three of them had bonded and become a family in the past year, but he didn’t see a way around it.
Severus kneeled in front of Albus and took the elderly wizard’s hand in his own. He inclined his head towards Remus to indicate that they were ready.
Taking the package carefully, as it was obvious that it was fragile from the way Severus had handled it, Harry slowly tore the paper away, revealing the back of a picture frame. He turned it over once the paper was gone, and felt all the air rush from his lungs as he read the flourishing script at the top.
way around.
Severus looked up at the werewolf, sharing a glance with Harry, who looked slightly bewildered. “Not me, Lupin. Harry has to do this.”
“Do you have any idea what your stupid Gryffindor martyrdom did to us all? I was
Harry smiled at the redhead, realizing how much he had missed his friend for the majority of the year. “Thanks, Ron. I’m just glad that I’ve got you back now. Remus is fine, just exhausted and annoyed that he was sent on a seemingly pointless mission. He really wanted to help with the search for Tonks too, but Dumbledore sent him on some wild goose chase instead. I don’t think Dad will ever trust the Headmaster again,” Harry said with a frown, remembering the way the Potions Master had accused Dumbledore of having ulterior motives in sending Remus on that particular mission. He was starting to think his father was right.
“No! How on earth did a sixteen-year-old boy die when he was supposed to be safe and sound at home?” Molly screamed, pulling her arm out of her son’s grip and moving towards Remus. Everyone in the room jumped a foot when the bathroom door slammed open and a distraught looking Severus Snape stalked out.
Harry sighed in relief and returned Hermione’s smile, glad all over again that he had such a wonderful friend to turn to. “Thanks, Hermione. I was just so upset; I couldn’t stand to be near either of them anymore.” Harry had explained the entire situation to Hermione, and they had stayed up late into the night and the early hours of the morning talking it through. Harry still wasn’t sure how things were going to pan out, but Hermione had helped him come up with a plan to explain everything to both his father and Draco to hopefully get them to understand and stop feeling so betrayed.
“Similar things were said about you when you first joined the Order, Severus, and did it not take you some time to get over your prejudices as well? Have faith, my boy.”
“Dad’s never going to speak to me again, is he?”
Severus cocked his head to the side as he studied Remus’ disappointed expression. Why on earth would someone like Remus Lupin want to kiss him, anyways? He didn’t think he’d ever share this intimacy with anyone again, so why was he pushing the opportunity away when it presented itself? Sure, he was responsible for Harry and Draco now, but what did the future hold? His mind seemed to make itself up as he smiled shyly at the werewolf.
S~S~S~S
“Are you saying we should send another spy in? Severus worked hard for years to earn He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named’s trust. We don’t have that kind of time anymore,” Professor McGonagall pointed out, her sour expression evidence of what she thought of Lucius and his ideas.
“Oh it’s alright, you’re probably just distracted and nervous from the interview still. Come – ”
Harry stood up and nodded slowly, knowing he’d be fighting a losing battle if he refused.
S~S~S~S
“Starting a fan club, are we?” Severus sneered unpleasantly. “Unfair or not, Harry has an incredible ability, but his Occlumency skills could use a bit more work. It is essential that he learns to close his mind. However, he has some qualms about allowing you into his mind unguarded.”
Severus wrapped an arm around Harry’s shoulders, pulling him close to his side. The teen had hit right where Severus had been trying his best not to focus on, and knowing that his son was worried about the same thing scared him that much more. “I worry about him every day, Harry. I’ve been working on a potion for after the transformation, something that will help him heal more quickly and completely. Remus is a very strong man, never doubt that, but I know exactly how you feel. I don’t even want to
to find a better solution.
“I am quite honoured to be approached with this question. To be honest, I never had planned to have children of my own, but it would be nice to go through the experience at least,” Aurora Sinistra said before taking a sip of her coffee.
Harry sighed heavily and closed the journal in his hands, his forlorn expression coming back. They had been searching for
Severus hesitated for only a second, even less than that, before nodding curtly. “I will.”
to die, or else there would be no way Voldemort could ever be defeated.”
“Ah, yes indeed. Fawkes has been through a bit of stress lately, I’m afraid. Most phoenixes deal with heavy levels of stress by burning. Life is so much simpler when you’re an infant,” said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling as he ran a finger gently over the baby phoenix’s soft downy feathers.
was being pushed out now.
“Yes, well, considering my bond-mate is MIA and hasn’t sent any word of his whereabouts or well being,
“Yes it is,” Draco drawled as he pulled Harry into another heated kiss. They broke apart as Hermione wolf whistled at them and drew a heart with wand sparks around their heads.
Remus shook his head as he set his now cold cup of tea on the coffee table. He looked back at Severus, who had sympathetic frown still on his lips. “It wasn’t anymore your fault than it was mine, Severus. You’ve no need to apologize for the mistakes of a meddling old man; Dumbledore should have known, and should have been able to prevent it. I’ve been wondering about his lack of proper intelligence for awhile now; he’s been making an awful lot of mindless mistakes lately. How much danger we are all in if Dumbledore decides to crack his pot now, I cannot even begin to imagine,” Remus muttered as a faint smirked played at his lips. He felt better seeing the amused grin mirrored on Severus’ lips.
“I’ve no idea what he was teaching the boy, Minerva. Harry’s been reluctant to part with any details, but I know it was important.”
Sirius stepped back from Harry and tilted his face up. Using the sleeve of his robes, he wiped Harry’s tears away and smiled, ruffling the teen’s hair as some sort of silent agreement passed between them. Harry looked over Sirius’ shoulder and saw his parents standing in the doorway of the kitchen, and offered them a sad smile.
“And mum? I bet she’s devastated without my father there with her...” Draco said quietly, feeling his stomach twist painfully. If his mum wasn’t in Azkaban as well, why hadn’t she come to see him? He felt suddenly very ill. “Oh Merlin...Harry, please tell me my mum is ok?” Draco said, making it sound more like a command than an actual question.
“Yes, sir,” Tom said in a small voice, placing all of the items back in the box and sitting on the bed beside it. He looked chagrined, though still annoyed.
Harry stalked up to the desk, leaning over until he was as close to the Headmaster as he could get, his face red and screwed up in anger as he clenched his wand in one fist, the other ready to send a punch.
“And Snape, of course, lovely as ever to make your acquaintance! To what do I owe this past-life pleasure?”
It was the dream about the forest again, and there were even more details than before. He felt the fear grip him just as it did in the dream, and he nearly jumped out of his skin as his bedroom door opened. The dream ended just as his father looked upon the projected image.
Harry awoke to the sound of excited twittering as something small and fluffy bounced off his pyjama-clad chest repeatedly. He grunted tiredly as he opened his eyes and snatched the fluffy menace off his chest.
Remus’ attempt to crawl back into bed quietly went without merit as Severus rolled over and stared at him with a raised eyebrow. He didn’t even need to state his question as Remus smiled at him.
“Er...Yeah, it’s been nice. Uh, Harry, can we speak to you – privately?” Hermione asked, giving Snape and Malfoy wary looks. She had a light hold on Ron’s arm, trying to soothe the boiling emotions she could sense coming from him.
At seven-fifteen, the Great Hall was already crawling with students of various ages and all houses. Groups were spaced around the Hall, talking quietly but excitedly together. The raised dais used for the Duelling Club in Harry’s second year had made a reappearance, and the lack of the House tables made the Hall seem vastly larger than normal.
The door to the Headmaster’s quarters opened once more, and Tom turned quickly to face Dippet. As Harry watched, he could have sworn he saw the darkness of Tom’s eyes flare red for just a second. He felt chills running up his spine. The world around him whirled sickeningly once more, and Harry was back where he had started.
Abigail fought the urge to blush, giving a cheeky smile. “Did he, now? That sod isn’t going around shouting it from the roof tops is he?” she teased, knowing Severus would never do such a thing. In fact, she remembered that Severus had hated Remus while in school, so why did he make it sound like they were buddy-buddy now?
Severus felt slightly wary of describing Lily to her son. He was afraid to let his own feelings for her show too much in front of Harry.
Severus smirked at his husband, proud of the man’s clever ideas, and grateful for his inventiveness. “I actually think we might be able to work that out. Now, the issue of proximity will be our biggest challenge, but I think I may know a way around that.”
“I fought it tooth and nail, made myself try to hate you and push you to the very edge. I protected you, fought for you, spied for you, and suffered for you. It was never for Albus, not really. I convinced myself it was simply my duty and loyalty to the man who had saved my life, a favour to Lily’s memory. It was not until I allowed myself to see you as just Harry and not an extension of James, as a boy who had lost everything, to no fault of his own, who only wanted to be a normal child, but was anything but. You have always been extraordinary, Harry, and as much as I know you despise your notoriety, it will always follow you. Not just because you’re The-Boy-Who-Lived; no, if you had been dealt a different hand in life, I think you’d still have found your way to the limelight. You were never meant to blend in. You’re humble, extremely intelligent, and so full of love and compassion for others; I couldn’t imagine you any other way.
“Harry, there’s no guarantee the ruby will be there. Are you sure you want to risk it?” Hermione asked as she gathered her notes and the
Taking a deep breath and trying to let his frustration with the boy slide, Severus pulled patience from somewhere deep within him. He walked around Harry and sat on the bed, gesturing that Harry should do the same and waiting to continue until Harry complied and sat beside him, looking difficult. “I’m sorry that that phrasing bothers you, but it is the truth. I will not reiterate; it will only serve to make you angry once more. The reason I agreed to have you move down here was so that I could protect you more easily and be here for you when you needed it. If I have seemed a bit overbearing as of late, I apologize, but I have just as much stress, if not indeed more, than you do yourself. I
Draco finished his Arithmancy project with a flourish and dried the ink with his wand before letting the parchment scroll in on itself. “Severus is fine, Harry. Not that I’m saying I approve of how Professor Dumbledore handled Sev’s accident, but perhaps going and looking for these objects was more important. Maybe he found another one, and he’s just waiting to tell you so he can take you along,” the blonde suggested.
Severus nodded and motioned for Harry to sit back down. He had all the information he needed. “Twenty/five-hundred Harry, is extremely bad vision. You’ve been walking around, playing Quidditch and competing in the Triwizard with the incorrect prescription for twenty/five-hundred vision? No wonder you always add the incorrect amounts of ingredients in potions; you can’t see the bloody measuring cups!”
“I’m afraid I’ll have to wake him up for this. You may need to calm him down, so prepare yourself.”
“The art of duelling is just that – an art. Some people are foolishly mistaken in thinking that throwing spells back and forth at each other and being able to block some of them constitutes as duelling. Those people are not only ignorant, but extremely wrong. Any witch or wizard can throw spells back and forth, but duelling is a skill. Knowing when and how to use both defensive and offensive spells and blocking properly and affectively is only part of duelling. The other part is etiquette, or what is considered ‘fair-play’, though that term is misleading, as it refers to duelling as ‘play’.  Duelling is not meant to be fun, though some may find enjoyment in it. It is a survival skill, and should be treated as such.
“A bit, but I needed to get out of castle for a little while. I was starting to feel a bit trapped,” Harry answered, turning back to stare out over the lake, his knees drawn up to his chest.
There was a long, tension filled silence as everyone became lost in their own thoughts. Tonks seemed to be perfectly fine with the entire situation, however, and gladly nibbled on the biscuits that accompanied the tea.
“Because this information is very dangerous, and in the wrong hands, can cause history to repeat itself. You cannot tell anyone about any of this, including Dumbledore’s illness. I need your word before I can tell you anything more,” Harry said, pulling out his wand. He trusted his friends, but this was too important to not use formalities.
“I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have said that, Harry. I feel so terrible,” Draco cried, his head tucked in the space between the Gryffindor’s shoulder and chin.
Remus pouted theatrically before stealing another quick kiss and moving towards the wardrobe to find some clean clothes to change into after his shower. “Tease.”
Harry sighed and nodded, taking the small vial of potion and slipping it into the pocket of his robes. He didn’t particularly like the dreams, but he could feel that familiar curiosity that had lured him in just like the plain black door. That feeling alone terrified him, and he willing agreed to take the Dreamless Sleep if it would make the bothersome dreams go away.
“Bollocks! Weasley was of age as of April. I will no longer give him the benefit of the doubt and think of him as a child. He should be mature enough to know when he is out of line! He has abandoned Harry and left him quite upset time and again and I am quite sick of it. I do not want him around Harry any longer.”
“This one here states that Mr. Riddle was accused of killing another child’s pet rabbit. What evidence did you have for such an accusation?”
“She’s dating Charlie, Harry. What if she tells Charlie and he tells Mum? She’ll kill me, Harry. She’ll kill me, bring me back to life, and then kill me again! I know she wants grandkids, but not while I’m barely of age!”
“Now, because I was very weak, mentally, from torture, I could no longer teach Harry Occlumency, and so Draco took my place. He learned much about Harry during this time, and the boys became close even before the attack and Draco’s accident. After the attack in Diagon Alley, Harry, Remus and I moved back to Hogwarts prior to the start of the term for extra protection. We had learned that the attack had been a setup, and we couldn’t risk being out in the open. Draco, still comatose, was moved to the infirmary. Remus had signed on to teach Defence once more. Harry moved down to the dungeons in my rooms for extra protection as well. We had become close after going through much hardship together over the summer, and had long since put aside our differences.
Draco nodded as he closed his eyes, bringing back all of the horrid images he witnessed that night. He remembered everything, even the way the blade glimmered as his Aunt Bella plunged it into his mother’s chest, the taste of the blood as it sprayed across his face and landed on his tongue. The way his chest ached as he sobbed, how his throat tore as he screamed. He remembered the cold, blank stare in his mother’s eyes as she breathed her last breath.
“Hogwarts. He’s gone to Hogwarts.”
His musing was interrupted by a horrible smell coming from behind him, and he cringed as he felt a rough hand with sharp claws digging into his shoulder. “Frankly, I’m surprised that your new daddy isn’t here yet. Surely he smelt us coming. He’s probably sniffing you out now,” Fenrir hissed, his hot and putrid breath wafting over his cheeks and making him gag.
He was emotionally drained, more exhausted than he could ever remember being in his life. His heart had been shattered, repaired, and filled with complete rage in less than twenty-four hours, never mind the amount of magic he had exhausted searching for that Merlin forsaken Horcrux. They had finally retrieved the last one, only to come to a standstill because they still couldn’t destroy the blasted things.
Harry was looking over Remus’ shoulder at something Remus apparently couldn’t see. When the werewolf turned to investigate, he felt his heart jump as he saw Severus standing in the doorway, his back leaning against the doorjamb with his arms crossed loosely over his chest. Remus’ first instinct was to prepare for a chewing out, but the soft smile on Severus’ face threw him off a bit.
“Hey, Gin. Holding up alright?” Harry asked quietly as Hermione gave Ron a lingering hug, trying to fight off more tears as Ron stroked her hair back. Harry had a feeling they’d be getting back together soon.
“What’s going on?” asked Harry, announcing himself. Ron and Hermione looked up sharply at him in surprise.
“It’s highly unethical,” she argued. “How would you like it if Zabini went to the Slytherins and told them about your memories?”
Yet another argument ensued, each of them throwing insults while arguing why they would be better suited to the role of Tybalt. Just as Draco was ready to throw his script at Harry’s head, Harry raised his hands in mock surrender.
“If you say so,” she said, not sounding at all convinced by Liv’s protests. “Well, if you’re not looking for anything in particular, fancy getting out of here and grabbing a pint?”
The snake flicked its tongue in response before continuing its silent ascent up the tree branch, disappearing behind some foliage. Harry drew Draco an apologetic look. “Sorry to disappoint you. It was a long shot that it would work anyway.”
Liv raised her eyebrows in surprise. “An old fashioned? Very fancy.” The barman reappeared then and plonked the pint of bitter in front of her. “So, what do you think of Muggle London?”
“Alright, so my intentions are selfish,” she admitted. “But you’re the only family that I’ve got left. I don’t want to lose you.”
"Are you really going to dress up as a Muggle?" asked Ron, earning a cocked eyebrow from Draco.
“As the old saying goes, a woman’s tongue wags like a Crup’s tail. So on your date, be sure to let her do all of the talking, always look like you’re paying attention and agree with everything that she says.” Hestia snapped the book shut and slipped it back onto the shelf. “Hmm. Interesting advice.”
“And even fewer Death Eaters,” Harry sneered.
“You’d think the name would have given you a heads up that they were flammable,” Draco teased.
“And finally, the role of Juliet will be played by…” she paused for dramatic effect. “Draco Malfoy. Congratulations!”
Dennis lurched forward, snatched the polaroid from the desk and turned it over. Harry felt his stomach clench when he saw that it was a picture of Colin and Dennis, smiling and waving in their school uniforms. Harry knew all too well that Colin had a passion for photography, and it appeared that he had quite the talent for it, too. The picture was beautiful in its simplicity, a perfect moment in time captured of the two brothers, frozen forever, blissfully unaware of the tragedy that would befall them. Dennis stared at the photograph in his lap, his face screwed up in pain and anger.
“I suppose the only saving grace is that it wasn’t a long, drawn-out illness,” Liv continued matter-of-factly, her gaze focused intently on the empty tankard as she spoke. “Mal came over for the funeral, of course. She’d only met my dad once but she still flew halfway across the world because she wanted to be there for me. After the funeral, she headed back to the States and I stayed behind to sort through dad’s things—his belongings, his paperwork, all the legal stuff—that’s when I found out he’d left the cottage to me. I had to consider what to do with the property—either sell it or let it out to someone else—but the more I thought about it, the more I realised that I didn’t want anyone else to live in my home. I’d grown up in that cottage, all my memories of my parents were tied to that place. I knew that I needed to go back to the States; I’d put my life on hold for months and I had everything waiting for me…”
Draco lowered his gaze and nodded. “I get it. Better having three friends who’ve got your back than just me.”
“So a few less troublemakers are in attendance at Hogwarts,” Severus shrugged. “You should count your blessings.”
Draco was suddenly jerked awake when the train slowed to a stop and he hit the other side of his head on the bathroom wall.
Ron opened his mouth to speak but, of course, no words came out, so he responded by letting out a deep, guttural growl of frustration and flipping Draco off. But Draco was not so easily dissuaded; to be honest, this wasn’t all that different to how they normally greeted each other in the Great Hall each morning.
Platform 9 ¾ was abuzz with activity as students ran back and forth, wishing farewell to loved ones and reuniting with old school friends after a long summer apart—and in the case of Muggle-Born students, much longer than that. Cats yowled and owls hooted in their carriers and cages, waiting impatiently to be loaded onto the magnificent scarlet steam engine which would take students, new and old, to Hogwarts.
“Why?” she implored. “Why would you do any of this?”
“No. That’s…”
“They would notice,” she argued, shaking her head. “They’d find out and then we’d both be thrown into Azkaban! Can’t you...can’t you just leave? Leave the country for a bit until this all blows over?”
“You should go and talk to him,” he advised in a low voice. “Take advantage of the fact that he can’t speak back to you.”
Liv snapped the book shut and groaned. She might be rusty at this dating malarky but even she knew those suggestions were terrible. She had been smitten with Hestia Jones the moment that she had first laid eyes on her at the Welcoming Feast. While the two had become fast friends, sharing a passion for reading and chair spinning, as the weeks passed, Liv’s feelings for the pretty witch had only grown in intensity. A few days prior, she had finally mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date, but as she had approached Hestia, Liv’s nerves got the better of her. She had intended to invite the Defence Master out on Halloween for dinner but she had stuttered and stumbled over her words so profusely that Hestia mistook her proposal as a suggestion to arrange a party for the students. Rather than correct her friend and face the potential humiliation of rejection, Liv had nodded meekly and the two had set to work planning the party together. At least she would get to spend the evening with Hestia, even if it was only in a professional capacity.
“Are you sure? You had me worried,” she said, her voice a little strained. “Your hand on the clock moved to ‘Lost’ and I thought—”
“Everyone will be in period costume, Mr Malfoy,” she replied calmly. “Unless you have a penchant for corsets and stockings, I doubt that you would like what the men wore, either.”
Harry had completely forgotten about the auditions and the play. He was only reminded when he entered Liv’s classroom and saw the large stack of scripts sitting on her desk. Taking his usual seat at the back of the class, Harry’s mind wandered, more interested in what he was going to have for lunch than trying to guess who would be cast in which roles. When everyone had taken their seats, Liv cleared her throat and smiled at them.
Draco smiled and took Harry’s hand into his own. “Yes, well, neither of us are on the run anymore.”
“I don’t,” he drawled. “And if you keep acting the way that you do, soon enough, nobody else will either.”
“I know that this is a daunting task so I’m going to ease you into this,” said Hestia. “Everyone, pair up with someone that you know and, ideally, trust.”
Harry quickened his pace and broke away from his two best friends as they proceeded to argue with each other. He’d spent enough years being stuck in the middle of their arguments and he had no intention of getting dragged into a lovers’ quarrel. He spotted Ginny further along the corridor talking to Neville and Luna. If he hurried, he might be able to catch up with them...
On the morning that the students were due to depart Hogwarts for the Christmas break, Draco got up a little earlier than usual to pay Myrtle a visit before breakfast. For her part, Myrtle had stuck to her word and had made no attempt to drown Draco in toilet water since their falling out on Halloween. But his disembodied friend had remained aloof with him in the weeks since, ignoring his summons any time he visited her bathroom or quickly excusing herself before disappearing through a wall. If anyone else—living or dead—were so rude to him, Draco would likely have thrown in the towel and left them to it. He also knew that if the shoe was on the other foot, he would have behaved in a far less courteous manner than simply giving his friend the cold shoulder. But after everything Myrtle had done for him, she was a rare exception to this rule. So he had persisted, dropping off the Daily Prophet for her every day as a small peace offering.
“Brilliant plan, mate,” Ron exclaimed, slapping Harry on the back. “Doing two auditions means twice the chance of getting cast in the top role! Genius.”
“Why wouldn’t I make a good Romeo?” Harry challenged. Draco shrugged.
“I got stuck riding in the last carriage with Malfoy,” Harry explained, sinking into the empty seat and slipping off his cloak. Ron gave him a thorough once-over.
“A bit,” she conceded with a small smile. “A lot of big changes. Some good. Others...not so much.”
“I should have guessed that you’d dress up as a common criminal,” Ron sneered.
“Whoops! Sorry…” Liv mumbled an apology and quickly gathered up her papers, her blush matching the crimson robes that she wore. Minerva struggled to suppress a smile at the woman’s clumsy antics: evidently, Nymphadora had inherited her cousin’s gracefulness as well as her looks.
“Nonsense!” she bristled. “Professor McGonagall has always been strict but fair.”
Liv shrugged. “Merlin only knows. It’s been so long since I’ve had a girlfriend, I’ve almost forgotten what it’s like.”
“I suppose I just needed someplace to clear my head,” he explained. “I hoped coming here I might find...I don’t know, a piece of serenity, or something.”
He regretted the words as they came out of his mouth and he realised that, once again, he had let his temper get the better of him. Myrtle’s eyes widened with shock and welled with translucent tears. Guiltridden, Draco’s shoulders sagged and he turned to face her.
“We all came into the office the next morning to hear that Voldemort was back and that, effectively, we were at war,” she said. “Myra handed in her notice later that week and I got offered her job.”
Groans of disappointment rippled throughout the crowd and Ron looked horror-struck at this revelation. One of the main things that he and Harry had been looking forward to upon their return to Hogwarts was the chance of winning the Quidditch Cup for one last time before graduating.
Harry wanted to kiss Draco then, but he resisted, letting Draco decide for himself how far they were going to push this. Draco looked like he wanted to do it too, but at the last moment, his courage failed him and with an apologetic smile he turned away and headed towards the Slytherin table to sit with Theo. Harry stared after him for a few moments before shuffling over to the Gryffindor table to sit with Ron and Hermione, disappointment settling in the pit of his stomach. They might not be actively keeping their relationship a secret anymore, but it was evident that Draco wasn’t at the point where public displays of affection were within his comfort zone.
Hermione nodded glumly. “He looked as shaken as Goyle did.”
“Cheesy romance might be your thing, Myrtle, but it certainly isn’t mine,” said Draco. “I’ve got better things to be doing with my time than reading—OUCH!”
“I feel the same way about Muggle Studies,” Neville’s shoulders sagged. “Okay, ‘not confident’ is a massive understatement—full disclosure, I know nothing about Muggles. The only part of the Muggle world I’ve ever visited is King’s Cross Station so I could board this train! How in the name of Merlin am I going to pass that class?”
Hestia nodded in agreement. “I know what you mean. Hogwarts has always felt like it was separate from the rest of the world, like a safe haven—even if staff members do die at an alarmingly regular rate.”
“Do you have any better suggestions, Ronald?”
“Fine,” Draco sighed.
Harry shook his head in disbelief at what he was hearing. They were taking the reality of the situation and twisting it into something unrecognisable.
Harry glared at him. “How could this be worse?”
“The Nurse’s role might be small but it’s an important one,” Hermione argued. “She functions as a go-between for Romeo and Juliet, which you would know if you bothered to read the script!”
“—I’M IN LOVE WITH YOU—”
“Move your trunk out of the way,” he demanded.
Draco watched as Goyle lumbered towards the Matron, closely followed by Neville and Luna, who—still wearing her dragon costume—practically skipped towards the hospital wing as though she didn’t have a care in the world. Hermione squeezed Ron’s hand and gave him a reassuring smile before leaving her seat and hurrying after her friends, leaving her boyfriend alone.
“You’re welcome. You can piss off now.”
Harry shook his head. “I’ve never been to a magical zoo before.”
“Tell me about it,” Harry agreed glumly. “It doesn’t help knowing that when you’re struggling to keep all of the pieces together, there’s a lot of people out there willing you to fail.”
Draco followed Ron’s line of sight and realised what was really bothering him: sat next to Theo, laughing and chatting away to him, was Ginny. Ron’s eyes narrowed and he shook his head in disbelief.
“Uh, yeah. Just...give me a minute to warm up,” he’d said with a nervous laugh. But try as he might, he could not rise to the occasion that night. Ginny had been understandably disappointed but Harry had brushed it off simply as his nerves getting the better of him, sure that next time would be different. But it wasn’t. After their third failed attempt at intimacy, Ginny had sat Harry down for ‘a chat’ and asked him if he had something that he wanted to tell her.
Harry glanced up. “It’s a pen.”
“Potter and Malfoy?”
Liv let out a long sigh and settled back into her chair. “Well, there was one girl…” Hestia leant forward in her seat with rapt attention and Liv continued, “We worked together at MACUSA.”
Harry screamed in surprise and almost slipped off his broomstick as Myrtle’s spectral figure suddenly appeared in front of him. He tried to veer left to dodge her but he was too late and as he flew through her incorporeal body, he felt as though someone had tossed a bucket of ice-cold water over him.
Draco smiled to himself as he listened to Harry splutter in indignation. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Everyone knows about it,” he drawled. There was a murmur of agreement and Liv looked crestfallen.
Draco tried pushing thoughts of his father out of his mind but couldn’t suppress the mounting feelings of anger, shame and inadequacy from rising up inside of him. Liv was still talking but he couldn’t hear her over the loud ringing in his ears. Draco clenched his hands together into tight fists and he felt the last of his resolve finally snap, his anger bursting out of him like a Blast-Ended Skrewt.
“Not every night,” she replied evasively. “You look tired, Draco. I’ll let you get some rest. Goodnight.”
“A problem with what?” asked Luna.
Draco carefully unwrapped the packaging and frowned when he revealed a small, square mirror. It looked old and entirely unremarkable. He held it up to his face and saw his own bemused reflection staring back at him.
“Well, that’s a relief. In a strange way I kind of miss pain—I miss being able to feel anything. Does that sound weird?” she asked.
“Page eleven. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours, yadda yadda…”
Professor McGonagall turned her steely gaze upon Harry and he felt a chill run up his spine. Whatever he was here for, clearly it wasn’t a social call. “Mr Potter, have you received treatment from Madam Pomfrey yet?”
“Well it might be easy for someone like you to shut down their emotions, Malfoy, but it doesn’t come so easily to the rest of us,” Harry retorted. Draco’s eyes narrowed.
“Not that anyone’s been particularly forthcoming with information as to what that was like,” Ron muttered.
“Merpeople!” laughed Draco and Harry gaped as a procession of them began to jump out of the water, following them as they flew across the lake. The merpeople were screeching and waving furiously at them, but whether it was in a friendly or aggressive manner, Harry didn’t wait around to find out. He took off into the air again and headed back towards the Quidditch stadium.
“Nothing,” she replied firmly. Her shoulders sagged when she saw the despondent expression on Harry’s face and replied more gently, “Look, you didn’t do anything wrong, but you can’t change who you are.”
“Potions class,” he explained. “Professor Slughorn’s brewing it with the sixth years. I just stole some when he wasn’t looking.”
“Saint George and the Dragon,” Neville explained. Luna tugged on two pull strings sewn into the arms of her costume and the large green, bat-like wings on her back began to flap.
“Oh, come on! We can survive a couple of days without it. Besides, I know my way around London pretty well, so if you stick with me, you won’t have to worry about getting lost in the big, bad Muggle world.”
Professor Sprout checked the name on the trunk and chuckled. “That’s Sybill’s trunk, Argus. You’d better put that back unless you want her hexing you.”
“How have you been getting on, Myrtle?” he asked, his eyes fixed on Draco as he performed loop-the-loops above their heads.
“I agree with Severus,” Albus nodded. “As a wise friend of mine once said, worrying only means you suffer twice. You cannot control what is published in the newspapers, Minerva. Your primary concern ought to be the school and its students.”
“Myrtle,” he hissed, sitting up in bed. “What are you doing here?”
Harry tried to spread his legs wider so that he could take Draco deeper, but their current position made that awkward. Draco paused and took hold of Harry’s legs.
“What scene are you practising?” asked Harry. Ginny glanced at the script again.
“Yeah, probably.”
“What’s happening?” he asked, pulling Harry aside. “Does McGonagall know what’s going on?”
“That’s a shame. Arcanus is very good. They have hourly Kelpie shows, although I wouldn’t recommend you sit in the front row unless you want to get soaked. My father took me there once and got drenched from head to toe, he was absolutely furious.”
The heavy red velvet curtains hissed as they dragged across the floor to reveal a darkened stage. With a loud click, a spotlight burst into life, illuminating the ominously empty stage. A long, awkward silence followed and the audience seemed to hold its collective breath, waiting for any indication of life. All eyes flitted to the right of the stage at the sound of nervous footsteps approaching; the shuffling grew louder with each step and soon a young man, no older than fifteen, came into view. He stepped into the intense spotlight, recoiling slightly at the blinding light, blinking desperately although he could see nothing. He was so frail in appearance that he looked as though a strong gust of wind would blow him away. His mousy brown hair was plastered flat against his head, whether from overheating thanks to the heavy leather breeches he wore, or fear, or a combination of the two. He quickly swiped the back of his hand over his pale brow, blinking rapidly as the sweat stung his eyes. His breaths were coming out in short, nervous pants, audible to the first few rows of the expectant audience. He wrung his hands together, staring out into the blackness, struggling to find the words as the silence seemed to stretch out for all eternity.
is disgusting and deserves to burn in hell! Whether you think you did it willing or not, he kept you there against your will. You were forced to cave in to keep yourself alive. Don’t hate yourself for something you had no control over,” Harry said, placing a comforting hand on Draco’s trembling shoulder. He felt his heart sink even lower as he heard a badly veiled sniffle and a whimper come from the blonde.
– and I think it’s very petty of you to hold that against him now. You’re a fool, and Harry doesn’t deserve any of this.”
“We could have stuck Harry’s head in it, but he’s gotten rid of that one already,” Ron quipped as he flipped through another pointless book, not really taking anything he read in.
“With you, the circumstances may be a bit tweaked. As you must know, most Legilimency requires eye contact. However, if the Dark Lord can see into your mind from miles away, that rule obviously doesn’t apply, making things a bit more complicated for you when trying to pull up a block. Most people have the advantage of a warning, which gives them at least that split second to prepare their shields, but you do not get that luxury. For you, I think that inner sense of knowing something is there that shouldn’t be, and your admitted sense of foreign emotions are the strongest two signals you should focus on. With a constant block, at that first sign of outside penetration, the shield can quickly be strengthened to keep it out. It takes much more power to pull up a block from nothing than to strengthen a weak, constant shield.”
Severus rolled his eyes as he turned a page in his book leisurely. “I’m not an explosive, you cannot set me off.”
was over.
away from my family from now on, my parents included. You’re not welcome with us anymore. I don’t want you near them or speaking to them again, you hear me?
The room was a mass of confusion, grunts of pain and the sounds of sobbing, mostly from Harry and Remus. Draco had silent tears running down his face as he supported Harry’s weight in his arms, watching numbly as the injured were healed and put to sleep to help them recover more quickly. This was what war looked like.
“As I’m sure you’re all aware, unless you live under a rock, the Wizarding world has been in a very precarious state for a while now. Dark forces are trying to take over and topple Wizarding society as we know it today. It is of utmost importance that you, the next generation to face this upcoming evil, learn to defend yourselves from the challenges you will inevitably face.
Ron immediately grabbed for the handle and made to leave, but he paused and turned back to look around at Harry. “Nothing happened between you and Hermione at all?”
. Ok, so maybe not his
Severus pulled Harry close to him, wrapping an arm firmly around the young man’s shoulders as they entered their quarters. “You’re welcome, Harry. I really do think you are capable and competent enough. I have every confidence in you, son.”
When they separated, Harry detangled himself from his boyfriend’s arms. “I think I should go check on my dad. See you and Hermione in the library at three as planned, alright?”
“Moony! Dad, what happened?”
Severus read it three times before handing it off to Remus, who quickly took the parchment and read it all the way through in less than a minute. Severus was holding onto the edge of the counter, his knuckles white from his firm grip. There was nothing left to say, nothing he
Harry nodded his understanding, glad when Severus pulled him into a quick, tight hug. He hugged his father back before pulling away and hugging Remus too, who smiled warmly at him.
Hermione grimaced as she pushed her own plate away, losing her already shoddy appetite. “Professor Snape asked me to ask you about it. He’s been researching the ways different dark spells interact with each other in the hopes of working out a cure for Draco.”
There were still quite a few people around for this second instalment of his Coming of Age. The twins were talking to Charlie and Tonks, who were now quite obviously together now that they were away from the prying eyes of Molly. Ginny was sitting beside Neville on the sofa, who had agreed to only drink a butterbeer or two and stay mostly sober so she’d have someone sane to talk to throughout the night. Ron was clinking his bottle against Draco’s, who sent a wink in Harry’s direction before taking another deep drink of his beer.
