I know that my friends will be upset that I don’t think I can talk to them, but the truth is, I’ve not felt able to talk to them for a long time. They’re happy. Starting a family. I can’t be the one to drag all the bad memories up again, they’d never forgive me.
“You got together and you grew and then you didn’t fit anymore,” Draco replied to that even as he processed the shock that Harry blamed himself for the divorce. He’d never said that before, and Draco knew for a fact that Ginny didn’t think about it like that. “And now you have three happy kids and a great friend instead of tension and kids who have no idea what love looks like. Don’t beat yourself up about things that aren’t your fault. No one cheated, the fights were not too bad, your divorce is amicable, and you and Ginny still love each other to bits. That would have never happened if she’d been in a relationship with an arsehole, Harry. Give yourself some credit.”
“Hi, Luna,” Harry replied with a smile. “No, I’m… meeting someone. Hopefully. If he turns up,” he finished sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand.
They sounded brave. Exhausted but determined in the fight against everything and everyone telling him to surrender. Neville had been in a war as a teenager, he knew what it was like to fight, but he had no idea how anyone could ever cope with fighting themselves like this, fighting an evil that literally came from within.
At least, if Draco would accept the help. If he wouldn’t keep insisting he was fine, brush it off as nothing. Neville didn’t know what he’d do if that happened. Despair, probably. Fear for Draco’s life. Worry to death about everything that might be going wrong.
have more than an ounce of body fat.”
“Fine!” Harry yelled back, the idea of spending Christmas Day at the Burrow after all looked a million times better than staying in this dump anyway. Draco wouldn’t be on call with him in his current state, which really had been the only reason he’d taken the shift at all. “Have fun finding two last minute replacements during Christmas, you stuck up prick.”
I testified for my rival and his family after the war. It helped them avoid Azkaban and there’s not a day goes by that I regret my decision to testify. Some people thought I was mad to do it, told me that I should let them rot in prison but if I’d let that happen, I wouldn’t have been able to live with myself. We might not have seen eye to eye, but he didn’t deserve Azkaban. He wasn’t evil. I’d like to think if we met now, we’d be able to shake hands and maybe even become friends.
“Mob me
“Jealous of me?” Harry frowned. “Why?”
But she did break the silence and got me help. Discreet help, help my father did not know about, help no one but her and my therapist knew about, but help nonetheless. That is what people who care for you should have done. And I am sure that some of them simply did not know how to see the signs, but I do not believe no one noticed it. Dumbledore knew it at the very least.
Draco shook his head. “She wanted to leave that place before Astoria fell ill. But now… I can come back there, whenever I like, whenever I need it and I can tell her to leave because I can find my own place but she won’t listen to me.” He chuckled. “She never listens to anyone. Last time I tried she told me,
Draco blinked again, and then he did it some more until his eyes stopped sweating. Because he was
“Tell us something about yourself that you’ve never told anyone before.” McLaggen said with a smirk. “Something you’re
Please, please don’t let your previous letter be your last.
The whistling of the kettle pulled him out of his thoughts, and he quickly pulled it off the stove to make a fresh pot of tea. The small tasks of getting out an extra mug, refilling the milk, picking the tea leaves, calmed him, grounded him. With a sigh, he looked through the kitchen door to the scene in his living room. Harry and Draco had moved to the couch, looking no closer to ever letting the other one go.
“What? Malfoy, wait!” But somehow, despite being exhausted, Malfoy was out the door before Harry could stop him. He’d have chased the guy, but that would’ve left his shop unattended and he wasn’t that obsessed with the blond anymore.
Albus had joined him back there though, and coaxed him out as Lily pounced on James to distract him. All in all, the Potter kids had been nothing short of a blessing, teaching Scorpius how to be a kid again while Harry taught Draco how to relax and smile for more than two seconds. At first by putting his fingers on the corners of Draco’s mouth and pushing them up, and later with dumb inside jokes and soft kisses.
Draco couldn’t say it. It was one thing to think about losing your son, but it was quite another to actually say it out loud. Luckily, Harry knew what he meant anyway.
also on an extra note, if there is a character whose pov you miss or whose pov you want to see again, please tell me so in the comments! I can't guarantee anything, but maybe I'll be inspired by you!
As for swearing in your writing, please do, if you feel like it. These letters are an outlet for your emotions and shouldn’t adhere to any social etiquette about politeness, since that just is not how thoughts work. Especially when you feel angry, I can see the need to swear.
“I’ll remember to ask if I can snog her husband next time I see Hermione.” Harry put the other bag on the floor and grabbed Draco’s hand. He didn’t do anything else though. What he did do was tilt his head and look at Draco thoughtfully for a moment. “Is it okay if I pull you onto the chair with me?”
Harry had only caught a glimpse of how to properly raise kids when he visited The Burrow for the first time. He didn’t know any nursery rhymes, didn’t know how to change a nappy or how to lull a kid to sleep.
So, I cannot be your therapist. You cannot talk that freely to me because no matter if you like it or not, I am part of the past and the trauma that you need to be able to talk about. I might not have made myself clear on that point in my last letter, given that I was still somewhat shocked from finding out who you are, but this is the full reason. And though I will admit I can sound like a bloody therapist literally all the time (Pansy’s words, not mine), I am
“They were worse.” James pouted. “Now we need pancakes.”
“I’m a herbologist, Draco. My knowledge only goes so far. But it sounds to me like maybe you need a therapist.” It was a touchy subject. Really, it was the only thing Neville remembered ever having an argument about with Draco. It had been back when he’d first started teaching, when they’d shared a bed because the nightmares turned Draco into a full-blown insomniac. The memories clinging to the castle walls were too much for him in the first months.
“Harry is in the kitchen making a fry up.” Draco lifted his head to see his son in the doorway, a steaming plate in his tiny hands. “He asked me to bring you breakfast,” Scorpius said as he walked into the bedroom. He didn’t climb on the bed like usual, though. Instead he put the plate on the nightstand and stayed right where he was. “Can I join you, Daddy?”
is written for teenagers and adults but it is kid friendly. It discusses celebrating things like Christmas and birthdays without the one you lost. And all books have an audio CD, because sometimes it can be difficult to read out loud.”
Luna levitated the tray containing the order for Harry and Draco directly to their table. She didn’t want to interrupt what was clearly an intimate conversation, judging by the hushed tones they were using. If she was as intuitive as she liked to believe, this wouldn’t be the last time she saw the two men. This thought made her happy. It had been far too long since she had seen either man as relaxed as they looked right now.
?” Ron dropped his head on the table with a loud thud. “Unbelievable. After two years,
“No, no, Daddy, you have to ask!” Scorpius hopped between them before anything could happen, shooting a firm look at both his dad and Harry. “When you do something with or to other people, you always have to ask.”
Harry glared at her, then pouted, then turned to stare at the table. He didn’t like to be confronted with his own feelings and past like that. “I’m not going to obsess over him, ‘Moine. He left a book and I want to give it back to him, and I’m interested in how he’s doing because I know what it feels like when no one’s looking out for you.”
Harry blushed and scratched the back of his head after Neville opened the door.
Kingsley should be asleep. He knew that, his husband knew that, every single person who laid eyes on him knew that. But he simply didn’t care. His authority, which always shut people up with a single glance, usually annoyed him, but today he was grateful for it. Or tonight, actually, given that he’d left the office way past twelve again.
? Damn, you really are full of surprises.”
Scorpius nodded, more because Draco’s tone of voice didn’t really allow for an argument. Draco knew that was the case and he hated it when his voice got like that. It was necessary now though. Who knew how angry and close on their tail Harry would be. So Draco stepped in the floo once more, and left Harry’s place.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re right and I’m wrong. Blah blah blah.” Harry chuckled and pulled him close again, but quickly corrected himself before he kissed him and instead stepped away. Draco let out a tiny sigh of relief. He knew it was wrong of him, but he didn’t want to be as out as Harry was. This entire bisexuality thing was still very new for him, and despite recent progress, a lot of people still had the attitude
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. He was screwed either way. Which meant that he might as well get a hug out of it.
“I wouldn’t put it past her to weave some sort of evil curse into that bitch slap so you’re not actually imagining things.” Harry snorted. “I’m glad I had to fight Voldemort, if I’d had to fight Hermione we wouldn’t stand a chance.”
“It wasn’t really an argument.” Harry said as he reluctantly sat up again, looking grumpy about needing to adult. “But Molly watches my kids a lot, and lately I’ve been getting the impression that she thinks they, or mostly James and Albus, act out because I don’t discipline them. Or not enough, at any rate.”
, his mother had caught the fact that he had omitted to mention her name. That was a quality he didn’t always love. Lying to his mother was next to impossible. “How is she with Scorpius?”
Whatever the fuck I am to you now is for you to decide. I did request you write back in a friendly capacity, you idiot, so no, I will not say yes to your request to please keep writing to you, since
“Draco?” The footsteps came to a halt. Someone brushed a lock of hair out of his face. “Did you fall asleep? Your fever rose, I can tell you that much. Come on, we’ll use the emergency floo, it’ll only be a couple steps.”
Just as he deemed everything ready to go, there came a distraught noise from upstairs. Worried Draco might have fallen out of bed, Harry took the stairs two steps at a time, the tray of soup afloat behind him in the air. The noise got louder as he approached his bedroom, sounding ever more like terrified, muffled screams.
you complain when I haven’t warmed up your side of the bed.”
a mess.” Pansy whispered just a tad too loudly. She had just enough manners to look slightly embarrassed about it. “Sorry, I’ll leave. Have fun you two.”
But the part that comes before the funeral, the death, the despair, the fight with reality that you will always end up losing, the desperate hope in the thoughts and prayers around you, that held nothing but fear. It was that fear that kept George in his seat after he woke up with a crick in his neck. Even in the hospital, so close to Draco’s dying body, he had a little bubble around him. The smallest barrier between him and the inevitable truth.
My mother, however, never left my side. She is the one who got me that therapist at fourteen. It had never been spoken about until then, my father just said my mother was often tired and did not enjoy the outdoors, but when I was fourteen I found out that she was ill. To be precise, she was depressed, had been for years, and she had wanted to shield me from it by keeping it silent. Once she started to see the signs in me though, she pulled me aside and told me everything. Well, most things. I was only fourteen at the time, and she did not want to give me any ideas.
But he kept that thought to himself. Thinking about losing Harry was already bad enough, he didn’t want to say it out loud as well.
“But dad,” Rose frowned, because this sounded more and more like Snow White. “Can’t Harry kiss him then? Like the prince in Snow White did?”
“Harry, as a friend of Granger you should know that it’s useless to deny the truth. And the truth is that I love you, every inch, ounce and part of you, and I’m going to drag you around until you’re old and almost falling apart just like I used to do with my favourite teddy. Only my father can’t take you from me, so even then I won’t leave, and I won’t ever love you any less. Get it through your thick skull, Harry. I am violently clingy and you can probably commit murder and I still wouldn’t go away. Now stop fussing.”
“Because Uncle Harry wants Draco to wake up sweetie.” Her dad smiled a very sad smile at her as he bend down to pick her up. Rose wanted to squeal, she loved being just as high as her dad, but she didn’t. Sad people wouldn’t like squealing, she thought. “Draco was hurt so his body went into a very deep sleep, but now he won’t wake up anymore.”
I will end this letter by saying again that you are not taking up a lot of my time. In fact, if you do not write I will probably get bored and pet my cat until she goes bald and that would be a great shame, so please feel free to write whatever you like. I would also like you to try and take a moment each day, preferably at random, to ask yourself if you and your actions are at peace. By which I mean, is any of what you have just done, motivated by something that came from the war?
Harry couldn’t do it. He just couldn’t do it. It wasn’t
“Is the old man tired?”
“Aurora, I have a job for you,” she said softly, nuzzling her nose into the cat’s soft fur. “My friend Harry is nervous. I think that he’s worried about the Wrackspurts keeping his friend away, but if it’s who I think it is, I am positive he will find a way to get past them. You need to keep Harry company for a while to keep the Wrackspurts away, ok?”
“Enough.” He cut Percy off mid-rant. Possibly with an accidental silencing charm because his magic was itching under his skin, ready to be released. Or maybe just because in that moment his voice held more authority than the Minister of Magic and Minerva McGonagall put together. “Stop disrespecting my family by airing out your ignorant short-sighted opinions. They are not welcome. Now leave me alone.”
“Fine,
driven him up the wall, but no longer. “
“That’s so fucked up.”
If I had not had my therapist when I was fourteen, I would not have accepted one when I was eighteen. I would have blamed my mental problems on myself, would have shut everything out, let things rot and ended up dead within a year. Shutting up and ignoring your problems will not restore the chemical imbalance in your brain. Being surrounded by good things and love and friends and a fuckton of puppies will not stop your trauma from being traumatising. Walking around on a broken leg while screaming that you are fine will not heal your bones.
“Good.” Draco grinned. “You’re going to be alright.”
“Hi, babe.” He briefly chuckled as he imagined what Draco’s reaction would be to that nickname. Disgusted on the surface, even though he’d have melted right underneath that mask. Clingy to a fault, but always hiding it because his father had taught him it was wrong — that was his Draco. “You’ve been here for quite a long time, you know? We miss you. Me, your mum, Ron, Hermione, Molly, Teddy, Rose. Even Kingsley showed up yesterday in the dead of night.”
“No I’m not. I nag Ron and Hermione.”
Well, except for all the Howlers and random passersby who told him to kill himself, but doing that required at least a little bit of courage, and Draco had none. So he’d applied to become an Auror. It was the only job where they might hire him, since he was one of the few people who knew how to deal with Voldemort’s many cursed objects and traps.
“Did Molly scare you?” Suddenly two strong arms wrapped around him from behind and he had a head leaning on his shoulder. Harry, current boyfriend and forever pain in the arse, was the reason he was there at all, making awkward small talk with people he either barely knew or had hated as a child. Thankfully that was well behind him now, but it didn’t mean he was having a great time.
“Thank you,” Draco said as he rose from his chair and shook hands with the Healer. Black spots danced in his field of vision, and he was glad when Harry quickly escorted him back to the hallway. In all the commotion he’d forgotten to have lunch and it was showing now.
George’s chest constricted, almost silencing him. Because it couldn’t be. Not now. Not with Harry about to give up. Not with
One glance at his guest changed his mind though. Draco was somehow both deadly pale and red in the face, the sharp contrast just making him look more unhealthy. His nose was so red it was almost glowing.
Apparently that was exactly the wrong, or exactly the right thing to say, because Harry choked out a dry sob and buried his face in George’s shoulder. Feeling like he really ought to have brought Ron with him, George patted Harry on the back.
“Pansy,
“Domestic violence is illegal, Harry.” Draco snorted. He knew he was deflecting, using his self deprecating humour to avoid giving a serious response, but it was late, he was tired, and all this bettering himself crap sucked the life out of him. He knew that if he didn’t fight it, he’d end up in a bad place, but fighting every day without a permanent victory in sight was depressing. “And self-harm isn’t healthy.”
“Not as far as I know.” Ginny shrugged, trying not to put too much confidence in her words. She didn’t want to crush anyone’s hopes. “But I’m no expert, you’ll have to ask a nurse.”
And if he studied eight hours a day and worked another six, then there wasn’t much time left to think about how everything had gone to shit. He honestly preferred it that way.
“Hi Dad.” Scorpius greeted him with a wave that was noticeably more energetic than the day before. He was clearly dead nervous and scared though. “How did it go?”
“He apologised for that!” Harry butted in, sounding slightly offended even though it had clearly been a joke. Harry’s eldest son could do no wrong in his eyes, even though he did in the eyes of many others. The divorce had been rough on him because James was the only one of the kids who really remembered his parents being happy together. “Besides, you can’t blame him. You’re pale and you don’t like sunlight. It’s almost as if you were asking for it.”
Harry didn’t answer. Or at least he didn’t right away. First he pulled back and turned Draco over so they were looking at each other again. And even then he bent down to kiss him before he spoke. “Draco Lucius Malfoy, I do not understand how anyone could ever dislike you the way you are now. And that includes you.”
So there, it was out. Now everyone knew how pathetic he really was. It wasn’t even something from the war, something he could blame on old snake face. He was just sad and needy sometimes and too much of a coward to be honest about it.
He still couldn’t quite believe that this dingy old pub was the place Harry gathered with his friends. They’d picked it at random after the usual Auror place had gotten too crowded, mere months after Draco had left. Ellis had been serving the golden trio and everyone who came with it for years and he hadn’t even known.
Scorpius was not always such a model child. Or at least, he wasn’t always this polite. Only in settings like these, when he was surrounded by strange people, did he pronounce his r’s and t’s properly and did he make sure there were no grass stains on his knees. It was the result of a less than amazing childhood, which said something given that Scorp was only five years old.
, he’d explained a few weeks ago. Draco had promptly and quite unexpectedly started crying at that, which resulted in his son, Harry, and all the Potter kids burying him under a huge group hug.
“Do you think I’d let you sleep on the couch?”
“Bullshit, you wouldn’t survive two days without a hug whether it’s mine or not. And have you seen the last time I tried to teach James how to cook pancakes? I’m sorry Draco but that disaster father title is mine and there’s nothing you can do about it.”
“They can join us for tea, later,” Narcissa replied. She held out her hand and Scorpius took it, eager to get out of bed. “That would be in two hours, plenty of time for a whole scala of activities.”
“That’s just in your head, Draco.” To make his point, he brought his hand up to Draco’s head and ruffled his hair up a bit. “Doesn’t mean it doesn’t suck that you feel that way, but it’s just that. A feeling, not a fact.”
Harry climbed onto the bed and lay down behind Draco, gently pulling him into his arms. “What’s today then, hey? I know it’s Halloween, but I don’t think you mean that.”
As for the empty house, I have some experience with that. I live in an old family home, one that we only used during holidays which we only took before the war. It was never tainted by war trauma that way, but I still found myself dreading the empty hallways and old portraits as I recovered from my depression.
when he got like this. Two years after Astoria’s death and he still all but collapsed every time she came up. It wasn’t fair to Scorpius to see his father so weak, and it wasn’t fair to Harry to keep mourning his late wife around him.
Draco did
wasting time writing to me). And, no offence to Sphynx cats, but ragdolls are much more beautiful (I spent a lot of time with a cat-loving neighbour when I was younger - oddly enough, these times have contributed bright threads to my tapestry, now that I think of it).
The house I live in is definitely the complete opposite of yours. It was used heavily during the war as a headquarters. I have cleaned it up a lot, but I admit I haven’t changed much about it. It was my godfather’s house, and I still sort of feel that I’d be betraying his memory if I completely gutted the place and redecorated. There’s also an old house elf who is very… attached to certain things in the house and he would NOT be happy if I got rid of everything. I spend most of my time in the bedroom I sleep in, so I have changed that. I think that’s why I spend so much time in there, it feels like a much happier room than the rest of the house. It’s full of photos of the people I love most and the people who have been most important to me over the years. It will be no surprise that I have no photos of my aunt, uncle and cousin in there (but it may surprise you that there are some of my school rival and his friends).
“If he ends up being like me he’ll have anxiety and two therapy sessions a week.” Draco sighed, but he chuckled when he saw Harry’s glare. “But fine, I’ll admit I might worry a bit too much about him. But I’m his dad! What else am I supposed to do except worry about him?”
Draco looked sideways and raised an eyebrow, putting on his sarcastic Malfoy Mask to hide his emotions. “You had too much wine during dinner, didn't you?”
times, before his father fucked everything up. He blamed it on the upcoming Christmas season and promised himself to never come back once he left. Only he did come back. Four times even, before Potter spotted him and he forgot his blasted book.
. He didn’t think his in-laws were like that, but he felt no desire to test that theory.
of your stalking and pining and nagging about that arse trumpet after the war, - and let’s not forget about sixth year!-  you’re bringing the whole nightmare
“You know how to get in touch with Malfoy?”
“Don’t apologise for having panic attacks, you idiot.” Harry lightly punched him in the ribs, before kissing the top of his head. “Just be glad Ginny made me drop off the kids at Andromeda’s place, because she knew Andy would keep me hostage with tea until I calmed down. I might have still been mad at you if that hadn’t happened.”
But now that she was faced with Teddy, Hermione and Parkinson, looking at her like the sun would shine again and life would be full and good once more at the mere possibility of Draco waking up, she couldn’t help but regret never getting to know Luna’s best friend and Harry’s lover. And now she might never get the chance again.
Harry smiled down at him and pressed his lips to Draco’s cheek. ”I think that’s enough heavy talk for tonight.”
Draco was still head of their potions department, even if it was more symbolic at this point because he rarely had the time to fulfil the position. For someone still so shunned by society, he’d made himself quite indispensable in just a handful of years.

apologised, and second because the man had red-rimmed eyes and a haunted look on his face. “I figured you might be up right now. You’re the only person I could think of. I’m sorry, I just couldn’t be alone anymore.”
“Truth.” He replied eventually. At least then he didn’t have to get up.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Brussel sprouts? What a delicious treat,” Draco said just to tease James a bit. It worked, the kid pulled a face and made a vomiting noise. “Oh come come, James. I’m sure they weren’t that bad.”
“And you’re the best son in the world, Scorp.” Draco put his arms around his kid and held him close. He could get used to waking up like this, with a fresh fry up and the best tiny human ever climbing into his bed. Scorpius, never one for being held for long, pressed a kiss to his cheek and climbed off him again, sitting up on the bed.
“I would never, and yes.” Draco replied, snark creeping back into his voice even though the tears still hadn’t dried on his face. “You know I’m not a hugger, yet I still hug you because you give the best hugs, so yes, a teddy bear. And with the amount of breakdowns I have I think it’s more than fair to call myself a disaster.”
It was going to be a long night.
So, with the jitters of the caffeine still in her system and both kids sound asleep, she took to wandering through the hospital hallways. There was life everywhere, mostly in the shape of anxious parents, restless patients and hurried nurses. Nowhere else she saw the desperation that permanently hung in the air around Draco’s room. It was a relief. A reminder that some people did come out of the hospital alive, and that if they just hoped for that hard enough, maybe Draco would leave that way too.
The only difference was that when Harry pulled back, his Princess still didn’t wake up.
Draco thought it was that voice in combination with his mother’s firm back rubs that stopped his hands from shaking in the end, and not the calming draught. He briefly allowed himself to melt into his mother’s arms and let out a few sobs. “You said that when Astoria fell ill. When Scorpius…”
Neville raised an eyebrow. “Too much?”
“No he doesn’t.” Draco sighed and tried to look at anything other than Ginny’s fiery eyes. “There are a lot of things in this world Scorpius doesn’t deserve but gets anyway.”
“Well then, we’re about to find that out.” Pansy clapped him on the back, and Draco was too busy being confused to notice that Adonis, or Harry, actually, was coming their way. “Good luck, darling. Try not to drool too much.”
fight to fight. We’re just here to let him sleep and recharge, a therapist is there to dress him for battle, but he’s the only one who can fight this.”
So my advice to you, if your house feels big and lonely, change it. Out with the old, with the memories of those dark days that keep you chained to the past, and in with the new, better present and future. If you have a family home like me, it might help to remember, if your family loved you, then they would want you to be happy. Their history should not be more important than your happiness in their eyes. And if they did not love you? Then sod them, then they do not even deserve to be remembered.
When Harry caught sight of Draco, the noise he made perfectly reflected the inexpressible need Neville felt to comfort the blond man. Seconds later, Harry carefully wrapped Draco in his arms, but his eyes went back to Neville.
Harry was quiet.
, the responsible Healer in training, working twice as hard to earn his spot due to his past, always polite and professional. The last time someone had made him a cup of tea outside of work, or made him dinner, had been…
for those I need when meeting the in-laws of my
This one was still in its early stages, only powerful enough to kill small rodents and birds. Still, Draco led Scorpius to the tea and scones when he got a little too fascinated by the flower. It was always best not to take risks.
“Oh.” Neville hadn’t seen that one coming.
The Healer continued his technical talk, but Draco had zoned out. This was like Scorp’s first sick bed all over again, a long complicated speech full of hopeful words that eventually lead to an even sicker son and an ever stronger curse. The staff always made sure they sounded like they knew what they were doing, but Draco was well aware of the fact that they were all walking in the dark with this thing. Ancient, aggressive and long dormant blood curses were no one’s field of expertise, given that they sometimes didn’t show in anyone for centuries.
“You can’t hide from them forever.”
Harry gasped. “Are you calling me
“He’s twitching,” Parkinson answered. It was the first civil word exchanged between them in a very long time. Ginny did not usually like journalists, and Parkinson was no exception. “Which is not exactly a good sign.”
“Mr Malfoy.” He was greeted by a curt nod from Scorpius’ Healer, a man who he’d hoped to never see again. The feeling was mutual, judging by the pity in his eyes. “I’m afraid your son is still in theatre, but if you come into my office I can give you an update on how things are looking right now.”
I hope you enjoyed! Kudos and comments are most welcome<3
“I think it might be good to get myself together for a moment.”
hard not to melt. His son was already thinking more about his actions at the age of five than Draco had done at the age of fifteen. He could not be more proud. “Can I give you a hug?”
. She was going to scold and lecture him until he would. This madness had to end.
Until next time.
That experience made it clear to me that however much the tradition and history of a house is important, its occupant always comes first. You live in that house, you have to be there nearly every day and you deserve to come home to a place that actually feels like that, like
hit him. I know you wouldn’t do that, to anyone, a child or not.”
Neville couldn’t imagine how this must feel like to Draco. Sure, Neville felt sad and overwhelmed sometimes, but he had his coping mechanism. He had his plants, his friends, his students. It never really lasted long and a bad mood almost never came out of the blue. But to have your own mind put you through so much hurt, without any rhyme or reason, it had to be terrifying. Especially for someone like Draco, who always had to be in control.
“May I have some tea, Dad?” Scorpius asked, pulling on the leg of his trousers. Draco smiled and knelt down. His young son was doing his best to be as articulate as possible.
“Maybe,” Harry replied with a deep blush that betrayed his honest answer. “Honestly, thinking back to it I’m surprised my friends didn’t hex me. I should thank them for that at some point.”
Draco chuckled. “Did you just call your eldest son a tiny cute idiot?”
“You already said that.”
“Draco, you have to sit.” It was James who pulled on his sleeve, making him stop his pacing. Draco didn’t know why he had to sit, why he couldn’t pace. He liked pacing, pacing was good, pacing was something to do other than sit still and wait for the inevitable bad news. But he still sat, because James’ face was dead serious and despite the fact that he was a child Draco couldn’t find it in himself to argue with him. Maybe he even liked being told what to do, if only by Harry’s seven year old son, because then at least he didn’t have to make his own choices. Merlin knew what disasters were bound to happen when he did that.
Harry’s grip on him tightened. “I love you too.”
Only of course he would never ever wish for Draco’s death. He would rather sit next to his comatose lover for the rest of his life than put Draco’s body into the ground. Just like his parents, Remus, Tonks, Sirius, Hedwig, and as of last spring Mrs Figg.
“You alright there?”
It just sounded like a better Nothing.
“I am?” Scorpius asked at the same time that Harry said, “he is?”
Draco choked on his beer. “Excuse me Pansy I am not-!”
For her, getting to know Malfoy had always been a bit of a sore point. Though she knew she and Harry would have never worked out, she couldn’t help but look at him sometimes and see what might have been. A normal family. No Howlers calling her a pervert or inviting her to a threesome every time someone caught her and Luna snogging. Being out in a society that wasn’t fully ready for it yet was a constant battle, and sometimes she got tired of fighting in it. Hadn’t they all fought enough already?
“You- oh.” Draco had
“Hi gay Draco.” Harry chuckled, and Draco
That sounded like it would go over very well.
“Not even you?”
Though Kingsley knew Malfoy always claimed to hate politics, he was damn good at it and spent more time on legislation than he did on his potions business.
“Enough heavy talk for a bloody lifetime,” Draco responded. He yawned again and settled his head on Harry’s chest. Draco had almost dozed off when Harry brushed a lock of hair out of his face and kissed his forehead.
“I had a quite a good chat with your mother just now.” Mrs Weasley started after she’d sat down and they’d shared a few minutes of awkward silence. “It seems I owe you an apology. Your parenting methods might not be the same as mine, but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t respect them.”
“On occasion.” Draco shrugged. Now he felt bad about making Harry feel bad about making
Luna hadn’t been home ever since Malfoy’s accident. Ginny understood that Draco was her wife’s best friend, but that didn’t mean Ginny didn’t miss her. Especially when she came home to an empty house yet again. Of course, she could go to the hospital to visit Luna, but with her current training schedule, she needed a proper shower and every hour of sleep she could get.
going on around her, but she didn’t know what it was and she had never cared less about anything in her entire life.
, Madonna, Christ.” Draco didn’t know how fast he had to look away. Not that it would help his case. He’d always had a light skin and when he blushed his face basically combusted, it wasn’t
I must admit, I’ve cried a couple more times thinking about the tapestry story. I never would have thought about life like that if it hadn’t been for you, but it makes so much sense. Crying was always something I was punished for as a child, so I’ve probably not done it as much as I should have in the past. I’ve definitely done it more in recent years for various reasons.
He still did. Ron still kept things running smoothly, helped out where he could, all while managing his household like he was trying to give their mother a run for her money. George hadn’t even had a girlfriend since the war, let alone a wife and kids. Fred at least had Lee in that department.
Harry blinked at her, his brain taking its sweet time to understand who Luna was talking about. He scolded himself when the knut dropped.
“Come on then, lets get you to bed.” The strong arms lifted him up, but before they reached the bed, Draco was already sound asleep. For the first time in months, he slept like a baby. Deep, long, and
And now, it was out of the question until he knew who on earth had just knocked on his door.
The witch behind the front desk at St. Mungo’s did raise a suspicious eyebrow, but Victoire dragged Teddy away to the stairs before Teddy could stumble out an explanation.
“You think he’d get like that for me?” Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. Ron’s cooking frenzies were famous. The youngest Weasley son was worse than his mother when it came to his work in the kitchen, making more extravagant meals each time Draco visited. Normally he only turned to stress baking when there was something amiss in his family or when his friends were sick though.

is a picture book mostly, for the younger ones.
I had my first therapist at fourteen. Fourteen! You know, during that year in which you came back from a graveyard with the dead body of your second crush in your hands? (I know Wood was your first. I know Pansy, who knows Hermione, so I basically know everything). Anyhow, you should have seen a therapist then! Or after your Godfather died or when Dumbledore died or just, fuck, as soon as someone found out you have been abused for the first eleven years of your life or
“Mother! What are you doing here?” He was sure the last time his mother had visited him in bed when he wasn’t ill had been over two decades ago. It wasn’t done in pureblood circles. A single knock on the door, a request to be in a certain place at a certain time, and that was it. Gently waking someone up was for toddlers and lovers. Which reminded him, unexpected or not, he hadn’t exactly responded politely to his mother’s visit. “I mean, I appreciate it, and I hope you slept well, I just-”
Suddenly, Luna’s serious gaze was replaced by a big smile. She pulled a piece of paper out of her dungarees pocket and handed it to Harry. “He’d love to get his book back, but you can’t send it to him, he’ll have to fetch it himself. I’m sure you can brew him something to make it worth the trip. You always smell so nice, Harry.”
“Okay.” Harry sat down and pulled Draco down onto his lap. “Is it okay if I kiss you?”
“Draco, family will never be a joke to any Potter.” Draco had never heard Harry talk so seriously. “If you still haven’t figured out that you’re stuck with us by now then you’re the idiot in this relationship.”
“Enjoying the coffee enough to tolerate my face?” Potter joked.
. That’s it. In and out. In and out. I’m not mad at you, it’s alright. You’re not a horrible parent, or a horrible person. Breathe in, and breathe out. I love you, Scorpius loves you, it’s okay.”
“Doesn’t mean you weren’t a class A prick though, or that you’re completely blameless.” Potter chuckled at the thought. “It just means that you deserve a fair second chance. But you never got one, and now you’re alone during Christmas, coming into my coffee shop looking like absolute death and that’s not your fault. That’s all I’m saying. I wouldn’t want you to think that you’re alone because of
. Jealous of the faceless Alpha Draco was friends with.
Harry paused, staring at Ron.
An involuntary whimper escaped Draco.
“Oh…” Hermione picked up the envelope, her eyes softening as she looked down at it. “To get a letter to Azkaban, Draco, I don’t know if—”
Narcissa’s blues widened slightly, sharing a reproachful look with his father. “Well, I wasn’t expecting guests. Hello again, Mr. Potter. Lucius, darling, remember how I was telling you that Mr. Potter was helping with the investigation?”
"She's been hiding him," Harry said softly, the malicious thread of anticipation unfurling with sinister quickness inside of him. It wrapped around his heart, deliciously tightening and giving Harry a feeling of delirious happiness.
“I know, but I should have been able to tell something was amiss at your checkups, but the bastard had all of us fooled. If I could have just—"
Could he love his child if it came out looking like
Harry was across the room and over Draco before he could blink, his long, calloused fingers wrapping around his throat just above his collar, pressing down.
“Good job, kid. Now set it down next to me and bring the carnivores a new bottle of wine. Don’t open it, though. Mrs. Granger-Weasley doesn’t like her wine sullied by the hands of

need to keep obsessing about it.
Harry watched him, one side of his lips quirking up. “Subjecting you to what, Draco?”
Scorpius grinned and attempted to reach for the spatula Harry was holding.
Their bond flowed freely between them, cocooning Draco in a wave of warmth and satedness. Sleep finally dragged him under, feeling safe with his pup in his arms and their Alpha holding them close.
“The young man with the dark hair and eyes. Upstairs, in the child’s bedroom. There was dust covering everything. His portrait was covered, too.”

“I-I don’t know. I wanted to keep my distance. It’s better this way, Harry,” he murmured.
“Oh,” Draco said flatly, his jealousy flaring at the mention of Harry’s ex. “You two are back on, then?”
Draco was openly sobbing now, hugging his arms tight around himself trying to self-soothe without his Alpha’s needed affections.
“Thank you, Hermione,” he whispered into her curls, hugging her back.
Harry picked up the book from the floor that had fallen from his hand while he’d slept. “Curious about me? You need only ask.”
Pansy groaned and grabbed Draco’s hand, tugging him back towards the kitchen. Once they were back inside, she whirled on him.
”What
He looked up at Harry, hoping he wouldn’t invoke any more of his anger by doing something wrong.
The sore nipples, being excessively tired, and sporadic bouts of morning sickness were all symptoms he could handle by himself.
when pregnant.
Hermione’s eyes softened and she perched on the sofa next to him.
The inherent Omega part of Draco keened in approval at the man towering over him. It recognized a worthy mate that could provide protection for him and any babes they would produce together.
He got to his feet, steadying himself with a hand on the table before walking around it. Hermione quickly stood, pulling him into her warm embrace.
Would Draco beg him to suckle him? He could ease his Omega’s discomfort, suck out the excess—
Harry’s rabbit was a wreck beneath his tongue, pressing his hips down as Harry tongue-fucked his hole. His long saliva-damp ears were listless on the bed above his head, the fur of his scut tickling Harry’s jaw as he licked.
The endless chores at least kept his mind off of missing his mother and wondering how she was fairing all alone back at Wiltshire.
Harry knew
“What does that
”Look, all I’m saying is that they’re a definite help at home. Ever since Hermione and I adopted Pansy, we’ve been able to spend more time together as a family while Pansy takes care of the menial stuff around the house. It’s a win-win, Harry. They get protection from a carnivore and we get their undying loyalty.”
His mother was watching them both with a sly smile turning up her full lips. “I suppose honesty is the theme of today’s meeting,” she drawled playfully. “Which I’m happy about it. It seems you both are quite taken with one another, so far be it from me to get in between true love.”
from him! He was so set on following the Dark Lord’s orders that he failed to see what it was doing to his own
,” the boy whispered.
Draco suddenly came, his cum shooting up between them and coating his small, bouncing tits in splatters of pearly white.
Scorpius’ hair looked adorably mussed from Floo travel. He was dressed in a tiny green jumper that matched his eyes. As soon as he saw Harry, he gave a yip of excitement, his chubby cheeks ruddy.
Harry stood up so fast his chair was almost knocked backwards.
His mother’s eyes darted back and forth between Harry and Draco, her full lips turning down in reproach.
An hour later, Harry and Draco stepped from the Floo in his father’s flat in Knightsbridge, London.
He saw that his clothes had been neatly folded at the foot of the bed, so he got up and quickly dressed. He used the adjoining bathroom to splash water on his face and swill some around his mouth to erase the taste of Firewhisky from his tongue.
to live with that.
He wanted to believe that Harry cared for him
The thoughts and emotions he’d been repressing over the past eight months were pouring out now, a sliver torn in his heart by Narcissa’s memories.
Jack pulled a small envelope from his trouser pocket, walking across the room to hand it to Harry.
He knew that a pregnant Omega needed their mate,
Slick oozed from his hole, a continuous flow between his parted thighs.
And Hermione had been that person for him back then.
him, rutting him deep and soothing the burning hurt wouldn’t abate without his Alpha’s cock to fuck it out of him.
Just as…
Harry’s eyes flickered up from Draco’s throat, catching Jack smiling smugly behind his Omega.
He shifted uncomfortably in his seat, his pup nudging insistently in his belly, making him aware of how badly he needed to relieve his bladder. The water soaking his slacks wasn’t helping, either.
And he belonged to Harry and
Draco pushed back some of Scorpius’ blond hair, a slight tremble to his hand. “My mother went to visit my father last night. She won’t be back for a couple of days and I thought I would be all right on my own. I assured her we would be fine if she wanted to go visit my father for a few days. I just can’t seem to get past this niggling feeling that someone is watching us at the manor. I must sound ridiculous…”
questions.
His dada’s friends’ house was large and elegantly decorated, something Draco was unfamiliar with.
Scorpius giggled when Harry playfully poked his side, grinning down at him.
Draco’s face had flamed, blocking the shameful memory from his mind, not wanting to revisit it.
“Is he mine, Draco? If he is, I want to hear you say it. I want you to tell me the
Harry pressed his fingertips against the wet bud, rubbing them in a small circle.
But...Harry hoped for
“Ah, well, I understand that. He’ll need all of your support during that time. If I didn’t have Ron, I don’t know what would become of me during my heats. It’s no fun to have absolutely no control over your body.”
Omegas were a rarity of their own and even rarer for the Wizarding World.
He was dressed in a sweat dampened work shirt and frayed suspenders. His hands looked work-hewn and tanned.
He would probably never see the boy again and that’s how it should be.
, Draco thought bitterly.
“Hi, kiddo. I missed you so much.” Harry pressed a kiss to Scorpius’ forehead, making him huff and wriggle in his father’s arms. “Did you miss me?”
His own best friend, Hermione Granger, was an an Omega witch. His other best friend, Ron Weasley, was an Alpha wizard. They had gotten married after graduating from Hogwarts and had tried for years to conceive.
The third week of Harry’s absence, Draco had begun exploring the lower levels of the house.
Draco suddenly remembered the promise he had made to himself all those years ago while he’d been standing in front of Sirius’ portrait.
Harry barked out a low laugh. “A
Draco nodded, not lifting his head from the arm of the sofa. “I’ll bring some next time,” he slurred, turning his head slightly, but keeping his eyes closed. “Thank you for putting him to bed.”
No, he didn’t want to participate in the AIP and everything in him rebelled at the idea.
“What?” Lucius asked, crossing his legs. “Can I not be curious why you’re traipsing about with Harry Potter? You’re my son, I have a right to know.”
Harry considered this, still staring at the cowering rabbit.
He had been miserable without Harry these past few months and he was tired of trying to act like their separation didn’t bother him.
“Well,” Draco said, struggling to sit up halfway on the bed. His growing belly was beginning to stunt his movements more and more as time went on. “Can you tell me a bit about what they used to write about Harry? I’m only sixteen and my mother was pregnant with me during the war. I don’t really know much about what caused it.”
He had become more reserved after graduation, always looking as if his mind was a million miles away.
Draco flushed, watching as Harry pressed another open-mouthed kiss to his wrist, feeling the fleeting brush of his tongue against his skin.
“Let me,” he murmured, scooping up the doll and handing it to Juni, who immediately grabbed it and squeezed it to her chest with one arm.
Harry leaned forward, pressing his lips to Draco’s ear. “I have to hear you say it, baby.”
He narrowed his eyes in the suffocating darkness, resolve hardening the fragile edges of his heart.
“Mummy,” Scorpius chirped. “
playing this game.
It wasn’t just that, though.
Draco allowed Harry to lead him to the sofa, waiting for him to sit down first before he did.
He eyed his own dried cum still interspersed in Harry’s chest hair, a primal sort of satisfaction surging within him at the sight.
He hadn’t had time to remember to take his gloves with him to the festival. His mother had insisted he go out and have some fun with Blaise and his little brother, Blake, at Hogsmeade.
Ron sighed. “He said that Draco’s pregnancy was…forced. He admitted that it was rape, Mione. Apparently, he took Draco on as a mate because he wanted revenge for what Draco’s parents participated in during the war.”
, Alpha, I-I need you,” Draco begged sweetly, pressing his leaking breasts against Harry’s chest.
Draco’s lids were lowered to half-mast, his full lips parted. “I ruined it last time, but…will you tell me again? What you said in Hogsmeade after we made love?”
His mother, Narcissa, had picked up his daughter only moments before to watch her while he worked his morning shift at the hospital.
“I’m back, sorry, boys!”
Draco’s hardened nipples stood out against his pale skin, like strawberries against cream.
His Omega pheromones were being pumped into the air, filling the room with the cloying scent.
Draco flushed, delighting in the feel of Harry’s coarse chest hair rubbing against his oversensitive nipples.
Harry looked up from his spot on his sofa.
Draco cringed inwardly. He hadn’t meant to sound so snappish, but Harry’s comment had riled him.
Draco winced, his hand tightening around his cup.
this can’t happen, Harry. You need move on with your life and forget about this—about
She was staring at Harry with wide eyes, one of the fingers of her free hand innocently hooked in her mouth.
He loved his baby, but he wanted to make his own decisions moving forward and he wouldn’t embarrass himself by doing something else that would only result in him depending on someone else for his son’s or his own well-being
Her heels clicked softly against the tiled floors as she swept in. A floating tray holding three cups of hot tea followed behind her, gingerly being set down with his mother’s use of a levitation charm on the antique coffee table in front of them.

Healer, who are you thinking of?”
that the Alpha was nearby, his musky pheromones present in the air around him. The Alpha’s pheromones only exacerbated his heat, his hole wet and dripping slick in preparation for Harry’s cock.
“Your magic is rudimentary at best. It’s obvious you didn’t attend any Wizarding school while under your mother’s care. Your attempts to escape the French Ministry of Magic was quite amusing to hear about.”
That was exactly what Draco hadn’t wanted. He didn’t want to start getting in the way of Harry’s life, getting in the way of his career.
Harry caught him by his upper arms and lifted him until his feet no longer touched the ground.
He had cleaned himself before in his wolf form and knew it was a very proficient way to cleanse.
“And you have no say in this?” Pansy asked, getting to her feet.
Harry wanted to run. He wanted to break something. He wanted to
He didn’t want Harry to be with anyone else and the thought of his Alpha with
The Malfoy name would be reduced to ash soon enough if his father didn’t abate his gambling addiction.
Harry’s cock was hard, pressing against the leg of his trousers. It was long and thick, the enticing edges noticeable against the thin fabric. Draco was ashamed to feel saliva flood his mouth at the sight.
Harry nodded and shoved his hands into the pockets of his coat. “Me too. It’s been quite some time since I was student.”
“If you need pheromones, I’ll provide them,” Harry said huskily. “My protection along with my magic and pheromones, are open to you, whenever you need them.”
“Of course not, Harry,” Kingsley finally conceded. “The Ministry can trust you
Jumping to his feet, he yanked up his trousers and spun around, feeling cold and bereft in the wake of the alpha’s wicked embrace.
Would Draco even
Stop.
Draco stood, brushing off the bits of dirt from the front of his shorts. “Come here, love.”
The boy’s eyes moved restlessly beneath his closed lids, long, blond eyelashes casting shadows on his cheekbones. His clothing was tattered and smudged with dirt, the front of his button-down gaping open at the throat. One of the boy's small, pink nipples was exposed, seeming to taunt Harry.
Harry tilted Draco’s head back by his hair, leaning forward until their lips were almost touching.
behaved behind closed doors. Afterall, he had his unborn pup to think of now. If he could just make it through his pregnancy unscathed, he would plan an escape.
Arlen chuckled, his brown eyes warm. “My mate said the same thing when he was pregnant with our daughter. Impatient to make their entrance into the world, hmm?”
Even though he spoke casually, Draco’s heart clenched.
. The sounds Draco had made that night would probably haunt Harry for the rest of his life. He’d been so—
Two weeks later, Harry was walking down one of the corridors at the Ministry, his thoughts once again centered around Draco.
The man next to his mother was virtual stranger to Draco.
Draco pursed his lips, glaring up at him.
Harry began fingering him, adding one, then another finger, until the boy was speared with four of his pistoning fingers. He lowered his head and sucked one of Draco’s wet nipples into his mouth, drinking the boy’s sweet breast milk as he finger-fucked him.
There was a lot Harry wanted to talk about.
“I didn’t want it to come to this!” she shouted, glaring up at him with hatred now swirling in her eyes. “I wanted to take Draco and get
He gently placed the jacket over the boy’s shoulders, letting his fingers linger against the back of his neck for a moment. He just barely restrained the urge to lean down and fucking
A sudden flare of jealousy made Harry glower at Jack over the top of Draco’s head. He didn’t want Draco sharing his lovely smiles with anyone else. He wanted—
Harry smiled.
Harry was incapable of feeling sad. He was incapable of feeling
Apparently when their house had been swarmed by the French Ministry, Draco had fought tooth and nail to protect his mother.
“Tell me you love me,” Harry whispered, rough and almost inaudible to Draco’s ears.
Maybe if I put another pup in him…
He couldn’t just abandon her. There had to be a way to prove her innocence for whatever crime she had been suspected of committing.
Harry followed Ron to the back of the shop, his eyebrows climbing higher on his forehead as the items for sale grew more nefarious the farther they went in.
Harry smirked and slid the book back into its proper place on the shelf.
Draco shook his head and averted his gaze. “I’ve never even been kissed…” he whispered hoarsely, fighting back even more tears.
A large hand clamped over his mouth, almost making him drop the bottle of wine. He was pulled backwards, stumbling slightly as he tried to stay upright. The person holding him backed them into the shadowed corridor in front of the sitting area.
Draco clumsily got to his knees, widening his stance to accommodate his swollen stomach.
Draco shifted on top of his makeshift nest, rolling fully to his back. Still hugging his stuffed wolf to his chest, he whimpered, spread his legs.
The kisses left a trail of fire in their wake, the burning sensation traveling straight to Draco’s prick. When Harry sealed his lips over Draco’s scent gland on his neck and
Draco cupped his belly with his free hand and gave a curt nod. “I-I’m going to let him take me home, Roland. Thank you for a lovely evening, but I’m tired.”
He was horrified to realize that he had
He didn’t want to be back in London where everyone knew what happened to him. His name was synonymous with his captor’s now and it had taken years for his unwanted fame to finely wane.
Harry stepped forward, his larger body crowding him further into the stall. “Let’s talk about that, hm? I thought I told you to hold off on choosing a substitute alpha.”
Scorpius snuffled against neck, squirming in his arms in an attempt to wriggle from Draco’s arms.
He glanced up at her, studying her profile in the warm sunlight. Her pale cheeks shone with wetness, droplets clinging to her eyelashes.
Draco arched his back, a moan almost slipping past his lips.

How dare he compare him to an animal and insult his background! He hated Potter and he hated that his mother had left him in the care of such a
The right side of the shop must have been the ‘oddities’ section. It had mahogany shelves filled with phials, cursed baubles, and several intricate looking contraptions.
Draco laughed, a lightness filling him that eased his anxiety. “I wouldn’t want to interrupt daddy time.”
“Sorry, Draco. We still have to use the traditional gel to be able to see the embryo better, if it’s there.”
Harry you big GOOF
He wanted to tell Draco to take them out and let him see. He wanted to see his perky tits, see those pretty, pink nipples again. He wanted to watch milk dribble from those swollen peaks, almost as if they were begging for Harry’s mouth.
”Then you should already be aware that Draco Malfoy is under
“That’s not true!” Draco cried out, flinching when Scorpius began showing sounds of rousing due to his outburst.
Harry seemed to lose himself while Draco sucked in bliss, the shields he had been holding strong against their bond coming down and allowing him to feel the brunt of Harry’s hidden feelings.
A small sound emitted from the boy, a cross between a whimper and a sob.
Harry sat on his sofa, lazily smoking a cigarette.
Draco closed his eyes, tears sliding from his eyes. “Please,” he whispered weakly, “stop.”

”Your foolish actions will affect others. Don’t disobey me again.”

The rabbit let out an indignant sniffle, making Harry grin.
Harry gave him a curt nod, crossing his arms over his broad chest.
Harry stooped and pressed his lips to his forehead. He pulled back, his eyes darkening. “Stop looking at me like that while we’re in your father’s home, or I’m taking you over the nearest horizontal surface.”
He couldn’t tell them yet.
The little bunny burrowed into the crook of his elbow, hiding his face from view. He was still rapidly panting, the scent of fear emanating from him in heady waves.
Harry smiled and lifted his hand. “That’s right, sweetheart. Come out and I’ll get you some clothes.”
me, too?”
“You know, I still haven’t figured you out,” he said, almost conversationally, belying the calculating glint in his green eyes.
Jack Ryker opened his door, a smirk on his face.
Maybe if he could bring this thing to fruition to face the light of day, he would feel better, but somehow, he doubted that.
And he regretted ignoring what his heart wanted.
“Okay, this has to stop.”
Although their bond was forced and Harry was his
Draco sighed and went to scoop Scorpius out of his highchair, giving up on trying to feed him for the time being.
“Apparently Lucius had bought a safe house there using untraceable methods of purchase. She’d been living under an alias and suppressing her magic so the locals wouldn’t grow suspicious.”
Like they were—
Draco walked over to them both and took Scorpius from Harry. “Good morning, love. Are you helping?”
Perhaps he would cast
“I’ll have some,” he blurted.
There were cages in the back, but far fewer than in the front of the shop.
Draco’s tears.
His eyes were slightly almond-shaped and pale green, a sharp contrast to his olive skin.
Harry plunged his cock back into his hole, groaning low in his throat as Draco’s channel hungrily enveloped him.
”Such a reaction. I didn’t expect you to be such a slut for it, little one. Let’s go deeper, hm?”
It was—
“Mmm? Oh, yes. Goodbye, then,” Narcissa said distractedly, rummaging around in her purse with her free hand.
Draco meandered out of the manor’s sitting room and through the solarium to exit the sliding glass doors that led to the garden. He had Scorpius sitting on his hip, noticing the pup’s eyes were growing heavy.
The past two weeks had been miserable for him.
Harry placed a comforting hand on Draco’s back, rubbing his palm in soothing circles. “Okay?”
Pansy was single and a Beta, so she had no pups of her own to take up her time, so she spent most of it fretting over Draco.
Draco hugged her to him, placing his chin on top of her head. She was tall for her age, another thing she had inherited from—
It was silent for several moments and then a gruff response, “Come in.”
Harry didn’t concern himself with Wizarding politics anymore since he had retired from the Ministry, but it was entertaining to watch Kingsley fall from favor.
”Such a
Without any further preamble, Harry lowered his hips and aimed, slamming his cock into Draco’s wet hole.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco shook his head, tears sliding down his cheeks. He sprinted from the room, leaving Harry alone.

He had always been innocent, he had never hurt anyone, he didn’t feel hatred like Harry did and he felt—
Draco snorted, hitching Juni higher on his hip. “When have they ever erred on the side of caution? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to give my daughter a bath. I expect you to be gone when I come back out.”
Draco’s throat suddenly felt closed up, his finger now numb from how tightly the thread constricted it.
”This is to teach you,” Potter drawled. “If you continue to defy me, there will be consequences.”
“Lower,” Draco said throatily, biting his lip as Harry’s skilled hands slid incrementally down.
Pansy dried her hands off and walked over to him, crossing her arms over her chest.
Almost half of his pewter button-down was sodden, the crotch of his dark slacks not fairing any better. He sighed and entered the stall.
Harry.
Draco felt a twinge of jealousy. Why couldn’t he have been given to an Alpha like Arlen? He wasn’t as handsome as Harry, but he was so
Once they stepped into the drawing room from the Floo, Harry pulled Draco forward by his arm, making him stumble slightly as he righted his feet.
He was on the precipice of madness. He didn’t want to see anymore.
Arlen shook his head, his eyes softening. “He doesn’t deserve to see you again. Let him rot, Draco. Let him die in the prison he’s created for himself.”
Artificial.
Juniper had had difficulty latching when she was a newborn and Theo’s tongue had been the only thing able to soothe his pain after breastfeeding.
Harry slowly walked down the row of cages, pulling his wand from his pocket.
For the past few days, he had been experiencing twinges of pain in his lower back. It was steadily worsening, the twinges turning into
Draco’s eyes widened, his breath hitching. “W-what? I’m not going to

“What a show you put on, pet, but I’m done playing. You’re wet and we both know we’ll feel better after this.”
He supposed that was what relationships were all about. Respecting someone’s boundaries while also being there for them if they ever needed someone to rely upon.

Harry came inside of him, moaning low, kissing up his breasts and throat. When their lips met, Draco lost himself in it. Harry’s cum, leaked from his hole, dripping down his thighs and reminding him that he was—
Harry sped up his thrusts, avoiding
“Yes, of course, darling,” he cooed to his son. “I’m sorry for being gone so long, love.”

he had.
“Draco, please reconsider. I’m asking you to stay with me. I’ll keep my distance if you want. I won’t even speak to you while you’re here, if that’s what you want, but please, just don’t go.”
,” he said softly.
As an Alpha, he’d considered dating an Omega, but had always been afraid of accidentally getting one pregnant.
Water sluiced down his chest, catching on his pebbled nipples. His body was reacting to his Alpha’s pheromones, slick beginning to seep from his hole and slip down his cleft, mixing with the water from his shower. His inner Omega knew when his Alpha was upset, his body becoming instinctually pliant and ready to soothe him.
“Care for a chat, Malfoy?”
He had hidden the love bites from Draco on his neck with a complexion charm. For some reason, that disappointed Draco.
Harry let out a low groan and shoved his nose against Draco’s marked gland, licking and sucking at it. “Beg me for it, Omega, beg me,” he murmured hoarsely against his skin.
“Wordless spells,” Draco murmured. “You’ve always been skilled with them. I suppose that’s why you’re an asset to the Ministry’s protection department. The
That didn’t last long.
He wrapped one arm around Draco’s waist, tightening his hold and digging his heels into the bed. He began snapping his hips against the boy, fucking into his hole with unrestrained tenacity, his harsh thrusts making the boy fall forward before Harry would drag him back up for more.
The evening was unfolding nicely, and Harry’s friends seemed smitten with Scorpius. He could tell his pup was getting tired by the way he kept popping his thumb in in his mouth and by how his lids were lowered to half-mast over his green eyes.
He was fine with rutting some faceless Beta when his baser urges got the better of him.
He sighed, shifting Scorpius on his lap. His son continued to whimper and nuzzle at his chest and Draco’s breath hitched, his swollen chest reacting to his pup’s needy cries.
Seeming satisfied with his answer for now, Harry stood, picking up Draco bridal style.
“Harry, I know you’re angry—”
Harry leaned back on the sofa with Scorpius in his arms, looking down at Draco under hooded lids. His gaze flicked over Draco’s chest before saying, “Maybe I didn’t take
“For fuck’s sake,” Potter snapped. “Do as I say.”
“I’d rather
”D-dada,” the boy stammered, his thighs trembling as he tried to remain upright.
The rabbit’s fur brushed against his fangs with each lick, making Harry unable to repress a shudder.
The Ministry still didn’t have any solid leads and the days had turned into months with still no word.

“So, you work in… finances?”
Scorpius whined and tried to swat the plate away. “

“Anyone would be better than you,” he hissed. “At least with an Alpha who
. Wanted him to
Draco drank in the sight of Harry’s thick erection straining against the front of his dark trousers, his dry mouth suddenly wet with excess saliva. He made quick work of unzipping Harry and pulling out his cock. His reddened shaft looked almost painfully hard, the head shiny with pre-cum.
“What is it, baby? Do you want Dada between your thighs, soothing that
Draco was wearing a light blue short-sleeved shirt, his slender, pale arms on full display. His blond hair had gotten longer over the past few months, some of the longer strands tucked behind his ears.
The Detention Area.
Draco’s vision blurred, a small hiccup escaping him.
“A-Arlen?” Draco stammered.
Draco keened and pinched his own nipples between his fingers, undulating under Harry’s skilled mouth and fingers.
An insidious, hated voice whispered over the memory, loud and clear:
Draco pulled his wrist away from Harry’s fingers and he could have sworn Harry had briefly tightened his grip before letting go.
Harry barely had time to react as Hermione’s daughter, Rose, barreled into him from out of the emerald flames of the Floo.
Harry rested his head back against his pillow, unsure of how to proceed or how to react to such a sight.
He met Harry’s eyes and reluctantly murmured, ”Thank you for, um, cleaning up. You didn’t have to do that.”
Harry stepped back, his back hitting the hard wall. He slid down to a sitting position. He knew that the Ministry would flood the prison with Aurors when they discovered Narcissa missing.
, Harry.”
speaking, I have a better use for your disobedient mouth and hands.”
, no one else’s.”
child, Draco, and you’re
Using only his grip on his neck, Harry tossed Draco backwards on the bed and went to sit in the armchair across from the bed. He was still naked, his cock hard and leaking between his legs.
Draco shot to his feet, wrapping his hands around stomach. “I don’t know what that
Rose grinned and pressed her elbow close to Harry’s mouth.
“You can take it,” Harry grated, just before sucking Draco’s prick into his mouth.
Harry took a long drag of his cigarette and continued reading.
His Alpha was exuding anger and he went instinctively pliant to show him that he was completely defenseless if Harry wanted to hurt him. He bared his throat and funneled his fear into their shared bond, trying to convey to his Alpha that he was vulnerable and aching.
He stubbed out his cigarette and stood. He was about to make coffee when Kreacher ambled into the kitchen.
Draco’s hand was frozen on his stomach, his eyes widening slightly as he waited for Harry to finish his thought.
The boy shook his head, stepping back. He crossed his arms over his chest, his shoulders stiff.
Harry smirked against his neck, giving small licks to heal the teeth marks he’d left on his throat.
When his mouth was finally hovering over the boy’s soft prick, he vacillated.
“But anyway,” Hermione cleared her throat, setting down her cup. “I brought you a present, Draco.”
Scorpius whined and wiggled in his arms, reaching for Draco. Harry offered the pup to his mother.
Roland shrugged, dusting off a piece of invisible lint from his suit jacket. “Some of us work directly for the Minister, not that you would understand.” He paused, smirking. “Well, I suppose I understand why
Looking down at his sated rabbit, possessive pride washed over him.
And it was ribbed.
The room seemed to shift back into focus. Harry looked up.
Harry grabbed the knife from Draco and carelessly tossed it to the side.

If he was pregnant, he wouldn’t want Harry anywhere near him again. His baby would be solely reliant on him and he couldn’t let that monster anywhere near his precious pup,
He unbuttoned the front of his shirt with one hand, revealing the pale swell of his engorged breast. A small bead of breast milk slid down from the boy’s pink nipple; Harry unable to stop himself from following the droplet with his eyes.
Draco pulled Scorpius flush against his chest, glancing down. His pup was still softly suckling, his blond lashes lowered over his round cheeks. One of his chubby hands was gripping the front of Draco’s shirt, his fingers slowly loosening as he dozed off.
knowing the difference between its Alpha and a toy.
He had fallen in love with Draco.
Harry suppressed a groan.
“You had a busy day. Did you enjoy your visit with Hermione, pet?” Harry asked, his deft hands lulling Draco into dazed state of contentment.
After he had decided to show Harry the truth about Scorpius’ conception, he hadn’t been sleeping much. He had been worrying non-stop about Harry’s reaction to his secret memory. He had no doubt in his mind that Harry would hate him after viewing it.
“Narcissa.”
Deep down, he still foolishly held hope that Harry would change. In the beginning, he deluded himself into thinking that when their pup was born, Harry would become a changed man.
There was something that had weakened it, though.
Harry smiled, bending to kiss the base of one of the boy’s soft ears.
, I had to find a job that was furtive. It turns out, the sight of my scars turns most people’s stomachs, so I was forced to find work where I would remain out of sight.”
Draco pulled his finger from his mouth and grinned before picking his fork back up.
Draco shook his head, smiling shyly. “A few, but nothing I’m set on.”
Harry had put his hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling in quiet contemplation.
The boy was all gangly, delicate looking limbs and pale skin. The boy’s flaccid prick was pressed against Harry’s thigh, feeling like a brand upon his skin.

that needed rescuing.
Draco’s ears burned. “A l-little bit, I guess.”
“N-no one. I just wanted to get some fresh air.”
“I’m not a horse!” he cried out, struggling against Potter and flinching when he heard the material of his shirt tear down the front.
As the singed remnants of the magazine had floated around in the air around his head, his mother had cast him a wry look. She had been holding Scorpius while cooking, Scorpius giggling with delight at his mother’s use of destructive magic out of nowhere.
Harry turned and gently wrapped his arm around Draco’s middle, pulling him back until his back was flush against his sticky chest.
me?” Draco stammered.
, too personal.
really is.”
With a high-pitched moan, Draco lifted his hips. His small prick was hard, the pink crown seeping pre-cum across his flat stomach.
“Tell me? Please?” he begged, placing one of his hands flat on Harry’s chest.
“Please, Hermione,” Draco begged. “She is my mother. I want her to know that I love her and that I’m doing okay. That’s all, nothing more.”
...” the boy sighed, his prick growing noticeably hard against Harry’s thigh.
He had ran a shallow bath for the rabbit, intending to bathe him.
The boy was trembling under his hands, his pink rim stretched over his cock, his rabbit’s scut tickling Harry’s skin as the white fur pressed against his lower stomach.
The man gave small chuckle in response, laugh lines forming around his mouth.
Draco shook his head, but pressed into Potter’s touch, arching his hips. The finger against his hole stilled.
They had been picked out by his daughter. He’d told her he was going to visit a sick friend in the hospital, and she’d insisted on him bringing flowers to the person.
and it only worsened as time went on.
When he had finally emptied himself inside of Draco, Harry gingerly slid his cock out of the boy’s hole.
“N-no more, it’s too much!” Draco whined.
Harry smirked. “That’s better. Now, let’s loosen you up a bit.”
“Well, my girlfriend is currently in Romania visiting her brother. I’m never home most of the time anyway, so there would be plenty of room. It would be no trouble at all, and I’ll have my Aurors stationed at the manor for a few days. You and the pup would be safe in my home, I promise, Draco. No one would be able to breach the wards at Grimmauld Place, I assure you.”
Draco’s pleasure as if it were his own.
He pressed closer, the stiff fabric of his dark riding coat brushing against Draco’s nipples.
Harry grinned. “I saw you across the street. I thought I’d come over and say hello.”
To make it even worse, he also didn’t want to acknowledge the fact that his pup was more active in Harry’s presence. It was the most they had moved in his belly all week.
Harry stared down at Draco, imagining him fucking himself with a toy.
Draco calling him by that after finally telling him he loved him was like being finally recognized for what he truly desired to be for his family.
His daily routine was becoming maddening.
Harry clenched his jaw, a determined look in his green eyes. “I just want to help, Draco. I can’t if you’re not honest with me—”
“Would you like some wine, Draco?” Harry offered, still facing the stove.
He let out a startled gasp, almost losing his balance on the slippery surface beneath his feet.
”Eh, you don’t want him. He bites and bloody
of him again.
He realized that if he was able to escape tonight, he wouldn’t see his Alpha again.
The cell was just as depressing as the rest of the prison. The only light within was moonlight that spilled in through a narrow window too high up for a prisoner to reach. Even if they were able to reach it by some unknown feat, it was only two inches thick in width and height. Nothing was escaping through that window but sound and the desperate hopes of the prisoner housed within.
Draco gaped, glancing down at where his clothes were still wet with water.
Harry arched a brow, feigning deep concern. “Ah, you’re absolutely right, dove. Bring it closer, I’ll kiss it better.”
With an aching snap, Harry erected his shields again, denying Draco the pleasure of their mating bond.
While this woman had 16 years to do as she pleased, his most closest friends and family laid dead and buried. They hadn’t been given such time as Narcissa had taken.
He was ashamed to feel even more slick trickle from his hole, dripping to the floor between Harry’s feet.
me, he would worship me instead of not talking to me and acting unbelievably cruel.”
It had been amazing—

“That was sweet, Draco. Was it like you had imagined with your
Draco nodded, his ears flattening coyly against the back of his head. Harry pressed his mouth to his rabbit’s, reaching down to press his cock back to Draco’s opening, sinking in.
Harry didn’t turn to look at him. “Nothing.”
after, I’m just saying that when you have children, it brings a lot of things into perspective.” Hermione sighed. “They bring the good out of you, even if you thought there never was any to begin with...”
”Do you forgive Dada for his terrible behavior?”
Like a wave crashing over him, he felt it. Oh, how he felt.
Couldn’t he keep this
It was easier to hide from your fears than to face them.
Harry chuckled, low and throaty. “You can lie to yourself all you want, pet. It won’t change the fact that you spread your legs for me for days, only sated when I was sheathed to the hilt in that stretched, wet little opening of yours.”
Without another word, he pulled back and left, the door quietly snicking closed behind him.
Draco averted his gaze, looking down to where Harry was holding his wrist.
Draco’s gray eyes hardened. “I don’t need anyone’s

When they came to a halt in front of large door, the girl turned around and crossed her arms over her chest, giving him a withering look.
Harry was dressed in one of his usual button-downs, dark green with black slacks. His dark hair was styled in the way that Draco loved—stylishly mussed but pushed away from his handsome face.
Things were simple with the charming Beta woman. She was easy to talk to and they both lived for their careers. She had demanding job as sports editor for the Daily Prophet and often traveled for work.
Even now, with Harry’s pheromones so prevalent in the air around him, his hole hadn’t stopped secreting slick. The sticky, warm substance oozed from his hole, coating his arse and inner thighs.
The baby could sense their Alpha parent’s own unique blend of magic and pheromones from inside the womb and if they were separated, the pregnancy would almost always end in miscarriage or still-birth.
Draco silently obeyed, sitting on the edge of the sofa next to the Healer.
”I’m sure with a little care and grooming, he’ll be a fine pet. Come here, sweetheart,” Harry cooed, offering his fingers to smell.
“I was going to whip your soft hands as punishment but seeing as they’re in the process of forming calluses, I’ll have to deliver your punishment in another way.”
“You’re not in trouble, little one. I just don’t have any food here that would suit your palate. In the morning, I’ll go to the store and get some food just for you, okay?”
Harry scoffed. “Please, Draco. Let’s not waste time with your theatrics, shall we? A skilled liar, you are not, pet. I think that’s what I like most about you—your
“And the money from…him?”
,” she said dryly.
His rabbit let out a high-pitched gasp, coming into the water.
But what about his mother?
Draco mewled, placing his hands over Harry’s and pressing down harder.
Draco closed his eyes, feeling like a prat for imagining such a sentimental thing.
But she was still the same Hermione.
The juxtaposition of the riotous emotions running through him was inexplicably confounding.
Draco chewed in silence for a moment before blurting, “How do you know my parents? You mentioned my parents when you were…” Draco blushed hotly, thinking of Harry’s fingers between his thighs, “
Harry released Draco’s leg and dropped down, placing the hand that had been holding up his leg next to the boy’s head, his other hand still clutching the back of the sofa. One of his knees was still beside Draco’s hip on the sofa, his other foot on the floor, his leg bent slightly and supporting his weight.
Harry stared down at him and for a moment, he almost thought Harry looked

Sometimes she brought her cute daughter, Rose. Draco loved when they came to visit, because it was the only times he actually felt
“I know, I need a shave, don’t I, Scorpius?” Harry chuckled when Scorpius slid his stubby fingers higher and tried to poke at his teeth.
He quickly turned the photo over on the table, clearing his throat.
you have caused me?”
,” Draco muttered.
A sharp pain sliced through his lower back, making him whimper.
He looked…
Harry stared straight ahead, trying to control his facial expression. “I could do that, yes.”
Harry gently placed his hand on Draco’s bare breast, stopping him just before Draco could pop his nipple into Scorpius’ mouth. “Not tonight, baby. Tomorrow. You drank, remember?”
“You okay?” he asked, a tinge of concern lacing his words.
Harry groaned twining his other arm around Draco’s waist and pulling him flush against his chest. “And your heats? How have you been getting through them without me, sweetheart?”
The silence after his confession was weighted, heavy with things he had left unsaid between them for years. An errant tear slipped down his cheek and he angrily swiped it away, averting Harry’s widening eyes.
In the mornings it would feel as if tiny lightning bolts were zapping the underside of his chest, his milk let-down even more uncomfortable since beginning to wean.
“I have to—
“You’re wet.”
,” Draco tutted weakly. “You have to eat solid food now, I’ll nurse you soon, love.”
The man behind the counter had been totally still, but upon hearing Ron’s voice, raised his head. His movements were stilted and eerie, like a marionette being controlled by strings.
Draco looked up, arching a brow. “A present? For the baby?”
His dada’s eyes softened. “Oh, don’t make those eyes at me, baby. You’re my
“You’ve already had your first heat?”
After Harry had moved to the other nipple, he realized that Draco was rocking his hips and moaning unintelligible things.
Gingerly, he had raised one of his shaking fingers and traced the sharp slant of Harry’s nose.
his Omega’s arousal?
. I promise, I’ll be good,” he begged softly.
Draco stepped into the Floo, his pup wriggling in his arms. He had an inscrutable expression on his beautiful face, his emotions closed off to Harry.
The boy sniffled and let out a high-pitched shriek.
For good measure, he let some of the waning stream splatter against Draco’s thighs, ensuring his scent and proprietary claim. Draco moaned softly when the hot liquid hit his bare skin, pulling his stuffed wolf back against his chest.
Harry’s mouth watered, remembering the feel of the rabbit’s taut nipples beneath his tongue each night. The predator within him came surging forth, ravenous for the taste of the rabbit’s flesh against his tongue, his cock swiftly hardening beneath his trousers.
“What about the boy’s father? You couldn’t stay with him for a while?”
,” Harry rasped. “When I’m around you, I can’t help but want you, Draco. I
“You look downright
He couldn’t stand the thought of some other Alpha scenting his Omega’s need.
When Harry shifted, Draco pressed his hands to his chest to still him. “W-wait, Harry.”
Slick oozed from Draco’s hole, coating his hand and Harry’s fingers.
“Dada,” the boy said softly, arching his back.
Before he could react, Potter had closed the distance separating them and had his upper arm in his punishing grasp.
Draco shifted Scorpius to his hip, fidgeting with his jumper and trying to come up with a plausible reason for Harry’s current presence. “Harry was just leaving, he,
Theo still had Potter’s horse, the reins clenched tightly in his white-knuckled hands. Pansy’s mobcap was askew on her head, tendrils of her dark hair sticking to her cheeks and lips. Her dark eyes skated over Draco’s torn shirt and hay-covered trousers.
…” Draco whispered, stepping closer to him.
His heart knew it was
“They love Scorpius, Harry,” he whispered, “
Harry slowly knelt, putting himself at eye-level with Draco on the sofa. He smiled and brushed his knuckles against Draco’s cheek in a fleeting caress.
Hermione felt as if the floor beneath her feet shifted. “Y-you must be mistaken. Harry would never do something like that, he—”
It was a program that had been created in London to help pregnant omegas that were without their alpha, no matter the circumstance.
“I never knew him,” Draco said softly.
He felt trapped.
”No? No one touched you?”
The sound of Draco’s pained cries echoed in his mind, slowly pulling at the already fragile seams of his unraveling sanity.
The same eyes as his father’s.
“Y-you expect me to just

He dragged the struggling boy facedown back to the makeshift nest, his thoughts solely focused on breeding.
The item that Pansy wanted couriered was a wrapped lunch. He didn’t question as to
Harry scoffed. “As if I’d willingly follow someone like you. How I got landed with babysitting a pure-blooded brat like you—“
“And how are you doing?”
”So beautiful, so lovely,” Harry rasped, pushing back some of Draco’s long, soft hair.
Draco blushed and shook his head. “I couldn’t sleep, so I was just walking…”
All eyes swiveled to her.
His dada turned, stooping to whisper in one of his ears, “Go to the kitchen and help Pansy prepare the food, sweetheart. I’ll be in the dining room with my friends. Be a good boy tonight and I’ll reward you when we get home.”
They were all seated in Harry’s kitchen at the long wooden table, having finished the meal Draco had helped Harry prepare. Hermione and her husband, Ron, were sitting across from them. Harry was sitting between Draco and Ginny, smiling fondly at Hermione and Scorpius.
Harry stopped playing with his hair, going quiet behind him.
“About what?” Harry began smoothing back Draco’s hair with his hand, the motion lulling Draco into a sense of contentedness.
that much more intense. Eventually, Harry had begun sleeping in bed with him at night after they would fuck.
-girlfriend—”
Harry moved Draco’s trembling fingers lower to gently press them against his lips, his eyes hooded with desire. “Your hands are cold…”
Harry tucked himself back into his trousers, zipping back up. His eyes had that cruel glint back, his emotions indecipherable due to his steadfast shields.
Draco gave Hermione an apologetic smile. “I’m sorry about the way I’m acting, Hermione. It really is just hormones. I cry about everything these days.”
“Just a sandwich made with some of the leftover chicken I made for Scorpius today. He didn’t eat much of it. I hope you’re hungry.”
Even though he was still healing from his time spent in captivity, his daughter had healed the parts of him that he thought would never mend. He had thought wrong all those years ago.

His chest ached with Harry so close.
Harry clicked his tongue. “Already wet, are we? I’ve barely touched you. You must need this badly.”
He knew what the word
She looked at Draco, arching a blonde brow. “Draco?”
He had lost control.
This was very different from their bath time when the boy was in his rabbit form. If Harry cleaned the boy’s prick with his tongue, he would be risking letting his instincts take over.
Draco nodded slowly. “I see.”
Draco’s knees grew weak with desire, but he was still afraid.
The Healer at the Ministry who’d been monitoring his vitals had told Harry that Draco had been given a prolonged sleeping potion.
He looked down, noticing that Draco had one small hand still clutching his stuffed wolf on the floor, his small body shaking underneath of Harry.
And tell her how she would never see those children or Draco ever again.
The boy took one of Harry’s large hands and moved it to his own chest, directly over his heart.
Harry pulled him closer and shook his head. “No, we’re not, Draco. We’re just here as friends. I promise.”
The scent of the other Alpha was faint, but still there.
Draco smiled at Hermione. They were seated in the kitchen, having tea. The envelope in his trouser pocket felt as if it were burning a hole through the material.
Draco only hoped that Harry still wanted
“W-wait!” Draco stammered, pulling Harry back by the collar of his shirt. “I’ll..

clothes all in his exact size. He had even been given hair ties for his long hair. After he had tied his hair up in a haphazard half-knot, he’d stared at his reflection in the mirror of the bathroom.
“Say goodbye to Harry, Scorpius. We’re leaving now, love.”
After Voldemort’s defeat sixteen years ago, herbivores were now perpetually wary of carnivores due to the crazed blood-line purist’s influence.
He went to take a step forward, but Draco’s words echoed in his mind.
He kept blaming his feelings on his instincts, but he didn’t even believe himself anymore. It was more than instincts. He
Harry narrowed his eyes. “So, I’m back to ‘
“This is just like the rest of you,” Potter said almost conversationally. “Soft, but a lovely shade of pink.”
“I’ll leave you two to it then,” Jack said, closing the door behind him.
He gave a short nod and stepped back up to the mare’s stall, reaching forward once again.
A featherlight caress across his forehead made him softly moan, shifting on the sofa to a more comfortable position.
As a man, Harry wanted the boy.
Harry trailed behind Ron as they were led to the back of the shop, behind a sealed door.
“Are you all right?” he asked, coming forward to sit next to him on the bed.
Draco reached up with a shaking hand to touch his throat where Potter had held him.
When it was obvious that the feisty Omega wasn’t going down without a fight, they’d begun giving him sleeping potions in an attempt to avoid him injuring himself or others.
Each memory was like a nail in his coffin that his hatred had built.
Draco’s eyes narrowed and he ripped his arm from Harry’s grasp, adjusting his hold on Scorpius. ”None of your business,
Harry scooted closer to him on the sofa, his knee brushing against the boy’s once more, but it hadn’t been on accident that time.
Just yesterday, he had been pulling back the sheets on his bed, appreciating how soft the material felt beneath his hand. Like a bolt, a hazy image of Harry slowly thrusting into his limp body from behind while Draco fisted the sheets tightly had played in his mind.
for him. He craved Harry’s cum and pheromones, his stomach quivering with excitement.
Without his suppressants or potions, Draco would be nothing more than a whimpering whore, spreading his legs to invite any hard, thick cock in the vicinity to fuck the hurt out of him.
The boy furiously blushed, but did as he was told. He began wanking himself and Harry smirked before returning his tongue to his rabbit’s fluttering hole.
He was emboldened by Harry’s grunts and strained breathing but felt bereft because Harry still refused to touch him. His hands were still grasping the edge of the desk, almost as if he needed to hold onto something to stop himself from touching Draco.
He could feel his knot forming at the base of his cock, pressing painfully against his tight skin.
“When is his birthday?” Harry asked tonelessly.
Without saying anything, Draco walked around his father’s desk and reached out his hand to card through Harry’s raven hair. He let out a sharp gasp when Harry snatched his wrist, stopping him.
For real, sorry for taking so long to update this fic. I know many of you have been waiting patiently for me to update and I am sincerely grateful for all my readers and their amazing patience. 🖤
He had become worried over the last month. His baby hadn’t been moving as much as they should have been this far along, but he had been in denial about it.
His heady scent was everywhere. It called out to Draco, his body reacting naturally to the man’s dominant pheromones. Draco knew his heat was close, the man’s scent seeming to exacerbate his symptoms.
Ron raised an eyebrow but didn’t comment on Harry’s lack of attention. “Kingsley said that Draco will be put into the new Omega breeding program. There’s a limited number of Omegas in London right now and most of them are either too old or too young.”
Harry smirked, his fangs aching in his mouth due to proximity and smell of the vulnerable rabbit. The predator within him sensed its natural prey.
Draco didn’t know what he would do if he was told that he was pregnant.
Harry crossed his arms over his broad chest. “I’m not scared of Lucius, Draco. I’d like to take you there, just to make you’re both safe before I leave again.”
“Hello again, Scorp,” Harry greeted warmly, ruffling Scorpius’ hair into further disarray.
Question: do you want Draco to address Harry as Dada, Daddy, or Papa? Let me know, I’ll let you guys choose. 😏 For right now, I’ll use Dada.
Hermione smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “You’ll understand when you have children, Harry. You’d do anything for them.
Fed using Draco’s sweet suffering.
Harry stood there, feeling the overwhelming need to gather the trembling boy into his arms. “You don’t sound ridiculous at all, Draco. Would you like me to station some of my Aurors at the manor? I can have them there within the next hour if that would alleviate some of your fear.”
Draco flushed and let his legs fall open in surrender when Harry went back to kissing down his stomach, nuzzling against his sparse pubic hair before he felt Harry’s wet tongue press against his leaking prick.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s expression was familiarly reticent, closed off from Draco as he gazed up at him.
Harry’s rabbit slowly maneuvered to his hands and knees between Harry’s spread legs. He was small enough to fit, the tips of his lax ears just breaching the surface of the water.
”Bite this,
“I’m sorry to intrude like this, Narcissa, but I need to speak with Draco. Alone.”
Draco’s mother had always made sure that his education on the Wizarding World had been thorough. Even though he hadn’t attended a Wizarding school, his mother had taught him everything he needed to know.
Draco was silent for a moment before reluctantly whispering, “
There was one other reason as well...

That was fine with Harry.

Another wave of burning heat hit, making saliva pool in Draco’s mouth and slick gush from his hole.
What could Ron want to talk about arriving unannounced in the middle of the day?
Harry reached forward with his free hand and took Draco’s face between his fingers, pinching. “Then get to it, pet.”
Narcissa sighed, adjusting Scorpius’ tiny jacket. “No, nothing has happened. Auror Ryker was insistent that I come to the Ministry this week for a follow up interview about the events that happened.”
Hermione giggled and nodded, some of her curls falling from behind her ears. “Believe it or not, there was a time when
Draco Malfoy would be fine without him. All of his Aurors were more than proficient at their jobs and would figure out who had broken into Draco’s home. He didn’t need to supervise the investigation and he
!” Draco sobbed, unwillingly spreading his legs for his Alpha.
Potter brought down his hand in a hard slap right on his aching, wet hole, making him keen around the glove.
“Do you want Dada to beg?” his voice dropper lower, thicker, “make your Dada beg to fuck you the way you want—the way we
There was something broken inside of Draco, something he didn’t like to face when he was alone with himself.
Another wave of searing heat washed over him, his thighs clamping shut, sticking together due to all of the slick seeping from his hole. He sucked in a sharp inhale through his gritted teeth, screwing his eyes shut even further.
“You know I would do anything for you, baby,” he said in a low voice. “If you want me there, I’ll be there.”
Ginny pouted, but immediately brightened. “It’s okay, Harry. I know you’ve been under a lot of stress recently because of the Ministry. I actually wanted to tell you that I’m going to Romania tomorrow to see Charlie. I haven’t seen him since last Christmas and he’s apparently met someone special who he wants me to meet.”
Of course he hadn’t forgotten.
“Oh,” Draco breathed, his heart thumping heavily in his chest. “Are you still angry with me, Harry?”
He didn’t want to be a nuisance to Harry.
“Hmm?”
Draco hadn’t pressed further.
Arlen took a deep breath and sat up straighter. “Well, we could be here for hours if I went into all of that, but I can tell you a bit. Harry Potter was the reason the war was won in the first place. He killed Voldemort and stopped most of his Death Eaters. The ones that survived are all rotting in Azkaban now. Good riddance, if you ask me. The Prophet continued to write about Harry well after the war. He’s been in the limelight most of his life.”
He tasted bile in the back of his throat, remembering when Harry had raped him. That hadn’t been
When Draco pulled back, he could only stare in awe as Draco shucked off his shirt, baring his perfect tits. They were smaller now due to not producing as much milk for their pup, but still
He was tired of being jerked around like a dog on a too-short chain.
If Harry couldn’t forgive him for that, he would understand.
The side of the man’s full lips were doing that twitching motion again where it looked like he was going to smile, but never did.
“If you really don’t want me, use this instead.”
Draco took the leaking head into mouth, swiping his tongue up the slit.
“You have a visitor, Auror Potter.”
A niggling sort of dread surfaced in the back of Draco’s mind, his own self-doubt and insecurities suddenly swarming his post-sex hazed mind.
Everything he did, he did for Scorpius.
It hadn’t been the answer he wanted and deep down, it wasn’t the answer Draco wanted to give.
The boy came with sharp cry, never releasing the hold on his stuffed rabbit.
He put his hat on with his shaking hands, leaving his heart behind in the room he had left.
Draco felt a pang in his heart, all of the sudden feeling very inadequate. He hadn’t even finished school yet. He had sacrificed his final year to rest at home while pregnant. His pregnancy hadn’t been the easiest and the Healers at St Mungo’s had recommended taking the year off.
sucking me off, Draco? How does it feel, knowing that I’m the one who gets you hard? If I reach between your legs, will I find you
Even though he was only sixteen, he knew that love was
Draco got to his feet, cupping his stomach. “You’re leaving now?”
After he had been shown to his room, he had to grit his teeth from saying anything that would be untoward.
Draco’s eyelids fluttered open, his gaze connecting with Harry’s.
“What about this one?” Harry asked, cocking his head to the side as he studied the rabbit.
wouldn’t exactly be the right word. More like
are more important, Draco. My
Harry effortlessly deflected the candleholder using his magic and lunged after Draco. He tackled the boy to the ground from behind, grabbing a handful of his blond hair and jerking back his head.
In the end, both parties were consumed by the flames.
Without any preamble, Harry lowered his head and sank his teeth into Draco’s scent gland on his neck.
But…she was coming up blank.
”It’s quite a list of candidates. You need our pheromones that badly?”
Omega and you’re carrying
He still hadn’t told her the truth about Harry and Scorpius. He didn’t know if he was ready to yet. His mother could probably live with the truth, but his
He shifted Draco in his arms, retrieving the stoppered phial from his pocket. He used his teeth to remove the cork, spitting it to the side. He pressed the glass phial against Draco’s lips.
Before Harry could react, the boy shoved out from underneath of him and tried to crawl away. His escape was hindered by his refusal to drop his stuffed animal and Harry was quicker, his predator instincts kicking in.
“You shouldn’t push yourself like that, Draco,” Harry gently reprimanded.
Draco knew he had to say it, but it was still difficult for him. He had kept the secret well-hidden since Scorpius’ birth and it was no easy feat to spill your soul’s most heavily guarded secret.
you want me?” he scoffed, dropping his hand and straightened. “I loved you and you spurned me. You withheld the truth from me about Scorpius and lied to my face each time we were together.”
“Fuck you!” Draco pursed his lips to spit, but Harry grabbed his cheeks between his strong fingers, squeezing.
Draco ruffled Scorpius’ hair with one hand, never taking his eyes off Harry.
, but then, he added, “
Harry snorted and reached down with one hand, unzipping the front of his trousers, pulling out his long, thick cock. It was hard, the head beading with pre-cum.
Harry covered Draco’s fumbling hand with his own, steadying it. He smirked when the boy blushed. “It’s all right, Draco. It doesn’t bother me.”
It wasn’t conniving or condescending. It was just a genuine smile.
Draco shook his head. “Not now. I just want to sit for a bit, if that’s okay.”
Those early years had been the worst. He’d managed to escape some of it when a dodgy strip club owner noticed he could dance. A less dodgy strip club owner had seen that too, and Draco had optimistically left his old lodgings. Only he found himself back on the streets again after shifts, because he struggled so much to make ends meet. Once caught in the act in the back alley he got fired from his job and was forced to come crawling back to his old place. He didn’t know where else to go. This was the only thing he knew how to do.
“Rude,” Potter scoffed. “I bet I can build a much better snowman than you anyway.”
“I take it you’ve been looking at your map again?”
“But-”
“Dad, can you put me down?” She asked as she eyed her crying godfather. Ron obliged. Rose didn’t want him or her mom or Uncle Harry to be sad, but as Uncle Harry was the most sad Uncle Harry needed the most help.
“Welcomest is not a word.”
Draco let out a long groan but failed to help when he was dragged to his feet. One featherlight charm later he was carried in someone’s arms. Potter’s arms, probably. Draco’s fever brain couldn’t process that, and he conked out indefinitely on Potter’s shoulder. A bit of rest, peace and quiet was honestly the best Christmas present he’d gotten in a very long time.
. Make sure you see them, throw an impromptu party, invite them over for high tea, take them out to dinner. In fact, I would like to assign you some homework with this letter, which is plan something with your friends. It can be anything, from a walk in the park to a holiday to Greece. Just make sure they know how much you appreciate them.
I feel like I need to tell you my name.
“I’m sorry about going all therapist mode on you. I have a lot of feelings on the subject, apparently.” Potter joined him in blushing and stared at the table between them, biting his bottom lip. “If it’s any consolation, I surprised myself too with that tirade. I don’t usually…
Draco was confused for a second, until he remembered his snide comment from their last meeting. He blushed again.
“I think I do.”
But now he had, and it was with great difficulty that he tore himself away from the hospital ward and found his way to bed. He’d much rather stick around and
“Maybe because I’m right.” His mother gave him a pointed look. “Hold on, let me rephrase that. I'm your mother. I'm always right”
Did he? Did he still have Harry? They’d been dating for a little over a year now, though it felt much longer because they’d gotten so close so fast. But he had just stormed out on him and his family after insulting someone who was basically his mother. He doubted Harry would take kindly to that. Plus, he knew that Harry wanted to be a lot more ‘out’ than him. They’d had some arguments about that in the past month.
“I get too angry.”
“No.” Draco shook his head. It had never played that big a part in any of his relationships. He and Pansy had just shared a bed for a few years. Theo had mostly needed a comforting hug which was often paired with kissing, but nothing else. Draco wasn’t even sure if he could call that a relationship; It had never gotten official. And Astoria was usually too tired for it, which he now knew had been the blood curse awakening.
feel like shit. It’s not…. This doesn’t feel like it’ll have an easy fix. Or any fix at all.”
Draco was shaking. He didn’t know what to do with this information, with this sudden change on his day, with Harry being in his flat. He couldn’t stop staring at a stain on his kitchen cabinet and he couldn’t stop trying to do up his buttons even though Harry tried to keep his hands away from his robes.
Draco froze for a moment as Harry went silent. He feared for what was about to come. Did Harry agree with what Mrs Weasley had said? Because if so, Draco didn’t think he could continue seeing him. He’d experienced firsthand what a terrible idea it was to follow one’s parents or any adult blindly. A child was still a person, and the boundaries of any person were sacred in his eyes.
What better time to update an almost abandoned WIP then in the middle of exam week?
“Draco, I know what you’re doing, and you need to stop. You always feel so guilty about everything. Yes, you made mistakes as a kid, but not that many and mostly under great pressure. That’s behind you now. It’s in the past. You changed and you’re doing things
Draco chuckled and shot Scorpius a proud smile when he successfully pronounced darjeeling. “Because you ask so nicely, yes.”
“This!” Draco gestured between them. “That you’re dead set on not liking me and I still want to insult you like the old days but I can’t because you’re annoyingly cute! That’s really fucking stupid, Potter.”
Draco laughed, caught by surprise by the sudden change of topic. “Yeah you did. Though you were nothing compared to Hermione. Sometimes I think I can still feel that hit on my face.”
That was surprising, because of course he knew Harry’s heart was bigger and more forgiving than it should be, but he hadn’t guessed a thing about his colleagues. Draco wouldn’t deny having trust and paranoia issues, but he had been so sure that the fellow Healers had been polite to him and nothing more, had been sure that ‘care’ had nothing to do with it. Apparently, he was wrong.
, that was her name. The only business person who had supported his bill to raise the minimum wage. There had been no need for her to put up that fight - all her employees already had a high salary, and it got her some powerful enemies. Rubbing it in the faces of her rivals that her business was turning a profit without going over the backs of those who worked for her had been reward enough for her though.
As for your request to meet, it depends. My professional voice is not my day to day voice. If you feel in any way offended by what I have written in this letter so far, I would say it is best we take it a bit more slowly. Basically, as Pansy calls it, I let my friends know I like them by (not always very) gently bullying them. That part of me will never change. If you feel up for the challenge, I suggest we could stop by at Luna’s cat cafe Wednesday afternoon. I heard their treacle tart is almost adequate.
“Dad, why is Uncle Harry crying?” Rose tugged on her dad’s sleeve, trying to get his attention. It was difficult, because her dad was very tall and she was not. All the grown ups were very focussed on the pretty pale man in the bed whose name sounded like Dragon. He reminded her of Snow White, only his hair wasn’t black.
“I-,” Draco stammered, clueless about what to say. “I-,”
“Then why are you telling me now?” Harry felt himself begin to panic. This was rather a lot to take in and now he might be hurting Draco? He didn’t want that, but what if not wanting it made Draco feel unwelcome? But how could he feel welcome in the life of someone who wanted to hurt him? A question that made him panic more because Draco had just said that he felt welcome after Harry had caused him pain.
“I think Lily unlocked the secret to a good life at a very early age,” Harry murmured, closing his eyes and throwing his glasses in the general direction of Draco. He refused to catch them, given that he wasn’t Harry’s house elf, but he did smile down at the man who looked seconds away from sleep. Harry was nothing if not extraordinary. “Spending all day sleeping in warm, cozy places or following around a tiny cute idiot.”
Her whole body shook, and she wasn’t even aware anymore of the noises she made or the tears falling from her eyes. Mere seconds after breaking down, two strong arms wrapped around her, grounding her and pressing her against a woman’s chest.
That made Draco chuckle. Maybe Potter wasn’t as confident as he looked. “Sure you didn’t, Potter.”
“It is?” Draco frowned. “I didn’t know you were arguing with her before this afternoon.”
, somehow.
mental illness, Draco. Knows it much better than I do, I’m sure. And even if he didn’t, he wants you to be happy, ey? If it was up to him, he’d wrap you up in a million blankets and keep you safe from all the evils in the world. That’s just how he is.”
I don’t feel pressured to tell you, I want you to know that. But I feel like I can’t really speak freely if I don’t tell you because I’m too aware that giving you certain information will let you know who I am.
He stayed like that for a while. Seconds, months, he did not know. The words kept coming but he couldn’t decipher if they increased or decreased. It probably didn’t matter. He still had nothing to cling to and the one thing he did know was that the Heaviness kept getting bigger. So much so it made him want to give up. He wanted to relax into it and just let go. Maybe he would soon. The Words didn’t scare him anymore, not even the one that said Death. At least Death didn’t sound so Heavy.
Andromeda shot him a smile as he disappeared in the flames. It made him feel quite bad--or perhaps
And suddenly there were tears running down her cheeks as she watched the babies behind the glass. Hugo would grow up without a godfather if Draco died. Hermione would have to go through life with inferior debate partners. Ron would have to start playing chess with his brothers again. And Harry…
Draco huffed. “Look at me, Neville. I’m a mess. A mess who ran to
“Sometimes…” he sighed again, letting his eyes drift to Harry. His eighth year roommate was already on the edge of his seat, ready to defend Draco and yell ‘
had he let himself go like that? In front of Harry’s kids, no less. He must have terrified them. “I’m sorry, Harry. I should have kept a grip on myself.”
Now that we have the legalities out of the way, Potter, you idiot. I have made sure that the therapy side of your last letter landed on the desk of the colleague who will now oversee your correspondence. It did not sound like very light matter to me, which is why, as an I-do-not-know-what-the-fuck-I-am-to-you, I am telling you now that the stupidly old age of twenty nine is way too late to be seeing your first therapist.
Potter doesn’t know how to follow a
After that, the subject was dropped with the aid of a glare from Hermione. She wouldn’t let him ruin their dinner together with talk about Malfoy. Harry didn’t agree with her that talking about Malfoy would ruin their dinner, but he’d given up on that one the last time he obsessed–, nay,
“It’s okay, it’s in the past.” Harry squeezed his shoulders again and planted a kiss on his forehead. “I’m so sorry this is happening again. But you have to be strong for him, hey?”
a privilege, it’s a right. It does
“Maybe it is. But I felt properly pain free for the first time in over a year so I didn’t care. And then you ran because I was healed and you’re an idiot, and it took three years worth of letters before I convinced you to let me back into your life. But I never told you because I don’t want you to stay because of the pain. That would ruin me feeling welcome around you.”
“Hey there, stranger.” Draco looked up. It was Ellis, his first muggle friend and old bar tending colleague. She looked a lot older than last time they had met, despite her pink hair. “You okay?”
“Did you have a good lie-in, Draco?” His mother asked as soon as he sat down. Despite the fact that they hadn’t done anything, the question coloured his cheeks pink. He loved his mother to bits but sometimes he wished she were a little less… good at everything. She’d guided her family through two wars on the wrong side and came out alive and more sane than anyone Draco knew, she was in full control of both her body and emotions, and she was insanely smart. Plus, he was quite sure she was a more powerful legilimens than the Dark Lord had ever been, though she’d never admit to that.
For a moment, Draco hugged him close. “It’s already a million times better than it’s ever been before.”
I am glad to read that you have already discovered the perks of writing things down. It can seem silly, writing down your thoughts, when you feel like you should be able to just ignore them or throw them out. They are
“Because I love you.” Harry replied, as if it were the most simple, natural thing in the world. “Definitely as one of my best friends, maybe at some point as a lover. But whatever happens, Draco, I’ll always care, okay?”
“As long as Scorpius is still in theatre, you’re allowed to be a mess.” Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s temple and began walking him in the direction of what Draco guessed would be Scorpius’ room. “I’ll get you settled and then I’ll grab you something to eat, alright?”
Recorded Draco fell silent for a moment, his heavy breathing the only sound coming from the tape recorder.
Harry chuckled behind him.
And his eyes went wide.
Harry kept rambling on with his nonsense until Draco finally got to a place where he could relax. As soon as that happened, he collapsed against Harry and stayed there with his head on his chest until he had fully caught his breath again. “I’m sorry,” he muttered. “I know I should stop myself when I’m circle-thinking.”
The letter mentioned we can keep this anonymous?
“I love you too, you sap,” Draco replied as James happily continued making retching noises in the background. “Now get going you, otherwise this proud nation will never have a quidditch little league.”
Today had been one of those days, which meant she wouldn’t be able to sleep for another few hours even though she was done with work. However much she would have wanted to drop everything and stay at St. Mungo’s as soon as she heard of Draco’s accident, she simply couldn’t. She had two small kids to look after who didn’t fully understand what was going on, though little Rosie came close. She had a ministry department to run, legal affairs would be a mess without her.
“Of course.” Draco settled properly on Harry’s lap and put his head on his shoulder. He was scared and tired, but somehow he also had too much energy and he felt both stretched thin and too intensely emotional at the same time. Basically, he felt like a mess. He just hoped Harry’s firm back rubs and the passing of time would ease that as he waited for his son to come out of theatre.
