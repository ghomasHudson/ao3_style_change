It is something that overrides this lifetime of his father's shame and disappointment for Draco's display of emotions. It's hard to care in that moment, to even remember when his head is already so full of another lifetime, to have it rise above the intensity of his feelings.
Heading back to his dorm at night, Draco crosses by the sight of Potter and his friends sitting by the fireplace across the lounge, a ruckus of laughter and conversation amongst them.
"I'm not..." Draco stops, tries to breathe but air isn't quite coming to him, and he wants to tell him he's not hoping for anything, or expecting anything of him, but the words get stuck in his throat. He just feels desperate, and like he wants to run, or go back somewhere this never would have had to happen. "What the hell am I supposed to do then? I don't have anything anymore. There is
, and it's only the start of the term. She's easier on Ron now, after hearing of his plans to help George at the shop after graduation, but only marginally so because
"Who," Potter says, smiling wider, kissing him. "I feel good," he says, in between, kissing the corner of his mouth, trails down his cheek and jaw and neck. "I just feel — you make me so — "
In their hotel room that night, Harry had drunk a bit too much at dinner. On his side of the bed, he was leisuring on his stomach, his elbows on the mattress with a camera between his thumbs and forefingers. He was recording Draco as he was folding up the clothes he'd had back from laundry, his own voice behind it asking, "Would you say I'm the best childhood enemy turned involuntary spouse you've ever had?" None of the words quite came out right, running into each other, all slurry.
Draco draws himself up onto the counter, his bare feet hanging inches from the ground. He gestures at the food on the plate. "What are these?"
It ends with Draco kneeling over him, knees on either side of his waist to keep him down. It ends with Harry letting him pin his wrists above him—long fingers circled around them, pressing them into snow—because he is laughing, platinum hair peeking out of his hat in soft messy waves and falling into his crinkling grey eyes, pinked cheeks raised and folded in a dimpled grin.
And somehow, they found themselves discussing and sharing and confessing things, even things they admit they had never told anyone. There was something about Malfoy, something about the way he listened and responded. He didn't look at him with sadness or pity, and he didn't look uncomfortable and uncertain like he was struggling to find the right, magical words to say or the best possible advice. If he had something helpful to offer, comfort or advice, he gave it, and he understood when there wasn't anything that could be said to make it better, opting to let things stay quiet between them instead. Sometimes it just helped to know someone knew.
They had just made their way out of the restaurant. They had split the bill in the end, but Malfoy was oddly insistent at first about paying the whole bill, something about not wanting to go against pureblood traditions and being the one to invite Harry and being old-fashioned and Merlin knew what else that made absolutely no sense to Harry whatsoever. Not a normal hang-out, like Harry had thought, but he supposed stranger things have happened.
Harry hadn't been able to make himself approach him, however. He didn't want to start anything again by pissing him off in any way, which might happen just by Harry making the mistake of trying to speak to him.
Harry swallowed around his heart, beating fast and wild in his throat. "And what does that mean for him?" he asked. His mind was racing, full of puzzling gaps, full of questions. He felt nauseated, and he wasn't entirely sure if it was just the bond, the effort of trying to stay upright through his illness. "Why isn't he here with us? Why isn't he hearing all this
How much of a help could they be, seeing as they'd needed curse breakers' aid to determine anything?
He let Harry step up closer to him, press a kiss to his cheek. Behind him, the flashbulbs went wild, the crowd louder.
Harry closes his eyes. "That was... such an arsehole thing to say. That I threw back into your face everything that helped you survive. I didn't think of it like that. I didn't think much at all. But that's what I did, and Draco I am
Malfoy leaned forward, teeth bared in an angered rictus. "What difference did it make? We're still stuck together for twenty fucking years, only now instead of having four days
There were the beginnings of a slight burn at the corner of Harry's eyes, a line between his brows — something ablaze and raw and frayed at the nerves of his heart and weighing down on his voice. Draco didn't see it.
It's not the way he turns, with a face so lovely and hesitant, a hint of a smile mellow at the corner of his mouth. Harry nearly smiles back at him, pushed out of him like the breath stuck heavy and painful in his throat, stops himself. They tumble in his chest, slow and unsteady — love and longing, all the years of them long and old, burning afresh up to the base of his throat.
"No," Harry says, shaking his head. He scrubs his hands down his face. "Sorry. I don't... I don't know what I was thinking."
," Malfoy spoke over him, loudly. "What do we know about what such failure entails? Perhaps the lifespan becomes doubled instead! Perhaps we both die!"
Then came the presents, most of them without name. He was to guess who brought what. Somebody had bought him a globe with a small him inside of it, which seemed a bit like a joke. This had to be George or Ginny. It turned out to be George, but it turned out that everytime he shook it, somebody else appeared alongside him, until the globe was all full of little Weasleys and Luna and Neville and Hermione. He smiled down at it, soft, putting it aside. He thought, privately, that there was somebody missing in it.
Draco stares at the box full of letters. He has a quill in hand. There's a parchment in front of him. There are things he wants to say, that he can't say to Harry, to Potter.
Draco looks a bit at a loss. "Well, no. I'm very careful with everything I do. Perhaps small explosions, only, but nothing like what you've described..."
Harry swallowed, and laid back down. He followed the rhythm of the rise and fall of Draco's body, not able to fall back asleep.
He doesn't say anything more. She waits for a moment, and then nods, her lips squinched. Then she lets him go six minutes early.
Afterwards, Harry sat there for the longest time in silent shock, overwhelmed by the bizarreness and immense surrealism of it all, as Malfoy laughed and laughed and laughed.
"I think I..." Harry said, staring up at the ceiling, unspeakably exhausted in a way that felt deeper than his body. "I think I pressured him."
Still, Harry crawled out of bed, pulling at his hand as he did. Though bemused and uncomprehending at what he must have in mind, Draco climbed out of bed on his knees, following along to his hands.
Only, when Harry was around Malfoy, it was difficult. He was angry as it was, without clear reason beyond how his life had turned out after everything that had already happened to him, his brain stretched taut, like bubbling acid in his throat. Harry tried his best to keep it down, for the most part, but for a snapped word here, a short, clipped response there, no different from Malfoy's own constantly slipping temperament.
"No. I've worked them out, I think. Not entirely yet, because for most of my life I didn't know it was even possible to — I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, but I think I know one thing for sure."
When he was sat on the bed, closing his eyes, trying to settle the fear shrinking his heart, thinking of all the things he wanted out of desperation — to somehow stop Draco from finding out, hoping he wouldn't find out anything that could ruin him again, wishing he could change something back in time or now or swap places with—
Draco's silver gaze fixated on him, remaining fixated for a moment. Perhaps he was trying to gauge his honesty.
Draco let out a breath of amusement, a slight smile, a little to himself. He shook his head, broke his gaze away from him to look down at his flowers again, his leather-gloved fingers brushing a little over them.
Harry remembered the ball party from last year, that he'd been forced to tag along with. Draco never asked him to come to such functions after that, always just came home earlier.
The frantic beating of his heart begins to slow, settles into calm, climbs up into his throat. His breathing steadies, somewhat, his mind still foggy and hazy. He blinks hard a few times, gritty and heavy, and he's here, now, burning under many gazes and only focused on one,  close and careful as they look up at him. He's here, now, at Hogwarts, eighteen years old and feeling older than decades, and yet younger than he is, all at the same time.
Harry must be quite drunk now, feeling the strange swoop in his stomach. When Ron came to ask him, "Why the long face, mate?" was when he realised he wasn't doing a very good job of hiding his dour mood, seeing Draco laugh at something George had said, brows raised as if he was surprised by it himself. He was thinking of what Ginny had said, had implied.
"Yes," Hermione said. She glanced at Ron, who was looking at her in bewilderment. "I did. I told him I forgave him, as in, I don't hate him, and neither am I angry at him. I've moved on. But I'm still not comfortable around him just yet."
. And then Harry Potamus. Which, admittedly, is the worst of them all, but Potter laughs all the same, the soft and sweet sound buried under the rest of the noise.
Harry remembered, vaguely, the wand being knocked out of Draco's hand. Draco, screaming at Crabbe and Goyle to not kill Harry. The fiendfyre after.
"A good marriage,"  Xavier repeated, after a long second, seeming mildly inconvenienced by being cut off in such a way. "That is what the curse wants, after all."
It's three weeks later that Molly visits him. She doesn't say much at the fireplace. He quickly scrambles up in his surprise, stood by the couch. She comes forward, with a wrinkled smile, hugging him wordlessly, and she eats lunch with him, and updates him about George's shop and Ginny applying for Quidditch teams and helping Ron and Hermione with their apartment and Arthur's job.
That he's thinking about it, trying not to. Having him on him, under him, and about his mouth, grinning above him, dimples folding into his cheeks. The bright gleam of his grey eyes, set alight with exhilaration.
I’m seconds away from pushing him off my lap and hiding in the bedroom, but before I get the chance he says, “Draco, Love, please look at me.” Hearing it again is my breaking point and I clench my eyes shut and let the tears fall as I turn my face toward the ground.
He doesn’t say anything at first. It’s looking as though he is contemplating his next words extremely carefully, as though he’s desperately trying not to fuck up.  My heart melts a little at that because I know I can be a prickly bastard at the best of times. I am wholly unprepared however, for him to smile at me and say with utmost sincerity, “I love you, Draco.”
He runs his hands lower over my shoulders, and trails them down my arms. I submit to the sensations completely closing my eyes and tilting my head back to grant him more access to my neck. I feel his hands everywhere, my arms, my chest, my ankles, my thighs and I can’t suppress the breathy moan that escapes my lips.
“And just what do you plan to do about that Potter?” I retort with a challenging look and a raised eyebrow.
As our laughter dies down, Harry leans forward, drapes his arms over my shoulders and runs one hand through the cropped hair at the nape of my neck. The resulting grin that splits my face is completely involuntary, as I run my hands lightly up his sides and simply relish in the proximity.
“Yea well don’t get used to it, I will not be making it a habit to wear this horrid colour, regardless of what you say about it highlighting my best features.”
It’s almost agonizing waiting for the pan to heat, but eventually Kreacher tells me, “Master can scoop a small amount of butter into the pan now.” I do as I am bid, and I realize belatedly that I’m putting a lot of faith into this old, decrepit, creature. He could be steering me in the complete wrong direction without me knowing. This immediately puts me on edge. It’s not in my Slytherin nature to trust anyone, let alone a house elf I have little experience with, although Harry says that Kreacher is always waxing poetic about me and my “proper wizard” ways. Not as if I have another choice really, here’s hoping he is instructing me properly.
He rolls his eyes but I can tell he’s secretly pleased. “Sure Draco, better get to it then. Pancakes for the birthday boy. I’m waiting!” he says with a smug yet playful grin.
“I, no one has ever called me that before. I never thought…” and fuck my traitorous lacrimal ducts are filling rapidly, and my chest is constricting as I try with all my might to prevent the unbidden tears from giving me away completely. I feel exposed and angry at myself for letting the tears come.
He quickly tucked it under his sweater and out of sight before continuing on with the rest of his presents and so forth the rest of the day,  the pendant giving him some sort of new found confidence that really knocked his parents for a six. Arthur and Molly weren't used to Ron having this library of smart comebacks to everything they said and having opinions on everything and voicing them bravely. Ron had changed.
He’d almost forgotten about Hogwarts, it wasn’t until midway through the final week Draco brought up the fact they have to buy books. Harry owled both Ron and Hermione to see if they could meet up in Diagon Alley but unfortunately, both of them had already bought their book.
“I’ll… “ Draco started, his voice just as strained as before he cleared his throat before continuing which didn’t help in the slightest “I’ll undress to my briefs and then if you’re willing, can help me into the bath.
That is the very first time Harry heard Draco say his first name in a way that wasn’t condescending. Draco had always referred to him as ‘Potter’ and on the rare occasion he’d comment ‘the famous Harry Potter’ but Draco never, ever just called him Harry. That, and the sudden realization of what Draco was hinting at made Harry’s head spin, but regardless Harry wasn’t going to let Draco dominate this conversation. Not now, not ever.
Harry turns to face the other, standing in between his legs. “Hermione is against it still, they’re considering passing laws about house-elves and their rights all because of her. She’s determined.”
“So… That’s your family? “ Draco had finally spoken to Harry. Of course, technically they spoke last night but Draco wasn’t himself, it wasn’t a real conversation.
Draco and the Dursley’s were very similar in many ways; proud, materialistic, ego’s the size of a double-decker bus. He idea of them getting along and grouping up to destroy Harry’s month was all too realistic, and that scared him. On the other hand, the Dursley’s were fake; fake rich, fake powerful, fake influential… In reality, they are a nuclear family whereas, at least to Harry’s knowledge, Draco’s family were all of that and more. Richer than rich, politicians, according to some they live in a castle.
in. The prude little boy who’d bullied you for years at school, you took me in and cared for me when I needed you most. You’ve treated me better than anyone else I've ever met and for what? You could have said no, you didn’t have to run me a bath, undress me, tend to my wounds. You won’t get any reward from doing so... You inspire me, you give me hope- I look at you and think “if someone can be this lovely, maybe the world isn’t that bad after all.” I think, when I was younger, I envied you for that. I knew all too well I couldn't ever be as courageous or caring as you are and I assumed for a long time that you were pretending to be this… this perfect person, but it’s not pretending, which is insane. “
In reality, Harry knows exactly why they divorced but he wouldn’t dare speak of it-  he refuses to think about it. He’d rather put it to petty fights than the truth, even if that may be embarrassing.
Eventually, Harry decided that he was tired and wanted to sleep and despite every ounce of his being wanting to crawl into bed next to Draco he gave the other a kiss goodnight and they part ways.
Harry flies to his feet again in a whole new fit, this one of anger rather than panic. “ How dare they? They have no right to take your fortune. No right! You’re a free man, a good man-  Those bloody Ministry officials- no hearts. None. “
“Well, right after leaving Azkaban I and Astoria got married- I moved in with her. I’m still surprised that she even wanted to be with me after my sentence… I’ve lived with her ever since. “ Despite the lovely things Draco is saying he doesn’t seem too happy, instead sarcastic.
Ron raised an eyebrow, tapping on the arm of the chair, a smirk on his lips. He was thinking hard about what to say, not wanting to say something stupid like the old Ron would have. Slytherin Ron was mature, smart, tactical.  This Ron had the gift of the gab. "I'm not moving, this is my chair. " He kicked the chairs matching ottoman to the side, patting on it, motioning for the other to sit. " There you go. "
While sitting there watching the water rise he tried to wrap his head around the fact Draco Malfoy was sitting in his bedroom right now and how he genuinely felt sorry for him but that's when it hit him. A burning ache pulsated from his scar and Harry quickly clapped the palm of his hand to it, leaning over the side of the tub, his eyes shutting and glasses falling off into the water.
“  I, and many others, put a very, very powerful protection spell on this house before leaving Harry here after his parents past.  There is no place on earth safer for the pair of them. Let’s go inside.”
They stare at one another for a while until Harry finally meets Draco. He's snapped awake from his lovey-dovey stare. He grabs the clothes he was looking for and bolts back to the bathroom to get dressed.
Harry goes on to explain to the pair of them how Dumbledore, McGonagal and some guy named Kingsley Shackelbolt showed up in the middle of the night with Draco in tote. He describes in great detail how Draco was sickly ill and covered in wounds, conveniently leaving out details about how the pair grew to be friends. The story took a long time to explain between having to backtrack to mention details he’d forgotten like how their underage magic ban had been lifted and how the Dursley’s fled in fear and Ron asking question after question.
What the hell is going on? His Harry dreaming? Has he died? How did Draco go from having his guts to cuddling into him in less than two weeks? Before Harry could truly freak out Draco decided to speak, his voice hushed in a calm whisper.
Despite Harry’s wild fantasy not playing out as it did in his head he was grateful nonetheless, giving Draco a kind smile through his flustered posture and messy hair. Draco doesn’t smile back, but his pink neck and cheeks tell Harry all he needs to know.
Neither of the boys had thought that far ahead, both of their eyes widening in sync. Harry helps Draco to sit down on the toilet as they both think the situation through.
The Slytherin house captain was now guiding the first years through the castle and down to the dungeons. Ron stayed at the back of the group at all times, making sure to make mental notes of his surroundings as every corridor looked just like the last and he really doubted he'd ever be able to navigate through this castle properly on his own. He had a stern, almost intimidating look on his face, making anyone who looked at him feel intimidated.
i initially wrote this at the beginning of the pandemic, rushing it because i didn't want the 'hype' around it dying down. it's been a year and a half since this fic was published and if anything the whole situation has only gotten worse. i hope you're all doing well and staying safe, thank you for reading this. take care <3
Hard question. Harry didn’t do much of anything ever when he wasn’t at Hogwarts, despite the stress of having to put up with three of the biggest prudes this side of England for two months it was sort of his off time, given he’d usually spent the rest of the year fighting war criminals and all that.
“First of all, that's bollocks. Second of all, what about me Draco, do I deserve a happily ever after? Because you’re it for me.” He looks up at me then, and I want to punch him because that’s so fucking unfair.
’ But before I can utter a syllable he flips the blob over into the pan with the bubble side down. To my utter astonishment the blob now looks like a pancake! It’s golden brown the exact shade a pancake should be.
For a second he simply gapes at me, and then, laughing, he all but launches himself at me and we tumble backwards onto the ground. As my head hits the ground with a ‘thud,’ I begin to give him a piece of my mind, “Ouc-” but I’m cut off by a pair of lips being pressed forcefully to mine.
He starts mouthing at my jaw, which he fucking knows drives me mental. “So fucking gorgeous,” he murmurs into my neck as he not so subtly grinds his hips into mine. I can’t suppress a shiver and a wrecked moan when our cocks come into contact. He smirks and does it again of course, the wanker. Leave it to Harry fucking Potter to circumvent receiving a birthday blowjob. I muster up every ounce of control I have left, and slide down his body underneath him and begin working him over yet again. This time, I grab onto his thighs in an effort to prevent him from moving, and he appears to capitulate because his arms start to tremble from the effort of maintaining the position.
He seems to understand the direction my thoughts are spiraling because rather than continue angrily, he walks forward and kneels in front of me, and takes my hands in his again.  “You’re under the false impression that I don’t know you Draco.  You think that I don’t see you, but I do. I see a man that despite making poor life choices as an adolescent, he learned from his mistakes and is stronger for it.  I see a man that is loyal and will do anything in his power to protect the people he loves. I see a man that found strength enough to take his worst life experiences and turn it so far around that he’s actually attended muggle university for four years in an effort to distance himself from the stigma forced upon him as a child.”
“Fuck Harry what are you…FUCK!” He’s halfway down and the tightness is literally taking my breath away.  I find myself gasping for air as I manage to grit out, “Harry… Fuck… a little warning… Merlin so tight… I thought you said… you never… Salazar you’re trying to kill me.” Finally he’s seated himself firmly on my lap, my entire cock buried inside him to the hilt, an entirely new sensation because the bloody wanker insists he’s never bottomed before.
I scoff audibly and retort, “Of course you do, if anyone deserves their happily ever after it’s you. But, I can’t give you everything you need Potter. I can’t give you a traditional family, I can’t give you a life without constant worry about your significant other. Any potential life we’d have together would be forever tainted by my past mistakes, and that, I am certain, you truly don‘t deserve.” I trail off pathetically at the end because it pains me to verbalize it.  It’s one thing to keep it hidden deep in the recesses of my mind, but vocalizing it makes it more real somehow.
He hastens to lick up the cream this time, and my thighs tremble as they are bound to the chair and bidden to receive the onslaught.  On the last lick to my left thigh I jerk uncontrollably, causing him to laugh throatily. “Eager are we? Where shall I devote my attention to next hmm?” He asks with a wry grin.
“I’m just getting started, Malfoy.” He says in a deadly serious tone, and without another syllable he leans in and drags his tongue up the length of my cock again, only slower, more torturous. He’s such a fucking tease, always prolonging the moment when he finally takes my into his mouth.
I offer him my most patronizing chuckle, lean in close, wrap my hand around his cock, and kiss him open mouthed and filthy. I then start to stroke him gently as I whisper into his ear, “It’ll be me who fucks you into the mattress this morning.” Without pause, I lean back, cast a wordless, wandless, lubrication charm, align his cock to my entrance, and bear down in one slick slide until my arse is settled right against his groin.
I feel trembling hands gently grip the sides of my face and tilt my head upward to look at him, but I stubbornly keep my eyes closed. I don’t want to see pity there, and I sure as shite don’t want to see any judgement for my ill advised moment of vulnerability. I try to turn my head to the side to escape the scrutiny I know he’s bestowing upon me, but he prevents it. “Draco, it’s okay just please open your eyes hmm?”
They spent that entire morning in bed, kissing after a breath refreshing charm. Then they merely laid together, pressed close, either in silence or speaking in murmurs in the little breadth between them, and then kissing again, smiling into it, as much as they wanted. Everything in his mind went calm whenever Draco touched him, and Harry didn't know anymore how much of it was the bond, how much wasn't. How much of it was just Draco now.
"I've missed you so much," Harry murmurs. He runs a thumb over Draco's cheekbone. "I wish I'd... I wish I never made you leave."
The look on Draco's face, the flutter of a blink in his eyes from the startlement, before they crinkled slightly from a flicker of a soft smile quirking at his lips, made Harry smile too, thumbing the corner of his mouth.
There was a tingle in Harry's throat. He swallowed it down. He didn't want to say it, and thinking about it made his breaths climb up his throat, heavy and painful. It made his face go numb, and his hand trembled, tightening around Draco's shirt, clutching him just a bit closer.
He faced ahead, after a stilled moment, towards life and time and their endless, unstopping currents. He couldn't see anything. All the world was blurred.
There's a sketch of a ferret, a ghastly one, but it's upturned whiskery-nose and flat mouth is somewhat evident, and so is its slicked back hair, looking like a wig plopped on top of its head.
From the other room, he could hear Emelie's shriek of laughter, the vague sound of Petunia's voice. Olivia was carrying her across the corridors, towards the loo to get Emelie's hands washed, laughing too.
one of my favourites, but I only ever come here on the most special occasions. The last time must have been about, what, four years ago?" That explained why he wasn't as easily recognized.
"People are saying very unkind things about you," Lovegood points out, stroking a Thestral's fur. Draco has been able to see them since Fifth Year, but now many others at Hogwarts can as well, from the way several of the students are staring right at the creatures. They are mesmerizing and unsettling in equal measures to look at, gaunt and mystical.
and Harry would kiss him on the cheek, about to stand up straight, until Draco would stir and open his eyes and see him, saying his name and mumbling a sleepy greeting as he tried to sit upright. Harry would kiss him softly, a hand curled beside his head, murmuring a
"Malfoy. Hey." Potter. Always him. Always showing up. The farther Draco tries to run from him, the closer he comes crashing. His bleary gaze focuses clearer on his tired face. "It's alright. You're alright. You're safe."
The morning after his odd and inadvertent encounter with Draco, he'd woken up alone and remembered, in a fit of mortification, that he'd fallen asleep right beside him on the Quidditch Pitch. For two days after, Harry adamantly doesn't open the Marauder's Map to look for Draco again. Now he does need to open the map for other things, such as to search for Ron and Hermione, or to see what Ginny's up to, so sometimes his eye inevitably slips and catches sight of the
he repeated in thought, looking at Draco quietly, watching him turn his head away, and Harry's gaze, falling to his mouth,
"It was a pathetic attempt at a chance to see you again," Draco said quietly. "I thought I was dying, and I just wanted to see you one last time."
Potter waits for him to say something only for a few seconds. There's nothing. With that, he walks past him towards the exit, Draco left behind to stare at nothing, lips parting around a protest that he didn't have the voice for.
The way he speaks with an alive sort of interest and mild awe… it sweetens him, and Harry finds himself wanting to see him so much that his heart hurts. But he doesn't ask to or get out of bed and go knocking at his door. He stays in bed and teeters on the edge of slumber, listening to his voice. He has a nice voice, Harry vaguely thinks.
The next morning, Longbottom isn't there in the room with them, fortunately, and everybody is passed out all through the common rooms by the time they awake at the break of dawn, so it isn't difficult for Potter to sneak out back into his own room, Draco pushing him out through the door after he's kissed Draco on the cheek instead of mouth because they both have terrible breath as of now. Though Draco privately thinks he wouldn't have minded much if he did, because he's kissed his bad breath mouth enough times in the Dreams to be used to it.
Draco didn't understand this before. He understands it now. He is just one person, hardly enough to fill a lifelong void. He loves Potter like he might die without him, but Potter has more than enough to live without him.
"I wasn't trying to keep my magic," Harry said, touching his hairline, wishing he could kiss him again. "I was trying to keep you."
Harry shakes the curtains out of the way, making a clear rustling noise. He glances behind him at Teddy, a broad grin playing on his lips. Teddy is enveloped in Ginny's arms, his hair as ginger-red as hers, pudgy hands pushed up into his eyes. Ginny's grinning as well, her chin to the side of his hair, as she watches Teddy erupt into belly-laughter.
Ron nods, claps a heavy hand down on his shoulder, mouth squinching into a sort of smile. He stands up, making for the door.
Draco has both his arms atop one another, leaning on the railing. "I think Slytherin's beating you Gryffindor wankers just fine without me."
It wasn't enough. In the end, Draco did collapse. He'd excused himself and stumbled over to the staircase, a hand on his head, the other on the decorative dome of the stair railing. Harry had followed him right at his heels, caught him by the inside of his knees and his back and jostled him up into his arms before he could fall. All the hubbub slowed, the room falling silent. Harry met Narcissa's eyes in the distance, but she didn't move from where she stood, only swallowed, frowning, a stressed line of fear between her brows. Even so, she let him take care of it.
Lovegood and Longbottom get onto the Thestral carriages. Draco stares after him,  unmoving for an infinite moment, his stomach tight and his heart erratic, pushed out of place within his skin. He vaguely hears Lovegood, calling for him to come onto the carriage with her and Longbottom.
"Emelie, you know," Dudley said. He swallowed, hard, crossed his arms over his chest uneasily. "She's magic too. Just like… just like you."
Draco rolled off the bed quickly before Harry could get him, skirting around the bed as Harry tried to corner him. It resulted in a whole chase around the room, Harry making sure he was always in the way of the door. They were both laughing stupidly like children half-way through it, and when Draco tried to escape again by climbing onto the bed, Harry caught him from behind, the two of them tussling as Harry tried to get at the camera and Draco held it high and far out of his reach, one hand gripping Harry's arm around his waist, still caught in the uncontrollable fit of his gleeful mischief.
It's like ice-cold water, closing over Harry's head. He can't breathe, lead in his throat, a weight on his lungs.
" Narcissa is mumbling, crying. Draco shushes her, burying his nose into her shoulder. She swallows hard, composing herself. She touches his upper back, drawing back from him. "Draco, I
Harry pulled him close, kissed the space between his eyes. "I was also afraid of telling you, because I thought… if you didn't feel that way for me too, it would be a burden for you. You know? Or just make everything so strange. I mean… every time we would have to be close, you would think, 'he's in love with me' and feel weird."
He's been thinking about kissing him, holding his hand. Holding him by the waist. Touching him somewhere warm and real. He's been noticing the pin-dots at the corners of his mouth when he was exasperated or smiling or smirking, the sharp line of his pale throat. His hair. His grey eyes. How nice his voice sounds on the coin.
He is standing there with his hands in his pockets, shy as a schoolboy, head slightly low. But his face is something bare and strange, looking at him. His lips twitch, a helpless and breathy sort of flick, that stops before it can become anything like a smile.
. He stopped himself, mortified and suddenly feeling hot and uncomfortable again. He rubbed the back of his neck. Malfoy's head had snapped up to him at that, one eyebrow cocked in surprise and… something else, that unfathomable look again like when he was watching Harry at the concert. Harry hoped desperately that he didn't hear the unspoken, that he didn't know just what was about to come out of his mouth right then.
Harry huffs. “Yeah, pretty good actually. Just going to miss him when he goes back after the hols.” It’s been two weeks since Draco’s come back. There's one more until Christmas now, and then he leaves after New Years. Then, it will be five months after when Draco will move to London, finally completing his two-year potions mastery course. He plans on applying to Hogwarts as a Potions professor.
He did seem to energise himself after that, talking and joking and dancing with everybody in the room, as if adamant about not ruining the party. But Harry could still feel that something wasn't quite right. His own mood had gone strange as well, and always now, there was that fear and desperation shrivelling up his heart. Always.
Draco stares at her. "I don't know," he croaks. "I don't know how to..." Even now, after having talked about it to Aileen, and Luna, and—he doesn't know how to speak of it to somebody new. Somebody so outside of it. There is a part of him that doesn't want to ruin this space of normalcy, that there is somebody who knows him and does not know that. But there is another part of him that is too tired of keeping it away.
And they couldn't. Half of the things, they had to save for the next day, because Draco would get so exhausted, even as he would try to push himself through it, or they'd take too long in some places that most of their time and energy would be gone by the end. It seemed Draco was just desperate to experience everything as much as he could, but at the same time, he didn't want to spend too much time not spending it with his mother, with Teddy and Andromeda and Luna.
It hurt, seeing him like that, knowing it was his own fault. It hurt in a way it never had in all their years together, to have him so angry at him, to know that Harry deserved it. But it hardly mattered how it hurt, and how the curse left him cold and aching and uncomfortable these days, when he looked at Draco.
The only consequence Malfoy got was confiscation of most of their family wealth and to return to Hogwarts as a part of his agreement. His mother was placed on House Arrest under supervision of Aurors.
Harry thought of him, eighteen years old and curled up and lonely against the side of a couch. The way he'd straightened upon seeing him, a flush in his cheeks, eyes red-rimmed.
"Of course," Draco says with a nostalgic little smile, arm around the back of his neck, forehead to his. A little while after, he appears to remember something, and wastes no time telling of the time Peeves found Harry seemingly alone on the Astronomy Tower, after he threw the Invisibility Cloak over Draco, and he had to pretend he was just dancing with himself to the wireless in the dead of night. Peeves had cackled and made a mockery and a song out of his 'sad state of affairs'. Draco laughed madly at it then, drawing the cloak off himself after and folding over with the force of it, and he's laughing at it now, as he's telling it. Harry shakes his head at him, smiling anyhow.
"Nope. So, tell me, Harry, the rest of the view in those places was probably just background, wasn't it? Or, should I say,
"Er, right. Yeah." Harry lifted his hand, somewhat bemused. It hovered for a second. Two. Then, hesitantly, he slipped it over Malfoy's. He was cold. "Goodbye, Malfoy."
He ended up taking Harry's drink out of his hands, putting his own aside with it on the table. Then, Draco shifted over a leg on the other side of his thighs, putting his fingers at the waistband of Harry's jeans as he asked a quiet, "Yes?"
"Are you considering?" Madam Aileen questions. "There are several services I can recommend for you to look into, though you may require the means to travel to the aforementioned countries."
Harry moved again only when he was sure, only when he didn't think it would hurt him, lifted Draco in his arms and carried him back to their bed.
"Oh, I've always wanted to go there!" Hermione said, a deeply wistful expression of her face as she glanced up at Draco, back down at the camera. "It's so beautiful."
He breaks it, a moment after, strokes Harry's curls back from his temple and whispers, "Take me to bed."
There is a memory trying to make its way into his mind, and he's been trying not to let it in, but now Potter isn't here and it slips through the worn and cracked barricade holding it back. And it grows, from a faded, muffled thing into a bright and clear memory that never happened. Harry, smiling, absently pulling Draco's coat closer around his shoulders. Raising himself on the ends of his trainers to kiss him. Potter, sitting there across the booth from him in it, arms atop the table as he talked, grinned, laughed.
His home is not a tainted Manor where his entire childhood was spent. His home is not a dusty, ancient school he grew up in, brought ruin into. His home is not a beautiful green-eyed boy who once danced under the stars with him and laughed with him and brought him lunch, held him while he fell asleep. Who smiled at him soft and kissed him hard, told him he was in love with him. Who could not see enough in him to choose him.
"I see," Malfoy said, finally, softly. He put his drink away, lips flicking to taste the drink on them, and then he rose from his seat. "Well then, that is that. I shall see you out."
"We're not going to die, Malfoy, come on," Harry said, in a desperate scoff. He ran a hand down his face, spread it out, the other palm on his hip. "Maybe…
"But you are awake." Madam Aileen is eying him carefully. Her lips flicker, not quite a smile, but something like it. "So who did you love there?"
"Do you," Harry murmured, thinking he shouldn't ask at all, and somehow still went on to, his mind a little too muddled and his inhibitions a little too out of touch with his actions. His voice came slightly slow, slurry, weighted. "Do you wish you could have been with somebody else? Somebody you wanted."
"But that is mostly for the sake of my mother. When I'm—" Malfoy halted, suddenly, his jaw working slightly. Harry finally looked up at him. "I would only like for people to be kinder to her if I'm ever not present, that is all." His head lifted, turning, meeting Harry's eyes again. "In return for your favours, I'm willing to offer whatever you ask of me. Whatever."
and then it was a long-winded explanation of what his internal state felt like, and nothing was really making much sense anymore.
Malfoy raised his brows, a curl at his mouth, as he lifted his head at him. "For Merlin's sake, Potter, how hard is it really to pour
It was a while after that Harry felt the tentative fingers over the back of his hand, in his lap. It was easy now, to turn his own palm up, let them slide into the spaces of his own. To hold it back, tightly, and hold it still even as it jittered up his arm. Neither of them moved, or spoke for a time.
After Potions, Malfoy hadn't shown up for the rest of the classes yesterday and he didn't show up for any of the classes the next day either. It was nearly two hours before lunch that the
"I like being outside as well," Luna says, then, with a smile, perhaps having noticed his wandering eyes around the surroundings. The fallen autumn leaves. The sway of the high branches on trees. The winds. "I'd missed it very much there."
"Nothing, just — that stunt you pulled in the match to get the snitch." Ron was smiling a little, a small huff, remembering it. "She was proud of you."
He halted at the door, and his eyes found Draco first, examining him with a frantic mind, roving over his body language.
Following this visit, Harry was much too careful about him. He verbally pushed Draco into bed all the time, did not let him do much of anything to do with chores, brought their meals up to bed and ate with him there. They seemed to spend much of the time in bed, either sleeping or just lying together, or talking about everything and nothing, or sometimes Draco would play his violins for a bit, or watch Harry paint.
Harry was confused, had lifted his head just as the couch dipped on either side of his thighs, one following the other. Malfoy had crossed the room, clambered over him, straddling him. His hands were on the cushions, over Harry's shoulders, weight lifted on his own legs. Not touching, but close enough to feel the slight pull between them, as if something else that wasn't them liked this proximity and heat. Harry blinked, vision focusing onto Malfoy's face, unable to speak.
It came when they'd been having dinner, with only the sound of clinks of fork and spoons against the plate. Malfoy asked, casual and soft,  "Was it worth it, Potter?"
Draco clears his throat, his body stiff but for his eyes darting to him and then away again, staring at nothing in the distance. "Wonderful."
The whole restaurant exploded into cheers and wolf-whistles. The waiters and waitresses present were grinning too, clapping loudly along with the rest of them.
Then he stutters a bit forward, stops there with the very small part of his lips near Harry's, closing them in order to swallow hard again. He closes his eyes too, tight and hard with a firm set of his jaw, as if there's something he's trying to push back within himself. He looks brittle and pained, for a reason Harry can only half-fathom, thinking of two boys in a robe shop seven years ago.
"I know of the way you look at me sometimes. The page you keep hidden in your locked drawer. And now, all these nightmares you're having."
Draco took over all the further conversations to Harry's relief. He was asking all the questions for Naborowski, letting him speak about himself, adding a bit of general points here and there or personal opinions about the topic at hand.
Harry doesn't think much beyond how much he wants to hold him, an urge so strong it propels him forward into Draco's space, to step up to him and wrap his arms around his shoulders, raised slightly on his bare toes.
Draco wandlessly locks the door after, when they're too tired for any more. That's something Harry's been liking very much for a long while as well, whenever he sees him using his wandless magic. He watches him draw the curtains like that too, thinking of how he hadn't realised before that his enjoyment for wandless magic extended exclusively for Draco.
And it was in the face of this terror, and the wind so cold and raw on his nerves and his skin and in his lungs, the feel of his own pounding heart, that Harry felt wondrously, horribly alive—here where they sat watching over a world that looked bright and sharp and overwhelmingly vast, like all the colours of a painting have deepened themselves to look more vivid to him. And the two of them, so small.
Narcissa eyed him, and then said, "I see." She put her cup down. "He seems tired these days. And fairly troubled as well. I only wondered, seeing as you live together, if you might have known something about it."
He was numb and off-kilter all through the dinner,  slipped in and out of the conversations at the table and hardly spoke, as if his mind had detached and he had retreated somewhere deeper within it and now he was watching himself in the middle of everything else. He was numb and off-kilter through finding himself standing at the door, shaking Emelie's little hand, and Olivia's, and Dudley's, who was asking him if he needed a drive, and Harry was telling him he didn't need a drive, and Dudley was asking him if he was sure, and Harry was sure, yes. Dudley was handing him his number,
He got into contact with Healer Francine days later, made an appointment. He couldn't hear much of what she said where Malfoy was sat on the hospital bed, beyond
It comes as a jolt to him. Draco's face falls, unable to gather it back up. Potter looks away from it.
"There's a lot on your mind today, isn't there?" Luna says, her head tilted. "I can see a lot of Wrackspurts around your head."
Hell do we even have homework for Christmas hols?" Ron is asking, and then Hermione is explaining to him the merits of it, with their NEWTs coming up and how everybody will slack if there isn't any pressure—
"So…" Harry started, when he was done with waiting for Malfoy to speak up, because he certainly didn't look like he was going to any time soon. "What are we doing here, really, Malfoy?"
Conversation was loud and comfortable, full of stories that either took place in rapt silence, or in a chaos, adding details over each other, one taking over to tell their perspective, laughter rising high in the middle, at the end. Harry was throwing out his own ridiculous remarks every now and then into the collective, Ron having snorted so loud at one of them that he choked on his drink.
Sleep comes to claim Draco in its tide, a quiet, distant memory playing its song well into his dreams, a hand sliding over his own in a bright daylight, a hand warm on the middle of his back, the two of them leading his feet into the spin of a dance.
Draco hums. There's a rustling sound, like he's shifting around, and it comes through in his voice, "Honestly, you know, I'd say I'm still getting used to Weasley."
, he'd been about to say. He'd felt angry, throbbing hot and dull through his veins. But he'd lifted his head and taken one look at her, had looked upon her thinness and frailty and all the hard months on her, how she contrasted with the way he remembered her in his Dreams, and had found himself unable to express it, but for an aversion of his cold gaze, a tightening of his jaw, a quiet snarl.
Overhead, the stars scatter across the sky, Draco already half-asleep in the cocoon of his heat and solidity and comfort, to the sound of his name in Harry's voice, the reverberating of it in his chest under the curl of Draco's fingers. All his good and joy and comfort. Forgetting, in the minute just before he falls over the edge, where exactly he is.
It's a blur, the seconds and steps that follow. Harry doesn't entirely remember the way it happened, just that he is going to his knees in front of him, one after the other to the floor—just that Harry's hands are around his face, so close to his own that the very tips of their noses are brushing.
All can do is stare up at the ceiling, blurry-eyed. Talking about him, even if they don't say his name, stings all his sensitive, chaffed nerves, grief sinking heavy as a boulder on his sternum.
He vividly notices Draco leaning his face towards his own, the sound of his laugh near Harry's jaw. Harry's head is lowered between his own shoulders, a broad grin pulling at his cheeks, and he can still feel the phantom of Draco's body against his side, from when they squeezed together under the cloak.
Before the game starts, Potter's gaze roves over the crowd of audience on the sidelines. Seeing as his girlfriend is floating not a few feet away from him, he is not entirely sure who or what he's looking for until Potter's gaze lands on him and stops. He straightens a little further on his broom, throwing him a wave and a grin.
He feels strange, a bit off-kilter, having Potter so close and next to him, even despite the distance. He feels it a bit harder to breathe, but now for an entirely different reason. "I'm well-aware."
But whatever expression Harry has on his face, undoubtedly a reflection of the whirlwind of his guilt and shame, seems to smoothen some of the hardness of Draco's face. His lips press together again, those pin-dot again that Harry's been noticing too often these past few months. He breathes a sigh, close-mouthed through his nose, glancing away in a private sort of gesture. Almost as if caving to something within himself.
Draco outlines the dragon's head in the sky. He and Luna are something like friends now, as they spend time together every few days, but suddenly he isn't so sure they should be. "I didn't do anything to her."
"Hey," Potter's whispering, drawing his face over his own with both hands, kissing his lips, their foreheads and noses together.  Again, in a whisper, both hands pushing Draco's hair back tenderly behind his ears, "Hey."
"I don't think…" Harry says, hoarse. He looks down at his hands. "Gin, I don't think we should be together anymore."
Harry walked to the closest Apparition point, turned into every crack of it until he was outside of Grimmauld Place, walking up the porch and to the door.
"Um. No. I don't think so… I'll probably just hang out with Ron and 'Mione like always." Harry squinted. "Why—"
Draco returned, taking his place beside him, and they stared into the fire silently for a long time after that. Harry glanced over at him, again. He was sitting back, one hand loose between his lap, drinking slowly from his crystal tumbler, and Harry thought, muddled, that Draco did look very nice when he was playing the violins. Thought, muddled, of leaning forward, of catching his mouth, of kissing him all the way down, until his back was flat on the settee. Thought, muddled, of their very first night here, and how lovely and tempting he always looked, then and now.
"Is it because of me?" Draco says. His throat convulses, and that is the only sign of his emotions, staring ahead at the open expanse of foliage and the starry sky. "That you're afraid?"
"Doesn't mean you have to put in any more effort into things you don't want to do, Harry," Ron said. "You know what Dad always says. Life's already too hard without you doing things that make you unhappy, and mate, I think you've done enough of that to last you a lifetime."
"Give or take," Bill said, and then sighed, shook his head. He looked haggard. "But just because the lifespan of the curse is twenty years doesn't mean it
"Nothing," Harry said, quietly, turning it around his finger. It was small, a simple band of metal around the knuckle of his finger. A noose on his neck, keeping his life at a halt. "It's just an accessory."
But perhaps he's always been a bit hopelessly dim in matters concerning Harry Potter. And perhaps he's always been the sort of person to take scraps over nothing. Just as he had with his father. Just as he had with Potter a long time ago, begging him in his mind to
, he said. He'd almost forgotten the ring he bought for Draco on their coffee table until Olivia suddenly remembered, went inside and got it for him.
"Not really, no." Harry throws him a remorseful glance. "Sorry, mate. I know we've been planning it since like, Second Year, but I just…
Narcissa is still as kind and fond of him as she was before, greeting him with an embrace and a kiss to his cheek, so Harry doesn't know if she's aware of what happened between him and Draco. She sits him down for tea.
"Oh. It's very recent," Luna waves off, and does not take his bait for diverting the topic. Draco isn't sure if this is deliberate or not. "So who was it?"
"How about you consider what this looks like, Narcissa?" Molly snapped. "For Harry to have come back from a visit that
"I'm getting really fucking sick and tired of you, you know that!" Harry shouted after him, infuriated and petty, wanting the last word.
For a moment, Harry didn't know if this was something he should tell him, because maybe this would bring them right back to what Xavier had been trying to avoid, and maybe Draco could still be saved. Maybe they could both do better this time, and reverse it all back.
Narcissa frames his face, pulls it down to kiss his temple, rests her forehead against his. "I can't bear any more of this fear of losing you," she whispers. "I'm tired of it."
Harry takes his wand out and casts another warming charm, rubbing his hands together to wring out its heat.
Draco kissed him, pressed close to him, all hot and tender. Their legs were tangled together, comfortably. "I'm still not one for pet names," he said, with a lazy smirk and a half-grin. "But you make it sound good."
"But there are still things that I did, that I think about now, and I realise how much they must have hurt you. And I didn't do right by you at all. Not telling Ginny and everybody. Not choosing us, you."
Harry was watching him with a small quirk at one corner of his lips, roving over his face. Draco was so focused on fixing him up that he didn't notice it, and he let himself almost forget, for this moment, how he had ruined him and how angry Draco was for it.
When Harry looks up at him again, Draco has turned back to the night. He's smiling slightly, the same serene thing, just wider, mellowing around his eyes. Harry can't stop looking at him, at the pull of his mouth.
That time Harry had found him curled alone against the side of the couch in the dead of night, his eyes red-rimmed and his expression hollow. He'd straightened slightly upon seeing him, a flush blooming up his neck to his jaw. Harry hadn't known what to do, faint visions of a bathroom stall full of water and blood slipping unbiddenly into his mind's eye, and so he'd turned around and walked away.
Harry frowned, puzzled. He was trying to say something, but his tongue was too heavy, difficult to work with.
if you—" He stopped, breathed, feeling agitated and antsy. He then moved closer to him. "Come on, Malfoy."
"Salazar, why did you take this?" Draco asked, wide-eyed, taking the camera from him and eyeing it closely. Harry did not see what he was so flustered about.
The feeling of Draco pressing his lips to Harry’s changes that entirely, the air is sucked out of him by a giant spiritual vacuum and then pumped into him again as if he’s being inflated like a giant flesh balloon. He kisses back, of course, making a point of doing so after the situation that had gone down the morning earlier- he doesn’t want Draco to feel rejected like that ever again.
Harry decided to speak again,  “Where do you live now?” He asked, crossing his legs over one another, hands in his lap. Harry desperately wants to make things work between them as the idea of spending the next two weeks with Draco in a hostile environment makes his blood run cold.
take that from you.” Vernon also stands, the table being pushed by a thrust from his fat gut, slamming into both Draco and Harry, Harry watches Draco flinch from the corner of his eye, appearing scared of the hideous man that stood before him for a moment. That moment was short, but it filled Harry with a rage he’d only felt a small few times before, that rage being taken out by a green blast from his wand that landed not on Vernon, Dudley or Petunia but instead the television which exploded on impact.
Harry, despite the situation at hand, was thrilled to hear he’d be allowed to use magic outside of Hogwarts. All those dreams he’d had of hexing Dudley into a swarm of flies were becoming a reality right before his eyes.
waves, which is honestly a lot better than the effort he’d put in back at school. Draco spent five whole years in Azkaban and it seemed to barely affect him- he was less hostile, and certainly didn’t follow the dark lord but he’s still Draco. Much like how Sirius was still Sirius- Black blood must be immune dementors or something.
Harry enjoyed himself greatly for the upcoming week, the independence that came with being able to do whatever he wants whenever he wants felt like a dream come true. He and Draco caught a bus to London and found themselves in Diagon alley, both of the boys taking money out of their vaults to spend on things like food.
“Okay.” Is all Harry could say, he felt an unsettling wave of emotions flood his body, sprouting inside him like the root of a tree. He felt bad, horribly bad,  for every single thing he’d ever said to Draco previous to this very moment despite the fact Draco gave just as good as he got, if not worse.
They continue walking to the bookstore, grabbing everything they need. Draco insisted on paying for Harry’s books and eventually Harry had caved in. Harry had discovered during their time together that Draco’s father had an account at every single store in Diagon Alley which met they’re spending Lucius’ money rather than Draco’s. Nonetheless, in retaliation to being spoilt like this Harry demanded he pays for their lunch.
in his life. Without hesitation he put it on, placing it over his own head slowly and then getting up to look at himself in the mirror. He loved it.
“Potter! Please,  save your breath. There’s nothing to be done, I've tried it all. The only reason they couldn’t take the house is that the bloody queen wouldn’t lt them- the land was given to our family by the first king so it wasn’t the Ministries to take. The only way I can get anything from the property is if I allow the Ministry to sell it, they’ll give me the money they make from it but I… I don’t want to do that.” Draco ran his hands over his thighs, squeezing them. Anyone can tell that the subject is a touchy one, Draco looks far more miserable than usual.
Draco hummed, flashing Gregory and Ron a glare, sitting next to the other rather obediently. Ron was not expecting Draco to actually do as he said but he wasn't complaining, this fueled his ego and superiority complex even more.
Upon exiting the bathroom, fully dressed and ready for breakfast he found that Draco was nowhere to be seen. Instantly Harry’s stomach did a backflip, and he paused in horror. Had Draco fled? Was this all a sick plot to discover some information for the Dark Lord? A thought struck Harry that made him feel even worse if it were possible; Has Draco attacked his aunt and uncle? Dudley? Sure, Harry hated them with a burning, undeniable rage for the way they’d lied to him and tortured him for years but they still were his family.
Harry is searching for a smart comeback, an innuendo or flirtatious remark to reply to  Draco with but nothing comes to mind, his head feels empty, filled with nothing but hair and butterflies
“When I left Azkaban I went straight to the Ministry to ask for my inheritance- I was informed all of our savings and artefacts had been claimed and the only thing that was left was The Manor but it was serious investigation- searching it for dark magic. It’s been 20 years and i still can’t have it back. I  only hope they’ll let Scorpius inherit.”
The rest of the night passed quickly, Ron sat and listened to the banter, everyone sitting around his grand chair. He felt superior. He felt at home.
The last part makes sense, he’d never really thought about Draco’s family tree in that way before, though, so it still mildly shocked him. Knowing that being gay was, for the most part, accepted in the wizarding world was a relief. Harry hadn’t the time to think about his sexuality, but he knows where his attraction lies.
"I don't." Her lips grow into a smile, something to mollify him. "But gradually easing into the things I would need to know can create a level of comfort. You don't have to answer anything you don't want to. Is it romantic?" Draco affirms. "Is she here? At Hogwarts?"
Draco might like to tell Luna, at some point, because he trusts her, but there is still some part of him that is just waiting for this to fall apart, as if this might be a dream after all. Maybe he just wakes up again. Maybe Potter decides it's not quite working, and then what will he do, because he's loved him too long and too much and Potter has only just started to feel anything like this for him. And should he decide he doesn't want Draco, he won't feel as much for it, but Draco might just feel like he shouldn't have woken up from those dreams.
and it never will be because nothing will ever be as perfect as his dreams, and that is a fact of this life that will always weigh on his joy.
"Was it because…" Harry said, faltering. He didn't want to be presumptuous, but he'd thought about it a bit, how Draco hadn't seemed entirely concerned by the purpose he invited him for. How he'd called him back, held his hand out for him, said,
Just a summary of what went wrong with the bond, in case somebody didn't understand (I know it's all very weird and complicated, and even worse and vague that it's just one POV):
"Your hair would never cooperate enough for a mullet," Draco said, with a wave of his hand, still seeming amused. "Come now, we have to see the Taiwan Pavilion."
Hermione stands to her feet, her face thunderous with fury. She absorbs it quickly on a napkin and then slams her hands down on the table, rattling dishes and plates and spooking everybody at the Gryffindor table. Ginny shouts at the Great Hall to shut up, so that Hermione can rip into the anonymous perpetrator in the utter silence that has taken place.
Harry stroked his hair, wanting to get him to look at him. "Sometimes bad things just happen, even to good people."
When Draco wakes up, once again, somewhere in the dark of the night and under the dim starlights of the constellations spell that he doesn't remember casting for a second time, there is nobody at the floor of his bedside.
Harry can tell Draco has tried his best to put it in simple words for the children, but he still uses words that he forgets to explain, and kids have to ask the meaning of them. He drags the explanations too long, trying very hard to make the children who asked understand what he meant to say, but Harry can also see when they lose focus, their eyes going distant.
Draco had been working on this for almost two years now. He'd told Harry everything about it, all the mechanics, as much as Harry could understand of the way he made it, how it would let him feel intensely his own magical core and the curse operating on it. How it would tell him what had happened to him. He'd told Harry of why he was certain that the alteration had only gone wrong for him, not Harry — the simple fact that Harry did not at all seem affected similarly by the curse in the months before they got together, when Harry had been unspeakably desperate and aching for him just as much, the curse like a clouded wall between them. Draco was… he was absolutely fucking brilliant.
"I thought I was having it under control now," Harry said, sighing. He had stopped seeing her for the last month. Quieter, he said, "I suppose not."
Draco must have already come to a few of these places, because he knew a lot about them, and told Harry all about them too. The camera was often kept on, under the pretense of recording videos of the ancient architecture, or the stunning views from a high rooftop, the top of a tower, the edge near a canal with a few boats sailing on the water. He wondered if Draco could tell that it was on him too a lot of the time. Always trying to catch a laugh or a smile of his.
" His voice was beginning to rise as well. a near-shout, a raw and rough edge to it. "we can't have a full day to ourselves without having to
Malfoy had shared much of himself tonight, without sharing any vulnerability or emotion in any true way. He somehow had a way with that, with talking about dark things like he was just telling Harry about the upcoming weather, things about Voldemort living in his home and the constant threat of death looming over him and his family and being tortured by his aunt and Death-Eaters that treated the Malfoys like scum in his own home and Dumbledore and his father dying in Azkaban without them ever resolving their issues, without Malfoy getting to say goodbye.
Harry watches Teddy, cooing and babbling until he's droopy-eyed. He nods, laughs and responds every now and then, kisses his curls. He thinks of Remus and Tonks.
Harry shrugged. They were sitting very close, shoulders brushing. He could feel his warmth, the warmth of the bond pulling back. "Me? No." He thought briefly of Elias. "Not before this anyway."
Harry spent the entire day on edge as always, waiting for the contented hum to whirr away into the same old unease. He waited for people to come in while reading, half-distracted by distorted images of last night, trying to ignore every thought of it. Eventually he almost forgot about being on edge, waiting for the curse to act up, and only fully realized at the end of the day that the tangle of magic at his core was still quiet, still content.
He seems to have no struggle against the cold from the looks of it, but he is also much too thin, after his body having gone through the toll it did, months ago.
"Well, regardless, I do." She pauses in hesitation, then, and then inhales a controlled breath. "Draco, the Headmistress of Hogwarts' response came today. She says you're welcome to return, bearing a few conditions."
Draco's eyes slip to a close, slow, the jut of his throat convulsing. He isn't coming any closer, but he isn't moving away. "I think you're drunk," he murmurs, a warm breath against Harry's lips.
"You're not nearly as unattractive as you think, Potter," Malfoy drawled, his voice somewhat raspy.  "And I reckon the two of us have faced much worse than the idea of us snogging."
Harry frowned, bemused. "No. I don't think you're…"  He thought of some sleepless nights in a tent, a forest, watching the rise and fall of Ron and Hermione's chests when he couldn't stave off the fear, wishing he could have everybody he loved in front of his eyes again. "I understand."
Harry stepped closer. Malfoy followed his movement with his eyes, very still. "I'd rather risk it than live twenty years of a life that I don't want, because the only other option we have is to live in this
" His eyes twitched down, over the rumpled state of him, and then with a flick, back up to Harry's face. "cavortings."
Draco's head lifts at that, looking at him. His throat bobs. "That was to symbolise to myself that I was moving on. That I could."
Because Harry had loved him with an impossible effortlessness and fervor, and in a life like this, it doesn't seem possible indeed.
He listened when Harry told him about growing up in a cupboard, living with a family that starved him and never wanted him or cared for him, confessed that he had once craved their affection and acceptance so much that he made himself get better at everything they forced him to do to get any token of approval when he was young, but they never noticed or cared. He'd watch his cousin receive all their love for free, while he fought for it every day and never managed to make himself mean anything to them.
Harry stood up, left them to give them privacy, and stood outside the kitchen full of quiet grief, feeling his own heart weigh down to his feet. He rested his head back against the wall, closed his eyes.
Draco steps back with a scoff, crossing his arms. "Nevertheless, you understand that this calls for vengeance?"
Harry woke up nauseated and burning, like he was under the sun beating down over a desert. A feverish need was licking up beneath his skin, at the core of him, pooling hot, pulling for something with no sense of direction.
I’m still a bit breathless when I reply “I meant you to hear you reckless bastard.” Therefore the bite in my words is lost as he simply smiles at me.
He chuckles lowly and scoots closer, “I would love it if you made me pancakes, but you really don’t have to. I don't make a big fuss on my birthday. It's… never really been a cause for celebration.” He trails off with uncertainty at the end.
He seems to relish in making me wait because he doesn’t immediately lean in to lick off the cream, he simply takes his bottom lip between his teeth and
Well fuck, cut right to the fucking heart of my insecurity why doesn’t he, wanker. I don’t really have a response to that because he seems to already have figured it out. I simply shrug and lift my chin in a defiant manner, silently daring him to contradict me.
He’s visibly trembling now, and mumbling a series of expletives, he’s close. I remove my hands and mouth from him in one abrupt motion, and the whine I receive in return is something I won’t forget any time soon.
wills me to free his hands but I’m still determined that I’m going to make him come myself.  I lean down and kiss him hard, all tongue and teeth and no finesse.
And cue the guilt. Fuck, but I look back at my adolescent self and can’t help but loathe him. So proud, and selfish I was. Harry is constantly reminding me that I couldn’t really help it at the time because I was essentially conditioned to behave that way.  I can’t help but feel that this is a cop out, However, I love him for seeing the good in me, not that I’ve told him as much. Salazar this relationship is still so tentative I’d probably scare him off If I had. I shake my head in an attempt to clear the spiraling thoughts. It wouldn’t do to go fucking up his birthday with my self deprecating nonsense.
I’m horrifyingly breathless when I retort, “It’s your birthday, I suppose you’re entitled to make that decision for yourself. Also considering you’ve hindered my movement you’re free to do whatever you please, as you already know, git.” Salazar help me.  How Harry never ended up a bloody Slytherin I’ll never know.
He groans and attempts to break through the bonds holding his arms in place. I can tell he’s aching to grab onto my hips and thrust upward until I’m screaming and squirting all over his chest. “Nice try Potter,” I say with a throaty chuckle. “Sit back, relax,
to rid us of the mess on his chest. I chuckle when I realize he hasn’t cleaned the mess he left inside me.
He simply smiles again as he replies, “Don’t you think I worry about the same thing in regards to you?! Have you met you? You are insanely hard to please. I’m constantly afraid that If I wear the wrong pants you’ll be disappointed.” He chuckles,  “You can’t live your life in fear forever Draco, happiness comes with a little bit of risk. You simply have to find the person for whom the risk is worth taking.”
He takes great personal pleasure in forcing such noises from me, it’s a twisted thrill for him I cannot understand, yet he catches me off guard from time to time. I hate it… I love it. “is that all you got Potter?!” I squeak out
I have half a mind to reiterate this but he stops me, “You don’t get to say that you were forced to go to muggle university due to probation because while you were required to attend for two years you did not have to graduate with honors and go on to use your knowledge to revolutionize modern healing techniques. You didn’t have to find a way to introduce wizarding remedies for cancer into the muggle world without breaking the statute of secrecy, but you did. You may argue that it was just repenting, but you still did it and saved countless lives as a result.”
I turn my gaze to the floor because I can’t see the disappointment  there. I've seen it for most of my life and I can’t handle seeing disappointment from him, not anymore. He seems to silently mull it over for a few moments, but I refuse to look him in the eye. Suddenly he’s on his knees on the floor to my left and taking both of my hands in his. I still won’t meet his eyes so he lifts our joined hands and turns my face gently in his direction until grey eyes meet green.
Kreacher continues grumbling, however there are no audible words until, “Kreacher usually uses flour to make Master Harry pancakes.”
“You wound me Potter. Here I was slaving away like a bloody house elf...” but I’m cut off with a kiss. Can it even be called a kiss if the giver is smiling from ear to ear? “You made me breakfast. Thank you. No one but Molly or Kreacher has ever made me breakfast before.”
All of this, coupled with the stubble leaving the most delicious friction burn, never fails to turn me into a babbling mess. It’s gotten to the point where I’m scrabbling around for purchase attempting to regain control of the situation because fuck him for distracting me from my fucking task!
His eyes are actually wet, fuck I made him cry! I’m the worst boyfriend ever. I can’t even make breakfast right, I made him cry on his birthday I- “Draco, you wanted to make me breakfast so badly that you called Kreacher to show you how?!” He all but whispers incredulously, abruptly cutting off my pity party.
“You have no idea, you really have no idea…” he says in a choked up voice. I still have no idea what he’s on about so I simply wait for him to continue, “Draco, have you really convinced yourself that you aren’t worthy of love? Do you truly deep down believe that there’s no possible way someone, could actually love you for the person you’ve become? For the person you are?”
We’re not at the Manor, so I can’t ask a house elf. My flat isn’t large enough to warrant hiring one myself. Ugh why did I insist we stay at my flat instead of Grimmauld place? At least there we have… “Kreacher!” I whisper a call, hoping beyond all hope that he can hear me due to my Black heritage. With an audible
Shaking my head at the antics and the unbridled stubbornness, I remember that Harry had asked for whipped cream. “Kreacher, Harry requested whipped cream on his pancakes, do we have any?”
Kreacher looks irritated and insists, “Young Master Malfoy must learn patience, pancakes are only cooked on the top side, not the bottom side.”
The term of endearment slides out of his mouth so effortlessly as though he’s been saying it his whole life, and yet it throws me completely off kilter. How one simple  utterance can cause a near full blown panic is beyond me, but my heart is pounding and the blood is rushing in my ears because Harry fucking Potter just called me “Love.” I begin to ponder what my 13-year-old self would think if he was told that one day Harry Potter would refer to him as ‘love,’ but before I can delve any further into that train of thought, I’m ripped from my absurd reverie as Harry is again drawing lines with the whipped cream up the inside of my thighs from knee to groin.
The grin on his face is downright filthy. “Merlin’s pants you’re insatiable. Come, breakfast awaits.” He grabs a pair of pants and hurries into them as we head down the corridor back to the kitchen, and I’m grateful that Kreacher didn’t linger.
“It’s just, I erm… don’t know if you realize… said it twice… wasn’t sure if you… meant it for me.” I finish lamely.
a little funny, completely disgusting, albeit humorous. “Well, perhaps you don’t deserve the spoils from my kitchen if you’re going to mock my culinary skills before even letting me attempt something as simple as pancakes.”
My plan was to have him wake up to his first birthday surprise. Interestingly enough, the thing people find most irritating about me is my mouth, and yet Harry has learned fairly quickly that my snark is a small price to pay for having me put it to good use. I smirk to myself with smug satisfaction because head Auror or not, I can diminish this man to a whimpering mess in seconds using nothing but my tongue.
I hurriedly use the SPA-TOOLA to flip over the other two blobs and sure enough they look like pancakes too! Grinning, I turn toward Kreacher and say, “They look like pancakes! Are they done? Can I bring them to Harry now?”
It’s time to put an end to the spiraling thoughts I see flitting across his face. “Harry, please, don’t…”
He reaches for the bow on top of my head and pulls hard on one of the tails to loosen the ribbon, and immediately my hands are released from their bonds. My hands rush to his hips, and I start pulling him down onto my cock in a punishing rhythm. “Touch yourself Harry, I want to see you touch yourself.”
I swallow hard, I am in uncharted territory here, as I don’t handle emotional outbursts well. I settle for feigned indifference and superiority, “Well, naturally you’d receive nothing but the best from a man of particular refinement such as myself.”
The look he grants me in return is one I won’t soon forget. He looks at me as though I am precious, as though I mean the absolute world to him and it leaves my throat feeling as arid as the Sahara. He moves upward minutely and grasps onto my cock. The sudden shift is so unexpected that it elicits a moan and inadvertently causes me to avert my gaze toward the ceiling.
Once the butter is melted, Kreacher demonstrates how to measure out the proper amount of what he termed “batter” into the hot pan. I repeat the procedure twice until there are three circular, bland, blobs in the pan. Kreacher doesn’t give me any further instructions for a while, and I’m starting to get nervous that they’re going to burn, but once I notice the entire surface of each of the blobs covered in small visible bubbles, I hear Kreacher croak, “Kreacher must flip the pancakes now Master Draco,” while he beckons silently for the SPA-TOOLA thing in my hand.
I start off with a gentle tease, pressing open mouthed kisses up and down his shaft in an attempt to bring him to full hardness. His body is still extremely relaxed, so I’m guessing he’s still actually asleep. Smirking to myself, I flatten my tongue, and lick a fat stripe up the underside of his cock and feel it twitch in my hand. Preening, I then press little kitten licks to the sensitive spot on the underside just below the ridge that separates the head from the shaft. I continue this for a while, and slowly increase the pressure of my tongue. At this point he’s fully hard, so I continue mouthing at the underside, and stroke my thumb at the base of his cock for a dual sensation that he loves. It’s after I’ve been doing this for a few seconds that I finally hear him moan audibly.
He moans but begins stroking himself in time with my thrusts. I know I’m not going to last long, so I continue talking to him, “ That’s it Harry, you feel the pressure at the base of your cock?” He nods, “Look at me.” He does but doesn’t stop stroking himself, “You’re going to come so hard Harry, all you have to do is let go, come for me Harry.”
Oh, I guess that makes sense considering the bubbly side was still gloppy when I flipped them over. I nod solemnly and wait for further instruction. It seems like no time at all has passed when Kreacher says, “Master Malfoy can put pancakes on a plate for Master Harry now.”
“Don’t worry Harry, I’ll take care of you.” I resume kissing him and thrusting at the same time. The position makes it more difficult for me to maneuver, but my cock is rubbing against his abs and it’s fucking fantastic. I feel him trying to shift his legs below me and I let him because I don’t want to stop the assault on his mouth.
I turn to him with a fierce glare, “No boyfriend of mine is going to have a subpar birthday Potter. You will have your fucking pancakes and you will fucking enjoy them do you understand me?”
Turning my attention back to Harry, I can’t help mirroring his infectious grin as he pours maple syrup and uses the absurd can to twist a huge dollop of cream on top of his stack. I’ve also noticed that Harry insists on adding an abundance of things he really enjoys to his plate. It’s as though he fears he will never have it again so he has to get as much as he possibly can while he’s able. Again, this nauseates me, because it is a clear indication that at some point he was food insecure.
Kreacher begins muttering to himself, “Master Harry has a descendant of the ancient and most noble house of Black cooking like a house elf, what would mistress say? Oh the shame, the shame”
Immediately I grab for the SPA-TOOLA and scoop them out of the pan and lay them in a slightly lopsided stack. I am beyond proud of myself for actually doing it correctly that I turn to tell Kreacher he can leave, but instead Kreacher has placed more butter in the pan and is making more pancakes with the leftover batter.
He beams at me again and says, “Can’t really be considered a sacrifice if the colour actually suits you, git.”
“You great sap, you’re making me feel like the worst boyfriend on the planet with all the waterworks you know. What kind of arsehole makes their boyfriend cry multiple times on their birthday, I ask you?”
“Yes Kreacher, I want to cook him breakfast for his birthday. He didn’t have great birthdays growing up, and I feel quite horrible about it, so I want to make every birthday he celebrates with me the best I possibly can. Harry appreciates gestures more than material gifts so I
I’m honestly dumbfounded at this point because I have no inclination as to what he’s planning. It makes me feel slightly wrong footed to tell the truth.  I watch him warily, however he simply smiles at me, proceeds to sit in my lap, and presses an unbelievably chaste kiss on my lips.  He pulls back and smiles at me so I return it 10-fold.
“Well, you’ve never had someone who appreciates the finer things in life to bestow said luxuries upon you.”
He leans in and places another extremely gently kiss on another one of my scars and then gets to his feet. His cock is rock hard and inches from my face.  At this point I’m hard as fucking granite and having his cock inches from my mouth causes immediate salivation. I’m half convinced that he’s seconds away from sliding it in my mouth over my tongue, therefore I lean forward and attempt to lick the bead of pre-come that’s attempting to dribble down his shaft, but surprisingly, he simply chuckles and moves his hips away.
I hear my alarm chime softly on the bedside table, and immediately reach over to silence it. I scrunch up my eyes and slowly turn back toward the bed hoping with everything I have that I didn’t wake up Harry.  He’s quite the light sleeper considering everything he’s been through, but it seems as though I’ve managed to wake up without him noticing.
I look over into his face full of insecurity. It’s clear he is worried that I lied about making breakfast, and he thinks I simply pity him. I can’t bear to see that lost crup expression for another second, so I cut to the chase, “If you must know, I was unaware of the proper pancake prepping procedure, so I called for Kreacher and he instructed me on how to make them, but I did make them myself, I promise. I used the SPA-TOOLA and everything. Kreacher brought over the muggle whipped cream from Grimmauld place.”
He’s not having it however, because he places his hand under my chin and gently lifts my gaze to his and says, “I ask myself the same thing about you.” My flush intensifies, damn my pasty arse skin, and rather than continue looking at him, I lean in and press the gentlest of kisses to the right corner of his mouth. He hums his contentment and finally casts a
Salazar, the way he unabashedly shoves his face right in there and honest to Merlin attacks my arsehole in the best way possible, is near indescribable. He flattens his tongue, and licks repeatedly over the opening, and then when you least expect it, he starts jabbing his tongue attempting to breach the hole. If that wasn’t enough, he grazes his fucking teeth on the sensitive skin of my rim causing my whole fucking body to tremble.
He seems to understand because he stops bobbing up and down, and adjusts his position. He leans back with his left hand on my right knee, his right hand on my left shoulder. He then begins grinding into me again with his head thrown back in ecstasy. He seems to have found the angle that presses my cock against his prostate because he cries out, “What the fuck was that?!”
I begin eating my own stack of pancakes, I notice Kreacher put fresh berries on mine to better suit my tastes. I smile to myself, perhaps I’ll send Kreacher a gift for helping me out today. I wouldn’t have been able to make Harry smile like that on my own.
“Don't you see? I don’t feel as though I am throwing anything away Draco, I feel as though everything I thought I wanted is trivial compared to how I feel when I’m with you. We can still have a family. To hell with tradition,  I only want a family with you. Nothing would make me happier. I want my kids to grow up in a household where I’m just a boring old dad who snores on the sofa with his glasses lopsided. I don’t want any children of mine being brought up to think that I’m some hero and have them live in my shadow. I want to be with you Draco, because when I’m with you I don’t have to pretend to be something I’m not. If I trip over my open shoe laces, you’re likely to laugh at my expense not rush over to coddle me with, ‘oh no mister Potter’ or ‘are you okay mister Potter?’”
He chuckles again, grabs me by the waist and unceremoniously drags me to sit on his lap, our faces inches apart, “You wish Malfoy.” And after bestowing me with one last radiant smile, he leans in to mouth at my neck yet again.
“Me.” He says simply, the smug wanker as if this is an everyday occurrence. Not even wondering at the fact that I’m freaking the fuck out because I’m balls deep in Harry fucking Potter’s arse right now and it’s taking every ounce of willpower to prevent myself from coming. Fuck this is something I never actually anticipated coming to fruition, but now that it has I never want it to end.
Before I fully realize what is happening, I feel intense pressure around the head of my cock, as he leans in and resumes mouthing at my exposed neck. The resultant whine echoes through the kitchen, and elicits a chuckle from the bloody Gryffindor slowly impaling himself on my cock without warning.
Unbidden, a moan escapes my lips. Leave it to this arsehole to master casting wandless summoning spells, as if the majority of wizards cast wandlessly on a daily basis. His constant displays leave me hard and aching on a regular basis and the bloody wanker is completely aware of this. His gaze darkens and the corner of his mouth lifts into a smug fucking smirk. Git needs to stop stealing my fucking trademark, thank you.
“You always managed to make me feel ordinary, and that means way more to me than dealing with your past mistakes or constantly having to worry about you. It’s me you’re talking about. I'd worry about you anyway, also you’re more than capable of handling yourself, you know this.” He ends with a shy smile.
My trademark smirk slides right into place on my face where it belongs, “Don’t you worry your pretty little head Potter. I plan on keeping my first place status until the day I die.”
I let out a sigh of relief, because the elf seems to be begrudgingly willing to help me. I move to grab flour from the cupboard when I hear Kreacher continue, “Kreacher also uses salt, baking powder, sugar, milk, eggs and butter for Master Harry’s pancakes.”
I let out a huff of exasperation, “Yes you and your bloody inarticulate tendencies are apparently starting to rub off on me.” He simply smirks at that, he knows that I resort to petty insults as a deflection tactic. Snake hiding in a lion’s body I swear to Merlin.
And there it is again, the profound sentiment that makes my heart skip several beats. I turn to look at him properly now that I have some blood being directed back toward my brain. There’s no trace of regret, not even a slight twinge of insincerity in his expression and it’s terrifying. I war with myself internally deciding whether I should bring it up, or write it off as a heat of the moment thing. Before I even open my mouth to respond he lifts up off my lap, lazily waves his hand to vanish the remaining mess, and looks me dead in the eye, “You don’t have to look so terrified you know.” He finishes with a wan smile.
The sight of Harry Potter on his knees, with his face less than a metre from my cock, might possibly supersede any other vision I’ve encountered in my relatively short life. His beautiful green eyes staring up at me through dark lashes, a coy, playful grin on his face, it nearly suffocates me with desire. But then, the grin fades into a guilt ridden, sullen expression. At first I’m nonplussed as to what’s caused the drastic change in demeanor, however seeing where his gaze has landed answers the question before it leaves my mouth.
My heart stops beating and the reality of what he just said crashes into me in an instant. My immediate response is to scream at the top of my voice that he’s lying, and trying to make a fool out of me.
Sometimes I still can’t believe I’m allowed to be here, lying next to him, seeing him like this with no walls, it’s the most intimate corner of our relationship and I cherish the trust he has found for me beyond anything else.  Today, I want to show him how incredibly special he is, not only to me, but to everyone included in his life.  I want to make him feel cherished, loved, and worthy of said love because due to his upbringing he needs constant validation. Validation I am more than willing to provide, mind you.  It’s the least I can do after...yeah, after.
Anger begins to surface now he’s stopped moving, “What they actual fuck Potter? Reckless bloody Gryffindor, did you even prepare yourself?! Merlin and Morgana who decides to impale themselves the first time as a bottom are you fucking mental?!” The last part comes out as a squeak because he deliberately clenches around me in an effort to cut me off.
I can’t even begin to describe how incredible moments like these are for me.  Something as simple as laughing with Harry can lift my mood for the rest of the day. I know deep down that I’ve wanted this for far longer than I’m willing to admit to anyone, and having it is still so surreal.
I wrap my lips around the head and slide all the way down again, but before I pull back, I swallow around him which causes him to cry out, “Draco, FUCK!” I glance up at him out of the corner of one eye as I slide back up and do it again. He’s muttering unintelligible praise now, and I can feel him starting to thrust his hips in the smallest involuntary movements, so I return my attention to the sensitive underside. He always loses control when I nibble at the ridge where his shaft needs the head, so I resume my earlier ministrations that were so rudely interrupted. I don’t want to neglect the rest of him, so I use my thumb to stroke the base and my other hand to fondle his balls.
He splutters inelegantly, and I just grin down at him, “Manners Potter, I won’t have you and your penchant for heroism interrupting my generosity.” Before he can get a word in, I slide down and resume my assault on his now steadily leaking erection. Interesting, perhaps we will have to revisit this some other time.
Just to be contrary and piss him off a bit because FUCK he’s sexy when he’s angry, “Are you insinuating that you weren’t enjoying your gift?”
Finally, I feel the telltale vice like grip of his orgasm trigger, and watch as streaks of come fly out of his cock and land on my chest.  I try to ride it out, but the rhythmic clenching on my cock tips me over, and I’m spilling inside him mere seconds after the first drop of his come splashes  near my chin.
Deciding to do just that as an introduction to the birthday celebrations I’ve planned, I try to slowly dip beneath the covers and without waking him, settle myself between his legs.  I’m fortunate that he is sleeping on his back, although getting into position without waking him is proving to be a challenge. I try to climb over his left leg but he shifts and bends his knee toward me basically preventing anything or anyone accessing the desired area. I let out a huff of frustration and consider what else I could do.
Dimly, I hear Harry chuckling in the background, “Perhaps spending so much time with Kreacher was ill advised. I can hear your mumbled diatribe ya know.”
Kreacher barks utterances at me under his breath until I’ve created a lumpy liquid concoction of sorts. Looks sort of like a pale batch of polyjuice gone wrong if I’m honest. Kreacher instructs me to heat the pan over medium high heat, and then when he realizes I have no idea how to use the stove, he shows me how to adjust it to the correct setting.
He growls, and then pulls me in for another kiss to throw me off guard before he grabs me by the hips, and deftly changes our positions so I’m now on my back and he’s pressing me into the mattress.
I take a moment to simply observe him as he sleeps.  It’s unusual that I get to see him in such a vulnerable state, but I relish these rare times.  He looks so damn peaceful like this. No tension in his jaw, eyelids gently closed, hair a mess, eyelashes lying softly on his cheeks. He looks young, and carefree in a way that he hardly ever is when awake. Carries the weight of the world on his shoulders this one.
Kreacher appears in the middle of my kitchen, and I have never in my life been more elated to see the cantankerous creature.
Fuck, but Potter’s cock is already partially filled out. The impressive bulge straining obscenely against the fabric of his boxer briefs has me salivating already. Patience wearing thin, I slowly lower the waistband of his pants until his cock is accessible. He’s not yet fully hard, so it’s still resting softly against his bollocks.  I gently use my hand to raise it up just enough so I can slide the head between my lips.
There are no words, none whatsoever. I have literally no response for him.  I simply stare wide eyed, mouth gaping at the fact that he is actually correct. I don’t think I deserve for anyone to claim they love me, let alone the bloody saviour of the wizarding world. Actually it just makes me feel worse because the way he is presenting it, I’m not only being self-deprecating, but also underestimating him which leaves me feeling raw, and like the biggest prick to walk the planet.
Malfoy waited a few seconds. When Harry didn't oblige, he turned and made his way over to the bar across the room. His hair was tucked behind his ears, only just reached the wrap of his black, woollen rollneck. "What do you like to drink?"
Harry pushed him down and pinned him to the couch, pressed flush against him between the spread of his legs. Rolled against him, both of them gasping again, trembling from the overwhelming surge of exhilaration and pleasure, just by that alone.
He tells him about his journey to Healing, his examinations and training at St. Mungos. He tells him about his visits to Narcissa, about Ron and Hermione and everybody, his renovations of Grimmauld Palace. In return, Draco tells him little stories about his time in Wales, about Pansy and Blaise, all the things they did and the places they went.
"Because she likes you. She thinks you're lovely, but she thinks that about anybody that talks to her. And no offense, Malfoy, but speaking from experience, you're not the loveliest bloke I've ever known. You keep to yourself more now, and that's all I know. I don't really know who you are, if you aren't your father's son. She's been through enough, so… fair warning. You do anything to hurt her..."
Draco's movements faltered at that, and then he continued, searching through a cabinet of some ingredients. It was full of strangely shaped things, colourful liquids, bags of herbs or plants, jars of internal organs or body parts of some creatures. A fang here, a claw there. A small heart. "I didn't ask you to do that," he said, indifferent.
"Surely it's not all grey," Madam Aileen says. Draco arches an brow, looking up at her, and wonders if she doesn't understand how literally he means this, if she thinks he's speaking in metaphors. "Surely there's something of colour in your life? Even just one?"
He was at a jewellery shop in muggle London, one that Hermione had suggested, delighted, when Harry had told her his plans. The lady on the other side of the counter was telling him about the one he was eying inside the glass—it was silver, with intricate carvings that met at moonstone jewel, pretty swirls of a border around it.
Harry quickly scrambled up, Malfoy off of him, leaning on his palms and feet. Malfoy seemed just as confused and wild-eyed about it all, his chest still heaving like Harry's, blinking hard up at the ceiling.
They have a lovely dinner and take a walk through the city. Draco puts his coat around Harry's shoulders when he sees him shivering in the chill of the arriving winter. Harry slips his hand into Draco's and entwines their fingers together, neither of them letting go as they talk and talk until, at the end of it, they are standing at Harry's door, and Draco asks if he can kiss him, and Harry says yes.
It was in the silence that draped over them comfortably that Harry noticed the cold grasp around one of his hands, one pale, lithe hand still tangled tightly around it between their bodies.
Draco withdraws from her hands, shaking his head. She drops them to the bed, her lips pressing together. "I'm not going there."
Something was tight in the back of his throat. Harry closed his eyes, leaned forward onto his hands on the counter, and tried to breathe. He didn't know what would have hurt worse in the end — if he had taken every bit of time he could have had with him, having him. If he hadn't had anything at all, hadn't had even more to lose when the grief of losing him already felt like dying himself.
Harry's mind snags onto the last part of that. It skips over him with no meaning. "A good part of their lives…?"
It started with the quiet mornings, the wireless turned off, making the silence hollow and loud. Then it was the empty table, an empty chair in the kitchen except for meals, and when Harry went looking for Draco, he found him crammed into a corner of his makeshift potions lab
Harry pulled him closer with the flat of his forearm against Draco's spine, kissing the corner of his mouth, pushed a lock of his hair back behind an ear and pressed a small, chaste kiss to his lips. There was a very imperceptible twitch of a smile in his sleep. Harry laughed softly, overcome by an overwhelming riot of emotions. He wanted to kiss him all over, hold him so close to himself there was nothing between them, love him without an inhale. He ran his other hand down his side over his shirt, settling still at his hipbone in the curl of a grip, all of it, like a habit now. There was a lingering need, even now, to ease pain where there was no longer pain, now just left with the phantoms of his built up instincts, following along to it.
"Not a lot. Just… you know. When things are bad, and they get busy and I isolate myself without realising I'm doing it again. Like it all comes back. But not anymore — they make sure I don't, whenever they can."
"Unca? Like—like Unca 'on?" Teddy asks, the entire half of his face scrunched up in question. Draco momentarily has trouble understanding the syllables childishly running together, and finally translates it as
There were memories, scattered through their school years, easy moments by the Great Lake, snow fights in Hogsmeade, and a Yule Ball dream that rang like a familiar story — Harry tripping over his feet, the two of them dancing — and Harry remembered Draco telling him about it, only he didn't know then what he truly meant
He goes quieter. His answers become shorter. His gaze becomes lower, the tremor of his hands repressed around the arms of the chair. She notices it all, and where it tangles together.
Once they were out, thankfully unnoticed and unrecognized any further, Harry turned him around, and then wondered if that unbidden touch would offend the Slytherin. It didn't. Malfoy just moved with his touch and rolled his eyes, as if he knew what was coming.
"Oh, Harry." It's Hermione. She's settling against his side, pulling him against her shoulder. There's a part of him that wants to be angry at her, for telling him what she did, for throwing that in, but he's tired and empty and heartbroken and even now he understands that she was seeing what he didn't, that she was thinking about Draco too in some way, and he can't fault her for that. She strokes his hair. "I'm sorry," she whispers.
"Draco Malfoy," Harry said, softly, as he held it up between them. He was tired and sad, his eyes gritty and lashes clumped, but he was smiling, warm and loved and full of love, and he wanted Draco to have everything he wanted in life. To be happy, most of all. "Will you marry me?"
Draco had been jealous of it all once, watching him with something ugly and aching in his chest underneath something else entirely, something rawer. Now that he's more detached from the competition, he can see it in all its wonder.
"They won't ever know what they…" Draco's voice trails off, in a low voice. He huffs, derisive. "The way I can't even stand the thought of... I don't remember any of it, but I
"I didn't know what divorce was until I was ten," Draco said, a little while after the server had left, as if he'd been thinking of something to say. He was cutting into his breakfast. "I just always assumed the children that spoke of going to their mother or father's at different points of time had two houses, and it was to differentiate."
Harry stared at him for a moment. He knew this was a bad idea, and he knew Ron and Hermione were going to tell him the same thing when he told them about this. But for whatever reason, perhaps only to uncover yet another mystery, to solve the enigma of Draco Malfoy, he found himself answering exasperatedly, "Fine. Yes. I'll be there."
and Draco, the screen all fumbling black and tussling noise as he stole the camera from Harry, turned it onto Harry's own face to say,
why one of the stipulations was that they were legally mandated to take any and all measures and decisions to ensure the security of their lives, to the best of their abilities.
"Because I wanted a more private space, Potter." He was flipping through the pages looking for something.
Strange that he knew these things—what Draco looked like when he was naked, what he sounded like when he came, but still didn't know when he started playing his violins, or what his favourite food was. What colour he liked most.
it happened, when his love for her became nothing more than what it was when she was eleven and he was twelve. Was it the war that changed them? Was it the distance between them during the time he went hunting Horcruxes?
Harry broke out of his paralysis and moved forward, his mind still trying to comprehend what just happened.
When the waitress left, Malfoy's silver gaze turned to him, remaining for a moment, before he said, "Look, if you're worried about your heterosexuality sensibilities getting offended… let me just tell you, I don't give a damn."
— Merlin and Morgana and Salazar, you're so—" He ruffles through more of them, all the tomfoolery and ridiculousness of their younger selves, smiling faintly. Draco's doodles, Harry's additions sent back. "I don't remember drawing half of these."
"Those weeks you were gone, and I didn't know where you were," Narcissa begins softly. Her thumb rubs his palm in circles. "It felt like you never really came back."
"Well, just so you know, Potter," Malfoy said. "They're not like that here. Not the staff, at least. I've seen it happen, and they were nothing but supportive."
, Bill had said of the alteration procedure. It was only just a recent development. He didn't say it was the first thing closest to a solution ever found when it came to cursed bonds, the only one there was as of yet. He'd known Harry would latch on, then, to this uncertain answer, and that was what he did.
things. Longbottom's bed is empty a lot of these nights, and he's seen the way he smiles at her when she isn't looking. He slants a smirk at her, quick, half-distracted by the task at hand. "Did he tell you that when he was in bed with you?"
Draco looks mildly intrigued. His mind seems to be turning, his eyes twitching to narrow for a split-second. He seems to have realized something. Harry suddenly regrets his decision when he considers that he might be thinking of Sixth Year. "And out of all the things you could do with it, you're using it to stalk after me of all people?"
Malfoy smirked, a sort of pleased half-grin that trapped his lower lip behind his teeth, as he stepped back. Harry's heart did a strange flip. "See you then."
"I'd never have married somebody like you if I could help it," Harry said, staring him dead in the eye. "And I want everybody to know that."
"You're not alone, okay? I'm here, aren't I?" Harry leaned back, kissed his face, and pushed his nose to the space between his eyebrows, wishing he had gotten the Gryffindor courage to talk to him a long time ago. "Draco, please."
"Huh." Draco huffs, impressed and fascinated. He lets it fall from his fingers into his palm, gripping it as he shakes it slightly to Harry. "And
Malfoy shook his head, as if to brush it off. "It's—I'm afraid it can't be more than a one-time thing."
Harry has read them so many times, when he could bear it, before he thought Draco would forget him. They are almost ingrained into his mind.
Draco went inside for a moment, announcing his greeting to Andromeda and that he was going outside along with Teddy, before he came back out, clicked the door shut, slipping his hands in his pockets and moving down the stairs.
"I mean, I like it. When others do it. But I always feel a bit like I don't know how to react. So I just go a bit still, like if I move, I'll make it weird."
"One of these days," Draco is saying, pushing at the tie knot at his collar with a thumb and forefinger. He picks off the coat from the bed, putting it around Harry. "One of these days, you are going to learn to wake up on time."
"Whatever, Potter," Draco interrupts. Harry looks up at him, and finds a conflicted expression, as if he's warring with himself over something. "I want to see the map."
At first he is afraid because he has only gotten out of a relationship three months ago, and he doesn't know what Ginny will think of Harry feeling this way about somebody else when Ron tells him she still misses him. And he doesn't know what Ron will think of the way he feels for Draco after everything, when Ginny might still be in love with him. At first he is confused because he has gone his entire life not knowing he can feel this way about boys (though that surely has much to do with a lack of time and opportunity at Hogwarts). Or maybe it's just one boy.
Harry huffs, looking ahead at the portrait on the wall across from them—a bizarrely dressed man standing in front of the mirror, fixing up his hair and making kissy noises at himself. "Well, can
Draco remembers being seven years old and learning to fly with his father here. When he reminisces with his mother over this, she smiles, but there is a twitch of something in her eyes. After a long, silent moment, she says, "It wasn't your father who'd taught you to fly, darling. We'd hired a private flight instructor for you, do you remember?"
"Fuck," Draco whispers, in an almost hysterical laugh. His fingers raise up, trembling, pressing to the furrow between his brows. Again, quieter, "Fuck."
"I only just got here myself, Potter," Malfoy brushed off, waving a hand dismissively. Harry felt a strange sort of twist in his chest at the blatant lie, and the possible idea behind why Malfoy lied. Harry shook his head.
That was how they found themselves sitting at the edge of a pier, legs hanging over it, knees brushing together.
Malfoy got right up to the front of the queue, pulling Harry out from between the bodies he was stuck behind and next to him.
it's an old and comprehensive book on bonds that's very hard to come by. The amount of strings I had to pull! Also, Bill's learned some things in the last month. Everything I tell you, pass it on to Malfoy, will you?" She waited for Harry's nod, and then continued, shifting around on the chair to get comfortable. "Bill wanted to come by and tell you all this himself, but he's been swamped up in cases. He's been running himself ragged researching on the curse in his free time
"Yeah. I don't… it's like you don't ever let me doubt it." Draco's brows furrow together, puzzled. Harry's grip tightens. "The thing about growing up without, um... without love, I suppose... is that it makes you forget that it's always there in the people that do love you, even if they're not saying it, or showing it outright. I've learned that it's not like that but… but it's nice, that you're always saying it, or showing it."
"The war feels like a dream sometimes," Harry says. They're laid on their backs on the floor of the Astronomy Tower, where all the stars scattered rich and bright above them. The wireless plays on between their heads. "Like it never happened. And it's… strange, isn't it, how people have moved on so fast?"
"We need to," Malfoy's voice was strained, rough, between heavy breaths. He was grabbing his arm, and there came the cooling relief, but it was dissatisfactory, not enough. "I think we need—"
Quidditch Practice comes by and Potter has to leave, and this time it's only a tangle of their hands between their bodies, a thumb over Draco's knuckles. Potter smiles at him again, so painfully fond and gentle it hurts, but it doesn't entirely make sense why it does.
"Imagine a circle of the magic moving through you and him," Xavier said, trying to simplify it. "But the lines are thicker when they pass through him, narrower through you."
After the war, Harry had been offered a job as an Auror, but he'd stayed behind to spend his final year with his friends. He had wanted to be a teenager, or something like it, just for a while longer. But by graduation, all the doubts had creeped in, in particular as he went through his Mind-Healing sessions throughout Eighth Year.
"If we don't find you, Molly's going to hex us! If not her, then your grandmum! What are we going to do, Teddy?"
Ginny nodded towards Draco and Luna. She took his hand, stepping close to him, Harry taking the cue and putting his hand to her mid-back. The two of them moved easily into the positions of a dance. "Malfoy. I saw you at dinner. You kept smiling and looking at him." She stood on her toes to look over his shoulder, and then she shrugged, made a face, humming. "And I mean, alright. I get it. He grew up well, and he
"You beat me to it," Ron said. He was getting up from his seat, hands held up to take her into his arms. "I had a whole bloody speech ready, 'Mione. Oh my bloody Hell—"
go looking for him, though when Draco is in the same room or place as him, he can't help but feel vividly aware of him, of his presence in their shared classes or when he's there at the same time as him in the library or when they're all gathered on the Hogwarts grounds and he's there, sitting either alone with a book in hand or learning wandless magic with Luna, or simply held in a conversation with her.
By the window where the storm roared outside, they danced in a deliberate swaying of shoulders and waist, so that they rotated around in circles of small steps. Draco was laughing inwardly in his chest, cheeks folding in with it, their foreheads together as he dipped his head. Harry took him in closer, so that they were cheek to cheek instead, Draco's arms coming around his shoulders, the two of them still swaying, turning, in the circle of a dance.
Harry is thinking of Draco's wand in his hand, unicorn hair core and hawthorn wood. The smoothness and ease of his own magic passing into it, its complete obedience to him. He thinks of Draco's face, close to his own, starlights illuminating the silver of his eyes in the dimness of the night sky blanketing the hospital ceiling, full of something raw and hushed. The way they had followed Harry's smile. The way he'd smiled back at him, for the first time ever.
"I love you," Harry said, very softly, and Draco went quiet, looking down at his face. It was very close to his own. His mouth quirked, in that way he only ever smiled at Harry with. He looked back to what he was doing, running his hands through Harry's hair. All tender hands and damp hair, that light apostrophe smile mellowing his cheeks.
Draco looked deeply alarmed, seeing him begin to weep again out of nowhere, and Harry laughed, tremulous, shaking his head, taking his wrist and kissing the inside of it. Draco smoothed a thumb over his cheek with that same hand, even as he was bemused.  "Sorry. Nothing. I just
Warning for a brief mention to past child emotional abuse (related to Harry's past with the Dursleys)
He shrugged again. Harry wanted to break something. "Only to make sure there were no ill-intentions involved, of course."
They drink their coffee in silence after. Harry lets it go on, so Draco can settle down some, and thinks back through these past years. He thinks, again, of all the things he has been wanting to say, that he used to say into a coin that had nobody on the other end. There were so many things, and yet now, finally sitting here in front of Draco, in the surreal wonder of a moment he once waited and hoped for desperately, they've all seemed to become vapour in his mind. He wants to ask him so many things —
"Right. Well." There was a pause, still in that toneless, cautious way. "I suppose you'd know more about it."
Harry closed the door behind him, turning away. He pulled his jumper up over his head as he made his way over to the wardrobe, threw it aside and changed into a plain shirt. He was painfully aware of the man behind him, in his bed, as he sat down at the edge of the bed and pushed his trousers off, left in his boxers.
"Alright?" Harry asked, and was very conscious of what was on his canvas—the incomplete half-way profile of a face, turned just so over a shoulder, and the strokes of burgundy at the very bottom of the canvas. There was the outline of hair still uncoloured, swept up into a half-up, the half down loose over the nape of a neck, tucked over an ear but for a swirling tendril. A moment in motion stilled into a painting.
Harry had stood upright in the midst of his malaise, tangled up in a need for relief still somewhat bearable as of yet, but was steadily overtaking his mind. Malfoy had stood up from his chair, apparently having noticed the state of him, had grabbed him by the arm the next second with a quick glance and a polite,
The alteration did work, was the thing, and now the curse would die out in exactly five years from the day it happened. They would be twenty-four by then, and what Harry was realising was that twenty years was unimaginably long, but five years was still an overwhelmingly long time.
Draco is clearly baffled, frozen with it. Up close like this, he can see the dark circles around Draco's eyes. They'd eased over the last few months, now back again, but Harry hasn't been sleeping all too well these weeks either.
In the moment that follows, his mind works over a decision, and then settles with certainty. Harry looks up at Draco, a quirk of a smile at his lips. "Well. I'll be staying here too."
Warning: this chapter deals with panic attacks, depressive responses and dissociation as a part of PTSD (and some mentions of Harry's abusive past with the Dursleys) but by no means is the portrayal meant to encompass the true complexity of it!
Draco blinks, hard and fast. His fingers idly brush over the semi-solid threads as he observes them, and is strangely soothed by the connection, the gesture, as he tries to pull his mind back and into the present instead. It's a long time after, with Luna talking softly to him, trying to ground him, that he calms down enough for his heartbeats to steady, his breaths slowed to a more even pace.
Warning for one line that deals with passive suicidal ideation, allusions to Draco's past abuse in one letter
When they do speak, it's at the same time, "I thought—" "You look—" And then they're both caught in a, "you go first," "what were you saying—"
"Everywhere—nowhere—I don't know, I can't tell—" it came out shaky, forced out of him all fragmented and tight. Draco gasped a sound that bordered on a sob. He swallowed hard, trying to speak. His face twisted, and he shook harder, his voice a whisper when it did come again, "It

The bedsheets rustle, followed by the sound of bare feet padding over to his makeshift bed a moment after, growing clearer as she nears. He feels a shift beside him, feels the weight dipping on his makeshift bed, her gentle hand in his hair.
"Did you think I was that much of an arsehole?" Ron asks after, moving back, huffing a bit ruefully.
Luna Lovegood comes into Draco's compartment and asks if she can sit with him, trailed by Neville Longbottom, who shuffles uncomfortably in the doorway with his toad in hand. He walks inside anyway after Draco's off-handed affirmation, his jaw set decisively. Lovegood seems fully oblivious, as expected, to the strained dynamic between the two of them.
In these letters, Harry lives a whole life with Draco that he has no memory or knowledge of outside of these words, these disordered accounts of a life Harry can see himself wanting all of, here, in their imperfect reality, with his imperfect self. He wants a modest-sized house, and all his drawings and notes everywhere through their house. He wants to pull Draco onto their countertops, kiss him there every morning, every night, all the time. He wants to draw him into spontaneous dances whenever he felt like it, dance with him by Christmas trees and fairylights. He wants all of this. All of him.
Potter leaves a moment after, when he is ignored. Draco pushes himself up into a sitting position, back against the pillows, his spine aching and his back muscles throbbing with the echoes of a broken body, fatigue laying thick over his bones. It feels a little less like being trapped inside of himself, sitting up like this. He reaches for the notes, reading through them, trying to, but his foggy and drowsy brain isn't cooperating much.
"It was like being homesick," Draco says, finally, when it comes to him. He shrugs, a slight bounce of his shoulders. "Only there was nowhere to go back to."
"Aren't you helpful," Draco said. Harry looked down at the top of his drink, swallowing hard. A moment after, he said, softer, "Thank you, for the offer. And for doing what you did."
The next chapter begins with Draco awakened by Harry's tears, unbeknownst to Harry, and is calmed only by the sight of him. Harry later tells him of his father and godfather's death, and his mother being on House Arrest. He decides to stay with Draco at St. Mungos after witnessing his grief from outside the door. Having lived a bright and beautiful life that is completely opposite to his reality, one where Harry could never feel what he'd felt for him there, Draco tries to push him away by pulling all of his old antics to save himself any more grief. Harry eventually explodes out of anger and leaves, and then on calming, decides that it is best for him to not stay if Draco doesn't want him there.
feel it." He paused, tapping his fingers. "Ideally, it should be… something steady and constant, you see. Something fulfilling.
Harry sat there through the silence stretching after his own voice, only the tinny song from the wireless on the kitchen table, taking him in — the back of his head tilted against the edge of the counter, his eyes red and swollen. His face was held together, worn and hollow.
After a quick charm wiped Malfoy and his hand, he pulled Malfoy's pants and trousers up, watched him closely for changes, but he was still shivering, just the same. Malfoy's brows twitched, and he looked confused, shifting on his back a little. He made a rough and strangled sound.
He wonders what she's like, sometimes, what it is that Potter sees in her. From all that he's heard of her, she's expressive, confident and bold.
Draco looks at him, a hushed and unfathomable stare. Harry works his lower lip, turns his head away. A few seconds after, Draco digs around in the bag one-handed and throws him a box of treacle tarts.
Harry blinks, caught off-guard at the abrupt upbringing of the topic. "What's up with me and Malfoy?"
"Could this… could this be a threat to his life?" Harry asked, staring wide and fixated down at the desk. "If it went wrong?"
Ron has stopped paying much attention to the film, though he doesn’t say anything. He’s just listening.
Draco snorted. "What? Do you want this as well?" That was how he talked to Teddy, like he was a very small adult that understood everything that was said to him. It was oddly sweet.
"He didn't look like..." Harry said, after a while. "He didn't look like he knew what had happened either."
She leaves, when he huffs exasperatedly and slumps back down. Then comes somebody else through the curtains.
Harry nodded in understanding and agreement, and said nothing further. He wasn't… entirely sure of what to think. So far, Malfoy had been alright with him, but he kept dodging the question as to why they were here.
On the porch Draco comes to join him, wearing his coat. Harry doesn't notice how cold he is until the heavy warmth is seeping into his body, down his back. Draco has lifted a side of his coat and draped it over Harry's shoulders, the two of them huddled closely together under it.
, the two of them bickering over him being so hard to please. Draco kissing him after, laughing at him. A memory from another life.
He breathes through the weight pushing down on his lungs, trying to follow a rhythm, trying to follow a voice, a comfort, a too bright and vivid memory of a solid chest and a still arm around his back.
When Draco got visibly tired and low, which he still did whenever he pushed himself too hard, they sat down on the couch, and Harry let him lay his head on his collarbone, nestle against him with arm around Harry's bicep, and doze off a little as the party went on. Harry put up a Muffliatio spell to keep the music and chatter out, and held him, stroking his hair gently.
Harry swallowed, his heart a dull, weary race. He brought his fingers almost to his brow, pushed it up half in his mop of curls instead, the other half at his hairline. A close-mouthed breath shuddered through his nose, trembling through his shoulders.
Somewhere around midnight, Draco wakes up with a rapid heartbeat, scrambles out of sweat-soaked bed-sheets, unable to bear the mattress against his body, the silence, the walls around him, the dim starlights not enough to overpower the darkness falling on him.
"It's alright. It's not your fault," Malfoy murmured, a mirthful inflection in a near-whisper. Harry didn't have to look at him to know he was smirking, all that arrogance that Harry knew so well. "I know what I look like."
The initials of Harry's name, etched into his skin. He smiles softly, turning his head up to glance up at Draco. He brings it to his lips, feels Draco's thumb trace his brow.
Harry huffs, derisive. He didn't come back from the dead and fight Voldemort only to live his life according to the way strangers felt he should. "Then they can take that up with me."
Harry was frozen for a full ten seconds, confused. Then the adrenaline shot through him, tore him off his painting stool and across the drawing room and down the corridor.
There's a memory, flash of pale hair and paler eyes, of canines, of the taste of blood, of a raw and hoarse throat, the sound of screaming and crying. There's a memory, hands on him, bruising and dirty, touch and collision. There's a memory, and a fester of a sickening feeling beneath his skin. The air that's left him is not quite coming back into his lungs again, and the stiffness of his body holds him down and still, holds his eyes down to the ground.
"I'm not really doing anything." Harry turned to look at Emelie. "I haven't, but I have a friend who does. They're just as you think, fire-breathing, larger than life."
Draco hummed. They lapsed into silence again. On the wall was a shape of a diagonal shard of evening light, yellow-orange illuminating the room. Harry's mind focused on it, all the while he was rubbing his thumb back and forth over the space beside Draco's spine, just wanting to hold him as close as he could.
There was a long pause after that, in which Harry sat very still, and then finally managed a somewhat strained, "oh." Thankfully, that got buried under the sound of Ron clearing his throat very loudly.
But everybody started coming to visit him anyway, would sit at his bedside, Narcissa holding his hand while he slept, or Andromeda sitting there wordlessly with him on some bad days, talking to him if he was seeming well enough for it.
their coin calls, and their nights on the Quidditch pitch and the Astronomy Tower, and the way he smiled at him, kissed him. The way they used to laugh together, and dance together. His dreams were brighter than that, but now that they're gone, he can see that they were not at all worth the grief they gave him, and they were not worth more than this. They were not worth more than Harry as he truly is.
They finally land when the fatigue lays thick on both of them, breathless and hot and comfortably, achingly tired. With their brooms set aside, they sit on the ground.
Ginny sighs. "I'm not good with this, you know. Dealing." She gives a mirthless half-laugh. "I remember after Second Year, everybody would just be looking at me all the time, trying to get me to talk. They'd be so worried. Everyone except — " She pauses, her eyes clouding slightly. She's looking away, her throat convulsing, and when she speaks, her voice breaks on his name, "
"I demand an alternative solution," Molly said, clearer and louder than the rest. "This is absurd! Surely there is another way for the curse to break."
In the evening, he tried to reach Xavier through the international firecall. He couldn't be reached. He tried to breathe through the turmoil of his emotions, to stay calm, but he ended up upending the table and rattling the bar, several bottles shattering to the ground, with the force of an erratic magic and anger. Then he breathed harder, his chest heaving, staring wild-eyed at the mess he'd made.
"You alright?" he asked, settling an arm around Hermione beside him. They'd gathered in chairs by the fireplace, after Harry had casted the cleaning charms on his face.
He touches Draco's wrists, pulls his hands onto his own mouth, warmth and life and skin. And he thinks,
"Thank you," Draco said, just as quiet. His eyes drifted slightly towards the people around them, just within hearing range.
"I hope you do," Harry said, and only then did he look at him, meaning it with all his heart. Draco lifted his head, meeting his eyes.
After the war, he thought he could never be the kind of person that children should be around, didn't think he would ever know what to do with them when he had been a child with nothing, when war had made his life so grey, but he put himself through healing, learned, and got better, and there is no better way to learn what life is about than to live as witness to such innocence and freedom.
Luna shakes her head, folding her hands at her front. "Oh, that's alright. I don't get offended very easily."
Draco didn't answer that. "What —?" He blinked, hard and fast, looking around at a room he couldn't recognise. "What happened?"
They were both quiet when they walked out of the room, Harry letting Malfoy pass through the narrow doorway first, following after him and falling into step with him as they were both led to another room by a mediwitch.
Draco didn't freeze, or pull away, or get mad the way Harry expected him to. He just stayed quiet, not looking at Harry, but he also didn't withdraw his hand, so that was a sign of hope that maybe he would be somewhat open to what Harry said.
"No. It's okay," Harry says, exhales a breath through his nose. "I think… I think I've maybe caused him more hurt than it's worth. And it can be enough. Just to have him here, with me."
"Why did you invite me really, that day?" Harry asked him, once. They were huddled together in bed again, and he was flipping through the pictures in his camera, balanced on his own chest, Draco's forehead against his cheek. Outside the window, a storm was raging, thunderous and howling, the rush of rain falling fast over rooftops and to the pavement.
"I want to say everything. Only that would be a lot of things, and I suppose that would be somewhat underwhelming, wouldn't it be? To…" He didn't finish what he was saying. His jaw worked, teeth clicking. "So I'll say it for that, right now. For cornering you in the Room of Hidden Things, making it harder to end it all."
Draco said the day before, and they are not at all what comes to Draco's mind. They come only to Harry.
With NEWTs coming up in three months, Hermione is a little more ruthless in pressuring Harry to study for them. She looks a fair bit exasperated when she catches Harry studying the Marauder's Map instead, searching for Draco before he's off to meet him, but lets him go with an insistence that he spends time studying while he's there —
When Draco's grin fades as well, slow and bemused, his eyes seem to fill back with a sort of awareness with it, some dawning sort of realisation in the confused furrow between his brows, as if he's just coming back out of a trance. As if he forgot where he was for a minute and now he's remembering again.
Draco cleared his throat. "No." He blinked, and his eyes focused, a bit deliberate. "No, it's a bit… complicated."
Draco couldn't bring himself to go through with it, in the end. Not even in his hopelessness. Not even in that overwhelming, exhausting love and grief that he had felt then. At the core of himself, it wasn't this, him, that he wanted to forget. It was how it hurt the way it did to remember him, and everything else that came with him. It was his dreams, and the way they made everything in his life lose colour in comparison, made Draco need him sickeningly. But that was not the fault of what they were born from in the first place.
Potter's eyes shift around, then, and in the split-second glimpse of his face, just as another passerby cuts by the line of vision, Draco catches his roving gaze land on him, twitching to a stop as a furrow sets in between his dark brows.
I dunno, some bloody knight in shining armour. Everybody's confused, making up some rather bonky stuff. Some are pissed at
The camera was a gift from Luna. It was silver, seemed like the latest model, and must have cost way too much. He waited after all the presents were opened to take her aside.
Harry glanced down at his hands, only just conscious of the frown on his face as the guilt sank down on him.
Harry shrugged, glancing away, mindlessly looking at the other patrons to avoid Malfoy's burning gaze.
The Burrow is warm in August, hushed in the night when the house is asleep. There is only a low hubbub of conversation that's verging on an end when Harry returns to his shared room with Ron. Ginny's passing by him out the door, her voice fading on a
"Do you know," Draco says, a while later. "That day I was going in for the obliviation, and I couldn't go through with forgetting you," Harry nods at it. "it wasn't you there that I thought of the most. I thought of you here."
On some days, Draco would come in for a drink while Harry was painting in the living room, and he would ask him about it in that same overly casual and borderline disinterested way he did. But he asked, so Harry showed him — Molly and Arthur Weasley huddled together, smiling. Fred and George. A green forest from the perspective of standing upon a hill, a shimmery blue line of a river running through the middle.
Draco huffed, a little quavering, his smile small. He shook his head. "Years. Even before the… I've wanted you so long."
Then, Draco continued, still with his head low. "Here's another secret." His throat bobbed, his voice having gone quieter. "I don't remember at all, when or how I fell in love with you."
I have the next two chapters written down for the most part, so hopefully they will not be too far behind.
For the entire silence that followed, Harry didn't look at him, too busy trying to keep that burn in his eyes behind them, blinking hard.
"So tell me your secret, whenever you're ready, and I'll tell you that it doesn't matter. Because I know you love me, and I'll always love you."
Harry pauses, biting his lower lip. "I do. A lot." There is a pause. "Do you... do you want to go out with me tonight?"
Scorpius is standing next to him, whispering something to him. Draco gently pushes him to go sit down, and Scorpius does so in the back of the class. The children's hubbub of conversation settles down after Harry's calls for silence.
Draco's breaths are shallowing in his chest as he stares at him. He blinks, finally, a quiver running through his face. He keeps himself still, but for a convulsion of his throat.
"I'd have done great as a heavy metal rockstar, you know, come on," Harry said, grinning at him grinning, just blindly wanting more of it. "Just
Harry lifts his eyes to him. "No, of course not. Why would you even — I'm in love with you." He can see the look on Draco's face. It's impassive, indecipherable, but it has a clear meaning
Their next trip was to Rome, Italy. They travelled in the morning through the Portkey Office, drove by a taxi the rest of the way to their hotel. They went to see the Trevi Fountain, full of coins thrown in the water.
Harry's heart is racing, full in his throat. He can smell the shampoo in his hair from here, floral and sweet. He lets go of Draco first, a bit quickly, but he grabs his wrist immediately after and drags him off towards the exit, Draco stumbling, following after him. "Let's go for a fly," Harry says. The warmth of Draco's body still lingers against him, and Harry releases his wrist just as they're out of the commons, warm up to his face.
"I know." Harry dipped his head, so that his forehead was against Draco's. He tugged at the button on his collar idly, one arm around his back. "I know. I'm the one that's scared."
The dream shifts to a small and closed room, a grey and dark room. A hand around his throat, around his bicep, around his body. Pale hair and paler eyes, canines and claws, and the sound of his own screaming inside his mind.
That time Malfoy, sitting behind him, had softly mumbled the answer to the question Harry was asked in Transfigurations, more to himself than to Harry, surely. Harry had felt slightly guilty for repeating it back to Professor McGonagall, when she'd nodded, sharp, and smiled at him in approval.
Maybe he is just in love with a dream now, more than anything, and Potter deserves better than somebody that can't wake up.
them. I know them only as facts, and they no longer feel any more real than mere dreams. So they have no hold over me."
Narcissa scrutinises him for a few seconds, then she leans forward to put her cup down on the table, sits back with her hands folded on her knee. Her legs are crossed, all grace and elegance. "I am deeply indebted to you, Harry, and I understand you can invoke this debt, but I see you as better than that." Harry contemplates, for a second, if he isn't more desperate than he is better. But it will be a terribly low thing to do, and if he is to find Draco, then it must be by any other means. "He's promised to owl me everyday now. I cannot jeopardize his trust and risk this availability."
Harry passed the time by making dinner, and then eating it, not having realised he'd finished until his spoon clinked against an empty plate. His mind had been stuck running through what had happened not ten minutes ago, the memory of Draco's arms around the nape of his neck, cradling his head. The warm breath of his murmur on Harry's mouth, saying,
Maybe he’d changed, Harry thought. McGonagall had mentioned that Draco was only in this mess because he denounced Voldemort and gave up all of the information he knew about the Dark Lord entirely unprompted, with no guarantee of reward. Maybe Draco is good.
Draco spends a small amount of time speaking to Scorpius over the floo, making sure the Weaslet is taking good care of him. The conversation is cut short when a rowdy black-haired boy grabs his son by the shoulders and pulls him off the couch, Draco can hear some murmurs, a loud “ it’s my dad!” and then Scorpius appears again face pink. “I’m fine, I've got to go.”
No one acknowledged Harry as he sat down… Besides Draco. Harry had glanced at Draco just in time for him to catch Draco glancing right back, the both of them looking away fast enough to give them whiplash. No one noticed this, thankfully- Harry doesn’t want to know what assumptions Petunia would make.
Draco must have noticed Harry staring, his face screws up. “ Potter, what are you looking at? I couldn’t find a hair potion anywhere which is ironic given your grandfather invented  one, how stupid.”
