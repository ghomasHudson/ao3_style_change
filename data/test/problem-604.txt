“You’re on.” she said, eyes glinting eagerly before turning back to her plate and eating with even more vigor.
if she wasn't going to get something out of it besides trauma and a scar. When she heard Ron's usual whoops as they slid down she stuffed the large round vials into a bag after corking them. She’d probably give some of the money she’d make to Ron too of course. Then she was wandering out to meet the two. Ron was brushing herself off with a grin.
And they’d all been told beforehand that she would be getting what amounted to a surgery soon to fix her declining health. She had overheard her aunt muttering things about possible magical tumors to her uncle.
now, poppet. We share not only a soul connection now, but a
not have been incredibly Dark. So Dark, even Slytherin hesitated to use it. Harry figured it was fine- she had no doubts that Morty (Voldemort, Morty, whatever) would start up some shit again. Maybe not right away, but when her scar hurt it was a pretty general marker. The murmurs in her own House (she may not spend time in the common rooms but that didn't mean she didn't have devices stuck in there to keep her updated) more than enough pointed towards his imminent come back. And well- the Ministry has made it very clear on what their thoughts were- especially with Umbridge's 'theoretical' bullshit.
“Widely accepted. You mean an entire population honestly believes a babe who was still messing herself in nappies managed to defeat some sort of genocidal tyrant?”
“You’re- leaving?
“No good? What does that mean?”
“You meant it. You have to mean it to cast those spells. You’d rather I be dead than leave you.” she looked at him, an assessing gleam in her eyes. “That’s not a good weakness to have Tom.”
“Hattie tried to get legal repercussions but there was no ‘legitimate’ proof that Helle lived with them at all. For all the legal system cares, Hattie found a bin baby. We still don’t know how long Helle had been left out for, only that she was very dangerously on the edge of starvation and organ failure. The malnutrition has been mostly seen to at least. Now, I’m not telling you all this because I can’t keep my dish shut.” Beryl turned to face the younger woman with a sharp look. “I am telling you because you are a neighbor and we’re a fairly tight knit little community here. Hattie’s more than a bit protective of Helle, and so am I and a few of our other girlfriends. I want to make sure that you don’t go accidentally setting Helle
“Of course, mother.” and she nodded absently, already totally absorbed in her work again. Sometimes he wondered if she’d been older, what it might have been like if she
“I would be most interested indeed, Ms. Mulberry. We need a date and time I suppose.” he said, a touch sourly. They were, the both of them, fairly busy people after all. It was lucky he managed to snag her for a cuppa at all. Mimosa hummed, snapping her fingers for her biweekly, very detailed schedule to poof into existence in her hand. It was in a delicate floral binder and with charmed, durable muggle paper, all of it having been typed up rather than hand or quill written. “Let’s see…There are a few days I can clear off or move to another slot. How long would you and your son be willing or able to stay, you think?”
Not all of the spells were Dark- Slytherin was a well versed man at least, even if he was a supremacist bastard. And they might have been brewing like crazy down in the Chamber- they would need some of these potions. Mostly- Harry has been brewing because she was the best at it and the Halfblood Prince's hints from the book made her make connections in her mind that helped make sense of why he changed the formula. She wouldn't say she was a genius at it or anything but she certainly knew her stuff. For fear of her Head of House mostly, but still.
“I think he’s the only one who does all my wash actually, since he’s more or less adopted me as his witch. Pretty sure he’s also the one that got me those fancy bathing oils and those scar-fading pastes for my birthday since I know he heard me talk about wanting to take better care of my skin. You know I hadn’t even known scar-fading pastes even existed? I think I’m going to start researching some health and beauty and cosmetic spells and rituals and potions and all next. I think we deserve to pamper ourselves a little.”
Exhaustion mostly, the both of them since Fawkes tears helped her own injuries though the Matron had stared at Mimoza with pursed lips. A physical examination, thankfully, wasn’t needed as the initial scans didn’t show Mimoza to have any scrapes or bruises that was in direct conflict with the rips and tears in her clothing and the dried blood beneath the dust of rubble and grime from the abandoned chamber. She rubbed at her arm absently. That didn’t mean she didn’t have a new, large starburst-shaped scar. She would be wearing long sleeves for the foreseeable future. And since Marigold didn’t remember anything, she didn’t need any Mind Healers.
“Who makes the beds?”
She was named Hesperia. Besides, having a cat around all of Marge’s dogs was just begging for an incident.
Anger flared low in her belly, rising to a fever pitch but she closed that down quickly. She would save her anger for later, when she and her friends were hidden away and practicing DADA since the pink toad was so useless. But one day...One day Ron would show them all and no one would whisper about the 'worthless Weasley'.
“Oh, trust me. My sweet cherub has nearly given me a heart attack riding around on an
She shook her head at him and he hummed in approval as he helped her slide to the edge of her cot.
“The point still stands. Don’t date a Gryffindor boy. Especially not in this year.”
There was no real fact to it but they had clearly believed in it.
personal opinion, that’s another way to deter international knowledge and the like.”
“Lady Malfoy. The current laws regarding Creatures and Beings, as you call them, are of the same nature of some of the third world countries we are affiliated with. It’s so outdated people back at the Confederation call this place backwater you know? Oh and don’t even get me started on the problems with too much reliance on magic! ‘If something goes wrong, just fix it with magic, not
“This tournament isn’t safe. I think looking around a school wouldn’t be so bad in comparison.” and he and Diggory both winced at that casual reminder.
“Another thing of note! The Pantherine class, more known as the big cats, have a peculiar shape to their jaws that allows them to roar so despite the myths, not all wild cat Felids can roar. That being said, the snow leopard while being classed in the Pantherine class cannot roar.”
. How, and in what ways he was not yet sure, but he was absolutely certain she was. The only reason he saw her now was that she had happened to be at the Minister’s secretary’s desk with the young man currently employed obviously struggling to keep his composure for some reason and looking on the verge of tears. Lucius had very kindly saw fit to lean into the discussion.
The fifth was…Not one she was ever particularly close to. She was surprised nonetheless that Andromeda was present in the same space as her sister, or with Ron and Hermione (neither of whom liked her particularly much for her decision to withhold her godson from her). Strict, rigidly in place and tinged in a constant sort of melancholy and regret.
“The Board of Governors is supposed to be anonymous.” Hermione explained patiently. “But I guess for some it’s an open secret…”
“They want the plot that Helaine had.”
“And where are you from anyways?”
would you want to do such things by
“It’s like the sky,” she said, “I like it.”
“They’re going to be terrible influences on each other.” Dean pointed out, glancing as the two lingered behind them to grab more rolls and biscuits, Ron shoving some in his bag and the girl in the pouch-pocket on her jumper. Jasper sniggered.
“Allow me to escort you to the door.” Lucius offered smoothly.
But the two
“I like the potion option.” Nev said nervously. Ron scoffed.
“You know, and I hear a lot about Durmstrang here? The silliest rumors taken for fact! That they only accept purebloods? Hah! They accept those raised in the magical world, not just purebloods since over there, those with what people here consider ‘pure’ blood adopt Muggleborn or cast out magical children. And no one around here seems to want to talk about the other school over there, for those who were raised muggle and how over there, they take into account all the differences between muggle and magical world for their students to make them much more well-rounded. Which reminds me, the muggle studies class in Hogwarts is hogwash! Ugh!
“I'm Hermione Granger- this is Neville Longbottom and that over there is Poppy...”

Love would not solve this for her. She could not forget seeing him like that, with someone else. She could not forgive it either.
“I could have sworn you wore second hand robes.”
“…” this time he couldn’t even formulate words, staring at her and feeling a strange sort of haze and then something like an out of body experience, like he was seeing himself standing there and her in the corner.
It was sometime during the holidays that Tom told her his birthday was December thirty-first.
“Thinking about harming other people isn’t calming down Tom. And if you keep making that face, it’ll stick that way.”
“How does that not faze you in the slightest?” Lavender asked, still staring somewhat unwillingly at the small girl demolishing whatever food was set in front of her. She’d never seen anyone eat like that besides Ron and even he wasn’t as…Savage.
There was no way she’d be able to tell them she could die in this ritual. Or the horrible pain she’ll go through during it. She was already weak from the Veil’s pull and her chances, while not horrible were still…
“Either way, we should get ready for class,” Neville said, not really very hungry after seeing both Ron and Jasmine eating at the same time. Just watching her made him feel full and bloated. Jasper nodded, turning his eyes again to the small girl sitting between the two.
“Haven’t the foggiest. Sure we’ll learn soon.” Jasper assured them. “Oi, c’mon! Can’t be dawdling too much,” he called back to the two who looked up and hurried along, Ron taking his place on Jasper’s right and Neville scooting so Jasper could hook Jasmine’s arm in his to keep her from trotting back to breakfast if she changed her mind. “Will you be alright then, finding your way back to your rooms or wherever?”
Speaking of which, his journals were surprisingly pleasant. And he harbored a secret affection for Helga Hufflepuff’s second cousin that was- kind of sweet? He was actually quite protective of her and the rivalries weren't really rivalries then as much as, he’d say, healthy competition. It was nice. Besides the whole 'muggles still killing witches en mass'. His fear was, if not exaggerated,
Nev and her had become friends their Second Year, after a group of older Slytherins were maliciously taunting the pudgy girl and had hexed her badly. After they'd left, Harebell had slunk out from where she'd been hiding to undo them for the crying Hufflepuff. At first, Nev didn't trust her- another Slytherin. After the second and third time she'd helped her though, they'd begun to talk rather than her just running away from the black-haired girl. Of course, they only spoke when they were alone and hidden away or after curfew.
“Sounds like something Diggory would try to say.” came the mutter.
in any legal files in the Ministry because of her ‘mudblood’ halfblood husband. Which brings attention to the awful problem of ‘blasting’ or erasure of entire existences at the flick of a Head of House’s wand and while many might consider that as a ‘family’ issue, it also creates a legal issue in that the person they erased has all their files erased as well and are essentially, nonexistent on paper. Not all cases are as extreme of course, some simply are stripped the family name or taken out of family wills, but there are always zealots more than willing to completely destroy their own blood because of perceived ‘dirty blood’. I am not, thusly, associated with the Blacks of Britain.”
to be saying all of this?”
“Nope,” she managed, “Food can’t make me sick, got a stomach of steel,” she told them bluntly before going back to the demolition of any food stuffs on her plate.
“Wow Professor Hemmer, that is simply incredible. Honestly I myself had only ever heard of the Felidae in passing and I’m sure many of our listeners under the English Ministry may not have
He was not showcasing what she thought someone who kidnapped their slain master’s killer should be. Instead, she felt awkward about seeing this apparently intimate life of the runaway Lucius Malfoy. It had to have been a few weeks since then, that first time.
Once more they were interrupted, just as Hermione Granger looked to be firing up an enthusiastic discussion on the charms affecting Hogwarts. A freckled red-haired boy blinked at them, looked at their books and made a face.
“There’s nothing wrong with it,” Lavender told him, “I think it’s sweet.” she smiled warmly and Jasper sighed. He could see the faces of his dormmates and knew there would be teasing.
“Remington!” Osmond sounded betrayed.
Infidelity warning. Is that a warning? I dunno.
“Your jealousy is showing, sister.” the Rosier boy in their year sang. “I think her small size would be useful for holding. One can sit her in their lap very comfortably I’m sure.” he said decidedly and he watched from the corner of his eye as Evans’s green eyes flicked to the boy.
Primrose didn’t care. She had stopped trying to defend the woman’s actions to herself a long time ago.
we're living, because living implies doing more than just surviving and hoping the next day might be a little better as we hunch over hoping no one decides to make us a target today! That's not
“And how did you get money?”
“I think...I think we should give it more time to think about it.” Harry eventually mumbled. “It's too big a decision to be made rashly.”
“You’re biting.” she told him plainly and he released his lip with a wince. Pearl had taught her that, to interrupt when he started biting because if he chewed enough to bleed he’d move onto his nails. “Look at my new dress!” she stepped back to twirl. It was pretty- most all of the dresses Beryl helps her make or make for her are. She was dressed up today, in an effort to blend in with Edsel’s finely groomed appearance and Pearl’s unusually dressy look. She was, usually, wearing elf ear cuffs but Pearl had quietly suggested she not do that around Edsel’s cousins. Creature and beast blood were largely frowned upon. Oh, spread thinly through the Pureblood families but never outright spoken about or flaunted. Helle’s light yellow dress was lacy and the skirt fluttered around her knees, complimented by a matching lace ribbon hair band holding back a riot of glossy black ringlets. They were cut recently, and curled now wildly around her head in what might have originally been thought to be a bob but…Well, her hair really was pretty wild. The little bee earrings she wore were a cute touch. All in all, an adorable little girl.
“I’ve made my peace and my decision professor.”
“And you read the Daily Prophet?”
If Tom had ever had any, he might call her a friend. Might.
“This is not good.”
with it and getting eaten.” he shuddered slightly. “Why couldn’t he have wanted a dog or a cat? Maybe a rabbit, those are harmless right?”
“Why,
Pearl brought him back to focus with a firm pat on the shoulder. “I’m gonna check one more round around the house.” she told him. Mostly so he would have to stay in the room with Helle. The last time they left her alone in their house, she had somehow gotten half their coop in. Within ten minutes. The point being, if he went to check over one last time, he would begin to obsess over small details. The permit for the magical expansion inside was pricey but not one he was willing to do without. Who knows how the boys would revolt if they had to share their one guest room for the whole of a week. No, instead there were three moderate sized rooms added on the main floor. It, being careful of the muggles, was only expanded on the inside using wizarding space so as not to alarm his neighbors. At least now when they left Pearl would have an actual metal working room. And he could have a dedicated potions room.
“Madam Mulberry, the young lady would like an approximate of your arrival.” a slow, cultured man’s voice answered her.
He stayed at a seedy place in Knockturn over the summer. He’d also found and met his father and grandparents. He’d killed them with little fanfare. He was…Almost disappointed with how the thing played out. It did not give him a thrill, but he was immensely satisfied to have killed that dirty muggle and those doddering old fools. The way his hands shook and how he couldn’t seem to sleep for the next day or so were just…Jitters, is all. About being caught.
At some point a man came in, she supposed it was her ‘nurse’ since he was usually the one coming in and checking on her, putting potions in her and the like when that other bustle weren’t around. He sat this time after finishing his duties and then told her, “I’m going to remove these now.”
“Wha-” she jolted upright, belatedly realizing she had been changed into a long Edwardian nightgown of chiffon with soft stretchy lace encircling low on her shoulders. The ribbon under her bust was Slytherin green; a deep sort of forest shade. She was also slightly more alarmed that she didn’t wear her regular unders but a slim shift in place of them and curled her legs up, looping her arms around her ankles to keep the skirts from potentially flashing her nemesis that had-
But he had yet to harm her. Yet to spit anything insulting and had seen to most of her basic living needs.
“Oh, and your finest school? Pah! It’s so far, utterly far behind the main magical institutions of other countries it’s just pitiful! You know, I recently looked into the current classes and extracurricular studies and there’s no world history? And no physical education, no sex education…Well, apparently the heads of house take care of that but there should be an actual factual class, not heads of houses potentially telling children different things whenever they so choose to tell their students. A nice, tidy uniform class would help, certainly. And you’ve got no exchange program! Of course, I’m not terribly surprised about this one I don’t think any of the big schools abroad would
“What, so you…You or this Bodhi person do all the cooking, the cleaning, the washing?”
Two days after that, Lucius surprised her with a dinner in the meadow. She learned that it’s been half a year rather than five months. “We won’t be moving to the other safe house.” he said quietly after they’d eaten and begun watching the stars show up. Harry would never admit she felt any sort of relief. He gave her a glass of wine; she’d been hesitant but had gradually warmed to the idea and sipped when he tipped it to her. Her arms when they went outside were still tightly bound but now they were in front of her, much more comfortably. She hated that she seemed safe enough now to allow these sorts of liberties. The wine made her feel better and Lucius had absently told her it was some rare elf wine or something. All she knew was that it was incredibly potent as he tenderly helped her stand, then scooped her into his arms when she staggered a little. It was testament to just how much she drank of that wine (the full bottle was almost gone and she was pretty sure Lucius only had a glass and a half) that she did nothing to protest. She didn’t encourage it, didn’t snuggle into him, nothing like that but she was content enough to be carried back to bed. Well maybe to the loo first but still.
She did not sit with them and even if she had tried, Tom would have made sure she knew she was unwelcome. She did not spend free time in the common rooms with him anymore, did not go to their room anymore. Did not speak to him anymore. She left for the holidays for the first time since they began schooling.
“Especially given how well known she is.”
“But us three, we'll be going for our first- will you be as well?” Hermione asked though her nose scrunched up a little as she noticed the dirt on his face.
“Lord help us.” Lucius said sympathetically. “You know, my Draco has discovered he likes brooms and flying. In the Manor.”
to those orders.
“Do you like flying?”
“That would mess with the tournament and the Ministry still has to flesh out some stuff about her,” Jasper chimed in, filling his sister’s plate again once he saw it empty.
“I think she was a muggleborn though.”
“Yes! Malmsi bringing those things right away Ms. Potter!”
Her hands and crawling up her arms was the slick blood of the beast and she cussed herself blue in the face as she pulled venom sacs closer. They were the size of beach balls and so dense and heavy that the twelve year-old almost dropped the slippery things. She set them down delicately, dumping potions over them to keep them from decaying. It was amazing that they hadn’t even begun the process and maybe it was because it was a Basilisk. The library was woefully void of much information on them and she didn’t want her order history questioned given the recent going-ons at school.
deep down.
“Hullo.” Poppy waved and the boy offered a shy wave back. “Well I hope you find your toad.” and he nodded, tearful and tremulous again.
“I suppose but it’s all the traditional dancing done here isn’t it?” she made a face. “No fun to be had. I haven’t had to go to such dull things since they tried to send me to the magical underground of Albania. Of course, they were arguably even worse than it is here. Rather, their prejudice seems to be against women, any and all women. Male sentients are fine but female? No.” she frowned darkly. “I’d never before had such
“I'm Draco Malfoy, by the way.” he said and she wondered that he waited until their conversation was over more or less to actually introduce himself. Professor Sinistra instructed her to avoid telling her last name if she could and if the boy didn't ask for it she wasn't inclined to give it. She offered her hand and he took it with a sharp grin.
She eyed her reflection again, fiddling with her long fire-ginger hair.
Aside from all of their super vitamin potions, and the ones to build tolerance to poisons and venoms, they’d been kind of working out. Nev had some trouble but it wasn’t like they were going all out like she knew the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff Quidditch teams did. It was mostly broom riding (quite a workout for the thighs, abdomen and arms and a great way to instill a sense of balance).
“Minnie?” he asked.
“Money.” she answered as though that were the only answer applicable and he found himself once more annoyed with her curtness.
“Yes?”
“Merely a correction, my dear Mr. Malfoy.” she said breezily before again pulling up his wrist. “Hm. That seems like a satisfactory amount of time here. If you’ll all excuse me, I need to regroup with the research team deployed here. Enjoy your evenings, the night is young, all that blather. Mr. Malfoy, Lady Malfoy.” she nodded to them in turn.
the way the adults
“So she’s not actually any competition?”
Blacks you know? They’d branched out and while connections may seem thin by now, they have the common history in them. Some branches have only left within the past century or two even. Of course, here it seems that families that have branched aren’t considered ‘true’ family members of the blood and that those who had branched from foreign families no matter how far back, are looked down upon. If not them, the families they came from instead. It’s very convoluted and just a headache in all.” she gave a dubious frown. “I don’t understand how one can be upset about diversity? But well, with a people as rigidly reactionary as the ones here, I suppose it’s not all that surprising. The gene pools alone here are frankly fraught with imperfections that create things like squibs. The
No, don’t think about that she chided herself. She didn’t know how long it would take to get all of the venom out, so left it with the highly charmed and reinforced bucket she
She’d been at first appalled. Why had it been in her for so long?
He forgot to breathe and gasped in, feeling like his chest was too tight to take in air or that maybe, it was mimicking her own in punishment for what he’d just done.
It wasn’t half bad, all things considered and Harry liked the way she could feel physical strength in her body. She’d always been scrawny and speedy, but now she was flexible and scrappy too. She certainly wouldn’t be going head to head with her cousin any time soon but if his string bean friend Piers tried to harass her she could break his nose or something. Well, Dudley had been pretty alright the past summer. Had apologized to her awkwardly and sort of been an ally, getting her extra bits of food and sometimes asking about her school. Not that there was much to tell. Much good anyways and she didn’t feel like remembering all the terrible things. She shook her head and scurried to the kitchens, peering at her map to make sure she was avoiding anyone. Her two only friends were waiting in the Chamber and she was fetching their food on this run. The elves seemed especially fond of her and all.
nonhumans?” came the derogative scoff.
“You’re a private person?” their mum asked with a frown. She tilted her head as she thought about it. And then Malmsi suddenly appeared.
Pearl came back down, swatting her long dark hair behind her shoulder. He smiled at his wonderful wife hopelessly. “You can put it up.”
“The very deep shortcomings of this society aside, it has a wonderful potential. Deep,
“Would a golem be able to adopt a child?”
“Yes. You know I had thought about getting my girl one but she tends to be…Well it wouldn’t work out I think. She needs something more…Interactive but something small enough that she could sneak around. I was actually thinking of getting her a lemur when she’s a bit older and more prepared to handle taking care of a small living thing.”
Not much. But enough to make him hesitate a little to speak to her much about his aspirations. He wasn’t entirely sure how to go about convincing her because his usual methods were all things that, for the most part, did not seem to affect her and he was a bit cautious of his more…Brutal methods. If he had much care, he would wince a little because she did not seem particularly accepting of violence. He could simply let her leave but it was so much easier to just keep it from her altogether. Besides, anything was better than returning to that god-awful orphanage, especially now that he was a bit older. He’d no doubts at least three people would wind up dead within the first few weeks if he were to be forced back. And he didn’t need that suspicion on him, even if they
,” she pointed now across the way opposite. “You’ll be the ones taking over this area between us right?”
“How well known a figure she is.” the woman shook her head. “Helle was a babe then wasn’t she, that’s what you said? And they made her into some sort of legendary figure? S’not right. How d’you know it wasn’t one of her parents? They died didn’t they? Who’s to say they didn’t do something before then that stopped him?”
“But we'd only have fifteen years to live if we cast it!” Nev cried.
she was most certainly not at the Dursleys, where she last remembered being and this was certainly not her cot. She frowned to herself, keeping quiet and mostly still under the wonderfully comfortable blanket as she tried to recall how she might have gotten into this bed.
“Perhaps we should set up a hammock over here. You looked like a particularly content cat, napping out here.” he smiled and she hated that it made her want to smile in return. He pushed her hair behind her ear, hand lingering on her cheek. “It looks about ready to cut again. As pretty as it is long.” he added. He had been growing more comfortable in touching her like that and making comments like that. Harry didn’t mind. Lucius was the only person she’d been around in a year and a half and she had always liked physical affection, despite that she didn’t trust most with that privilege. She didn’t trust Lucius, not one bit.
“The ritual will merge us with a parallel version of ourselves, combining our magical power and knowledge. But there is a…Very slim chance we’ll go mad from the mental strain and the physical strain of our bodies trying to accommodate an influx of new power.”
“…This is going to come back to bite us at some point.” he eventually conceded but Pearl’s bright smile and tight hug made him crack a smile.
again I can tell you that much.”
He may have also stationed snakes around Evans’s house to keep him updated until she finished packing and moved to her new place. But she was always secretive and maybe a bit paranoid.
“What was wrong with Lockhart?” Marigold frowned and Mimoza scoffed, shaking her head before scowling because that, of course, made her hair attempt to burst free from her carefully maintained plait.
sentient than is considered legally a Being here. It also means we are not obliged to treat him humanely should we capture what is left of him.”
And he eyed her for a moment before shrugging and leaving without any more fuss or even a good bye. She huffed to herself. How rude! The professor was waiting for her and had very kindly gotten her an ice-cream cone.
“...Yes?” he answered hesitantly, wondering why a few of his friends stared at him. Seamus was the one who broke the silence and it was with gut-jiggling laughter.
Draco didn’t know yet. She supposed he didn’t have to. If she kept it, she could distance herself appropriately and once it was born, send it to its father. She knew how much Lucius complained (in his own stuffy way) about having an heir by now. In fact, she might just send it to Lucius and Narcissa anyways. Draco was…Far from ready for fatherhood. She yanked her ring off mechanically. She would put it in the letter she would write; no, a note. In an envelope, but she couldn’t try to write out her feelings to him after…After a betrayal like this. She was sure she wasn’t fully grasping it yet. She wasn’t sobbing yet anyways.
She supposed she couldn’t say that she was terribly surprised that it would end this way. She leaned back and stared up at the dark clouds barely distinguishable from the night sky, watching the flashes of lightning dance. He’d strung along Parkinson for years, chased after both Greengrass sisters, flirted with girls older in school. But the war had changed everyone and he’d been so solemn and serious and devoted.
“Unfortunately. It is my sincere hope he grows out of it soon. He most recently managed to commandeer a set of my cufflinks and refuses to give them back.” he sighed and she stifled her laugh behind her hand.
“Are you competitive?”

We are not wired for it!” she hissed, more emotion on her face than he’d ever seen, hot and fiery before she forcibly cooled it. “Do you think the possibility of living so much longer, so far past everyone, or maybe even invulnerability is something exciting? Something to be yearned for? It’s not. It’s not worth it, it will never be worth it and so help me Tom,
“What will you do when we have classes?” Neville spoke up, successfully diverting attention for the moment. “And- and what about your actual school?”
And then Marigold was spitting up and coughing, waking and turning. She was still pale and shaking but she was alive and for that, Mimoza was relieved. And then before either girl could say anything, Fawkes was transporting them in a fiery show and strange distortion so unlike any sort of magical travel Mimoza had ever been subjected to. Then they were in the Headmaster’s office. She didn’t much like remembering the riot that happened after and both girls were promptly sent to the Hospital Wing.

“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron leaned forward to look at her. “Look at that, you’re smaller than Ginny!”
“Put her back on oatmeal and hot cereal for a few days. She should know better than trying to sneak treats at breakfast outside of holidays and birthdays. Lunch and dinner treats are one thing but not for the first meal of the day.”
“What?”
“Oh no no, my dear. I wasn’t planning on making another one when I went to vanquish you. I suppose my soul, or my magic had become so accustomed that a sliver just latched onto you once my physical body was destroyed. Or perhaps it was a survival method.” he mused aloud to her. His hand lingered, wrapped lightly around her thin wrist. His thumb stroked in a small circle she wasn’t sure he was aware of. He was unsettlingly warm now, instead of the room temperature he’d felt when he first touched her. “But the diary. That particular piece had only recently found its way back to me. It had been wandering between the planes for a few years in between. Pure chance that I had managed to call it back.” he told her. “I will admit it had left me…Bed-ridden. While of course Lord Voldemort had far more time, power and knowledge than the sixteen year old Tom, Lord Voldemort had also been so fractured he had gone mad. And, Tom had the benefit of having half of an entire soul. In the end of course, they managed to meld together. It didn’t end there. I have other horcruxes, other large pieces of my soul around. I absorbed most of them. Not with any regret of course.” his lips screwed up and his eyes narrowed in blatant distaste. “If that is what Albus is still trying to push onto the few youth that might happen upon knowledge of horcruxes. The entire process is simply a matter of will.” he sniffed. “Any soul piece retrieved will attempt to take over the body when returning and either absorb the other piece or meld together like my own did.”
People had used children or child-like guises against her before and she tensed up but a choked “Rosie,” immediately froze her as those two small bodies slammed against her, holding against her as small faces pressed hard into her stomach and hip. Her eyes drifted back to the door.
Her brows furrowed together, just a little. “But…The wards on Privet-”
her. He made small talk, chatted about this happening or that, little things that really told her nothing. He didn’t speak about his family either. Or where they were, or what he was doing when he wasn’t in this room with her.
His hands were shaking too hard. No, his entire body was shaking. He felt like he might collapse at any given moment. But he couldn’t do that, he needed to wake Evans. Pale, pale Evans sprawled in a mess on his bed. Pale pale Evans whose chest wasn’t moving-
, Ron? Most of our Wizarding Community is considered largely uneducated to the standards of other nations! And we, well we have all of this!” she threw her hands out at the Chamber at large “And now, even the things the other, better schools are learning as well! Do you know that Uagadou, the very largest of all the schools, their students excel so much in advanced self-transfiguration that they can change their forms entirely? Most can find their animagus forms pretty quickly into schooling as well! And, most of them learn to use their magic without wands, only through pointing and hand gestures! Not to mention their alchemy classes and astronomy classes!” she was practically vibrating in excitement at this point. “Castelobruxo students are known for their advanced Herbology and Magizoology! They have an exchange program too, for European schools-”
. His thoughtful gaze returned to her, a small frown.
“When do they stop giving food?” she asked and he snorted. Jasper glanced at the involuntary noise, shooting him a dimpled grin before his attention was once more wholly focused on the girl.
“Well you can never stop learning,” Eddie smiled. “Say, what House did you want to be in? I think I know there are some Weasleys in Gryffindor...”
(His uncles had a little fit before snidely implying it was better not to associate their name with a Muggleborn anyways. And then grandfather chewed them out about their own vapid wives. One of which hadn’t even had enough magical power to attend Hogwarts or one of the other premier magical schools but got their Nott name because she was ‘pretty and easy and Pureblooded’.)
“The library.” she said flatly because that was always enough to make her bullheaded sister back off.
She was still amazed that Fawkes had done that, still so grateful it made her want to rip her own heart out to give to the bird. She felt like that might counteract the whole thing though.
“What? What do you mean you asked an elf?”
He wasn’t wrong.
dancing, can’t forget that! Mm…Or
She left the girl to her own devices then, too afraid to speak to her directly and did her best to shelter the two children whilst mourning for her sweet darling brother.
That didn’t help at all with the rushing confusion because if she wasn’t being tortured or killed, what was she here for? It’d been made plenty clear since she was first introduced to the magical side that the Dark Lord wanted her dead. Was she…A prisoner? Kidnapped of course so obviously she was a prisoner but why? As a blow to the other side? To keep her out of the way? To gloat about how easily she’d been snatched from under their noses?
How could anyone possibly even
Later in the day, after giving the many bulldogs their scrubbing and food she went to find Marge. In the large countryside home it wasn't hard to find her- she was staring from a sunroom longingly over to Mr. Fulbuster's house.
“Just like at grandfather’s, we don’t use language like that here. That’s
his mother. She certainly did things that a few of his followers described as matronly. She was especially protective of the younger children, no matter the House. Some of his followers had even told him before to ditch her for those traits.
“Only those who aren’t affiliated with us. I’m not surprised a rumor like that started around here though. Any excuse to remain cut off and ignorant of the outside world.” she snorted. “Would you be interested in holding their playdate at my place then? There are plenty of activities provided for the families that stay in the offered lodgings if perhaps, a walk around would be an option then.”
The charms on her from before ensured she didn’t need to use the loo, besides that she hadn’t actually eaten food or drank anything rather than having them via potion put directly into her. She reached back, a bit sore and stiff from the amount of time spent lying motionless in that bed but it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. She pulled off the loose nightshirt they’d put her in, not caring when it fell to the floor in a swoosh of thick fabric and, determined, hobbled her way to the shower stall.
“You know, I...I found a lot of old books down here. Slytherin's old books.”

“Really? Why don’t we talk about it at the common room?” he asked and she stared at him and he was given the distinct impression that as always, she knew it was fake. She still nodded.

“Skittish is a bad word for this I feel.” Edsel ran a hand through golden brown hair, mussing it out of the hair-tie he had it in.
“You really don’t learn.” came the familiar voice and he tensed, whipping around to stare at the docile expression of the girl he’d known since eleven. “At this point, I suppose I should have known you wouldn’t. I don’t care about your muggle family if that’s what you think I’m talking about.”
“P-P-Potter!” she startled and Poppy was brought back to the present.
“We don’t know! No recent unfamiliar auras had been detected!”
“But you wouldn’t even be able to see them!”
“Did you really think I wouldn’t be keeping tabs on you?” she asked, cocking her head to the side and remaining where she was in the corner. She looked harmless there, small with wide pale eyes on a dainty face. Her petite feminine frame in a faded yellow summer dress. Absolutely harmless, like she herself were something that
She swatted such insecurities away. How dare this woman come here and insult their traditions and ways?
Evans could be a problem for him and his group. He resolved to keep eyes on her.
“Like what?” Ron asked, stepping closer to her friends. Harry looked around cautiously.
“The first task,” he managed. “Dragons.”
“Oh, it’s beautiful. It’ll go right above the fireplace.” Hattie took it delicately. The cloth it was embroidered into was a faint periwinkle, the blooms a mix of black, blues and purples. The stitching for her name and the date beneath it were in fine navy.

“Of course not! He’s a Kneazle and chinchilla Persian mix, from purebred parents, and costs more than your land entirely.” Osmond scoffed, demeaning and arrogant.
“How kind of you.” her smile became a bit more fetching rather than polite. “Unfortunately, it seems
And here he was. The man who killed her parents. The man who lead a civil war and terrorized the magical and muggle community alike, spouting about blood and ideals and hate. Sitting next to her, wiping away her tears and holding her.
“You did. And I was. Dead, I mean. But,” she sighed, “As always, I seem to just come right back.”
“Yes, but my criticisms of that particular government is neither here nor there.”
Wild he thought to himself suddenly and he nodded internally. That was a good way to put it. She felt, and looked, wild.
“Helle is just the cutest isn’t she?” Etta cooed, feeding her daughter the blood orange and banana smoothie she’d prepared for their brunch group. “And less scream-y than Marigold’s boys. Less of a crybaby than Cathy or Wilma’s too.”
At this, her and Eddie both shared a glance. She shrugged and so did he.
“Well I suppose I won’t argue with you. You’re sure everything has been taken care of?”

“Are you daft? What if another girl had waltzed in? What would you do then? Kill her? Torture her? And then what would you do with me Tom, had you managed that little spell there. What would you have done after cursing me to unimaginable pain, pain that would have me screaming and convulsing? Pain that would leave aftershocks in my body for days, pain that could have driven me insane if kept under for longer than a mere fifteen seconds? Do you even know the consequences, the

In some reptilian part of his brain, he realized he was panicking. He clumsily gathered her in his arms, spreading her on the bed after stumbling up and over to it, a cold sweat breaking out. For a few moments, he felt like he suddenly couldn’t hear anything but then he realized that he could hear something and that was the rush of his own blood and the hammering of his heartbeat as he stared at the corpse-

, leave him behind forever. His wand was in his hand, gripped tightly and raised at her face before he knew what he was doing, the familiar curse on his lips and a green light like her eyes speeding towards her before he’d even known he’d opened his mouth. When it struck her and she fell, he stared.
But she was going to do that, with Dumbledore acting as guardian for it. It was only a few days away but she still felt like a miserable mess. At least the Dursleys were behaving. Well, Dudley was practically waiting on her hand and foot since she’d come back and while Vernon begrudgingly thanked her (thanked her! Him! Uncle Vernon!) for not letting Dudley get his soul sucked out, her aunt was less than impressed. However, now the woman simply ignored her with her nose in the air. As though that were a punishment somehow, not having to deal with her constantly harping at her. She did however, make her soup on her worse days. So she might care somewhere deep, deep,
“Hm…Well it has been quite a long time since she was here on home soil and I do encourage her to meet and befriend those of various backgrounds. Were this to happen, where do you think it should be held?”
“You are clearly not…Able to care for them.” his father said briskly and Draco couldn’t find it in him to be upset. It was always supposed to be Rosie and he as a team,
She had scruffy black hair in two long twin braids and her robe was maybe a little bit too big for her. Her spectacles were of the current style, thin wired and round. She had a carrier case on her trunk and he could see a paw, huge and black, dip out of the grate. He had no doubts she would be a fellow Hogwarts student.
“And do what, rehaul the entire Ministry?” an older man huffed, double chins quivering in outraged offense.
“And the security! Everywhere!
She hated this Lucius Malfoy more than she hated the one she thought she knew during the war. He was human and sometimes she would forget what he was capable of. Oh, she would feel the normal aggravation and bitterness from having been kidnapped away and chained up. But she would forget just how ruthless he could be and silently snarl and snark and when she could, kick or hit him. She had also bitten him more than once, left the imprint of her teeth in his skin. He took all of it in stride, probably made easier to do given that she had been reduced to pitiful attempts like that.
When he opened the door, he stared at his parents. He hadn’t shaved. Or showered. Or cleaned. Or really, bothered with anything. Not since…
“I’m only ever called Minnie.” She told him.
“Do you like ballet then?”
For Nev, it was a few of the more involved Hufflepuffs.
“Call me Minnie,” she said absently.
“Nev?” and the blonde twitched before sighing.
This was is a lot shorter and I was really into it but I haven't really touched in a while so I'll put this in here too.
“Oh?” he slid his gaze to the man at the desk who seemed relieved to have her attentions off of him for the moment but winced at his reproachful look. “Perhaps I can prove to be of some assistance?”

“To try to find ways to counteract them. There aren’t any charms that are bulletproof, no wards that stand against bombs yet. Given the trouble brewing, I’ll imagine there are plenty interested in how to protect themselves in case of…” she paused and he pursed his lips. “An…Unwanted turn of events.”
“Like we handle all of the Dark Lords or Ladies, or nonbinary Dark Folk our affiliated states come to us about. We exterminate them and set up relief programs to victims and take over the reconstruction of a governmental body which we carefully monitor until such a time we believe them stable and educated enough to move on without immediate, constant supervision.” she answered bluntly. “Unlike a traditional governing system, we have dealt with international Dark Lord upstarts, Dark Lords that have had reign over states for decades or centuries, Dark Lords with unique magics, Dark Lords with presumed immortality or amortal Dark Lords, almost anything and everything. We have dealt with what you call Beings and Creatures uprisings, cullings, armies of cults which are almost always under a Dark Lord and all sorts of other hasty, violent shenanigans. Including muggle or squib terror cells against certain groups of magicals. It is well within our range to dismantle and oversee the extermination of Dark Lords and the like.”
“If Ms. Potter be touching both snakey faces at same time, Ms. Potter be opening door!” Malmsi explained cheerfully. He watched Jasmine step closer, then go up on her tip toes. She couldn’t reach so she instead physically climbed on the dais the statue was on and again went on the tips of her toes to touch both. She easily slipped back when the statue moved to reveal a small and slim corridor.
“I suppose I want to be in Gryffindor like them.”
“Breakfast is usually at six-”
The apothecary held her interest a bit later and she may have gotten a bit zealous in her purchases of ingredients that she, frankly, didn't know the uses for yet. And- how could she ignore a

“The spell could make us impervious to most magics and injuries.” Ron said thoughtfully, “But would cut our lives a bit short doing it, giving us only fifteen years after it's cast.”
She wouldn’t tell him that she would just explore it at night instead. She could just take a pepper-up or nap through the day.

Tom had seen and felt food insecurity before. That was the proper term for it, food insecurity. The way he knew she hid food, the way she inhaled her food so fast so there was no chance it could be taken away. It lingered in her long past Tom’s own memories of an orphanage burdened too much.
by appearing.
“The Hat suggested I might fit in any or all of the Houses, but that the one that fit me best was Slytherin. I didn’t know any better to suggest something else.” she shrugged. “It’s long since done anyhow.”
“They’re still searching for you quite heartily.” he told her easily. “They won’t find you but they are doing their damnedest to.”
“What do you mean ‘what do we do’?”
Still- practicing writing with a quill and ink pot, charmed and magical as they were, was probably the most challenging thing. And with parchment! She would naturally be bringing many notebooks and colored pens and all of that but she would need to perfect parchment and quills for actual assignments. When her cousin Dudley would sneak about and ask her about her new books (and that shiny golden pot- she didn't bother correcting him), she cheerfully told him all about the things she was studying and the boarding school she would be attending.
The envelope was kept pristine, no matter what kind of episodes he exposed it to. He was careful to preserve it. Careful to preserve the short little note that she’d had to write him. Her ring rested on a chain so heavily charmed that if he tried to go anywhere with magical detection charms, he was sure they would go haywire but he wanted to take no chances with his wife’s-…
“There there, poppet. The Ministry, the adults meant to supervise and protect the children under their guidance at Hogwarts, the zealots that insist that muggles are harmless and won’t listen to a word otherwise, the ones who looked at you, who saw you and saw that you were not well but ignored it…You don’t have to worry about any of that now.” Tom cooed, rubbing her arms soothingly. “You are

“The ‘this is mine’ stage huh?”
Marge had declined going with and had forbade Dudley so it was only Poppy and her guide. Professor Sinistra seemed a nice, competent woman though so Poppy was glad for that. Of course learning she was a witch and that her parents were witch and wizard were far more exciting. Marge had been eerily pale throughout the explanation but had hastily agreed to have her go when Sinistra began to explain the dangers of having her magic go untrained in the next few years. Even better, her parents had left a trust Vault for her and that she no doubt had more Vaults from her father's side.
“I think I'll probably be in Ravenclaw. If not, maybe Hufflepuff.” she said easily.
Her friends. Harry and Nev. The only ones who liked her for herself. Her housemates only really paid attention to her because she was a Weasley, Ginny's older sister and the twins' younger sister. She was dwarfed by her siblings, pushed to the side. Others only talked to her when they wanted something, usually something about one of her siblings, she'd learned that
“You…You know.”
She did not forget her circumstance. Only ever seeing this meadow and their rooms ensured that. Still having the pale strips where her cuffs used to be ensured that. Having had no contact but Lucius since her incarceration ensured that.
“Who says? Edsel Wright? Or Edsel
a fourth of the population here? I believe transparency is the best tactic in this situation and there’s no policy against me saying any of this from the Confederation.”
As a margay. Not kidding, she woke up with paws, no opposable thumbs and a contentness in the way she stretched. It was…An incredibly natural feeling. There was no odd feeling, so she didn’t even really comprehend that she had woken up differently at first. When she did realize, she may have flipped out a little bit and bitten her nurse’s hand but he took it all in stride and worked to calm her down. She’d already smeared her scent all over the room (and him actually), and was getting agitated at the small territory in a way but she could cope with it for now. The cot at least already smelled like her.
“Animals are definitely healthier, stronger and sturdier. Better meat even, I’d say. Think we’re all a bit healthier for it.”
“My niece at least, has gotten to the point of ‘we can share but you can’t keep it and I can take it back whenever’. Honestly I’m more concerned about the over confident ‘I know everything’ stage. I hear it happens around ages eight to ten the most. As a fairly mature woman myself, I’ve learnt long ago that there is always something I don’t know, and that there’s always room for improvement and honestly, nothing nags me more than a snotty know-it-all.”

“There is no definitive proof that your Dark Lord had been killed.”
Conflict resolution? No, we have magic, why learn that! Argh, it’s so frustrating! Even the current Headmaster has tried to address some of the issues but he’s not solely in charge of what they can and can’t teach, everything has to go through a faulty board of governors who, very likely, have no formal training or education

“Lively events, I’d say. Again, I had come from a gala held by the Swedish counterpart to your Ministry and oh, the fun to be had there! Viking reenactments, fashion displays on gorgeous dancing entertainers, an insane amount of alcohol, the incredibly modern and sometimes muggle-inspired music, oh and a full scale model of the muggle ice hotel with magical touches of course! That was something to behold, let me tell you!” she laughed in delight. “It was also much more colorful than all this! Their own primary government building was practically a work of art itself! Sleek, colorful, but also decidedly tasteful. Works of art
“A human butler? I say, don’t you have any House Elves?” a man’s chins wobbled under his impressive mustache.
“Well there you have it folks, Professor Hemmer’s small talk about the elusive Felidae.”
(If they could do something more definitive about that scar though, because it was most definitely a curse-scar and it didn’t seem like it was actually treated or diagnosed as such…)
She was crying now because talking about it had never really been an option. Having it laid out with his sympathetic voice, who said that it shouldn’t have been up to her and her friends…The adults around her brushed it off but Hermione was worried about things like trauma and what it must be doing to them, to all the students of Hogwarts when these terrible things happen each year. Pain of death corridor with dead unicorns to worry about, second year with petrifications abound, third year with the ‘crazed traitor’ Sirius Black haunting the school-

“And what are you more used to?” Narcissa asked, perhaps a hint too sharply by the flash of amusement in the woman’s eyes.
…Well.
“I don’t ask to be excused. The statistics of the British Dark Lord or equivalent rate is astronomical, as is the harsh regulation and outlawed Dark Arts. Witches and wizards are not being taught to balance out the more addictive Dark Magics, just as they are not being taught Dark Magics with good and positive outcomes. Even things like blood related rituals have been entirely banned here! This sort of harsh oppression is what helps to create terroristic threats like the most recent Dark Lord, Morty or something. Those restrictions also make preparing oneself for drawbacks to more dangerous Dark Arts and knowledge on safely using Dark Arts almost impossible to find out and those that do look for such safety measures are often seen in harsh negative connotations or even as downright sinister for being associated with Dark magic at all. It creates a bubble of uneducated people who use magic without knowing the costs or safety of it. A novice might use a costly, addictive Dark spell high above their level and it will damage the magical core as well as possibly causing breaks in the mind that could lead to anything from coma to insanity. It’s just all left behind and those who use it and turn out as coma victims or insane are used as a poster-child for any and all who use Dark magic. It’s positively
“They want Helaine’s land. They’re gonna tear down her building-” something pinched hard in her chest, “To build up their own home.” they stood silent for a while and Hattie hated how heavy it felt.

thing? Cause I’m kinda still back at that.”
“I’ll walk you to class.” she told them. Neville didn’t think it was a request or even an offer. She would and there would be no denying her but he thought he was the only one to realize it. Jasper smiled and nodded, standing and patting her head a little bit. She blinked up at him curiously before getting up, their friends doing the same. Ron complained a little, even as he continued to stubbornly eat, grabbing rolls to take along the way to class. Jasmine seemed to notice and her hands struck out with alarming speed to grab a few rolls as well and she dipped one in gravy as they were heading down the table, Ron following that example.
her smile had a cruel gleam and it was unnerving seeing so much raw emotion being displayed from a face compared before to stone on a regular basis. He’d thought she just had a face that didn’t really convey emotion. How wrong he apparently was. “It’s all I’ve ever been. Titles don’t mean anything when there’s no one to remember them.” a dark look passed over her face.
“Of course, some things are still impossible but...Well maybe we should just read some of the things right? We might find something...Something we can use.”
There was a terrible feeling in her body but it was easy to push away as she sat on the stairs leading to their door. It was the house he’d bought for her, for them both.
“I have to go back?”
I mean. If not squibs, or magically weak children it can result in insanity of some caliber, instability, unstable magical cores,
She nodded and leaned back. It started soon, the ‘tingly’ feeling. Through her numbed body it felt a little like a tickle and an itch in one, making her want to squirm to relieve it. He chuckled in good nature above her.

It felt like too short a time before she began to wake up for longer times. She was told she wasn’t allowed visitors for a little while since an unforeseen complication came up, of which they were quick to reassure her wasn’t a bad one, or related to the horcrux.

from the wizarding side. Can you imagine what will happen to that poor girl if they get ahold of her? Just the privilege of saying they’re raising her will start a bidding war of the most influential families to get their claws into her. When you think Heather Potter, it’s always with ‘The-Girl-Who-Lived’. Not as a little girl who’d been orphaned and then celebrated because of it. She’s just a little girl, Edsel.” she was pleading now. “And she’s not even Heather Potter! Her legal name is Hellebore Heath now. And…” she got a spark in her eye. “Who’s to say that they won’t try to send her back to that muggle family she was with before? What if they’re her closest kin? Even if they don’t, if they’re the ones who sent her there we surely can’t trust them to treat her like any other orphan from a magical family. There would be a full blown social scandal. We can’t do that to her, Edsel. We
“And what of her schooling? She is a student at none of our establishments.” Olympe asked with a frown, her dark eyes landing on the girl. She looked especially tiny and harmless the way she had curled up on the chair, her legs up and socked feet peeking from under her jeans and her chin on her knees. He looked back at Olypme to see concern pulling her brows together and he could see the same sort of protective concern in Fleur’s eyes. Karkaroff only seemed aggravated at the extra champion; Krum looked uncomfortable crammed in so close with everybody. Since he’d just checked them, his eyes flicked to Diggory. In typical Hufflepuff fashion, he looked just as concerned for this small slip of a girl as Olympe and Fleur.
“Yes sir.”
There was an entire separate section for healing and preemptive potions alone. Honestly, Harry wouldn't have thought that Slytherin would have been such a health nut but then again- self preservation. He was pretty serious about staying active as well, in one of his private journals he'd said Godric was getting quite the gut while he was there. In the strange, flowery terms used back in their day (she may have had to grab a translation book from the library).
“And how do you manage to stay well informed?” he asked with a frown and she shrugged noncommittally. He frowned again, anger rising and then waning. She could keep those secrets for now but he would get them at some point. Besides, she had answered his questions pretty consistently.
“Ooh a real place of honor in your den.” Maureen grinned.
“Because foreign magic is covering a curse-scar.” he offered absently, still looking around worriedly. His baby cousins would be staying. For an entire week. In this mostly muggle area. Regardless that he and his wife have a bit of land, either Beryl or Etta were all too happy to barge onto their property to invite them to a cuppa or for a chat, or for one of them to unload excess goods onto them. Maureen to a lesser extent. When he tried to beg off, grandfather gave him a stern stare over the floo call and he crumpled. With his twin uncles attending a few hearings and their mothers wandering off to some expensive resort while their respective husbands were gone, his cousins would normally go to Edsel’s father’s or grandfather’s. Unfortunately, his father was in St. Mungo’s and grandfather was busy out of the country.

“Someone will be coming here in a week or so to talk about going to a boarding school.” she told the woman. She nodded hesitantly. Poppy nodded, more to herself, before smiling and trotting off. The woman relaxed her posture after she'd left the room letting out a gust of breath. If she could send the girl off to a boarding school and away from her, she was all for it no matter the expense. Shaking herself from her stupor, she returned her gaze out towards Wallace's house. She sighed.

Not that devoted apparently, she thought as she glanced down at the ring still on her finger. He entertained the ‘muggle foolishness’ for her, taking rings. She should have known, she really should have known better. She had hoped that-

She wasn't sure how long she had sat reading while Hesperia shifted to start preening through her pigtails, but her door slid open. She looked up, as did Hesperia.
Maybe he was manipulating her- he was almost certainly doing it. Right now, she was just grateful to have someone to hold onto her, someone solid and real, telling her that it wasn’t her fault, that it shouldn’t have been on her shoulders to begin with, that it was alright to cry and be unhappy with how she’s been treated. After the lonely summer, after years of her and her friends being left to their own devices to keep them and the people around them safe and the horrible, horrible feeling of abandonment that her friends, the ones who’d been with her for years were listening to adults who had left them on their own in the first place. The horrible feelings of guilt, of fault and self-loathing that Sirius was more or less in a coma because of her and that even that was lucky because he almost slipped away into the Veil, that Remus blamed her just as much, that Cedric was dead because she had wanted to be
When Hogwarts was standing, and the required work became much more fiddly specialist magic, Harry and Hermione followed Ron to the Burrow. Molly didn’t say a word when Hermione moved into Ron’s bedroom, and Harry himself commandeered the comfiest couch near the downstairs fireplace. And everything was lovely.
They were busy, though most people were polite enough to let it be a moment for their children and leave Harry alone. He shared warm words with people he knew. He let himself be introduced to a series of awestruck eleven-year-olds, from as close as homes down the street to as far away as France and Turkey.
“Of course. And no.”
Harry felt himself bristle. “Of course I do. We all learned in fourth year, before the Yule Ball.”
It had taken a little while for Harry to go from figuring out that he was indeed
“Are you done?”
He kept thinking about that bird. Chirping away one day and the next, a broken ball of feathers and bones. It had still been warm. It seemed to Draco as if a thing that warm had to still be alive, but then, wasn’t that worse? You couldn’t wish on any living thing that it might be alive in that sort of a state. Poor fucking bird.
“But what were you doing? In the mirror?”

He hadn’t had any control either.
“But your
All of these months he had shifted between ages; inside his memories, of course, he could be as young as a year old, but when he was at Twelve Grimmauld Place in what passed for the present, he tended to range from his early twenties to his mid thirties, saving his real age for those horrifying moments of clarity when he took in some memory that had long been locked away.
He had begun to fall into a habit of working on several wands at a time, letting the wood and the core merge before it was time to return to them and discover what they were supposed to be, how they were supposed to feel.
“I’m an ex-Death Eater with an enormous ego and a family legacy of insanity and cruelty.”
Draco’s eyes flew open in shock as he read the first three or four paragraphs, twice, three times, trying to figure out if he was making the entire mess up in his head. Still asleep, perhaps. Dreaming. But according to the front page of the Daily Prophet, Harry Potter had, in full view of most senior ministry officials and of course his best friend the Minister for Magic, resigned from his job after almost 20 years of maintaining his position in the front line of the war against Dark Wizards, the potions and drugs trade, corruption, and probably lost kneazle kittens because he was so appallingly wholesome. Two nights ago; it had to have happened after yesterday’s
“Because tea fixes everything.”
“Very unlikely.” Harry laughed, and stood up. “Thank you, Headmaster. I do appreciate it. But I promise you, I don’t need a plan B. I’m doing well, you know. I have therapy, I have friends, I’m about halfway through renovating Grimmauld Place — I’m good. And I’ll be a great Auror, just you wait and see.”
Draco rolled over, with some difficulty.
They fought bitterly over the last two dumplings (a curse on whoever thought eight was a good number) and packed the leftover noodles away, knowing full well they’d be scarfing them down for breakfast in a few hours.
Julian Flint shook his head. He was about as pleasant as his older brother was, if significantly more intelligent.
He closed his eyes, and began his meditative practice.
“I stand by what I said. Dumbledore did his best by me. He knew what I had to do, and what I needed to be, and he let it all happen — he made sure it would all happen. Do you really think a Wizard as powerful as Dumbledore couldn’t have stopped me from competing the Tri-wizard Tournament?”
good care of you, Harry.”
Harry’s scent had shifted slightly, as if escaping from the dream had brought something of his usual self back to the surface.
“I really don’t want to discuss this any more, Malfoy,” he said, and tried not to enjoy the way Malfoy flinched at the name. “Are you going to return to your rooms? Madam Pomfrey would probably like to keep an eye on you in the hospital wing, if you can bear the scrutiny.”
Draco turned back to the television. How many times, Harry wondered, would Muggles re-hash the tales of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson? He wasn’t really watching, but it was a comforting sort of noise, and the sound of the rain by itself might have felt too sad right now.
“Better underwater than on dry land,” Harry said, remembering the awful screeching in his golden egg when he was trying to figure out the third clue for the Tri-Wizard Tournament.
“Draco,” Neville said kindly. “Don’t get me wrong, but… I wouldn’t call you a
The last time — the
“You are much too pleased with yourself,” he complained, with a twirl of spaghetti cooling on the end of his fork. “It’s terribly annoying, Potter.”
“I’m not sure you could do better.”
“Definitely still obsessed with me. I’m not doing anything wrong. I’m trying to live my life, and you’re not a part of it anymore. So if you could do me a favour, Potter, lift your bottom lip off the rat-piss flavoured asphalt and
Maybe that was all there was to it. They’d lost so many people, friends. Those never aged a day, never would. What right did Draco or anyone have to grow up, to recover, when Crabbe never even had a resting place?
Draco leaned forward until his forehead rested on Harry’s shoulder. He rested. He waited for Harry’s arms to encircle his shoulders, and they did. Young, and small, and then older, and stronger, and they were tangled together impossibly.
“Perhaps the Ministry doesn’t need to know I’m back just yet. Or you could tell Robards that I need some time off.”
Draco couldn’t possibly know that there was nothing the three of them didn’t share, but she nodded. Let him double up on answers. Ron would be happy to show him through the house again, as long as he was wearing this face, and not the other one.
Draco crossed his arms over his body, and Harry dropped his line of questioning. A couple of minutes later, Draco eased himself elegantly onto the wide windowsill, still looking out over the street. There was snow, of course, not real snow, but the sort that everyone wanted to see at Christmas. Settling on the window panes and crunching beneath people’s feet on the cobblestones, not dreary and grey and soaking into their boots as it melted.
Hermione turned to Parvati. “Can you wait outside, please?”
“I’m different,” he insisted. There had been such a long break in the conversation that Blaise seemed to take a moment to catch the train of thought. He shook his head, and lifted the limoncello to his lips.
Potter.”
“Morning, Harry,” Draco replied. “Do you come here often?”
“You could have anybody you wanted. Someone easy. Undamaged. Me, I’m still a mess. I have nightmares, Draco. If I’m not paying close enough attention to my emotions, which by the way are all over the shop on a good day and downright dangerous on a bad one, I spew accidental magic like a toddler. I —”
Draco sat up more slowly. “Indeed. Well, it’s clearly time for your beauty sleep, Potter. I roll out of bed looking this good every day, but you need all the help you can get.” He reached for Harry’s hand, and Harry pulled him to his feet. They walked the hallways in silence for a few minutes, until Draco needed to head downstairs towards the dungeons. And there was a moment. Harry wondered if he should offer Draco a cup of tea, or a nightcap, or…
Harry was starting to get hard.
She nodded. “So he will be…?”
Harry sat on the bench for another hour.
“I can’t see how he could forgive that,” he admitted, quietly.
Probably, almost anyone who had ever known him before the age of twenty would have imagined that his life would be full of colour and splash and ill-advised ideas, and above all, hedonism. And that had actually been the entire plan, before the war. Before he had watched how people had survived the war, or not. Draco getting dragged along with his father’s disasters, the false bravado with which he’d taken the Dark Mark. Pansy volunteering to offer Harry Potter up to the Dark Lord. The way people had fought. He’d even surprised himself. When most of Slytherin House had been marched downstairs to the dungeons he had managed to stay behind. He hadn’t really decided that he was going to take a side, and in fact, there was a part of him that was appalled that he hadn’t just accepted the offer to go and hide in the dungeons where he’d be safe, committed as he was to his own self-interest. Instead he had found himself defending a number of the younger students from the Carrows. And he’d walked out of the battle alive, and feeling genuinely proud of himself for the first time in his entire life.
Draco heard a burst of nervous laughter outside the cupboard, and frowned. He climbed to his feet, and in the spirit of experimentation stepped out of the cupboard, through the closed door. But it didn’t lead his back to the landing; he was in a hideously decorated house. At a kitchen table sat a little boy — well. Young, anyway — a tall, highly-strung woman with a hairstyle that looked like it might have been set in concrete and an immensely large man who had a napkin tucked into the top of his shirt.
Each needed handling a little differently, but they generally told him everything he needed to know about that within moments of stepping into the room. A heavy hand, a light touch, some gentle prodding or firms demands of information — they were not his patients, and he wasn’t above using his superb observational skills to make sure he got exactly what he needed out of them.
He had a hand on the collar of Harry’s shirt and felt the fabric tear as he reached behind him. Draco knew —
The nursery — which, Draco had realised very late, he himself had slept in sometimes as a child — was the room behind the door that had been drawn on in crayon, with no clear way to open it.
“I miss the way we were, Harry. I don’t know if I can do it anymore, but I’d like to try, if we can.”
“No,” Blaise replied, simply, and he moved closer to Harry. Which felt strange, but right. “But I’ve been thinking about the nature of longing. And I don’t believe you’re in love with a Draco Malfoy you met at Hogwarts and extrapolated in your head. I believe that you’re in love with Draco Malfoy exactly as he is now, with all the good he has done and all the kindness he can barely contain. And his sharp tongue, and his need to push the people he loves best.”
“This — this shouldn’t have happened,” he said. “You weren’t of age. No matter what the fucking Goblet of Fire said, you shouldn’t have been made to do this. You shouldn’t have come here or seen
“It would be nice,” Draco said at last, “to put up a tree, at least.”
“My wank fantasies never involved all this worryingly clean dirty talk.” And then he let out a needy cry, as Harry shifted far enough to lick the tip of his cock and then swirl his tongue around the head. “You fucking
“You’re a Healer,” Harry replied flatly, his voice weary and adult. "If I wake up — we’re done.”
. He was going to pay the House-elves a million Galleons to leave the mansion. He was…
“Why would I help you?”
Draco, watching him go, walked smack into a wall of history professor. A lewdly grinning wall.
“I will,” Harry replied earnestly. “Molly… if I… you’re my family. You know that, right?”
“You’re alright, Draco,” he said. “You just need some more rest.”
. Those were the only words she managed to say out loud, and they were more than enough to paint the picture.
Draco settled on his chair, expression neutral, every bit the professional, while his heart raced and his entire body felt overheated.
Blaise smirked. “I’ll make it a freebie. I’m spoken for these days,” he said.
“That door doesn’t open, Draco. It hasn’t opened for years.” Harry pulled away.
Daring, he raised a hand to press against Harry’s shoulder, and run it down over his spine. He’d lost some weight. Not as much as he might have without the stasis spells but it would be a little while before he was at fighting weight. Time. Only time, good food, exercise — the fun kind, ideally, chasing a Crup by the ocean, pointless and excessively competitive broomstick flying (preferably with a superbly skilled rival Seeker, and a practice snitch), rather than chasing Dark Wizards down dark alleys and getting hexed in the face.
“Does it really make a difference?”
Tom Riddle.
Hermione cleared her throat. “Well,” she said. “He likes to get out into the community. There has been a lot of building, of course. There are three new orphanages since the war and Harry is very passionate about that.”
“At least I was having fun, Harry,” he said. “
“I’ll bore you with the details another time.”
“Did I stutter? She can come when
“Harry,” she said, earnestly.
“There hasn’t been a Duelling Club at Hogwarts in some time. And I know why, I do.” He scratched at his hand, a nervous habit he had. “Everyone wants us to feel safe, and that’s… lovely, I suppose, but — it still seems like a good idea, to me. There might not be Death Eaters anymore, but that doesn’t mean we might not have to defend —”
She would have liked to cancel the fucking thing completely, but Robards had issued invitations and there were dozens of people already vying for seats close to where Harry Potter would be sitting. Asking for a few minutes of personal time with him. When Harry eventually reappeared from his room, with Dora perched protectively on his shoulder (an amazing shade of green which really set his eyes off nicely), Hermione launched herself into an apology which Harry apparently wasn’t interested in hearing.
Jake turned with a disbelieving smile back to his classmates, and even the nemesis looked excited.
“We’ll be back here about nine from the Burrow. Bring anyone you like.”
Harry took a breath. No one had asked him this. Not yet. He’d been dreading the moment it would happen.
“I’ll take my leave. Enjoy the first day of classes, Potter. Neville,” he added, pulling his chair back.
“— Draco’s coming,” Neville said, hiding behind his pint. “And he’s very sorry for whatever happened. So be nice.”
“And it’s not just me, either. Blaise, Nott, Bulstrode… well, if you see him,” Pansy said with a sigh. She took a scrap of parchment from the countertop and scribbled an address; sufficient for owls, anyway. “We should go. Lots to buy.”
“A terrible match for any sane woman.”
Draco was already eating his supper, a book in one hand, when Harry took his seat. He was almost too excited to eat, but he was too hungry to ignore it, and he served himself quickly.
“No matter.” Madam Shacklebolt conjured a bottle and two glasses, and once the bottle had helpfully poured itself into the two glasses they settled into place, one in Madam Shacklebolt’s large, graceful hand, with her golden fingernails and many rings, and one into Harry’s jagged hand, all sinew and scars. “One year she traveled to the countryside and met an old man who grew potion ingredients and raised injured creatures. She moved into his home as his apprentice and she has since then been counted amongst the happiest and best-fulfilled witches I have known in all my days. And my days are many more than you might guess, Harry.”
“If you have a point, please near it. I’ve lost drunk of how track I am.”
“Hope so,” Harry said, and he was gone. He found somewhere out of the way to disapparate from and went home to change his clothes, presenting himself at Ollivander’s at nine sharp. He caught sight of himself in a mirror and blushed; he looked exactly like someone who’d gotten laid the night before. Well, maybe he wouldn’t be offered any marriage proposals that day.
But Ron was staring at the board, instead of setting up again.
And Harry did.
it for personal reasons.”
“If ever you find yourself ready to talk about this, I’ll be ready to listen,” Harry said, with a shrug. “It’s your choice. I’ll let you know when dinner is in.”
Which was why, with Harry downstairs making breakfast without sausages or anything else that might be found in the larder, he stepped through the wall.
“Thestral,” Harry said quietly. Draco nodded. “Does it feel right? Try something specific.”
Poor fucking Neville ended up bearing the brunt of Draco’s ridiculous mood. Poor fucking Neville, whose life at Hogwarts in the years before Draco had arrived must have been much more peaceful than it had been since. Draco had more or less dragged him from his quarters near the greenhouse down to the Hog’s Head and shouted at him for about two hours about everything that came to mind.
He had very smoothly transitioned back to his work. He had a lot of patients, and he didn’t think he’d ever been so grateful to be so busy in his life. He had his patients. He had his students. He had — awkwardly enough — a course to teach at the nearby Muggle hospital which had been built to replace the one everyone thought was gone, now, but that was actually a hospital full of Witches and Wizards. He even had PhD students. He was busy. He was so very, very busy.
It was a sense of the dragon that told Harry what sort of a wand he was making. Long and inflexible, sanded until it felt almost like metal in his fingers. A square base of only about a centimetre, and tiny flames that Harry carved around the lower shaft over several hours. It reminded him a little of Sirius’s wand.
“And why was he asleep in his office during business hours?”
“I’m fine on my own. All I wanted was a day off.” Harry smiled, an unsure, frankly pitiful smile. “I need to get back to work now.”
“Of course,” Hermione replied. “I think you need to be.”
“Fuck’s sake, Hermione,” Draco said. “It was a
“No,” Malfoy snapped. “Don’t touch. Get some dragonhide gloves, Potter. It’s in my pocket.”
“Well,” she said. “It is a busy time of year for shoppers. Perhaps you’d like to accompany me? I may be of some assistance. Mr Black.”
“That puts a damper on things.”
“It’s alright,” Harry said, crouching in front of him, forgetting the entire clan of Weasleys were watching. He healed Draco’s hand, and repaired the strings, and though Draco looked doubtful for a moment he tried again to tune the guitar and this time the strings held.
Harry’s face was suddenly damp with tears.
“Hullo,” Harry said. He was much more beautiful awake than asleep and much more beautiful in real life than he was in his dreams. Still in his pyjamas and now also wearing the robe and slippers that Draco had left him. Hands in his pockets, slightly stiff-looking, holding himself as straight as he could.
Harry didn’t argue. He headed back to the sitting room where the youngest children were casting ‘spells’ at Teddy to ‘make’ his hair change colour. Such a good sport. Such a good child. Harry took a mug of butterbeer from Ron and sat on the couch, pulling his feet up underneath him.
Draco spent a long morning with his patients. He was grateful for the Glamour; he was beyond exhausted and beyond worried. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d slept without slipping into Harry’s head. And Harry’s health was fading.
“How did they find you? Why?”
Harry looked up from his desk. He was collecting parchments of homework into something approximating a neat pile, and wondering why so many teachers demanded long essays when it just meant there was that much more work to do.
There was one terrible thing about being back in the castle.
Mrs Anand waited a moment. She had heard the third possibility in Harry’s inflection. She tipped her head slightly. “Or?”
Sadly, Draco didn’t have a lot of confidence about that last one. Although, maybe he needed to prepare to let himself be surprised a little more often. He closed the paper, and looked at Harry’s expression on the front page. Calm. Confident. So fucking handsome that Draco’s chest ached and his cock twitched. Back to page three, and the photograph of Harry and Hermione embracing. She’d come a long way. Draco was impressed, not that he would have admitted it under threat of girl-Weasley’s famous bat-bogey hex.
Harry and Ron got two Os and four Es each.
“So there was a break in a case. Who went to fetch him? And why? Was it his case?”
He shook his head. “No. I know it sounds strange, but… I’m tired.”
Harry’s heart ached, and his head hurt.
stupid. Still, it seemed more polite than ’
“Are you going to introduce me to your friends?” Harry asked, when he was able to pull away.
Alright. He had a point. “But Harry —”
“I’m not good enough to be in your life. And I can’t be in this world without you.”
“No,” Harry said.
“Not with my mother and two dozen guests downstairs. Have you no decorum?” But Draco was smiling, teasing, and Harry looked exasperated and fond, and when Draco cupped Harry’s jaw
Ron looked disappointed; Hermione looked like she knew he was lying. To her credit, she didn’t say a word.
She nodded primly. “Sirius was your Godfather. It seems an appropriate moniker.”
They were silent for a long time.
“Good,” she said. “That’s good, Harry. I know it won’t be easy for you. But I think Draco was right, you know.”
Outside the wards, Draco kissed his mother on the cheek.
Hermione peered across the empty land. Nothing.
“Yes,” Malfoy answered, as if he couldn’t think about it for another second. “Well. Yes.” He turned to Hermione. “Ms Granger, I apologise deeply for everything that happened to you in my family home,” he said, and gave an awkward little bow. “For not doing more to try to protect you there. And for everything I said and did to you at school.”
“Not at all. I’m to be his biographer.” Draco gave her a warm smile.
Draco’s expression was difficult to interpret, but if Harry had to put a galleon on it he might have said that it was the expression of a person who knew he had no right to be hurt, but was nonetheless hurt. He had offered his hospitality. Harry would be a monster to refuse it.
Really:
“I’m a speccy Gryffindork, remember? I don’t have one.” It was getting cold. The sun had gone down, and Harry had barely noticed. “I might make some tea, if you’d like one.”
Draco hadn’t actually intended for that to be Harry’s cue to pull him in close and kiss him like that, hard and biting and insistent, getting annoyed when he couldn’t find somewhere for his fingers to get at Draco’s skin. Very satisfactory, Draco thought, as he pressed closer.
Alaric chuckled, his smile getting wider, and turned slowly and deliberately to look at where Draco’s attention had been. “Enjoy your morning?”
And then when he was about to lose his mind on a cold Saturday in December, he walked out of the Hogwarts gates and apparated at the gate to Malfoy Manor. Neville had mentioned in a deliberately off-hand way that Draco was in Dublin visiting with Pansy Parkinson, that evening. It was possible that Neville thought Harry was actually keeping an eye out for Draco. It was equally possible that he was correct.
For a moment, Draco looked panicked, and Harry could have sworn his body tensed. Well, sappy as he could be himself, he couldn’t always deal with Harry’s sap.
the privilege that being Granger’s ‘consultant’ afforded him. He spent most of the afternoon in a meeting room, interviewing Potter’s colleagues about the weeks before he’d fallen asleep, and something told him that the way the room was set up made them less inclined toward subterfuge.
Draco emerged from his room in Ron’s jeans (which Ron had decided he could keep), another of Harry’s t-shirts and the same brown cardigan he’d been wearing for three weeks now. He had deep, oily shadows under his eyes but a determination that buoyed Harry somewhat.
“I see,” Harry said, trying to sound disappointed when all he could really think about was how nice a day it was outside and how being sent home wouldn’t really be so terrible. “Alright, no problem at all. I’ll try to get an appointment at Ollivander’s —”
. We saved each other’s
“That is not what I was doing!” Draco said, giving up the pretence of the Glamour at last.
“You’ve never really talked about your…” Family was the wrong word. “Your Muggle relatives. I know they weren’t kind.”
Harry was quiet for a long time, and Draco let his eyes drift closed.
. But he’d never once allowed himself to be drawn on any details.
“No, I’m sorry. Please, Harry — that wasn’t what I wanted to talk about.” She sat up straighter. Harry looked tense, and ready to run. “I — Draco.”
“And I thought… well, I dunno where Kreacher used to live.”
“Well? Because — if I’m wrong about this, which I’m not, I’d appreciate you saying so right now. There’s a rather fetching young wizard due to join the party any minute now, and if I’m not getting into your pants at some time in the near future, I’ll set about trying to get into his.”
. Or, the room looks very
Back at the Burrow, after celebrating graduation with the Weasleys, Harry, Ron and Hermione lay on the warm grass under the fading sun.
It appeared that Persephone wasn’t going anywhere and Draco didn’t know what she was after. He fed her again, and offered her a window, and then yelped when he saw Hermione’s face in the Floo.
Harry only smiled at her.
what you just said because I don’t like it’. The Confederation is becoming impatient and if nothing changes or another war starts up, we
“Well...” Ron crossed her arms behind her head, entirely ignoring her bloody knuckles. “I'm in.”
“I was hoping for Gryffindor.” she said as she tore her eyes from the book she was reading from. Poppy didn't mind sharing her books so long as they didn't get damaged.
She sat beside him on the train and his minions surrounded them in their compartment. They did not speak to her, and she did not speak at all during the trip, as has become custom. And, as usual, when the trolley came around, she bought an alarming amount of sweets that she would devour in a shockingly short amount of time. Precisely two hours before getting to the school, she would take out the food she’d made for the trip and eat again. Then when they get into the hall and after the usual sorting, she would stuff her face even more.
“There are charms around this area to make sure they don’t or if they do, that they can’t remember it.” she told him. That said, she easily passed through the wall and he noticed a slight ripple effect like water where she went through. He took a slow breath before following.
“Riddle-” she began.
“I’m flattered.” she said though whether or not it was sarcasm or genuine, he couldn’t tell. “But being smart or being well informed or well spoken are different things.”
“A little…Wait- then you were
. That was no excuse for his bigotry but the base fear was understandable.
he felt his head and heart twist in sheer terror. His knees were threatening to give on him.
“I'll suppose you all like reading then?” he asked a bit dryly.
She hated herself for noticing it.
“My brothers,” Ron explained, “I've got five older brothers and a little sister. And we'll be in Gryffindor- me this year and my sister Gin next year.”
None of her friends would have come in without knocking or some kind of warning, even if they had thought her asleep. This was someone else.
At this she looked to Eddie to see if he had any problems. He only shrugged so she offered a grin at the girl.
“Of Britain?”
they shouldn’t have to! But if they didn’t who would!?
“I’ll make sure Helle doesn’t play around in the old flower patches if that’s what you’re worried about.”
Dumbledore nodded calmly. “No, that’s not what will be happening Igor.” he said like a professor patiently explaining to a troublesome student. Karkaroff didn’t look amused. “Ms. Potter here is not a student at any of our fine schools. However, there have been instances of similar cases happening in these tournaments before.” he said with a genial smile. “She will not be registered with any schools in this case.”
Voldemort’s soul was compared to a tumor and she couldn’t find it in her to argue.
All in all, this year was proving to be the best by far. She hadn't been sent to the Hospital Wing once so far and it was almost time for hols already. And down in the Chamber they may or may not have been practicing spells that
“Oh, Helle’s had that since Hattie adopted her. No clue how she got it, she says she can’t remember. I’ll bet it was that awful family she lived with before…It looks like a lightning flower, you know, a Lichtenberg figure, but that’s not it.” Beryl made a tsking sound as they watched the little girl gleefully but very quietly playing with the rabbits. “Right, suppose I should get all this out of the way- Hattie’s not really a talker type.” Beryl started with, “So I suppose it’s up to me as Helle’s best and favorite aunty. I’ll be blunt- we don’t know the name she was born with, or when she was born, or who she was born to. Hattie found her one day in the middle of winter huddled down in a park when she was off buying bits and pieces to upcycle for the community. Local bobbies didn’t know anything about her so Hattie decided to watch her for a few days until we found out who lost their kid. I mean, of course they’d be looking right? Well, Helle knew enough to sort of try to tell where she lived and Hattie eventually found the place but…They slammed the door in her face saying they didn’t want ‘the freak’. That’s what they called her.
“My parents were in Gryffindor.”
“Remember there is still much that I haven’t been able to talk about and we’re, as with all magical species, learning new things about them. Either way, it’s important to remember still; they aren’t simply magic folk with a few kitty characteristics. They are an entirely different species with different physiologies to us despite being genetically compatible.”
“It had been a debate for some time on whether or not to intervene. As however, that the British Ministry had been at that point, almost entirely cut off from the Confederation for some time beforehand and had not renewed their treaties, they were not considered to be affiliated with us and thus we had no reason to intervene. It was only after the supposed demise of the Dark Lord of that civil war that this Ministry reached out to us to once again open communications with us. All this to say, your own self-enforced isolation from the rest of the magical world had rendered us unable to aid. And seeing that your Dark Lord of the times had not touched the rest of Europe we could do nothing about him.”
“That- that was an accident,” he hissed.
have one. But then after a few more stops, she was getting her wand.
“It was called the Chamber of Secrets for a reason. Slytherin was a mad man but he was a genius. The spells and rituals he created are...They defy everything we know about magic. He theorized that magic had no real 'rules', that it was only constricted by what the user thought of it. That's why he was so good at wandless, silent magic, why he was so powerful.”
“Animal trouble eh? My girl luckily hasn’t been attacked by any but you know what she tried to bring home about a year ago? A raccoon. A wild, found-it-in-a-park
“Oh horribly. But I am trying to set a healthy example for my niece.”
“I think it’ll be fine,” Ginny said, looking back again at the girl, pleased that she was no longer the shortest girl in the group. “You figure she always eats like that?”
“Houses,” he corrected absently as he fixed her a plate- she wasn’t making one up herself. “Gryffindor is fire, Hufflepuff is earth, Ravenclaw is air and Slytherin is water.”
“Isn’t that more meant for those who have already graduated, or at least are adults?”

Hated having to remember them because it she did, she felt nothing but bitter rage after she had cried over it, had wallowed in questions like ‘why was it me’ and ‘what have I done to deserve this’. She didn’t want to feel those things. People were in danger every year and every year she had become the center of it. No adults would listen to her-
“Yes yes, don’t let my looks fool you. I was chosen for my expertise in troubled and warring states, usually civil wars and the like, which, according to those who have come before me, is what the English Ministry and its people are suffering from.”
getting to that.” Edsel sighed. “Boys, this is Helle Heath. She’s a local muggleborn we’re helping. She’s Theodore’s age.”
I think I'm gonna actually name chapters now. And I was thinking of adding some of the other older files too. So again, I might pick these back up sometime but as of now, anyone who wants to try their hands with one of these has my blessing all the way, go wild.
“Now now, Ms. Mulberry, I’m sure Narcissa meant no harm by it.” Lucius sent his wife a subtle, narrow gaze for a moment. Mimosa gave him an amused look.
They were all fairly mild, light shades of brown and cream, beds that Pearl transfigured because he was pants at transfiguring things. Helle was taking well to transfiguration and charms both. Then again, Helle just seemed to do absurdly well at everything she applied to.
No! No, she wasn’t dead, he just- he just needed to rouse her. Needed to wake her. How would he- how did he go about it?
“I am going to let you go Tom, on a warning. If someone dies in this school, I will not be afraid to take action to make sure no one else does.”
“Won’t…Won’t muggles see us?” he whispered and she glanced at him with those intense eyes again.
Harry nodded against Ron's shoulder, petting Nev's dirty-blonde locks. “Sounds like a plan.” without the other two, her life had been even more stressful and she'd been getting clumsy. She'd even contemplated just killing herself, drinking poison from one of Snape's private stores of potion ingredients. She was sure she could manage to get into them and be dead by the time Snape even realized someone had been snooping around. Her life became nothing without them there. Sirius was a distant presence, uncomfortable with her House and mostly focused solely on finding Pettigrew. Like he’d always been, putting his revenge first. She didn’t even really blame him that much- he was one of her father’s best friends, practically his
“Moving on, we have rooms prepared for all three of you. We won’t be expecting you to do any chores or work around here so you’ll have plenty of time for whatever it is you want to do while you’re here. You can use magic, not much and nothing too dangerous, and only in certain spots to prevent muggles from potentially seeing, but we do have the permits and deeds for it.”
He was quick to make his way to his sister’s room, ignoring anyone he was passing by and only pausing when he was in the right corridor to make sure no one was around. They didn’t need to know where she stayed or how to get in. He took a few deep breaths before swiftly gaining entrance and hurrying up the stairs, wishing they were like the ones to Dumbledore’s office that moved by themselves.
“Oh, and don’t get me started on the whole ‘House’ system and the furious segregation of students because of it! Or the horrible pigeonhole mentality that some students seem to be stuffed in! And the increasingly large violence and bullying caused by different houses or dorms is certainly no help! Healthy rivalry is one thing but they are all students at the same school, in the same classes with the same professors! It’s ridiculous!
“How is it, you think? It looks quite fanciful doesn’t it?” she asked the cat, turning her neck this way and that. His tail thumped against the bed, blinking at her slowly. She rolled her eyes before copying that slow blink, waving him off before sitting cross legged on the floor again. She plucked open Ron's gift, snorting at the candy she found but raising her eyebrows at the Cauldron Cakes. How on earth did she get those alcoholic treats? She shrugged, pulling one out.
charmed he was by this harlot! She pursed her lips and kept cool. “It’s certainly a nice, fun relief for pent up energy at least.”
“Indeed, Mr. Quirrell. This is Professor Quirrell, the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.” she introduced, waving her hand towards the man.
was loony. London is just different.”
When Jasper next found his sister, he and his friends were by the Great Hall entrance. She was surrounded by Hufflepuffs and The Hufflepuff. Cedric Diggory was talking with her animatedly and she listened compliantly. Jasper was quick to push himself over to his sister, not liking the way they were surrounding her.
Albus Dumbledore was in a flutter. Flustered, befuddled, flabbergasted, unsettled and all manner of other words one might pluck from a thesaurus.  He’d gotten word that for the past three days, his pupil’s supposedly secure room had been hijacked by another patient and that no one had been able to get in. He wondered again why they hadn’t thought to contact him immediately as he waited for Minerva to respond to his note asking her to see to the ward masters that would come in to update and replenish the wards as they did every summer. This was a personal matter, rare as he took those over his more professional work.
Grumbling, then a thump as feet hit the floor, the sound of rustling as she put slippers on and grabbed a thick robe to ward off the chills she would feel once they left the common room. Quiet shuffling after he grabbed her arm to lead her urgently through the dorm, through the common room and then to the second floor.
“Jasmine!” he called as he almost reached the top, panting as he watched his sister set down a saucer and look over. She had her glasses on instead of those muggle contacts; learning her eyesight was as bad as his and his dad’s was both funny and a little worrying. Learning how one put in these muggle contacts was also kind of worrying but she seemed well versed in it at any rate. Her eyeglasses were dainty rimless pince-nez types. But those weren’t thoughts for now.
The other two, Lucius with the graceful curls of cool magical core twisting now almost nervously, and Narcissa’s creeping soft mist like core thickening in a fog with emotion.
“And…Has anyone been…Eating the produce that she affects?”
She would
“Still.” she answered easily and he looked about. The house hadn’t changed much in the years, though a few photos from school managed to find their way into the kitchen. A few of him (surrounded and with his usual perfect smile and carefully groomed appearance), and a few of her. Some girl in another house had taken to her, some mudblood who’d decided Evans made a wonderful model. One of her standing out by the lake with her braid flying with her usual solemn expression. One of her sitting in the Great Hall, fork halfway to her mouth from an overfull plate, him beside her and glaring in the direction of that damnable mudblood. Another of her at Astronomy Tower with only a dim lumos lighting her.
He was distracting himself. He knew he was doing it but he was going to stress about it either way and if he isn’t careful he’ll start gnawing on his lip.
“She doesn’t belong here with

Or better, have an automatic class or sort of, group of muggle guardians attend something to teach them the differences so their children aren’t horribly alienated and understand the dangers with magic and untrained magic.
side effect.” she looked at them sharply. “The only downside is that it would take a few days to complete, which is fine if we do it during the hols.” she argued.

just stupid worthless muggles. A plate was settled in front of him and he was broken from his reverie.
“If you don’t calm down Tom, I’ll be forced to use drastic measures.”
She wondered if they’d even thought Mimoza would need it, even if it did go as they thought. She would have been kidnapped and attacked by a Basilisk and wouldn’t that need counseling surely? She was glad she didn’t need it, who knows what they’d find in her head after all but
Mimosa Potter was at her aunt’s place as always. And, as had become custom, would be picked up sometime through the summer. She still didn’t understand why she couldn’t have stayed at Grimmauld Place, even if Sirius was in St. Mungo’s. She winced at the thought and memory of how he ended up there. On the brighter side, Voldemort had fallen (she may have shoved him but really, who was watching in all the commotion anyways) into the Veil. It had almost been Sirius going through that Veil and she shuddered again. Better still, Sirius finally got a real and proper trial after much fuss was kicked up by her, Dumbledore and a few choice others who were made aware that Sirius had no trial for his imprisonment. This trial wasn’t happening yet, as he’d had to go straight to St. Mungo’s over some grievous wounds from the crazy fucking cunt Bellatrix.
“Near most all magical communities do in some capacity.
her fault. It hadn’t happened. Not after Quirrell had died, not after she had made it out of the Chamber shaky and barely walking despite the Phoenix tears, not after the Dementors forced her to hear her own mother begging for her life or when they were almost slaughtered by Moony, not after coming back from the graveyard or when she was saved from Crouch, and not after she came back dripping with blood because of writing on her hand. Never an adult, only her friends to cocoon her. She didn’t have parents to fuss over her, she didn’t have a family she could cry to or ask for help from, she couldn’t trust the adults around her as had been proven year after year.
She glanced covertly at Ron- she sat near her fellow housemates at least, though she wasn't really included. Harebell had met her on the train in First Year, but they hadn't become friends until her Second Year when she'd been possessed and dragged down to the Chamber of Secrets while people were petrified. Harry had gone down to the Chamber, following the voices in the wall. The two of them almost died down there, and they told no one but Nev about it. Not even the Headmaster but he already knew when he awarded more points to Slytherin, granting them the flag again that year and the very vague letters he sent to them.
They spent most of their time together and Tom was quickly becoming a class favorite with his smiles and natural good looks, politeness and academic initiative. Evans was also one of the top of classes but she wasn’t as sociable or approachable as Tom. Most of the time, she actually seemed bored or maybe even a little exasperated with the material. Tom could somewhat understand; he’d been reading ahead for quite sometime as well. People were beginning to approach him a bit more easily by the winter hols but as far as Tom knew, Evans was mostly unapproachable.
“What do you mean?”
“I do. No point in wasting money when I don’t yet have a way to replenish it.”
“Because I do; when, that is, I’m home.”
“You know where the dorms are?” Neville asked.
knew it was her fault too. He avoided her and she’d seen the cold look on his face the first time she’d turned to him before she was left at Privet Drive and the way he avoided her.
“Of course they do, why d’you think it’s considered the standard?” some cog-in-the-wheel employee snorted.
“I’m afraid so Tom. No student is allowed to stay over the summer holidays.” Dumbledore told him and Tom felt rage like nothing else boil in his gut. “This is not to say that you must return to the orphanage. If perhaps, there was another place.” he said and Tom looked up at him sharply to ask what in bloody hell he was talking about but the man was looking to his doorway. Tom swirled around to see and saw Evans there, as stoic as usual.
“You have such a natural charisma, Tom, such natural leadership skills. And you chose genocide as your cause. Genocide and terrorism.” she sighed, crossing her arms. Tom was getting especially agitated at the way she was affecting him. “I’m not entirely surprised you let their bigotry seep into you. You’d always wanted to belong to something.”
“If you kill, Tom,” she said suddenly in the quiet and he paused. He had been very, very careful not to let her know about just how far he was willing to hurt someone, nor about how deep his hatred ran for mudbloods. “If you kill another person, your soul fractures. If left alone it will heal itself, but it will be scarred. And killing someone is a stain on the human psyche. It will never come out.” she told him and he sneered a bit. Who was she to begin spouting these noble, Dumble-esque words at him? She was nobody without him! When he had realized he’d more or less screamed that at her, it only made him even angrier. His fine control slipping over her stupid Gryffindor sounding words. As always, she remained unaffected. She was not frightened of him and that only incensed him more because she
“Christmas gift?”
Ron's face was grim as she and Nev helped Harry bandage the lines written into her skin down in the Chamber of Secrets. Once the diary was dead and done, the girls began using it as a safe haven. This was after making sure there was a safe path into it, after that cave-in in Second. Hah, Nev thought to herself. The place that almost

“We've got four feasible options. The potion, the spell, the ritual...Or death.” Harry said solemnly.

“I like most any form of interesting dance. Ballet- usually neoclassical, raks sharki, bhangra was

called fiendishly difficult you know.”
“Yes, Madam Mulberry. That is all.”
“Come in,” the Headmaster called cheerily but it sounded a little strained. The door opened and Jasper watched as Olympe and Karkaroff came in, their champions behind them. Right after came Diggory. Well that’s just
“He’s not an oddball.”
Self-loathing, prepared to lash at itself. That sort of magical instability was dangerous and while she refused to look at him, she forced the quiet message to have him examined properly to the Mediwizard. His head tilted forward slightly in compliance. She could question things if she needed to later.

influence! Love potions and lust potions are sold willy-nilly, with virtually no regulation besides a few fines of the more hardhitting ones despite the numerous rape and sexual assaults filed within the past decade! Do you have any idea how many there are? And memory modification, there’s no immediate, easy way to discern besides a professional evaluation or god forbid, just someone with
“And what about these other dorms?”
“It’s a wonder his boy is such a delight. Likely his mother.” came the answer.
“What do you mean someone’s taken her wards down?! How did someone not authorized even get in?!” a furious, frazzled Director hissed. There were five units in this facility and each had its own Director, who worked solely under the owners of the entire establishment, a small group of distinguished medical professionals. And no one in his department was allowed to go into the patients’ rooms without at least two other people, which meant whenever a staff member visited and checked on their patient there were at least three in the room besides the patient for safety and legal reasons.
“Because it…Doesn’t?” he asked more than said, looking at his sister while she ate. She didn’t talk with her mouth full and her mouth was closed for all of the five seconds it took her to chew and swallow. It wasn’t unsightly, no food sprayed anywhere and all of the food went strictly in her mouth, none on her face. He shrugged.
“You’re mine!”
She was in lilac colored coveralls and her long sleeved shirt was gray. A cloth headband kept her curls out of her face.
“Well there’s speculation but the widely accepted tale is that little Heather Potter vanquished the Dark Lord.”
“Check the patients! NOW!”
“The Knights of Walpurgis-”
“This is goodbye, Lord Voldemort.” she said plainly and when he stared at her face, there was something about it that made a sudden and fierce terror, frantic and fire-wild, well up from somewhere in his gut that made him want to vomit.
“Tom. Why are we going into the girl’s bathroom?”
She hated that she was dependent on him so much. That she saw him not as Lord Malfoy, Voldemort’s Death Eater lap dog but as Lucius and part of her was still hissing that it was a trick but she didn’t want to believe his seeming concern was. She still didn’t know why she was here. Why she was still alive. Maybe they realized she can’t quite manage to die properly and instead plan on having her isolated until she dies naturally? But Lucius would likely be gone by the time she were to die and who would keep her captive then?
“I don’t mean to sound rude, but that scar…” Pearl frowned worriedly, glancing again at the girl.
The return to Hogwarts was just as bland as the first trip but now there was more to learn and this year they got to watch the first years being sorted. He watched when Evans paused in front of the carriages, staring at thin air and then waving her hand about a little in a strange way. When asked what she was doing, she looked to him and shrugged. He didn’t bother questioning her eccentricities.
. The movements are so fluid and graceful.” she sighed, eyes shutting.
Her Grandmother allowing it all and only paying attention to her when she absolutely had to.
Summer with Evans was…Educational. Mostly in that she had a delicious amount of books at her disposal and he sometimes got to watch her as she balanced her money. He still didn’t quite understand all of it but he consoled himself that he would learn it more thoroughly with time. She didn’t talk very much if he didn’t instigate it, but this was something he’d noticed at school as well. Their food was cooked by Evans, and while he wouldn’t say it was as good as the Hogwarts food it was certainly some of the most delicious things he’d ever gotten to eat in his life so far. Their letters came, they went shopping for school supplies and they packed up for Hogwarts. Evans made them snacks for the long train ride.
“Just the patrols. Probably haven’t gotten word yet, don’t worry.” he paused a moment to cast a quick spell at the door to silence it before snatching down the last few baubles. “There we are, now let’s see about the rest of them shall we?”
“Don’t mind his oglin’,” came the next voice, heavy with the Irish brogue. “Name’s Seamus Finnegan, doll.” he winked and Jasper revised that he would have to viciously prank them both as a warning.
“That’s so rude Ronald!” Hermione went on and the boy rolled his eyes, already aggravated. “You shouldn’t make fun of someone else’s looks! Especially when you’ve got dirt on your face!”
it in how each dangerous event had played out,
“…Pearly-Pearl.”
“No, no. It’s fine.” she insisted. She had really beautiful hair, and the hair clip at the back with its fanciful woven metal was an anniversary gift last year. She held out her hands for Helle and the girl took them dutifully. “Alright Helle. We are the current ambassadors for muggleborns and how to behave around muggles for the next week. We may even have to help them pick their clothes to make sure they don’t wear something bizarre.” Pearl said seriously, eliciting a giggle.
“Well...Cheers,” she nodded to her cat before biting into it. And coughing, her face screwing up at the strong taste souring her mouth and then burning her throat. She spluttered, hitting her chest. “Well,” she choked as smoke billowed from her mouth, nose and ears, “I guess I know why they call it fire whiskey now. Bloody hell,” before staring down at the rest of the chocolate and magical whiskey concoction. She stared at it for a few moments more before shoving the rest of it in her mouth, trying to chew and swallow as fast as she could. Getting sloshed on her sixteenth birthday sounded like a good enough plan to her.
“In case of what? And anyhow, how did you get those transcribes and the like?”
“Well, I'll be seeing you in Hogwarts then, er...”
“Yes. That is exactly what we mean.” Edsel frowned. “There are certain circles who believe that the father did something- a blood ritual learned from his mother’s books that expelled the Dark Lord but it’s not the type of thing to be spoken about with just anyone.”
for it.
A tiny hand gripped at his trousers- freshly pressed along with his button up.
“Does that mean you’ll try to outdo the other champions?” he asked and from the corner of his eye, watched his parents flinch at the reminder. She hummed and plopped herself in a pretty claw-foot chaise. He sat on a loveseat and their parents moved to a sofa.
And what about how it would change us? We wouldn't be the same!”
“…Yes, mother.”
“Is that it?” Sprout asked.
“There is always dancing available.” one woman said.
Hi, it's me again.

“Not really sure, but his father’s on the Board of Governors- oh! Wait, you didn’t hear that from me!”
“That…That sounds awful.” he said.
What a contrary woman.
, poised to potentially kill her or Ron under Voldemort had he not been found out! Fourth year-
A sudden, pleasant chime like tinkle sounded and she paused, pulling a stylish mirror compact from her small clutch to open. “Mimosa Mulberry speaking.”
“The International Confederation?” Narcissa parroted, startled. This slip of a woman, with a sort of exuberance about her, was an ambassador for the International Confederation? The last few, as Narcissa recalled, had been sour, sullen people who didn’t care for their forms of etiquette nor their ‘conservative’ mindsets.
and no one noticed. Even after, nobody noticed anything different aside from her siblings asking where she'd been.
It was beyond concerning of course, and there would likely be a sweep or two quietly happening while she tried to talk sense into these stubborn prats.
“I met him when I was getting my school robes. Honestly he seemed a little annoying but I didn’t really talk to him that much. Name’s Draco Malfoy.”
Tom had more than once and very politely asked the mudblood to stop, had even arranged a few accidental hexes whenever the stupid chit had her camera out. It did not deter the girl, not at all and Tom would have to do something drastic soon. Perhaps if he could finally find the Chamber…
“If that’s a challenge, I’ll take it.” she answered, leaning forward a little to stare at him and he looked right back.
That was good at least, she'd gotten used to living a fairly comfortable life even if she didn't get expensive presents and snacks like Dudley. She did have access to the study and thus books Marge kept and a large room all to herself that she got to decorate as she liked. And her own rather posh clothing, unlike when she lived with her own maternal Aunt and her husband. Walking through a dirty, rowdy pub called The Leaky Cauldron had her shift just a bit closer to the Professor who seemed thoroughly unimpressed by their current surroundings. The tall woman ignored the calls and Poppy stuck close to her, brushing down her bangs like the woman had told her to before they went in. It was only towards the exit that she stopped, and for a tall reedy looking man in a purple turban.
“I don’t see why I should have people prying into my life.” she said and cut him from his musings. He blinked at her.
“In five minutes.” he told her and she paused before shoveling huge amounts of food onto her utensils and viciously clearing her plate one last time before pushing it away. Neville was surprised she didn’t lick it clean but then chided himself for thinking that.
“She had recovered since.” her lips were pursed as she pulled out an envelope to him. He snatched it from her hands, greedy eyes unblinking as they took in her writing. He didn’t bother trying to actually read it for a moment; just to look at it. But he did, of course, read it. It was…It wasn’t cold, but it was clinical. Distant on purpose. It said bluntly that where she was, was far too dangerous and her mission too consuming for her to take care of them. And that she, bluntly, didn’t want to look at them.
“He collected a huge amount of beasts and documented most of them- Jorge di Giovanni.”

“Oh god,” he whispered, “I hit my head going down and I died.” he immediately rationalized. Her brows went up at him and for a few moments all he could feel was complete and utter gratitude to see her moving.
Deciding between a bird or cat was more difficult than she thought it would be but she was immediately drawn to a pretty white owl- there were no bars on her pure white feathers and intelligent amber eyes glowed at her.

“Not at all, dearie!” Beryl waved off cheerfully. “I absolutely
She nodded a little, or at least she hoped so. She was drugged up on so many potions and tranquilizing spells and charms she couldn’t really move all that much. Through her blurry vision, she thought he might have smiled before he reached for her. She slipped into half-sleep, that she was still vaguely aware but mostly sleeping so she probably wasn’t reliable enough to tell what exactly happened next.
“Mr. Bodhi is a Confederation-approved butler and competent caretaker when I am not there to oversee my niece.”
“Wait, twenty-eight? I though there were only eleven big schools?” Nev frowned worriedly.

“Dedication, hard work, fair play, patience, kindness, tolerance and loyalty.” Hermione immediately recited. “That does sound like a nice House to be in.” she smiled at the other girl, her overbite showing. “Their dorms are in the basement- Slytherin is in the dungeons and the Gryffindors and Ravenclaws have towers.”
“Like a muggle university, yes, but who cares about that? We’re already learning far beyond this year or next year anyways, why not add these? Never know when you might need them.”
“Consider it a birthday present- though don't expect anything beyond this. I
“She’s been draining her magic? Into…Into plants?”
Harebell had included the other girl in her and Nev's meetings and she had insisted they call her Ron, just as Harebell had told them that she was just Harry. Her eyes flickered back to the professor. The class would be over soon and then they would be moving to double Potions. She wasn't looking forward to seeing her Head of House. Cringed at the very thought of it. The man didn't like her;
“That’s different!” he bellowed at her furiously.
“Given that she and me certainly can’t eat it all ourselves, we share in the community, and use it for feed for the animals.”
Harry was plagued with horrible nightmares for the next few weeks, until she began to really practice some of the Occlumency tips from Slytherin's books. The harder she studied and learned, the less she suffered the strange visions. She began to spend her nights in the Chamber, scouring the books until the wee mornings and simply telling Dobby to secretly put awakening potion in her morning drink, then something else after there were concerns about the side effects that would pop up when used too much. She was going in a frenzy in her days, caring less and less about her peers and her professors. Ron was sucked into it too when Harry lent her the Invisibility Cloak and then Nev joined them. More and more, the girls would disappear for hours on end, not just in the deep cover of night but any free time they had. Harry went entirely unquestioned.
“Yes Professor Umbridge.” she intoned quietly, gathering her things and moving and deftly dodging the shoulders meant to hit her or the legs out to trip her. She was nimble and deft and knew well how to avoid so much as touching anyone in the crowded halls. She'd sewn runes into her robes to help deflect the hexes and curses that would sometimes find her.
to be driven insane by that spell. And if they aren’t driven insane, they might feel phantom pains, might lose their sense of feeling in some of their nerves. And they will have gone through the worst pain a human being can feel. Worse than dying. But that doesn’t matter to you, does it

“Dinner?” she asked and he nodded. He was utterly famished. Perhaps being away from the orphanage and with regular meals, he’d gotten a bit spoiled. In Hogwarts, even if he skipped a mealtime one of his followers or more likely, Evans, would bring him food. And here, in the summers, she’d made it more or less a rule to eat three times a day. She set down her muggle pen, pushing from her place and setting to dinner. In the meantime, he glanced at the papers she’d been looking over. She had been steadily paying for a small manor in a more magical area rather than this purely muggle one since the end of Third Year and by the end of this year, their fifth, it would be hers completely. She had become very cautious, especially with the war. They even had a bomb shelter built in the basement. He knew she never wanted to test it. Over the last few years, Tom had managed to learn a bit more about his partner.

Andromeda Tonks stared at the paper somewhat incredulously. Her cousin, Sirius Black, was on the front page- and even more, claimed innocent! She tapped her nails against the table in agitation as she read; not giving any sort of trial had been a hushed Ministry practice immediately after the war was ended but most of those it happened to were either die-hard followers or particularly active sympathizers who readily admitted to their guilt. The increasingly wild story The Prophet spun made her stomach churn and she wondered how much of it was true. Quickly after shaking that thought, she quickly moved to the fireplace; Sirius, despite what an utter brat he’d always been, had been her favorite cousin if only for the fact that most of their shared family seemed to loathe him and how he was perfectly happy to turn his back to them.
Tom melted into the shadows, observing the scene he’d suddenly found himself intruding. There were three groaning boys, older than him, on the ground. In the scant lighting he was barely able to see that they were a bit smattered with blood. One about the nose, another at a bloody mouth and the third at both. His eyes strained when a movement caught his attention and he was quick to cast a lumos and step forward as menacingly as he could. A familiar if bloodied face looked back at him with all of her usual nonchalance. As though her eye weren’t swelling shut, her nose weren’t broken and she didn’t have a forming bruise taking up an entire half of her face.
Her condition sometimes did that. He steadied her easily and they trotted off and that was that.
“Which brings me to another point; in most of the magazines and popular publications, very little say anything about outside cultures and peoples. It’s a very narrow scope and it’s quite concerning that it’s so isolated here that the people probably don’t know about the world outside of Great Britain and Ireland. I believe it’s in part due to again, education at Hogwarts and other smaller schools. There’s no world history classes, no humanities, and no language arts either. Anything mentioned is because of a correlation with Britain or some part of Britain.” she frowned. “And even outside of the horrible ghost-professor History offered in Hogwarts, which is supposed to be the premier school for Britain as a whole need I remind you, in the smaller schools it seems only local histories are talked about, not even national history.”
Probably has no clue what a latte is either!” frankly, Naricssa had no clue either but she would never admit to being ignorant on anything. “Even worse, none of the employees I’ve so far dealt with, not even Aurors or the Ministry security that weren’t Muggleborn and sometimes even then, know what a
“I suppose I'm not against it.” and Harry’s bright smile was worth it, so very seldom seen.
“It’s a bloody dragon!” he snapped back, “She wasn’t supposed to even be

“You know,” a woman began neutrally. “There are still some that would
“Practically a bloke!” the other twin sniggered and she scowled, shoving him back to stalk off.
And then they were being dismissed.
With Rosie’s ring. He…He made a mistake. But once she returned from that mission he would- he would do better. He learned his lesson. He would never touch another woman again.
“Horcruxes. A dark ritual.” he purred. “A little death to fracture the soul and then voila! The fractured part becomes an anchor to the living plane.”
“She likes animals. We

will be…Caring for them at some points. You of course, shall be seeing them often.” his father’s voice made sure that it was a command. “She wants you in their lives. She wants you to be their father.” and his cutting gaze let Draco know very clearly, that his own father had very clear opinions on Draco’s ability to be that.
. And, if they
“What an aesthetic pair.” she said then, quite bluntly and Narcissa blinked a bit. Of course, the underlying thought was obviously of their respective coloring, both pale blondes of some height with pale eyes to match. Not many so plainly said it, even if it was a fairly quick conclusion to make when seeing her and her husband. “Although I don’t envy your complexions much.” she added on a bit mischievously.
“The Minister of course.” she waved off flippantly. “Cornelius has been very…Ah, incompetent seems a tad harsh but it was the word used when I was sent to confront him. Oh, pardon me! I’ll be Mimosa Mulberry.”
“Oliver, Osmond, Theodore. You’ve all met Pearl of course.”
“Yeah, even at meal times!”
Then she threw herself on the bed to more easily stretch and hear all of the satisfying cracks she could as she bent in whatever positions she was able to stretch herself. So pleased to have this mobility, she didn’t even think about how she might appear. She still was never given underthings and the usual flowy sleep gowns were awfully thin. And so distracted by this new freedom, she did not see the way Lucius watched her.
“Just because she can outpace me,” Ron spoke up, mouth full of food, “Don’t mean she can eat more.”
More importantly, Harry found herself absolutely fascinated by the Halfblood Prince and wondering idly who he was. Well it didn't much matter, he'd probably long since graduated. DADA wasn't as awful as she'd feared and he thankfully seemed to ignore her for the most part, focusing most of his vitriol on the Gryffindors. It didn't mean he still didn't treat her as an absolute waste of human skin.
“We could end up bonkers!”
“You’re going to set recording devices about without alerting the staff?”
. What a way to find a long lost sister. Daughter, he thought as he glanced again at his parents. They looked like they would break into tears any moment now and he cringed a little. Just a little.
“Do you have any funds?” she asked in return. “I’d think not. The only purpose of this golem is to keep adults and bobbies away, and sign for anything I can’t.”
“A fax machine. They transfer papers fairly instantly. It was adapted from the muggle construct of the same name.” she waved off easily. Narcissa felt her face screw up, just a little bit, before she could stop it. “Ah. Right. The vicious aversion to any sort of progressive technology that,
“In peculiar cases like this one.” Ludo Bagman shrugged easily. “It has happened before. Which is to say, she can earn points all she wants but in the end only one of the enrolled students can actually win the title. Nevertheless, if her points somehow exceeds her opponents then she’ll be getting half as many galleons as the actual winner.”
“Oh yes, everything is fine. I don't get into trouble or anything, she's just a bit...Harsh is all.” she waved off, hoping the older girl would just bugger off. Feeling compelled to be nice no matter what as a Hufflepuff with no other

“Albania, you say? I do remember Lord Yaxley saying something about the people he’d been meeting there had been incredibly disrespectful to his wife.” Lucius said thoughtfully.
Oliver, Osmond and Theodore had never been to his and Pearl’s home. Mostly because he lived in a mostly muggle area, with only a handful of squibs in the community here. Partly because his uncles disdained Pearl’s Muggleborn status but wouldn’t actually say it for fear of grandfather’s wrath. Grandfather didn’t have much care about blood no matter what crowd he tended to, but more about power.
“There is always Malfoy Manor, though I’m afraid Draco might get a touch finicky if your niece were to touch his toys. He’s awfully possessive of them.”
“Hattie, please-”
And that last sentence felt like what he imagined getting hit by a train might feel like. The air rushed from his lungs, his body went tense and he felt like all of his muscles were forcibly contracting. He felt blindsided.

“Hm…I’ll be sure to let the others know, don’t want our neighbors uncomfortable.” Beryl nodded to herself, idly stroking her prettily painted nails through Helle’s chaotic mass of glassy black ringlets. She had to be careful of how she did it, or her fingers would tangle. Beryl would swear the girl’s hair had a mind its own, half out of the French braid she’d put it in earlier. “If you’ve got the time, how about a cuppa? It’s about time for a break from wrangling the rabbits anyhow.”

slipped out incredulously before she could censor herself. He seemed strangely pleased with her reaction.
And regardless if he wasn’t the same, there was still the matter of his Death Eaters and followers and what they did and stood for. Not to say she’ll forget that it was Voldemort who really catapulted them into what they were and how he ruined everything but still.
Draco was sure that he could convince her otherwise when she came home. One look at her own children and she wouldn’t be able to resist.
though.”
hat flopped down over her eyes, he waited. The previous students only took a few moments but soon enough he found this was not the case with Evans. He began keeping track of the time she took and had gotten to four entire minutes (ignoring the murmuring that had begun) before the hat finally called out.
again anyways. Lucius hissed derogatives under his breath. Not at her as he stroked over her face gently, through her hair and down her back as he held her in a loose but notably protective hug.
“She must get back into bed.” came the gentle words and the two didn’t detach but instead moved with her towards the cot.
“I'm sick of this.” she growled, low and guttural.
“I don’t muck about with things like magic and whatnot but I’m certainly not going to stop her or tell her not to.” the woman gave the young couple a reproachful look. “If she gets too antsy and it builds up, she can disperse it into the gardens anyways. Why they’re so healthy and full anymore. Keeps certain pests from munching down our garden too.”
“I’m Tom Riddle. I’ll be in my first year and I assume you will too?” because she was small, smaller than him and smaller than even some of the nine year olds Tom knew at the orphanage.
“A charity.” Lucius waved off easily. Narcissa wondered if he knew anything besides that. They’d been to so many Ministry functions, their purposes tended to all blur together.
But he also wasn’t willing to let her go.
. Your father’s cloak- he gave it to you as a gift. Why did he have it? He had known about you, had put you with the muggles and never returned to check on you and when you tried to voice your abuse, the neglect and pain you suffered at their hands was dismissed. You had killed a man your first year, a damned man, but killed him nonetheless after being drawn into something that you, as a first year student, should never have been a part of. Your second year came the Chamber and you were shunned and mocked by all, and the professors meant to help you and protect you did
“Of course you would like flying,” she sighed wistfully. “Do you like Quidditch as well?”
The press, the Ministry, none of them knew that she was suffering at all and Merlin forbid that she had Voldemort’s soul in her.
“Recent investigations have pinpointed several clues to his continued existence. We have not yet received clearance from your Ministry to pursue those leads.”
“I’ve dabbled, here and there.” she smiled up at him. He smiled back as though it were an instinctual response and Narcissa may have felt a trickle of fury at that. Everyone who was anyone seemed to be watching her and thus, her husband as well and so everyone would see how utterly,
Dementors were…Not the best thing for her to deal with. She found that out when Pettigrew escaped Azkaban somehow and Dementors were set loose on school grounds. All her worst memories…
Maybe if she were a boy, it'd be different. Then she would be the youngest Weasley boy and surely even that was better than what she had now.
She stepped clumsily, scowling at the gentle way Lucius led her along after helping her balance herself. She was temporarily made blind as he led her somewhere and she was tense. Were they finally going to do what she had been kidnapped for? But then she was feeling something she hadn’t in a long while- a breeze. The spell against her vision lifted and she had to blink rapidly to try and adjust a little easier to the sudden light. She was still in cuffs, her arms tautly pulled behind her back and she was still a captive but there was a sudden surge of such gratitude that it almost crushed her chest. They were in a meadow, standing just outside of a doorway and it was beautiful. The greens and then the sky was an intense, deep blue with pretty picturesque clouds and far from them was the edges of what she felt might be a forest and she ached at how beautiful it was.
“A new member as in someone’s up the duff or a new member as in someone new coming to our little village?”
She’d been out in the muggle world, looking for interesting toys to entertain Teddy with when she got him in a few days. She had more or less joint custody of him with his grandmother; Harry couldn’t bear the thought of trying to take away her grandson after all she lost. She’d been out in the muggle world so had been more relaxed than she could have been, a little less wary than she would have been and whole

was alone when it’d come near her. They seemed drawn to her though so she made sure she was always alone so that no one could see her weakness. It didn’t do her very much good; she lost a good deal of her appetite and she didn’t eat in the Hall. Thankfully, she was easy to overlook and always had been a bit distant from her fellow Housemates. She was unable to shake off one particular boy though. He was called Loony by most of their Housemates but aside from his dazed demeanor, he didn’t bother her. Besides he’d found her after a Dementor got too close this year and had simply stayed with her until she woke and gave her chocolate frogs. Well, he stayed with her when she was awake and twitchy too but still. He talked about odd things sometimes but he edged her onto his father’s paper, and she
She would send presents, she would make sure they had money, but her love would always be from a distance.
“What?” he snapped blue eyes to her, turning to Poppy and Neville with a frown. “Do I really?”
“I’ll be leaving the country you see. I certainly don’t want to be around when there’s going to be a hunt for those with
“Yes, she was close to the ah…” he trailed off, rubbing the back of his neck now sheepishly. With his blond hair and always kind gray eyes, Diggory had a sort of charisma that he wasn’t truly aware of. It was because of this charisma that he couldn’t understand what it was like being a normal teenage boy, hence his unpopularity with most of his male peers. That and girls called him things like ‘dreamy’, ‘dashing’ and ‘perfect’. Competition of the highest order.
“Really? I never really liked Draughts. It reminds me of chess.”
His handsome form was partially from absorbing soul pieces, and partially charms. His skin was still bone pale, and had patches of gleaming small scales and he did still have claws on hands and feet both and he was actually still ridiculously tall, like stretched taffy. And his eyes were completely, entirely red without the charms- no white to be seen at all. But he did have a full head of hair and eyebrows and eyelashes, and he did have a nose and a more human looking face outside of the red eyes and being bone pale and having scales. He had actual ears now instead of the too small malformed set he’d had out of the cauldron and she felt like it was an odd thing to focus on but frankly, being here at all was odd and better that she think of that than how she was trapped here under Voldemort who didn’t want to kill her.
“Lockhart was a total quack, useless as boots with no sole.” she pointed out. He’d ran off their second year, then managed to convince his lovestruck fans that he’d been called to help some other country disperse of a nundu problem they were having, even though nothing of the sort was happening. “I really don’t think he even had a teaching license.”
“The Confederation has authority over most magical communities affiliated with us in times of critical emergency.”
Stunned, Narcissa stared at the woman. Surely, they couldn’t do that? The only thing wrong with the Ministry was their bowing to Muggleborn families and banning Dark Arts! And there was nothing wrong with their education!

Then, as Lucius smiled and shared more little anecdotes about his son, decided that really, the marriage wasn’t that strong anyways if a little flirty behavior was enough to ruin it.
“Where do you put it?” Neville asked suddenly. “Your food,” he clarified when she turned her head his way with those unnerving eyes.
“For now.” Crouch grunted, getting up to go back to the Ministry. Jasmine stood and Jasper watched his parents dart over to latch onto her tightly, regardless of who else was in the room.
“Oh come off, Bourke.” Hattie scoffed as she surveyed her extended greenhouse. It was hobbled together, a bit, from three different old and busted ones but she and the others in their community had it in fine working order. “Now what are you really here for?”
“Mm. We’ve got some new members to join us soon.”
“Yes, Mr. Prefect.” she said before passing him and back towards the common room. He had a meeting to get to.
. Ah, and the coffee…The absolute
He’d had to remind them that they were in no position to tell him what to do, nor who he chose to keep company with. Alongside dangling that her score was higher than any of theirs academically and that she, the first female Quidditch player in Slytherin, was the star of said team. Tom could never bring himself to like flying on a broom, but he would flaunt her talents as though they were his own because more or less, she was considered his. If she wasn’t with him, she was alone and her standoffish attitude tended to keep away others. As they got a bit older, it was Tom’s reputation. Oh, he was admired in the school certainly, and a golden boy, a favorite. But there were those who knew that he was to be feared. Probably, he mused, some sort of hind brain self-preservation. He ate his food with his usual manners and with elegant timeliness. Evans was never so conscious and while she wasn’t a barbarian, the amount of food she could put away in even a five minute span was often unsettling. Where she put it all, no one could fathom.
Of course, they gave Marigold all the credit for what happened, their parents did. Dumbledore didn’t look convinced, not by the way his sparkling eyes looked to her like he knew instinctively. Since their parents and Paddy had already woven their own grand story of what they thought probably happened, Mimoza didn’t bother correcting them. They were Gryffindors after all and she’d long since learned to associate anyone with that House to have specific personalities with one of the most defining trait being a mull-headed irrational stubbornness. So when Marigold woke up remembering nothing (that was understandable, having been possessed most of the time and unconscious the rest of it) they took it as justification for their story.
Malfoy Manor, at least not any part she had seen. Almost everything was white or silver or platinum there, pristine colors.

“Ms. Mulberry,” Lucius greeted warmly which garnered attention given that Lucius Malfoy, while charming and suave, absolutely was not
to the entire branch of magic. Even the use of the term ‘Dark Arts’ is debated heavily by the Confederation while this Ministry slaps it on anything that they deem too dangerous for the uneducated masses they help create. Most of the time, those magics, be they potions or even ward systems, are actually considered ‘gray’ or neutral as we of the Confederation like to say.
“What?” he croaked. His parents, both of them, visibly winced.
He was rather handsome, she thought.
“I’m not that small!” Ginny piped in with a frown before turning curious brown eyes back onto Jasmine. “I’m Ginny by the way. Ron’s one of my brothers.”
Evans was continuously proving herself to be invaluable. She seemed like a natural at magic, almost as much as Tom himself. She gained Slytherin just as many points as he did and for that, a good portion of their Housemates stopped calling them mudblood to their faces and trying to hex them. Not all of course, but a good amount. Tom had already decided that he didn’t want to just be a mudblood anymore. No, Tom had decided that he wanted to be the
She would take the reigns of his recovery into her own hands. Six years in Azkaban was better than twelve but the damage could still be irreparable.
She wondered if she would become a full blown homewrecker or not.
“Waning?”
She herself was dressed in one of her prettier dresses- purple and dainty and she tugged her trunk along on a cart behind her, Hesperia's cage set atop it as she moved through the bustle of people. Her wild mane of thick black hair was separated into two low bushy pigtails as usual and her bright red earrings were the same color as the train she was delighted to notice. Seeing as she didn't actually know anyone, she made her way right onto the train and immediately found an empty compartment near the middle of the train but closer to the end. Getting her trunk up and stowed away after pulling her carry bag from it and letting Hesperia out of her cage (she perched by the open window, glaring out at the sea of people) she cracked open one of her books.
Hermione sighed and finally turned off the wizarding wireless. It would only be popular songs and infomercials from then on. She had only really been listening with half an ear, working on a few more projects and essays for the year; it was only the first week out of school so far but better to get it all done as soon as possible while lessons were still fairly fresh in her head. She might just read up on those Felidae later though, they sounded rather interesting. From his spot napping Crookshanks stretched adorably, his paws flexing and as she usually was affected, Hermione melted a little at how cute he was. Alright, she might also be a bit of a cat person and the Felidae were
“Aunt Marge,” she called and the woman jumped. Before, Poppy remembered her as a large beefy woman- loud and mean and violent. After her brother's death she had lost weight, her graying hair had gotten more so and her mustache had disappeared. She took better care of herself now though and she'd more than once heard the woman mutter about keeping strong and healthy for Dudders.
“Why did that snake have two heads?” Jasper asked the elf. It was Jasmine that answered, speaking for the first time in his presence.
“Perhaps that was not specific enough. No need to fret, young Poppy Potter.” he assured her and really, it wasn’t reassuring at all. “You will come to no harm here.”
“Wait, the Ministry owns the Prophet?”
“Yeah Dud. Sure.”
“Found what, Tom? It can’t be more than two in the morning.”
“Do your best, you’ll get through it. And we can…We can go to the cinema or something when you get back yeah?” he offered a wobbly smile and she smiled back, patting his muscular back.
“Your fourth year…” his hand switched arms to caress at the scar Wormtail made on her. “While Crouch Jr. had been ingenious in his ability to put your name in, it would never have happened if the ones who spelled the goblet hadn’t cut sharp corners in their haste. Being blamed and accused of cheating to get into it, having the school turn their backs on you once again and even the friend who you thought you could truly rely on…And then to be still forced to compete and then slandered against as a minor, to have to have faced dangers meant originally for only those who were trained more clearly, for those who wanted to take the risk of severe injury for fame and fortune and glory to their schools. To have only been accepted when it was clear that there were very real dangers that you were being forced to go against when no one had believed you before. Traitorous children and adults who were eager to condemn you so quick to turn and try to swindle their way out of the horrid things they’d said and done against you. Only to be then forced into my father’s graveyard at the end, fight for your life after watching another’s taken.” he reached up to brush her tears away- they were blurring her vision now and she was breathing fast as she tried not to cry. She hated thinking about those times.
his name was said with such a deep derision that he felt a flare of hatred for this girl. “Do you know what happens when your soul is splintered too many times? From too much of the darkest of arts with no rest period? One would go insane. Slowly losing their personality and devolving into madness. Why do you think there are such harsh restrictions on so much of Dark magic? Not because it’s all nefarious, because if someone decides they like the high they get from it, they might keep on using it without balancing it out with neutral or Light magic. And that will lead them to try to find new highs and they’ll stop caring about how it might hurt others. Like an addict. An
“Not at all surprising.” the small woman huffed. She finished off the glass of wine she’d been nursing, snatching another soon after. “Well. I suppose I see now why all anyone seems to be doing is gossiping or boasting. There really is nothing else to do. How drearily dull. Why not have a, I don’t know, exhibit on display or maybe some form of entertainment besides that terribly graceful band. Or at least art to look at,
Rather than being alarmed at this, she was too sleepy to really read much into his words and simply nodded.
“And the schooling before Hogwarts! Usually taught by parents or if there’s enough money, home tutors! It tips a completely uneven scale of things! There’s no primary school for these children and thus, their education levels range from illiterate who are barred from Hogwarts regardless of how bright or inherently powerful they are, to those who have already learned the basics of the first year classes and are being forced to slough through it all again!
Sometimes there were snatches of what she was sure was talking but she always tuned out pretty quickly.
“Yeah and I heard you haven't been in bed lately. Got a boyfriend?” Ginny teased and Ron felt like she was being cornered. What did they even
“How do you talk like that?”
Maybe she should get a haircut? She could decide over hols. It would be the second time besides disastrous second year that she stayed and she’d already told her parents. She shook her head and got dressed properly before grabbing the Cloak and sneaking out and away, down to first collect Nev and then over to the Chamber.
Through the door, a hissed command and forcing her down the slide (he would need to find a way for stairs or some more dignified way but he was frankly too excited to have bothered fiddling with potential commands) before following and nearly knocking her to the ground after she’d gotten up.
“So what did you two intend telling me about all this?”
Ron snorted a little in his robe, hiding another snigger and Hermione shot him an annoyed look for it.
He, as always, smelled pleasant. She wished he didn’t.
“I’d say there’s been enough
“Yeah, Bill wanted to go through with it- had a penfriend there who sent him something nasty since mum and dad couldn’t afford it.” Ron sighed. “I didn’t think it could be that much different if they’re doing student exchanges though?”
“I…See.”
“The moon. The lunar cycles shouldn’t affect you any more than other animals, but for me…Well, it should be fine.”
“Once you’re out of the office, there should be a House Elf waiting to take you to a room.” the Headmaster said kindly and he watched his mum nod against the girl’s head. They didn’t let go even as they moved to the door, making others shuffle awkwardly out of the way. Jasper followed a few moments behind them, leaving a sizable distance.
want to be here. She’d never meant to come back, she’d meant to either die out on missions or fake her death if the recurring suspicions proved correct and live the rest of her life alone as a hermit or put herself on the Draught of Living Death to avoid it all. Cygnus touched her face but Corvus refused to let his death-grip go and tried to press himself closer. She suspected if he tried to open his mouth he would openly sob.
“So what House do you think you'll be in?”
“You act like knowing how to take care of oneself is a bad thing?” her head cocked to the side.
“The young lady has been attempting for the past several days to have ice-cream and waffles for breakfast.”
“I don’t much care about all that.” she said bluntly. “You want to prep her for going out into a world that thinks she’s some sort of idol? If she lets you, have at it.” she signed off pretty easily. “Not like I can teach her whatever magic things people do in a magic school.”
He might just be more sentimental, with he and Pearl expecting their own child now. They’d always wanted children- of that they’d made sure of when they’d first gotten serious. They’d always been soft for children.
She breathed in slowly, reveling in the crisp air. And then was distracted because a huge fluff of a cat was rubbing against her bare leg and meowing at her. She wished her arms were free to pick up this behemoth or to pet him and her shoulders twitched. Lucius stooped to pick him up instead, holding the large thing against a broad chest and likely getting fur embedded in his ironed shirt.
“You are a fine example of a Felid.” he told her proudly. She opened her eyes drowsily. He was looking at her with gleaming eyes, approval in them. Then he turned to the charmed window. “Hm. Soon it will be waning. It should be fine.” then he turned back to her. “But we’ll need a larger space for that.”
She shook her head weakly and watched him paw more out of the air to destroy in vague, drowsy interest. It was sort of like when Crookshanks would paw at the little birds Hermione would conjure up for him in their dorm. Soon there were angry bangs at the door and she turned her head lazily.
“When sunbathing, it’s best to go bare. Oh! I said that aloud.” she smiled sheepishly. Well Narcissa had her answer then. “You’ll have to pardon me, I’ve just come from another function and I’m afraid I may have had a few glasses.”
“What do you know about it?” he asked her, still far too close. But she supposed that anywhere within the vicinity would be far too close. At least he didn’t seem upset that she had destroyed it.
“No. Besides, do you know any previous winners? Not that eternal, their fame.”
“Thestrals?”
Evans was called before him to be Sorted and he watched her go. Since she had proved to have useful information, Tom had sat with her in the train compartment and tried to get as much information as he could squeeze out in the time. She was remarkably helpful, even if her answers seemed a bit short and clinical. He had also managed to learn that she was supposedly a muggleborn. Tom didn’t believe it for a moment, but he didn’t say anything about it lest she take herself elsewhere while there were still things to be learnt from her. He found himself hoping she would be in Slytherin, the House he’d decided was the best. A familiar face would be nice, but not necessary. Besides, she seemed fine with simply listening to his demands and meeting them so far. When she had sat herself on the stool and that
“I don't know, that girl seemed awful bossy to me...”
“You could ask a Prefect- they might know a point-me spell.” Eddie spoke up even as the girl looked around- it was a mess of open books, Hesperia perched up with the trunks and Eddie's cat rolled on the floor.
And…That was it. She had no idea what happened after that. In her concentration, she almost missed the small sound of the doorknob opening. Almost, but she still caught it and her body froze for a moment. Petunia used harsh, fast raps and quiet shrilling to keep from waking her slumbering uncle and cousin (who honestly, probably wouldn’t have woken up even if she had really shrieked). Uncle Vernon, rare as it was that he was the one getting her, could be heard long before he reached the door which he would thump heavily once in warning, rumbling out ‘Girl’ and then moving along. Dudley, when he was younger, would just slam open her door whenever he felt like bothering her before all the locks, or when they weren’t all done up when she finally had a room and not just the cupboard. Even after he’d gotten better (as a person, she meant) he had still held onto barging in with no warning until he’d caught her in her knickers while she was changing. After that, it was his usual stampede, a ridiculously timid gentle knock and only after he received permission would he come in. He’d only once strummed up the courage to ask about her scars.
“If you think
, came from muggles. You know, the muggles have had a fax machine for a good century now. Telephones for another hundred and some years. Yet the closest thing that the British Ministry and the majority of its occupants seem to have are two-way objects that, frankly, are a rare commodity as it is and as I’ve heard, are only made by one or two families for a ridiculous commission price. Or the WNN which is either radio shows thereabouts or a Ministry news station. It’s no wonder, I suppose, that near nothing constructive seems to get done when people are sending out owls and using charms to send everything in paper airplanes or origami folds.” she rolled her eyes. “I went to a little café just the other day here and asked for a cappuccino. Boy had no clue what it was, and neither did the shift manager. A
Scarlet eyes. Scarlet eyes, but perfectly styled dark brown hair and a handsome, charming face. He was older now than the shade had been, a few lines of age that even long magical lifespans couldn’t quite slow down but-
“I’m pretty sure Helle is a good luck charm.” Owen mused to her. “This is the healthiest, most abundant I’ve ever seen your garden yet. Gil’s goats have been producing more milk, the rabbits have been coming in all nice and plump, even the bees seem to be bustling. And I think we’ve had to use less pesticides lately too. And Beryl has been swooping in to teach her handicrafts now hasn’t she? Not a lot of bandaids on her for a beginner. Three years here already and I think our usual yields have almost doubled.”
“She won’t be bony either, being on the Quidditch team.” Malfoy threw in and Tom wondered if these were observations the two boys made beforehand or not. How irksome.
“And you’re sure you won’t give me your real name?”
“Oh, don't forget Ms. Potter. Detention tonight.” her eyes gleamed cruelly and she heard her classmates snicker.
“Is that allowed?” Diggory asked, crossing his arms.
