“Why would it be a bad thing?” asked Hermione as she reached for another olive. “Common ground is an excellent foundation for intimacy.”
“Alright,” said Draco. He sounded very quiet. Harry closed his eyes and listened to the sound of his breathing.
Malfoy opened his mouth. Harry could feel his inhale against the skin of his thumb. The gag buckled at the back of Malfoy’s head, where the white hair was very short and fine.
He could feel Malfoy still staring at him, but he opened the menu when Harry looked up. When the waiter came, he ordered the lasagne and an iced coffee.
“See you around,” Harry echoed faintly. The smirk became even less of a smirk, and then Malfoy was out the door, and it swinging closed behind him. Harry gave himself five seconds, and then fell back onto the bed, exhaling loudly at the ceiling.
Harry laughed, more because he was pleased than anything else. “Come on,” he said, gesturing with his hand. Jane blew air out of her nose loudly.
Malfoy stopped where he was, one foot over the threshold, one hand on the door. The bell above it ringed. It was obvious he didn’t know whether or not Harry was fucking with him.
“Fuck.” Harry had to grip the edge of the island, herding Malfoy in. He rubbed his thumb up and down, massaging the wet, intimate tissue there. Malfoy just took it like a fucking pro. His cock was a hard line resting on Harry’s hip.
“It is,” Malfoy said, once he could lift his head back up. “It really is. I mean, you’re right – it’s  just that –
“As you always tell me.” Malfoy took the mats in her arms and added them to the top of his pile, before turning on his heel and heading towards the temple.
He cleared his throat and tried again. Malfoy raised his brows at him over the body of the persimmon.
“Draco.” Harry had the chair back on all four legs. He was sitting forward, earnest, his hands resting on his parted legs. Draco looked away again. “Come on. It’ll be –”
“Because it matters,” said Draco and then pressed his lips together tightly. He didn’t know why he did this. He didn’t know why he did –
Harry shrugged. They both looked at Charlie. Charlie was seated between the two inflatable dragons on the sofa.
She goes into the bathroom and squeezes out all the toothpaste into the sink, clogging it up with blue and white ropes that will make your teeth noticeably whiter in just two weeks, and then she grabs her tooth brush and snaps it in two, and grabs the roll of toilet paper and just starts unspooling it all over everything; the toilet seat, the shower head, the bathtub – she goes into the extra bedroom, where her parents used to sleep, and drapes it over the four posters, around her mother’s dressing table. She takes that beloved mirror, the silver of it covered in a film of dust, of abandonment, and smashes it on her knee, and gasps as fragments imbed themselves in her flesh and trickle down her calf to her ankle. She smears her blood on the wooden panels and looks at the ceiling and thinks – t
If it had been anyone else, Harry would have snapped back by now. But the way Malfoy looked as he spoke – desperate, fervent, almost religious – Harry understood he was being given something.
Potter frowns and her eyes go unfocused for a moment. Then she blinks at Draco. “Right.” she says, and clears her throat. “Well, I’ll be going. Have a good day Malfoy.” she turns around and walks out the door, and down the stone path, away into the distance. The door swings open behind her, letting the sea breeze all into the room. Draco shuts it. It’s much bigger than the window.
Harry closed his eyes. The sunlight poured insistently against his skin, the red of his blood lighting up like a lantern through his lids. The grass tickled against his open palms. He was beginning to understand what he had to do now. The knowledge dawned like the raw blaze of the Scottish sun, cresting over familiar mountains.
“Urm,” he said, pausing awkwardly about a metre away. He rummaged in his mind for something to say, and was a little shocked to find that he was, indeed, drunk.
The awful thing was, Draco knew Harry tried too. And when it got like this, when they were both trying so hard to meet in the middle but still couldn’t reach each other, it made Draco feel like they were failing as a couple. It made him feel sick.
“That’s alright, you know,” he said finally. “There’s nothing wrong with that. Everyone starts bad. That’s the point of starting.”
Draco dips his fingers briefly under the collar at the back of Harry's shirt, before straightening back up.
“Oh, for fuck’s sakes,” he said immediately, and then felt bad when the girl lifted her head to peer at him.
“I think that you don’t quite know me either,” said Malfoy, the light overhead shifting from blue into red, and then he got up and ordered another milkshake.
Malfoy elbowed him sharply in the ribs and he doubled over, snickering. “God,” he gasped, “Your body’s a
Harry took a seat. He wasn’t sure what he had expected. A room filled with stuffed toys maybe, or lots of plants and educational posters. Instead, it looked mostly just like a regular office. There was one house plant in a corner, although it looked like it was dying.
He waited for Draco to say something. But Draco just kept looking at him, his lips parting and closing a few times, like petals quivering in the breeze. Then he looked away, and Harry had the distinct impression suddenly that he was missing out on something. But he couldn’t figure out what, and so he opened his mouth to say the second thing he had come here to say.
“We’ve decided to take things in a more artistic direction,” Harry said. “To humanise the subject, make you more relatable. We don’t want to exotify the LGBT community, see.”
Malfoy shuffled his legs in closer to himself, wrapping one hand around a bony ankle. “Okay,” he said.
Harry shook his head. He wondered whether his dark skin was also reddened like a rose, or whether it hid it.
Recently? Ever since the trials, Draco Malfoy had disappeared from the world’s attention. Draco Malfoy had disappeared completely. Father in Azkaban, Mother always traveling, no matter what intentions she had of staying. The house, grey and gaping, a wound that wanted to close around him. Even during the few times Pansy had called on him, there had been something between – a sheen of glass that wouldn’t let him out of his own loneliness. So he gave in.
“You want more?” Says Malfoy. “Is that what you want, more? You want me to fuck you with my fingers until you scream, until you can’t think, until you’re clenching down on me? Tell me,” she leans in, voice tickling Harry’s ear. “How long has it been since you’ve lost control? How long have you been thinking of this?”
“You say his name like he’s famous.” There was a glass of water next to her elbow. She didn’t offer it to him. “I mean, mostly I was joking. Now I’m not so sure.”
When they were done, Harry laid back on the mat and tilted his face to the sun, panting. The sensation of the sweat on his skin, his clothes clinging to him, was unexpectedly pleasant. He closed his eyes.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut. “It’s just not fair,” he managed, after a while. “Because you…didn’t know what you were getting yourself into. With me.”
They continued. The path curved and dipped down, gradually descending beneath the tree line. The view disappeared, but they were inside it – everything was green. It was almost too beautiful to be real, Harry thought. This whole village; it was too much for him.
“That’s awful,” muttered Malfoy, but despite himself, he was smiling. “What would a peanut even protest about?”
“The novel finally opens up,” said Harry. He thought about it. “To its core. It undoes all its restraints and just…engulfs you.”
Oceania looked at him for a long moment in that way of hers. “Harry,” she said eventually. “If you reached for him. He would meet you. Every time.”
Draco takes off her coat and pulls out a surviving cup. She’s just reaching for the pot when the unfamiliar catches her eye.
“I don’t have anything to do,” said Malfoy, and when Harry moved his gaze to his face, it was drawn down, like he was looking at the hipbone too.
Malfoy came back up abruptly, turning, wide-eyed to face Harry. His mouth was pale, his pupils blown. Two hands came up to cling at Harry’s shoulders, and he stared at Harry unnervingly.
“Oh, Harry,” she said once she could breathe again. “Of course he is. Gosh, you’re so lovely. Go to sleep.”
“Urm.” His voice sounded higher on the phone, and it crackled a bit in places. “They’re all well. Sunshine’s wreaking havoc, as per usual. Jane is being introverted. I think she’s fine though. And Mayo is his old silly self.”
“I’m not going to lower myself to your level,” Hayden said coolly, and headed off into the woods with their blue cheese.
“Oh no,” said Harry, “That’s okay.” His arm was still raw from where Jane had almost got him the day before.
“Do you want tea?” he asked, wheeling Draco’s suitcase over to the lounge. “Or like something to eat? Did you have food on the plane?”
The idea of Malfoy dating someone other than Pansy Parkinson felt very foreign. He tried to imagine Draco Malfoy, with his pointy shapes and outrageous mouth and floral leggings, in love, and it was a bizarre thing indeed. He hadn’t supposed Tom was Draco’s type – but what did Harry know anyway? Love was very strange.
“Oh.” Malfoy’s lips twitched, although he still looked confused about the whole thing. “Well. Hello.”
He didn’t understand why Harry couldn’t feel it too. Sometimes when Harry strode too close to things like this, he had to leave, and he felt like it always made him seem uncooperative. But the truth wasn’t that at all. He was water-logged with feeling, and sometimes it spilt right out.
“Every Thursday night,” drawled Malfoy, “We go and get completely pissed in the scraggly undergrowth.”
The light was all over the sheet; spilled milk running over the creases. Harry rubbed desperately at the fabric, biting at his knuckles. God.
Luna thought about it. “Sometimes,” she said, after a moment. “But normally, I manage it. I ask to see a friend. Or I keep busy.”
He backed up into downward dog, pressed his ankles firmly down. Flowed forward into plank, then upwards dog. Flowed again. Began to work on opening his lower body.
After a few minutes the path widened and Malfoy fell back, letting Harry catch up with him. They were walking side by side now. Harry could feel his tongue in his mouth.
said Harry. He rolled over, but Malfoy was already halfway to laughing again, his lip trembling under where he had bit it.
He felt Malfoy look to the floor. Felt his eyes rummage through the dirty laundry and dusty carpet and ambiguous litter, until he found it. Harry felt the exact moment he found it. He felt it in his bones.
“If you want, you can bring your attention to your third eye chakra,” said Tom. “The space between your brows.”
Over at the island, he poured summoned the firewhiskey and poured out a thumb into each glass anyway. “Rocks?” he asked.
“They’ve taken the cafeteria off for a mass cleansing. It’s fireproof, but Gorrick the forth couldn’t keep his shit together last night, and well, you can’t prepare for everything.”
Next to the contents page there was a large, scratchy drawing of a dragon with a sun halo. Harry glanced up at Draco, but he was already immersed in his own reading. Harry skipped down the contents list cursively, before his eyes caught on chapter twelve:
Oceania pulled back to look down her long nose at him, which was pretty impressive considering her height. “Harry,” she said sternly. “Don’t tell you’ve started living your life in fear.”
“I’m going to a show after this,” he said, lowering his voice and his gaze. His lashes were very light, fanning against the blush of his cheeks. He looked like a porcelain doll under the white lights in that moment, a delicate lacey doll to be dressed and undressed. “At Toxic. Benjamin is performing. You remember Benjamin.”
“Well,” said Charlie. “He also said that you were “a gaping asshole, so wide and gaping that it was like you had just been fucked by three pornstars at once, all of whom had gaping assholes themselves, but none as wide and loose and gaping as yourself, who was truly so wide and deep that archaeologists all over the world were getting excited about the prospective findings to be had and the Tibetan government were considering funding the excavation themselves, and also that you were an immature prick.””
“Like, do you even think before you say stuff like that? Or is it like, let’s just pull out the most random Namaste chakra ass bullshit crap off the top of my head to make Harry feel unenlightened? Like, is that actually it?”
It wasn’t that he didn’t like the happiness. It was just that – it was so damn hard to feel like he was being genuine sometimes, when it was all around him and he just couldn’t feel it.
She was at his side – a friend, finally. Was she a friend? She was beautiful and soft. He loved her hair.
For a heartbeat Malfoy just stood there on the spot, and Harry thought he wasn’t going to come. But then he turned and fell into step besides Harry.
But then…it was like he got looser. He glanced at Oceania and Hayden, who had lied down on the bed and were murmuring to each other. The world got deeper. He felt his body begin to sink further into the film of reality.
“There’s no rules. S’just no rules. I keep expecting… I keep thinking. There’s got to be rules, you know? And there aren’t. There’s just… things. That happen. An’ they don’t make sense.”
Hayden’s eyes flattened, and then they stood up and topped their cup up. Something about the line of their back looked disappointed, but maybe Harry was imagining it.
When he got home he kicked his shoes off and then righted them against the wall. Then he set about making tea. He didn’t even like tea in and of itself that much, but he liked the process. It asserted his presence in the house.
Malfoy said,” Shall I pick it up for you?” His voice was softer than Harry had expected, and it was like missing a step in the dark.
Harry’s flat had an open plan kitchen to the right of the front door. In the middle was a long island, with a sleek black finish on all its cabinet doors. Malfoy perched on the island, pyramid chin raised on his clasped fingers. The hanging bottles above had
“But it’s true,” said Tom. He was also smiling at Harry, in that quiet way of his. “You’ve done so much growing, Harry.”
“Draco,” he said, and Draco’s eyes focused on him, and it felt it deep down within himself, pulsing against the dark of him, down in the place where he thought he would always be alone. Draco blinked, and it was slowed down in Harry’s mind.
Harry closed his eyes. Everything inside him was rising up. He felt it swell beneath his skin, a tidal wave on the peak of cresting. Craving, desperately, the switch from potential to kinetic energy.
For a moment, it was just like that. A sweep of violet light drew across the crowd, and for a second, every bobbing head just looked like a quivering petal. Then the song changed and the lights went an unforgiving yellow and Harry’s hand fell. Oceania was there.
“Just so that I can brag to Draco about it,” she explained once they were in the taxi. The city rushed by, scattered light darting through the black tinted windows. “Because of his no-magic diet, of course.”
“Whether we are aware of them or not,” Draco interrupted, a little more firmly. He was nodding. “Speaking of which, I think Harry is now very aware of one of his. A big, green, scaly one.”
There it was again, the feeling of not quite understanding or noticing or seeing something quite essential, but Harry looked out at the view, at the mountains and the sky and forests and endless palette of livingness, and he felt that he understood everything that he needed to.
“Did you not?” They finally sat down and crossed one elegant leg over the other. “A secret is hardly secret if it’s sauntering around the place and flexing its muscles.”
Jane was chewing on her talon. Malfoy frowned at her but stood up, stretching. His spine popped audibly as he sighed. Harry watched his shoulder bones slide under his shirt. Once he was done, he looked back over his shoulder.
“Are you ready?” he asked, finding himself grinning. Draco just tucked his chin into Harry’s shoulder.
“I want you to look at me,” he said, timbre gathering in his throat. There was a smoky flavour in the air.
Delia liked a coffee place that was a good twenty-minute walk from where they worked, right into town. Harry personally couldn’t tell what was so special about it – coffee was just coffee, wasn’t it? – but he liked the walk through the park and down the avenues with the red stone office buildings.
Because he was lame, and hadn’t been out in Scotland a lot on his own, and okay, maybe had a tiny bit of social anxiety on the side, he googled “where can I buy a yoga mat in glasgow” on his laptop before he went out. The laptop itself was second hand, and had been bought along with the flat. It just didn’t make sense to not have access to the internet when you literally lived in a muggle-dominated city. Besides, Harry was a bit muggle already, wasn’t he?
“But I uhhh.” Draco swirled the coffee at the bottom of his cup heatedly. “Fucking hate that Harry Potter is here. In the Himalayas. Where I am. Where I live. Where I lived
Mornings were always easier times. Forgiving, healing times. He watered all his plants. Made his bed. Chose an outfit and put on makeup. Then he went back to the living room.
“Anne?” He blinked, batting his eyes in a way that reminded Harry of fucking bambi or some shit. “What did she write?”
Malfoy reached a hand out, brushing a finger along the bottom of one of the statues. His fingerprint came away with dust. “I was thinking you could show him your meditation, Tom,” he said. “You know, that thing you do.”
“I’m not saying I predicted the context!” said Hermione, throwing her hands in the air. “I mean, there are definitely…elements I didn’t see coming. But…” She turned back to Harry, putting one hand over his. “It’s a bit full circle, isn’t it?”
None of this belonged to anyone. The trees and the sky and especially the mountains all existed here, independent of their own human uncertainty.
He looked over. There was a low, cold wind today but they were still holding hands. Draco could feel the familiar warmth of it. Harry looked dashing in his new trench coat.
She yanks open the cupboard, and grabs the tea cup that Potter used, and flings it across the room. The shards catch in her rug, the delicate china cracking open like an eggshell, and Potter will never use that tea cup again. She reaches for another one, just to watch it for a second time, and then she starts grabbing them by the handful, all these too many tea cups, hurtling them across the room, the sound of shattering filling her tiny lounge, and it doesn’t matter, none of it matters, because it
Malfoy casts Harry a look. “Potter,” she says. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you’ve been verging dangerously into stereotype territory since you put that first tender digit in me.”
Draco hums under his breath and examines his French manicure. He’d gotten it earlier, and Harry had groaned and rolled his eyes for the whole two hours.
Draco swallowed. It looked like a difficult action on him. “I mean,” he said. “This isn’t permanent. I meant what I said the first time. I’m not just…giving up everything for you. I have a life.”
It hadn’t been that bad at all. Malfoy was raising the bullet of it to Harry’s mouth, and he could feel his heartbeat in his neck. He had never worn lipstick before. The slick, sticky texture was unfamiliar – exotically so. It was neither wet nor dry.
But looking at Malfoy now, he didn’t want to say any of them. Malfoy was here now, in front of him, asking for Harry’s respect.
It took a bit of an effort to find some coffee powder stuff. Eventually, in the second last cabinet Harry opened, there was an opened bag of basic store brand coffee. Whilst Harry waited for it to brew, he leaned back against the counter and looked at the sofa he had got when he had first moved in. It was basic, rectangular and brown faux leather. It didn’t have any pillows. Harry didn’t even really like it.
Resentment was like that. Sharp, present, cruel. Harry felt corrupted. He didn’t have the energy for this.
To be fair, no one had asked for the knee and elbow pads, but, as Harry reasoned, the more leather he had on, the longer he could procrastinate taking it off. Maybe they’d get bored before he finished, or, possibly, an earthquake would occur.
He looked up and met Draco’s eyes over the fire. It had been a few days – days which had been filled with organising and technicalities and preparations – since Harry had told him he was leaving. He didn’t think he was angry.
“Woah,” said Malfoy, and slowed down to a walk. Together, they made their way closer to the edge. It was vibrant, impossible, beautiful.
“Rambling.” The syrup was fine. Harry looked over at Malfoy, who was leaning nonchalantly on the edge of the island, hand in pockets. “Why is that?”
Then her forehead crumpled. “Oh, god,” she gasped, and a hand flung to cover her mouth. Her eyes were wide and shocked above her thumb.
Harry thought about that. Her and Blaise and Draco – and even Luna, Oceania, and the rest of them – had always seemed so other to him, in a way he didn’t think he could explain. Maybe that wasn’t true anymore. Maybe he was other.
Malfoy pressed his thin, thin lips together. Harry hadn’t quite realised how thin they were until now.
“I’ve been told it’s not my fault. But I think it probably is, at least a little bit. I mean, I’m supposed to take care of you.”
“Ready?” he said, tugging at the hem of his t-shirt. It was sky blue, and clearly part of a matching set with his leggings. Harry found the idea of Malfoy having both exercise leggings and then everyday leggings incredibly amusing.
Luna handed him the mug with green tassel on it. They both drank in silence. It really was pretty good hot chocolate.
“I know,” she says, after she’s pulled back and Draco is gasping. Her lips feel like they’ll tear in half she’s smiling so wide. “I know, I know, I know.”
As the night continued, Harry felt its black wings spread and glimmer. Beside him, Malfoy got drunker and drunker, and Benjamin laughed harder and harder. He kept catching Malfoy’s eye during jokes he didn’t understand. When Benjamin left to catch up with another Queen, Malfoy took his stool, downing the rest of his wine.
But Draco Malfoy had been right. He was different to Harry – a different species, almost – but that didn’t mean he was less. Maybe Draco Malfoy was all of these things, everything he had been and everything he was now. And Harry didn’t understand it – but maybe it wasn’t for him to understand.
Time was a funny thing when you were drunk. It had been a long night. Harry felt the warmth of the fire, licking up his side, and he closed his eyes.
In the lounge, Potter stands whilst Malfoy picks out the cups. Her hands are shaking again. When she turns around, Potter is smiling at her.
“Excellent,” Charlie rubbed his hands together. “Then we can get you introduced to your training dragon right away.”
“Breathe in to your third eye,” he instructed. “The space between your brows. Feel the space there. Focus your energy there.”
“If you had just told me you were a substance abuser to begin with,” Draco says. “You could have saved me a lot of sleepless nights.”
He stood there in the doorway for another second, arms crossed over himself. He had changed back into a jumper and jeans but hadn’t removed the eyeliner. It was bizarre to see him hesitating.
Oceania frowned. She leaned forward, her hair falling into the apple sauce. “But how,” she said, “Do I know that they have feelings in the same way that I have feelings?”
He didn’t understand what was wrong with him. The war was over – and even so, it didn’t feel like anything had felt like during the war. He had felt bad things, of course he had – but nothing he had ever felt before had gotten into his bones like this. This went beyond feeling. He hadn’t known that there were so many parts of him available to hurt.
Somehow, even Harry’s wrist was hot underneath Draco’s fingers. “You know,” he said, and let go. “The meditating.”
He looked over at Malfoy, then again at his leggings. He wondered how many people had to leave in order to feel like themselves.
The jacket said, “I might be too punk rock for you” in purple lettering. Harry bit down hard on his lip.
He ran. But his body couldn’t keep up. Eventually, he had to stop, sagging against a tree and coughing, sweat catching at the cracked corners of his mouth. It hurt, but not as much as –
Somethings you don’t realise you’ve thought until you’re saying them. And then once you’ve said them, it’s like everything else rearranges around them to make a bit more sense.
He blinked at it. When you got up this early, it felt like you were the only person in the world. He started to walk.
“Speaking of which.” Malfoy ignored him in favour of selecting a flogger with a glass dildo as a handle. “This is one of my personal favourites. Good for when you’re lonely.”
Yoga class was at the top of the mountain. Yoga class was also, to Harry’s horror, less of a class and more of just Draco Malfoy and the girl with black hair he’d been sitting next to earlier contorting on mats in ways that Harry didn’t necessarily think their bodies should be contorting.
“Yeah. I’ll see you,” said Harry, and opened the door. Malfoy was still standing there at the kitchen table when he left, one finger curled into the cup of the tea he didn’t like.
“I’m in love with her,” said Zambini. “I’ve always been in love with her. However, if she won’t be coming with me, then I think I’ll retire to somewhere with rather more bathtubs. Perhaps Switzerland.”
“You’re evil,” he said. “Pure evil. Look, I’m not sure what’s happening. Okay? I just wanted to…figure some stuff out.”
There. That was what Malfoy did. Harry watched his fingers rub that bone on his wrist, like they were polishing a pearl, and closed his eyes. It was cresting in him again.
“Just…” Harry took a deep breath, made himself meet Malfoy’s gaze. He shrugged. “I…why am I so bad with dragons?”
Malfoy straightened back up. “Oh,” he said, his voice breathy in that after-laugh kind of way. “I did. I definitely did. But Charlie was there.” He smirked at Harry out of the corner of his eye.
He was still looking a little flabbergasted. Harry looked at him. His eyes were still watery, but he didn’t bother to wipe them.
Harry suddenly became aware of Oceania, sitting quietly beside them. She was looking straight ahead and smiling into her persimmon. He inhaled sharply.
With a horrible sense of foreboding, Draco opens her mouth under Harry and kisses her back. Harry’s hot tongue is everywhere, and oh, how Draco has missed her, how Draco has loved her – and then her hot hands are everywhere too, gripping her hips, pressing her in closer, reaching to unbutton her shirt – and Draco turns her head to the side and gasps.
He found a place called SweatyBetty. For a moment, he found himself imagining how much Draco would have delighted over a shop name like that, and then he abruptly made himself stop thinking about Draco Malfoy. This had happened several times since coming back to Scotland, and each time, he had to firmly stop the thought-process in its tracks. If he didn’t, basic things like purchasing yoga mats would never be completed.
Jane just blinked meaningfully at him. Of course, he didn’t know what that meant though, so he just waved and then came back the way he went. He didn’t know where else to check. Which was a bit ridiculous really, considering how long he had been here. He should really have taken the time to explore the area more.
He abruptly stopped laughing when Blaise Zambini stepped out from between the glass displays. He was in a sharp pinstriped suit, his hands full of shopping, and when he caught sight of Harry he raised his brows, and then began to walk on over.
When he stepped back into the bedroom, Malfoy took one look at him and collapsed into a pillow. He was giggling so hard the mattress shook.
“It’s a lady who knitted a scarf for me,” Luna explained. “She’s got a lot of interesting things to say about rhubarbs. But she also told me my eyes were pretty, so we shall see what happens.”
It was only once they got to Harry’s flat that he felt the real world come back to him. As he paid the taxi driver, Draco asked, “Where am I staying?”
Tonight's song is Give Great Thanks by Dorian Electra with a dash of Under The Stars at 1am by Kosibeats at the end.
The next morning, Harry found himself leaning against the sink in Oceania’s lemon yellow kitchen and precariously nursing water from a cereal bowl. The cereal bowl had splotches of black and white patterning on the outside, and inside at the very bottom, it merely said ‘Moo’.
Harry let his back fall awkwardly into the space between his knees and behind him. The sun was shining hot on his face.
It had been a long time since the break-up. Harry allowed himself to be led through a maze of mannequins wearing knitted lingerie.
It’s a nice cottage, to be fair. There isn’t anything wrong with it. The wood linings on the outside are painted blue, and the cement between the beams is painted white. There is moss growing on one side. It has a chimney, and two bedrooms, and a bathroom, and a kitchen which is open to the smallish lounge. It’s fine. It’s nice. The kettle is broken, has been for the past year, but Draco doesn’t mind. Draco has simply been boiling her tea water in a pot instead.
“That bowl kind of makes me uncomfortable,” said Malfoy, wrinkling his nose. “As a vegetarian, I don’t think I should.”
Oceania made herself tea, and then leaned back on the opposite counter. She regarded him over the top of her cup and smiled, just a little.
Harry Potter had changed since Hogwarts. Something about him had darkened. It wasn’t that he’d become evil, or cruel, or cynical exactly. He still had his sense of humour, his Gryffindor temper, his general aura of chaos. But something in him had sharpened. He was a little more efficient, a little more patient – a little more sceptical. He had grown up.
Hayden raised their brows. They were sitting on the opposite wall, next to Oceania, who was practising her splits.
“You too,” he said to Charlie. Together they passed under the archway and up the steps to the main building of the monastery. Charlie and Hayden both seemed to know where they were going.
Malfoy rubbed at his eyes with the side of his hand, and then pulled up a leg and rested his elbow on his knee, pressing his chin on top of his wrist. “I know that, it’s, like, shitty hearing it but – but you have to try. And it’s an everyday thing, alright? Especially at first.
There was a small queue. Malfoy kept darting looks at Harry when he thought he wasn’t paying attention, as if to check he hadn’t run off. Once they were in, Malfoy found them a small table near the front of the stage. It was already busy, and the lights were darkening.
The use of his first name caught Harry off guard. He tried to think of any other occasion Malfoy had used it and couldn’t. Did Malfoy think of him as
“If I go back there,” Harry said, with certainty, “and ask for Draco Malfoy’s picture, he will castrate me.”
“Yes,” said Tom. “A lot of us spend most of our time looking out. But what’s inside us is worth taking a look at, as well.”
Malfoy raised the point of his chin. “No, it’s just the place. An educational opportunity, you can’t pass it up.” He paused thoughtfully. “A cornucopia of cultural wealth.” Another pause. “A fecund field of cognisance.”
Malfoy swallowed. It looked different in his throat, long and white like a lily. His gaze fluttered down.
Potter blinks and blinks, and then Draco opens the door, and realisation dawns on Potter’s face. “Ah, okay.” she says, and forces a smile. “I’ll be going then.” She walks down that stone path and Draco closes the door. Takes a deep breath. Reaches for her tea.
When he was done, he leaned back against the edge of the counter the way he had when he first arrived, the cup of coffee sitting beside him. He stared down at the wood panels.
She was watching him. He was waiting for – he wasn’t sure what for. For her to breathe fire onto him. For her to suddenly stand up and claw him. For her to snap her long sharp teeth in his direction. He was sitting in front of her, and he was completely vulnerable.
Delia raised her eyebrows, then waved. “Hello? Torris is going to give you the sixth degree for that.”
It shouldn’t have mattered as much as it did. Harry pressed down his face into Draco’s jumper and breathed in. It shouldn’t have mattered; it did.
Once of Oceania’s many gifts, Harry thought, was her ability to refrain from judgement. There was nothing condescending about the way she spoke. Maybe it was because she was so strange herself; or perhaps it was something else, something related more closely to kindness and decency and the kind of morals Harry had always half-heartedly wanted to adopt in the back of his head but somehow never got around to actually attaining himself. Whatever it was, it was why he had come to her.
But he had already started, hadn’t he? In the Himalayas, he’d managed to create some sort of morning routine, a basic rinse and repeat of yoga and meditation. The fact that he was here didn’t change that, surely. He could still continue the yoga, at least.
“Alright,” said Malfoy, and sat back on his heels. He capped the black stick and rummaged around in the bag again. When he remerged, it was with his long fingers curled around a red tube.
Oceania and Hayden were too busy smoking more and talking to notice. He looked into Harry’s eyes. They weren’t seeing him anymore.
Harry had always thought that sunsets were the most beautiful thing nature had to offer, but this was good too.
“Alright,” said Harry, after a moment. Bolson was already picking up his phone and typing, moving on from their conversation. Harry picked up his file and went back to his office.
“Yes,” said the voice again, and the sound changing, like the machine was pressed closer. “Yes, I know. It’s Draco Malfoy. You asked me to call you.”
“Yes, alright, thank you. He’s here now, he’s not going to go away.” Malfoy wriggled back into the flat. “Come on then, Potter.”
Draco had read about his childhood in the various biographies that had come out. Everybody knew, by now.
Malfoy seemed to have got the message though, because suddenly his body was flailing next to Harry’s, the water louder than ever. They struggled until Harry’s feet scraped up against the loch floor, and then they were dripping and carrying each other to dry land.
“It’s alright,” Harry repeated, grinning and leaning back against the sofa. “But it’s no butterbeer.”
A twig on the ground broke behind him. Malfoy was stepping forward. Harry felt his back muscles tense up so much it was almost painful. He waited for the awful awkwardness in Malfoy’s voice.
Harry let go, took a drink to cover himself. Malfoy was quiet beside him. The show was finishing, the blonde Queen doing her final soliloquy.
Harry rolled his eyes, but felt a bit pink about the whole ordeal. “Thanks,” he said, taking the book and thinking about Draco putting in the effort to do extra research about something that was essentially Harry’s problem.
“Why Potter,” he drawled. “What secret depths lurk under the still waters of your tracksuit bottoms?”
Draco was taking in a breath. His eyes flickered down to the ground, and then back up to Harry’s throat. Lingered there, like it was a ledge he was about to jump off.
“Unless you’re Charlie,” Hayden pointed out, “And don’t need to communicate with people of your own species.”
“I think,” said Harry, “That what I would want to know is why my subconscious would choose Draco Malfoy, of all people, to hallucinate.”
There was still newspaper everywhere from when they had been painting the ceiling. Oceania pushed a few sheets of them around, until there was enough room on both of the sofas for them to sit. Then she bustled around in the kitchen. When Harry tried to join her, she waved a hand at him and told him to sit down.
It was one thing to be brave during war. But life was not supposed to be about war. And now that he was living a (relatively) normal life, he found that he didn’t have the equipment for it.
“You,” he said softly, and then paused. He licked his mouth, and then his gaze dropped down a fraction. Maybe over Harry’s shoulder. When it flickered back up, Harry became aware of the two spots of rubicund balanced atop his cheekbones.
“That was so bad,” he was saying, pushing the words past the eruptions of laughter that sounded like they were trying to suffocate him. Harry wished they would. “That was – oh god – truly fucking awful. You’re a mess, Harry. You’re an absolute mess. I just can’t –”
“I’m crying,” Malfoy wiped at his cheeks. “I’m fucking crying. Ah. God. I needed to get that out my system.”
“That was a good one,” Harry agreed. “If you ever visit Japan, you could work in one of those little cafés.”
After a while, Draco said, “Let’s get off.” If Harry hadn’t been feeling so blissed out he might have poked fun at him. They got off, and let Jane wander off.
“Life’s a circle,” he said after a long moment. Harry slapped his hands cartoonlike over his forehead.
Harry opened his eyes again and looked over. Malfoy looked surprisingly earnest, and his legs were crossed again. One finger was fiddling with the ankle bracelet.
Eight hours later and they had filtered down potential locations to investigate down to three options. Well, Draco had. Harry had also been making use of every other interval to pinpoint Draco with a dark look, which was slowly, but determinedly, driving Draco to sheer madness.
“And because they’re all ugly as shit,” continued Draco. “Could you imagine subjecting yourself to a lover who was entirely slimy and had weird sticky outy things?”
“That’s my girl,” breathed Malfoy, finally coming back to his seat. His bow had come loose at some point, and his fringe had stuck in places to his forehead. His ears were red. The glass came up; he threw his head back, throat working as he swallowed it down. Harry felt it sinking into his own gut.
“I hate you to my very core,” said Oceania, and rolled over to the fruits and vegetables. As she passed, Hayden winked emotionlessly at Harry.
He reached out and put a careful hand on Malfoy’s back. The mesh was soft, and as they moved, he could feel the damp skin through the material’s gaps in places. Against the flesh beneath his thumb, and the pads of his middle and index finger.
“I’m not saying you have to do anything about it,” Harry continued. “That’s not why I’m telling you. It’s just – I thought it should be said. It seemed like the right thing to do.”
Oceania blinked, and then she began to laugh. It was loud, real laugh, and it filled up the whole room. It made Harry blink and laugh too.
“Draco,” said Harry, and there was something horrifically soft in his expression. “You’re rambling.”
Harry directed his gaze to where another guy with slick black hair and deep Nepalese skin was toplessly operating a jackhammer into a patch of ground for no discernible reason.
Harry felt his entire body flush. It was a terrifying, intensely sensorial experience. He wanted to ask, “What about me?” but couldn’t. He was overwhelmed – cocooned in the sudden, startling fear of the feeling.
“Maybe,” said Harry. He was so drunk, but the nice thing about being drunk was that it let you do what you really wanted to do and say what you really wanted to say without any of the fear, for once.
“Well,” Draco said after a moment, clearing his throat. “Since you’re here, we might as well do some research.”
“Some risks must be taken,” Malfoy said, sighing, and then moved towards the door. When Harry looked up, his smirk was only half a smirk, but at least it was there. One hand was clutched around the handle.
Harry laughed again. “Alright,” he said, and stood up, crossing over Hayden’s long legs to get to them. When he was standing above them, he opened up his arms. “What now?”
By the time Harry had finished his third bao zi, the cafeteria had begun to fill out. Harry went to put his and Hayden’s dishes away, and when he came back, Charlie was there chatting to Hayden.
“You did what?” murmured Draco. His face was pressed into the leather of the sofa, his pale hair falling in soft strands across his cheek. He smelt like everything Harry had missed. He tilted his head and smiled.
There was a sharp squawking sound to his left and he looked over. There was Jane, in the training pen he had first been assigned to. She stared at him with her glossy, navy eyes, as if taking him. She had been chained down now, just like the rest of the dragons, once the connection had gotten strong enough to keep her tame. It was nothing inhumane – just a functional metal band around one of her legs. It was logical, if you wanted to tame a dragon, that you would keep them confined.
Oceania called for downward dog, and he lifted up, staring at his knees. His calves were stretched open, his heels hovering inches above the ground. He felt like his legs might split open.
Draco closed his eyes and tried not to think about the million and one fantasies he’d lived through. Harry, his hand around his throat. Harry, slamming him up against the wall. Harry, pushing him to his knees, and filling, filling him up entirely.
Somehow Harry felt the presence of the mountains even more acutely here. Perhaps it was because they were framed by the silence and sanctity of the forest, as vivacious as it was silent. Nature, Harry mused, was meant to be enjoyed alone.
There was something in the water, thought Draco. And then he thought: no, no, that’s wrong. I got confused. That’s just the moon.
“It’s not my fault he kind of looks like a girl,” he muttered irritably, and then froze, worried he’d broken some kind of universal gay law and had been horribly offensive, but Oceania just started giggling.
“She’s good.” When he looked at Malfoy he was smirking, a little, but his eyes were still careful. Harry hated that look. He turned back to watch Oceania.
Harry grinned as he leaned back against the sofa. He knew that Draco was only half-serious, but even so, he said, “I have changed.”
“Draco.” Harry clutches the bags to his chest and puts on a mock of his serious-auror-voice that secretly gets Draco hard. “This is political compromise. We may have our ham marketing differences, but the key is to focus on our extra tangy cheese flavoured similarities.”
Sometimes, Harry wasn’t sure whether it was Oceania who had influenced Draco, or Draco who had influenced Oceania.
He found SweatyBetty. It was mostly quiet inside, with only a few other athletic looking customers. The person at the till smiled at him. He went downstairs.
“Oh yeah,” Charlie said loudly. Oceania giggled, her arms wrapped around his neck, which was probably wise, what with the way he was swaying. “That was kind of gross. No offense Malfoy. But it was a bit gross.”
“I wonder why,” said Hayden. They took the coffee cup from Malfoy’s hand and then frowned down at it when they realised it was empty.
He made it to the top of the plaza. Oceania was already there, her back arching up into a perfect circle of pale limbs and grey sports bra and leggings. There was sweat beading down her forehead.
“Ah, yes, he made me these earrings.” Luna retrieved the blue wool hearts from under her hair. “They’re my favourites.”
Harry wrapped his arms around her and kissed her on the forehead. “I’m going to miss you too,” he told her, trying not to sound as fragile as he felt. “You’ve all been really – good to me.”
Oceania produced a spoon from her hair and reached for Hayden’s tray. They scowled and moved the tray a few inches away. There was a brief but fearsome spoon fight, apple sauce flying through the air like splatters of blood, which ended with Oceania apparently earning victorious access to the tray.
This was not a lot, Draco reasoned. This was a quite acceptable request. Draco was used to being spoilt, no denying that, but hey? He’d grown up?
Charlie had not been so lucky. Harry glanced over to where he had been situation right in the centre of the room, reaching up with his brush taped to a chopstick. There would be no disguising any painting failings there. However, to his credit, he seemed to be getting quite into it, splattering paint across the plaster with enthusiasm. He seemed to be going for a rather…loose effect.
Finally, he opened it and left it that way. He seemed to be leaning rather heavily against the handle.
“Fine,” said Hayden, stepping forward to drop the so abhorrent blue cheese into the trolley. “I’ll cry at home, alone, with my blue cheese beside me.”
Outside, the air was frosty, fragranced with the excitement that came with a day that had just ended and a night that had just begun. Malfoy had a grey overcoat, a grey the colour of rain, and metal, and other things.
But Harry kept easing out, his thumb emerging with a slick pop. Malfoy sighed. Harry then began to draw circles with it, spreading Malfoy’s spit messily over his own mouth.
Before Harry had come to Gay Dragon Village he had occasionally wondered what had happened to Draco Malfoy. Maybe he hadn’t vanished, but to Harry he might as well have. There had been so much happening in the forefront of his life for so long that the curiosity was little more than a flicker in his peripheral vision. There wasn’t room for it to grow.
The thought made him flush, all over, with shock and shame. He should have seen it coming, now he thought about it – he had felt a certain
But then he saw Draco laugh, and then he was speeding up again, and then he was there and his cheeks were pink and he was wearing a beanie and he was perfect. Harry felt like he was going to kiss him. He didn’t. Instead, he rocked forward on his heels and grinned and said, wittily, “Hi.”
Harry rubbed his hands over his face. The silence expanded, filling the room to press at his skin, his ribcage.
“Well,” he drawled, and pulled at Harry’s collar. “I suppose he does have some interesting opinions about dragons.”
“Harry,” he announced. “You have to try this. This is the drink the government has been hiding from you.”
“I’ve never been to church.” Harry admits quietly as they stand under the famous rose window, and Draco glances over at him.
“Why not?” Zambini’s glittery eyes were very innocent. “You refer to Draco by his given name, do you not?”
Still biting his lip, he went over to the table and got out a quill and some parchment. He stared at it forcefully for a few moments, before realising that it didn’t matter what he wrote, since he wasn’t going to send it.
Draco gasps and breaks away, turning her head to the side as Harry plants sloppy kisses against Draco’s burning cheek. After a moment, she slips off of Draco and tucks herself behind her, slotting her chin into the hollow of her shoulder and snaking an arm around her ribs. Draco grips her forearm.
Inevitably, it turned out that Malfoy was permanently located in the training space next to Harry’s.
Harry pressed the grainy paper of the first page between his fingers. “Agnes Grey. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. A set of poems with her sisters, but it’s published under their male pseudonyms.”
For a moment he couldn’t remember the conversation, or the voice that had said the words. Then it came back, but the words themselves reformed again in Harry’s mind, this time with more meaning than before.
“Well I’m glad you’re having fun,” grumbled Malfoy. He was clinging to the thermos like a life-band. “We don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.”
“Are you happy?” asked Harry, “I hope that this is at least the emotional equivalent of a heroin hit for you.”
Harry swallowed again. He nodded. Oceania drunk some of her tea. The orange sunlight grasped onto the pale skin of her bare elbow.
“Here, let me,” says Harry and then she starts planting wet, open kisses all down the spine of Draco’s back, licking and grazing her teeth over ridges, and in a brief moment of dazed reflection, Draco comprehends that she is being consumed.
“Can we order more shots?” he heard himself ask. “I would really like to purge my memory of, like, every-fucking-thing.”
He bit down on his lip suddenly, staring out at the open doorway. That had been a stupid thing to say. He didn’t know why he’d said it.
Malfoy rolled his head over to look at Harry. His eyes were almost blue in this light - it was the reflection of the sky. Harry realised that he was gaping, and closed his mouth. He stared up instead as Malfoy talked.
“Do you feel that?” he grunted and punctuated it with a harsh thrust. “Do you feel that big thing? I’m going to put it in your mouth.”
But with Draco it had never been like that. Or maybe it had at first; it wasn’t now. Now, when Draco studied him, it made him feel understood.
Harry was a bit shocked at the rush of emotion rushing down the middle of him. “Oh,” he said, once he’d gotten his voice under control. “Thank you.”
“Topping doesn’t just refer to gay men, you know,” Harry’s saying, leaning her head back against Draco’s bare shoulder and putting the book down. “Can you really call yourself a lesbian when you don’t know the terminology?”
He took a few pictures of Malfoy pretending to dust the coffee table. They were actually pretty good. Malfoy was still glowing from his win. Determined not to be one-upped, Harry said, “Can you bend over more?”
Draco gulps for air and swallows and pants into Harry’s collarbone as Harry kisses from her nose to her hairline.
“What kind of tea do you drink?” Potter asks loudly, and hops up onto the counter. It creaks, but she doesn’t seem to notice.
There. That was a truth. Here was another: he hadn’t been happy in a very long time. He almost couldn’t remember how it felt. He almost didn’t believe in it anymore.
Pansy narrowed her eyes. They flitted from Harry’s face to his hands, which were holding one of the photos in place on the wall.
“We’re just looking.” Malfoy put the other foot over the threshold and turned around, so that Harry almost walked into him. It was fortunate that he didn’t, since Malfoy’s bra was entirely adorned with one-inch spikes.
“Really?” Malfoy sneers, and turns around, sifting through her wardrobe. “I thought you were a girl. And Christ – haven’t you ever heard of hating yourself?”
It was quiet. Draco Malfoy today was a pastel version of himself, about three shades paler and quieter than Harry was used to. He wondered what it was that had made him this way. He wondered if it was him.
“Yeah,” says Draco, raising both eyebrows. “She's not bad. Well, I mean. A bit boring. A lot of it is just romance with rugged men who are blatantly poor choices for the quivering female protagonists, but-“
“Draco! Enough! Come over here and give me some competition!” commanded Oceania, though Harry could hear the laughter in her voice.
Or perhaps she’d been a perfectly good mother. Perhaps she had held Draco when he cried and made tea for him herself and watched over him with the anxious gaze of maternity. Harry thought about the warmth of her breath on his ear as he’d lied there, still half-dead, on the cold forest floor, and had tried to remember the last time he’d seen Draco alive for her.
Luna looked pleasantly surprised. “I’ve been wanting to make some more queer friends,” she told him.
Harry glanced away from him and felt his face heat. He picked at the mat again, and not for the first time, thought about Draco with Tom.
“Don’t argue with me,” said Draco calmly. The tilt of his chin was all authority. Harry had seen that tilt come out before, whenever Harry got particularly stubborn in his previous lessons, but it was rarely this pronounced. When the tilt came out, there was almost always no point arguing.
And Potter smiles underneath her, and lets go of her waist to clasp Draco Malfoy’s face and kiss her back.
“Hmm, I don’t know.” He didn’t look up from where he was dragging a stock photo of a man eating a burger around on an empty word document. “You can check my bag if you want.”
Pansy didn’t stop. As she studied the nearest painting she said, “Then you don’t know him as well as I do. No one does. Harry Potter, you are going to hurt him.”
But they were beautiful. They were so beautiful. Even up close – especially up close. Harry hadn’t realised it would be like this, but he felt the relief of it so deeply it was like something was unlatched. He leaned back again.
“I’ve never seen your house before,” Harry said, almost cheerfully. “I don’t even know where you live.”
Harry raised a brow to himself at the use of the word “camera.” The grass they were standing on was so thick and green he wanted to sit down on it, so he did. Malfoy turned to look down at him.
“I don’t know if I want you to. Seriously, it’s like a squirrel storing nuts or something. You know we’re not going to run out, right?”
“Honey. I always bring the dip,” said Oceania, and leaned over to kiss her on the cheek. Luna looked faintly pleased, although whether this was a result of the prospective dip or the display of affection was unclear.
Malfoy stared, like he wasn’t sure if it was a joke. Then he raked a hand through his hair, white and thin and no doubt greasy as ever, before looking back at Harry. He frowned.
She swallows and looks down, blinking back the heat in her eyes. It’s catching fire. The things inside of her are curling up as they burn.
Harry moans as Malfoy’s fingers find their way into her jeans, shoving roughly past the crotch of her pants, kneading the pad of her thumb into her clit, curling those long, cold fingertips so deep inside her she can barely breathe. She can barely breathe, and Malfoy crowds her back against the wall this time, a hand on her hip, smirking down at Harry. She leans in, as if for a kiss, and then bites Harry’s lip, tearing the skin, causing Harry to cry out and arch her back and for blood to drip down her chin and onto her chest. Malfoy moans, as if eating something delicious, and hikes Harry up so that her legs wrap around her waist, ankles crossed at her back. She kneads Harry’s ass with that hand, and Harry can tell she’s using the hand that’s working her as leverage too, because she’s pressing against the roof of her so hard that her manicured nails are digging in, digging right in and still curling and uncurling, and fuck, it’s uncomfortable, it
“I think,” she said, and she looked as serious as Oceania possibly could. “You have to understand that it wasn’t easy for Draco. It wasn’t easy at all. And I think…there was lot of fighting on his part. Whether or not anyone saw it. And so…he resents what he perceives to be…cowardice.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry snorted. “What should I have called her? The Butter Beast? The Vinegar Vatican? The Peanut Protestor?”
“It’s a festival!” Oceania exclaimed by way of explanation, and led them round to the side of the building. She walked over to the wall and extracted a brick. Then she began to pull out paperchains, like a magician with really long, colourful, papery rabbits.
Malfoy had gone still, and then he was metres away, fussing with used cups. “Why do you ask these things Potter?” he muttered, his voice low, and it was almost like he was talking to himself.
Actually, Harry hadn’t, but Malfoy was still looking away. Instead, Harry said, “I didn’t expect to see you here.”
“Blaise, I’m a lesbian,” said Luna, but she didn’t look put out. In fact, she was as close to rolling her eyes as Harry had ever seen her.
He supposed it didn’t matter too much. Harry was still jerking against him like something holy. It was exactly like everything he had read about. It was nothing like that. It was real. Harry was quieter than he had expected, and also smaller up close. He forgot that he was taller a lot of the time. It didn’t really matter though, if Harry was on top of him.
He couldn’t see Malfoy. Maybe he was in the bathroom. He dug the edge of the glass further into his skull.
“This is really good coffee,” Harry told the barista in the airport café. He was the only one there.
“Harry,” she said, and to his alarm her eyes were bright and shining as if she might cry again. “Maybe I…or maybe we don’t say this enough to each other, but – you are one of the most important people to us. To me. And I don’t want to have any unnecessary distance between us. Do you understand?”
“I read books, Draco,” he said pleasantly. Malfoy blinked hard at him, and then collected himself. Abashment turned to bemusement. And then mildly surprised amusement. It was fun to watch.
“She’s a walking trophy. Don’t give me those congenial platitudes.” Malfoy knocked back another glass. “I could marry her right now.”
“I tried really hard, you know,” Harry whispered. It was still dark out – but it had to be almost morning. They had fallen asleep on the sofa, still almost sitting up. Outside, he could hear birds singing.
When Draco came back, it was with a bottle of wine and two glasses. Harry laughed, swiftly hiding “The Hungry Caterpillar” down the side of the sofa. He watched as Draco poured them both glasses, and then drank deeply from his own. When he was done, there was a line of ruby liquid beading across his upper lip. His rubbed it away with the side of his thumb.
“So,” said Harry, as they trailed after Oceania and her hair. “Oceania’s got her persimmons, you’ve got your blue cheese…what’s Draco’s religion?”
“If it’s just Draco that doesn’t like magic,” Harry began to ask, “how come no one else almost never does as well?”
“You don’t give the impression of wanting to give anything at all,” he said quietly, and then tugged a knee up to wrap his arm around. “You just let people think what they do.”
The bartender was coming over. He had a long beard and an intimidating walk. When he got to their table he sat a beer down and looked up at Malfoy, one hand on his hip.
Malfoy looked up from the fishnets he’d been pretending to study and gave him a long, heated look that travelled from his toes to the tips of his hair.
“Listen,” he said a bit later to Charlie, as they were having lunch, “I feel like I need to confess something.”
Harry thought through it again. The sunlight felt like it was thickening around him, crystallising like uneaten honey. The air was cold where it bit.
“I got your letter,” Harry said once they were all seated and pretending that the tea was cool enough to sip at. They both looked up at him. He couldn’t meet their eyes.
Home country was a not a thing that existed. There was only this place, and the next, and the next, and one day it would destroy him. He was always observing life from behind windows.
“Hey,” they said. Their lips were quirked up to the side, a single eyebrow raised. Their hands were stuffed full of bags of colourful sand. “Haven’t seen you about for a while.”
But the relentless ache in his chest was still there. It was always there, and still, it didn’t get old. Pain was pain was pain was –
Malfoy didn’t flinch, but something about him hardened as he watched Harry struggle for the words. When it was apparent no more were coming, he said, “Why is that a bad thing to have been brave about?”
Malfoy instantly obliged, cheeks hollowing out like his life depended on it. His tongue kept working, swirling round and round, suckling at the tip, just like it was Harry’s real cock, just like he was trying to show Harry what it would be like.
“I’m a fun monk,” Tom said easily, and began to pour them all glasses. Hayden was looking at him in what could really only be described as suppressed awe, Harry noticed.
Pansy blinked blankly at him. Then she looked down at her octopus, digging into it with her chopsticks.
Draco looked at him. Then he looked away. He was about to lose his temper. He did not like to lose his temper at work.
“Yeah,” agreed Oceania. “It would.” She sighed happily and leaned against the door frame. “Maybe I’ll kiss Malfoy instead. He’s pretty too.”
Malfoy didn’t look at Harry as he drank. In fact, he barely drank, the purse of his mouth scarcely touching the rim of the bottle before he immediately swallowed. Then he brought it back down, and played with the glass neck in his hands. Harry watched as his own fingers overlapped each other.
If it hadn’t been him he would’ve laughed. But it was him, and the possibility of laughter got stuck just behind his teeth.
“I –” said Harry. He looked up over the fire, at the two people talking to each other on the logs, and didn’t finish.
That was okay. Harry had deliberately selected an easier path. Even so, after another five minutes, he asked, “You good?”
There were at least five pen-like areas, each complete with multi-coloured piles of lord knows what, spread out across the right side of what Harry supposed was the central area of the camp, each separated by vast stone walls. Within each was a dragon, chained by a collar around its throat, and as they came closer, Harry realised that the multi-coloured piles were in fact
Harry had broken a dragon out of Gringrotts. He had infiltrated the ministry when he was the most wanted man in the wizarding world. He had put a knife through a basilisk.
He broke off and licked his lower lip into his mouth, but it wasn’t an expression of envy. He seemed almost shy in his admiration of his friend.
Malfoy flushed as he put the paint palette down. “Oh,” he said, not looking at Harry. “I don’t know love. Why don’t you name the first one?”
Apparently, the outfits were representative of the “light” that replaced the “darkness.” Then there were more dancers, one in a blue mask and one with a beard, and then some red pills were handed out with wine, the latter of which Harry felt himself go a little queasy at and had to decline.
Harry didn’t look away. He thought about rolling his eyes. Instead, he said what he’d been thinking for a while.
He was lying flat on his back on the ground, panting, as the sounds of Charlie coaxing Jane back into her cage carried over to his resting place. Perhaps, he thought briefly, Hermione and Ron were right about him being crazy.
Touching her was not like how touching Draco had been. But the undercurrent of warmth was still there, grounding the ache of it. Childishly, Harry wished that he could touch and be touched all the time.
So he woke up early the next morning, and went by himself to the plaza. There, he unravelled the mat, smoothing out then creases. It was cool underneath his fingers.
Now, he heard Malfoy shuffle on the grass next to him, and he was pretty sure Malfoy was on side, looking at him. He didn’t dare open his eyes.
“It’s a cultural thing,” Hermione had said. “Dragons have always been a significant part of Asian folklore. In fact, many Chinese communities used to worship dragon gods. It’s really very interesting. If only our education hadn’t been so Western-centric, we would have been exposed to a lot more magical diversity. Really, when you think about it, Hogwarts has lots of areas for improvement…”
“Okay,” said Osh easily, and plucked his coffee cup from his hands to down the dregs. Draco watched her. All love did was rob him.
Hayden smiled at Harry and got up too, and then they were trudging through the trees, back to the cafeteria, back to the hotel, until Harry was alone once again.
“Urm,” said Malfoy. His eyes were wide. Oceania grinned shark-like at him, and then lunged, making obnoxious kissing noises. He cowered in the corner, batting her with the makeup bag, but it was clearly just for show. Eventually she got an arm around him and placed a large, wet-sounding smack against his cheek.
Harry felt himself flush. A quick glance at Draco assured that he was also a) flushed, and b) refusing to look in Harry’s direction.
“Malfoy,” Harry laughed, pulling at his wrists. “God, sorry. It’s not a big – come on, it’s just me, it’s not like I’m judging you.”
Then, ever so slightly, she nudged at his hand. Just a little. Barely enough to feel it. But he did. Her scales were smooth under his skin.
“No.” Malfoy turned back to him with hard eyes. “What’s not fair is you punishing yourself for being human.”
Pink blossomed in Draco’s cheeks. Harry hadn’t realised how much he’d missed it. Strange that it could feel like so long since Harry had had him pressed up against the island, on the edge of orgasm. Draco fumbled, fingers curling into Harry’s t-shirt. Harry pulled it off.
“Hmm.” Oceania looked up from her notebook, where it looked like she was drawing up plans for either more tea cosies, or possibly a castle. She followed his gaze to where he was staring at one of the cafeteria chefs, who was blond, square-jawed, and inexplicably dressed in a skin-tight shirt that had rips around his biceps. “Oh, sure. That’s Johnny. He’s tender.”
Harry looked at Malfoy again, betrayed. Malfoy had finally looked up, and he blinked away from Harry’s stare a little guiltily.
Malfoy’s eyes flickered up to meet his, weighted under his lashes. They were soaked in sunlight, in a way that reminded Harry of honey on toast.
Malfoy laughed, a freeing sound, and turned his attention to where Oceania was busy unpacking the bags. He frowned.
“You can’t tell Mum about this,” said Charlie wrapping the bandage around Harry’s arm. Oceania sighed and pushed him out the way, wrapping it much more firmly.
I’m in love with a crazy person, Draco realises suddenly, her heart catching desperately in her throat. I’m in love with someone clinically unstable.
“When have I ever said that?” said Harry, and now he sounded annoyed, and god, that really was a thousand times worse than all the other things. It made something in Draco crumple in on himself. He stood taller and tried not to show it.
in that way, would feel good. But the truth of it was that, in a very real way, it was incredibly uncomfortable. He felt as if his skin was crawling. He couldn’t understand it.
Malfoy did meet him in the cafeteria. Harry was sitting there, wondering, not for the first time, where it even was that Malfoy lived, when Malfoy appeared walking towards him.
The wind was not so readily admitting defeat. It seemed intent on revealing Malfoy’s pointy hip-bones and belly-button to the entire world, despite his fluttering hands. Harry said, “I didn’t know you had a dragon.”
Harry was inexplicably nervous, which was of course perfectly ridiculous, as it was only Luna. But by now he was plenty used to the thousands of little fears which were embedded in his everyday life, so he simply focused on putting on his trench coat and getting himself there.
He took a moment to stop and just watch it all. Everything was so spread open, rich and lush in its muchness. The sight of the mountains, simultaneously huge and small beneath him, did strange things to Harry’s chest. This far up, they stopped looking like individual mountains and instead started looking like one continuous set of folds in the earth’s crust.
He didn’t know where he was going until he was almost there, and then he wondered how he hadn’t known.
Harry swayed a little on the spot. “Well. I’m sure Tom has other ways of teaching it. You…could ask him about it. And –”
“Come on,” Harry laughs as he tugs on Draco’s hands and causes him to tumble against him. Draco’s never seen him laugh so much before. “It’s dark. It’ll be even
“Done a good job tidying up the place. She and Neville spent the whole of yesterday painting and lifting.”
Out here, the grounds were so far out that they almost looked wild. The lake was something organic, pure and still and so pretty. He had stumbled upon it once during his walks and thought: here’s a lovely place to read. You could hardly see the Manor from here.
Hermione’s eyes were very wide. Her fingers were clutched tight around the tea cup, even though it really must be too hot. “Oh, that’s alright,” she squeaked in a small voice.
Harry had already slowed in anticipation of what Malfoy might say, but now he came to a stop. Breathed in carefully.
Harry was having trouble looking at Malfoy’s face. Maybe it was because the letter was just sitting there, in his lap, one of the corners resting in the cradle of his thumb, the other digging into one of huge blossoming flowers across his thigh.
“It’ll be the same, but now there’ll be actual homeless people pissing.” Draco says, but let’s Harry pull him down to the riverside.
But sometimes, if he was being honest with himself – and he was trying, he was trying so hard to be – he became aware of this restlessness inside of him, this merciless dissatisfaction with everything. And so although all these activities helped keep his mind of it, he couldn’t help but feel it was a surface solution, a surface game.
The indent was mostly gone, but there was still something tense about his posture, clearly fighting just beneath the skin. Harry let him battle it out a little longer, and then rubbed his thumb across his knuckles again. Malfoy’s lips touched each other faintly, and the indent disappeared completely.
The way he’d probably been looking at him his whole life, honestly. Seeing Malfoy all dressed up like this reminded Harry of a time when he’d still believed that Draco Malfoy was nothing but trouble. Harry could see it now – trouble – tucked up in the corner of his lips, tangled in his blackened eyelashes. Trouble. Malfoy took another sip.
The rational part of Harry, the part that could rise above the blue and still breathe, recognised how strange this was. It hung, suspended outside him, until the final wave peaked and crashed, and it was bearable to come back.
Malfoy met his eyes. He swallowed and looked away. There was a silence as he scratched at the short hair at the back of his head.
Harry put the knife down. Then he put his head down on the table with it. He should really, really stop getting drunk.
“This is an autocracy,” said Oceania, “Neither of you will ever taste anything but persimmons again.”
“It’s not –” said Harry, and then he paused. “Another day? Can we do training another day? Today isn’t –”
Malfoy laughed again. His head dropped onto his curled forearm and the laughter fell down into the valley of his thigh.
“It’s a gift,” said Malfoy. “I put the word in my mouth and imagine sucking cock as I take it back out.”
“Give me a leg up,” Oceania told them once they were underneath the archway. Draco immediately dropped onto one knee.
“You’re an absolute gem, Harry Potter,” Malfoy was saying, his voice warm and pleasant. He was close, his hands rubbing up and down Harry’s arms, slow. Harry’s gaze caught on the skin where Malfoy’s neck met his jaw, and got stuck.
Dragon-taming. Doesn’t he have – fuck, I don’t know – Auroring to do? Being famous? Being morally outstanding?”
“Oh, urm.” He took a step back, glancing cursively at the rack. “I, urm, don’t have strong feelings.”
“I was,” he said after a pause, and leaned on the closed cover of his notebook, “I just didn’t know that I had options.”
“Can I interest you in a coffee?” The bottle had a label on it that simply said in all-caps: VODKA 70%. Malfoy screwed off the cap in a flick of his wrist and poured a hefty amount into one of the cups.
Pansy raised her chin. “Do you?” she asked, drawing the sounds out. Harry felt incredibly aware of the silence from the rest of the table. He drank more whiskey.
Malfoy looked at him and the smile extended to the other half of his mouth. “Definitely not the bible.”
“Yes.” Harry swallowed. “You shouldn’t apologise if you meant them. If you…you should speak what you think. I wouldn’t want you to avoid telling me things because you didn’t want me to…to get angry or something.”
Malfoy uncurled his legs and leaned back. He raised a brow, indulgently. “And that makes me honest how?”
“Harry,” Malfoy said to the ankle. It was more breath than sound. He looked – not quite pained, but definitely not calm. Then he cleared his voice and looked up.
Pulling back, he threw off his jacket and shoved his trainers on. He was going to get out. He was going to get out, and then he would calm down, and it would be okay.
He breathed in. He breathed out. Then he got undressed and unpacked it all, very slowly. It took a long time as well, and exhaustion was a permanent resident in his bones, but he found that if he focused on the actions of it all, it was easier to keep going.
Harry opened his mouth to speak and then stopped. Closed it and swallowed. Malfoy was here, white and skinny and naked and still wet from walking into a loch at night and somehow, that all didn’t seem quite so significant. What he’d said had changed the way Harry looked at his expression.
Draco doesn’t expect Potter to come back the next day, but come back she does, with a different set of robes. These ones have red piping all down the sides.
And he chose Oceania because she seemed like the most diplomatic choice. Hayden he liked, but wasn’t quite close enough with yet to imagine living with, and Draco was –
“Sure.” Harry agreeing easily. It was possible he was a little drunk himself. “It’s definitely open for interpretation.”
Harry felt some of his playfulness drop. “I thought you weren’t mad at me anymore,” he said lowly, suddenly very aware of Oceania and Hayden watching.
“Well, now you’ve blown it,” said Oceania. She grinned with all her teeth. “I’m an undercover auror, and I’m putting you under arrest, sonny boy.”
“Are you,” Harry had to catch his breath. He felt like it’d been punched out of him. The ache in his eyes was long forgotten. “Are you seriously judging me right now?”
He ate. He cleaned his teeth. He got in bed. He read some more. Went to sleep, and eventually woke up.
Malfoy’s breath’s shallowed, his fingers twitching, and then he opened his eyes. The movement was strange after observing the veiny pale of his eyelids for so long. Malfoy’s eyes were very grey, and for a moment entirely expressionless, a result of the meditating. Harry watched as his conscious mind fully switched back on.
Jane huffed, more loudly. She shuffled on the ground in a way that looked a lot like annoyance to Harry.
“I’m just trying to understand,” said Harry, and then leaned forward, his thighs parting, his elbows coming to rest on his knees, his chin on his clasped hands. When his thighs parted, the sunlight slid over the curve of his knee and down into the nook of his crotch, gold catching on the ripples of fabric. Above his hands, his eyes were wide and open. Draco parted his mouth to speak – he could feel the air pass over his lips.
After a moment, he decided he wasn’t going to throw up. Probably. For now, at least. He steadied himself weakly, and then kept walking.
Then he went through to the living room. When he got home, the first thing he liked to do was evening yoga. It kept him going through the sunset, which he could see through the window. It was beautiful, but he always felt so lonely at this time. To the point where it almost wasn’t painful.
but rather the walls and dust and ground and he felt aware that it had been built by people and that Tom came here every day and that Malfoy had met Tom before. He was awake.
There was the sound of more unfolding. Harry thought he felt a hand hover over his shoulder, but then it was gone, and maybe he’d just thought it because he wanted it so bad.
He eventually came to a tall, unstable looking building that was covered entirely with painted green tiles that looked like they might all come sliding down at any minute. He blinked, and then pushed on the heavy door, finding himself inside a dingy little room, lit by flickering lamps and draped with patterned scarves. There was no furniture save for a broken wooden stool in the corner, and reception desk, behind which sat a blonde woman with bows in her hair. She looked up at Harry, and frowned.
And then he was dancing. Slowly, slowly. He tried to let himself into it, but he couldn’t help the prickles of self-consciousness that rose out of his skin like goose-bumps. Still, he tried. It was good here, with the music and the people and the friendly weight of alcohol, and it was better with Malfoy, who was dancing and smiling at Harry at the same time now.
Oceania straightened up then and leaned over far enough to smack Malfoy on the arm and snag the bottle in one. “I said to leave him
Malfoy swallowed with difficulty and looked away. The wind was catching on his fringe, running playful fingers through it.
Then the monks came out. They were dressed in yellow robes, complete with a huge, glorious, curling yellow head piece.
It was a long time before he left the loch. He went back to his hotel room. He looked at his suitcase for a long time, before re-packing it so everything fit. Then he went to sleep. It was a restless sleep, and he woke three hours later.
Draco pressed his cheek against the head rest. He hadn’t stopped smiling yet. “Fine,” he said. “The lady sitting on my right spent the whole flight knitting. We got talking and then she showed me how to make a circle scarf. It was very educational.”
“You should see yourself,” repeats Harry, thrusting. “The whole world should get to see Draco fucking Malfoy, on her back with her legs in the air, getting fucked by the bitch she swore she wouldn’t touch.”
In the kitchen/lounge/hallway, he wandered aimlessly, knocking his knuckles against the various surfaces. Eventually he wound up by the coffee machine again and decided to make a cup. He went through all the various phases again.
“Are you – do you want sugar?” she managed to get out, gulping as she pushed her curls out of her face. Her cheeks and eyes were bright.
“He’s one of the monks,” said Hayden. “He’s the only wizard though, so that’s why he stays up here. But he visits the others regularly. Gives us good connections.”
Ginny and Harry haven’t exactly ended it, per say. They still love each other. There just isn’t…too much…sexual energy.
Harry shrugged. He began to turn the beads in his hand, rhythmically rubbing the wood over bone in his thumb.
He let his legs fall into a basket and straightened his back. Rested his hands on his knees and closed his eyes. Meditation posture.
“Here,” said Draco, and then he moved back, and Harry’s glasses were being placed carefully atop the frame of his face. He blinked, and everything came into sharp focus.
Pansy’s lips drew into a tight purse, as if she’d said more than she’d have liked. Harry stared at her. A length of her black hair blew across her pale cheek, and she didn’t brush it back.
Malfoy crossed his arms over the jacket so that only the “rock for you” was visible. “What’s a name?” he muttered pettily.
Harry realised, belatedly, that the moment was slipping him by. “Wait,” he said. “I actually meant to ask you. I forgot to get video footage last time.”
So he told her. About the blue and the pain in his chest and the restlessness – and about the need to escape, that had taken him all the way to the Himalayas. And she nodded a lot and told him that his symptoms were normal and then asked, very calmly: “And tell me Harry, did you feel like you had escaped once you got to the Himalayas?”
“Speaking of which,” Oceania blithely continued, “You will keep coming to the yoga class, won’t you?”
“Malfoy,” she says looking up, and then her eyes go rounder, and her brows drop lower. “Malfoy,” she says again. “Can I – come in?”
“Sometimes,” was what she said instead. Her voice was quieter than it had been all evening. “I suppose every few months, if that’s what you mean by often.”
“I don’t think so,” murmured Oceania from where her head was on his lap. Her eyes were closed. He looked down and ran his fingers through her monstrous black hair.
“Thank you,” he said anyway, and hung his coat around the back of his chair. “Can I get you anything to drink?”
Mayo made a whale-like sound of grievance as Malfoy shrugged him off and squatted in front of the bag again. It stared after him, longingly, before turning its baleful eyes on Harry.
Harry cleared his throat again and then leaned back. “Alright,” he said. “My point is, I’m not, like, a professional or anything. I’m not a monk. This is – just how I do it.”
Malfoy glanced over. His skin was shiny, catching the sunlight, and his hair had plastered down to his forehead in places. Ruddiness flourished across his flesh like flowerets, saturated especially in the parted set of his mouth.
He got up and cleaned his teeth thoroughly. Then he washed his face. It felt good, so he decided to have a shower. It was so much better showering in your own bathroom. He let the water drip over his face, felt it rake down through his black hair. As he scrubbed his skin, it occurred to him that perhaps it was a deeper brown than before.
Harry tried to stay in the quiet dark this time. Tom had just spoken. He was right here. He thought about his thoughts as clouds, but he wasn’t even sure what counted as a thought anymore. Either way, he tried to detach. Not detach. Just, stay afloat.
“That’s what you said the last time when you sprinkled blue cheese over the fire-walk,” said Charlie, “I feel like you’re just making these up. I don’t even know where you got the blue cheese.”
“It’s okay to be gay,” sang Malfoy, who by now had arranged his body into a lounging position across the log. He winked at Harry.
“He’s Harry,” he said, and then cleared his throat again, at once exasperated. “Harry Potter. You know Harry Potter, Tom.”
Harry’s hand was still resting on Malfoy’s chest. Malfoy turned his head, and his eyes were searching.
He made a cup of coffee. It wasn’t very sensible, considering that it was the evening, but there was a slightly fancy coffee machine that someone had probably bought for him once and that he’d never really used. Abruptly, he found that he wanted to be in the kitchen. He wanted to use it.
“Ah yes,” said Zambini, smirking. “The most grievous burden of the rich. Having too much time on one’s hand.”
Harry didn’t open his eyes. He just smiled. “I don’t know. They make me feel free. Like I can breathe bigger, I s’pose.”
Malfoy nodded. He was still looking down at where Harry was seated. Harry patted the grass beside him.
“Okay,” he said, and then he turned and went, his long, pale back moving away from Harry, away and away, walking back to where he had come from.
“Hey,” he said when he was within hearing distance. Oceania offered a bowl of porridge to him. “No, I’m good thanks. Harry, can I talk to you for a second?”
“I left.” Draco’s eyes flickered towards him, but they remained ambivalent. “You don’t think it was going to be heroic, did you? My father still doesn’t know where I am.” Another sip. “Don’t try to be proud of me, Harry Potter.”
The day after, Potter has a handful of forget-me-nots in her hand. “Potter?” says Draco, frowning when she opens the door.
“Nothing,” said Harry. He dropped his eyes, only to find that although he could avoid the disapproving gaze of Charlie, he could not avoid the disapproving gaze of the many, many fluffy bathrobe dragons.
“It’s easier to imagine two boys dating.” says Harry quietly. “I…find it easier to imagine dating a man than a girl.”
“Yeah,” she repeated, grinning. “But I just thought that was like…a universal thing. That, like, everyone thought girls were hot. Cus’ they are.”
He was. Malfoy had been pink-cheeked before – but not like this. Now, Malfoy’s entire face had lit up like a stunning charm, his pale skin no match for the brilliant crimson of his embarrassment.
“Oh,” said Harry. He felt like a teenager being told that his extended family were coming to visit for a week, and that he was going to have to share his room with a cousin he hadn’t talked to in years. Not that he personally knew what that felt like.
“Fuck you,” he said, but it didn’t come out angry, like he wanted it to. He met Malfoy’s gaze. Malfoy blinked at him like he was just seeing him.
“Draco,” says Harry again, looking alarmed, a hand on her shoulder. “Draco, please, tell me what’s wrong, why are you crying, why are you like this-“
“Slowly, bring yourself back up,” said Oceania. Her voice was softer and quieter during the yoga sessions than any other time. “Take your time.”
“Better,” said Harry, and Malfoy’s pink little mouth fell open. His breath was coming quick now, his tongue darting out to lick anxiously at his thin lower lip. Harry wanted to stretch it thinner.
“I mean,” she said. “Is it even possible to know yourself? What is identity? Everything is fluid, always changing. All you ever get is close. Close or far. Distance is the only variable.”
Malfoy was there, and he was frowning, looking at Harry as though he’d never seen him from this angle before. Cautious, and intensely curious. Harry inhaled and exhaled, and then he slumped forward. Malfoy caught him just in time. They were crumpled on the kitchen floor.
Draco bucks up, her broken exhale loud in the room, and then Harry is kissing her again, and Harry is taking off her trousers and reaching inside her, and all Draco can do is buck and moan and gasp and rub her hands against Harry’s hips and stomach and wherever else, and all she can see is Harry, the shape of her, the slope of her face, her beautiful eyes – and all she can think is sweet, my love, harder, please, Harry – and when she comes, mouth an open wound, bleeding the gibberish of intimacy – everything is green.
And then the beautiful mirror-surface of the lake went crashing through the night, and Harry Potter was there, and he was frantic, absolutely mad with it, trying to bundle up Draco like he was a child, like something awful was happening. And at the time, Draco couldn’t understand. He couldn’t understand. He couldn’t understand.
The sunrise was beautiful in the quiet of the cafeteria area, unfolding itself into the inevitable blue. Harry got a bowl of rice and fish from a table lying out at the end of the area, and watched the sleeping dragons as he ate alone.
“Yeah,” breathed Harry, and took a step back. He almost couldn’t think with the relief of it. Not relief. It was something similar, though. “Yeah, I did.”
He had been too pre-occupied with Malfoy that time to really pay attention to the dragon. But he looked at it now, where it was standing just a few feet in front of Draco. The first thing about it was that it was entirely white. Its skin was milky – an almost off colour, milk that had been left out too long, really – and its eyes were pink around the edges, a hue of just-finished-crying. Harry didn’t even know if dragons could cry. Maybe they did, if their tamers were Malfoy.
“Come here,” said Harry, and then grabbed his hips, mostly just to grab his hips, and then thought about it some more and grabbed his ass as well.
Right now he was reading some contemporary stuff. It was slow-paced, but he didn’t mind. He read fast anyway. The sun went down.
Desire made urgency. Harry’s hand skated along the side of Draco’s body unsteadily until it found a hem – then pushed up, bunching it. There was skin. There was a lot of it. It was all warm, and Harry was allowed, allowed it. His hips rose, fell, unplanned.
“It’s okay if you’re afraid,” said Draco. He was walking beside Harry, a colourful presence moving through the abundance of green. He had been looking ahead as he said it, eyes following the upcoming forest floor, as if this was a casual thing that he could just say to Harry. Maybe it was.
“Are you sure that’s what you need right now?” Hermione’s eyebrows were practically shaking hands, she was frowning so deep. “Are you sure you’re not just…”
Harry felt his face light up. Next to him, Draco said, “God forbid the mandala of kindness have homoerotic undertones.”
“You’re a virgin in terms of life experience,” said Oceania, “But I understand. Fighting wars is very time-consuming.”
But the thing about reality was that it didn’t care whether or not you believed in it. It kept on happening anyway. There was nothing to be gained by standing there in his kitchen contemplating it.
Harry looked over. Leaning there, all cool shrewdness against the wall of the pen, Draco looked more slytherin than Harry had ever seen him since coming here. He raised his chin a little further, narrowing his eyes. Harry licked his lips.
“I hope you choke on your cheese,” said Oceania, and then pushed the trolley towards the conveyer belt.
Malfoy breathed in, and his eyes stopped flickering. Harry could imagine it now, the detachment that accompanied it, the way the conscious became a suspended thing, floating in the darkness of the skull. He imagined his own space, hollowed out amidst the bone structure, a cradle to settle his presence in. This would be so much easier if he could somehow accompany Malfoy. But that would be too intimate, much too intimate.
“I thought I apologised for that,” said Harry. He was frowning, suddenly, like he’d lost his footing, and seeing him like any fight left in Draco dissolve, easy as butter in a pan.
He always tried to meditate at this time. Align with the rising sun. But he was always a turbulent thing, bobbing on the surface of reality, always trying to sink a little deeper in.
“Tell me more about this inhibited business,” said Harry, and held out his hand. It was a firm, masculine hand. Draco looked, for only a beat.
There wasn’t exactly anywhere to sit on the bed. Harry pushed a breastplate to the side and perched next to the bedside table.
Harry looked up at the person. He suddenly realised that he couldn’t tell if they were a man or a woman.
“I’ll see you around,” Malfoy said. He was looking right at him. Had he been looking right at him this entire time?
“I never do,” said Luna simply, and ordered the olives. Pansy looked on approvingly. Then, once the olives were ordered, she turned back to Harry.
Oceania sat down next to him. When he opened his eyes, she was smiling, radiant. When Oceania smiled it was a natural thing too, a simple expression of complete happiness. Simple looked good on Oceania. When Oceania was happy, it was like she was giving you something, instead of taking.
Malfoy moved like something was growing inside of him. It was so expressive, in a way that Harry almost felt envious of.
A small snort from behind him jolted Harry around. Jane was looking at him sceptically, if a dragon could be sceptical. Harry glared at her.
Luna kept looking at him. “You know,” she said, after a moment. “I still think you could really like Pansy and Blaise. You didn’t get a good impression of her, I think, the other night.”
Harry took Malfoy back to the Green Hotel, and Malfoy didn’t complain. Malfoy didn’t say a lot actually, besides a hurried “Thank you,” when Harry held the door open for him. The receptionist wasn’t there, as usual. The stairs creaked as they climbed.
Another flick and bonds come up and wrap themselves over Harry’s limbs, holding her in place. She struggles to catch her breath, head ringing.
There was something else to be said, he knew, but he didn’t have the vocabulary for it just yet. Or, no, he didn’t have the courage. Or, no, it was the knowledge. It was the knowledge he didn’t have.
“Collect souvenirs of your adventures. A volcanic rock here, a limpet shell there, a fridge magnet to top it all off. You must see some worldly sights. Whatever did happen with the men on Mount Earnest?”
“Yes,” said Malfoy, “But –” He sucked in a breath, seeming entirely too pleased with how the entire situation was turning out. “He was the youngest seeker in a century!
“So,” he heard Blaise saying, and there was movement in his peripheral vision. “You asked me to tell you about my spiritual awakening.”
Harry felt more aware of his body, of the way it moved. He let Draco take the lead – after all, he still knew more. He watched the arc of his body as he turned over into flipped dog; the gentle incline of his pale stomach, the sculpted jut as his hips pushed up. He watched and he followed. Felt it in himself.
She shook her head. The movement was exaggerated, slowed down in his mind. It was the drug. It was beautiful. He didn’t fight it.
“Yes.” Malfoy nodded, still looking at Harry like he was a strange specimen of dragon, and then frowned and turned back around, continuing up the path.
There was a few beats where they just stared each other, both red-skinned and wide-eyed. Then Harry felt the warmth drip down his jaw, and realised he was crying again. He brought his hand to his face.
“I don’t know yet,” said Malfoy, his eyes still quite wide, “I’m still processing. It’s a bit much.”
“Potter,” he sneered, fitting so much derision into the word as if to make up for the last few years of git-freedom, “Nice to see you here.”
Luna eyed him up and down. Even though he knew she was gay, it still made him feel even more aware of his toplessness. “As soon as possible,” she told him.
Harry closed his eyes for a brief moment, and then took an extraordinarily long sip of coke. Even Oceania was trying not to laugh. She was trying to hide it, but he could see her, biting down on the edge of her glass and shaking.
“It’s quite alright.” Malfoy made a movement as if to pat his hand and then seemed to think better of it. His fingers fluttered awkwardly between them. “Let me put this is in a way you can understand: I’m free next Thursday at quarter to one.”
Harry had never sat down and thought to herself: I might not be straight. Of course she was straight. Because straight didn’t mean liking boys – it meant normal. And Harry had had her fair share of abnormality, thank you very much. So she was straight.
As he looked down, he felt a single bead of sweat roll down from the top of his forehead, riding down over the bridge of his nose. For a moment it hesitated on the tip there, crystalline, and then it splashed down onto the mat. Harry watched as it did.
“What were you saying?” Malfoy mumbled into Harry’s shirt. He smelt like vodka, and the slow unfurling of petals.
“Good,” said Harry, and then – “Keep looking,” because he was pushing two fingers into Malfoy’s mouth.
Harry had been running from himself, and now he had stopped. But maybe stopping wasn’t enough. Maybe he had to start going in the other direction.
Harry followed her direction to where a white letter was balanced precariously on top of an empty yoghurt pot. The handwriting on the front was neat.
Harry shifted, trying to squeeze around the sense of failure, and looked at Jane. She was staring back at him, her eyes black and deep and round. Unusually patient. How long had it been? A month and a half? Surely, by now, he should feel like he knew her. But he stared right back at her, and couldn’t see past the round of her eyes. In the centre, when the light hit her right, there were flecks of blue buried inside. A dark blue, almost navy. He hadn’t noticed before.
After the war, he had moved north. He had bought a flat. He hadn’t wanted to stay in Grimmauld Place. It was too full of memories. There had been something brimming in him, asking for a new start. He had wanted to live a new sort of life.
Then Harry asked them both about their work, and let them catch him up on all that he had missed in the last few months. Ron’s promotion, Hermione’s charity work. When they talked about it, it wasn’t like so much time had passed after all.
When he came back out, he stood there with the plate and contemplated his options. Then he spotted Draco in the distance.
He began to laugh, felt her join in from where she was shaking on his lap. Once he’d started, he found he couldn’t stop.
“I don’t dislike Blaise,” Harry admitted quietly. “Or Pansy. I…shouldn’t have said some of the things I did the other night.”
“You do this every day?” he asked, shuffling forward onto his knees. Oceania stretched her arms, scratching her ear against her shoulder.
Harry stared at him like he was a unicorn, which only made the burning worse. “How…” he said, and then opened and closed his mouth. “How am I being insensitive?”
Benjamin pointed between the two of them with a lip gloss applicator. “Should I leave you two alone?”
“We correspond quite frequently. Sometimes, I even go up to his little cottage-y thing to visit him. Such wonderful things I’ve heard about you, Harry Potter.”
“It’s not like I’m leaving you!” Harry’s voice was incredulous. “It’s not like…why are you acting like this is, this is…so personal?”
There. From his peripheral vision, he watched a finger on Malfoy’s right hand jump.  One was seated on his knee, and the other was steadied on the ground. Harry wondered why it was people were only allowed to touch when they hurt.
“Now now,” tuts Malfoy. “If I wanted to fuck a straight boy, I wouldn’t be having this conversation in the first place.”
“I suppose it depends what you mean, Harry. Is it wrong to rely on other people entirely, to the point where your life revolves solely around them? I think so. But do people need other people? I think so, too. It’s part of being human, don’t you agree?”
Harry looked over his shoulder. The sun was catching his eyes, but it fucking always was. “Are you coming?”
An indent had formed between Malfoy’s brows. Harry brought him back to himself quickly. “Don’t fight them, either,” he added. “It’s normal to get distracted. For everything you’ve being worrying about to rush to the surface. Just recognise it for what it is, and let it go.”
“I just don’t get what I’m doing wrong,” said Harry for the third time that afternoon. He sounded like a child. Draco tried very, very hard to fight against the instinct to feel
“Why don’t you tell us about that?” asked Luna. She put a hand on Blaise’s arm, which had been creeping forward on the table as he slowly leaned towards Harry. Predictably, he reached for it and gave it a very, very light kiss, before smiling wickedly. Luna really rolled her eyes.
Draco pulled off his satchel. As it hit the floor, Jane’s eyes opened. They were a deep blue, but they seemed almost black from this angle. She watched the two men approaching.
Malfoy was looking at him, his eyes bright, and bit down on his lip. His shoulders began to shake again.
“Come here,” said Oceania. She leaned over from where she was curled up to his right and pulled him down from under Charlie’s arm, kissing him soundly on the cheek. “It’s obvious, but it should still be said – we’re going to miss you.”
“Harry.” Charlie sat down next to Harry and put his hand on his knee. He was using his low, “soothing” voice. “I heard you had a fight with Draco.”
“Jane,” he said casually, as if he was asking her to pass the salt. “Could you sit down for a moment love? It’d piss Mr. Bad Hair Day here off so bad.”
Malfoy appeared closer with a glass of water. His lips moved strangely, plumping up in the middle and then flattening out at the sides. A smirk, Harry realised. He stared.
“I’m sorry,” said Harry. It didn’t take a psychotherapist to realise that Hayden was a pretty private person. “You and Oceania, you’re close?”
“Draco,” Harry began again, feeling in his tone. Draco looked at the wall. It was coming. He was going to let it come. “I…”
Harry frowned. He unlocked the handcuffs. Malfoy didn’t wait for him to take them off fully – he was already up, putting space between them. There were red indentations at the corners of his mouth. He’d been biting down.
And then the restlessness got so bad sometimes that he would find his heart beating quickly for no reason at all, and he couldn’t stop shaking and or worrying, and he wouldn’t be able to do any of the things he was supposed to. And then when that happened he found himself feeling empty – and that feeling was rather like the blue.
“Of course,” said Draco. “But I was also still incredibly susceptible to vanity and flattery, and so I cricket-fucked a lot of those girls. I couldn’t help it. They kept telling me how toned my little cricket legs looked in the moonlight.”
“I feel like this isn’t the sort of thing people are supposed to sit in silence about,” Harry said eventually.
“Mm.” Oceania opened her eyes. The sunlight almost seemed to shine through them, reminding Harry that eyes were not flat things, but liquid spheres. “He would.”
Oceania sent them a quick glare. “That’s the white gaze talking,” she said sternly, and then got back to the whispering.
Was it possible to be simultaneously uncomfortable and comfortable in your own skin? Harry glanced over at Malfoy. He was leaning back against where the glass of the shower door curved out, the bag still clutched in one hand and his jaw tilted up. His eyes were liquid.
“I will not,” Draco protested in a rather higher pitch that was ideal, and wrapped his legs around Harry. Harry hoisted him higher. Merlin, he could really feel
“Draco,” Harry said helplessly. Mayo had wound its way into his arms, somehow, and was now pressed against in what could only be reasonably described as a hug.
Draco blinked down at him. They watched as he walked away and went back behind the bar. He started blasting “Just Dance”. Slowly, but surely, the rest of the pub went back to talking amongst themselves.
“I didn’t really need you for anything,” said Luna dreamily as she poured milk into two cups with tassels on them. “I just thought the gardening would be good for your depression.”
Delia turned her head to face him in the manner of a possessed doll. “But Harry,” she said, “the article is finished.”
Maybe it was the new place. He got dressed and went outside, stood on the plane that overlooked the cafeteria and the mountain-tops and the dragons. The air was cold and blue, biting at his cheeks, pulling at his clothes. He didn’t want to go back inside.
Once they had sat down at opposite sides of the table, Malfoy leaned forward and rested his cheek on his palm. “Any plans for this afternoon?”
“I’d like to know, too,” said Harry, mimicking Malfoy’s posture. It was possible he was…quite drunk. “I think.”
“Fucking nice Harry,” said Hayden, and when Harry looked up they were grinning appreciatively. He met Oceania’s eye and she winked at him, raising her glass. The sudden rush of love filled up his lungs on his next inhale, and he was suddenly so grateful, so immensely grateful for these people and this village and this truth, and he thought maybe he was going to cry, which was awfully embarrassing and cliché.
Harry snorted. So Pansy Parkinson was somehow involved- he couldn’t bring himself to be surprised. After the dust had settled from the war, she’d owled him wanting to meet, he’d gone out of morbid curiosity, and while she’d clearly intended to make a show of apologizing to him in a public location, she ended up bursting into tears midway through, dragging him into a broom cupboard at the Leaky Cauldron, and weeping onto his shoulder for a while, before making a more private, but much more sincere apology, and then threatening to hex him if he ever revealed her indiscretion, as she called it. Now they meet up for drinks in muggle London every few weeks and bitch about whatever is going on in their lives, but Malfoy clearly isn’t aware of this. Although, she’s never said anything about Malfoy to Harry either, so she’s obviously been keeping things from him as well.
“Ok, so look, maybe it wasn’t entirely accidental, but really, it’s harmless. Honestly, wouldn’t you rather have your face on a sweet little kneazle than on a bath towel? Or those bags of popcorn that has the kernels popping into the shape of your head? Kneazles are sweet and intelligent creatures, very brave, it’s really a compliment when you think about it. And also, it’s not your whole face, just a couple key features, really. And honestly, it would have been easy to make some sort of commentary about your hair, hair lengthening charms are a snap, and I’m sure I could have worked out for it to stand up on end, but really, I didn’t, and so there’s very clearly no need to be mad!” Draco gave a thin smile with those last words, clearly not believing them even as he spoke them.
“There, there, kitten, it will be alright. We’re going to find out where you- ow! Bloody fucking hell!”
They got a few good moments of laughter in before Rowena decided that she’d had quite enough of this, and did not appreciate being shackled to a laughing maniac. Harry learned of her displeasure through the form of sharp,  needle-like teeth sinking into the soft meat of his hand. With a yelp, Harry let go of both cats, and then, realizing that he’d tried to drop them in front of their owner, tried to scramble madly after them, still giggling to himself.
Don't forget to check out the awesome art still!! It's so perfect, I love it. Anyway, enjoy chapter 11!
At his words, she let out a plaintive cry, which he did his best to ignore as he stepped into the floo, calling out for Grimmauld Place. It was for the best, he told himself. He didn’t have time for a pet. His long hours at work kept him much too busy for anything of the sort.
Stunned, Harry looked up, trying to make sense of it all, only to remember that he was at Malfoy Manor, and that Draco Malfoy was right in front of him, so looking up meant eye contact with Malfoy.
“Yes, Master Harry? Does he be having a task for poor Kreacher? Master Harry is looking far too thin, oh yes, so Kreacher is working most diligently on soup, of course, of course. But perhaps Master Harry knows better than Kreacher, and thinks something is more important than his well being and nutrition?”
Harry groaned. He was so not ready for this, but his Gryffindor bravery did not fail him, and he stepped fully into the room, and prepared to have a conversation with Ron about his feelings. Uggh.
“Well Potter, in that case I suppose a thank you is in order. Please, see yourself out through the floo, and do keep us in mind if you ever have any kneazle-related needs,” said Malfoy in a brusque voice. He scooped up Chrysanthemum, and stood waiting for Harry to floo away.
Harry yelped, drew his hand back into his chest, and did an ungainly sort of roll onto his chest to see who he had just inadvertently touched. As far as he knew, Grimmauld Place was still heavily warded- no one should be allowed to gain entrance without his knowledge, and none of the people who had access had said they were coming over this evening.
“So,” said Ron, who had listened with great patience as Harry had struggled to explain what he’d just experienced, “Malfoy spilled his guts to you, apologized, and then invited you to a fancy kneazle party. You said yes, and then panicked, and flooed straight here. That sound about right?”
“Hey girl,” he said, keeping his voice quiet. He didn’t really know how to talk to cats (kneazles) but he figured a soft voice couldn’t hurt. “It’s nice to see you too. How are you today?” Her only response was an intensification of her purring, and continued rubs on his face. He smiled, and stroked a finger down her back. He hadn’t really touched her before, not when he was paying attention, and he was startled at how soft she was. She had the tiniest dusting of hair over her soft, warm skin, and the way it stretched over her body felt weird, yet familiar. It was like a hot peach, or a piece of suede, or….
“Hush, Potter, I’m getting there. Anyway. The raccoon was particularly adorable, even if they did try to get into my trash, and I quite enjoyed watching them. I saw about seven of them up in a tree one night, and my lumos glinted off their eyes, and they have these cute little masks that cover their eyes, and anyway, I was quite charmed.” Malfoy took a sip of tea, and continued with his story, growing more confident as he spoke.
He was cut off by a frantic wailing and squirming from the cat in his arms, who at this point had gotten a good look at Harry and the kitten. The gray cat launched herself out of Malfoy’s arm directly at Harry’s face.
“Kreacher, I promise you, if I was going to get a kitten, I would let you know. But it’s not mine. I didn’t know it was here. I didn’t even know it was a kitten, remember? I thought it might have been, er. You know,” said Harry, cheeks heating as he remembered his earlier mistake.
Kreacher considered this, and appeared to accept it. He seemed to shrug, and then Harry felt the crackle in the air again that always heralded house elf apparition.
Hermione frowned, and fixed Harry with a pointed stare. Her dark eyes were narrowed, and her voice was full of disapproval, but she answered nonetheless.
“Malfoy, how does your vacation have anything to do with why at least two cats are now wearing my face?” Harry interrupted, again. He’d asked for an explanation, and Malfoy was just confusing him with his talk of Minnesota and loons and moose and raccoons. Harry wasn’t entirely certain what a loon even was, other than an unkind name for someone not all there.
The kitten had decided that she was tired of being held, and had bitten Harry sharply on the hand, causing him to let go. When he let go, she promptly scaled his arm, digging what felt like hundreds of sharp, tiny needles through his robes and into his flesh. She managed to get all the way to his shoulder, where she seemed to be content to perch and nuzzled the side of Harry’s face, just a little bit. Then, ignoring Harry’s continued cursing, she curled up into a small ball, and went to sleep.
“Er, no, thank you, I ah, actually was hoping you could help me with something else,” said Harry. “You see, this kneazle just kind of, er, showed up in my house, and I was hoping you might recognize her, or know where she came from. You said the hairless ones were new? Do you know who breeds them?”
There was a crackle in the air, and then with a loud pop, Kreacher apparated into the living room, still holding a ladle and bringing the scent of French Onion Soup with him. He gave Harry the odd squinting expression that Harry had learned (through some misunderstandings) was a sort of exasperated fondness.
Eventually, Malfoy got tired of delaying with the tea things, or perhaps just ran out of possible tasks, and sat back into the cushy armchair, still nervous. His expression became more anxious as one of the two black cats with unusual markings (Harry’s brain rebelled at the idea of using the word “Potteazle,” even in the confines of his own head) had followed them over, and jumped into Malfoy’s lap, butting up at his hands with its uniquely marked face.
For the second time in less than a day, Harry flooed into Malfoy Manor. This time, not distracted by a tiny kitten on his shoulder, and having had several hours to get used to the idea of Malfoy as a kneazle breeder, he was able to take a good look around.
“Hermione,” Harry breathed, excited. “Of course! If anyone knows what to do with a random hairless kneazle kitten, it will be her.”
An enormously fat, fluffy gray cat was cradled in Malfoy’s arms like a baby, purring loud enough that Harry could hear it across the room. With every step he took, she would reach up and bat at his chin, as if to chastise him for disturbing her repose, and with every touch of her paw, Draco Malfoy would glance down, and his eyes would crinkle up at the corners, just hinting at a smile.
The kneazle kitten was grooming him, sharp little tongue dipping in and out of her mouth as she rasped her tongue over the side of his face. Satisfied that his sideburn was clean, she clambered around onto the front of his robes, clinging to his chest and head butting his chin, before beginning an enthusiastic cleaning of his adam’s apple.
“Yeah, that’s fine, I’m ready to take the responsibility for that. Hey, want to grab lunch before you go?”
“Yeah, ok, Chrysanthemum, just wanted to apparate across the room and, what, missed? And ended up in my living room?” Harry’s voice was incredulous.
He arrived in the bustle of the auror’s office, which was already in full swing. Interdepartmental memos flew through the air, floo fires flared green around the edges of the room, and the low hum of conversation filled the air.
Malfoy’s tone was smooth and unemotional, but Harry did not miss the crinkle in the corner of his eye, and the twitch at the side of his mouth as he looked at the purring kneazle (Potteazle) in his lap, and the other still sleeping in the floating wool orb. Despite himself, Harry found it rather… sweet, that Malfoy had had to bottle feed two kittens, and then been unable to sell them off. It was obvious he cared for them a great deal. Which did not entirely make up for him putting Harry’s face on a bunch of cats (kneazles), but it was still rather sweet.
Draco strode into the room like he owned the place (which he did, Harry reminded himself, they were in Malfoy Manor). His robes were impeccably tailored, and moved with him in a way that was incredibly eye catching and, probably, aided by magic. His hair was blond and shiny, his face curled into a sneer, and his gray eyes held no warmth for Harry Potter. In short, he looked every inch the intimidating, pureblood wizard Harry had always thought him to be, and the effect might have been quite successful in intimidating Harry now, were it not for one key detail.
“Look, ok, I still don’t really know anything about kneazles, but I know somewhere that does! Why don’t you go to Magical Menagerie and ask the man who works there? He must get his kneazles from somewhere, I’m sure he’d know at least who you can talk to. Also, kneazle breeding is a licensed profession, so you could probably look it up at the Ministry, which I know you know, because you were just complaining about writing a citation to an unregistered puffskein breeder last week, so you KNOW that magical creature breeders are registered! Anyway, I really must run, but again, I have complete confidence in you.”
“Forgive me, Potter. I understand it must be odd to see your face on a cat, but really, it’s not terribly personal. It mostly was an accident- as much as these things can be accidents. It was a few years ago, and I’d just turned 22, which meant my travel probation was over, and I was able to leave the country. I decided that I wanted to take a vacation, and so I went to the International Portkey Terminal and asked them for the first portkey out of Britain. That portkey just so happened to go to Minnesota, in the United States of America.
.” Malfoy pulled his hands down his face. He wasn’t wearing any makeup today, but that also looked good on him. “Is that what you really brought me here for? Your saviour complex?”
Malfoy took his hand away. Harry’s ankle felt bare. His expression didn’t change, but Harry still immediately regretted it.
“Why?” said Pansy, shooting him a look that bordered on incredulous. “Because it’s a fucking lame ass declaration.”
“Why.” A slender, platinum brow arched up. “You’re telling me the golden boy has never endeavoured into a harmless round of cock and ball torturing?”
Her hands curve around Harry’s waist, and she rolls them over so that she’s on top, and they’re facing. She leans in, and the whole world is just her scornful grin, and a silver bullet between teeth.
coward.” He definitely looked like the Draco Malfoy from Hogwarts. Harry felt the resentment build in him, poisonous and unkind, uncaring. The resentment wouldn’t care about Draco Malfoy’s flowery leggings, or the clearing they had found together, or how it felt to hear him laugh at Harry’s jokes, or the delicate, never-ending moment where Harry had reached out with his hand in the Fire Techno Dance club, and pressed his palm to Draco Malfoy’s back.
It rushed back in the form of the corridor of Grimmauld Place. Harry had dropped his hand; he was already sauntering down to the kitchen, shrugging off his robes. His shoulder blades were insistent against the thin cotton of his shirt. Draco had to blink his eyes closed for a moment.
He looked up, slowing his hand to get Draco to stop and look down at him. His mouth was open, gasping, beautiful.
Now Blaise sounded a bit embarrassed. “I’m not having a spiritual awakening,” he said. “I’m just exploring the spiritual niche. In a purely intellectual manner.”
Later, it turned out that Malfoy wanted to do yoga. They were on the plaza again, Harry watching as Malfoy pushed himself up into bridge posture, his back arching to form an effortless curve. He had attached a silver bracelet around his ankle, and the light danced off it, glinting this way and that.
To his surprise, Malfoy made no further comments. Instead, he just looked down at the lipstick, almost cogitative in his expression, before pulling it off. It was slow, deliberative. Harry thought there was something explicit about the bend of his fingers.
Ron was sitting on the opposite couch. Upon seeing Harry, he had simply just stared at him, as if he was seeing an apparition. Then he had slowly raised his hand, fist-bumped Harry, and then said, in a dazed sort of voice, “Come on in, mate.”
It’s funny, how it has never truly occurred to her before – I mean, to say she hasn’t liked girls before then is simply inconceivable – but there is a difference between liking girls and saying it like that.
Malfoy’s fingers hovered where they were about to close over the glass. “Shall we sit down?” he asked, glancing out towards the unlit living room.
Now Draco looked at him properly. It was a look that completely undid the way he had looked at Harry when he was angry at him.
He finished rolling the mat up. Harry still hadn’t said anything. He watched as Draco paused over the mat, looking down at where his fingers were splayed over the worn foam.
He softened after a moment. “You really didn’t know?” It was tender in a way a parent was to a child. Harry could barely stand it.
Malfoy looked at him. “Not to escape yourself,” he said after a moment, “To become bigger. To become more yourself.”
Harry choked on his beer, just a little bit. Hermione giggled, but it was mostly shocked. Although they had warmed up to her, there was a certain brand of Gay Dragon Village humour that took some desensitising to.
“Oh,” says Potter, holding up the bouquet and brandishing it through the air like a bloodied sword. “These are flowers! They match your house, don’t you think? And your shirt too.”
Harry’s body was reacting the way most bodies reacted in result to being in close proximity to other bodies. Which was to say, readily. It was not his fault. He could not control his body.
They kept kissing, one of Harry’s wonderful hands now cupping the back of Draco’s head, his fingers buried in white hair. Draco completely melted under his body. The other hand reached down and rubbed him through his trousers.
Malfoy went silent. He straightened up only to stir his straw through the coffee. The ice cubes clanked against the glass.
“Not much to say,” said Harry. “It’s been going on for a few years. Sometimes it’s manageable. Sometimes it’s not.”
“No.” He wanted to believe it. People made things difficult because they couldn’t be honest with themselves but being with someone was really just – an agreement. All someone had to do was ask, and all the other person had to do was say yes. Like – “I live close by,” and then – “Alright, Harry.”
Harry blinked at the abruptly empty room, trying to figure out how the mood had switched so quick. Had he gone too far?
Malfoy raised his head. His grumpy expression was upset upon witnessing Charlie’s inebriated state, at which he raised an amused brow.
Harry swallowed and leaned back a bit into his chair. “I just want to see them. I mean, like, train them. Properly.”
“That’s great,” Harry had said after he’d gotten a, if somewhat feeble, grip. “But I’m not going to do that. Thanks.”
Draco was running one finger up and down what looked to be a particularly well-loved novel. Harry had to go and sit down on the available area on the sofa. From this angle, he could see that Draco’s cheeks were bright red, even though Harry hadn’t said anything particularly risqué.
Draco smiled back, but it was tighter. Harry knew this one. A mixture of scepticism and amusement. Maybe fondness. Pleased with himself, Harry leaned back even more. The smile grew more pronounced.
Back in Scotland, it hadn’t been like that. In Scotland, Harry always knew what other people wanted.
– filling up the space around him, filling up his skin – a rose-bloom of sweetness too thick to think through.
“You can come back up now,” said Oceania, and Harry watched their collective bodies rise like a wave. “We’re going to do our lotus pose.”
He was definitely secreting them now. In fact, his smile could still be pretty much described as lascivious. Harry felt that he could use some air, or perhaps some really bright lighting.
With his eyes closed, it was like he was in the clearing again. He could smell the grass; could feel the cool air on his cheek. Everything became very, very clear. It was like these last few weeks had been a dream – everything else had been a bad memory. This was real. Harry felt real.
Harry didn’t think Hayden was cold either, now he thought about it. He remembered the pub with the Lotus, and the exchange with the man Harry had accidentally witnessed. No, Hayden wasn’t cold. They just weren’t fully here.
Draco leaned down. For a moment Harry thought he was going to put his mouth on it and made to stop him, but then Draco went higher and licked a stripe up Harry’s abdomen.
The books were not like the ones in Hayden’s house in any aspect other than their magnitude.  There were three entire bookshelves: but the shelves did not contain them. They were spilled across the entire room, on the floor and table and sofas, a cup overflowing.
Hayden shook their head. “That was Oceania,” they said, and for the first time since the evening had begun they began to smile. Hayden smiling was a different person. Harry stared.
It’s a horrible thing to say, and Malfoy must know it, so Harry leaves the conversation and rolls over, staring at that muted light, and the way it ripples across the folds of the bed sheets.
But Draco had done this before. He managed to get up with considerably more grace than Harry, which made Harry glad that he had had the foresight and melodrama in him to get up before Draco had actually arrived. Draco slid into place behind him, and suddenly his pointy knees were slotting in place behind Harry’s, his floral thighs opening against Harry’s lower back. Harry looked down and swallowed. He rubbed a hand against Jane’s scales.
And Malfoy is too. The rest of it is a complete act – it’s like a set-up, like a porn movie, like a fantasy – all coy eyes and crude words and lingerie – Malfoy will bat her eyes as she asks whether Harry would rather be swallowing a dick right now instead of sticking her tongue inside her. But when Malfoy is on the floor, moaning, gasping, eyes scrunched up and nose all wrinkly as she tells Harry how much she needs it, how much she wants it, how she needs it harder – Harry believes it then.
“Or about basic social etiquette, apparently. Why?” Malfoy leans back against the counter, recovering fast, and quirks a brow. “Do you have a domestic kink?”
“I got us a lead on the potion,” Draco said abruptly. He strolled over to his desk and started pulling out files from his bag. “It’s got ingredients traced from the Amazon. I didn’t realise before, because the strand of leaf skeletons used are similar to a more common sibling in Scotland, but I tracked it down, and it’s entirely possible that there could be a bigger dealer located there. It’s likely they’d have some sort of set up near a rainforest. It would provide good coverage, and rare ingredients are generally prioritised. I think we should set up some tracking charms and take a good look at –”
He went for a walk. Not a run. Around him, everything was fervent and green and in motion, but to him it all seemed very still somehow. He envied the way that the forest kept growing.
Pansy waved a dismissive hand. She was digging into her octopus rolls. How her lipstick wasn’t smearing everything Harry would never know.
He hadn’t told them. Today, he ran until stars sparked at his vision and he had to put his head between his knees to stop throwing up.
“Draco?” he called out, just before Malfoy got to the door. Malfoy paused, then looked over his shoulder.
Oceania pointed at him. They were all also a few beers in. “I’m not,” she asserted. “I just think…there’s possibility.”
“Ah, there he is,” Malfoy smiled ruefully as Harry joined him in stacking the mats. “My faithful house elf.”
Draco laughed again, but this time it was quick, short burst of surprise. “Harry –” he said, and then stopped. “I can’t go on your first flight with you.”
Harry ran his gaze briefly over the bedframe. He was casually climbing over Draco, filling his vision with brown skin and stars, as if this was something they did all the time.
“Well,” said Charlie. “It means your dragon is depressed. It happens sometimes. I’ve seen it before, occasionally.”
“Is Oceania well?” said Hermione, after a few tense minutes, even though Harry knew she’d met her for lunch just two days ago.
Malfoy blinked, and then pressed his lips together. His hand was very still under Harry’s. “I’m trying,” he whispered.
Inside, Malfoy was rummaging around a small kitchen, heating water with his wand, grinding coffee beans, waving two cups over. Harry came in and stood awkwardly by the table as a large glass bottle flew by his head.
Blue. That was a good word to describe it. It was as if his eyes had stopped working right, and the part that was supposed to show him other colours stopped showing him it. In fact, everything in him had stopped working right.
Harry leaned down, his face pressed against the mat. The foam was cool against his face, and he could feel the sun on his back.
“That’s the spirit,” she said, bumping him with her hip before bounding off towards the bedroom. He sighed and dropped onto one of the sofas that wasn’t made up.
Harry rolled his eyes again, harder, though it probably wasn’t so effective when his face was still red. But god, it wasn’t like it was his fault. Malfoy
“Come on,” she said when she reached them, grabbing their wrists. “Let’s go put up the paperchains.”
Draco made the tea. Harry ran his fingers along the edge of the island, trying to catch himself. He was on the edge of something, too.
“We’ll take these too,” said Malfoy, before Harry could swipe his card. He was pushing a least twenty bottles of lube across the counter.
Once, afterwards, Harry even asks: “When did you know you liked girls?” They’re on the bed breathing heavily, Malfoy on her back, Harry on her side, glancing down at her. She’s acutely aware of the curves of her own body – acutely aware of being a woman, of being desired by another woman – she can’t stop tracing that curve, that dip between her hips and ribs.
Luna grinned. “I like the way you speak,” she allowed. “But it’s mostly because you’re very attractive.”
“I thought you weren’t having one,” replied Luna, and she sounded amused, and then the conversation evolved naturally, expanding to include Pansy, and although it was interesting and although it was strange and although it could have easily included him as well, Harry was simply outside of it. He wasn’t here anymore, in Scotland, in this bar, in this chair, but in the Himalayas, and he was leaving Gay Dragon Village, and Draco Malfoy was stepping out of the woods:
Harry grinned. Draco grinned back. They were both covered in dust and sweat and destroyed paperchains.
He packed up his equipment and went into the kitchen to wait. There was a growing sense of guilt in his gut that was getting difficult to ignore, so he put on the kettle. He could vaguely hear Malfoy moving about upstairs.
“The hell you haven’t.” Charlie slapped his back mannishly, in a way that reminded Harry so abruptly and acutely of Ron that it almost hurt. “You came here, didn’t you, on your own? Ready to learn? And you’ve done so much. Just look at you.”
The air between them grew very thick. Harry was remembering it, and he knew Malfoy was too – knew he had made Malfoy think of it, that he had put it in his mind. He could count the spaces between them, the steps it would take to – one, cross into Malfoy’s space – two, take a hold of his hip through his coat – three, roll him over onto his belly – four, bend him at the hips – five, wrap his other hand around the front of Malfoy’s throat – six, move his first to pin Malfoy’s wrists onto the table-top.
Luna looked at him looking at the seeds. She said, “I’ll get a shovel,” and disappeared back into the house. Once she came back out with several gardening tools of varying sizes, they got to work.
all started when Draco got partnered with Harry fucking Potter half a year after passing his final Auror examinations.
“Come on.” He dropped down, gently taking Malfoy’s feet and getting them into the shoes. There was a sharp inhale, and a hand grabbed automatically onto Harry’s shoulder for balance. When he came back up, Malfoy seemed to be unable to look at him.
“Before you loved me,” said Harry, and then he really was crying again, for fuck’s sakes. And Oceania had crossed the space to sit beside him, one arm wrapped around his back and the other soothingly rubbing his hands, and he thought to himself, god, was this what it was like to have a mother? And then he was just crying harder, goddammit, and he was so fucking ridiculous.
“Hello,” she said to him, and the way she said it somehow managed to make it sound both lascivious and chastising.
Harry looks up at Draco, emerald eyes scorching into her own, her mouth a swollen rubicund and her skin damp and warm and black where the strands of her hair cling desperately in wild little whorls to her pores, and she tips forward and presses her mouth against the white curls beneath Draco’s stomach. Draco inhales harshly, and runs her fingers over Harry’s forehead, wiping back the strands. And then Harry nudges Draco’s thigh to the side, and opens her mouth against Draco’s crotch.
They went and found Osh and Hayden after. Then Tom. Charlie was busy with dragons and in the words of Hayden: “important grown-up management stuff” so they left him to it. And then got pished in the undergrowth.
“I just wanted to say,” he began, and then closed his eyes briefly as if wrestling with himself. Then, eyes still closed, he turned around and stood up on the chair.
It was Malfoy’s turn to shoot Tom a dirty look, whilst Harry shot Malfoy an amused one. He decided he quite liked Tom.
Then he took a shower. By the time he was done, his tea was the perfect temperature. Maybe a bit cold. Nothing was perfect. He liked to read now.
“Alright, you fucking beast, no need to throw a hissy fit. I’m only checking your goddam wing, I swear, you’d be entirely useless without me –”
“Hi,” he said to Draco, strangely, nonsensically. He realised he was smiling, almost painfully. Dear god, every muscle in his body ached.
Draco tucked his chin into Harry’s shoulder again. For some reason, Harry hadn’t quite recognised how intimate the action was the first time. “Yes,” he said. “I just wanted to hear you say it.”
, during broad daylight – it’s only when she’s with Malfoy that all that fight comes out, that all that want suffocates her most deliciously. There is nothing else like it. Sometime, she’ll still think about men, about broad shoulders and that V above the waistband, about Adam’s apples and stubble – and it’s all nice, it’s all very nice, but it doesn’t get her crazy with it. It’s not the same as it is with women. It’s like the breadsticks before the meal. Like the appetiser instead of desert.
too much, and he could hardly take what he had already. And then Draco Malfoy was leaving, and the length of his back was so pale, and
And then, there was Tom. Tom with his kind eyes and steady gaze, Tom with his temple and soft hands and strong thighs. Fuck, Draco had loved those thighs. The past was in the past, and he didn’t love Tom anymore (or ever?), but he had loved being sat up on those thighs, his back arched, neck tilted to the sky – for the first time in his life, getting something
Pansy levelled him a very knowing and borderline chiding look. Well – it would have been chiding if it wasn’t from Pansy. Her eyes were glittering.
Harry looks away, rolling his eyes and smiling all at the same time, and then puts his hand on Draco’s knee. “It’s too hot for crepes.”
“Harry!” Someone called out, and when he looked over he saw Seamus and Neville, waving him over. He glanced back at Malfoy, but he had already slid away into the crowd. Harry went.
Oceania winked at Harry before going back to her persimmon. “I can see you, you know,” said Malfoy, without looking up.
The finger on the book stilled. Draco’s lips moved as if to press together, and then he inclined his head towards Harry. His eyes stayed at some point on the bookshelf.
“Were truer words ever spoken?” agreed Oceania, and, satisfied with this, reached for the pink wool.
“Mm,” says Malfoy, from behind her ear. “Well, people change. What happened to perfect Princess Potter? Aren’t you supposed to be riding Prince Weasley’s soft dick into the sunset instead of me?” Her pale hand has found its way back into Harry’s jeans, and all Harry can smell is her expensive perfume, and her soft skin, and the heat emanating off her pulse point.
“Hey.” Draco gaze was back to its usual sharpness today. “I see you’re participating in the preparation of the mandala.”
Harry’s gaze snapped back to his face. “What? I wasn’t stalking you. I was getting coffee with my friend. I just saw you and thought I would say hello.”
Then Harry told him to close his eyes, and he did that too. It was different, when you weren’t alone. Instead of disappearing into the room, it was like he became more aware of his body, of the jagged shape of it. Harry told him to breathe in. Draco felt it in his throat, lungs, ribs.
“Ah. That one.” Malfoy took a pause to sip his “coffee”. “I’d love to. Let’s see. Every morning I wake with the birds. I make myself coffee and stretch.” He looked over at Harry. “You might want to write this down.”
“Let me,” he whispers, dragging his mouth gently across the skin. “Let me take you home. I can light you up, as well.”
No wonder the poor boy operated on such extremes. Draco forced himself to take a breath, to relax his hands.
“The second rule is that you don’t tell anyone about queer club,” said Oceania, in the same low voice.
Then he smirked, that playful arrogance completely refreshing his features. Draco dropped his eyes to the hem of his t-shirt, just visible above the clasp of work robes. His pulse pushed forward in his throat. He was truly so done for.
She starts to unbutton Malfoy’s shirt, pressing kisses after each button until Malfoy squirms, and Potter grins breathily up at Malfoy and kisses her again, her tongue stroking the roof of Malfoy’s mouth, rubbing clumsily against her lips, cupping Malfoy’s breast with one hand. Malfoy arches her back, gasping, but Potter just keeps on kissing her open mouth, and kneads her through the cotton material with her hand, the other reaching underneath Malfoy and pressing into the curve of her back, lifting her up. She can feel Potter grinding against her thigh through her jeans, and for a brief moment considers that she’s about to go insane from sensory overload. And then she isn’t considering anything at all, except for the movement of Harry’s body, and her hands, and the glowing sitting in the absence of her mind.
Malfoy dragged the pencil across the fold of his eye and pulled back, before touching up in precise feathery strokes. He was good. Even Harry could see that he was good. It made his eyes look dramatic, mysterious. Like walking into a modern art museum and seeing something that stunned you in its audacity, even if you couldn’t understand it at all.
“Literally, what the fuck is jambon?” says Harry, flipping a plastic packet in one hand and frowning. “I just want some ham.”
Draco blinks and sucks some more ice cream into his mouth. “Their dicks are also small.” He says after a moment, his voice mournful. Harry snorts beside him, and is then leaning in, capturing Draco’s vanilla-raspberry mouth his chocolate one.
Harry stared right back. Then gave her one last smile before he left, turning down the path from the training pens and disappearing into the forest.
If you couldn’t escape, what was the point of running? He dropped his hands to the soil, pushing himself back into a pile of limbs, instead of a set of walls. He gritted his teeth.
“Peppermint,” says Harry, in a tone akin to wonder. “I’ve never tried that before.” She swings her legs, back and forth.
He pushed back from his desk and carefully stood up, packing away his papers. He pulled on his robes carefully, folding down the hems.
“Jesus fuck,” muttered Harry. He felt Draco sway again, still laughing, and swore again. He shifted to try and catch him as he toppled down.
Life was such a deeply complex thing. And it was so intimately tied up with the Self – and what was that, really? No one ever really told you about that. How many people, Harry wondered, must be walking around as strangers to themselves?
“Damn you! Swim, for fucks sakes.” Harry was panting and spitting. His body felt like it was caving. It was like when he was running, when he’d been running for too long, only worse. A frustrated groan tore through his chest.
It stops raining. It doesn’t rain for the rest of the week, and Draco spends half of Thursday sitting under the shower, cold beads pelting into her hair, sluicing down her back, waiting under the water that isn’t green, or blue.
Harry felt himself stop moving. None of them were particularly looking at him, but he felt exposed regardless. Like he’d been turned inside out. He stared at down at the glass in his hands. He didn’t have to say anything. He could not say anything, and he would get away with it; it would be fine.
Harry looked at him. Draco must have felt it, but he kept looking out the window, watching the water churn through the pavement. It made the cement look like it was still setting.
She does see Malfoy around. In fact, the next time she sees her is at another pub – a gay pub. Well. A lesbian pub.
He hummed. “No Goblin stuff, but will Elf do? I could have a look in the pantry. God knows what’s down there.”
He turned to Draco. Draco was staring at the broken chain, the empty space where Jane had just spontaneously disappeared. As Harry watched, he took a long, slow blink, and then turned to meet Harry’s gaze.
Once they’d collected themselves, Harry brushed his teeth as Draco went to the bedroom to change. Harry took a moment to imagine what Draco’s bedroom must look like. Before Gay Dragon Village, he would have easily imagined an extravagant four-poster bed, and maybe the heads of various house elves propped up on the walls, all complete with a stuffed toy snake to cuddle up to. Now, after coming here, he found that he was picturing things a lot more along the lines of a waterbed, and maybe a trampoline.
Here he was, twenty-one years old. He had never thought he would even make it to twenty-one. In his head, it still sounded so old. But here he was, and even after all this time, he was still so naïve. And it was deep, furtive, and somehow
Draco leaned back against the rock behind him and stretched out his legs. Pink magnolias today. He liked these ones. He liked how one of flowers stretched right across his butt.
“Oh.” Oceania flapped a hand at him, as if to brush away the thought. “You weren’t rude. Just overwhelmed.”
Malfoy straightened. “I tried to, but I couldn’t.” He looked at Harry, and if Harry hadn’t just meditated, he might’ve had to look away. Again, he felt he was teetering on the edge of that loch, the loch of Draco Malfoy, unknown and inky.
Draco blinked the sunlight out of his eyes. Then he looked around at the green, at the vastness of it, like it would never end here, even though he knew it must.
It always took a few minutes for the shower water to heat up, but by now Harry was used to it. He stood under the onslaught of the cold sleeting down his back and stared out at the very small window in the corner of the bathroom. The glass had fogged up in front of it, unfocusing the lines and shapes around him. When he stepped back under the water and let it submerge his face, it got even simpler, everything melting except the small patch of light directly ahead.
“I don’t think surface differences matter,” Oceania was saying. “But I think, when it comes to core values, most couples have the same beliefs. The soul has to recognise itself. Maybe.”
Draco unbuttoned his collar button. Harry looked around the table in alarm, and was glad to see that Hermione and Ron (faithful,
As he was washing his hands, he caught his reflection’s eye in the mirror. The man there was bloodshot, his brown skin tinged grey with the lighting and restlessness. His lips were visibly dry. His facial hair was growing out, giving him a bit of a stubbly beard. Harry had never really grown it out before. He rubbed his fingers over his jaw and decided not to shave.
Harry laughed again. “Draco,” he said, and it came out more fondly perhaps it should’ve, but he was too exhilarated to care. “Get up here.”
“But you should definitely talk about it,” Charlie assured him, “If you’re seeing things. Sometimes, when things get difficult, I go and talk to the dragons.”
Was this what Harry looked like when he was meditating? Malfoy’s eyes were still flickering, and his cheeks were red, but the stretch of his shoulders had loosened, his mouth opening wider, like a flower. He reminded Harry of a flower. When had Draco Malfoy become this thing, this strange, brazen, quirky creature? Harry didn’t like to remember, but he did remember what the other man had been like at school. Of course he did. Stupid little mouth, slicked back hair, a smirk so arrogant everyone had wanted to punch it right off him. When had he changed? Had this other person being buried inside all this time, existing quietly, waiting for a chance to breathe? Had the war stripped him of something, some first layer that had gone rotten and stale, like scabbed skin? Was it his father? His money? His upbringing?
Harry picked up the copy of “The Hungry Caterpillar,” while he was waiting. He did actually enjoy picture books, but, somehow, had the feeling that that would not go over well.
These were all things that Harry thought as they walked to the Green Hotel, and as they walked, he remembered why he didn’t often let himself think.
Tonight, the trees were claustrophobic, the air sweaty. There was something swollen in his chest, clawing up at his skin. It felt like the sky was mocking him ahead, all that endless freedom.
Malfoy’s eyes were very wide. His pulse was playing a little staccato in the thin soft skin just beneath his chin, and his cheeks looked like someone had crushed raspberries on them.
Malfoy smirked, but the way he directed it was not cruel. There was something almost attentive about his gaze. Then he turned it away and rummaged through the bag.
“Draco’s mad at me,” he murmured after a long moment. He had dripped tears into the side of her hair, and discreetly tried to wipe away the moisture with his sleeve. Oceania chuckled into his ear.
“It’s what Oceania calls it, and it’s kind of stuck, honestly,” said the person, shuffling three round bread-like balls into Harry’s bowl. “You’re new, aren’t you?”
At some mid-point in the catch ups, Harry found himself looking over their heads, scanning the room. His eyes met the long white cliff of Malfoy’s side-profile as he gazed towards a series of hanging samplers.
But he had been trying to make himself better. That’s what the yoga had been about so far. And if it wasn’t for the blue, he would’ve desperately liked being allowed to room with any one of the wonderful and strange people here.
Harry glanced down at his suitcase. “Think so. I’ve probably forgotten something though. You know me.”
Malfoy suddenly stood to attention and strode back into his house. Harry double-checked the number on the door before resigning himself to following, since the door had been left wide open.
Harry went and sat down on the sofa that Draco had been sitting on before they’d got up. Draco took a great deal of time putting his tumbler down. Then he walked over, stopping before Harry.
But he still hated them. Harry Potter was rolling over in front of him and muttering things, his dazed eyes fixing on him. Draco didn’t think he should be here for this. He shouldn’t have come. Why had he come?
Draco smiled a little, in the corner of his mouth. Harry watched as the shadow of the overhead caressed the slant of his cheekbone, combed through his hair.
been kind – he had always been, much more than Draco, much more than anyone else in Draco’s life. He was kind to the core of him, he was kind to the heart. And it was too much and it was not enough, and it was
Harry looked at Draco. He looked at him for a long moment. He looked at his long neck and high cheekbones, at his acute jawline and long nose. At the fan of white lashes framing the glossy curve of his eyes, the flat grey of his irises sinking into the endless black of his pupils. The room was small. Harry was close enough to see all of this.
“Harry.” Malfoy’s sounded more serious now. When he looked over, he saw that he was also looking up. “You know none of that stuff actually matters.”
“Now,” said Tom. “You want to bring your hands to your knees. Yes – like that. You can keep your palms open, or touch your middle finger to your thumb. Whatever works for you.”
Later, they did take a break. Luna brought out scones and jam and they ate it on the grass as the day began to brown with age, even though it was getting cold out. As they did Harry looked around at the garden, and the jam stuck to his fingers and thumb, and some of it got in his hair as he sucked it off. Luna finished her second and said, contemplatively: “I love it here.”
Draco writing down the word “fucking” in his long, elegant handwriting delighted Harry to no end. As was usual for him, he was sitting down in the corner of his lounge in the comfiest crook of the sofa, next to the window. There was good lighting here – it was where he read all of Draco’s letters.
“The lovely Oshanoter needs a milkshake!” Malfoy announced to the mostly empty room, and allowed him and Harry to be herded back to the counter. Both he and Oceania ordered milkshakes.  Once they were all seated around a bigger table, Malfoy pushed his milkshake towards Harry.
“No.” Malfoy turned to face a wall of body-stockings so Harry couldn’t see his pout. Which was still visible if Harry leaned slightly to the right. His overdrawn lips jut out over the knife’s point of his chin, a tiny red blossom. Malfoy liked to paint on his lipstick in the shape of heart, just like the evil queen from Alice in Wonderland.
And then he was unravelling. His mind was floating, somewhere above him, maybe. He was understanding now, that there were layers to himself. If he turned the loud part off, he found something tender and honest and deeply profound. It was intimate. He felt so close to himself.
Harry thought of Malfoy’s eyes, of the afternoon sunlight flooding his fine, artisan features. They were inbred; too long, too narrow in places, the proportions just odd enough to push themselves outside the stark lines of conventional beauty. His lipstick made him even less conventional, the tiny heart of his red mouth making his eyes appear too big, like he was always surprised. He had looked surprised outside the shop, but it had been a surprise that had been carefully reigned in, held close until it stilled, staring and not moving.
“Research?” Harry asked. Draco was already getting up and had his back turned to him, rummaging through the to-read stack. When he returned, it was with three large, purple leather books that looked more like diaries. “Charlie lent them to me,” he explained, flipping open the first one. “I wanted to read up more on the details of the connection involved in dragon-taming.” He held one up to Harry, and looked up with corner of his mouth tugged up in a dry smile. “If you can bear it.”
Stepping closer, he decided to make it even easier. “I want to put my hand on your cheek. Do you want that too?”
The eyebrow came back down and indented itself unnervingly above Malfoy’s long nose. There was a pause where Malfoy was clearly unsure of what to say.
Harry looked out the window. The view was mostly obscured by the surrounding forest, but in the distance one could see the faint tracings of the mountain line. A few birds fluttered by, calling out to one another.
Harry had been back to see Tom a few times since he’d first been with Malfoy. Tom was quiet, but like Hayden, it was not that he was shy, but rather that he was reserved. Unlike Hayden, it wasn’t cold.
“How do you feel?” asked Tom. Harry blinked at him, and then at Malfoy, who was watching him with an odd intensity. He felt the top layer of himself begin to come alive again, slowly filling his mind with chatter and programming and busyness. He didn’t mind. He understood that his soul couldn’t survive undressed in this huge world.
They went into plank and chaturanged down. Up into upward dog – his shoulders back, opening his heart to the sun – and then back, downward dog and then one leg up, high, high as it would reach, before bending it and bringing it forward between his hands. They pushed back and forth and
“You must know,” he said, voice hoarse. “You must know sometimes.” Then, when Harry didn’t say anything, “How do you live –?”
Osh just smiled. Harry loved that smile, and how wise she always seemed to him. “No,” she said simply.
Harry swayed forward a little. He was thinking, his tongue curled forward in his mouth. Draco could see the shape of it in his cheek, and felt that familiar lower-gut liquefying.
“Draco said it was like a path,” Harry said, and then realised he wasn’t angry anymore and looked up to where Malfoy himself was still standing by the trees, watching them. He swallowed, this time less hard.
“I don’t think the way Draco does,” Oceania replied. “And I don’t often resent the way he does. We’re very different people. I’m just explaining. You asked why he was angry. It’s a theory.”
The girl shrugged. She was pretty, he thought absently, in a normal kind of way. Her eyebrows were nicely-shaped, and her light brown hair was swept back into a short ponytail.
“Behind you, actually,” Neville said mildly, and then Harry was turning around and there she was, hair spitting flames, freckles sprayed across her nose.
As Malfoy passed over to the lane next to Oceania he winked at Harry. Harry rolled his eyes again, fruitlessly, and then said to no one in particular: “I’m going to get a coke.”
“You know what?” he said, and hated the way his voice came out. Making it obvious as fucking daylight how hard he had to try. How hard he always tried. “You could just have some sensitivity. If you really didn’t want to fight.”
“Well,” said Malfoy after a moment. “I’m going to go and burn Hayden’s stash of blue cheese. So thanks for your time.”
I really hope you enjoyed, and if you did, please drop a comment!! They encourage me to update faster and feel really good, so. I love them! I love you!
“You can borrow my owl,” said Charlie, and walked away to feed the rest of the dragons, humming lightly.
you do?” Harry was smiling. Malfoy look over at him and laughed again. “Urm,” he said. “You know what I do. Just…like, practise yoga. And read. And go on runs with interrogating fashion disasters, I suppose.”
Hermione raised a brow at where Draco was still in the chair. “Okay,” she said simply. “I believe you.”
“I live close by,” said Harry, knowing now that he had been trying to say it all evening. “No wine, but there’s firewhiskey.”
“I did,” Charlie said sheepishly, answering Hayden’s earlier question. “But it’s not how you think it is.”
Malfoy had moved past the doorframe and his face was hovering over Harry, eyebrows raised and half his mouth tipped up, but Harry couldn’t remember what expression that was. Malfoy and his bloody expressions. Harry wanted to sink past the surface of him too, and wander around his machinery.
Harry went back to his coke. Swirled the straw though the ice cubes. Once Charlie seemed satisfied with his assessment of the juice carton’s musical ability, he leaned forward onto the counter, resting his chin on his palm.
Malfoy had said Harry was brave, but Harry was always running away from things. Malfoy had said Harry was brave, but Harry was afraid of a letter, and where did that leave him?
“Is this okay for you?” he asked, once Malfoy was sitting. Malfoy looked a little startled by the question.
A bit later, when they’d had a few more drinks and a lot more olives, Zambini asked Harry how he’d been settling back into Scotland.
It wasn’t that Harry had never done the mechanics of this before. But he had never felt it like this.
A hand clasped his shoulder and he jumped, standing and swivelling around. Hayden was there, frowning at him.
“Then why are you mad?” Harry asked and Draco had been wrong, he had been wrong, Harry wasn’t trying to provoke him, of course he hadn’t, it was just the way he spoke, it was just the way his mind worked –
Oceania frowned and looked about with more vigour. After a few long moments, her face cleared. “Oh,” she said, sounding quite surprised. “I suppose you’re right. You don’t really notice them if you aren’t looking for them, do you?”
“They’re not for you,” Draco said. He had a knowing gleam in his eyes, as if he’d deliberately presented them the way he had in order to get a reaction from Harry.
“Did you like exercising back in Scotland?” asked Oceania as they walked. Harry blinked, the sun catching in his eye.
“Tell me about this love confession business,” Draco announced once they’d found their favourite set of logs and were all nice and comfortable. He tried to pop off the top of the cider like they did in movies, and then winced, lowering the bottle and pouting at it. Harry wasn’t quite comfortable about the feelings he was having about the pout.
“And I mean.” Harry pulled at the loose threat until it tore. “Obviously it’s fine if you don’t still lo – want me.”
Now Draco really looked pained. He was looking away again, the tendons in his neck sharply strained.
In Jane’s eyes, flying was a game. She loved the landscape, the colours and smells, the shapes it made for her to follow through. Given permission, she wanted to explore all of it, as quickly as possible.
Well. He had stopped before he could finish his eighth. He felt a little like puking into the bushes, but it was chill.
“Well,” he said after a moment. There was something slightly more strapped down about his composure now, but it was the kind of strapped down that reminded Harry of those crazy lorry drives on the motorway that seemed to think it was acceptable to duck-tape their over spilling goods down. “Shall we go and hope that Jane is in a better mood than Gorrick? She’ll be awake by now.”
“You’re just a pure-blood bitch,” She says, and tears Malfoy’s silk shirt at the back. Malfoy leans back, an eyebrow raised.
He woke up slowly. Became aware of the creases in his clothes from last night, of the soft crush of the duvet. Of the heavy press of his awkwardly organised limbs, the acerbic taste of his mouth. The familiar smells of home. The sunlight. The stillness.
Draco leaned closer. His forehead was against Harry’s neck, close enough to kiss. “You want to know how long?”
And maybe sometimes sex is all take and give, and maybe sometimes sex is a gambling game, a game with each other, a game with yourself – maybe sometimes sex is a power flow, and maybe it’s best that way – but maybe sometimes it is also just a way of digging deeper into someone, shovelling all that extra earth, all that extra person out of the way, so that you can take a look at their core, so that you can feel it warm you, watch all that burning that goes on beneath them shine brighter on your face than it has before.
“Osh,” he heard himself mumble. His voice was disconnected from himself, a message flung into the world of dreams, slippery and impossible. The space between thought and spoken word melted away. He was glad for it. Everything was easier this way.
“That's good,” says Harry, still smiling. “It's the chemical in male sweat that releases the gay into your brain.”
“I love yours too,” she said smiling, and curled into him. Grateful, his body met hers, entangling itself. It had been starving for human closeness. It knew how to love better than his mind.
“Take off your shirt,” says Malfoy, and Potter sits up, straddling Malfoy, and pulls her vest up over her head. Potter doesn’t shave her armpits. Her bra is purple.
“No.” Malfoy looked at Harry curiously. “I mean, I don’t know. I’m content just to look.” He shrugged, glancing down at the grass beside his hand. “Why do you ask?”
He was with a dragon. Not Harry’s dragon. Faintly, Harry recognised it as the dragon he’d been with when Harry had first came here, and nearly had an aneurysm upon encountering Malfoy in his leathery
, I –” There it was, that wounded sound again. It bled between them, unfinished. Harry held his breath even so. He knew, because it was wounded, that it would stay unfinished. The blue wanted to crest within him again, and he wanted to swallow it down.
Everywhere. Working men, washing down the dragon pens. Neat-looking men, tidying the Green Hotel. Almost-certainly-not-straight men, wearing very tight trousers. Even the
The little smile on Malfoy’s face dropped, not quite unpleasantly. He was looking at Harry’s beard again.
“Hello,” said Harry, leaning slightly against the doorframe. He felt himself begin to smile. “Imagine seeing you here.”
How dare I criticise anyone else, when I am already the lowest of the low? What do I know of bravery? What do I know of suffering? Anyone who takes the dark mark is barely human, isn’t that right, Harry Potter? How dare I talk to the great War Hero like I could be his equal –”
“Well,” he said, “This has been a great evening everyone. I’m going to apparate now, preferably into the middle of the ocean.”
Zambini didn’t look perturbed. “Ah, well,” he said, smoothing down the lapels of his lovely suit. “It was worth a try. Do send Granger my good wishes if you’re still in contact with her; I always did secretly admire her. And I’ll let Draco know that you’re looking well.”
“I suppose,” he said, “That it was less of a logical decision than one might expect. In my experience, sometimes you have to do away with logic. When something is right for you, you will feel it.” He looked at Harry, smiling. “Does it seem strange to you?”
“Great,” said Harry. He thought about getting up and opening the door for Malfoy. He stayed on the bed.
His expression didn’t change save for his lashes dropping back down. “Touché. Oh, but I was. You should’ve seen what was under my robes.”
“Anyway, point is, the first rule of queer club is that you have to befriend any other queers you encounter,” said Hayden.
“No, no.” says Potter, shaking her head, black hair getting everywhere. “I mean, we did, for a while – because during the war, it was hard to find places to stay, as you know – but then they got married-“
He sat down in front of her. His heart was beating furiously in his chest, the way it always did when he was this close up to her, but that was alright. That was alright.
He still thought about Jane sometimes. He thought about her being free, and didn’t regret it. He wondered if Draco ever saw her, and that was why he’d written it. He wondered if Draco ever saw her, and thought about him.
There was another drawn out silence. Draco exhaled. Harry watched as he rolled his shoulders back. It was so pale.
Draco frowned thoughtfully as he took a sip of the tea, looking at all the books like he’d just noticed they were there. “I think so.”
“You have feelings?” said Malfoy, sitting down. His tray had a multitude of fruits on it, each in its own section, as well as a single scone and pile of cream. “Dammit, I’ve forgotten a fork.”
“I think it’ll be cool,” said Ron, “I can get you in touch with Charlie, if you want. There are camps up in the Highlands.”
Harry laughed, a little awkwardly, and ate some more of his own meal. The waitress came over to check on them.
Draco was indeed pushing some of the books over to the other end of a sofa, making room to sit. It was almost funny, how neat everything else was – all the furniture and the decorations – in direct contrast to the books. It served nicely as a metaphor for the duplicity of its owner, Harry thought.
“Shall we begin with a flow?” Oceania got to her feet and rolled her shoulders back. “I think that would be good.”
Malfoy scoffed, then relaxed. “I don’t care about the photos,” he said, sounding a bit more like himself. He crossed over to the table and curled a finger around the handle of the cup but didn’t pick it up.
Harry bit his lip and inhaled deeply. “Damn,” he said, once he’d gotten a tenuous grip. “Dammit. Am I really?”
Malfoy was definitely giggling in the background now. It was easier to distract himself from the sheer horror of the situation if he focused on the centring, soothing image of kicking Malfoy in the throat.
Draco just smiled wider. “Maybe he’ll have to wear leather jeans now too.  Perhaps with those lovely knee pads you discovered a while ago.”
“Really, Osh?” One of his knees hit Harry in the face as he tried to look up at her. “You’re really going to come for me when I’m the only thing between you and your next life as a single blade of grass?”
There wasn’t much to do once he was done. He was grateful it was evening. He cleaned his teeth, and fell asleep almost immediately anyway.
“Then,” said Luna. “I suppose the only thing is to decide whether you’d like to live with him or without him. People are like everything else. You have to choose them.”
“Oh.” Harry pushed a little at Mayo’s nose, trying to get some room. Malfoy took one glance at him, and tossed a chunk of bloodied meat to the side. Mayo unenthusiastically slunk off of him.
Malfoy walked past their table. Harry jumped up and followed him, reaching for his sleeve. As his fingers brushed up against the inside of Malfoy’s wrist, he spun around, and then swallowed at the sight of Harry. He didn’t drop his gaze.
“Where’s your cleavage?” Malfoy bent backwards over the stool and rubbed his palms on Benjamin’s chest, which was now adorned in a pink gown. “I miss it.”
Someone had been shouting nearby for a while. As Harry began to listen in, he realised it sounded quite familiar.
What was it he had said to Draco? Meditation was the space for yourself. It was your time to be with yourself.
Harry leaned back into his chair, staring at where the purple edges of the sun were just starting to bleed into the clouds. Charlie’s words rushed over him like a tender lullaby.
They took their seats and Harry stood next to the pole and closed his eyes, as some godawful funky sex song began to play. He focused on his breath, counting backwards from ten.
“Do a handstand holding a bowling ball between your legs,” said Malfoy, having apparently recovered from the Tom ordeal. “No. Wait. Go and hit on the lady behind the counter.”
“I just wanted to say,” he began again, and now Harry was pretty sure the whole pub was looking at him, “that I’m sorry for the way I behaved during my adolescence and although I understand my behaviour is not excusable, I hope you except this as the sincere apology it is.”
