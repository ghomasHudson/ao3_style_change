The entrance of The Angels Christmas Market, in Hyde Park. As always full of Christmas lights and people.
D: Bye.
After a while, Harry smirked, “Oh, what a brilliant idea! Why didn’t I think of that?” Harry dramatically said, waving the stamp he was already holding around.
Pansy stayed silent, speaking volumes.
“Draco, enough of this we will start watching that muggle show tomorrow. I’m doing this for your own good Draco, just you wait and see.”
“I’d rather it on you with nothing else.”

“So how do we know what they do?” Draco asked, stepping closer to Harry again with a smirk on his lips.
“I want to make Rose & Teddy a card!” James declared grabbing the purple paper and some glue.
“I dunno Potter, do you deserve it?” Draco eyed him up and down, aware of the way it made Harry shiver.
Exiting the room, he walked straight into a barrier, stumbling backwards and crashing into Draco. Who didn’t so much catch him, but rather back into another barrier which kept the pair on their feet. Everything looked that same, but Harry stepped forward and confirmed the invisible barrier was still there. Trapping them in the doorway.
A huge thank you, to both
“The Eiffel tower’s not that big,” Malfoy re-bottled.
'. Draco’s thoughts were paused as he felt his bed dip from an added weight. He barely stopped a chuckle; clearly, the Saviour wasn’t as warm as he declared. Draco waited, expecting Harry to make some kind of comment, however, it never came. Instead, he just kept wiggling about, moving the duvet.
“I'm not playing games!”
Draco smirked, “I think you’re supposed to say,” he stepped forwards till he was whispering in Harry’s ear, “It looks better on my bedroom floor.”
“Aside from them.”
Without thinking, he grabbed Malfoys wrist, staring at the forearm. Finding relief in the pale unmarked skin. Finally, taking a deep breath, he relaxed, loosening his grip.
“To get Draco and Harry together.” Granger- or Weasley as she was now known replied unphased.
Draco meanwhile stopped prodding the bannister decoration to throw a frown in his direction.
A Christmas tree covered in decorations and lights.
Pansy was scary. There was a reason that girl managed to make Rita Skeeter cry and promise not to report on any of the Hogwarts 8th year students again. Pansy would achieve great things one day, providing she didn’t get knocked out by a rogue snowball. Perhaps the one in Draco’s hands right now.
“Sure, you're not Potter.” Draco sniped. “Ahhhh stop that.”
“Draco, shut up and go to sleep,” Harry mumbled.
Draco took a deep breath, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder, “It’s not. I just. I forgot it was,” Failing to find any words.
Harry was unsure how to handle this almost playful Malfoy in front of him. So his brain settled on asking, “Why do you have paper?”
The pair shared a look before laughing.
“Seriously, it doesn't make sense.”
Harry bit back a laugh, unsure why he expected a different answer from Draco. “First - no Harry it’s fine, Remus and Sirius love you and the kids are happy for you to stay there. Second - Fuck you. Third - all the places near work are extortionate. Seriously £7500 per week. Draco if you rent one of those places, double fuck you.”
“Right, only ten more letters,” Harry glanced over the mostly crossed-out list, impressed with how much they had achieved.
“We are friendly.” Malfoy smiled as he turned back to the boys.
“That’s up to you, you can use the arts and crafts to decorate them however you want,” Draco pushed a bag towards James, and folding several pieces of cards in half, giving him a range of colours to pick from.
“Na, that would be stupid,” Albus said, as the pair raced out the room.
Malfoy paused mid rearranging to accept Harry’s phone, typing something out before throwing it back to Harry and continuing to search in several boxes.
Which made Draco jump out of his skin, making a noise even Harry couldn’t copy. “Have you been standing there waiting all day?” His eyes wandered down Harry’s body. As he stepped forwards taking his coat off and placed it on the sofa along with a bag, attempted to act casual.
“No. That. It’s good. But I just didn’t expect it.,” He tripped over his words. Deciding to change the topic instead of continuing, “Is that arts and crafts stuff?” He questioned having not expected to see them.
Draco & Harry hug while watching the lights turn on, then go to the pub where Ron & Draco have a drunken heart to heart confirming Harry is interested in guys. Later when travelling home drunk Harry kisses Draco.
Harry chose to not answer pulling a face which said; the words came out your mouth not mine.
Pansy lifted a single eyebrow as she smirked towards Draco, “Oh really now? on Christmas day?” She fluttered her eyelashes in the manipulative manner, Draco was glad to never fall for.
“I'm across the room in my bed. How could I be touching you?”
Hermione and Ron both looked at her with the same expression, then glanced at each other. “He won’t.” They said in unison, oddly confident.
“Invites? Aren’t we just sending them a text?” Harry wondered out loud, after all, that had been his plan so far.
“How do you know what my handwriting is like?” Harry asked, leaning forwards, a smirk on his face.
Unable to stand the awkward silence in the air any longer, Harry practically growled as he got up.
H: Draco?
Harry kept his eyes upwards and pointed. Above them in the middle of the doorway was a single piece of Mistletoe. The leaves were bright green and berries whiter than they should be. It was placed exactly between the two rooms, where the pair was currently stuck.
Yes, yes, he did deserve it, not that Draco would tell him that.
“That tends to happen when you have classes together,” Draco snarked, trying to keep the edges of his lips from rising.
“No. I’m fine. I mean, Where’s Draco?”
Harry noticed the way Draco hadn’t reacted to his slip up and use of the word ‘we’. It made him wonder if Draco would still be around next year. With the boys being close friends, he imagined they would be. However, Draco would probably be working on his next job.
“Hi.”
“How is she even alive? Hang on, are you telling me I've been sharing my room with a 10ft long deadly snake this entire year?!”
“Nuh,” Draco moaned making grabby hands towards Harry.
Harry took the drink off Draco, placing it on the desk next to him and grabbed Draco’s arms pulling him forwards, surprised when Draco stood up and rested his head on Harry’s shoulder without complaint, “I hate Christmas.”
“It’s the only logical reason.”
Laughing was her only reply. “What happened?”
“Shui,” Harry scoffed, half-laughing until he saw Malfoy’s eyes narrow in on him. He bit down on his smile and stared at the table. He was not expecting Malfoy of all people to follow that philosophy. Part of him had thought it was a joke.
"Hiss- Ssssssee go get him, he wants your mouths bussssy."
he thought, an uneasy feeling running through him, the only person he had told that too was Ron, who he was pretty sure he wouldn’t have willingly told Pansy... “Actually could I,” He said, “could I have your mobile number?” He asked.
Grieg laughed. “Except I’m always there, year-round.”
Harry bit down on his lip, trying to decide if he should fall for Draco’s teasing or not. He stepped closer to Draco, “I used to rent. Want me to show you some of my savage moves?”
Hermione lent back in her chair, “Why are the twins helping?”
“Bonsoir Famille Potter,” A little voice called from the sitting room. Dropping his blanket, Albus raced out to greet the guests and direct them into the living room.
“They are very similar.” Harry carefully said.
“But.” Draco said. It wasn’t a question, rather a statement. He tried to remain relaxed, but something deep down unnerved him.
Christmas Lights in Regent Street, London (The lights are big angels over the middle of the road)
Draco sighed, “Fine. I just thought that…” He let his words trail off to a level the other couldn’t hear, no matter how far inwards he lent.
“You came?” Harry stuttered, stepping back, examining his face.
“No, that’s whistling, but it’s brilliant whistling Albus!” Harry smiled. “Now do that, but through your nose, not your mouth.”
“Don’t encourage him.” Draco hissed as he passed by Pansy. Watching his son leave the room.
The last couple of chapters are taking longer to edit than planned, I've not abandoned this promise! Just taking some time for Christmas <3
Without him realising it Malfoy had taken a seat next to him, “While they do that, sets sort out the invites.” He said already picking up some paper and pens.
So, if you didn't notice the large grammar error pls ignore this.
Draco snorted, lifting an eyebrow, “To my office? Nope, never been here before.”
“You’re the worst comeback,” Draco argued burying his face into Harry’s neck.
“Hey.” Draco nodded, biting his lip.
Sighing, he bit down on his nervousness, he wanted this, and he was going to fight for it. He typed out a message and sent it. If Harry had decided he wanted nothing else to do with Draco, the least he could do is tell him.
“Mummy says you are so disorganised you’d forget your head if it wasn’t attached,” James said as he continued collecting bricks.
A Christmas market but the food stands this time.
“Pureblood traditions?”
“Papa?”
“But you call each other by your surnames,” Scorpius didn’t look convinced. Clever kid.
“Ha! So you have seen him?” Ginny shouted excitedly. As Harry realised, he hadn’t updated her on what had happened.
“Hello.” Harry waved.
“No,” Harry’s voice broke as he replied, spotting Draco’s knowing look. “Shut up,” he snapped then determinedly marched down the path.
Wait, was Potter really laughing?!
“Umm, we aren't...” Harry paused for a moment, scratching his head, “We kind of broke up...” He said, watching Draco.
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow with a small shrug as he put his phone away, “It felt like a dodgy phone call.” He replied bluntly.
“But now the plaster has been ripped off it’s over and we don't have to think about that entire idea ever again.”
“Papa?” Scorpius broke the moment.
“Nice try,” he paused “while I’ll accept those points, you have not won this argument.”
Special thank you for
Watching as Malfoy froze, eyebrows lowered in confusion as he watched Harry’s expressions carefully, “Mine?” He questioned, sounding as surprised as he looked.
A glass Stag.
“Noooo, nothing like that!”
Maybe Pansy forcing him outside wasn't the worst thing to happen this year. He'd made a discovery about Potter, and Pansy's downfall was made even sweeter as it came at the hands of the Gryffindor leader, Hermione Granger. It was almost worth the months of moaning he had to endure afterwards.
“I wanted an easy job.” Draco shrugged, cursing his legs for not listening to him and getting him out of there.
“The boys want to watch paw patrol. So I’m bored.” James stated crashing to the table.
for the help coming up with a name <3
Harry tried to bite back a smile, feeling a rush from the easy banter between.
“I do not run. I walk with passion.” Draco slipped his drink. Baffled how so many people from Hogwarts could be at one place at one time.
“Maybe tell me! She could have eaten me!”
“Who? And don’t you dare say my mother and Cersei!”
“Hey,” Harry smiled, realising he hadn’t said it before.
“I’m not making this up! Your pet snake is in my bed!”
Harry was oddly silent, not replying or moving for a while, “Er. Me?” He softly asked.
“About that, we are still watching GOT after lunch tomorrow with mother.”
Draco slowly took a breather.
“Hogwarts invites, almost like a reminder from childhood. That’s a half-decent idea.” Malfoy nodded as he grabbed the yellow paper.
Turning away, Harry finally spoke. “I know how hard it can be to try and break free from an overbearing family when you are young and defenceless.”
Word count: 317
“It’s the only way you are able to sleep.”
Harry noticed Malfoy hadn’t made a remark about that being his original idea. “Don’t act so surprised. I’m not stupid.” Harry settled on saying.
Pansy just stared open-mouthed and shook her head. She was still frozen in the same place as he walked past and knocked on the office door before he entered. Inside Draco had his head down frowning at several piles of paperwork.
Waking up, later on, Harry rubbed his eyes, glancing around the empty room. He slowly stood up still feeling wheezy. Before he wandered around the house, heading to the kitchen. Where he was shocked to find Sirius.
“You’re a baby, so Meh,” Draco mumbled sneezing.
Harry, however, didn’t move but flatly commented, “Laugh.”
“What now? Oh, hey Nagini.”
for Betaing my story <3
*Achoo Achoo*
“We’ve known each other for a long time.” Malfoy nodded in agreement.
Not that it was a date. If you didn’t want it to be a date.
Malfoy sat back in his chair frowning, “It’s still nice to receive a formal invite.” He counter-argued, tilting his head.
Hearing Pansy arrive Draco downed the rest of his coffee and returned to cleaning the breakfast items.
“So, you plan to mooch off me next?” Draco cocked an eyebrow, leaning a hip against the table, “Sorry Potter, but my building has standard.” Draco smirked.
“Mother,” Draco whined, In a voice that’s as close to whining as it could get while still maintain the decorum his family lived by.
A dark street full of Christmas lights.
“But you don’t need-” speechless Draco ducked his head. Harry couldn’t tell if he was trying to not laugh or cry, perhaps both.
“You can’t claim a hiding space!”
Understanding covering the others face as he never pushed for more information. Instead, the pair stood frozen, staring at each other. Harry couldn’t take it any longer, he looked away, and tried to break the tension, “I err, I’ll take these,” he stuttered, grabbing the bags at Malfoy’s feet and heading towards the dining room, praying his shaking wasn’t as viable as he thought it was. The dark mark and meaning behind it wasn’t an area he had thought about recently. He hadn’t realised how much it would affect him, or the ideas it would bring up. He knew he had to address it, especially if Malfoy was staying around. He realised this was something that would keep happening the longer they worked together. He mentally decided that would be the topic of his next therapy session.
“Seriously, What?!?! Name two ways they are similar!”
“It’s not warm enough,” Draco grumbled.
A huge thank you to Junk-ren & EasySarcasm for the help with the French
Draco shook his head, “No. I’ve got to check on the starters.” Draco made up an excuse, leaving Greg behind, before he could ask any more questions.
Before either one could reply, a large snowball came hurling towards them catching them both unawares, smashing into their shoulders. Draco’s already sore shoulder, he wanted to be noted. Before they could move the loose snow started to glow pink, fluttering around in the air, then coming back to join the snowball, which had hardened around the boy’s arm, glueing the pair together.
“That was me!” Harry shouted he could hear the offence in his voice as he lifted his phone up into the air.
“WHAT?! How on this entire planet, is my mother similar to Cersei?!”
“Shut up, Malloy.”
Huge thanks to Sunkelles for the inspiration for this Chapter <3
“To start you phoned the office so Pansy has it, but more importantly the weaslett gave it to me.” Malfoy shrugged, maintaining eye contact “She gave it to me as an emergency contact for when Albus came over in case something happened and I couldn’t get hold of her.” He explained.
“You are such a baby,” Harry hummed laying down next to Draco and pulling him into a cuddle.
“It’ll be fine, Harry will love it when he turns up.” Ron looked unconcerned.
"Momentos, clothes- Ouch!” Draco jumped and grabbed his head
Scorpius followed Pansy into the kitchen waving a piece of paper. “Auntie Pansy, Auntie Pansy, look at this!” Scorpius scrambled onto the chair at the island.
“I'm not falling for it Draco, go back to bed!” Harry shouted, really getting annoyed at these ‘Boy who called wolf’ attention-seeking methods Draco insisted on using.
Prompt:  “Did you get the chills?”
Harry was about to reply, informing Malfoy that the remaining dirt was holding the old house up. When he got distracted, watching Malfoy pulling his coat off, draping it across the back of the sofa. He was dressed in a suit again. The dark purple colour contrasting his skin, especially when Malfoy messed with his sleeve.
Why was he here? This was stupid. They where grown-ass adults. They survived a war! A childish snowball fight was unnecessary and unproductive.
“I don’t know,” Albus said, panicking at Harry’s reactions.
“I do hope you don’t mind my surprise visit. Just we have a task we need to discuss.” She said taking a seat at the table, skipping introductions.
Huge Thank you to maesterchill, for naming the Cafe "Wingardium Macchiato"
Staring at Draco now, Harry wondered if that was a flicker of hope he saw in the grey eyes.
Draco bit back his first response, noting the tip-bit for later use. “Sleep this off and we’ll see what you can do to me then.” He whispered, running a hand through Harry’s hair.
“Huh, presents,” Harry muttered under his breath as he scrunched his eyebrows. He had been so busy thinking about decorations and food and invites he forgot he had to buy people presents. It was such a big part of Christmas. How had that slipped his mind?.
Draco finally turned to look at him, “You’re moving?”
“Next year we send a mass text.” Harry declared.
Earning a stifled laugh from Draco who pulled back looking Harry in the eyes a small smile, “How very savour of you.” The twinkle in his eyes proved he knew how much Harry hated it and was baiting him. However, Harry could still see the glassy gaze from where Draco had frozen early. His chest hurting at the idea he had upset Draco. Harry let it slide. Watching as Draco stepped back correcting his suit as he moved around the office changing things.
“That’s because Dad is a disorganised mess,” James called while putting bricks back into the basket on the floor.
“For the guest invites,” Malfoy said, his face returning to neutral, the humour disappearing.
“You wouldn’t understand Malfoy, it’s called being Sentimental. Besides, this is eight years worth of stuff."
D: Just got home from an event so I couldn't check my phone.
“Potter! I’m telling you to hug me!” Draco finally snapped, flinging himself down on the bed in protest, sighing at how stupid Potter was.
When Pansy returned to her desk later that day, she had accomplished nothing. Weasley was sure Draco was going on Christmas day, but Draco hadn’t sounded so sure when she spoke to him. She had to do something. However, was struggling to think of what exactly. Lost in thought, she didn’t realise someone had entered until they spoke. Causing her to jump off her chair.
“That never happened,” Draco snapped, looking around to check if anyone had seen them.
“Draco come on.” Greg’s shoulder dropped as he tipped his head back.
“Tell who?” Draco lifted an eyebrow, lowering Harry back down to the sofa.
Malfoy glanced at Harry for a lifeline. Harry opened his eyes wide, hoping to portray an ‘I dunno’ message, causing the grey eyes to constrict.
“On your part, only I’m sure,” Draco winked, causing Harry’s heart to jump.
& Thank you to
“Not really no, you lost everything.”
Ron tipped some sugar into his drink, “Draco is coming over on Christmas day.” He said. “And the twins are working on some pranks to help move things along, they are going to install some while Harry’s out the house, then the rest on Christmas Day once Draco has arrived.”
“Mind explaining?, because I can’t.”
Draco stared wide-eyed, “You were there too?! It might as well have been a bloody school reunion!” He hissed, grabbing a drink from a passing server.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry looked around, his shoulders dropping when he spotted something. “Ah. I wondered what they had done.”
Malfoy meanwhile pulled out his phone, tilting his head to the side as he stared at the phone for a while before hitting reject.
12 Grimmauld Place.
Draco continued watching him, loosely crossing his arms, lips twisted at the edges, “Potter. How dare you imply I’d rent,” He said the word with disgust, “What kind of savage do you take me for?”
“Oh. Did he say anything?”
Prompt: You came
“If you really don’t want to be here, why even come?” Harry stated, having recovered from his laughing fit.
“No.” Albus guiltily answered.
Castles can be cold at night
“I wish it was. I really do.” This time Harry’s voice was quiet, causing another silence to fill the air.
Draco ended up helping Harry onto the Sofa, the other having injured his knee. Kreacher seemed to take some delight in informing them he needed time to brew a healing potion. Draco didn’t think it seemed that bad, however. The house-elf was off before he could reply. Which left the pair sitting on the sofa watching TV. While he had no clue what the show was, or who any of the characters were, Draco couldn’t stop watching, finding himself already invested in their lives.
Draco: Hi.
Draco nodded. Typical Potter leaving academics to the last minute. Following Teddy down the corridor.
“I’m not saying we don’t, I’m just saying perhaps another way.”
“We’ve got guests coming,” Harry called over his shoulder, grabbing several magazines and random paperwork from the coffee table trying to find somewhere to shove them.
for Betaing <3
“Pansy?” Harry raised an eyebrow.
“You can stop hiding in the corridor now Potter.” Draco’s cynical voice carried out from the open door.
Photo Prompt 7:
Which was apparently the worse idea, if Malfoy’s reaction was anything to go by. “A text?!” He snorted. A flood of emotions covering his face as he stared at Harry. Before settling on, “It’s not very festive.”
At the bottom of the stairs, he organised the abandoned shoes and pile of coats on the floor. The coat hooks had fallen off the wall months ago. Sirius has promised he’d fix them. Needless to say, it was still on the floor. Harry was going to admit defeat and let Ketcher fix it in a moment.
He whizzed into the boy’s rooms, grabbing items left, right and centre, only to realise Malfoy would not be entering the boy’s room. Opening his arms, he let the clutter fall straight back onto the floor. Deciding the mess in their rooms could stay.
“Yes..” Malfoy slowly commented furrowing his brow, “Pansy said you have completed your list of invitees?”
“Uncle Draco, can you help me do my schoolwork? Uncle Harry was helping me, but he got distracted. And I need to finish it before daddy gets home.”
Draco tried to not show his panic, “Excuse me?”
wc: 273
“Yes, why? Where do you shop?”
Harry itched his head, pretending to think about it. Earning a snort from Malfoy.
“We are the best of friends!” Harry chuckled, clapping Malfoy on the back as he beamed at his kids.
“Well, that didn't start life as a banana.”
“I am sorry, for nearly killing you, but same time not sorry,” Harry admitted as he nervously rubbed the back of his head.
Harry ran a hand over his chin, “handmade? Like the ones you get to Hogwarts as a child?” he smiled at the fond memories of that first letter he ever received.
“At the School pay.” Draco continued to clean the kitchen.
“Yes, they do.” Draco crossed his arms as Harry headed across the room towards the doorway.
“I don’t get it, is that a muggle joke?”
“Soppy bloody blob,” Draco hissed and rolled his eyes, “But thank you for the offer. However, I’m still not helping buy your wife’s present.”
Harry tried to not smirk at Malfoy’s overreactions, finding the entire situation a lot more entertaining than he had expected. “Sure, I mean I’m not going to turn people away.”
“It’s snow. What did you expect?” Draco found himself replying without thinking.
“We do like each other,” Malfoy shot Harry a look asking for help again.
Relief covered Sirius’ face, “He left a couple of hours ago.”
“Try your duvet.”
“Harry.” It was odd hearing Malfoy using his first name, though not as odd as the warm smile that came with it.
Draco’s heart stopped. That was far too much information for him. This family was going to be the end of him. He was sure of that.
“Ew, married people vibes,” Pansy hissed. Lifting her fingers into a small cross shape, hoping to propel the very thoughts and idea away from herself.
Harry felt his face fall, Malfoy had to be joking. He watched the other, waiting for the other to crack. He didn’t. “You’re joking, right? She’s a daemon in human form,” Harry settled on asking.
Ginny burst out laughing. “An angel that broke Plumpton’s nose this morning, bloody idiot can’t throw to save his life.”
He came to a stop in front of the door, which was plain in every single way. His hand rested on the doorknob. A quick turn and he would—
Ron just grunted.
“Oh, no.” Harry said glibly “I was planning on being extra clumsy with this cursed magical artefact before you said that Hermione. Thanks”
She started to feel a lot more sympathetic towards him, however, when Draco quietly told her that Halloween was the day Harry’s parents had died.
Neville let out a squeak, quickly tying the cloth around his eyes. He was suddenly plunged into a strange yellow-y blindness. “There’s a basilisk down here?”
“Explain yourself, boy.” One of the men boomed. Ron vaguely recognised the voice of Amos Diggory.
The two shared a panicked glance, then moved quickly around her and headed, walking backwards, towards the door.
Harry seemed excited to pull Neville along everywhere, especially. “Can’t believe you’ve lived in London your whole life and never been to the muggle parts,” he scolded in disbelief.
Once he finds his best friend's sister dead on a damp floor and when the basilisk comes for him he does nothing to stop it.
Her mum’s cheeks were suspiciously flushed. George caught Ginny’s eyes and smirked. She stifled a giggle behind her hand. Mum had a small bookshelf full of Gilderoy Lockhart books. She and George had once opened one to find that their mum had circled Gilderoy’s name in little hearts on the title page. Ginny didn’t really get why her mum loved him so much. Every time she saw the man smile she got the overwhelming desire to punch him.
Which was just—Hermione threw her hands into the air in frustration. Dumbledore blinked. He blinked again. Harry stared placidly back at him.
“Yeah,” Ginny said with a shrug. “But, something happens in this place, it eventually tracks back to you, you know?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’m not really bothered about being on the front page, thanks anyway”
“Glad I didn’t have to get up that early” Hermione said, wrinkling her nose.
“Non! Without you I would have never come this far.” Fleur was beaming at Tonks, eyes trained on the shorter woman like dazzling lasers. “You will owl me this summer, and next year help me settle, non?”
They were fucked.
In the next silence black holes were formed and died. The longest living killer whale was born and died peacefully in his sleep, finally becoming one with the earth and the sea floor as he’d always dreamed he would as a baby killer whale.
“I wasn’t aware Sybil remembered her prophecies.”
They trailed about in one cluster, Hermione and Harry leading them like ruffled ducks. They loitered in record shops and laughed as Fred and George pawed their way through vintage 70’s jackets in a myriad of disgustingly clashing shades.
Harry laughed lightly, “She has a point. You can’t just blame her because she’s a Slytherin.” Pansy looked put out to be defended by Harry, and Snape looked furious at the implication.
“Prove it." Hermione demanded, voice just a touch more petulant than she would have liked.
In fact, she thought of all the girls she knew. Angelina, Katie and Alicia from the team. Her roommates, Megan and Lucinda. Professor McGonagall and Sprout and Madame Hooch. Luna. Luna, Luna, Luna. They weren’t less because they were girls or women, or more. They were just equal. Just as different and odd and brilliant as all of her brothers were.
“Strong start to the year.” Iphigenia Watts said with a smile, passing them each an edition of the paper. She came to Harry last, “I’d worried people would have—"
The morning of September first was unsurprisingly hectic. All four of them woke up late, blamed the others for this, and spent the whole morning bickering and alternatively dodging/throwing forgotten items around the house in the vain hope that they would reach already overstuffed trunks.
Ginny glanced at Harry to see what he thought but found that he didn’t seem to be paying attention to the conversation at all. He was staring at Ginny’s cauldron of books intensely, brow furrowed in thought.
“And we both know that’s a corrupt system that is easily abused” Luna pointed out smugly.
Ginny shrugged. She had a free first period so was eating her porridge at a leisurely pace. “It’ll be me next year.” She said around her spoon. “Plus, knowing Harry he’ll get exams cancelled for you.”
Ginny’s eyes lit up and anxiety bubbled in Luna’s stomach. “What are you and Hermione always whispering about?”
“Luna you never said!” Ginny exclaimed, looking upset “You can’t stay alone all of Christmas”
The first edition of “The Hogwarts Oracle” was distributed outside the great hall in mid-February. Iphigenia Watts, a fifth-year half-blood Ravenclaw who Luna was secretly quite intimidated by, stood proudly on a soapbox advertising it. She was the editor-in-chief of the Oracle and never a more organised captain had there been. She kept a tight schedule, and an even tighter ship.
“Would you like a jelly-bean?” Luna said, holding her nearly empty paper bag of them out to him. He blinks at them and then a slow grin forms.
_______________________
Instead of a boggart, Draco opened the door to a flurry of charmed confetti (which floated back to the ceiling after it had fallen so as to fall again) and Ron and Harry shouting Happy Birthday in his face as Ron tried and failed to pop a Party-popper.
Harry was staring down into the hole he’d created, and he beckoned Hermione forward. She went over to him, and Ginny followed. When she looked down into the hole, she saw a half-buried green velvet ring box, musty with age.
Ron glanced sideways at Harry and Hermione. They were sharing a Look. Harry and Hermione often shared Looks that Ron wasn’t privy too. Ron placed the anxiety this caused him where he placed all uncomfortable things: Deep,
They began to make their way back to Snape’s office, both grim in the face of the day’s events. Watching the entire student body from elf-sized first years to pre-caffeine frazzled seventh year’s desperately chase after Harry had had an absurd comedy to it, but it hadn’t been anything close to funny. Not with the dazed emptiness in their eyes as they followed them mindlessly.
It was hardly a beat later that Harry turned away from them, storming his way up a hill. Ron had noticed tears brimming in his eyes before he’d left. Ron watched a small explosion burst from the ground where Harry pointed his wand.
Ron did react slightly to this. His face flushed a shade of orange to make the Chudley Cannons proud.
After only a year, they were married. The sharp inventor and the lunatic failed reporter.
Ron nodded contemplatively. It was definitely odd to find out bits and pieces of the ‘other world’ as Harry called it. The past few days had been exhaustive on Ron’s cognitive processing.
Tonks’ lessons were always interesting. Either because she’s actually a pretty fun teacher or because she was a terrible adult.
Harry grinned wildly, “Leonard never goes out of style.”
“Harry, Peter Pettigrew is dead.” He said, slowly, “He’s been dead for ten years.”
You see in some versions the happy ending isn't as clear. In some versions, like this one, Harry Potter is shown the whole world, and hardly gets to see it at all. But he is happy, so childishly happy, and in my opinion this version is the kindest I've come across. I run my hands over this boys lives and they appear like books in a library. Endless shelves, running on into infinity. Some spines stretch for miles- telling the story of a life long lived. Others last only an inch.
“This might not actually do anything, you know. Everyone might just ignore you” Hermione hissed after Harry as he headed up the stairs to the boys dormitory.
Luna smiled and stroked the cat. She bent down next to its ears and whispered “I think your dads just got engaged. You better be excited”
(Xenophilius was a big fan of musicals. By the age of seven Luna had seen
“Hey. You going to this Defence group thingy?” Ginny said, slightly less polite then she meant to be.
“Cover your eyes” He said, and they hardly had the chance to do so before she heard harry yell ‘reducto’ and there was a small explosion as the floor boards tore themselves to shreds.
“I just mean,” pausing to choose his words carefully before he continued
“For that sales job… yes.” Draco replied, turning his body to face Greg.
"Umm yes, yes it's you speaking," Draco took pride in stating.
“Malfoy?!” Harry jumped around pulling his mask off, as Draco did the same. Staring at each other, unmoving, they sat for a few moments.
“Technically you've only been in this room one year.”
“Meh? Draco that’s the worst comeback you’ve ever come up with,” Harry said with amusement.
“I know that’s why I have it!” Harry failed to pull the duvet back before Draco lay down, using his pillow. About to push the boy out of his bed a thought crossed Harry's mind,
Malfoy rolled his eyes, “Don’t worry Potter, I won’t try to use humour again.”
Harry lent back in his chair, watching Malfoy. “Whenever?” He shrugged. Wanting to laugh when Malfoy finally looked up with complete disbelief on his face.
“Gosh, it’s cold out there!” The unmistakable voice of Potter commented, causing him to freeze.
I’m glad you enjoyed it. I did.
The small glimmer of hope-filled Harry’s heart. He knew it shouldn’t but it did. The more he tried to not think about it, the more it grew. Draco was on the phone and he was not happy.
*Whistling*
Prompt: "Scared Potter?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Either way, I really enjoyed going flying and I'm sorry for ruining the evening at the end.
“The twins, they put something on the snow. I think it’s based on some kind of temporary sticking charm, maybe an Apodoficus Epoximise type spell,” Neville paused, looking thoughtful.
"What?"
“Aww is your poor hand getting tired lifting that heavy stamp?” Draco chuckled, dramatically shaking his hand as he spoke, amusement dancing in his eyes.
Harry awkwardly chuckled, hands still on Draco’s waist, “Yer the bannister decoration doesn’t like when you mess with it.” Easily understanding what happened. “It’s had to be wrestled out of Remus and Sirius’s room far too many times.”
“No, I mean I don’t think we should watch it.”
“But you are not friends?” Scorpius continued. Harry would have laughed at the pair’s interrogation of Malfoy if he wasn’t too busy being floored by the guy’s patience.
“Fineeeee but I want the effort I'm putting in noted down," Draco's overly dramatic tone matched his movement, as he managed the entire two steps to reach the pillow. Quickly realising this wasn't getting him the attention he so rightfully deserved, Draco started to wander around Harry's half of the room, inspecting and moving everything.
Draco lifted his head to look at the other, “Friendship was all I dared hope for,” He said with a small smile.
Draco put down the box he was holding. It seemed thinking they could finish everything early was far too optimistic. “I can see it now, ‘Boy who lived twice, defeated by the final step.” Draco chuckled.
Harry bit down a smile as he came up with an idea, “Hi, I’m Harry!” He smiled, sticking his hand out, regretting the motion when Malfoy didn’t shake his hand immediately.
Sticking his head into the living room, he wanted to cry at the Legos now covering the entire floor again. But the Boys seemed happy, so he left them to it.
“I already have your number.” Malfoy finally replied.
“Why have I never seen it?” Pansy eyebrows raised in more shock and betrayal.
D: Why should I?
Harry bit back a laugh, thinking she would kill him if he did laugh.
Draco tilted his head slightly and knitted his eyebrows together.
“Draco,” Narcissa paused taking a deep breath “We are in the wrong, I know this goes against everything I’ve raised you to believe, but trust me it’s for the best.”
“Well, they told us both,” Harry chuckled, removing his hand and sticking them both in his pockets.
H: I’m actually glad you texted. I really enjoyed our date.

“Either way it’s a lovely surprise Draco, please come get some tea.”
Greg shrugged a shoulder, “She may have mentioned it. But it was more seeing you buying a Christmas tree together...”
“Both loving mothers and powerful women.” Draco’s eyes narrowed,
“Don’t worry, I will do it!” He could hear the excitement in her voice. “How’s Draco doing?”
“Humph,” Draco mirrored his roommate & rolled onto his side. '
“So, I guess I’ll see you around.” Harry broke the silence, as he offered a tentative smile.
C'est un chandail très intéressant
“Draco.” Harry sassed towards him, receiving an instant response.
“It should not be this cold for November.”
Glancing down at the phone, it surprised Harry to see the contact already saved under ‘Draco Malfoy’. The uneasy feeling filling him again. That was easy, too easy. Besides, ‘Draco’ seemed informal, far too informal for the awkward work type situation they had been through. Would Malfoy give him his personal number just like that?. Without thinking, Harry hit the call button. Nearly jumping out his skin when music played from Malfoy’s pocket. Shocked it was a real number, let alone Malfoy’s own number.
Diagon Alley was as packed and swarming as it had been her whole life. Posters proclaimed colourfully about new inventions, special deals and sales. Hawkers stood outside packed shops waving parchment flyers and shouting happily that they could “Buy one jar of powdered frog, get a gnats head free!”. She could see even from the entrance to the high-street that Flourish and Blotts was overflowing. There was a long skating line going all the way to Quality Quidditch Supplies.
They sat in silence, each of them wrapped up in their own thoughts. Harry looked fraught; his hands balled into fists around handfuls of his robes.
“You’re a really good friend, Hermione.” He said, and gave her a fleeting hug. He was gone and up the stairs before she could even think to hug him back.
Ron had a stomach of lead that could probably withstand a nuclear accident but even his digestive system winced in sympathy. There was only so long you could go as an Englishman, he hypothesised, before good ol’ bangers and mash became a necessary tool of survival.
Harry blinked, shifting about nervously. In fact, Hermione was pretty sure he hadn’t stood still at all through out this exchange. Just continually twitched oddly.
Hermione thought there was certainly a marked change from how Harry had treated Draco at the start of the year. Every now and then the two would even deign to spend one on one time together. Hermione saw this as an obvious spelling of the apocalypse.
They were silent for a stretch and Ron weighed up the pros and cons of sneaking off to bed without them noticing. But he knew that it wasn’t what the Harry J Potter school of eavesdropping would have him do, so he stayed still.
Harry passed her an identical present, square and neatly wrapped with her name printed on it. She smiled at him in thanks.
“I know what you meant. Sorry.” Harry muttered, “I was just thinking…” Harry paused, “About your parents.”
“Please, I’m a Malfoy, they’ll love me,” Draco easily shrugged.
Photo Prompt 4:
Harry’s reply was cut off by the whoosh of the Floo in the other room activating. He wanted to hit himself on the head; he hadn’t even made it to that room yet.  “Too late,” Harry sighed, throwing the remaining items behind the sofa, unsurprised to find all the items James had tidied up, there.
“No, they don’t.” He said leaving the room, before shouting, “Feng-Shui doesn’t exist. Watch as nothing bad happ-“ His voice cut off by a loud bashing sound.
“Move over! I’m not sharing a bed with a giant snake!”
As soon as his feet touched the ground, Harry was thrown into a crush of victory hugs alongside his teammates. His ears felt numb from the speed he had been flying at, muffling the cheers slightly. Ignoring them all, Harry slowly slipped away from the crowd, finding himself pulled to the edge of the pitch where he’d spotted a head of white hair leaning against the stand during the game; A smile tugging on his lips.
Draco had taken the chance to head into the dining room, still rubbing his leg. He was already sorting boxes when Harry arrived. Draco hadn’t said a single word since the incident. From his current body language, it was near impossible to tell what he was thinking. Unsure what he should say or do, Harry silently helped him crush boxes. Slowly turning the place back into a dining room from the storage hub it had been.
“Well, in business and formal situations you would use their last name, then when you are in an informal and friendly situation you use their first name.” Malfoy seemed unfazed by the random question.
“Well, about that,” Harry stuttered. He wasn’t entirely sure what type it was, however, knowing the twins he was pretty sure, “We probably, I think, it’s probably a kiss.”
H: But you never message me
Pansy titled her head smirking, “I wasn’t going to say anything. Nothing about you and Potter, or your disregard for your own rules on unscheduled meetings.”
Draco stepped forwards, kissing Harry on the temple with a small smile, “Do all the rooms have this spell?” Returning to his usual, as if the entire incident hadn’t happened.
“What are you going to do about it?” Draco sassed as he sat up trying to bait a reply.
“What?” Harry felt the blood drain from his face. Confusion hitting him.
“Sarcasm isn’t becoming of you, Potter.” Malfoy smirked.
(See the end of the chapter for
“If I knew one, we’d already be free!” Draco snapped. Harry merely closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead. Draco wasn’t going to stand by and get ignored like this.
“Send your owl ASAP, otherwise the food will be fed to Luna’s omnomnomer,” Malfoy said, sending Harry a blank expression.
“Why don’t you think up a spell then genius? Don’t just sit there!” Finding that received no reaction, Draco started to think of something else to shout at the stupid Potter.
“You misheard, Harry said ‘Duck’ like the animal.” His ability to come up with an excuse, amazing even himself.
“I am not.”
“Malloy?” Draco bit back a laugh, Before looking at Harry and bursting out laughing, anyway.
“Hey. Hey. Hey, shh, don’t tell him.” Harry scrambled back up, crashing into Draco’s chest.
“They are all different. The pink means you are stuck together until you kiss,” Neville shrugged casually.
“Bye Harry!” Was all he heard as the pair raced out of the room to show their mum  “The amazing stuff we made today!” He had to chuckle.
Harry took a deep breath, biting his lip, “I don’t want to ruin this, or put a damper on anything.”
“What?!” Draco practically choked on his words, as the sound of snowballs hitting nearby grabbed the other’s attention.
“You truly are an angel!” He smiled.
“Relax, I’ve spent my whole life acting, I was born for this,” Draco straightened his cuff.
“Obviously I came,” a generic Malfoy eye roll, “I’m your...”
Several presents under a tree, wrapped in both red and green wrapping paper with gold and silver ribbon.
“I hate you!” Draco managed through sneezes, “Tell anyone and I will hex you.”
Two thongs with 'When I think of you I touch my elf' written across them. One white one red.
Harry took the letter and checked it over, before performing a quick Geminio spell. The letters copied themselves out, ready till in the names and addresses.
Harry thought, slowly creeping closer to the living room. It had been four weeks since the stupid situation had started. Maybe now it would finally come to the end and he’d be free. It’s not that he’s against the actual idea it’s just the people around when it’s executed.
A tree, the branch with red buds on it (Flowers unidentified by my unknowledgeable self)
Photo Prompt 5:
“You know how important this is, that they believe we are a couple,” Harry debated cancelling the entire thing.
“You alright?” Harry asked, looking over his shoulder.
Ron ended her fun with three words seconds later. “That’s already sorted.”
This chapter involves Drinking & getting drunk, While nothing bad happens just people sounding really stupid. I'll add a chapter summary at the bottom if anyone wants to skip this chapter.
“To start off, I forgot I needed to buy presents for people.” He rolled onto his back, waving around the room.
“Someone’s caught a cold,” Harry called in a sing-song voice from his desk across the room.
Draco flexed his fingers, trying to work out what he should say next. Settling on, saying nothing instead.
“Well, I can kind of see where she’s coming from.”
“It’s a wonderful machine called a ‘printer’, do they not have them in the ministry?” Draco raised an eyebrow, his eyes smirking.
for the Beta <3
Too late. Harry thought, wondering what kind of present it was. Ratting the plastic bag, realising it was big and foldable. Opening the bag he couldn’t help but smile, it wasn’t a present after all. Rather his jumper. Draco was giving him his favourite Weasley jumper back.
“I’m sure we could find out.”
“Are you sure?” He questioned, gripping onto the old material.
Teddy had been full-on since he found out the boys would be staying with Ginny till Christmas Eve. Harry knew it was just down to him being bored however he was already struggling to deal with it.
“Hey, It’s okay, we don’t have to.” Harry let go of Draco’s waist, letting the shirt fall back down.
“I didn’t put the thought in his head before you ask.” Ron raised his hands in surrender.
“Thanks, Malfoy," Harry dryly comments.
A Reindeer pulling a sledge with snow around him.
“What if he tries to invite Draco himself beforehand?” Pansy asked. Knowing Draco just the pure realisation that he hadn’t been invited in the first place would be enough to have him running to the hills and far away from Potter as possible.
“What?”
“How do you do this for a living?” Harry asked, His arm was so tired he’d happily never see another stamp again, yet Draco did it all year round.
“So I heard you’ve been spotted with Potter.” A familiar voice muttered behind him.
Draco titled his head to the side, the unreadable expression on his face once more, “Any clue how we get out?”
A snowy tunnel, with white trees around it and 2 sets of tire marks going into the tunnel.
, (Turns out even 120 words have errors in them)
Hearing a low chuckle, he glanced up in time to see Malfoy shaking his head, smiling down at the coloured paper in his hands, as he set up the boys, including pulling out an extensive collection of pens all in rainbow order. The big fancy kind, that as a child Harry remembered looking at in shops and wishing he could own.
“You know how the kids invited all the other kids? Well, Albus wanted to invite Scorpius. So Harry did that dot thing for Albus to follow. Albus followed the dots, wrote the message and gave it to Scorpius. Who gave it to Draco to read. In reality, Harry just wrote it out, thinking it was a fun and sweet moment for the boys without realising what he was doing. But Draco thinks it’s an invite where Harry was too embarrassed to do it himself, So he convinced Albus to invite Scorpius, to secretly invite Draco.” Ron used his hands to explain.
Harry looped his hands around Draco’s waist and tightened them. Once more Draco was easily pulled forwards. The pair staring at each other. Neither one wanting to be the first to move. However, they both slowly leaned in, millimetres at a time, Harry feeling like he was playing a game of gay chicken. Made worse when Draco’s fingers gripped his legs, almost teasingly. Harry ran his hand down Draco’s side, catching the edge of his shirt on the way up. Pulling the material as he went, his fingertips touching the bare skin. Within a second, Draco stopped breathing, his body tensing up eyes went wide. Harry loosened his grip, sitting back so he could look at Draco. Who was intently staring at the ground, still tense.
“Huh?” Malfoy turned confusion in his eyes, while his eyebrows knitted together.
“Same.” Silence again. “Soooo,” Harry drew out, “know any spells to get out of this?”
“I want to whistle like Albus!” Scorpius pointed to the offending boy who looked happy as Larry at the fact he could now whistle.
Pansy smiled, having not realised how much she liked Gran- Weasley.
Malfoy nodded, “It’s a start, and we have time before Christmas day, little and often.” He commented standing in the middle of the room, almost looking like he was afraid to touch anything.
However, he didn’t get far before Harry gripped his arm, pulling him back down. Draco could feel his face going red. He threw his head back against the sofa rest, looking at the ceiling. “I wanted an excuse to talk to you.”
Harry, meanwhile, leant forwards, pressing their lips together. Getting over the initial shock, Draco felt himself start to respond, pushing into the kiss. Leaning even closer when he felt the warmth from Harry’s arm on his good shoulder. Causing Potter’s lips to move into a smile as he started to pull away. Catching himself as he leant forwards, Draco froze, attempting to sit up, however, Potter's arm on his shoulders held him still as their foreheads pressed together, Harry watching him with an almost smirk.
“Err, Yer, So I can contact you directly?” Harry mumbled, regretting his question. He itched the back of his head.
The party had started 10 minutes ago, and Draco was already done with it. Glancing at his phone, he tried to not feel disappointed at the lack of messages once again. Sensing someone appearing next to his shoulder.
Pulling away seconds later when Draco didn’t react. Feeling the barrier against his back disappeared, letting him step into the hallway. “Sorry. I, erm.” He muttered, shocked at what he had just done.
Photo Prompt 2:
Silence filled the room, as Draco’s words soaked in.
“We can hardly use your handwriting. We need the guests to understand it’s an invitation, not a death threat or ancient summoning sigil,” Malfoy swiped, cocking an eyebrow.
"Getting Nagini out of your bed, so you can get out my bed, and I can get into mine and sleep." He stated, choosing the high road and ignoring that stupid nickname.
“Please, camo? Could you get any inconspicuous?” He raised an eyebrow.
He was aware of Draco watching him, “Let me guess it’s a type of sticking charm?”
“Delightful,” Draco replied, flinging the slimy object across the room. It bounced off the wall and slid down the back of a chest, causing something to move. Draco froze as he processed the dark green object slithering towards him. Realising what it was he screamed, jumping onto his bed.
Tower Bridge at night, all the Christmas lights turned on and a blue tree Christmas tree at the front.
A shiver ran the full way down Harry’s body. He looked directly into Draco’s eyes, “Never.” He said, placing a hand of Draco’s cheek, removing the small distance between them as he brashly kissed Draco.
“Gold star for Potter, he’s learning.” Draco playfully sassed. “Back in the days of courtships, people only got a chance to speak to others outside of the family at balls, so Christmas gave the perfect opportunity to make connections. The more balls, the more chances for these to be made.”
“Someday. I can’t crash here forever; we’ve already intruded on Sirius and Remus for too long. Where do you live?”
“Meh?” Potter repeated, then promptly starting to laugh.
"You're the alien here, you explain," Dracos replied with an almost flustered voice. Harry made a mental note to return to this topic later, he suspected there was more to that story.
Entering the Dining room, he distracted himself with attempting to find space for the extra bags amongst the mount of packages stacked high. Every morning extra boxes would arrive, several of them holding items Harry was sure he’d told Malfoy he didn’t want.
Malfoy chuckled, his face a gentle smile. “Do you want to invite the other kids to Christmas?”
Malfoy resumed his original position, whatever words he was going to say getting cut off by two small kids entering the room. “Perfect timing boys,” he said, pulling items from the bag.
“What?”
Draco turned to stare back at the TV shaking his head, willing his heart rate to calm down, “Consider it charity work.”
“Well sorry, for thinking you might like my number,” Harry said childishly, feeling worse when Malfoy chuckled in response.
Huge Thank You to
“Are you not friends?” Albus joined in.
“Oh, but I am,” Draco smirked, stepping up close to Harry, looking at his lips. Their bodies flush. Harry bit his lips as he lent forwards. “Let’s finish these decorations,” Draco whispered when their lips were inches away from the others. Stepping back, he headed out of the room. Harry closed his eyes, dropping his head backwards. Apparently, Draco had his teasing hat on, and Harry loved it.
“Uncle Harry says he wants to fuck you.”
“Fool me once.” Draco warned, shaking his head. He’d already organised their wedding, a reminder of why he never organised weddings, and their baby shower, again another reminder why he’d never do that again.
Harry laughed beside him, before grabbing his forearm, “Good one. But seriously, how much?”
Draco’s eyes tracked down to the cup and up again to Harry’s face, shock covering his expression as he accepted it before staring at it for a while. Then back at Harry, finally taking a sip. “That’s. How did you know my order?”
“That’s the one! Looking at the Head of Tree’s sales.” Greg smiled with pride in his eyes, “I took an early lunch break, the tills are bloody hard work, I was just coming back when I saw you two paying. By the time I got across the courtyard, you had run off. Bloody shame I’d have given you the work discount, it’s a good 20% as well, but I’d take some more off for you!” Grieg nudged his shoulder.
“Friend,” Draco finished.
“No. This is me and Scorpius' first Christmas together. We are staying here and having a quiet day.” Draco walked past her, refusing to continue.
“Draco. It’s nice to meet you, Harry.” Malfoy offered one of his rare genuine smiles as he finally returned the handshake, moments before Harry was going to give up.
“It’s just something we do.” he said. Hand still on Malfoy’s back, attempting to look like friends. Ignoring the slim back, he could feed under the clothing.
“Can we help draw things?” Albus asked, reaching for the pot of glitter. Harry’s heart sank as he prayed the lid was on tight.
“Quite a few I’d imagine.” Harry tried to count them, however, got confused as he went. There were a lot of kids.
H: Well I’m willing to try and make it up
“What do you mean, Longbottom?” Draco snapped at the guy stood not far away from the pair, watching them.
“Won what? Potter, I'm too tired to play these games.”
Draco shook his head, still not fully looking up, voice quiet and shaker then before “I, I can’t. Not in my office.”
“And a blank piece of paper is a formal invite?” Harry picked up the blank card, snorting.
“Scorpius what are you- Noo!” Draco, who had otherwise been distracted trying not to laugh, spoke too late, He sighed “why did you put a pen lid up your nose?”
Smart boy, Pansy chuckled. While she wouldn’t do anything herself, she was a Slytherin after all. “I’m here concerning two of our acquaintances,” Pansy said.
“No, I’m not listening to this.”
On top of the phone box is #Snowmanjourney.
“Oh, you got hit,” The voice was unjudging, rather just a statement.
“I need tea,” Harry said, heading to the kitchen.
Malfoy tilted his head, the corner of his lip moving. “So I was right.” he smiled watching as Harry huffed in annoyance.
The pair stood in silence for a while, the atmosphere turning awkward.
“Oh, Erm,” Harry mumbled
Sighing, he pulled out his phone. Flicking through the previous text messages once more, noticing Harry hadn’t messaged him. His mind was full of memories from the night before in Harry’s room. He closed his eyes and lent his head against the wall. It had been nearly a full day already, and still no word from Harry.
Malfoys eyes came alight with entertainment at the idea, “Really Potter?” he smirked.
“Oh, wow, look at that! Talk Papa through the list! What have we got here?” Malfoy asked, pulling his son onto his lap. Harry watched the tenderness Malfoy used when interacting with his son. Making him smile, especially when Scorpius broke into a happy chat about how the various things showed other objects. So excited about explaining his picture, he never noticed Malfoy making his own list of things Scorpius wanted.
Draco turned around noting there was, in fact, a body still in Harry’s bed. '
“Try having to live with her.” He grumbled.
“If only there was something warm & soft in this room I could use,” Draco dramatically stated before bursting into another sneezing fit.
Pansy re-applied her lipstick and checked her hair before entering the shop. It was quaint. In a, she'd happily never return kind of way. Skirting around the tables with children, her target was at the back of the shop.
Returning to their stations, the pair continued their invite work. Silently working together, Harry was relieved to feel the atmosphere wasn’t tense, rather an easy quiet one. Until James wandered into the room, swinging his arms and sighing.
“Well don’t try to cuddle the radiator then,” Harry chuckled completely unaware of Draco’s reactions.
“I live here.” Sirius frowned. “You didn’t hit your head when you fell, did you?”
“Hisss- My perfect planss to helpss you and Draco.”
Written for the January 2020 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge;
"No. Just no."
"Students have started school so it's autumn.” Draco shrugged, picking an invisible stitch on his bedding, as Harry continued cleaning.
“I did.”
“Well I should—” Harry threw a thumb over his shoulder.
Standing in silence for a bit, Harry burst out laughing, “Well it appears we are both stupid now.”
"On what planet does a snake feel like someone's foot?"
Harry suddenly felt flustered. He had been waiting, but Draco didn’t need to know that. “Why would I wait for you?” He snorted.
At the sound of huffing Harry looked up and his shoulders dropped, “Ahh Teddy no. You don’t charge at people.” Harry tried to scold the child who was standing pouting as he stomped on the ground with his foot several times. “Teddy,” Harry warned. Knowing it would have no effect.
“That’s not explaining anything.”
“See Uncle Harry, this is why mafoot says you shouldn’t mess around on steps,” Teddy said, apparently the crash had aroused his curiosity.
After a while of silence, Malfoy entered the room, with his usual fare, any trace of worry from before covered. Along with his arms, both sleeves had been rolled back down, cufflinks in place. Harry noticed.
“That’s an actual place?. I thought that was a joke made up by Mother to scare people.”
It didn’t take long before Harry was shuffling around in his seat, looking at Draco, then glancing away.
Regardless he could feel Harry’s eyes on him, with some kind of understanding in them.
“We went to school together,” Malfoy said with a slight blush covering his face. “Where’s your list of names and addresses?” he commented.
A plate full of Gingerbread men.
Pansy meanwhile picked up the paper, her eyes going wide with excitement as Draco could feel his heart drop. Having forgotten about it.
“Just you wait, you’ll see soon,” Harry said as he felt his legs getting grabbed, “Oh. They have cornered me. I think they have sensed your presence.” He laughed, sitting up and handing the phone to James and Albus who had snuck up on him without warning.
“But, you’re trying to aim higher now?” Harry clarified.
Malfoy had already started talking as he crossed the room, eyeing the boxes stacked haphazardly in the corner with disdain.
“Scared, Potter?” Draco smirked as they came to a stop outside the gate.
“What was I supposed to do? She had nowhere to go.”
Draco came to a stop in front of the desk, “If you are planning on carrying on. You have to tell me why you are wearing your scheming outfit?”
The sound of huffing grabbed his attention as he turned to spot Malfoy still staring at him with the unreadable expression. “If you’ve finished playing statues, why don’t you join me in doing some actual work?” Malfoy sassed sitting down at the table.
“This is my hiding spot! You can bugger off!” Draco finally broke the silence, feeling like those green eyes were boring into his soul.
“O, This quilted duvet is glorious.”
“The jumper. It looks better on you, you can keep it,” Harry couldn’t believe he’d give his favourite jumper away just for a chance to flirt.
“Have you turned on the heating?”
“Yes, Scorpius?” Draco’s smile turned more relaxed as he looked at his son across the table.
“Why did Albus put a pen lid up his nose?” Scorpius innocently asked.
“Yes?” Malfoy’s attention was pulled to his son.
“Aliens, you've been experimented on by aliens.”
“Draco. It's 3 am, shut up so I can go back to sleep,” Harry huffed, as he snuggled back into the warm embrace of his duvet cocoon.
Once silence had fallen again, Draco sat down.
Draco looked up from his phone screen trying to bite back a smile, debating what the best reply would be.
Greg had brought up a fair point. Was Draco supposed to bring him as a plus one, were they at the stage? Harry had invited him to the Carols, that was a group event, perhaps Draco was supposed to invite him to something as well. Sneaking through the service door, Draco lent against the wall, finishing his drink before placing the empty glass on a tray heading back into the kitchen.
Draco tried to not look at him, keeping his face neutral and eyes on the TV. “Honestly, don’t worry about it.” He wanted the topic to end.
“Look, It’s an invite for Christmas day! We are going to see Albus on Christmas Day!” Scorpius was chatting as he pointed to several spots on the invite.
Once again Thank You to my lovely Beta
“Oh, you wouldn’t be laughing if you’d seen naked Sirius attacking a plant as many times as I have.” Harry shook the idea out of his head.
Photo Prompt:
“Do you ever feed your kids, Potter?” Malfoy said, eyeing the speed the kids ate at. Harry was realising that it wasn’t a personal attack on him, rather Malfoy just having to make some sort of remark about anything and everything.
“She forced most people to come. Terrifying, that girl.”
“I would, but they're frozen open because my eyelashes feel like icicles.”
“How am I supposed to sleep in this desolate arctic castle?”
Written for the October 2019 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge;
“Oh,” Draco quietly commented, meeting Harry’s eyes.
Earning a raised eyebrow from Draco, “Ginny told you.”
“Thanks,” Draco’s voice was as quiet as a mouse. He thought Harry hadn’t heard until the guy turned and stared with a confused expression. “For the whole trial thing.” Could his voice get any quieter? Good grief he was a Malfoy. What would his father say about him now? Noticing the way Harry hadn’t replied, Draco continued on. “I don’t blame you for my Father either. He deserved to go to prison, but it’s still hard.” Shut up, shut up, shut up, This cold weather really was affecting his brain, bloody Pansy.
Photo Prompt 6:
“Okay. It’s fine, We can get it out. Just breathe out! No, breathe through your nose. Now close your mouth and breathe through your nose.” Harry continued with his instructions, Albus not understanding.
“Well, hi to you too,” Harry muttered under his breath. Before shrugging it off, “Err not much, just some bits and pieces,” He attempted to look uninterested, casting an eye over the room, proud to find it looking much more presentable than the last time Malfoy had arrived.
Written for the November 2019 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge;
“Albus, I can see it. Why did you do that?” Harry tried to keep the panic out of his voice, knowing he was failing.
“Daddy, why are you cleaning?” Albus asked, dragging a blanket along behind him as he attempted to keep up with Harry, racing down the corridor.
“First a potato, now a ripe banana. Why do you have all this food?” Waving the object towards Harry.

Songs used:
“Care to enlighten me?” Draco questioned.
“You could at least congratulate me on the win,” Harry sighed, lifting an eyebrow while crossing his arms.
Malfoy meanwhile wasn’t convinced, just raising an eyebrow and slightly tilting his head to the side while continuing to stare at Harry.
“Ohh...” Harry said as the realisation hit him. Sitting down next to Draco, he couldn’t help but tease, “Aww the wittle baby snake has the chills.”
Scorpius stared at the pair for a while, before he turned to Albus, “Should we do that?”
“That’s good,” His mother released the breath she was subconsciously holding.
“Duly noted,” Draco nodded, as he started to rub his arm.  “I just meant, what would you know, Potter, about being defenceless?”
“Stop moving you are causing a draft.”
“Well obviously she likes me, I'm me. Who doesn't like me?”
Pansy sat up straight pursing her lips, “I am not.”
Liking someone is never easy, especially when you are Draco or Harry
“You can, or you could do something better. How about writing out your wish list for Santa?” Malfoy asked, earning squeaks from the boys as they pulled themselves up onto the seats.
“Draco I wasn’t expecting you today.”
“They all have decorations in the doorways, but it wouldn’t be a Weasley prank if they all did the same thing,” Harry said, only just realising how unsafe the house was, especially if the pranks had already arrived this far from Christmas.
Harry’s breath got caught in his throat, watching as Malfoy rolled up his right sleeve. Instantly the thought of the Dark Mark appeared in his head. Along with memories of the school of the battle flashed through his mind. It wasn’t until he felt someone shaking him he snapped back to the living room. Malfoy was standing directly in front of him, one arm shaking his shoulder.
Both parties never mentioned the previous night, pretending to forget about it completely. A fact they secretly felt relieved and disappointed by. While neither would ever admit to it, they both held treasured memories from that morning of cuddling. Harry remembering the content feeling from the warm weight against his side, the sweet whisper of air across his chest. While Draco cherished the feeling of safety created by the comforting heartbeat & warm chest.
“It’s not soft!” Draco could feel his patience going, he felt horrible and Harry’s obliviousness was making him want to cry.
“Right, I’ve got to go! I need to find Luna and stand next to her before she gets hit and has to kiss someone else!” Nevile called as he was jogging backwards. Leaving the pair once more in silence as they watched his retreating back.
That night after the Malfoys had gone home, Harry pulled out his phone and hit call without having to glance at the screen. Having collapsed on the bed, he was tired.
“How did you know that?”
"Hissss- Nooo I ssssset up the perfect plan, it took me agessssss." The reptile replied from her current hiding place, once Harry reached Draco’s bed.
“Seeing as I grew up in a cupboard under some stairs, I'd say a lot.” Harry almost chuckled.
Harry pushed the doorbell. Suddenly the ‘The Burrow’ sign looked daunting.
Harry snorted “Who kno-“ The words cut off as he looked at Draco for the first time and realised how close they were. He swallowed.
Chapter Summary:
Harry instantly replied, earning a chuckle from Draco as he lent back against the wall.
Teddy looked thoughtful for a while, “My daddy fucks mafoot.” He said before disappearing into the dining room.
“Well of course not” Luna said simply “If any one was just good or bad, they wouldn’t be real. Purely good or bad people only exist in moralistic stories”
Ron didn’t really understand what they were debating, as it mostly appeared to include them loudly agreeing with each other in argumentative tones of voices, but most of the boys begin to spend defence lessons suspiciously mute.
They all agreed and walked down the long, cobbled street until they reached the bank. Before they could enter, however, a shrill voice rang out.
Ron was taken aback by this non-sequitur, “What- when?!”
“Come on.” Harry said, as if they hadn’t been the ones waiting for ten minutes for him to emerge from the dorms, “We should get a good seat. This one’s fun.”
Harry looked at him head on. “Neville. You go back to the first door, it’s covered in snakes you can’t miss it. Go back there and wait for me. I’ll meet you.”
Then the cauldron cracked in half. Harry’s chanting voice rose over the sudden roar of flame that spilled out. Purple flame danced with blue, letting out feeler tentacles of orange and red. Sometimes it would shift dramatically, and in the centre Neville glimpsed the flames of green that the Fyre was so famous for.
“Seriously. What was that?” Hermione hissed to Ron on the front steps. Harry had walked over to the small green in the centre of the crescent and had sat down on the ground heavily. They followed after him.
Harry snorted. “I need to do something and be able to
“Just grab it” She heard a muffled voice hiss. Ginny frowned. That was a girl’s voice.
This meant that when Ron wanted to go off and pointedly sulk somewhere away from Harry and Hermione, he didn’t have many options. There was Neville, except that Neville avoided conflict just as much as Draco. Not out of Draco’s general annoyance at emotions but because he was desperate to be seen as utterly neutral and didn’t want to fathom the notion of taking a side. This meant that he equally avoided all of them outside of meals and class. Ron suspected he was spending a lot of time talking anxiously to his plants in the greenhouse.
“Well” Harry said happily “I guess we’re watching Empire Strikes Back next week then”
, Neville could still feel his anger simmering low in his stomach.
“Never mind,” Harry sighed, “Lets just transfigure the beds.”
“Hey! Professor McGonagall!” Harry had yelled from one end of the Transfiguration classroom. McGonagall had exasperatedly turned around and watched as Harry gleefully clasped the hand of a calmly passing by Professor Quirrell. Professor Quirrell Screamed in agony and fell to his knees clutching his hand. Suffice to say the hallway was cleared very quickly and both Harry and Quirrell were dragged to Dumbledore’s office.
Ginny blushed as red as her hair but smiled back at Luna, reassured. “Well I thought we could go first, yeah?”
“And that bloody place. Bad enough you dragged me and Ginny into that.”
Ginny flushed as everyone in the common room looked at her oddly at that. She covered her eyes and groaned. But just because her brother was wilfully blind, didn’t mean she was.
Ron flushed a red that matched his hair “No” He said, voice croaky “I’m not
“Do you have feelings for me?” Harry asked, sounding fragile. Neville finally looked at him. He was staring at Neville with fear. Neville wondered what he was so afraid of.
She couldn’t explain such a selfish idea, but it still plagued her. The anxiety of the unprovable notion sometimes kept her up at night.
It had been unseasonably sunny on that day- the complete opposite to how it was now. Exactly four years later. The sky had been periwinkle blue. No clouds at all. Not in the sky.
Harry nodded sheepishly, “Mainly I think about Voldemort. And dying.”
“Are you alright?” He asked her softly, now. She smiled blearily at him.
ha ha ha i'm sorry i take so long. i guess the plus side of covid-19 is that i'm being sent back form uni so i have like six months of boredom. sad times at ridgemont high.
“I am worried,” She said quietly. Neville was suddenly reminded that their fearless DADA teacher was hardly four years older than them. That she’d only been a student the year before.
“I sort of forgot to stop knitting.” Hermione said with a shrug, “I’ll get better.”
“Has your father really let you wander about alone?” Molly asked, exasperatedly “Doesn’t he read the Prophet? Well no, I suppose he doesn’t. You should tell Xenophilius that there’s a mass murderer on the loose, hm?”
Sirius Black wasn’t as scary as he had been made out to be. He was half a head shorter than Professor Lupin, but much broader across the shoulders and chest. His curly black hair was cut neatly to his shoulders, and well kept. He was clean shaven and fresh faced- a million miles from the scraggly and vicious man he had been presented as. His eyes sparkled with joy and his genuine smile carried unbridled mirth in its corners.
They walked across the small copse towards the house. Hermione pushed the door gently with the toe of her bovver boot. It crashed loudly to the floor, completely rotted away from the hinges.
Harry’s eyes went wide “Right. Yeah. That’s true I suppose”
Hermione and Ron had been known to jump apart when someone walked into the room, but that was for an entirely different reason. Merlin, young love could be nauseating when you’ve walked in on it by accident.
“Who lives here?” Hermione asked Harry softly.
She just shrugged “wait” She said “Give me the reason why you’re both acting like this isn’t a weird thing to do. You don’t have to give details, just broadly”
Harry snorted “Yeah. Well I’m trying to be the best net I can be, Luna”
“The Ravenclaw current theory is that they had to find a new professor last minute.” Draco told him idly, craning his neck surreptitiously to watch the door but also to not seem too eager. “It’s the only logical explanation.”
Neville was jarringly aware in that moment, with a tearful Fleur and a restless Harry, with the sun filtering anachronistically through the widow, casting dancing shadows on the delicate French rug- this was a war. They were in a war. His grandmother was dead. The minister was dead, surely. Tonks could die and so could any member of the Order. Sirius or Remus or Ron’s mum.
The rest of the conversation continued on into small talk and gossiping about mutual friends, but Ginny was hardly listening to any of it.
Unbeknownst to both Harry and Hermione- who it must be stated,
Which was- just
“The things she knows,” Ron cried.
“You found Peter” Sirius said, staring down at the boy in wonderment. Hermione’s mother was still watching the scene with slight confusion.
When Harry did finally stop chanting, it felt as if they shared the same held breath. They watched the flames. They weren’t tame, but they w
to more stirring expletives.
The door to the bathroom was just making its slow swing almost all the way closed when Ginny slammed her hand against it and pushed it back open wide. For a second, she thought that the bathroom was deserted, or that Harry was in one of the cubicles, but then she saw the gaping entry way that where the sink usually stood.
Luna didn’t know how Harry knew the date, but she appreciated it. It was never nice to be alone in ones wn grief. It was even worse to have to speak grief out loud into the world. Re’live it with every explanation.
And, well, Neville was
“I thought I would be alone while down here,” He said, curling his lips. Before the bored looking goblin could respond he cut in, “I pay you enough, don’t I? How can I expect my family heirlooms to be safe if just anybody can run around these floors while I’m here? I pay for this vault for the added privacy and security it provides me. Am I wasting that money?”
“Two others.” Ron said under his breath. “I think, I mean I’m not sure, but one was a Diggory. I think Cedric’s mum. And another wizard I didn’t know.”
“Begrudgingly” Draco said drily. “If I walked in on them snogging one more time—”
“No one would ever think you’re a bad witch” Harry says softly, eyes kind. Ginny just shrugs. Harry would never be able to get it.
“Ron!” Ginny yelled in disgust, lobbing an un-buttered triangle of toast at Ron’s forehead. It hit it’s mark squarely.
There were no lessons on the last day of term, but the train still wasn’t scheduled to leave until 11 am. Hermione decided it was the perfect time to do what she’d been planning all year.
The boy never makes it very far. Sometimes he flickers out in a mist of light the colour of his mother's eyes. Sometimes he bleeds as crassly as mere muggles. Bumps and bruises and breaks. A human death. Some times he gets far enough to fight diseases they can't cure. These are the worlds where he is raised my Lily and James. They are sweet to him. He always dies anyway.
They did, filing in one after the other like ducklings. Their quartet took two of the tables at the front, Seamus and Dean behind them. The rest of the class filtered into their seats. Their house’s year was small, due in part to the fact that they were the year born directly into the height of Voldemort’s last reign. Under twenty of them filled the room.
Ron shuddered.
“Would they monitor the post?” Neville said quietly.
Sirius barked out a laugh. “See? Fate, that is.”
Once he walks into a forest trembling with his own desperate desire to live and when the green light hits him he does not come back. He is punished for being too human to save the world.
Harry shrugged. “Yeah. I’ve been calling it Beverly. It says it’s a girl anyway, so”
“What?” She huffed quietly, because Hermione Granger thought that this museum deserved the same reverence as her sacred library.
Joni Mitchell sang, and Luna sank into the familiar album.
Luna smiled at him in thanks and Hermione looked slightly watery-eyed.
Hermione often went on about what she called The System. Luna was usually inclined to agree with her opinions, but wished Hermione’s opinions didn’t so regularly come as a side-dish to her marmalade toast.
Ginny blushed. Wasn’t that just the million-galleon question? At first it had been because it was easy to transfigure her crush on Harry into an obsession. Then it had continued simply because she was stubborn, or because it was sort of fun to go on stake outs with Colin and Luna. But why had she kept it up so long?
Ron Weasley, who had dirt on his nose and a fat brown rat on his lap, seemed equally as baffled by Harry as Hermione was. Despite the boy’s insistence that Hermione had people she needed to meet, and the suspicious way he’d headed straight for this compartment, the two boys didn’t actually seem to know each other.
“You barely go to classes” Ron added blithely. He dumped their bag of things on the floor. The room had created the perfect room for their sleepover- the floor covered in roll matts and pillows and fluffy blankets.
“Fuck,” Harry cried now, kicking a wall. Neville and Harry had been alone at breakfast that morning, when the first papers arrived. Harry had stormed off angrily, past sobbing students and terrified Professors, his face a mask of storm clouds.
“Luna was able to come home with us, Pads” Professor Lupin said, nodding over at Luna and Hermione.
Harry looked honestly upset with himself. “Look, I know. I’m being a really bad friend. It’s just—I haven’t got anyone else.”
“Well, I suppose there’s no quidditch,” Ron shrugged.
before she closed the portrait hole with a soft click and backed away. She had a lot to think about.
Hermione rolled her eyes and Ron frowned, “You just don’t want him to know you weren’t friends in the past.”
“What is it then?” Ron said, some of the lightness vanished. “Because I’ve had a million theories.” He blushed. “I even. I mean. I thought maybe you two were…” He gestured between them, not finishing his sentence.
“Ginny we can’t stop, we have to—” Harry protests but she cuts him off.
It had turned out that there was a room on the seventh floor that was perfect for a meeting like this. It was suspiciously perfect, actually. There were study tables clustered in one corner, cushions and dummies for spell practice, and big blackboard that took over one wall. Harry and Hermione stood in front of this blackboard at first, with everyone else sat on the floor.
And the thing about having small but loud parts of you that were bitter was that they grew. They got bigger and louder until eventually all you were was a bitter screaming thing begging the world to
Ginny would have pressed more, but the slithering started up again. It was almost deafening this close, and the snake hissed something. Ginny gathered it was a grateful goodbye.
“Only fair.” George smirked, raising his wand.
It was his eyes, though, that Ginny couldn’t look away from. Bright emerald green. The colour of the brilliant green toads she’d catch at the stream with Luna. Green like Christmas and the glass bottle pepper-up potion would come in and the wool her mum always used for her dads Christmas jumper. Harry Potter green was the best green in the world. It made Ginny think of new worlds and open spaces.
The problem she had was that she couldn’t just simply stop being friends with Harry or start disliking him for what he might cause. Harry was her best friend. Someone who seemed to fully accept her, warts and all, for the first time in her life. They’d only known each other for three months but she already knew that losing Harry Potter as a friend would make her life just a little bit worse all round.
In the end any tears I shed are just for him. My boy. Harry James Potter.
Harry and Hermione exchanged another loaded look. Ron saw a decision pass between them, their faces both resolving, then Hermione lent forward and began packing her books from the coffee table.
“How do you know what it says?” Dumbledore frowned.
“In case you’ve forgotten, Harry” Luna said, trying her best to keep the condescension to a minimum “I’m only a second year”
She mulled over her entire ‘investigation’, lacklustre and often dead-end as it had often been. Why had she been so unable to let it go? Why had she let her whole first year at Hogwarts become so wrapped up in one occurrence?
Harry nodded. “You were Krum’s, Ron was mine.”
“I’m in the room of requirement” Harry said slowly “But--”
Sirius spun around to smile at them warmly “Ah, I bet Minnie loved that”
you tied that tie.” Remus said drily, smiling at Harry with love in his eyes.
“The Thief’s Downfall. It’s a protection for the lower vaults. Strips all charms and enchantments from you. Potion’s as well.”
“You don’t like the resistance to a man who wants you dead?” Ginny said, eyebrows raised.
Two hours later, Hermione had been shaken out of her educational stupor by a tugging n her sleeve. She looked over at Harry in confusion. She hadn’t even finished what she was reading about fossils.
“There’s something.” Ron insisted. Both of them stayed conspicuously silent, avoiding even looking at him. He huffed. “I suppose this is another bloody thing you won’t tell me then?”
Harry nodded, “Just a few hours before I did, actually. I suppose I never had time to process it before I was back here.” Then Harry seemed to shake himself, clearing the cobwebs off himself, “You’ll never guess who the mum was.”
Her cake was in the shape of a butterfly. Her and Luna both had a vanilla antenna each.
“Yes.” Fleur said, flicking her sheet of silver hair over her shoulder, “I believe firmly in breaking records other people have set.”
If girls were the way her brothers had taught her they were, then Ginny internalised that girls must be bad. This lesson, even more than not being able to keep up or needing to fight for food, was the one she would spend the rest of her life trying to unlearn.
“Love you.” Harry said, giving short embraces to each of his guardians before heading towards the train. Neville noticed he held Sirius particularly tight. Looking at him oddly as he pulled away. “See you at Christmas.” He muttered.
Hermione giggled. All of the Weasley children did some variation of a groaning embarrassed blush. Molly went pink about the ears. “This is my Husband Arthur” She said, in the voice of all embarrassed spouses everywhere.
Neville was desperate. He didn’t know what to do. He didn’t know how to stop Harry. “You could hurt people. There’s an entire castle of people upstairs.”
It was the walls that talked in the Bronze tower. From day to day the walls would be covered in flyers, posters, photos. Tacked up pictures of admired people, magical or not, quotes and famous paintings and diagrams. Study tips and anarchist slogans and posters depicting wand movements. All of it crammed between overflowing bookshelves, on any piece of spare wall. At the end of every year everyone would take down what they’d pinned up and for a few scant hours the common room would be as austere and pristine as it had surely been in Rowena’s time. By a few hours into the first day back it would be littered again with the debris of every Ravenclaw’s intellectual pursuits. It was like living in a mind- with all of the thoughts splayed out.
Hermione laughed exasperatedly and grabbed a chair, pulling it over so that it was positioned in front of the door. She plopped herself down on it and gestured for Harry to do likewise. He just stared at her warily. “Don’t worry Harry. I’m not a death eater or a vampire or whatever else it was you were convinced Professor Vance was. But no, sorry. There isn’t actually a boggart in here”
Hermione, never one to brag, would nevertheless like it noted that she achieved a shiny silver pin on only her second attempt.
“Dark wizard attacks.” She scolded. It wasn’t scolding directed at any of them, but instead just a general scold of the universe. Mum was the type of formidable women that could make even the universe cower in the face of one of her scolding’s “At a quidditch match. What on merlin’s green earth?” She was currently moving Ginny’s face from side to side, as if checking she still had all features intact “Arthur.” She demanded shrilly, “what has the ministry got to say?”
Hermione looked at Harry, looking pleasantly surprised “Yeah that makes sense” She said thoughtfully, then blushed and looked at Ginny “I mean. That was what we were doing”
“Hermione,” Harry said with obvious surprise. He must not have seen her in the common room. He looked down at the rattling box in his hands, back up at her, and then back down. “This…uh…this isn’t what it looks like?”
“To be fair, we’ve done it before.” Harry hedged.
She read the quote again, lips moving as she smiled lightly
“This," He said, shaking the box lightly, “Is a tremendously dangerous agent of Lord Voldemort, who’s currently masquerading as Ron’s pet rat. I’ve been keeping him stunned while I figured out the best course of action, and now I’m going to take him to Dumbledore.”
—It’s a massive fuck-off chamber under the castle built by Salazar Slytherin. It’s in Hogwarts: A History?”
Neville laughed genuinely, “No, you don’t. But you do probably need to ask yourself who it is you do like. I’m sensing its not something you’ve thought very deeply about.”
“It was nothing.” Ron said with a blush. “I’m no good at drawing.”
“You and Hermione are going to be the death of me, as per usual” He muttered under his breathe. He pulled something out of his pocket, then pointed his wand at it and murmured a spell. Suddenly two fat dead chickens grew in Harry’s hand. “I keep them small in my pocket, so I don’t get weird questions” He said awkwardly.
“Where are you heading?” Harry said, simply.
“The only person more dramatic than you is Harry” Luna said serenely, causing Draco to break out into laughter and Harry to gape indignantly before breaking out into a monologue about how un-dramatic he was.
“I don’t know,” He would say, mouth tight at the corners. “I don’t know anything.”
Ginny and Luna exchanged a look, obviously having missed something here, and then broke off into their own conversation when the odd quartet began an impassioned debate about—
“Aw, what.” Ron said, deflated. “That’s not real?”
Ron rolled his eyes and shared an exasperated look with Hermione before remembering that he was mad at her.
“Yeah, yeah.” He leaned over to grab more food from Harry’s side of the table, mumbling as he did so. “I guess I missed you too, weirdo.”
“You want to help us rob Gringotts?” Harry said with confusion.
“We shall meet again my love.” Harry cried with mocking sincerity.
Joy welled up in Luna’s chest. The displaced cat resettled itself on her knee and she clutched at it gently.
Hermione and Harry were sitting at one of the long tables, the one that would correspond to Ravenclaw in the Great hall, and Harry had his head on the table. Hermione was patting him on the head, though from where Ginny stood it didn’t actually look that comforting.
Ginny concluded, reluctantly, that there probably wasn’t anything malicious about Harry wanting to do well in his classes.
“Wotcher.” Tonks said, bubble gum hair vibrant in the otherwise drab classroom, “Sorry for being late. Wasn’t really planning on being here.”
Remus,
“We snuck into the kitchen.” Ron said simply, pulling his book out of his back and beginning to open it.
“Si.” Remus, dear had said in the same exasperated voice her mum had just for her dad “Well, yes I suppose it has all been a big mess. Thank you for having tea with us”
“Of course,” Ron rolled his eyes, blushing, “and shut up. Look at you and Draco on a little double date.”
It turned out that Grimmauld place was now the headquarters for the reformed ‘Order of The Phoenix’. A resistance group founded by Dumbledore in the last war.
Luna looked at Harry. He was white as a sheet.
It was in this week that two letters arrived at the Weasley’s kitchen window. One addressed, as expected, to Hermione. The other landed in Harry’s lap. While Hermione eagerly tore her letter open and let a small shining prefect badge drop into her hand, Harry stared at his in what one would almost call horror.
He frowned, walking into the room a few steps. There was only one window, a long narrow one at the very top of the far wall. Hardly any light streamed in. He casted a lumos. Then he trailed the light of his wand slowly about the room.
Suddenly, it didn’t seem all that bad to have a future full of no friends but her parents. Hermione Granger had magic. Hermione Granger would always be magical.
“Wanna make an actual bet on this one?” Harry muttered, “I have literally no idea how it’s gunna go.”
“He’s a bit of a brat now.” Ron pointed out reasonably.
Harry snorted, “She bombarded me with questions.”
Harry guided them to a particular grave. It was large and imposing, obviously built for a wealthy person. The name upon it read “Thomas Riddle Sr”. The date of death was given of 1943.
Harry nodded, looking at the floor. “I suppose we all look at other people and think we have it better. I guess we all just—know the pain we have.”
Fleur nodded weakly, biting the nail on her thumb. She looked far more dishevelled than he’d ever seen her. Her silvery hair was covered by a wrapped headscarf, as if she had been in the middle of getting ready before being interrupted. She slouched on the sofa in her office now, looking as if she had imploded in on herself.
“Harry! Where are you? Are you okay?” It sounded like Professor Lupin, but she couldn’t be sure. Ginny gave her a worried look.
“We’re saving everyone else. I don’t matter.”
Harry said the word ‘professor’ like a curse. Neville frowned. He realised he’d never thought of Dumbledore and Harry in the same sentence. They never interacted. Why did Harry seem so reticent to talk?
“Nothing’s worse than seeing your folks snogging” Ron said sagely, and Ginny shuddered in agreement.
Neville had stepped backwards unconsciously; he could only barely feel the heat of the flames where he stood. But Harry was only a metre or so away, his face bathed in dancing light.
Harry didn’t say anything, just jerked his head at where Ron was sitting fascinated by a pamphlet about Dinosaurs on the other side of the room. He tugged her hand until she deigned to follow him over.
Then a mast broke the surface of the black lake and a magnificently terrifying boat began to emerge. Over in the Ravenclaw section Draco let out a happy whoop of awe.
“What are you doing?” She demanded, hands on hips. If she was acting just a little bit too much like her mother- well. The apple didn’t fall too far from the very intimidating tree.
In one version, Harry Potter lives to tell the tale. He marries the girl, he has the children. He lives to a pleasant old age and he dies in his bed. He is content.
Neville studied his face with a discerning frown. Harry wasn’t moving yet, as if he was suddenly unable to move without Neville’s permission. Neville noticed his hands were trembling at his side. Neville took one of his wrists on instinct, stilling his hand. Harry looked down at their hands in surprise.
“I don’t trust Dumbledore.” Harry shrugged.
The blush took dominion over Draco’s entire face. It was quite possibly moving from an embarrassed blush to a full-fledged Draco Malfoy patented frustrated flush. After three weeks of friendship Luna had begun to learn these nuances. Harry had quirks like these too- like how he always stumbled over simple sentences or when he said incongruous things before looking panicked and leaving the room in mid-conversation. Luna put Harry’s oddities down to the general anomaly of his entire presence.
_______________________
“Wait. You mean that cauldron” Hermione said, sounding exasperated “That one, right there, sticking out from under Ginny’s bed
“It’s.” Harry made a face. “It would be a lot easier if that were the case.”
Ron exchanged knowing looks with Hermione, then shrugged, “You know, friends. You don’t
Harry shrugged uneasily, “I don’t know how to tell him. Any of it.”
“Why is there a number 13 but not a number 12?” Hermione wondered in confusion. She’d seen streets that missed out on numbering a house 13, but not 12. What was wrong with the number 12?
Harry grabbed his hand for the third time that day and pulled. Neville staggered backwards. A small fireball flew past his head.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, but then realised she really didn’t have the energy right now to care about his plots. She rolled her eyes and went to wash her hands next to a fidgety Harry.
When the distributors finally made it to them, sat as they were at the end of the Gryffindor table against the wall, they had seen many people throwing their heads back in laughter or glued to the pages with rapt interest.
“A little sympathy please Lovegood” Draco huffed, colour high on his cheeks.
“No” She said, still watching him closely in case the sudden vision would reappear. She suspected it was just the usual influx of Christmas nargles “But I think some fifth years had the same idea last year”
“Oh my god.” Said Hermione, who even after two months of living in a magical castle was still amazed by it daily.
simply read
They turned about abruptly, but the other end of the hallway was now spilling a bottleneck of frenzied students.
“It’s fine,” Harry said, “Hope you feel better Nev. “
The rest of them exchanged glances, mouths pursed in confused frowns.
Harry groaned loudly, putting his head in his hands “I think Remus allows it because the cats seem to like them. Sirius just thinks it’ll annoy Kreacher”
Neville gaped after him, then shared a shocked look with Fleur.
“It’s already spelled to only open for its owner” Harry pointed out.
terrifying, so they didn’t often have time to discuss their third project. Harry Potter’s crazy life.
” and Ron snaps back, “Not in centuries Hermione.” and then Hermione looks at Harry with intense worry and Ron doesn’t know where all the tension is coming from but the fact that he doesn’t know causes resentment to bubble in his chest.
She’d been kind and thorough when explaining concepts and homework to him in her office hours. More often than not Fleur Delacour, the intimidating French champion, had been crowded in the corner of Tonks office, piled away behind stacks of books and rolls of parchments. “Research student.” Tonks had explained to him, as if that should reason away everything.
It takes another ten minutes for the group of Aurors and the criminal to finally take off, but finally they were disappearing across the grounds and towards the gates. Luna walks over to Harry who’s still staring after them pensively.
“I hope that dreadful uncle of yours isn’t staying this year” Harry said protectively. Neville, if possible, went even redder. Harry was the only one who could achieve that shade on him.
Sirius was right about the people. The dining room table, usually so long you could reenact scenes from Beauty and the Beast on it, was now positively overcrowded. Molly Weasley sat in the middle, furiously shelling peas.
“It wasn’t Pansy,” Harry said with an eyeroll and a sure voice. Neville looked at him sideways with disbelief. He wasn’t entirely sure that it wasn’t the intimidating Slytherin girl, who constantly scowled or smirked at everything in her path.
Hermione grunted as Harry shifted her feet up and then back down onto his lap. Ron did the same with her head. Hermione put up with this position for exactly one second before swivelling up and sitting between them.
Their new DADA teacher was Professor Vance. Harry treated her with suspicion at first as was par for the course.
“You okay, kid?” Sirius asked softly. He had been surprisingly gentle towards Neville since June, something that didn’t fit with the wrongly accused mass-murderer and wild godfather of Harry he’d always envisioned him as. Neville had had very little to do with Sirius Black at all. He knew Remus much better from Hogwarts. But it was Sirius who took him to Mungo’s to see his parents, even more regularly than his Gran had. And he talked to ‘Frank’ and ‘Alice’ as he referred to them as if they were still there, which Neville was always appreciative of. He never made a comment when Neville sometimes cried or had to cut visits short out of too many overwhelming feelings.
Harry just rolled his eyes and grinned brightly at Ron. “I missed you when you were sulking.”
“Fleur,” He called, running down the corridor. At the end of the hallway Fleur was opening the door to her office. She turned at the sound of her own name, eyes widening when she saw Harry striding towards her.
Ron looked at him incredulously. It was a few hours before sunset, but the light was already dimming, blanketing the campsite with a dim mellow light. A haze of campfire smoke hung languidly over them. Harry was sprawled on a roll mat he’d dragged next to the fire. They’d been chatting nonsense since early afternoon, Ron’s brothers and a amused Hermione interjecting periodically.
