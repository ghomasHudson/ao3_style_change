“I had detention with Umbridge.  Bet you’re pleased that she took delight in making me carve this into my hand.”
“You’re stronger than you know.  And wondering about it doesn’t matter.  You have me.  That’s what’s important.”
“I’m glad you understand.”
isn’t in your house right now, but your father will be.  He’ll still be the one to raise you.  And we can’t exactly kidnap you.”  The thought of trying to break into the Manor and kidnap baby Draco wasn’t one that Harry thought they could carry out.  Lucius Malfoy was hardly going to let his heir go without a fight.  If they took Draco there would no doubt be a man hunt for them, and they couldn’t risk that.  But Draco had come up with a plan to rescue Harry and from the limited information Draco had told him, little Draco needed rescuing too.
Draco stopped walking.   Harry noticed and stopped too, turning around so they were facing each other.
“Come and have a walk round the grounds with me.  I’ve got a few gardens dotted around that are at their best at this time of year”
“You’re my friend too, Harry.  It’s all I’ve ever wanted.  Since before I even met you, I wanted to be your friend, but I messed it all up on the train.  I was an arrogant prat.”
“Is that how Harry describes me?”
“I can live with that.”
“Do you think I’ll ever meet him?” Rosie asked.  Even if Rose had technically met him once, it wasn’t really Harry Potter she had met.  If the letter was to be believed, then there wasn’t a chance of her children ever knowing the person who had once been her best friend.  Before Hermione was able to speak her husband managed to get the words out.
Harry took that to mean yes.  Draco followed Harry through the house to the kitchen holding his hand.  Harry grabbed three wine glasses down from the cupboard, and was surprised to feel two squeezes indicating a no.  He looked at Draco who looked at the third glass and then at Harry pointedly, with a slight scowl.
Andromeda got up, and Harry noticed how tired she looked.  She seemed to have aged in the month since he’d seen her last.  It concerned him, but he didn’t mention it, just handing over the box of sweet treats Draco had made.
“Harry…” She managed to sob out.
“Ah, Mister Malfoy.  Now we’re all here I can tell you about the important task I have for you.  Take a seat why don’t you.”  The irritating toad like woman said in her sickly sugar like voice.
“Oh Harry, you look terrible”
“Just five more minutes.”  Draco moaned and tried to bury his head under the pillow.  Harry knew it would do no good.  The excited four-year old on Christmas morning was an unstoppable force.  He started to sit up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.  Teddy was certainly excited if his hair was anything to go by.  It was almost dizzying to watch as it switched between various bright colours.  His eyes were settled on heterochromic green and grey.  When his eyes were like that Harry could almost imagine he was really their child.
“You don’t need me to babysit you, Love.”
When he was done for the day, he texted Draco again.
Both of them threw on clothes.  Harry quickly ran through the rooms.  There was no sign of Draco in any of them, so he went outside to join Blaise in his search of the outside, throwing his coat over the joggers and jumper he was wearing.  He prayed that Draco was there.  Draco had never left the property when like this before, but it was always a risk.  The last thing they needed was the Ministry finding a manic Draco wandering the streets when he inevitably broke the statute of secrecy.  Draco’s concept of reality and risk went out the window when he was like this.
“That’s kids for you.  No end of trouble.  You ready to start classes?”
Harry watched as Malfoy took out his wand and with a spell Harry didn’t know began to strip the dark varnish off the wood, leaving the pale floorboards underneath showing.  There was anger in his wand movements.  They were rapid and disjointed, but they remained effective.  Maybe a little anger was a good thing.  Already the entrance looked brighter, especially with the sunlight streaming in through the still open door.
“But that was my fault.  Wasn’t it?”
“What’s Bambi?” Malfoy looked slightly puzzled.
“I’m still not sure I believe you when you say Dumbledore is just going to leave Harry on a doorstep in the middle of the night in November.”
“Colouring!!!”  Teddy replied excitedly, successfully distracted.  Harry quickly set Teddy up with his colouring things at the coffee table.
“Draco, Love.  I’m here.  I’m back. I’m with you and we’re all safe.”  Harry whispered, rubbing his cheek against Draco’s and holding him tight.
Harry brightened slightly.  Clearly the thought of reacquainting with old friends and family wasn’t completely out of the question, but then his expression changed to one of resignation.  “I don’t know.  I’d want Draco with me, and I don’t think he nor the Weasleys are going to be ready that any time soon.  I doubt any of our old friends would be prepared to see him…” Harry paused before he spoke again.  “Maybe the two of us can arrange to meet again somewhere like this though and you can bring both your children.  I’ll even drag Teddy along so you can meet him properly.  I’d like to bring Draco too but I’m happy to wait until you’re ready for that.”
“Lily….” He said when she finally relaxed again. “Lily, I don’t think this is just back ache.”
“I don’t see what the point in any of this is.” Draco sounded defeated.  Harry could see and feel the blackness descending over Draco.
“Then you made a good decision.  I can’t fix this for you, but I can certainly help more than alcohol can.  All you can do for now is apologise and hope they forgive you.  I can help talk this through with you.  Help you forgive yourself.  But it’s up to them to forgive you.  I’m sure they will.  They are your family.  They love you.”
“Nursery.  I actually wanted to talk to you about something without him here.”
‘Draco, check your father’s okay.  I’m going to grab our stuff.’
Back at the flat they got the two boys changed and into their cot for a nap.  They were still refusing to sleep separated.  Draco set up the monitoring charm his mother had shown him, and they headed to the living room, collapsing on the sofa.
“Well I am a little bit nervous if I’m honest.” Harry said.
“Okay Remus.”
“As if Draco would have let me.  Although, if I threatened to throw the good wine over you if he didn’t let me, I’m sure the horrible green stuff could have been used as something to compromise down to.”
“Okay.  Our time is nearly up anyway.”
Blaise entered the bathroom and was surprised to see an enormous bath sunken into the floor in the middle of the room with the two ex-rivals leant against each other in the water.
“Finished your crossword already?”
Harry kisses Draco again.  This time less sleepily.  He presses his body into Draco’s, already feeling himself harden.
Within minutes the three of them were surrounded by wrapping paper and the assortment of toys, books, and new clothes that Teddy had received.  The last present was a small broom, that Draco had spent ages picking out for Teddy.  When he opened it Teddy looked at it in wonder for a few seconds before wrapping his arms around Draco in a tight hug, as his hair changed to match Draco’s.
Draco stepped into the bright and airy room, untouched by darkness.  There were neatly stacked piles of paperwork awaiting his attention on his desk, but when he sat down to try, he couldn’t keep hold of his thoughts long enough to attempt any of it.  Work was normally an effective distraction for calming him down, but his mind wasn’t letting him.  He rummaged through the top draw and pulled out his emergency pack of cigarettes and his lighter.   Lighting one and taking a deep drag, Draco closed his eyes.  He was better than this.  He was not going to let Potter do this to him.  It had been years since he had felt so close to the edge of a panic attack.  He hated feeling like this, he needed his control back.  He finished the cigarette, stubbing it out in the crystal ashtray sat on the desk.  He picked the lighter back up and lit it.  He stared at the flames for several minutes, watching as the metal heated up, before snapping it shut and extinguishing it, placing it back on the table in front of him.  Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath Draco made a decision.  He pushed up his sleeves and looked down at his arms and started counting the scars, touching each one as he went.  The scars were all old and faded.  He found touching them comforting somehow.  It was a trick he’d picked up years ago.  Sometimes concentrating on each mark and thinking about them was enough to bring some of the relief making them in the first place had brought, in a less destructive way.  He picked up a quill and dipped in the nearby pot of ink and started outlining each of the scars.  Bit by bit, the near panic he had felt since leaving Fortescue’s eased and Draco could think normally again.  It had been several years since he had had a panic attack or felt those urges as strongly as they had just been.  He was a grown man, not the anxiety ridden and traumatised youth he had been.  He could deal with Potter and his family without being sent into a spiral.
“The healers are pretty convinced I am.  I have to go for my second round of treatment next week.  We’ll be able to continue these outings in a week or so.  I’ll be stuck in the hospital till then.”
.  I’ve just found out my wife is pregnant with another man’s child!” Harry was all but shouting now.
“Draco…”
“So are you one of the reasons they left the country?”
“Fuck…”  Harry said loudly at the interruption.  “She couldn’t have waited till I’d at least finished too.”
“Really…?”  Harry said, cautiously optimistic.  He didn’t know enough about protective wards, or really wards of any kind, but trusted that Draco did.  At least the other boy seemed confident enough.
“Does he know?”
“I know you wouldn’t.”  Harry sighed, resigned to his fate.  “Look there are other reasons too.  I…”  He paused, knowing he had to continue but not wanting to.
“Okay.”  Harry sniffed.
Harry looked at Draco and saw the fierce determination in his eyes.  He sighed.  He knew Draco wasn’t going to cave on this however much Harry wanted to wrap his partner up with kid gloves.
“A glass of water sounds good.  Or a cup of tea if you could manage it.”
____________________
When he’s done Malfoy sits down next to Harry and leans up against the wall too.  Harry reaches over to take his hand and intertwine their fingers, then leans over and kisses Malfoy lightly on the lips.
“I can wait with him outside if you want to, but I didn’t want to stay away for the whole time I’m looking after him without telling you why I hadn’t come straight back.”
“I’ve written to Moony.”  Sirius announced at breakfast the next morning.  “If I’m going to the Ministry today, I needed him to know everything first.  Just in case.”
Drawing on the foolish Gryffindor courage that had gotten them into this mess, Harry took over from Draco.  “We have three days before the article breaks and we’ve already been round to Grimauld and Andi’s to make sure the wards there are secure.  This is place is a fortress, no one will get to any of us here, and it’s not like anyone knows where we actually live.  I know it’s going to be a circus for a while, but hopefully it won’t be too bad.”
“That’s okay.”  Harry replies.  He had kind of fancied a packet of Wotsits, but he wasn’t going to begrudge Teddy and Draco for eating them.  “I’m surprised you made something edible for you and Teddy.”
The table he and Draco had sat at last time, in the window, was free.  Harry sat down and flicked through the menu of different types of tea before settling on one.  The waitress who came over was the same one from that day too.
“Probably not the ones in Slytherin, but the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff common room ones are completely child friendly.  Although if we’d been caught doing any of it when we were back at school McGonagall would have been screaming at us and we’d have lost at least 100 points each.”  Rather than commenting on Minerva’s possible reaction, she focused on the other interesting thing Harry had mentioned.
“Can we go to Gringotts now?  Can we try and prove that we’re telling the truth?”  Harry asked his godfather.  He thought they’d probably done enough to save the man with the delay their meeting had caused.  Pettigrew was probably gone already.  Hopefully after spotting Harry and freaking out thinking James was still alive and well.  Still Harry didn’t want to let Sirius go.  Not only would it help enormously to have an adult on their side who at least could prove who they were, but Harry wanted Sirius with him.  He wanted to get to know his godfather properly.  To have the chance that future events robbed him of.
“I was doing the same.”
There was a long pause then with none of them speaking before Lily could bring herself to speak.  She felt disbelief at what her Dad was saying. “But you were with mum forever.”
“Oh… I thought he’d be bringing them out himself.  You don’t look much like a healer.”
“Just like you do.”
Harry let Draco choose what to watch and they ended up putting Pride and Prejudice on.  It was one of Draco’s favourites, although Harry suspected that it was the scene with Colin Firth coming out of the lake that was a deciding factor in his enjoyment.  Harry had to admit he quite liked that scene too.
“You heading back abroad then?” The woman asked Harry, and Hermione was surprised this muggle knew that Harry didn’t live in England.
“Exactly.  Draco has the Dark Mark.  He hasn’t told me the exact circumstances, but I know it wasn’t taking willingly.  From what I can imply it was either he take it, or watch me be tortured and killed before being tortured and killed himself.  He’s not even 17 yet.”
“We weren’t in our underwear.” James insisted.
“Can you and Dray open them with me?”  Teddy asked in a small voice, with very wide eyes.
“You know if we’re ever going to get anything done today you are going to have to keep your hands off me for a little while, and possibly get dressed.  Not that I don’t enjoy seeing you in nothing but a towel, but it is a little distracting.”  Draco kissed the nape of Harry’s neck and let go of him.
“We have to protect him.  We have to.  We promised him.”
Malfoy did as he was told, exclaiming in surprise, when the pen Harry gave him, wrote on the card without smudging.  It made Harry’s heart leap seeing how something so simple as a cheap biro could make Malfoy smile.
“So there is a gap where you’re on their doorstep with no one watching you?”
“Stop being an arse, Malfoy.  And actually I do like your company.  You don’t expect the same things everyone else out there does.  You just treat me as Potter.”
“I wouldn’t miss it.  I shall look forward to receiving my invite.  Now, however much I’d prefer to talk about your upcoming nuptials, we should get to the business at hand.  I have a meeting with the infuriating head of creature liaisons in half an hour and I’m not looking forward to it.  But it can’t be avoided so we can’t spend all day catching up.  I’ve read your final report on Mr Malfoy.  Do you really feel he has been rehabilitated enough to be able to come off probation?”
“Lily, I know you’re scared but you shouldn’t lash out at your mother like that.  She loves you and just wants what’s best for you”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was thinking more, showing him some of the delightful curses that we picked up from the Carrow’s in 7
The elf returned quickly and Narcissa poured out two cups of tea and added a dash of milk for both of them.  Andi hadn’t changed the way she took her tea since she was 15 and had stopped adding sugar, but she was surprised that Cissa remembered when she made up a cup exactly to Andi’s taste.
It was the prospect of adding even more appararition to their journey that finally dragged Lucius to his feet.  Draco and Harry had to practically hold the man upright.  Harry actually couldn’t really blame him for his drained state.  Rapid and repeated apparition took a lot of power, and they’d had to add overcoming the Azkaban anti apparition fields into the equation.  That on top of the nearly 3 months the man had had in the prison and feeling like shit was pretty inevitable.  The only reason Draco wasn’t in the same state was because he was sharing power with Harry, and only the last two weeks of his incarceration had been in Azkaban, unlike Lucius, who’d been one of the first to be tried.  Still, they couldn’t stop at let the man rest now though.
“Now… and when you get back, you’re writing an apology to both Harry and Malfoy.”
“Really fucking hurts.”  Draco rasped out.
“I’m perfectly happy in this room.” Malfoy pouted.
“Why? Do you need me to help you back to the library, or are or trying to tempt me to stay a little longer?”
“One of them was a ring with a black stone.  Dumbledore found and destroyed that one.  He didn’t tell me exactly where he found it though.”  Harry banged his head on the table in frustration.  “I’m sure I know where that damn locket is.”
Harry found it fascinating watching as Malfoy closed his eyes and screwed up his face in concentration.  He remembered him doing the same thing in school when he was trying hard to work out how to achieve something particularly difficult.  It was as distracting now as it was back then.  The little creases in Malfoy’s forehead were more captivating than they had any right to be.
“Well anyone can see how much he likes you.”
“So does that mean no sex ever, the kids aren’t exactly going anywhere.  And Potter’s been seeing the same therapist as you.  Only you two could end up with lives so ridiculously entangled, even when you weren’t talking to each other.  First your kids being friends, then dating and unexpected little accidents, and now I find out you’ve both been spilling your secrets to the same person.  There was no way you would ever have been able to stay apart.  Does that mean Doris knew that you’d been with Potter before I did?  I don’t know whether I like that.”
“What do I need to do?”
“So, my Dad said that he wanted us to talk to you.”  It wasn’t a great start but at least it was something.
“It’s really me…”  Draco sniffed.  “Now come on.  Let’s get out of here.”
“We think the reason you can touch us is to do with trust, or maybe with how you were the first one to try and help me with this link.  I trust you above everyone else, which is why I think it didn’t feel wrong for you to touch me.”
“I think he spent two, maybe three, days in holding cells in the Ministry before being cleared of all charges.  He claimed the Imperius.”
Two squeezes in response.
“I know that.  Just sometimes I wonder whether we would have been able to manage.”
“All the more reason why I won’t accept an invitation to your and your partners’ home right now.  I’ve been talking to my sister.  I want to be your mother again.  But I want it to be a conscious choice.  Not one muddled by grief.  Nor by whatever you are currently taking.”
“I think I must have passed out too when you left the grounds.  Fuck. This is really messed up.”
“And you did a great job of showing that.”
“Of course it’s important.  We should absolutely go.” Hermione said.  “I’m glad you’re taking this so seriously.”
“So you will go along with it and punish me.”  Harry said, matter as if it was obvious.
Harry felt freer than he had for years.  Every kiss and touch brought sensations of pleasure he was sure he’d lost.  It was like they were teenagers again.  Curled up under a blanket in an abandoned classroom in Hogwarts with no one to care about but themselves.  But this time he had the knowledge and strength to not let this incinerate them both again.  He just hoped Draco did too and that everything else going wrong around them didn’t present an unsurpassable obstacle.  Harry stopped them before they let themselves get completely overwhelmed with the joy of touching each other.
“I prefer me like this too.  I think I’d forgotten who I was with Lucius.  I can’t believe it took my 16-year-old son to snap me out of it.”
“So pretty bad then.”
“Draco got a letter from the Ministry last week.”
“You don’t know how happy it makes me to hear that.  We’ve probably got a bit of a wait here before any of the others arrive, or the baby makes an appearance.  Why don’t you tell me what happened with your mum before things took a rather dramatic turn?  Did you manage to make up?”
Despite Harry’s resolve to talk to Ginny about letting the kids know as soon as possible, nearly two weeks had passed.  Harry had spent most of those two weeks moping around the house.  Ron and Hermione had popped in, both separately and together a few times, but he knew he wasn’t the greatest company and they hadn’t stayed long.  Tomorrow he had his next appointment with Doris.  He’d spent much of his time alone, chastising himself over all the things he had done wrong during his relationship with Ginny.  He’d worked too many hours, spent too many nights away, and when it had all come to a screeching halt, he had thrown himself into his physio, not allowing her to help him at all.  Harry knew that dwelling on this in this way was not productive, but he was avoiding thinking about what Doris had instructed him to.  That was harder than just throwing all of the what ifs about Ginny around in his head.  That meant thinking about Draco Malfoy.  Those what ifs weren’t allowed.  It meant overcoming the years of conditioning to switch his thoughts the second they drifted to the other man.  If he didn’t try though, Doris would know.  She always knew when he hadn’t even made an effort at one of her set tasks.  Still he decided against jumping straight into the first task she had given him.  Not only did that mean focusing all of his thoughts on Malfoy, but he knew it would bring back memories of their final fight and he didn’t want to see Malfoy’s 18-year-old face in his mind crumpling, as he stormed out of their abandoned classroom.  He also had no clue as to how to achieve task number three.  There wasn’t anything he really felt like doing at all, let alone something that involved being out of the house, or seeing other people.
“Didn’t know you were seeing a mind healer?”
Harry took a deep breath.
“It’s not his fault.” Harry said defensively. “Andi has told me all about Bellatrix and how she was never able to get proper treatment.  It wasn’t the disease that caused her to become a psychotic murderer.  It was the lengths she went to, to manage the symptoms.  There are plenty of other people world with bipolar disorder.  It is manageable without resorting what she did.  It was how she managed the symptoms that resulted in her being the way she was.  He’s nothing like her.”
With that, Ginny, a hurt expression on her face, turned and left the room, the house and, as far as he was concerned at that moment, his life.  Harry went into the kitchen and grabbed down the bottle of whiskey that they’d kept for special occasions and opened it.  Tonight, he needed to make everything disappear.  Getting

“Must you act so juvenile, Scorpius?” Father chastised him.
Lily had giggled at him before lying beside him, her hand stroking his chest.
“I haven’t slept with Ginny since her birthday.  The one before the accident.  Around 18 months ago.”
“Well… it made you worry and it’s Mr Weasley people should be worrying about, not me.”  Harry said, bashfully, eyes cast downwards towards the floor.  He could see his big toe poking out of one of his socks.
“You cast a stinging hex.”  Harry says in delight.
“It was my house.”
“I love you too.” Draco replied and let his arms drop, although he did take Harry’s hand in his and give it a gentle squeeze. Harry looked into the silver-grey eyes and felt the warmth of feelings radiating from them.
“They didn’t.  The letter Draco got told him it was his responsibility to inform her.”  Harry had felt disgusted when he’d read that in the generic formal notification letter Draco had received.  He knew it was that one line that had resulted in him and Blaise almost losing Draco.  “Blaise wrote to her yesterday.  We haven’t picked a date for the funeral yet, though.”
“We’re going to rescue me.”   Harry was grinning too now.
The phone turned on after 10 minutes charging.  Ron and Hermione sat on the floor, the phone still attached to the wall, whilst they looked through its contents.  They looked at the last message received first, the one that triggered him leaving.   It was confusing.  It was the only contact Harry had ever had from that number and the message didn’t tell them anything.  Obviously, whomever sent it assumed that Harry would know who it was from and what it meant.  They could tell the three words ‘
“You’re in a good mood.” Harry said, when he finally felt ready to release Draco.
Family.  That was why he’d been going to the village.  He wanted a family who’d look after him and take him away from the fear that was living in the city.  From the bombs and the sirens and the constant threat of death.  He tried opening his eyes again.
“I don’t know.”
“Then you will testify that he worked willingly for the Dark Lord.  That he was never under the Imperius.  You will tell them how he hits you and leaves you half-dead and covered in bruises.  I know if it wasn’t for Severus you would never have managed this far.  I can brew healing potions for you.  But I need you to go to the Ministry.  The head of the Black family is willing to take both you and little Draco into his protection.  We have a safe place where no one can get to us.  As soon as Lucius has been convicted I can take over as head of the family and he will never be able to get to your baby.  I promise mother…. Please believe me…”
“Hush now… I’ve got you…”  It was then he recognised the voice as Sirius’.
“Fairly certain on the balance of things, you win on the Saviour front.”
“Tea would be great, and no I’m not just here for the pleasure of your company, although that is a bonus.  I wanted to talk about Ginny.”
“Now, I have been informed this evening by a student that there is an illegal defence club being run in this school.  It is being held in a room on the 7
“Cool by me.  Find a table and I’ll be there in a minute.”  Teddy said, not seeming to care about his milk preferences.
“The Hospital for Integrated Medicine.  But yes.” Draco said, correcting Harry’s use of the old name.
“Actually I have an idea about that.”  Harry said, rummaging in the trunk that had been sent back from Grimmauld Place the day before, and pulling out his invisibility cloak.  “I won’t be seen and will be able to stay in contact throughout your entire meal.”
Harry nodded.  “Go there.  I’ll come and let you in.  I can’t guarantee that I’ll let you come to the Manor, but you can stay there for the night at least.”
None of them, especially Draco and Harry, were happy about the return of the rest of the school.  It wasn’t that Harry didn’t want to see his friends, he did.  He had missed them, and he felt incredibly guilty for disappearing on them like that, especially on Christmas, but he knew that the happy bubble he’d been living in with Draco and Blaise would have to end.  That they’d have to go back to pretending they hated each other.  They would have to go back to sleeping separately.  None of them knew how they would actually manage that, but no matter how much they thought on the issue, they couldn’t come up with a good solution.  The best they could think of was just to push through it.  It was morosely that that packed up their things from the room.  The room seemed to be sulking with them but didn’t try to keep them there, or at least the door was still apparent.  They said their goodbyes at the door and then Harry made his way up to the tower with his things as Blaise and Draco walked hand in hand with their way down to the dungeon.
Narcissa came back from tea with Walburga Black to find the boys sat at home reading books on Horcruxes and drinking their weight in tea, whilst the babies played on the floor.  It was what they’d been doing for the entire four days since they’d come back from the Manor with whatever they could find on one of the most disgusting pieces of magic in existence.  Narcissa was pretty certain that finding this much about the darkest soul magic was good for them.  They’d had enough pain and suffering in their lives without inflicting more on themselves.  The research did need to be done, though, and she doubted very much that they’d listen to her if she told them to leave it to Remus.  She kissed each boy on the head, older and younger versions, before sitting down.  She was very grateful when Tawly immediately placed a hot cup of tea in her hands.  She was freezing.  The weather had taken a decidedly cold dip in the last couple of days.
“Sorry Harry, I’m just processing.”
“Pretty much if we’re out of the house we wear different faces.  The only places we don’t are when we visit friends, and only in their houses.  Bar of course my planned press appearances.”
“It’s okay.  I’m a witch.  It’s just been a while since I’ve seen a metamorphmagus.” Hermione reassures.
“Top cupboard.  I think there are chocolate digestives.”  Harry says, not looking away from Draco, who is starting to really panic.
“And it has that scene you like.”  Blaise teased.
“You know if Andi just needs a break Teddy would be welcome here.  Victoire comes here most days whilst Bill and Fleur are at work.”
“It was how old he was when he created the first one, so it’s the age he came back at.”
“Love you.”
Draco entered the room and Harry felt his vision tunnel.  Nothing else mattered now except for the amazing man walking towards him.  Blaise was at his side as Draco made his way to the front, and Harry.  The way Draco held his eyes told him that he was the only other person in the universe right now.  Harry stepped away from the alter and moved towards the man he loved.  Drawn to him.  Unable to spend another second apart.  They walked the last few metres together.
“Draco?” He said into Draco’s lips, eyes still closed.
_____________________
Hermione felt like she was going to be sick.
“You could take him.”
“I think he might be.  We can’t get our hopes up too much yet.  But I really think he might be.”
“I wasn’t sure what you wanted, so I got you a glass of Rosé.”  Harry said, sitting on the free armchair and placing both the glass of wine and his pint on the table.
“This is seriously weird.  You going to contact him?”  And that was the questions wasn’t it.  Would she contact him?  Could she face the feelings it would bring back up?
“I don’t want to.  He needs me more.”
“No rush, now.”  Harry said casually.
“You’re no fun.  Okay, we can change the subject.  Let’s get back to finding you an attractive man to keep your bed warm, chase away the cobwebs you must be developing from your lack of sex life, and keep my life entertained with more gossip.  Now go get us another drink and I shall start wracking my brain for an eligible man for you.” Draco laughed at Pansy’s antics and got up to get another round of drinks for the two of them.  He was fairly certain he had paid for the last round as well, but somehow, he always ended up forking out most of the bill when the two of them went out.
“Fine, but leave me in peace now, please”
A house elf came and showed him up to the imposing house.  He had to take a moment to just breathe when they got to the doors.  Working up his courage he stepped inside.
“He should.”  Harry said, a little sadly.  He wished Draco could do this for a living.  That he could feel comfortable enough in himself and others’ reactions to him.  “I think he’d be good at it.”
They quickly gathered the stuff they’d put down back up and went about sorting everything else they’d need for their change in location.  Harry felt very uncomfortable going into his 21-year-old godfather’s bedroom in order to pack a few days’ worth of clothes for the man.  At least it was vaguely cleaner and tidier in here than the sitting room.  Draco had no such issue, and quickly found gathered together some stuff.  They then went back to the living room and took hold of the asleep and snoring Sirius.  Draco apparated the three of them to apparatation coordinates given as closest to the flat they had chosen.  Once they’d claimed the flat, the goblin had assured them they would be able to enter the flat directly.  Surprisingly the drunk Animagus didn’t even stir.  God only knew how far into his cups he’d had to get to remain unaware that he’d been apparated.  Sirius remaining unconscious did mean that Harry and Draco had to haul the man up the stairs in the building.  But at least the man wasn’t stumbling, complaining, and more likely than not given the state he’d gotten himself into, vomiting.  Thankfully, they didn’t meet anyone on the way.  Neither really wanted to explain why they were dragging the unconscious man.  The flat was the penthouse in an old regency building overlooking a large park with a lake.  Harry looked out of the window when they reached the topflight of stairs and wondered whether there would be pedalos there in the summer.  He’d always wanted to do that as a child but had never been allowed.  If they stayed in this place longer than Draco planned, then maybe he would have a chance to find out.  When they entered the flat itself, they were, to Harry’s surprise, greeted by a young-looking house elf.
“I suppose not.  I can write to her an ask to see her again if that’s what you want.”
“Yes.  And after the fire neither of us liked to fly anymore.”
Hermione scrutinised him, her eyes seeming to bore right to his core.  He hoped that she couldn’t see into his mind, the way Snape had whenever he’d used a similar look.
“But it does, doesn’t it?”  Draco said, stroking his husband’s knee.  “I know you told them in the last note that you wouldn’t be in contact again, and for them not to contact you, but it doesn’t have to be the end if you don’t want it to be.”
“Mother.”  The word was slightly muffled but Harry understood.
“I’m going to get something to clean your feet and try and warm them up before you get frostbite, Draco.”
Harry got out his wand and transfigured one of the sofa cushions into a small cat bed and took it through to the kitchen.  He then placed the Malfoy kitten into the bed.  The kitten mewled and woke, looking up at Harry disapprovingly.  The kitten got out of the bed and walked towards Harry purposefully.  When it reached him, it lifted its front paws up onto Harrys’ leg and dug its claws in.
They walked back to Covent Garden and found a small café.  They sat and talked whilst waiting for their food to arrive.
“No problem.  You know you’re always welcome here.” Hermione said, with a yawn.
“Well I’m going to put these babies to bed.  Then I might try and get some sleep myself.  It’s been a rather stressful day and I for one am exhausted.  Do try and keep my cousin from finishing the entire liquor cabinet, Remus.”
“He was our friend.  He stopped being that a long time ago.”
“I do…”  Malfoy still sounded unsure whether this was a good idea.  “It will be cutting it really fine.  Mother took me to where the street was blown up and Sirius was arrested when I was little.  The joys of learning all about the Black family history.  I still remember where it was.  We know he’ll be there today.  We just have to spot him before he confronts Pettigrew.”
“Draco” she said quietly, trying to wake him from his nightmare as gently as possible. “It’s a dream Draco.  He’s not here, he can’t hurt you or your mother anymore.”  She forced the tears that were starting to well up back so Draco wouldn’t see how much his pain and fear had affected her.  To her knowledge it had been years since the Dark Lord haunted Draco’s nightmares.  She’d forgotten how much she hated hearing even the small glimpses of nightmare flashbacks.
“I’ll agree to that, Draco.” The name felt weird in Harry’s mouth but he was sure he’d get used to it.  “When do you want to start?”  Harry was excited to begin.  This tentative new friendship with Malfoy and the idea of working on the ridiculous baby animal potion made him feel more alive than he had since before he’d walked into the forest to his death.
Draco reluctantly handed his wand to Harry.  Harry wanted it in case he needed to leave the grounds, or adjust the ward, to talk to whoever was there.  He summoned his invisibility cloak so he could approach without them noticing, and made his way outside.  Blaise was holding Draco.  Harry wished he could stay too, but Draco needed him to sort out whatever was happening at the edge of the wards, and only he could do that.
“I assume that is enough to prove it to you.  I’m going to ask you to drop your appeal.  If there was any other way I would do it, despite how much I despise you, but I need a distraction to get Draco out of here safely.  You could spend the rest of your life locked in this miserable cell submitting appeals and trying to find a loophole.  But you know the best you are ever going to get is a life sentence.  This way you can do one last thing to help your family.”  Lucius’ face was a cold mask, and Harry didn’t know what he was thinking.  He continued, using every bit of manipulation to get the man to agree to his plan.
“Sentimental idiot.”  Draco kissed him more fiercely all the same.
“Well when were they ever sensible when it came to me and my dastardly Death Eater status.”
Harry sighed.  He wasn’t getting anywhere and didn’t think he was going to get anywhere anytime soon.  Carrying on talking about it would only make Draco angry, or worse, send him into one of his depressive spirals.  Draco had been so much better recently.  The last thing he wanted was to provoke the black cloud.  He decided to move on, and before long he and Draco were in hysterics over Molly’s latest attempts to get him and Ginny back together.  A small part of Harry felt guilty about mocking Molly and Ginny, but a much larger part, was just happy to have Draco laughing with him.  Eventually they payed their bill and left.  Harry kissed Draco at the gates of the Manor.  Every time they separated at the end of the night it was becoming harder to leave.  He disapparated home, wishing that Draco were with him.
“But Mister Potter… we have to insist.”
“I know Moony.  I held them at wand point for a fair while when they found me.  But I went to Gringotts with them and confirmed.  This is our Harry.  This is James and Lily’s Harry.  We’re staying at the Cheltenham place… you know the one we used to sneak out of Hogwarts and use when the horse racing was on.  Only Harry could have got us in there.  Just trust me Moony.  When we get there you can see little Harry.  He’s there at the moment with my cousin and little Draco.”
“No.  Dumbledore used to do things that were ‘necessary’ to me.  I won’t do it to little Harry.  He will not be used by anyone.”
“Yeah, well he was completely plastered.  I think he bought his own bottle of that stupidly expensive whiskey he used to like and finished off the whole thing by himself.  You have to remember that.”
“I will” Draco replied and got up to leave.  He wasn’t happy about Doris thinking he needed an early appointment, but he also knew that he couldn’t let things slide out of control as they had done all that time ago.  If he carried on the way he was going that was a serious possibility, and he wouldn’t put Scorpius through that. Draco was just opening the door when Doris spoke up again.
“I don’t know whether to hit you or kiss you right now.”
“I didn’t understand half of what you just said, Potter.  But it shouldn’t be too hard to modify the spell I used on the floor to take off the wallpaper.”
“And it was really you that killed Dumbledore.  Not Draco.”
It’s Harry that answers. “We’re visiting my Godson, Teddy and thought we’d see some of the places we used to like to go to. Next question.”
“It’s okay Teddy, this is Harry.  You remember Harry right.” She comforted the toddler.
“Lily…merlin that feels good…but….” Scorpius’s brain didn’t seem to know how to finish the sentence as Lily continued to touch him through his trousers.  He pulled her face back towards his and they were kissing again, his hands moving to her waist then up and under her shirt.  Then abruptly she stopped and looked at him.  She spoke then, finishing his thoughts from earlier.
Draco spoke first.
“What do I want?  What do I want?”  Her voice becoming more shrill.  “I want to know what the hell is going on with you.”
“You know you’re not allowed to say that kind thing Potter.  I might start to think you actually like me.” Harry knew Draco was trying to hide behind jokes and sarcasm.  That Harry talking about what the two of them were doing together made him uncomfortable.  “Besides, how could the great Harry Potter be allowed to have a shit day at work.  Don’t you have people falling over their feet to worship you?”
Draco shook his head and closed his eyes briefly, taking a deep breath to calm himself.  Potter was infuriating.
“Amazing.  He doesn’t work then?”
“We should send your ferret.”  Draco gasped when they broke apart.
Draco nodded morosely.  “At least that we’ve been able to find so far.”
Ginny looked like she wanted to object, but when she met his eyes and saw the determination there, she decided to acquiesce and left the room quickly.   Harry noticed that she was holding back tears but wasn’t sure that Lily had.  Lily was lost in her own fears and looked about to cry herself.
“I know” Lily sobbed and sniffed loudly.  “But she said what I was thinking, and all I could think about was that I didn’t need someone to point out what an idiot I’ve been.  I’ve spent weeks just hoping that this would all go away.”
“I’m not promising anything.  I have to go to my appointment now.  I’ll see you Hermione”
“Your break down?”  Pansy looked quizzical then, as if remembering something important, but she quickly shook her head, clearly deciding not to mention it.
“I… I don’t know what to say right now.”
Harry’s appointment with Doris was at 13.30pm.  He made his way into London early and went to have some lunch sat outside the tiny Espresso Room on Great Ormond Street. It was a nice day, and the coffee here was great.  He watched the nurses in their uniforms make their way between the children’s hospital opposite and some of the other buildings.  He watched clearly worried parents smoking on the street outside the hospital.  He didn’t blame them.  If one of his kids had been sick in hospital, he’d be a wreck and the fact that he hadn’t had a cigarette in over 15 years wouldn’t have mattered in the slightest.   Just before quarter past he got up and made his way to Doris’s office.  Harry sat glancing at the different magazines for about 10 minutes in the reception area before Doris waltzed through the main door and ushered him straight through to her office.
“It’s good to see you too, Kingsley.” Harry tried to force a polite smile onto his face as he greeted the Minister for Magic.
“Well you deserve it.  Now let me have one last hug with your little terror.”
“Yes.  We need to get warm.”
“But that’s not the point.  He’s telling us something with this.  The dedication in the first book.  It’s for us.  I know it’s for us.  He’s a bastard but he still cared.”
Harry knows he should leave.  The Weasleys are expecting him soon to look at wedding venues, but he can’t move.  He sits slumped at the table crying.
The rest of the week Harry had only been able to see Draco a few times, but the phone had proved invaluable.  They’d sent a handful of messages back and forth whist Harry was sat bored in his lectures on proper Auror conduct during a raid.  Waiting for replies had kept Harry more awake than he usually was during these classes, although it didn’t result in him paying any more attention to the instructor.  When he was called up to the front to help with some demonstration, which happened far too often for his liking, he didn’t feel quite so flat and deflated as he usually did.  The last message he’d received from Draco, a cutting admonishment about the standard of Auror training and the problem with doe eyed recruits, made him look at the whole farce much less seriously.  It was much easier to care significantly less about the fawning of his instructor and the rapt worship of the rest of the class, when he had Draco mocking them at the other end of a phone.
“Well so’s yours.” Scorpius punched Al’s arm
Harry felt like a great weight had been pressed down on him.  He wanted to talk to Sirius.  To ask him about the incident after their DADA OWL, but there was no way of contacting him that wasn’t being monitored.  All letters in and out of the school were being screened and read, and the only fireplace that allowed floo calls was the one in Umbridge’s office. Hermione had also chewed him out when he told her he wasn’t having anymore occlumency lessons.  He tried to explain that Snape wasn’t exactly helping him.  That he was quite able to keep Snape out of his mind and that it didn’t make a damn bit of difference, but she didn’t believe him.  She told him he should go to Snape and apologise and beg for them back.  He felt a little bad when he told her to sod off and stormed out to the Room of Requirement to wait for Draco and Blaise.  They didn’t take long to arrive.  Harry’s upset had obviously alerted Draco that Harry needed him.  Harry sobbed into Draco’s shoulder for a while, neither of them pressing on why Harry was upset until he had stopped crying.
“How did you two get together?”
“You don’t need to.  It seems to be mostly my problem.  You just need to avoid more detentions.  Also please don’t do something really stupid like fall off your broom and break something.  I know it will be a challenge for you, but I’d very much appreciate it.”
“Lily, come with me.” Scorpius said and took her hand.  He guided her through several winding corridors of the Manor, moving quickly.  Before long, the voices of the others got quieter and quieter until Lily couldn’t hear them at all.  He led her into a small sitting room.  She had no idea where in the house she was.  They were both slightly out of breath from running.  Without letting go of her hand Scorpius moved to sit on the comfortable looking sofa in front of the roaring fire and pulled her onto his lap.  Scorpius had explained that the house elves kept around half of the fires, even in the unused portions of the house, lit throughout the winter to prevent the Manor getting cold.  She guessed he knew which rooms were likely to have lit fires and therefore be comfortable places to hide.
“You’re not and you know it. Please.  For me.” Harry pleaded. “I am meant to show you muggle things.  You’d be doing me a favour.” Harry tried to make the request sound playful and teasing.  Trying to draw Malfoy into teasing him back.  Instead Malfoy stayed silent for several minutes and Harry hoped he hadn’t pushed too far, and that Malfoy wouldn’t spend the rest of the day in the almost catatonic state that Harry still didn’t know how to deal with.
“Malfoy…?”  He turned to look at the blond boy who was lying on the ground a metre or so away from where he was.
Al barely reacted to Scorpius’s outburst.  Instead he continued as if his best friend hadn’t just screamed at him.  “Do you want you and Lily to raise the baby?”
Andi comes to the Manor
“Like I’d leave you and Lily alone to deal with this.” Harry smiled. “How far apart are the contractions?  Do we need to go straight to St Mungos? I know how quickly this one came.” He nodded down at Lily, smiling at the memory of that night, now over 15 years ago.  He and Ron had been in the pub enjoying an afterwork drink with some of their friends from the office when a howler arrived screaming with Ginny’s voice telling him to get his arse to the hospital and an inventive collection of expletives.  Even the memory of what Ginny said she’d do to him made him wince to this day.
“No one.” Blaise snorted.  He couldn’t help himself.  “It was sheer luck.  I’m going to go home now.  Make yourself comfortable here if you wish.  Call on the elves if you need anything.  Whatever you do, do not send the elves to the Manor.  Draco doesn’t deal well with seeing house elves.  The last remaining Malfoy elves live here with Harry’s elf.  His is Kreacher, and the Malfoy ones are Pippin and Tomlin.  They’ll probably be delighted at having a guest.  They get a little bored.  We don’t really have much for them to do most of the time.”
“Draco… what the hell is the matter.” This time, he finally recognised the voice this time as Blaise’s.
“You know we can’t, although it does sound nice.  But we both have children and other people who rely on us.”
“The Locket.  It’s in a cabinet in Grimmauld place.  I’m sure.”
Hermione couldn’t help the tears pouring down her face.  He’d shown them all the years they had missed.  He had told her how he stayed hidden. Finally, Harry had told them where he lived.  He was right about it not making any difference.  This wasn’t a declaration that he wanted to rekindle their friendship.  Whatever she might wish, they had missed more than twenty years now.  She didn’t know this Harry, and from his letter and actions she didn’t think he was willing to let them get to know him now.  He’d done all he could to try and ease the hurt, and it had worked.  It had helped.  Now he was saying goodbye.  The goodbye they should have gotten when he walked out the first time.  It hurt, but not as much.  Not anymore.
Draco had spent the night at Blaise’s in the end, drinking and talking until the early hours of the morning.  He’d sent his mother an owl telling her he wouldn’t be back until the morning.  He’d sent it when he made the decision to stay, not long after Blaise had cracked open a bottle of rum.  It was the first time he’d had fun, without Harry, in more than three years.  Blaise had made him promise to come back soon.  Tempting him with promises of delectable sweet, fresh baked goods as soon as Greg sent a new batch.  He would have come back just for Blaise’s company; he didn’t need the bribe.  After agreeing to visit again, he’d admitted he was going to be in the village every week for the foreseeable future, as his therapist was based here.  Blaise hadn’t mocked him, as he feared, for talking to someone about the trauma he’d been through.  Instead he was supportive and kind.  He wished Draco luck with trying to deal with what had been a really shit lot in life.  Blaise’s kindness was so unexpected that Draco had started crying uncontrollably, and he had had to be helped to bed not long after.  The emotional swings, and in particular highs he wasn’t used to, combining with the alcohol had been too much.
“Shhhhh… Harry, it’s all okay.  You’re not there now.  You’re never going back there.  Little Harry will never go there.  We will keep him safe.  I promise we’ll keep him safe.”
“Did he ever say why though?”
“Harry.”  It was Hermione.  Harry had purposefully been avoiding trying to spot her and the Weasleys, although he knew they would be there.  He hoped that they would be avoiding him too, but he should have known better.  Of course Hermione would seek him out.  Draco looked at him and squeezed his hand.  Silently, with barely any movement, Harry indicated he was okay, and that Draco should leave them to it.
“You’re 16 and you’re scared.”  Harry said with conviction.  “Your Father is an evil bastard, but I don’t think you are.  You may have been a bully and a prat, but that doesn’t mean you deserve whatever is happening to you right now.  You look half-starved and sleep deprived.  You’re a wreck.  No, I don’t think you deserve whatever is happening to make your life so unbearable right now.”
“No need to scare the man, Dray.” The younger man spoke, apparently teasing the Death Eater, like it was nothing in the world.  Justin watched in wonder as the blonde just rolled his eyes in response, whilst Harry Potter looked between his two companions, bemused.
“I wouldn’t have either, but he returned with the item we wanted and without the sword.”
“Your family are weird.”
“It doesn’t appear so.”
“I deserve to be shouted at.” Scorpius said this to feet, not bearing to look at his Father at that moment.
Andi hadn’t told Narcissa about her illness yet, which was another disaster waiting to happen.  It was making Draco more and more anxious the longer it went on, as he was half expecting that between that and his own breakdowns, his mother would run from him again.  And it would no doubt distress Teddy, who was already becoming more fractious at the stress in his home life.  Harry had had to leave Draco one afternoon, when Andi was at an appointment at the hospital planning her treatment schedule, to go to the nursery to deal with the fact that Teddy had lashed out at one of the other toddlers in his class.  For the sake of his cousin, at the very least, Draco knew he had to somehow get himself together enough so that the whole mess that had erupted around him wouldn’t affect the toddler.
Harry kissed the blond man, pouring every feeling he’d had over the night into the kiss.  He dragged Draco to his feet and pulled him toward the bed.
“Malfoy, she’s left me” Potter slurred.
“Thank you for sharing this with me.  There is a lot to unpick here.  This event was clearly an important one but we’re out of time to talk about this today.  Next session I think we should talk about your childhood at the Dursley’s.  I know you’ve always been reluctant to cover this topic but there are some aspects about that time in your life that may help explain the way you reacted.  I’ll see you in two weeks Harry.”
Malfoy laughed as he watched from the floor.  “Actually I wasn’t just talking about the trousers.  It might be kinda hot to imagine you sat with your friends in the clothes you spilled your load in for me.  No, you actually have paint all down your back and in your hair.”
Blaise looked over at Harry and glared slightly.
Harry looked at Malfoy quizzically.  He thought he knew where this was going. And it was insane and more than he had ever hoped for.  “I was placed on the doorstep at some point during the night of the 1
Harry looked down at little Draco, who was also just waking.  He was very sweet with his white-blond hair and blue grey eyes.  The toddler snuggled into him warmly.
“You have a child?”
“You’re not banished from the place.  You can come and visit whenever you want.  Well at least, whenever you feel up to it.”
“I noticed.  It was bloody difficult to get my editor not to completely change my article and tear him apart in it.”  That had been a battle.  Normally Justin didn’t like to fight about things, but he had worked damn hard on the piece he’d written, trying to make it a fair and balanced article, instead of the usual inflammatory speculation the prophet printed.  It had only been when he brought up the threats the two men had made, as well as the possibility of a follow up interview, that his editor had caved.  Justin didn’t think there would be a follow up.  Not after the Gala.  He wouldn’t be surprised if Harry Potter didn’t decide just to vanish again.
Harry rummaged in the small pouch he always kept with him he and pulled out a biro.
“I was two.”  Teddy had become if anything, colder towards Hermione, both his eyes now the same shade of steely grey.  It was a stark contrast from the polite, if slightly clumsy, eager youth from minutes earlier.  She got the distinct impression that he didn’t want to talk about Harry.  It piqued her curiosity but before she could ask anything else Teddy spoke again.  “I think you need to leave.  I have somewhere to be and you seem much better now.  I’m sorry I couldn’t help you with finding your friend.”
“Hawwy.”  Little Draco cried.
“What are we going to do about them?”
“Mother… I am Draco.”  Narcissa looked properly and realised for the first time that this might not be Lucius.  The person kneeling in front of her with an expression on his face that Lucius would never wear, was younger and his eyes were wrong.  She stopped shaking and tried to listen to what he was saying.  “I know this doesn’t make any sense but me and my friend have come to take you and little Draco away from Father.   I don’t want little Draco to grow up watching him hurt you like I did.  I…  I know it’s hard to believe.  But…  If you stay… if you let Father manipulate his way out of going to Azkaban like he deserves.  Your baby is going to be forced to do this at 16.”  Draco slowly rolled up his left sleeve, showing his mother the Dark Mark.  Narcissa was confused.  She had seen that disgusting mark enough times on bother her sister and husband to know what it was.  Why was this stranger, who definitely appeared to be a Malfoy, even if he wasn’t Lucius, telling her that unless she left her baby would end up with that ugly thing?
“You don’t happen to have any of it left to analyse.  It sounds like a useful trick.  I’m sure George could do something interesting with it.”
With Harry, and Blaise; and Tara and meds and therapy, he had started to reclaim the person he wanted to be.  It wasn’t the same person he had been before the illness had started.  But then, who was the same person they were at 13 as 20.  He had lived through a war.  Had tortured and been tortured.  Had watched people die and lived with the threat of death over his head constantly for two years.  His disease couldn’t take all the blame for him not being who he imagined growing up into.  And he thought that was okay.  The person he’d grown into was a perfectly acceptable person to be in his opinion.  And if he wasn’t this person, the person who had all of the awful experiences of his life and an illness most people cringed away from, he wouldn’t have Harry and Blaise.   They weren’t something he would give up.  Not for anything.  There were still bad days, bad weeks and months if he was honest, when he got lost at either end of the spectrum.  But there were good bits too.  He liked the freedom from the pressure that had made up his formative years.  There was no one to judge him for being a recluse who enjoyed baking and music and walks on the grounds.  No one to tell him it wasn’t proper.  There were times when he wished he wasn’t plagued with crippling anxiety when he thought about leaving his safe haven.  But this was his lot.  And it could have been so much worse.
“That’s more like it, Potter.  Really you should be worshiping me for how fantastic a friend I am.  Who else would have opened his home to the poor Gryffindor escaping the cold hostile horror of England so he could run away with the love of his life?”
“Yes.”
“You think you should be feeling worse? Is that physically or otherwise.”
“Me and Draco weren’t.  Teddy took the other two.  He wanted to show them around his old haunt as well.”
“As you had every right to do.”  Pansy snorted.
“Yeah, I just couldn’t get rid of this baby if there was someone out there that wanted it.  I understand that it’s not that simple in reality.  Tabitha said it was what she planned to do initially but that when the time came, she couldn’t go through with.  But Tabitha didn’t have anyone to support her.  She’d just lost her family because of Hattie.  She was trying to do it all by herself.  I don’t have to do it by myself.  I want to find the perfect family for my baby.  They’ll grow up happy and loved, and Scorpius and I can still have the lives we want.  Pansy said it was okay to be selfish about this.  But I can still be a little selfish and make someone else very happy.”
“I know, I know.  But mother wants me home to talk about my marriage contract.”
“That’s fine.”  Harry replied, and squeezed Draco’s hand gently.  “She can stay at the Black house and you can decide what you want to do in the morning.”
“They’ve set a trial date for the 3
“Pessants.  Pessants.” The exited toddler exclaimed, jumping up and down.
“All outside at last count.  We took some of George’s sparklers out to them about half an hour ago and they all seemed to be accounted for.”  Angelina answered.
“Yup.  After today you will be the proud owner of your very own irritating bleeping device.”
“Oh, hey Andi.”  Harry said, letting go of Draco and coming over to Andromeda to kiss her cheek.  Draco did the same.
“Someday you’ll have to tell me all about it.  Right now, I’m feeling sleepy.”
“We’ve got about an hour with these ones, right Draco.”
“I’ve got little Harry here as well.  Would you like to meet him properly?”
Draco was now feeling flustered, and decidedly stupid for not having predicted this.  Andromeda was a Black, and she was shrewd.  He just had to keep calm.  Use every ounce of decorum, he’d had pounded into him as a small child.  Put on the cool façade that had kept him alive with the monster in his house. At the same time he needed her to be curious enough to actually let him in the house.  “I know.  There is something else.  But we can’t discuss it on the doorstep.  May I come in?”  He tried to express with every ounce of body language he could muster that this was important.  For several long moments Draco thought she would refuse him.  He sighed with relief when she stepped back and indicated that he should enter.  He followed her through to a comfortable looking sitting room.
“And let me guess, your gorgeous friend Pansy saw one in the last week and insisted you made an appointment.”
“You can still remember our order though.  I’m Harry and please let me introduce you to my husband and godson.  Victoria, this is Teddy.  And my pretty blonde who you remember from all those years ago is Draco.  We’re sorry we haven’t been back sooner, but we moved out of the country.”
He walked out of the room, trying to ignore the sounds of crying behind him.  He closed the door on the sound and walked back down to the dungeons. He’d gone from happy and excited to this in minutes, but every time the baby was mentioned it was like something started eating his insides and he just had to run.  He collapsed onto his bed and pulled the curtains around him.  He wanted to shut out the world.
“I thought you guys always hated each other.  That’s what mum always said.  Was she lying? Were Aunty Hermione and Uncle Ron lying too?”
“Not about Father.”  Draco said, panicked, dropping the saltshaker, and spilling the white crystals on the table.
“Why shouldn’t I be angry with you?” Draco’s shoulders slumped and his tone didn’t match his words.  It didn’t hold any of the fury that had been directed at the furniture minutes ago.  It was sad.  It spoke of pain and despair.
“Draco.  You’re already dressed.  You don’t need to change for dinner with me and Blaise.”  Harry tried to reassure his lover, unsuccessfully.
“That sounds lovely, although I won’t join you.  You take him out with Blaise and Draco.  Maybe you three could come back here for tea afterwards though.”  Andromeda didn’t want to admit it, but knew there was no way she’d manage to keep up on a day out.  Her exhaustion was just getting worse.  It was getting harder and harder to look after Teddy.  She was going to have to talk to Harry about whether Teddy could spend a little more time at nursery soon.  But she would wait until after the tests.  Hopefully, they’ll be able to tell her what was wrong and fix it.
“Actually, Hermione.  It won’t.”  Harry winced a little at the admission.
“Not really.  A blood curse of some kind.  And that it has been sat around for some time.  They don’t know quite what set it off now.”
“I had guessed Harry was here from what you said earlier, but I wasn’t quite expecting this.  How long have you been together?”
“Yeah, well, I was 12 and my planning skills were rather lacking.  I just told him to keep you away from Hogwarts and not let you or anyone else know you’d been sent by me.  Everything else was on him.”
“I know, Harry.  I’m just sorry that you didn’t think you could come to me.  I would have understood.  Draco reminded me earlier that I did something very similar when I ran off with Ted.”  Her own experience and feelings of empathy were helping her to understand and forgive the young men their foolishness.  “I think I need to get that little boy home to bed now.  I want to see you again though.  And soon.   I missed you Harry, and Teddy did too.  I’m looking forward to getting to know you better Draco.  I just wish it hadn’t taken this for you to get in contact with me.”
“And he’s not moving.  I’m very comfortable.” Draco rubbed his head against Harry’s thighs as he spoke his objection to Harry moving.  It felt decidedly nice, although this absolutely wasn’t the time to be thinking about that.  Not with Draco just home.  The look Blaise gave him told Harry he knew exactly what had gone through his head in the last few seconds.
“I love you; you know.  I do have one more question though.  Do you think we’ll ever go back there?”
“I believe this is why you two shouldn’t be left in the house together for extended periods of time.  You’re a bad influence on each other.”  Tara chastised.
“That’s fantastic.  I’m glad you’re making plans for the future.  I want to go to University too.  I’ve talked about it with McGonagall in our private sessions.  I want to work in advanced transfigurations, which probably means working for the Unspeakables eventually.  But I think I want to do a biochemistry degree first.  I’m going to have to take loads of extra classes to get up to scratch with the muggle components of it before then though.  My therapist says that making these kind of plans helps.”
“He wants to go to the funeral.  Going to the hospital didn’t really count as him leaving as he was unconscious.  I don’t want a repeat of the last time we tried to leave on the morning he buries his Father.  It’s going to be distressing enough as it is.”
“It’s okay love.  You go back through the fire to mum and tell her I’m coming.  I’ll get dressed and be right behind you.”
“How did no one realise you were gay?  How did you not figure out you were gay until now?”
Anyone reading this as a work in progress who read chapter 10 before the 26.05.2019 please be aware that I've altered that chapter slightly and Doris isn't aware of the gender of the person Harry was with back in eighth year.  Sorry, I just felt it worked better like this.  This applies to the next chapter too.  The next few chapters are all from Harry's point of view and run across the same time period the previous two chapters cover.
“Yup, but I didn’t think that was going to happen anyway.  I was surprised you weren’t already sound asleep when I came back.”
“The reason that mine and Ginny’s sex life wasn’t working was because I am gay.  The main reason I haven’t told anyone about the relationship I had back then was because it was with another man.”
When Blaise came back it was to find Harry, Draco and Teddy all sat on the bed.  Draco had a delighted grin on his face as he poked Teddy in the stomach making him giggle, and for the first time since Draco was admitted, Harry looked truly relaxed.
“I’m glad they like it.  Maybe we could go out to dinner sometime next week.  We’d have you over this evening, but unfortunately we already have plans.”  Harry said, his most winning smile spreading across his face.
“It’s the whole Weasley thing, and letting myself be seen, isn’t it?”  Draco could hear the guilt in Harry’s voice.  “I know you don’t like it, and if you want it to stop you just have to say.”
“I know. It’s just… I feel like it was my fault.”
“What’s in the envelope, Gin?” Hermione asked her sister-in-law.
“That’s a sensible idea.  But remember you can talk them through with me and your mum too.  I’m going to go now so you can sleep.  I’ll come back tomorrow.  But if you need me at any time just send me an owl and I’ll come straight away.  I’m sure your mother would say the same.”
“I’ll write and ask to stay with Blaise for the start of the holiday.  Say with Father under arrest I want a break from everything.  She knows how to take care of herself, and I can go to the Manor when Blaise is back.  You will not be alone this summer.  Hopefully by that time we’ll have worked out a way to get between the Manor and the Black Property.  The disadvantage of the more secure of the family wards we’ll need to activate, if they are anything like the Manor ones, is it blocks floo access entirely.”
“Still nicely vague about his mystery person’s identity.  You let me in on so much personal information, but not this. I’m guessing that none of your friends know about this still.”
Malfoy moved up behind Harry and reached from behind and to take the wrist of Harry’s wand hand in his own.  Harry closed his eyes as Malfoy slowly directed his hand to make the movement for the spell.  Harry could feel Malfoy’s warm breath on his neck.  He tried to focus on the spell but was unable to concentrate on anything else but the sensation of the man behind him.  Unable to hold back with the close contact, Harry found himself turning his head slightly and pressing his cheek into Malfoy’s.  He used his free hand to reach back behind Malfoy’s head, his fingers tangling in the soft blonde hair.
Once they were together sleep came quickly.  The stress of the day apart had exhausted them.  Harry’s dreams were filled with Draco, Blaise and the infernal corridor, the one that haunted at least half his dreams, that night.  Too early for Harry’s liking, something woke him up.  He opened his eyes blearily.  An alarm was going off.  It sounded similar to the muggle alarm clock he knew Petunia and Vernon used.  He looked around to try and find out how to shut it off, but he couldn’t work out where the noise was coming from.
“But you still get upset.”
“Yeah.  Do you want me to tell you the whole story?  After everything I said, I think I owe you that.”
“Well someone had to keep that one company.”
“That’s great Siri. And Narcissa?”  Harry said, skirting over the photo debate, which had been talked about far too often.  It wasn’t like they could even do anything without tipping their hands.  And he didn’t need Narcissa focussing and fussing over it too, although he doubted he’d escape that, once she realised the implications of the photo.
“Stay here then Sirius.  Me and Draco will be staying in Tom’s room, Tawly will be on alert, and I will make sure that you will not be able to enter where he is.  Keep an eye on little Harry that way.  I’m too tired to argue properly right now.  I just know that if Narcissa is staying with us, then little Draco will be too.  And that means little Harry has to stay here.  I left little Harry with people he was safe with when the life of someone who I care about was being threatened.  I understand why you threatened him.  If I was in your shoes, I would have wanted to kill him too.  But can you just trust me for the time being.  In a few days, when Tom is stronger, you can meet him and know that I am right about him.  Your only other option for getting him out of this flat is going to Dumbledore and there is no way in hell I’m letting you do that.  You even think about it and I will oblivate your arse so fast you won’t even have time to blink.  Then me, Cissa, Tom and Draco will take the babies out of the country and you’ll never see any of us again.”
Harry saw that one of the Aurors had spotted them and started walking purposefully towards them.  Harry recognised the hand gestures to the others from his training.  They were trying to surround them.  Not that it mattered.  The five of them each grabbed two phials from their pockets.  Harry watched as Hermione drank hers cautiously, whilst the five of them swallowed theirs down.  This was par for the course for their lives.  Hermione looked stunned as the phial in her hand vanished almost as soon as she’d finished drinking.
“You have to.”  Blaise said, with a kiss that Harry knew meant he had no choice.
“Of course you do dear.  I never see that look of longing whenever I light up and you’re having a stressful day.”
Molly and Arthur arrived back at the Burrow with the children about twenty minutes after Harry had left.  Ron and Hermione hadn’t said a word to each other in that time, each sat caught up in their own thoughts.  When they got back Arthur herded the children into the garden and gave them some giant pieces of paper, and a large variety of paints.  It was a messy activity, one that would keep them occupied whilst the adults talked.  Molly had gotten a bottle of wine out and poured everyone a large glass, despite the fact it was barely mid-afternoon.  Hermione knew her parents-in-law were waiting for some kind of explanation about what had happened, but she wasn’t ready to talk yet.   She kept on switching between being upset and angry at Harry, and furious at herself.  She should have left the whole thing alone.  She should have never turned up at Andromeda Tonks’ expecting answers.  She wished she hadn’t decided to walk past Grimmauld Place that day.  She’d let her curiosity get the better of her.  Being in the dark was easier than having to deal with everything Harry had told her.  She felt conflicted and guilty about Harry’s revelations.  If everything he told her was true, it wasn’t just Harry who’d been a crappy friend, it was all of them.  She hadn’t realised how much pressure they were putting on him, and how destructive some of their behaviours were. Still, she didn’t think she could forgive him for not telling them how he was actually feeling then.  That instead he’d gone to Malfoy of all people.  That he had prioritised Malfoy over them.  That he was still prioritising Malfoy.  She wanted it to be some kind of trick.  That it was some kind of magic that had made Harry toss them over for the spiteful bully she remembered, but there was nothing in Harry’s demeaner or behaviour that indicated that.  That he fell in love with the Slytherin was the only explanation that made sense, even though it made no sense to her at all.
“Well, you probably should have returned the unused potions.”  The healer looked at him frowning slightly.
“So I saw Andi today.”
The floo call did calm most of Harry’s doubts.  Remus had been with Sirius, which meant he was also able to contribute to the conversation, and Harry had appreciated his old Professor’s input.  It did, however, mean that he wasn’t able to tell Sirius about the bond.  Harry didn’t know exactly why, but all three of them knew the only person they could even consider telling was Sirius.  That no one else would understand.  It was the same way they knew they couldn’t show anyone their patronus forms.  The bond knew, and to go against it was a dangerous game.  They reinforced what Draco had said about fifteen/sixteen-year-olds being able to grow up, and that Sirius, despite the fact that he still disliked Snape, felt ashamed of the bullying behaviour he had once thought of as perfectly normal.
“Draco, do you want to meet him?  He is your second cousin, or something, as well as my godson.”
“You’re an idiot Potter.  When you walk away it hurts him.  When he walks away, and you don’t follow, it hurts him worse.  I don’t know you well Potter.  But I think you feel more for him than you want anyone, even yourself, to know.  You have two choices now, walk away and keep contact to an absolute minimum, despite the fact that your kids seem determined to tangle your families together; or you go to him.  Tell him every fucking thing you have felt over the years.  Tell him you’re sorry.  Don’t leave him hanging for weeks on end, only turning up because circumstances dictate it or because you’re drunk.  Don’t make him feel like he’s second best.  And if you ever cause, or even allow him, to turn up at mine in the state he was in last night again, he will not be able to stop me from making you experience every bit of pain he has ever felt, whether it was your fault or not.  I’m leaving now.  I hope you make the right decision.”
“Yeah.  Just lots of things to think about.”
“Potter, you are a complete idiot you know that.”  Draco said, the second they’d entered the empty classroom they’d used before.  Draco had grabbed Potter as soon as he’d seen him and dragged him to the room.
The crowds took up the jeering.  Harry watched as Draco stormed down the street.  He thought he detected a look of pain, under the mask of indifference just as Draco disapparated away.
“Blaise was buying the drinks.”  It was always Blaise’s fault when things got out of control, so it was a fair bet that it was him that had been to blame for them getting hammered that day.
“Scorpius, you’ve grown so much.  I wondered where you were, your father came through earlier.  Hannah told me you were out shopping with him, but he rushed through before I could ask after you”
“Yeah, I guess I’ve just been busy with Auror training and stuff.  Besides, after everything that happened, I wanted to give her some space.”  Again the half-truths were easier than outright lies, and the more he told the simpler it was, and the less guilty he felt.  He’d barely thought of Ginny at all since he’d started going to the Manor to see Malfoy.  If he was honest with himself, he knew he didn’t really miss her. Certainly not in the way he thought he should.  When they’d broken up a year ago, he’d thought she was everything.  That he could never love anyone like that.  He didn’t want to tell her his feelings had changed.  Didn’t want to see her hurting more than she already was.
“There was a photo in the house.”  Andromeda Tonks said this very deliberately and carefully.  It didn’t seem like an outright lie, but it didn’t feel like the truth either.  Hermione needed more data.
“About an hour before we were spotted.” Draco had to admit, although he didn’t look happy about it.  It made it seem more like the decision to come out to the public was a rash one, not carefully thought out, which to be fair, it was.  But Draco didn’t like to come across as someone who didn’t carefully think through his actions.  It had taken him eight years of deliberation to try going out in public without his mask on with Harry, and even then, somewhere where they shouldn’t have been seen.  Despite that, somehow, it had taken all of five minutes to throw away the 23 years of carefully keeping themselves separate from the public.
“Don’t tell me you’re watching this.”  Blaise said, leaning up against the door frame of the living room, obviously having just gotten back from the hospital.  They’d just reached the end of the first episode and it was rolling into the second.
“They don’t know what’s wrong.  But just…  I need you to get better….”
“I’d kill the bastard that… Fuck…”  Recognition dawned across Ron’s face.
“You too, Hermione.  Now can I get either of you something to eat and drink.”
“Nice and melodramatic, Potter.”
When Harry arrived home, he hoped against hope that Draco hadn’t chosen this moment to block him from the Manor’s wards.  He felt nervous as he threw the powder in the flames and watched them turn green.  With great effort, his leg was hurting more than it had in nearly a year, he knelt on the floor and clearly said “Malfoy Manor” before putting his head in the fire.
The time until his exams was approaching rapidly.  He had a careers advice session with McGonagall, which he’d almost forgotten.  It was a fairly useless meeting as not only did he have no idea what to do, but Umbridge was sitting in it as well.  He was very pleased however at his head of house’s praise at his improved grades across the board, bar DADA, which he didn’t count as he knew he’d do well in the actual exam in spite of Umbridge’s ineffectual and biased teaching.  Fred and George had left the school in a blaze of glory, having gotten completely fed up with Umbridge.  They had used his investment to set up a permanent shop in Diagon Alley for all the products they had tested, and successfully sold to the students.  Harry hoped he would be able to visit during the summer.  During the last quidditch match of the season, Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw, Hagrid had dragged him and Hermione into the forest and introduced him to his half-brother, Grawp, and managed to extract a promise from the two of them to visit him if Hagrid was forced to leave the school.  A prospect that seemed more and more likely.  Umbridge had gotten rid of Trelawney even before she had become Headmistress and had been inspecting all of Hagrid’s lessons with extreme distaste.  Before he knew it, his OWL exams were upon him.  All in all, they had gone well.  He was fairly certain he’d managed to memorise enough of the crap in divination to pass with at least an Acceptable.  He’d also managed to finish his star chart and was only checking it over before the horrible distraction of Umbridge trying to remove Hagrid from the school, and McGonagall receiving four stunning charms to the chest.  It had made him feel sick to watch, and more than ever he wanted the bitch that had caused it out of the school.  Even if it meant the risk of Dumbledore coming back and the potential that his secret would be uncovered increasing.  He was in no doubt that if anyone was going to discover the bond it would be the Old Headmaster.  His potions exam had gone perfectly, as had his charms one.  There was a slight issue in transfiguration, but he’d been able to fix it promptly, and hoped it wouldn’t affect his grade too badly.  In DADA he was completely confident he had received an Outstanding, even though he had refused to produce his Patronus, using the excuse that he didn’t want to show off or distract the other candidates in the hall currently completing their practical.  The small Professor Tofty, who was invigilating, looked a little disappointed, but had accepted.  Patronuses were a NEWT level spell, not a 5
“Shhhh…..  It’s okay…  He’ll be here soon.”  Blaise tried to reassure despite the fear that filled at Draco’s words.  Harry couldn’t be gone.  Draco would… He would… They couldn’t manage without Harry.
“You’ve seen the photos.  Look I know things are pretty shit between us.  But I really did miss you.  I need to go get Draco now, but – “ Harry rummaged through his pockets and pulled out a phial and biro. “Drink this and watch.  I think I’d like to talk again.  I’m not ready for the rest of them yet, but I think I could talk to you again.  Do you have a piece of paper or parchment?”
Harry was sat in the carriage with Draco, Teddy, Blaise, and Pansy.  They’d gone to Hogsmeade under glamours to avoid the press, that were out in droves, trying to spot himself and Draco arriving.   Once inside the gates of the castle they would be drop their disguises, and the real chaos would begin.  At least there wouldn’t be journalists inside to harass them, just the privately invited war victims, people with more money than sense buying tickets on the pretext of caring, politicians, and far too many of their old schoolteachers and classmates, all of whom would be staring.  Harry wasn’t sure whether what he was feeling was excitement or anxiety, but anxiety seemed more likely.  His thoughts kept on darting between a variety of worst-case scenarios, and ones where both him and Draco were accepted by everyone there. There was also the nervous thrum of energy that they were actually taking this step and coming out of the shadows.  Of course there was a good chance they would end up straight back in the shadows again, but that seemed to matter less than the actual trying.  Blaise and Pansy, as Draco had predicted, had insisted on coming too.  So when he wrote to McGonagall, accepting his invitation for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century, the day before the article came out, he told her to expect him and Teddy, as well as three guests.  He decided against giving their names, though after the article she could safely assume one of them was Draco.  He had no idea what she thought, having given her no way of responding, but the invites had been left for them in Hogsmeade, as he had asked.  They also had an escape plan in place.  Draco had insisted, and even if he hadn’t Harry would have.  The person most at risk in this insane plan, was Draco.  If he’d thought about that more when he was telling the reporter he and Draco were going to be attending this thing, he would never had said they were going.  But he was too stubborn to go back on his word, and he’d kind of liked the reporter – he also had a suspicion Teddy liked him too, although in a different way – and it didn’t seem fair to make the boy look a fool by not turning up at this thing.  Besides, with their contingency planning, the risks were minimal.  Even if everything went disastrously wrong, it would mean no more than one evening ruined and back to their quiet life in Tuscany.
“I’ve bought you baked goods.”  Harry announced as he walked into the small cottage, not bothering to knock.
“So you and Draco, –“  Hermione felt weird using Malfoy’s first name, but felt she should make the effort. “- you’re heading back to Tuscany soon?”
“Not yet” Angelina replied. “Should I go and disturb them too?”
“So this is what you call studying then” Al said, and neither Scorpius or Lily knew what to say in reply.
“Hey…” Harry shoved Draco lightly with his shoulder.
“I’m in pain.  I received a Howler from my friends just because I was out of touch for 24 hours.  How am I supposed to act?  Grateful?”  Harry knew the last word came out sarcastically.
“And that they didn’t like that Ronald Weasley had just snorted at their family name and insulted them.  And Little Draco will know better than to get defensive if that happens and insult him back.”
‘Please Draco…’
“Fresh batch.  It’s still warm.”
“It was you.”
it was just the stress of getting a wedding planned.  He didn’t correct them.
“Your Son was given the same sentence as you six days ago.  He’s not fighting it.  In less than two months he will be gone, and I won’t let that happen.  To do that I need your help.”
“One of us will come through in the morning.  Breakfast will depend on Draco.  Have a good evening, Mrs Malfoy.”
The two of them quickly washed and dressed in clean clothes.  They’d fallen asleep in what they’d been wearing the day before.  When they got to the breakfast table everyone was already seated around it.  Little Harry and Draco were chattering away in their usual baby talk to each other.  Draco kissed them each on the head before kissing Narcissa on the cheek and sitting down.  Harry did the same, although he wasn’t quite sure why he kissed Narcissa on the cheek.  He barely knew Draco’s mother.  It didn’t seem to matter though, as she appeared pleased with the guesture.
“Is it the whole homosexual thing.  I know that can be tricky.  My best friend was kicked out of home when he came out to his family.”
“Do we have a deal, Justin?”  The blonde reiterates.
“Let me guess.  If no one wanted to mentor me I’d have ended up in Azkaban.  Noble Potter couldn’t let that happen, could he.  Aren’t I already indebted to you enough?  Why’d you have to go and make it worse?  You should never have spoken at my trial.  You should never have agreed to do this.  I deserve to be there.”
Harry didn’t think he was, but from an outsider’s perspective he could see how it would seem that way.  “I’m very sorry, Sir.  I just don’t want to be a liability to the department.”
“No.”  Harry snapped back.
“So do I, Dobby.  Maybe when I do, I can assign you as little Draco’s personal elf.  I would have you as my own, but I have a feeling you’d prefer to help with the baby.  Especially when you meet a person I very much hope will be his new friend.”  Draco reached back and took Harry’s hand again as he said this, and Harry squeezed tight.  “Mother… come with us.  Everything will be alright if you come with us.”
“You’re not allowed up there.” The two girls chorused, before they both skipped off into the main common room.  They seemed to have come away from the collision without a scratch, much to his irritation.
“I’m so sorry Father.”
That was enough to distract them from Harry’s absence overnight.  The two of them ranted at him for a while, with him only half having to participate with the conversations.  They continued bickering all the way through breakfast and only stopped when Snape entered the room for their first class of the day.  Potions.  Harry spent most of the lesson staring at the back of Draco’s head, having to resist the smile that wanted to form whenever the blonde turned round to look at him.  As a result his potion turned into a sludgy mess.  He’d been doing better in potions since Draco had been tutoring him, but he didn’t miss the look of glee on Snape’s face as he took 15 points from Gryffindor and gave Harry a zero for the class and vanished the mess of his potion attempt.
“So this tells us that things are better.  This was a relatively short episode, even with the additional stress your injury has put on him.  None of this is likely to go away entirely.  It’s just going to get more manageable.  And you and Blaise manage very well when he can’t.”
“What do you think it means?”
“Scorpius, what’s happened?  Is something wrong with Lily?”.
“I don’t want to know, do I?”
“I’m sure you two wouldn’t mind some alone time in the Slytherin dorms.” Blaise winked, causing Pansy to hit him.  Harry thought it was a brilliant plan, and grinned at Draco, who for once seemed to be in complete agreement with one of Blaise’s schemes.
“Oh.  Well, I don’t think I quite expected that.  I assumed it was the Daily Prophet making up its usual rubbish.”  McGonagall’s eyebrows raised in shock and sniffed sharply inward at his confession.  He remembered she used to do the same thing when he forgot to do his homework when he was back at school and had to pull himself together slightly before he relied.  He still expected her to give him detention for disappointing her.
“I was just wandering if you fancied coming over to mine for dinner this evening. I was thinking about ordering an Indian in.  I’ve been a bit of a git to the two of you for the last couple of weeks and thought I should probably make it up to you.”
“Hey you.  Photographer, Journalist whatever you are.  Come over here.”  The blonde man shouted again.
“I know I’m an idiot who manages to get hurt far too often, but I love you.”
“Yes.  He told me your darling wife was pregnant following an affair.”
“I forgot the spells.  Just once.  But clearly it was enough.”
“Can…can…I go….see mum now” Lily sobbed.
‘Why did the universe have to make it this difficult to speak to Lily’, Scorpius thought to himself as he pulled himself to his feet for a second time.  There was a shout from above him and Scorpius looked up.
“You should go now, Potter.  It’s after lunch and I’m sure you have something else that you should be doing.”  Malfoy’s voice was icy as he said this, and he wouldn’t look towards Harry.   Harry eased himself up out of the chair.  He walked towards where Malfoy was standing and put a hand on his shoulder, wanting him to turn and face him.  It was shrugged off instantly.  Harry felt the pain of rejection acutely.
“So where’s your better third today?”  Tara asked.
“I love you, you giant wanker.  The other two I tolerate.  Just.”
“No…. that’s Draco.  The gate is practically useless; has been since he was released.”
“I know… But little Harry isn’t going to live that awful life.  He is going to grow up loved with Siri and with us.  And little you isn’t going to have all of that pureblood shit shoved down his throat, or have to watch his mum being hurt by his father.  We can make sure it’s better this time.  It will be better for both of us this time.”
“I mostly just hung out here and read and did my homework. And yeah, he’s one of Malfoy’s friends.”  Harry had to remember not to slip use Draco’s first name.
He slowly started to make his way towards the trio.  He’s not sure he trusts them, but he’s curious.  To his knowledge Harry Potter has not spoken to any journalists since before the war, let alone since his disappearance and subsequent sightings.
“I don’t want too be a part of this, Father.” Scorpius practically shouted, and Harry could see how it was affecting Lily.  He beckoned to her to come sit next to him and squeezed her shoulder as she sat down.
________________________
“In what way can’t you deal with her, Draco?”  Tara asked.  They were sat in the small sitting room today for his therapy session.  Harry was out with Teddy somewhere and wouldn’t be back for a few hours.  He picked up a biscuit from the plate on the coffee table.  For once it wasn’t one he’d made.  Harry and Teddy had ended up in the kitchen the day before and made what Harry insisted was shortbread, but that Draco wasn’t so sure about.  He didn’t think shortbread was meant to be covered with bright coloured icing. They tasted good enough though.  He dipped the biscuit into his tea before taking a bite and steeling himself to talk.
“I’m good for a while yet.  Now we’re here, it’s not actually that bad.”
“No…” Draco had recognised who was speaking at the last pleading words.  “Blaise… just help me… need… need to go… will be better if I get there…”  Talking was hard and Draco’s brain felt fuzzy with pain and the tugging sensation was becoming increasingly distracting.
“But I want…”
“No.  He was a little on edge.  He’d made four batches of truffles and spent our appointment making an enormous chocolate cake, but nothing that made me think he was about to do this.  If I’d been worried, I wouldn’t have left, or I would have called one of the two of you home.”
“So we take the Gryffindor approach and say fuck it to the principles of time travel.”
“I’ve told you why. We need our privacy.  He needs to feel safe and our set up helps.  So please just let it lie.  I’ve already told you too much.” Harry felt exasperated.  He really had already said more than he had planned.  He hadn’t wanted to go into Draco’s issues in this much detail, but he also knew Hermione.  She wasn’t going to let this go.  If he didn’t say something she’d try and follow him into Grimmauld and discover the whole secret.  “Look, the war affected him even worse than it did me, which is not something I say lightly.  He’s been doing pretty well for this last year, lots of things are still a struggle, but it is getting more manageable and the bad episodes are getting further apart and shorter.  When I tell you that four days of having to deal with someone who is incapable to taking themselves to the bathroom was actually not that bad, know that I’m saying it from experience of having to do it for a month.”
“I’ll see you Friday then… Harry”
“Draco it’s Christmas… try and open your eyes… please…”
“Will that change anything regarding your inheritance?”
“T..tt..tea please.” Potter eventually stammered out.
“The Minister for Magic’s authority.  Do you doubt Harry Potter?”  Harry said superiorly.  He usually hated using his name to get him what he wanted, but for Draco he didn’t care.  The bond had been blocked since the courtroom.  It had been a nagging ache at the back of his mind, although nothing like the pain of their continued separation could be.  It had already been more than two months since they’d been able to be together, the longest they’d ever gone, and they’d only been able to keep themselves from going mad with the pain by entering each other’s minds on a daily basis.  But Draco didn’t want them to do that whilst he was surrounded by Dementors, so he’d gone with the only other option and blocked the connection completely.  It hurt, but it compared to how it could have been had he been constantly feeling Draco’s suffering in this awful place, it was just about tolerable. Draco was saving him from having to enter his mind and sit in the prison cell surrounded by despair.  Still, even knowing how awful it would be, he wished Draco would let him in.
Draco stamped his foot, and then pulled Harry to the bag and grabbed out one of the hated purple potions.  Then glared at the glass and the potions bottle in turn and squeezed Harry’s hand twice.  Draco’s communication skills had come back, even if he wasn’t talking right now.  It was one of the positive signs that Draco was actually feeling okay, normally it took at least a day before he started doing much more than hand squeezing.  Unlike when he was in the catatonic state, his not verbally communicating wasn’t because he was incapable, but because he wasn’t ready.  He needed the time to process and not talking gave him that time.
Tabitha looked over at Scorpius quickly, then seemed to assess the situation.  Lily was sure having a male in the room was making the other girl even more nervous.
“Tank you, Blaise.”  Teddy says, in the politest tone the toddler can manage.  It makes all of the adults smile.
“I’ve done nothing of the sort.” Malfoy replied.  Harry lets his eyes drop to Malfoy’s trousers.  Malfoy follows his gaze, looking down at his trousers to the smudge of paint, the pale purple showing up starkly against the black cloth.  Harry wants so desperately to kiss the irritated scowl from Malfoy’s lips.  “I’ve clearly got a crap instructor.” Draco’s haughty tone make Harry want to start laughing all over again, but he resists.
“I did something dreadful after you left, and I don’t know how to undo it?”  Harry started, taking the conversation down the path it had to go, but that he wished he could avoid.
“Really, don’t worry about it.  I’m happy to.  I’ve had a really good time with you.  You can pay next time.”
Harry turned from the elder Malfoy and looked straight into Draco’s eyes and with a quick mental ‘I love you’ counted down.
“Yup.  The papers are printing all sorts of rubbish about Dray, which he pretends doesn’t hurt.  Harry then ends up upset over both Draco feigning that everything is all right, as well as the crap in the articles.”
“You are so beautiful.  Do you know how much I want you want you?”
“I liked the picture from your wedding.  Of the two of them dancing together.”  Hermione said.  She was looking at Draco and Teddy too.
“No, I’ve just eaten.  I went for dinner with Doris.” His voice was still flat but at least he’d managed a sentence this time.
“Potter party of five for the Anniversary Gala.” Draco announced as aristocratically as Harry had ever heard him, as they reached the light coming out of the entrance.  Harry squeezed his husband’s hand in reassurance.  Draco got posher the more nervous he was.  There weren’t a huge number of people there.  Harry guessed most people were already inside, they had purposefully arrived a little late.  The mouths of the students fell open.  Although it had been announced in the prophet that he would be attending, Harry guessed most people didn’t believe it.  Just like he knew that they didn’t really believe he’d married Draco Malfoy.  The Prophet had told too many tall tales to be truly believed by people.  He’d had to pay ten galleons over to Blaise, following a particularly ridiculous story the previous year.  He should have known better than to bet against the Harry Potter Slytherin Harem theory.  But the article the young reporter, who had photographed them that day, was completely truthful.  There was none of the wild speculation and inflammatory remarks that usually appeared in the paper.  It was exactly what he and Draco had asked for.
Andromeda sat there in stunned silence at the revelation.  That it had been going on before Harry had married was a surprise.  It was a complete shock that Harry and Draco had been together that long.
“Mmmm… that’s definitely better than talking.  I wish we could stay here all day.”
“If it pleases you Ms Granger-Weasley, I’m sure Teddy won’t mind.”
“Not all of us have disposable phones.”  She said, a little unsure of where he was going.
Robards looked at Harry kindly.  Far more kindly than Harry felt he deserved.  The fact was, Harry could easily have gotten someone else hurt working the job he did when at any moment he could have been dragged back into a flashback, particularly when the dangers of the job and the things he saw as an Auror were those things most likely to trigger and episode.  He’d gotten bloody lucky up to this point to be the only one injured.  Nearly the only one injured.  If he hadn’t come to work yesterday, Draco wouldn’t be in hospital.  He knew that.  He knew that it was his fault.  He wouldn’t let it happen again.  Robards broke him from the guilt spiral he was starting down when he spoke.  “Well, Harry. I’m glad you came to me now.  I should be furious with you, but I don’t think that would help.  I would appreciate a letter from your healer about this and we can give you a medical discharge.  Provided you are really only person that has been injured as a result of your actions, I won’t recommend a disciplinary hearing and a dismissal for gross misconduct.”
Harry pulled back the curtain.  Draco was naked with soap still in hair.  It was a beautiful sight.  Long slender limbs with water trailing down them.  Harry reached in and took Draco’s wet cock in his hand.
Harry felt groggy and disorientated.  He was lying at the foot of a large four poster bed.  The duvet under him felt like it was covered in silk.  This definitely wasn’t his room, or any room he recognised.  Sitting up he pulled the duvet over himself, he wasn’t wearing anything.  Looking around he tried to locate his glasses so he could get a better idea of his surroundings.
“I know.  I just...  I needed to go.”
“I’m here, aren’t I.”
“He runs a very successful business, although I’d apricate if you didn’t mention that to anyone.  We don’t need to have anyone nosing into that aspect of our lives if we can help it.”
Harry saw the pain on his ex-wife’s face as his daughter tore her apart with words.  Lily was similar to himself in this way, though he hadn’t really realised before.  She knew how to hurt with words in the efficient way he always seemed to manage when he lost his temper.
“Andi knows it was a shit show the last time.  She wouldn’t have asked….” Harry gulped in air, scared to say what had been plaguing his mind since this afternoon.  “She wouldn’t have asked unless it was really important.  Whatever the reason she keeps needing to go to the hospital for, she’s a lot fucking sicker than she’s letting on.”
“Given you’ve made a show of yourself and forced me to welcome you into my home, I guess you can speak now.”  The smile on Draco’s face as he said this told Harry everything he needed to know.  He wanted to take the other man in his arms and fold back time.  He wanted to undo every hurt Draco Malfoy had ever experienced.
“Again. I repeat. None of your business Malfoy.”  Potter sounded very pissed off.  Draco didn’t like the tone.
“You is wanting my mistress?”
Trigger warning:  Talk of Self Harm and attempted suicide.
“Okay, I’ll be back in a bit.”
“Do you feel up to explaining?” Blaise asked gently, shifting himself and Harry so Harry was sat between his legs and could lean back on him.  He wrapped his arms around the dark-haired boy.  Draco sat up too and leant against Blaise’s side, tangling his hands in Harry’s.
“Well, you could sell it?”
“Well eventually I figured where recognised the partner I met from.  I can’t for life of me remember his name, but I know he was in our year in Slytherin.  That, combined with the Goldburg beds, and the massive secrecy about not only your partner, but where you live, was kind of a giveaway.”
“So Draco invents potions?”
“But…”
“Yeah.  I mean I knew it was bad.  They had to keep me unconscious for week.”
“I mean… I really don’t know what I’m doing, and I’m scared that if I try it will just be awful for you… and I was… could I watch.”  The last three words came out in a rush and Harry felt his face becoming impossibly redder.
“I wasn’t sure whether that was your hunger or mine I was feeling.  I’m assuming yours then.  Did they give me nutrient potions when I was unconscious, Blaise?”
Hermione spent a week trying to break in before giving up.  Staying up near the door made her feel sick with the effort and none of her spells even came close to breaking the wards. She flopped back down on the couch after another fruitless day, exhausted by the effort.  Ginny was in the kitchen cooking dinner for the two of them.  Ron was working late that evening.
The Indian restaurant in Camden was one of Teddy’s favourites.  He was sat at a table nervously drinking water, having arrived more than half an hour early, waiting for his friend…date…whatever to arrive.  The last few days had been more than stressful.  In fact, things had been pretty stressful since the anniversary ball at Hogwarts.  It had been a mostly entertaining night, particularly when he showed Blaise and Pansy round his old common room.  They had been very jealous of the Hufflepuff set up.  He knew they’d only really come with him at first so that Harry and Dray could have some private time in Slytherin, something he did not want to think about, but he was glad he had impressed them.  The problem was, he couldn’t help but remember the aurors that had come for Dray that evening, and the stress of the situation had only been exacerbated by the letter he’d received from his two substitute parents about the further attempt at arresting Draco at the Manor.  He was glad they were both back safe at home.  He knew he shouldn’t worry about them like this, but he couldn’t help it.  He wanted to go and see them, but they insisted that he shouldn’t interrupt his life for them.  The only really good thing that had happened since then had been Justin.  Since they had bumped into each other in the park they had been texting near constantly.  His colleagues at the hospital had teased him more than once about the silly grin he wore on his face whenever a message came through.  They’d also spoken on the phone a few times, staying up far too late, talking about everything and nothing.  Today was the first time he was going to see the other man in person since that day though.
Hermione looked puzzled.
“It wasn’t them I wanted to see.”
“It’s my house.” Harry replied.
“Then we run.  We take little Draco and little Harry and we run away together.”
“Harry, darling.  I almost couldn’t believe it when I got your owl.  How long has it been since we last saw each other, 10 years?”
“I shall look forward to it.  I’ll see you two Monday unless I hear otherwise.  Same time?”
“Urrrr… What house were you in?  Sorry that’s a completely lame question.”
“Not that I can tell.  We’re pretty tucked away here.”
“I’m sure.”
“Are you sure?” Harry’s voice sounded hoarse with desire.
“Come on… it’s this one.”  Teddy said, directing Justin to number 12.  “I’m going to need a drop of your blood.”
Draco had been irrational and erratic for six days now, ever since they’d found him half frozen outside.  Blaise and Harry had had to be on constant alert.  They’d avoided another incident of Draco escaping in the middle of the night, but only by sacrificing sleep to keep an eye on him.  Draco wasn’t sleeping more than two hours a night.  Instead he frantically played the piano, or spent hours in his lab saying he was about to have a breakthrough on some potion that would change everything.  The flat was spotlessly clean, and they had more sweets and cakes than they could eat in a life time.  Nothing Harry or Blaise did would settle him.  They wouldn’t leave him alone for a second whilst he was like this, it was too dangerous.  Tara had come and seen him, but he wouldn’t talk to her.  She’d decided she had no choice but to try and adjust his potions, but it was proving challenging.   Draco was now refusing to take them.
So this is quite a long chapter for me, with a lot of description of what's happening and not much conversation.  This fic is very nearly finished.  I've all but written the next chapter, so there is just the final chapter and the epilogue for me to write now.  I have got a number of chapters of the prequal to this already written but I'm going to finish this before I upload any on of them.  It goes back to when Harry and Draco first get together and has some of the flash back scenes in this fic expanded and from the other person's point of veiw.  Obviously they didn't get their happy ending back then but hopefully it give people a little more depth into the relationship I've tried to build.
“Andromeda?”  Even if Bellatrix had been alive no one would have left a child in her care.  He’d never met his Aunt Andromeda, she’d barely even been mentioned, having been disinherited before he was born.
“Not really but continue.”  Blaise said, feeling more puzzled than ever.
“No.  But with a family like mine, it’s not exactly unheard of.  Toujours Pur… I didn’t exactly embrace the family motto.”
“Wake up.”   Harry shook Blaise.  “Wake up.”
“Yes.”
His mother tensed, and Draco wondered why.  He knew Andromeda was a touchy subject once, but he was fairly certain asking about her wouldn’t cause this reaction in his usually calm and composed mother.   “Why would you want to talk about her? She’s gone and although I shouldn’t be glad, she was my sister, I am.  She hurt you.”  Her expression showed her distaste and her body language radiated hate.  Draco realised his mother thought he’d meant Bellatrix. Draco shuddered at the thought of his mad aunt who had used to entertain herself by torturing people anytime she felt annoyed, or bored, or just because she felt like it.  Her nephew had been no exception.  He remembered his mother carrying him to his room, shaking and crying, more than once.  She’d rub his back whilst he threw up and help bathe the wounds left.  Draco didn’t want to think about that time.  It had taken him years to deal with the trauma of being tortured in his own house.  He used to get trapped in his head imagining her, or one of the other death eaters hiding round every corner, waiting to drag him back into the hell of the last year of the war.  Harry had helped him slowly crawl out of that dark space and eventually seek professional help.
“And does it?”
“I’m telling him that when I go back, I’m not going into the field.  Not for a while.”
“Good.  And if Robards refuses.”
So the story moves forward.  I'm not sure when I'll next be able to post. I have the next couple of sections written, but they're still pretty rough.  I'm at University for the next couple of weeks doing some more of my Masters which will limit my editing and writing time.  I may be able to get another chapter out of this next week, but I'm not sure.  Thank you to everyone who is sticking with me.
“Sure.”
“I have nightmares. They usually don’t let me sleep much, and even if they do, I don’t sleep well.”  Potter whispered.
“Of course, Yara.  Thank you so much for coming so promptly.”  Draco said, smiling at the women who’d been working with his family’s legal needs since not long after he and Harry had gotten married, when she’d joined the firm they used.
Malfoy looked at him and smiled in a way that screamed of cunning.  A smile Harry hadn’t seen in far too long.  One of the ones he’d seen from across the tables at Hogwarts more times than he could count.  Malfoy was clearly plotting something.  Something, Harry was sure, would be to both of their benefits, rather than to his detriment, as it had always been before.  “What do you know about you being left there?”
“And I always mean it.”  His only exception to enjoying hear Draco play was the 2am Rimsky-Korsakov.  Although he knew from experience, Draco often didn’t even remember those times.  And at the moment they weren’t important, nor something Harry really wanted to remember himself.  “You done practicing?”
Lily didn’t know what to say in reply and the silence between them started to become awkward.  Scorpius had barely been there five minutes and hadn’t even sat down.  This was turning into a disaster, Lily thought to herself.  Finally, Scorpius broke the silence.
“You need to calm down love.  I’m sure you will master this in no time.  But not when you’re like this.  You were fine when I left.  What happened?”  He pulled Draco tight against his chest and his head onto his shoulder, and then proceeded to stroke the soft blond hair.
“Think about it.  Artificial insemination only mind you.”  Draco laughed at this.  “I like being pregnant and I don’t really want any more of my own.  Besides, I think Theo might just have a complete nervous break down if we were to have another one.  Just… think about it....”
“Harry…” Malfoy’s voice sounded breathy and desperate.  Harry pressed into the blonde man, feeling his erection pushing into his back.  Then the contact was broken as Malfoy stepped away, leaving Harry stood there breathing heavily.  His body desperately wanting the contact back.
“We should spit it…”
“I….  I don’t know…”
“I just got so annoyed at everything.  The anniversary event celebrates the exact reason that we went into hiding in the first place, or at least it did the one year I went.  Going there with you just seemed like the right thing to do.”
“The longer you wait, the worse it will be.”
“Harry, come in.  Congratulations by the way, sorry I haven’t manged to speak to you before now, I had to leave the Anniversary event early, but I was so pleased to hear about your engagement to Miss Weasley.  I know you’ve always considered the Weasleys family.  It must be wonderful to be making it official.  Have you set a date yet?”
“Yes.  My Dad, Remus, Sirius, and Pettigrew were all friends at school.  Although Sirius had rebelled against most of his upbringing he still struggled against his feelings for Remus for years.  Had Sirius not gone to Azkaban, and Remus not thought he was a traitor, I like to think they would have gotten past it.  But that’s not what happened.  When Sirius escaped, eventually he came here, and Remus joined him.  They weren’t together, though from what Sirius wrote, it sounds like they acted a bit like an old married couple.  I remember them bickering non-stop the few times I was here, but they were still best friends.  The last entry in the journal was so full of hope.  Him and Remus talked about everything.  The feelings of betrayal on both sides, their desires, their hopes for the future.  Then Sirius died.  They didn’t even get to try to get a happy ending.  I don’t want that.  We have messed things up so badly over the years. But we aren’t dead.  We get to try.  But only if you want to too.  I can’t force you into this, however much I want you.  If you don’t think you can live through me leaving, then you need to do what’s best for you.  Even if it hurts, I’d rather you were alive and not with me, than forever fearing that one day I’ll do something so bad again that you can’t live with yourself.”  Harry was crying as he finished, and Draco moved towards him.  He pulled himself into the other man’s lap.
“It wasn’t because of you.  I mean… I probably wouldn’t have done it that day otherwise… Crap… I’m saying this all wrong.  I…”
“It’s definitely risky.”  Draco replied, without a hint of the apprehension Harry had had creeping up on him over the last five minutes.  Draco looked over at Harry and sighed, looking resigned to something.  He continued, making it obvious that Malfoy had already thought what was just occurring to Harry through.  “The way I see it, we could play it out like a time turner and just return to where we vanished from when we arrive at that point.  We could hide out in this time and just live our lives in complete isolation, doing whatever we could to minimise any interference.  We’d have to come up with some story about why we’re suddenly in our 30s though when we turned up at Hogwarts.  And that will leave the other versions of us, the babies who are meant to be in this time, to live the crap lives we had.  And we haven’t come back by the usual means of time travel have we – or at least it isn’t one that I’ve ever heard of.  I don’t know what brought us back here, but I know what I was thinking just before.  I wanted to do things differently.”
The concern in his friends voice almost set the tears off again.  Al was concerned for him, as well as his sister.
“I know.  I know.  I hated him there too.”  Harry reached out a hand to Blaise so he could take comfort from both of them.  “I fancy a bath before I head back to the common room.  I think I need to relax before I face anyone.”
Harry joined the que, thinking about Bakewell tarts and whether Draco could make one over the weekend.  He didn’t want to eat any of the cafeteria’s pastries, they just weren’t as good as he was used to, but the idea of the raspberry and almond treat was sticking.  He bought a slice, along with Hermione’s coffee and a pot of earl grey for himself.  He found the table Hermione was now sat at and passed her, her cup and plate over, then sat down and poured out his own cup of tea.  He opened and stirred in two packets of sugar.  He thought about it for a second and added a third. It felt like a three-sugar kind of conversation.
“I think so.  God knows why.  I can’t see what pretext they could use.”
“No.”  Andi admitted.  Cissa looked appalled.  Harry had offered but she had refused.  She knew the special treatment it would allow her wouldn’t make any difference to her prognosis, and it felt like an unnecessary expense.

“It’s Susan Nott”
“But then…” James started but stopped, seeming unsure of what to say next.
“Thank you.  I don’t think I could have walked in their again if anything was left to remind me of…”
“We’re good.  She’s so mobile now.  It’s causing no end of trouble at home.”
“Al!? You wouldn’t.” Scorpius replied.
“I’m insisting you take the purple potion before we go through this again tomorrow.  You can have the other one during the day.”  Harry completely agreed.   If the pain was this bad with the strong potion on board, then god knows how bad it would feel with a milder one.
“Anything specifically?”
The rest of the meal went a little better.  Ron managed to get Hermione off the topic of his partners pretty quickly by asking Harry if he wanted to see the latest ultrasound picture they had of the baby.  That effectively distracted Hermione and they spent a lot of time discussing the joys of pregnancy and impending parenthood.
They chatted about Teddy for a little while.  He’d spent a few mornings at the Nursery Andi had enrolled him in, so he could play some other kids his own age.  She would have like him to have gone the local muggle one, but due to his Metamorphmagus abilities, that wasn’t possible.  Harry, instead, was paying for him to go to the very exclusive wizarding one in Hogsmeade.  Blaise had been sent there when he was little and had suggested it when Harry was expressing his frustration about the situation. Draco thought it was a great idea.  He had mostly been raised by house-elf Nannies, and never really got to interact with other children. He would have loved to be able to play with others when he was little.  He said maybe if he had, he wouldn’t have been so appalling at trying to make friends when he got to Hogwarts.  His only interactions with children of his own age when he was small had been with the children of his parents’ friends, and he had always been expected to behave like the perfect pure-blood.  Playing was out of the question.
“Draco, where the hell have you been?”  Blaise demanded.
“I want a Patronus, not an owl, if something goes wrong.  An owl is too slow.  I don’t care if someone recognises it’s yours, okay.”  Harry knew how worried Blaise was when he made this request.  The relationship between the three of them was a carefully hidden secret, with only Draco and Harry’s mind healer being aware of it.  That Blaise was willing to risk his and Harry’s relationship being known for this, meant that Blaise was near out of his mind with concern for his two lovers.
“Good.  Just sometimes we don’t say it enough.”
“Yes there’s something.” Malfoy closed his eyes.  He didn’t break the contact between them, so Harry started to stroke his arm.  “Harry…”  The tone was pleading but Harry wasn’t sure whether Malfoy was asking him to stop or continue.
The room appeared to agree.
Harry slumped next to Draco on the couch and let him stroke his hair until Harry finally started to relax.
“No such luck. Just the mother and father of a pair of hangovers.” Draco replied.
“I think that might be my cue to leave.”  Harry said standing.  Despite the long awkward pauses and difficult subject matter, it had actually felt good to talk to Hermione, and he was feeling a little reckless.  “Do you want to see something fun?”
“Yes.  I don’t know how he manages it.  It worked though.  I feel a bit better than I did earlier.”
“I think I’m going to commute.  I’ve sort of gotten used to having my own space.”
Harry didn’t linger at the Manor once he dropped Scorpius off.  He and Draco made plans for him to join the two of them for lunch the next day, but for now Draco needed time with his son.  They needed time to talk through everything as much as Lily and Ginny did.  He did feel a bit left out though.  And more than anything he wished his daughter had confided more in him.  She’d always been a Daddy’s girl, and although he was glad she and Ginny were making up, it still hurt a little that he wasn’t the one she was currently entrusting with everything.  Back at Grimmauld he felt at a bit of a loss of what to do.   The evening stretched out in front of him.  Knowing he’d been neglecting his physio with everything that had happened he decided that would be a good place to start.  His leg had been really troubling him since that long walk around London culminated in him collapsing in Malfoy’s fire.  He worked at them for an hour, feeling sweaty and slightly out of breath when he finished, but satisfied.  Thinking a bath with a glass of wine and a book would be a good way to round out his evening he dragged himself upstairs to start the water running.  He called for Kreacher to pour him a glass as he browsed the bookshelf in his bedroom, trying to decide what he wanted to read.
When the two of them got to the Manor they are both laughing uncontrollably.  Harry’s sides and face actually hurt.
“Very well, I have to leave now and fix the mess the Potter brat has created.”
“I could ask.”
Harry looked down at Draco, who had woken at the racket Ron was making.  He looked rumpled, half asleep, and more beautiful than ever.
Harry followed her into her office.  Again, the room had barely changed.  He sat down on the old comfortable armchair he’d spent so many hours in previously as Doris made herself comfortable on the one opposite.
“No, I haven’t cheated.  It’s much worse than that.” The self-hatred was evident in his voice and he knew Al had heard it.
Draco responded without looking up from the sheet music.
“Teddy toast?”  Teddy asked, from Harry’s hip, where he was currently located.
“Come on then.” Draco sighed, then he stood and helped Harry to his feet.  “Let’s go to bed.”
“Are you sure Harry couldn’t have changed the warding back then?”
“No, it wasn’t like that.  Lily was just crying on me when he got there.  He told her everything.  She wouldn’t let me leave though.  I have to say, it was pretty awkward sitting there whilst your Dad confessed all to Lily.”
“I know he can’t, but I could hear every hateful thing he ever said to me.  It was like I was back in the war with the Dark Lord in the house.  They all knew what I am and relished using it against me.  They’d scream slurs at me whilst taking it in turn to cast the Cruciatious; Father included.  I was scared you’d turn on me too.”  Harry pulled Draco into his side, the touch making Draco feel better.  Harry hadn’t abandoned him.  He hadn’t run straight to the papers with denials and accusations of love potions or the Imperius.  He’d seen the paper and come to him.  This time when Draco ran off in state of desperation, the person he loved had come to find him.  They couldn’t change what was in the papers, but they could tell the world to go screw itself.  They weren’t 18 anymore.  Draco didn’t want to talk about that anymore though, he knew he’d just get himself into a state again, so changed the subject.  “I was trying to tell Tori about Scorpius and Lily before you arrived.  She would have been so much better at managing this than I am.”
Ron and Hermione were not happy when Harry stumbled back to the dorm just after 7am.  The room had let them sleep in a little later than usual.
“Fine.  You sure you can trust him though.  He is a reporter.”
“I am too, but I should probably head off.”
“You’re not 17 yet.”
“I’m afraid it has to be.  This just isn’t the right time.  I’m sure you’ve seen the papers, and with Lily and Scorpius.  I need to spend time with my family.  Besides, my leg hasn’t recovered enough to work full time.”
“I’m not sure I want to see those photos.”  Hermione replied, interpreting the look and guessing at what four drunk adults had gotten up to reliving their youth in the castle.
“Let me carry him to bed.”
“We should get the wards on this place set up.  It shouldn’t take long.  Then I think we should nap for an hour.  We can get Tawly to wake us.”
Draco sighed.  “We got together about 2 months after the end of the war.”
“I’m sorry, Love.  I’m so sorry.”  Harry pulled Draco in tighter.  After several long minutes, Draco’s arms moved and wrapped around him in return.  Harry relished in the embrace for several long moment before speaking.
Hermione knocked on the door and it opened.  The woman in front of her bore an uncanny resemblance to Bellatrix Lestrange.  She was glad she was seeing her fifteen years down the line, and not immediately following the war.  The subtle changes, of age and time, helped her not react with automatic revulsion and fear.  Like the mad woman who’d tortured and permanently scarred her was stood in front of her.  The obvious annoyance the older woman was displaying, at having Hermione showing up on her doorstep without any notice, wasn’t particularly comforting, however.
Al had been surprisingly good about the whole thing.  After that initial shock the four of them had waited silently.  All clearly feeling embarrassed about the whole thing.  Lily had slipped off his lap when Al had spoken.  Her face had gone bright red with embarrassment and was clashing furiously with her hair.  Scorpius had tried to stutter out some kind of explanation, but before his brain was able to make coherent words Al had burst into laughter at the two of them.  Rosie had quickly joined in, whilst Scorpius and Lily just sat there in stunned silence.
“But… How?” The words came out calmer but the confusion the other boy was feeling was obvious.
“You can open them now.  I’m in.”
“It doesn’t feel like just a rough patch, we’ve had those before, mostly in the early days before the kids.  Right now, it feels like she’s avoiding me.  It was bad when the kids were around, and now they’re back at school I feel like I never see her.  She has barely been home in the last two weeks.  She says she’s just really busy at work with the Quidditch season starting up, but I never remember it being like this in the past”.
“Draco…”
“Yup.  Have all of the diagnoses to prove it and everything.”
“What was that?”  Harry didn’t understand a word Draco had said with the words all garbled together.
“Not too long, sweetheart.  Just want to get some fresh air.  You two enjoy your food, then you should try and get a bit more rest.”
“No.  I filed the reports.  I wouldn’t do that to you.”  He wouldn’t.  Even if Draco decided he could never see him again he would continue to file the reports.
“Lily, I think we need to slow down for a moment before we get carried away.”  She looked hurt when he said this and started to pull away from him.  “Wait Lily, I don’t mean we have to stop, just…” his eyes wavered downwards.
“I should be asking you that, but yes, I’m okay.  Just overdid it a bit.”
Harry walked to the bed where Narcissa was lying.  He placed little Draco in her arms and he immediately cuddled up to his mum.
“You know you can tell me what you’re feeling.  I can’t promise I’ll understand completely, but I can try.  I don’t know what it’s like to have parents’ divorce, or to be expecting a new half sibling to arrive within a few months, but I do know what it’s like to have your family life completely change and to not have both parents around together anymore.  I also know what it’s like to have parent come out.”
Rather than going to lunch with the rest of his peers after potions, he headed to the library to try and search out reasons for suddenly sharing pain with school rivals.  He also thought he should look up sudden shared trust, as he was sure Potter following him to the Slytherin dorms and accepting a potion off him wasn’t natural either.  There must be some spell involved.  Merlin knows what it was, or more importantly, why or how it was put on the two of them, but whatever was happening wasn’t normal.  The library didn’t seem to hold any clues, much to Draco’s frustration.  Sure there were spells that allowed one to feel another’s pain, but they were complex and involved the two parties actually casting them on each other.  One thing he was absolutely sure of was that that hadn’t happened.  He eventually dragged himself from the library to go to his afternoon classes, but he barely paid attention.  As soon as he was free to, he went back to the library to bury himself in books again.  He shouldn’t have bothered.  There was nothing in there, and then at seven o’clock sharp the pain in his hand hit.  Stupid Potter hadn’t used his ointment.  If possible, the pain was worse than the previous evening.  Despite the murtlap essence he had provided, the skin was still over sensitive, and therefore the slicing of the blood quill irritated even more than it had.  A week of this.  He had a whole week of being tortured because the Ministry stooge had decided she had it in for Potter.  Why was this his life?  If it wasn’t horrible enough that his Father had come back from the Dark Lords resurrection a complete wreck, having been held under the cruciatious curse repeatedly because Potter had escaped.  They also had a delightful new house guest, who thought torturing people was the height of entertainment.   All of that had led to a decidedly shit summer.  And now he had to put up with this unbearable pain, and it wasn’t even his.  There had been odd flashes of pain over the summer, now that he’d thought about it.  He’d thought it was the aftermath of him experiencing the nastier side of his father’s bouts of temper at the time.  But maybe it was this thing with Potter.  The first time it had happened had been during the third task, but everything that had happened afterwards had thrown it from his memory.  That time certainly couldn’t be put down to anything anyone had done to him.  Had that pain been Potter’s too.  He needed a solution to this.  His family was very much against Potter, and that would not work for him if he had to go through every agony Gryffindor had to.
“No.  Potions and charms.  Similar to the ones we used at Hogwarts.  It’s horrid talking to an invisible person.  With those we could see him, even if no one else could.”
Birthday.  The moment both of you were arrested I was able to access the wards.”  Draco had speculated that Harry probably would have been able to do it anyway, even before they had gotten married and before the arrest, but they had never had the need to test the theory.  But Lucius didn’t need to know that.  Nor did he need to know about Blaise for the moment.
“No.  Just me, you and Blaise.”  Harry winced slightly at the statement.  Sirius should have been part of it too, but he was gone.  Gone because of Harry’s rash decision.  A decision that had not only resulted in the death of his godfather but had caused the other half of him to suffer so much agony he’d collapsed into this state of semi-consciousness.
Harry decided to leave the whole tangle of inheritance for the moment.  It was giving him a headache and he wasn’t really sure why it was so important, aside from being a way to get access to money and property.
But Harry couldn’t hear what was said next as the tears started falling down his face and he cuddled into little Draco.  Then there was a larger pair of arms wrapped around both him and the toddler.  Draco had obviously given little Harry over to one of the others.
Draco laughed.  A bright happy laugh, if a slightly doped up one.  They make their way back to the living room, where Teddy was still, thankfully, happily colouring.  The toddler looks up at them when they enter.
“Yes James.” Her Dad replied.
“Because she can’t do anything but forgive you.”
“I know, but sometimes when you feel conflicted about this, the way I was, you try and hide it.  I loved your mum, it just wasn’t the right kind of love, but for a long time that was enough.  Especially with you and your brothers.  But the more time that passed, the more it was making both me and your mum miserable with each other; although she didn’t know why, and I wouldn’t admit to myself.  Mum knows now and we both think it’s better this way.  We think it’s better for you, Al and James to have two happy parents who are friends, rather than two unhappy ones trying to keep a relationship together.”
“Just like us…”
“She’s never getting to you again.  No one is getting to you, or little Draco, to hurt you again.”
There were also presents every Christmas.   Each of them giving them some new insight into Harry’s life with Malfoy.  It was mostly very carefully put together photo albums, although they’d also received a few souvenirs from the countless holidays Harry and Malfoy seemed to take.  The souvenirs were obviously bought for them at the time, the same as the postcards he’d written.  They just hadn’t received them before now.  It was the photo albums that told her about Harry’s life though.  Unlike the first album, where she was sure Harry had purposefully selected only to include two photos of him and Draco, the later albums contained more photos of him, as well as the other Slytherins they were friends with.  There was also usually some kind of theme to the pictures.   The album they’d received the 5
“How are we supposed to talk when I don’t know where she is and she’s never home?”
“Soon.  Before the anniversary.  I want to be back out of England before that chaos kicks up.”
“Tom.  It’s okay.  We don’t judge you.  We don’t care what you did in the past.  You’re here with us now.  You’re not that person anymore.”  It was the posh voice again.  Somehow, he seemed to have seen directly into his thoughts.
“Then you need to stay somewhere else until you can trust yourself not to try and sneak in and kill him.”
Horcrux Hunting is a little easier when you communicate and cooperate.
This speech brought forth a more aggressive hiss at Ginny and the kitten tried to leap from Harry’s arms to attack her again.
“You count Sirius as your family.  He’s not exactly normal.”
“You did what you had to do.”
Harry apparated away to Grimmauld place with a wide smile still on his face.
“Most people don’t.  Me and Draco did a lot of things to hide our identities.” Harry looked guilty as he said this, but then brightened, and Hermione had the suspicion that Teddy had spent his Hogwarts years having to pretend to be someone else in order not to be traced back to Harry and Draco.  It was probably a bit overkill if she thought about it.  She doubted anyone would connect Teddy Lupin to Harry Potter.  It was only by chance that she had when she first bumped into him.  “But he was head boy in his 7
“Thank you.  And I meant what I said about calling me Narcissa.  You are important to my son.”  The tone of her voice was different than it had been the day before, and this time Harry believed her.
“What?”
Selfishly, this was exactly what Draco needed to hear.  That Harry’s old family hadn’t been able to worm their way in.  That Harry hadn’t decided, on seeing them again, that Draco wasn’t actually worth losing the first people he’d called family.  He knew it was just his own insecurities that had told him this might happen.  He knew Harry loved him and wasn’t going to abandon the life they’d built, but there was still a small part of his mind that told him he wasn’t worth the trouble.  Harry coming back and telling him that he was still Draco’s helped push his doubts away again.  “I love you.”
“You is here to see the Master?”
“Harry…! wait a second.”  Hermione said, needing to say one more thing before Harry left and getting up herself.
“Because I was never going to do it.  You sound like you’re actually serious about this.”
“In the nightmare I saw Ron’s dad being attacked by a giant snake.”  Harry had started crying, and Blaise really didn’t know what to do now.  It seemed Draco did though, as he pulled Harry’s head into his chest and started stroking his hair.  Harry continued through the tears, seeming comforted by Draco’s actions. “It wasn’t a normal dream. I knew that it had really happened, and that Arthur Weasley was lying dying and bleeding somewhere, and no one was going to save him. I managed to persuade Professor McGonagall to take me to the headmaster, who confirmed it was real.  They got someone to Mr Weasley in time.  Just.  Dumbledore sent me and all the Weasley children to my Godfather’s place.”
“No.”  Andromeda replied, looking over at her sister and remembering how distressed she had been only a short while ago.  “I think I’ll stay here with my sister.  We have years of catching up to do.  Will you be okay with Teddy for the day?”
Little Harry disappeared from the mat Draco was changing him on with a pop.  Harry and Draco were petrified.  They had no idea where the baby had gone.  What if somehow Dumbledore had taken him.  There was a giggle from behind them and they swung round.  Little Harry was sat in the doorway completely naked.  Having somehow banished the clothes Draco had been fighting so hard to half get on the little boy, as well as disapparating from the changing mat.
“I… I know… I just… I need to get closer.”
“Uhhh, you’ve been in here before?”
“I was worried about you and Dray after everything.  And the Prophet is writing all sorts of crap about him.  I needed to see you.”
Draco had raced from the hospital to the centre as soon as he’d dropped Lily and Scorpius there.  He remembered the wave of fear when one of his elves appeared in his study asking him to go to the area of the garden where Lily and Scorpius were urgently.  When he’d gotten there Scorpius was white as a sheet, whilst Lily seemed mostly calm.  At first, he thought it was his son that needed him, then he watched as the next contraction started and knew exactly what was happening.  He’d helped Lily back to the house, relieved that they’d only had to stop once during the short walk whilst Lily had another contraction.    He hadn’t known whether it would be best to leave Lily and Scorpius here and go get Harry or take the couple to St Mungos first.  Another contraction had decided it for him.  He managed to bundle the two of them into the floo, get them to the hospital and get Lily checked in before he apparated to go get Harry.  He damned the centre for being so far away from the nearest apparition point when he arrived and started running.
